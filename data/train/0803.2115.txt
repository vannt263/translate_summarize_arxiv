    "in recent years we have witnessed the emergence of a new branch of applied physics named microfluidics , which is the science of designing , manufacturing devices and processes that deal with volumes of fluid on the order of nanoliters @xcite .",
    "microfluidic systems have diverse and widespread potential applications @xcite . some examples of systems and processes that might employ this technology include ink - jet printers , blood - cell - separation equipment , biochemical assays , chemical synthesis , genetic analysis , drug screening , electrochromatography , surface micro - machining , laser ablation , and mechanical micro - milling .",
    "not surprisingly , the medical industry has shown keen interest in microfluidics technology .",
    "such advances in manipulating fluids @xcite have recently motivated penna and tarazona @xcite to consider a model representing a simple device to push a dilute solution of colloidal particles along a narrow channel .",
    "in particular they studied the effect of a moving barrier on a system of non interacting colloidal particles described by overdamped langevin dynamics . under the action of the potential barrier shifting at a constant speed ,",
    "the fluid achieves a steady state , with density distribution and local current following the moving barrier .",
    "these authors showed that such a steady state can be conveniently studied within the ddft @xcite formalism , since the structure of the relevant equations becomes similar to that of the euler - lagrange equations describing a fluid at thermodynamic equilibrium @xcite .    on the other hand",
    ", the present authors in a recent paper  @xcite , hereafter referred as ref .",
    "i , have considered how the inertia of the particles may modify the ddft picture .",
    "they assumed that the colloidal particles have inertia , i.e. are governed by a second order stochastic equation .",
    "the governing equation for the associated phase - space distribution turns out to be the kramers equation @xcite and represents the evolution of both positions and momenta of the particles .",
    "since such a representation is still too complex and often redundant , the authors considered a contraction of such a description by rewriting the kramers equation in terms of the infinite hierarchy of equations for the velocity moments of the phase - space distribution . in ref .",
    "i the hierarchy was truncated systematically by means of a multiple time scale technique , which lead to a self - consistent equation involving only the one - body density .",
    "this equation is similar to to the ddft equation , but contains additional terms taking into account the presence of momentum and energy currents . while in ref .",
    "i we considered only transient effects , namely the decay of initial perturbations towards the equilibrium , time independent , state , in the present work we illustrate how the inertial dynamics affects the behavior of systems in situations in which a steady state is induced by the presence of an external time - dependent potential",
    ". the results of the present paper show pronounced differences with respect to the ddft study of penna and tarazona and in particular display an exponential decay in the structure of the density profile behind the barrier which was not predicted by the ddft .",
    "moreover , we find that also the local temperature is non uniform throughout the system due to the heating produced by the barrier .",
    "we believe that these findings are generic to non equilibrium systems where the equilibration mechanism provided by the heat bath is not very rapid .",
    "we have shown that when the friction is not sufficiently high the density alone is not sufficient to characterize the steady state of the system , and additional fields are necessary to provide a complete description .",
    "more generally speaking , we believe that the use of the ddft , is justified when the currents are of diffusive character , while in the cases where convective terms are present it is necessary to include extra terms which describe the transport of momentum and energy @xcite    the present paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "[ theory ] after presenting the model we give the structure of the general solution of the kramers equation in the region where the potential is vanishing small . in [ steady ] ,",
    "we specialize the treatment to the case of steady state conditions and derive explicitly the behavior of the phase space distribution in the region where the traveling potential vanishes .",
    "we also derive the relation between the total force exerted by the barrier on the particles and the friction due to the bath . finally in [ numerical ]",
    "we give explicit numerical solutions of the kramers equation in the case of an inverted parabolic barrier .",
    "we conclude the paper with a short discussion in [ conclusions ] .",
    "the problem of the steady states in a fluid , under the action of a shifting external potential , has been considered within the ddf under several conditions and model interactions@xcite . in all these treatments",
    "the inertia of the particles did not play any role . here",
    "we wish to consider how the inertial effects modify that picture , and to such a purpose we consider here the simplest case , which could describe a dilute solution of colloidal particles dragged along a narrow channel under the action of a moving potential barrier , modeled by a time dependent external potential , @xmath0 , which acts on the colloidal particles but has negligible effects on the solvent . to such purpose",
    "we consider here an assembly of non interacting identical particles of mass @xmath1 moving in one dimension , and described by the following stochastic dynamics  @xcite @xmath2 with a bath providing the particles a friction constant @xmath3 , and a thermalizing noise with @xmath4 at temperature @xmath5 .",
    "the external force associated with the traveling potential is @xmath6 , and the properties of the system can be studied by considering the equation governing @xmath7 , the density distribution in phase space of a single particle .",
    "the associated kramers equation  @xcite reads , @xmath8 p(x , v , t)= \\gamma \\bigr[\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial v } v + \\frac{t_o}{m}\\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial v^2 } \\bigr ] p(x , v , t ) \\label{fokker}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we assume that the shifting external potential is localized within a finite region and vanishes outside .",
    "therefore , far away from such a region we should have a time independent equilibrium distribution @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the density of particles and @xmath11 the gaussian width for their velocity distribution .",
    "for a static external potential , i.e. the @xmath12 limit of , the distribution @xmath7 would evolve in time towards the thermal equilibrium value @xmath13 , which would be reached ( sooner or later ) from any initial distribution @xmath14 .",
    "for @xmath15 the continuous shift of the external potential implies a permanent perturbation of the thermal equilibrium , but still there would be a transient evolution from any @xmath14 to a unique stationary state @xmath16 in which the time dependence is reduced to a shift of the @xmath17 coordinate , to follow the external potential @xmath18 .",
    "this steady state is the object of the present study .",
    "all the results presented here may be translated to a purely static distribution in the presence of a time independent external potential @xmath19 , with a constant slope plus the same potential barrier which we are considering in eq . .",
    "the time derivative in the first term of eq .",
    "vanishes , but there is an extra term proportional to @xmath20 , to take into account the constant background force added to the localized barrier force @xmath21 .",
    "away from the barrier the particles move at constant mean velocity @xmath22 , and a change of reference framework from @xmath23 to @xmath24 , leads to exactly the same equation for @xmath25 , when the barrier appears as moving at rate @xmath26 .",
    "these two equivalent versions of the same problem have been studied within the ddf formalism  @xcite , valid for large @xmath3 .",
    "the same exact mapping between the moving barrier in a flat background and the static barrier in a sloped potential would be valid for partially damped systems explored here .",
    "it is convenient to introduce the following dimensionless variables : @xmath27    @xmath28    accordingly , kramers evolution equation for the phase space distribution function can be rewritten with the help of relations ( [ adim1]-[adim2 ] ) as : @xmath29 having introduced the `` fokker - planck '' operator @xmath30 whose eigenfunctions @xmath31 have the property : @xmath32   h_{\\mu}(v ) = -\\mu h_{\\mu}(v ) , \\label{fokkerp}\\ ] ] for @xmath33,and have the explicitly representation : @xmath34    it is convenient to define raising and lowering operators in the eigenfunctions series , @xmath35 , so that the contributions of the damping and the external forces in the last two terms of eq .",

    "the physical interpretation of such a combination is that an initially pure current fluctuation , described by @xmath53 would die very fast , as @xmath54 , but leaving behind a density fluctuation proportional to @xmath55 , which would evolve diffusively .",
    "the particular combination in ( [ auto1 ] ) is such that it completely cancels that remnant density fluctuations , i.e. it orthogonalizes @xmath56 to @xmath51 , and leaves a purely _ fast _ decaying form .",

    "since the steady solution has the property @xmath72= - c   \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x } \\left [ p^{(\\mu)}(x , v,\\tau)\\right ] , \\label{diff}\\ ] ] it follows that @xmath73= - c \\exp(- \\mu \\gamma \\tau )   \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x } \\left [   \\phi^{(\\mu)}(x,\\tau)\\right ] , \\label{diff2}\\ ] ] so that we can transform the diffusion equation for the _ master _ distribution into an ordinary differential equation @xmath74 whose solutions are proportional to @xmath75 with @xmath76    finally the product @xmath77 featuring in eq",

    "the maximum temperature is @xmath251 , and it is still located at the rear half of the barrier , associated to the minimum density .",
    "the `` precursor film '' at the front is much shorter and higher , so that only for the lowest value of @xmath69 may may be interpreted as a incipient `` plateau '' , this is consistent whit the interpretation given above when we consider the density distributions in fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] .",
    "the most peculiar feature of @xmath246 at this high value of @xmath155 is the appearance of local minimum between the main maximum and the front edge of the barrier .",
    "the relative importance of this feature increases with decreasing @xmath69 , i.e. as the inertial effects become more important .",
    "a possible interpretation could be that the decrease of @xmath246 for @xmath252 is a signature of the adiabatic expansion of the ideal fluid when it climbs the potential barrier .",
    "therefore it should be restricted to large @xmath155 and low @xmath69 , to avoid the thermalization with the bath .    finally , we present in fig",
    ".  fig:7 the results for the total force @xmath253 , from eq .  , obtained both for the low and high shifting rates , as functions of the damping @xmath69 .",
    "we present the results for three different choices of the parametrization , @xmath179 from @xmath254 to @xmath255 , so that they give also a picture of the convergence of our treatment in terms of the free modes of the system . notice that from eqs .   and",
    ", the same results may be scaled to get the total power pumped by the barrier , and are directly associated to the excess of mass , and of kinetic energy through the relationship   imposed by the steady state condition .",
    "the results shows a clear difference between the @xmath227 case , with very little dependence of @xmath253 on @xmath69 , and the high rate shift , @xmath256 , with a very rapid decay of the force for increasing damping .",
    "colloidal particles when subjected to external driving forces exhibit may properties which are different from those of equilibrium systems . in the present paper",
    "we have described the effect of a barrier moving at constant velocity in a one dimensional colloidal fluid in the approximation that the solvent is unaffected by the barrier .",
    "in contrast with previous approaches which have considered only overdamped dynamics , we have studied the case where inertia plays a role .",
    "the two major effects of inertial terms are first to determine the appearance of a wake structure , completely absent in the ddf treatment and of an infinite set of characteristic lengths in the regions near the moving barrier ; and second to produce not only a strongly structured density distribution near the barrier , and the associated current density , but also the higher order moments of the velocity distribution distribution , which may be represented as a local temperature profile , very different from that of the thermalizing bath , and which shows interesting characteristics .",
    "it is also interesting that the method used here , based on the natural expansion of the distribution @xmath66 for free systems , gives an intuitive connection with the previous results based on the ddf treatment , i.e. using the density distribution @xmath257 as the only relevant field . that approach is recovered in as the limit of the simplest description of @xmath66 in terms of the first free mode ( the only one with a purely diffusive dynamics , without an exponential decay time ) .",
    "the local balance of mass and force reproduce the ddf result of a smoluchowski equation . to achieve the equivalent local balances for the energy , heat currents , etc ... , we have to enlarge the parametrization for @xmath66 , to include exponential decaying modes , which represent the effects of the inertial dynamics of the particles .",
    "we have analyzed here only the simplest case , of one - dimensional spatial distributions in the dilute , ideal gas , limit .",
    "the equivalent results under other geometrical conditions , when the particles can bypass the moving barrier  @xcite , and including the effects of the particle interactions  @xcite , have been explored under the ddf assumptions , and it would be interesting to generalize them to the present approach .",
    "it is perhaps worth to comment that the wake region is not specific to the flow of particles with inertia .",
    "very similar effects were also found in higher dimensions for overdamped , brownian particles driven past colloids , which act in this case as the potential barriers @xcite . as shown by penna et al . @xcite there exists a sum rule stating that the integral for the wake in any transversal plane to the direction of the drift vanishes , so that the depletion along the axis through the obstacle is exactly cancelled by the contribution from the lateral wings .",
    "such a sum rule is valid in any dimension , but of course , in @xmath258 implies that there is no wake at all .",
    "the presence of a wake structure in @xmath258 , in the inertial case , should correspond to a breaking of the sum rule for its transverse integral in @xmath259 .",
    "the present results perhaps are of relevance for microfluidic devices where colloidal particles move along narrow channels in order to understand what external forces are needed to induce a drift in the presence of brownian fluctuations .",
    "the hydrodynamics interaction , which have been neglected here , could not be important in one dimension due to the screening effect , and we may expect that , at least at a qualitative level , the predictions made here could be accessible to experimental observation .",

    "<S> motivated by recent studies on the dynamics of colloidal solutions in narrow channels , we consider the steady state properties of an assembly of non interacting particles subject to the action of a traveling potential moving at a constant speed while the solvent is modeled by a heat bath at rest in the laboratory frame . since the description , we propose here , takes into account the inertia of the colloidal particles it is necessary to consider the evolution of both positions and momenta and study the governing equation for the one - particle phase - space distribution . </S>",
    "<S> we first derive the asymptotic form of its solutions as an expansion in hermite polynomials and their generic properties , such as the force and energy balance and then we particularize our study to the case of an inverted parabolic potential barrier . </S>",
    "<S> we obtain numerically the steady state density and temperature profile and show that the expansion is rapidly convergent for large values of the friction constant and small drifting velocities . </S>",
    "<S> the present results on the one hand confirm the previous studies based on the dynamic density functional theory ( ddft ) when the friction constant is large , on the other hand display effects such as the presence of a wake behind the barrier and a strong inhomogeneity in the temperature field which are beyond the ddft description . </S>"
