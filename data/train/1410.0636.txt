    "massive vector particles are of relevance for various subfields of physics including the weak interaction , test models for photon - mass searches , and the regularization of certain infrared divergences in quantum - field calculations . in this latter context",
    ", the mass term should be introduced such that the symmetries of the original model remain unspoiled . for a u(1 ) lorentz - invariant gauge theory , this can be accomplished with the stueckelberg method.@xcite    in recent years , lorentz - violating quantum field theories have become a focus of theoretical@xcite and experimental@xcite inquiry .",
    "such theories also require the regularization of infrared divergences in some circumstances , and the question arises , as to whether the stueckelberg method can be adapted to such lorentz - breaking u(1 ) gauge theories . as in the lorentz - invariant case ,",
    "the adapted stueckelberg method should be compatible with all symmetries of the theory to be regulated , so that the usual stueckelberg approach can be employed for the lorentz - violating extension of conventional qed .",
    "however , the lorentz violation in this model allows a broader range of compatible stueckelberg terms that may be introduced , and this freedom can then be used to streamline calculations in lorentz - breaking qed .",
    "the present work provides one possible class of extensions of the usual stueckelberg procedure to lorentz - violating qed .",
    "section [ lagr ] gives a brief overview of the procedure at the lagrangian level .",
    "some implications of the lorentz - breaking stueckelberg lagrangian are discussed in sec .",
    "we begin with the usual free - photon lagrangian in the minimal standard - model extension coupled to a conserved source @xmath0 : @xmath1 here , lorentz and cpt breakdown is controlled by the spacetime - constant backgrounds @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "the absence of lorentz symmetry in the above lagrangian  ( [ lagrangian ] ) allows us to drop the requirement of lorentz invariance for the mass - type term @xmath4 to be introduced for the photon .",
    "however , the inclusion of arbitrary lorentz violation into @xmath4 may be problematic : consider the case in which @xmath2 and @xmath3 are such that a subgroup of the lorentz group remains unbroken . a regulator violating",
    "this residual symmetry may be undesirable , so that the breakdown of the remaining invariant subgroup may have to be excluded from @xmath4 .    for our present purposes , however",
    ", we consider arbitrary lorentz violation in @xmath4 .",
    "this yields more general results also relevant for purposes other than infrared regularization .",
    "more specifically , we implement the stueckelberg procedure by introducing a scalar field @xmath5 as follows:@xcite @xmath6 where @xmath7 can later be identified with the photon mass and @xmath8 with @xmath9 a lorentz - violating operator that may contain derivatives but is otherwise spacetime constant . the small number of lorentz - symmetric pieces still contained in an arbitrary @xmath9 can be removed if necessary .    as in the conventional stueckelberg case ,",
    "the key feature of @xmath10 is its invariance ( up to total derivatives ) under a local gauge transformation @xmath11 with the addition of @xmath12-type gauge fixing @xmath13 and a faddeev ",
    "popov contribution @xmath14 , the model lagragian @xmath15 becomes@xcite @xmath16 note that the scalar @xmath5 and the ghosts @xmath17 and @xmath18 are now decoupled and can be integrated out .",
    "we can therefore disregard these fields in what follows .",
    "the lagrangian  ( [ eq : totall ] ) yields the following equation of motion for the photon : @xmath19f_{\\alpha\\beta}&&\\nonumber\\\\ { } + \\left[m^2\\hat{\\eta}^{\\mu\\nu } + \\frac{1}{\\xi}\\hat{\\eta}^{\\mu\\alpha}\\hat{\\eta}^{\\nu\\beta}\\partial_\\alpha\\partial_\\beta\\right]a_\\mu & = & j^\\nu \\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] taking the 4-divergence of this equation yields @xmath20 note that @xmath21 projects out one degree of freedom contained in @xmath22 .",
    "equation  ( [ longitudinal ] ) establishes that this degree of freedom is not excited by the source @xmath23 , so @xmath21 is an auxiliary mode .",
    "this is consistent with the expectation of three physical degrees of freedom for a massive vector field .    a plane - wave ansatz in eq .",
    "( [ eom1 ] ) yields the model s dispersion relation ; it has the following structure:@xcite @xmath24 the first factor does not contain physical modes .",
    "the @xmath25 piece corresponds to the auxiliary mode governed by eq .",
    "( [ longitudinal ] ) .",
    "the factor @xmath26 is associated with the physical degrees of freedom and has the structure @xmath27 here , the coefficients @xmath28 are coordinate scalars containing the lorentz - breaking tensors @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "they vanish in the limit @xmath29 .",
    "the explicit expressions for the @xmath28 can be found in the literature.@xcite note that the physical dispersion relation  ( [ physdr ] ) is consistent with the expectation of three conventional massive modes perturbed by small lorentz violation .",
    "the exact expression for the corresponding propagator is somewhat unwieldy.@xcite but for most applications only leading - order lorentz - violating effects need to be taken into account .",
    "the lorentz - breaking contributions can then be incorporated via this propagator insertion ( see also fig .  [ fig]):@xcite @xmath30",
