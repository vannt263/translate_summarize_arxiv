    "mode conversion is the process under which an incident wave may be wholly or partially converted into another wave mode , with the remainder of the original wave being transmitted through the plasma .",
    "this may occur where the sound and alfvn speeds are equal , or equivalently , where the plasma @xmath0 ( the ratio of the gas to the magnetic pressure ) is approximately unity .",
    "this layer will generally lie low down in the solar atmosphere , in the region of the lower chromosphere .",
    "this problem has been investigated extensively in the past , many using analytical techniques .",
    "@xcite , @xcite and @xcite investigated the conversion of fast magnetoacoustic waves into slow magnetoacoustic waves as they propagate up through the solar atmosphere from high- to low-@xmath0 plasma .",
    "their model looked at a uniform vertical magnetic field set in an isothermal atmosphere stratified by gravity .",
    "using the fact that , for harmonic waves , an exact solution may be found in terms of the known meijer - g functions , coefficients describing the conversion and transmission were found .",
    "@xcite expanded on this work by noting that these solutions may also be written in terms of the equivalent hypergeometric @xmath1 functions , and another set of coefficients was discovered .",
    "-axis points upwards ( opposite to gravity ) and a slow wave is driven on the upper boundary , travelling down towards the mode - conversion layer at @xmath2 . ]",
    "we also investigate the mode conversion problem analytically , although we combine this with numerical simulations .",
    "we look at a uniform background magnetic field , but , in contrast to the aforementioned work , we investigate downward propagation - so the wave is travelling from low- to high-@xmath0 plasma ( as shown in figure  [ model.fig ] ) . as the fast wave is evanescent in low-@xmath0 plasma , we look at the conversion of slow to fast magnetoacoustic waves .    in section  [ eqns.sec ]",
    "the basic equations are set out , and we look at the characteristic wave behaviour in high- and low-@xmath0 plasma .",
    "two different situations are then examined : an isothermal atmosphere in section  [ iso.sec ] , and a non - isothermal atmosphere in section  [ noniso.sec ] .",
    "finally the conclusions are detailed in section  [ conc.sec ] .",
    "throughout we use the standard , ideal mhd equations , linearised about the equilibrium @xmath3 , and @xmath4 ; where @xmath5 and @xmath6 may be defined as the scale height .",
    "so we have the equation of motion @xmath7 the induction equation @xmath8 the mass continuity equation @xmath9 and the energy equation @xmath10 where subscript zero denotes the equilibrium quantities and subscript one the perturbed quantities . in these equations @xmath11 is the equilibrium magnetic field , and @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the equilibrium pressure and density which may be calculated from the equilibrium equation above .",
    "the variable @xmath14 denotes the plasma velocity , @xmath15 is the plasma pressure , @xmath16 is the magnetic permeability , @xmath17 is the magnetic field , @xmath18 is the mass density , @xmath19 is the gravitational acceleration , and @xmath20 is the ratio of specific heats , which we take to be @xmath21 . henceforth , the subscripts on the perturbed variables are dropped , and it is understood that we are working with the linearised equations .    under the assumption that the @xmath22-dependence is of the form @xmath23 , where @xmath24 isthe horizontal wavenumber , equations  ( [ linmo.eqn])  ( [ linen.eqn ] ) may be combined to form a pair of wave equations @xmath25 @xmath26 where @xmath27 and @xmath28 are the squared sound and alfvn speeds respectively .",
    "these are in agreement with those discovered by @xcite .    examining these equations we can see that if the effects of gravity are negligible and the horizontal wavenumber is small , then the wave operators on the left - hand side are the same when @xmath29 . at this point",
    "there is a resonance which allows the mode conversion process to occur .",
    "note that when the horizontal wavenumber is zero , there is no mode conversion .",
    "we solve these equations numerically using the maccormack finite difference scheme .",
    "this is a type of lax - wendroff , two - step , predictor - corrector method .",
    "we use backward differencing for the predictor steps and forward differencing for the corrector steps , thus ensuring that we have more accurate values on the upper boundary where we drive a sine wave in the vertical velocity @xmath30 .",
    "as previously mentioned , this is predominantly a slow wave as the fast wave is evanescent in the low-@xmath0 plasma .",
    ".characteristic properties of the slow and fast magnetoacoustic waves depending on their position in the solar atmosphere .",
    "[ cols=\"<,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     as the wave propagates across the @xmath2 layer it is important to remember that the slow and fast waves have different properties above and below this region ; table  [ wavprop.tab ] identifies these .",
    "we are driving a slow wave in low-@xmath0 plasma , the transmitted component of this wave will demonstrate the same characteristics in the high-@xmath0 plasma . from the table",
    "we see that the transmitted wave is thus the fast wave , and the converted part must then be the slow wave .",
    "to begin with we investigate an isothermal atmosphere , so the sound speed will remain constant while the alfvn speed varies with height .",
    "the left - hand plot in figure  [ iso.fig ] shows the vertical velocity from the numerical simulation .",
    "this displays a strong exponential nature which is due to the gravitational stratification , and this masks what is occurring at the mode - conversion region ( dashed line ) which lies at @xmath31 .",
    "we may overcome this by making the transformation @xmath32 so that the exponential behaviour is removed and the incident wave has a constant amplitude . upon doing this",
    "we obtain the right - hand plot of figure  [ iso.fig ] .",
    "there is now a clear change at the conversion region , with a definite decrease in amplitude and the presence of two wave modes .",
    "the transmitted fast wave can be seen propagating out in front , while the converted slow wave is visible in the form of interference . as both the incident and transmitted waves have a constant amplitude after this transformation we may calculate the proportion of transmission directly .",
    "we shall utilise this later to test the accuracy of the analytical predictions .    , for @xmath33 and @xmath34 at @xmath35 alfvn times .",
    "transformed vertical velocity , @xmath36 , for the same parameters . in both cases",
    "the dashed line indicates where @xmath29 . ]",
    "the first analytical technique we use to examine mode conversion is the wkb method .",
    "this involves expanding the horizontal and vertical velocity components , @xmath37 and @xmath30 , in inverse powers of @xmath38 ( the driving frequency ) .",
    "this is valid under the assumption that @xmath38 is large , and will give solutions valid outside the mode - conversion region . substituting these expansions into the wave equations",
    "( [ wavx.eqn ] ) and  ( [ wavz.eqn ] ) we obtain the solutions @xmath39 where @xmath40 and @xmath41 are the conversion and transmission coefficients respectively .",
    "note that we have also extracted the exponential dependence seen in the simulations .",
    "these coefficients are the same as those found previously by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* zhugzhda & dzhalilov ) , which were possible to determine because the exact analytical solution was known .",
    "we use a method developed by @xcite to find the coefficients .",
    "this method is valid at the mode - conversion region , and has the advantage that coefficients may be found even when there is no exact solution .",
    "we shall take advantage of this when we look at the non - isothermal atmosphere in section  [ noniso.sec ] .    from @xcite ,",
    "we can write the wave equations  ( [ wavx.eqn ] ) and  ( [ wavz.eqn ] ) in the general form @xmath42 @xmath43 where @xmath44 and @xmath45 are the main variables , and the conversion and transmission coefficients are given by @xmath46 in order to manipulate equations  ( [ wavx.eqn ] ) and  ( [ wavz.eqn ] ) into the correct format we take fourier components in time , we must then impose the conditions that @xmath24 is small and @xmath38 is large , allowing us to neglect some terms . finally making the transformation @xmath47 and expanding @xmath48 about the mode - conversion region our equations",
    "may be written @xmath49 @xmath50 by comparing these to equations  ( [ cairnsx.eqn ] ) and  ( [ cairnsz.eqn ] ) we may simply write down the conversion and transmission coefficients @xmath51    , telling us how much of the incident wave will be transmitted into the high-@xmath0 plasma .",
    "here @xmath52 , the solid line is that predicted analytically , and the stars are the values calculated from the numerical data . ]    as the amount of transmission is easily calculated from the numerical simulations we may compare this directly to what is predicted analytically by equation  ( [ conv.eqn ] ) .",
    "we did this for various values of @xmath24 and the results are shown in figure  [ iamprat.fig ] where the stars indicate the transmission in the numerical simulations and the solid line is that predicted analytically .",
    "the agreement between the numerical and analytical results is excellent , even when @xmath24 becomes large thus violating our assumptions .",
    "this suggests that the analytical predictions are an excellent tool for quantifying mode conversion .",
    "more information on the analytical techniques may be found in @xcite .",
    "exactly the same analysis may be carried out for a non - isothermal atmosphere , where there is no exact analytical solution .",
    "we choose a @xmath53 curve for the temperature profile , as shown in figure  [ temprof.fig ] , as this mimics the steep temperature gradient of the transition region .",
    "the form of this profile is @xmath54 and @xmath29 is chosen to lie in the centre of the steep gradient at @xmath31 , as indicated by the dashed line .",

    "this equation tells us that to obtain a constant amplitude in the incident and transmitted waves , as we had in the isothermal case , we must make the transformation @xmath59 ( shown in the left - hand plot of figure  [ niso.fig ] ) . note that if we set @xmath60 we revert back to an isothermal atmosphere with the same equations as section  [ iso.sec ] .",

    "we may then follow ( * ? ? ?",
    "* cairns & lashmore - davies ) to find the behaviour around the conversion region , giving exactly the same conversion and transmission coefficients as before .",
    "so varying the temperature profile has no effect on the amount of transmission and conversion as a wave propagates through the mode - conversion region .    as in the isothermal case",
    ", the amount of transmission may be calculated directly from the numerical results , so we compare this to the analytical prediction for various values of @xmath24 .",
    "the agreement between the two is again excellent , as illustrated in the right - hand plot of figure  [ niso.fig ] .",
    "using a combination of analytical techniques and numerical computations we have studied the phenomenon of mode conversion in a simple , one - dimensional model .",
    "more specifically , we have studied the downward propagation of linear waves in a gravitationally stratified atmosphere permeated by a uniform , vertical magnetic field .",
    "these waves propagate from low- to high-@xmath0 plasma , and the mode conversion occurs where the sound and alfvn speeds are equal where @xmath2 .",
    "in section  [ iso.sec ] we concentrated on an isothermal atmosphere using a combination of the wkb method , and a method developed by ( * ? ? ? * cairns & lashmore - davies ) to examine mode conversion both outside and around the conversion region .",
    "this allowed conversion and transmission coefficients to be found .",
    "it was then possible to compare the transmission predicted by the analytical method with the numerical data .",
    "these showed excellent agreement , even as @xmath24 becomes large , violating the assumptions .",
    "this analysis was repeated in section  [ noniso.sec ] for a non - isothermal atmosphere .",
    "we selected a @xmath53 temperature profile to mimic the steep temperature gradient of the transition region .",
    "surprisingly the transmission and conversion coefficients found were identical to those for the isothermal atmosphere .",
    "so the temperature profile has no effect on the amount of transmission and conversion as a wave undergoes mode conversion .",

    "we plan to use this knowledge to look at a more realistic model of a two - dimensional coronal null point , extending on work done by @xcite .",
    "in this situation the plasma @xmath0 is infinite at the null point , so as the wave propagates towards the null it will indeed be passing from low- to high-@xmath0 plasma , as we have examined here .",
