    "interleavers play an important role in digital communications over fading channels .",
    "they are also a key component of turbo codes @xcite@xcite@xcite .",
    "a key characteristic of an interleaver is its spread .",
    "the notion of spread was initially introduced in @xcite to take into account the short cycles @xcite@xcite which occur when two bits that are initially close to each other , remain close after interleaving .",
    "spread has been redefined in @xcite in the following way .",
    "say , @xmath3 is a permutation on the set \\{0,1,2 .... ,n-1}. the spread @xmath1 of an interleaver is defined as , @xmath4 where @xmath5    it is known that the maximum possible spread for an interleaver with blocklength @xmath6 is @xmath7 @xcite@xcite@xcite . this paper seeks to address the question that if we randomly pick up an interleaver from the set of @xmath8 possible interleavers , what is the probability that the spread of the interleaver is @xmath1 , where @xmath9 .",
    "we determine this probability for @xmath10 while for other values of @xmath1 we determine a lower bound on the probability that the spread is at least @xmath1 .",
    "we further determine this probability for the limiting case when the blocklength approaches infinity . using these results it has been possible to determine a lower bound on the number of interleavers having a spread at least @xmath1 for a given blocklength .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , a combinatorial analysis is done with the help of @xcite to find out the number of interleavers with spread two .",
    "the probability of a random interleaver having a spread two is also derived . in sections",
    "iii and iv , a probabilistic analysis has been done to determine a lower bound on the probability that a randomly chosen interleaver will have spread at least s. we conclude the paper in section v.",
    "an interleaver will have a spread of 2 if at least one pair of consecutive positions remains neighbors after interleaving .",
    "we will consider n-1 and 0 as consecutive integers because according to the distance measure specified by ( 2 ) , the distance between them is 1 .",
    "it is clear that the minimum spread of an interleaver is 2 .",
    "clockwise and counterclockwise @xmath11-sequences have been defined in @xcite .",
    "clockwise @xmath11-sequences mean sequences such as @xmath12 etc .",
    "while counterclockwise @xmath11-sequences mean sequences such as @xmath13 etc . the event of a permutation having spread more than 2 can be identified with the event of a permutation without any clockwise or counterclockwise 2-sequence .",
    "the number of permutations without any clockwise or counterclockwise @xmath11-sequences , @xmath14 is also given in @xcite .",
    "we can find out the number of permutations without any clockwise or counterclockwise 2-sequences from that : @xmath15 thus @xmath16 is the number of interleavers of blocklength @xmath6 with spread more than 2 .",
    "a total of @xmath8 interleavers are there .",
    "say , @xmath17 is the number of interleavers of blocklength @xmath6 with spread @xmath1 .",
    "so the number of interleaver with spread equal to 2 is given by , @xmath18 from ( 3 ) , the probability that a randomly chosen interleaver will have spread more than 2 is given by , @xmath19 now consider the case when @xmath20 : @xmath21   \\nonumber\\\\ & = & 1 + ( -1)^{i}\\sum_{a=1}^{i}\\frac{2^{a}}{a ! } { { i-1}\\choose{a-1}}\\nonumber\\\\ & & .\\lim_{n\\rightarrow \\infty}\\left [ \\frac{n}{n - i}.\\frac{(n - i)!}{(n - i - a)!}\\right .\\nonumber\\\\ & & .\\left .\\frac{(n - i)!}{n!}\\right ] \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    for @xmath22 the degree of n in each term inside the limit in ( 6 ) is negative and these terms go to zero as @xmath20 .",
    "the term with @xmath23 goes to 1 as @xmath20 .",
    "so , from ( 6 ) as @xmath20 , @xmath24    so , as @xmath25 .",
    "thus it is fair to state that if we randomly pick an interleaver it is very likely that it will have spread 2 . at the same time",
    "finding an interleaver with spread more than 2 is not very hard . in every @xmath26",
    "random interleavers , there is likely to be one with spread more than 2 .",
    "note that here we are considering large blocklengths . for finite blocklengths the probability that an interleaver will have spread",
    "more than 2 is lesser .",
    "the plot of ( 6 ) is shown in fig .",
    "[ label2 ] ( the upper curve ) .",
    "it shows that the probability , that an interleaver will have spread more than 2 gets very close to @xmath27 for blocklengths as small as 100 .",

    "let @xmath30 be the event that for any fixed @xmath31 @xmath32 it is clear that @xmath33        it was proved in @xcite that for finite blocklength @xmath6 spread is upper bounded by @xmath7 .",
    "let us denote the maximum value of spread for blocklength @xmath6 as @xmath34 .",
    "now , @xmath35 only if @xmath36 , otherwise @xmath37 .",
    "let us take any @xmath31 .",
    "@xmath38 will be equal to @xmath39 with probability @xmath40 .",
    "let us take the case where @xmath41 .",
    "now the interleaver @xmath3 will have spread more than @xmath1 if    @xmath42    let us call the above event @xmath43 .",
    "clearly @xmath44    as mentioned earlier @xmath45 and @xmath46 are considered as neighbors and hence the entire arrangement of 0, ... n-1 can be thought of as having a circular structure .",
    "so whatever may be the value of @xmath31 or @xmath39 ( even if they are near @xmath45 or @xmath46 ) the event @xmath43 will have the same probability . for the purpose of convenience in illustration we have taken @xmath31 and @xmath39 sufficiently away from @xmath45 or @xmath46 in fig .",
    "[ label_name ] .",
    "[ label_name ] shows the conditions for which the event @xmath43 will be true .",
    "if @xmath47 then to have spread at least @xmath1 , @xmath48 should not belong to the integer interval from @xmath49 to @xmath50 , @xmath51 should not belong to the integer interval from @xmath52 to @xmath53 , and so on , as shown in fig .",
    "[ label_name ] .",
    "say an integer interval from @xmath54 to @xmath55 is written as @xmath56 . then , as explained in fig .",
    "[ label_name ] , the event @xmath43 will be true if @xmath57    for a fixed @xmath58 , let us call the event of ( 13 ) as @xmath59 .",
    "it is clear that , @xmath60     will be true . here",
    "so the conditions should ensure @xmath61 , width=336 ]    now , @xmath62\\nonumber\\\\ & & \\bigcap[\\pi(i - m)\\notin \\{k - s+m+1,k+s - m-1\\ } ] )   \\nonumber\\\\ & = & p(\\pi(i+m)\\notin \\{k - s+m+1,k+s - m-1\\ } ) \\nonumber\\\\ & & .p([\\pi(i - m)\\notin \\{k - s+m+1,k+s - m-1\\}]\\nonumber\\\\ & & |[\\pi(i+m)\\notin \\{k - s+m+1,k+s - m-1\\ } ] )   \\nonumber\\\\ & = & \\frac{n+1 - 2(s - m)}{n-1}.\\frac{n+1 - 2(s - m)-1}{n-2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    in a similar way , we can find out the conditional probability @xmath63 .",
    "it will be similar to ( 15 ) , but as @xmath64 points are already occupied because of @xmath65 given , @xmath64 should be subtracted from the numerators and denominators of both fractions of ( 15 ) , i.e. , @xmath66    from ( 14 ) , @xmath67 @xmath68    we see that the right hand sides of ( 14 ) , ( 16 ) and ( 18 ) are all independent of @xmath39 , because whatever may be the value of @xmath38 , the probabilities are same .",
    "now , from ( 12 ) , @xmath69    so , as expected @xmath70 is same for all @xmath31 s .",
    "we can write ( 10 ) as , @xmath71    if @xmath72 then at least for some @xmath73 .",
    "but if interleaver with spread @xmath1 exists , then it can be argued that the conditional probability of @xmath74 , if @xmath30 is true for @xmath75 , is larger than or equal to the unconditional probability of @xmath74 .",
    "hence , @xmath76    thus we get the following inequality from ( 20 ) and ( 21 ) , for @xmath36 : @xmath77^{n } \\leq p(a_{s } ) \\\\%\\leq p(a_{is})\\\\ & \\mbox{or}&\\left [ \\frac{(n-2s+3)^{s-1}.(n-2s+2)^{s-1}}{(n-1).(n-2) ... (n-2(s-1))}\\right ] ^{n } \\leq p(a_{s})\\nonumber\\\\ \\quad % & &   \\leq \\frac{(n-2s+3)^{s-1}.(n-2s+2)^{s-1}}{(n-1)(n-2) ... (n-2(s-1))}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    this completes the proof of the theorem .",
    "if the event @xmath30 is true for @xmath78 and @xmath79 , then @xmath30 will be true for @xmath80 as well .",
    "so to have the event @xmath29 , we need @xmath30 to be satisfied for all @xmath31 s except every @xmath81 , because they will be then be automatically satisfied . using this observation",
    "we now tighten the bound given in ( 8) . thus ( 20 ) can be written as , @xmath82    where @xmath39 is an integer such that @xmath83 but @xmath84 . in the last @xmath85 terms of ( 24 )",
    "the probability of each @xmath81 element satisfying @xmath30 is expressed given all other elements satisfying @xmath30 .",
    "clearly each of these will be equal to unity .",
    "so ( 24 ) is simplified to @xmath86    using an argument similar to ( 21 ) , and the fact that there are @xmath87 terms to be multiplied in ( 25 ) , we get for @xmath36 :    @xmath77^{n-\\lfloor{\\frac{n}{s-1}}\\rfloor } \\leq p(a_{s})\\nonumber\\\\ & \\mbox{or}&\\left [ \\frac{(n-2s+3)^{s-1}.(n-2s+2)^{s-1}}{(n-1)(n-2) ... (n-2(s-1))}\\right ] ^{n-\\lfloor{\\frac{n}{s-1}}\\rfloor}\\nonumber\\\\ & & \\leq p(a_{s } ) % \\quad\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    which is tighter than ( 8) .",
    "if we multiply the left hand side of ( 26 ) with @xmath8 we will get a lower bound on the number of interleavers with spread at least @xmath1 .",
    "@xmath88^{n-\\lfloor{\\frac{n}{s-1}}\\rfloor}\\nonumber\\\\ \\quad\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] expanding ( 26 ) and writing it as a product of @xmath89 fractions we get,@xmath90^{n-\\lfloor{\\frac{n}{s-1}}\\rfloor}\\nonumber\\\\ & = & ( 1-\\frac{2s-4}{n-1})^{n-\\lfloor{\\frac{n}{s-1}}\\rfloor} ...",
    "(1-\\frac{s-2}{n - s+1})^{n-\\lfloor{\\frac{n}{s-1}}\\rfloor}\\nonumber\\\\ & & ( 1-\\frac{s-2}{n - s})^{n-\\lfloor{\\frac{n}{s-1}}\\rfloor} ... 1    \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] to check what the bound turns out for large @xmath6 , we take @xmath91 . using the result @xmath92 we get @xmath93\\frac{s-2}{s-1 } } ] \\nonumber\\\\ & = & e^{-2(s-2)^{2}}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    thus the probability of a randomly chosen interleaver having spread more than 2 ( at least 3 ) for large blocklengths is lower bounded by @xmath94 , from ( 30 ) .",
    "this bound exactly matches the result in ( 7 ) .",
    "the bound in ( 26 ) is plotted in fig .",
    "[ label2 ] ( the lower curve ) for @xmath95 .",
    "we can see from the figure that the tightness of the bound in ( 26 ) for @xmath95 , improves as blocklength increases . in the plot of the bound in fig .",
    "[ label2 ] , the ripples come because of the floor function in the expression of ( 26 ) .",
    "it can be noticed that these ripples gradually decrease as the blocklength increases .",
    "we have plotted the probability bounds of ( 26 ) as a function of @xmath6 in fig .",
    "[ fig_sim ] .",
    "it can be seen that the ripples which were prominent in the plot of the bound for @xmath95 in fig .",
    "[ label2 ] , are present in these plots also , but they are barely visible . we observe that each curve initially rises but then very quickly becomes almost horizontal indicating convergence to a limiting value . further , as expected the curves for higher values of @xmath1 are much below the curves for smaller value of @xmath1 .",
    "the extremely small values of the probabilities need not necessarily mean that the number of interleavers with high spread is negligibly small because a lower bound on the number of interleavers is obtained by multiplying these probabilities by @xmath8 .    the lower bounds of ( 26 ) are plotted in fig .",
    "[ label3 ] as functions of @xmath1 for blocklengths 256 , 1024 and 4096 .",
    "we can see that the bounds for different blocklengths are quite close to each other .",
    "there is very little separation between the curves for @xmath96 and @xmath97 .",
    "so for large blocklengths these bounds are almost independent of blocklength . from the values in the plots",
    "it is clear that if we randomly pick up interleavers , it is difficult to find an interleaver with high spread as the size of the search space needed to guarantee this is very large ( search space size has the order @xmath98 ) . for blocklengths larger than 1000 , approximately @xmath99 interleavers have spread 2 .",
    "at least @xmath100 interleavers have spread more than 2 , at least @xmath101 interleavers have spread more than 3 and at least @xmath102 have spread more than 4 . for large blocklengths , the fraction of interleavers with spread more than @xmath1 decays as fast as @xmath2 .",
    "thus , it is fair to state that the expected spread of a random interleaver is a little more than 2 .",
    "we have addressed the problem of determining the number of interleavers of a given blocklength @xmath6 that will have spread @xmath1 .",
    "it has been possible to determine the exact expression for this number when @xmath1 is equal to two . for other values of @xmath1",
    "lower bounds have been obtained on the number of interleavers having spread at least @xmath1 .",
    "the probability that a randomly chosen interleaver will have spread two , converges quickly to @xmath103 , as blocklength increases .",
