    "the scattering of electrons on hydrogen atom is a fundamental three - body problem in atomic physics .",
    "the long - range coulomb interaction presents the major difficulty . on the other hand",
    ", it is a special kind of coulomb three - body problem as it contains two identical particles . while many studies have been carried out aiming at solving the schrdinger equation using perturbative , close - coupling , variational or direct numerical methods approaches along to the faddeev equations are relatively scarce . here , by solving faddeev - type integral equations , we present a general numerical method suitable for the treatment of elastic and inelastic processes in three - body coulombic systems with two identical particles and apply the formalism for the electron - hydrogen system .    for quantum mechanical three - body systems the faddeev integral equations are the fundamental equations .",
    "they possess connected kernels and therefore they are fredholm - type integral equations of second kind .",
    "the faddeev equations were derived for short range interactions and if we simply plug - in a coulomb - like potential they become singular .",
    "the necessary modification were proposed by merkuriev @xcite . in merkuriev",
    "s approach the coulomb interactions were split into short - range and long - range parts .",
    "the long - range parts were included into the , , free ",
    "green s operators and the faddeev procedure were performed only with the short - range potentials .",
    "the corresponding modified faddeev , or faddeev - merkuriev equations are mathematically well - behaved .",
    "they possess compact kernels even in the case of attractive coulombic interactions .",
    "this means that the faddeev - merkuriev equations possess all the nice properties of the original faddeev equations .",
    "however , the associated three - body coulomb green s operator is not known explicitly . to circumvent the problem the integral equations were cast into differential form and",
    "the appropriate boundary conditions were derived from the asymptotic analysis of the three - body coulomb green s operator .",
    "these modified faddeev differential equations were successfully solved for various atomic three - body problems , including electron - hydrogen scattering up to the @xmath3 threshold @xcite .",
    "a characteristic property of the atomic three body systems is that , due to attractive coulomb interactions , they have infinitely many two - body channels .",
    "if the total energy of the system increases more and more channels open up .",
    "the differential equation approach needs boundary conditions for each channels , and becomes intractable if the energy increases beyond a limit .",
    "integral equations do not need boundary conditions , this information is incorporated in the green s operators .",
    "they need initial conditions , which are much simpler .",
    "therefore an integral equation approach to the three - body coulomb problem would be very useful , it could provide an unified description of the scattering and reactions processes for all energies .    in the past few years",
    "we have developed a new approach to the three - body coulomb problem .",
    "faddeev - type integral equations were solved by using the coulomb - sturmian separable expansion method .",
    "the approach was developed first for solving the nuclear three - body scattering problem with repulsive coulomb interactions @xcite , which has been adapted recently for atomic systems with attractive coulomb interactions @xcite .",
    "the basic concept in this method is a , , three - potential  picture , where the @xmath0 matrix is given in three terms . in this approach",
    "we solve the faddeev - merkuriev integral equations such that the associated three - body coulomb green s operator is calculated by an independent lippmann - schwinger - type integral equation .",
    "this lippmann - schwinger integral equation contains the channel - distorted coulomb green s operator , which can be calculated as a contour integral of two - body coulomb green s operators .",
    "the method were tested in positron - hydrogen scattering for energies up to the @xmath4 gap @xcite , and good agreements with the configuration - space solution of the faddeev - merkuriev equations were found .    in this paper",
    "we apply this formalism for the electron - hydrogen scattering problem . in sec .",
    "i we briefly describe the faddeev - merkuriev integral equations , the details are given in ref .",
    "however , the fact that in the electron - hydrogen system we have to deal with identical particles requires some additional considerations : the symmetry simplifies the numerical procedure . in sec .",
    "ii the integral equations are solved by the coulomb - sturmian separable expansion method . in sec .",
    "iii we show some test calculations up to the @xmath2 threshold with total angular momenta @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "finally , we draw some conclusions .",
    "in the @xmath7 system the two electrons are identical . let us denote them by @xmath8 and @xmath9 , and the non - identical proton by @xmath10 .",
    "the hamiltonian is given by @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the three - body kinetic energy operator and @xmath13 denotes the coulomb interaction in the subsystem @xmath14 .",
    "we use the usual configuration - space jacobi coordinates @xmath15 and @xmath16 , where @xmath15 is the coordinate between the pair @xmath17 and @xmath16 is the coordinate between the particle @xmath14 and the center of mass of the pair @xmath17 .",
    "thus the potential @xmath13 , the interaction of the pair @xmath17 , appears as @xmath18 .",
    "the hamiltonian ( [ h ] ) is defined in the three - body hilbert space .",
    "so , the two - body potential operators are formally embedded in the three - body hilbert space , @xmath19 where @xmath20 is a unit operator in the two - body hilbert space associated with the @xmath21 coordinate .",
    "the role of a coulomb potential in a three - body system is twofold . in one hand",
    ", it acts like a long - range potential since it modifies the asymptotic motion . on the other hand , however , it acts like a short - range potential , since it correlates strongly the particles and may support bound states .",
    "merkuriev introduced a separation of the three - body configuration space into different asymptotic regions @xcite .",
    "the two - body asymptotic region @xmath22 is defined as a part of the three - body configuration space where the conditions @xmath23 with @xmath24 and @xmath25 , are satisfied .",
    "merkuriev proposed to split the coulomb interaction in the three - body configuration space into short - range and long - range terms @xmath26 where the superscripts @xmath27 and @xmath28 indicate the short- and long - range attributes , respectively .",
    "the splitting is carried out with the help of a splitting function @xmath29 ,    @xmath30 . \\label{potl}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the function @xmath29 vanishes asymptotically within the three - body sector , where @xmath31 , and approaches one in the two - body asymptotic region @xmath22 , where @xmath32 . consequently in the three - body sector @xmath33 vanishes and @xmath34 approaches @xmath35 . in practice",
    "usually the functional form @xmath36 \\right\\ } , \\label{oma1}\\ ] ] is used .    in the hamiltonian ( [ h ] )",
    "the coulomb potential @xmath37 , the interaction between the two electrons , is repulsive , and does not support bound states .",
    "consequently , there are no two - body channels associated with this fragmentation .",
    "therefore the entire @xmath37 can be considered as long - range potential .",
    "then , the long - range hamiltonian is defined as @xmath38 and the three - body hamiltonian takes the form @xmath39 so , the hamiltonian ( [ hll ] ) appears formally as a three - body hamiltonian with two short - range potentials .",
    "the bound - state wave function @xmath40 satisfies the homogeneous lippmann - schwinger integral equation @xmath41 |\\psi\\rangle =   g^{(l ) }   v_1^{(s ) } |\\psi\\rangle +   g^{(l ) }   v_2^{(s ) } |\\psi\\rangle , \\label{psi}\\ ] ] where @xmath42 is the resolvent operator of @xmath43 .",
    "this induce , in the spirit of the faddeev procedure , the splitting of the wave function @xmath44 into two components @xmath45 where the components are defined by @xmath46 with @xmath47 .",
    "the components satisfy the set of two - component faddeev - merkuriev integral equations    [ fm2comp ] @xmath48    where @xmath49 is the resolvent operator of the channel coulomb hamiltonian @xmath50 and the inhomogeneous term @xmath51 is an eigenstate of @xmath52 .    before going",
    "further let us examine the spectral properties of the hamiltonian @xmath53 it obviously supports infinitely many two - body channels associated with the bound states of the attractive coulomb potential @xmath54 .",
    "the potential @xmath37 is repulsive and does not have bound states .",
    "the three - body potential @xmath55 is attractive and constructed such that @xmath56 if @xmath57 . therefore , there are no two - body channels associated with fragmentations @xmath9 and @xmath10 , the hamiltonian @xmath58 has only @xmath8-type two - body asymptotic channels .",
    "consequently , the corresponding @xmath59 green s operator , acting on the latexmath:[$v_1^{(s ) }     @xmath8-type two - body asymptotic channels in @xmath61 .",
    "similar analysis is valid also for @xmath62 .",
    "thus , the faddeev - merkuriev procedure results in the separation of the three - body wave function into components such a way that each component has only one type of two - body asymptotic channels .",
    "this is the main advantage of the faddeev equations and , as this analysis shows , this property remains true also for attractive coulomb potentials if the merkuriev splitting is adopted .    in the @xmath63 system the particles",
    "@xmath8 and @xmath9 , the two electrons , are identical and indistinguishable",
    ". therefore , the faddeev components @xmath64 and @xmath65 , in their own natural jacobi coordinates , should have the same functional forms @xmath66 on the other hand , by interchanging the two electrons we have @xmath67 where the operator @xmath68 describes the exchange of particles @xmath8 and @xmath9 , and @xmath69 is the eigenvalue of @xmath68 .",
    "building this information into the formalism results the integral equation @xmath70 .",
    "we notice that so far no approximation has been made , and although this faddeev - merkuriev integral equation has only one component , yet it gives a full account on the asymptotic and symmetry properties of the system .",
    "we solve this integral equation by applying the coulomb  sturmian separable expansion approach .",
    "this approach has been established in a series of papers for two- @xcite and three - body @xcite problems with coulomb - like potentials .",
    "the coulomb - sturmian ( cs ) functions are defined by @xmath71^{1/2 } ( 2br)^{l+1 } \\exp(-b r ) l_n^{2l+1}(2b r ) ,   \\label{basisr}\\ ] ] with @xmath72 and @xmath28 being the radial and orbital angular momentum quantum numbers , respectively , and @xmath73 is the size parameter of the basis .",
    "the cs functions @xmath74 form a biorthonormal discrete basis in the radial two - body hilbert space ; the biorthogonal partner defined by @xmath75 .    since the three - body hilbert space is a direct product of two - body hilbert spaces an appropriate basis is the bipolar basis , which can be defined as the angular momentum coupled direct product of the two - body bases , @xmath76 where",
    "@xmath77 and @xmath78 are associated with the coordinates @xmath15 and @xmath16 , respectively . with this basis",
    "the completeness relation takes the form ( with angular momentum summation implicitly included ) @xmath79 where @xmath80 .",
    "we make the following approximation on the integral equation ( [ fmp ] ) @xmath81 i.e.  the operator @xmath82 is approximated in the three - body hilbert space by a separable form , viz .",
    "@xmath83 where @xmath84 . utilizing the properties of the exchange operator @xmath68 these matrix elements can be written in the form @xmath85 , and can be evaluated numerically by using the transformation of the jacobi coordinates @xcite .",
    "the completeness of the cs basis guarantees the convergence of the method with increasing @xmath86 and angular momentum channels .",
    "now , by applying the bra @xmath87 on eq .",
    "( [ fmpa ] ) from left , the solution of the inhomogeneous faddeev - merkuriev equation turns into the solution of a matrix equation for the component vector @xmath88 @xmath89 where @xmath90 the formal solution of eq .",
    "( [ fn - eq1sm ] ) is given by @xmath91    unfortunately neither @xmath92 nor @xmath93 are known .",
    "they are related to the hamiltonian @xmath58 , which is still a complicated three - body coulomb hamiltonian .",
    "the approximation scheme for @xmath92 and @xmath93 is presented in ref .",
    "starting from the resolvent relation @xmath94 where @xmath95 is the resolvent operator of the hamiltonian @xmath96 and the potential @xmath97 is defined by @xmath98 for the cs matrix elements @xmath99 we get @xmath100 where @xmath101 and @xmath102 these latter matrix elements can again be evaluated numerically .    similarly , also the wave function @xmath103 , a scattering eigenstate of @xmath58 , satisfies the lippmann - schwinger equation @xmath104 where @xmath105 is an eigenstate of @xmath106 .",
    "the solution is given by @xmath107^{-1 } ( \\underline{\\widetilde{g}}_1)^{-1 } \\underline{\\widetilde{\\phi}}_1 , \\label{eqphil}\\ ] ] where @xmath108 .",
    "the three - particle free hamiltonian can be written as a sum of two - particle free hamiltonians @xmath109 consequently the hamiltonian @xmath106 of eq .",
    "( [ htilde ] ) appears as a sum of two two - body hamiltonians acting on different coordinates @xmath110 with @xmath111 and @xmath112 , which , of course , commute .",
    "therefore the eigenstates of @xmath106 , in cs representation , are given by @xmath113 where @xmath114 and @xmath115 are bound and scattering eigenstates of @xmath116 and @xmath117 , respectively .",
    "the cs matrix elements of the two - body bound and scattering states @xmath118 and @xmath119 , respectively , are know analytically from the two - body case @xcite .    the most crucial point in this procedure is the calculation of the matrix elements @xmath120 . the green s operator @xmath95 is a resolvent of the sum of two commuting hamiltonians .",
    "thus , according to the convolution theorem , the three - body green s operator @xmath95 equates to a convolution integral of two - body green s operators , i.e. @xmath121 where @xmath122 and @xmath123 .",
    "the contour @xmath124 should be taken counterclockwise around the singularities of @xmath125 such a way that @xmath126 is analytic on the domain encircled by @xmath124 .    in the time - independent scattering theory",
    "the green s operator has a branch - cut singularity at scattering energies . in our formalism",
    "@xmath127 should be understand as @xmath128 , with @xmath129 , and @xmath130 , since in this work we are considering scattering below the three - body breakup threshold . to examine the analytic structure of the integrand in eq .",
    "( [ contourint ] ) let us take @xmath131 finite .",
    "by doing so , the singularities of @xmath126 and @xmath125 become well separated .",
    "in fact , @xmath125 is a free green s operator with branch - cut on the @xmath132 interval , while @xmath133 is a coulomb green s operator , which , as function of @xmath134 , has a branch - cut on the @xmath135 $ ] interval and infinitely many poles accumulated at @xmath136 .",
    "now , the branch cut of @xmath125 can easily be encircled such that the singularities of @xmath126 lie outside the encircled domain ( fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) . however , this would not be the case in the @xmath137 limit . therefore the contour @xmath124 is deformed analytically such that the upper part descends into the unphysical riemann sheet of @xmath125 , while the lower part of @xmath124 is detoured away from the cut ( fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) .",
    "the contour in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] is achieved by deforming analytically the one in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , but now , even in the @xmath137 limit , the contour in fig .",

    "the matrix elements @xmath120 can be cast into the form @xmath138 where the corresponding cs matrix elements of the two - body green s operators in the integrand are known analytically for all complex energies @xcite .    in the three - potential formalism @xcite the @xmath0 matrix",
    "can be decomposed into three terms .",
    "the first one describes a single channel coulomb scattering , the second one is a multichannel two - body - type scattering due to the potential @xmath139 , and the third one is a genuine three - body scattering . in our @xmath140 case the target is neutral and the first term is absent . for the on - shell @xmath141 matrix",

    "the spin - weighted cross section of the transition @xmath151 is given by @xmath152 where @xmath153 is the bohr radius , @xmath154 is the total angular momentum , @xmath155 is the total spin of the two electrons and @xmath156 is the angular momentum of the target hydrogen atom .",
    "in the numerical calculations we use atomic units ( the mass of the electrons @xmath157 and the mass of the proton @xmath158 ) . in this paper we are concerned with total angular momenta @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "the formula ( [ s3 ] ) gives some hint for the choice of the parameters in the splitting function @xmath29 .",
    "we can expect good convergence if the  size  of @xmath159 corresponds to the  size  of @xmath160 .",
    "therefore we may need to adjust the parameters of the splitting function if we consider more and more open channels .",
    "consequently , we also need to adjust the @xmath73 parameter of the cs basis .",
    "we found that the final results and the rate of the convergence does not depend on the choice of @xmath73 , within a rather broad interval around the optimal value .    having the @xmath141 matrix we can also calculate the @xmath161 matrix",
    ", whose symmetry , which is equivalent to the unitarity of the @xmath0 matrix , provides a delicate and independent test of the method .",
    "we observed that if either the parameters of the splitting function are too far from the optimum or the convergence with the basis is not achieved the @xmath161 matrix fails to be symmetric . in the separable expansion",
    "we take up to @xmath162 bipolar angular momentum channels with cs functions up to @xmath163 .",
    "this requires solution of complex general matrix equations with maximal size of @xmath164 , a problem which can even be handled on a workstation .",
    "we need relatively small basis because in this approach we approximate only short - range type potentials and the correct asymptotic is guaranteed by the green s operators .",
