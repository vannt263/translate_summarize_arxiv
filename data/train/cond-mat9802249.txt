    "<S> , the process is irreversible : it is carried out over a finite time with a finite number of reservoirs , and the system evolves , from @xmath0 to @xmath1 , through a sequence of _ non - equilibrium _ intermediate states .    </S>",
    "<S> the aim of the present paper is a classical , microscopic analysis of such `` clausius - duhem '' processes , explicitly accounting for all degrees of freedom involved . </S>",
    "<S> this analysis will follow a statistical approach : we will consider an _ </S>",
    "<S> ensemble _ of microscopic realizations of the thermodynamic process . </S>",
    "<S> each realization ( described by a trajectory specifying the evolution of all the degrees of freedom which make up the system of interest and reservoirs ) represents a possible `` microscopic history '' , consistent with the macroscopic prescription for carrying out the thermodynamic process .    </S>",
    "<S> a statistical ensemble of realizations implies _ fluctuations _  from one realization to another  of various quantities of physical interest . in taking a microscopic approach , therefore , we will be interested in the statistical _ distribution _ ( over the ensemble of microscopic histories ) of values of quantities such as @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> working with the assumption that the system of interest begins and ends in equilibrium states ( @xmath5 ) , we will construct a quantity whose average , over the ensemble of realizations , _ depends only on those two states _ , and not on the intermediate evolution of the system . </S>",
    "<S> this result , eq.[eq : equal ] below  the central result of this paper  is valid even if the system is driven far from equilibrium at intermediate times . </S>",
    "<S> we will argue that this result can be viewed as the generalization  to irreversible processes  of the well - known identity which relates @xmath6 to an arbitrary _ reversible _ process from @xmath0 to @xmath1 ( eq.[eq : rev ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> as we will show , the central result of this paper allows one to express @xmath6 in terms of an arbitrary _ irreversible _ process from @xmath0 to @xmath1 ( eq.[eq : deltasigirr ] ) . we will also show that eq.[eq : equal ] immediately implies two inequalities which are closely related to the clausius - duhem inequality . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , eq.[eq : probvio ] places a tight upper bound on the frequency with which finite - size violations of the clausius - duhem inequality _ do _ occasionally occur . </S>",
    "<S> we will finally generalize these results to processes in which the system of interest begins and/or ends in nonequilibrium statistical states .    in the spirit ( and level of rigor ) of gibbs@xcite </S>",
    "<S> , we will work with the following quite general picture . </S>",
    "<S> the `` system of interest '' is a closed , finite system with a single external parameter , @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> additionally , we assume the presence of @xmath8 other closed , finite systems , which will play the role of heat reservoirs </S>",
    "<S> . we will refer to these as `` baths '' , and assume that they have been prepared at temperatures @xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> our thermodynamic process then consists of a sequence of steps during which the system of interest is placed in thermal contact with the baths , one at a time , while the value of @xmath7 is varied along a pre - determined path @xmath10 , over a time interval @xmath11 . </S>",
    "<S> let @xmath12 and @xmath13 denote the initial and final parameter values , and let @xmath14 identify the bath with which the system is in contact at time @xmath15 . </S>",
    "<S> the functions @xmath10 and @xmath14 embody the macroscopic instructions ( the `` protocol '' ) which specify the thermodynamic process .    for any parameter value @xmath7 and temperature @xmath16 , there exists an _ </S>",
    "<S> equilibrium state _ @xmath17 of the system of interest , described at the microscopic level by a canonical distribution in the phase space of the system . through most of the paper ( up to eq.[eq : </S>",
    "<S> fed ] ) , we will restrict our attention to processes for which the system begins ( @xmath18 ) and ends ( @xmath19 ) in such equilibrium states , denoted by @xmath20 and @xmath21 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> in other words , we assume that the system of interest is prepared in equilibrium : over the ensemble of realizations , the microscopic initial conditions of the system are distributed canonically ; and that , at the end of the process , the system is once again described ( statistically ) by an equilibrium distribution : the microscopic final conditions of the system of interest are distributed canonically . strictly speaking , </S>",
    "<S> these assumptions are mathematically suspect : there exists ( to my knowledge ) no rigorous proof that a canonical ensemble can be achieved in a finite time , with finite resources . </S>",
    "<S> thus , one can not say with certainty that there exist physically realizable methods for preparing a system in a canonical ensemble ; or that , _ given _ a system initially in equilibrium , there exist processes which carry that system to a different equilibrium state in a finite time . however , it is a widely held prejudice that such processes do exist in nature , and that the canonical ensemble is the appropriate statistical representation for a closed system in thermal equilibrium . </S>",
    "<S> we will therefore adopt the point of view that it is a legitimate exercise to _ assume _ initial and final equilibrium , and to explore the consequences of these ( seemingly reasonable ) assumptions , without concerning ourselves here with the separate problem of establishing the validity of these assumptions from first principles . </S>",
    "<S> later , as mentioned , we will generalize to nonequilibrium initial and final states .    </S>",
    "<S> we assume hamiltonian evolution at the microscopic level . </S>",
    "<S> let @xmath22 denote a point in the phase space of the system of interest  specifying , e.g. , the positions and momenta of all its constituent particles  and let @xmath23 denote a point in the phase space of the @xmath24th bath . </S>",
    "<S> let @xmath25 then specify the instantaneous state of all degrees of freedom involved . </S>",
    "<S> evolution in the full phase space ( @xmath26-space ) is governed by a time - dependent hamiltonian @xmath27 here , @xmath28 is a hamiltonian describing the system of interest , for a parameter value @xmath7 ; @xmath29 is the hamiltonian for the @xmath24th bath ; and @xmath30 couples the system of interest to that bath@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath31 is ( essentially ) the most general classical hamiltonian describing a system of interest , with a specified external - parametric time dependence @xmath10 , coupled to @xmath8 other systems , one at a time . </S>",
    "<S> once the initial conditions are fully specified , hamilton s equations uniquely determine the evolution of all degrees of freedom .    </S>",
    "<S> let us consider a single realization of the thermodynamic process , described by a trajectory @xmath32 evolving under hamilton s equations from some initial conditions @xmath33 , and ending at @xmath34 . </S>",
    "<S> let @xmath35 and @xmath36 denote , respectively , the initial and final internal energies of the system of interest , and let @xmath37 denote the net change in the internal energy of the @xmath24th bath : @xmath38 now define @xmath39 where @xmath40 and @xmath41 are the temperatures corresponding to the initial and final statistical states of the system of interest , and the @xmath42 s are the temperatures at which the baths are prepared . working with units in which boltzmann s constant @xmath43 , let us now compute @xmath44 , where _ angular brackets signify an average over the statistical ensemble of realizations _ , </S>",

    "<S> s theorem , the jacobian @xmath60 .    at this point , </S>",
    "<S> eq.[eq : prequal ] is just a statement about energy exchange among a number of finite , closed systems , one of which has been singled out as being `` of interest '' . its validity does not depend on the relative sizes of these objects . to establish contact with more familiar results , let us now imagine the limiting case in which the heat capacities of the @xmath8 baths become arbitrarily greater than that of the system of interest . </S>",
    "<S> the baths then assume the role of `` infinite '' heat reservoirs , and we can rewrite the term @xmath61 in eq.[eq : sigdef ] as @xmath62 : @xmath63 ( during the time interval over which the system of interest is coupled to the @xmath24th bath , the heat absorbed by the system is equal to the energy lost by that bath , so the value of @xmath64 over that interval of time is simply @xmath65 . ) eq.[eq : prequal ] now becomes : @xmath66\\biggr\\rangle =   \\exp \\biggl[-\\delta\\biggl({f\\over t}\\biggr)\\biggr],\\ ] ] using the shorthand notation @xmath67 and @xmath68 . </S>",
    "<S> this is the central result of this paper . </S>",
    "<S> we add here that a result equivalent to eq.[eq : equal ] has been derived independently by gavin e.  crooks@xcite  using stochastic , markovian dynamics to model the evolution of the system of interest  and that this result has been shown to be closely related to the fluctuation theorem for non - equilibrium steady states.@xcite    since internal energies are quantities associated with specific microscopic states ( i.e.  points in phase space ) , the exact values of @xmath35 , @xmath36 and @xmath69 ) differ from one realization of the thermodynamic process to the next . by contrast , the free energies @xmath53 and @xmath54 are associated with _ </S>",
    "<S> canonical ensembles _ of microstates of the system of interest . </S>",

    "<S> @xmath73 regardless of the path ( through equilibrium state space ) taken from @xmath0 to @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> since eq.[eq : rev ] can be written , at the macroscopic level , as @xmath74 ( because @xmath75 ) , our central result [ @xmath76 may be viewed as the microscopic extension of eq.[eq : rev ] to _ irreversible _ processes . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , and somewhat surprisingly , this result is valid _ regardless of how far the system </S>",
    "<S> is driven away from equilibrium _ between the initial and final times : no matter how violent the process , eq.[eq : equal ] will hold , provided the system begins in @xmath0 and ends in @xmath1 .    </S>",
    "<S> for a given equilibrium state , the microscopic expressions for free energy , average internal energy , and entropy satisfy @xmath77 , where the overbar denotes an equilibrium ( canonical ) average . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the quantity which we have called @xmath78 can be written as : @xmath79 where the second equality follows from our assumptions regarding the initial and final distributions of microstates . combining this with eq.[eq : equal ] </S>",

    "<S> irreversible _  thermodynamic process from @xmath0 to @xmath1 . in principle , by repeatedly measuring @xmath35 , @xmath36 , and @xmath4 for independent realizations of such a process , we can construct the averages appearing in eq.[eq : deltasigirr ] , and therefore compute the value of @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> generally involves averaging over infinitely many finite - time realizations , in contrast to eq.[eq : rev ] , which gives @xmath6 in terms of a single realization of infinite duration . ]    </S>",
    "<S> we now derive , as a byproduct of eq.[eq : equal ] , two inequalities , one old and one new ( eqs.[eq : statcd ] and [ eq : probvio ] below ) , which are closely related to the clausius - duhem inequality . by the convexity of the function @xmath82 , </S>",
    "<S> eq.[eq : equal ] implies @xmath83 once again invoking the identity @xmath77 , along with our assumptions of initial and final equilibria , @xmath84 and @xmath85 , we can rewrite eq.[eq : ineq ] as : @xmath86 this result says , effectively , that the clausius - duhem inequality is satisfied `` on average '' , where the average is taken over an ensemble of microscopic realizations of a given thermodynamic process . </S>",
    "<S> this still leaves open the possibility that there exist individual realizations for which the inequality is violated . </S>",
    "<S> we will now use eq.[eq : equal ] to investigate the frequency of occurrence of such violations .    </S>",
    "<S> macroscopically , the clausius - duhem inequality can be written as @xmath87 , or simply @xmath88 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , thermodynamics tells us that we will `` never '' observe a value of @xmath89 below @xmath90 . to investigate the _ microscopic _ validity of this statement , let @xmath91 denote the distribution of values of @xmath45 corresponding to the statistical ensemble of microscopic realizations of a given thermodynamic process . </S>",
    "<S> then the probability of observing a value of @xmath45 no greater than some fixed value @xmath92 is just : </S>",
    "<S> @xmath93 = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\sigma_0}d\\sigma\\,p(\\sigma)$ ] . </S>",
    "<S> but eq.[eq : equal ] tells us that @xmath94 . when we combine this with the inequality chain @xmath95 and take @xmath96 , where @xmath97 , we obtain @xmath98 \\le \\exp(-\\gamma_0/k_b),\\ ] ] where we have explicitly put in the boltzmann constant @xmath99 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , _ the probability of observing a violation of the clausius - duhem inequality , by an amount no less than @xmath100 , is bounded from above by _ @xmath101 . a macroscopic violation </S>",
    "<S> would be one for which @xmath102 , hence such violations are extremely rare : the clausius - duhem inequality is `` never '' violated by a macroscopic amount  which pertains to a nonequilibrium thermodynamic process  and the einstein - boltzmann expression for microscopic fluctuations of a system in equilibrium ; see e.g.  ref.@xcite , eq.[112.1 ] . ] .    </S>",
    "<S> the previous two paragraphs are by no means intended as a first - principles derivation of the second law , as they assume  reasonably , but without proof  canonical distributions . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , it has long been known ( see , e.g.  ref.@xcite ) that canonical ensembles imply inequalities such as eq.[eq : statcd ] , stating that the second law is not violated `` on average '' . </S>",
    "<S> ( however , i believe that the upper bound given by eq.[eq : probvio ] is a new result . ) </S>",
    "<S> the aim here is rather to reveal the close connection between the central result of this paper ( eq.[eq : equal ] ) and the clausius - duhem inequality .    </S>",
    "<S> while eq.[eq : equal ] is valid for any thermodynamic process which carries a system from @xmath0 to @xmath1 , it is instructive to ponder limiting cases of such processes . </S>",
    "<S> we will now consider three examples , for which we will be able to verify eq.[eq : equal ] directly ( without invoking liouville s theorem ) , by solving explicitly for @xmath45 .    </S>",
    "<S> the first example involves bringing a system  initially at a temperature @xmath40  into contact with a reservoir at temperature @xmath41 , and allowing the system to relax to the temperature of the reservoir . </S>",
    "<S> let us therefore imagine that , at time @xmath18 , we start with the system in the equilibrium state @xmath103 . </S>",
    "<S> then , at @xmath104 ( `` immediately after @xmath18 '' ) , we place the system in thermal contact with a reservoir at temperature @xmath41 , and let the two equilibrate . </S>",
    "<S> we assume the reservoir to have the usual property of `` infinite '' heat capacity , so that the system of interest relaxes to the equilibrium state @xmath105 . in this situation , </S>",
    "<S> we get @xmath106  where the initial and final energies are given by @xmath107 and @xmath108  from which it follows that @xmath109 we now average over realizations by integrating over the distribution of initial conditions to get : @xmath110 \\exp(-\\sigma ) \\\\ & = & { 1\\over z^a } \\int d{\\bf z}^0   \\exp\\biggl[-{h_\\lambda({\\bf z}^0)\\over t^b}\\biggr ] \\\\   & = & { z^b\\over z^a } = \\exp\\biggl[-\\delta \\biggl({f\\over t}\\biggr)\\biggr],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in agreement with eq.[eq : equal ] .    </S>",
    "<S> the second example involves making a sudden change in the value of the external parameter , @xmath111 , and then letting the system ( assumed in contact at all times with a reservoir at temperature @xmath16 ) relax to the equilibrium state corresponding to the new parameter value . </S>",
    "<S> thus , we begin ( @xmath18 ) with the system in equilibrium state @xmath112 , coupled to a reservoir at temperature @xmath16 ; a moment later ( @xmath104 ) , we instantaneously change the parameter value from @xmath113 to @xmath114 , and then we allow the system to relax to the equilibrium state @xmath115 . </S>",
    "<S> the initial energy of the system is given by @xmath116 ; the energy just after @xmath7 is switched to @xmath114 is given by @xmath117 ; and the final energy is @xmath118 . </S>",
    "<S> then @xmath119 , and @xmath120 from which we again get @xmath121 \\exp(-\\sigma ) =   \\exp\\biggl[-\\delta\\biggl({f\\over t}\\biggr)\\biggr].\\ ] ]    the third example combines these two , and gives us a specific prescription for carrying a system from one arbitrary equilibrium state to another . </S>",
    "<S> we start with the system in state @xmath122 . </S>",
    "<S> then we instantaneously switch the parameter value to @xmath114 , after which we place the system in contact with a reservoir at temperature @xmath41 , and allow it to relax to the state @xmath123 . following steps as above , </S>",
    "<S> we get @xmath124 , from which it once more immediately follows that @xmath125 .    in each of these examples , </S>",
    "<S> a convenient cancellation of terms gave us the value of @xmath45 explicitly in terms of known functions of the inital conditions of the system of interest ( @xmath126 ) . </S>",
    "<S> for a more general thermodynamic process , in which more reservoirs are involved and @xmath7 changes at a finite rate , this is not the case ; if we wanted to compute @xmath45 for a realization launched from a known set of initial conditions , we would need to actually integrate the equations of motion ( in the _ full _ phase space ) to get @xmath36 and @xmath4 .    </S>",
    "<S> let us now suppose that we prepare the system in state @xmath112 , and we switch the parameter at an arbitrary _ finite _ rate from @xmath113 to @xmath114 ( driving the system out of equilibrium ) , while keeping the system in thermal contact with a reservoir at temperature @xmath16 ; at the end we hold @xmath7 fixed at @xmath114 and allow the system to relax to @xmath115 . </S>",
    "<S> in this situation , we have @xmath127 where @xmath128 is the external work performed on the system by driving the parameter . </S>",
    "<S> we thus have @xmath129 , and eq.[eq : equal ] reduces to the following relationship between the work performed ( during realizations of this nonequilibrium process ) and the free energy difference @xmath130 : @xmath131 note the conditions for the validity of this result : there is only one heat reservoir and its temperature must equal that at which the system is initially prepared . </S>",
    "<S> eq.[eq : fed ] has recently been derived in a number of ways , and confirmed in numerical experiments@xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> we now generalize our analysis to the situation in which the system of interest begins and ends in nonequilibrium statistical states . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , we might prepare the system by heating it at one end and cooling at another , until a steady - state thermal gradient is acheived . </S>",
    "<S> ( the @xmath8 baths , however , are prepared in equilibrium , as before . ) </S>",
    "<S> whatever the method of preparation , let @xmath132 denote the statistical distribution of initial conditions ( of the system of interest ) achieved by that preparation . </S>",
    "<S> similarly , let @xmath133 denote the distribution of final conditions ; this will of course depend on the sequence of steps defining the thermodynamic process .    as before , </S>",
    "<S> a realization of the process is described by a microscopic trajectory @xmath32 , determined by the initial conditions , @xmath59 . </S>",
    "<S> for a given realization , let us define @xmath134 and let us compute the average of @xmath135 over our ensemble of realizations : @xmath136 \\exp(-\\gamma ) = 1,\\ ] ] following steps like those leading to eq.[eq : prequal ] .    </S>",
    "<S> since we were able to derive eq.[eq : statcd ] from eq.[eq : equal ] , it is natural to wonder whether an interesting inequality can similarly be obtained from eq.[eq : nequal ] . </S>",
    "<S> the convexity of @xmath82 in this case gives us @xmath137 , or @xmath138 now note that @xmath139 $ ] , where the integration is over the phase space of the system of interest , and @xmath140 $ ] represents the statistical ( gibbs ) entropy associated with the initial statistical state of the system . </S>",
    "<S> similarly , @xmath141 $ ] . </S>",
    "<S> eq.[eq : prineqs ] then reads @xmath142 - s_g[\\rho^0 ] \\equiv\\delta s_g.\\ ] ] that is , _ the expectation value of @xmath64 is bounded from above by the net change in the statistical entropy _ , @xmath143 , characterizing the initial and final states of the system of interest . </S>",
    "<S> note that in the case of an isolated system ( no heat baths ) , this inequality reduces to a trivial result , as both sides are identically zero .    </S>",
    "<S> eq.[eq : nneq ] is equivalent to the statement : @xmath144 . </S>",
    "<S> following a line of reasoning like the one leading to eq.[eq : probvio ] , we can use eq.[eq : nequal ] to place an upper bound on the probability of observing a value of @xmath145 no greater than @xmath146 : @xmath147\\le e^{-\\gamma_0/k_b}.\\ ] ] thus , we will `` never '' observe a `` macroscopically negative '' value of @xmath145 . </S>",
