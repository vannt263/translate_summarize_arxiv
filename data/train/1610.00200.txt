    "percolation is a paradigmatic model of statistical mechanics @xcite . despite its simplicity",
    "it is able to capture many features of real world phenomena ranging from coffee brewing to oil industry ( see @xcite for a recent review ) and at the same time it allows for various exact results @xcite .",
    "one of the most remarkable features of percolation is to display phase transition phenomena with nontrivial geometric properties @xcite prototyping in a simplified and essential stripped - to - the - bone setting features found in more sofisticated models .    a significant bulk of the work regarding percolation deals with models where probability of connecting two elements is zero beyond a given range , i.e. short - range ( sr ) models .",
    "the typical sr percolation refers to a non - vanishing probability to connect nearest neighbour elements or sites of a lattice @xcite . in sr",
    "percolation the one - dimensional limit is trivial : if one denotes by @xmath10 the probability to connect with a bond two nearest neighbour sites one immediately sees that in one dimension the critical value @xmath11 equals @xmath12 ( otherwise the two ends of the chain can not be connected ) .",
    "this result parallels the well known results that for classical ising and ` o(n ) ` chains the critical temperature is vanishing for sr interactions @xcite",
    ". however it is well known that adding long - range ( lr ) couplings in the one - dimensional ising model one may have a non vanishing critical temperature @xcite .",
    "therefore in the literature it has been explored the percolation in presence of long - range ( lr ) interactions , for which one expects a percolative transition also in one dimension @xcite .",
    "systems where the elementary constituents affect each other with laws that decay slowly as a function of their mutual distance play a central role in physics including , among others , gravitational systems , unscreened plasmas and ( di)polar systems @xcite .",
    "a typical form of the interaction is @xmath13 , where @xmath1 is the distance between elements or sites of the system having dimension @xmath14 , and @xmath3 quantifies the range of the interactions .",
    "the inclusion of lr interactions into percolation models , with bond probability of the form @xmath13 , proves valuable also for modeling of several phenomena belonging to the wide arena of complex systems , such as disease spreading @xcite , social aggregation @xcite and financial transactions @xcite .",
    "a very interesting example of such studies is provided by epidemic spreading processes @xcite . in the presence of sr infection ,",
    "when no cooperative effects are considered and there is immunization or death after the infection , the epidemic process gives rise to ordinary percolation clusters @xcite .",
    "the generalization to cases where the dynamical process takes place in lattices where at least some of the infections are lr was considered @xcite .",
    "further interest in the study of lr percolation was also triggered by papers giving some more exact results and its realization on finite graphs @xcite .",
    "the consideration of lr systems presents in general many interesting features , with theoretical and numerical challenges . indeed in a renormalization group ( rg ) setting the sr wilson - fisher fixed point can be altered by sufficiently strong lr interactions , leading at criticality to different universality classes .",
    "in particular the effect of lr interactions on a system in @xmath14 dimensions has been related ( even though the mapping should not be exact ) to a system living in an effective dimension @xmath15 .",
    "the existence of such effective dimension relation between lr and sr systems comes from the low energy behavior of the critical propagator for lr interactions .",
    "indeed using the conventional definition that the two point correlation functions at criticality scales as @xmath16 , for a lr interacting system the anomalous dimension correction can be rewritten as @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the result obtained in the mean - field approximation and @xmath19 is the correction due to correlation effects .",
    "the expected anomalous dimension correction @xmath19 was at the center of an long - lasting , intense debate .",
    "classical early - day rg results on the ising model conjectured @xmath20 to be valid at all orders @xcite .",
    "successive investigations complemented this result introducing the threshold value @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the anomalous dimension of a sr model in the same dimension of the lr one under study @xcite . at @xmath23",
    "lr interactions become irrelevant with respect to sr ones @xcite . these results , in agreement with monte carlo findings @xcite , have been questioned by numerical simulations on the two - dimensional lr ising model indicating @xmath24 and @xmath25 @xcite .",
    "we also observe that monte carlo simulations support the presence of sr behaviour into a finite amount of the region @xmath26 for the @xmath27 percolation @xcite , in agreement with the sak s result @xcite .",
    "however recently presented results for susceptible - infected - removed epidemic processes with lr infection on a two - dimensional lattice appear to be in contraddiction with the sak estimate for @xmath28 , pointing out to the possibility that at least some of the critical exponents are different for all @xmath26 from those of ordinary sr percolation @xcite .",
    "these results eventually led to several numerical and analytic investigations over lr spin models .",
    "however up to date numerical simulations on the two - dimensional lr ising model confirmed the traditional scenario with @xmath20 and @xmath21 @xcite , also indicating an extremely slow convergence as a function of the system size for the critical amplitude of the standard binder ratio of magnetization .",
    "logarithmic corrections at the boundary value @xmath28 are a possible source of error in numerical approaches .",
    "the occurrence of such logarithmic corrections at the threshold value @xmath28 were confirmed by analytical results , which also indicated the results @xmath20 and @xmath21 @xcite .",
    "numerical results for the two - dimensional lr percolation were presented in @xcite .",
    "the conformal invariance at criticality of the two - dimensional lr ising model @xcite and in quantum lr chains @xcite has been as well recently addressed . moreover using both scaling arguments @xcite and functional rg techniques @xcite",
    "the results for the critical exponents of a lr interacting model in dimension @xmath14 with decay exponent @xmath3 were related to the ones of a sr model in dimension @xmath29 .",
    "such effective dimension relation was discussed in @xcite , finding very good agreement with numerical monte carlo results .",
    "one can also see that the effective dimension is valid only at low approximation level in the rg treatment , even though the error introduced by considering it exact has been quantified to be of @xmath30 for the critical exponent @xmath31 for the two - dimensional lr ising models @xcite .",
    "we observe that in one - dimensional lr ising and percolation models sak s results implies @xmath32 ( since @xmath33 ) . a berezinskii - kosterlitz - thouless ( bkt )",
    "transition may be expected at @xmath34 for both one - dimensional ising and percolation models , which has been deeeply investigated in ising chains @xcite and also observed for susceptible - infected - removed epidemic processes with lr infection in one dimension @xcite .    despite the wide appeal of the lr percolation model some important information is still missing .",
    "indeed , for the equilibrium properties , no estimate of the critical threshold and of critical exponents for different values of the decay parameter @xmath3 is available to date , at the best of our knowledge , for the lr one - dimensional percolation .",
    "the goal of the present paper is to give numerical estimates of these quantities . to this aim",
    "we develop a monte carlo algorithm allowig to efficiently simulate one - dimensional lr bond percolation . as a side result we can numerically check the validity of the sak s prediction @xcite for the value of @xmath28 in the one - dimensional lr percolation .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section [ model ] we present the model and briefly remind previous results relevant for our work . in section [ algorithm ]",
    "we present a novel order-@xmath2 algorithm for the study of lr percolation models and discuss its application to a lr version of swendsen - wang algorithm . in sections [ thresholds ] and [ exponents ] we respectively present our findings for the critical thresholds and the critical exponents . in section [ conclusions ] conclusions are drawn .",
    "we will consider a bond percolation model on a one - dimensional lattice having @xmath2 sites with occupation probability @xmath35 of the bond connecting sites @xmath36 and @xmath37 given by ( with @xmath38 ) : @xmath39 where @xmath40 .",
    "see figure [ figg1 ] for a graphical depiction of the model .",
    "when periodic boundary conditions are used , an appropriate periodic distance will be chosen , defined by the minimum distance among periodic images of the sites @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "it is clear that if @xmath41 then the sr bond percolation with a bond probability @xmath10 between nearest neighbour sites is obtained .",
    "notice that in the sr limit it is @xmath42 .",
    "it is known that for the bond probability one has @xmath42 for @xmath43 @xcite .",
    "notice that if @xmath44 decays for large @xmath45 as @xmath46 , then one has @xmath42 for @xmath47 , but it is not necessarily @xmath42 for @xmath34 : in other words , the short distance behaviour of the probability may give rise to a percolation transition also at @xmath34 @xcite .",
    "for future convenience we also mention the exact result by schulman @xcite : comparing the lr percolation model to a related percolation model on the bethe lattice a rigorous lower bound for the critical threshold @xmath11 was obtained @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the riemann zeta function .",
    "the numerical study of percolation has largely benefitted from efficient clustering algorithms .",
    "such algorithms are able to track the cluster to which the local degrees of freedom belong to . since the inception of the efficient hoshen - kopelman @xcite relabeling scheme these algorithms have been brought closer to the optimal rigorous bounds predicted for union and find algorithm class to which they belong .",
    "simulation of lr models has always presented major challenges on its own .",
    "the fact that when we perform a move / update of a system degree of freedom we have to deal with the state of all the other degrees of freedom , unlike sr systems , typically brings the time for a global update of the system from @xmath50 to @xmath51 severely reducing performance .",
    "recent advances in this field has been brought by the introduction of algorithms scaling linearly in the size of the system @xcite .",
    "the efficiency of these algorithms relies upon the fact that only a small fraction of local degrees of freedom are actually interacting .",
    "indeed even if every local variable in principle interacts with all the other degrees of freedom it effectively does it only with a @xmath50 fraction of them ( in the case of non - frustrated interacting systems this condition often translates in the request for an extensive energy ) .",
    "similarly , in our lr percolation model , the number of connected bonds , among the @xmath52 available , is of the order @xmath50 .",
    "more specifically consider the class of bonds of length @xmath53 : the probability @xmath54 of having @xmath55 connected bonds out of the @xmath2 available ( with periodic boundary conditions ) is a binomial @xmath56 which average to @xmath57 .",
    "if we sum all these probabilities we get a total number of connected links , in the thermodynamic limit , of @xmath58 for our model .",
    "the above consideration suggests the structure of an efficient @xmath50 algorithm that is @xcite :    * extract , for each bond length @xmath53 class , the connected bonds according to .",
    "this can be done in a rejection - free fashion by sampling the skip @xmath59 among two connected bonds which turn out to be distributed geometrically @xmath60 .",
    "the number of random numbers to be extracted is on average @xmath61 * turn on the selected bond and cluster the sites according to the new connections .",
    "this can be done in constant time .",
    "note that the speedup can be traced back to having large classes of bonds with the same probability , which is the case for translational invariant systems ( also with open boundary conditions ) .",
    "the above algorithm , albeit its simplicity , has not been discussed nor applied previously in the literature .",
    "another remark is in order : the rejection free extraction of connected bonds plays a central role , since a more naive sampling ( i.e. scanning all the elements ) would spoil the overall order-@xmath2 efficiency .",
    "interestingly this algorithm for lr bond percolation lends itself to effectively implement the swendsen - wang algorithm @xcite in lr ising or similar models . indeed in the swendsen - wang algorithm",
    "@xcite the cluster construction can be dealt with the above scheme .",
    "in contrast to what is usually done one should _ first _ extract a number of tentatively connected bonds of length @xmath53 via our algorithm with the appropriate probability , that is @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the interaction among spins @xmath53 site apart , and _",
    "later _ connect them just if they have the same sign .",
    "the cluster flipping part would be not altered .",
    "this provides an @xmath50 algorithm for lr ising models .",
    "although lr adaptations of swendsen - wang algorithms scaling as @xmath64 @xcite and also @xmath50 @xcite have already appeared in the literature , we believe our formulation to be very coincise and clear since the mentioned algorithms rely on binary search algorithms and walker alias method respectively which , albeit well established , are more complicated to implement .",
    "please notice however that our algorithm is well suited only for translational invariant systems , while other available algorithms , mentioned before , apply also to non translational invariant systems .",
    "our estimates for the critical thresholds and critical exponents are based on a finite size scaling analysis of two quantities : where possible the analysis is done with both .",
    "the first observable we have monitored consists of the average cluster size @xmath65 : @xmath66 this quantity is the analogue of the susceptibility of an ising model in the paramagnetic phase .",
    "indeed it is expected to scale as @xmath67 at the critical point @xcite . since according to scaling relations , @xmath68 and @xmath17 for a lr system",
    ", the scaling of @xmath65 will be used to evaluate the correction @xmath19 to the power law decay of the correlation functions at criticality . in the following",
    "it will be shown that our results are in agreement with the widely accepted result @xmath20 , which , as already mentioned , has been recently confirmed by extensive numerical simulations and theoretical investigations on the lr ising model @xcite .",
    "we have also introduced and studied the ratio : @xmath69 where @xmath70 is the size of cluster @xmath71 , the sum runs over all clusters and the brackets denote average over the different realizations of percolation . @xmath72",
    "measures the spread in the cluster size since when they have a characteristic finite size ( in the non percolating phase ) it tends to zero as we approach the thermodynamic limit ; for @xmath73 , when a macroscopic ( percolating ) cluster develops , the ratio @xmath72 tends to one thus behaving as the binder cumulant @xcite , that is widely used in magnetic systems .",
    "if we had considered the ratio of cluster size moments @xmath74 as in @xcite we would have not observed any crossing @xcite , as insted it occurs for @xmath72 .",
    "moreover since the value of @xmath72 is ruled by the correlation length of the system we can put forward the following scaling form in the vicinity of @xmath11 , for a finite system of size @xmath2 : @xmath75    our numerical investigations showed that from the crossing of @xmath72 it is possible to have a good estimate of the critical thresholds @xmath76 : to substantiate the use of @xmath72 we report in appendix [ cum ] the results for @xmath72 for the two - dimensional sr percolation on a square lattice , showing that the correct result can be retrieved .",
    "regarding the critical exponents , it turns out that using @xmath65 gives good estimates for the critical exponents ( we determined @xmath31 and @xmath9 ) for all the range @xmath5 , while @xmath72 can be used for @xmath3 close to @xmath12 , where by the way it gives more precise estimates than the ones obtained by using @xmath65 . both methods , i.e. using @xmath65 and @xmath72 give results in agreement between each others ( where one obtains reliable findings ) .",
    "finally , we observe that using @xmath72 one can conclude that @xmath42 for @xmath34 while using @xmath65 one numerically confirms that @xmath77 for @xmath78 , as it should be .",
    "the runs have scanned different values of @xmath3 , @xmath2 and @xmath10 .",
    "for each value of the parameters we used @xmath79 different realizations .",
    "the considered size of the system is up to @xmath80 .",
    "the random number generator chosen is the mt19973 @xcite .",
    "the bulk of the experiments have been carried out with open boundary conditions , while for selected values of the decay parameter @xmath3 we have also simulated periodic boundary conditions .",
    "to determine the critical thresholds @xmath81 as a function of @xmath3 we study the quantity @xmath82 which should cross at @xmath11 ( this is consistent with the fact that @xmath83 and therefore @xmath84 , as it will be shown in the next section ) .",
    "indeed as one can see in figure [ fig2 ] the curves for different sizes meet at an almost @xmath2 independent point .",
    "another way to locate the phase transition is to use the cumulant @xmath72 defined in .",
    "the behavior of the ratio @xmath72 as a function of @xmath10 is depicted in the left panel of figure [ fig3 ] for the value of @xmath85 .",
    "increasing the system size @xmath72 approaches a step profile jumping at the critical value of @xmath10 allowing for a precise determination of the critical point @xmath11 . in the right panel of figure [ fig3 ]",
    "we show the same plot for @xmath34 . as we can see the curves , within numerical error ( see inset ) , do not cross for @xmath86 supporting the theoretical prediction that @xmath42 for the threshold value @xmath34 .",
    "both methods devised agree for most values of @xmath3 but the @xmath72 crossing fails for low @xmath3 because the crossing happens in parts of the curve with large curvature ( at the sizes considered ) . for our best estimates of @xmath11 we will then rely on crossings of @xmath82 .     as a function of @xmath10 for @xmath87 .",

    "for the lr percolation model under exam we expect the existence of a sr effective dimension @xmath101 such that the universal quantities of the lr model can be related to the ones of the corresponding sr in @xmath101 dimensions @xcite .",
    "such effective dimension relation reproduces standard scaling arguments and it reproduces correctly the qualitative features of phase diagrams @xcite . also effective dimensional approach are very accurate close to the mean field region even if generally not exact .",
    "we have that for @xmath99 the effective dimension relation is @xmath102 which is the mean - field region for the sr percolation problem @xcite .",
    "moreover , in @xmath103 for @xmath104 we have @xmath105 and the phase transition vanishes .",
    "these results are in agreement with the ones already present in lr percolation literature @xcite .",
    "our numerical results for @xmath106 and @xmath31 as a function of @xmath3 are reported in figures [ fig5 ] and [ fig6 ] respectively .",
    "it is clear that the sak prediction is rather clearly confirmed .",
    "the values of @xmath19 have been obtained by looking for crossing of the curves @xmath107 allowing for a nonzero value of @xmath19 . the best value has been chosen as the one giving the most constant value of the crossing value @xmath10 for the largest sizes @xmath108 considered . since we found values of @xmath19 consistent with zero up to @xmath109 standard deviations we assumed @xmath8 in the subsequent analysis .",
    "our best estimates of @xmath31 ( reported in the third column of table [ tab1 ] ) rely on the behaviour of @xmath110 near @xmath11 .",
    "standard scaling arguments lead us to expect the following scaling : @xmath111 ; the analysis of the data indeed confirms this expectation .",
    "notice that in contrast to the scaling for @xmath72 ( see ) no subleading exponents @xmath112 were required to explain the data .",
    "the region around the value @xmath113 requires a higher number of powers of @xmath114 to be included in the fit in order to keep @xmath115 yielding a higher error on the estimates for @xmath116 .",
    "these data are given in the third column of table [ tab1 ] .",
    "finally an independent estimate of @xmath116 has been calculated via the more involved scaling of @xmath72 ( reported in the fourth column of table [ tab1 ] ) .",
    "the values obtained are reliable only in a small region around @xmath117 but do confirm the values retrieved with the observable @xmath65 .    in order to benchmark our numerical results for @xmath31 it would be useful to have analytical predictions for it .",
    "however rg ( and functional rg ) calculations in lr percolation problems are less straightforward than the corresponding ones in lr ising and ` o(n ) ` models @xcite .",
    "the derivation of perturbative or non - perturbative approximated formulas goes beyond the scope of the present work .",
    "nevertheless , it exists a shorthand to obtain approximated reference results to control the validity of our findings , relying on the effective dimension relation between lr and sr models . indeed scaling arguments used to derive effective dimension relation @xmath101",
    "are based on the field theory description and are thus also valid for the percolation problem @xcite .    in a very recent paper @xcite @xmath6-expansion formulas on @xmath118 theory up to order @xmath119 were derived and numerical estimates for the critical exponents in integer dimensions of sr percolation were given .",
    "we then can use the previously mentioned lr - sr effective dimension relation . according to scaling arguments and low order rg approximations the critical exponents of a lr model in dimension @xmath14 with exponent @xmath3",
    "are related to the ones of a sr model in dimension @xmath120 the latter result was successfully applied in the case of two - dimensional lr ising @xcite and lr ` o(n ) ` models @xcite . in these",
    "works the correlation length exponent @xmath31 of the lr model was compared to the one of a sr model in dimension @xmath101 using the relation @xmath121    however we expect our case to be rather different .",
    "indeed in the two - dimensional case both the lr and sr systems are characterized by a spontaneous symmetry breaking of a @xmath122 symmetry . on the other hand",
    "the one - dimensional lr ising model shows spontaneous symmetry breaking only for @xmath123 , while for @xmath34 it undergoes a topological phase transition of the bkt type @xcite , where kink excitations having logarithmic interactions @xcite play a role similar to the vortices in the standard sr xy model @xcite .",
    "the presence of bkt type phase transition is normally associated with a divergence of the correlation length exponent @xmath31 and then we expect the correlation length exponent of the @xmath103 lr ising model to go to infinity as a function of @xmath3 in the @xmath100 limit , as it happens for the sr ` o(n ) ` models at @xmath124 in the @xmath125 limit @xcite .",
    "this result should not be reproduced by the effective dimension relation since the sr ising model should have finite correlation length exponent in any dimension .",
    "the case of lr percolation in one dimension is analogous to the case of the one - dimensional ising model , indeed the percolation is the @xmath126 limit of the potts model @xcite .",
    "using the results of @xcite in the limit @xmath127 one expects bkt behavior for lr percolation at @xmath34",
    ". then we expect our data to agree with the ones obtained from the sr results via relation only far from @xmath34 and close to the mean - field threshold @xmath128 .",
    "we can then discard anomalous dimension corrections in the sr models and use the simplified mapping @xmath129 with @xmath130 which is the @xmath131 result @xcite .",
    "therefore perturbative expressions for the critical exponents of lr percolation can be obtained imposing the relation between @xmath101 and @xmath6 in the second order @xmath6-expansion formulas obtained in @xcite and contained in @xcite ( notice that in @xcite it is @xmath132 ) . defining @xmath133 , valid in the one - dimensional system , and expanding to second order in @xmath134 we obtain @xmath135 which is plotted in figure [ fig6 ] as a gray line .",
    "moreover in @xcite results for the critical exponents are presented for integer dimensions using a pad approximant of @xmath136 expansion results constrained to reproduce the known exact values of the two - dimensional sr percolation .",
    "interpolating such results a curve @xmath137 for the correlation length exponent of the sr model as a function of the dimension @xmath14 is obtained . this interpolation function",
    "is then transformed according to relation with @xmath138 yielding the results shown in figure [ fig6 ] ( green line ) .",
    "we observe that if we instead use the relations and we obtain practically the same results for @xmath139 and worst results approaching @xmath34 for the reasons explained above , while as expected poor results are obtained if non - resummed series for @xmath31 are used .",
    "a reasonable agreement is found with the numerical results even if it does not match with the numerical errors .",
    "this issue was expected due to the presence of logarithmic corrections at @xmath113 , which have not been included in our scaling assumptions and then lead to lack of accuracy close to the mean - field region .",
    "it is worth noting that logarithmic effects rapidly vanish since for @xmath140 our results coincide with the rg ones , at least for @xmath141 where perturbative expansion is expected to be still reliable .",
    "close to the boundary region @xmath34 we can compare with the results of @xcite which we generalized to the @xmath142 case following the procedure of @xcite .",
    "thus we obtain an analytic result for the correlation length exponent @xmath31 close to the bkt point @xmath34 : @xmath143 where the limit @xmath127 has to be taken .",
