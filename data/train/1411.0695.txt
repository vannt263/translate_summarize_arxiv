    "the appearance of @xmath1 car has evolved rapidly in the past 15 years @xcite .",
    "the primary wind may be returning to its pre - eruption state @xcite , but in any case the spectrum and brightness have changed much faster than before .",
    "extraordinary clues are provided by `` spectroscopic events '' that occur near each periastron passage of the companion star in its 5.5-year orbit ",
    "see many refs .  in @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "the events observed in 1998 , 2003 , and 2009 did not match each other @xcite . here",
    "we report major differences between the 2014.6 event and its predecessors , observed with the space telescope imaging spectrograph ( _ hst_/stis ) .",
    "the 2003.5 and 2009.1 spectroscopic events seemed alike in their early stages , but their x - rays and exotic emission differed after periastron .",
    "broad @xmath04687 emission occurred during the first half of each event @xcite , even though neither star can ionize he@xmath2 enough to produce this recombination line .",
    "martin et al",
    ".   noticed its anti - correlation with the 2 - 10 kev x - rays , and explored relevant physics .",
    "they concluded that a flood of 50 - 700 ev photons arose as the colliding - wind shocks became unstable near periastron , indirectly exciting @xmath04687 .",
    "those soft x - rays carry far more energy flux than the 2 - 10 kev photons , but can not be observed except via @xmath04687 .    in 2009 , unlike 2003 , definite @xmath04687 emission briefly reappeared after periastron .",
    "( concerning the 2003 record , see  5 below . )",
    "the hard x - rays reappeared immediately thereafter , much earlier than in 1998 and 2003 .",
    "most likely , @xmath04687 emission signaled the re - formation of large - scale shock structure which produces hard x - rays .",
    "these and other data appear consistent with lower gas densities in 2009 compared to 2003 @xcite .    thus , a qualitative extrapolation of the 199820032009 data suggested that @xmath1 car s 2014.6 event might have a brighter @xmath04687 `` second flash . '' here we report _",
    "hst_/stis observations which confirm that suspicion .",
    "equally significant , they also reveal unexpected strength in a nearby uv - excited multiplet that was only barely visible in 2003 and 2009 .",
    "_ hst_/stis plays a unique role in our knowledge of @xmath1 car . unlike ground - based spectrographs",
    ", stis can observe the central object without serious contamination by ejecta located 150500 mas from the star @xcite .",
    "it also provides unrivaled data homogeneity over the time period 19982014 , immune to atmospheric effects  though it was not operational during the 2009.1 event .",
    "moreover , stis allows uv coverage .",
    "for all these reasons , _ hst _ data provide necessary anchoring points for ground - based observations ( see  5 below ) .",
    "the stis / ccd observations reported here cover wavelength range 45624841  with a 100 mas slit width and an integration time of 25.5 s on each occasion .",
    "the observing dates in 2014 are listed in table 1 .",
    "the instrument setup was like that described in our earlier papers , especially @xcite .",
    "details can be found in the stsci and @xmath1  car treasury program archives , where the data will become publicly available in 2015 .",
    "additional wavelength ranges will be reported in later papers , but @xmath04687 and the special emission are most critical .",
    "we used the data reduction methods employed by @xcite and @xcite , developed for the hst @xmath1 car treasury project in 20022004  providing better spatial resolution than the standard stsci pipeline @xcite .",
    "they allowed us to extract reliable spectra with spatial widths of 150 mas and slightly unsharp edges to minimize pixelization effects . at @xmath1 car",
    "s distance , 150 mas corresponds to a projected size of about 340 au , larger than the companion star s orbit but small enough to exclude the bright ejecta knots which contaminate all ground - based spectra of this object .",
    "spectral resolution was roughly 40 km s@xmath3 , much narrower than the features discussed below .",
    "since each relevant ccd pixel had many thousands of counts , and each spectral feature included many pixels , statistical errors are negligible compared to systematic errors . with hst",
    "s excellent spatial resolution , systematic effects result mainly from the complexity of @xmath1 car s spectrum , unrelated to the instrument .",
    "regarding `` phase '' in the 5.5-year orbital cycle , we use the definition adopted long ago for the @xmath1 car treasury project : period = 2023.0 days exactly , and phase = 0 at mjd 56883.0 ( 2014 august 14 ) , mjd 54860.0 ( 2009 january 29 ) , etc .",
    "advantages of this system are outlined by @xcite .",
    "we express @xmath4 , time from the nearest zero phase , in days .",
    "the time of periastron is unknown but most likely occurs near @xmath5 d.    quoted wavelengths are in vacuum , and doppler velocities are heliocentric .",
    "these observations were intended to answer two obvious questions : ( 1 ) was there a substantial difference between the 2014.6 and 2009.1 events concerning @xmath04687 ? ( 2 ) if so , was the post - periastron emission stronger in 2014 , extrapolating the 20032009 difference ? both answers prove to be `` yes . ''    for comparison purposes , figure 1 shows typical stis spectra during and after the 2003.5 event , and in september 2013 .",
    "in addition , the bottom panel shows a gemini / gmos observation in 2009 @xcite .",
    "it has better spatial resolution than most other ground - based data , but nevertheless shows major extraneous features due to outlying ejecta .",
    "( compare it to the top panel in fig .  1 and the second panel in fig .  2 , obtained at similar orbital phase .",
    ")    the critical range 46754694  is marked by vertical lines in fig .  1 .",
    "stis sampled this wavelength region on 15 occasions _ outside the spectroscopic events _ from 1998 to 2012 , and none of them showed any sign of the @xmath04687 feature on the star ",
    "see , e.g. , figs .",
    "36 in @xcite .",
    "they resembled 2003.88 in figure 1 and 2014.85 in figure 2 , except that most other emission lines progressively weakened from 2000 to 2012 @xcite .",
    "the 2013.70 spectrum in figure 1 shows two noteworthy departures from the earlier record : a multiplet around 4620  had become conspicuous in absorption (  4 below ) , and a possible weak emission bump can be seen near 4687  .",
    "figure 2 shows our recent stis spectra .",
    "elevated fluxes near 4687   the shaded areas in the figure  occur only during spectroscopic events .",
    "results for the @xmath04687 emission strength appear in figure 3 .",
    "this is a contentious topic , and the chief issue is whether the emission differed substantially between 2014.6 and 2009.1 .",
    "therefore we employ two largely independent measures of the emission strength and they both support the same conclusion .",
    "ew1 samples only the the `` obvious bump '' in the spectrum with a peak near 4687  ( e.g. , top panel in figs .  1 and 2 )",
    "; this is easy to measure but it omits much of the flux .",
    "ew2 includes a larger fraction of the emission but requires an accurate measure of the true continuum .    for ew1",
    "we simply estimate a linear pseudo - continuum based on data within the narrow range 46704700  , and calculate net equivalent width in the usual way .",
    "a dashed line in the top panel of figure 1 shows an example .",
    "ew1 amounts to a lower limit , because its pseudo - continuum level often lies well above the true continuum .",
    "ew1 in the 2009.1 and 2014.6 events is shown in figure 3a , where small data points represent gemini / gmos observations in 2009 @xcite , while heavier black dots are the stis results for 2014 .",
    "limit marks on each stis data point are not standard error bars ; instead they indicate a range of @xmath61.5% in the local pseudo - continuum .",
    "levels outside this range do not appear credible when plotted with the data .",
    "likely errors are difficult to quantify because they are mainly systematic , but the limit marks in fig .",
    "3 might be regarded as informal equivalents to normal 1.5@xmath7 or 2@xmath7 errors .    during the first half of each spectroscopic event , ew1 was noticeably larger in 2014 compared to 2009 ( fig .",
    "but the second half of the event , particularly @xmath8 d , showed a more dramatic difference : the second flash in 2014 was roughly twice as strong as its predecessor in 2009 .",
    "figures 2 and 3b show that ew1 is less than half of the story , because broader emission fills the region around 4687  during an event .",
    "@xcite showed that flux levels near 4605 and 4745  measured @xmath1 car s continuum sufficiently well in the 19982004 stis data . when @xmath04687 was not present ( i.e. , at any time outside an event ) , linear continua @xmath9 fit the 4605 , 4685 , and 4745  levels very well ; e.g. , 2003.88 in fig .  1 .",
    "the apparent slope was small , with @xmath10 .",
    "estimating the continuum in this way , and integrating the emission between 4675 and 4694  , we find a second equivalent width ew2 which is often much larger than ew1 .",
    "@xcite , @xcite , and @xcite used this procedure .",
    "emission outside the 46754694  interval is blended with strong unrelated spectral features .    in 2014 ,",
    "a set of unusual lines disqualified the 4605  window for continuum sampling ( fig .  2 and  4 ) .",
    "we must therefore base the underlying continuum on just the 4745  window plus earlier experience and known features .",
    "since 4687  and 4745  differ by only 1.2% in wavelength , no likely process would alter the continuum ratio @xmath11 by more than a fraction of a percent .",
    "( 4687  is on the insensitive rayleigh - jeans side of @xmath1 car s sed . )",
    "we estimate ew2 values in the following way , favoring slightly higher continuum to avoid exaggerating the 2014.6 event .",
    "first , we assume that @xmath12 is 1% higher than the average of @xmath13 across several  near 4745  .",
    "this correction is motivated by two weak absorption lines near 4750 and 4763  ( see below ) .",
    "then we adopt @xmath14 , integrate @xmath15 from 4675 to 4694  , and calculate equivalent width ew2 accordingly .",
    "very likely the two weak absorption lines depress @xmath12 by less than 1% , and earlier experience suggests that @xmath16 is about 1% less than @xmath12 .",
    "consequently our ew2 values may be roughly 0.3  too low , i.e. , we err on the side of skepticism .    in terms of ew2",
    ", figure 3b shows that _ the second @xmath04687 flash in 2014 was more than twice as strong as in 2009 . _",
    "the small horizontal bar above each data point shows the value if we decrease @xmath16 by 1% , arguably more likely as noted above .",
    "various objections to our measurements can be proposed , but they are weak when examined .",
    "the temporal sampling is adequate to establish the brightening , since all data in 2009 showed a continuous rise and decline through about 45 days .",
    "our 2014 observations sampled the rise , the near - maximum , and the decline , and _ all three _ were much brighter than corresponding phases in 2009 .",
    "( if the true maximum was substantially higher , then the 20092014 increase is even larger than we report . )",
    "we can not prove that extra emission in 46754694  ( shaded in fig .",
    "2 ) was entirely due to ; but _ something _ changed in ew2 between 2009 and 2014 , and it correlated with ew1 which certainly represents emission .",
    "errors in the continuum slope can not be large enough to affect the issue , for physical reasons mentioned above .",
    "no evident process can enhance the continuum in a wavelength range less than 100  wide .",
    "the narrow interval near 4745  is indeed the best continuum sample , because emission and absorption features are known to affect all other wavelengths between 4550 and 4800  during the spectroscopic event .",
    "a thomson - scattered wing of @xmath04714 can not account for much of ew2 , because that would entail a detectable slope in @xmath13 around 4687  ; and , also , the corresponding long - wavelength wing is not strong enough .",
    "altogether , ew2 is well justified and ew1 behaved similarly . conceivably the values for 2009 were severely underestimated because of ground - based defects mentioned above , but that would not explain why the second flash around @xmath17 d changed far more than the first flash around @xmath18 d.    in summary , the combination of ew1 and ew2 in figure 3 establishes a conspicuous difference between the 2014.6 and 2009.1 events",
    ". its physical significance will be noted in  5 and in later papers .",
    "multiplet 5 at 46034644  , barely noticeable in 2009 , became quite conspicuous in 2014 ; compare especially the 2014.57 panel in figure 2 to any spectrum in figure 1 .",
    "this development indicates a strengthened euv radiation field .",
    "the multiplet s _ lower _ level has energy 18.5 ev , far too high for normal thermal excitation .",
    "as explained by @xcite , it is populated in @xmath1 car s primary wind by photons from the hot companion star .",
    "consequently multiplet 5 can scatter ambient radiation , thus producing absorption and/or pseudo - emission lines , depending on viewing direction .    in late 2013",
    "this set of features appeared mainly in absorption ( 2013.70 in fig .  1 ) , but during the 2014.6 event they became mainly emission ( fig .  2 ) .",
    "mehner et al .  sketched the geometrical circumstances in their figure 5 . in late 2013",
    "the secondary star passed between us and the primary , except for the orbit inclination .",
    "thus it excited along our line of sight to the primary wind , causing absorption in multiplet 5 . in mid-2014",
    "the secondary star moved to the far side of the primary , unfavorable for absorption but allowing apparent emission which was really light scattered in gas around the sides of the configuration . by november 2014",
    "the radiative excitation weakened because the size scale had increased .    why were these features strong in 2014 but not in 1998 , 2003 , and 2009 ?",
    "multiplet 5 requires photons with @xmath19 ev to create n@xmath2 , and @xmath20 18.5 ev to excite it .",
    "normally these come from the hot secondary star . during the earlier spectroscopic events ,",
    "its uv was effectively suppressed ( @xcite , and other refs .  in @xcite ) . _",
    "evidently the 2014.6 event was characterized by a stronger euv radiation field , _ presumably from the secondary star .",
    "the velocities vary in much the same way as some other features @xcite .",
    "we do not discuss their kinematics here , because their strength has a more immediate significance as outlined above .",
    "a wealth of evidence affirms the rapid and progressive changes in @xmath1 car since 1998 ; see @xcite and many refs .  therein .",
    "but this development has occasionally been disputed ( e.g.   @xcite ) . for @xmath04687 , @xcite report `` no significant changes between 2009.0 and 2014.6 . ''",
    "figure 3 contradicts that assessment , and the two events differed in other respects concerning the uv radiation field .",
    "the most natural explanation continues to be a progressive decline of the primary wind density , see many references in @xcite and @xcite . since the photosphere is located in the wind , decreasing densities favor smaller photospheric radii , higher radiation temperatures , and higher ionization states .",
    "whatever caused the `` extra emission '' around 4687  ( shaded areas in fig .",
    "2 ) , it manifestly correlates in time and wavelength with the undoubted @xmath04687 feature measured by ew1 . in the absence of any other credible candidate ,",
    "broadened emission is the simplest interpretation and its physics appears reasonable @xcite .",
    "column densities near periastron @xcite are large enough to produce thomson scattering , which broadens some of the @xmath04687 emission but also reflects much of it away from us .",
    "the @xmath04687 minimum around @xmath5 d may conceivably have been a quasi - eclipse by gas near the primary star , and the `` second flash '' may have been stronger in 2014 merely because intervening densities were lower than in 2009 .",
    "quantitative models will require elaborate simulations of colliding - wind shock instability , breakup , and reformation , and there are more adjustable parameters than truly independent observables .",
    "the main point at present is that @xmath1 car s successive spectroscopic events do indeed differ in a progressive way .",
    "subtle effects in ground - based data have occasionally led to misunderstandings .",
    "for example , @xcite stated that weak @xmath04687 persisted between events , with a strength that would have been obvious in the stis data .",
    "in fact this was presumably emission from outlying ejecta at @xmath21 0.3 to 1 arcsec , as explained in  4.2 of @xcite and  6.3 of @xcite .",
    "teodoro et al .   also stated that a second @xmath04687 flash occurred in 2003 , based on two or three instances of ew2 @xmath22 0.6  from a relatively modest instrument . between those observations",
    ", however , stis showed ew2 @xmath23 0.2  at @xmath4 = + 15 d. teodoro et al .  speculated that this was a `` bad datum , '' which is highly unlikely in view of the proven nature of the instrument and the multiple consistency of fig .  5 in @xcite .",
    "since stis was the more capable instrument , and hard x - rays did not reappear soon after that time , most likely there was no strong @xmath04687 flash near @xmath24 d in 2003 .",
    "we mention these examples because they illustrate why _ excellent data with high spatial resolution are essential for this problem . _",
    "the bottom panel in our figure 1 , and also figure 2 in @xcite , show that even the best ground - based spectra of @xmath1 car have obvious contamination by outlying narrow - line ejecta .",
    "( compare them to the stis spectra . )",
    "data obtained with wider slits or inferior atmospheric conditions may be appreciably worse ; and the relative brightness of the ejecta is changing with time @xcite . the extraneous features cast doubt on continuum estimates and other sensitive measures that rely only on ground - based data .",
    "stis , by contrast , has far better spatial resolution , excellent s / n , and good long - term stability ; see especially  4.2 in @xcite . moreover , its data are publicly available .",
    "multiplet 5 samples different physical parameters than either the helium lines or the low - excitation features .",
    "it depends mainly on euv photons with energies between 14 and 20 ev , supplied by the hot companion star @xcite . at most times",
    "the secondary star has @xmath25 k , producing copious radiation at 1420 ev @xcite .",
    "the features arise in relatively normal parts of the primary wind , not the shocked regions .",
    "their prominence in 2014 implies a substantial euv radiation field .",
    "traditionally , @xmath1 car s spectroscopic events were defined by a temporary lack of ionizing uv @xcite . either ( 1 ) the hot secondary star moved inside the diffuse primary photosphere , and/or ( 2 ) it accreted primary - wind material near periastron , thereby reducing its @xmath26 @xcite . both of these possibilities require ambient densities above some critical level",
    ". therefore , the unpredicted strength of multiplet 5 in 2014 strongly suggests that gas densities were lower than they were in previous events , consistent with a progressively decreasing primary wind ( @xcite and refs .",
    "therein ) . in any case it signals another physical difference between the 2014.6 event and its predecessors .      _",
