    "galaxies are gravitationally bound systems of stars , gas , and dark matter .",
    "the interaction and evolution of these mass components results in a change of the observable properties of the galaxy as a whole .",
    "an understanding of the processes governing galaxy formation and evolution is still a major challenge to astronomers .",
    "the goal is to quantitatively define the relationships between galactic - scale star formation activity and the properties of the inter - stellar medium ( ism ) ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "current observing facilities allow for high - quality multi - wavelength observations of comparable resolution and sensitivity to be carried out for nearby galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "these observations are used to test current theories of galactic - scale star formation .",
    "the cold gas component of a galaxy is its fuel for star formation . on global as well as localised",
    "length scales the distribution of these mass components is known to correlate with the star formation activity @xcite .",
    "in addition to the distribution of the gas , it is also the kinematics that play a role in regulating the star formation activity .",
    "for example , while self - gravity drives gas perturbations to collapse under mutual gravity , the centrifugal forces associated with their rotational motions will impede the structure growth by counteracting the inward gravitational force @xcite . similarly , rotational shear will tear adjacent gas clouds apart before they have the chance to coalesce to form a single denser body of gas @xcite .",
    "the self - gravity of a galaxy s ism is determined by the gravitational potential of its mass components .",
    "the stellar potential , for example , contributes to the self - gravity of the gas , thereby making it more susceptible to gravitational collapse and hence star formation ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "star formation models are used to understand how all of these processes work _ together _ to control the star formation in galaxies .",
    "both the ability and inability of these models to accurately describe the star - formation contributes to a further understanding of the complex interplay between the various ism properties that regulate the star formation activity . in order to compare modelling results to observations , a quantitative measure of a galaxy s star formation activity",
    "is required .",
    "one of the most widely used tracers of high - mass star formation is the  emission line arising from the recombination of ionised hydrogen .",
    "this traces a galaxy s star formation over the relatively short lifetimes ( a few million years ) of the most massive stars . in recent years",
    ", galex observations of nearby galaxies have allowed the ultra - violet  ( uv ) flux originating from the photospheres of high - mass o- and b - type stars to be used as a diagnostic of the directly observable star formation rate ( sfr ) . as @xcite point out , a galaxy s uv flux probes a fuller mass spectrum of massive stars , and thus measures star formation averaged over a longer @xmath0  yr time - scale .",
    "the uv emission alone is , however , an insufficient tracer of the sfr . several authors ( e.g.  @xcite and references therein ) have compared  and uv sfrs for nearby galaxies .",
    "the general consensus is that uv sfrs tend to be slightly lower than  sfrs .",
    "the discrepancy is attributed to the effects of internal dust extinction which lowers the observed uv flux . when uv emission from high - mass stars is absorbed by dust ,",
    "it is re - emitted at infrared wavelengths .",
    "as @xcite points out , internal dust extinction serves as one of the largest sources of systematic error in sfr measurements . combining a measure of a star - forming galaxy s infrared emission with a measure of its",
    "uv emission yields a measure of the total sfr that is consistent with the rate inferred from  spectroscopic imaging .",
    "@xcite , for a sample of 33 nearby galaxies observed with the _ spitzer _ mips instrument at 24  , showed that using the 24  emission to account for the dust extinction allows for an accurate determination of the total number of ionising photons in an hii region .",
    "dwarf galaxies are particularly useful laboratories in which to study star formation . being morphologically and dynamically simpler systems than larger spiral galaxies , they allow us to stringently test star formation theories in the domains of low gas surface densities , extreme dark matter content , and lower rotational shear rates .",
    "this paper presents the results of a detailed study of the star formation activity in two nearby dwarfs , ngc  2915 and ngc  1705 .",
    "each galaxy has a small stellar disk embedded in a much larger disk . using the australia telescope compact array we have obtained new deep , high - resolution line observations of these galaxies in order to study their extended disks in unprecedented detail .",
    "we aim to link the characteristics of each galaxy to its observed star formation activity .",
    "far ultra - violet and 24  imaging from the galex and _ spitzer _ satellites , respectively is used to quantify the star formation activity . we combine all of these data to produce a suite of detailed star formation models that are used to understand the observed star formation in the context of the distribution and kinematics of the neutral ism .",

    "[ 2915_fuv_mips_sfr ] and fig .",
    "[ 1705_fuv_mips_sfr ] , respectively .",
    "the star formation models investigated in this work require a measure of the galaxy s rotation curve as input .",

    "the best - fitting parameters are @xmath46  and @xmath47 ( 1.5  kpc ) .",
    "the rotation curve for ngc  1705 was generated by parameterising the line profiles of an integrated position - velocity slice extracted from the new data cube ( the full details of the derivation of this rotation curve will be presented in our forthcoming publication elson  et  al ; 2012 , in preparation ) .",
    "this rotation curve is very similar to that derived previously by @xcite , and is best parameterised by @xmath48  and @xmath49 ( 1.3  kpc ) .",

    "the star formation models also require an estimate of the gas velocity dispersion .",
    "for some of the models considered in this work ; @xcite , @xcite and @xcite used a constant gas velocity dispersion of @xmath50  , without distinguishing between the various thermal phases of the ism .",

    "they showed that the velocity dispersion of the cold component , when used with a toomre  q criterion , gives an optimal description of ongoing star formation in ngc 6822 , superior to that using the more conventional dispersion value of 6  or the 8.2  value of the warmer component .",
    "@xcite showed that the drop in thermal velocity dispersion associated with the transition from the warm ( @xmath52  k ) to the cold ( @xmath53  k ) phase of the ism triggers gravitational instability on a wide range of scales .    throughout this work",
    "we assume a constant value of @xmath54  for the velocity dispersion of the cold gas phase of the neutral ism .",
    "adopting a radially - varying velocity dispersion based on the second - order moments would be difficult in the cases of ngc  2915 and ngc  1705 due to the fact that near their centres their kinematics are not virialised .",
    "this section deals with the various star formation models generated for ngc  2915 and ngc  1705 .",
    "each model is introduced and its method of implementation discussed .",
    "the results are presented together with a comparison to those of @xcite who carried out similar analyses for their sample of 23 nearby star - forming galaxies from things .",
    "this is done so that the results can be interpreted in the context of other typical star - forming dwarf galaxies .",
    "@xcite was the first to show that perturbations in a thin , rotating gaseous disk can become unstable to gravitational collapse due to the effects of the self - gravity of the disk .",
    "building on the work of @xcite , @xcite showed that a stellar disk that is fairly smooth or uniform , and that is rotating in approximate equilibrium between its self - gravitational and centrifugal forces , can not be entirely stable against the tendency to gravitationally collapse .",
    "this is the case unless the random motions within the disk are sufficiently large .",
    "today the toomre  q criterion is most commonly used to quantify the gravitational growth of perturbations within a thin , rotating gaseous disk . according to this criterion",
    ", the disk should be unstable to axisymmetric disturbances in regions where the toomre parameter , @xmath55 is less than unity . the self - gravity , pressure and kinematics of the gas disk",
    "are represented by @xmath56 , @xmath57 and @xmath58 , respectively .",
    "@xmath59 is the gravitational constant .",
    "the epicyclic frequency , @xmath60 , is a measure of the coriolis or centrifugal forces stemming from the rotation of the perturbations .",
    "following @xcite , @xmath60 is estimated as @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the rotation velocity at a radius @xmath6 .",
    "it is the combination of random motions and centrifugal accelerations from epicyclic eddies that supports the ism against collapse due to self - gravity .",
    "the toomre criterion therefore describes the abilities of perturbations to rotate around their centre of gravity and thus their stability against gravitational collapse .",
    "@xcite used a sample of 15 spiral galaxies to observationally test the toomre criterion on galactic length - scales .",
    "more recently , @xcite applied the prescription of @xcite to a sample of 32 star - forming spiral galaxies and compared the radial distributions of @xmath63 to  radial surface brightness profiles . for a sub - sample of 26 galaxies with well - defined thresholds",

    "the parameterisation of the observed rotation curve of each galaxy was used to analytically determine @xmath68 .",
    "an azimuthally averaged approximation of the epicyclic frequency was thus used for each of the resolution elements at a particular galactocentric radius .",
    "the  maps shown in this section can therefore be thought of as the map modulated by a radial function that is largely determined by the rotation curve .",

    "the  criterion incorrectly predicts the entire disks of both ngc  2915 and ngc  1705 to be sub - critical . this result is consistent with that of @xcite who found almost no area of the inner disk for their sample of 23 things galaxies to be formally unstable to gravitational collapse in a toomre  context .",
    "these results suggest the toomre  criterion to be of limited utility in terms of distinguishing star - forming regions of high and low efficiency .",
    "the stellar potential of each galaxy is expected to play a crucial role in regulating the star formation activity . despite this expectation , however , the  criterion also fails for ngc  2915 whose entire disk is predicted to be sub - critical .",
    "the model can not describe ngc  2915 s central star formation activity .",
    "the situation improves for ngc  1705 for which perturbation length scales of @xmath184  pc lead to predictions of its inner disk being formally gravitationally unstable .",
    "disk dark matter can account for the observed star formation activity in ngc  2915 and ngc  1705 .",
    "both galaxies are known to be extremely dark - matter - dominated .",
    "the fraction of their dark matter that is co - located within the disk is treated as contributing to the self - gravity of the ism . assuming a pseudo isothermal sphere parameterisation of each galaxy s dark matter halo , both ngc  2915 and ngc  1705 have formally unstable inner disks .",
    "this result does not hold for the case in which the distribution of the assumed disk dark matter exactly traces the distribution .",
    "the final star formation model investigated in this paper is a shear - based model built on the premise that it is the time available for clouds to collapse in the presence of rotational shear that regulates a galaxy s star formation . indeed , adopting the rotational shear as a characterisation of the global kinematics allows the  criterion to accurately locate the unstable parts of both ngc  2915 s and ngc  1705 s disks without the need for stellar or dark matter self - gravity .",
    "the same general result was obtained by @xcite who found the inner disks of their galaxies to be more nearly super - critical in the context of a shear - based  criterion than in the context of a  criterion .    in conclusion , despite ngc  2915 and ngc  1705 both being unusual star - forming galaxies , their star - formation activity can be partly understood in terms of the self - gravity of the ism which , in turn , is controlled by the combined effects of the gravitational potentials of their various mass components .",
    "alternatively , the star formation activity in each system can be accounted for by correctly characterising its global kinematics . throughout this work , in lieu of published co data , we have ignored any possible h@xmath1 components .",
    "molecular hydrogen must be present , it is unlikely that the observed star formation could be taking place without it . based on our measured star formation rates , we have estimated the amount of h@xmath1 within each galaxy to be of the order of @xmath185  ( @xmath186 orders of magnitude less than the dynamical mass of each galaxy ) .",
    "although we can not reliably incorporate the effects of this mass component into our star formation models , they are not expected to significantly affect the results .",
