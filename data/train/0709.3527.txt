    "critical phenomena in general relativity involves the study of solutions  called _ critical _ solutions  that lie at the boundary between black hole - forming and black hole - lacking spacetimes .",
    "( see @xcite for reviews . )",
    "published work in general relativistic critical phenomena began over a decade ago with a detailed numerical examination of the collapse dynamics of a massless scalar field , minimally coupled to the general relativistic gravitational field  @xcite .",
    "this first study in critical phenomena touched upon the three fundamental aspects of black - hole - threshold critical behavior : 1 ) universality and 2 ) scale invariance of the critical solution with 3 ) power - law behavior in its vicinity .",
    "all three of these features have now been seen in a multitude of matter models , such as perfect fluids @xcite , an @xmath1 yang - mills model  @xcite , and collisionless matter  @xcite to name a few .",
    "it was eventually found that there are two related yet distinct types of critical phenomena : type  i and type  ii , so named because of the similarities between critical phenomena in general relativity and those of statistical mechanics .",
    "type  ii behavior was the first to be discovered @xcite , and entails critical solutions that are either continuously self - similar ( css ) or discretely self - similar ( dss ) .",
    "super - critical solutions  those that form black holes  give rise to black holes with masses that scale as a power - law , @xmath2 implying that arbitrarily small black holes can be formed . here , @xmath3 parameterizes a @xmath4-parameter family of initial data with which one can tune toward the critical solution , located at @xmath5 , and @xmath6 is the scaling exponent of the critical behavior . since @xmath7 as @xmath8 , this type of critical behavior was named `` type  ii '' since it parallels type  ii ( continuous ) phase transitions of statistical mechanics .    as in the statistical mechanical case",
    ", there is also a type  i behavior in gravitational collapse , where the black hole mass `` turns on '' at a finite value .",
    "as might be expected , type  i critical solutions are quite different from their type  ii counterparts , tending to be meta - stable star - like solutions that are static or periodic . in this paper , attention is restricted to type  ii behavior ; results from our study of type i transitions in our model are reported in a separate paper  @xcite .",
    "the accepted picture describing the scaling behavior seen in type ii critical collapse was suggested by evans and coleman @xcite , who computed the critical solution for a radiation fluid ( fluid pressure , @xmath9 , and density , @xmath10 , related by @xmath11 ) in two distinct ways .",
    "first , using a code that solved the full set of partial differential equations ( pdes ) for the fluid and gravitational field , and by tuning an initial data parameter as sketched above , evans and coleman were able to compute a strong field solution that sat at the threshold of black hole formation , as well as establish a scaling law of the form  ( [ mass - scaling ] ) .",
    "furthermore , the results of this numerical experiment provided compelling evidence that the threshold solution was continuously self - similar .",
    "second , by adopting the assumption of continuous self - similarity as an ansatz , evans and coleman reduced the set of pdes governing their model to a set of odes , from which a precisely css solution was calculated . the solutions computed using these two completely different techniques",
    "were found to agree extremely well .",
    "crucially , it was argued that the observed scaling behavior of the mass above threshold could be explained using linear perturbation theory about a background given by the css critical solution .",
    "such an analysis was carried out by koike et al .",
    "@xcite ( for the radiation fluid ) , who showed that the scaling exponent , @xmath6 , was the inverse of the lyapunov exponent of the critical solution s single , unstable eigenmode .",
    "subsequent work showed that @xmath6 was not a truly universal constant , but that its value could depend on the specifics of the matter model used .",
    "the first evidence for this non - universality in scaling behavior was given in concurrent works by maison @xcite and hara et al .",
    "@xcite . using similar methods to those of @xcite",
    ", they found that @xmath6 for an `` ultrarelativistic '' fluid with equation of state ( eos ) @xmath12 is dependent on the adiabatic index , @xmath13 .",
    "most of these investigations , however , have involved ultrarelativistic fluids that are explicitly scale - free .",
    "the reason for the predominance of this type of fluid is due to the fact that cahill and taub @xcite showed that only those perfect fluids which have state equations of the form of eq .",
    "( [ ultra - eos])i.e .",
    "the so - called ultrarelativistic eos  can give rise to spacetimes that admit a homothetic symmetry ( i.e.  which are self - similar ) .",
    "hence , it is not completely unreasonable to expect that type  ii , css critical solutions would only appear in such fluids , or at least in fluids that admit an ultrarelativistic limit . to study this conjecture , neilsen and one of the current authors @xcite considered the evolution of a typical perfect fluid with equation of state , @xmath14 that introduces a length scale into the field equations .",
    "here , @xmath9 is the pressure , @xmath15 is the rest - mass energy density , and @xmath16 is the specific internal energy density .",
    "it was argued in  @xcite that type  ii critical collapse scenarios are typically kinetic energy dominated , entailing increasingly large central pressures that maintain the tenuous balance between the matter dispersing from the origin and collapsing to a black hole .",
    "therefore , if was reasoned that should one be able to give the fluid sufficient kinetic energy , then it would naturally enter an ultrarelativistic phase . specifically ,",
    "if the fluid undergoes a collapse such that @xmath17 dynamically , then @xmath15 will effectively become negligible in the equations of motion ( eom ) and the system will be able to follow a scale - free  hence self - similar  evolution . to see if this hypothesis was correct , compact distributions of perfect fluid , with @xmath18 ( @xmath19 ) were collapsed , and the calculations were tuned to a threshold solution .",
    "the critical solution thus obtained by solving the full set of pdes closely matched the precisely self - similar solution , which was calculated by assuming that a model governed by the ultrarelativistic eom had an exact homothetic symmetry .",
    "further , it was found that the scaling exponent , @xmath6 , defined by eq .",
    "( [ mass - scaling ] ) matched that of the ultrarelativistic critical solution with @xmath19 .",
    "since the ultrarelativistic fluid exhibited type  ii phenomena for all considered values of the adiabatic index in the range @xmath20 , the results of @xcite suggested that the type ii ideal - gas critical solution for _ any _ @xmath13 in that range should be the same as that for an ultrarelativistic fluid with the same @xmath13 .",
    "this hypothesis is not without precedence , since several models have been found to exhibit dss or css collapse , even when explicit length scales are present .",
    "for instance , one of us found type  ii behavior for the case of a collapsing _ massive _ scalar field  @xcite  that is a scalar field with potential @xmath21even though the model has an explicit length scale set by @xmath22 .",
    "the heuristic argument presented in  @xcite is that the potential term is naturally bounded since @xmath23 itself is bounded in the critical regime , but that the kinetic term@xmath24diverges in the critical limit . hence , the kinetic term overwhelms the potential term and essentially makes the critical evolution scale - free .",
    "the single study exhibiting type  ii behavior in perfect fluid collapse with an ideal gas eos  @xcite remained unverified until work by novak  @xcite . to determine the possible range in masses of nascent black holes formed from stellar collapse , novak performed a parameter space survey using tolman - oppenheimer - volkoff ( tov ) solutions with @xmath25 ,",
    "varying the overall amplitude , @xmath26 , of an otherwise fixed initial coordinate velocity profile for the fluid in order to generate critical solutions .",
    "the type  ii behavior observed was quantified by fitting to the typical black hole mass scaling relation ( [ mass - scaling ] ) , where @xmath3 was identified with @xmath26 .",
    "significantly , novak was able to observe scaling behavior even with a realistic equation of state formulated by pons et al .",
    "this was somewhat surprising , since there were some expectations that type  ii phenomena would not be observed when using realistic equations of state @xcite .",
    "however , provided that the equation of state admits an ultrarelativistic limit , as is apparently the case for novak s calculations , the heuristic argument sketched above suggests that one _ should _ expect to see type ii transitions .",
    "although novak observed type  ii behavior , he did not find the same scaling exponent as had been observed for the @xmath25 ultrarelativistic fluid in the study described in  @xcite . in addition , he claimed that @xmath6 was a function of 1 ) the central rest - mass density , @xmath27 , which ( as described in the next section ) parameterizes the initial star solution , and 2 ) the eos used .",
    "he observed that the fit to eq .",
    "( [ mass - scaling ] ) worsened as @xmath27 increased to that of the maximum mass solution , and that it eventually broke down completely . specifically , he found for the ideal - gas eos ( [ ideal - eos ] ) @xmath28 and when using the realistic eos @xmath29 these values are significantly different from the values most recently calculated with the @xmath25 ultrarelativistic fluid  @xcite using a variety of methods : @xmath30 here we have taken the average of the three independent values calculated in  @xcite and the quoted uncertainty is the standard deviation of those values , and does not include the systematic errors inherent in the distinct calculations .",
    "however , novak clearly states in  @xcite that his code was not designed to simulate the formation of very small black holes , and apparently was only able to tune to a precision of @xmath31 . in this paper",
    ", we reexamine the type  ii behavior in this particular system in order to check the claims of  @xcite , and obtain what we claim is an improved measurement of the scaling exponent .",
    "different families of initial data are used to demonstrate the universality of our computed critical solution . also , we compare the critical configuration calculated from a near - threshold neutron star collapse to the critical solution obtained using an explicitly ultrarelativistic fluid .",
    "to more accurately study css behavior as the black hole threshold is approached , we employ mesh refinement techniques and non - uniform discretization .",
    "further , we implement methods that improve the accuracy of the transformation from so called conservative variables to primitive variables that is required in our numerical analysis .    the remainder of this paper is structured as follows .",

    "we then conclude in sec .",
    "[ sec : concl - future - work ] with some closing remarks and notes on anticipated future work .",
    "geometrized units , @xmath32 , are used throughout , and our tensor notation follows @xcite .",
    "as in many previous critical phenomena studies in spherical symmetry @xcite , we employ the so - called polar - areal metric @xmath33 where @xmath34 is often referred to as the lapse function .",
    "we use the perfect fluid approximation for the matter model of our neutron stars , so the stress - energy tensor takes the form @xmath35 here , @xmath36 is the 4-velocity of a given fluid element , @xmath37 is the isotropic pressure , @xmath38 is the energy density , @xmath39 is the rest - mass energy density , and @xmath40 is the specific internal energy .",
    "modern computational methods that cast the hyperbolic fluid equations of motion in conservation form , and that use information concerning the characteristics of the equations , have been used very successfully in the modeling of highly - relativistic flows with strong gravity ( see @xcite for a small , but representative , selection of papers on this topic ) .",
    "here we adopt the formulation used by romero et al .",
    "@xcite , with a change of variables similar to that performed in  @xcite .",
    "the formulation described in  @xcite has been used extensively for treating relativistic flows in the presence of strong gravitation fields , and appears to work quite well in such instances .",
    "the eom for the fluid are derived from the local conservation equations for energy and baryon number which are , respectively , @xmath41 @xmath42 rather than working directly with the components of the fluid 4-velocity , it is more useful to employ the radial component of the eulerian  or physical  velocity of the fluid as measured by an eulerian observer : @xmath43 where @xmath44 $ ] .",

    "we found that for extremely relativistic flows near the threshold of black hole formation , this formulation was not very stable .",

    "the unstable kink mode manifests itself as an ever - steepening discontinuity in @xmath10 at the sonic point , @xmath181 , that diverges in finite proper time .",
    "a mild , seed discontinuity at @xmath181 is necessary for the mode to grow , but  since it diverges in finite time ",
    "minute discontinuities inevitable in discretized solutions , for instance , are expected to be sufficient to manifest the instability .",
    "physically , the `` seed '' discontinuity could be the scale at which the continuum approximation of hydrodynamics breaks down , i.e.  at the particle scale .    in our nonlinear pde solutions that use the ideal - gas eos , we do in fact find a growing discontinuity in @xmath9 and @xmath15 at @xmath181 ( fig .  [",
    "fig : p - rho - ultra - regime ] ) , and this is precisely where our instability develops .",
    "however , as was the case in  @xcite , our solutions of the pdes for an explicitly ultrarelativistic fluid do _ not _ develop instabilities in the vicinity of @xmath181 for @xmath25 .",
    "one possible reason for this could be the fact that in this case the flow is never transonic , i.e.  there is no sonic point since @xmath283 , and the flow can never attain this velocity . for the ideal - gas fluid , there _ is _ a sonic point , as @xmath284 ( albeit arbitrarily close to @xmath4 ) since @xmath285 will always be non - zero during a numerical evolution .",
    "however , the results of  @xcite include ultrarelativistic near - threshold solutions for @xmath286 .",
    "this case _ does _ allow for the presence of the sonic point , so it may be that sonic - point kinks were not seen in this instance because @xmath10 never became sufficiently steep at @xmath181 to excite the kink mode .     for different values of @xmath13 .",

    "the scaling exponents derived from the two new sets of computations are @xmath298 and @xmath299 .",
    "the @xmath300 scaling exponent is the same as that calculated with the ultrarelativistic pdes in @xcite , while the @xmath287 scaling exponent is consistent with the value obtained for @xmath301 , the value of @xmath13 closest to 1.88 for which @xmath6 was computed in  @xcite .",
    "we find that there is no consistent behavior in code stability as the @xmath297 value is crossed .",
    "in fact , we find the opposite of the expected behavior : we are able to tune the kink - unstable ( @xmath288 ) data closer to @xmath156 than the kink - stable ( @xmath287 ) data .",
    "we therefore find it unlikely that the kink mode is the cause of our sonic point instability .    even if the kink mode is unstable for our eos , tuning toward the css solution while in the presence of another unstable mode is not without precedent .",
    "for example , in a study of the spherically - symmetric general relativistic harmonic - map ( nonlinear sigma model ) , liebling @xcite discovered that by judicious choice of an initial data family , he could tune to a critical solution that had been shown to have _ two _ unstable modes .",
    "however , it is unclear what relation this work might have to our current study , since the type of initial data that we are studying does not seem to have been chosen in any particularly special way ( i.e.  we suspect that the initial data that we have used is generic , whereas that used by liebling to tune to the two - mode - unstable solution was , by construction , non - generic ) .",
    "what _ is _ clear is that this issue requires further investigation , but we will leave that to future studies .",
    "in this work , we simulated spherically - symmetric relativistic perfect fluid flow in the strong - field regime of general relatively .",
    "specifically , a perfect fluid that admits a length scale , for example one that follows a relativistic ideal - gas law , was used to investigate the dynamics of compact , stellar objects .",
    "these stars were modeled as neutron stars by using a stiff equation of state , approximating the behavior of some realistic state equations .",
    "our models were then used to study the dynamics of neutron stars so far out of equilibrium that they are driven to gravitational collapse .",
    "since these systems entail highly - relativistic fluid motions and strong , nonlinear effects from the fluid - gravitational interaction , a numerical treatment is challenging . to achieve stable evolutions in near - luminal flows , while using high resolution shock capturing techniques , the primitive variable solver required improvements . in addition ,",
    "an instability was found to develop in calculations near the threshold of black hole formation , and this necessitated the use of new computational methods , that were only partially successful in stabilizing the calculations .",
    "we find our value for the scaling exponent , @xmath6 , given in eq .",
    "( [ final - gamma ] ) agrees well with those found in @xcite , and agrees with the value of @xmath6 computed in  @xcite to within the uncertainty quoted in that work .",
    "we note that a discrepancy in the values of @xmath6 computed using ideal - gas and ultrarelativistic fluids was observed in  @xcite , and this is also the case for our calculations .",
    "our ultrarelativistic value , @xmath302 , agrees well with the value calculated in  @xcite , but deviates by an estimated 3 standard deviations from the value extracted from our ideal - gas calculations .",
    "it is somewhat interesting , yet probably coincidental , that our results from the ideal - gas system of equations lead to estimates of @xmath6 that agree with the perturbation calculations better than those values found from the ultrarelativistic pde calculations .",
    "our findings thus do not support some of the results found , and claims made by novak @xcite for the case of fluid collapse with an ideal - gas eos and @xmath25 .",
    "this previous work suggested that the type ii behavior observed in such a case was _ not _ well approximated by a universal ( with respect to initial data ) ultrarelativistic limit .",
    "however , using different stars and velocity profiles , and by varying other aspects of the numerical model , we have found scaling behavior that is insensitive to approximations made in the numerical solution , and which _ does _ appear to be universal with respect to families of initial data .",
    "moreover , we have found that the scaling exponent and critical solution for the collapse governed by the ideal - gas eos agrees well with their ultrarelativistic counterparts .    ultimately , it is our goal to expand the model a great deal , making the matter description more realistic and eliminating symmetry . as a first step , we wish to develop adaptive mesh refinement procedures for conservative systems that will be required to study critical phenomena of stellar objects in axial - symmetry @xcite .",
    "it remains to be seen whether the universal scaling behavior we have observed is also seen with more realistic state equations such as the one novak used . since accurate measurements of @xmath6",
    "have only been found for equations of state with constant adiabatic index @xmath13 , and since @xmath6 seems to only depend on @xmath13 for perfect fluids , it will be interesting to investigate in detail what the scaling behavior  if any  will be like for realistic state equations with variable @xmath13 .",
    "however , to the extent that any given realistic eos admits a unique ultrarelativistic limit , characterized by a _",
    "single _ value of @xmath13 , we can expect to see universal type ii behavior of the sort discussed in this paper , for at least _ some _ collapse scenarios .",

    "we employ high - resolution shock capturing ( hrsc ) algorithms to solve the equations of motion for the fluid ( [ conservationeq ] ) .",
    "such methods have become increasingly popular in the field of relativistic hydrodynamics since they are flux conservative , and ensure that discontinuities are well resolved and propagate at the correct speeds in the continuum limit . a key ingredient to these schemes",
    "is their use of solvers for the riemann problem at every cell interface .",
    "this is crucial for the conservative nature of these schemes since the solution to the riemann problem is always a weak solution of the hyperbolic conservation laws .",
    "the `` high - resolution '' aspect of the algorithms denotes that in regions where the grid functions are smooth , the integration procedure is at least @xmath175 accurate .",
    "many of the hrsc methods used in this paper have been used in previous works such as @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite to name only a few relevant sources . also , excellent references on conservative methods for general systems of hyperbolic conservation equations have been written by leveque @xcite .",
    "unlike finite difference methods , finite volume or conservative methods calculate the cell - averages of grid functions instead of the grid functions themselves .",
    "the difference equations for conservative methods are not derived from taylor - series approximations of derivatives , but from differences of integrals .",

    "unless otherwise stated , all results presented in this paper were produced using an approximate roe - type solver as outlined in @xcite for calculating the numerical flux .",
    "the roe solver @xcite approximately solves the riemann problem at each cell interface by casting the conservation equation ( [ conservationeq ] ) into quasi - linear form .",
    "we approximate the roe matrix @xmath314 as @xmath315 with @xmath316 and where @xmath317 and @xmath318 will be defined shortly .",

    "<S> we investigate spherically - symmetric , general relativistic systems of collapsing perfect fluid distributions . </S>",
    "<S> we consider neutron star models that are driven to collapse by the addition of an initially `` in - going '' velocity profile to the nominally static star solution . </S>",
    "<S> the neutron star models we use are tolman - oppenheimer - volkoff solutions with an initially isentropic , gamma - law equation of state . </S>",
    "<S> the initial values of 1 ) the amplitude of the velocity profile , and 2 ) the central density of the star , span a parameter space , and we focus only on that region that gives rise to type  ii critical behavior , wherein black holes of arbitrarily small mass can be formed . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast to previously published work , we find that  for a specific value of the adiabatic index ( @xmath0)the observed type  ii critical solution has approximately the same scaling exponent as that calculated for an ultrarelativistic fluid of the same index . </S>",
    "<S> further , we find that the critical solution computed using the ideal - gas equations of state asymptotes to the ultrarelativistic critical solution . </S>"
