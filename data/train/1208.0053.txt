    "recently , guth and katz @xcite presented the _ polynomial partitioning technique _ as a major technical tool in their solution of the famous planar distinct distances problem of erds @xcite .",
    "this problem can be reduced to an incidence problem involving points and lines in @xmath5 ( following the reduction that was proposed in @xcite ) , which can be solved by applying the aforementioned polynomial partitioning technique .",
    "katz result prompted various other incidence - related studies that rely on polynomial partitioning ( e.g. , see @xcite ) .",
    "one consequence of these studies is that they have led to further developments and enhancements of the technique itself ( evidenced for example by the use of induction in @xcite , and the use of two partitioning polynomials in @xcite ) .",
    "also , the technique was recently applied to some problems that are not incidence related : it was used to provide an alternative proof of the existence of spanning trees with small crossing number in any dimension @xcite , and to obtain improved algorithms for range searching with semialgebraic sets @xcite .",
    "thus , it seems fair to say that applications and enhancements of the polynomial partitioning technique form an active contemporary area of research in combinatorial and computational geometry .    in this paper",
    "we study incidences between points and circles in three dimensions .",
    "let @xmath17 be a set of @xmath0 points and @xmath18 a set of @xmath1 circles in @xmath5 .",
    "we denote the number of point - circle incidences in @xmath19 as @xmath20 .",
    "when the circles have arbitrary radii , the current best bound for any dimension @xmath21 ( originally established for the planar case in @xcite , and later extended to higher dimensions by aronov , koltun , and sharir @xcite ) is @xmath22 the precise best known upper bound is @xmath23 @xcite .",
    "since the three - dimensional case also allows @xmath17 and @xmath18 to lie on a single common plane or sphere , the point - circle incidence bound in @xmath5 can not be improved without first improving the planar bound ( which is still an open problem , for about 10 years ) .",
    "nevertheless , as we show in this paper , an improved bound can be obtained if the configuration of points and circles is `` truly three - dimensional '' in the sense that no sphere or plane contains too many circles from @xmath18 .",
    "( guth and katz @xcite impose a similar assumption on the maximum number of lines that can lie in a common plane or regulus ; see also sharir and solomon  @xcite . )",
    "our main result is given in the following theorem .",
    "[ th : arb ] let @xmath17 be a set of @xmath0 points and let @xmath18 be a set of @xmath1 circles in @xmath5 , let @xmath24 be an arbitrarily small positive constant , and let @xmath25 be an integer . if no sphere or plane contains more than @xmath6 circles of @xmath18 , then @xmath26 where the constant of proportionality depends on @xmath24 .",

    "theorem [ th : arb ] implies that for certain ranges of @xmath27 and @xmath6 , a smaller upper bound holds in @xmath5 .",
    "this is the case , for example , when @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "\\(2 ) when @xmath28 , we have @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "hence , we have @xmath31 in fact , as the analysis in this paper will show , the first term in this bound only arises from bounding incidences on certain potentially `` rich '' planes or spheres .",
    "for @xmath32 we have @xmath33 .",
    "informally , for such small values of @xmath6 , when the number of points is @xmath34 , a typical point can lie in only a small ( nearly constant ) number of circles .",
    "\\(3 ) when @xmath35 , any of the terms except for @xmath0 can dominate the bound .",
    "however , if in addition @xmath36 then the bound becomes @xmath37 for any @xmath38 .",
    "note also that the interesting range of parameters is @xmath39 and @xmath40 , where the @xmath41 and @xmath42 notations hide terms of the form @xmath43 and @xmath44 ; in the complementary ranges both the old and new bounds become ( almost ) linear in @xmath45 . in the interesting range ,",
    "the new bound is asymptotically smaller than the planar bound given in for @xmath6 sufficiently small ( e.g. , when @xmath46 as above ) , and as noted , it is also smaller than the best known worst - case lower bound in the planar case for certain ranges of @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "\\(4 ) interestingly , the `` threshold '' value @xmath47 where a quantitative change in the bound takes place ( as noted in remarks ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) above ) also arises in the study of incidences between points and lines in @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "see section  [ furtherapplicationssection ] for a discussion of this threshold phenomenon .",
    "the proof of theorem [ th : arb ] is based on the polynomial partitioning technique of guth and katz  @xcite , where we use a constant - degree partitioning polynomial in a manner similar to that used by solymosi and tao  @xcite .",
    "( the use of constant - degree polynomials and the inductive arguments it leads to are essentially the only similarities with the technique of @xcite , which does not apply to circles in any dimension since it can not handle situations where arbitrarily many curves can pass between any specific pair of points .",
    "constant degree partitioning polynomials were also recently used in @xcite . )",
    "the application of this technique to incidences involving circles leads to new problems , involving the handling of points that are incident to many circles that are entirely contained in the zero set of the partitioning polynomial .",
    "to handle this situation we turn these circles into lines using an inversion transformation .",
    "we then analyze the geometric and algebraic structure of the transformed zero set using a variety of tools such as _ flecnode polynomials _ ( as used in @xcite ) , additional classical @xmath48-century results in analytic geometry from @xcite ( mostly related to _ ruled surfaces _ ) , a very recent technique for analyzing surfaces that are  ruled \" by lines and circles @xcite , and some traditional tools from combinatorial geometry .",
    "we note that while our results refer to the real affine case , part of our analysis considers the setup in complex projective spaces , in which more classical results from algebraic geometry can be brought to bear . by transporting the results back to the real affine case",
    ", we obtain the properties that we wish to establish .",
    "see section [ sec : reg ] for details .",
    "* removing the epsilons . * one disadvantage of the current use of constant - degree partitioning polynomials is that it leads to an upper bound involving @xmath49 s in some of the exponents ( as stated in theorem  [ th : arb ] ) . in section [ ssec : eps ] we present an alternative approach , which uses partitioning polynomials of higher degree but requires a more involved analysis , for partially removing these @xmath49 s .",
    "it yields the following theorem :    [ th : noeps ] let @xmath17 be a set of @xmath0 points and let @xmath18 be a set of @xmath1 circles in @xmath5 , let @xmath25 be an integer , and let @xmath50 , for some fixed arbitrarily small constant @xmath51 .",

    "for example , it is @xmath57 for @xmath58 , @xmath59 for @xmath60 , and @xmath61 for @xmath62 .",
    "recently , several other situations in which such @xmath49 s can be removed were described in @xcite .",

    "* remarks . *",
    "( 1 ) it is interesting to compare the bounds in ( [ eqnew ] ) and ( [ eqnew - uni ] ) with the various recent bounds on incidences between points and lines in three dimensions  @xcite . in all of them",
    "the threshold value @xmath47 plays a significant role . specifically : ( i ) the number of joints in a set of @xmath1 lines in @xmath5 is @xmath635 , a bound tight in the worst case @xcite .",
    "( ii ) if no plane contains more than @xmath636 lines , the number of points incident to at least @xmath637 lines is @xmath638 @xcite .",
    "( iii ) a related bound where @xmath639 is a threshold value , under different assumptions , is given in @xcite .",
    "the bounds in ( [ eqnew ] ) and ( [ eqnew - uni ] ) are somewhat weaker ( because of the extra small factors hidden in the @xmath42 notation , the rather restrictive constraints on @xmath6 , and the constraint @xmath628 ) but they belong to the same class of results",
    ". it would be interesting to understand how general this phenomenon is ; for example , does it also show up in incidences with other classes of curves in @xmath5 ?",
    "we tend to conjecture that this is the case , under reasonable assumptions concerning those curves .",
    "similar threshold phenomena should exist in higher dimensions .  extrapolating \" from the results of @xcite",
    ", these thresholds should be at @xmath640 .",
    "\\(2 ) the bounds can be slightly tightened by using theorem  [ th : noeps ] or theorem  [ th : unitnoeps ] instead of theorem  [ th : arb ] or theorem  [ th : uni ] , respectively , but we leave these slight improvements to the interested reader .",
    "another application of theorem [ th : arb ] ( or rather of theorem [ th : noeps ] ) is an improved bound on the number of triangles spanned by a set @xmath17 of @xmath641 points in @xmath5 and similar to a given triangle @xmath67 .",
    "let @xmath68 be the number of triangles spanned by @xmath17 that are similar to @xmath67 , and let @xmath642 be the maximum of @xmath68 as @xmath17 ranges over all sets of @xmath641 points and @xmath67 ranges over all triangles .",
    "we then have :      let @xmath17 be a set of @xmath641 points in @xmath5 and let @xmath644 be a given triangle .",
    "suppose that @xmath645 is a similar copy of @xmath67 , where @xmath646 .",
    "if @xmath141 corresponds to @xmath391 and @xmath6 to @xmath647 then @xmath79 has to lie on a circle @xmath648 that is orthogonal to the segment @xmath649 , whose center lies at a fixed point on this segment , and whose radius is proportional to @xmath650 .",
    "thus , the number of possible candidates for the point @xmath79 , for @xmath651 fixed , is exactly the number of incidences between @xmath17 and @xmath648 .",
    "there are @xmath652 such circles , and no circle arises more than twice in this manner .",
    "it follows that @xmath642 is bounded by twice the number of incidences between the @xmath641 points of @xmath17 and the @xmath653 circles @xmath648 .",
    "we now apply theorem [ th : noeps ] with @xmath654 and @xmath655 .",
    "( the theorem applies for these values , which satisfy @xmath656 , much smaller than the threshold @xmath291 ; in fact , @xmath0 lies in the second range @xmath657 $ ] . )",
    "it remains to show that the expression is @xmath658 .",
    "the first term of is @xmath658 .",
    "to control the remaining terms , it suffices to show that at most @xmath659 of the circles lie on a common plane or sphere .",
    "in fact , we claim that at most @xmath660 circles can lie on a common plane or sphere .",
    "indeed , let @xmath243 be a plane .",
    "then for any circle @xmath648 contained in @xmath243 , @xmath649 must be orthogonal to @xmath661 pass through the center of @xmath648 , and each of @xmath141 and @xmath6 must lie at a fixed distance from @xmath243 ( the distances are determined by the triangle @xmath67 and by the radius of @xmath648 ) .",
    "this implies that each point of @xmath17 can generate at most two circles on @xmath243 .",
    "the argument for cosphericality is essentially the same .",
    "the only difference is that one point of @xmath17 may lie at the center of the given sphere @xmath494 , and then it can determine up to @xmath662 distinct circles on @xmath494 .",
    "still , the number of circles on @xmath494 is @xmath660 .",
    "as noted above , this completes the proof of the theorem .",
