    "as a result of these observations , the spectra of approximately 10,000 stars are now available in the fuv wavelengths .    recently",
    ", the far - ultraviolet imaging spectrograph ( _ fims _ ) , also known as the spectroscopy of plasma evolution from astrophysical radiation ( _ spear _ ) , performed an all - sky survey in the fuv wavelength region .",
    "the _ fims _ is a dual channel imaging spectrograph ( _ s_-band : 9001150  , _ l_-band : 13701710  ) with moderate spectral ( @xmath0 @xmath1 550 ) and angular ( @xmath1 5 ) resolutions , and it was designed for the observation of diffuse emissions from interstellar medium @xcite .",
    "the primary purpose of the _ fims _ is to study the fuv emission from atomic , ionic , and molecular species in a variety of interstellar environments ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "in addition , a number of bright stars have also been observed when they are within its large image fields of view , defined by the slit size ( _ s_-band : 40 @xmath2 46 , _ l_-band : 75 @xmath2 43 ) .",
    "this paper discusses the spectral extraction of these observed bright stars .",
    "the _ fims _ was used to make observations for one and a half years , covering more than 80% of the sky , after its launch by the korean microsatellite _",
    "stsat-1 _ on 27 september 2003 into a 700 km sun - synchronous orbit .",
    "although stars were observed in both the _ s_- and _ l_-bands , the _ s_-band data were excluded from the present analysis because of their strong contamination with geocoronal emission lines as well as the low detector sensitivity .",
    "we extracted the _",
    "l_-band spectra for 532 stars from 1,523 orbits of observations during its mission lifetime , from which 70 stars were observed for the first time . here",
    ", we report the fuv spectra of these stars along with those of the 139 stars that were observed with a better spectral resolution and/or higher reliability than those of the previous observations , as the _ fims _ catalogue stars . the remaining 323 stars , which were also observed by the _ iue _ in a large aperture mode , were used to validate the _",
    "fims _ spectra .",
    "most of the 323 stars were observed in the high - dispersion mode of the _ iue _ with a spectral resolution of @xmath10.2  , but 34 stars among them were observed in the low - dispersion mode and with a lower spectral resolution of @xmath16  .",

    "the constant pixel area of the healpix scheme makes it convenient to extract stellar spectra , which are mixed with the background spectra because of instrumental scattering .",
    "we identified the stars by comparing the _ fims _ images with the locations of the bright stars in the _ td1 _ star catalogue @xcite based on the s2/68 ultraviolet sky survey telescope ( _ uvsst _ ) of the _ td1 _ satellite .",
    "_ uvsst _ is described in @xcite and the absolute calibration of the instrument is given in @xcite .",
    "_ uvsst _ consisted of an f/3.5 telescope with a primary mirror having a diameter of 27.5 cm , feeding photons to a spectrometer and photometer .",
    "the spectrometer has an entrance aperture of 118 @xmath2 17and a wavelength band in the range of 130255 nm with spectral resolution of 35  .",
    "the photometer has an aperture of 17 @xmath2 17with a broad passband ( 31 nm ) centred at 274 nm .",
    "the first _ uvsst _",
    "spectral catalogue for 1,356 stars was published by @xcite .",
    "later , @xcite extended the catalogue to 31,215 stars and provided the absolute uv fluxes in four passbands : 135175 nm , 175215 nm , 215255 nm , and the photometric band at 274 nm .",
    "the fluxes of the first three wavelength bands were obtained by binning the spectrophotometric data , and the flux of the longest wavelength band was based on the photometric data only .",
    "hence , the angular resolution of the catalogue is limited by that of the photometer , which is 2 arcmin .",
    "it is notable that the shortest passband of 135175 nm , centred at 1565  ( henceforth , f1565 ) , is comparable with that of the _ fims _ _ l_-band and was used for identification of uv bright stars in the present study because the _ td1 _ is more sensitive and has higher angular resolution than _",
    "we note that the photometric catalogue ( henceforth , _ td1 _ ) extended by @xcite were used to identify stars , while the spectral catalogue ( henceforth , _ uvsst _ ) made by @xcite were used to compare with the _ fims _ spectra after section 3 .    in order to avoid misidentification of stars in crowded areas and contamination by other bright stars in the surrounding region",
    ", we selected only the stars listed in the _ td1 _ catalogue that were isolated within the 2@xmath2 2  angular region centred around the target stars . since the angular resolution of _ td1 _ ( 2 ) is higher than that of the _ fims _ , we believe that the _ td1 _",
    "catalogue is able to resolve the stars even for those that the _ fims _ can not if the stars were bright enough to be observed by _",
    "td1_. hence , the angular resolution of the _ fims _ catalogue is limited by that of the _ td1 _ catalogue .",
    "further , we checked the 2@xmath2 2  _ fims _ images and discarded the pixels brighter than the background median values by a factor of three , except those associated with the target stars . the faintest star in the resulting _ fims _ catalogue has a flux of @xmath17 @xmath2 10@xmath3 erg s@xmath4 @xmath5 @xmath4 , much higher than the typical _ td1 _ flux limit of 10@xmath3 erg s@xmath4 @xmath5 @xmath4 in the spectral band of 13501750  .",
    "although we avoided regions of high concentration of uv sources on the basis of the _ td1 _ , there may still exist some stars which were not resolved in the _ td1 _",
    "catalogue among the _ fims _ catalogue stars .",
    "however , we found no bright stars near the stars included in the _ fims _ catalogue . instead ,",
    "some stars that were observed by _ fims _ but not included in our catalogue were found to be contaminated by unresolved stars .",
    "for example , hd 214167 ( b1.5vs ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) was found to form a double system with one of the _ fims _ star of hd 214168 ( b1vne : ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , separated by an angular distance of @xmath10.37 . as another example , hd 199739 with a spectral type of b2ii @xcite was found at an angular distance of 4  from one of the _ fims _ star of hd 199661 . however , the star is fainter than hd 199661 by 1.7 mag ( 21% ) in v band and 2.8 mag ( 8% ) in u band @xcite .",
    "these two stars were not included in the _ fims _ catalogue since they were also observed by the iue . in summary , although the 2@xmath2 2  angular region may contain many other stars not resolved in the _ td1 _ , the contamination due to them would not be significant .",
    "once the target star was identified and the region of 2@xmath2 2  tiles were confirmed to be free of bright stars , we performed a gaussian fitting for each image to find the centre of the star .",
    "we note that instrumental scattering results in diffuse images even for a point source .",
    "the selection of this large area around each star is necessary because the instrumental scattering by the slit caused the elongated image of a bright star along the slit direction , as shown in figure [ fig : tile ] for hd 143275 .",
    "the multiple image tiles produced by multiple observations for the same star were merged into one before spectral information was extracted .",

    ". however , narrower lines , such as @xmath71527 , 1533 , are less clear in the _ fims _ spectra than in the _ iue _ spectra because of the variation of spectral resolution across the detector .",

    "the figures illustrate that , of the 209 catalogue stars , the spectra of 58 stars had high snrs above 6.0 .",
    "most of these were bright stars observed with longer exposure times than the average of 20 s. the stellar spectral type of catalogue stars ranged from o9 to a3 ; 115 of these stars are main sequence stars , 28 are subgiant stars , 48 are normal giant stars , 5 are bright giant stars , and 13 are unknown .",
    "the stars with spectral types beyond a4 were not analysed with a sufficient snr because their flux level was weak in the fuv band due to the low surface temperature ; hence , they have been excluded from the catalogue .    for the stars listed in table [ tbl : sample ] , example spectra",

    "it is seen that the _ uvsst _ spectra , marked with dash - dotted blue lines in figures [ fig : sample](a ) to [ fig : sample](c ) agree well with the _ fims _ spectra ; however , the absorption features are not resolved in the _ uvsst _ spectra due to the low spectral resolution of 35  .",
    "the _ skylab _ spectra , which are marked using dashed orange lines in figures [ fig : sample](a ) , [ fig : sample](b ) , and [ fig : sample](d ) , have a similar spectral resolution to that of the _ fims _ spectra . however , as seen in figure [ fig : flux ] , the flux levels of the _ skylab _ spectra deviate significantly from those of the _ iue _ spectra while the _ fims _ flux levels are more or less consistent with the _ iue _ observations . hence , we believe that the _ fims _ spectra are more reliable than the _ skylab _ spectra . figures [ fig : sample](e ) and [ fig : sample](f ) show two examples observed by the _ fims _ only . strong absorption lines including , , and lines are seen in both spectra even though the snr is low in the case of figure [ fig : sample](f ) . according to the simbad database , the spectral type of hd 65176 , shown in figure [ fig : sample](f ) , is a0 .",

    "the fuv wavelength band covered by the _",
    "fims _ includes many ion lines associated with hot and warm gases .",
    "hence , as can be seen in figure [ fig : sample ] , the prominent ion absorption lines such as @xmath71548 , 1551 and @xmath71394 , 1403 can be used to confirm the spectral classes for early - type stars .",
    "for instance , strong absorption features shown in figure [ fig : sample](e ) indicate that hd 84567 is a supergiant or giant star with a higher mass - loss rate rather than a subgiant ( see * ? ? ? * ) . on the other hand , the measured slope ( -0.67 ) after reddening correction",
    "is consistent with -0.66 estimated from the skiff s spectral type of b0iv .",
    "another example is hd 65176 , which is classified to be a0 in the simbad database .",
    "however , the deep absorption features shown in figure [ fig : sample](f ) suggest that the star is an early b - type as assigned to be b1.5ib / iiep in @xcite .",
    "furthermore , we note that the spectral shape changes significantly in this wavelength band as the spectral type changes for the early - type stars .",
    "we , therefore , used the spectral classification of @xcite in this paper .",
    "as discussed below , this property can be used to confirm or identify the spectral classes and even estimate the interstellar extinction in uv wavelengths ( e.g. , the fuv rise ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which can not be inferred from optical and near infrared observations , if the spectral type of the target star is correctly identified because the interstellar extinction is strongly wavelength - dependent over this wavelength range .",
    "first , let us define the spectral slope .",
    "the spectral slope is calculated from a linear fit over the whole wavelength range from 1370  to 1710  , as shown in figure [ fig : slope_ex ] for the example star , hd 214680 .",
    "it is defined as follows : @xmath8 where @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and @xmath11 are the flux values obtained from the linear fit at wavelengths of 1710 , 1370 , and 1540  , respectively .",
    "we obtained the average spectral slope for each stellar spectral type based on the @xcite from b1 to b9 with @xmath120 stars for each spectral type .",
    "e(b - v ) _ colour excess was estimated using the intrinsic colour index _ ( b - v)@xmath12 _ of @xcite and the observed colour index _ ( b - v ) _ of the simbad database .",
    "we selected only those stars with colour excess _",
    "e(b - v ) _",
    "@xmath13 0.05 , corresponding to an optical depth of 0.35 at 1540  , and performed reddening correction using the colour excess .",
    "the extinction law was adopted from @xcite with r@xmath14 = 3.1 .",
    "we compared the spectral slopes estimated from the _ fims _ to those of the _ iue _ and a stellar synthetic model .",
    "the theoretical model spectra were calculated through interpolation on a grid of the kurucz model @xcite using the effective temperature and gravity calibration given in @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig : slope_var ] shows the results of the spectral slopes .",
    "the three spectral slopes estimated from the _ fims _ , _ iue _ , and a theoretical model are in good agreement , indicating that the spectral slope is steeper in earlier spectral types , as expected .",
    "the statistical errors , especially the large ones , may stem from the misidentification of the spectral type .",
    "the sub - classification of the spectral type contributes in part to the error .",
    "a large source of the uncertainty would be the simbad s photometry and colors .",
    "there are additional sources of uncertainty to the spectral slope .",
    "we assumed a constant @xmath15 , which in fact varies from a sightline to sightline , in performing reddening correction .",
    "another non - negligible source might be the uncertainty in the calibration of the effective temperature and gravity .",
    "the calibration used in this paper is based on evolutionary models and thereby subject to their intrinsic errors ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "figure [ fig : extinction ] shows some examples of how the spectral slopes in figure [ fig : slope_var ] can be used for the identification of the spectral type . in figure",
    "[ fig : extinction ] , the black plus ( + ) symbols indicate the spectral slopes before reddening correction and the red cross ( @xmath2 ) symbols indicate those after correction .",
    "the sources in the figure were arbitrarily chosen .",
    "we see that the spectral slopes of hd 65551 , hd 76004 and hd 49643 are consistent with the model spectral slopes when the reddening correction is taken into account . on the other hand ,",
    "the spectral slopes of hd 68895 and hd 39844 are very different from the corresponding model spectral slopes .",
    "the spectral slope of hd 68895 after correction , estimated from the _ fims _ spectrum , is -0.46 while the model spectral slope corresponding to the spectral type of b5v @xcite is -0.41 .",
    "this spectral slope of -0.46 is more consistent with b3v @xcite or b4v than b5v if the reddening correction is correct .",
    "if the spectral type of b5v is correct , the colour excess need to be changed to _ _ e(b - v)__=0.01 , or r@xmath14 should be larger than 3.1 . in the same way",
    ", the spectral slope of hd 39844 indicates that its spectral type is more consistent with b7v or b8v than with the spectral type of b6v @xcite if the interstellar extinction is negligible . on the other hand ,",
    "if the spectral type of b6v is correct , the colour excess needs to be changed to _ _ e(b - v)__=0.08 , or r@xmath14 should be smaller than 3.1 for _ e(b - v ) _ to be less than 0.08 .",
    "we extracted the _ l_-band ( 13701710  ) spectra for 532 stars observed using the _ fims _ during its mission lifetime of one and a half years , which covered approximately 84% of the sky .",
    "of these stars , 323 were also observed by the _ iue _ with higher signal - to - noise ratios than the _ fims _ ; hence , these data were used to validate the _",

    "<S> in this paper , we present a catalogue of the spectra of bright stars observed during the sky survey using the far - ultraviolet imaging spectrograph ( _ fims _ ) , which was designed primarily to observe diffuse emissions . by carefully eliminating the contamination from the diffuse background , </S>",
    "<S> we obtain the spectra of 70 bright stars observed for the first time with a spectral resolution of 23  over the wavelength of 13701710  . </S>",
    "<S> the far - ultraviolet spectra of an additional 139 stars are also extracted with a better spectral resolution and/or higher reliability than those of the previous observations . </S>",
    "<S> the stellar spectral type of the stars presented in the catalogue spans from o9 to a3 . </S>",
    "<S> the method of spectral extraction of the bright stars is validated by comparing the spectra of 323 stars with those of the international ultraviolet explorer ( _ iue _ ) observations .    </S>",
