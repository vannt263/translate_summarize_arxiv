    "* charged higgs search and beyond : * + the discovery of a charged higgs boson at future colliders would be an unambiguous sign of an extended higgs sector .",
    "the production of charged higgs bosons at the tevatron and the lhc will happen mainly via the partonic processes : @xmath2 and @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "other partonic processes like charged higgs pair production ( @xmath4 ) @xcite and associated @xmath0 production ( @xmath5 ) @xcite have also been considered , but they lead to a much smaller rate at these colliders . at an @xmath1 collider",
    "the main production process for charged higgs bosons is pair production ( @xmath6 ) which is mediated mainly via photon- and @xmath7- exchange in the s - channel .",
    "if the collider energy is not sufficient for pair production ( i.e. @xmath8 ) the associated @xmath0 production becomes dominant for @xmath9 . in this case",
    "the signal rate is much smaller because the process is effectively loop - induced .",
    "the methods to discover the charged higgs boson at the lhc seem to be well established by now @xcite .",
    "once it is found , one would like to learn more about the charged higgs boson beyond its mere existence and its mass .",
    "but , the main production processes at lhc are rather insensitive to the underlying model .",
    "more interesting in this respect is the associated @xmath0 production process . at an @xmath1 collider",
    "the process is effectively loop - induced and at hadron colliders the gluon - fusion process is loop - induced .",
    "loop - induced processes depend already at leading order on the virtual particles in the loops .",
    "thus , with a cross section measurement of such a process one would gain information about the underlying model .",
    "[ param ] * mssm parameter scenario : * + we are interested in scenarios which potentially show large effects from virtual squarks and especially from stops .",
    "therefore , the mssm parameter scenario used for the numerical results presented here has a rather low squark mass scale and shows large mixing in the stop sector .",
    "we choose : a ) the common sfermion mass scale @xmath10 , b ) the stop mixing parameter @xmath11 , c ) the supersymmetric higgs mass parameter @xmath12 , d )  the gaugino mass parameters @xmath13 .",
    "the main features of the resulting scenario are the following .",
    "a ) no mass bounds from direct search results are violated and indirect constraints on the parameters coming from requiring vacuum stability and from experimental bounds on the electroweak precision observables are also fulfilled .",
    "b ) the mass of the light stop is of order @xmath14 and there is a large mass splitting between the two stop mass eigenstates .",
    "c ) the stop mixing angle is approximately @xmath15 .",
    "thus maximal mixing occurs , i.e. all entries in the stop mixing matrix have approximately the same magnitude .",
    "d ) the mass of the lightest mssm higgs boson @xmath16 is almost maximal with respect to @xmath17 ( because @xmath18 @xcite ) .",
    "note that this scenario allows for the production of stop pairs at the energy scales considered in the following sections and the decay of the charged higgs into stop and sbottom will be kinematically allowed for @xmath19 .",
    "there are two partonic processes contributing to @xmath0 production at hadron colliders like the lhc . on the one hand",
    "there is the tree - level process @xmath20 annihilation and on the other hand there is the loop - induced gluon fusion process ( see figure [ lhc - hw - fd ] ) .",
    "both processes have been considered already in @xcite , but in the mssm calculation squark loops had been neglected .",
    "the full mssm prediction for the gluon - fusion process appeared much later @xcite .",
    "@xmath20 annihilation has to be considered if the bottom quark is treated as an active flavour in the proton . in figure",
    "[ lhc - hw - fd ] all feynman diagrams contributing on tree - level to the amplitude are displayed .",
    "there are s - channel exchange diagrams for each of the neutral higgs bosons and a t - channel diagram including a virtual top quark .",
    "recently , the qcd corrections to the @xmath20 annihilation process became known @xcite .",
    "the gluon fusion process is mediated by loops of virtual quarks and squarks ( see figure [ lhc - hw - fd ] ) .",
    "thus , the amplitude naturally splits into two subsets , one consisting of the diagrams with quark loops ( thdm amplitude ) and the other consisting of all diagrams with squark loops ( squark amplitude ) .",
    "figure [ lhc - hw - fd ] shows essentially all types of feynman diagrams that contribute to the process in the mssm .",

    "formally , the distributions of bottom quarks and anti - quarks are suppressed by one power of @xmath34 compared to the gluon distribution which is of order one .",
    "this is because the bottom is a heavy quark which does nt have a valence distribution in the proton .",
    "therefore , its distribution is generated mainly by gluon splitting processes . by naively using the bottom quark distribution in order to estimate the hadronic cross section via @xmath33 annihilation",
    "it is well known that one overestimates the true cross section @xcite .",
    "the way to improve the prediction is to include additional processes of the same order in @xmath35 like @xmath36 + c.c . or @xmath37 .",
    "but then a suitable subtraction of configurations with collinear bottom quarks of these additional processes has to be applied in order to avoid double - counting contributions which are already resummed in the bottom quark distribution @xcite . in our analysis",
    "we use for the @xmath33 process the lo cross section with a running bottom mass instead of the pole mass as an approximation to the nlo result @xcite which leads to a considerable reduction of the hadronic cross section . but still , this might be an overestimation .    *",
    "mssm results : * + naturally , the @xmath33 cross section is rather insensitive to the superpartner spectrum as no susy contributions appear at lo .",
    "the gluon fusion process shows , as expected , large sensitivity to the squark spectrum which appears in the loops .",
    "especially , the squark contribution to the amplitude can get large due to threshold effects in the box loops .",
    "a striking feature of the quark loop contribution to the gluon fusion amplitude , already noted in @xcite , is a large destructive interference between quark loops of box- and triangle - type . both partonic processes , @xmath33 annihilation and gluon fusion , are rather sensitive to the neutral higgs sector .",
    "as a consequence , in the thdm the choice of the masses of the neutral higgs bosons can influence the cross section dramatically ( see section [ thdm - lhc ] ) , whereas in the mssm the neutral higgs boson masses are essentially fixed , once values have been assigned to @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "figure [ lhc - hw - plot ] shows the mssm prediction for the hadronic cross section for @xmath0 production at the lhc .",
    "the contributions from @xmath20 annihilation and gluon fusion are displayed separately as a function of the charged higgs mass @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",

    "valid for both cases , is shown .",
    "the gluon fusion process instead is significantly different in the full mssm and the mssm - like thdm .",
    "the cross section via gluon fusion in the full mssm can be up to an order of magnitude larger than in the sthdm in our scenario .",
    "this is mainly due to threshold effects in the box - type squark loops which are not present in the sthdm amplitude .",
    "the effect is maximal , if the production threshold ( @xmath40 ) is somewhat below the position in @xmath41 ( @xmath42 ( here @xmath43 ) ) where the threshold peak in the partonic cross section appears .",
    "this happens in the left plot in figure [ lhc - hw - plot ] for @xmath44 .",
    "for this interesting value of @xmath38 the right plot in figure [ lhc - hw - plot ] shows the @xmath39-dependence .",
    "one can see that the pronounced minimum in the mssm - like thdm has completely disappeared in the full mssm and especially for @xmath39 up to about 15 the cross section for the gluon fusion process has the same order of magnitude as for the @xmath33 annihilation process .",

    "a ) the contributions of neutral higgs s - channel exchange can not decouple from the process , because the masses of the heavy higgs bosons are nearly degenerate .",
    "b ) resonant s - channel higgs exchange is impossible in the mssm , because the threshold @xmath50 is always larger than any of the masses of the neutral higgs bosons ( @xmath51 ) .",
    "c ) therefore , the negative interference between box- and triangle - type quark loops in the gluon fusion amplitude seems to be unavoidable in the mssm .",
    "but this is not true in the general thdm .",
    "as all higgs masses are free parameters , there can be resonant s - channel exchange of neutral higgs bosons .",
    "it is also possible to choose some of the neutral higgs bosons much heavier than the threshold ( @xmath50 ) , thus suppressing their contribution to the amplitude .",
    "thus , in the general thdm the above - mentioned strong negative interference need not be present and therefore the cross section can be much larger than in the mssm .    in figure [ hw - thdm - plot ] one example for the typical behaviour in the general thdm is shown .",
    "we take @xmath52 , @xmath46 and the mssm values for the mass of the lightest higgs @xmath53 and the mixing angle in the higgs sector @xmath54 .",
    "figure [ hw - thdm - plot ] shows a contour plot of the hadronic cross section for @xmath0 production via gluon fusion as a function of the neutral higgs masses @xmath55 and @xmath56 . the point where the scenario coincides with a mssm - like thdm is marked by a red cross ( labelled sthdm ) . in this case",
    "the cross section via gluon fusion is @xmath57 ( via @xmath33 annihilation : @xmath58 ) .",
    "the parameter region displayed in figure [ hw - thdm - plot ] is roughly the region which is compatible with negative direct search results for @xmath59 and @xmath60 bosons and the requirement of tree - level unitarity . within the star - shaped region , bounded by the thick lines in the plot ,",
    "the scenarios are compatible with the measured value of the electroweak rho - parameter .",
    "the cross section shows a steep rise if one of the higgs masses , @xmath55 or @xmath56 , gets bigger than the @xmath0 production threshold which is due to the resonant behavior of the corresponding s - channel exchange diagrams .",
    "but , even without any resonance in the partonic cross section near the @xmath0 threshold the cross section can be up to a factor 500 larger than in the corresponding mssm - like thdm ( e.g. for @xmath61 and @xmath62 we have @xmath63 via gluon fusion plus @xmath64 via @xmath33 annihilation ) .",
    "it seems that some scenarios in the general thdm can be already distinguished from the mssm just by looking at the rate of @xmath0 production .",
