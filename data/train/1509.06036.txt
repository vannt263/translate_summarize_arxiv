    "kinetic theory describes motion which is _ transport dominated _ in the sense that typically the solutions to the kinetic equations correspond to constant velocity , i.e. , _ ballistic _ , motion intercepted by _ collisions _ whose frequency is order one on the kinetic space - time scales . the constant velocity part of the transport , the _",
    "free streaming motion _",
    ", can arise via several different microscopic mechanisms , the obvious case being free motion of classical particles . here , we are interested in evolution of energy density in chains composed out of locally interacting classical particles , in the limit where the interactions are dominated by a stable harmonic potential .",
    "for such models , the energy transport is dominated by the free streaming of _ phonons _ which correspond to eigenmodes of the motion generated by the harmonic potential .",
    "our goal is to derive and study the properties of kinetic theory given by a phonon boltzmann equation .",
    "even with most generous estimates for the terms neglected in its derivation , the boltzmann equation can become an exact description of the energy transport only in a",
    "_ kinetic scaling limit _ which produces a total scale separation between the free streaming motion of phonons and the collisions induced by the perturbation . for the above particle chains this amounts to studying lengths and time intervals both",
    "of which are proportional to @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the strength of the anharmonic perturbation , and then taking the limit @xmath3 .",
    "in particular in one dimension , i.e. , for particle chains , it is difficult to estimate reliably the error terms associated with the approximation of the original motion by the phonon boltzmann equation . at present",
    ", no such full mathematical analysis has been achieved . however , there are instances in which the one - dimensional phonon boltzmann equation has proven to be useful : in section [ sec : kappapinning ] , the thermal conductivity predicted by the boltzmann equation of systems with an anharmonic _ onsite _ potential is compared to numerical simulations , and the results are found to agree within numerical accuracy for sufficiently weak couplings .",
    "although just one example , the agreement is significant since it shows that , under proper conditions , the kinetic theory from the phonon boltzmann equation can produce meaningful predictions even for one - dimensional transport problems . as will be apparent later , computing these predictions requires some additional effort compared to the standard rarefied gas boltzmann equation .",
    "the effort is rewarded in a prediction which has _ no adjustable parameters _ and hence can be compared directly with experiments and numerical simulations .",
    "the drawback of the phonon boltzmann equation is that , _ a priori _ , it only describes the lowest order effects of the perturbation .",
    "hence , it might not capture all processes relevant to the energy transport .",
    "in addition , since it is not known which precise conditions guarantee that the corrections are truly vanishing in the kinetic scaling limit , one has to leave the option open that even the lowest order effects are not being described accurately by the equation .    a discussion about the physical and mathematical conditions under which the phonon boltzmann equation should be an accurate approximation is given in @xcite , while @xcite could serve as a textbook reference on physics of phonons .",
    "the present rigorous results on linear and nonlinear perturbations of wave - like evolution equations support the basic principle that for sufficiently dispersive systems , in particular for crystals in three or higher dimensions , the derivation of the phonon boltzmann equation yields an accurate approximation to the behaviour of the system at kinetic time - scales with weak coupling .",
    "the argument is particularly convincing for spatially homogeneous systems and for linear perturbations such as when the particle masses have a weak random disorder @xcite , and for the closely related quantum models , random schrdinger equation @xcite and the anderson model @xcite .",
    "in addition , it has been proven that the wigner transforms of unperturbed wave - equations do , in great generality , converge to the collisionless boltzmann equation @xcite , although acoustic modes may require somewhat more refined treatment @xcite .",
    "nonlinear perturbations are more intricate , and we refer to @xcite for recent results on the rigorous analysis of their kinetic scaling limits .    quite often the addition of the collision operator to the transport equation leads to loss of `` memory '' at each collision and eventual equilibration via diffusion : this would correspond to normal energy transport by phonons . however ,",
    "if the transport is anomalous , it is highly likely to be reflected also in the solutions of the corresponding kinetic equation .",
    "an example of such behaviour is given by the fpu-@xmath0 chain .",
    "the aim of this contribution is to develop the general kinetic theory of classical particle chains to the point which allows to compare the kinetic theory of normally conducting chains with an anharmonic pinning potential and the anomalously conducting fpu chains .",

    "phonons correspond to eigenmodes of harmonic bravais lattices .",
    "the general case includes multi - component phonon fields which may arise both from the dimensionality of the lattice  the evolution equation could describe _ displacements _ from some reference lattice positions and thus have @xmath5 components in @xmath5 dimensions  or from the reference cell of periodicity containing more than one particle .",
    "an example of the latter is provided by the one - dimensional chain with alternating masses : then the reference system remains invariant only under shifts over two lattices sites which corresponds to a bravais lattice with two particles per cell of periodicity . for notational simplicity ,",
    "let us here only consider the case of one - component classical phonon fields and assume that all particles have a unit mass ( this is always possible to achieve for one - component fields by choosing a suitable time - scale ) .",
    "then the state of the system at time @xmath6 is determined by @xmath7 , @xmath8 , which satisfy the evolution equations @xmath9 the equations are of a hamiltonian form ,",
    "corresponding to the hamiltonian function @xmath10 we suppose that the harmonic interactions have a _",
    "short range_. for instance , only finitely many @xmath11 are different from zero , or @xmath12 decreases exponentially fast to zero as @xmath13 .",
    "the evolution equation ( [ eq : harmev ] ) can be solved by using fourier - transform .",
    "we define the fourier - fields as @xmath14 and @xmath15 . here",
    "@xmath16 where @xmath17 denotes the one - torus which we parametrize using the interval @xmath18 $ ] and then identify its endpoints , @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "the evolution equation for the fourier - fields then reads , in a matrix form , @xmath21 for each @xmath22 , the equation is easily solved by jordan decomposition of the matrix on the right hand side .",
    "this provides two independently evolving eigenmodes @xmath23 , @xmath24 , as long as @xmath25 . for those @xmath22 with @xmath26 ,",
    "the solution is given by constant speed increase : @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "typically , this can happen at most at a finite number of points whose neighbourhoods might require special treatment in the kinetic theory of phonons .",
    "the eigenmode fields @xmath23 , which we call _ phonon modes _ of the harmonic chain , satisfy the evolution equation @xmath29 where @xmath30 .",
    "thus the square root of the fourier - transform of @xmath31 determines the _ dispersion relation _ @xmath32 of the phonons , and we arbitrarily choose the principal branch of the square root so that always @xmath33 .",
    "there are several possible ways to normalize the eigenmodes . here",
    "we employ the following choice , standard to phonon physics , @xmath34    it is straightforward to check that these fields indeed satisfy the evolution equation ( [ eq : atevol ] ) whenever @xmath35 .",
    "in addition , if we choose a solution to ( [ eq : atevol ] ) and then define @xmath36 then @xmath37 yields a solution to ( [ eq : ftharmev ] ) .",
    "given some initial field @xmath38 , the solution of ( [ eq : atevol ] ) is straightforward , yielding @xmath39 .",
    "therefore , if we let @xmath38 to be determined by the initial data @xmath40 , we can now obtain the solution to the original evolution problem ( [ eq : ftharmev ] ) for every @xmath22 for which @xmath25 , just by inserting @xmath39 in ( [ eq : invphonon ] ) .    for later use ,",
    "it is also important to assume that the harmonic interactions are _ stable _ , i.e. , they do not have any solutions which increase exponentially in time . by the above discussion",
    ", this is equivalent to assuming that the fourier - transform of @xmath31 is pointwise non - negative , @xmath41 for all @xmath16 .",
    "a standard example is given by the _",
    "nearest neighbour interactions _ for which @xmath42 if @xmath43 .",
    "a short computation reveals that the only stable nearest neighbour dispersion relations are given by @xmath44 for some @xmath45 , @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "since for phonons we also require that @xmath11 are real , we can also always choose @xmath48 above .",
    "the parameter @xmath49 determines the average angular frequency of the oscillations , the maximum value begin @xmath50 and the minimum @xmath51 . if @xmath52 , the function @xmath53 is a thus an even , real analytic , function .",
    "these systems describe _ optical phonon modes _ , and one can also think of the system as having _ harmonic pinning_. if @xmath54 , it is possible to make a change of variables which reverses its sign to positive : this is achieved with a shift by @xmath20 in the fourier variable , in other words , by using @xmath55 as the new lattice fields . enforcing this convention",
    "has the benefit that then the slowest evolving fields are also spatially slowly varying , corresponding to small values of @xmath22 .",
    "therefore , we only consider the cases @xmath48 and @xmath56 in the following , excluding also the degenerate constant dispersion relation corresponding to @xmath57 .    if @xmath58 one has @xmath59 , with an @xmath60-singularity near origin .",
    "these systems describe _ acoustic phonon modes _ and the seemingly innocuous singularity has important implications for the energy transport properties of the system .",
    "the fpu - chains belong to this category .    finally , let us point out that in the stable case , @xmath61 , the phonon fields defined by ( [ eq : deffta ] ) are directly connected to the energy of the harmonic system by @xmath62 .",
    "hence , in analogy to quantum mechanics , the complex phonon fields @xmath23 can be thought of as wave functions of phonons each of which carries an energy @xmath53",
    ".      for notational simplicity , the above discussion uses formally an infinite lattice setup .",
    "its proper interpretation is to consider the infinite system to be an approximation for a finite , but large system .",
    "this identification has an important mathematical consequence : the standard methods of @xmath63-spaces do not immediately apply to the infinite system .",
    "for instance , typical samples from infinite volume gibbs states are only logarithmically bounded at infinity @xcite .",
    "hence , should the need arise , it is better to go back to the finite systems to resolve any possible issues about existence of solutions or to handle singularities .",
    "( for discussion about the existence and properties of the infinite volume dynamics , see @xcite . )    in a finite system , the choice of boundary conditions begins to play a role .",
    "the above computations involving fourier - transforms can be given an exact correspondence by choosing a box with periodic boundary conditions . in this case",
    ", the wave evolution can move energy around the lattice unimpeded , as indicated by the solutions which are given by multiplication operators in the fourier - space .",
    "one can find more details about the correspondence , for instance , in @xcite .",
    "if the finite lattice does not have periodic boundary conditions , the boundaries will influence the transport of phonons . for boundary conditions which preserve energy , such as dirichlet and neumann ,",
    "the effect can be understood as a reflection of phonons at the boundary .",
    "it is also possible to combine these with partial periodic transmission through the boundary .",
    "the effect of standard heat baths , such as langevin heat baths , on the kinetic equations is more difficult to analyse .",
    "these will introduce also absorption and source terms to the phonon evolution equations , but since the heat baths are typically acting only on a few particles of the chain , their coupling to the wave evolution is nontrivial and somewhat singular .",
    "( in general , it is difficult to affect the long wavelength part of the evolution by any local change to the system . ) unfortunately , a systematic analysis of these effects appears to be missing from the current literature .      for",
    "the discussion about the effect of local nonlinear perturbations to the above wave equation , let us introduce , in addition to the harmonic coupling function @xmath64 , its second and third polynomial counterparts , @xmath65 and @xmath66 .",
    "these are assumed to be `` small '' in the sense that for large microscopic times the evolution is dominated by the linear term .",
    "explicitly , we take the perturbed evolution equations to be @xmath67 this corresponds to hamiltonian evolution with the interaction potential @xmath68 supposing , as we will do here , that the following symmetries hold : @xmath69 the symmetries arise from assuming that the coefficients correspond to a generic label - exchange symmetric , translation invariant potential .",
    "we have also used here the fact that any permutation can be expressed as a product of adjacent transpositions .",
    "therefore , it suffices to check symmetry with respect to the transpositions to get full permutation invariance .    for example , the standard fpu - chain is given by @xmath70 and it satisfies the evolution equation @xmath71 .",
    "a brief computation , using the periodicity , shows that the fpu chain corresponds to choosing the coefficient functions above so that their nonzero values are @xmath72 for later use , let us also record their fourier - transforms . using the shorthand notations @xmath73 , @xmath74 , they are given by @xmath75       = -\\lambda_4 2 ^ 4 \\sin \\frac{p_1+p_2+p_3}{2 } \\prod_{\\ell=1}^3 \\sin \\frac{p_\\ell}{2 } \\ , .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    onsite perturbations also belong to the above category .",
    "for instance , @xmath76 has @xmath77 both fourier - transforms are thus constant : @xmath78 and @xmath79 .",
    "after these examples , let us come back to the general case , equations ( [ eq : anharmev ] ) .",
    "taking a fourier - transform yields @xmath80 where we have denoted the periodic @xmath81-function by @xmath82 .",
    "we will drop the subscript in the following and merely use @xmath81 .",
    "this implies that the phonon fields , defined still by ( [ eq : deffta ] ) , now satisfy the evolution equation @xmath83 where the interaction amplitude functions are @xmath84 since the @xmath81-function enforces the sum of the integration variables to be equal to @xmath85 , we can thus employ the following definitions for the fpu - chains @xmath86 where @xmath87 for @xmath88 .    to study energy transport ,",
    "it is necessary to split the total energy into local components .",
    "the harmonic energy , corresponding to the energy of free phonons , is most conveniently distributed using a form which is symmetric in fourier - space . by the definition ( [ eq : deffta ] ) , we have for any @xmath89 @xmath90 thus , if we denote the inverse fourier transform of @xmath32 by @xmath91 , we can define @xmath92 where @xmath93 .",
    "since @xmath32 is real and symmetric , we have here @xmath94 .",
    "thus @xmath95 and @xmath96 is equal to the harmonic part of the total energy , to @xmath97 .",
    "thus this choice allows distributing the positive total harmonic energy into positive contributions localized at each lattice site .    for the anharmonic terms of the potential energy we use the form suggested by the notation in ( [ eq : defvtot ] ) , and define the local energy at site @xmath98 by @xmath99 then clearly @xmath100 , and and @xmath101 is a local function at @xmath98 ( it depends mainly on fields near the point @xmath98 ) .",
    "in addition , @xmath101 is translated just like the fields if these are shifted by @xmath102 : if we choose some @xmath103 and define @xmath104 and @xmath105 , then @xmath106 .",
    "there are various possible choices for how to split the total energy into local energy density .",
    "the above definition of energy density is perhaps not the most standard one , but it has two appealing features for those systems which are dominated by phonon transport .",
    "first , it has simple algebraic dependence on the phonon eigenmode fields .",
    "secondly , its dependence on the position variable @xmath98 is located entirely in the fourier - factor .",
    "this allows a definition of a current observable with a simple dependence on the particle interactions and the simplest choice for the associate discrete derivative .",
    "explicitly , consider some @xmath107 and any @xmath108 with @xmath109 .",
    "setting @xmath110 , we then have @xmath111 and @xmath112   \\ , .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] hence , if we define @xmath113 by replacing in ( [ eq : phononendens ] ) every factor `` @xmath114 '' , where @xmath115 , by `` @xmath116 '' , we have for all @xmath108 with @xmath109 that @xmath117 since @xmath118 are arbitrary , we can interpret @xmath119 as the energy flux from site @xmath98 to @xmath120 at time @xmath6 .",
    "to be precise , the above construction can only be used inside the integral if @xmath121 . to see why the resulting current observable still works , let us for the moment regularize the system by replacing the infinite lattice @xmath122 by a finite periodic lattice of length @xmath123 .",
    "then @xmath124 , and either @xmath125 or the distance of @xmath126 from @xmath122 is at least @xmath127 .",
    "let us thus separate all terms with @xmath128 in the definition of @xmath101 , and use the periodic identification .",
    "then the terms correspond to @xmath129 . since for every @xmath98 on the periodic lattice @xmath130 , these terms sum to @xmath131 , i.e. , to the total energy density . by conservation of energy , these terms do not contribute to @xmath132 .",
    "the remaining terms converge to the claimed result as @xmath133 , provided that the integrals over @xmath134 are understood as principal value integrals around the subset with @xmath129 .",
    "in summary , the definition @xmath135 yields a current observable associated to the energy density ( [ eq : phononendens ] ) which satisfies the lattice continuity equation ( [ eq : latticecont ] ) .",
    "let us point out that no spurious imaginary part is created by this choice : since @xmath136 , @xmath137 , for all @xmath138 , and @xmath139 , we have always @xmath140 and hence the current observable is real - valued .",
    "we may also simplify the prefactor above by using @xmath141 .",
    "the above current observable also behaves as expected with respect to spatial translations of the lattice .",
    "if we choose some @xmath103 and define @xmath104 and @xmath105 , then the @xmath142-field of the translated configuration @xmath143 satisfies @xmath144 . thus each of the three terms in the sum defining the current in ( [ eq : defencurrent ] ) will acquire a factor @xmath145 with @xmath146 .",
    "hence , the current of the translated configuration satisfies @xmath147 , similarly to what was proven earlier for the energy density observables @xmath101 .",
    "we consider the above evolution equation with random initial data .",
    "the distribution of initial data plays as important a role as the choice of the coupling functions .",
    "for instance , there always are degenerate initial data which do not thermalize .",
    "assume , for instance , that @xmath148 is chosen as any local minimum or maximum configuration of the potential @xmath149 and let the particles be initially at rest , @xmath150 .",
    "since then @xmath151 this configuration is a stationary solution of the evolution equations .",
    "however , it need not be stable , and it can well happen that even a minute perturbation of the initial data will take the asymptotic state of the system far from the original stationary state .    on the other hand , for normally conducting systems sufficiently chaotic initial data should lead to thermalization of the state . the precise mechanism and classification of",
    "what kind of initial data should have this property , and in which precise mathematical sense , is a long - standing open problem in mathematical physics . the most difficult part of the problem seems to be to control the beginning of the thermalization process , the _ microscopic thermalization _ , where the state of the system approaches local stationarity .",
    "however , many important physical properties of the system do not require full understanding of the thermalization process .",
    "for instance , for systems with normal heat conduction , the green  kubo formula allows to compute the thermal conductivity of the system . as shown in the next subsection ,",
    "the formula involves studying the time - correlations of the system _ starting it from a thermal equilibrium state _ or , equivalently , to study the evolution of correlation functions for small perturbations of the equilibrium state .",
    "hence , thermal equilibrium states and their perturbations form an important class of initial data , and our assumptions should allow for at least these .",
    "to arrive at the kinetic theory of phonons , we need to make some rather specific assumptions about the initial data .",
    "the principle here is that the states are chosen to mimic states produced by typical microscopic time - averages .",
    "note that this concept involves a choice of scale , the time - scale over which the time - averages are taken .",
    "these questions touch upon the tough question of microscopic thermalization , and we do not wish to speculate further about them here . instead , let us postulate a number of assumptions on the initial data based on reasonable assumptions about the physical characteristics of the time evolution .",
    "we assume here that the initial data for the system has the following properties .    1 .",
    "* random : * we suppose that the initial data @xmath152 is randomly distributed .",
    "the initial randomness makes also the configurations @xmath7 at later times random variables .",
    "* chaotic : * we suppose that initial distribution of particles in regions which are far apart are almost independent .",
    "more precisely , we suppose that all correlation functions of the initial data decay fast ( on the microscopic scale ) . the speed is assumed to be at least so fast that the correlation functions are @xmath153-summable .",
    "* spatially homogenized : * we assume that there is a scale @xmath154 , which is large in microscopic units , such that the correlation functions are nearly invariant under translations of lengths less than @xmath154 .",
    "the randomness in the initial data makes also the phonon fields @xmath23 random variables . in principle",
    ", the field is not defined for @xmath22 such that @xmath155 , but we assume these to have been suitably regularized .",
    "consider for instance the case in which the interactions depend only on the differences @xmath156 , such as for the fpu - beta chains .",
    "given any initial data ( on a finite periodic chain ) , we can regularize it before defining the phonon fields without altering the evolution equations in any way .",
    "we move from @xmath157 to @xmath143 by first setting @xmath158 and @xmath159 , and then we define @xmath160 and @xmath161 . under these assumptions ,",
    "the total momentum is conserved , and thus @xmath162 for all @xmath6 .",
    "in addition , @xmath163 are a solution to the original evolution equations .",
    "we take @xmath23 to be defined via these regularized fields which guarantees that @xmath164 for all @xmath6 .",
    "as we are interested in the evolution of the energy density ( [ eq : phononendens ] ) , it suffices to study the correlation functions of @xmath23 .",
    "for instance , to study the energy density averaged over the initial data , one needs the correlation functions up to order @xmath165 .    to control the correlation functions of the above type of chaotic , spatially homogenized states , it is often better to consider the cumulants of the fields rather than their moments .",
    "for instance , consider the field @xmath166 at two points @xmath167 which are far apart . by the chaoticity assumption",
    ", then @xmath168 and @xmath169 should be nearly independent random variables , and hence @xmath170 , for @xmath171 . unless one of the particles is frozen to its initial position ,",
    "these moments are not zero .",
    "however , the corresponding cumulant is then nearly zero whenever both @xmath171 .",
    "hence , for two asymptotically independent regions , it is the cumulants , not moments , which will vanish in the limit of taking the regions infinitely far from each other .",
    "we consider here only initial states for which this decay is absolutely square summable in space , `` @xmath153-clustering '' for short .",
    "this particular assumption allows for an easy identification of the ( distribution type ) singularities of the fourier - transform for any spatially homogeneous initial data .    to make the computations manageable",
    ", we rely here on the notations and basic results used in @xcite .",

    "we employ here the following basic relations between the above constructions .",
    "the proofs of these results can be found in many sources , in particular , in @xcite using the above notations .",

    "blocks_. we also recall that the cumulants are permutation invariant and multilinear , which means that they are linear in each of the arguments separately .",

    "we assume that we are working in a regime in which these terms indeed can be neglected .",
    "hence , instead of trying to find out under which conditions this would work for our particle chains , we start from the homogeneous boltzmann equation and proceed to study its solutions to obtain predictions which can later be compared with other results on the chains , such as computer simulations .",

    "these subtleties are also reflected in the boltzmann collision operator : the two @xmath81-functions need to be carefully integrated over before one can use the equation . in the well - studied continuum setup of boltzmann equations , the dispersion relation is given by @xmath417 , @xmath418 , and the integral contains @xmath419 which can be explicitly integrated over , yielding the `` standard '' rarefied gas collision operator .",
    "for a lattice system , the solutions to @xmath416 are not so easy to handle . as we will show below , there are however explicit solutions for the one - dimensional nearest neighbour dispersion relation , relevant to the fpu chains .",
    "after the solution manifold has been found , one still needs to choose some parametrization of the manifold to integrate over the energy conservation @xmath81-function , since this will yield an additional factor to the remaining integrand .",
    "in fact , even at this part of the procedure , some care is needed since the _ trivial solutions _ to the collisional constraints , to be discussed later , do not contribute to the total collision operator but would result in infinite factors if integrated over using the above rule .",
    "hence , the trivial solutions need to be removed from the solution manifold before integrating out the collisional constraint @xmath81-functions .",
    "we begin with a result which shows that nearest neighbour dispersion relations are , in fact , somewhat pathological : they suppress all collisions involving three phonons .",

    "therefore , for the fpu - chains , the lowest order kinetic theory would imply using @xmath420 .",
    "the above argument straightforwardly generalizes to higher dimensions . as shown in appendix 18.1 of @xcite ,",
    "also higher dimensional nearest neighbour dispersion relations with pinning have no solutions to the constraints in the three - phonon collision operator and , hence , @xmath420 .",

    "then @xmath475 by the estimates derived in section [ sec : c3iszero ] , we then have @xmath476 uniformly in the case with pinning . in addition , if @xmath469 , the only way to get @xmath477 is that both of the terms above are zero , which happens only if @xmath447 or @xmath478 , _ and _ @xmath448 or @xmath479 , i.e. , @xmath480 .",
    "this implies that the only solutions to @xmath481 are the _ trivial solutions _ where two of the wave numbers @xmath482 are zero and the remaining one is equal to @xmath85 .",

    "then only one of @xmath484 is negative ; for notational simplicity let us suppose it is @xmath485 ( the other cases can then be obtained by permutation of the indices ) .",
    "the momentum conservation implies then that @xmath486 , and hence @xmath487 thus @xmath477 only for the trivial solution in the unpinned case , namely , if @xmath478 and @xmath488 .",
    "the remaining sign - combinations have @xmath489 , i.e. , the polarization of phonons is preserved in the collision .",
    "these are also called collisions which _ conserve the phonon number_. from the above results we can already conclude that every term in the collision operator which is not phonon number conserving has only trivial solutions to the energy constraint , and these solutions all require that two of the @xmath490 , @xmath74 , are equal to zero and the last one is equal to @xmath85 .",
    "in particular , there are no trivial solutions in the pinned case , so these can again be safely neglected .",
    "the same holds for the fpu chains , due to the prefactor @xmath491 , and since the solution involves a two - dimensional integral and an integrand which has only a point - singularity . to have more convincing an argument",

    "it probably comes as no surprise that the precise analysis of the semigroup generated by @xmath855 gets rather technical .",
    "however , this has been done in @xcite , and let us only repeat the main conclusions from the analysis here .",
    "unlike for the onsite anharmonic perturbation , the relaxation time for the fpu models is finite , and as the above formula shows , the operator @xmath855 can be written in the standard form @xmath856 where @xmath857 is a multiplication operator and @xmath858 is an integral operator .",

    "* lemma 4.1 ) that the function @xmath859 is continuous and can be bounded from above and below by @xmath860 . in particular @xmath861 and ,",
    "consequently , the operator @xmath855 has no spectral gap .    in kinetic theory ,",
    "it is a common practice to use the _ relaxation time approximation _ to approximate the linearized boltzmann evolution . in our case",
    ", this amounts to dropping the operator @xmath862 , i.e. , approximating @xmath863 since @xmath864 , the decay of the relaxation time approximation is now entirely determined by the values of the potential near zero .",
    "the above bounds imply that @xmath865 , and thus the relaxation time approximation predicts @xmath866 for large @xmath6 .",
    "( to our knowledge , this decay of the relaxation time approximation was first as derived in @xcite . )    however , the contribution arising from adding the integral operator @xmath862 is also singular , and more careful study is required to conclude that the relaxation time prediction continues to hold for the full semigroup",
    ". fortunately , the above straightforward estimate gives the correct decay speed : it was shown in @xcite that the resolvent of the semigroup satisfies @xmath867 where the first term is identical to the relaxation time approximation , and behaves as @xmath868 for small @xmath692 .",
    "the second and third term are @xmath869 for any @xmath692 . although also this second contribution is divergent , the first term is dominant , and thus we confirm the prediction of the relaxation time approximation in this particular case .",
    "even the exact asymptotics can be found for this particular choice . applying ( * ? ? ?",
    "* corollary 2.6 ) we find that the kinetic theory predicts for times with @xmath870 , and for sufficiently small couplings @xmath871 and @xmath742 , @xmath872 here @xmath873 is an explicit numerical constant .",
    "evaluation of the gamma - function and the integrals defining the constant `` @xmath874 '' in ( 6.14 ) and ( 4.7 ) of @xcite yields a numerical approximation @xmath875 .",
    "of course , for much longer than kinetic times , the terms neglected in the derivation of the boltzmann equation might become important and alter the asymptotic decay .",
    "the above results also imply that , on the kinetic time scale , the energy spread is superdiffusive : the quadratic energy spread observable discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : gkformula ] should then be increasing as @xmath876 .",
    "the energy spread has been analysed in more detail in @xcite .",
    "the authors study the time evolution of _ inhomogeneous _ perturbations around a given thermal equilibrium state .",
    "this results in an evolution equation which corresponds to the phonon boltzmann evolution where the nonlinear collision operator has been replaced by the above linearized operator .",
    "explicitly , the perturbation @xmath877 , defined via @xmath878 , evolves then by @xmath879 the result concerns @xmath220-integrable initial data varying at a scale @xmath154 , with @xmath757 small .",
    "it is shown that for sufficiently long times , the solution then first thermalizes in the @xmath22-variable , which by the definition of @xmath666 implies that it becomes independent of @xmath22 .",
    "diffusive relaxation in the spatial variable would then mean that at a time scale @xmath880 the perturbation follows the heat equation @xmath881 , with @xmath882 .",
    "however , this does not occur here : instead , it is shown that at the time scale @xmath883 the perturbation satisfies a fractional diffusion equation @xmath884 , with @xmath882 .",
    "this corresponds to a superdiffusive relaxation of the initial perturbation .",
    "moreover , the fractional diffusion spreads local perturbations at time @xmath6 only up to distances @xmath885 .",
    "this is in apparent contradiction with the earlier claim that @xmath876 which would indicate that the spatial spread occurs at a speed @xmath886 , i.e. , faster than predicted by the fractional diffusion equation .",
    "the resolution lies in the tail behaviour of solutions to the fractional diffusion equation .",
    "let us conclude the section with a somewhat heuristic argument which would explain the above results . by using fourier - transform and a simple scaling argument",
    ", one finds that the solution to @xmath884 , with an initial data @xmath849 , is given by a convolution of @xmath849 with an integral kernel @xmath887 which satisfies a scaling relation @xmath888 where @xmath889 . unlike the gaussian heat kernel in ( [ eq : gausssol ] ) , the function @xmath292 is merely polynomially decreasing , with @xmath890 decaying as @xmath891 for large @xmath892 ( the power @xmath893 is obtained by evaluating @xmath894 ) .",
    "thus @xmath895 , and the quadratic spread from fractional diffusion becomes immediately infinite , even if it is initially finite .",
    "however , on the microscopic scale , the velocities of the ballistic harmonic evolution are bounded from above , and this will eventually cut off the above decay , and change it from the above powerlaw decay to an exponentially fast decay at spatial distances @xmath269 from the source .",
    "therefore , we would expect that the true microscopic distribution of an initially local perturbation at a large time @xmath6 is @xmath896 for distances @xmath897 , it is @xmath898 for @xmath899 between @xmath900 and @xmath269 , and it becomes exponentially decreasing for distances larger than @xmath269 . for such functions , the value of @xmath270 is entirely dominated by the midscale powerlaw tail which yields a term @xmath901 , just as we obtained from the kinetic prediction for the green  kubo correlation function using the linearized boltzmann equation .",
    "as the last two explicit examples show , kinetic theory of phonons is capable of uncovering detailed information about the decay of time - correlations and , via the green  kubo formula , about the thermal conductivities of classical particle chains .",
    "this is somewhat surprising , considering the various mathematical problems and uncertainties discovered along the way to the phonon boltzmann equation and even in its analysis .",
    "however , the agreement between the kinetic prediction and numerical simulations for thermal conductivities in chains with anharmonic pinning , and the discovery of anomalous energy transport by fractional brownian motion from the linearized boltzmann equation in the fpu-@xmath0 chains , present a strong case in favour of looking for further applications of the phonon boltzmann equations , even in the somewhat degenerate one - dimensional case .",
    "after all , it is at present one of the very few general tools which allow computing the dependence of the thermal conduction properties on the parameters of the microscopic evolution directly , without introduction of additional fitting parameters .",
    "we have also seen that some care is needed in the application of the phonon boltzmann equation .",
    "most importantly , the equation is closely tied to the scales on which the free streaming of phonons _ begins _ to alter its character due to the collisions .",
    "hence , it describes the evolution up to the kinetic time - scale only , and it is possible that further changes are found at larger time - scales .",
    "nevertheless , since the h - theorem implies that solutions to the kinetic equation push the system towards thermal equilibrium states , drastic changes in the character of the evolution should be the exception , not the rule .",
    "the evaluation of the decay of green  kubo correlation functions is one of the robust applications of kinetic theory , and the thermal conductivity obtained by the perturbation procedure recalled here should in general yield its leading behaviour in the limit of weak perturbations .",
    "however , as a warning about the standard procedure , let us stress that the commonly used relaxation time approximation of the linearized collision operator is _ only _ an order - of - magnitude estimate of the real kinetic prediction which involves inverting the full linearized operator . in the pinned case , we found that the relaxation time approximation predicts zero thermal conductivity .",
    "this turned out to be misleading since already the straightforward jensen bound for the full inverse proves that the kinetic prediction for the conductivity is non - zero .",
    "in contrast , for the anomalous conduction in the fpu-@xmath0 chain the relaxation time approximation does capture the correct asymptotic decay of the kinetic prediction .",
    "one major open question in the kinetic theory of phonons , and in fact of nonlinearity perturbed systems in general , is the precise manner of handling spatially inhomogeneous perturbations .",
    "the standard boltzmann transport term , appearing on the left hand side of ( [ eq : inhomogboltzfpu ] ) , might require adjusting to capture all effects relevant to the transport .",
    "one such example often found in the literature is an addition of a vlasov - type term .",
    "for which systems , under which time - scales , and for which initial data such corrections are necessary , remains unresolved at the moment .    one benefit from a better understanding of the behaviour of inhomogeneous perturbations could be a first - principles derivation of fluctuating hydrodynamics for these systems , including the precise dependence of its parameters on the microscopic evolution , in the limit of weak couplings .",
    "the application of fluctuating hydrodynamics to the transport in one - dimensional particle chains has been discussed in @xcite and reviewed in @xcite .",
    "it appears to be the first model which is able to describe the anomalous transport in one - dimensional particle chains fully in agreement with computer simulations of the spread of localized perturbations .",
    "connecting it directly to the microscopic dynamics would be a breakthrough in understanding the microscopic origin and precise nature of transport in crystalline structures , such as the present particle chains .",
    "kinetic theory , the phonon boltzmann equation in particular , could well provide some of the missing steps into this direction .",
