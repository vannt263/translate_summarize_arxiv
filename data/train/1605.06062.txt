    "over the last years , progress in colloidal chemistry has enabled the synthesis of a wide variety of particles , such as spheres , cubes , tetrapods , platelets with different shapes etc . @xcite . in the latter category ,",
    "some thinner particles do not remain flat , but rather develop a more or less pronounced curvature @xcite , and in some extreme cases can even roll up in scrolls @xcite . as further examples , small building blocks ( hybrid nanoparticles @xcite or proteins @xcite )",
    "assemble into incomplete cylindrical or spherical shells . in all of these cases ,",
    "the final objects can be described as curved plates , without however reaching full spherical or cylindrical symmetry .    due to the typical distances involved , small - angle scattering ( sas )",
    "is very well adapted to characterizing such objects .",
    "with respect to more direct techniques such as transmission electron microscopy , sas has the advantage of intrinsically performing an average over a large number of objects ( and thus of being sensitive to the sample statistics ) and of being amenable to time - resolved in - situ studies , which can provide valuable information on the kinetics of various processes ( e.g. of particle synthesis ) .",
    "calculating the form factor of colloidal objects is an essential pre - requisite to interpreting their sas signal .",
    "although analytical expressions exist for some shapes @xcite , the procedure is rendered cumbersome by the need to integrate over all particle orientations for each value of the scattering vector .",
    "a general formalism was developed long ago @xcite that expands the density distribution over the spherical harmonics and takes advantage of their integration properties to express the scattered intensity as a sum over a function basis .",
    "this method , used mainly for biomolecules in solution , considers a generic three - dimensional distribution .",
    "alternative approaches rely on calculating the correlation function of the object in drect space and then converting to reciprocal space @xcite . in this paper ,",
    "i particularize the approach of stuhrmann and svergun to particles that can be modeled as curved plates , with constant ( or almost constant ) curvature over the entire object .",
    "this strategy considerably simplifies the calculations as well as the numerical implementation of the model and is developed both for curvature along one direction ( cylindrical symmetry ) and for isotropic curvature ( spherical symmetry ) .",
    "the first case applies to the rolled - up nanoplatelets discussed above , while the second one can describe , for instance , the intermediates that make up a viral capsid @xcite .    in the following",
    ", i always assume that the solutions are dilute enough for particle interactions to be negligible ( the structure factor always equals 1 ) and that the particles are isotropically oriented , i.e. without a preferential direction . in this case , the intensity as a function of the scattering vector @xmath0 is proportional to the orientationally averaged form factor @xmath1 to be obtained below .",
    "the cylindrical and spherical cases will be denoted by subscripts @xmath2 and @xmath3 , respectively .",
    "we assume that the density distribution can be separated in a contribution in the @xmath4 plane and along the polar axis @xmath5 : @xmath6 .",
    "the two - dimensional fourier transform of the in - plane part is : @xmath7 that we will expand over the basis of harmonic functions @xcite : @xmath8    when modelling the sas signal from the particles , we will only need the rotational average ( in the @xmath9 plane ) of the squared modulus of @xmath10 : @xmath11 which must be further combined with the fourier transform of @xmath12 , given by : @xmath13 by an average over the polar angle @xmath14 : @xmath15 where @xmath16 and @xmath17 .      in spherical coordinates ,",
    "the fourier transform of a function @xmath18 , with @xmath19 is : @xmath20 if @xmath18 can be separated into a radial part and one that only depends on the solid angle @xmath21 : @xmath22 we can expand the latter over the spherical harmonics @xmath23 , that we define as in   3.5 of @xcite .",

    "we consider a rolled - up sheet as in figure  [ fig : scroll_diag ] .",
    "its thickness @xmath34 is constant and negligible with respect to the other dimensions in the problem .",
    "we assume that the section of the object in the @xmath4 ( or @xmath9 ) plane is a spiral , i.e. it can be written as @xmath47 , with @xmath48 a monotonously increasing differentiable function .",
    "this condition implies that the object does not `` double back '' on itself , in radius or in angle .    in the coordinate system ( @xmath49 ) , with @xmath3 the local tangent and @xmath50 the normal to the curve ( see figure  [ fig : scroll_geom ] ) ,",

    "the coefficients are simply : @xmath60    in view of the applications , we also consider the case of a finite - thickness homogeneous shell : @xmath61 for @xmath62 ( with @xmath63 ) and zero elsewhere .",

    "the components @xmath71 only depend on @xmath72 and @xmath73 and can be precomputed and stored for further use if these parameters remain constant .",
    "let us now consider some examples . for plates (   [ sec : bending ] ) and spherical caps (   [ sec : sphercap ] ) we will compute the form factor of an object with constant volume and increasing curvature ; this is useful for determining the point at which the curved - object model starts to differ from the flat - object approximation .",
    "we will also discuss scrolls whose section is a logarithmic spiral . in this particular case , the integral has an analytical expression in terms of regularized hypergeometric functions .",

    "the section of the tile is shown in the inset .",
    "the intensity in the limiting case @xmath79 was evaluated directly from the fourier transform of the object , without expanding in the components .",
    "clearly , the effect of curvature on the scattering signal is only important for strongly curved plates , with a curvature radius @xmath36 smaller than about half the length @xmath74 .",

    "the coefficients have a closed expression involving the regularized hypergeometric function : @xmath86    in practice , a few ( @xmath87 less than ten ) coefficients suffice for an accurate determination of the in - plane average : @xmath88 as illustrated in figure  [ fig : logspiral ] .",
    "a particularly simple case of a spherical patch is the polar cap : @xmath89 for @xmath90 and 0 otherwise , with no dependence on @xmath91 .",
    "this type of object was used to model the shape of an intermediate in the assembly of bacteriophage procapsid @xcite .",
    "the authors computed numerically the distance distributions ( in real space ) and obtained the scattering curves by a fourier transform .    in our approach",
