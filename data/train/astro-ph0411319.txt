    "stephan s quintet ( hereafter sq ) includes ngc  7317 ( e ) , binary galaxies ngc  7318a ( e ) and ngc  7318b ( sbc pec ) , sy2 galaxy ngc  7319 ( sbc pec ) , and the foreground galaxy ngc  7320 ( sd ) .",
    "two very long parallel optical tidal tails ( @xmath11 kpc ; arp & kormendy 1972 ) extend from the south end of ngc  7319 toward another galaxy ngc  7320c on the east of sq . the hi observations ( shostak et al . 1984 ;",
    "williams et al .",
    "2002 , hereafter w02 ) show hi tails following the optical tails .",
    "a large scale shock front ( @xmath1240 kpc ) in the intragroup medium ( igm ) between ngc  7319 and ngc  7318b was first discovered by allen & hartsuiker ( 1972 ) as a radio emission ridge , then confirmed by high resolution x - ray maps ( trinchieri et al .",
    "moles et al . ( 1997 , hereafter m97 ) suggested a two - intruders scenario for the history of sq : an old intruder ( ngc  7320c ) stripped most of the gas from group members , and a new intruder ( ngc  7318b ) is currently colliding with this gas and triggered the large scale shock .",
    "there are still many uncertainties about this scenario .",
    "these include the question whether both optical tails , one of age @xmath13 yrs ( young tail ) and another of age @xmath14  @xmath15 yrs ( old tail ) , are triggered by two passages of the same galaxy ngc  7320c over ngc  7319 ( m97 ) .",
    "also , based on new hi maps which show that the hi in the region occupied by ngc  7318b is clearly separated into two clumps with distinctively different velocities , w02 challenged the conclusion that ngc  7318b was _ not _ affected by interaction until its collision with sq starting about @xmath16 yrs ago ( s01 ) .    -0.3",
    "cm    -0.8 cm    the star formation activity in sq is apparently very much influenced by the interactions .",
    "the most spectacular star formation region in sq is the igm starburst sq - a , which is associated with a bright mir ( 15@xmath17 ) source ( xu et al .",
    "1999 , hearafter x99 ) just beyond the northern tip of the shock front .",
    "it is triggered by the same ngc  7318b / igm collision that triggered the shock ( xu et al .",
    "2003 , hearafter x03 ) .",
    "the young tail , the brighter one among the two optical tails , is also active in star formation .",
    "hunsberger et al .",
    "( 1996 ) found 13 tidal dwarf galaxy candidates along this tail .",
    "a bright hii region ( sq - b ) is detect in both h@xmath5 ( arp 1973 ) and mir ( x99 ) .",
    "recently , mendes de oliveira et al .",
    "( 2004 , hereafter mdo04 ) discovered four intergalactic hii regions in a region north of the young tail , possibly associated with the stripped ism of ngc  7319 ( s01 ) .",
    "the h@xmath5 observations ( arp 1973 ; vilchez & iglesias - pramo 1998 ; plana et al .",
    "1999 ; s01 ) reveal numerous huge hii regions along several arms of ngc  7318b .",
    "hunsberger et al .",
    "( 1996 ) , iglesias - pramo & vilchez ( 2001 ) , and mendes de oliveira et al .",
    "( 2001 ) classified them as tidal dwarf galaxy candidates , though s01 argued that the crossing time of ngc  7318b ( @xmath18 yrs ) is too short for any tidal effects .",
    "there has been no estimate of the total star formation rate in sq in the literature .",
    "therefore it is not clear whether the overall star formation activity is enhanced by the interactions .",
    "also , because a clear picture for the interaction history of sq is still missing , most results in the literature linking the star formation activity to interactions in sq were at best suggestive .",
    "in this letter we present the first uv images of sq obtained using galex ( martin et al .",
    "the galex observations are sensitive to very low levels of star formation averaged over @xmath13 yrs , the time scale of the tidal effects .",
    "this enables the first quantitative study on the overall star formation and its distribution in sq .",
    "comparisons between the uv , optical , hi , and the emission in other wavebands put new constraints on the star formation history and on the relation between star formation and galaxy - galaxy interaction .",
    "sq was observed by galex on 2003 - 08 - 23 , 2003 - 09 - 05 and 2003 - 09 - 06 in 5 orbits with total exposure time of 3327s .",
    "data reduction was done using standard galex pipeline ( ir0.2 calibration , morrissey et al .",
    "the r.m.s noise is 27.65 mag arcsec@xmath19 and 28.11 mag arcsec@xmath19 in the fuv ( 1530 ) and nuv ( 2310 ) , respectively .",
    "the uv magnitudes are in the ab system .",
    "the fwhm of the fuv beam is 4@xmath20.8 , and that of the nuv beam 7@xmath20.3 .    -0.5",
    "cm    the galex image ( fig.1a ) looks very different from the optical image ( fig.1b ) .",
    "the foreground sd galaxy ngc  7320 is the most prominent uv source , but as ngc  7320 is not a member of sq we do not discuss it further .",
    "a striking feature of the uv emission is that there are large regions that do not coincide with significant optical light from the galaxies or optically detected tidal features . in the merger which gives rise to the antennae ( hibbard et al .",
    "2004 ) the uv emission is seen to follow the tidal tails and merger body closely , while being of @xmath21 , of age simlar to the distributed uv emission in sq .",
    "there is an extended uv disk ( outlined by the red ellipse in the uv image ) centered between the nuclei of ngc  7318a and ngc  7318b .",
    "it is most likely to be associated with ngc  7318b and the contribution from the ngc  7318a is insignificant .",
    "this is because ngc  7318a has the optical apparence of an ordinary elliptical galaxy and no hii region or hi gas in this area is likely to be associated with it ( m97 ; s01 ) .",
    "the uv disk , with a physical size of @xmath9 kpc , is about 1@xmath22 larger ( along the major axis ) than the disk found by s01 on the b - r image .",
    "the emission peaks in the south side of the uv disk are in good agreement with those in the hi gas in this region which has the same redshift of ngc  7318b ( w02 ) .",
    "this agrees with the results of thilker et al .",
    "( 2004 ) who found that the uv emission regions in outer disk of m83 are typically associated with hi structures .",
    "the north tip of the disk goes beyond the hi gas boundary ( fig.1c ) .",
    "this discrepancy between the uv and the cold gas may well be due to the shock .",
    "sq - a is also located within this disk .",
    "the sy2 nucleus of ngc  7319 is faint in the uv , indicating very high extinction within the agn , consistent with the sy2 classification .",
    "both the young tail and the old tail are detected .",
    "the young tail looks more like a loop in the uv image . compared to the optical tail , it extends further in the northeast direction and includes all the 4 intergalactic hii regions found by mdo04 .",
    "the uv emission within the ngc  7319 disk shows a disturbed morphology .",
    "it is interesting to note that no hi gas has been detected in ngc  7319 disk ( fig.1c ; w02 ) .",
    "the uv emission in the northeast part of the disk is along two strong optical arms .",
    "it _ does not _ coincide with the h@xmath5 emission , nor with the co emission ( fig.1c ) .",
    "the elliptical galaxy ngc  7317 is faint in the uv , and there is no indication that it has been involved in any recent interactions with other members of sq .",
    "the uv data are analyzed quantitatively to study the star formation activity in different regions in sq .",
    "the results are presented in table  1 .",
    "for both the fuv and nuv magnitudes , a calibration uncertainty of 0.1 mag is assumed ( morrissey et al . 2004 ) .",
    "the fuv magnitude , the fuv - nuv color and the b - v color in table  1 are corrected for the foreground galactic extinction ( e(b - v)=0.079 and the extinction curve of cardelli et al .",
    "1989 ) . for regions detected in isocam 15@xmath17 map ( x99 ) ,",
    "the internal extinction is determined using the luminosity ratio @xmath23 according to the following formulae : @xmath24 @xmath25 the relation @xmath26 is taken from chary & elbaz ( 2001 ) .",
    "( 2 ) is taken from buat et al .",
    "other regions are either undetected or outside the isocam 15@xmath17 map . for them",
    "the internal extinction is estimated using the average hi column density ( w02 ) and the dust - to - gas ratio of the solar neighborhood ( @xmath27 atoms@xmath3 @xmath28 , savage and mathis 1979 ) . the foreground screen model and a modified calzetti attenuation curve ( buat et al .",
    "2004 ) are assumed .",
    "for the extinction estimated using the hi , the error is assumed to be 100% .",
    "estimates of the internal extinction of reg .",
    "vi ( sq - a ) using the mir - to - fuv ratio and using the hi column density , respectively , are found to be consistent with each other . star formation rate is estimated using the extinction corrected fuv luminosity according to the formula of kennicutt ( 1998 ) . the age of the stellar population responsible for the uv emission is determined using the extinction corrected fuv - nuv color and the single population synthesis model ( i.e. the burst model ) of fioc & rocca - volmerange ( 1997 , pegase ) .",
    "this is compared with the age of the stellar population responsible for the optical emission , determined using the extinction corrected b - v color and the same synthesis model .",
    "* sfr of sq - a ( reg .",
    "vi ) * : the sfr of 1.34@xmath4 m@xmath2 yr@xmath3 estimated from the extinction corrected fuv luminosity is in excellent agreement with that from the extinction corrected h@xmath5 luminosity ( 1.45 m@xmath2 yr@xmath3 ) by x03 . on the other hand ,",
    "the extinction estimated from the mir - to - fuv ratio , a@xmath29 , is significantly lower than that indicated by the balmer decrement ( a@xmath30 0.6  2 ) .",
    "this suggests that o stars and b stars which are responsible for the ionizing and non - ionizing uv radiation , respectively , have different distributions relative to the dust .",
    "the extinction corrected b - v color suggests an underlying stellar population of @xmath31 myr , consistent with the results of gallagher et al .",

    "iv ) , and 15% from the young tail ( reg .",
    "ii ) . there is a disk / tidal - tail gradient among the undereddened uv colors of reg .",
    "iv , iii and ii ( fig.2b ) . however , the extinction corrected uv colors are consistent with each other ( fig.2c ) , indicating that the color gradient is mainly due to the dust reddening , and there is no significant difference in the age of the uv population in the disk and in the tail .",
    "the extinction corrected uv and optical colors of reg .",
    "i ( old tail ) are consistent with a single population of age @xmath32 yrs , somewhat younger than that estimated by s01 from dynamic arguments ( 612 @xmath33 yrs ) .",
    "ii includes 11 subregions .",
    "iia , iib and iic correspond to the optical tail .",
    "the age of the uv population in iia and iib is @xmath13 yrs while that of the optical population is @xmath34 @xmath35 yrs , indicating an old underlying population possibly stripped from the disk of ngc  7319 in the encounter .",
    "the bright h@xmath5/mir source sq - b is in the east end of iia , signaling active current star formation .",
    "iic has a much younger uv population ( @xmath18 yrs ) .",
    "it is outside our b and v image .",
    "the extragalactic hii regions found by mdo04 are also in reg .",
    "iii ( c and d in mdo04 ) shows very young ages in both uv color and optical color ( @xmath36 yrs ) , consistent with the ew(h@xmath5 ) result of mdo04 .",
    "iij , which is north of iii and is not in the list of mdo04 , shows similar properties as iii .",
    "the uv population of iie ( b in md004 ) has an age of @xmath37 , older than that estimated by mdo04 ( 5.6 myr ) from ew(h@xmath5 ) . in the uv image",
    "these subregions , together with other subregions which are discovered for the first time , form a loop - like structure . given that many of these subregions were also detected in other bands ( e.g. optical and h@xmath5 ) and available redshift data ( s01 ; mdo04 ) are consistent with they all having the same redshift , this structure is very likely real .",
    "m97 suggested that the young tail is triggered by a high velocity ( @xmath38 km / sec ) passage of ngc  7320c through ngc  7319 1.5 @xmath35 yrs ago .",
    "however , the recently measured redshift of ngc  7320c is almost identical to that of ngc  7319 , indicating instead a slow passage ( s01 ) .",
    "therefore in order for ngc  7320c to move to its current position , the ngc  7319/n7320c encounter must have occured @xmath39 yrs ago .",
    "this is close to the age of the old tail , but older than that of the young tail ( m97 ) .",
    "an alternative scenario is that the young tail is triggered by a close encounter between ngc  7319 and the elliptical galaxy ngc  7318a .",
    "since ngc  7318a is about 3 times closer to ngc  7319 than ngc  7320c , the time argument is in favor of this new scenario .",
    "also the uv loop , on the other side of ngc  7319 with regard to ngc  7318a , looks very similar to the counter tidal loop found frequently in the dynamic simulations of galaxy - galaxy interactions ( see , e.g. , fig.2 of toomre & toomre 1972 , t=2 10@xmath40 yr ) .",
    "* star formation in regions related to ngc  7318b * : these include reg .",
    "v , vii , and viii .",
    "the peaks of the uv emission in reg .",
    "v correspond to a chain of hii regions in one of star forming arms of ngc  7318b ( s01 ; gallagher et al .",
    "therefore most of the uv emission is likely associated with the star formation rather than with the shock .",
    "the total sfr is 3.37@xmath10 m@xmath2 yr@xmath3 .",
    "this is very close to the sfr of the milky way ( @xmath41 m@xmath2 yr@xmath3 , mezger 1988 ) , a normal sbc galaxy .",
    "viii includes 4 subregions , viiia and viiib are in the south end of the uv disk , and viiic and viiid in the north end .",
    "they are 30  40 kpc away from the nucleus of ngc  7318b",
    ". these are even larger than the largest distance among the uv emission regions in the extreme outer disk of m83 , studied by thilker et al .",
    "whether the remarkable size of this uv disk , the peculiar morphology of the hi gas , and the long and open arms ( tidal tails ? ) of ngc  7318b are due to a head - on collision with ngc  7318a about 10@xmath40 yrs ago ( x03 ) , is an interesting subject for future studies .",
    "the uv and optical colors of viiia are consistent with a single population of @xmath13 yrs .    * summary remarks * : every time when sq is observed in a waveband for the first time , it reveals new , spectecular phenomona related to its complex interaction history .",
    "the long term fate of the star forming regions in the igm starburst sq - a , in the remarkably extended uv loop associated with the young tail , and in the very large uv disk of ngc  7318b is of great interest .",
    "this can have far - reaching inference to the interaction induced star formation in multi - galaxy systems which may play important roles in the early universe .    _",
