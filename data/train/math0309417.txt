    "<S> in this paper , we study the family index of a family of spin manifolds . in particular , we discuss to what extend the real index ( of the dirac operator of the real spinor bundle if the fiber dimension is divisible by @xmath0 ) which can be defined in this case contains extra information over the complex index ( the index of its complexification ) . </S>",
    "<S> we study this question under the additional assumption that the complex index vanishes on the @xmath1-skeleton of @xmath2 . in this case , we define new analytical invariants @xmath3 , i.e.  a certain secondary invariant .    </S>",
    "<S> we give interesting non - trivial examples . </S>",
    "<S> we then describe this invariant in terms of known topological characteristic classes .    </S>",
