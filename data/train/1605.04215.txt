    "the observation of a solitary canal wave by scott russell in 1834 is considered the historical origin of soliton studies , but the enormous growth of the field began more than a century later .",
    "this is due to the discovery of new methods for solving the nonlinear equations that describe them , such as inverse scattering @xcite , the bcklund transformation @xcite and the darboux transformation @xcite , to name a few .",
    "this phenomenon has been increasingly studied in several fields of physics , and particularly in optics @xcite .",
    "mccall and hahn were the first to observe these solitary optical waves , as reported in their famous papers @xcite where they introduced the concept of self - induced transparency ( sit ) . due to the coherent interaction of the pulses with the medium",
    ", they can propagate without attenuation .",
    "this is the shape - preserving property of solitons that is sometimes used to define them .",
    "mccall and hahn also found that the optical pulses tailor their intensity profile so that the total pulse area , defined in terms if the rabi frequency [ see eqs .",
    "( [ eq : rabi ] ) ] as @xmath1 tends towards the closest even multiple of @xmath2 .",
    "this is the very well - known area theorem , which is a consequence of the smoothing effects of doppler broadening @xcite .",
    "quantum optical systems have always been envisioned as the ideal candidates for building reliable quantum memories .",
    "this is due to their small decoherence and short interaction times @xcite .",
    "many procedures have achieved light manipulation @xcite and storage .",
    "light can be slowed down to the point where its information is encoded in the medium @xcite and then retrieved as was shown in @xcite .",
    "some other techniques such as a combination of electromagnetic - induced transparency ( eit ) and four - wave mixing @xcite have been shown to work .",
    "the downside of these sorts of procedures is that they rely on a slow resonant light - atom interaction that is characteristic of eit @xcite .",
    "if this interaction is instead led by short pulses , we can open the door to high - speed control and manipulation of light .",
    "the regime of broadband pulses interacting with matter leads to new possibilities for light control .",
    "the interaction of strong electromagnetic fields with atomic systems is described by nonlinear evolution equations ( which are hard to solve ) and the use of numerical computation is usually required . in some special circumstances , they become integrable and thus solvable by the methods previously mentioned . in the particular case of a @xmath0 system ( see fig .",
    "[ lambda ] ) , the maxwell - bloch equations that define the evolution of the system become integrable when both signal and control fields have equal atom - field coupling parameters and are in two - photon resonance , as has been shown by park and shin @xcite and clader and eberly @xcite .",
    "this leads to solitonic solutions even in non - ideal media preparation such as `` mixonium '' @xcite , a partially coherent medium .",
    "other studies have been carried out for the case of ultra - cold atoms , where one can neglect the effects of doppler broadening and homogeneous relaxation . given these assumptions , groves _",

    "complementary numerical simulations @xcite showed the relevance of this procedure even under the effects of the ever - present spontaneous emission . here",
    "we continue this work by presenting new solutions that allow full control of the information stored in the ground state elements of the density matrix .",
    "we present the generalization to multiple pulse storage as well as a three - step control by the corresponding computation of higher order solutions .",
    "three level atom in @xmath0 configuration , with spontaneous emission @xmath3 from the excited state interacting with two fields in two - photon resonance . ]",
    "we consider the interaction of strong short pulses with a @xmath0 system in two - photon resonance with each field tuned to address a different atomic transition .",
    "the atomic dipole operator is taken to be @xmath4 , thus only linking levels 1 to 3 and 2 to 3 . as is customary , the fields",
    "are written in carrier - envelope form : @xmath5 where @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the field frequencies , @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the vacuum wave numbers and @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the slowly - varying field envelopes .",
    "we assume that the pulses are short enough so that we can neglect the effects of spontaneous emission but long enough so that the envelopes change slowly over many cycles of the optical frequency , thus justifying the slow - varying envelope approximation ( svea ) .",
    "following @xcite we refer to the 1 - 3 field as the signal pulse and the 2 - 3 field as the control pulse . abandoning the bare frequencies in favor of the common detuning ,",
    "the total hamiltonian in the rotating wave approximation ( rwa ) takes the form : @xmath12 where we defined the rabi frequencies ,    [ eq : rabi ] @xmath13    and the detuning @xmath14 ( here @xmath15 denotes the energy of level @xmath16 ) .",

    "this gives us a set of eight nonlinear partial differential equations that need to be solved simultaneously .",
    "as stated previously , we need to consider the special case of two - photon resonance and equal atom - field coupling parameters , @xmath21 .",

    ", we have only considered the longitudinal spatial dimension ; this was justified by the assumption of plane waves . in reality",
    ", the pulses will have a nonuniform intensity profile that will inevitably lead to deviation from the theoretical assumption by effects such as pulse stripping , diffraction and self - focusing @xcite .",
    "to mitigate this we can use pulses that have a coherent frequency profile , have their bandwidth determined only by the finite extent of their envelope , and are free of chirping .",
    "additionally , an aperture can be used to ensure a planar wavefront and homogeneous distribution of intensity .",
    "an example of this can be seen in the beautiful experiments on sit by gibbs and slusher @xcite .",
    "another thing worth mentioning is that the finite extent of the pulses imposes some restrictions in the use of atomic beams to get rid of doppler broadening , namely , the transit time broadening must be smaller than the bandwidth of the pulses .",
    "this must be satisfied in order to ensure that the atoms where the signal pulse was encoded are the same that are interacting with the subsequent pulses .",
    "the basic idea of the darboux transformation is to start from a system of partial differential equations of the form : @xmath31 then consider a transformation @xmath32 so that @xmath33 where    @xmath34    [ puv ]    now we want to construct the operator @xmath35 in terms of known parameters such as the original solution to the linear eq .",

    "this pulse propagates at a reduced group velocity , coherently driving population from state @xmath94 to the excited state @xmath95 and back again , thus keeping its hyperbolic secant shape as it propagates .",

    "the first step to generalize this control to multiple imprint dynamics is to study the second order solution born out of the superposition of two type 1 solutions .",

    "each imprint would be moved in a different direction as well : the imprint on the right is displaced to the left by the signal pulse and the imprint on the left is pushed to the right by the control pulse that mediates the backward - transfer .",
    "throughout this manuscript we have shown the usefulness of a solution method via the darboux transformation and the nonlinear superposition principle for generating sequences of pulses useful for storage and manipulation of information .",
    "it can be employed to compute higher order solutions which give rise to complicated sequences of pulses by purely algebraic , albeit tedious , calculations .",
    "the new backward - transfer solution along with the solution presented in @xcite allow complete control of the information encoded by a signal pulse in the ground state coherence of the atomic system .",
    "the imprint can be moved backward or forward any number of times by means of control and signal pulses .",
    "this is particularly important for unidirectional systems where the pulses can only propagate through the atomic medium in one direction , be that by design or experimental necessity .",
    "the generation of higher order solutions showed that the control of the imprint can be extended to any number of steps moving the imprint back and forth . in practice",
    "this might not be completely true : we will need to abandon the idealized condition of infinitely long pulses and media and consider the effect of decoherence due to spontaneous emission .",
    "but as existing numerical experiments show @xcite , storage and manipulation are still possible with a somewhat different dependence on the different parameters than the analytical solution , and they still present the same trend . of course the degrading effects of decoherence may limit the number of steps in order to keep a certain degree of fidelity in the information stored .",
    "note that the finiteness of the medium provides a way to retrieve the signal pulse by frustrating its re - encoding by the end face when displaced by a control pulse .",
    "we also showed that multi - pulse storage is possible , and the effects due to the presence of another imprint can be quantified .",
    "this study could be continued to analyze the effect of encoding more pulses and see if the locations of the imprints follow a predictable trend from which it would be possible to extrapolate the behavior for any number of imprints .",
    "additionally , we showed that manipulation of the imprints by means of pulses of type 2 and 3 is possible . in this case",
    ", there are additional consideration , such as the spatial extent of each imprint .",
    "overlapping the imprints must be avoided when displacing the imprint a long distance or inverting their order .",
    "but from the numerical data , there is a maximum displacement that could very well hinder any chance of inverting the imprint or overlapping them ( as long as enough room was left between them during the encoding stage ) for any realistic experimental scenario .",
    "a final note must be made about the effects of doppler broadening on the encoding and retrieval of the signal pulse . in ref .",
    "@xcite clader and eberly worked out the first order solution presented here with the added effects of doppler broadening . from their work",
    "we can see that , in the case where the doppler distribution is centered around resonance , the imprint made on all the atoms is located at the same place but ( assuming a real coherence @xmath100 on resonance ) for the atoms off resonance the real part of the ground - state coherence is attenuated and acquires an imaginary part .",
    "this imaginary part has a sign that depends on the sign of the detuning , so there will be an equal number of atoms with negative and positive imaginary parts .",
    "when taking the average over the doppler distribution , this contribution will cancel out . therefore ,",
    "when a control pulse collides with the imprint , the only consequence is the attenuation of the real part for some atoms which will inevitably hinder the retrieval of the signal pulse but never suppress it completely . +",
