    "an important issue in the investigation of the dynamics of competing self - reproducing macromolecules , whose paradigm is eigen s quasispecies model @xcite , is the effect of the finite size of the population on the error threshold phenomenon that limits the length of the molecules @xcite .",
    "the quasispecies model was originally formulated as a deterministic kinetic theory described by a set of ordinary differential equations for the concentrations of the different types of molecules that compose the population . such formulation , however , is valid only in the limit where the total number of molecules @xmath0 goes to infinity .",
    "more pointedly , in this model a molecule is represented by a string of @xmath1 digits @xmath2 , with the variables @xmath3 allowed to take on @xmath4 different values , each of which representing a different type of monomer used to build the molecule . for sake of simplicity ,",
    "in this paper we will consider only binary strings , i.e. , @xmath5 .",
    "the concentrations @xmath6 of molecules of type @xmath7 evolve in time according to the following differential equations @xcite @xmath8 x_i \\ ;   , \\ ] ] where the constants @xmath9 stand for the death probability of molecules of type @xmath10 , and @xmath11 is a dilution flux that keeps the total concentration constant .",
    "this flux introduces a nonlinearity in ( [ ode ] ) , and is determined by the condition @xmath12 .",
    "the elements of the replication matrix @xmath13 depend on the replication rate or fitness @xmath14 of the molecules of type @xmath10 as well as on the hamming distance @xmath15 between strings @xmath10 and @xmath16 .",
    "they are given by @xmath17 and @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the single - digit replication accuracy , which is assumed to be the same for all digits .",
    "henceforth we will set @xmath20 for all @xmath10 .",
    "the quasispecies concept is illustrated more neatly for the single - sharp - peak replication landscape , in which we ascribe the replication rate @xmath21 to the so - called master string @xmath22 , and the replication rate @xmath23 to the remaining strings . in this context , the parameter @xmath24 is termed selective advantage of the master string . as the error rate @xmath25 increases , two distinct regimes are observed in the population composition : the _ quasispecies _ regime characterized by the master string and its close neighbors , and the _ uniform _ regime where the @xmath26 strings appear in the same proportion .",
    "the transition between these regimes takes place at the error threshold @xmath27 , whose value depends on the parameters @xmath1 and @xmath24 @xcite .",
    "a genuine thermodynamic order - disorder phase transition occurs in the limit @xmath28 only @xcite .",
    "we must note , however , that standard statistical mechanics tools developed to study the surface equilibrium properties of lattice systems can be used to investigate the finite @xmath1 case as well @xcite .",
    "moreover , the complete analytical solution of the single - sharp - peak replication landscape has been found recently by mapping the stationary solution of the kinetic equations ( [ ode ] ) into a polymer localization problem @xcite .",
    "closely related to our approach to the quasispecies evolution of finite populations is the population genetics formulation of the deterministic quasispecies model proposed recently @xcite . in that formulation",
    "it is assumed that the molecules are characterized solely by the number of monomers @xmath23 they have , regardless of the particular positions of these monomers inside the molecules .",
    "hence there are only @xmath29 different types of molecules which are labeled by the integer @xmath30 .",
    "this assumption is not so far - fetched since the feature that distinguishes the molecules is their replication rates @xmath14 , which in most analyses have been chosen to depend on @xmath31 only , i.e. , @xmath32 @xcite .",
    "furthermore , denoting the frequency of monomers @xmath23 in generation @xmath33 by @xmath34 , it is assumed that the molecule frequencies @xmath35 are given by the binomial distribution @xmath36 for @xmath37 .",
    "thus , in each generation the monomers are sampled with replacement from a pool containing monomers @xmath23 and @xmath38 in the proportions @xmath34 and @xmath39 , respectively .",
    "this amounts to neglecting linkage disequilibrium , i.e. , in each generation the molecule frequencies are random combinations of the constituent monomers @xcite . with the two assumptions presented above a simple recursion relation for the monomer frequency @xmath34",
    "can be readily derived @xcite .    to take into account the effect of finite @xmath0",
    ", the deterministic kinetic formulation must be replaced by a stochastic formulation based on a master equation for the probability distribution of the number of different types of molecules in the population @xcite .",
    "however , the extreme approximations used to derive results from that master equation or from related langevin equations @xcite have hindered the analysis of the error threshold for finite populations .",
    "an alternative approach to study stochastic chemical reaction networks is the algorithm proposed by gillespie @xcite , which has been successfully employed to simulate numerically the quasispecies model , providing thus a base line for analytical investigations @xcite .",
    "the goal of this work is to propose an analytical framework to investigate the quasispecies evolution of finite populations .",
    "more specifically , we will focus on the evolution of the molecule frequencies @xmath35 for @xmath40 and , since for finite @xmath0 these frequencies are random variables , we will derive a recursion relation for the average values @xmath41 .",
    "although we will concentrate mainly on the dependence of the error threshold on the population size @xmath0 , the formalism presented in the sequel can be applied to study a variety of fascinating phenomena related to the finitude of the population , such as mutational meltdown @xcite and punctuated equilibria or stasis @xcite , to mention only a few . moreover , since modern theories of integration of information in pre - biotic systems involve the compartmentation of a small number of molecules ( typically 10 to 100 ) @xcite , the understanding of the effects of the error propagation in finite populations has become an important issue to the theories of the origin of life .",
    "in each generation the population is described by the vector @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the number of molecules of type @xmath31 , so that @xmath44 . similarly to the deterministic case @xcite , we have to resort to a simplifying assumption to relate the molecule frequencies @xmath45 to the vector @xmath46 .",
    "in particular , in generation @xmath33 we consider a molecule pool containing the different molecule types in the proportions @xmath47 , so that @xmath48 is distributed by the multinomial distribution @xmath49^{n_0 } \\left [ \\pi_1 ( t ) \\right]^{n_1 }   \\ldots   \\left [ \\pi_\\nu ( t ) \\right ] ^{n_\\nu } .\\ ] ] hence in each generation the molecules are sampled with replacement from the molecule pool . in this sense",
    ", in each generation the population is a random combination of the constituent molecules , which amounts to neglecting linkage disequilibrium at the population level .",
    "more pointedly , the population composed of the offspring of the molecules present in the generation @xmath50 is destroyed and its molecule frequency @xmath35 used to create an entire new population according to ( [ p_n ] ) .",
    "although this procedure destroys the correlations between the molecules , it does not cause any significant loss of genetic information since the fitness of the molecules depend only on the number of monomers @xmath23 they have , which , in the average , is not affected by the procedure .",
    "the changes in the population composition @xmath46 are due to the driving of natural selection , modeled by the replication rate @xmath51 , and to mutations , modeled by the error rate per digit @xmath25 . following the prescription used in the implementation of the standard genetic algorithm @xcite",
    ", we consider first the effect of natural selection and then the effect of mutations . as usual",
    "we assume that the number of offspring that each molecule contributes to the new generation is proportional to its relative replication rate which , for molecules of type @xmath31 , is defined by @xmath52 thus the population composition after selection is described by the random vector @xmath53 which is distributed according to the conditional probability distribution @xmath54^{n_0 ' }   \\left [ w_1 \\left ( { \\bf n } \\right ) \\right ] ^{n_1 ' }   \\ldots \\left [ w_\\nu \\left ( { \\bf n } \\right ) \\right ] ^{n_\\nu ' } .\\ ] ] next we consider the changes in @xmath55 due to mutations .",
    "after mutation , the population is described by @xmath56 whose components are written as @xmath57 where the integer @xmath58 stands for the number of molecules of type @xmath59 that have mutated to a molecule of type @xmath31 .",
    "clearly , @xmath60 .",
    "we note that the probability of mutation from a molecule of type @xmath59 to a molecule of type @xmath31 is given by @xmath61 where @xmath62 and @xmath63 .",
    "the population is more conveniently described by the set @xmath64 rather than by @xmath65 .",
    "in fact , given @xmath66 the conditional probability distribution of @xmath67 is again a multinomial @xmath68 for @xmath69 . in this framework",
    "the frequency of molecules of type @xmath31 in the next generation @xmath70 is given simply by @xmath71 .",
    "this frequency is used to generate the new population of @xmath0 molecules of length @xmath1 according to the distribution ( [ p_n ] ) .",
    "the procedure is then repeated again .",
    "we have run simulations for the single - sharp - peak replication landscape using the procedure described above , which neglects linkage disequilibrium at the population level , as well as the standard genetic algorithm @xcite , in which the correlations between consecutive generations are maintained .",
    "we have focused on the effect of the error rate @xmath25 on the normalized mean hamming distance @xmath72 between the master string and the whole population in the stationary regime .",
    "this quantity is given by the fraction of monomers @xmath38 in the entire population , i.e. , @xmath73 . in figs .",
    "( [ f1 ] ) and ( [ f2 ] ) we present the results of the simulations for @xmath72 and its standard deviation @xmath74 , respectively , as functions of the error rate @xmath25 .",
    "the initial population is set with @xmath75 and @xmath76 for @xmath77 , and it is left to evolve for @xmath78 generations .",
    "no significant differences were found for longer runs or for different choices of the initial molecular frequencies .",
    "each data point involves two kinds of average : for each run we average over the mean hamming distance in the last @xmath79 generations ; this value is then averaged over @xmath80 runs .",
    "we note that even if the populations are identical in the initial generation , the random character of the transitions @xmath81 will make them distinct in the next generation .",
    "it is clear from these results that , as @xmath0 increases , the quantitative effects of assumption ( [ p_n ] ) become less significant .",
    "moreover , the dependence of @xmath72 and @xmath74 on the error rate is qualitatively the same for both algorithms .",
    "to derive an analytical recursion relation for the average molecular frequencies @xmath82 we consider the following approximate procedure , akin to the annealed approximation of the statistical mechanics of disordered systems , which facilitates greatly the analysis : instead of averaging over the populations only after the stationary regime is reached , we perform this average in each generation .",
    "the result obtained @xmath83 is then used to build the new populations .",
    "of course , in doing so we neglect the fluctuations of @xmath35 for the different runs . within this framework the average frequency of molecules of type @xmath31 in generation @xmath84 is written as @xmath85 using @xmath86 and @xmath87 we rewrite ( [ av_1 ] ) as @xmath88 noting that @xmath89 and @xmath90 , we can easily verify that the normalization condition @xmath91 is satisfied . to proceed",
    "further we must specify the replication rate @xmath51 . in the case of the single - sharp - peak replication landscape ,",
    "i.e. , @xmath92 and @xmath93 for @xmath77 , the summations over @xmath94 can be readily carried out .",
    "the final result is @xmath95^n + \\sum_{n=0}^{n-1 } b_n \\frac { \\sum_{r = 0}^{\\nu - 1 }   \\overline{\\pi}_r ( t ) \\left [ m_{pr } + a   \\frac{r}{1-r } m_{p \\nu }   \\right ] } { 1 + r \\left ( a -1 \\right ) } \\ ] ] for @xmath96 . here",
    "@xmath97^n   \\left [ 1 - \\overline{\\pi}_\\nu ( t ) \\right ] ^{n-1-n } , \\ ] ] and @xmath98 .",
    "thus , given the initial average molecular frequencies @xmath99 for @xmath100 , equations ( [ rec ] ) are iterated till the stationary regime is reached .",
    "before we proceed on the analysis of the stationary solutions of the recursion equations ( [ rec ] ) , some comments regarding the definition of the error threshold are in order .",
    "a popular definition of error threshold is the error rate at which the master frequency @xmath101 vanishes @xcite .",
    "the problem with this definition is that , even in the deterministic limit @xmath102 , @xmath101 never vanishes for _ finite _ @xmath1 .",
    "the vanishing of the master frequency is an artifact of neglecting reverse mutations @xcite , which can be justified in the limit @xmath28 only . in particular , for the single - sharp - peak replication landscape this prescription yields a very simple equation for the replication accuracy at the threshold in the deterministic regime @xcite , @xmath103 we must emphasize that for finite @xmath1 this equation is an approximation only .",
    "a more appropriate definition of the error threshold , which is useful for the finite @xmath0 case as well , is obtained by considering the statistical properties of the entire molecular population @xcite . in particular , we focus on the normalized mean hamming distance @xmath72 between the master sequence and the entire population and define the error threshold as the error rate at which the standard deviation @xmath74 is maximal @xcite .    in figs .",
    "[ f1 ] and [ f2 ] we show the theoretical predictions for @xmath72 and @xmath74 using the steady - state solution of the recursion equations ( [ rec ] ) .",
    "as expected , the effects of the fluctuations in @xmath35 for the different runs are stronger for small @xmath0 and hence our analytical approximation yields very poor results in this case , although it reproduces quite well the qualitative behavior pattern of the quantities measured .",
    "however , already for @xmath104 there is a good agreement between the theoretical predictions for @xmath72 and the simulation results , provided that @xmath25 is not too near the threshold transition .",
    "rather surprisingly , that agreement is better for the standard genetic algorithm .",
    "as expected , however , the theoretical predictions for the standard deviation @xmath74 are very poor since our approximation scheme neglects the fluctuations in @xmath45 between the different runs , which are directly measured by @xmath74 .",
    "nevertheless , the qualitative features of the simulation results are again well described by the theoretical curves .",
    "we note , in particular , the abrupt increase of @xmath74 as the error threshold is approached from below and the slow decay as the error rate increases further .",
    "the agreement between theory and simulation becomes better as @xmath0 increases . in fig .",
    "[ f3 ] we show the replication accuracy at the threshold @xmath105 as a function of the reciprocal of the population size .",
    "the increase of @xmath105 with decreasing @xmath0 is expected since the fluctuations become stronger for small @xmath0 and so the replication must be more accurate in order to keep the master string in the population .",
    "in particular , for large @xmath0 we find that @xmath105 increases linearly with @xmath106 .",
    "this result is in disagreement with the predictions of the birth and death model of error threshold proposed by nowak and schuster , which predicts that @xmath105 increases with @xmath107 for large @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "we note that , despite the claim of those authors , it is not possible to discern whether @xmath105 increases with @xmath106 or @xmath107 from their numerical data obtained using gillespie s algorithm @xcite .",
    "another interesting phenomenon , termed stochastic escape , is the loss of the master string in a finite population @xcite . in the limit @xmath28 this loss becomes irreversible , since no reverse mutation will be able to restore the master string .",
    "we can easily derive a lower bound to the probability that the master string is absent from the population using the inequality @xmath108 which follows trivially from the fact that @xmath109 .",
    "using @xmath110 , we can find the replication accuracy @xmath111 such that the condition @xmath112 is satisfied for fixed @xmath1 and @xmath24 .",
    "clearly , for @xmath113 the probability that the master string is absent from the population is nonzero .",
    "however , since this probability may be nonzero for @xmath114 as well , @xmath115 gives only a lower bound to the value of the replication accuracy below which the stochastic escape phenomenon actually takes place .",
    "this bound is presented in fig .",
    "[ f3 ] as a function of the reciprocal of the population size . in the limit @xmath102",
    "we find @xmath116 for finite @xmath1 , since in the deterministic regime @xmath117 is bounded by @xmath118 .",
    "it is interesting that for @xmath0 not too large we find @xmath119 so that the master string is likely to be absent from the quasispecies for replication accuracies in the range @xmath120 .",
    "we turn now to the analysis of the deterministic regime , @xmath102 . in this case , the sum in eq .",
    "( [ rec ] ) is dominated by the closest integer to @xmath121 , so that @xmath122 and the recursion equations ( [ rec ] ) reduce to @xmath123 for @xmath124 .    to appreciate the relevance of the present formulation of the quasispecies model , we compare it with the exact solution of the kinetic equations ( [ ode ] ) for finite @xmath1 .",
    "in fact , as pointed out by swetina and schuster @xcite , for the type of replication landscape considered in this paper , the @xmath26 molecular concentrations @xmath6 can also be grouped into @xmath125 distinct classes according to the number of monomers 1 that compose the molecules .",
    "this procedure allows the description of the chemical kinetics by only @xmath126 coupled first - order differential equations .",
    "in particular , for the single - sharp peak landscape the concentrations of molecules in class @xmath127 , denoted by @xmath128 with @xmath129 , obey the differential equations @xcite @xmath130 .\\ ] ] it is clear then that both models ( [ det ] ) and ( [ sw ] ) possess the same stationary state .",
    "this very interesting finding indicates that in the quasispecies model there is no linkage disequilibrium at the population level in the stationary regime , i.e. , the population is a random combination of the constituent molecules .",
    "in fact , this results holds true for any choice of the replication landscape @xmath51 , as can be easily verified by taking the limit @xmath102 in eq .",
    "( [ av_2 ] ) .",
    "it is also interesting to compare the deterministic limit of our model ( [ det ] ) with the population genetics approach to the deterministic quasispecies model @xcite .",
    "this can easily be done by writing down a recursion equation for the frequency of monomers 1 in the population @xmath131 , namely , @xmath132 clearly , this equation is useless since one must solve the general recursion equations ( [ det ] ) in order to find @xmath133 .",
    "however , the population genetics formulation makes use of the binomial assumption ( [ binomial ] ) to set @xmath134 so that the recursion equation ( [ p_d ] ) will involve the monomer frequencies only @xcite .    in fig .",
    "[ f4 ] we present the logarithm of the replication accuracy at the threshold @xmath135 as a function of the logarithm of the selective advantage @xmath136 for several values of @xmath1 for the deterministic case .",
    "there is a good agreement with ( [ simple ] ) for @xmath137 and , as expected , this agreement becomes better as @xmath1 increases .",
    "we have also verified that the prediction of the population genetics approach @xcite yields a very poor approximation for the location of the error threshold .",
    "furthermore , we have verified that @xmath138 departs significantly from a binomial distribution only near the threshold transition .",
    "aside this region , the population genetics approach provides a reliable and concise description of the deterministic quasispecies model .",
    "in this paper we have proposed a simple analytical model , based on the neglect of linkage disequilibrium , to study the error propagation in the quasispecies evolution of finite populations . in particular , our finding that in the deterministic regime this model yields exactly the same stationary state of the original kinetics model @xcite implies that the steady - state molecular population of the deterministic quasispecies model is a random assembly of the component molecules .",
    "some comments regarding the comparison of our approach with previous population theoretical analyses of the finite @xmath0 quasispecies model @xcite are in order .",
    "these works provide approximate formalisms to study the evolution of finite populations on a multiplicative single - peak fitness landscape without neglecting linkage disequilibrium .",
    "interestingly , for this fitness landscape , which is given by @xmath139 with @xmath140 , the binomial assumption ( [ binomial ] ) yields the exact solution to the deterministic equations for @xmath45 @xcite .",
    "moreover , in the weak selection limit ( @xmath141 ) the @xmath106 corrections to the deterministic value of the mean hamming distance between the master sequence and the whole population can be calculated analytically @xcite .",
    "an alternative formalism concentrates on the evolution of the ensemble average of the first cumulants of the distribution of fitness in the population @xcite .",
    "it is not clear , however , whether these quantities can be related to the more natural measures of the population composition , namely , @xmath72 and @xmath74 .",
    "we note that the location of the error threshold is not addressed in these works",
    ".    an important open question , which can be answered through intensive numerical simulations only , is the dependence of the replication accuracy at the threshold on the population size for large populations .",
    "in fact , the numerical data existent in the literature do not allow to distinguish between the @xmath106 dependence predicted by our model and the @xmath107 dependence predicted by the birth and dead model @xcite .",
    "we think that simulations based on genetic algorithms rather than on gillespie s algorithm may prove more effective to address this issue ."
