    "high - redshift supernovae have become a major tool in modern cosmology . by measuring their apparent magnitudes",
    ", we can estimate their luminosity distances @xmath3 ( see @xcite , and references therein ) . since the relationship between @xmath3 and the redshift @xmath0 depends on the cosmological parameters , observations of distant sne can constrain the cosmological model .",
    "prior to the announcement of the wmap results @xcite , observations of high-@xmath0 sne provided the most compelling evidence of the existence of a nonzero cosmological constant .",
    "the luminosity distances @xmath3 are determined by combining the observed fluxes @xmath4 with estimates of the sne luminosities @xmath5 .",
    "uncertainties in @xmath3 are caused by uncertainties in @xmath5 , because sne are not perfect standard candles .",
    "the flux @xmath4 is much easier to measure , but for distant sources the value of @xmath4 might be altered by gravitational lensing cause by the intervening distribution of matter .",
    "for instance , a positive magnification would result in a increase in @xmath4 , and an underestimation of @xmath3 .",
    "we have developed a _ multiple lens - plane algorithm _ to study light propagation in inhomogeneous universes @xcite . in this algorithm ,",
    "the space between the observer and the sources is divided into a series of cubic boxes of comoving size @xmath6 , and the matter content of each box is projected onto a plane normal to the line of sight .",
    "the trajectories of light rays are then computed by adding successively the deflections caused by each plane .    to use this algorithm",
    ", we need to provide a description of the matter distribution along the line of sight .",
    "matter is divided into two components : background matter and galaxies .",
    "we use a @xmath7 algorithm to simulate the distribution of background matter .",
    "the simulations used @xmath8 equal - mass particles and a @xmath9 pm grid , inside a comoving volume of size @xmath6 .",
    "the matter distribution in the different cubes along the line of sight then corresponds to the state of the simulation at different redshifts .",
    "we then use a monte carlo method for locating galaxies into the computational volume @xcite .",
    "galaxies are located according to the underlying distribution of background matter .",
    "morphological types are ascribed according to the morphology - density relation @xcite .",
    "galaxies are modeled as nonsingular isothermal spheres , with rotation velocities and core radii that vary with luminosity and morphological types . in figure",
    "[ zoom ] , we use a series of zooms to illustrates the dynamical range of the density distribution generated by this method .",
    "we consider 3 cosmological models : ( 1 ) a flat , cosmological constant model with @xmath10 , @xmath11 , and @xmath12 .",
    "this model is in agreement with the results of the wmap satellite @xcite .",
    "( 2 ) a low - density model with @xmath13 , @xmath14 , and @xmath15 . ( 3 ) a matter - dominated model with @xmath16 , @xmath14 , and @xmath15 . for each model",
    ", we consider sources at 5 different redshifts : @xmath17 , 2 , 3 , 4 , and 5 .",
    "for each combination model - redshift , we performed 1020 ray tracing experiments .",
    "each experiment consists of propagating a square beam of @xmath18 rays back in time from the present to redshift @xmath19 , through the matter distribution .",
    "the rays in the beam were widely separated , by 6 arc minutes , and therefore sampled different regions of space .",
    "we computed the magnification matrix @xmath20 along each ray .",
    "the magnification @xmath21 is then given by @xmath22    figure  [ pmu ] shows the distribution of magnifications for the @xmath23-model .",
    "the distribution peaks at @xmath24 , and is strongly skewed .",
    "the width of the distribution increases with the source redshift .",
    "the distributions for the other two models are qualitatively similar .",
    "estimating the effect of lensing on the statistics of high-@xmath0 supernovae is a complex problem , and we defer such analysis to future work . here",
    "we use a simple approach .",
    "first , for each model and each source redshift , we compute the standard deviation @xmath25 of the magnification distribution @xmath26 . the values are shown in figure  [ sigma ] .",
    "we use an empirical fit of the form @xmath27    this enables us to estimate the values of @xmath25 at any redshift .",
    "we estimate the effect of lensing as follows : the distances of high-@xmath0 supernovae are reported in the literature as : @xmath28    where @xmath3 is the luminosity distance , @xmath29 is the hubble constant , @xmath30 is the measurement , and @xmath31 is the intrinsic uncertainty ( i.e. not caused by lensing ) .",
    "the distance @xmath3 is related to the luminosity @xmath5 and flux @xmath4 by @xmath32    after eliminating @xmath3 , we get @xmath33    the effect of lensing will be to modify the flux @xmath4 . to account for it ,",
    "we replace @xmath4 by @xmath34 in equation  ( [ lsqh0 ] ) , and expand to first order in @xmath31 and @xmath35 . after some algebra , we get @xmath36        the last term represents the effect of lensing .",
    "we then make the approximation @xmath37 , and get @xmath38        where @xmath39 is computed using the empirical relations plotted in figure  [ sigma ] .",
    "we use the values of @xmath30 and @xmath31 reported by tonry et  al .",
    "@xcite ( their table  8) . in figure",
    "[ ratio ] , we plot the ratio @xmath40 versus @xmath0 ( left of the dashed line ) .",
    "this quantity increases with redshift , but never gets higher than 0.5 for the tonry et al . sample .",
    "furthermore , we shall assume that @xmath31 and @xmath41 are statistically independent , and combine them in quadrature , using @xmath42    where @xmath43 is the total error .",
    "the contribution of lensing to this error is then of order 25% at most .",
    "the top panel of figure  [ hubble ] shows a hubble diagram [ deviation @xmath44 relative to an empty universe , versus redshift ] , obtained by averaging the data in redshift bins , using @xmath45_j&=&\\sigma_iw_i\\delta(m - m)/\\sigma_iw_i\\,,\\\\ \\delta_j&=&(1/\\sigma_iw_i)^{1/2}\\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where the sums are over all data points @xmath46 in bin @xmath47 .",
    "the three curves , from top to bottom , show the exact results for the @xmath23cdm , low - density , and matter - dominated models , respectively .",
    "the results support the flat @xmath23cdm model and exclude the other models considered .",
    "the other panels of figure  [ hubble ] show the effect of lensing ( the three models have to be plotted separately , because the correction due to lensing is model - dependent ) .",
    "this effect is totally negligible .",
    "the largest correction to the error bars is about 10% for the highest redshift bin , for the @xmath23cdm model .",
    "clearly , the potential error introduced by lensing is negligible in comparison to the intrinsic error in the measurement , at least for sne at redshifts @xmath1 .",
    "the next step is to estimate the effect on a yet - undiscovered population of very - high-@xmath0 sne .",
    "we generated a mock catalog of 43 sne in the range @xmath2 .",
    "we assume that the values of @xmath30 are consistent with a @xmath23cdm model , and the values of @xmath31 in that range are comparable to the ones in the range @xmath48 .    the ratios @xmath40 are plotted in figure  [ ratio ] .",
    "the effect of lensing rapidly becomes important at redshift @xmath49 .",
    "figure  [ hubble_hz ] shows the hubble diagrams of figure  [ hubble ] , which have been extended to higher redshifts to include the mock data .",
    "the error bars get significantly bigger when lensing is included .",
    "furthermore , at redshift @xmath50 , it becomes very difficult to distinguish the open , low density model from the cosmological constant model .",
    "we have performed a series of ray - tracing experiments using a multiple lens - plane algorithm .",
    "we have estimated the standard deviation of the magnification distribution with source redshift , for three different cosmological models . using this relation ,",
    "we have estimated the effect of lensing on the statistics of high - redshift supernovae .",
    "the errors introduced by lensing are unimportant for sne with redshift @xmath1 . however , the effect of lensing on a hypothetical population of sne at redshifts @xmath51 could be very important , and must be understood before these sne could be used to constrain cosmological models ."
