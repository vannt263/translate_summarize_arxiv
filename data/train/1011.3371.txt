    "recently , many studies collect longitudinal data on a panel of biomarkers , and interest is on assessing the relationship between these biomarkers and time to an event . for example , @xcite examined the relationship between five longitudinally collected cytokines measured from serum plasma and survival .",
    "interest focused on whether the values of these multiple cytokines are associated with survival . in another example , patients with primary biliary cirrhosis are followed longitudinally and interest is on examining whether multiple longitudinally biomarkers are prognostic for a poor clinical outcome .",
    "important features in studies of this type are that there may be a relatively large number of biomarkers and that these biomarkers are subject to sizable measurement error due to laboratory error and biological variation .",
    "various authors have proposed joint modeling approaches for a single longitudinal measurement and time - to - event data [ @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite , among others ] .",
    "there is also limited work on joint models for a few longitudinal measurements and time - to - event data [ xu and zeger ( @xcite , @xcite ) ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ] .",
    "however , these methods are difficult to implement when the number of longitudinal biomarkers is large since most of these approaches require integrating over the vector of all random effects to evaluate the joint likelihood of the multivariate longitudinal and time - to - event data .",
    "this paper proposes an approach for jointly modeling multivariate longitudinal and discrete time - to - event data which easily accommodates many longitudinal biomarkers .",
    "@xcite and @xcite have proposed an approach for modeling multivariate longitudinal data whereby all possible pairs of longitudinal data are separately modeled and are then combined in a final step .",
    "we use a similar approach along with a recent regression calibration approach for jointly modeling a single series of longitudinal measurements and time - to - event data [ @xcite ] to implement the joint modeling approach proposed in this paper .",
    "recently , @xcite have proposed a discriminant analysis based approach for using multivariate longitudinal profiles to predict renal graft failure . at the end of their discussion , they mention that a more elegant approach , which has not yet been developed , would involve a joint model for the many longitudinal profiles and time - to - event data .",
    "this paper presents such an approach .",
    "we describe the approach in section [ s2 ] .",
    "we show the advantages of this approach using simulation in section [ s3 ] .",
    "we illustrate the methodology with an analysis of primary biliary cirrhosis data ( pbc ) in which we simultaneously examine the relationship between multiple longitudinal biomarker in section [ s4 ] .",

    "further , define @xmath13 as the longitudinal measurements without measurement error for the @xmath14th biomarker and @xmath15 .",
    "we consider a joint model for multivariate longitudinal and discrete time - to - event data in which the discrete event time distribution is modeled as a linear function of previous true values of the biomarkers without measurement error on the probit scale .",
    "specifically , @xmath16 where @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 is taken as @xmath20 , @xmath21 governs the baseline discrete event time distribution and @xmath22 measures the effect of the @xmath14th biomarker ( @xmath23 ) at time @xmath24 on survival at time @xmath1 .",
    "specifically , ( [ 1f ] ) allows for examining the effect of multiple `` true '' biomarker values at time @xmath25 on the probability of an event between the @xmath26th and @xmath27th time point .",
    "the longitudinal data is modeled assuming that the fixed and random effect trajectories are linear .",
    "specifically , the multivariate longitudinal biomarkers can be modeled as @xmath28 where @xmath29 where @xmath30 and @xmath31 are the fixed effect intercept and slope for the @xmath14th biomarker , and @xmath32 and @xmath33 are the random effect intercept and slope for the @xmath14th biomarker on the @xmath4th individual .",

    "alternative to ( [ 1f ] ) , where the probability of an event over an interval depends on the true biomarker values at the beginning of the interval , the event - time process could be adapted to depend on the random effects of the multivariate longitudinal process [ e.g. , @xmath33 can replace @xmath42 in ( [ 1f ] ) ] .",
    "conceptually , model ( [ 1f])([2f ] ) can be estimated by maximizing the likelihood @xmath43\\\\[-8pt ]      & & \\hspace*{56pt}{}\\times\\biggl\\{\\prod_{j=2}^{j_i}(1-r_{ij})\\biggr\\}\\bigl(r_{i(j_i+1)}\\bigr)^{j_i < j}f(\\bolds{\\gamma}_i)\\,d\\bolds{\\gamma}_i,\\nonumber         \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath44 , @xmath45 is the product of @xmath46 univariate normal density functions each with mean @xmath47 and variance @xmath41 , and @xmath48 is a multivariate normal density with mean zero and variance @xmath38 . when @xmath49 , ( [ 4f ] ) can be maximized by numerical integration techniques such as a simple trapezoidal rule or gaussian quadrature [ @xcite ] .",
    "however , these methods are not feasible for even a few longitudinal biomarkers .",
    "alternative monte carlo methods such as monte carlo em [ @xcite ] are possible , but these methods do not perform well for even moderately high dimensional random effects ( say , @xmath50 ) . in the next subsection",
    "we develop an alternative approach which is easy to implement with a large number of longitudinal biomarkers .",
    "we propose a two stage regression calibration approach for estimation , which can be described as follows . in the first stage ,",
    "multivariate linear mixed models can be used to model the longitudinal data . in the second stage ,",
    "the time - to - event model is estimated by replacing the random effects with corresponding empirical bayes estimates .",
    "there are three problems with directly applying this approach .",
    "first , estimation in the first stage is complicated by the fact that simply fitting multivariate linear mixed models results in bias due to informative dropout ; this is demonstrated by @xcite for the the case of @xmath49 .",
    "second , as described in section [ s21 ] , parameter estimation for multivariate linear mixed models can be computationally difficult when the number of longitudinal measurements ( @xmath11 ) is even moderately large .",
    "third , calibration error in the empirical bayes estimation needs to be accounted for in the time - to - event model",
    ". the proposed approach will deal with all three of these problems .",
    "the bias from informative dropout is a result of differential follow - up whereby the longitudinal process is related to the length of follow - up .",
    "that is , in ( [ 2f])([3f ] ) , patients with large values of @xmath47 are more likely to have an early event when @xmath51 for @xmath23 .",
    "there would be no bias if all @xmath52 follow - up measurements were observed on all patients .",
    "as proposed by @xcite for univariate longitudinal data , we can avoid this bias by generating complete data from the conditional distribution of @xmath53 given @xmath0 , denoted as @xmath54 . since @xmath54 under model ( [ 2f])([3f ] ) does not have a tractable form , we propose a simple approximation for this conditional distribution . under model ( [ 2f])([3f ] )",
    ", the distribution of @xmath54 can be expressed as @xmath55 since @xmath0 and the values of @xmath56 are conditional independent given @xmath57 , @xmath58 , where @xmath59 .",
    "the distribution of @xmath54 can be expressed as a multivariate linear mixed model if we approximate @xmath60 by a normal distribution . under the assumption that @xmath60 is normally distributed with mean @xmath61 and variance @xmath62 , and by rearranging mean structure parameters in the integrand of ( [ 5f ] ) so that the random effects have mean zero , @xmath54 corresponds to the following multivariate linear mixed model : @xmath63 where @xmath17 , @xmath12 , and @xmath23 . the parameters @xmath64 and @xmath65 are intercept and slope parameters for the @xmath14th longitudinal measurement and for patients who have an event time at time @xmath0 or who are censored at time @xmath7 .",
    "in addition , the associated random effects @xmath66 are multivariate normal with mean @xmath37 and variance @xmath67 , and the residuals @xmath68 are assumed to have an independent normal distribution with mean zero and variance @xmath69 .",
    "thus , this conditional model involves estimating separate fixed effect intercept and slope parameters for each potential event - time and for subjects who are censored at time @xmath7 .",
    "likewise , separate random effects distributions are estimated for each of these discrete time points .",
    "for example , the intercept and slope fixed - effect parameters for the @xmath14th biomarker for those patients who have an event at time @xmath70 is @xmath71 and @xmath72 , respectively .",
    "further , the intercept and slope random effects for all @xmath11 biomarkers on those patients who have an event at time @xmath73 , is multivariate normal with mean @xmath37 and variance @xmath74 .",
    "a similar approximation has been proposed by @xcite for univariate longitudinal data @xmath75 .",
    "recall that by generating complete data from ( [ 6f ] ) we are able to avoid the bias due to informative dropout .",
    "however , when @xmath11 is large , direct estimation of model ( [ 6f ] ) is difficult since the number of elements in @xmath76 grows quadratically with @xmath11 .",
    "for example , the dimension of the variance matrix @xmath76 is @xmath39 by @xmath39 for @xmath11 longitudinal biomarkers .",
    "@xcite proposed estimating the parameters of multivariate linear mixed models by formulating bivariate linear mixed models on all possible pairwise combinations of longitudinal measurements . in the simplest approach , they proposed fitting bivariate linear mixed models on all @xmath77 combinations of longitudinal biomarkers and averaging `` overlapping '' or duplicate parameter estimates",
    ". thus , we estimate the parameters in the fully specified model ( [ 6f ] ) by fitting @xmath78 bivariate longitudinal models that only include pairs of longitudinal markers . @xcite demonstrated with simulations that there is little efficiency loss using their approach relative to a full maximum - likelihood based approach . fitting these bivariate models",
    "is computationally feasible since only four correlated random effects are contained in each model .",
    "( that is , @xmath76 is a four by four - dimensional matrix for each discrete event - time @xmath0 . )",
    "duplicate estimates of fixed effects and random - effect variances from all pairwise bivariate models are averaged to obtain final parameter estimates of the fully specified model ( [ 6f ] ) .",
    "for example , when @xmath79 there are @xmath80 estimates of @xmath81 , @xmath82 , @xmath69 for the @xmath14th longitudinal biomarker that need to be averaged .    model ( [ 6f ] ) is then used to construct complete longitudinal pseudo data sets which in turn are used to estimate the mean of the posterior distribution of an individual s random effects given the data .",
    "specifically , multiple complete longitudinal data sets can be constructed by simulating @xmath83 values from the approximation to the distribution of @xmath54 given by ( [ 6f ] ) where the parameters are replaced by their estimated values .",
    "since the simulated data sets have complete follow - up on each individual , the bias in estimating the posterior mean of @xmath57 caused by informative dropout will be much reduced .",
    "the posterior mean of distribution @xmath57 given the data can be estimated by fitting ( [ 2f])([3f ] ) to the generated complete longitudinal pseudo data .",
    "however , similar to fitting the conditional model ( [ 6f ] ) , fitting model ( [ 2f])([3f ] ) is difficult due to the high dimension of @xmath38 .",
    "thus , we again use the pairwise estimation approach of @xcite , whereby we estimate the parameters of ( [ 2f])([3f ] ) by fitting all pairwise bivariate models and averaging duplicate parameter estimates to obtain final parameter estimates . for each generated complete longitudinal pseudo data set , the estimate of the posterior mean , denoted as @xmath84 , can be calculated as @xmath85 where @xmath86 is a @xmath87 design matrix corresponding to the fixed and random effects in ( [ 2f])([3f ] ) , where @xmath88 , @xmath89 , and @xmath90 is the variance of @xmath56 .",
    "estimates of @xmath91 , denoted as @xmath92 , are obtained by substituting @xmath93 for @xmath94 in ( [ 3f ] ) .    to account for the measurement error in using @xmath95 as",
    "compared with using @xmath57 in ( [ 1f ] ) , we note that @xmath96 where @xmath97 , @xmath98 , @xmath99 , and where @xmath100 [ @xcite ; @xcite ] . expression ( [ 8f ] ) follows from the fact that @xmath101=\\phi[(a+\\mu)/\\sqrt{1+\\tau^2}]$ ] , where @xmath102 .    in the second stage ,",
    "@xmath21 ( @xmath2 ) and @xmath103 ( @xmath23 ) can be estimated by maximizing the likelihood @xmath104\\nonumber\\\\[-8pt]\\\\[-8pt ] & & \\hspace{13pt}{}\\times p\\bigl(y_{i(j_i+1)}=1|y_{ij_i}=0;\\widehat{\\mathbf{x}}^*_i\\bigr)^{j_i < j},\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath105 is given by ( [ 8f ] ) .",
    "thus , we propose the following algorithm for estimating @xmath21 and @xmath22 ( @xmath23 ) :    1 .",

    "2 .   simulate complete longitudinal pseudo measurements ( i.e. , @xmath83 for @xmath23 , @xmath17 , @xmath2 ) from model ( [ 6f ] ) with model parameters estimated from step 1 .",
    "3 .   estimate the parameters in model ( [ 2f])([3f ] ) without regard to the event time distribution from complete longitudinal pseudo measurements ( simulated in step 2 ) by fitting all possible @xmath106 bivariate longitudinal models and averaging duplicate model parameter estimates .",

    "repeat steps 2 to 5 @xmath112 times and average @xmath113 and @xmath114 to get final estimates .",
    "we choose @xmath115 in the simulations and data analysis since this was shown to be sufficiently large for univariate longitudinal modeling discussed in @xcite .",
    "asymptotic standard errors of @xmath113 and @xmath114 can not be used for inference since they fail to account for the missing data uncertainty in our procedure .",
    "standard errors and 95% confidence intervals of parameter estimates using the bootstrap [ @xcite ] are as follows :    1 .   construct a bootstrap sample of size @xmath116 , by resampling event - time and multivariate longitudinal data with replacement ( @xmath117 ) from the @xmath118 .",
    "2 .   fit the proposed estimation procedure .",
    "iterate 500 times between steps 1 and 2 .",
    "the bootstrap standard error is the sample standard deviation of the 500 bootstrap estimates .",
    "the 95% confidence intervals were constructed using the percetile method ( limits are 2.5 and 97.5 percentiles of the bootstrap distribution ) .",
    "covariates can be incorporated in ( [ 3f ] ) by adding them directly into the multivariate linear mixed model ( [ 6f ] ) . specifically , if @xmath119 , where @xmath86 is a vector of covariates with @xmath120 being parameters for the @xmath14th biomarker , then @xmath121 and @xmath54 can be approximated by a multivariate linear mixed model with @xmath122 being added to the right side of ( [ 6f ] ) .",
    "estimation then proceeds as described in section [ s22 ] although more difficult , covariates can also be incorporated into ( [ 1f ] ) .",
    "if @xmath123 then @xmath124 and under the assumption that @xmath125 is normally distributed with variance not depending on @xmath86 ( which we found to be the case in simulations not shown ) , then @xmath126 can be approximated by a multivariate linear mixed model with @xmath127 added to the right - hand side of ( [ 6f ] ) .",

    "specifically , the regression coefficients ( @xmath162 coefficients ) corresponding to three markers are 0.394 ( 95% ci : 0.07 to 2.21 ) , @xmath164 ( @xmath165 to @xmath166 ) and 5.76 ( @xmath167 to 30.97 ) .",
    "table [ 3f ] also shows the estimated fixed effect intercept and slope for the three longitudinal biomarkers for the proposed approach .",
    "the estimates suggest that biliribin is increasing , while albumin and prothrombin time are nearly constant over time .    the joint modeling approach is important in this application for a number of reasons .",
    "first , survival models which use observed biomarkers can result in attenuated estimates of risk .",
    "the proposed approach allowed us to account for the measurement error in investigating the effect of multiple biomarker measurements on the short - term prognosis of pbc patients in terms of transplantation - free survival . with the proposed approach",
    ", we found that the `` true '' biliribin and albumin values at the beginning of an interval had a sizable and statistically significant effect on the probability of either a transplantation or death in the subsequent interval .",
    "second , the proposed approach allows us to appropriately make inference about changes in the three `` true '' biomarkers over time .",
    "as stated before , the largest change over time was in biliribin which sizably increased over time .",
    "when making these longitudinal inferences , not appropriately modeling the relationship between the multiple biomarkers and survival may lead to bias due to informative dropout [ @xcite ] .",
    "we proposed an approach for jointly modeling multivariate longitudinal and discrete time - to - event data .",
    "unlike likelihood - based approaches which require high - dimensional integration to evaluate the joint likelihood , this approach only requires fitting bivariate random effects models .",
    "this methodology uses recent methodology for fitting multivariate longitudinal data with bivariate linear mixed models proposed by fieuws et al .",
    "( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "they discussed the simple averaging of duplicate parameters estimates as we did in implementing the proposed approach .",
    "they also proposed a pseudo - likelihood approach which involves maximizing the sum of likelihoods from bivariate models across all @xmath168 combinations of pairwise longitudinal markers .",
    "although this later approach may provide some minor efficiency gain over simple averaging , it would be substantially more complicated to implement in our setting .",
    "further , one of the advantages of the pseudo - likelihood approach is that it provides an analytic expression for the asymptotic variance of the parameter estimates .",
    "unfortunately , this asymptotic variance is not generalizable to the joint model with time - to - event data , making the pseudo - likelihood approach less attractive in our setting .",
    "there are similarities between our approach and the recent approach by fieuws et al .",
    "( @xcite ) for predicting renal graft failure based on multivariate longitudinal profiles .",
    "both approaches model the conditional distribution of the multivariate longitudinal profiles given the failure time .",
    "however , there are major differences between the two approaches .",
    "fieuws et al .",
    "model the conditional distribution of the longitudinal measurements given the failure time and then use bayes rule to estimate the probability of failure given the longitudinal profiles . in our approach , we use an approximation of the conditional distribution of @xmath54 under the joint model of the multivariate longitudinal and time - to - event data in order estimate the parameters of this joint model .",
    "we demonstrated the feasibility of the proposed approach with three biomarkers ( @xmath146 ) .",
    "however , the approach can easily accommodate a large number of longitudinal profiles since it simply involves fitting @xmath169 bivariate models .",
    "the relationship between the multivariate longitudinal and event - time data is governed by expression ( [ 1f ] ) .",
    "however , other functional relationships are possible with this approach .",
    "for example , we could relate the two processes by averages of `` true '' longitudinal biomarkers either across time or across different biomarkers .",
    "alternatively , the approach could be formulated so that the event - time process depends on the individual s intercept and slope for each of the @xmath11 longitudinal biomarkers .",
    "the multivariate longitudinal profiles are modeled as multivariate linear mixed models in ( [ 2f ] ) and ( [ 3f ] ) , which was appropriate for the analysis of the pbc data .",
    "however , the methodology could be extended to allow for more flexible nonlinear modeling of marker profiles .",
    "this would involve approximating the conditional probability @xmath54 in ( [ 5f ] ) where @xmath170 follows a multivariate nonlinear mixed model , rather than the linear mixed model discussed in our paper . in the nonlinear case",
    ", we could approximate ( [ 5f ] ) by ( [ 6f ] ) , where ( [ 6f ] ) would be a nonlinear mixed model with parameters indexed by @xmath0 rather than the linear mixed model presented . however , unless there is biological rational for a particular nonlinear mixed model , it may be difficult to choose a reasonable model in most practical situations .    in our formulation",
    ", we assumed that event times are only administratively censored after a fixed follow - up at the end of the study .",
    "for the situation in which patients are censored prematurely , dropout times can be imputed based on a model fit using patients who had the potential to be followed over the entire study duration .    in this article methodology",
    "was developed using a discrete - time survival model with calibration error being incorporated by using a probit link function .",
    "this approach led to an analytically tractable form for incorporating calibration error ( [ 8f ] ) .",
    "for the pbc study , little is lost by using a discrete - time model since the probability of an event in each of the five intervals is low ( the estimated probability of an event during each of the five time intervals is 0.05 , 0.03 , 0.08 , 0.07 and 0.07 ) . for continuous - time survival models such as the cox model , incorporating calibration is more difficult since there is no simple analytic solution . that said , we could use a cox model if we do not account for the calibration error in replacing the random effect by their empirical bayes estimators .",
    "although not the case in the pbc study , in situations where the within - subject variation is small relative to the between - subject sources of variation , the calibration error will be small and there will be only a small amount of bias induced by not accounting for the calibration error .",
