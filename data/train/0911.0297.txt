    "the decays @xmath0 and @xmath7 are to some extent complementary : combined with its charge conjugated counterpart , the all - charged final state of the first decay gives access to a vast number of observables sensitive to cp violation . on the other hand , although the second decay yields only two observables , it offers a unique possibility to a transparent study of @xmath3 penguin effects .",
    "this is due to the massless , neutral final state , which goes along with an absence of non - perturbative contributions related to low energy qcd dynamics and photon exchanges .",
    "what these decays have clearly in common is the important role they will play in the upcoming experiments such as lhcb and super - b facilities .",
    "a prediction for the observables of @xmath0 @xcite involves mainly three theoretical ingredients : effective hamiltonian , form factors and qcd factorization . while the effective hamiltonian governing this decay",
    "is discussed in @xcite , we emphasize here that we also include scalar operators and lepton mass effects . the @xmath8 matrix elements of the relevant operators can be expressed in terms of seven form factors depending on the momentum transfer @xmath9 between the @xmath1 and the @xmath10 mesons .",
    "the well established technique of qcd sum rules on the light cone ( lcsr ) that is applied here combines classic qcd sum rules with information on light cone distribution amplitudes in order to determine the form factors .",
    "the result is a set of form factors fulfilling all correlations required in the heavy quark limit .",
    "in addition to terms proportional to form factors , the @xmath11 amplitude contains certain  non - factorizable \" contributions , which do not correspond to form factors .",
    "we include these qcd factorization corrections to nlo in @xmath12 but lo in @xmath13 .",
    "the resulting angular distribution gives rise to twelve angular coefficient functions @xmath14 for both the original and the cp - conjugate mode .",
    "instead of using these coefficients as fundamental observables , we use straight forward combinations of the @xmath14 and @xmath15 to reduce the theoretical error and separate cp - conserving and cp - violating np effects .",
    "the twelve cp averaged angular coefficients as well as the twelve cp asymmetries @xcite are given in terms of angular coefficient functions : @xmath16    since this is a complete set of accessible observables , all previously considered observables , for example the forward - backward symmetry , can be expressed straight forwardly in terms of new observables . while in @xcite",
    "several different models including the littlest higgs model with t - parity ( lht ) are studied , we illustrate here the discriminating power of our set of observables using the example of the effects in models based on the mssm .",
    "the most interesting cp asymmetries are @xmath17 , which are not suppressed by small strong phases @xcite and thus potentially of @xmath18 .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : fbmssm ] we show the effects in a flavor blind mssm @xcite , which is a modification of the minimal flavor violating mssm with additional flavor conserving cp violating phases in the soft terms .",
    "the other two scenarios are general mssm frameworks with different mass insertions switched on .",
    "one can see that the effects in the different observables are highly model dependent and give , combined with the other cp symmetries and asymmetries , an extraordinary tool to discriminate between different models or parameter configurations .",
    "on @xmath9 in three variations of the mssm : the flavor blind mssm ( orange ) with @xmath19 , the mssm with complex @xmath20 mass insertion ( red ) and the mssm with complex @xmath21 mass insertion ( green ) .",

    "these are the three branching ratios and one additional polarization ratio in the case of @xmath23 , measuring the fraction @xmath29 of longitudinally polarized @xmath10 mesons @xcite .",
    "this polarization fraction can be extracted from the angular distribution in the invariant mass of the neutrino - antineutrino pair and the angle between the @xmath10 flight direction in the @xmath1 rest frame and the @xmath30 flight direction in the @xmath31 rest frame",
    ". a major source of uncertainties of the @xmath28 based decays are the qcd / hadronic ingredients entering the calculation .",
    "a well known problem in the inclusive decay is the @xmath32 dependence , which leads to considerable uncertainties .",
    "the traditional approach is to normalize the decay rate to the semileptonic inclusive @xmath33 decay . on the other hand , this introduces again uncertainties through the dependence of the semileptonic phase space factor on the charm quark mass . instead of this normalization ,",
    "we use the @xmath34 mass evaluated in the @xmath35 scheme @xcite , being known at a precision of @xmath36 . for the @xmath22 decay we use the form factors given in @xcite , being valid in the full physical range , while we use the already mentioned set of @xcite for the decay @xmath37 .",
    "these improvements combined with an up to date top mass @xcite lead to a significantly lower prediction for @xmath38 and a considerably more accurate prediction for @xmath39 , than the ones present in the literature .",
    "the four observables accessible in the three different @xmath40 decays are dependent on the two in principle complex wilson coefficients @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "however , only two real combinations of these complex quantities enter the observables @xcite : @xmath43 measurements of the four observables are then transparently represented as bands in the @xmath44-plane . to illustrate the theoretical cleanliness of the various observables , we show in fig .",
    "2 the combined constraints after hypothetical measurements of the observables .",
    "apart from the model independent analysis , an application to specific models shows , that np effects in the lht and the randall - sundrum model with custodial protection of left - handed z - couplings to down type quarks are small , as opposed to the mssm with a generic flavor violating soft sector . taking into account the strong constraints from @xmath45 and @xmath46",
    "it turns out that dominantly chargino contributions lead to sizeable effects .",
