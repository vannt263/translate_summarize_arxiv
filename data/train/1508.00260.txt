    "detailed understanding of diffusion processes is essential for various surface related phenomena such as heterogenous catalysis , epitaxial growth , surface reconstruction , phase transition , segregation , sintering and other topics in surface science @xcite .",
    "therefore a great deal of effort has been devoted towards the self - diffusion of single atom and clusters on metal surfaces@xcite both theoretically and experimentally @xcite .",
    "there has also been both experimental and theoretical efforts to find the activation barriers and prefactors for adatom diffusion process @xcite on various surfaces .",
    "although various theoretical investigations have been performed for ag / ag(111 ) system using embedded atom method ( eam ) @xcite , corrected effective medium theory ( cem ) @xcite , effective medium theory ( emt ) @xcite and ab initio calculations @xcite , but to the best of our knowledge there has been no systematic experimental or theoretical effort to understand diffusion mechanisms and calculate their activation barriers for small ag islands on ag(111 ) surface .",
    "accordingly , in this article we focus on the identification and calculation of the diffusion processes and their activation barriers for self - diffusion of small ag islands ( @xmath1 atoms ) on ag(111 ) surface as function of island size .    due to the presence of two three - fold adsorption sites ( fcc and hcp ) on fcc(111 ) surface ( fig .",
    "[ fig1ab](b ) ) , adsorption energies for a single atom or cluster on this surface may differ for different systems leading to different diffusion pattern on this surface .",
    "it is therefore important to identify these differences in adsorption energies and various activation energies for the diffusion processes in these systems as accuratly as possible .",
    "density functional theory ( dft ) based calculations for the activation energies of diffusion processes , are most accurate to resolve such differences but are very time consuming . on the other hand classical molecular static calculations using interaction potential",
    "are very fast and easy to manage but their accuracy is determined by the interaction potential used . therefore in this study",
    "we have done detailed dft calculations for the activation energies for some of the important diffusion processes and compare them with those obtained from interaction - potential based molecular static calculations to validate the accuracy of our approach .    as potential energy surface of the atomically flat fcc(111 )",
    "surface is least corrugated , it results in low activation barriers even for clusters to diffuse as a whole on this surface",
    ". therefore studies of diffusion processes on this surface is a challenging problem for both experiments and simulations . for smaller islands ( upto tetramer )",
    "all possible diffusion processes can be listed , but as island size gets larger it becomes more difficult to enumerate all possible diffusion processes _ a priori_. on the other hand , as diffusion processes are rare events , molecular dynamics ( md ) simulation can not capture every microscopic processes possible .",
    "therefore , to do a systematic study of small ag island diffusion on ag ( 111 ) surface we have used on - lattice self - learning kinetic monte carlo ( slkmc - ii ) method @xcite , which automatically finds all the relevant atomistic processes and their activation barriers on - the - fly for system under study .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sim_details ]",
    "we briefly discuss slkmc - ii method and describe the way through which various diffusion processes are identified and their activation barriers are calculated . in section  [ results ] we present details of single - atom , multi - atom and concerted diffusion processes responsible for the diffusion of ag islands of size @xmath1 atoms on ag(111 ) surface .",
    "section  [ diffusion coefficients and effective energy barriers ] provide quantitative analysis of the results of the diffusion coefficients and effective energy barriers of the islands studied .",
    "last section  [ discussion ] is devoted to the discussion and conclusions .",
    "to study self diffusion of ag islands on fcc ag(111 ) surface , we have carried out slkmc simulations using an extended pattern recognition scheme @xcite which includes both fcc and hcp sites in the identification of neighborhood around an atom .",
    "further details on simulation cell size , calculation of energy barriers for various diffusion processes and other details can be found elsewhere@xcite .    in order to check the accuracy of our approach for the calculation of energy barriers ,",
    "we have verified the energy barriers of some of the key concerted diffusion processes for various island sizes of ag / ag(111 ) system using climbing image nudged elastic band ( ci - neb ) method as implemented in the vasp code @xcite employing the projector augmented wave ( paw ) @xcite and plane - wave basis set methods , setting the kinetic energy cutoff for plane - wave expansion to 500 ev and describing exchange - correlation interaction between electrons by the perdew - burke - ernzerhof functional ( pbe ) @xcite .",
    "for all cases , we have used slab size of 5x5x4 ( for 10 atoms island we use a @xmath2 slab ) layers with a vaccume of 15  .",
    "we relax all surface structures , using the conjugate - gradient algorithm @xcite , until all force components acting on each atom is smaller than 0.01 ev /  . in all calculations , after initial relaxation of the slab where all atoms were relaxed , we fix the bottom three layers . in calculating energy barriers and searching transition states ,",
    "we first use the nudged elastic band ( neb ) method @xcite for preliminarily determining a minimum energy path , then apply a climbing image nudged elastic band ( ci - neb ) @xcite calculation .",
    "we find that using neb followed by ci - neb calculations is efficient in searching transition states than performing neb alone . here in",
    ", we use the term  ( ci-)neb \" to refer a combination of neb and ci - neb calculations . in all ( ci)-neb calculations",
    ", we used 7 images in each case .    in all our calculations we use the same pre - exponential factor of @xmath3 s@xmath4 for all diffusion processes for our kmc simulations ,",
    "this has been proven to be a good assumption for the systems like the present one@xcite .",
    "in order to uniquely identify whether an adatom is on an fcc or on an hcp site on the fcc(111 ) surface requires knowledge of at least @xmath5 layers , namely the top layer of the substrate and the layer below .",
    "therefore , the same convention as in our previous study ( ref .  ) is followed .",
    "that is , the center of an upward - pointing triangle formed by the substrate atoms is an fcc site , and the center of a downward - pointing triangle is the hcp site . on the fcc(111 ) surface ,",
    "all atoms in an island can sit on fcc sites or on hcp sites or on a combination of both sites , called fcc- , hcp- and mixed - island , respectively .",
    "furthermore , activation barriers of single - atom processes depend on various factors including the type of step - edge , namely a- or b- type , ( see fig.1(b ) in ref .  ) along which atom diffuses . depending on the type of material either the fcc - island or the hcp - island or mixed - island can be energetically favorable , but in case of ag(111 ) surface it is always the fcc - island with few exceptions as .    a compact adatom island ( called island from hereon ) on an fcc(111 )",
    "surface can move in the three directions ( movement of a compact island along other three directions going over the top sites usually results in processes with large energy barriers which are not selected for the range of temperature used in these simulations and hence we do not include them in this study to speed up simulations ) shown in fig.[fig1ab ] .",
    "note that the numbering scheme for the directions open to an atom on an fcc site is inverse to that for those open to an atom on an hcp site ( see fig.[fig1ab ] ) .",
    "we follow the enumeration convention for directions distinguished in fig.[fig1ab ] throughout the article in tabulating activation barriers for various processes .",
    "our slkmc simulations automatically discovered various types of concerted , multi- and single - atom diffusion processes for the island sizes studied .",
    "concerted diffusion processes involve all atoms moving together from all - fcc sites to all - hcp sites or vice - versa . a concerted process can be either a concerted translation of the entire island in one of the three directions shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1ab ] or concerted rotation of the entire island around the axis through the center of mass of the island perpendicular to the substrate surface , either clockwise or anti - clockwise .",
    "concerted rotational processes may ( for example in the case of dimer ) or may not ( for example in the case of trimer ) produce any displacement in the center of mass of the island whereas concerted translation processes always produces the maximum displacement ( @xmath6 ) in the center of mass of the island . note that in our simulations , concerted rotation processes were observed for dimer and trimer . on the other hand concerted translation processes",
    "were observed for compact islands of all sizes . for a particular island size ( usually compact islands )",
    ", activation barriers for the concerted processes along the three directions can be different ( depending upon the type of step - edge along the diffusion direction ) except for highly symmetric geometries like trimers and heptamers . also activation barriers for concerted processes for a compact fcc - island along different directions are different than for those of the compact hcp - island of the same size .",
    "we will discuss concerted diffusion processes for various island sizes in this section .",
    "various types of multi - atom diffusion processes like , shearing , reptation and rotation were found mainly for island sizes from 5 - 10 atoms . in the case of shearing process ,",
    "part of the island ( usually more than one atoms ) move from fcc to fcc ( or from hcp to hcp sites ) . on the other hand ,",
    "reptation  @xcite is a two - step shearing process that move the cluster from all - fcc to all - hcp sites or the reverse : first , part of the island moves from fcc to hcp sites ( hcp to fcc ) creating a dislocation ; then the rest of the island moves from fcc to hcp ( hcp to fcc ) .",
    "hence at the intermediate stage , the island has mixed fcc - hcp occupancy . we have also observed multi - atom rotation processes , mostly involving trimers .",
    "multi - atom processes like shearing is mainly found for compact or almost compact islands where as for mixed - islands , repetition and rotation were observed from island size 5 to 10 atoms .",
    "activation barriers for multi - atom ( including shearing , reptation and rotation ) processes depend on the type of the island ( fcc- or hcp- or mixed - island ) as well as type of step - edge along which diffusion process takes place . as island size increases , number of multi- as well as single - atom processes increases .",
    "multi - atom processes are discussed in detail when we take up islands of size 8 - 10 where as single atom processes are discussed in subsection .",
    "[ singleatoms ] .      in this section",
    "key diffusion processes of the various general types ( concerted , multi - atom and single - atom ) are discussed in detail .",
    "in addition , activation barriers for some of the concerted diffusion processes are compared with those obtained from dft calculations . note that values on top of each pair of figures are the relative energies for those configurations .      on fcc(111 ) surface",
    ", a dimer can have three possible arrangements ; two dimers with both atoms on hcp sites ( called hh - dimer , fig .",
    "[ dimer](a ) ) or on fcc sites ( called ff - dimer , fig .",
    "[ dimer](b ) ) and a dimer with one atom on fcc and the other on hcp site ( called fh - dimer , fig .  [ dimer1](a ) ) .",
    "note that both ff- and hh- dimers have equal lenght step edges of both a- and b - type .",
    "our calculations show that ff - dimer is energetically more favorable ( 0.001 ev from eam potential and 0.007 ev from dft calculations ) than hh - dimer whereas fh - dimer is less favorable ( 0.033 ev ) than ff - dimer .",
    "there are two different types of concerted diffusion processes , namely concerted translations ( two symmetric translations along direction 2 and 3 and another one along direction 1 ) and concerted rotations ( both clockwise and anti - clockwise ) for both hh- and ff - dimers as shown in fig .",

    "the diffusion coefficient of an adatom island is calculated by d = lim@xmath14 ( [ r@xmath15(t ) - r@xmath15(0)]@xmath16)/2dt , where d is the diffusion coefficient , r@xmath15(t ) is the position of the center of mass of the island at time t , and d is the dimensionality of the system which in our case is @xmath5 .",

    "to summarize , we have performed a systematic study of the diffusion of small ag ( 1 - 10 atom ) islands on ag(111 ) surface , using newly developed self learning kmc ( slkmc - ii ) simulations in which the system is allowed to evolve through mechanisms of its choice with the usage of a self - generated database of single - atom , multi - atom and concerted diffusion processes .",
    "specifically , diffusion processes like concerted processes and multi - atom processes involving fcc - fcc , fcc - hcp and hcp - hcp jumps are automatically found during the simulations .",
    "we find that these small - sized islands diffuse primarily through concerted motion with a small contribution from single atom processes , even though for certain cases the frequency of single atom processes is large because of lower activation energies . furthermore multi - atom processes including shearing and reptation , which are activated at higher temperature , contributes rarely to the diffusion of island .",
    "interestingly enough , energy barriers for reptation processes are small but they are only occurred when island shape is non - compact which is rare for the temperature range we study here .",
    "we present in fig .",
    "[ database ] the total number of processes found by our simulations for different island sizes .",
    "as can be seen from it , number of processes increase exponentially , specially beyond 4-atom island , suggesting the need for an automatic way of finding all the possible processes during simulations . also by the inclusion of fcc and hcp sites in the pattern recognition scheme",
    "allows us to get all possible concerted processes which involve motion from fcc - hcp sites .",
    "[ database ] also shown single atom and multi atom processes . allowing the system the possibility of evolving in time through all types of processes of its choice , we are able to establish the relative significance of various types of atomistic processes through considerations of the kinetics and not just the energetics and/or the thermodynamics , as is often done . for small ag islands on ag(111 ) , we find the effective barriers for diffusion to scale with island size .",
