    "therefore , lattice thermal conductivity dominates @xmath58 which exhibits a peak at around 60 k ( fig .",

    "umklapp scattering dominates at high temperatures , while boundary and point - defect scattering dominate at low and intermediate temperatures , respectively.@xcite on the other hand , the @xmath52 of srfbis@xmath0 shows similar behavior to bi@xmath2o@xmath2s@xmath7 but with different peak position and absolute value.@xcite for tep @xmath53 of srfbis@xmath0 , there is a reversal in sign at about 11 k , i.e , hole - like carrier changes into electron - like carrier which is dominant at room temperature .",
    "according to two band model , @xmath59.@xcite if we assume that @xmath60 and @xmath61 are temperature independent , it suggests that electron and hole conductivities change dramatically with temperature : at low temperature , @xmath62 whereas @xmath63 above 11 k. hole - like carrier may originate from defect induced p - type doping . with increasing temperature , electron - like carrier due to intrinsic band excitation increase significantly , finally leading to @xmath64 and a sign change in @xmath53 .",
