    "the microscopic many - body interaction of particles of the fermi systems such as heavy nuclei is rather complicated .",
    "therefore , several theoretical approaches to the description of the hamiltonian which are based on the statistical properties of its discrete levels are applied for solutions of the realistic problems . for a quantitative measure of the degree of chaoticity of the many - body forces ,",
    "the statistical distributions of the spacing between the nearest neighboring levels were introduced , first of all in relation to the so called random matrix theory @xcite .",
    "integrability ( order ) of the system was associated usually to the poisson - like exponentially decreasing dependence on the spacing variable with a maximum at zero while chaoticity was connected more to the wigner - like behavior with the zero spacing probability at zero but with a maximum at some finite value of this variable .    on the other hand , many dynamical problems , in particular , in nuclear physics can be reduced to the collective motion of independent particles in a mean field with a relatively sharp time - dependent edge called usually as the effective surface within the microscopic - macroscopic approximation @xcite .",
    "we may begin with the basic ideas of swiatecki and his collaborators @xcite . in recent years",
    "it became apparent that the collective nuclear dynamics is very much related to the nature of the nucleonic motion .",
    "this behavior of the nucleonic dynamics is important in physical processes like fission or heavy ion collisions where a great amount of the collective energy is dissipated into a chaotic nucleonic motion .",
    "we have to mention here also very intensive studies of the one - body dissipative phenomena described largely through the macroscopic wall formula ( w.f . ) for the excitation energy @xcite and also quantum results @xcite .",
    "the analytical w.f . was suggested originally in ref .",
    "@xcite on the basis of the thomas - fermi approach .",
    "it was re - derived in many works based on semiclassical and quantum arguments , see refs  @xcite for instance .",
    "however , some problems in the analytical study of a multipolarity dependence of the smooth one - body friction and its oscillating corrections as functions of the particle number should be still clarified .",
    "in particular , we would like to emphasize the importance of the transparent classical picture through the poincare sections and lyapunov exponents showing the order - chaos transitions @xcite and also quantum results for the excitation energy @xcite .",
    "then , the peculiarities of the excitation energies for many periods of the oscillations of the classical dynamics were discussed for several legendre polynomials , see ref .  @xcite . as the classical measures of chaoticity .",
    "the shell correction method @xcite was successfully used to describe the shell effects in the nuclear deformation energies as functions of the particle numbers .",
    "this is important also for understanding analytically the origin of the isomers in fission within the periodic orbit theory ( pot ) @xcite .",
    "we should expect also that the deviations of the level density near the fermi surface , like shell effects , from an averaged constant should influence essentially the nearest neighbor spacing distribution ( nnsd ) . for a further study of the order - chaos properties of the fermi systems",

    "the quantitative measure of the order ( or symmetry ) can be the number of the single - valued integrals of motion , except for the energy ( degree of the degeneracy of the system , see also refs  @xcite ) .",
