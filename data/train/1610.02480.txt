    "a more precise stoichiometric determination was achieved using @xmath92-ray photoelectron spectroscopy ( xps ) either at the shanghai synchrotron radiation facility or at the stanford synchrotron radiation lightsource .      for scanning transmission electron microscopy imaging we used a jeol 2200fs spherical aberration corrected tool operated under 200 kv . when using a 25.6 mrad convergence angle",
    "our probe size was 0.9  .",
    "although 200 kv is most likely above the sample damage threshold , we used limited acquisition times and beam exposure to minimize the possible changes to the sample structure .",

    "<S> * mote@xmath0 is an exfoliable transition metal dichalcogenide ( tmd ) which crystallizes in three symmetries ; the semiconducting trigonal - prismatic @xmath1phase , the semimetallic @xmath2 monoclinic phase , and the semimetallic orthorhombic @xmath3 structure @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath1phase displays a band gap of @xmath4 ev@xcite making it appealing for flexible and transparent optoelectronics . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath5phase is predicted to possess unique topological properties @xcite which might lead to topologically protected non - dissipative transport channels @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> recently , it was argued that it is possible to locally induce phase - transformations in tmds @xcite , through chemical doping @xcite , local heating @xcite , or electric - field @xcite to achieve ohmic contacts or to induce useful functionalities such as electronic phase - change memory elements@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the combination of semiconducting and topological elements based upon the same compound , might produce a new generation of high performance , low dissipation optoelectronic elements . here , we show that it is possible to engineer the phases of mote@xmath0 through w substitution by unveiling the phase - diagram of the mo@xmath6w@xmath7te@xmath0 solid solution which displays a semiconducting to semimetallic transition as a function of @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> we find that only @xmath9 % of w stabilizes the @xmath5phase at room temperature . </S>",
    "<S> photoemission spectroscopy , indicates that this phase possesses a fermi surface akin to that of wte@xmath0 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> *    the properties of semiconducting and of semimetallic mote@xmath0 are of fundamental interest in their own right , but are also for their potential technological relevance . in the mono- or few - layer limit </S>",
    "<S> it is a direct - gap semiconductor , while the bulk has an indirect bandgap @xcite of @xmath10 1 ev . </S>",
    "<S> the size of the gap is similar to that of si , making @xmath1mote@xmath0 particularly appealing for both purely electronic devices @xcite and optoelectronic applications @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the existence of different phases opens up the possibility for many novel devices and architectures . </S>",
    "<S> for example , controlled conversion of the @xmath11mote@xmath0 phase to the @xmath1phase , as recently reported @xcite , could enable circuits composed of a single material functioning as both semiconducting channels and metallic interconnects . </S>",
    "<S> more precise control of the phase change might also be used to minimize the metal - semiconductor schottky barrier by continuous evolution of the electronic band structure , in order to overcome current limits on optoelectronic performance @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , recent work has reported contact phase engineering by laser processing@xcite and chemical modification@xcite .            .    </S>",
    "<S> the ability to phase - engineer mote@xmath0 has many broader applications and potentially deeper implications . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , doping , temperature , strain , and electric fields can be used to drive metal - to - insulator transitions @xcite for sensors and nonvolatile information storage . </S>",
    "<S> more fundamentally , the electronic structure of mono - layers of semimetallic mote@xmath0 ( and of wte@xmath0 ) have been proposed to possess a @xmath12 topological invariant characteristic of a quantum spin hall - effect ground - state which has a gap in the bulk and non - dissipative edge states @xcite . if confirmed @xcite , these edge states could be used for dissipation - free nano - interconnects between logical elements based on semiconducting @xmath1mote@xmath0 for low - power electronics . </S>",
    "<S> more recent theoretical developments also claim that both orthorhombic mote@xmath0 and wte@xmath0 would be candidates for a new type of weyl semimetallic state characterized by linear touching points between hole- and electron - fermi surfaces , where the berry - phase would present topological singularities @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these singularities , which were recently claimed to have been observed in the orthorhombic phase of mote@xmath0 @xcite , could lead to unconventional transport properties .    to fully control and utilize phase transitions in the two - dimensional ( 2d ) tellurides , </S>",
    "<S> it is crucial to understand the phase diagram in detail . in particular , doping of the lattice can be used to precisely tune the semiconducting - metallic phase transition , and in fact w doping is known to induce a phase transition @xcite from the @xmath1 to an orthorhombic structure , originally identified as the @xmath11phase , in mo@xmath6w@xmath7te@xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> early studies identified a structural phase - transition from @xmath13 to @xmath14 for @xmath15 , and with a zone of phase coexistence for @xmath16 @xcite </S>",
    "<S> . however , given the renewed interest in this material , there is strong motivation to revisit the question of the precise evolution of the phases in the 2d tellurides with doping .    here </S>",
    "<S> , we synthesize bulk crystals of mo@xmath6w@xmath7te@xmath0 alloys , and characterize their composition and structure through a combination of techniques including electron microscopy , x - ray diffraction , scanning tunneling microscopy , and raman spectroscopy . </S>",
    "<S> we find that w doping produces homogeneous alloys , with no phase coexistence as previously observed @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the structural phase transition from the semiconducting @xmath1phase towards the orthorhombic and semimetallic @xmath17phase is sharp and occurs at a modest critical molar fraction @xmath18 . </S>",
    "<S> since crystals with @xmath19 are likely to be susceptible to small perturbations such as strain or electric field , this opens the possibility of reversibly controlling the structural , and therefore electronic properties , of the mo@xmath6w@xmath7te@xmath0 series . </S>",
    "<S> additionally , we show through angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy that the geometry of the fermi surface of @xmath17mo@xmath6w@xmath7te@xmath0 is remarkably similar to that of wte@xmath0 , thus confirming its semimetallic character .    </S>",
    "<S> single crystals of the mo@xmath6w@xmath7te@xmath0 series were grown through a chemical vapor transport technique as described in methods . unless otherwise noted , samples were cooled slowly in order to obtain the equilibrium phase at room temperature . </S>",
    "<S> their precise stoichiometry was determined through energy dispersive @xmath20ray spectroscopy ( eds ) and photoelectron spectroscopy ( xps ) , see methods as well as supplementary fig . </S>",

    "<S> , the crystals were exfoliated following a standard procedure and transferred onto a tem grid , see methods . </S>",
    "<S> figures 1a and 1b display atomic resolution stem images collected from two distinct multi - layered crystals with compositions of mo@xmath24w@xmath25te@xmath0 and mo@xmath26w@xmath27te@xmath0 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> these crystals display distinct crystallographic structures : @xmath28 shows the hexagonal pattern characteristic of the trigonal prismatic or the @xmath1 phase , while @xmath29 shows a striped pattern consistent with either the @xmath11 or the @xmath14-phase . in supplementary fig . </S>",
    "<S> s3 we have included stem and electron diffraction images for @xmath29 from whose analysis we conclude that it crystallizes in the orthorhombic @xmath14 phase . nevertheless , in figs . </S>",
    "<S> 1c and 1d we also show single - crystal xrd patterns for @xmath30 and @xmath31 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> analysis of these patterns confirms that crystals with @xmath32 crystallize in the @xmath1phase , whereas crystals with @xmath33 , in this case @xmath34 , display the orthorhombic @xmath17phase instead of the monoclinic @xmath11 one . </S>",
    "<S> supplementary fig . </S>",
    "<S> s4 shows @xmath20ray diffraction patterns for mo@xmath35w@xmath36te@xmath0 and mo@xmath37w@xmath38te@xmath0 , also indicating the @xmath17phase for these concentrations . </S>",
    "<S> our complete set of structural studies indicate that for all concentrations @xmath39 , w doping stabilizes the semimetallic @xmath14 phase , confirming that the structural transition is sharp and occurs at a w doping level significantly lower than previously reported @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> figure 1e shows a larger - scale stem image of mo@xmath24w@xmath25te@xmath0 . in this image </S>",
    "<S> , bright dots surrounded by three additional dots ( te atoms ) correspond to randomly distributed w atoms , as highlighted in fig . </S>",

    "<S> therefore , the stem images clearly indicate that the mo@xmath6w@xmath7te@xmath0 series results from a homogeneous dilution of w atoms into a mote@xmath0 matrix and not from the coexistence of @xmath1mote@xmath0 and wte@xmath0 domains . </S>",

    "<S> therefore , we have enough resolution to observe vacancies , but we do not observe the coexistence of distinct crystallographic phases .    </S>",
    "<S> thus tem , stm , and xrd analysis yield consistent results , namely a transition from the @xmath13 phase to the @xmath14 phase at @xmath18 , with no phase coexistence even near the phase boundary . </S>",
    "<S> these observations stand in contrast to the early work in ref . , which reported a higher critical w concentration and a region of phase coexistence near the boundary . </S>",
    "<S> this discrepancy is likely attributable to the difference between the methods of synthesis used for each study . </S>",

    "<S> s6 we show raman spectra for @xmath17mo@xmath50w@xmath51te@xmath0 as the number of layers decrease , indicating that the @xmath14-phase is stable down to the single - layer limit despite its high mo content . </S>",
    "<S> figure 2b shows raman spectra for several stoichiometries of the mo@xmath6w@xmath7te@xmath0 series . </S>",
    "<S> mo@xmath6w@xmath7te@xmath0 crystallizes in the @xmath1phase for concentrations up to @xmath52 . for concentrations beyond this value </S>",

    "<S> these data support the conclusions reached by the structural probes above , namely a phase transition around @xmath18 with no evidence for phase coexistence . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , as the w concentration increases beyond @xmath55 we see the emergence of peaks which , at the first glance , would seem to be related to the @xmath47 and the @xmath48 modes of the @xmath2-phase @xcite . however , single crystal @xmath20ray diffraction shown in fig . 1d and in supplementary fig . </S>",

    "<S> 2b must be associated with the orthorhombic @xmath14phase , with certain peaks shifted with respect to those of wte@xmath0 due to the high mo content . </S>",
    "<S> an important observation is that raman scattering yields nearly identical spectra for @xmath11mote@xmath0 and for @xmath17mo@xmath6w@xmath7te@xmath0 , for reasons that will have to be clarified through theoretical calculations . </S>",
    "<S> we note that this similarity might lead to misidentification of the @xmath2 phase if raman spectroscopy is the only method used to probe the crystal structure . in supplementary fig . </S>",

    "<S> s1 ) . </S>",
    "<S> this suggests that the mo / w layer is sandwiched by the te layers , making the te layer the exposed surface . to investigate the electronic structure along the @xmath61-direction of the three - dimensional brillouin zone ( bz ) , which is depicted in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3a , we performed photon - energy - dependent arpes measurements with energies ranging from 40 to 90 ev . figure 3b shows the arpes spectra at the fermi level @xmath62 as a function of the momentum and photon energy from 55 to 75 ev . </S>",

    "<S> figure 3c shows the fermi surface of mo@xmath67w@xmath68te@xmath0 acquired at @xmath69 ev . the fermi surface along the y-@xmath63-y direction shows two hole - pockets and two - electron pockets at either side of @xmath63 which would seem to touch . </S>",
    "<S> this geometry for the fermi surface of mo@xmath67w@xmath68te@xmath0 ( as well as its overall electronic band - structure ) is remarkably similar to the one reported in ref . for wte@xmath0 and </S>",
    "<S> therefore remarkably different from the one already reported @xcite for orthorhombic mote@xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> this difference is particularly striking given its considerably larger content of mo relative to w. notice that such a simple fermi surface would be in broad agreement with our recent study @xcite on the quantum oscillatory phenomena observed in @xmath14-mote@xmath0 .    </S>",

    "<S> the band connecting the hole- and the electron - like pockets is assigned to a surface state , which have already been claimed to be topologically nontrivial @xcite . when compared to the calculations in ref . </S>",
    "<S> the conduction band minimum is observed to be very close to the fermi level , which makes this surface state not as easily detectable as one would expect from the calculations . the surface state is more clearly exposed in supplementary fig . </S>",

    "<S> figure 4 shows powder xrd patterns for a sample with @xmath76 , at different temperatures upon heating from room - temperature . above @xmath77 @xmath78c , </S>",

    "<S> , width=6 ]    the proposed phase diagram , shown in figure 5 , depicts a sharp phase - boundary between the @xmath1 and the @xmath14 phases at @xmath18 , and the boundary between the @xmath1 and @xmath11 phases at @xmath85c . in supplementary fig . </S>",
    "<S> s9 we compare @xmath20ray powder diffraction data among samples crystallizing in the @xmath1 and in the @xmath17phases and the role of the temperature . </S>",
    "<S> the important point is that , in contrast to the @xmath1phase , and even for samples with a w concentration very close to the critical one , we could not detect a structural phase - transition as a function of @xmath83 in samples crystallizing in the @xmath17phase . given that the orthorhombic @xmath17phase becomes the ground state of @xmath11mote@xmath0 and the larger area occupied by it in the phase diagram , one is led to conclude that it is thermodynamically more stable than the latter phase . </S>",
    "<S> the most remarkable feature of the phase diagram is the very small concentration in w required to stabilize the orthorhombic semi - metallic @xmath17phase , and not the coexistence of the @xmath1 and the @xmath11 phases as predicted by ref . </S>",

    "<S> it is quite remarkable that a semiconducting band gap as large as @xmath4 ev@xcite for @xmath1mote@xmath0 , can be entirely suppressed by substituting just @xmath87 % of mo for w which stabilizes a semimetallic state , as clearly indicated by angle resolved photoemission experiments . here </S>",
    "<S> , the situation bears a certain resemblance with the transition metal oxides such as the cuprates , whose charge- or mott - gap is estimated to be @xmath88 ev , but where a small concentration of dopants , in the order of 5 % , is enough to stabilize a metallic state ( albeit anomalous ) and even superconductivity @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this clearly indicates that both the structural and the concomitant electronic phases of mote@xmath0 are particularly susceptible to small perturbations . </S>",
    "<S> this suggests that it should be possible to reversibly induce structural - transitions through the application of strain @xcite or an electric field @xcite , particularly in @xmath1mo@xmath6w@xmath7te@xmath0 crystals with @xmath19 . </S>",
    "<S> this would make the @xmath1mo@xmath6w@xmath7te@xmath0 series particularly appealing for the development of phase - change memory devices@xcite or for a new generation of optoelectronic devices , whose metallic interconnects could be created or  erased \" at will through the application of an electrical signal , instead of a chemical treatment . finally , the fact that the mo@xmath6w@xmath7te@xmath0 series produce homogeneous alloys , is not only a major result of this study , but opens the unique possibility of exploring the evolution of their predicted topological / electronic properties @xcite , and of perhaps detecting topological phase - transitions in the bulk as well as in the surface state through the evolution of the fermi surface . in effect , arpes indicates that the fermi surfaces of @xmath17mote@xmath0 ( ref . ) and of @xmath17mo@xmath6w@xmath7te@xmath0 ( this work ) are remarkably different , a fact that can only be reconciled with an electronic / topological phase - transition as a function of w doping . in effect , since w doping tends to stabilize the @xmath14-phase , it is reasonable to expect that one can stabilize it also in samples containing small amounts of w by quickly cooling the crystals to room temperature during the synthesis process . </S>",
    "<S> this would produce a phase - diagram not containing the region originally occupied by the @xmath1phase . </S>",
    "<S> this set of orthorhombic samples would allow us to explore the evolution of the fermi surface as a function of w doping to understand , for example , how the large hole - pocket seen by arpes at the center of the brillouin zone @xcite disappears to originate the hole - pockets seen by us at either side of zone center . such electronic phase - transition should lead to either the suppression or the displacement of the weyl - points already seen by arpes , or to a concomitant topological phase - transition as a function of w doping . </S>"
