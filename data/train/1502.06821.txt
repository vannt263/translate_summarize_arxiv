    "power - line communications ( plc ) offer nowadays a very interesting alternative to wireless communication systems by reusing the existing electrical network infrastructure to transmit high data rates .",
    "however , power line channel suffers from severe conditions such as impulsive noise , channel attenuation , and multipath effects .",
    "a good understanding of its characteristics is of great importance when developing plc transmission chains and simulating the performance of advanced communications technologies .    to overcome multipath effect and channel attenuation ,",
    "much effort has been dedicated to characterizing and modeling plc channels @xcite .",
    "different types of noise are distinguished over plc networks @xcite , among them the asynchronous impulsive noise is known to be the most detrimental noise term as it exhibits the highest power spectral density ( psd ) and may thus cause bit or burst errors in data transmission .",
    "it can reach values of 50 db above the background noise with impulses widths that fluctuate from some microseconds to a few milliseconds @xcite .",
    "different statistically - based approaches for modeling the plc asynchronous impulsive noise have been proposed in the literature @xcite .",
    "bernoulli - gaussian ( bg )  @xcite and middleton  class  a  @xcite are two commonly used plc impulsive noise models , examples of bg noise - based studies are @xcite and @xcite .",
    "these models provide a closed - form and simple probability density function ( pdf ) expression which is needed in designing optimum receivers of low complexity .",
    "however , they do not represent the bursty nature of the impulses observed over plc channels , as they assume independent impulse emission .",
    "recently , more realistic models have been proposed which better fit the physical properties of real impulsive noise .",
    "these are markovian - based bg and middleton noise models , which enable the impulses to be replicated over several consecutive noise samples @xcite .    in this paper ,",
    "we derive an easily tractable noise model from the pulse train model proposed in @xcite , which can be fully described by three random parameters : the impulse amplitude , the impulse width and the inter - arrival time , whose statistical properties can be retrieved from measurements @xcite .",
    "we propose a thorough analysis of the impact of impulsive noise parameters on the bit error rate ( ber ) performance of orthogonal frequency division multiplexing ( ofdm ) broadband plc .",
    "we applied the conventional bg impulsive noise model and compared the ber results using the two models .",
    "the results exhibited the difference between the two approaches , showing the importance of the considered model .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . the plc channel model and the impulsive noise model considered in our system are presented in section  ii .",
    "section  iii provides the simulation results and finally section  iv concludes the paper .",
    "an interesting parametric model for plc channel transfer functions ( ctf ) based on physical effects , such as multi - path signal propagation and cable losses , is presented in @xcite .",
    "the model parameters can be obtained from well - known geometry network measurements . for the purpose of capturing the random aspect of plc channels and representing its characteristics , statistical extension of this model has been proposed in @xcite .",
    "this work has been refined and built on in @xcite , where the ctf defined in the frequency band 2 - 100 mhz is given by : @xmath0 where @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 are constant parameters and can be obtained from fitting the model to channel measurements ; @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath5 describe the characteristics of the cables ; @xmath4 is the phase velocity of the wave inside power line cables and equal to @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the speed of light in vacuum and @xmath9 is the dielectric constant of the insulating material .",
    "the parameters @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 , and @xmath13 are random variables @xcite ; @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the path gain coefficients that result from the product of the reflection and transmission coefficients ; @xmath12 is the length of the @xmath14-th path ; @xmath13 is the number of paths .    in this work",
    ", a channel transfer function @xmath15 is set from eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) .",
    "the chosen values of the path - depend parameters are presented in table  [ table1 ] ; @xmath13 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath4 and @xmath1 are @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 , respectively .",
    "the power of @xmath15 in db scale in the frequency band  @xmath21 mhz is shown in figure  [ fig1 ] .",
    ".parameters for @xmath15 [ cols=\"^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ table1 ]            one of the popular plc asynchronous impulsive noise models is the bg model @xcite . according to this model ,",
    "the total noise seen by the receiver can be considered as a combination of two distributions : an awgn background noise @xmath22 with zero mean and @xmath23 variance , and an independent impulsive noise @xmath24 given by @xmath25 where @xmath26 is a bernoulli process and @xmath27 is a gaussian process of variance @xmath28 . the total noise , denoted by @xmath29 , is therefore given by : @xmath30 and has the following pdf @xcite : @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the probability of occurrence of impulsive noise ; @xmath33 is the impulsive to gaussian power ratio ; @xmath34 is the gaussian density defined for real noise as : @xmath35      in this paper , we derive a low complex noise model from the pulse train model proposed in @xcite .",
    "we consider the noise as a sum of background noise and impulsive noise , similar to bg noise model .",
    "the general expression of the bursty noise model is given by : @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the impulse function with unit amplitude and unit width ; @xmath38 and @xmath39 are two zero - mean gaussian realizations with variance equal to one ; @xmath40 is the number of impulses present over the transmission time ; @xmath41 and @xmath42 are gaussian and impulsive noise amplitudes , respectively ; @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath45 are impulse amplitude , impulse arrival time and impulse time width , respectively .",
    "the three random parameters @xmath46 , @xmath45 and the interarrival time @xmath47 can be statistically modeled in a frequency band up to 20  mhz using an exponential distribution @xcite .",
    "consequently , for a given @xmath48 , the bursty noise model can be generated through the three mean parameters of the exponential distributions .",
    "the mean parameters of @xmath46 , @xmath47 and @xmath45 are denoted by @xmath49 , @xmath50 and @xmath51 , respectively .",
    "the impulsive noise is characterized by a high psd that can reach values of more than 50 db above the background noise @xcite .",
    "consequently , three different values of @xmath49 were set in this study , which are 10 , 100 , and 1000 .",
    "practical values of @xmath50 and @xmath51 in plc are @xmath52 and @xmath53 , respectively @xcite .",
    "three other values of @xmath50 of 0.005 , 0.05 and 0.1 were also taken into account in order to examine heavier and milder impulsive noise conditions .",
    "another value of @xmath51 of 1  @xmath54 was chosen to check the effect of the impulse width characteristic parameter on the system s performance .",
    "an example of the considered noise model for , and over a time duration of 500 ofdm symbols is presented in figure  [ fig2 ] .",
    "it can be noted that an impulse may affect one or several consecutive ofdm symbols , and many symbols are not affected by impulsive noise .",
    "it is also important to note that the effect of the impulsive noise is spread to all the subcarriers in an ofdm symbol due to the receiver discrete fourier transform ( dft ) operation .    , @xmath55 and .",
    "in this section , we provide simulation results of ber performance of ofdm system over a plc channel impaired by impulsive noise .",
    "we assumed ideal synchronization and the channel state information is supposed to be known at the receiver .",
    "the binary phase - shift keying ( bpsk ) modulation scheme is used .",
    "the ofdm modulator block is implemented using @xmath56 point inverse fast fourier transform ( ifft ) in the frequency band .",
    "the sampling frequency is 24.999936  mhz .",
    "the subcarrier spacing is 24.414  khz , in respect to the subcarrier spacing specified in homeplug alliance @xcite .",
    "after ifft , a 150 ( @xmath57 in time ) length cp is added at the beginning of the ofdm symbol .",
    "the length of the extended ofdm symbol is 1174 samples ( @xmath58 in time ) .",
    "the noise @xmath59 was generated over a transmission time of @xmath60 ofdm symbols before the symbols transmission . during a symbol transmission ,",
    "the amount of noise from the generated @xmath59 was then added to the symbol .",
    "the results are reported as a function of the signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) .",
    "the @xmath50 parameter , which is the mean interarrival time between impulses , can be considered as the most important characteristic parameter .",
    "it gives information about how much the system is affected by impulsive noise .",
    "figure  [ fig3 ] shows its influence on the ber performance for @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",
    "the lower the value of @xmath50 the more dense the impulses in the system , the more errors produced .",
    "this can explain the obtained results where it can be noted that @xmath50 has a significant influence on the ber performance .     and for @xmath63 and @xmath62 .",
    "]    in figure  [ fig4 ] , the system s performance is illustrated for @xmath64 and for two different values of each of @xmath49 and @xmath51 , while keeping the other parameter constant .",
    "this allows us to examine the influence of the two parameters @xmath49 and @xmath51 on the system .",
    "the @xmath49 parameter represents the mean ratio of the impulsive noise power to the background noise power .",
    "thus , the higher the @xmath49 , the more error produced in the system .",
    "this can explain the significant difference between the two resultant bers for @xmath65 and @xmath66 with @xmath62 .",
    "the @xmath51 parameter represents the mean time width of the impulses , thus the higher the value of @xmath51 the more signal samples affected by the impulses , the more errors produced .",
    "an impulse may affect one or more ofdm symbols resulting in burst errors in data transmission . by comparing the two resultant bers for @xmath62 and @xmath67 with @xmath66",
    ", it can be noted that the @xmath51 parameter can significantly change the system s performance . at high snr ,",
    "a value of @xmath51 of @xmath68 can affect significantly the system s performance ( see figure  [ fig4 ] ) .     and @xmath51 while keeping the other parameters constant . ]        for the reason of comparison , we applied a popular plc impulsive noise model to the plc channel , like bg model .",
    "the bg model is characterized by two parameters , @xmath32 and @xmath69 , as described previously .",
    "we checked the effect of the @xmath32 parameter by setting two values of @xmath70 and @xmath71 , while keeping @xmath72 .",
    "we also checked the effect of the @xmath69 parameter by setting two values of @xmath73 and @xmath74 with @xmath75 , the results are depicted in figure  [ fig5 ] .",
    "the @xmath32 and @xmath69 parameters are analogous to @xmath50 and @xmath49 parameters , respectively .",
    "it can be noted from figure  [ fig5 ] that they have a significant influence on the system s performance .    by comparing figure  [ fig5 ] with figures  [ fig3 ]  and  [ fig4 ]",
    ", it can be noticed that the resultant bers using the two noise models follow a different trend .",
    "the ofdm performance curves , using the bg model , have the same shape as the ber obtained with awgn , but with higher power .",
    "however , it is not the case , when the considered model is used .",
    "this can be attributed to the fact that the characteristic parameters of the two models are different .",
    "the @xmath32 parameter represents the probability of the occurrence of the impulses within the symbol duration .",
    "the effect of these impulses is spread over @xmath76 subcarriers resulting in ber performance that follows the same trend with awgn performance . on the other hand , by using the considered model , one impulse may affect one or several ofdm symbols , and many symbols may not affected by impulsive noise at all .    the bg model can be seen as an impulse train model with a similar expression to eq .",
    "( [ eq_burstymodel ] ) , with the @xmath77 function replaced by the dirac function ( without @xmath45 ) , and with bernoulli distributed @xmath44 . in order to reproduce the bg model performance using our considered model , we set the impulses widths @xmath45 to the sampling time @xmath78 , that is , we assumed independent impulse emission that are exponentially distributed in time with no memories ( widths ) .",
    "the @xmath50 parameter was chosen to have the same number of impulses within the symbol duration , compared with the bg model , and is given by : @xmath79 where @xmath80 and @xmath76 are the length of the extended ofdm symbol ( with the cp ) in time and samples , respectively . for @xmath81 and @xmath75 , @xmath66 and @xmath82 .",
    "the result is depicted in figure  [ fig5 ] , where it can be noticed that they are the same .",
    "in this paper , we proposed to use a pulse train model that is easily implemented on computer simulations and that well describes the asynchronous impulsive noise over ofdm broadband plc systems .",
    "we examined the influence of the three impulsive noise characteristics , namely the impulse amplitude , the impulse width and the interarrival time on the ber performance . a comparison with the conventional bg impulsive noise model highlighted the difference between the two approaches and showed that the bg model can be considered as a particular case of the considered model ."
