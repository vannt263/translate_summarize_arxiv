    "the band random matrix(brm ) model is a good basis for understanding basic features of quantum chaotic systems .",
    "it looks even more attractive in view of its analytical solution obtained by fyodorov and mirlin @xcite in the framework of the efetov s supersymmetry approach @xcite .",
    "being inspired by numerous earlier attempts@xcite to understand scaling properties of the brm model , the solution is proved to be an adequate tool to address the problem .",
    "recently , further extensive numerical studies of the rbm model for the real symmetric matrices ( we refer to this case as that of orthogonal ensemble ) has been done in the work@xcite . among many of interesting results concerning the scaling properties of the brm model ,",
    "very detailed data were presented for the _ time - averaged _ density - density correlator , known as the `` steady state distribution '' @xmath2 where @xmath3 are eigenfunctions of the hamiltonian considered to be a member of brm ensemble : @xmath4 and @xmath5 is the corresponding eigenvalue .",
    "the scaled coordinates enetering eq.([1 ] ) are @xmath6 , with @xmath7 being labels of the components of brm eigenvectors and @xmath1 being the band widths .",
    "the bar stands for the averaging over the random matrix ensemble .    in @xcite",
    "the data for the correlator ( [ e : corrtiav ] ) has been fitted by the theoretical expression obtained long time ago by gogolin@xcite for strictly 1d anderson model .",
    "the gogolin s expression contains the localisation length @xmath8 as a parameter .",
    "a reasonable agreement has been found for the length parameter value @xmath9 .",
    "this value is rather close to the localization length @xmath10 expected for the _ orthogonal _ brm ensemble with the matrix size @xmath11 .",
    "differs substantially from @xmath12 .",
    "this is however a consequence of incorrect use of the localization length @xmath13 defined for the _ unitary _ ( see eq.(4),(5 ) in ref.@xcite ) instead of the _ orthogonal _ brm ensemble .",
    "the localisation length @xmath12 for the unitary class is known to be twice as large in comparison with that for the orthogonal class . ) ]    however , the fit done in @xcite is in fact not very legitimate .",
    "the reason is that the gogolin expression is not relevant for the correlator ( [ e : corrtiav ] ) and represents another quantity : a _ `` fixed energy '' _ correlator defined as @xmath14 it is easy to see , that time - averaged correlator can be obtained from the `` fixed energy '' one by integration over the energy .",
    "since the localization length parameter depends essentialy on the energy , the integration can modify the correlator form .",
    "indeed , as we show below the gogolin correlator with energy dependent localization parameter integrated over the energy is a better fit for the data .",
    "actualy , the best way is to fit the data by theoretical predictions following from the brm model itself , rather than to use gogolin s formula derived formally for diferent case .",
    "unfortunately , the relevant quantity was not calculated up to now .",
    "in particular , in @xcite the correlator @xmath15 has been calculated at points @xmath16 , @xmath17 ( @xmath18 is matrix size ) , while to compare with data@xcite one needs such a correlator for finite separations @xmath19 but infinite matrix size @xmath20 .",
    "this work is intended to fill this gap .",
    "we calculate the density - density correlator for infinite banded random matrices of two symmetry classes : the _ orthogonal _ ensemble , studied in @xcite , and the _ unitary _ one , consisting of complex hermitian banded matrices .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : after a brief overview of mapping of the brm model onto the supersymmetrical @xmath21-model in sec.[brmdef ] , we consider step by step the transfer matrix solution of the @xmath21-model in sec.[trmatrix ] and calculate the _ fixed energy _ correlator in sec.[brmcorre ] for both symmetry cases simultaneously . as a result",
    ", we find that within an accuracy of @xmath22 both correlators coincide in their functional form . at the same time",
    ", the localization length is as expected twice as smaller in the orthogonal ensemble as compared to the unitary one . integrating in sec.[brmcorrt ]",
    "the `` fixed energy '' correlator over the energy we complete the paper with brm predictions for the time averaged correlator , the `` steady state distribution '' .",
    "let us consider the ensemble of @xmath23 ( @xmath24 ) banded random matrices @xmath25 , whose elements are independently distributed according to the gaussian law with zero mean value and variances @xmath26 the band profile function @xmath27 vanishes exponentially or faster outside the band @xmath28 , @xmath29 . in this case ,",
    "as it was known from @xcite predictions are insensitive to the particular band profile form .",
    "below we consider simultaneously two symmetry classes of matrices @xmath25 : the _ orthogonal _ ensemble of real symmeric matrices , and the _ unitary _ ensemble of hermitian ones .",
    "the former corresponds to systems which are time - reversal invariant , while the latter corresponds to broken invariance .",
    "one can get a solution of the brm problem by mapping it onto supersymmetric @xmath21-model studied in many detailes in earlier efetov s works@xcite .",
    "let us summarize the results@xcite of such a mapping for both symmetry classes .",
    "the corresponding @xmath21-model action reads : @xmath30 in terms of which the density - density correlator ( [ e : corre ] ) is expressed as : @xmath31\\ ; ( q^{11}_{bb,11}(n_1 )    q^{22}_{bb,11}(n_2)+c_\\times\\delta_{n_1,n_2}q^{12}_{bb,11}(n_1 )    q^{21}_{bb,11}(n_1 ) \\exp(-s\\{q\\}).\\ ] ] where the @xmath21-model supermatrix field @xmath32 satisfyes a constraint : @xmath33 . with use the efetov s notations the supermatrix @xmath32 consists of four supermatrix blocks @xmath34 where upper indices 1 and 2 correspond to the `` retarded '' and `` advanced '' components of the original rbm model .",
    "the bottom indices @xmath35 in eq.([e : corrqq ] ) denote boson - boson components inside the superblocks . for more detailed explanation see , e.g. reviews @xcite .",
    "the difference between the two symmetry classes is reduced to symmetry - specific definitions of the model parameters @xmath36 , originates from the number of cross - pairing of components @xmath37 . since this contribution gives rise at @xmath38 only , it is of main importance in inverse participation ratio ( ipr ) . ] as well as of the supermatrices @xmath39 and @xmath32 .",
    "in the _ orthogonal _ ensemble the @xmath40 supermatrices q belong to the coset space uosp(2,2/2,2)/ uosp(2/2)@xmath41uosp(2/2 ) .",
    "their explicit parametrization , including invariant measure @xmath42 $ ] can be found , e.g. in @xcite .",
    "the diagonal matrix @xmath39 is @xmath43 .",
    "the density of states @xmath44 obeys the semicircle law @xmath45 and the `` length scale '' parameter @xmath46 is @xcite @xmath47 where the band profile parameters are defined as @xmath48 the correlator parameters are @xmath49 and @xmath50 , correspondingly ..    in the _ unitary _ ensemble the @xmath51 supermatrices q belong to the coset space u(1,1/2)/u(1/1)@xmath41u(1/1 ) , and their explicit parametrization can be found , e.g. in @xcite . in this case",
    "the matrix @xmath39 is @xmath52 .",
    "the density of states @xmath44 as well as the parameter @xmath46 are given by @xcite : @xmath53 @xmath54 and differ from those in the orthogonal ensemble .",
    "it is easy to see , that in the unitary case the `` length scale '' @xmath46 ( at @xmath55 ) is twice as large and the correlator parameters are in this case : @xmath56 , @xmath57 .    at this level of consideration two",
    "symmetry classes differ mainly by the rescaling of the length scale @xmath46 and by explicit form of the supermatrices @xmath32 .    at the end of this section",
    "let us consider briefly the accuracy of the brm model mapping onto the supersymmetrical @xmath21-model .",
    "the only approximation done at this step is the integration over so - called `` massive '' modes performed by saddle - point method in gaussian approximation(for more details see , e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "while the separation between the saddle points is of order ( see , e.g. @xcite ) @xmath58 the variances of the massive modes are @xmath59 @xcite .",
    "hence , the ratio of the amplitude of the massive modes to the sadle points separation is of order of @xmath60 : @xmath61 which , probably , defines the accuracy of the approxiamtion . can occur",
    "then the accuracy will be better , of order of @xmath62 .",
    "more careful consideration is needed to arrive at definite conclusion . ] putting @xmath63 , one may also conclude , that semicircle law for the density of states is valid as long as @xmath64 .",
    "starting with the pioneer work@xcite , the transfer matrix technique looks as the most adequate tool to solve the problem .",
    "forthcoming works@xcite make some detailes be more transparent .",
    "the continuous limit version @xcite reduces the problem to solution of a partial differential equation .",
    "as we check below , this equation is the same for both the orthogonal and unitary ensemble , with accuracy @xmath65 .",
    "the corresponding boundary conditions are also the same when calculating the density - density correlator , but can be symmetry dependent in more general case . to demonstrate this",
    "let us outline basic steps of the approach .    following @xcite consider the n - site one - dimensional chain of matrices @xmath66 , with a nearest neighbour interaction given by eq.([e : sigma ] ) .",
    "for the sake of definiteness we assume that @xmath67 in eq.([e : corrqq ] ) .",
    "having in mind that the integrations over different @xmath68 , @xmath69 in eq.([e : corrqq ] ) can be performed subsequently one after another with the _ same _ kernel @xmath70 it is very convenient to consider the quantity @xmath71 satisfying the recurrence relation @xmath72 with the initial condition @xmath73 .",
    "in general , the integration over @xmath32 is quite nontrivial .",
    "a great simplification occurs in the limit @xmath74 , which is exactly the case we are interested in ( see the eq.([e : corrqq ] ) ) .",
    "as it was clearly demonstrated in@xcite with efetov parametrization of matrices @xmath32 , after taking such a limit the function @xmath75 depends only on one of its bosonic `` eigenvalues '' ( say , @xmath76 ) of the superblock @xmath77 , which takes values @xmath78 .",
    "although the kernel ( [ e : l_qq ] ) has a very extensive grassmannian part , in the limit @xmath74 only the term of the maximal grassmanian order survives due to the parisi - sourlas - efetov - wegner ( psew ) theorem . this is the term of the eighth or fourth order in the orthogonal and unitary case , respectively .",
    "perfoming explicit integration over all variables but @xmath76 and using , that @xmath75 depends only on @xmath79 , one can rewrite the recurrence relation ( [ e : lyqq ] ) in a more simple form : @xmath80 the explicit form of the kernel @xmath81 can be found , e.g. in @xcite and @xcite for the orthogonal and unitary case , respectively .",
    "this recurrence relation can be used iteratively to construct the function @xmath82 up to the point @xmath83 . at this point the integrand in eq.([e : corrqq ] ) has an extra factor @xmath84 .",
    "this factor already depends on the whole set of the ordinary parameters of matrix @xmath32 and on a half subset of grassmann variables ( the two @xmath85 in the unitary case , and the four @xmath86 in the orthogonal case , in notations of papers@xcite ) . , with replacing @xmath87 , arises at @xmath88 . ] omitting the detailes ( some of them can be found in @xcite ) we have found that in the limit @xmath74 the only nonvanishing contribution to the density - density correlator coming from the factor @xmath84 is the term of the maximal order in grassmann variables .",
    "it is of the kind @xmath89 , with @xmath90 and the ordinary coefficient @xmath91 , which ( after averaging over the angle variables in the orthogonal case ) is the same for both symmetry classes : @xmath92 .    to proceed further ,",
    "beginning from the point @xmath93 we start iterations with a new function @xmath94 satisfying initial condition @xmath95 .",
    "the subscript @xmath96 denotes here , that this new function aquires a _ nontrivial grassmann part_. as a result , one could suspect that the recurrence relation ( [ e : lyz ] ) is not valid any longer and one should return to the more complex relation ( [ e : lyqq ] ) .",
    "fortunately , the closer inspection shows that to the leading order in @xmath74 the recurrence relation ( [ e : lyqq ] ) acts on functions @xmath97 in such a way as if the grassmannian factor remains unchanged , while its _ ordinary _ coefficient @xmath98 is iterated by the relation ( [ e : lyz ] ) with _ the same _ kernel , as before .    the functions @xmath99 and @xmath100 allow one to calculate the correlator ( [ e : corrqq ] ) .",
    "let us first consider the `` direct pairing '' contribution to eq.([e : corrqq ] ) coming from the term @xmath101 : @xmath102 where the only explicit integration over @xmath32 left is that done at the site @xmath88 .",
    "using the psew theorem , performing all the integrations this gives a factor 2 for the both symmetry cases.]except for that over @xmath103 , and finally taking the limit @xmath74 we come to the expression @xmath104 note , that this expression is the same for both symmetry classes , but the functions @xmath105 and @xmath106 are calculated with kernels @xmath107 , which , generally speaking , are _ dependent _ on the symmetry class .",
    "another contribution to the correlator ( [ e : corrqq])comes from the cross - pairing term @xmath108 .",
    "it is even more easy to calculate .",
    "one can verify , that at the point @xmath109 the term @xmath110 to the leading order in @xmath111 .",
    "therefore the full correlator can be written as @xmath112    the final simplification arises if one considers the bandwidth @xmath1 of the matrices to be large enough , so that the parameter @xmath113 . let us note , that this condition was actually used in the previous section in order to map the original brm problem onto the sypersymmetrical @xmath21-model ( see discussion in @xcite ) .",
    "first of all , the kernels @xmath114 obtained in @xcite for the orthogonal case as well as that for the unitary case @xcite coincide with each other within the accuracy @xmath65",
    ". then one can pass to the continuous limit by using that the kernel has a sharp peak .",
    "it amounts to replace the integral recurrence equation by the differential one@xcite : @xmath115 where we introduced a continuous variable @xmath116 , a scaled variable @xmath117 , and the functions @xmath118 satisfying the initial conditions @xmath119 let us stress , that the differential equation ( [ e : diff ] ) as well as the initial conditions ( [ e : wwin ] ) are exactly the same for both symmetry classes .",
    "the correlator ( [ e : corrqq1122 ] ) in continuous limit takes a form @xmath120 where we introduced the dimensionless matrix size as @xmath121 .",
    "the way to obtain a solution of eq.([e : ww ] ) was in details considered in @xcite . for the function @xmath122 one",
    "has @xmath123 where @xmath124 is the macdonald function . in this work",
    "we consider the case of the band matrices of the infinite size : @xmath125 .",
    "in contrast to @xcite the correlator arguments @xmath126 are taken at the finite separation @xmath127 , but both far from the ends @xmath128 , @xmath121 . in this limit we have @xmath129 since both @xmath130 , and @xmath131 . constructing the function @xmath132 with the initial condition ( [ e : wwin ] ) : @xmath133 we find @xmath134 substituting the functions @xmath135 and @xmath136 into the correlator expression ( [ e : corrw ] ) one finally arrives at @xmath137 ^2   \\nonumber \\\\ & = & \\frac{\\pi ^2}{16\\cdot 2\\gamma } .\\int\\limits_0^\\infty",

    "we see also , that in the infinite matrix size limit the correlator depends on the difference @xmath142 only which means the restoration of the translational symmetry .",
    "it is interesting , that the brm model prediction for the _ functional form _ of the correlator @xmath143 coinsides exactly with that obtained many years ago by gogolin @xcite for the strictly 1d electron system in disordered potential .",
    "however , the spatial scales in these systems are quite different .",
    "namely , in the _ strictly _ 1d electron system it is equal to the mean free path defined by the born amplitude of electron - impurity scattering , while in the _",
    "quasi_-1d brm model it is governed by the localisation length @xmath144 , growing quadratically with matrix bandwidth .",
    "as we have already mentioned in the introduction , the _ time - averaged _",
    "correlator @xmath145 can be obtained from the `` fixed energy '' correlator @xmath15 by integrating the latter over the energy : @xmath146 substituting eq.([e : corr2 ] ) into eq.([e : qerel ] ) we get @xmath147 with energy dependent localization length @xmath148 .",
    "the scaled variables @xmath149 are related here to the discrete ones @xmath7 via the energy independent scale factor @xmath150 : @xmath151 .    for large @xmath152",
    "the density of states @xmath153 in rbm model obeys the semicircle law : @xmath154 and the localization length is , correspondingly , @xmath155 with @xmath156 or @xmath157 for the orthogonal or unitary cases , respectively ( see eqs.([e : dos_goe])-([e : gammague ] ) ) .",
    "let us make a remark about the limits of the integration .",
    "according to the note at the end of sec.[brmdef ] , both the semicircle law for the density of states and the solution itself are valid as long as @xmath158 .",
    "thus , extending the integration in the eq.([e : k_t ] ) over the whole region @xmath159 $ ] we get an uncertainty coming from the regions @xmath160 , where our integrand differs substantially from the exact one . to estimate an order of magnitude of this uncertainty ,",
    "let us consider the contribution coming from this regions with _ our _ integrand .",
    "in the `` worst '' case of the coinciding correlator arguments @xmath161 the integrand has integrable _ square root _",
    "singularities at the ends @xmath162 , and their contribution has a relative order of magnitude @xmath163 . in the case of nonzero",
    "@xmath142 the contribution of of the regions @xmath160 is exponentially small at @xmath164 . in particular , we conclude that in the recent numerical brm simulations@xcite done for the matrix bandwidth @xmath165 substantial deviations order of @xmath166 can occur for the correlator at @xmath167 .    the integration in eq.([e : k_t ] )",
    "can hardly be performed analytically .",
    "let us therefore consider two simple limiting cases first .",
    "it can be most easily done for the correlator value at @xmath168 : @xmath169 which is a `` time - averaged '' version of the so - called inverse participation ratio ( ipr ) @xmath170 .",
    "note , that _ in the brm model _",
    "`` time - averaged '' ipr is twice as large as compared to its  fixed energy ",

    ", most considerably in the region @xmath178 .    in the recent numerical work",
    "@xcite the data for the correlator @xmath179 have been obtained in the course of a direct numerical simulation of the brm orthogonal ensemble .",
    "with use of the gogolin formula@xcite the best fit value for the localisation length was found @xmath180 . in fig.1",
    "we plot the correlator @xmath179 predicted by eq.([e : k_t ] ) which has _ no free parameters _ and corresponds to @xmath181 .",
    ", as defined in ref.@xcite ] the dashed line presents the parametrization of the data by the gogolin formula with @xmath182 . to illustrate an accuracy of the agreement , we plot also the gogolin formula with @xmath183 .",
    "we see , that the agreement looks reasonable . for more reliable analysis one needs to compare the correlator @xmath179 directly with the data for brm ensembles with the matrix bandwith @xmath29",
    ".    however , the most crucial test of our theory would be the comparison of the correlator behavior at @xmath184 with numerical data ( see , fig.2 ) .",
    "we expect it to be essentially more peaked at @xmath128 than the `` fixed energy '' correlator @xmath143 given by the gogolin formula with @xmath185",
    ". apart from this fact , it would also be interesting to compare the _ time - averaged _ ipr with data , which is predicted to be twice as large in comparison with the corresponding `` fixed energy '' quantity .",
    "in this work we have studied the density - density correlators in the brm ensembles for the orthogonal and unitary symmetry cases . in contrast to the works@xcite we consider the case of infinite matrix size @xmath186 , with correlator arguments @xmath187 taken well inside the argument region : @xmath188 $ ] , far from the ends : @xmath189 , @xmath190 ( @xmath1 is matrix bandwidth ) .",
    "we have found , that the `` fixed energy '' density - density correlator ( [ e : corre ] ) turns out to be the same in both the orthogonal and unitary brm ensembles , within the accuracy @xmath191 .",
