    "the lat instrument onboard the fermi satellite has detected a high - energy emission at 100 mev100 gev , extending well after the gbm prompt phase , for dozens of grb afterglows ( first fermi catalog ",
    "ackermann et al 2013 ) .",
    "the properties of the lat afterglow emission are : fluence above 100 mev @xmath1 , light - curve peak at 1020 s after trigger , post - peak flux decay @xmath2 monitored up to 1 ks ( sometimes longer ) , photon spectrum @xmath3 .",
    "the isotropic energetic output of the brightest lat afterglows , @xmath4 erg , is 10100 percent of the grb output at @xmath5 mev , the corresponding number of afterglow photons above @xmath6 mev being @xmath7 .",
    "the fraction @xmath8 of these photons that form pairs depends strongly on the lorentz factor @xmath9 of the medium that produced the lat afterglow emission , because @xmath9 determines the lab - frame collimation of photons and the threshold energy for pair - formation , and on the source radius @xmath10 , which sets the optical - thickness to photon - photon absorption .",
    "taking into account that @xmath11 , with @xmath12 the observer time , it follows that @xmath8 has a very strong dependence on @xmath9 .    from the escape of the higher - energy lat photons ( @xmath13 gev ) ,",
    "abdo et al ( 2009 ) have set lower limits @xmath14 for the lorentz factor of several lat sources during the prompt emission phase ( burst ) .",
    "consistent with that , panaitescu et al ( 2014 ) found that , for @xmath15 , photon - photon attenuation does not yield a spectral signature but , for @xmath16 , the attenuation of photons above 1 gev should be detectable . additionally , as shown in this article , for @xmath17 ,",
    "the number of pairs @xmath18 is higher than the number of electrons energized by the forward shock and , for @xmath19 , is larger than the number of ejecta electrons energized by the reverse shock .",
    "therefore , the formation of pairs from lat photons is of importance at least for those grbs / afterglows whose lat spectrum displays a spectral softening at gev energies .    assuming a single power - law for the lat spectral component , panaitescu & vestrand ( 2014 ) have calculated _ analytically _ the emission from the pairs formed only from photons to which the gev front is optically - thick , leading to the conclusion that pairs can account for the brightest optical counterparts ( flashes ) observed during the prompt phase",
    ". a larger number of pairs , but of lower energy , are formed by the photons for which the lat emission is optically - thin ( to pair - formation ) . in this work ,",
    "we calculate _ numerically _ the distribution with energy of all pairs formed from high - energy photons ( assuming a broken power - law spectrum ) , integrate it over the deceleration of the blast - wave that produces the lat afterglow , and track numerically the pair radiative cooling , to obtain accurate light - curves for the optical flashes produced by pairs formed in grbs and afterglows .",
    "the effects arising from scattering of the high - energy photons on ( cold ) electrons existing in the source or on the already - formed pairs are ignored .",
    "such scattering increases the source - frame photon escape path , which increases the probability that any photon forms a pair and the total number of pairs formed .",
    "as we shall see , for sources that are optically - thin to photon scattering , scattering on the already - formed pairs occurs with a smaller probability than pair - formation thus , to a good approximation , the effect of photon scattering on the pair - formation rate can be ignored .",
    "the same is true for scattering on the ejecta electrons , if the lorentz factor of the gev source is in the few hundreds .",
    "however , if that lorentz factor is or exceeds several hundreds , scattering on ejecta electrons should occur with a higher probability than pair - formation . in this case",
    ", the number of pairs formed from unscattered seed photons , calculated below , underestimates the true number of pairs .",
    "we also ignore the formation of ( external ) pairs ahead of the afterglow blast - wave , which loads with leptons the ambient medium and accelerates it ( beloborodov 2002 ) , changing the afterglow dynamics ( kumar & panaitescu 2004 ) .",
    "consequently , the formalism presented here for the emission from pairs is more pertaining to a gev source that is located well behind the forward - shock , so that most pairs form in the shocked fluid and not ahead of the blast - wave .",
    "that condition points to a relativistic reverse - shock as the origin of the lat afterglow emission ( as could be the case for grb 130427a - panaitescu et al 2013 ) .",
    "the number of pairs formed at any observer - frame time @xmath12 over a dynamical timescale is derived from the observable 0.110 gev fluence @xmath20 , the spectrum of the high - energy afterglow emission ( with the 0.1 - 10 gev spectral slope being the only observational constraint ) , the source redshift @xmath21 , and the unknown lorentz factor @xmath9 of the high - energy source . at the redshift of the afterglow source",
    ", the afterglow photon spectrum is assumed to be a broken power - law : @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the spectral - break energy at redshift @xmath21 ( i.e. the peak of the luminosity @xmath24 spectrum ) , @xmath25 and @xmath26 being the low and high - energy spectral slopes . for synchrotron and inverse - compton emissions , @xmath25 has four possible values : 2/3 for optically - thin synchrotron ( sy ) or inverse - compton ( ic ) emission from un - cooled electrons , 3/2 for optically - thin sy / ic from cooled electrons ( i.e. with a radiative cooling timescale shorter than the age of the source ) , -1 for self - absorbed synchrotron emission ( but is unlikely that the source magnetic field is sufficiently high for self - absorption to be important at mev ) , and 0 for the inverse - compton scattering of self - absorbed synchrotron emission .",
    "then , the spectral slope around 2 measured by lat above 100 mev indicates that @xmath27 mev ( in the observer frame ) , @xmath28 , and that the low - energy spectrum is not observed , being dimmer at 10 kev10 mev than the grb spectrum .",
    "the normalization factor of equation ( [ dng ] ) is simply set by the measured fluence @xmath20 @xmath29 @xmath30 where @xmath31 cm is the luminosity distance and @xmath32\\ ] ]      a lower limit on the observer - frame break - energy @xmath33 can be set by requiring that the 0.110 kev afterglow emission measured during the x - ray light - curve plateau ( at 0.3 - 10 ks ) by swift / xrt , of about @xmath34 ( obrien et al 2006 ) , is not dimmer than the extrapolation @xmath35 of the gev afterglow spectrum , for an afterglow of gev fluence @xmath36 at @xmath37 s , decreasing as @xmath38 , and with a high - energy slope @xmath39 : @xmath40 for @xmath41 , the high - energy spectral component does not overshine the x - ray plateau flux if @xmath42 kev . for @xmath43 ,",
    "the high - energy spectral component is dimmer than the x - ray plateau if @xmath44 mev , but could be the x - ray plateau if @xmath45 mev .",
    "this evolution is consistent with the @xmath46 expected for the peak energy of the forward - shock synchrotron spectrum , but implies that @xmath47 gev during the burst , which is inconsistent with lat observations , that do not show a high - energy component peaking in the lat window .",
    "however , x - ray plateau measurements are often lacking during the early gev afterglows monitored by lat , thus the above low limits on @xmath33 can not be derived for individual afterglows .",
    "the sub - mev burst light - curve may also set a constraint on the unknown @xmath33 in the following way .",
    "for @xmath48 mev and @xmath49 , the lat spectral component yields a 100 kev flux @xmath50 during a @xmath51 s burst ( using the notation @xmath52 and measuring photon energies in ev ) .",
    "this emission is sufficiently below the typical flux of a bright burst , @xmath53 , that it does not overshine a fast - decaying @xmath54 tail ( obrien et al 2006 ) .",
    "in contrast , an energy - break @xmath33 that falls below 100 kev will produce a burst emission @xmath55 ( independent of @xmath33 , for a high - energy lat spectral slope @xmath28 ) that rivals that of the prompt emission .",

    "the brightness of the lat high - energy spectral component at sub - mev photon energies relative to that of the burst is the criterion for choosing the two prescriptions given in figure 5 for the unknown break - energy : grbs with a fast - decaying tail require that the @xmath33 of a bright lat component remains above mev for the duration of the tail , while bursts with a slowly - decaying tail allow lower @xmath33 ( decreasing or not ) .",

    "the decay of the pair synchrotron optical light - curve depends primarily on the lat light - curve @xmath442 and on the blast - wave deceleration @xmath443 .",

    "therefore , fits to the decay of the prompt optical emission of grb 130427a with emission from internal - pairs sets constraints on the unmeasured peak energy @xmath33 of the lat spectral component that do not elucidate its shock origin .",
    "furthermore , numerical fits to the multiwavelength emission of this afterglow show comparable contributions to the lat emission arising from both synchrotron reverse and forward shocks ( panaitescu et al 2013 ) .    figure 6 also shows that the x - ray emission from pairs and that lat component contribution to the x - ray are below the fluxes measured by swift , and that the formation of enough pairs to produce a bright optical flash does not entail a high attenuation of the lat spectrum above 10 gev .",
    "for the highest lorentz factor @xmath424 that allows a good fit to the optical flash , the intrinsic power - law spectrum above 10 gev is attenuated by up to 50 percent at @xmath37 s ( when attenuation is maximal ) , which is not inconsistent with the detection by lat of a 70 gev photon at 18 s. however , lorentz factors @xmath449 are incompatible with that detection .",
    "although a good fit with the internal - pair emission for the optical flash of grb 130427a is obtained , we do not propose this origin for the optical counterpart of grb 130427a because modeling of the broadband ( radio , optical , x - ray , and gev ) emission of this afterglow ( panaitescu , vestrand & wozniak 2013 ) , from 100 s to tens of days , has shown that its wind - like ambient medium must be very tenuous , which leads to an initial lorentz factor @xmath450 that is much higher than allowed by fitting the optical flash with internal - pairs emission ( @xmath451 ) .    synchrotron emission from _ external _ pairs formed ahead of the blast - wave from _ burst mev _",

    "vurm , hascoet & beloborodov ( 2014 ) have found that the optical flash of grb 130427a can be explained with synchrotron emission from external pairs accelerated by the forward - shock if that shock s lorentz factor is a low @xmath453 .",
