    "the low - energy physics of correlated one - dimensional ( 1d ) problems has some universal properties described by the tomonaga - luttinger liquid ( tll ) @xcite . in turn , a pseudofermion dynamical theory ( pdt ) beyond the tll @xcite was recently used to study the finite - energy singular features in photoemission of the organic compound tetrathiafulvalene - tetracyanoquinodimethane ( ttf - tcnq ) metallic phase @xcite .",
    "while the pdt was originally introduced for the 1d hubbard model , more recently other methods for the study of finite - energy spectral and dynamical functions of 1d correlated systems were introduced @xcite . both the finite - energy spectral - weight distributions studied by the pdt for the 1d hubbard model and the methods of refs .",
    "@xcite for other 1d correlated problems include power - law singularities near well - defined branch lines with exponents depending on the interaction strength and the excitation momentum . in the limit of low energy",
    "the pdt correlation- and spectral - function expressions recover the usual low - energy tll results @xcite    besides a renewed interest in the unusual spectral and dynamical properties of quasi-1d organic compounds @xcite , recently there has been an increasing interest in those of interacting ultracold fermionic atoms in 1d optical lattices @xcite .",
    "quantum effects are strongest at low dimensionality leading to unusual phenomena such as charge - spin separation at all energies @xcite .",
    "thus , the further understanding of the microscopic mechanisms behind the unusual spectral properties observed in low - dimensional correlated systems and materials is a topic of high scientific interest .",
    "the 1d hubbard model is one of the few realistic models for correlated electrons in a discrete lattice for which one can exactly calculate all the energy eigenstates and their energies @xcite .",
    "it includes a first - neighbor transfer - integral @xmath2 , for electron hopping along the chain , and an effective on - site coulomb repulsion @xmath3 . for finite - energy values the metallic phase of this model goes beyond the low energy behavior described by the usual tll @xcite and",
    "thus the study of spectral functions is a very involved many - electron problem .",
    "fortunately , the construction of a pseudofermion description by means of a unitary transformation which slightly shifts the discrete momentum values of the corresponding pseudoparticles of refs .",
    "@xcite leads to the pdt , whose energy spectrum has no residual - interaction energy terms .",
    "therefore , such a description is suitable for the derivation of explicit expressions for these functions @xcite .",
    "the pdt is a generalization for finite values of @xmath3 of the scheme introduced in refs .",
    "@xcite for large @xmath3 values .",
    "it profits from the use of a description of the exact energy eigenstates in terms of occupancy configurations of several branches of pseudofermions .",
    "the ground state has finite occupancy of charge @xmath4 and spin @xmath5 pseudofermions only . under the ground - state - excited - energy - eigenstate transitions ,",
    "the pseudofermions and pseudofermion holes undergo elementary scattering events with the pseudofermions and pseudofermion holes created in these transitions .",
    "this leads to excited - state , interaction , density , and two - momenta dependent two - pseudofermion phase shifts .",
    "the point is that the one- and two - electron spectral functions can be expressed in terms of pseudofermion determinants which are a functional of such phase shifts .",
    "use of the pdt reveals that for finite values of @xmath6 all singular one - electron spectral features of the model are of power - low type , controlled by negative exponents .",
    "furthermore , the pdt line shapes associated with such exponents were found to correspond to the unusual charge and spin spectral features observed by photoemission experiments for the whole finite - energy band width in quasi-1d organic metals @xcite .",
    "( the use of the dynamical density matrix renormalization group method @xcite leads to results consistent with those obtained by the pdt . ) furthermore , when combined with the renormalization group , the use of the pdt reveals that a system of weakly coupled hubbard chains is suitable for the successful description of the phase diagram observed in quasi-1d doped mott - hubbard insulators @xcite .",
    "the low - energy physics of the model corresponds to the universal tll behaviour and was studied by different techniques , such as conformal - field theory @xcite and bosonization @xcite .",
    "there are many investigations where the low - energy conformal invariance was combined with the model exact bethe - ansatz solution in the study of the asymptotics of correlation functions and related quantities @xcite . as mentioned above , the studies of ref .",
    "@xcite confirm that in the limit of low energy the general finite - energy spectral and correlation function expressions provided by the pdt in ref .",

    "the main goal of this paper is to provide the details of an extension of the pdt introduced in refs .",
    "@xcite to initial ground states with spin density @xmath1 which was used in recent theoretical studies of the finite - energy singular features in photoemission of the ttf - tcnq metallic phase @xcite .",
    "the point is that such an extension involves spectral contributions that do not occur for finite values of the spin density and hence are not taken into account by the expressions of refs .",

    "the unusual spectral properties are mainly determined by the occupancy configurations in the excited states of the two pseudofermion branches that have finite occupancies for the ground state .",
