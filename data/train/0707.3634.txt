    "similarly , it is unknown whether individual regions of star formation within a given galaxy follow a global abundance pattern or exhibit strong variations in chemical enrichment .",

    "we divide the exposures into two sets taken at positions a and b , and use drp routines to median combine each set to produce a sky frame .",

    "this drp extraction algorithm is complicated and non - intuitive since spectra from individual spaxels physically overlap on the detector ; we refer the reader to the osiris user manual for further information . due to the highly time - variable nature of the ir background",
    "the residual flux pedestal in these sky - subtracted data cubes is often unsatisfactorily high and we therefore perform a second - pass background subtraction on each of these cubes as follows . using custom idl routines we calculate the median pixel value in each spectral channel and subtract this value from all pixels within the channel to ensure a zero - flux median in all spectral slices throughout the data cube .",
    "this effectively removes flux pedestals resulting from variable sky brightness , although small variations in the background persist across the spatial dimensions of each cube . as osiris data reduction algorithms",
    "are progressively refined it may prove possible to further suppress background fluctuations , achieving effectively deeper integrations .",
    "these sky - subtracted data cubes are spatially registered using the telescope steering system ( tss ) offset coordinates contained within the image headers and combined using a 3@xmath30 clipped mean algorithm . the resulting cube is spatially oversampled by a factor of two in each dimension ( i.e. mapped to pixels 25 mas in size ) , rotated with flux - conserving resampling to a standard ( north up , east left ) orientation , and the image slice at each spectral channel convolved with a spatial gaussian kernel of fwhm 3.2 oversampled pixels ( 80 mas , giving an effective psf fwhm of 110/150 mas for june / october data respectively ) in order to increase the s / n ratio of each spectrum .",

    "since we do not dedicate time in each observing sequence to obtaining a clean `` sky '' observation , negative residuals of the target galaxy are located about 1.4  above and below the positive image in the final stacked data cube , effectively halving our useful field of view . however , given the small size of the target galaxies ( uv morphologies indicate that @xmath9 90% are less than 1  in extent ; law et al .",
    "2007 ) we find this approach preferable for maximization of on - source integration time by eliminating the need to frequently nod off - target in order to adequately characterize the background flux ( although c.f . discussion by davies 2007 ) .",
    "we produce maps of the ionized gas morphology of the three target galaxies by collapsing each data cube about the 4 - 5 spectral channels corresponding to the peak emission wavelength of the spectral line ( h@xmath12 for q1623-bx453 and q0449-bx93 , [ oiii ] for dsf2237a - c2 ) . as illustrated in figure [ resultsfig.fig ] ( top left panel )",
    ", q1623-bx453 consists of an h@xmath12 bright nucleation with a lower surface brightness region extending towards the southwest and an extremely faint feature on the western edge .",
    "this faint feature is only barely detected and may be an artifact of imperfect sky subtraction . while fairly centrally concentrated , the bright emission region is inconsistent with a point source , having a diameter of 200 mas ( 1.7 kpc ) at the half peak - flux contour compared to ( an upper limit of ) 110 mas for the psf of the tip - tilt reference star .",
    "q0449-bx93 ( fig .",

    "given the elongated morphology of dsf2237a - c2 , one traditional assumption would be that emission in this galaxy is predominantly from an inclined disk of ionized gas , and that the apparent ellipticity is due to perspective foreshortening of a circularly symmetric disk .",
    "under such an assumption , we fit a 2d gaussian to the h@xmath12 surface brightness map and conclude that with a major / minor axis ratio of @xmath32 , such a disk has a position angle of @xmath33 east of north and an inclination of @xmath34 away from the normal .",
    "while it is tempting to draw such physical inferences from the ionized - gas morphologies , these inferences are not necessarily robust given the irregularity of typical star - forming galaxies at redshift @xmath3 , which typically consist of 1 - 3 nucleations connected by regions of low surface - brightness emission ( as viewed in the rest - frame uv ; see fig .",

    "we quantify an average linear dimension of the nebular line emission region by adopting a segmentation map which includes all spaxels ( i.e. lenslets ) for which nebular emission can be fit with a gaussian profile with s / n ratio ( snr ) @xmath9 6 , and which have a velocity of less than 300 km s@xmath6 relative to systemic ( see  6 for further explanation of these selection criteria ) . the effective size of this region is determined as follows . assuming that the @xmath35 elements in the segmentation map are distributed in an approximately circular arrangement , the radius of this circle is given simply by @xmath36 .",

    "the greatest uncertainty in flux calibration arises however in the additional requirement that we correct for the unknown amount of flux lost to the seeing halo of the ao - corrected psf . for a point source with a 35% strehl correction approximately 35% of the total light",
    "is contained within the diffraction - limited core of fwhm @xmath43 mas while the remaining 65% is spread throughout a seeing - limited halo .",
    "the percentage of total flux measured for a given observation is therefore a complex function of the strehl of the ao correction ( which depends in turn upon the magnitude / separation of the tt star and the wavelength of observation ) , the quality of the seeing , and the physical structure of the source .",

    "[ resultsfig.fig ] , center and right panels respectively ) are intrinsically noisy ; we reduce the contribution of noisy spaxels to the resulting maps by considering only those for which the derived velocity is within 300 km s@xmath6 of the systemic redshift , the fwhm is greater than or equal to the instrumental width , and the snr of the detection is greater than six .",
    "these criteria are not derived from theoretical limits , but rather represent empirical constraints which we have found ( based on iterations with various parameters ) to produce the cleanest kinematic maps .",
    "these velocity maps are generally robust to systematic uncertainties ( since all spaxels are processed in a similar manner ) and the largest source of uncertainty is from random errors arising from the difficulty in determining the accurate centroid for an emission line of given s / n ratio . given the osiris spectral resolution @xmath20 , the velocity fwhm is about 80 km s@xmath6 .",
    "we estimate that uncertainties in the velocity maps are @xmath9 10 km s@xmath6 for bright central regions of a galaxy , tapering to @xmath196 km s@xmath6 towards the edges .      the 2d velocity map of q1623-bx453 ( fig .",
    "[ resultsfig.fig ] , top middle panel ) is largely consistent with a flat velocity field across the entire galaxy ( @xmath9 4 kpc along the major axis ) and does not present any evidence for spatially resolved shear .",
    "typical deviations from zero relative velocity are within the uncertainty of our ability to accurately measure velocity centroids from individual spaxels ( i.e. about 10 - 20 km s@xmath6 ) .",
    "the only suggestion of kinematic substructure is a small @xmath9 100 mas ( 800 pc ) feature at the northeastern edge of the galaxy which appears to be receding at @xmath9 50 km s@xmath6 relative to systemic and has a sharp discontinuity with the bulk velocity field ( i.e. it does not appear to `` blend in '' by means of a gradual velocity transition ) . given the extremely low flux of this feature ( which lies outside the faintest flux contour illustrated on fig .",
    "[ resultsfig.fig ] ) this may be simply a residual noise artifact .    although the line - of - sight velocity of the ionized gas is roughly constant across the face of the galaxy , the dispersion of this gas ( @xmath30 ) varies slightly with position ( fig .",
    "[ resultsfig.fig ] ; top right panel ) .",
    "in particular , @xmath30 peaks around 100 km s@xmath6 in the northeastern region approximately coincident with the flux peak , decreases to @xmath9 70 km s@xmath6 in the southwestern region , and drops to below 30 km s@xmath6 in the extremely faint emission region to the west . while there appear to be peaks of @xmath197 km s@xmath6 on the northern and eastern edges of the galaxy , it is uncertain whether these represent real features or are simply noise in the extremely faint surface brightness edges of the galaxy .",
    "the flat velocity field of this galaxy is particularly intriguing in light of the semi - analytic picture of galaxy formation in the early universe ( e.g. mo , mau , & white 1998 , baugh 2006 ) in which ( in brief ) cold gas falls into collapsed dark halos , shock heats , radiatively cools to form a disk supported by residual angular momentum , and proceeds to form stars within this gaseous disk . unless q1623-bx453 happens to be inclined",
    "almost perfectly face - on to our line - of - sight circular velocity within a 20 km s@xmath6 uncertainty a galaxy must have inclination @xmath198 .",
    "this occurs in less than 2% of cases for a randomly distributed set of inclinations . ]",
    ", the absence of a velocity gradient across the galaxy indicates that the kinematics of the ionized gas are not dominated by ordered rotation .",
    "clearly , the simplest description of galaxy formation is incomplete .",
    "one variant on the basic rotating disk model which provides a reasonable explanation of some of the observed characteristics is that described by noguchi et al .",
    "( 1999 ) and immeli et al .",
    "( 2004 ; their models a / b ) , in which highly - efficient cooling mechanisms lead to early fragmentation of the gas disk into self - gravitating clouds .",
    "these clouds are sufficiently massive that they spiral to the center of the galaxy via dynamical friction within a few dynamical times , largely dragging the existing stellar population along with the gas .",
    "immeli et al . (",
    "2004 ) find that an intense burst of star formation typically occurs in the nuclear region of the galaxy when these massive gas clouds collide , typically peaking at around 100 @xmath52 yr@xmath6 ( over twice that expected for `` traditional '' star formation histories in galaxies with less efficient gas cooling mechanisms ) and leading to the rapid formation of a stellar bulge .",
    "such a theory may provide a natural explanation for q1623-bx453 , which we infer to have a large cold gas fraction , near - peak star formation rate density , and a sizeable stellar population .",
    "alternatively , such characteristics may also be explained by the merger of two massive , gas - rich galaxies whose cold gas reservoirs are undergoing rapid star formation in the center of the new gravitational potential .    while it might appear surprising that a system with such violent dynamics should show so little evidence for kinematic structure , such systems are well - known in the local universe .",
    "local ulirgs may often have gas masses constituting the bulk of their dynamical mass ( solomon et al .",
    "1997 ) , fueling intense starbursts from the dense molecular gas in their cores .",
    "the common presence of multiple nuclei and tidal features ( e.g. sanders et al .",
    "1988 , bushouse et al .",
    "2002 ) suggests that these starbursts may commonly arise from the major merger of two gas - rich systems , and the ionized gas kinematics typically show star formation in gas flows rapidly forming stars in the center of the gravitational potential .",
    "the velocity fields of ulirgs are typically dominated by strong , asymmetric gas flows ( colina et al . 2005 ) , although the specific properties of these flows vary considerably from case to case .",
    "the velocity structure of q1623-bx453 resembles in particular the kinematics of mrk 273 and iras 15250 + 3609 ( see fig . 1 of colina et al . 2005 ) ; these galaxies show no strong kinematic substructure in the brightest regions of h@xmath12 emission within @xmath199 kpc of the peak h@xmath12 emission despite relatively strong ( @xmath200 km s@xmath6 ) kinematic features in regions with h@xmath12 surface brightness lower by a factor @xmath9 5 . it is an interesting speculation therefore whether deeper observations of q1623-bx453 will reveal similar kinematic structure in regions of lower surface brightness .      while the integrated spectrum of q0449-bx93 ( fig .",
    "[ spectra.fig ] ) is dominated by a single emission spike defining the systemic redshift , the spectrum of the northwestern region of the galaxy shows a faint secondary emission peak blueshifted by @xmath8 km s@xmath6 from the systemic redshift ( fig .",
    "[ bx93_bluebump.fig ] ) . given that the fwhm of the primary emission component is @xmath201 km s@xmath6 , these two components in figure [ bx93_bluebump.fig ] are blended , motivating the use of a 2-component gaussian model in order to adequately characterize the emission line profile of the source .",
    "considering first the primary spectroscopic component , the velocity and dispersion structure of q0449-bx93 ( fig .",
    "[ resultsfig.fig ] , center and middle - right panels respectively ) are similar to those of q1623-bx453 although there is mild evidence for velocity shear along the northwest - southeast axis .",
    "the peak - to - peak amplitude of this velocity differential is only @xmath202 km s@xmath6 , and therefore not highly significant with respect to our estimated velocity uncertainty of 10 - 20 km s@xmath6 .",
    "even if this shear is genuine , it is not obvious that this implies a rotationally supported system .",
    "assuming a simplistic model in which the circular velocity at the outer edge of the galaxy ( 1.23 kpc ; see table [ osirismorphs.table ] ) is 40 km s@xmath6 ( i.e. with an extremely generous inclination correction to the observed 20 km s@xmath6 ) , we obtain a dynamical mass of only @xmath203 , far less than the gas mass alone within the same region as derived from the h@xmath12 emission flux .",
    "that is , the observed shear is insufficient to provide dynamical support for the galaxy . as in the case of q1623-bx453 ,",
    "the velocity dispersion is considerably larger ( @xmath204 km s@xmath6 ) than the peak - to - peak velocity shear , suggesting the physical interpretation that q0449-bx93 may also represent a merger - induced starburst or the bright central emission region of a gas - rich disk which has fragmented due to instability . while insufficient broadband data exist for q0449-bx93 to be able to reliably fit stellar population models , estimates of the stellar mass using the mass - metallicity relation of erb et al .",
    "( 2006c ) suggest that this galaxy is considerably less massive ( @xmath80 ) than q1623-bx453 . coupled with its moderate extinction - corrected h@xmath12 star formation rate of 18 @xmath52 yr@xmath6 ( close to the average for the @xmath4 galaxy sample , erb et al .",
    "2006a ) q0449-bx93 may be more representative of the general galaxy population .",

    "is marginally resolved over only a small ( @xmath205 mas , i.e. @xmath9 1 kpc ) part of the northwestern region of the galaxy comparable in size to the psf ( @xmath201 mas ) .",
    "the kinematic offset of the kdsc from the systemic redshift is approximately constant across the region of emission and does not smoothly join to the kinematics of the primary component . while this may be simply due to the small size of the kdsc ( across which we expect only @xmath206 spatially independent spectra ) , an additional interpretation ( within the framework of a fragmenting disk model ) may be that the kdsc represents one of multiple starbursting regions in the process of coalescing in the center of the galaxy for which we happen to see a kinematic differential",
    "alternatively , the kdsc may have initially begun star formation as a unit ( i.e. satellite galaxy ) distinct from the bright component of q0449-bx93 which is only now merging with its host galaxy and is perhaps responsible for the observed burst of star formation .",
    "it is unfortunately beyond the scope of the current data to derive the parameters ( e.g. relative mass ) of such a scenario with any pretense of reliability .",
    "the kinematic map of ionized gas in dsf2237a - c2 is notably different from those of q1623-bx453 and q0449-bx93 , presenting clear evidence for resolved velocity shear along the morphological major axis at redshift @xmath207 .",
    "as illustrated in figure [ resultsfig.fig ] ( bottom center panel ) , the velocity of peak [ oiii ] emission relative to the systemic redshift varies smoothly from about @xmath208 to @xmath209 km s@xmath6 over a distance @xmath210 kpc .",
    "an apparent ridge - line of high velocity ( most evident in the southwest corner of the galaxy ) presents some evidence for a flattening in the velocity curve , although this is far from robust .",
    "the velocity dispersion of individual regions within the galaxy is @xmath211 km s@xmath6 ; this is inflated by velocity shear in the integrated spectrum , giving @xmath212 km s@xmath6 .    for comparison to previous studies we produce an `` ideal '' long - slit spectrum of dsf2237a - c2 by extracting spaxels along the major axis ( pa @xmath213 ,",
    "see  3 ) using a 180 mas wide `` slit '' and plot the resulting velocity curve in figure [ c2_1dspec.fig ] .",
    "the gradual trend of velocity across the galaxy is clear in this figure , along with the apparent flattening of the velocity curve in the outskirts of the galaxy . although long - slit spectra were previously obtained with keck - nirspec observations ( pettini et al .",
    "2001 ) , no shear was observed by these authors despite close alignment of the nirspec slit ( pa 55@xmath214 ) with the now - known shear axis ( pa 38@xmath214 ) .",
    "given that the total peak - to - peak amplitude of the shear ( @xmath9 140 km s@xmath6 ) should be identifiable with the spectral resolution of nirspec , we infer that dsf2237a - c2 represents a practical case - example of how seeing - limited studies may miss velocity structure on spatial scales smaller than that of the seeing halo . for comparison , in figure [ c2blur.fig ]",
    "we plot the 2-d velocity map recovered from our osiris observations of dsf2237a - c2 after introducing a 0.5  spatial gaussian blur to roughly simulate the smearing effects of atmospheric seeing .",
    "while the overall semblance of shear is retained , the peak - to - peak observed amplitude of this shear is reduced by a factor @xmath151 .",
    "depending on the quality of seeing . ] in concert with the lower spectral resolution of nirspec ( in the low - resolution mode used for the pettini et al .",
    "2001 observations ) and slight offsets in slit placement and orientation from the optimal , it is easy to see why previous observations did not detect shear .    adopting the inclination and position angle derived in  3 from the nebular morphology",
    ", we create an idealized thin - disk model ( i.e. a rotating sheet ) which reproduces the size and orientation of dsf2237a - c2 and adjust the asymptotic velocity and turnover radius as needed to match the observations shown in figures [ resultsfig.fig ] and [ c2_1dspec.fig ] .",
    "this model is characterized by a radius of 0.21=1.6 kpc and a deprojected asymptotic velocity of 93 km s@xmath6 , implying a dynamical mass of @xmath215 interior to 1.6 kpc . ) , reflecting in large part the uncertainty in the geometric prefactors used when converting from velocities to estimates of the dynamical mass .",
    "] we plot the velocity map of this model disk in figure [ c2_diskmodel.fig ] ( left panel ) , along with the velocity map recovered from this model using simulated osiris observations which include convolution with the psf and extraction of the high surface brightness pixels ( right panel ) .",
    "we have not attempted to match every detail of the observed velocity map by fitting a more complex model , and some discrepancies remain ( the blue - side velocities in particular are imperfectly matched by the simple model ) . while more complicated fitting routines could certainly be performed ( and indeed have been for galaxies studied by frster schreiber et al .",
    "2006 and other groups ) , the exacting fits of such models frequently belie the large uncertainties inherent to the observations . for example , the evidence for a turnover in the velocity curve of dsf2237a - c2 largely disappears with only slightly less careful data reduction , and the salient features of the model are almost indistinguishable from similar models for which the inclination of the disk to the line of sight differs by over 20@xmath214 .    given the uncertainties in such quantitative models , what may we conclude about this galaxy with some confidence ?",
    "it is unlikely that the shear in dsf2237a - c2 is due primarily to a major merger because the velocity field shows a smooth , gradual transition rather than any sharp discontinuity as might be expected for two kinematically distinct components .",
    "in addition , the flux distribution is smooth and centrally concentrated ; we do not detect multiple nuclei on scales more widely separated than @xmath9 750 pc ( the spatial resolution of the observation ) . adopting the simplest interpretation that the observed shear represents a rotating gaseous disk",
    ", it is worth asking whether the disk is stable against gravitational collapse .",
    "one traditional way of quantifying such stability is via the toomre ` @xmath216 ' parameter ( toomre 1964 ) which effectively assesses the mass of the disk with respect to the total gravitating mass of the system : @xmath217 typically , values of @xmath218 represent dynamically unstable systems for which the total baryonic mass exceeds that which can be supported by the observed rotational velocity of the disk , indicating either that the disk itself is unstable or that non - rotational motions contribute a significant degree of support to the system .",
    "in contrast , values @xmath219 suggest that the observed baryonic component can be supported by the observed rotational motion alone , while @xmath220 represents the case of marginal stability .",
    "considering all of the uncertainties involved in determining the baryonic and dynamical masses , it is not possible to establish a single well - defined value for @xmath216 , although realistic estimates for various cases place a limit @xmath218 . in the first case",
    ", we consider the ratio of masses within the radius probed by the osiris detections ( @xmath221 kpc ) , for which @xmath222 in the limit that the entirety of the stellar mass lies within this radius , and @xmath223 in the opposite limit for which there is negligible stellar mass within the central kpc .",
    "similarly , we may elect to use estimates of the dynamical mass based on the central velocity dispersion ( @xmath224 ) or the rotationally - supported thin disk model ( @xmath225 ) . combining these assorted estimates",
    ", we obtain a range of values @xmath226 . in the second case ,",
    "we calculate the global @xmath216 value if we consider the mass within a much larger 10 kpc radius . at such radii @xmath227 ( as the contribution of gas mass outside the central kiloparsec is unknown ) .",
    "the dynamical mass is even more uncertain km s@xmath6 as suggested by observations . ] : inserting @xmath228 kpc in equation [ dynmass.eqn ] we find @xmath229 , while extending the disk model with asymptotic velocity 93 km s@xmath6 out to such radii gives @xmath230 . adopting the highest physically motivated limit , we determine that @xmath231 within 10 kpc . in both cases ( and most noticeably within the central kpc ) , the baryonic mass in the system outweighs what could be supported by a simple rotating disk model , highlighting the importance of the ionized gas velocity dispersion and indicating the improbability that star formation in dsf2237a - c2 occurs predominantly in a rotationally supported thin disk of gas ( see also discussion by frster schreiber et al .",
    "interestingly , the kinematics of this galaxy are quite similar to those of the @xmath232 galaxy q2343-bm133 observed by wright et al .",
    "( 2007 ) , which also had dispersion ( @xmath233 km s@xmath6 ) comparable to its velocity shear ( one - sided amplitude @xmath234 km s@xmath6 ) .",
    "we have presented the results of a pilot study of the spatially resolved spectra of galaxies at redshift @xmath0 , demonstrating that the velocity structure of the ionized gas appears to be inconsistent with simple rotational support mechanisms .",
    "while there has been some effort to target galaxies with particularly high star formation rates to ensure detection in these early stages of the observational program , the h@xmath12 flux of one of our three galaxies ( q0449-bx93 , whose star formation rate was predicted from uv photometry ) is found to be quite close to the average ( erb et al . 2006a , b ) of the @xmath4 optically - selected galaxy sample .",
    "it is , nevertheless , more than a little challenging to attempt to draw general conclusions about the entire @xmath3 galaxy population on the basis of only three galaxies , and therefore interesting to compare our results to integral - field velocity maps obtained recently by frster schreiber et al .",

    "while selection criteria varied , generally galaxies were known to be large and bright and ( in many cases ) known to exhibit considerable velocity shear or dispersion on the basis of previous long - slit observations ( erb et al .",
    "2003 , 2006a ) . of these 14 galaxies , 9 show evidence of spatially resolved velocity gradients with peak - to - peak amplitude ranging from 40 to 410 km s@xmath6 over @xmath9 10 kpc .",
    "certainly , systems with strong kinematic features appear to exist at @xmath4 , some of which may genuinely represent orbital velocities in massive rotating disks . indeed , the mean stellar mass of the subsample with shear greater than 50 km s@xmath6 is @xmath235 ( based on the 6 galaxies for which @xmath236 is given by erb et al .",

    "frster schreiber et al . 2006 ) , the distribution of stellar masses suggests that these non - rotating galaxies may instead be quite common in the @xmath4 population .",

    "a more detailed comparison may be made to the @xmath241 galaxy bzk-15504 observed by genzel et al .",
    "( 2006 ) using sinfoni in combination with natural guide - star adaptive optics for an angular resolution of 150 mas ( i.e. comparable to the @xmath9 110 - 150 mas resolution of our target galaxies after smoothing ) .",
    "while this galaxy exhibits resolved velocity shear in the outer regions of the galaxy it is not well fit by a simple disk model within 3 kpc of the nucleus ( i.e. approximately the region probed in our three target galaxies ) , which genzel et al .",
    "( 2006 ) postulate may be due to radial gas flows fueling the central agn whose presence is inferred from rest - frame uv spectroscopy .",
    "one possibility may therefore be that disordered nuclear kinematics could generally join to more orderly shear at larger radii , although in our data we find evidence for neither agn nor large - radius shear .",
    "indeed , even in the circum - nuclear regions of bzk-15504 it is not obvious that a simple disk model provides an optimal description of the kinematics since the line - of - sight velocity dispersion remains high at large radii ( @xmath242 km s@xmath6 , similar to the large values observed in dsf2237a - c2 , and in q2343-bm133 by wright et al .",
    "2007 ) , and difference maps of the observed velocity field with the best - fitting exponential disk model show deviations of greater than @xmath243 km s@xmath6 ( see discussion by wright et al . 2007 ) .",
    "what , then , may we conclude about the kinematics of these early galaxies and their implications for galaxy formation ?",
    "one common explanation for both the unusual kinematics and the high nuclear gas fraction is that these galaxies may represent major mergers of gas - rich galaxies .",
    "while this explanation may suffice for a few cases however ( e.g. perhaps q0449-bx93 ) , it is unlikely ( based on current cosmological models ) that this is the general explanation for the @xmath4 population since the space density of such galaxies with similar physical properties is far too high .",
    "alternatively , efficient gas cooling in the early universe could have led to high cold gas fractions in early - stage galactic disks which then fragmented due to self - gravity and collapsed to form a nuclear starburst ( e.g. immeli et al .",
    "2004a ) . in both pictures ,",
    "considerable kinematic structure should exist in these galaxies although ( similar to local ulirgs ; colina et al .",
    "2005 ) the kinematics of the brightest nebular emission regions may be relatively featureless and quite variable in detail from system to system .",
    "however , it is unknown whether the lack of shear ( or indeed any significant velocity structure beyond a high dispersion ) persists to lower surface - brightness ionized gas at larger radii or if the kinematics of this gas are strong and disordered , ordered with dynamically cold orbital motion , or if indeed significant nebular line emission exists at all beyond the radii probed in this study . for one of the galaxies studied here ( q1623-bx453 ) previous deep long - slit spectroscopy ( erb et al .",
    "2006b ) could have detected any significant shear if it were present at larger radii ( and the kinematic major axis was reasonably well - aligned with the slit ) , but found no evidence for such a trend .",
    "what is perhaps most clear is that we do not yet understand the dynamical state of galaxies during this period in which they are forming the bulk of their stars . while traditional theories of galaxy formation posit that the majority of star formation should occur in rotationally supported gaseous disks , this does not appear to be in good agreement with the accumulating observational evidence , inviting the construction of new models of gas cooling which can explain the flat , dispersion - dominated kinematic features of galaxies in the young universe .",
