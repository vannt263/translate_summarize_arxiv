    "it is known for more than one decade ( paczyski  @xcite ) that the nature of matter between the observer and observed source stars can be studied by observing brightenings of a large number of these stars caused by the deflection of light by the intervening material . in addition to this magnification effect , there is also a shift in the light centroid of the observed star introduced by the lens object ( hg , novikov , & polnarev  @xcite ; miyamoto & yoshii  @xcite ; walker  @xcite ) .",
    "upcoming space missions will enable us to observe this centroid shift ( paczyski  @xcite ; boden , shao , & van buren  @xcite ) .",

    "moreover , the global astrometric interferometer for astrophysics mission ( gaia , lindegren & perryman  @xcite ) will perform an astrometric survey aimed at all - sky coverage ( gilmore et al . 1998 ) with an accuracy of @xmath12 ( @xmath13 ) for sources with @xmath14 ( @xmath15 ) .",
    "these two missions are somewhat complementary : while sim has the ability to point the instrument to selected targets , it will not perform a large survey program ; on the other hand , gaia will perform an all - sky survey , but will not have the ability to point the instrument to a selected target .",

    "most of the discussions in the literature so far have been confined to the centroid shifts of photometrically detected microlensing events which can be detected by an instrument like sim ( e.g.  paczyski  @xcite ; boden et al .",

    "the disk stars can affect this signal in two ways .",
    "first , for a microlensing event that has been detected by its photometric signal , the intervening matter can lead to additional centroid shifts and variations of these shifts with time , which disturb the signal of the centroid shift caused by the lens responsible for the photometrically detected microlensing event .",

    "the variation in the centroid shift can be larger than @xmath110 without reaching the maximal value within @xmath201 .",

    "this will provide the possibility for high - accuracy astrometric follow - up observations of ongoing microlensing events . while there is a @xmath437 probability that disk stars lead to a centroid shift of the same order ,",
    "the variation of this centroid shift during the event duration of the photometric microlensing event is much smaller , so that the astrometric signal due to the lens that has been responsible for the original microlensing alert is measured .",
    "if one continues to measure the astrometric signal on larger time scales @xmath438 , one has to take into account a contamination due to astrometric microlensing by another lens in the galactic disk .",
    "contrary to sim , gaia will perform an 5-year - long all - sky survey primarily planned to measure parallaxes with high accuracy ( gilmore et al .",
    "1998 ) but does not have the ability of pointing the instrument to a selected target . to observe the parallax ellipse , gaia will perform several measurements on each target per year . for sources with @xmath439 ,",

    "let us now use gaia as an astrometric microlensing survey instrument and estimate the expected number of events .",
    "concerning the direction of the observed stars , let us be conservative with regard to the number of astrometric microlensing events and consider a direction perpendicular to the galactic plane , where the event rate is close to minimum .",
    "let us first consider the bright ( @xmath15 ) stars . for an accuracy of @xmath445 , one estimates with eq .",
    "( [ utexp ] ) @xmath446 .",

    "this is smaller than the time of the mission @xmath201 , so that events that reach a certain threshold also vary approximately by the same amount ( @xmath449 ) . we can therefore estimate the number of events simply from the event rate per observed star @xmath450 ( eqs .",
    "( [ ratepeak ] ) and  ( [ ratevarexp ] ) , table  [ table : gampeak ] ) . multiplying this with the 2535 million stars with @xmath441 , the 5 years of the mission and the blending factor of 0.78",
    ", one obtains about 400  events during the life - time of gaia . for the fainter stars ( @xmath443 ) , one obtains for @xmath451 an event rate of @xmath452 , so that with 5 years time of the mission , 1 billion stars , and a blending factor of 0.47 , one obtains about 500 events .",
    "the very bright stars ( @xmath453 ) are not expected to contribute significantly due to their small number . in total , this estimate gives about 1000 events from the gaia mission .",
    "we have underestimated this number by the assumption that the mass falls off exponentially on a scale of @xmath454 and by the assumption that all stars with @xmath455 are at @xmath456 . on the other hand ,",
    "we have overestimated that number by the assumption that a signal is detectable when it exceeds the noise threshold ( i.e.  signal - to - noise - ratio of 1 ) .",
    "there is also a dependence on the sampling rate .",
    "however , we expect the underestimations and the overestimations to cancel to a big part , so that our estimate indicates the right order .",
    "gaia will thus observe a large sample of astrometric microlensing events which can be used to determine the mass and velocities of the lenses , and to determine the scale length and height of the galactic disk .",
    "astrometric and photometric microlensing differ in two main points : first , the observed centroid shift is a function of both the dimensionless impact parameter @xmath34 and the angular einstein ring radius @xmath39 such that for a given @xmath34 , the observed centroid shift is directly proportional to @xmath39 . on the other hand ,",
    "the observed magnification is a dimensionless quantity which depends only on @xmath34 and not on any other scale .",
    "second , for large angular separations between the lens and the source , the centroid shift , being proportional to @xmath457 , falls off much more slowly than the photometric magnitude shift which is proportional to @xmath458 . due to the dependence of the centroid shift on the angular einstein radius ,",
    "astrometric microlensing favors lenses close to the observer , while photometric microlensing favors lenses around half - way between observer and source .",
    "therefore , one gets the largest centroid shifts from nearby objects , which are the sun and the planets first , whose effect has to be corrected for , and then the disk stars . because of the slower fall - off with the dimensionless separation @xmath34 in the astrometric case , detectable signatures occur for much larger angular separations , so that the average duration of an event @xmath190 can become much larger than the observation time @xmath201 . for the effect of luminous lenses",
    "this means that one can expect the lens to be resolved from the source star in some of the cases that show observable signatures .",
    "we have shown that the probability that a disk star introduces a centroid shift larger than a given amount @xmath110 at a given time reaches unity for @xmath459 for sources towards the galactic bulge at a latitude where the mass density of the disk stars is constant , which is a good approximation for baade s window , while this probability is about @xmath460 for @xmath5 ( see table 1 ) .",
    "though there is some chance that the centroid shift of a photometrically observed microlensing event , as observed e.g.  by sim , is disturbed by disk star lensing ( a 2nd lens ) , this additional centroid shift is not expected to vary much during the observation time ( @xmath429 several months ) , so that the effect expected is a slightly shifted position and the variation of the centroid shift is determined only by the primary lens .",
    "only if one extends the observations to @xmath461 after the peak , one has to take the contamination by disk stars into account .",
    "it is also interesting to examine the expected results from a microlensing survey looking for centroid shifts rather than the magnification of stars .",
    "as stated earlier , the largest centroid shifts come from nearby objects , which gives an opportunity to infer information about the disk stars . for @xmath259 and @xmath462 , @xmath257 . since one can only measure the variation in the centroid shift , not its actual value , and since the astrometric signal does not drop to zero within @xmath201 , the condition that the centroid shift exceeds the threshold @xmath110 can not be taken as criterion for an event .",
    "instead , one has to rely strictly on the criterion that the centroid shift varies by more than the threshold @xmath110 . for @xmath224 , as for most photometric microlensing events , these two criteria become equivalent .",
    "the probability that a source star in the galactic bulge towards baade s window shows a centroid shift variation larger than @xmath6 within one year is @xmath463 , which is about 3 orders of magnitude larger than the probabilities for photometric microlensing ( see table  [ table : gamvar ] ) . among the events that show significant variations , only a fraction ( 10  % for @xmath5 )",
    "will have the closest angular separation between the lens and the source within the observing time , which will result in a clear ` peak ' signature , namely an observed change of sign of the component of the centroid shift parallel to the relative proper motion between lens and source , and a maximum of the centroid - shift component transverse to it .",
    "since every event ` peaks ' once , the number of events that reach the peak within @xmath201 is related to the event rate , while events that show significant variations only can show this variation in subsequent time intervals .    for an exponential decrease of the mass density along the line of sight ( as it would be the case for lines - of - sight at high galactic latitudes ) , the probabilities for events are proportional to the scale parameter in that direction if the source stars are at a distance of a few times the scale parameter or more . for sources perpendicular to the galactic plane",
    ", the probability for a variation by more than @xmath6 and a peak within @xmath464 is @xmath8 ( table  [ table : gamvarpeak ] ) . by observing astrometric microlensing events in different directions",
    ", one can not only infer information about the total mass and the mass spectrum but also determine the scale length and scale height of the galactic disk .",
