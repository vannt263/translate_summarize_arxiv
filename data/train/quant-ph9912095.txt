    "the lagrangian must produce both the correct energy@xcite and maxwell s equations , otherwise the conjugate momenta will contain an arbitrary scaling , leading to incorrect commutation relations@xcite .      the optical fiber treated will be a single transverse mode fiber with dispersion and nonlinearity . since boundary effects are usually negligible in experiments , it is useful to first take the infinite volume limit , which effectively replaces a summation over wave - vectors with the corresponding integral .",

    "the measured intensity gain due to raman effects at a given relative frequency @xmath76 per unit length , per unit carrier photon flux @xmath77 , is : @xmath78 here the gain is positive for stokes - shifted frequencies ( @xmath79 ) , and negative for anti - stokes ( @xmath80 ) , as one would expect .",
    "this relationship allows the coupling to be estimated from measured raman gain and fluorescence properties .",
    "the simplest way to achieve this goal is to expand the raman response function in terms of a multiple - lorentzian model , which can then be fitted to observed raman fluorescence data using a nonlinear least - squares fit .",
    "we therefore expand : @xmath81 for normalization purposes , we have introduced @xmath82 , which is defined as the total effective nonlinear phase - shift coefficient per unit time and photon density ( in units of @xmath83 ) , obtained from the low - frequency nonlinear refractive index .",

    "the @xmath89 lorentzian models the brillouin contribution to the response function . in general , all of these parameters could be @xmath62-dependent , but we will often assume that they are constant in space for notational simplicity .",
    "the values for an @xmath90 fit in the case of a typical fused silica fiber are given in table [ lorfit ] , including an estimate of the effective brillouin contribution averaged over the individual brillouin scattering peaks .",
    "the coefficient of the electronic nonlinearity is now obtained explicitly in terms of the total nonlinear refractive index : @xmath91 where @xmath38 is the carrier frequency , @xmath92 is the effective cross - sectional area of the traveling mode , and @xmath93 is the fraction of the nonlinearity due to the raman gain , which has been estimated using the procedure outlined above : @xmath94    a result of this model is that the phonon operators do not have white noise behaviour . in fact , this colored noise property is significant enough to invalidate the usual markovian and rotating - wave approximations , which are therefore not used in the phonon equations . of course , the photon modes may also be in a thermal state of some type .",
    "however , thermal effects are typically much more important at the low frequencies that characterize raman and brillouin scattering , than they are at optical frequencies .",
    "in addition , if the input is a photon field generated by a laser , any departures from coherent statistics will be rather specific to the laser type , instead of having the generic properties of thermal fields .",
    "finally , there is another effect which has been so far neglected .",
    "this is the ultra - low frequency tunneling due to lattice defects@xcite .",
    "as this is not strictly linear , it can not be included accurately in our macroscopic hamiltonian . despite this",
    ", the effects of this @xmath95 type noise may be included approximately for any predetermined temperature .",
    "this can be achieved by simply modifying the refractive index perturbation term so that it becomes @xmath96 and generates the known low - frequency refractive index fluctuations .",
    "in silica optical fibers , there is a relatively flat absorption profile , with a minimum absorption coefficient of approximately @xmath97 in the vicinity of the commonly used communications wavelengths of around @xmath98 .",
    "this effect can be compensated for by the use of fiber laser amplifiers , resulting in nearly zero net absorption over a total link that includes both normal and amplified fiber segments . in practical terms",
