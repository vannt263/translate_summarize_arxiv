    "phenomenological analyses of experimental data indicate that the quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) can be formed in ultrarelativistic a+a collisions  @xcite .",
    "its local thermalization and isotropization should be mainly related to the fast processes stimulated by instabilities at small times after collision  @xcite .    in the present theoretical picture of ultrarelativistic heavy - ion collisions",
    "@xcite , the early stage is preferably characterized by the large number of partons with `` small '' momenta of the order of the so - called saturation momentum @xmath0 , which are better viewed as a classical yang - mills field in vacuum  @xcite , sometimes named as `` glasma '' .",
    "the initial conditions for glasma evolution are determined by the color glass condensate ( cgc ) concept by mclerran - venugopalan ( mv )  @xcite , where the field sources _ before _ collision can be presented by the randomly distributed valent quarks of colliding hadrons and are located ( due to lorentz contraction ) on infinitesimally thin sheets running along the light - cone .",
    "these sources are also treated as the hard partons with `` large '' momenta , which escape quickly from the system _ after _ collision .",
    "thus , the original mv model neglects the interaction between the field and the hard partonic medium .",
    "the space - time dynamics of the yang - mills fields in vacuum ( `` the melting of cgc '' ) in assumption of boost invariance was investigated numerically , and the energy and the number distributions of the classically produced gluons were computed ( see , for example , review  @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , it was shown that the violations of boost invariance cause a non - abelian weibel instability  @xcite leading the field ( soft ) modes to grow with proper time  @xcite .",
    "however , the effect of isotropization is out of this model .    on the other hand , the hard partons ( produced after moment of collision ) with large transverse momentum @xmath1 can be studied within the framework of transport theory , and if the presence of the soft classical field is neglected , the time evolution of the these partons is described by boltzmann equation with a collision kernel  @xcite ( for comment ,",
    "however , it has been argued that the collective processes caused by the soft gauge field should be dominant in equilibration of qgp instabilities developed due to anisotropic distributions of released hard partons  @xcite .    the third regime where the back - reaction of the field on the hard partons ( treated as particles ) is still weak but where the self - interaction of the former may be strongly nonlinear is governed by a `` hard - loop '' effective action which has been derived in ref .",
    "@xcite for arbitrary momentum - space anisotropies .",
    "it is interesting to note that the numerical studies of anisotropic hard partonic modes coupled to unstable soft modes revealed the tendency of the non - abelian gauge fields to `` abelianize '' during the stage of instabilities  @xcite .",
    "it means that the field commutators become much smaller than the fields themselves .",
    "moreover , the dynamics of the abelian and non - abelian fields is qualitatively the same , if these fields are not strong enough .    in this paper",
    ", we examine a scenario of glasma evolution with cgc - like initial conditions , when the presence of the ( momentum-)anisotropic medium of hard partons is also taken into account .",
    "our goal is to evaluate analytically the behavior of such a system in short - time interval in weak - interaction regime , when the application of the abelianized version of the field dynamics is possible .",
    "although the last condition demands to consider the system at relatively large times after a+a collision ( as follows from numerical investigations ) but simplifies the problem considerably . however , it is already pointed out in refs .  @xcite that the early equilibration of qgp is not necessary to describe pion and kaon spectra observed experimentally at rhic in brookhaven .",
    "since the momentum - space anisotropy of the system can be estimated by means of transport coefficients , we attempt to calculate a conductivity tensor and to determine an effect of instabilities on it .",
    "it is expected that the back - reaction can lead to a negative color conductivity in the boost - invariant case .",
    "as was mentioned in introduction , the classical yang - mills theory in space - time with pseudo - cylindrical metric @xmath2 ( @xmath3 and @xmath4 are proper time and space - time rapidity , respectively ) has been abelianized since @xmath5 , where @xmath6  gev @xcite .",
    "it means that we actually come to the maxwell theory with 4-potential @xmath7 ( hereafter , we neglect the normalization constant @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the number of colors ) .",
    "the free - field theory in mid - rapidity region in the case of central collisions , when the potentials are parametrized as @xmath10 ( cgc - like gauge fixing ) , @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , has been already examined ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) in order to describe the space - time evolution of the field flow ( collective velocity ) at pre - thermal stage of collisions .",
    "it turns out that the results obtained are qualitatively the same like in the case of non - abelian model from ref .",
    "@xcite .    here",
    "we generalize the abelianized glasma equations by inclusion of sources in the right - hand side : @xmath14 note that @xmath15 , @xmath16 and the current conservation is satisfied automatically .    in the context of a+a collisions ,",
    "the presence of the sources corresponds to the existence of the medium .",
    "accounting for hard partonic component ( viewed as particle subsystem ) , we aim to investigate the field and particle dynamics .",
    "the components of the current in minkowskian space - time are @xmath17 where @xmath18 ( the case of massless partons ) , @xmath19 are distribution functions of ( scalar ) partons .",
    "the distribution of partons is supposed to be anisotropic in the momentum space and inhomogeneous in configuration one .",
    "space - time development of functions @xmath19 is determined by vlasov equations which we will formulate below .",
    "note that `` @xmath20 '' corresponds to the charge of electron in the context of electrodynamics",
    ".    a toy field model with non - trivial right - hand side has been already investigated in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "it is useful to parametrize momenta as @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is momentum rapidity .    in the terms of our variables , one has : @xmath23 where @xmath24 , @xmath25 .",
    "taking conditions @xmath15 , @xmath16 into account , the difference @xmath26 should be odd function of @xmath27 and @xmath28 during evolution .",
    "the evolution of @xmath19 is generated by vlasov equations : @xmath29 where @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32    since the sources ( partons ) are randomly distributed at the initial moment @xmath33 , we put @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is defined as @xmath36 , and @xmath37 in our investigations .",
    "it means that the system is neutral and the currents are absent at @xmath33 .    using the curved coordinates , we obtain @xmath38 @xmath39 we can see that the operator of lorentz force @xmath40 is simply the operator of rotation in momentum space and , therefore , conserves the absolute value of transverse momentum @xmath1 .",
    "it is expected that such structure of the lorentz force should lead to the momentum transmission between different directions and , consequently , to the instabilities in this system .",
    "in this section , we concentrate on finding the solution of the set of the coupled maxwell  vlasov equations . since the glasma field is essential at early stage of nuclear collisions ( in contrast with the hard partons or quarks ) , the study of the field dynamics actually dominates . by this way ,",
    "it is necessary to express the particle currents through the fields . in general , the vlasov equations are complicated .",
    "for this reason , we are forced to use a method for approximate solving this set .",
    "fluctuation of distribution function , which arises during fairly small time interval @xmath41 , can be found in the linear approximation in @xmath42 : @xmath43    in this approximation , the space - time evolution of correction @xmath44 , determining difference @xmath45 and the current components , results from the following equation : @xmath46    note that this approximation does not permit us to investigate an isotropization of the particle ( hard parton ) kinematic part of the energy - momentum tensor , proportional to the sum @xmath47 .",
    "it is expected that such isotropization effect can be observed if the correction of the order @xmath48 is included .",
    "nevertheless , the approximation under consideration allows one to study the instabilities in the system .",
    "if @xmath49 , there exists an approximate solution , which is short - living in time and localized in space , @xmath50    it is easy to verify that the action of evolution operator @xmath51 on this expression gives us @xmath52 where @xmath53(\\hat f f^0).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    thus , if @xmath49 , the last term in right - hand side of ( [ prop ] ) vanishes . also note that this is the simplified proof of eq .",
    "( [ appr ] ) . in order to understand this approximation in details ,",
    "see appendix a.    often the model initial boost - invariant distributions in central heavy - ion collisions take the form @xmath54 ( note that for the sake of correctness @xmath35 has to be also a function of @xmath55 ) . in this case",
    ", we obtain @xmath56 where @xmath57 are conductivities .",
    "the common multiplier dependent on the initial distribution of partons is @xmath58    we can immediately see that @xmath59 and @xmath60 have the different signs .",
    "it says about the presence of _ negative color conductivity _ driving to instability in the system .",
    "the mechanism of this instability looks simple : we deal with situation when the particles ( partons ) give the energy to the field .",
    "now let us analyze the properties of @xmath61 .",
    "firstly , we assume that the initial distribution @xmath35 is the product of the function of @xmath62 and the spatial distribution @xmath63 in transverse plane .",
    "taking into account that the initial distribution is even function of @xmath27 , one gets @xmath64 where @xmath65 is a positive constant arising after integration over momentum variables .",
    "thus , @xmath66 , while @xmath67 .",
    "it means that the color negative conductivity takes place in the transverse plane .    at this stage",
    "the natural question arises : how the negative conductivity does look in the laboratory reference frame .",
    "( [ ohm ] ) are actually the ohm law , where @xmath68 , @xmath69 are the ( chromo)electric field strengths . introducing @xmath70 in the minkowskian space - time , we find that @xmath71 , @xmath72 . in these terms",
    "the current components are @xmath73    if @xmath74 and @xmath75 , one has that @xmath76 , @xmath77 , @xmath78 . thus the color negative conductivity takes place under some conditions ( related with the value of angles ) in the laboratory reference frame .",
    "this effect is associated with filamentation in the plasma  @xcite .",
    "since it is hard to find the general solution of field equations for arbitrary distribution @xmath79 , we try to study the particular case , when @xmath80 .",
    "this assumption simplifies the problem significantly .",
    "when @xmath61 is a constant , the spatial dependence of the field potentials is immediately derived by using the bessel - fourier transform : @xmath81 where the initial conditions resulting from cgc concept are applied : @xmath82    in principal , functions @xmath83 , @xmath84 can be expressed for arbitrary @xmath85 in terms of heun functions .",
    "however , these expressions are complicated for heuristic analysis of our model and its applications .    for this reason ,",
    "we write down the functions @xmath86 at @xmath87 :    @xmath88    where @xmath89 is the whittaker function .",
    "it is easy to verify that the occurrence of negative color conductivity @xmath90 leads to a growth of the some components of magnetic and electric fields in comparison with the case of the theory without partonic medium .",
    "it is important that the abelian magnetic field exhibits a growth , draining some energy from the particle reservoir .",
    "the instabilities are related with the presence of exponents in functions @xmath86 ; whittaker functions change actually a phase of oscillations only in comparison with the free theory .    if @xmath91 and @xmath87 , we come to the well - known expressions ( see , for example , ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) : @xmath92 where @xmath93 is the bessel function .",
    "these expressions correspond to the perturbative ( lowest order in the source charge densities ) solution .",
    "now it is necessary to determine the functions @xmath94 and @xmath95 .",
    "they originate from the initial conditions for the field equations .",
    "note that @xmath95 and @xmath94 are fluctuating quantities within the cgc concept , and the pair correlator of the ( yang  mills ) potentials is observable only .",
    "however the field potentials in our approach are not stochastic quantities in the contrast with cgc ideology because we goal to constitute the initial conditions on the base of the statistically averaged components of the energy - momentum tensor accounting for the spatial inhomogeneity .    in order to derive @xmath95 and @xmath94 ,",
    "let us use the energy density distribution and the requirement of the absence of field flow at the initial moment .",
    "in mid - rapidity region ( @xmath74 ) and @xmath75 ( note that transverse directions are equal in the system with cylindrical symmetry ) , when @xmath96 , @xmath97 , we have that @xmath98 where @xmath99 is assumed to be the known function from numerical calculations or physical point of view .",
    "our trick consists in division of the energy density between different field components : @xmath100 where @xmath101 and @xmath102 is a some separation constant ( in general , @xmath102 should be function of @xmath55 ) .",
    "since the potentials @xmath103 , @xmath104 are real , one has that @xmath105 .    in principal",
    ", @xmath102 is arbitrary constant .",
    "practically , it turns out that @xmath106 ( it follows from comparison of electric and magnetic strengths within the numerical approach ) .",
    "note that the observables of the source - free theory are independent on @xmath102 .",
    "thus , one finds @xmath107 here @xmath108    these expressions finally determines the fields in our model .",
    "in the previous sections we have formulated the model of glasma in hard partonic medium . since the classical field modes are usually interpreted as soft partons , their spatial dependence at early stage of a+a collision may be done within the framework of glauber model .",
    "however , the explanations of experimental data can be efficiently done with application of another distributions too . as it was demonstrated in ref .",
    "@xcite , the gaussian distribution of soft partons leads to the adequate pion spectra produced after collision at rhic . to formulate the field initial conditions , here",
    "we would like to choose the same approximation for the energy density at the initial moment , @xmath109 where @xmath110  gev/@xmath111 , @xmath112  fm .",
    "then we find that @xmath113    the boost - invariant distribution function @xmath35 ( defining conductivities ) is completely arbitrary at this point , so in order to proceed one needs to assume a specific form for it . in what follows we will require that @xmath35 is obtained from isotropic function , @xmath114 by the replacement @xmath115 in @xmath116 and by the rescaling of one dimension in momentum space , @xmath117 where @xmath118 takes the role of saturation moment , @xmath119 is a parameter reflecting the strength of the partonic medium anisotropy and @xmath120 is a normalization constant .",
