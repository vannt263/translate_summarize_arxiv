    "a joint discussion ( jd ) dedicated to the connection between radio properties and high energy emission in active galactic nuclei ( agn ) took place on the 23rd and 24th of august 2012 during the xxviii iau general assembly in beijing , china .",
    "it was a great opportunity to confront observational multiwavelength data with theoretical models for agn .",
    "the jd included four main sessions covering the agn population in the radio and gamma - ray bands (   2 ) , high resolution core and jet properties (   3 ) , multiwavelength correlations and variability (   4 ) , and a final discussion on jet physics and the role of black hole ( bh ) spin and accretion (   5 ) .",
    "eight invited plus 11 contributed oral talks were presented together with 34 contributed posters to an interesting scientific discussion . in the following we present a brief summary for the talks in the four sessions .",

    "radio observations present a rich phenomenology in studies of agn  extensive multi - frequency lightcurves ( e.g. , fig  [ fig : hayashida ] ) , observations and statistics of superluminal motions , radio spectral polarimetric imaging on all scales ( jets , hotspots , lobes ) , and an abundant variety of source types including young radio sources and radio - quiet objects . in the egret era , there were 66 high - confidence blazars identified with gamma - ray sources ( 27 lower - confidence ) and only a few radio galaxies ( e.g. , cen a , 3c  111 ) .",
    "now we are in the era of the  gamma - ray space telescope with the increased capabilities provided by the large area telescope ( lat ) . the 2nd lac agn catalog ( 2lac ) `` clean '' sample included : 310 flat spectrum radio quasars ( fsrqs ) , 395 bl lacs , 156 blazars of unknown type , and 24 agns ( include radio galaxies ) .",
    "fsrqs have been detected with @xmath0 @xmath110@xmath2 erg / s up to @xmath3 .",
    "significant correlations are present between radio and gamma - ray properties .",
    "fsrqs are on average brighter and apparently more luminous in the radio band than bl lacs ( but a redshift incompleteness is present ) .",
    "thanks to the 1st -lat hard source catalog ( 1fhl ) which includes data from august 2008 through july 2011 , possibly softer agn gamma - ray spectra appear with increasing redshift , and many new targets are now available for current and future tev telescopes .",
    "the high energy emission site for agn can be probed with gamma - ray imaging in exceptional cases , like in the giant radio lobes of centaurus a ( and possibly in ngc 6251 , and fornax a ) .",

    ", it will be possible to extend the radio / gamma - ray correlations to low fluxes / luminosities , to continue to identify possible sites of gamma - ray emission , to test if radio - quiet agn are also gamma - ray quiet , and to look for bubble sources in nearby galaxies .",

    "radio - loud systems appear to be the only agn loud in gamma - rays .",
    "in addition to blazars and radio galaxies , the only newly established class of gamma - loud agn are the radio - loud narrow line seyfert 1s ( nls1s ) .",
    "radio - quiet seyferts seem gamma - quiet as well .",
    "radio properties of nuclear jets may be directly related to gamma - ray properties .",
    "however , nuclear relativistic jets are not the only relevant gamma - ray production site as lobes and bubbles are observed in gamma - rays .",
    "correlations between radio and gamma - ray properties seem to be present , but more data and better statistics are necessary to understand if they are real or not . in flux - flux limited samples , artificial correlations are expected .",

    "the four radio galaxies are : m87 , cen a , ngc 1275 , ic 130 .",

    "conclusions are : i ) no strong link is present between fast jets and gamma - ray detection ; ii ) agn class and gamma - ray variability are connected to jet speeds ; iii ) a correlation between gamma - ray luminosity and apparent velocity is found ( higher velocity for stronger gamma - variable sources ) ; iv ) gamma - ray detected sources appear wider and with larger jet distortions .",
    "different findings with respect to the previous studies may be due to different observing frequency ( probing either different jet regions or structures ) or the difference in sampling of the proper motion data .",

    "the  2lac agn catalog has no contamination from the host galaxy , even if may still be incomplete due to issues with source associations .",

    "the gamma - ray flare in july 2011 occurred after a rotation of 380 degree of the optical evpa suggesting a common region for the optical and gamma - ray emission .",
    "the new jet component is likely evidence of a shock propagating downstream along the jet .",
    "if the gamma - ray flare in october 2011 is related to the radio outburst , it would strongly support the idea that some gamma - ray flares are produced parsecs aways from the nucleus .",

    "a very strong and complex gamma - ray flare was observed in 3c  273 in september 2009 .",
    "the flare was related to the formation of superluminal components studied at 43 ghz and to a radio flare observed with the itapetinga radio telescope at 43 ghz .",
    "the gamma - ray flux increased by a factor of 20 , while only by a factor two in radio .",
    "we explain this fact as a change in the doppler factor , due to a change in the angle between the jet and the line of sight .",
    "this fact was predicted by the precessing jet model of abraham & romero ( 1999 ) .",

    "the core shift with frequency has been estimated in 2001 and 2006 .",
    "a large difference has been found between the two measurements possibly due to a strong flux density increase at 15 ghz in 2006 .",
    "this radio flare is possibly due to the core activity as shown by a new component that emerged from the central core region . because of their small angular distance in the plane of the sky ,",
    "3c  66a and the radio galaxy 3c  66b , are an ideal pair to obtain a combined core - shift measurement of the two sources .",
    "comparison with data at different epochs is confusing : the difference in core shift result can not be simply explained by the core flare activity .",

    "the idea of a unique , large , `` relaxed '' emission region is , at least sometimes , inadequate .",
    "a relevant problem in agn is where the high - energy emission is located : close to the bh within the blr or further down in the parsec - scale jet ? correlations can be used to locate the unresolved gamma - ray emission site .",

    "if the region emitting at vhe is close to the black hole - accretion disk region ( i.e. , it is inside the blr ) , we expect that gamma - ray flares precede radio variations ( assuming as vlbi zero epoch the beginning of a millimeter flare ) , and little or no correlation with radio variations . if the vhe region is distant , at or downstream of the radio core ( i.e. outside the blr ) , we expect gamma - ray flares simultaneous , or after , the beginning of radio variations and a correlation between vhe and radio variations .",
