    "with full energy collisions in the large hadron collider ( lhc ) scheduled for spring 2008 , in the near future the tev scale will become directly accessible in experiments .",
    "theoretical arguments and precision measurements indicate that ground - breaking discoveries regarding the mechanism of electroweak symmetry breaking and the origin of mass can be expected @xcite .",
    "the discovery and analysis of the higgs boson predicted by the standard model ( sm ) with higgs mechanism @xcite or additional particles , for instance in supersymmetric extensions @xcite , are the primary goal of the lhc physics program @xcite .    for that purpose theoretical predictions",
    "are needed not only for signal processes , but also for background processes in search channels that do not allow for background determination from data ( via sideband interpolation ) .",
    "while most background processes have previously been considered as signals , these calculations frequently employ approximations that are appropriate for signal selections , but may lead to inaccurate predictions for suppressed backgrounds . in many cases , higher order corrections have been calculated for inclusive cross sections , but not for fully differential cross sections due to the increased complexity . while inclusive corrections are in good approximation applicable to signal predictions , only fully differential corrections are guaranteed to provide accurate predictions for suppressed backgrounds .",
    "although the discovery significance @xmath1 is less affected by background corrections compared to signal corrections of similar size and sign , the applied selection cuts can strongly enhance suppressed background @xmath2-factors , but will not have a significant effect on the signal @xmath2-factor .    in the following we focus on the production of a sm higgs boson in vector boson or gluon fusion that decays into @xmath3 bosons , which in turn decay leptonically .",
    "these search channels contribute significantly to the lhc sm higgs discovery potential for higgs masses between 120 and 200 gev @xcite .",
    "since the decay neutrinos escape detection , the higgs momentum can not be reconstructed .",
    "signal and background can thus not be separated experimentally .",
    "higgs observation becomes a counting experiment and reliable background predictions essential . for vector boson fusion ( see fig .  [",

    "perturbative predictions for the production and decay of heavy particles have frequently relied on the narrow - width approximation ( nwa ) , which significantly reduces the number of feynman diagrams that have to be taken into account .",
    "the parametric error estimate of @xmath8 is reliable if applied selection cuts do not affect the resonant region and additional sub- and nonresonant diagrams with the same final state can be neglected .",
    "while this is usually the case for sm signal cross sections , the same is not true for suppressed background cross sections . for backgrounds ,",
    "it is thus important to verify that the nwa is appropriate by comparing with calculations that take into account the complete fixed - order amplitude . for the higgs search channels considered here",
    ", this comparison has been performed for the dominant reducible background due to top pair production in ref .",
    "off - shell predictions with the complete leading - order ( lo ) amplitude for @xmath4 , @xmath4 + 1 jet and @xmath4 + 2 jets ( with 87 , 600 and 5820 feynman diagrams contributing for the at the lhc dominant @xmath9 subprocess , respectively ) were obtained using the ` pp2ttnj ` program @xcite .",

    "the complete lo predictions are typically 10 - 20% larger than the corresponding nwa predictions .",
    "the standard nwa uncertainty estimate is thus not applicable .",
    "note that this even holds for the total cross section at the lhc , which is enhanced by about 5% if single- and nonresonant diagrams are taken into account .    in gluon fusion the applied central jet veto increases the single - resonant contribution to approximately match the double - resonant contribution .",
    "since the lo background uncertainty is large and the techniques for a complete @xmath12 calculation at next - to - leading order ( nlo ) are still under development ( see sec .  [ extrapol ] ) , inspired by the natural separation of the double- and single - resonant graphs into gauge - invariant subsets ( @xmath4 and @xmath13 ) at lo when the nwa is applied , the authors of ref .",

    "the dominant irreducible background to @xmath15 is @xmath3-pair production , which occurs in quark - antiquark annihilation .",
    "the gluon - induced subprocess formally enters at next - to - next - to - leading order ( nnlo ) , but its importance is enhanced by the large gluon flux at the lhc and by experimental higgs search cuts .. additional higgs search cuts are @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 @xmath19 , @xmath20.[nk_cuts ] ] recently , a fully differential calculation of @xmath21 including the top - bottom massive quark loop contribution and the intermediate higgs contribution with full spin and decay angle correlations and allowing for arbitrary invariant masses of the @xmath3 bosons has been completed @xcite .",
