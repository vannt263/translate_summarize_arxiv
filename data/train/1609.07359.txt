    "electric conductivity is an inherently quantum phenomenon because it depends on the energy level structure present in materials .",
    "although electron orbital energies in materials form continuous bands , the energy gap between occupied orbitals ( valence band ) and unoccupied orbitals ( conduction band ) can be finite .",
    "this gap predominantly defines the conductive properties of any material : the band gap of conductive materials is small ( semi - conductors ) or zero ( metals ) , while nonconductive materials ( insulators ) have a large gap .",
    "electric conductivity is a dynamical phenomenon and in quantum mechanics it must be represented by the dynamics of a non - stationary state .",
    "thus if one would like to provide a simple , idealized , zero - temperature illustration within quantum mechanics without going into quantum statistical thermodynamics , the system needs to be in a superposition state .",
    "unfortunately , in the desire for simplicity , most of the textbooks go too far passing by the concept of the superposition state and produce awkward explanations , where under the electric field potential , an electron can move and at the same time be in a stationary state.@xcite this is of course a misleading oversimplification , because the probability density for any object in a stationary state is time - independent .    in order to provide a simple but quantum mechanically correct explanation for the dependence of conductance on the band gap , one needs to consider a superposition state at some point .",
    "moreover , since the superposition is the key to electronic motion under the influence of electric field , its creation should be more pronounced when the gap between ground and excited levels is smaller .",
    "on the other hand increasing the gap should reduce the potency of the electric field to create a superposition state .",
    "some solid - state textbooks@xcite provide an explanation that involves electronic superposition states or wave packets built as a linear combination of one - electron bloch functions obtained for periodic potentials . of course",
    ", such explanations would not be possible to incorporate in undergraduate quantum mechanics courses without significant detours into the consideration of periodic systems .",
    "in this paper we present a simple single - particle illustration of the electric conduction phenomena based on the one - dimensional particle - in - a - box ( pib ) model . the key element of our consideration is the superposition state emerging under the influence of an electric field , modelled as a sudden tilt of the potential box s bottom .",
    "this superposition state gives rise to the quantum dynamics necessary for particle transport within the box .",
    "properties of this superposition state are related to the gap between occupied and unoccupied energy levels , thus providing a simple explanation of the gap - conduction relation in real materials .",
    "there are a few simplifications separating dynamics of our model system from the conductance dynamics in the real material : 1 ) only one electron is considered and thus electron - electron and electron - nuclear interactions are neglected ; 2 ) the pib model represents a closed system , and its dynamics can not produce steady particle current ; instead , particle s movement has an oscillatory character .",
    "these simplifications are not essential for illustrating the gap - conductance relation if we associate the conductance with various dynamical properties of a single - particle probability density .",
    "this view of conduction can be taught at the elementary level of quantum mechanics for undergraduate students .",
    "all illustrations provided in this paper can be demonstrated in the class or given as separate projects for advanced undergraduate or even graduate courses .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii.a we consider the pib model and the introduction of a constant electric field .",

    "to establish notation let us introduce a particle of unit charge with mass @xmath0 in a box of size @xmath1 with infinite potential walls , then the hamiltonian is h_0(x ) & = & -+v_0(x ) , + v_0(x ) & = & \\ {    ll 0 ,   x + ,  x.    .",

    "n^(0)(x ) & = & ( ) , and they are enumerated by the subscript @xmath3 , where @xmath3=1 corresponds to the ground state .",
    "we will use the ground state as the initial state of our system in the absence of the electric field . to model the electric field that creates bias , we add to pib s hamiltonian a linear potential within the box v(x ) & = & \\ {    ll -x ,   x + ,  x ,    . so that the total system hamiltonian with the electric field becomes [ eq : h ] h(x )",
    "= h_0(x ) + v(x ) .",
    "this linear potential can be seen as a result of applying a constant electric field @xmath4 because the electric potential @xmath5 entering the hamiltonian for a charged particle will be exactly @xmath6 .    upon sudden turn - on of the electric field ,",
    "our original state @xmath7 is not a stationary state of @xmath8 , it is instead a superposition of @xmath8 s eigenstates and thus undergoes dynamics .",
    "the simplest way to obtain this dynamics is using the eigenstates of @xmath8 [ eq : tise2 ] h(x ) _",
    "n(x ) = e_n _ n(x ) to solve the time - dependent schrdinger equation ( tdse ) . expanding the initial state ( x , 0 ) & = & _ 1^(0)(x ) + [ eq : ini ] & = & _ n=1^c_n_n(x ) as a linear combination of @xmath9 with coefficients [ eq : cn ] c_n = _",

    "and @xmath25 for the @xmath3th @xmath26 is equal to @xmath16 in eq .  .",
    "therefore , solving the eigenvalue problem in eq .",
    "gives all needed quantities to construct the dynamics of the initial distribution under the influence of the sudden turn - on of the constant electric field using eq .  .",
    "to obtain some qualitative insight in what determines the probability density dynamics , we will consider which system parameters affect @xmath16 coefficients , because the larger the spread of these coefficients , the more pronounced the expected dynamics .",
    "we will use time - independent perturbation theory ( tipt ) as our main tool in this analysis .",
    "tipt formulates eigenstates of @xmath8 as a series _ n(x ) = _ n^(0)(x ) + _ n^(1)(x ) + _ n^(2)(x)+ ... , where @xmath27 are eigenfunctions of the @xmath2 hamiltonian and @xmath28 are higher order perturbative corrections to @xmath27 . if we substitute this expansion in eq .",

    "this expression clearly shows that @xmath31 are inversely proportional to the gap between ground and @xmath3th state @xmath34 .",
    "the numerator and denominator of this expression can be evaluated analytically for our model [ eq : vn1 ] _ n^(0)|v| _",

    "program.@xcite therefore , perturbation theory predicts growth of @xmath36 as @xmath37 .",
    "an alternative way to characterize the mobility of the initial distribution is to calculate the polarizability of the system .",
    "the polarizability of the ground state is the second derivative of the energy with respect to the electric field = _ = 0 .",
    "tipt is exactly the right tool to obtain such derivatives.@xcite according to tipt , the total energy of the ground state is e_1 = e_1^(0 ) + e_1^(1 ) + e_1^(2 ) + ... , where the @xmath38th order @xmath39 is proportional to @xmath40 , therefore the polarizability is the second order correction to the energy in tipt = = _ n1 .",
    "thus the system is more polarizable when the gaps between the ground and excited states are low .",

    "the expression for polarizability can be further simplified as & = _ n 1 this infinite sum can be evaluated by the _ mathematica _",

    "therefore , the system polarizability grows linearly with the particle mass and quartically with the size of the box .",
    "more advanced but closely - related characterization of dynamics can be done using the conventional definition of the electron mobility @xmath41 , where v_e = ( t)| x | ( t ) , is the average electron velocity under the influence of the electric field @xmath4 . employing the ehrenfest theorem@xcite it is easy to show that for our system ( t)| x | ( t ) & = + ( t)| p | ( t ) & = -(t)| | ( t ) = .",
