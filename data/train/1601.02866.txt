    "<S> accurate and integrable control of different flows within microfluidic channels is crucial to further development of lab - on - a - chip and fully integrated adaptable structures . here </S>",
    "<S> we introduce a flexible microactuator that buckles at a high deformation rate and alters the downstream fluid flow . </S>",
    "<S> the microactuator consists of a confined , thin , dielectric film that buckles into the microfluidic channel when exposed to voltage supplied through conductive fluid electrodes . </S>",
    "<S> we estimate the critical buckling voltage , and characterize the buckled shape of the actuator . finally , we investigate the effects of frequency , flow rate , and the pressure differences on the behavior of the buckling structure and the resulting fluid flow . </S>",
    "<S> these results demonstrate that the voltage  induced buckling of embedded microstructures using fluid electrodes provides a means for high speed attenuation of microfluidic flow .    </S>",
    "<S> dielectric actuators consist of an electrically insulating film that can be polarized through an applied electric field , commonly implemented by adhering the film between two electrodes.@xcite upon exposure to an electric field , the opposing charges draw the electrodes closer together , developing a maxwell stress within the film which reduces its thickness . </S>",
    "<S> the incompressible nature of the film causes its surface area to increase when its edges are free.@xcite constraining the film from expanding by clamping its edges causes an additional compressive stress to develop within the film , which will cause it to buckle if it exceeds a critical magnitude determined by its geometry and material properties.@xcite for large deformations , compliance is desired , and a variety of electrode systems have been utilized  @xcite including carbon grease,@xcite silicone rubber embedded with carbon black,@xcite ionic elastomers,@xcite and electrodeless ion - bombardment.@xcite in this letter , we utilize a fluid electrode to buckle a thin film embedded within a microfluidic channel . </S>",
    "<S> the dielectric elastomeric film is surrounded by a conductive fluid , and actuated by passing an electric signal through the fluid which causes the clamped film to buckle out of the plane . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate the buckled film s ability to alter the fluid flow while being actuated at high frequencies and relatively low voltages . </S>",
    "<S> as controlling and directing fluid flow with microfluidic systems is crucial to enhancing their functionality,@xcite the development of microvalves and micropumps is essential,@xcite and our results demonstrate the feasibility of using an electric signal to actuate internally embedded structures .    </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate the fluid electrode microactuators within a microfluidic device where a y - junction brings together two miscible fluid streams driven by an equivalent pressure difference @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> upstream of the y - junction , we define an `` active '' channel which will be exposed to the electric field , and a `` passive '' channel which will only be subjected to the pressure  driven flow ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1]a ) . </S>",
    "<S> the fluid  structure interaction between the voltage  induced buckling of a dielectric plate and its surrounding microfluidic environment is achieved by preparing two vertically offset fluid channels separated by a thin film ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1]b ) . </S>",
    "<S> the fluid channels above and below the dielectric film are filled with an electrically conductive fluid , _ </S>",
    "<S> e.g. _ salt water , therefore , by grounding the upper channel and applying a positive voltage to the lower fluid we induce a maxwell stress in the dielectric film . </S>",
    "<S> if this stress exceeds the critical buckling threshold of the plate , it will buckle out of the plane and constrict the microchannel . to bias the buckling in the direction that will form a constriction in the active channel </S>",
    "<S> , we apply a small amount of positive pressure to the channel below the dielectric film .    to experimentally determine the buckling behavior of the plate </S>",
    "<S> , we image the circular intersection between the upper and lower channels from above ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2]a ) , and use an image processing technique to estimate the shape of the buckled thin film . applying voltage beyond the critical threshold </S>",
    "<S> causes the circular plate to buckle out of the plane , constricting the channel . since the intensity of the fluid color depends on the fluid height at each point , we can determine the buckling shape of the plate by tracking the changes in the intensity of the dyed fluid </S>",
    "<S> this technique is sensitive to small changes in intensity , thus enabling us to obtain a 3d deformation pattern . </S>",
    "<S> fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2]b shows that the thin film is relatively flat at the beginning of a cycle , when the voltage is off . as the voltage increases , the plate buckles with an axisymmetric mode whose amplitude reaches its maximum at about 2/3 of the cycle @xmath1 , followed by a quick return to its initial shape when the voltage goes back to zero . by tracking both the film deflection and the alteration of the downstream fluid flow , we observe a critical buckling voltage of @xmath2 .    to estimate the onset of buckling </S>",
    "<S> , we consider the stress generated in a dielectric material from an externally applied voltage in the manner presented by pelrine _ </S>",
    "<S> et al . _  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite the electrostatic energy stored in film is given by @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the charge and @xmath5 is the capacitance given by @xmath6 in terms of the free space permittivity @xmath7 , the relative dielectric constant of the material @xmath8 , and the ratio of the film s area to thickness , @xmath9 . the pressure due to a change in electrostatic energy is @xmath10 , where the comma denotes differentiation . as noted by pelrine _ </S>",
    "<S> et al . _ ,  @xcite the essential difference between parallel  plate capacitors and deformable electrodes is the compliance of material , which results in doubling the stress in the film . </S>",
    "<S> this doubling arises from the stored electrostatic energy changing both the film thickness and area . </S>",
    "<S> since the film is incompressible , _ </S>",
    "<S> i.e. _ @xmath11 , the film can deform to spread out similar charges on the film surface , and compress to bring opposing charges together , and these deformations will necessarily be coupled to the incompressibility constraint . </S>",
    "<S> an electric field is given by @xmath12 , and can be approximated as @xmath13 when the field is uniform . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting stress from the applied voltage is @xmath14 . </S>",
    "<S> from the incompressibility condition , it is apparent that for small strains the radial strain is half the transverse strain,@xcite _ i.e. _ @xmath15 . </S>",
    "<S> the same must be true for the radial stress as the plate is clamped along its edge and constrained from expanding in plane . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , we can determine the critical buckling voltage by comparing the radial stress imparted by the electric field , _ i.e. _ @xmath16 , with the stress required to buckle a circular plate . </S>",
    "<S> the critical buckling stress for a circular plate is determined by considering the linearized plate equations in cylindrical coordinates . for the plate geometry studied here , </S>",
    "<S> these equations have periodic solutions in the form of bessel functions of the first kind , _ </S>",
    "<S> i.e. _ @xmath17 , and predict the critical buckling stress to be @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the bending energy , and @xmath20 is the plate radius  @xcite . equating the radial stress induced by the electric field with this critical stress  while considering the plane stress condition  results in the following equation for the critical voltage to buckle the plate : @xmath21^{\\frac{1}{2 } } ,   \\label{eq_vc}\\ ] ] where the constant for a clamped plate exhibiting the first buckling mode is @xmath22 . for example , here are the measured parameters for one of our samples : @xmath23 . equation [ eq_vc ] therefore estimates that @xmath24 , which is in agreement with the experimentally measured critical voltage of @xmath2 .    </S>",
    "<S> we next study the interaction of the buckling plate with the adjacent fluid flow , which is evidenced by the the changes in ratio of one fluid s width relative to the channel width ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3]a ) . when the plate buckles out of the plane , it alters the flow in the corresponding channel , which consequently changes the ratio of the two fluids downstream of the y - junction  moving the interface up or down accordingly . </S>",
    "<S> we obtain the interface between two fluids by image processing ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3]b ) , and calculate the changes in the ratio of one flow by averaging the ratio of one flow across a narrow length shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3]b.c ) . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , we let the film relaxed for one second before switching to the next frequency test . </S>",
    "<S> this relaxation time is at least 3 orders of magnitudes longer than the time required for charging and discharging the micro actuator . ] </S>",
    "<S> the interaction between the thin film and the adjacent fluid has four major steps during one voltage cycle . </S>",
    "<S> the first one is an equilibrium state where the voltage is zero ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3]c - i ) . by increasing the voltage , the thin film buckles into the channel , causing a momentary increase in the flow of that channel as fluid above the film </S>",
    "<S> is displaced ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3]c - ii ) . </S>",
    "<S> next , the reduction in the pressure driven flow due to the buckled film s constriction of the active channel decreases the proportion of that fluid across the channel s width below the y - junction ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3]c - iii ) . </S>",
    "<S> finally , the voltage is reduced to zero and the film tends to go back to its original shape , bringing the flow downstream back to its original state . by repeating the voltage cycle </S>",
    "<S> , we observe the same interaction behavior , although the maximum change in flow becomes more consistent usually after the second cycle ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3]c ) .    </S>",
    "<S> when the microactuator buckles into the channel , the interface between two fluids adopts a shape with a peak that propagates through the channel while the amplitude attenuates ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig4]a ) . the latter phenomenon , which can be treated similar to the attenuation of surface waves within viscous fluids,@xcite suggests that the interface amplitude and its location can be obtained more accurately at the beginning of merging the two channels . </S>",
    "<S> the flow rate associated with each applied pressure can also be estimated by tracking the location of the amplitude as it attenuates along the channel . </S>",
    "<S> these average flow rates were 0.5 , 5.8 , and 8.4 mm / s , for applied pressures of 250 , 800 , and 1600 pa , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the fluid viscosity of solution in the main channel was @xmath25 ( vibro viscometer sv-10 ) and its density , measured by weighing 30 ml of fluid using an analytical balance ( sartorius practum 124 ) , was @xmath26 . knowing the channel s geometry ( @xmath27 ) , @xmath28 </S>",
    "<S> was then calculated ( @xmath29 0.03 , 0.36 , and 0.52 for @xmath30 , respectively ) .    </S>",
    "<S> we then applied the same voltage magnitude at higher frequencies ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig4]b ) and observed the microactuator s behavior at different frequencies and different applied pressures . </S>",
    "<S> the maximum amplitudes within each voltage cycle were obtained , averaged for a certain frequency , and plotted in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig4]c . </S>",
    "<S> when the applied pressure is relatively high , @xmath31 pa , increasing the actuation frequency slightly improves the maximum amplitude . </S>",
    "<S> when the flow rate is very low , higher actuation frequencies , however , reduce the maximum amplitude . </S>",
    "<S> this transition appears to occur as the frequency exceeds @xmath32 hz . </S>",
    "<S> we also note that the amplitude is much higher when the flow rate is slow , as the film deformation can disturb the yellow flow and consequently create a big wave along the channel .    an increase in the amplitude </S>",
    "<S> does not necessarily mean that the actuator undergoes higher postbuckling deformations . in order to estimate the film deformation </S>",
    "<S> , we calculate the area under the disturbed fluid interface within the persistence length of the altered fluid flow . </S>",
    "<S> since the fluids are miscible , we do not expect the interface between them to be vertical far downstream;@xcite however , this is a reasonable assumption near the y  junction  as the peclet number is also greater than 500 for all the experiments  which enables a coarse estimation of the fluid volume moved as a result of the film deformation ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig4]d ) . </S>",
    "<S> the results suggest that when the fluid flow is relatively high , the thin film undergoes more buckling as the actuation frequency increases . </S>",
    "<S> when the flow is low , however , the energetic cost for the thin film to move the fluid becomes higher than the cost of the film to buckle into higher , asymmetric modes.@xcite on the other hand , a regular flow over the thin film may help it to deform more , similar to the deformation of flexible tubes due to their inner flows.@xcite we note that the determination of the persistence length significantly affects the estimation of disturbed volume ; further investigation is therefore required to verify the trend for other cases , @xmath33 when @xmath34 .    </S>",
    "<S> based on the 3d patterns of deformation ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2]b ) , we assume that the thin film undergoes the first buckling mode when @xmath35 pa or @xmath36 pa . therefore , the amount of fluid moved by the film at its maximum deformation can be estimated from the volume of a spherical cap @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the plate radius , @xmath39 is the fluid volume and , @xmath40 is the maximum buckling deformation of the thin film . on the other hand </S>",
    "<S> , the fluid volume at the maximum amplitude within a time frame can also be estimated using a similar method to the one in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig4]d . </S>",
    "<S> for example , when the flow rate is about @xmath41 and @xmath42 , the maximum amplitude is about @xmath43 for higher frequencies ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig4]c ) , so the fluid volume within one frame is about @xmath44 . </S>",
    "<S> using the above equation , the maximum deformation of the thin film is about @xmath45 , which is reasonable compared to the channel height of 50 @xmath46 m .    </S>",
    "<S> these microactuators can work in series and parallel for further functionality , e.g. , bidirectional flows , or for more efficiently enhancing ( pumping ) or controlling ( valving ) different flows within microchannels . controlling the flow can significantly be improved by fabricating the main channel with a semicircular cross section.@xcite unlike other types of electrodes , electrical conductivity of fluid electrodes does not decrease by stretching the dielectric film , resulting in a consistent , large actuation . since we use highly conductive fluid electrodes , </S>",
    "<S> the majority of the voltage drop occurs within the thin film . </S>",
    "<S> however , if an experiment needs low conductive fluid electrodes or there are particles and cell sensitive to voltage application , a secondary channel coupled with the main channel would shield the fluid any applied voltage . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , the voltage applied to one actuator deforms into the secondary channel , which in turn causes the passive microactuator to partially close the main channel without any electricity involved .    </S>",
    "<S> we presented a new means to alter and control fluid flow using the buckling deformation of a microactuator that consists of a thin dielectric film actuated by conductive fluid electrodes . </S>",
    "<S> the fluid electrodes reduced the critical buckling voltage and significantly enhanced the rate of deformation . </S>",
    "<S> the buckling shape of the micro actuator was qualitatively obtained via tracking intensity changes within dyed fluids . </S>",
    "<S> we showed that the disturbed interface between two fluids can be used to characterize the interaction between the soft actuator and corresponding fluid , resulting in estimations of fluid flow and the film s deformation . </S>",
    "<S> the pressure difference between the main and control channels may affect the buckling shape , while the applied pressure and the pressure - driven flow may considerably alter the film s deformation . </S>",
    "<S> these microactuators may play a significant role in the development of microfluidics where either high amplitude or high speed alteration of the fluid s flow rate is desired . </S>"
