    "we study  6 pulsars ( j0631 + 1036 , j0659 + 1414 , j0742@xmath22822 , j1420@xmath26048 , j1509@xmath25850 , and j1718@xmath23825 ) detected by _ fermi _",
    "lat , all exhibiting single - peaked pulse profiles within current statistics at energies @xmath3  gev .",
    "these pulsars are also detected in the radio band . both of these properties aid in constraining the possible solution space for the respective pulsar geometries , as derived from predictions of their light curves ( lcs ) .",
    "a study of the pulsars geometric parameters , the inclination and observer angles @xmath4 and @xmath5 , has been performed  @xcite using the radio polarization and lc data .",
    "they constrained the solution space for @xmath4 and @xmath6 of 5 of the individual pulsars , with the impact angle @xmath7 , using fits to these radio data as well as predictions for the value of the half opening angle , @xmath8 , of the radio beam derived from the radio pulse width ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the aim of this study is to obtain similar constraints on @xmath4 and @xmath5 of the same pulsars using an independent , multiwavelength approach .",
    "we use a geometric pulsar emission code ( e.g. , @xcite ) to model the _ fermi _ lat and radio lcs , and fit the predicted radio and @xmath0-ray profiles to the data concurrently , thereby significantly constraining @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "this also allows us to test the consistency of the various approaches used to infer the pulsar geometry .",
    "we use an idealized picture of the pulsar system , wherein the magnetic field has a retarded dipole structure @xcite and the @xmath0-ray emission originates in regions of the magnetosphere ( referred to as ` gaps ' ) where the local charge density is sufficiently lower than the goldreich - julian charge density @xcite . these gaps facilitate particle acceleration and radiation .",
    "we assume that there are constant - emissivity emission layers embedded within the gaps in the pulsar s corotating frame .",
    "the location and geometry of these emission layers determine the shape of the @xmath0-ray lcs , and there exist multiple models for the geometry of the magnetosphere describing different possible gap configurations .",
    "we included two models for the @xmath0-ray emission regions in this study , namely the outer gap ( og ) and two - pole caustic ( tpc ) models . in both the og and tpc models ( the slot gap model @xcite may serve as physical basis for the latter ) , emission is produced by accelerated charged particles moving within narrow gaps along the last open magnetic field lines . in the og model @xcite , radiation originates above the null charge surface ( where the goldreich - julian charge density changes sign ) and _ interior to _ the last open magnetic field lines .",
    "the tpc gap starts at the stellar surface and extends _ along _ the last open field lines up to near the light cylinder,@xmath5)-contours between the two models .",
    "see section  [ sec : results ] .",
    "] , where the corotation speed approaches the speed of light  @xcite .",
    "the special relativistic effects of aberration and time - of - flight delays , which become important in regions far from the stellar surface ( especially near the light cylinder ) , together with the curvature of the magnetic field lines , cause the radiation to form caustics ( accumulated emission in narrow phase bands ) .",
    "these caustics are detected as peaks in the observed @xmath0-ray lc  @xcite .",
    "we used an empirical radio cone model  @xcite , where the beam diameter , width , and altitude are functions of the pulsar period @xmath9 , its time derivative @xmath10 , and the frequency of observation @xmath11 , in order to obtain predictions for the radio lcs .",
    "this is different from the approach taken by @xcite , as we have a different prescription for the radio emission altitude and @xmath8 , and we do not use the polarization data .",
    "using the above geometric models , we generated lcs as a function of @xmath4 and @xmath5 , keeping the gap widths and extents constant .",
    "due to the large size of the ( @xmath4,@xmath5)-space at a @xmath12 resolution , it is impractical to search blindly for the optimum lc by eye .",
    "we therefore started by generating a so - called atlas of lcs with a @xmath13 resolution for each pulsar and first identified candidate lc fits .",
    "we then performed refined searches in the regions of ( @xmath4,@xmath5)-space around those candidate fits at a @xmath14 and later @xmath12 resolution .",
    "this approach of generating all the lcs in a candidate region and comparing them directly , allowed us to obtain constraints on @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "we then inferred contours for @xmath4 and @xmath5 for each pulsar and for each geometric model .",
    "we lastly used these contours to find the corresponding values of @xmath1 ( with errors ; see section  [ sec : fom ] ) predicted by the og and tpc models .      to obtain an ( @xmath4,@xmath5)-contour delineating the region of plausible",
    "lc fits , we start at the candidate solution ( @xmath14 resolution ) and first move away from it in steps of @xmath12 in @xmath4 . at each step",
    "we then step through @xmath5 until the upper and lower bounds of the contour are located for the fixed @xmath4 .",
    "this procedure is repeated until no further acceptable lcs are found . as an example , the red regions * a * and * b * in the left panel of figure  [ fig : boundconts ] indicate the resulting contours obtained in this manner for psr j1509@xmath25850 for the tpc case .    _",

    "contour * b * yields a considerably better fit than contour  * a * , and thus we can ignore contour * a * in favour of contour * b * as indicated by the dotted line in figure  [ fig : boundconts ] .",
    "the values of @xmath4 and @xmath5 reported in are those at the centre of this dotted box , while the errors on these values are conservatively chosen to encompass the dimensions of the box . in this case",
    "the resulting values are @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "it is important to be able to convert the observed energy flux of a pulsar to its all - sky luminosity .",
    "the flux correction factor @xmath1 is used for this purpose .",
    "it is a highly model - dependent parameter , and allows us to determine what fraction of the all - sky luminosity we are observing from a pulsar if the geometry is known ( @xmath4 and @xmath5 ) , for a given model .",
    "it is also crucial in deriving the @xmath0-ray efficiency of a pulsar , and is defined as  @xcite @xmath17 with @xmath18 being the photon flux per solid angle ( ` intensity ' ) , and @xmath19 the earth line - of - sight . the value of @xmath1 is typically taken to be 1 , meaning that the observed energy flux is assumed to be equal to the average energy flux over the entire sky . due to the og model",
    "predicting emission over a relatively smaller region of phase space , its associated @xmath1 values are typically smaller than those of the tpc model for the same @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "( note , we assume that @xmath20 is approximately equal to the ratio of observed energy flux vs. total energy flux . )    we can now use the ( @xmath4,@xmath5)-contours obtained by the method discussed in section  [ sec : obcon ] to constrain the value of @xmath1 by computing @xmath21 and overplotting those contours ( see figure  [ fig : consonf ] ) .",

    "the _ red _ area indicates the best - fit @xmath22-contour for the radio and @xmath0-ray lcs . ]",
    "we infer values for @xmath4 and @xmath5 for each pulsar with typical errors of @xmath23 ( see ) .",
    "the tabulated values are the average values of @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and @xmath6 implied by the solution contours , while the errors are chosen conservatively so as to include the full ( non - rectangular ) contour .",
    "we note that once a solution is found at a particular @xmath4 and @xmath5 , it is worthwhile to study the lc at the position @xmath24 and @xmath25 ( i.e. , when the angles are interchanged ) . such a complementary solution may provide a good fit in some cases ( see the alternative solutions listed in ) , due to the symmetry of the model as well the symmetry in pulsar geometry ( i.e. , @xmath26 remaining constant under this transformation ) .    as mentioned in section  [ sec : model ] , we see a shift in best - fit contours , with the tpc model consistently yielding smaller @xmath4 and @xmath5 values compared to those obtained using the og model due to a different gap geometry . this is because similar phaseplots are obtained when a larger @xmath4 is chosen for the og model than for the tpc model .",
    "reproduction of the radio pulse shape then necessitates a larger value of @xmath5 for the og fit , since the contour is constrained to appear in one of the grey regions ( as determined by peak multiplicity ; see figure  [ fig : boundconts ] ) .",
    "the net effect of this is that the og contours are found farther from the origin at @xmath27 along the grey bands than the corresponding tpc contours .",

    "the good constraints on @xmath4 and @xmath5 , obtained using the method described above , emphasizes the merit of a multiwavelength approach .",
    "for example , the light grey regions in figure   [ fig : boundconts ] indicate single - peaked radio profile lc solutions . these would represent typical constraints one would be able to derive for @xmath4 and @xmath5 when considering only the radio profile shapes . similarly ,",
    "when only considering the ( single - peaked ) @xmath0-ray lcs , one would find relatively large ( @xmath4,@xmath5)-contours  @xcite .",
    "the requirement of fitting both the radio and @xmath0-ray profile shape , as well as their relative phase lag , results in much smaller contours , as shown in figure  [ fig : boundconts ] .    generally , our best - fit ( @xmath4,@xmath5 ) compare favourably with those inferred by @xcite for the first three pulsars ( see table  [ tab : results ] ) .",
    "however , comparison is hampered by uncertainties in estimating the half opening angle ,  @xmath8 , which sensitively influences the optimal solutions obtained by @xcite .",
    "even a small error of @xmath14 on  @xmath8 leads to relatively large errors on the allowed @xmath4 , so that our best fits would then be included in their inferred parameter ranges .",
    "direct comparison of our results with those of @xcite for psr j1420@xmath26048 and psr j1718@xmath23825 is not feasible due to different approaches for estimating the radio pulse width , @xmath92 .",
    "we only model the most prominent radio peak , while @xcite measures @xmath92 as the width of the total two - peaked profile .",
    "implementing a factor 2 difference in @xmath92 will change the @xmath8-contours and thus their best - fit solution considerably , improving the agreement between the two approaches .",
    "comparison with @xcite is not possible for psr j1509 - 5850 as the lack of polarization data inhibited inference of a best - fit ( @xmath4,@xmath6 ) by @xcite in this case .",
    "the next step for this kind of study is to apply a mathematically rigorous method of determining the best - fit lc solutions as a function of many free model parameters to the six pulsars modelled in this paper .",
