    "astrobiology is fundamentally concerned with whether extraterrestrial life exists and , if so , how abundant it is in the universe .",
    "the most direct and promising approach to answering these questions is surely empirical , the search for life on other bodies in the solar system @xcite and beyond in other planetary systems @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , a theoretical approach is possible in principle and could provide a useful complement to the more direct lines of investigation .    in particular , if we knew the probability per unit time and per unit volume of abiogenesis in a pre - biotic environment as a function of its physical and chemical conditions and if we could determine or estimate the prevalence of such environments in the universe , we could make a statistical estimate of the abundance of extraterrestrial life .",
    "this relatively straightforward approach is , of course , thwarted by our great ignorance regarding both inputs to the argument at present .    there does , however , appear to be one possible way of finessing our lack of detailed knowledge concerning both the process of abiogenesis and the occurrence of suitable pre - biotic environments ( whatever they might be ) in the universe .",
    "namely , we can try to use our knowledge that life arose at least once in an environment ( whatever it was ) on the early earth to try to infer something about the probability per unit time of abiogenesis on an earth - like planet without the need ( or ability ) to say how earth - like it need be or in what ways .",
    "we will hereinafter refer to this probability per unit time , which can also be considered a rate , as @xmath0 or simply the `` probability of abiogenesis . ''",
    "any inferences about the probability of life arising ( given the conditions present on the early earth ) must be informed by how long it took for the first living creatures to evolve . by definition",
    ", improbable events generally happen infrequently .",
    "it follows that the duration between events provides a metric ( however imperfect ) of the probability or rate of the events .",
    "the time - span between when earth achieved pre - biotic conditions suitable for abiogenesis plus generally habitable climatic conditions @xcite and when life first arose , therefore , seems to serve as a basis for estimating @xmath0 .",
    "revisiting and quantifying this analysis is the subject of this paper .",
    "we note several previous quantitative attempts to address this issue in the literature , of which one @xcite found , as we do , that early abiogenesis is consistent with life being rare , and the other @xcite found that earth s early abiogenesis points strongly to life being common on earth - like planets ( we compare our approach to the problem to that of @xcite below , including our significantly different results ) .",
    "furthermore , an argument of this general sort has been widely used in a qualitative and even intuitive way to conclude that @xmath0 is unlikely to be extremely small because it would then be surprising for abiogenesis to have occurred as quickly as it did on earth @xcite .",
    "indeed , the early emergence of life on earth is often taken as significant supporting evidence for  optimism \" about the existence of extra - terrestrial life ( _ i.e. _ , for the view that it is fairly common ) @xcite . the major motivation of this paper is to determine the quantitative validity of this inference .",
    "we emphasize that our goal is _ not _ to derive an optimum estimate of @xmath0 based on all of the many lines of available evidence , but simply to evaluate the implication of life s early emergence on earth for the value of @xmath0 .",
    "bayes s theorem @xcite can be written as @xmath1 = \\left({\\rm p}[\\mathcal{d } | \\mathcal{m } ] \\times { \\rm p}_{\\rm prior}[\\mathcal{m}]\\right)/{\\rm p}[\\mathcal{d}]$ ] . here ,",
    "we take @xmath2 to be a model and @xmath3 to be data . in order to use this equation to evaluate the posterior probability of abiogenesis",
    ", we must specify appropriate @xmath2 and @xmath3 .      in considering the development of life on a planet",
    ", we suggest that a reasonable , if simplistic , model is that it is a poisson process during a period of time from @xmath4 until @xmath5 . in this model ,",
    "the conditions on a young planet preclude the development of life for a time period of @xmath4 after its formation .",
    "furthermore , if the planet remains lifeless until @xmath6 has elapsed , it will remain lifeless thereafter as well because conditions no longer permit life to arise . for a planet around a solar - type star",
    ", @xmath5 is almost certainly @xmath710  gyr ( 10 billion years , the main sequence lifetime of the sun ) and could easily be a substantially shorter period of time if there is something about the conditions on a young planet that are necessary for abiogenesis . between these limiting times",
    ", we posit that there is a certain probability per unit time ( @xmath0 ) of life developing . for @xmath8 , then , the probability of life arising @xmath9 times in time @xmath10 is @xmath11 = { \\rm p}_{\\rm poisson}[\\lambda , n , t ] = e^{-\\lambda ( t - t_{\\rm min } ) } \\frac{\\ { \\lambda ( t - t_{\\rm min})\\}^n}{n ! } \\ , , \\label{eq : poisson}\\ ] ] where @xmath10 is the time since the formation of the planet .    this formulation",
    "could well be questioned on a number of grounds .",
    "perhaps most fundamentally , it treats abiogenesis as though it were a single instantaneous event and implicitly assumes that it can occur in only a single way ( _ i.e. _ , by only a single process or mechanism ) and only in one type of physical environment .",
    "it is , of course , far more plausible that abiogenesis is actually the result of a complex chain of events that take place over some substantial period of time and perhaps via different pathways and in different environments .",
    "however , knowledge of the actual origin of life on earth , to say nothing of other possible ways in which it might originate , is so limited that a more complex model is not yet justified .",
    "in essence , the simple poisson event model used in this paper attempts to `` integrate out '' all such details and treat abiogenesis as a `` black box '' process : certain chemical and physical conditions as input produce a certain probability of life emerging as an output .",
    "another issue is that @xmath0 , the probability per unit time , could itself be a function of time .",
    "in fact , the claim that life could not have arisen outside the window @xmath12 is tantamount to saying that @xmath13 for @xmath14 and for @xmath15 . instead of switching from 0 to a fixed value instantaneously",
    ", @xmath0 could exhibit a complicated variation with time .",
    "if so , however , @xmath16 $ ] is not represented by the poisson distribution and eq .",
    "( [ eq : poisson ] ) is not valid .",
    "unless a particular ( non top - hat - function ) time - variation of @xmath0 is suggested on theoretical grounds , it seems unwise to add such unconstrained complexity .",
    "a further criticism is that @xmath0 could be a function of @xmath9 : it could be that life arising once ( or more ) changes the probability per unit time of life arising again .",
    "since we are primarily interested in the probability of life arising _ at all _ ",
    "i.e. , the probability of @xmath17  we can define @xmath0 simply to be the value appropriate for a prebiotic planet ( whatever that value may be ) and remain agnostic as to whether it differs for @xmath18 .",
    "thus , within the adopted model , the probability of life arising is one minus the probability of it not arising : @xmath19 = 1 - e^{-\\lambda    ( t - t_{\\rm min } ) } \\ , .",
    "\\label{eq : plife}\\ ] ]      naively , the single datum informing our calculation of the posterior of @xmath0 appears to be simply that life arose on earth at least once , approximately 3.8 billion years ago ( give or take a few hundred million years ) .",
    "there is additional significant context for this datum , however .",
    "recall that the standard claim is that , since life arose early on the only habitable planet that we have examined for inhabitants , the probability of abiogenesis is probably high ( in our language , @xmath0 is probably large ) .",
    "this standard argument neglects a potentially important selection effect , namely : on earth , it took nearly 4  gyr for evolution to lead to organisms capable of pondering the probability of life elsewhere in the universe .",
    "if this is a necessary duration , then it would be impossible for us to find ourselves on , for example , a ( @xmath204.5-gyr old ) planet on which life first arose only after the passage of 3.5 billion years @xcite .",
    "on such planets there would not yet have been enough time for creatures capable of such contemplations to evolve . in other words , if evolution _ requires _ 3.5  gyr for life to evolve from the simplest forms to intelligent , questioning beings , then we _ had _ to find ourselves on a planet where life arose relatively early , regardless of the value of @xmath0 .",
    "in order to introduce this constraint into the calculation we define @xmath21 as the minimum amount of time required after the emergence of life for cosmologically curious creatures to evolve , @xmath22 as the age of the earth from when the earliest extant evidence of life remains ( though life might have actually emerged earlier ) , and @xmath23 as the current age of the earth .",
    "the data , then , are that life arose on earth at least once , approximately 3.8 billion years ago , _ and _ that this emergence was early enough that human beings had the opportunity subsequently to evolve and to wonder about their origins and the possibility of life elsewhere in the universe . in equation form , @xmath24 .",

    "if mars , for instance , and earth share a single @xmath0 and life arose arise on mars , then the likelihood of mars @xmath0 is the joint probability of our data on earth and of life arising on mars . assuming no panspermia in either direction , these events are independent : @xmath99 & = & \\left(1 - \\exp[-\\lambda ( t_{\\rm emerge}^{\\rm mars}-t_{\\rm min}^{\\rm mars})]\\right ) \\\\   & & \\times \\frac{1 - \\exp[-\\lambda ( t_{\\rm emerge}^{\\rm earth}-t_{\\rm min}^{\\rm earth})]}{1 - \\exp[-\\lambda ( t_{\\rm required}^{\\rm earth}-t_{\\rm min}^{\\rm earth } ) ] } \\ , .",

    "should future researchers find that life arose independently on mars ( or elsewhere ) , this would dramatically reduce the posterior probability of very low @xmath0 relative to our current inferences .",

    "within a few hundred million years , and perhaps far more quickly , of the time that earth became a hospitable location for life , it transitioned from being merely habitable to being inhabited .",
    "recent rapid progress in exoplanet science suggests that habitable worlds might be extremely common in our galaxy @xcite , which invites the question of how often life arises , given habitable conditions .",
    "although this question ultimately must be answered empirically , via searches for biomarkers @xcite or for signs of extraterrestrial technology @xcite , the early emergence of life on earth gives us some information about the probability that abiogenesis will result from early - earth - like conditions .",
    "a bayesian approach to estimating the probability of abiogenesis clarifies the relative influence of data and of our prior beliefs .",
    "although a `` best guess '' of the probability of abiogenesis suggests that life should be common in the galaxy if early - earth - like conditions are , still , the data are consistent ( under plausible priors ) with life being extremely rare , as shown in figure  3 .",
    "thus , a bayesian enthusiast of extraterrestrial life should be significantly encouraged by the rapid appearance of life on the early earth but can not be highly confident on that basis .",
    "our conclusion that the early emergence of life on earth is consistent with life being very rare in the universe for plausible priors is robust against two of the more fundamental simplifications in our formal analysis .",
    "first , we have assumed that there is a single value of @xmath0 that applies to all earth - like planets ( without specifying exactly what we mean by `` earth - like '' ) . if @xmath0 actually varies from planet to planet , as seems far more plausible",
    ", anthropic - like considerations imply planets with particularly large @xmath0 values will have a greater chance of producing ( intelligent ) life and of life appearing relatively rapidly , _",
    "i.e. _ , of the circumstances in which we find ourselves .",
    "thus , the information we derive about @xmath0 from the existence and early appearance of life on earth will tend to be biased towards large values and may not be representative of the value of @xmath0 for , say , an `` average '' terrestrial planet orbiting within the habitable zone of a main sequence star .",
    "second , our formulation of the problem analyzed in this paper implicitly assumes that there is no increase in the probability of intelligent life appearing once @xmath21 has elapsed following the abiogenesis event on a planet .",
    "a more reasonable model in which this probability continues to increase as additional time passes would have the same qualitative effect on the calculation as increasing @xmath21 .",
    "in other words , it would make the resulting posterior distribution of @xmath0 even less sensitive to the data and more highly dependent on the prior because it would make our presence on earth a selection bias favoring planets on which abiogenesis occurred quickly .",
    "we had to find ourselves on a planet that has life on it , but we did not have to find ourselves ( _ i _ ) in a galaxy that has life on a planet besides earth nor ( _ ii _ ) on a planet on which life arose multiple , independent times .",
    "learning that either ( _ i _ ) or ( _ ii _ ) describes our world would constitute data that are not subject to the selection effect described above . in short ,",
    "if we should find evidence of life that arose wholly idependently of us  either via astronomical searches that reveal life on another planet or via geological and biological studies that find evidence of life on earth with a different origin from us  we would have considerably stronger grounds to conclude that life is probably common in our galaxy . with this in mind , research in the fields of astrobiology and origin of life studies",
    "might , in the near future , help us to significantly refine our estimate of the probability ( per unit time , per earth - like planet ) of abiogenesis .",
