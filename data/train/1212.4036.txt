    "mesoscopic quantum systems evolving periodically and adiabatically in time provide an opportunity to study geometric effects , e.g. , the berry phase@xcite , in a dissipative environment .",
    "in particular , normal@xcite and superconducting@xcite charge pumping devices belong to this class of systems .",

    "the correct pumped charge one has to go beyond the rwa@xcite , i.e. include the fast rotating terms of the interaction picture master equation .",
    "the very simple reason for this is the fact that the tiny instantaneous value of the current is determined by the tiny off - diagonal elements of the density matrix dropped within rwa .    in this paper",
    "we employ an alternative formalism of fcs@xcite .",
    "this is achieved by including ( theoretically ) an ideal measuring apparatus in our description of the electrical circuit , i.e. , a capacitor with infinite capacitance .",
    "such a capacitor has zero impedance at all frequencies , i.e. , it does not disturb the circuit s dynamics .",
