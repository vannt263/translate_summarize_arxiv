    "the discoveries of many @xmath4 states in the heavy sector have made the study of hadrons enter a new stage  @xcite . because these hadrons are found near the threshold of two mesons , contribution from the molecular state of two mesons is considered to be important for the internal structure of the @xmath4 states .",
    "on the other hand , there are also other interpretations , such as the conventional quarkonia , tetra - quark states , gluon hybrids , and so on .",
    "it is therefore an urgent issue to reveal the internal structure of hadrons .    in general",
    ", the identification of the internal structure of hadrons is not straightforward , because the states with the same quantum numbers can mix with each other .",
    "a common approach is to construct a model with specific model space for the comparison with the experimental data .",
    "however , the contribution from the degrees of freedom which are not considered in the model can in principle be included in the model parameters .",
    "the connection between the model space and the described hadron is therefore indistinct .",
    "it is desirable to study the internal structure of hadrons directly from experimental observables without using specific models .",
    "it is shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that the compositeness of a weakly binding state is determined only from the experimental observables in a model independent manner . defining the compositeness @xmath5 as a probability to find the composite state in the physical bound state , we obtain the following weak - binding relation between the scattering length @xmath6 and the binding energy @xmath7",
    "; @xmath8 here @xmath9 is the reduced mass and @xmath10 is the length scale related to the binding energy @xmath7 .",
    "@xmath11 is the typical length scale of the interaction of this system .",
    "this relation tells us that the scattering length @xmath6 is determined by the binding energy @xmath7 and the compositeness @xmath5 when the binding energy is small enough to satisfy @xmath12 . in other words ,",
    "the compositeness of the weakly binding state can be calculated from the observables without using models .",
    "this relation is used to show that the deuteron is a proton - neutron composite system .",
    "because this relation is valid only for the stable states , it can not be applied to unstable hadrons with decay modes .",
    "there are several attempts to study the compositeness of the unstable states  @xcite . here",
    "we present the generalization of the weak binding relation  ( [ eq : comp - rel - bound ] ) using the effective field theory ( eft )  @xcite .",
    "we first consider the single - channel @xmath13-wave scattering with a shallow bound state .",
    "our interest is focused on the low energy physics near the threshold .",
    "we analyze this system with the effective non - relativistic quantum field theory with contact interactions  @xcite @xmath14 , \\\\ h_{\\mathrm{int } } & = & \\int d\\bm{r } \\left [ g_{0 } \\left ( b_0^\\dagger \\phi\\psi + \\psi^\\dagger\\phi^\\dagger b_0 \\right ) + \\lambda_0 \\psi^\\dagger\\phi^\\dagger \\phi\\psi \\right].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here we take @xmath15 .",
    "we consider that this eft is applicable below the cutoff momentum scale @xmath16 .",
    "the cutoff scale is related to the typical length scale of the interaction @xmath11 as @xmath17 .",
    "now we consider that the full hamiltonian has a discrete eigenstate @xmath18 with the binding energy @xmath7 in the same quantum numbers with the two - body @xmath19 system as @xmath20 from the phase symmetry of the hamiltonian , it can be shown that the completeness relation in this sector is spanned by the eigenstates of @xmath21 : the scattering states @xmath22 and the discrete state @xmath23 with the creation operators @xmath24 , the vacuum @xmath25 , and @xmath26 .",
    "this enables us to write the bound state @xmath18 as a linear combination of these states , @xmath27 now we define the compositeness @xmath5 ( the elementariness @xmath28 ) as the probability to find the scattering ( discrete ) state in the bound state ; @xmath29 with the normalization condition of the bound state @xmath30 , @xmath28 and @xmath5 are shown to satisfy the following relations : @xmath31 .",

    "we then expand the scattering length @xmath44 in powers of @xmath45 . using eq .",
    "( [ eq : x - bound ] ) and the bound state condition  ( [ eq : pole - cond ] ) , we find that the coefficient of the leading order term @xmath46 is expressed only by the compositeness @xmath5 .",
    "this verifies the weak - binding relation  ( [ eq : comp - rel - bound ] ) .",
    "the higher order terms are suppressed by @xmath47 compared with the leading order term and depends explicitly on the cutoff @xmath16 .",
    "the details of the short range behavior of the interaction is reflected in the higher order terms .",
    "thus , when the binding energy is sufficiently small and the higher order terms can be neglected , the compositeness @xmath5 is determined only from the observable quantities , the scattering length @xmath48 and the binding energy @xmath7 .",
    "we have to notice that the compositeness @xmath5 is a model - dependent quantity , when the binding energy is not small .",
    "it is shown that the compositeness @xmath5 in expression  ( [ eq : x - bound ] ) is not invariant under the change of the cutoff scale @xmath49  @xcite .",
    "the weak - binding limit is the exceptional case where the model dependence of @xmath5 is suppressed in the expansion of eq .",
    "( [ eq : comp - rel - bound ] ) , and the structure of the bound state can be determined from the observables .",
    "to generalize the weak - binding relation to the unstable quasi - bound states , we add an additional two - body channel to the previous system .",

    "the wave function of an unstable state diverges at large distance and can not be normalized . to normalize the unstable state , we introduce the gamow state @xmath61 . with the analytic continuation using the convergence factor , one can show that the normalization condition @xmath62 is well defined . the definition of @xmath5 and @xmath28 is then given by @xmath63 which satisfy @xmath64",
    "the complex nature of @xmath65 and @xmath28 reflects the fact that the expectation value of an arbitrary operator for the unstable state becomes complex . nevertheless , the sum rule  ( [ eq : sum - rule - quasi ] ) is guaranteed owing to the normalization of @xmath56 .",

    "the first two terms arise in the same manner with the bound state case .",
    "the last term originates in the expansion of the @xmath75 , which contains the additional length scale @xmath76 .",
    "when the energy difference between the thresholds @xmath77 is large , the length scale @xmath76 is small . to determine the compositeness @xmath5 model independently , in addition to the condition @xmath78 , the eigenenergy should satisfy @xmath79 .",
    "the latter condition is met when the decay channel 2 is sufficiently separated from the channel 1 with respect to the magnitude of the eigenenergy .",
    "it is clear from the derivation that the relation  ( [ eq : comp - rel - quasi ] ) holds also for the states with re @xmath80 .",

    "we rewrite @xmath69 as @xmath5 and @xmath84 as @xmath28 .",
    "the sum rule is then given by @xmath85 and @xmath28 represents any contributions other than the channel 1 .",
    "from the definition  ( [ eq : x - def - quasi ] ) , the compositeness of the quasi - bound state is obtained as a complex number , which can not be directly interpreted as a probability .",

    "however , re @xmath5 can be negative or larger than one .",
    "here we introduce two real quantities , @xmath87 and @xmath88 , which are to be regarded as probabilities to find the composite component and the other components in the physical quasi - bound state , respectively . for the meaningful probabilistic interpretation",
    ", the following conditions should be satisfied : @xmath89 .",

    "if the imaginary part of @xmath5 or the magnitude of the real part is very large , there is no corresponding bound state wave function . in such cases",
    ", the compositeness @xmath5 should not be regarded as the measure of the internal structure . to quantify the clarity of the interpretation",
    ", we introduce another real quantity @xmath90 , such that @xmath91 increases when the interpretation is unclear . based on these considerations",
