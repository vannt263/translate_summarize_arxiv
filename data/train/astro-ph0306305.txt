    "the observations by the wmap satellite @xcite have brought the global cosmological data set up to a quality where , for the first time , it is possible to obtain precision constraints on cosmological models . that the data provides no indication of any significant departure from gaussianity , adiabaticity , or scale - invariance , and furthermore reveals two coherent peaks in the spectrum of cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) anisotropies , lends powerful support to the idea of inflation in the early universe as a source for the observed perturbations",

    "there is a mild preference for a red spectral index ( @xmath40 ) but not with any significance . because of the tight correlation between @xmath7 and @xmath8 there exists a class of models with blue scalar spectra which show a mild preference for a tensor component on large scales , as is visible in fig  [ fig : nsr ]",
    "this is an area of parameter space which has not been significantly populated with models , as models with blue spectra tend to have negligible tensors .",

    "[ fig : e1e2 ] , and in this section we examine the constraints on power - law inflation .",

    "if in the near future the hz spectrum is ruled out in favor of red - tilted spectrum then we can begin to place an upper limit on the index @xmath46 , and needless to say , power - law inflation can be ruled out altogether if a blue - tilted spectrum is favored or if the tensor spectrum has the wrong relationship with the scalar spectrum .",
    "an easy way to overinterpret the data would be to point out that our best - fit models lie close to the region well described by power - law inflation ( ie .",
    "the @xmath7 axis ) , with inflationary parameters @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "however this is likely to be a result of the mild preference for red scalar spectra combined with a small slide along the ( flattish ) tensor degeneracy direction once tensors are included in the fit .",

    "we find the monomial inflation index is constrained from above to be @xmath79 thus , while it is still too early to definitively rule out the @xmath77 inflation model , it is clear from the pattern of the above constraints that this particular model is under very strong pressure from observations .",

    "it is clear from fig .",
    "[ fig : e1e2_zoom ] that the same kind of pressure will build on the @xmath83 model if the spectral index becomes more tightly constrained , since lines of constant spectral index correspond to @xmath84 , which , modulo the tensor degeneracy , runs parallel to the constraint contours .",
    "it is natural to ask what can we say in a model - independent manner about slow - roll inflation models while still including the bound on @xmath61 . the number of @xmath55-folds of inflation , given by eq .",

    "( [ eq : alphas ] ) , would contain useful additional information about the model of inflation , assuming inflation occurs at these high energies .",
    "since we have found no constraint on @xmath39 , then it is clear that we can not make this type of model independent analysis at present .",
    "note also that the bound @xmath87 can be relaxed somewhat to @xmath88 if @xmath89 is significantly reduced in the late stages of inflation @xcite . in terms of the slow - roll parameters @xmath90 for instance , this correction is relevant for the @xmath6 which has @xmath91 , although this is certainly not enough to take much pressure off this model .",
    "we have discounted the inclusion of @xmath39 because the data are unable to distinguish it from zero . however , following the logic of that statement we are forced to conclude that neither @xmath7 nor @xmath8 have been shown to be inconsistent with zero .",

    "1d posterior constraints for the basic cosmological parameters .",
    "the dotted line corresponds to the harrison - zeldovich model and the full line corresponds to inflationary models ( as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : cos_params1]).,title=\"fig : \" ] +    it is plausible therefore to also regard @xmath7 and @xmath8 as giving poor value , in terms of the improvement to the fit they give , for their inclusion as extra parameters .",
    "it is therefore interesting to see how constraints tighten up if we assume an hz spectrum in place of slow - roll inflation . in fig .",
    "[ fig : cos_params ] we display once more the constraints on the basic cosmological parameters , but now also showing the constraints assuming the hz spectrum and no tensors .",
    "it is clear that , broadly speaking , the two models are in good agreement with each other , but nevertheless there are quantitative differences worth remarking upon . the baryon density @xmath92 becomes much more tightly constrained , and looks rather high when compared to nucleosynthesis constraints .",
    "perhaps most interestingly , assuming hz the constraints on the reionization epoch tighten considerably in favour of early reionization , as in abandoning slow - roll we have lost the ability to use tilt and tensors to partially mimic the effects of reionization .",
    "as long as the hz model remains a good fit to the data then the issue of introducing the spectral index as a parameter , let alone the running of the spectral index , needs some consideration .",
    "reconstructing the initial power spectrum in bands @xcite indicates that it is adequately fit by a scale - invariant spectrum , and that there should be nothing to be gained by adding any further power spectrum parameters .",
    "indeed , why do we include further power spectrum parameters at all ? if we consider the power spectrum as a taylor expansion @xmath93 then the primary reason for including higher power spectrum parameters is to the test the _ convergence _ of the observable , in this case @xmath94 , as described at lower - order .",
    "the first term in the series has been determined to be @xmath95 .",
    "we can introduce the next order parameter , the spectral index , without disrupting the constraints on the other parameters , and moreover feel confident of our measurement of @xmath96 , provided @xmath97 the above criterion is indeed satisfied by all the models under consideration since @xmath98 and @xmath99 .",
    "thus the determination of the amplitude of scalar perturbations to a reasonable accuracy is not questioned by anybody .",
    "similarly , one can feel confident in a measurement of @xmath28 if the criterion @xmath100 is satisfied , and the fact that this inequality is typically violated for many of the strong running models under consideration in the literature ( _ eg . _",
    "the best fit of ref .",
    "@xcite is @xmath101 , @xmath102 and the two terms are of the same order of magnitude ) has two possible explanations .",
    "the first is the intriguing possibility that the third term in the taylor expansion eq .",
    "( [ eq : taylor ] ) dominates over the second term at around a scale of @xmath103 , physically corresponding to a power spectrum with a maximum near @xmath53 .",
    "this can only be verified if the contribution to the power spectrum from the _ fourth _ term ( the running of the running ) is found to be less than the term due to the running itself at this scale .",
    "the second , and more likely , explanation is that the large allowed variation in the running of the spectral index is just a symptom of the fact that we havent convincingly determined the spectral index yet .",
    "we suggest that this criterion can be easily used as a check in the fitting procedure : if eq .",
    "( [ eq : convcrit ] ) is violated for most models and the running is detected only at low significance , then the simplest interpretation is that no useful information is coming from the inclusion of the new parameter in the fit .",
    "one should at least be aware of a lack of convergence in the power spectrum observable , eq .",
    "( [ eq : taylor ] ) .",

    "( [ eq : convcrit ] ) as setting the boundary between weak and strong running in an observational sense . for current observations",
    "weak running is given by models with @xmath104 , and this can be useful one wishes to introduce a weak running prior into the fitting procedure as a perturbation analysis to the existing constraints .    this type of convergence criterion should find echoes in other areas of cosmology where an observable is in some way series expanded , for instance the dark energy equation of state @xmath105 @xcite .    before concluding , we bring together the cosmological parameters of various inflationary models in table  [ table1 ] .",
