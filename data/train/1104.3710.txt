    "the energy spectrum of cosmic rays ( cr ) follows a simple power law @xmath2 .",
    "the observation of the change of the spectral index @xmath0 at energy of few pev ( the so - called the knee @xcite ) has induced considerable interest . nevertheless , despite of about 50 years of experimental and theoretical activities , the origin of the knee phenomenon has not yet been convincingly explained .",
    "theoretical models explaining the knee can be divided on two categories .",
    "the first is based on astrophysical reasons , i.e. the knee is a property of energy spectrum .",
    "second class considers new particle physics processes in the atmosphere .",
    "first category is developed more intensively .",
    "different authors explain the knee as result of an acceleration process @xcite , propagation of cosmic ray particles through the galaxy @xcite , interaction of cosmic rays with background particles in the galaxy @xcite .",
    "the most of authors predict detailed spectra of cr elemental groups .",
    "thus for a solution of the knee problem an accurate measurements of the energy spectra of individual cosmic ray elements ( or elemental groups , at least ) are necessary",
    ".    unfortunately , above 1 pev cosmic rays are experimentally accessible in ground - based installation only",
    ". considerable fluctuations of showers in the atmosphere complicate the task of energy and mass reconstruction",
    ". a solution of the problem can be found by using correlation approaches and methods , which allow to reduce the influence on intrinsic fluctuations at shower development for the reconstruction of energy and mass of primary cosmic rays @xcite-@xcite .",
    "one of the most interesting recent results ( from two - dimensional @xmath3-analysis of kascade data ) in knee region is a break ( a significant increase ) of the slope of heavy elements spectrum at energy of few pev @xcite- @xcite .",
    "these results are presented in fig.1 . at that",
    ", it should notice that spectra of elemental groups in fig.1left ( qgsjet model ) and in fig.1right ( sibyll model ) are different .",
    "therefore , a behavior of these spectra can be discussed only ( at least , in present stage ) .    nevertheless , the increasing @xmath0 is important criterion for the most of theoretical models explaining the knee .",
    "many of these models ( see reviews @xcite-@xcite ) predict unchangeable energy spectra of elemental groups with @xmath0 from @xmath4 to @xmath5 at different assumptions .",
    "such value of @xmath0 must be kept before defined energy ( cut off energy of accelerated particles ) .",

    "supernova ( sn ) explosion marks the end of the life of some stars .",
