    "the study of non - equilibrium systems has countless applications in many areas , including physics , biology , chemistry , and economics . as discussed in a recent review of non - equilibrium statistical mechanics @xcite ,",
    "the formulation of a universal description of non - equilibrium systems , analogous to the gibbs framework for equilibium systems , has been widely acknowledged as an important goal .",
    "simple models , like the kinetic ising model , provide us with important tools to build intuition and to provide test cases for more general treatments .",
    "studies of such simple systems , reviewed in @xcite , have greatly contributed to our understanding of non - equilibrium phenomena .",
    "one - dimensional models are particularly interesting as they are often amenable to analytic methods .",
    "moreover , low - dimensional models can be easily simulated on a computer , providing us with another tool for exploring non - equilibrium systems .",
    "finally , kinetic ising models are particularly useful as they can be mapped to models of other dynamics ( e.g. , of particles and surfaces ) and can therefore characterize a broad class of non - equilibrium phenomena with possible experimental realizations @xcite",
    ".    we will be interested in ising models driven out of equilibrium via couplings to heat baths with different temperatures .",
    "these heat baths set up temperature gradients which induce macroscopic energy fluxes in the system .",
    "given the simplicity of the ising model , it is sometimes possible to choose couplings such that analytic results for the energy fluxes @xcite , steady - state correlation functions , corrections to the boltzmann distribution @xcite , and even the full time - dependent behavior @xcite of the system are available . in most previous studies of this kind ,",
    "the systems have a translational symmetry ( see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "for example , a well - studied ising chain model has alternating spins coupled to two heat baths with different temperatures .",
    "infinite range models with multiple temperatures have also been considered where all of the spins interact @xcite .",
    "finally , there have been studies ( see @xcite ) of quantum spin chains where an energy flux is induced directly by an applied field .    an arguably more realistic way to drive an ising spin chain out of equilibrium",
    "is by linking together the ends of two sub - chains , each held at a different temperature .",
    "this breaks the translational invariance of the system and leads to nontrivial spatial profiles for quantities such as the energy flux .",
    "such a localized jump in temperature is found in many systems , such as at the interface between the air and a space heater . in the context of kinetic ising models ,",
    "a possible experimental realization was suggested by schmser and schmittmann @xcite : nuclei in a crystalline solid can be prepared at a particular spin temperature .",
    "two adjacent domains of nuclei at different spin temperatures might be a way to realize the kind of system considered here . also , some exact analytic results are already available for such systems in one dimension ( see @xcite and discussion in @xcite ) where one spin injects energy into an ising chain via random flipping . in two dimensions , models using kawasaki dynamics ( where neighboring spin states are exchanged )",
    "reveal more interesting features of such driven systems , such as convection cells @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we find exact results for a one - dimensional model where a localized temperature gradient establishes energy fluxes through the system with interesting spatial properties .    in a recent paper @xcite ,",
    "the author and zia presented exact results for an infinite kinetic ising chain with its left half coupled to a hot heat bath and the its right half coupled to a colder bath .",
    "a sharp temperature gradient is established at the junction between the two halves , driving the system far from equilibrium . in this paper",
    ", we will give a complete account of the brief analysis presented in @xcite .",
    "we calculate the exact expressions for the steady - state two - spin correlation functions and use them to compute the flux of energy @xmath3 between a spin at integer location @xmath4 and its associated heat bath .",
    "intuitively , @xmath3 describes how energy flows from the hot to cold bath due to the temperature gradient .",
    "we discuss both the case where the two baths are at arbitrary temperatures and the limit in which the hot bath approaches an infinite temperature . in the latter limit",
    ", we find excellent approximations to the asymptotic behavior of @xmath3 for spins in the cold bath that are far from the junction .    in section  [ sec : setup ]",
    "we establish our notation and the microscopic details of the model . in section  [ sec : arbtemp ] we express the energy fluxes @xmath3 in terms of the two - point correlation functions , which we calculate for arbitrary temperatures for the hot and cold baths .",
    "as these expressions are rather unwieldy , in section  [ sec : inftemp ] we calculate @xmath3 exactly for the case where the hot bath temperatures goes to infinity . for large @xmath4 , we find that @xmath3 decays exponentially with @xmath4 for cold bath temperatures @xmath9 . as @xmath8 , @xmath3 decays as a power law , with @xmath10 .",
    "we find excellent approximations for @xmath3 capturing both of these large @xmath4 behaviors in section  [ sec : asymp ] .",
    "all of the exact and approximate results for the infinitely hot heat bath limit are affirmed by monte carlo simulations in section  [ sec : simul ] .",
    "we also use the simulations to explore the behavior of @xmath3 for arbitrary hot and cold bath temperatures .",
    "we present possible outlooks for future studies and make concluding remarks in section  [ sec : final ] .",
    "we consider a kinetic ising chain in one dimension with @xmath11 spins . for consistency , our notation will be very similar to the notation used in the previous paper @xcite .",
    "the variables @xmath12 will denote the two possible values of the spin at site @xmath13 .",
    "although there are many ways to interpret the two values , here we will use the language of magnetic spins so that the values @xmath14 will denote a spin pointing up or down , respectively .",
    "we begin our analysis by defining a hamiltonian @xmath15 for each configuration of ising spins . for the case of a chain with nearest - neighbor interactions with a ferromagnetic constant coupling constant @xmath16 ,",
    "the hamiltonian is @xmath17 where we sum over all nearest neighbor pairs @xmath18 in the chain . for a chain at equilibrium with a single heat bath at temperature @xmath19",
    ", we can compute a canonical distribution function over spin configurations : @xmath20 , where @xmath21 , and @xmath22 is the normalization factor or partition function .",
    "we will be interested in driving our system out of equilibrium by coupling the spins to heat baths of different temperatures .",
    "unlike the equilibrium case , we have to specify the particular coupling between the heat baths and the spins . the standard way to do this",
    "is to have the spins transition from one configuration @xmath23 to another @xmath24 with probability rates @xmath25 . in the equilibrium case , where all the spins are coupled to one temperature",
    ", these rates are chosen to satisfy the detailed balance condition @xmath26 . in the spirit of the corresponding equilibrium studies ,",
    "we choose the simple glauber spin - flip dynamics , originally formulated for the equilibrium case @xcite . in these dynamics , the two configurations @xmath23 and @xmath27 differ by a single spin flip .",
    "the rates @xmath28 for flipping the spins will depend on the temperature of the bath to which the chain is coupled .",
    "we will generalize these glauber rates to include a location - dependent heat bath temperature @xmath29 ( with its inverse @xmath30 ) .",
    "then , we consider the probability rates @xmath31 of flipping a spin at location @xmath4 ( with @xmath32 ) given by @xmath33 , \\label{eq : merates}\\ ] ] where @xmath34 $ ] and @xmath35^{-1}$ ] , where @xmath29 is the temperature of the heat bath coupled to spin @xmath4 .",
    "the time step @xmath36 sets the time scale at which the spin flipping occurs . for simplicity",
    ", we will choose this scale so that @xmath37 . since @xmath16 ( so @xmath38 ) , if the spin at @xmath4 is anti - aligned with its neighbors , then the flipping rate is proportional to @xmath39 and to @xmath40 if it is aligned .",
    "thus , as expected for a ferromagnet , the spins tend to align as @xmath41 increases ( i.e. , temperature decreases ) .",
    "we now have to specify what to do at the chain boundaries at @xmath42 .",
    "one choice is to set @xmath43 and employ periodic boundary conditions with the same flipping rate as in equation ( [ eq : merates ] ) .",
    "another choice is to allow for open boundary conditions in which the boundary spin flipping rates are chosen to satisfy the detailed balance condition in the equilibrium case , yielding @xmath44/(2 \\delta t ) $ ] , where @xmath45 $ ] @xcite . in the following",
    ", we will mostly ignore these boundary conditions as we are interested in the behavior of the system as @xmath46 where we assume the effects of the boundaries will be negligible . in a completely rigourous treatment , this assumption needs to be checked . in this paper",
    "we will check this by comparing our analytic results with simulations , which will use the open boundary conditions described above . finally , we will set @xmath47 so that all of our energies will be given in units of @xmath48 .",
    "when @xmath30 is not a constant , the spins can no longer achieve thermal equilibrium as the heat baths at each spin @xmath4 will compete with each other to create a temperature gradient , establishing thermal energy fluxes in the system which persist in the steady - state . in this case , the detailed balance condition is broken and our steady state distribution ( which we assume the system goes into as @xmath49 is governed by the time - independent probability distribution @xmath50 which is different from the equilibrium distribution @xmath51 . the standard technique to deal with this kind of system is to analyze the master equation for the probability distribution @xmath52 of observing a configuration @xmath53 of spins at time @xmath54 . for the non - equilibrium glauber dynamics we consider ,",
    "it is given by @xmath55 ,   \\label{eq : mequation}\\ ] ] where the total number of spins is @xmath56 and @xmath57 is identical to @xmath23 , with the exception of a single flip of the @xmath58-th spin .",
    "the two terms in the summation in equation ( [ eq : mequation ] ) represent the change in @xmath59 due to transitions into and out of the configuration @xmath23 via spin flipping at spin @xmath58 at rate @xmath60 . in this paper",
    ", we will be interested in the steady - state solution @xmath61 of equation ( [ eq : mequation ] ) , for which the left - hand side is equal to zero .    to fully specify our model",
    ", we now consider a localized `` junction '' at spin @xmath62 between two ising chains at different temperatures , as illustrated in figure [ fig : setup ] . the left chain s heat bath will be set to a temperature @xmath63 for @xmath64 , while the right bath will be set to @xmath65 for @xmath66 , such that @xmath67 .",
    "we define corresponding @xmath68 parameters which will satisfy @xmath69 and @xmath70 .",
    "a schematic of two adjacent kinetic ising spin chains coupled to heat baths at different temperatures @xmath0 and @xmath1 , with @xmath67 .",
    "the red arrows show the flow of heat @xmath3 between the heat baths and the chains .",
    "heat flows across the junction from the hot bath and into the cold one . as @xmath71 increases",
    ", the heat flow will decrease as the spins approach equilibrium with their respective heat baths away from the junction .",
    "this is illustrated by the decreasing size of the red arrows .",
    "we expect that the heat flux decays faster in the hot bath , as discussed in the main text ( see section [ sec : simul]).,width=480 ]    intuitively , we expect the temperature gradient to induce a flow of heat from the hot bath into the cold bath .",
    "the most dramatic non - equilibrium behavior will occur at the junction between the chains at location @xmath62 .",
    "far away from this junction , i.e. for @xmath72 in the thermodynamic limit ( @xmath46 ) , we expect that the chains are at equilibrium with their respective baths and the heat flow decays to zero .",
    "an illustration of the model and the expected qualitative behavior are given in figure  [ fig : setup ] .",
    "our objective now is to compute how this energy flux @xmath3 decays away from the junction as a function of the spin location @xmath4 in the stationary state characterized by @xmath73 .",
    "in order to find the net energy flux @xmath3 at each spin , we recognize that all contributions to @xmath3 will come from spin flips at spin @xmath4 .",
    "then , given our hamiltonian in ( [ eq : hamiltonian ] ) , we see that the energy change @xmath74 _ gained _ by the heat bath ( or _ lost _ by the chain ) due to a single spin flip at location @xmath4 is given in units of @xmath48 as @xmath75 where @xmath76 is the value of the spin at @xmath4 _ before _ the flip .",

    "therefore , we can perform our simulation in this limit on just the @xmath192 spins coupled to the cold bath and the single infinitely hot spin at @xmath62 .     a log - log plot of time time dependence of both the mean @xmath362 and the variance @xmath363 for @xmath364 and @xmath365 .",
    "the blue lines show a fit of the data to a linear function and indicate that both the mean and variance grow linearly at large @xmath54 .",
    "the @xmath153-intercepts of the lines on the log - log plot can be used to estimate the slope @xmath366 of the fit and , thus , @xmath367 and @xmath368 , as in ( [ eq : simslopedef]).,width=384 ]    to record the flux @xmath3 at each spin , we have to keep track of the spin flips at each spin as each can contribute a change in energy of @xmath369 , depending on whether the spin is aligned or anti - aligned with its neighbors .",
    "we compute the average change in energy @xmath362 over about @xmath370 independent simulation runs after @xmath371 monte carlo updates at each spin ( for @xmath372 ) .",
    "we tested values of @xmath41 between @xmath373 and @xmath374 .",
    "for the smaller values of @xmath41 , the sharp exponential decay of @xmath3 required more simulation runs ( up to @xmath375 ) to get good statistics at large values of @xmath4",
    ". we can think about these monte carlo updates at each spin as inducing a random walk in the variable @xmath376 , with `` step size '' @xmath377 .    in an equilibrium case",
    ", we expect that the average @xmath362 is zero , as we have no net flux @xmath3",
    ". however , in our case , the presence of the infinite temperature spin at @xmath62 induces a _ bias _ in the @xmath376 dynamics .",
    "the non - zero value of @xmath3 induces a uniform drift and , thus , @xmath362 is non - zero and grows linearly in time after the system achieves a steady - state at long times @xmath54 , as shown in the log - log plot in figure [ fig : erandomwalk ] .",
    "notice that the data points for @xmath378 versus @xmath54 fall perfectly on a line with unity slope on a log - log plot for large @xmath54 , implying linear growth .",
    "we also see in the figure that the variance , @xmath379 , also increases linearly in @xmath54 , just as we would expect for a random walk . in summary , we use these simulation results to estimate the two slopes @xmath380 and @xmath381 , where @xmath382 as illustrated by ( [ eq : generaleflux ] ) , the rate of increase of @xmath362 in the steady - state of the system is equal to the energy flux @xmath3 . thus , our flux @xmath3 is estimated by @xmath383 .",
    "we can also approximate an error in this estimate by utilizing properties of the random walk .",
    "the standard error of the mean @xmath362 is given by @xmath384 where @xmath385 is the number of runs over which we average .",
    "then , given the definition of @xmath381 in ( [ eq : simslopedef ] ) , we see from ( [ eq : stderror ] ) that an estimate of the error @xmath386 in @xmath383 is given by @xmath387 where @xmath54 will be the number of time steps used to determine our slopes @xmath381 and @xmath380",
    ".    an easy initial check of our simulation is to plot the flux at the zeroth spin @xmath167 versus the cold bath parameter @xmath41 .",
    "we already argued in ( [ eq : fluxat0 ] ) that we have the exact solution @xmath388 in units of @xmath48 .",
    "we see in figure [ fig : zeroflux ] that the simulation results agree perfectly with this exact result for a wide range of @xmath41 .",
    "notice that as the cold bath temperature @xmath300 , we have @xmath320 and the flux increases in magnitude .",
    "this makes sense as we increase the temperature gradient between the chains as we decrease @xmath19 , forcing more energy through the junction between the chains .     a plot of the flux @xmath167 at spin location @xmath111 .",

    "in ( b ) , we look at larger values of @xmath4 and show the result of the simulations ( black squares ) , the exact solution ( red disks ) , and also the bessel function approximation ( coloured lines ) we derived in ( [ eq : besselkexpand ] )",

    "the results are shown in figure [ fig : totalfluxcomp](a ) .",
    "the simulations again agree perfectly with the exact result for the fluxes @xmath3 for all tested values of @xmath4 and @xmath41 .",
    "notice that for small values of @xmath41 and large values of @xmath4 , the magnitude of @xmath3 is quite small and indistinguishable from zero in the simulations .",
    "thus , for these points we just show the numerically integrated exact result .",
    "figure [ fig : totalfluxcomp](b ) also includes approximation ( [ eq : besselkexpand ] ) .",
    "notice that the approximation agrees remarkably well with the simulation and exact result for small values of @xmath4 and captures the cross - over between the exponential and power - law decay of @xmath3 as @xmath320 .",
    "the plot markers are simulation results for @xmath390 for three separate chain simulations with different pairs of values for @xmath391 .",
    "the different marker styles are associated with different sets of coloured line segments , with colours representing the @xmath391 pairs shown in the plot legend .",
    "the solid line segments are best fits of the data in each bath for each simulated chain to the function @xmath392 , where @xmath393 is our fitting parameter and @xmath394 is given by ( [ eq : corrlength ] ) with @xmath395 .",
    "for spins with @xmath396 , we increment @xmath4 by 1 in the fitting function order to avoid the logarithmic singularity at @xmath62 . the dashed magenta line simply connects the @xmath397 points as we do not have a conjectured fit function for this data .",
    ", width=384 ]    finally , simulations can be used as a tool to better understand the behavior of the model for arbitrary values of the bath temperatures @xmath0 and @xmath1 and to point us toward possible analytic solutions .",
    "for example , we can check to see if the asymptotics we found in ( [ eq : flaplaceexpand ] ) for @xmath398 and @xmath5 describe the flux decay when the hot bath is at a finite temperature . in figure [ fig:2temp ] ,",
    "we fit simulation results for @xmath390 to the function @xmath399 , where @xmath400 is half of the equilibrium correlation length for a chain at temperature @xmath401 and @xmath402 represents the fitting parameter and the overall amplitude of @xmath403 .",
    "thus , we find that the simulations are consistent with @xmath403 decaying as @xmath404 in _ both _ baths .",
    "this result confirms the intuitive picture of the flux in figure [ fig : setup ] .",
    "we see that the flux in the hot bath must decay faster than in the cold one since we will have @xmath405 .",
    "an analytic check of this conjecture would be a natural extension of the results presented here . in the @xmath8 ( @xmath406 )",
    "limit , the flux decays more slowly into the cold bath , as shown by the points connected by the dashed line in figure [ fig:2temp ] .",
    "however , we seem to lose the @xmath407 power law behavior for @xmath408 and find a different kind of long range decay .",
    "we have no conjecture for the behavior of this decay , so no fit to the simulation data was attempted .",
    "we also do not understand how the overall amplitude @xmath402 depends on @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "all we know is that it should decay to zero as @xmath409 and the whole chain approaches equilibrium .",
    "this is evident in figure [ fig:2temp ] where the chains with values of @xmath410 close to @xmath411 have smaller values of @xmath403 at the junction around @xmath62 .",
    "we have now examined in detail the exact results available for the energy flux through two ising chains at different temperatures .",
    "this flux is an interesting quantity as it is a purely non - equilibrium quantity which vanishes at equilibrium .",
    "it is also physically relevant , as it describes the rate at which energy is transferred between the ising chains due to a temperature gradient .",
    "we found that when one of the chains is at infinite temperature ( @xmath5 ) , an energy flux with magnitude @xmath412 with @xmath413 is injected into the cold chain from the hot chain .",
    "this energy then gets transported along the cold chain and eventually dissipates .",
    "we have given an exact expression for this flux @xmath3 and also an excellent approximation .",
    "the main features of this flux is an exponential decay for @xmath7 and large @xmath4 with a decay length @xmath414 \\}^{-1}/2 $ ] equal to half of the correlation length of an infinite chain at equilibrium at temperature @xmath1 . as @xmath8",
    ", we get the maximum amount of energy injected into the cold chain and the flux @xmath3 decays much more slowly , as the power law @xmath407 at @xmath415 .",
    "another way of understanding the @xmath8 limit is by focusing on the dynamics of the boundaries between clusters of up and down spins .",
    "we can treat these boundaries as particles by identifying any two spins that are anti - aligned .",
    "for example , we can have spin configurations @xmath416 or @xmath417 , where we use the @xmath418 symbol to denote the boundary particle .",
    "notice that it costs no energy to flip either the second or third spin .",
    "thus , when either of these spins is selected in a monte carlo simulation , it will flip with a probability of @xmath361 , moving the boundary either to the left or to the right .",
    "thus , these domain boundaries will perform unbiased random walks along the chain coupled to the cold bath with @xmath419 until they are removed at the two ends of the chain or until two domain boundaries annihilate via the transitions @xmath420 and @xmath421 .",
    "this pair - annihilation will release an energy of @xmath422 into the cold bath .",
    "notice that the infinite temperature @xmath62 spin will generate these particles at one end of the chain as it is allowed to flip even when its aligned with its neighbor at @xmath199 .",
    "since this is the only mechanism by which we change the energy of the cold spin chain , when @xmath423 , @xmath3 measures the frequency of these annihilation events along the chain due to the injection of these boundary `` particles '' at @xmath62 .",
    "these kinds of particle models ( and their ising model duals ) have been the subject of much study @xcite and many exact results for the steady state distributions and correlation functions are available via fermionic methods , bethe ansatz techniques , etc .",
    "this dual language might be useful in understanding what happens in the cold bath when @xmath415 and @xmath408 , as we were only able to fully understand what happens in the limit @xmath5 .",
    "when @xmath9 , @xmath3 also includes contributions from pair _ creation _ of the boundary particles .",
    "a natural generalization of the model considered in this paper to two dimensions is to look at spins on a square lattice .",
    "the lattice can be partitioned into two halves , with spins in the two halves coupled to two different heat baths with temperatures @xmath0 and @xmath1 . in two dimensions ,",
    "there is a phase transition at finite temperature and the ordered phase ( aligned spins ) becomes stable at low temperatures .",
    "this means that at low temperature , more energy is required to both form and move domain boundaries .",
    "the boundaries at low temperature do not move as freely inside the system as they do in one dimension because spins at the boundaries will be typically surrounded by more aligned than anti - aligned spins .",
    "thus , we expect the fluctuations at the interface between the two halves of the lattice not to propagate very far at low temperatures .",
    "the total energy flux between hot and cold baths coupled to spins on a two - dimensional lattice was studied previously @xcite to test the validity of fluctuation relations out of equilibrium .",
    "it would be interesting to expand upon this research by looking at the spatial dependence of the flux .",
    "for example , one could study the generalization of @xmath3 : the average rate of energy change due to spin flipping at a distance @xmath4 away from the interface .",
    "preliminary simulation results on a square lattice ( with periodic bcs along the direction parallel to the interface between the two lattice halves and open bcs on the other two sides ) suggest that , unlike in one dimension , the flux @xmath3 is vanishingly small when @xmath424 and @xmath415 .",
    "the flux decays approximately exponentially for @xmath424 and arbitrary finite @xmath7 .",
    "we find that , assuming an exponential decay of @xmath3 , the associated decay length is small for all @xmath1 ( on the order of the lattice spacing ) and increases as @xmath1 approaches the critical temperature @xmath425 @xcite for both @xmath426 and @xmath427 . also unlike the one - dimensional case",
    ", the decay length of @xmath3 does not appear to be simply related to the equilibrium correlation length .",
    "of course , these results need to be checked with more careful simulations , especially when @xmath1 is close to @xmath428 , where there might be novel critical behavior and associated power laws .",
    "our simulations were limited to small system sizes ( squares of about 20 spins on a side ) and we expect that there are finite - size effects . a comprehensive account of these effects is beyond the scope of this paper , and the two - dimensional generalization of the model remains an interesting open problem for future study .",
    "such a study would require a detailed look at all the possible combinations of @xmath0 and @xmath1 relative to @xmath428 , as each half of the lattice is expected to behave qualitatively differently depending on whether its temperature and that of its partner is above or below the critical temperature . as mentioned in the previous paper @xcite , we also expect a nontrivial magnetization profile at temperatures below the critical temperature . finally , the preliminary simulation results suggest that an interesting case is @xmath424 and @xmath429 , where we seem to have the largest energy flux .    there are some more obvious open problems , like the analytic behavior of @xmath3 in one dimension for the case where both @xmath1 and @xmath0 are finite .",
    "we have formal expressions for this case , but we do not understand precisely how @xmath3 decays away from the junction for this more general case .",
    "we conjecture in section [ sec : simul ] that for non - zero temperatures @xmath3 decays exponentially into both baths .",
    "this should be checked rigorously .",
    "as mentioned in section [ sec : simul ] , we also do not know the precise way in which @xmath430 as the entire chain moves closer to equilibrium as @xmath431 . finally ,",
    "as discussed in @xcite , there are countless ways to extend the calculations we presented here .",
    "we could include different dynamics ( such as kawasaki spin - exchange ) , explore different boundary conditions , etc .",
    "it is interesting that the far - from - equilibrium system studied here displays behavior reminiscent of a second order phase transition when @xmath5 and @xmath8 : we have a diverging decay length and a transition to a power law .",
    "however , unlike an equilibrium phase transition , we do not have a general framework for understanding this crossover .",
    "this means that exact results such as the ones presented in this work are especially useful in guiding more general studies of non - equilibrium phenomena .",
    "this work was supported by the nsf graduate research fellowship program .",
    "simulations were performed on the odyssey supercomputer at harvard university .",
