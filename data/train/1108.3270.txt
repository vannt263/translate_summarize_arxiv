    "@xmath76 are obtained by measuring the coherence of the probe qubit ( see eq .",
    "( [ sreduced ] ) ) . for the moment , if we only take into account the @xmath82 decay of the probe qubit , then all of the measured values should be smaller than the actual value by a value roughly equal to @xmath118 . here",
    "@xmath119 is the evolution time , and we assume it is the same for all of the measurements .",
    "this assumption is equivalent to saying that the prepared cets @xmath13 is subject to the depolarizing channel : @xmath120 where @xmath121 , and @xmath122 is the dimension of the cets . in the ideal case",

    "a depolarizing channel as a noise model is a pure assumption , and it is almost impossible to determine the exact value of @xmath123 , e.g. in the case where the decay rate for each observable may be different from the others . nonetheless , partial recovery from the noise is possible when the decay rates are roughly the same , and we may estimate @xmath123 in an average sense . to see this ,",

    "<S> these results serve as a guide for identifying the challenges for performing quantum simulation on physical systems at finite temperatures , and pave the way towards large scale experimental simulations of open quantum systems in condensed matter physics and chemistry .            </S>",
    "<S> the most challenging aspect of many - body simulation is that the memory and temporal resources often scale exponentially , rendering many problems of interest intractable by all known classical methods @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a promising solution is _ quantum simulation _ , in which a quantum system acts as a processor to simulate another physical system ( quantum or classical ) . </S>",
    "<S> there are two classes of quantum simulation :  analog \" simulators are typically engineered to simulate a particular class of hamiltonians  @xcite and to find ground states of non - trivial hamiltonians adiabatically , whereas  digital \" simulators rely on universal quantum information processors ( qips ) , capable of implementing a universal set of quantum gate operations @xcite to simulate not only ground states , but also thermal states , and even time - evolving states .    </S>",
    "<S> simulations of interacting spin systems are of particular importance to many applications , such as modeling magnetism @xcite , solving optimization problems @xcite , and restoring digital image @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , understanding the properties of the spin models also offers insights to the computational complexity theory  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> for example , the ground - state problem of the ising spin model is known to be an @xmath0-complete problem ; this implies that if an efficient algorithm for solving the ground - state problem of the ising model exists , then it can solve all other problems in the class of @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> this matter is related to the question whether @xmath1 equals @xmath0 , and is a major unsolved problem in computer science .    in a series of recent experiments </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , based on the adiabatic methods , progresses of quantum simulation of various spin systems have been achieved in various physical systems . </S>",
    "<S> these experiments , however , suffers from two limitations : ( a )  they are limited to studying the ground - state properties only , and ( b )  the energy gaps along the adiabatic paths must be large enough to avoid excitations from the ground states . in general , the energy gaps can not be pre - determined efficiently , and are non - controllable . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the advantage of the adiabatic methods over classical methods is not guaranteed for all cases . on the other hand , at finite temperatures , all of the thermodynamics of spin systems can be obtained by determining the partition function @xmath2 , which , instead of @xmath0 , falls into a different complexity class called sharp-@xmath1 , or @xmath3 . however , </S>",
    "<S> if an efficient algorithm for evaluating partition functions exists , then the ground - state properties of the corresponding spin systems can also be determined efficiently . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the problem of determining partition functions is at least as hard as the @xmath0-problems , or simply called @xmath0-hard .    </S>",
    "<S> practically , partition functions can not be computed efficiently , except for some simple cases such as 1-d spin chains . for classical spins , </S>",
    "<S> the classical metropolis algorithm provide a means for generating the gibbs distributions , through the construction of markov chains with monte - carlo methods . for quantum systems , </S>",
    "<S> the quantum generalization of the metropolis algorithm has been achieved @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , markov - chain based methods , similar to the adiabatic methods , are limited to the cases where the markov - matrix gaps can not be too small to achieve convergence . </S>",
    "<S> particularly , for frustrated spin systems , metropolis sampling can result in ensembles trapped in local minima . in these cases , methods for direct encoding </S>",
    "<S> the gibbs distribution into the states of the qubits would be more efficient . </S>",
    "<S> this is the key issue that motivates this experimental work . by using a digital simulator , </S>",
    "<S> our system can explore the full phase diagram of the thermal state of the system , as a function of temperature and magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> all ranges are in principle accessible due to the digital nature of the simulation . </S>",
    "<S> unlike other quantum phase transitions explored in other quantum simulation experiments @xcite , the underlying hamiltonian of the simulator does not need to be restricted to certain types of interactions to be able to simulate the target system . in this letter </S>",
    "<S> , we report the first digital quantum simulation of the finite - temperature properties a classical three - spin frustrated magnet , a building block of spin ice , ( see fig .  [ figcir ] ) , using a four - qubit quantum register based on nmr . </S>",
    "<S> the reason for simulating the frustrated magnet is that it exhibits a rich phase diagram of the total magnetization as a function of temperature and magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> this allows us to experimentally probe various distinct features of this system . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> the phenomenon of geometric frustration is an interesting topic in condensed matter physics . </S>",
    "<S> for example , materials , such as water ice , exhibiting geometric frustration can not be completely frozen ; the motion at the molecular scale continues even at absolute zero . </S>",
    "<S> recently , the same three - spin frustrated magnet at zero temperature has been simulated by trapped ions @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we aim to make progress along this direction by extending the quantum simulation of the frustrated magnet to finite temperatures .    in our simulation , instead of a mixed state </S>",
    "<S> , the implemented algorithm prepares a coherent encoding of a classical thermal state ( cets ) on a quantum register  @xcite , @xmath4 which is a pure state ( a pseudopure state in the nmr experiment ) with amplitudes @xmath5 equal to the square roots of the corresponding thermal state gibbs distribution associated with the eigenstate @xmath6 of the hamiltonian @xmath7 . here </S>",
    "<S> @xmath8 ( @xmath9 ) , and @xmath10 is the partition function . </S>",
    "<S> the cets , therefore , contains all of the information about the thermal density matrix @xmath11 of the system . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , the thermal density matrix @xmath12 can be directly obtained from the cets state @xmath13 by artificially  decohering \" the off - diagonal elements of the density matrix @xmath14 constructed from the cets .    in this method @xcite , </S>",
    "<S> the number of quantum gates needed to prepare the cets is linear in the number of spins for 1d cases and sub - exponential for 2d cases , but is still exponential in general for @xmath0-problems . </S>",
    "<S> nonetheless , the efficiency of this algorithm is independent of the simulated temperature , and not limited by the small - gap problem encountered in the markov - chain monte carlo algorithms . </S>",
    "<S> this makes it advantageous for simulating the low - temperature properties of frustrated spin systems . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , although this algorithms can at most yield a quadratic speedup for simulating the most general thermal states @xcite , the subclass of the cets which can be created efficiently on a quantum computer can serve as a  heat bath \" @xcite for the simulation of the dynamics of open quantum systems , which could give an exponential advantage @xcite . our goal is to investigate how well such a cets can be prepared in the laboratory subject to the existing experimental constraints .    in this experiment , </S>",
    "<S> three qubits encode the cets of a triangle plaquette of ising spins with equal couplings  @xmath15 , with temperature @xmath16 and global magnetic field @xmath17 as variables . </S>",
    "<S> a fourth ancilla qubit is used to probe the physical properties of the cets by measuring the set of diagonal pauli operators , so that quantities such as the total magnetizations and spin correlations can be extracted . </S>",
    "<S> these measurements are sufficient for determining the partition function @xmath2 , from which any thermodynamic quantity of interest , e.g. entropy @xmath18 , can be calculated .    to be more specific , the hamiltonian of the frustrated magnet is defined by @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the @xmath21 pauli matrix of the spin @xmath22 . for @xmath23 , the coupling is antiferromagnetic , where the spins tend to minimize the energy by pointing in opposite directions . </S>",

    "<S> the raw experimental results are in good agreement with the numerical simulation which takes into the account the decoherence effects . by rescaling the total magnetization by a constant factor , which is equivalent to removing the isotropic errors @xcite ( see also supplementary material ) , the rescaled results agree much better with the theoretical predictions . in any case , it is clear that the magnetization changes in steps when the simulated magnetic field is varied from a large negative value ( @xmath67 ) to a large positive value ( @xmath68 ) . </S>",

    "<S> this is the result of the competition between the antiferromagnetic couplings and the external field applied to the frustrated magnet .    </S>",
    "<S> apart from the total magnetization , the other correlation functions are probed systematically for a range of the simulated temperatures and external fields . </S>",

    "<S> , we can construct the thermal state density matrix of the frustrated magnet ( subject to the normalization condition @xmath70 ) : @xmath71 where @xmath72 , @xmath73 , and @xmath74 . </S>",
    "<S> we ignore the imaginary parts of the elements , which are zero in theory , and less than 11% in the experimental data . with complete knowledge of the thermal density matrix @xmath12 , we can determine all of the macroscopic thermodynamic observables for an ensemble of frustrated magnets . </S>",
    "<S> in this study , we are particularly interested in investigating a non - linear quantity , namely the entropy , @xmath75 and gauge how sensitive it is to experimental errors in @xmath76 .    </S>",

    "<S> one finds that the sharp changes of @xmath18 around @xmath69 and @xmath25 correspond to the crossovers , which have been observed in measurement of the total magnetization . </S>",
    "<S> compared with the region of @xmath78 , the large values of @xmath18 in the region @xmath79 , especially around @xmath28 , indicates the preference of anti - ferromagnetism which causes the frustration for the magnet . for the outer region @xmath78 , where the external field should be strong enough to polarize the magnet , </S>",
    "<S> the theoretical predictions of @xmath18 should be zero . </S>",
    "<S> however , the experiment results , including the rescaled results , show non - zero values . </S>",
    "<S> this is due to the anisotropy of the measurement results taken from the three nuclear spins . </S>",
    "<S> the surface plots in fig.[lowentropyfig]b - d show the entropy as a function of @xmath17 and @xmath80 from theory ( b ) , experiment ( c ) , simulation ( d ) , and the rescaled experimental results that partially remove decoherence effects ( e ) . </S>",
    "<S> we see that the role of the temperature is to  wash out \" the competition between the antiferromagnetic coupling and the external field . </S>",
    "<S> this is indicated by a transition near some value of the temperature ( @xmath81 ) , beyond which the variation of the simulated external field @xmath17 no longer causes sharp crossovers .    to summarize , the imperfection of the experimental results is mainly due to decoherence effects ; the duration of the experiment ranges from 0.35 - 0.76 s , ( see supplementary material for details ) , which is comparable with the @xmath82 times of the nuclear spins . </S>",
    "<S> the simulated data , which take into account the nuclear @xmath82 decay , closely match the experimental results . </S>",
    "<S> to a much lesser extent , inhomogeneities of the applied magnetic fields and imperfect pulses also contribute to the error . </S>",
    "<S> partial recovery of the density matrix is possible for isotropic errors ( see supplementary material ) , this allows us to rescale the magnetization to improve the agreement with the theoretical values ( see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ figmag ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> the anisotropic part of the error , however , can not be removed , and significantly affects the experimental entropy results ( see fig .  [ lowentropyfig ] ) .    </S>",
    "<S> the phase kick - back method was chosen for readout to exploit the fact that all j - couplings are well resolved for spin c@xmath45 . for spins c@xmath47 and c@xmath50 , there is non - negligible overlap between certain spectral peaks , which makes direct state tomography unreliable for certain states . nonetheless , for certain simple states like @xmath83 at at @xmath77 and @xmath68 , state tomography through direct readout of all three spins can be performed reliably and compared to the phase kick - back results . </S>",
    "<S> the state fidelity measured in this fashion was close to the phase kick - back result , only differing by @xmath84 ( see fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ tomop5fig ] in supplementary information ) .    in conclusion , we employed a quantum information processor using nuclear spins to perform a digital quantum simulation of a geometrically frustrated magnet subject to a simulated magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> we explored the phase diagram of this system for a range of temperatures and magnetic fields , and studied the competition between the antiferromagnetic couplings and the external field ; the crossover points where the magnetic field quenches the frustration are correctly captured , and the overall experimental results are in good agreement with numerical simulations and theory . </S>"
