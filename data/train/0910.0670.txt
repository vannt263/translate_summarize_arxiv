    "at low energy scale , interactions among electrons largely determine the structure , phases , and stability of matter .",
    "although this fact is well known , pragmatic first - priniciples / quantum - mechanical calculations to determine various properties of many - electron systems are often hindered by two factors .",
    "first , in most condensed matter systems , the typical interaction energy between electrons ( the electric coupling constant @xmath0 divided by average electron - electron separation ) is often larger than the typical kinetic / fermi energy of electrons .",
    "the results is that a perturbative expansion using @xmath0 as the expansion parameter may not be fruitful .",
    "this is particularly true for strongly correlated systems .",
    "second , there is an exponential increase in the number of degrees of freedom as the number of electrons involved increases . when the number of electrons becomes large , according to kohn,@xcite calculations based on constructing many - electron wave functions",
    "soon lose accuracy and will be stopped by an  exponential wall \" .",
    "it is thus imperative to have a method that goes beyond the conventional perturbative scheme using @xmath0 as the expansion parameter and whose computational complexity does not grow exponentially with the number of electrons involved .    in 1964 ,",
    "hohenberg and kohn  @xcite proved a theorem stating that there exists a _",
    "unique _ description of the ground state of a many - body system in terms of the expectation value of the particle - density operator .",
    "this theorem started the development of the density functional theory ( dft ) , which offers a possibility of finding the ground state energy @xmath1 by minimizing the energy functional @xmath2 that depends on the charge density @xmath3 only : e_g=_n e _ , [ enfunc ] with @xmath4 representing the external one - particle potential of the system .",
    "the electronic density @xmath5 , which minimizes the energy functional @xmath6 $ ] , is the ground state electronic density .",

    "the electron density @xmath9 , minimizing the grand potential functional , corresponds to the electron density at thermal equilibrium .    to make practical use of the dft ,",

    ". limitations of these _ approximate _ functionals have been discussed.@xcite some of the failures while using _",
    "ad hoc _ density functionals can be attributed to misuse of the density - functional theory .",
    "for example , it is sometimes neglected that the electron density @xmath18 achievable via introduction of a source potential must obey @xmath19 and does not cover the functional space @xmath20 , a problem also known as the @xmath4-representability .",
    "@xcite as pointed out in reference  , neglecting these constraints may lead to conclusions  @xcite that are not always valid .",
    "the main objective of the dft is to describe a many - body system in terms of the expectation value of the particle density operator .",
    "in fact , the use of the expectation value of a suitable operator to describe a many - body system via legendre transformation , first introduced into quantum field theory by jona - lasinio,@xcite is known as the effective action formalism . as",
    "the temperature approaches zero , the effective potential becomes the ground state energy .",
    "this connection suggests that effective action formalism can be used to achieve the general goal of the dft : describing a many - particle system in terms of the expectation value of the density operator .",
    "a number of publications  @xcite showed that at zero temperature the effective action plus @xmath21 is the ground state energy , linking effective action to the dft .",
    "existing methods of expressing dft via effective action formalism can be classified roughly into two categories : either ( a ) by introducing an auxiliary field or ( b ) by using a perturbative scheme assuming the electric coupling as a small parameter .",
    "the former category includes a method developed by fukuda _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite and that developed by polonyi and sailer .",
    "@xcite the latter scheme is used by valiev and fernando@xcite and by fukuda _",
    "_  @xcite .",
    "the strengths of the auxiliary field approach often come from the simplicity of the effective action expression and from the fact that in principle each term already includes infinitely many feynman diagrams.@xcite however , as pointed out by fukuda _",
    "et al._,@xcite the auxiliary field approach seems to lack a direct connection to the kohn - sham scheme .",
    "valiev and fernando  @xcite introduced an auxiliary field to compute the exchange - correlation energy .",
    "however , the source term they introduced is coupled to the auxiliary field instead of the electron density operator . furthermore ,",
    "as pointed out by the authors themselves ,  @xcite an artificial decomposition of the auxiliary field into a sum of the hartree potential , the exchange correlation potential , and the remaining fluctuations is needed to write down the exchange - correlation energy .",
    "there are two advantages when one uses electric coupling in the perturbative ( diagrammatic ) expansion without introducing an auxiliary field . first , under the effective action formalism of this type , a direct connection to the kohn - sham scheme can be made .",
    "@xcite second , there exist other @xmath0 expansion - based developments that can be used to obtain @xmath17 + e_{xc}[n]$ ] , the universal density functional ( udf ) .",
    "for example , with increasingly complex incorporation of ks orbitals and energies at each order of @xmath0 , grling and levy  @xcite wrote @xmath1 as a perturbation series . employing the luttinger - ward  @xcite method that uses @xmath0 as the perturbative expansion parameter to calculate electron self - energy , sham and schlter expressed @xmath22 as a rather convoluted implicit functional of electron density.@xcite as shown by tokatly and pankratov,@xcite these methods mentioned above can be expressed diagrammatically .",
    "however , the problem associated with @xmath0 based expansion remains .",
    "as described in reference  , the expansion using @xmath0 is only good when @xmath0 is very small . whether one can treat @xmath0 as a small parameter or not depends on the kinetic / fermi energy of the electrons and the strength as well as the magnitude of variation of the single - particle potential involved . as a matter of fact , the success  @xcite in employing the gw approximation",
    "@xcite indicates that not treating @xmath0 as small may lead to results closer to experimental outcomes .    in principle",
    ", the problem associated with assuming @xmath0 small can be tamed by summing an infinite subset of feynman diagrams . however , as pointed out by hedin ,  @xcite it is nontrivial to devise a systematic resummation scheme where each new term is free from divergence even if @xmath23 and for which the sum of the new terms , each containing an infinitely many feynman diagrams , accounts completely and non - redundantly for all conventional @xmath0 expansion diagrams . in this paper , without assuming @xmath0 small we develop an auxiliary field method that makes a direct connection to the kohn - sham scheme and at the same time provides equivalently a systematic resummation scheme .",
    "a commonly used approximation for the density functional is the so - called local density approximation ( lda ) in which the exchange - correlation energy is approximated by a linear functional @xmath24 \\approx \\int d\\r \\ , n(\\r ) \\ ; e_{xc}(n(\\r))$ ] , where @xmath25 is a function of the local density ( not a functional of the density profile ) .",
    "see reference   for a nontechnical review .",
    "this approximation ignores the nonlocal effect of the density profile , i.e. , it assumes that @xmath26/\\delta n(\\r)$ ] only depends on the value of @xmath3 at @xmath27 but not on the density @xmath28 at locations other than @xmath27 . to complement the lda by incorporating nonlocal density dependence , polonyi and sailer  @xcite proposed the @xmath29-local approximation for the density functional , based on an idea very similar to the cluster expansion in statistical physics . using this method to obtain explicit expressions for the approximate functional with @xmath30 , however , becomes increasingly challenging due to the necessity of going through the coupling constant integration as required by the hellmann - feynman theorem.@xcite    another route to developing density functionals is via the so - called optimal effective potential ( oep ) methods .",
    "@xcite these methods typically start by introducing _ a priori _ an approximate , explicitly  @xcite orbital - dependent functional .",
    "( the approximate functional can be either hartree - fock or a more elaborated form . )",
    "the procedure then continues with a minimization of the functional via varying single - particle ks orbitals and associated energies .",
    "recently , the definition of oep methods has been generalized  @xcite to include functionals dependent on either green s function , the self - energy , or the ks potential . since our effective action based functional",
    "is based on self - consistently obtaining the ks potential , it falls exactly in the latter category .",
    "the generalized definition of oep methods is probably becoming the standard definition now .",
    "a general characteristic of oep methods is that the functional arguments be they ks orbitals / energies , green s functions , self energies , or ks potentials are obtained via self - consistent procedure .",
    "therefore , even with correction terms derived from pertrubative expansion , the self - consistency condition for oep methods distinguishes them from regular pertrubative methods .",
    "the important matter here is whether an oep functional can be systematically improved and possibly be asymptotically exact or not .    based on effective action formalism , the oep functional proposed here is asymptotically exact and",
    "can be shown to give rise to the desired udf .",
    "containing all the @xmath29-local interaction vertices , our method can provide equivalent approximate functionals for @xmath31 without going through the hellmann - feynman theorem .",
    "since we focus on describing the proposed approach in a manner as self - contained as possible , we have included a non - negligible amount of standard materials available in existing literature / textbooks while keeping only a small portion of the existing literature that we deem closely related to the present manuscript .",
    "readers interested in gaining a broad background are referred to references   and   for reviews on the extensive body of literature in the dft and related many - body approaches .",
    "expert readers should note that new developments are mainly provided in sections iiib - d .",
    "although section iv and end of section v also contain some useful developments , they typically rederive / re - express known results within our framework and/or provide contrast with existing methods .",
    "section vi contains some insight of problems shared in post hartree corrections .",
    "this paper is otherwise organized as follows .",
    "we first establish the notation in section  [ sec : notation ] , followed by the development of the general formalism in section  [ sec : formulation ] .",
    "the purpose of subsection  [ subsec : recipe ] is to provide a computational recipe and to give some perspectives on computational complexity : no novelty is claimed here . in section  [ sec : case_studies ] , we discuss a number of case studies : the emergence of the universal functional @xmath8 $ ] in eq .",

    "consequently , each propagator ( green s function ) carries a definite momentum even if the coulomb interaction among electrons is fully taken into consideration .",
    "investigation of the heg system dates back to 1930s by wigner,@xcite who coined the term  correlation energy \" to represent the ground state energy per electron after subtracting away the average kinetic and exchange energy .",
    "( the hartree energy is cancelled exactly by the interaction between electrons and the positive background , and by the coulomb energy among the uniform positive charges . ) apparently , after choosing the rydberg ( the negative of the hydrogen atom ground state energy ) as the energy unit , one may express either the correlation energy or the ground state energy of the heg system in terms of the dimensionless quantity @xmath486 , where @xmath487 , @xmath488 being the volume of the system considered , @xmath12 being the total number of electrons , and @xmath489 representing the bohr radius .",

    "a small @xmath490 expansion is most naturally performed by treating the coulomb interaction as a perturbation .",

    "only two - particle irreducible diagrams contribute .",
    "indeed , the work of luttinger and ward  @xcite ( as well as that of klein  @xcite ) was exactly along this line . since the self - energy is not known",
    "_ a priori _ , this type of energetic expression is a functional of the self - energy ( or the full green s function ) , which must be determined via a stationary condition.@xcite    an equivalent of the brueckner - goldstone formalism  @xcite was used by gell - mann and brueckner  @xcite to compute the correlation energy of the heg system . given the long - range nature of the coulomb interaction , it is not surprising that gell - mann and brueckner identified the occurrence of divergence as early as in the second order of @xmath0-based perturbative calculation . to circumvent this unphysical divergence",
    ", they summed an infinite subset of diagrams to arrive at a contribution proportional to @xmath494 . to eliminate unphysical divergence ,",
    "dubois  @xcite replaced the bare coulomb interaction by the screened one .",
    "starting with calculating the vacuum amplitude , he expressed the ground state energy in terms of integration of the _ full _ electronic polarization over the coulomb coupling strength , using a version of the feynman - hellmann theorem . while the full polarization is used , the electron propagator entering dubois s formalism is the free electron propagator instead of the full propagator .",
    "unfortunately , dubois made a mistake in extracting the higher order terms of the ground state energy at the high density ( small @xmath490 ) limit .",
    "although this error was later corrected by carr and maradudin,@xcite according to hedin,@xcite this high density expansion violated at moderate @xmath490 values ferrell s condition,@xcite which is based on the simple fact that the second order perturbation contribution to the ground state energy is always negative .    except for using the screened coulomb interaction to replace the bare one and working directly at zero temperature ,",
    "hedin s approach is largely similar to the finite - temperature formalism of luttinger and ward  @xcite in the sense that the _ full _ electron propagator is used as the fundamental variable . as a consequence ,",
    "the higher order diagrams contributing to the full polarization appear different in dubois s work and in hedin s formalism .",
    "instead of solving his own self - consistent equations , however , hedin approximated the _ full _ green s function within his formalism by the _ non - interacting _ green s function to compute the energetics of the heg system .",
    "nevertheless , it is still possible to maintain the exactness within hedin s approach if two - particle reducible diagrams are properly included .",
    "we will provide an example of such a two - particle reducible diagram that would not be included in hedin s approximate calculation but should be incorporated for theoretical soundness .",
    "another important issue in obtaining the ground state energy of a many - electron system has to do with whether the finite temperature formalism ( setting @xmath495 first followed by @xmath496 ) or the zero temperature formalism ( setting @xmath370 and then followed by @xmath497 ) is used . in terms of diagrammatic expansion , there exist diagrams ( termed _ anomalous _ diagrams by luttinger _",
    "et al._@xcite ) that are present ( giving finite contribution ) within the finite temperature formalism but are absent ( giving zero contribution ) within the zero temperature formalism . to be specific , a diagram is anomalous if within it there exist two electron propagators linking two different times ( say @xmath439 , @xmath498 and of course @xmath499 ) in the opposite orders : @xmath500 .",
    "zero temperature methods typically rely on the gell - mann and low theorem ,  @xcite which assures that adiabatic transformation of the noninteracting ground state by gradually switching on the interaction leads to an eigenstate of the interacting system.@xcite the energetic difference of this eigenstate and the noninteracting ground state is what the zero temperature formalism obtains .",
    "this approach therefore makes sense only if the adiabatically transformed state is the ground state of the interacting system , which occurs only if the noninteracting fermi surface is identical to that of the interacting system .",
    "@xcite for the heg system , the perturbed fermi surface remains spherical ( identical to that of the unperturbed one ) since the coulomb interaction respects spherical symmetry and the background positive charge distribution also has spherical symmetry .",
    "consequently , for the heg system , the anomalous diagrams should end up giving no contribution .",
    "indeed , luttinger _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite illustrated how the contributions from the anomalous diagrams in this case are cancelled by the chemical potential shift .",
    "luttinger and ward  @xcite also showed how one may avoid anomalous contributions from appearing by expressing the grand potential as a sum of _ all _ possible linked diagrams ( including two - particle reducible ones ) .",
    "the key step there is to subtract from each self - energy part a number , which is given by that self - energy part evaluated at the fermi surface . as we will illustrate later",
    ", under our finite temperature formalism it is not necessary to implement such an elaborate subtraction scheme because each two - particle reducible diagram is automatically accompanied by another appropriate diagrammatic subtraction .",
    "what sets our self - consistent equation ( [ oep ] ) apart from that of luttinger and ward and of hedin is the variable to be solved for .",
    "it is the ks potential , instead of the physical green s function , that enters our exact , self - consistent equation . in general",
    ", one needs to first solve @xmath143 self - consistently using eq .",
    "( [ oep ] ) prior to the evaluation of the grand potential ( or the ground state energy ) .",
    "when limiting to a homogeneous system with constant electron density , however , @xmath501 becomes the only possibility . whether or not such a choice satisfies the self - consistent equation ( [ oep ] ) depends on whether a uniform electron density truly represent the lowest energy configuration .",
    "for the present purpose of considering a high density heg , we assume a constant @xmath143 to proceed . because a constant @xmath143 can be easily absorbed into the chemical potential , the resulting ks green s function carries a corresponding energy that consists of kinetic energy only .",
    "that is , rather than being an approximation as in hedin s case , the single - particle green s function carrying only kinetic energy represents exactly the self - consistent ks green s function under our formalism .",

    "@xcite expressed the excitation energy condition using effective action formalism , without explicit connection to the kohn - sham formalism . by introducing time - dependent kohn - sham orbitals while assuming time idependence of the orbital occupation numbers , casida  @xcite derived via linear response theory a self - consistent condition on the density matrix response that leads to determination of excitation energies .",

    "second , although it is possible to find derivations of formulas  @xcite similar to those that will be shown here , they do appear slightly different and thus a self - contained exposition may be helpful .    intuitively speaking , by varying the frequency of the probe , one seeks the frequency / energy where the amplitude of the response function diverges .",

    "the vertex functions @xmath803 in ( [ w.varphi.3 ] ) will contribute to the so - called @xmath29-local approximation of reference  .",
    "the absence of @xmath804 manifests the absence of the correction term due to the bi - local contribution , as shown in reference  .",
    "furthermore , with the bilocal approximation  @xcite included , polonyi and sailer obtained an approximate energy functional which corresponds exactly to our @xmath805 . to reach an equivalent form of the proposed @xmath29-local approximation of reference  , we simply keep terms up to @xmath806 .",
    "therefore , our formulation provides an explicit means for achieving an @xmath29-local approximation without resorting to the hellmann - feynman theorem .    as shown in ( [ td.exp ] )",
    ", the propagator @xmath213 can be expanded as @xmath807 when @xmath212 can be viewed as a small quantity and treated perturbatively .",
    "when one is not allowed to treat @xmath212 as a small parameter ( say in the strong coupling regime ) , or when one needs to treat @xmath808 as a small parameter instead , the conventional perturbative expansion in @xmath0 breaks down completely while our approach is still applicable . in the case",
    "when @xmath808 must be treated as small , we expand @xmath213 as [ td.exp.sc ] _ 0 = -d_0 ^ -1 - d_0 ^ -1di u^-1 di d_0 ^ -1 - d_0 ^ -1di u^-1 di d_0 ^ -1 di u^-1 di d_0 ^ -1 -  . and in this case , @xmath809 , our effective action expansion does have the hartree term @xmath810 as the leading order , followed by terms of order @xmath811 and then the expansion of @xmath213 provides series in powers of @xmath808 .",
    "note that in this case , the exchange - correlation functional is not led by order @xmath212 at all , but is led by order @xmath811 .",
    "this feature is not present in the conventional perturbative approach using @xmath212 ( or @xmath0 ) as the expansion parameter .    as mentioned earlier ,",
    "there also exist different functional methods for many electron systems .",
    "for example , the exchange correlation functional outlined by sham  @xcite is founded on the perturbative functional approach developed by luttinger and ward  @xcite or equivalently by klein.@xcite a succinct review of the luttinger - ward / klein functional and its applications can be found in reference .",
    "the luttinger - ward / klein functional yields the grand - potential / ground - state - energy only when the functional argument is equal to the _ fully - interacting _ , physical , one - particle green s function . instead of allowing the physical , full , one - particle green s function , dahlen _ et al . _",
    "@xcite proposed to find that stationary point of the luttinger - ward / klein functional while restricting the argument to the hartree - fock green s functions or the green s functions of non - interacting systems .",
    "however , even if the luttinger - ward / klein functional is computed to all orders , the error in the value of the grand potential ( or the ground state energy ) due to restriction on the green s functions remains unknown .",
    "furthermore , it should be noted that when the functional argument is equal to the physical one - particle green s function , the luttinger - ward / klein functional reaches a stationary point , _ not _ the minimum.@xcite this means that it is possible for the klein / luttinger - ward functional to assume an even lower value than the ground state energy ( or the grand potential ) when the functional argument deviates from the physical green s function . in other words ,",
    "the klein / luttinger - ward functional only retains its meaning as the ground state energy ( or grand potential ) when the green s function takes the value of the true ( physical ) green s function .",
    "our effective action expression of the energy functional , on the other hand , truly represents energy of the system .",
    "our effective action energy functional , when no truncation on the series is made , reaches its _ minimum _ when the electron density assumes the true ( physical ) density , and for any other @xmath4-representable density profile prescribed , it represents the lowest energy possible associated with that prescribed density profile .",
    "the method of hedin  @xcite is largely identical to that of luttinger and ward.@xcite this includes the fact that the energy functional reaches a stationary point , rather than the minimum , when the functional argument is the fully - interacting one - particle green s function .",
    "however , hedin aims to replace the @xmath0-based ( bare coulomb ) perturbative expansion of the electron self energy by another expansion using a screened interaction @xmath812 .",
    "hedin expresses the electron self energy and the screened interaction as a functional of the electron green s function of the interacting system .",
    "interestingly , the first order result , also termed the gw approximation , of hedin  @xcite has been shown  @xcite to produce good results when compared to other density functionals .",
    "this suggests that not treating @xmath0 as small might have some advantage .",
    "it is worth pointing out that the first order term , @xmath813 , of the udf described here is equivalent to the celebrated gw approximation .",
    "like the @xmath812 propagator of hedin,@xcite the @xmath213 propagator introduced here also corresponds to that of a screened interaction ( see section  [ sec : screening ] ) , thereby avoiding any possible infrared divergence associated with perturbative expansion based on bare coulomb interactions . however , the screening associated with @xmath213 is from the ks particles and thus keeps the same form no matter how many orders one wishes to include .",
    "this is different from that of hedin s where the expression of @xmath812 in terms of the electron green s function changes with the order included .",
    "the other difference between the proposed approach and reference   is that the udf proposed here depends on @xmath131 , a function of three spatial variables ( and possibly with one additional time variable ) , while the method of reference   expresses via @xmath812 the electron self energy as a functional of the green s function , a function of six spatial variables ( and possibly with two additional time variables ) .",
    "it is well known that a loopwise expansion may also be viewed as an @xmath814 expansion  @xcite , that is , an expansion of quantum - mechanical effects . by first integrating out the fermionic degrees of freedom completely ,",
    "the proposed method is an expansion of bosonic loops formed by @xmath213 propagators associated with the auxiliary field @xmath34 .",
    "the @xmath34 field describes the potential produced by electron density fluctuations around @xmath5 .",
    "since the ground state charge density @xmath5 captures the full quantum information of the ground state thanks to the hk theorem , one anticipates a weaker quantum effect associated with the auxiliary @xmath34 field than with the fermionic field .",
    "this makes the auxiliary @xmath34 field a suitable candidate for loop ( or quantum effect ) expansion , the approach pursued in this paper .",
    "finally , let us remark on the issue of convexity .",
    "the full @xmath64 $ ] is supposed to be convex ,  @xcite thus guaranteeing a unique solution without any local minima when searching for the minimum of @xmath64 $ ] . however , in real computations only a finite number of terms of the effective action can be kept .",
    "this approximate / truncated expression may not warrant convexity and thus it is not guaranteed to be free of local minima while numerically searching for the ground state density @xmath5 ( or thermal averaged density @xmath9 at finite temperature ) . in the near future , we plan to implement numerically the methods presented in this paper , and will describe in a separate publication the results obtained as well as the investigation on the issue of convexity .",
