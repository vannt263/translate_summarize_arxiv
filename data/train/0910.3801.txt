    "in 1935 yukawa introduced a virtual particle , now called the pion , to account for the nuclear force@xcite , which bounds protons and neutrons in nuclei . since then the nucleon - nucleon ( @xmath0 ) interaction has extensively been investigated at low energies both theoretically and experimentally .",
    "[ fig : potential ] , shows modern @xmath0 potentials , which are characterized by the following features@xcite . at long distances ( @xmath1 fm )",
    "there exists weak attraction , which is well understood and is dominated by the one pion exchange ( ope ) . at medium distances ( 1 fm @xmath2 2 fm ) , contributions from the exchange of multi - pions and/or heavy mesons such as @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 lead to slightly stronger attraction . at short distances ( @xmath6 1 fm ) , on the other hand , attraction turns into repulsion , and it becomes stronger and stronger as @xmath7 gets smaller , forming the strong repulsive core@xcite .",
    "the repulsive core is essential not only for describing the @xmath0 scattering data , but also for the stability and saturation of atomic nuclei , for determining the maximum mass of neutron stars , and for igniting type ii supernova explosions@xcite .",
    "although the origin of the repulsive core must be related to the quark - gluon structure of nucleons , it remains one of the most fundamental problems in nuclear physics for a long time@xcite .",
    "it is a great challenge for us to derive the nuclear potential including the repulsive core from lattice qcd .",

    "the solid line represents the one pion exchange potential ( opep ) given in eq.[eq : opep],width=207 ]    let me explain the strategy proposed in ref.@xcite in order to extract the @xmath0 potential from lattice qcd .",
    "one first defines a wave function with energy @xmath11 through the equal - time bethe - salpeter amplitude as @xmath12 where @xmath13 , @xmath14 is the 2 nucleon eigen - state of qcd with energy @xmath11 , and @xmath15 is the vacuum state .",
    "more precisely , the 2 nucleon state means a baryon number 2 ( or quark number 6 ) state in qcd .",
    "we here use a simple local nucleon field operator @xmath16 given by @xmath17 where @xmath18 are color , @xmath19 is the spinor and @xmath20 is the flavor indices for quark field @xmath21 , and @xmath22 is the charge conjugation matrix in the spinor space . for large @xmath23",
    ", it is shown@xcite that this wave function behaves as @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the @xmath26-th partial wave of @xmath27 , @xmath28 is the phase shift of the @xmath26-th partial wave , and @xmath29 with the reduced ( nucleon ) mass @xmath30 ( @xmath31 ) .    using the above wave function ,",
    "the corresponding non - local potential @xmath32 is defined though the schrdinger equation as @xmath33 \\varphi_e(\\vec x ) & = & \\int d^3 y u(\\vec x , \\vec y)\\varphi_e(\\vec y ) \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath34 is the free schrdinger operator given by @xmath35 note that @xmath36 does _ not _ depend on energy @xmath11 .",
    "finally one expands @xmath32 in terms of the derivative @xmath37 as @xmath38 explicitly the leading contribution can be written@xcite as @xmath39 where @xmath40 , @xmath41 is the spin - operator of each nucleon , @xmath42 is the angular momentum operator , @xmath43 is the total spin operator , and @xmath44 is the tensor operator .",
    "coefficient functions @xmath45 has the following decomposition in the flavor space : @xmath46 for @xmath47 , where @xmath48 is the pauli matrix in the flavor space of each nucleon .",
    "applying the strategy mentioned in the previous subsection to the quenched lattice qcd calculation , the first result of the @xmath0 potential has been obtained@xcite , as shown in fig.[fig : potentialq ] , which reproduces qualitative features of @xmath0 potentials such as the strong repulsive core at short distance ( @xmath49 fm ) surrounded by an attraction well at medium and long distances .",
    "the solid line in the figure represent the one pion exchange potential given by @xmath50 where @xmath51 mev and @xmath52 mev are taken from the simulation , while the physical value of the @xmath53 coupling constant , @xmath54 , is used .",

    "there exist , however , a few questions to be considered before starting serious investigations of @xmath0 or more generally baryon - baryon potential using lattice qcd technique .    as mentioned before",
    ", the potential extracted from the wave function is in general energy - independent but non - local : @xmath33 \\varphi_e(\\vec x ) & = & \\int d^3 y u(\\vec x , \\vec y)\\varphi_e(\\vec y ) .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this energy independent non - local potential is equivalent to the local but energy dependent potential , @xmath57 , defined by @xmath33 \\varphi_e(\\vec x ) & = & v_e(\\vec x)\\varphi_e(\\vec x ) .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the 1st question to our strategy is how @xmath58 depends on energy @xmath11 of the wave function @xmath59 .",
    "the potential in fig.[fig : potentialq ] , which is obtained at @xmath56 , can reproduce the correct phase shift at @xmath56 ( scattering length ) by construction .",
    "if @xmath58 were strongly dependent on the energy @xmath11 , it would not be so useful : it may not reproduce the correct phase shift at @xmath60 .",
    "the energy dependence of @xmath57 has been investigated in quenched qcd . in fig.[fig : apbc ] the singlet @xmath0 potentials are compared between @xmath56 mev and @xmath55 mev@xcite . for @xmath56 mev , the periodic boundary condition ( pbc ) is used , while the anti - periodic boundary condition ( apbc ) for @xmath55 mev .",
    "fluctuations of data with apbc at large distances ( @xmath61 fm ) are mainly caused by contaminations from excited states , together with statistical errors .",
    "a non - trivial part of the potentials at @xmath62 fm , on the other hand , are less affected by such contaminations . as seen from the figure , the @xmath0 potentials are almost identical between @xmath56 mev and @xmath55 mev .",
    "this shows that the potential obtained from our strategy is useful at low energy at least below 50 mev at this pion mass ( @xmath63 mev ) in quenched qcd",
    ". it will be important to see if this conclusion holds for lighter pion mass in full qcd .",
    "the second question is the operator dependence of the potential . if the wave function were defined in terms of different @xmath64 other than @xmath65 as @xmath66 one would obtain the different potential : @xmath67 .",
    "our choice of @xmath16 correspond to a particular choice of the nucleon effective field theory defined by @xmath68 since no field dependence appears at leading order in the nucleon effective theory , one expects that operator dependence is also weak at low energy in qcd .",
    "this expectation , however , will have to be explicitly checked in numerical simulations .",
    ", @xmath69 and @xmath70 are used.,width=207 ]    now i list some challenges of lattice qcd , which are relevant in nuclear physics .    1",
    ".   full qcd calculations at physical quark masses are definitely important and one of the most difficult challenges in lattice qcd .",
    "once full qcd configurations are generated at physical quark mass in sufficiently large boxes , one can try to investigate several interesting quantities in nuclear physics .",
    "for example , one can construct a deuteron on the lattice , or can extract realistic @xmath0 potentials from lattice qcd .",
    "one can also make real predictions for hyperon interaction from lattice qcd .",
    "calculations of more complicated quantities are also challenges in lattice qcd",
    ". not only the central part of potentials but also more complicated structures of potentials such as the tensor force or the @xmath71 force should be extracted from lattice qcd .",
    "the more advanced challenge in this category is to determine the 3 body force among nucleons , which can hardly be determined experimentally .",
    "although one can extract the 3 body force from scattering states , it is also a great challenge to construct the bound state of 3 nucleons such as triton or helium 3 on the lattice .",
    "the lattice qcd may supply inputs for determinations of nuclei structures and inputs for the equation of state inside super nova or neutron star .",
    "finally we still need some theoretical understandings for the repulsive core of the @xmath0 potential .    in the following",
    "i will report some activities related to challenges in lattice qcd listed above .       as a function of @xmath72 at @xmath73 fm and @xmath74 fm .",

    "the minimum pion mass in this calculation is @xmath76 mev , and @xmath77 is always satisfied for the spatial extension @xmath78 .",
    "the overall scale , the light quark mass and the strange quark mass are fixed by @xmath70 , @xmath79 and @xmath69 .",
    "the agreement between lattice qcd and experiment is excellent , as can be seen from the figure .",
    "it is also reported that the pion mass can be smaller than 160 mev in the 2 + 1 flavor full qcd simulations at one lattice spacing @xmath73 fm@xcite .",
    "fig.[fig;mpi ] shows the pion mass squired divided by the @xmath80 quark mass , @xmath81 , as a function of @xmath72 , where black solid circles are previous results from cp - pacs / jlqcd collaborations@xcite obtained at heavier quark masses , while red solid circles are new ones from ref.@xcite . as quark mass decreases , this ratio increasingly deviates from the straight line obtained from the fit with black circles .",
    "this behavior suggests an existence of the chiral logarithm predicted by the chiral perturbation theory .",
    "note however that @xmath82 in this calculation , where the finite size effect might be sizable at the lightest quark mass . to reduce the magnitude of the finite size effect less than a % level ,",
    "simulations on larger volume , @xmath83 fm , with @xmath84 mev ( @xmath85 ) , are begun by this group .",

    "an example is given in fig.[fig : nnpotentail_full ] , where thesingle central potential @xmath86 and the triplet effective central potential @xmath87 are plotted as a function of @xmath7 at @xmath88 mev@xcite . by comparing this figure with fig.[fig : fig - potential ] , one notices that much stronger repulsive core than the quenced case is observed for the potentials in full qcd .",

    "this means that the neglect of the tensor potential in the previous calculation@xcite does not lead to large systematic errors in the determination of the potential .",
    "it is interesting to observe that the tensor potential seems have no repulsive core , and this property is consistence with the estimation to the tensor potential in ref.@xcite . in fig.[fig : tensor_mass ] , @xmath79 dependence of the tensor potential is shown .",
    "as seen form the figure , the attraction of the tensor force becomes stronger as the pion mass decreases .",
    "one may expect that the tensor force becomes strong enough at @xmath105 mev to have a bound state , deuteron .       in the @xmath8 channel at @xmath106 mev ( red circles ) and @xmath107 mev ( green squares ) .",
