    "computed tomography ( ct ) is widely used for clinical diagnosis . in classical ct applications",
    "it is assumed that projection data are obtained over all angular ranges .",
    "for example , an exact reconstruction requires a consecutive @xmath0 or 180@xmath1+fan angle scans for parallel or fan beam reconstruction , respectively @xcite . for limited angle scans ,",
    "however , the projection data will cover an angular range of less than @xmath0 .",
    "a limited - angle scan is used because of the large object size @xcite , large - pitch helical ct @xcite , and restricted scanning @xcite . in interventional imaging with c - arm ct ,",
    "the limited angle acquisition is a commonly used protocol due to the hardware limitations .",
    "since limited angular scanning provides only a small subset of complete projection data , the use of a conventional filtered - back projection ( fbp ) algorithm generally produces images with heavy directional artifacts .",
    "therefore , many studies have been proposed to compensate for artifacts in limited - angle ct images .",
    "several iterative reconstruction algorithms such as singular value decomposition , wavelet decomposition @xcite , and reprojection have been developed .",
    "inspired by the success of compressed sensing ( cs ) algorithm in a sparse - view ct @xcite , many cs - based methods have also been proposed in limited - angle ct . a representative cs - based algorithm is pocs with total variation minimization @xcite .",
    "although these algorithms are good in restoring the localized artifacts or disturbances , these algorithms have not been successful in correcting globalized artifact patterns in the ct image from a limited angle acquisition .",
    "in addition , the cs - based methods require a large amount of iterative computation . therefore , cs - based methods need to improve image quality and reconstruction time .    recently ,",
    "deep learning algorithms using convolutional neural network ( cnn ) show successful results in computer vision applications including image classification @xcite , denoising @xcite and segmentation @xcite .",
    "some studies have tried to use the deep learning algorithms for image reconstruction problems . in the ct area , kang et al @xcite proposed a wavelet - domain deep learning network for denoising for low - dose ct and showed the promising results by winning second place in the aapm low - dose grand challenge .",
    "jin et al @xcite and han et al @xcite independently proposed multi - scale residual learning network for sparse view ct reconstruction . recently , the first applications of cnn appeared for limited angle tomography @xcite .",
    "however , the cnn in @xcite used only three layers and has not been explicitly designed to correct for the directional artifacts in the limited angle tomography .    by extending our prior work @xcite , here we propose a novel multi - scale wavelet - domain residual learning network for limited - angle ct reconstruction . in particular ,",
    "the network is designed in a directional wavelet transform domain to exploit the directional property of the limited angle artifacts .",
    "in addition , instead of directly learning the artifact - free image , our network is designed as a residual network that estimates the artifact directly in the wavelet domain . to take into account the globally distributed artifacts ,",
    "a multi - resolution network architecture was used , inspired by @xcite .",
    "once the wavelet domain residual is estimated , artifact - free wavelet coefficients are estimated by subtracting the residuals , after which the wavelet recomposition is performed to obtain the full resolution image .",
    "numerical results confirmed the proposed wavelet domain deep residual learning exceeds the existing methods in image quality and reconstruction time .",
    "limited angle ct and ( b ) their corresponding spectra.,width=302 ]    $ ] and the associated vectors .",
    "( b ) the corresponding missing frequency region.,width=302 ]    figure [ fig : spectrum ] shows spectral analysis for limited angle ct artifact images that correspond to the difference between the full view and limited view reconstruction .",
    "specifically , fig .",
    "[ fig : spectrum](a ) shows the @xmath2 limited angle artifact image corresponding to the scanning trajectory in fig .  [",
    "fig : angle](a ) , and fig .",
    "[ fig : spectrum](b ) show their corresponding spectra . despite different image contents , the spectral components of the artifacts have similar directional characteristics since the spectral components of the artifacts are determined by the missing angle .",
    "this phenomenon can be analyzed using the spectrum of limited - angle reconstruction .",
    "the fourier slice theorem can show the missing frequency bands especially for parallel beam geometry . for general scanning geometry , the katsevich formula @xcite can be used to analyze this . here , we consider 2-d fanbeam scanning geometry of objects within a field of view @xmath3 .",
    "then , for a given a filtering direction @xmath4 and the x - ray source angle between @xmath5 and @xmath6 , the katsevich integral @xmath7 at @xmath8 can be represented as follows @xcite : @xmath9 here , @xmath10 is the fourier transform of the image @xmath11 and @xmath12 \\label{eq : sigma_fourier }   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath13 is the vector connecting the x - ray source at @xmath14 and the reconstruction position @xmath15 ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : angle](a ) ) . the filtering direction @xmath4 is often set to @xmath16 .",
    "note that is identical to the inverse fourier transform if @xmath17 . this can be achieved in a full scanning geometry because , for any @xmath8 , we can find @xmath18 and @xmath19 such that @xmath20 .",
    "however , with limited angle scanning , there exist frequency @xmath21 such that @xmath22 , providing @xmath23 .",
    "given the limited scanning geometry in fig .",
    "[ fig : angle](a ) , for reconstructing the pixel on the isocenter , the @xmath21 vectors between the red and blue dashed lines results in @xmath22 .",
    "in fact , this corresponds to the missing frequency region described in fig .",
    "[ fig : angle](b ) , resulting in an elongated artifact along y - direction .",
    "the missing frequency region depends on @xmath15 , which is why we have additional components in fig .",
    "[ fig : spectrum](b ) , but we can still see that the general directional characteristics of the artifacts are similar .",
    "this suggests design guidelines for the deep network .",
    "first , in limited angle tomography , the artifacts , even if the artifact - free images are drastically different from each other , are similar to each other .",
    "this means that learning the artifact is easier than learning artifact - free original images .",
    "secondly , the artifacts have a strong directional characteristic so that the learning on the directional wavelet domain is preferred to the original image domain . finally , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : spectrum](a ) , the artifacts are distributed globally , so the network should have large receptive field .",
    "inspired by these observations , we proposed a multi - scale wavelet domain residual learning network for limited - angle tomography .      specifically , ct reconstruction images are first decomposed using non - decimated redundant directional wavelet transform , called contour transformation @xcite . the contourlet transformation performs a multiscale directional decomposition of an image . here , the image is divided into high frequency components and low - frequency components , and the directional filter banks are applied to the divided frequency components . more specifically , when @xmath24 denotes the number of multiscale decomposition stage , the number of channels in directional decomposition is @xmath25 .",
    "we used four stage of multiscale decomposition .",
    "the total number of channels in a wavelet domain is therefore @xmath26 .",
    "then , we developed a wavelet domain deep residual network by modifying the u - net @xcite .",
    "the cnn architecture is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_architecture ] . a basic operation , a blue arrow in fig . [ fig_architecture ] , consists of @xmath27 convolutions followed by a rectified linear unit ( relu ) and batch normalization .",
    "the u - net architecture consists of a contracting path and an expansive path . in the contracting path",
    ", @xmath28 max pooling operation follows after two basic operations .",
    "after @xmath28 max pooling operation , a number of channels is doubled .",
    "in contrast , @xmath28 average unpooling operation is used in the expansive path instead of @xmath28 max pooling operation .",
    "a skip and concatenation operation , represented by violet arrows in fig .",
    "[ fig_architecture ] , directly concatenates the results in the contracting path and the results in the expansive path .",
    "this multi - scale deep network structure in u - net is shown to increase the receptive field so that it can effectively capture the globally distributed artifacts as the limited angle artifacts @xcite .",
    "once the artifact is estimated using contourlet domain u - net , then artifact - free wavelet coefficients are estimated by subtracting the residuals , after which the wavelet recomposition is performed to obtain the full resolution image .",
    "we used nine sets of real projection data from aapm low - dose ct grand challenge .",
    "the provided data sets are acquired in helical ct , so we rebinned the projection data from the helical ct to @xmath29 angular scan fan - beam ct .",
    "the @xmath30 artifact free images are reconstructed using full - angle fan - beam projection data .",
    "in limited angle experiments , only @xmath2 or @xmath31 angular scan were used to reconstruct limited - angle ct images .",
    "every reconstruction process used traditional fbp algorithm .",
    "eight sets out of nine data sets were used for network training .",
    "the remaining set was used for validation .",
    "we developed the proposed network using matconvnet toolbox in matlab r2015a environment @xcite .",
    "gtx 1080 graphics processing unit and intel core i7 - 4790 central processing unit were used for research .",
    "the network is trained by 256@xmath32 256 size randomly selected patches .",
    "then , the learned filtered are used to process 512@xmath32512 images at the test phase .",
    "training time lasted about 24 hours .",
    "stochastic gradient reduction was used to train the network .",
    "the number of epochs was 150 .",
    "the initial learning rate was @xmath33 , which gradually dropped to @xmath34 .",
    "the regularization parameter was @xmath35 .      in order to investigate the optimal nature of the proposed network",
    ", we compared the proposed method with two different neural networks .",
    "first network is a single - resolution residual learning cnn network .",
    "the first network eliminates the artifact in the image domain and uses single - resolution network architecture in fig . [",
    "fig_ref_networks](a ) .",
    "the second network is a multi - resolution residual learning cnn network as shown in fig . [",
    "fig_ref_networks](b ) .",
    "the second network directly uses the ct image instead of decomposed wavelet coefficients .",
    "the reconstruction results by fbp , tv , baseline network and the proposed method for 120@xmath36 scanning are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_results120 ] .",
    "the single resolution cnn performs better than the tv approaches , but the internal and outer area are incorrectly recovered . on the other hand ,",
    "the multi - resolution cnn is significantly better than the single resolution cnn . however , there are remaining ghost artifacts beneath the patient bed , and the internal structures are reconstructed blurry . the proposed multi - resolution wavelet domain residual network allowed for a clear reconstruction and effectively compensated the artifacts of ct compared to the other methods . comparing the entire image ,",
    "the global artifacts are removed and the boundary of body is clearly recovered in the proposed method .",
    "the enlarged images , the yellow boxes in fig .",
    "[ fig_results120 ] , show that the proposed method eliminates small local artifacts and reconstructs the detail structures .",
    "it is remarkable that the proposed method successfully preserves the detail edge structures while compensating for heavy directional and blurring artifacts .",
    "moreover , the computation time of the proposed method is about 0.34 sec / slice .",
    "it is about 10 times faster than the tv method which takes @xmath37 sec / slice as a computation time .    for the 150@xmath36 scanning experiments in fig .",
    "[ fig_results150 ] , similar reconstruction behaviours can be observed , although the visual difference between the multi - resolution cnn and multi - resolution wavelet domain cnn is not as significant as for the 120@xmath36 cases .",
    "the enlarged images , the yellow boxes in fig .",
    "[ fig_results150 ] , show that wavelet domain multi - resolution cnn has less artifacts than the image domain multi - resolution cnn . for small missing angles , however , both the image domain and the wavelet domain multi - resolution residual network exhibited excellent subjective performances .    in table",

    "all deep learning approaches showed better performance than the tv method .",

    "in this work , we proposed a novel deep residual learning network for ct reconstruction with a limited angle projection data .",
