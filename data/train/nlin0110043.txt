    "one of the main points of interest is to understand under which circumstances the quantisation of a graph generates a spectrum which follows random matrix theory ( rmt ) and when to expect deviations thereof .",
    "general statements can , however , only be made in the limit of large matrices and we thus face the problem of constructing larger and larger graphs representing the same classical dynamics at least in the limit of infinite network size .",
    "we will offer a simple and straightforward way to define such families of graphs in this paper .",

    "iterating this procedure we construct an infinite family of digraphs @xmath4 with in general increasing number of vertices .",
    "we will show that all graphs in a given family defined in this way have the same topological and metric properties .",
    "in particular , the sets of periodic orbits and the non - zero eigenvalues of the adjacency and transition matrices are identical for digraphs of such a family",

    "line - graph families thus form a set of graphs whose size increases with @xmath5 but whose ` classical ' dynamics is fixed . the semiclassical limit of the system is then obtained by increasing the index @xmath5 . the entire family of graphs ,",
    "corresponding to the same classical dynamics , is uniquely determined by a given initial graph .",

    "their adjacency matrices are @xmath45 @xmath46 the dots represent here entries being equal to zero . to introduce a stochastic process on @xmath43 we may choose equal probabilities of staying at vertex 1 and of going from 1 to 2 .",
    "this corresponds to the transition matrix @xmath47 the transition matrices @xmath48 can be obtained from @xmath49 by replacing 1 s by @xmath50 s in all rows in which there are two entries equal to unity .",
    "the resulting matrices are stochastic .",
    "let @xmath51 denote the number of vertices of a digraph @xmath0 .",

    "we shall start this section by stating basic properties of the line - digraph construction .",
    "if @xmath0 is a strongly connected digraph not isomorphic to a cycle , then the number of its bonds is larger than the number of its vertices , so @xmath57 observe that @xmath3 is also a strongly connected digraph different from a cycle .",
    "the above statements allow us to draw an important conclusion :    for any strongly connected digraph @xmath0 , not isomorphic to a cycle , its line - graph family @xmath4 contains infinite number of different digraphs and @xmath58    in the following we analyze topological and dynamical properties of line - graph families @xmath4 with associate stochastic markov processes .",
    "we start by introducing periodic orbits on a digraph .    a sequence of @xmath59 vertices @xmath60 such , that @xmath61 and @xmath62 is called a periodic orbit of period @xmath59 on the digraph @xmath0 .",
    "the set of periodic orbits on @xmath0 is denoted by @xmath63 .",
    "a periodic orbit is called _ primitive _ , if it is not a repetition of another periodic orbit .",
    "it is obvious from the definition of a line - graph that there is a one - to - one relation between periodic orbits of @xmath0 and @xmath3 , that is , @xmath64 iff @xmath65 .",
    "the set of periodic orbits @xmath66 is thus isomorphic to @xmath63 and the map @xmath67 between periodic orbits of @xmath0 and @xmath3 is bijective and conserves the period of the orbit .",
    "this implies that the topological entropy measuring the exponential of growth of the number of periodic orbits with their period @xmath59 is the same for all generations of the line - graph family .",
    "the four graphs presented in fig .",
    "[ fifib ] may serve as an example .",
    "all the graphs @xmath52 have only one primitive orbit of periods 1 , 2 , 3 and 4 .    next , we define the _ stability factor _ or",
    "_ amplitude _ of a periodic orbit , @xmath68 of a graph @xmath0 with associated stochastic process @xmath26 as @xmath69 the amplitude @xmath70 is the probability of staying on the orbit @xmath71 after @xmath59 iterations of the stochastic process , where @xmath59 is the period of @xmath71 .",
    "one obtains for the stability factor of periodic orbits on the line - graph @xmath72 and the last identity follows from @xmath73 we thus obtain that the mapping @xmath74 leaves the stability factors of periodic orbits invariant , that is , @xmath75    the observations made above on the invariance of topological and dynamical properties under the line - graph construction can be put in a more general form .",
    "the topological entropy of a graph may be determined by the logarithm of the largest modulus of eigenvalue of the adjacency matrix of the graph . denoting the characteristic polynomial of the adjacency matrix by @xmath76",
    "one obtains :    [ thsam ] the spectrum of the adjacency matrix of the line - graph , @xmath23 , is identical to the spectrum of @xmath30 and an appropriate number of eigenvalues equal to zero , that is , @xmath77    proof : we start by the following lemma .",
    "[ letam ] the traces of powers of the adjacency matrix of a line - graph , @xmath23 , are equal to the trace of the same power of @xmath30 , that is , @xmath78    since all entries of any adjacency matrix are equal to 0 or to 1 we have @xmath79 .",
    "one thus obtains @xmath80 @xmath81 @xmath82 let @xmath83 denote the coefficients of the characteristic polynomial of @xmath30 in the descending order @xmath84 by means of the newton formulas the coefficients @xmath83 may be expressed in terms of the traces @xmath85 as @xcite @xmath86 lemma  [ letam ] shows that the first @xmath51 coefficients of the polynomial @xmath87 in front of the largest powers of @xmath88 are equal to those of @xmath89 .",
    "the rest of the coefficients of @xmath87 vanish , the characteristic polynomials of @xmath23 and @xmath30 differ thus only by a factor @xmath90 ; this completes the proof of the theorem  [ thsam ] .    a relation similar to ( [ eqcpa ] ) holds for the characteristic polynomial of @xmath26 @xmath91 one obtains :    [ thetm ] the spectrum of the transition matrix of a line - graph , @xmath35 consists of the spectrum of @xmath26 and an appropriate number of eigenvalues equal to zero , so @xmath92    proof is analogous to this of the theorem  [ thsam ] , since a lemma equivalent to the lemma  [ letam ] holds :    traces of any power of the transition matrix of a line - graph @xmath35 are equal to the trace of the same power of @xmath26 , that is @xmath93    the derivation follows the arguments in the proof of lemma  [ letam ] using the property  ( [ eqpat ] ) instead .",
    "theorem  [ thetm ] demonstrates that the stochastic dynamics on the line - graph @xmath3 is equivalent to the original markov process on @xmath0 .",
    "we would therefore expect that dynamical quantities like the metric entropy of the stochastic process are invariant under the line - graph iteration as well .",
    "the metric entropy depends on the choice of the invariant measure , so we need to consider invariant measures first .",
    "the action of @xmath26 on left vectors represents the evolution of measures .",
    "one obtains    [ lelvt ] if @xmath94 is a left eigenvector of @xmath26 corresponding to the eigenvalue @xmath88 , then @xmath95 is the left eigenvector of @xmath35 to the same eigenvalue .",
    "proof : let us calculate @xmath96 where we have used  ( [ eqpat ] ) and the fact that @xmath94 is the left eigenvector of @xmath26 , @xmath97    the invariant measures of a markov chain on @xmath0 is given by the left eigenvectors of @xmath26 with eigenvalue 1 . according to lemma  [ lelvt ] each invariant measure of @xmath26 defines the corresponding invariant measure of @xmath35 . assuming that @xmath98 is an invariant measure of @xmath26 , the metric entropy of the corresponding markov process @xcite reads @xmath99 the metric entropy of the markov process on @xmath3 with respect to the corresponding invariant measure @xmath100",
    "is then given as ( see lemma  [ lelvt ] ) @xmath101 @xmath102 we thus find that the metric entropy of a stochastic process defined by @xmath35 based on the invariant measure @xmath103 is indeed identical to the metric entropy of a process @xmath26 based on the invariant measure @xmath98 , that is , @xmath104    the results stated in this section show that the topological and metric properties of the dynamics on a given graph @xmath0 and the corresponding line - graph @xmath3 are identical .",
    "in fact we have proven by recurrence that all digraphs in the family @xmath4 have the same set of periodic orbits , the same non - vanishing spectrum of the adjacency matrices @xmath105 and of the transition matrices @xmath106 , as well as the same topological and metric entropy .",
    "so far we have considered stochastic processes on digraphs defined by a transition matrix @xmath26 .",
    "recently , kottos and smilansky @xcite proposed to study unitary propagation on graphs and to link the spectral properties of the unitary dynamics to an underlying markov process on this graph .",
    "generalising their approach we may consider the following definition of quantising a markov chain :    1 .",
    "a digraph @xmath0 is called _ quantisable _ if there exists a unitary matrix @xmath107 with the same zero - pattern as the adjacency matrix @xmath19 .",
    "a stochastic transition matrix @xmath26 is called _ quantisable _ if there exists a unitary matrix @xmath107 such that @xmath108    the matrix @xmath107 represents a one - step propagator , which describes unitary time evolution in a finite hilbert space of dimension @xmath51 .",
    "note that not all stochastic matrices @xmath26 can be quantised in the sense described above .",
    "the stochastic matrices , for which a unitary matrix exists fulfilling eqn .",
    "( [ eqqtc ] ) are called _",
    "unistochastic _ @xcite .",
    "the matrix @xmath26 in ( [ eqqtc ] ) is by construction bistochastic , that is , the sum over the matrix elements in each row and column of @xmath26 equals @xmath109 .",
    "however , for @xmath110 bistochasticity is not a sufficient condition for unistochasticity ( see e.g. @xcite ) , and it is in general hard to decide whether a given bistochastic matrix is unistochastic or not . even necessary and sufficient conditions for the pattern of unitary matrices are not known , see @xcite for some necessary conditions .",
    "on the other hand , the quantisation of a unistochastic matrix @xmath26 is not unique . for every matrix @xmath107 fulfilling ( [ eqqtc ] ) , the set of unitary matrices of the form @xmath111 with @xmath112 and @xmath113 being diagonal unitary matrices , are also quantisations of @xmath26 .",
    "one can therefore introduce a @xmath114 parameter family of unitary matrices corresponding to the same classical stochastic process defined by @xmath26 . by choosing the phases in @xmath112 and @xmath113",
    "randomly with respect to the uniform measure on the interval @xmath115 one can define an ensemble of unitary matrices linked to the transition matrix @xmath26 as proposed in @xcite , also called a _ unitary stochastic ensemble ( use ) _ of @xmath26 .",
    "the transition matrix @xmath26 is stochastic and its largest eigenvalue @xmath116 is equal to unity @xcite .",
    "it was conjectured in @xcite that the statistical properties of spectra of unitary matrices in a given @xmath117 after ensemble average are linked to the _ spectral gap _",
    "@xmath118 of @xmath26 , where @xmath119 is the subleading eigenvalue of @xmath26 .",
    "the conjecture in @xcite implies in particular the following    [ cormt ] let @xmath120 be a family of unistochastic transition matrices of dimension @xmath1 ; the corresponding unitary stochastic ensembles follow random matrix theory ( rmt ) in the limit @xmath121 if the spectral gap is bounded from below , that is , if @xmath122 in this limit .",
    "it has been shown in the last section , that the spectral gap remains constant for stochastic processes generated by line - graph iterations .",
    "the conjecture thus implies that unistochastic ensembles derived from quantisable line - graph families @xmath4 follow rmt in the limit @xmath123 ( assuming @xmath0 is a strongly connected digraph not isomorphic to a cycle ) if the spectral gap of the markov chain on the initial graph @xmath124 .",
    "as mentioned above not all stochastic processes on digraphs are quantisable in the sense above and it is in general hard to decide whether a given bistochastic transition matrix is unistochastic or not or even whether a given graph @xmath0 is quantisable . surprisingly , life becomes much easier when considering line - graphs .",
    "necessary and sufficient conditions for the quantisability of @xmath4 can actually be given and will be discussed in the next section .",
    "we start by giving an answer to the question whether a given graph @xmath125 is the line - graph of another graph .",

    "any two columns of @xmath127 are either identical or orthogonal .",
    "it should be noted that a line - graph does in general not specify uniquely its ancestor graph .",
    "this non - uniqueness is caused by sources and sinks , ( that is vertices with only outgoing or incoming edges ) or isolated vertices in the line - graph , see @xcite .",
    "this problem is less relevant for quantisable line - graphs as will be shown later , we will therefore not consider it here further .    an immediate consequence of theorem  [ thldg ] is the following necessary and sufficient condition for a line - graph to be quantisable :    [ codld ] let @xmath125 be a digraph with @xmath1 vertices and @xmath126 be its adjacency matrix .",
    "then @xmath125 is a quantisable line - digraph iff there exist permutation matrices @xmath128 and @xmath129 such that @xmath130 is block - diagonal of the form @xmath131 where @xmath132 is the square matrix of dimension @xmath5 containing only @xmath109 s and @xmath133    proof : follows directly from theorem  [ thldg ] . the identical rows ( and columns ) of @xmath127 form submatrices of @xmath127 containing only @xmath109 s .",

    "we showed that all digraphs in such a family indeed have the same set of periodic orbits and that furthermore the non - zero eigenvalues of the adjacency matrices of graphs from the same family are identical .",
    "next we considered stochastic markov processes on a digraph and defined the corresponding process on its line - graph .",
    "we demonstrated that both processes have the same metric entropy and the transition matrices describing the processes have the same non - zero eigenvalues .",
    "the construction of the line - graph family is in fact a method to translate a finite markov processes to a larger space preserving its topological and metric properties .",
    "we gave necessary and sufficient conditions for a line - graph to be quantisable and gave examples of line - graph families @xmath4 which can be quantised for infinitely many @xmath5 .",
    "the line - graph construction thus makes it possible to consider a semiclassical limit of large matrix size for unitary ensembles on graphs with fixed ` classical ' , i.e. stochastic dynamics .",
    "this method complements an idea developed in a previous paper @xcite , in which a semiclassical limit was considered by looking for a specific dynamical system associated with an initial graph .",
    "we would like to stress again that the problem of finding necessary and sufficient conditions for a general bistochastic matrix @xmath237 to be unistochastic is still open @xcite .",
    "such conditions can , however , be given for line - graphs and turn out to be very restrictive .",
    "one way to enlarge the number of graph families with well defined classical limit is to consider unitary matrices @xmath238 and associated transition matrices @xmath239 for which topological and metric properties converge to fixed values in the limit of large matrix sizes @xcite .",
    "quantum maps generated from markov processes on families of line - graphs considered here all display cue statistics in their spectral fluctuations .",
    "these results were observed for families originating from fully connected digraphs ( de bruijn ) , symmetric cycles and bipartite digraphs of the form @xmath229 and @xmath232 .",
    "this behaviour is attributed to the fact that the spectral gap is positive and constant under the line - graph iteration in all cases whereas the number of vertices increases with @xmath5 .",
    "the results thus confirm the conjecture  [ cormt ] , which relates the size of the spectral gap of the classical transition matrix and the spectral statistics of the associated ensemble of random unitary matrices .",
