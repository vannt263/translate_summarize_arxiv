    "since the discovery of hawking radiation , black hole thermodynamics has attracted a lot of interest .",
    "it shows that gravitational systems like black holes can also be thermodynamic systems . not only that , the study of black hole thermodynamics may shed light on the understanding of the theory of quantum gravity .",
    "a consistent theory of quantum gravity should succeed in addressing the thermodynamic nature of black holes .",
    "black holes do not only have the standard thermodynamic quantities , such as temperature and entropy , but also possess abundant phase structures like the hawking - page phase transition@xcite and critical phenomena similar to those in ordinary thermodynamic systems .",
    "especially , it is found that the charged ads black hole may have similar phase transition and critical behavior to that of van der waals liquid / gas system@xcite .",
    "there are also extensive studies on the thermodynamics and @xmath0 criticality of several kinds of black holes in an extended phase space by taking the cosmological constant as pressure@xcite .",
    "in fact , there is another route to explore the relationship between gravitational system and its relevant thermodynamic properties .",
    "it is the framework of horizon thermodynamics proposed by padmanabhan@xcite .",
    "it is shown that einstein s equations for a spherically symmetric spacetime can be written in the form of the first law of thermodynamics : @xmath7 .",
    "this makes the connection between gravity and thermodynamics more closely .",
    "the pressure @xmath8 is the @xmath9 component of energy - momentum tensor . in this case , only two pairs of thermodynamic variables exist , which are the intensive quantities @xmath10 and the extensive quantities @xmath11 . in this framework the thermodynamic properties",
    "are directly related to the gravitational theories under consideration .",
    "the details of matter content are not important and the concrete black hole solutions are also not necessary .",
    "this approach has also been extended to the other theories of gravity , such as lovelock gravity@xcite and hoava - lifshitz theory@xcite . in this framework , we have studied the phase transitions and thermodynamic stabilities of black holes in general relativity and gauss - bonnet gravity@xcite .",
    "recently , in @xcite the authors discussed the phase structures of lovelock black holes in horizon thermodynamics and compared with that in extended phase space with variable cosmological constant .",
    "recently much attention has been focused on the hoava - lifshitz ( hl ) theory@xcite , which is a power counting renormalizable gravity theory and can be regarded as a uv complete candidate for general relativity . the static , spherically symmetric solutions in hl gravity have been obtained in@xcite .",
    "the thermodynamic quantities of topological hl black holes are calculated in @xcite . in @xcite",
    "the authors studied phase transition of charged topological hl black hole with general dynamical parameter @xmath12 and phase transition of kihagias - sfetosos ( ks ) black hole . in @xcite ,",
    "phase transition and scaling behavior of charged hl black holes with @xmath13 were studied . through thermodynamic metrics ,",
    "in @xcite the authors analyzed a unified phase transition of the charged topological hl black hole in the case of @xmath13 .    in this paper",
    ", we will analyze the thermodynamic stability and phase transition of topological hl black holes in the framework of horizon thermodynamics .",
    "the previous studies on phase transition of topological hl black hole all referred to concrete matter fields , such as the electromagnetic field , and considered the detailed - balance condition , @xmath14 .",
    "we do not care about the concrete mater content , which is exactly one advantage of horizon thermodynamics .",
    "also , we do not employ the explicit form of the hl black hole solution . besides , we take general @xmath1 .",
    "it is shown in this paper there are some interesting results which are lack in the usual hl black hole with @xmath15 .",
    "the paper is arranged as follows . in section",
    "ii , we simply review the horizon thermodynamics of hl gravity . in section iii",
    "we will analyze the thermodynamic stability of topological hl black holes .",
    "the @xmath0 criticality of hl black hole is discussed in section iv .",
    "we make some concluding remarks in section v.",
    "the action of hl gravity without the detailed - balance condition is @xcite :    @xmath16    where @xmath17 with @xmath18 the cotten tensor .",
    "@xmath1 , @xmath19 , @xmath12 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 are constant parameters .",
    "@xmath23 stands for the lagrangian of other matter field .    compared with general relativity , there will be the relations for the parameters : [ constants ] c= ,  g= ,  = , where @xmath24 are newton s constant , speed of light and the cosmological constant respectively .    because only for the case with @xmath13 , general relativity can be recovered in the large distance approximation .",
    "we only consider @xmath13 in the following . in this case , from eq.([constants ] ) , one can see that @xmath22 must be negative .",
    "moreover , we will take the natural units : @xmath25 , so @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "@xmath14 is the so - called detailed - balance condition , under which hl gravity turns out to be intimately related to topological gravity in three dimensions and the geometry of the cotton tensor . for the case with @xmath28 ,",
    "hl gravity returns back to general relativity and hl black hole becomes schwarzschild-(a)ds black hole .",
    "below we will consider general values of @xmath1 .",
    "for a static , spherically symmetric black hole , the metric ansatz can be written as [ staticmetric ] ds^2 = -n^2(r)f(r ) dt^2 + + r^2 d_k^2 , where @xmath29 denotes the line element for a two - dimensional einstein space with constant scalar curvature @xmath30 . without loss of generality",
    ", one can take @xmath3 ( spherical / elliptic horizons ) , @xmath31 ( flat horizons ) , and @xmath5 ( hyperbolic horizons ) .    in our work",

    "l_m)/n |_x = x_+ , [ tq ] + v&= & - , + t&= & f(x_+)/4    from the above results , one can see that matter fields do not affect the explicit forms of internal energy @xmath42 and the entropy @xmath43 and @xmath44 . for different matter fields , only the @xmath8 and",
    "@xmath45 have different explicit forms .",
    "however , in the framework of horizon thermodynamics , we do not need the exact expressions of @xmath8 and @xmath45 .",
    "one thing , which should be noted , is that the integration constant @xmath46 in the entropy can not be fixed by some physical considerations . to determine @xmath46 , one has to invoke the quantum theory of gravity as argued in @xcite . for @xmath2 case ,",
    "the area law of the black hole entropy is recovered if setting @xmath47 .",
    "thus , for simplicity , we always set @xmath47 below ( including the cases of @xmath48 ) .",
    "it also should be noted that the pressure @xmath8 defined by eq.([tq ] ) is different from the pressure in the usual thermodynamic systems .",
    "especially , due to the metric ansatz eq.([staticmetric ] ) and energy conditions , the pressure defined in this way may have opposite sign to the pressure in the usual sense@xcite .",
    "for example , electrodynamic field is a kind of positive pressure matter .",
    "however , by eq.([tq ] ) , @xmath49 .",
    "there are also exotic matter , such as dark energy which supports our universe accelerating expansion and the cosmological constant , which may have negative pressure in the usual sense . in horizon thermodynamics , by eq.([tq ] ) they may be positive . because our discussion do not refer to concrete matter content , the cases with positive and negative @xmath8 should both be considered .",
    "one can see that eq.([eom ] ) is in fact an equation of state described by three state parameters @xmath50 , which is [ pt ] p&= & . as noted above",
    ", pressures can be positive or negative , while the entropy and the temperatures of black holes must be positive . from eq.([pt ] ) , we can derive the expression for temperature : [ tp ] t=- . if the maxwell field exists , the pressure @xmath8 is given by p=<0 .",
    "the temperature above becomes t= , which is just the result given in @xcite .",
    "positive temperature and positive entropy are only necessary conditions for hl black hole to be in thermodynamic equilibrium . to be in stable equilibrium",
    ", @xmath51 must be satisfied@xcite . according to general definition , for the topological hl black holes c_v=.|_v=.t|_v=0 , because constant @xmath44 means constant @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "we can only define the heat capacity at constant pressure , which is c_p&=&.|_p=.t|_p + & = & , where @xmath52 is the enthalpy of the system and a(x_+)&= & \\ { k^3 ( ^2 - 1)^2 - 5 k^2 x_+^2 ( ^2 - 1 ) .",
    "+ & + & .x_+^6 ( 3 -16 p)}. moreover , according to the viewpoint of davies@xcite , the divergence of heat capacity means a phase transition happens there .",
    "it is shown in @xcite , when @xmath14 there will be no phase transition for the charged topological hl black holes with @xmath2 and @xmath3 . while there is a second - order phase transition with @xmath5 .    to discuss the global stability of the hl black hole",
    ", we also need to calculate the gibbs free energy , which is defined as g&=&e - ts+pv + & = & - + & -&b(x_+ ) , where b(x_+)=k^2 ( ^2 - 1)+2 k x_+^2+x_+^4 ( 3 -16 p ) .",
    "generally , states with smaller @xmath53 are more thermodynamically stable .",
    "below we will first study the entropy and the temperatures of topological hl black holes with general matter fields in cases of @xmath54 respectively and with general @xmath1 . then the corresponding heat capacity and gibbs free energy are calculated and depicted to analyze thermodynamic stability . in the following we take @xmath55 and @xmath56 for simplicity .      in this case , the temperature is proportional to the horizon radius : t=. obviously , if only @xmath57 , the temperature is positive .",
    "the entropy in this case is s=4 x_+^2 , which is always positive .",
    "the heat capacity at constant pressure is c_p=8 x_+^2 , which is also always positive .",
    "in addition , its value is independent of @xmath8 , namely the matter fields .",
    "so when @xmath2 , the hl black hole is always thermodynamically stable and no phase transition happens .",
    "the gibbs free energy is g=- x_+^3 . because the temperature has to be positive , the gibbs free energy is always negative and monotonically decreases as the horizon radius grows .      in this case",
    ", the entropy becomes [ sk1 ] s=4 . due to the @xmath58 in this expression",
    ", we only need to analyze the positive @xmath1 case .",
    "the results with negative @xmath1 are the same .",
    "black holes , as thermodynamic systems , should have positive entropy .",
    "thus the cases with negative entropy will be excluded from thermodynamic consideration .    from eq.([sk1 ] ) , we find that there are three cases according the values of @xmath1 . when @xmath59 , the black hole entropy is not always positive in the whole range .",
    "only when @xmath60 , the entropy is positive is the lambert function defined by general formula : @xmath61 . ] . when @xmath62 , the black hole entropy is always positive for @xmath63 . and",
    "when @xmath64 , the black hole entropy takes positive values except for an intermediate region where the entropy is negative .",
    "these behaviors have been displayed in fig.[sxk1 ] . due to the term @xmath65 in the black hole entropy ,",
    "all curves cross the point @xmath66 .",
    "we are not interested in the black hole with positive entropy in two disconnected regions .",
    "so we only concern with the hl black hole with @xmath67 .",
    "when @xmath3 , the temperature is [ tkp1 ] t=. its value depends on the relations between @xmath8 and @xmath1 .",
    "we find that there always exist some regions where @xmath68 only if @xmath69 .",
    "we plot the temperatures of hl black hole in fig.[tk1 ] .",
    "interestingly , as shown in fig.2(a ) , for negative pressure and @xmath70 , the temperature of hl black hole exhibits the similar behavior to that of reissner- nordstrm ( rn)-ads black hole . here",
    "the parameter @xmath1 plays the similar role to the electric charge @xmath71 in rn black hole .",
    "however , considering the requirement of positive entropy , only in the regions on the right of the vertical dashed lines is the black hole physical . in fig.2(b ) , we depict the temperature of hl black hole for @xmath72 . in this case",
    ", there are always divergent points due to this term @xmath73 in the denominator of @xmath45 in eq .",
    "( [ tkp1 ] ) .",
    "therefore , only in the regions on the right of the divergent points are the hl black holes with positive temperature physically acceptable . for comparison",
    ", we also depict the curves of @xmath74 in the positive pressure case ( fig .",
    "2(c ) ) . in this case , for @xmath72 the temperature increases monotonically as the horizon radius @xmath38 grows .",
    "thus , the hl black hole , not like its negative pressure counterpart , does not exhibit the critical behavior .",
    "while for @xmath75 , the hl black hole with positive pressure has the similar behavior to the one with negative pressure case .    excluding the regions with negative entropy and negative temperature",

    "the heat capacity @xmath77 is positive for @xmath80 and @xmath81 , while it is negative in the intermediate region @xmath82 .",

    "we also studied the @xmath0 criticality of topological hl black hole in the framework of horizon thermodynamics through the equation of state @xmath142 .",
    "we find that the @xmath0 diagram of topological hl black hole for @xmath3 looks the same as that of van der waals liquid / gas system .",
    "they also have the same critical exponents .",
    "however , the parameter @xmath143 of the two systems is very different .",
    "when @xmath5 , no @xmath0 criticality exists .",
    "but there is a special point called  thermodynamic singularity \" in the @xmath0 diagram , where the isotherms intersect . on the left and right side of the point , the isotherms have",
    "opposite sequence .",
    "this singularity is characterized by @xmath144 . at the  thermodynamic singularity \" ,",
    "the temperature and gibbs free energy are both divergent apart from a special pressure @xmath145 where the temperature and the gibbs free energy are finite .",
    "it may reflect some universality of the thermodynamic behaviors of hl black holes in the framework of horizon thermodynamics .",
    "however , it may miss some peculiarity of the topological hl black holes .",
    "it would be plausible to further study the thermodynamic stability and critical behaviors of the hl black hole with some concrete matter field like electromagnetic field , which may further shed light on the thermodynamic properties of hl black holes .",
