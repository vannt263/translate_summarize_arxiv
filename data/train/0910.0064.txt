    "a caricature of markets , from the point of view of financial engineering , is the following single period asset pricing framework @xcite : there are only two times @xmath0 ( today ) and @xmath1 ( tomorrow ) .",
    "the world at @xmath2 can be in any of @xmath3 states and let @xmath4 be the probability that state @xmath5 occurs .",
    "there are @xmath6 risky assets whose price is one at @xmath0 and is @xmath7 at @xmath2 , @xmath8 if state @xmath9 materializes .",
    "there is also a risk - less asset ( bond ) which also costs one today and pays one tomorrow , in all states .",
    "prices of assets are assumed given at the outset .",
    "portfolios of assets can be built in order to transfer wealth from one state to the other .",
    "a portfolio @xmath10 is a linear combination with weights @xmath11 , @xmath12 on the riskless and risky assets .",
    "the value of the portfolio at @xmath0 is @xmath13 which is the price the investor has to pay to buy @xmath14 at @xmath0 .",
    "the return of the portfolio , i.e. the difference between its value at @xmath2 and at @xmath0 , is given by @xmath15    the construction of arbitrage pricing theory relies on the following steps      summarizing , the logic of financial engineering is : assuming that markets are arbitrage free , the price of any contingent claim , no matter how exotic , can be computed .",
    "this involves some consideration of risk , as long as markets are incomplete .",
    "but if one can assumes that markets are complete , then prices can be computed in a manner which is completely independent of risk .",
    "note indeed that the probability distribution over @xmath9 plays no role at all in the above construction .",
    "it is also worth to remark that asset return @xmath16 do not depend , by construction , on the type of portfolios which are traded in the market .    a complete",
    ", arbitrage free market is the best of all possible worlds .",
    "when markets expand in both complexity and volumes , one is tempted to argue that this is indeed a good approximation of real financial markets .",
    "why are markets arbitrage free ? because , according to the standard folklore , otherwise `` everybody would jump in [ ... ] affecting the prices of the security '' @xcite .",
    "now let us assume that prices are affected not only when `` everybody jumps in '' but anytime someone trades , even though the effect is very small , for individual trades . in the simplified picture of the market we shall discuss below",
    ", prices depend on the balance between demand and supply ; if demand is higher than supply return is positive , otherwise it is negative .",
    "demand comes from either an exogenous state contingent process or is generated from the derivative market in order to match contracts .    here",
    "derivatives are simply contracts which deliver a particular amount of asset in a given state ( e.g. an umbrella if it rains , nothing otherwise ) .",
    "even if markets are severely incomplete , financial institutions  which we shall call banks for short in what follows  will match the demand for a particular derivative contract if that turns out to be profitable , i.e. if the revenue they extract from it exceeds a risk premium .    competition in the financial industry brings on one side to smaller risk premia and on the other to a wider diversity of financial instruments being marketed in the stock market .",
    "these two effects are clearly related because the increase in financial complexity  measured by the number of different financial instruments  makes the market less incomplete and hence it reduces the spread in the prices of derivatives .",
    "when financial complexity is large enough the market becomes complete because each claim can be replicated by a portfolio of bond and derivatives . beyond this point",
    ", there is an unique value for the price of each derivative , which is the one computed from apt .",
    "though the story is different , the conclusion seems to be the same : efficient , arbitrage - free , complete markets .",
    "the holy grail of financial engineering .    actually , the road to efficient , arbitrage - free",
    ", complete markets can be plagued by singularities which arise upon increasing financial complexity .",
    "we shall illustrate this point within the stylized one period framework discussed above .",
    "take the one period framework as above , and let @xmath4 be the probability that state @xmath5 materializes .",
    "imagine there is a single risky asset and a risk - less asset .",
    "again we shall implicitly take discounted processes , so we set the return of the risk - less security to zero .",
    "the price of the risky asset is @xmath1 at @xmath0 and @xmath27 , in state @xmath9 .",
    "however , rather than defining at the outset the return of the asset in each state , we assume it is fixed by the law of demand and supply .",
    "banks develop and issue financial instruments . in this simplified world , a financial instrument is a pair @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the cost payed to the bank at @xmath0 by the investor and @xmath30 is the amount of risky asset it delivers in state @xmath9 at @xmath2 .",
    "we imagine there is a demand @xmath31 units of derivative @xmath32 if the price is less than @xmath33 and zero otherwise . ] for each of @xmath34 possible financial instruments @xmath35 , @xmath36 .",
    "the return of the asset at @xmath2 in each state @xmath9 is given by @xmath37 where @xmath38 is assumed to arise from investors excess demand whereas the second term is generated by banks hedging derivative contracts ) .",
    "the most transparent one , for our purposes , is that of assuming a finite liquidity of the underlying asset in a market maker setting such as that of ref . @xcite . between the time ( @xmath0 ) when derivatives are signed and the maturity ( @xmath2 ) , banks have to accumulate a position @xmath39 in the underlying for each contract @xmath32 they have sold ( @xmath40 ) . at the same time",

    "rather , banks will sell derivatives if the expected profit is large enough , and will not sell it otherwise .",

    "even if the prices @xmath33 were fixed on the basis of an equivalent martingale measure @xmath18 , as in section [ dynpricing ] , it is not possible , for banks , to eliminate risk altogether .",
    "financial markets are quite complex , with all sorts of complicated financial instruments .",

    "actually , @xmath67 encodes the risk premium that banks require for trading derivatives and hence should depend on the volatility of the realized returns @xmath45 and on the degree of market completeness . while keeping this in mind",
    ", we will consider @xmath67 as an independent parameter with the idea that it decreases from positive values when the volatility of the market decreases or on the route to market completeness .",

    "we presented here a very stylized description of an arbitrage free market , showing that also whithin the ideal context of apt the uncontrolled proliferation of financial intruments can lead to large fluctuations and instability in the market .",
    "interestingly , within our simplified model , the proliferation of financial instruments drives the market through a transition to a state where volumes of trading rapidly expand and saturate investors demand .    in order for these kind of models to be more realistic ,",
    "some improvements certainly are needed .",
    "for instance , the demand for derivatives can be derived from a state dependent utility function for consumption at @xmath2 .",
    "this could also be a way to obtain an endogenous risk neutral measure , one of the main problems in the picture of dynamical prices considered above being that the risk neutral measure was fixed exogenously .",
    "we believe that , while accounting for these effects can make the model more appealing , the collective behavior of the model will not significantly change . indeed , the qualitative behavior discussed above is typical of a broad class of models @xcite and mainly depends on the proliferation of degeneracies in the equilibria of the model .",
    "the focus of the present paper is on theoretical concepts .",
    "their relevance for real markets requires quantitative estimates of the parameters .",
    "given the abstract nature of the model , this appears to be a non - trivial task which is an interesting avenue of future research .",
    "it has been recently suggested that market stability appears to have the properties of a public good @xcite .",
    "a public good is a good _ i ) _ whose consumption by one individual does not reduce its availability for consumption by others ( non - rivalry ) and _ ii ) _ such that no one can be effectively excluded from using the good ( non - excludability ) . at the level of the present stylized description",
    ", the expansion in the repertoire of traded assets introduces an externality which drives the market to unstable states .",
    "this suggests that systemic instability may be prevented by the introduction of a tax on derivative markets , such as that advocated long ago for foreign exchange markets by tobin @xcite , or by the introduction of `` trading permits '' , similar to those adopted to limit carbon emissions @xcite .",
    "the stabilizing effect of a tobin tax has already been shown within a model of a dynamic market which is mathematically equivalent to the one presented here @xcite .    in summary",
    ", this paper suggests that the ideal view of the markets on which financial engineering is based is not compatible with market stability . the proliferation of financial instruments makes the market look more and more similar to an ideal arbitrage - free , efficient and complete market .",
    "but this occurs at the expense of market stability .",
    "this is reminiscent of the instability discussed long ago by sir robert may @xcite which develops in ecosystems upon increasing bio - diversity . for ecologies",
    "this result is only apparently paradoxical .",
    "indeed the species which populate an ecosystem can hardly be thought of as being drawn at random , but are rather subject to natural selection .",
    "indeed , on evolutionary time scales stability can be reconciled with bio - diversity , as shown e.g. in ref .",
    "the diversity in the ecosystem of financial instruments has , by contrast , been increasing at a rate much faster than that at which selective forces likely operate .",
    "in contrast with the axiomatic equilibrium picture of apt , on which financial engineering is based , the model discussed here provides a coherent , though stylized , picture of a financial market as a system with interacting units . in this picture ,",
    "concepts such as no - arbitrage , perfect competition , market efficiency or completeness arise as emergent properties of the aggregate behavior , rather than being postulated from the outset .",
    "we believe that such an approach can potentially shed light on the causes of and conditions under which liquidity crises , arbitrages and market crashes occur .",

    "<S> we contrast arbitrage pricing theory ( apt ) , the theoretical basis for the development of financial instruments , with a dynamical picture of an interacting market , in a simple setting . </S>",
    "<S> the proliferation of financial instruments apparently provides more means for risk diversification , making the market more efficient and complete . in the simple market of interacting traders discussed here , </S>",
    "<S> the proliferation of financial instruments erodes systemic stability and it drives the market to a critical state characterized by large susceptibility , strong fluctuations and enhanced correlations among risks . </S>",
    "<S> this suggests that the hypothesis of apt may not be compatible with a stable market dynamics . </S>",
    "<S> in this perspective , market stability acquires the properties of a common good , which suggests that appropriate measures should be introduced in derivative markets , to preserve stability .    </S>",
    "<S> `` in my view , derivatives are financial weapons of mass destruction , carrying dangers that , while now latent , are potentially lethal '' . at the time of warren buffet warning @xcite markets were remarkably stable and the creativity of financial engineers was pushing the frontiers of arbitrage pricing theory to levels of unprecedented sophistication . </S>",
    "<S> it took 5 years and a threefold increase in size of credit derivative markets @xcite , for warren buffet `` time bomb '' to explode @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> paradoxically , this crisis occurred in a sector which has been absorbing human capital with strong scientific and mathematical skills , as no other industry . </S>",
    "<S> apparently , this potential was mostly used to increase the degree of sophistication of mathematical models , leaving our understanding lagging behind the increasing complexity of financial markets .    </S>",
    "<S> recent events raise many questions :    * the sub - prime mortgage market was approximately 5% of the us real estate market , and the risk was well diversified across the whole world . </S>",
    "<S> why did such a small perturbation cause so large an effect ? * why are stock prices affected by a crisis in derivative markets ? </S>",
    "<S> * why did correlations between risks grow so large during the recent crisis @xcite , with respect to their _ bona - fide _ estimates before the crisis ?    these and other questions find no answer in the theories of mathematical economics @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , real markets look quite different with respect to the picture which arbitrage pricing theory ( apt ) @xcite gives of them . </S>",
    "<S> the problem is that apt is not merely a theoretical description of a phenomenon , as other theories in natural sciences . </S>",
    "<S> it is the theory on which financial engineering is based . </S>",
    "<S> it enters into the functioning of the system it is describing , i.e. it is part of the problem itself .    </S>",
    "<S> the key function of financial markets is that of allowing inter - temporal exchanges of wealth , in a state contingent manner . </S>",
    "<S> taking this view , apt makes it possible to give a present monetary value to future risks , and hence to price complex derivative contracts . in order to do this , </S>",
    "<S> apt relies on concepts , such as perfect competition , market liquidity , no - arbitrage and market completeness , which allows one to neglect completely the feedback of trading on market s dynamics . </S>",
    "<S> these concepts are very powerful , and indeed apt has been very successful in stable market conditions . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , the proliferation of financial instruments provides even further instrument for hedging and pricing other derivatives . </S>",
    "<S> so the proliferation of financial instruments produces precisely that arbitrage - free , complete market which is hypothesized by apt .    in theory . in practice , markets are never perfectly liquid . the very fact that information can be aggregated into prices , requires that prices respond to trading ( see e.g. @xcite for evidence on fx markets or @xcite for equity markets ) . in other words , it is because markets are illiquid that they can aggregate information into prices . </S>",
    "<S> liquidity indeed is a matter of time scale and volume size @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this calls for a view of financial markets as interacting systems . </S>",
    "<S> in this view , trading strategies can affect the market in important ways . </S>",
    "<S> both theoretical models and empirical research , show that trading activity implied by derivatives affects the underlying market in non - trivial ways @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the proliferation of financial instruments ( arrow s securities ) , in a model with heterogeneous agents , was found to lead to market instability @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the aim of this paper is to contrast , within a simple framework , the picture of apt with a dynamical picture of a market as an interacting system . </S>",
    "<S> we show that while the introduction of derivatives makes the market more efficient , competition between financial institutions naturally drives the market to a critical state characterized by a sharp singularity . </S>",
    "<S> close to the singularity the market exhibits the three properties alluded to above : _ </S>",
    "<S> 1 ) _ a strong susceptibility to small perturbations and _ 2 ) _ strong fluctuations in the underlying stock market . furthermore _ </S>",
    "<S> 3 ) _ while correlations across different derivatives is largely negligible in normal times , correlations in the derivative market are strongly enhanced in stress times , when the market is close to the critical state . in brief </S>",
    "<S> , this suggests that the hypothesis of apt may not be compatible with the requirement of a stable market .    </S>",
    "<S> capturing the increasing complexity of financial markets in a simple mathematical framework is a daunting task . </S>",
    "<S> we draw inspiration from the physics of disordered systems , in physics , such as inhomogeneous alloys which are seen as systems with random interactions . </S>",
    "<S> likewise , we characterize the typical properties of an ensemble of markets with derivatives being drawn from a given distribution . our model is admittedly stylized and misses several important features , such as the risks associated with increased market exposure in stress conditions or the increase in demand of financial instruments in order to replicate other financial instruments . </S>",
    "<S> however , it provides a coherent picture of collective market phenomena .    </S>",
    "<S> but it is precisely because these models are simple that one is able to point out why theoretical concepts such as efficient or complete markets and competitive equilibria have non - trivial implications . </S>",
    "<S> the reason being that these conditions hold only in special points of the phase diagram where singularity occurs ( phase transitions ) . </S>",
    "<S> it is precisely when markets approach these ideal conditions that instabilities and strong fluctuations appear @xcite . loosely speaking , </S>",
    "<S> this arises from the fact that the market equilibrium becomes degenerate along some directions in the phase space . in a complete , arbitrage - free market </S>",
    "<S> , the introduction of a derivative contract creates a symmetry , as it introduces perfectly equivalent ways of realizing the same payoffs . </S>",
    "<S> fluctuations along the direction of phase space identified by symmetries can grow unbounded . </S>",
    "<S> loosely speaking , the financial industry is a factory of symmetries , which is why the proliferation of financial instruments can cause strong fluctuations and instabilities . in this respect , the study of competitive equilibria alone can be misleading . </S>",
    "<S> what is mostly important is their stability with respect to adaptive behavior of agents and the dynamical fluctuations they support and generate .    </S>",
    "<S> the rest of the paper is organized as follows : the next section recalls the basics of apt in a simple case , setting the stage for the following sections . </S>",
    "<S> then we introduce the model and discuss its behavior . </S>",
    "<S> we illustrate the generic behavior of the model in a simple case where the relevant parameters are the number of different derivatives and the risk premium . in this </S>",
    "<S> setting we first examine the properties of competitive equilibria and then discuss the fluctuations induced within a simple adaptive process , by which banks learn to converge to these equilibria . </S>",
    "<S> then we illustrate a more general model with a distribution of risk premia . </S>",
    "<S> this confirms the general conclusion that , as markets expand in complexity , they approach a phase transition point , as discussed above .    </S>",
    "<S> the final section concludes with some perspectives and suggests some measures to prevent market instability . </S>"
