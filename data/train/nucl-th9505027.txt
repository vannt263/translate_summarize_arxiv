    "in the interesting and expanding field of heavy ion physics several models for the treatment of the reaction dynamics have been developed . especially microscopic transport models which take nuclear mean",
    "field effects and two particle collisions into account have been very successful in explaining various kind of experimental data .",
    "these models are extentions of the basic intra nuclear model ( inc ) @xcite in which two nucleon collisions are taken into account , but the nuclear mean field is not treated self consistently .",
    "two major microscopic approaches are used : transport models of the boltzmann - uehling - uhlenbeck type ( buu or vuu ) for the nuclear phase - space distribution function , solving either a non relativistic transport equation ( non relativistic buu ) @xcite or a relativistic transport equation ( rbuu ) @xcite and the quantum molecular dynamics ( qmd ) @xcite or its relativistic version ( rqmd ) @xcite , in which the nuclear phase - space distribution function is modeled by the sum of single - nucleon gaussian wave packets , whose peak positions are propagated in time according to the many - body newton equation , taking into account the self consistent mean field as the sum of all two - body potentials .    in this paper",
    "we will discuss especially the antisymmetrized molecular dynamics ( amd ) @xcite which is an extension of the qmd and is similar to the fermionic molecular dynamics ( fmd ) proposed by feldmeier @xcite . in the amd",
    "the nuclear wave function is assumed to be a slater determinant of single - nucleon gaussian wave packets .",
    "other than in the fmd the gaussian width parameter is time independent and , in addition to the pure mean field dynamics which is treated in the fmd , the two nucleon collision process has been incorporated in the amd @xcite .",
    "the amd has proved to be very successful in describing heavy ion collisions at medium energies ( @xmath7200 mev / nucleon ) @xcite . because the amd describes the total system with a slater determinant of nucleon wave packets it has quantum mechanical character , which has been demonstrated in the ability of treating shell effects in the dynamical formation of fragments .",
    "furthermore it has been shown that ground state wave functions of colliding nuclei given by the amd are realistic and reproduce many spectroscopic data very well @xcite .",
    "since the amd is successful for energies below 200 mev / nucleon we want to apply it also at higher energies besides the question of lorentz invariance , which we will also comment on in this paper , the opening of inelastic channels , i.e.  the excitation of delta degrees of freedom , in the elementary nucleon - nucleon collision process is the most important effect for @xmath8 mev .",
    "therefore the first part of this paper is concerned with the question how to incorporate these inelastic channels into the amd framework .    before applying the extended amd to heavy ion reactions we want to get a good understanding of the basic dynamics in our model .",
    "we choose to investigate ( p , p@xmath1 ) reactions at delta resonance energies .",
    "this is in the spirit of thr research done by engel et al .",
    "@xcite who studied the pion - nucleus reaction to get a better understanding of the pion and delta dynamics in the buu model .",
    "another reason to apply the extended amd to ( p , p@xmath1 ) reactions is that we found in a previous paper @xcite that the amd can reproduce data for ( p , p@xmath1 ) reactions for energies up to 200 mev very well , so we want to see if this is also true for higher energies .",
    "it is to be noted that the ( p , p@xmath1 ) reactions have been a major field of interest @xcite , since other than in the ( p , n ) reaction the delta peak is not shifted .",
    "therefore we will investigate the delta potential dependence and the reaction dynamics in detail .",
    "finally to get a better understanding of the rather elaborated amd calculation for the ( p , p@xmath1 ) reaction and the experimental data we compare to a one - step monte carlo ( osmc ) simulation for this process .",
    "thereby we can study the influence and importance of mean field effects , multi - step processes , and lorentz invariant kinematics .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows : in sec .",
    "[ amd ] we explain the amd framework , discussing the introduction of delta degrees of freedom in the mean field and in the collision part ; i.e.  the delta potential and @xmath9 cross sections are introduced . in this section",
    "we also discuss the first calculations of delta separation energies of delta nuclei in the amd . in sec .",
    "[ monte ] we give a description of the osmc which we use for comparison with the amd calculations . as an important basis for the studies presented in this paper",
    ", we study the question of lorentz invariance for the ( p , p@xmath1 ) reaction within the osmc .",
    "we find and show the interesting result , that a combination of lorentz transformation from the laboratory frame into the total equal - velocity frame , gallilei invariant treatment in the equal - velocity frame , and following lorentz back transformation into the laboratory frame ensures approximate lorentz invariant results for energies around @xmath10 mev . in sec .",
    "[ exper ] we discuss the results of amd and osmc in several steps and compare them with one another and with experimental data .",
    "first we present the results of the osmc calculations and compare them with experimental data .",
    "before we discuss the improvements which are achieved by the full amd calculation , we explain how to fix all the parameters , especially the width parameter @xmath6 in the single particle momentum distribution of the outgoing nucleons , in the amd cross section calculation independent of the experiment .",
    "this is an important point of the calculation and should be understood well .",
    "after a detailed discussion of the multi - step contributions to the cross section in the amd calculation we proceed to discuss multi - step and potential effects by comparing osmc and amd calculation with one another . in a final step",
    "we discuss dependence on delta potential , on elastic nucleon - nucleon cross section and on target momentum distribution of the calculations , and possible improvements of the amd calculations . in sec .",
    "[ summ ] we give the summary and an outlook on what should or what could be done in future .",
    "for intermediate energy collisions e@xmath11/a @xmath12 600 mev inelastic channels open in the elementary nucleon - nucleon process .",
    "the first channel to open is the pion production .",
    "as it is kown from one - boson exchange model calculations for the elementary process @xmath13 @xcite the pion production proceeds mainly through excitations of delta states as it is depicted in the feynman diagram in fig .  [ fnnnnpi ] .",
    "diagrams with an excitation of an off - shell nucleon are only important for energies near the pion production threshold .    to include additional processes in the collision part of microscopic models the cross sections for this processes are needed . in the pion production case",
    "these cross sections are well known from experiment , but still there are in principle two ways to include pion production into microscopic models .",
    "one way is to treat the @xmath13 reaction directly , but this approach has several deficiencies .",
    "first of all the pions in heavy ion collisions are produced in the nuclear medium and therefore can be reabsorbed during the collision . since the pion absorption process in the nucleus is not well understood , it is not clear how to treat it after a pion productuion in the nuclear medium .",
    "salcedo et al .",
    "@xcite calculated density - dependent pion absorption probabilities in the nucleus , but these calculations are based on local thomas fermi approximation and therefore are only valid for ground state nuclei and can not be used in heavy ion collisions .",
    "another drawback of the pure pion and nucleon cascade approach is that it is well known from experiment that also delta degrees of freedom survive in the nuclear medium .    due to this drawbacks we choose another way which is also adopted in other microscopic models ( see for example refs.@xcite ) .",
    "we cut the @xmath13 reaction into two steps : 1 ) @xmath14 and 2 ) @xmath15 reaction .",
    "this is possible since the decay of deltas into pions occupies nearly 100% of the delta width .    to simulate the produced pion and nucleon momentum spectra correctly we have to take a mass distribution of the intermediate excited delta resonance into account .",
    "the origin of this mass distribution is easily understood by calculating the contribution of the feynman diagram in fig .",
    "[ fnnnnpi ] to the pion production cross section . in the production cross section a term proportional to the square of the delta propagator",
    "@xmath16 will appear , where @xmath17 is the square of the four momentum of the delta , @xmath18 the delta rest mass and @xmath19 the width of the delta ( see eq .",
    "( [ gamma ] ) ) .",
    "therefore off - shell states will contribute to the cross section with the weight of a @xmath17-dependent factor proportinal to @xmath20 . to simulate the off - shell character of the delta in microscopic models we populate delta states with a mass distribution proportional to @xmath20 , interpreting @xmath17 as mass of the delta , but propagating the delta states as on - shell particles ( see sec .",
    "[ amdcoll ] ) .",
    "now by including also the reverse processes @xmath21 and @xmath22 we get a consistent picture of the delta and pion dynamics in heavy ion collisions .",
    "unklike in the pure pion case discussed above , the pion absorption process is fixed in this approach , namely , 1 ) @xmath22 and 2 ) @xmath21 lead to a pion absorption .",
    "it has been shown that this treatment of the collision term can reproduce many experimental data for the pion - nucleus reactions quite well @xcite .",
    "also unlike in the pure pion case the delta is included explicitly as degree of freedom .    as a first step of extending the amd we discuss in this paper only the extension to include delta degrees of freedom .",
    "we find that for calculations of ( p , p@xmath1 ) reactions for light targets the treatment of only delta degrees of freedom is sufficient .",
    "the decay of the deltas is calculated in the final time step of the calculation , when the deltas have escaped the the nuclear medium .",
    "later we plan to include also pion degrees of freedom in the nuclear medium and the full pion dynamics as explained above .    besides the inclusion of the delta in the collision part it also has to be included into the mean field part of the theory .",
    "normally this is done by treating the delta as heavy nucleon and propagating it in the same mean field as the one for nucleons .",
    "more refined calculations have been done which use different mean potentials for deltas and nucleons @xcite .",
    "we adopted also a delta potential which is different from the nucleon potential .",
    "we will proceed in the following sec .",

    "unlike in the osmc results discussed in this paper the smooth dependence on the outgoing proton momenta for larger angles can be better described in their pwia calculation .",
    "this is because they use an unrealistic high pion production cross section .",
    "therefore they need no multi - step contributions to get the smooth behaviour of the cross section for large angles as we find in the amd calculations .",
    "if one would add the multi - step contributions to their pwia calculation this would lead to a large overestimation of the experimental data .",
    "another defect of the pwia calculations of y.  alexander et al .",
    "is that they fit the heights of the qep in the double differential cross section with an angle dependent scale factor which hides the strong dependence on the angular distribution of the elementary nucleon - nucleon cross section .    in the region of phase space where multi - step contributions determine the cross section y.  alexander et al .",
    "underestimate the inelastic scattering cross section .",
    "this is in good agreement with the findings presented in this paper using the osmc model .",
    "in this paper we discussed how to incorporate delta degrees of freedom into the amd .",
    "especially we discussed the inclusion of inelastic channels in the collision term and the form of the delta - nucleon potential .",
    "for the delta - nucleon potential we used a skyrme type potential which gives @xmath197mev for infinite nuclear matter calculation , thereby reproducing the experimental data found in pion - nucleus scattering .    with the help of the frictional cooling method we calculated delta separation energies for delta nuclei. there we found that the minimum energy of the delta - nucleus system in the present calculation is achieved when the delta and nucleus wave functions are in the state of maximum overlap .",
    "therefore we found that the clustering of amd wave function is reflected in the delta separation energy .    for a detailed discussion of the ( p , p@xmath1 ) reaction we developed a one - step monte carlo ( osmc ) model for this reaction .",
    "as required by the energy region considered in this paper ( @xmath5 mev ) we incorporated both nucleon and delta degrees of freedom using the same cross section as done in the amd .",
    "as first application of the osmc we investigated the question of lorentz invariance for nucleon - nucleus scattering for energies @xmath198 mev .",
    "we found the interesting result that , applying a combination of lorentz transformations , also a gallilei invariant theory can be used to treat nucleon - nucleus scattering in this energy region .",
    "also the calculation of @xmath138 in a gallilei invariant theory can be performed in an approximate lorentz invariant way .    before applying the amd calculation to the ( p , p@xmath1 ) reaction",
    ", we discussed how to determine the width parmeter @xmath6 of the single particle wave function for outgoing nucleons .",
    "the determination was made by comparing one - step amd and osmc calculations .",
    "this is a unique way to get parameter independent results in the amd .    both , with extended amd and osmc , we preformed calculations of double differential cross sections @xmath199 for the @xmath3c(p , p@xmath1 ) reaction for angle and momentum - dependent cross sections .",
    "we found a quantitative difference between amd and osmc calculations which is mainly due to multi - step contributions to the cross section , which are absent in one - step calculations .",
    "generally we find that osmc and amd can reproduce the qualitative behaviour of the experimental data .",
    "both the delta peak and the qep can be seen in the calculation and the angle dependence of the cross section is reproduced rather well . in case of the amd we find a quantitative good description of the experimental data expect for the overestimation of the qep in forward direction .",
    "therefore the agreement with the experimental data improves if we perform calculations with a reduced elastic cross section .",
    "one reason for the reduced elastic cross section could be that the correct treatment of the momentum dependence of the nucleon mean field at this energy region leads to a repulsive potential and , because of this , to more diffraction of the incoming protons to larger angles .",
    "this then leads to less elastic scattering probability .",
    "this effect would be most serious for big impact parameters .    for a better understanding of the reaction process we preformed a multi - step decomposition of the cross section .",
    "to get the smooth momentum dependence seen in the experimental data for @xmath174 and @xmath200 , a complicated interplay of elastic and inelastic channels is important which is approximately reproduced by the amd calculation .",
    "one interesting result of the multi - step decomposition of the cross section is that two and higher step contributions govern the high momentum tail of cross sections for larger angles .",
    "the unsatisfying point is that an overall reduction of the elastic scattering cross section , which seems to be needed to reproduce the experimental data better , leads to an underestimation of multi - step processes and therefore to an underestimation of the cross section in the region of phace space where these processes determine the cross section , such as the region of the high momentum tail at larger angles . again",
    "the above offered cure to the overestimation of the elastic scattering , a correct treatment of the momentum dependence of the mean field , would mainly reduce the one - step contributions and not the multi - step contributions .",
    "as one important physical property , which is often discussed but not well understood , we discussed the influence of the delta potential on the ( p , p@xmath1 ) reaction .",
    "we found that the results for the ( p , p@xmath1 ) are not very sensitive to the choice of the delta potential .",
    "the reason for this is that the contributions to the cross section which change due to different delta potentials are small and are hidden below multi - step and elastic step contributions to the cross section .",
    "we pointed out that the dependence on the delta potential will be more apparent in calculations for experimental data , where the excitation of the delta dominates the reaction , i.e.  delta mass distribution from @xmath192 + nucleon invariant mass spectra ( see for example ref .",
    "@xcite ) .    commenting on prevoius calculations we found that the amd model gives a much more realistic picture of the @xmath3c(p , p@xmath1 ) reaction at @xmath152 mev than the pwia calculations of y.  alexander et al .   in ref .",
    "@xcite for the same process .",
    "finally we conclude with an outlook : this paper leaves many open questions and ways to extend the field of study .",
    "first of all a nucleon - nucleon potential should be adopted which gives the correct momentum dependence of the nucleon mean field and then the statements made about the change of the heights of the qep should be tested .",
    "also the full pion dynamics should be incorporated in the amd , which is expected to have a minor effect on the calculations presented in this paper where we treat a light target @xmath3c , since we find that the @xmath99 process is negligble .",
    "but for the study of the ( p , p@xmath1 ) reaction for heavier targets the correct treatment of pion absorption ( @xmath201 reaction ) and pion reabsorption ( @xmath202 ) will be much more important .",
    "another way to follow is to perform a more detailed study of dependence on delta and nucleon potential .",
    "especially a momentum - dependent delta potential could be introduced and the difference between momentun - dependent and momentum - independent potentials could be discussed . for this investigation",
    "we have to compare to experimental data which are more sensitive to the adopted potentials .",
    "also we have to introduce a self consistent treatment of the delta mass in the amd for the the @xmath14 process as discussed in sec .  [ experpara ] .",
    "further , ( p , n ) reactions should be investigated in detail . for this study",
    "the the difference of transverse and longitudonal delta excition should and can be taken into account in the cross section .",
    "this will give a nice tool to study the shift of the delta peak in the ( p , n ) reaction .",
    "one of us ( a. e ) wants to thank the japan society for promotion of science for financial support for this project .",
    "most of the calculations for this research project were performed with the fujitsu vpp500 of riken , japan .",
