    "figure 1 shows the temperature dependence of the in - plane resistivity , magnetization , and specific heat data .",
    "the resistivity shows a weak metallic temperature dependence .",
    "two step transitions were seen in resistivity curve .",
    "a sharp drop at 42 k was observed followed by a major transition near 30 k. the transition at 42 k could be weakly seen in a highly enlarged scale in the magnetization curve with h@xmath10c , similar to the report in ref .",
    "@xcite , but is not visible in the specific heat measurement , suggesting an extremely small fraction or interface superconductivity at this transition temperature in the sample .",
    "clear diamagnetization in susceptibility and jump in specific heat were seen at lower temperature , @xmath1128 k , where the sample already reaches zero resistivity .",
    "high temperature magnetization measurement revealed the presence of an afm phase transition near 520 k for this sample .",
    "figure 2 shows the r(@xmath12 ) and @xmath13 spectra for the k@xmath0fe@xmath1se@xmath2 sample .",
    "the left panels show the r(@xmath12 ) and @xmath13 spectra up to 8000 @xmath14 , the right panels show the spectra in the expanded low frequency region within 250 @xmath14 .",
    "similar to the insulating compound with lower fe content @xcite , the reflectance over broad frequencies is rather low , roughly below the value of 0.4 . in the earlier study on the insulating compounds , two characteristic spectral features specific to the k@xmath4fe@xmath5se@xmath2 system",
    "were identified : a double peak absorption structure between 4000 - 6000 @xmath14 and abundant phonon peaks ( much more than those expected for a standard 122 structure ) .",
    "both features were interpreted to be highly related to the blocked checkerboard afm order associated with the presence of fe vacancies and their orderings @xcite .",
    "those features are also seen in the present compound , suggesting the presence of fe vacancies and their orderings in the superconducting samples .",
    "the presence of @xmath8 superstructure modulation was confirmed by the tem measurement as we shall present below .",
    "it is also consistent with the high temperature magnetization measurement showing the presence of afm transition near 520 k ( fig . 1 ( d ) ) .",
    "the major spectral change relative to the insulating compound appears at low frequencies .",
    "the reflectance r(@xmath12 ) values at low frequencies are obviously higher than that of insulating samples @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the low-@xmath12 r(@xmath12 ) shows a metallic temperature dependence : the r(@xmath12 ) values increases with decreasing temperature .",
    "however , this kind of metallic response is rather weak . in the optical conductivity spectra , the low - frequency region",
    "is still dominated by phonon modes .",
    "the electronic background has a rather low spectral weight without showing a clear drude - like component .",
    "unexpectedly , a relatively sharp reflectance edge develops below 30 @xmath14 in the superconducting state .",
    "this surprising sharp feature was repeatedly observed in different superconducting samples .",
    "the observation of a sharp reflectance edge below t@xmath3 is the most intriguing experimental result in the infrared spectroscopy measurement .",
    "it is important to understand its physical origin . naturally , one has to examine whether or not the spectral feature is caused by the formation of a superconducting energy gap ? as indicated below , this possibility is highly unlikely for several reasons . first and the most importantly , the superconducting energy gap ( 2@xmath15 ) amplitudes determined directly by the arpes experiments on the electronic pockets , which are the only dispersive bands crossing the fermi level , are close to 18 - 20 mev @xcite .",
    "those values are much larger than the energy scale seen for the edge .",
    "second , although the sample is superconducting , the reflectance values at the lowest measurement frequency limit in the normal state are still far below the unit , leading to a non - drude - like response in @xmath16(@xmath12 ) .",
    "as we shall also explain below that the sample likely contains some insulating phase , it is hard to imagine that a full gap feature could be realized in the relatively nonhomogeneous sample . furthermore , the reflectance spectral at 8 k shows a strong dip feature near 44 @xmath14 . at this frequency , its r(@xmath12 )",
    "value is much lower than that in the normal state ( r(8 k)/r(35 k)@xmath170.9 ) .",
    "the dip is so pronounced that the feature is unlikely to be related to a superconducting gap .    on the other hand ,",
    "the relatively sharp feature is more likely to be caused by the josephson - coupling plasma edge . as seen from fig .",
    "3 , the real part of the dielectric function @xmath18(@xmath12 ) in the normal state ( e.g. at 35 k ) is positive and further increases in the lowest - frequency region , similar to the case of insulating dielectrics .",
    "however , in the superconducting state , the low-@xmath12 @xmath18(@xmath12 ) becomes a rapidly decreasing function of @xmath12 toward @xmath12=0 .",
    "the reflectance edge corresponds to the zero - crossing of the real part of the dielectric function @xmath18(@xmath12 ) , indicating that this edge is resulted from collective plasma oscillation .",
    "the josephson plasmon has been widely observed in the high - t@xmath3 cuprates with the electric field polarized along the c - axis @xcite . since the cuprate superconductor could be viewed as an alternating stack of superconducting cuo@xmath2 planes and insulating building blocks , the optical response is still insulator - like in the normal state .",
    "however , once entering into the superconducting state , those cuo@xmath2 layers are coupled through the josephson tunneling effect .",
    "then , a plasma edge corresponding to the superconducting condensate emerges with its location mainly determined by the critical current density in the stacking direction . because of the periodic spacing of the cuo@xmath2 layers in the crystal structure , the josephson plasma edge is very sharp .",
    "we suggest that similar situation occurs for k@xmath0fe@xmath1se@xmath2 compound here . if the sample has a nanoscale phase separation between the superconducting and insulating phases , for example , a stripe - type phase separation as outlined schematically in the inset of fig .",
    "3 , this type of josephson coupling plasmon would be well expected .    to verify the above proposal , we performed tem investigations by using the superstructure reflection spots for dark - field imaging on the superconducting crystals .",
    "figures 4 ( a ) shows an electron diffraction pattern taken along the [ 001 ] zone axis direction , in which the superstructure spots with both ( 1/5 , 3/5 , 0 ) and ( 1/2 , 1/2 , 0 ) wave vectors can be clearly seen .",
    "figure 4 ( b ) displays the dark - field tem images by using one of the superstructure spot as indicated in fig .",
    "the well ordered regions with fine striped or speckled contrasts can be commonly observed .",
    "the length of a stripe could be in the range from several to several tens or even over 100 nanometers , while it width is usually less than 10 nanometers .",
    "this kind of complex contrast in fig .",
    "4 ( b ) can be explained directly as the coexistence of fe - vacancy ordered bright areas and fe deficiency - free ( or fe - disordered ) areas .",
    "taking into account of the remarkable superconductivity in present sample , we can conclude that the fe deficiency - free / fe - disordered areas are mainly governed by the superconducting phase .",
    "the dark - field tem image technique provides direct and strong support for the presence of nanoscaled stripe or speckled phase separation . because the phase separation could not be uniform everywhere in the sample ,",
    "the josephson coupling strength would exhibit local variations .",
    "it implies that the josephson plasma frequencies would show a distribution around a center frequency . as a result",
    ", the josephson plasma edge could not be as sharp as that observed in the c - axis optical response in the cuprates .",
    "naturally , the insulating phase could be assigned to the afm ordered phase with a @xmath8 superstructure modulation , while the superconducting phase originates from the k - deficient k@xmath0fe@xmath2se@xmath2 composition .",
    "because of the k - vacancy ordering , it results in a @xmath19 superlattice .",
    "this phase is indeed heavily electron - doped , and thus has a big electron fs , which has been detected by the arpes experiment @xcite . from earlier optical measurement on the insulating sample ,",
    "a small indirect gap @xmath1130 mev was identified @xcite . because the barrier is rather low ,",
    "the two superconducting stripes separated by the afm ordered insulating region could be coupled through the josephson tunnelling effect in the superconducting state .    to further substantiate the picture",
    ", we tried to reproduce the shape of the josephson plasma edge with a simple model as suggested by van der marel and tsvetkov @xcite that has taken account of the distribution of the josephson plasma frequencies around a center frequency .",
    "the expression for dielectric function has the form of @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the normalized distribution function of the screened josephson plasma frequencies , which we assume to have a form of gaussian distribution function , @xmath21 = @xmath22 . in the above equation",
    ", @xmath23 is the central frequency of the screened josephson plasma frequency , @xmath24 the normal fluid component , @xmath25 the high frequency dielectric constant , and @xmath26 the variance of the distribution function .",
    "figure 5 ( a ) shows the shape of the josephson plasma edge as a function of the variance of the distribution function in the normalized gaussian distribution function of the screened plasma frequencies .",
    "the change of the normalized gaussian distribution of the screened plasma frequencies with the parameter @xmath26 is plotted in fig . 5 ( b ) . here",
    "the parameters were chosen as @xmath23=40 @xmath14 , @xmath24=5 s / cm , @xmath25=15 .",
    "the variance of the distribution function is chosen as @xmath26=1 , 5 , 10 , 15 .",
    "clearly , the josephson plasma edge becomes less sharp when the josephson plasma frequencies have broader distributions .",
    "qualitatively , it explains the observation fairly well .",
    "since the josephson coupling plasmon is a phenomenon related to the tunnelling of the condensed superconducting carriers , it should be easily influenced by the external magnetic field .",
    "we therefore explored the effect of the magnetic field on the josephson coupling plasmon edge .",
    "figure 6 shows a far - infrared reflectance measurements under zero field and h=8 t for a different sample grown in the same condition .",
    "the field is applied along the c - axis which is perpendicular to the electric field of the infrared radiation .",
    "relative to the curve at 35 k , the r(@xmath12 ) at 5 k shows a clear edge - like shape with a dip appearing near 50 @xmath14 . applying magnetic field to the sample , the edge - like feature weakens and shifts towards lower frequencies . from fig .",
    "6 ( a ) , it is easy to find that r(@xmath12 ) under the field of 8 t at t=5 k follows the normal - state r(@xmath12 ) measured at 35 k down to much lower frequencies .",
    "figure 6 ( b ) is a plot of the ratio of the zero - field reflectance at 35 k to the reflectance curves at 5 k under different fields .",
    "then we find a peak in the ratio curve , which shifts to lower frequency side by over 13 @xmath14by a magnetic field of 8 t. meanwhile , the intensity of the peak drops .",
    "the rather significant change of the plasma edge structure by such a moderate field also favors a josephson coupling plasmon scenario rather than a superconducting energy gap , since the upper critical field is known to be extremely high in this compound @xcite .",
    "our experimental investigation revealed novel josephson coupling phenomenon in the new a@xmath4fe@xmath5se@xmath2 superconducting single crystals , which was not seen in other fe - based superconductors .",
    "in fact , except for the polarized infrared measurement of * * e**@xmath10c - axis on cuprates below t@xmath3 , we were not aware of observation of josephson plasmons in any other superconducting compounds .",
    "our experimental results yield compelling evidence for the presence of nanoscale phase separation between superconducting and afm ordered insulating phases .",
    "the rather incoherent low - frequency optical conductivity is naturally due to the presence of sizeable fraction of insulating phase which largely blocks the conducting paths .",
    "the presence of the sizeable fraction of insulating phase could also account for the presence of double interband transition peaks between 4000 and 6000 @xmath14and abundant phonon peaks observed in all measured superconducting samples , which were interpreted as being associated with the blocked antiferromagnetism due to the presence of fe vacancy ordering @xcite .",
    "based on the nanoscale phase separation picture , one can also explain those seemingly controversial experimental data probed from different techniques .",
    "currently , the strongest experimental support for a microscopic coexistence of antiferromagnetic order and superconductivity comes from the neutron diffraction @xcite and two - magnon raman - scattering @xcite measurements .",
    "the intensity of the magnetic bragg peaks in neutron diffraction shows a sharp downturn ( approximately 5@xmath27 ) as the temperature is lowered below t@xmath3 .",
    "the intensity of the two - magnon peak in raman scattering also undergoes a 5@xmath27 sudden reduction on entering the superconducting phase .",
    "if the phase separation occured at a macroscopic region , this drop is really hard to understand .",
    "however , the phase separation revealed in this study comes out at a nanoscale level .",
    "there exist a huge amount of the phase boundaries .",
    "below t@xmath3 , the superconducting proximity effect near the phase boundaries would effectively reduce the afm ordered region .",
    "then , the reduction of several percent magnetic response would not be unexpected .",
    "the single crystals used in the present study were grown from a self - melting method with nominal concentration of k : fe : se=0.8:2.1:2 in a procedure similar to the description in reference @xcite .",
    "the actual composition , determined by the average value of the energy dispersive x - ray ( edx ) spectroscopy analysis , was found very close to 0.75:1.75:2 .",
    "the temperature dependence of the in - plane resistivity , magnetization , and specific heat were measured by ppms and squid from quantum design .",
