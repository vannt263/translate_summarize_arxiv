    "the study of higher - dimensional gravity attracted considerable attentions in the recent years .",
    "the reason is two folded : one reason lies in that string theory requires higher spacetime dimensions , the other reason is that studies of gravity in higher dimensions might reveal deeper structures of general relativity , such as stability issues and classification of singularities of spacetime in various dimensions . for recent reviews in the subject ,",
    "see @xcite and @xcite .    in @xcite , two of the present authors obtained and analyzed in detail an exact 5-dimensional ( 5d ) c - metric like vacuum solution of the einstein equation with non - negative cosmological constant .",
    "the c - metric in 4d has been known for a long time @xcite .",
    "the original c - metric and subsequent generalizations were shown to admit very interesting physical features @xcite . despite the intensive studies on higher dimensional gravities , it is a bit strange that no higher dimensional analogue of c - metric has been found so far .",
    "it was concluded very recently @xcite@xcite that there are no generalizations of the c - metric in the robinson - trautman family with black hole horizons in higher dimensions .",
    "the spacetime we obtained in @xcite does not contain any black hole horizons , but it does have two acceleration horizons and interestingly nontrivial global structure .",
    "we also interpreted the special case of @xmath0 using exterior geometric technique following @xcite .    in the discussion section of @xcite ,",
    "another c - metric like vacuum solution was presented but not analyzed in detail . in this paper",
    ", we shall be dealing with this novel metric with arbitrary value of @xmath1 .",
    "the plan of this paper is as follows . in section 2",
    "we give the metric and its coordinate ranges . in section 3 we study the causal structures of the metric in various cases . in section 4",
    "we analyze the accelerating nature of the horizons .",
    "section 5 is devoted to the connection to the standard ds , ads and minkowski spacetimes using exterior geometric techniques .",
    "then , in section 6 , we give a 4d interpretation of the metric via kaluza - klein reduction , which leads to an exact solution for einstein - maxwell - liouville theory just as the metric analyzed in @xcite .",
    "finally , in section 7 , some concluding remarks are presented .",
    "the metric to be studied is @xmath2 ,   \\label{metric1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath3 by straightforward calculations it can be seen that this metric is an exact solution of the 5d vacuum einstein equation @xmath4 . so the corresponding spacetime is a 5d vacuum einstein spacetime for every constant value of the cosmological constant @xmath1 .",
    "obviously , the function @xmath5 and @xmath6 both have two zeros @xmath7 which constrain the range of values for the coordinates @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "the zeros for @xmath10 depends on the value of the cosmological constant @xmath1 , which can be divided into the following cases :    1 .   for @xmath11 ( ds case )",
    ", @xmath10 has two zeros @xmath12 2 .   for @xmath13 ( minkowski case ) , @xmath10 has two zeros @xmath14 ; 3 .   for @xmath15 ( ads case ) ,",
    "the situation is a little more complicated : * if @xmath16 , @xmath10 has two zeros @xmath17 * if @xmath18 , @xmath10 has a double zero @xmath19 ; * if @xmath20 , @xmath10 has no zeros .    since @xmath21 plays the role of radial coordinate , its range is not restricted by the zeros of @xmath22 .",
    "however , the overall conformal factor in the metric implies that @xmath23 is the conformal infinity , and in general it suffices to consider the spacetime located on a single side of the conformal infinity . without loss of generality",
    ", we make the choice @xmath24 .",
    "thus we get a variable range of @xmath21 depending on the value of @xmath8 , @xmath25 putting together , the coordinate ranges of the metric ( [ metric1 ] ) are given as follows , @xmath26,\\\\    & z&\\in[-1 , 1],\\qquad    \\phi\\in[0 , 2\\pi).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    what is the role of zeros of the function @xmath22 listed above ?",
    "it will be shown later that many but not all of these zeros correspond to acceleration horizons .",
    "a given zero @xmath27 ( which can take either one of the values @xmath28 ) of @xmath22 corresponds to a horizon if and only if it is located inside the physical range @xmath29 of @xmath21 , i.e. it satisfies the inequality @xmath30 . all",
    "@xmath27s whose values violate the above inequality are not horizons .",
    "the procedure to draw the carter - penrose diagram is as follows .",
    "first , for convenience , we change the coordinates @xmath8 and @xmath9 into @xmath31 and @xmath32 via @xmath33 so that the angular part of the metric looks like that of a 3-sphere , @xmath34 then we introduce the eddington - finkelstein coordinates , @xmath35 where the tortoise coordinate @xmath36 is defined as @xmath37 and both @xmath38 and @xmath39 belong to the range @xmath40 . in this",

    "it is easy to see that if the limit of @xmath53 is 0 or @xmath58 , the corresponding line is mapped into a null line ; if the limit of @xmath53 is @xmath59 , the corresponding line is mapped into a spacelike line ; if the limit is 1 , the corresponding line is mapped into a timelike line . since for @xmath11",
    "we have @xmath60 , @xmath61 has a finite positive value varying with @xmath8 .",
    "therefore , the carter - penrose diagram in this case consists of the coordinate poles represented by the lines @xmath55 , the horizon at @xmath62 and the ( curved ) past and future conformal infinities at @xmath56 .",
    "the corresponding diagram is depicted as in fig.[fig1 ] ( a ) . in this and",
    "all subsequent figures , lines labeled with @xmath54 or @xmath63 represent acceleration horizons , @xmath64 and @xmath65 are respectively past and future infinities ( @xmath66 or @xmath67 ) , and @xmath55 or @xmath68 correspond to @xmath69 , the spacelike infinities .",

    "the procedure for drawing carter - penrose diagrams for the case @xmath13 is very similar to the case @xmath11 , the only difference lies in that we need to set @xmath71 to the specific value 1 , and under this value of @xmath71 the analysis of @xmath61 is a little bit more complicated :    * @xmath72 : @xmath73 can be reached and is a horizon .",

    "the same diagrams have appeared and were combined into the global visualization in @xcite which correspond to the massless uncharged c - metric without cosmological constant in 4d .      for @xmath15",
    "we have to analyze separately three subcases @xmath16 , @xmath18 and @xmath20 .",
    "since the lower bound for the coordinate @xmath21 depends on @xmath8 , the carter - penrose diagrams will also change according to the value of @xmath8 .",
    "this case corresponds to @xmath80 and the procedure to get the final conformal diagrams is basically the same as before . in the final step for analysing @xmath61",

    "actually , inserting @xmath91 into the first equality of ( [ tortoise ] ) naturally gives the correct @xmath93 for the present case , @xmath94 so , introducing the sequence of coordinate changes @xmath95 the metric can be rewritten as @xmath96    we need to subdivide the values of @xmath8 into 3 regions :    * @xmath97 : no horizons exist and the carter - penrose diagram is depicted as in fig.[fig3 ] ( a ) ; * @xmath70 : @xmath90 overlaps with the conformal infinities and hence no horizons exist and the carter - penrose diagram is depicted as in fig.[fig3 ] ( b ) .",

    "let us remark that for each of the carter - penrose diagrams corresponding to @xmath15 listed above , one can find a 4d counter part for it in @xcite respectively . combining with the results obtained in previous subsections ,",
    "we conclude that the carter - penrose diagrams for our metric with any value of @xmath1 are all analogous to the corresponding diagrams for the 4d massless unclarged c - metrics .",
    "the only difference is that the geometry of each point in the diagrams are different ( with one extra angular dimension in our case ) .",
    "however , the same shapes of the carter - penrose diagrams imply that our metric ( [ metric1 ] ) is the 5d generalization of the massless uncharged 4d c - metrics .",
    "in this section we shall show that every horizon appeared in section [ sec3 ] is an acceleration horizon .",
    "this is achieved by use of some properly chosen coordinate transformations . in this process",
    ", the meaning of the parameter @xmath105 will also gets clear : it is just the magnitude of the acceleration of the origin of the coordinate systems which we are going to choose .",
    "let us first perform the following coordinate transformation @xcite @xmath106 with @xmath107 doing so the metric ( [ metric1 ] ) becomes @xmath108 ,   \\label{metricone }   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath109    now consider the timelike observer at fixed spacial position @xmath110 in the spacetime described by the worldline @xmath111 , where @xmath112 is the proper time .",

    "moreover , at @xmath121 ( or @xmath54 ) , the acceleration becomes infinite which corresponds to the trajectory of a null ray .",
    "all observers held at @xmath122 see the null ray as an acceleration horizon and they will never see events beyond this null ray .      for @xmath13 we perform the following coordinate transformation @xmath123",
    "the metric then becomes @xmath124 ,   \\label{metricq }   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath125 consider the timelike observer at fixed spacial position described by the worldline @xmath126 .",
    "the proper acceleration @xmath127 now has a magnitude @xmath128 the observer at @xmath117 ( or @xmath118 ) is being accelerated with a constant acceleration @xmath129 , while those at @xmath130 ( or @xmath131 ) are being accelerated with infinite acceleration .",
    "this shows that for @xmath13 , @xmath132 is indeed an accelerating horizon .",
    "we need to consider 3 different cases .      after performing the coordinate transformation of the same form with ( [ 3.1 - 1 ] ) but with @xmath133 we can rewrite the metric ( [ metric1 ] ) in the form ( [ metricone ] ) with @xmath134 taking the form ( [ 3.1 - 2 ] ) .",
    "then we consider the timelike observer @xmath135 at fixed spacial position .",
    "the magnitude of the proper acceleration observed by this observer takes exactly the same form as ( [ mag ] ) , now with @xmath136 and @xmath137 given by ( [ aell2 ] ) .",
    "the observer at @xmath117 ( or @xmath118 ) is accelerated with a constant acceleration @xmath129 , and at @xmath121 ( or @xmath54 ) , the acceleration becomes infinite , signifying the existence of an acceleration horizon .",
    "in this case we have @xmath91 , i.e. @xmath90 . a possible coordinate change is given by @xmath138 after which the metric becomes @xmath139 with @xmath140 the metric ( [ metric6alpha ] ) does not explicitly contain a horizon , and so is not applicable for evaluating infinite magnitude of the proper acceleration at the horizon .",
    "however , this form of the metric is explicitly conformal to minkowski metric , as apposed to the previous 3 cases which are conformal to the standard form of de sitter metric , so we keep it here .    to actually realize that the double horizon at @xmath90 is indeed an acceleration horizon , we take an alternative route . we observe that the same metric ( [ metricone ] ) can also describe the einstein spacetime with @xmath141 , provided @xmath134 is given in the form ( [ 3.1 - 2 ] ) with @xmath142 therefore , we can borrow the result from the previous case ( i.e. the case @xmath143 ) and taking the limit @xmath144 . in this way we should again find that the timelike observer at fixed spacial position will observe a proper acceleration of magnitude @xmath145 at the horizon @xmath121 and @xmath146 at @xmath117 .",
    "now we make the coordinate transformation of the same form with ( [ 3.1 - 1 ] ) but with @xmath147 doing so the metric ( [ metric1 ] ) is turned into the form @xmath148 \\label{metricthree}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath134 taking the form ( [ 3.1 - 2 ] ) .",
    "then the magnitude of the acceleration for the timelike observer @xmath149 at fixed spacial position turns out to be @xmath150 at @xmath117 ( or @xmath118 ) the acceleration is again the same constant @xmath129 .",
    "however , the magnitude of the acceleration never blows up to infinity , showing that there is no acceleration horizons , which is in agreement with the fact that @xmath22 has no zeros in the original metric in this case .",
    "having established that real zeros of @xmath22 correspond to acceleration horizons , we now calculate the area of these horizons .",
    "the metric of the horizons can be written as @xmath151 where @xmath134 is given by ( [ 3.1 - 2 ] ) or ( [ gamma0 ] ) with @xmath121 according to different values of @xmath1 .",
    "the area of the horizons can be easily evaluated using the formula @xmath152 where the integration with respect to @xmath153 and @xmath32 is taken over @xmath154 , @xmath155 .",
    "the integration with respect to @xmath31 depends on the value of @xmath1 : for @xmath156 , the integration is taken over @xmath157 , while for @xmath158 , the integration is taken over @xmath159 .    for @xmath11",
    ", we get a finite result @xmath160 for @xmath161 cases , the area of the horizons always diverges .",
    "this result is in agreement with the common knowledge that the einstein manifolds with @xmath162 are compact , while those with @xmath163 are non - compact .",
    "by direct calculations it can be seen that the weyl tensor for metric ( [ metric1 ] ) is identically zero .",
    "this signifies that the spacetime is conformally flat , very similar to the case of the standard form of ds , ads and minkowski spacetimes . in this section ,",
    "we are aimed at exploring the relationship between our metric ( [ metric1 ] ) and the standard ds / ads/ minkowski spacetimes .",
    "it will be shown that our metric is indeed equivalent to the standard ds / ads / minkowski spacetimes , although written in different coordinate systems .",
    "for this reason we adopt some exterior geometric techniques and consider the @xmath11 and @xmath15 cases as some hyperboloids embedded in 6d flat spacetime . for @xmath13 , however , we shall show directly that our metric is the 5d minkowski spacetime written in a particular coordinate system .",

    "similar transformations can be found in @xcite , while treating the massless uncharged limit of the 4d ds c - metric .",
    "this justifies that the metric ( [ metricone ] ) ( and hence ( [ metric1 ] ) for @xmath11 ) is just the 5d de sitter spacetime in a particular accelerating coordinate system .",
    "we will show that for this particular value of @xmath1 , our metric is just the 5d minkowski spacetime written in a particular coordinate system .",
    "for this purpose , we will not resort to embedding into 6d spacetime but stick to 5d description instead .",
    "the procedure to be carried out below is inspired by the work of @xcite and the logic is basically the same as in the @xmath13 case of @xcite .    consider the following 4d algebraic surface embedded in a 5d euclidean space , @xmath170 for constants @xmath171 , this equation describes a compact 4-dimensional surface of topology @xmath172 .",

    "<S> a 5-dimensional einstein spacetime with ( non)vanishing cosmological constant is analyzed in detail . </S>",
    "<S> the metric is in close analogy with the 4-dimensional massless uncharged c - metric in many aspects . </S>",
    "<S> the coordinate system , horizons and causal structures , relations to standard form of de sitter , anti de sitter and minkowski vacua are investigated . after a boost and kaluza - klein reduction , we get an exact solution of 4-dimensional einstein - maxwell - liouville theory which reduces to a solution to einstein - liouville theory in the limit of zero boost velocity and to that of einstein - maxwell - dilaton theory in the case of zero cosmological constant . </S>"
