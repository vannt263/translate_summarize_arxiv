    "the experiments built during the past decade to measure direct cp violation in the two pion decays of the neutral kaons ( @xmath0 ) have renewed the interest in kaon physics .",
    "in addition to the measurement of @xmath0  @xcite , these experiments have re - written the particle data tables of the neutral kaons for what concerns rare and not - so - rare kaon decays , lifetimes and form factors .",
    "sometimes the new measurements disagreed with the old ones , some of which have been published more than thirty years ago . for instance , in the case of semileptonic decays , the new round of measurements changed significantly the experimental input to determine the ckm parameter @xmath1 .",
    "progress has not been limited to neutral kaons : a decisive search for direct cp violation in the three pion decays of charged kaons was performed at cern by the na48/2 experiment .",
    "we will briefly describe these results , including some very interesting and unexpected by - products .",
    "last but not least , we will review the present and future of rare kaon decays .",
    "unfortunately , during the past couple of years , all the us - based kaon projects have been stopped .",
    "nonetheless , new initiatives at the cern - sps and at the new j - parc facility in japan promise to exploit the remarkable physics potential offered by the study of rare kaon decays .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section  [ semileptonic ] , recent results on semileptonic kaon decays are presented .",
    "results from the the study of charged kaons by the cern experiment na48/2 are described in sections  [ na48/2 ] ,  [ cusp ] and  [ susy ] . in section  [ ckmmat ]",
    "we put rare kaon decays in the broader contest of flavor physics .",
    "progress toward the study of the very rare decay @xmath2 is given in section  [ e391a ] .",
    "finally , in section  [ kplus ] we review the prospects to make a definite measurement of @xmath3 at the cern sps .",
    "the cleanest determination of the @xmath5 product is provided by the study of @xmath6 decays for the following two reasons :    1 .",
    "given that the electron mass is very small and can be neglected , only one form factor enters the calculation of the the decay amplitude .",
    "2 .   there are no isospin - breaking uncertainties coming from the @xmath7 mixing which complicate the calculation of the form factor in charged kaon decays .",
    "the master formula is : @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the short distance electroweak correction  @xcite , @xmath10 is the long - distance radiative correction and @xmath11 is the fermi constant .",
    "in addition to the semileptonic branching ratio and @xmath12 lifetime ( @xmath13 ) , the form factor dependence is also needed as experimental input because it enters in the phase space integral ( @xmath14 ) calculation .",
    "ktev , na48 and kloe have provided measurements of the semileptonic branching ratio of the long - lived neutral kaon  @xcite and the results are reported in table  [ ke3 ] .",
    "the new values are all significantly higher than previously accepted .",
    ".recent measurements of @xmath15 . [ cols=\"<,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ ke3 ]    what makes the kloe results particularly interesting is the unique feature of the @xmath16 factory .",
    "the da@xmath17ne @xmath18 collider operates at the formation energy of the @xmath16 meson which subsequently decays into a pair of kaons .",
    "the quantum numbers of the @xmath16 meson guarantee that the pair of neutral kaons are self - tagged .",
    "thus , the reconstruction of a @xmath19 meson on one side of the detector determines the presence of a @xmath20 on the other side and vice versa .",
    "this fact opens the possibility to study absolute branching ratios without problems related to the normalization channel .",
    "another advantage is that the @xmath16 is almost at rest in the laboratory frame and therefore the momentum of the kaons is almost monochromatic . in turn",
    "this simplifies the reconstruction of the semileptonic decays since there are no ambiguities due to the unmeasured momentum of the escaping neutrino .",
    "several measurements of the @xmath21 form factor dependence has been recently published  @xcite .",
    "the dependence on the momentum transfered to the @xmath22 system @xmath23 has been described by a linear , quadratic or pole - model dependence .",
    "the quadratic dependence is expressed according to the relation : @xmath24 the parameters extracted from the quadratic form are strongly anti - correlated and there is no agreement between the quadratic terms measured by ktev and na48 .",
    "very recently , the results from kloe  @xcite have become available : @xmath25 these results agree with the determinations of na48 and slightly disagree with the determination of ktev .",
    "the alternative parametrization made using a pole model fit to the vector gives : @xmath26 mev .",
    "a third advantage is given by the small q value of the @xmath27 decay .",
    "the @xmath12 moves at small momentum @xmath28 mev/_c _ and has a short mean free path before decaying ( @xmath29 340 cm ) .",
    "thus , a large fraction of the decays are collected from the fiducial volume of the detector , opening the possibility to make a good measurement of the @xmath20 lifetime ( @xmath13 ) , an important input to the computation of @xmath30 .",
    "it is worth to mention that the previous precise measurement of the @xmath20 lifetime was performed   more than 30 years ago  @xcite : @xmath31 ns .",
    "the measurement of the @xmath20 lifetime can be performed by kloe into two independent ways : either directly , reconstructing the proper time distribution of the kaons using @xmath32 decays  @xcite , or indirectly by requiring the sum of the branching ratios of the seven largest decay modes to be one  @xcite .",
    "the two determinations of the life - time are independent .",
    "averaging the two measurements kloe quotes : @xmath33 which improves by a factor of two over the previous best result .",
    "given the new precise experimental input , to answer the question whether or not the sum of the square of the elements belonging to the first row of the ckm matrix satisfies unitary relies on which theoretical input is used for @xmath34 .",
    "a recent review prepared by blucher and marciano  @xcite for the review of particle properties advocates the use of the original form factor calculation by leutwyler and roos  @xcite : @xmath35 . taking this value into account ,",
    "the value of @xmath1 is found to be :    @xmath36    a pictorial representation of the state - of - the art results is shown in fig .",

    "the cern sps has remained the only source of high energy secondary hadron beams .",
    "after the completion of the @xmath0 program and of the follow - up experiment ( na48/1 ) devoted to the study of rare @xmath19 decays , the na48 collaboration has collected data with two simultaneous charged beams of opposite polarity with the main objective to study direct cp violation in charged kaon decays into three pions .",

    "using the formalism of this improved description , the na48/2 data yield  @xcite : @xmath90 the additional external error of @xmath91 has been assigned to cover the branching ratio uncertainty and the theoretical error .",
    "the result is in good agreement with the latest theoretical prediction based on the framework of chiral perturbation theory  @xcite : @xmath92",
    "the large kaon decay exposure accumulated by na48/2 has revamped the interest to look with better precision to the two - body leptonic kaon decays which are suppressed by helicity conservation in the the standard model but generally unsuppressed in extensions of it .",
    "an example is given by the ratio @xmath93 , defined as follows : @xmath94 a new measurement of @xmath93 based on data collected by na48/2 during the 2003 sps proton run was presented at the hep2005 europhysics conference in lisbon  @xcite : @xmath95 this value is to be compared with the theoretical prediction @xmath96 and the present world average  @xcite : @xmath97 .",
    "the slight discrepancy between the measurement and the prediction has triggered theoretical interest . in a recent article  @xcite , the role of low energy supersymmetric ( susy ) extensions of the standard model to @xmath93",
    "was examined . in general",
    "the ratio can be written as : @xmath98 the authors point out that for some possible regions of the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) is possible to obtain @xmath99 of the order of @xmath100 and that such large contributions would arise from lepton flavor violation ( lfv ) effects .",
    "the quantity which accounts for the deviation from the @xmath101 universality is : @xmath102 with the sum extended to all neutrino flavors because experimentally one determines only the flavor of the charged lepton .",
    "the dominant contributions to @xmath103 arise from the charged higgs exchange and it is proportional to @xmath104 , to the fourth power of the charged higgs mass and the square of the flavor changing parameter .",
    "in the first section of this article we have described the progress on the determination of the magnitude of the ckm parameter @xmath30 from _ frequent _ tree kaon decays .",
    "we now address those rare kaon decays which allow us to learn short distance information and that , if the standard model is assumed , determine the magnitude and the phase of another ckm parameter , @xmath105 .",

    "can be outlined as follows :    1 .",
    "determine the magnitude of the ckm parameters from semileptonic meson decays or from oscillations .",

    "* @xmath125 + the cleanest determination of @xmath126 is obtained the mixing - induced , time - dependent cp violating asymmetry in @xmath127 . *   @xmath128 + a tree level determination of @xmath129 requires , for instance",
    ", the study of @xmath130 and @xmath131 decays .",
    "3 .   look for new physics by studying highly suppressed flavor changing neutral current ( fcnc ) processes which proceed through loop diagrams .",
    "decisive tests can be done if the standard model predictions are precise , that is immune from hadronic uncertainties , and the loop contributions are short distance dominated .",
    "these observables can be affected by contributions from new degrees of freedom in the loops and a deviation from the standard model predictions would signal new physics .",
    "the best examples are given by rare kaon decays , @xmath132 leptonic decays and forward - backward asymmetries in @xmath132 decays : * @xmath133 * @xmath3 * @xmath134 * @xmath135 * @xmath136",
    "while the theoretical error of prominent fcnc processes , such us @xmath138 and @xmath139 , amount to @xmath140 or larger , the irreducible theoretical uncertainty on the @xmath141 amounts to only 1 - 2%  @xcite .",
    "the standard model prediction can be expressed as follows  @xcite : @xmath142 the error is completely dominated by @xmath116 and by the value of @xmath143 implied from the fits to the unitarity triangles .",
    "the error is therefore parametric in nature and not due to uncertainties related to theoretical errors or hadronic matrix elements .",
    "this miraculous situation derives from the fact that these decays are mediated by a single operator and the corresponding hadronic matrix element can be experimentally measured from the semileptonic tree decays .",
    "this situation is unique in the field of meson physics .",
    "this is true for both @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "the experimental information on the @xmath2 has recently been improved by the first dedicated attempt , experiment e391a at the kek ps  @xcite . before we describe the experimental result obtained by e391a , we need to spend a few words on the experimental difficulty to measure such a theoretically clean but elusive decay .",
    "obviously the neutrino - antineutrino pair can not be measured .",
    "conceptually one would like to know as much as possible about the incoming neutral kaon : for instance making the neutral kaons at a @xmath16 factory where particle have a well defined momentum would simplify the analysis .",
    "in addition , by reconstructing the direction accompanying short - lived neutral kaon , the line - of - flight of the @xmath20 is known and the initial state is fully constrained .",
    "unfortunately , given the small cross - section to make @xmath16 mesons in @xmath18 annihilations , and the limited luminosity achievable at low energy colliders , there is just no way to envisage the study of very rare kaon decays at a @xmath16 factory .",
    "the only viable method to produce a large enough amount of @xmath20 is to make the kaons using a proton beam hitting a fixed target .",
    "as far as the kaon flux is concerned , the energy of the proton beam is not critical as long as it is high enough to make kaons with good efficiency ( that is as long as the energy of the primary protons is well above the threshold to make kaons ! ) .",
    "it is possible to determine the momentum of the neutral kaon by time of flight ( tof ) but only if its momentum is kept to be less than 1 gev/_c_. this was the method proposed by the kopio experiment  @xcite , which unfortunately will not be built .",
    "the tof technique is very expensive in the use of protons because in order to make low energy kaons , the neutral beam needs to be taken at a large production angle .",
    "this implies that to collect a sufficient flux of neutral kaons , a very wide beam acceptance needs to be considered . in turn , the useful acceptance of practical detectors tend to be very small .",
    "currently , the only method being pursued to study @xmath2 is the so called _ pencil beam _ technique .",
    "pioneered by ktev at fermilab , it consist in making neutral kaons together with many many neutrons and photons unfortunately! taking the neutral beam at a small production angle and to keep the acceptance of the beam small in order to be able to use the beam direction as kinematical constrain in the form of a minimum transverse momentum cut .",
    "this is useful , for instance , to reject @xmath144 decays where the neutron escapes detection and the @xmath145 could mimic the final state under study .",
    "if the kaon momentum is unknown , the only handle available is to fully measure the @xmath145 in the final state and hermetically veto any other particle .",
    "this method was proposed by kami  @xcite at fermilab and not considered viable by a technical review committee .",
    "nevertheless , the same method , in a step - by - step approach is being applied by the kek e391a experiment at the 12 gev ps and proposed for further studies at the j - parc hadron facility .",
    "three e391a runs have taken place .",
    "results from a fraction of the first one where presented by k.  sakashita at the kaon2005 conference  @xcite : @xmath146    this result is far from the interesting region which the experiment aims to test . with the data collected so far , there is hope to reach the grossman - nir model - independent upper bound   @xcite : @xmath147 a letter of intent to continue studies at j - parc has been submitted  @xcite .",
    "the situation concerning the charged kaon mode is radically different because there are already experimental results with the sensitivity of the standard model .",
    "it should also be clarified that the physics of the @xmath3 mode differs from the corresponding neutral kaon :    * the decay is not dominated by cp violating effects . * owing to the charm contribution which entails uncertainties related to the quark masses and scale uncertainties , the prediction , although very precise , can not match the accuracy of the @xmath20 mode .",
    "the two modes are complementary and their simultaneous measurement would allow us to determine @xmath126 from loop processes in a completely independent way , providing a decisive test of the standard model .",
    "the standard model prediction can be parameterized as follows  @xcite :      the recent nnlo calculation  @xcite has reduced the purely theoretical error to an extend that will not be matched by experiments for some time .",
    "in fact on the experimental side , thanks to the endeavor at bnl , where the decay was studied with stopped kaons by e787 and its upgraded version , e949 , progress has been steady over the years , leading to the publication of three candidates and to a first determination of the branching ratio  @xcite :      the mean value is about two times larger than the standard model prediction but , given the large errors , completely in agreement with it . unfortunately e949 was terminated prematurely and we are not learning as fast as possible about this interesting decay .",
    "plans to pursue the stopped kaon technique exist in japan in the form of a letter of intent  @xcite . in the long run , to be useful , further studies shall aim to accumulate order - of - magnitude larger event samples in order to precisely measure the strength of the @xmath151 transitions .",
    "this was the purpose of fermilab proposal called _ charged kaons at the main injector _ or ckm for short  @xcite .",
    "the proposal intended to study decays in flights from a high momentum ( 21 gev/_c _ ) separated kaon beam . to keep the background small , redundant measurements of the momentum of the incoming kaon and outgoing pion",
    "were to be done employing magnetic and velocity ( rich ) spectrometers , with photon vetoes surrounding the decay tank to veto @xmath145 from @xmath152 decays and photons from radiative decays .",
    "the experiment was approved five years ago but never funded and eventually terminated .    to be effective in reducing background coming from @xmath152 where the @xmath145 is lost and the angle between the @xmath37 and the @xmath153 is mistakenly reconstructed , the use of even higher kaon beam momentum is preferable because the capability to detect photons with calorimetric detectors improves as a function of the energy .",
    "this is the consideration at the base of proposal p-326 for the cern sps .",
    "the cern sps delivers protons of 400 gev/_c_. to optimise the number of useful decays , the secondary beam is chosen to have 75 gev/_c_. requiring the @xmath153 to have less than 35 gev of energy , leaves at least 40 gev of energy associated to the @xmath145 .",
    "such large amount of electromagnetic energy can not be missed in the calorimeter ! the importance to suppress the two body decay @xmath152 can be appreciated from fig .",
    "[ kinem ] where it is shown how this decay forces one to split the signal acceptance in two missing mass regions .",
    "the drawback of this design is that the momentum of the secondary beam is too high to separate kaons from protons and pions by means of radio frequency cavities .",
    "although only about 6% of particles are kaons and only @xmath154 10% of the kaons decay in the useful decay volume , all particles ( 800 mhz ) have to be tracked and precisely timed .",
    "this is the main challenge of the proposal .",
    "in addition to the availability of the sps , which will definitely operate in the future because it is needed to inject protons in the lhc , the proposal builds on the experience and infrastructure of na48 . in particular , the experimental hall , the target , the beam line , the decay tank , the spectrometer dipole magnet and the liquid krypton calorimeter will be used in the new experiment",

    "it is know by the sequential number p-326 but also as na48/3 because it builds on the expertise and infrastructure of na48 .",
