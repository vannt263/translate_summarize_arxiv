    "over the past several decades , many large eddy simulation ( les ) models have been introduced and tested , with varying degrees of success ; see e.g.  @xcite for extensive overviews .",
    "each of these models has its share of good and bad properties , and with each generation of models , the amount of `` good '' tends to increase while the amount of `` bad '' tends to decrease .",
    "two attractive models of the current generation are approximate deconvolution models ( adms )  @xcite , and voigt regularization models  @xcite , both of which have recently seen significant interest from both mathematicians and engineers .",
    "these models are known to be well - posed  @xcite , have attractive physical properties ( such as energy and helicity conservation and cascades  @xcite ) , and have performed well in ( at least some ) numerical simulations  @xcite , including when applied to the euler equations for ideal fluids  @xcite .",
    "however , both models have their downsides : it is unknown how to efficiently and stably implement the usual adm with standard finite element methods , and the voigt regularization model can lack accuracy , likely due to its low consistency error with both the navier - stokes equations ( nse ) @xmath0 and the spatially filtered nse  @xcite . here",
    "@xmath1 denotes the fluid velocity and @xmath2 the kinematic pressure .    in the recent papers",
    "@xcite , a new system was proposed as an alteration of the usual adm , but which is amenable to unconditionally stable and efficient implementation in a finite element context . here",
    ", we add further insight in the derivation , from an abstract point of view , see section  [ sec : derivation ] . this model , which we study herein , is referred to as the reduced - order adm ( radm ) , and is given by @xmath3 where the vector @xmath4 represents an averaged velocity , @xmath5 a modified pressure , while @xmath6 is an approximate deconvolution operator meant to represent an approximate inverse to the helmholtz filter @xmath7 , with @xmath8 satisfying the filter equation : @xmath9 the evolution system  - requires an initial condition for velocity , and both the filter and evolution systems require appropriate boundary conditions . by restricting to the space - periodic setting ( as usual for these problems , with only a very few remarkable exceptions ) , we can assume @xmath6 to be linear , positive , self - adjoint , to commute with @xmath7 , and moreover that there exists @xmath10 such that @xmath11 where @xmath12 denotes the operator norm of @xmath6 .",
    "these assumptions are true for most common types of approximate deconvolution defined with the helmholtz filtering operation , including van cittert  @xcite , multiscale  @xcite , tikhonov , and tikhonov - lavrentiev  @xcite , see also the review in  @xcite . while we will often be general in our use of @xmath6 , in some circumstances such as computations and energy spectra calculations , it is necessary to select a specific operator . in these cases , we will use the most common type of approximate deconvolution , van cittert , and we will denote @xmath13 , where @xmath14 denotes the order of deconvolution . this operator is defined in detail in section  [ sec : notation ] .",
    "the radm system  - was derived from the fourth - order version of the adm by making the approximation @xmath15 in the viscous term , which reduced the fourth order system to second order .",
    "this system was proved to be well posed in  @xcite and of high order consistency with the spatially filtered nse . in  @xcite , with @xmath6 chosen to be van cittert approximate deconvolution , an efficient finite element implementation of the radm performed very well on the @xmath16 turbulent channel flow benchmark test , as well as in a 2d benchmark flow problem with a contraction and two outlets .",
    "* plan of the paper . *",
    "it is the purpose of this paper to study some fundamental mathematical and physical properties of the model  - .",
    "after providing mathematical preliminaries in section  [ sec : notation ] , we show a strong connection between the radm   and the ns - voigt model   in section  [ sec : derivation ] . in fact , we show that the radm can be considered as a ns - voigt - deconvolution model .",
    "that is , if the regularization operator @xmath17 is replaced with @xmath18 , then the radm is recovered after a change of variables .",
    "this is interesting and important since a significant amount of theory has been developed for the ns - voigt model by titi and coworkers in e.g.  @xcite as well as in  @xcite .",
    "we also show that ns - voigt can be derived using the approximate deconvolution approach originally developed by stolz and adams  @xcite . in this respect",
    "we establish a strong tie between voigt - type models and approximate deconvolution type models in general .",
    "an energy analysis of the radm is given in section  4 .",
    "this includes an energy balance and a kraichnan - type analysis of the energy spectra of the model .",
    "some numerical results are also given here , to back up the theory .",
    "our results reveal that the radm is more computable than the nse and has spectral scaling similar to the leray-@xmath19 model  @xcite , which matches that of true fluid flow on larger scales in the inertial range , but smaller scales are transferred more quickly to even smaller scales .",
    "moreover , our analysis shows that increasing the deconvolution order @xmath14 shortens the inertial range and creates less energy in each scale .",
    "section 5 considers long - time behavior of the model , and proves existence of smooth global attractors .",
    "section 6 considers the pseudo - parabolic nature of the system , and presents a study of some analytical properties and the model s treatment of pulsatile flow , which is an interesting example because it allows for exact analytical solutions .",
    "finally , conclusions are drawn in the final section , and prospective future work is discussed .",
    "we present here notation and mathematical preliminaries to make the analysis of later sections smoother . as is typical with theoretical analyses of fluid models ,",
    "we restrict our attention herein to problems involving periodic flows on the box @xmath20 .",
    "we stress that all machinery requires the space - periodic setting to have the commutation between the deconvolution operator and general differential operators .",
    "the application of adm methods to motion bounded by rigid walls is problematic and the theory is still missing . some results in special geometries can be found in  @xcite . in this framework ,",
    "ns - voigt represents one of the few models which is naturally set in a bounded domain with dirichlet conditions .",
    "furthermore , we consider the system  - to be non - dimensionalized by introducing @xmath21 , @xmath22 , and @xmath23 for the characteristic length , velocity , and time scales .",
    "thus , the viscosity @xmath24 can be considered dimensionless and representing the inverse of the reynolds number of the flow . to simplify the notation , in the theorems",
    "we will suppose without loss of generality that @xmath25 .",
    "we characterize the divergence - free spaces by using fourier series on the 3d torus .",
    "we denote by @xmath26 the orthonormal basis of @xmath27 , and by @xmath28 the standard point in @xmath27 .",
    "let @xmath29 be the torus defined by @xmath30 .",
    "we use @xmath31 and @xmath32 to denote the @xmath33 norm and inner product , and we impose the zero mean - value condition on velocity , pressure , and external force .",
    "we will use the customary lebesgue @xmath34 and sobolev @xmath35 spaces , and for simplicity ( if not explicitly needed ) we do not distinguish between scalar and vector valued real functions .",
    "we define , for any exponent @xmath36 , @xmath37 where @xmath38 ^ 3 $ ] and if @xmath39 the condition @xmath40 must be understood in a weak sense . for @xmath41",
    ", we can expand the velocity field with fourier series as follows @xmath42 and the fourier coefficients are given by @xmath43 , with @xmath44 the lebesgue measure of @xmath45 .",
    "if @xmath46 , then the @xmath47 norm is defined by @xmath48 where , as above , @xmath49 .",
    "the inner products associated with these norms are @xmath50 we can finally characterize @xmath51 as follows : @xmath52 recall that due to the zero mean value , the poincar inequality holds in @xmath53 : there exists @xmath54 such that for every @xmath55 , @xmath56 this inequality will be used extensively in our analysis , and allows us to use the more convenient gradient norm in place of the @xmath53 norm .",
    "we assume the deconvolution operator @xmath6 is self adjoint and commutes with both @xmath57 and @xmath7 .",
    "these assumptions are known to be satisfied for van cittert approximate deconvolution  @xcite , multiscale deconvolution  @xcite , tikhonov , and tikhonov - lavrentiev  @xcite .",
    "see also the reviews in  @xcite for more results about these operators .",
    "we denote the filtering operator @xmath58 , and we introduce now a family of abstract deconvolution operators @xmath59 , which are of order zero , and such that @xmath60 we note that van cittert approximate deconvolution , @xmath61 forms such a family , and the other types of deconvolution mentioned above can also be written to satisfy the above limiting property .",
    "although we will use a general deconvolution operator @xmath6 when possible , in some analysis ( e.g. energy spectra analysis ) and for computations , it is necessary to specify a specific operator . in these cases",
    ", we will use van cittert approximate deconvolution , as it is one of the most popular in the adm community .",
    "the basic properties we will use of the operator @xmath13 are summarized in the following lemma , see  @xcite .",
    "[ lem : lower_bound ] for each @xmath62 the operator @xmath63 is self - adjoint , it commutes with differentiation , and the following properties hold true : if @xmath64 denotes the symbol of the operator @xmath65 , then @xmath66    this lemma shows that in the specific case of practical use , we can assume that the upper and lower bounds for @xmath64 are @xmath67 and @xmath68 , which reflects in similar bounds for @xmath69 .",
    "we define now the notion of weak solution for the radm .",
    "we say that @xmath70 is a weak solution to  - if @xmath71     + ( d v \\cdot \\nabla d v,\\phi )      + \\nu ( \\nabla d v,\\nabla \\phi )      =   ( f,\\phi),\\ ] ] for all @xmath72 , and also provided that @xmath73 and the following energy identity holds true : @xmath74    we have the following existence and uniqueness theorem , which is based on a standard galerkin approach , together with the energy estimate   below , see  ( * ? ? ?",
    "[ thm : existence ] let @xmath75 and @xmath76 be given . then , there exists a unique weak solution to  - .",
    "the proof of this result is standard and follows the same guidelines of the results in  @xcite , with the key point being the energy identity  . from  @xcite , with the assumptions on the data , we have that the solution @xmath77 , and so all manipulations in this proof are justified .",
    "multiplying   by @xmath78 and integrating over the physical domain gives @xmath79 and then using a vector identity on the first two terms , and that @xmath80 , both the pressure and nonlinear terms vanish , leaving us with @xmath81 integrating in time over @xmath82 $ ] provides  .",
    "this equality shows that the galerkin approximate solution @xmath83 is bounded uniformly in @xmath84 .",

    "in particular , this proves that one can extract from the galerkin approximate functions a converging sub - sequence , and moreover shows also that the solution @xmath87;v^1)$ ] , which is a uniqueness class .",
    "the regularity of the time derivative allows to show that an energy equality ( instead of an inequality as for the nse ) holds true .    in the case of the problem without viscosity , i.e. the radm - euler equations @xmath88 by",
    "adapting techniques from  @xcite and by using the estimates on the operator @xmath6 from lemma  [ lem : lower_bound ] , it is easy to infer the following result ( the same applies also to the euler - voigt - deconvolution model , as discussed in the next section )    [ thm : existence - titi ] let @xmath89 , and @xmath90 .",

    "interestingly , despite its derivation as an altered / reduced adm , the proof for well - posedness of the system in  @xcite uses ideas of the well - posedness proof for ns - voigt from  @xcite .",
    "this suggests a connection between the two models , and we show now that a ns - voigt deconvolution model can be derived from  - .",
    "writing @xmath95 and setting @xmath96 yields @xmath97 this system  - is precisely the ns - voigt regularization except for the @xmath98 term included in the regularization , and thus we could refer to  - as the ns - voigt - deconvolution regularization .",
    "since the usual regularization in ns - voigt is given by just @xmath17 , and since @xmath99 , this `` new '' regularization @xmath18 will provide a higher order of consistency for  - to the nse ( which are recovered if no regularization is applied ) .    in this section",
    "we enlarge the derivation of the voigt models as given in  @xcite , and in particular we highlight the fact that voigt models can be seen as adms .",
    "the euler - voigt equations read as @xmath100 and have been introduced in the les community by cao , lunasin , and titi  @xcite .",
    "they started from the inviscid `` simplified bardina '' , which is the same model studied in layton and lewandowski  @xcite ( zeroth order stolz and adams ) in the case @xmath101 .",
    "the exact words are `` _ _ ... therefore , we propose the inviscid simplified bardina model as regularization of the 3d euler equations that could be implemented in numerical computations of three dimensional inviscid flows . _ _ '' they then re - introduced the viscosity , obtaining the ns - voigt equations  - .",
    "later , in larios and titi  @xcite , the model is justified as follows `` _ _  it was noted in cao lunasin and titi  @xcite that formally setting @xmath101 in simplified bardina amounts to simply adding the term @xmath102 to the left - hand side of the euler equations yielding what they call the euler - voigt equations .",
    "remarkably , if one reintroduces the viscous term @xmath103 the resulting equations happen to coincide with equations governing certain visco - elastic fluids known as kelvin - voigt fluids , which were first introduced and studied by a.p .",
    "oskolkov  @xcite .",
    "we show now that the ns - voigt model can also be derived with usual modeling techniques and in the unified framework of deconvolution models .",

    "this section studies the treatment of energy of the radm system .",
    "we begin with the energy balance , which is useful both in obtaining a priori estimates for existence theorems and as a starting point to study the radm energy cascade .",
    "then , a kraichnan - type analysis of the radm energy cascade is given , followed by some numerical experiments to test the energy cascade in forced , homogeneous , and isotropic turbulent flows .",
    "energy is a quantity of fundamental importance in fluid flow modeling , both in terms of the physical relevance of its solutions and its potential for success in simulations . for a model to be successful in accurate coarse mesh simulations",
    ", it must dissipate sufficient energy to remain stable .",
    "we show here that the deconvolution in the radm acts as an energy sponge , which seems to explain a smoothing effect from increasing deconvolution in the radm that was observed in  @xcite with van cittert approximate deconvolution , and in  @xcite with multiscale deconvolution .",
    "we present now some integral identities and estimates , which -at the level of faedo - galerkin approximations- are the core to obtain existence of weak solutions . at the level of weak solutions ( which are smooth enough ) they are still valid and",
    "show the balance of the main flow quantities .",
    "equation   shows that the radm conserves a model energy @xmath115 the conservation of the energy is one of the outstanding open problems for the navier - stokes equations .",
    "the analysis of the conservation of the model energy for les models started with the analysis in  @xcite , and several adm models share this property .",
    "we note that since @xmath116 , the balance   suggests that deconvolution in the radm increases the effective viscosity .",
    "this is consistent with numerical results in  @xcite , which reported a smoothing effect by increasing the deconvolution order .",
    "this section presents an analytic and computational study of the radm energy spectra . a widely accepted theory of turbulent flows starting with intuitions of l.f .",
    "richardson and a.n .",
    "kolmogorov is that energy is input at large scales , transferred from large to small scales through the inertial range , and finally dissipated at small scales by viscosity  @xcite .",
    "it is further believed that viscosity has no effect except on very small scales , on which it acts to decay exponentially fast .    to fully resolve a turbulent flow",
    ", one must resolve the nse on this entire range of active scales , which is far beyond the limit of modern computational tools for high reynolds number problems .",
    "computing the nse without full resolution is widely known to be unstable . for a model to be computable in practice",
    ", its range of active scales needs to be significantly smaller than for the nse , and thus studying its energy spectra can help make such a determination .",
    "since the radm takes a form similar ( in some sense ) to that of leray-@xmath19 , ns-@xmath19 , and the simplified bardina models , we adapt physics - based energy spectra analysis performed in  @xcite for these respective models .",
    "we begin with a decomposition of the velocity into its fourier modes , which gives the energy balance @xmath117 where @xmath118 is the fourier transform of the deconvolution operator @xmath65 , and @xmath119 with @xmath120 note that @xmath121 represents the net amount of energy transferred into wave numbers between @xmath122 .",
    "time averaging the energy balance   gives the energy transfer equation @xmath123 since the radm model energy is defined by  , as this is the conserved quantity in the absence of viscosity and external forces , we take @xmath13 and define the model energy of an eddy of size @xmath124 by @xmath125 combining this with the energy transfer equation   gives the relation @xmath126 with the last relation coming from lemma  [ lem : lower_bound ] , since @xmath127 for sufficiently large @xmath128 .",
    "if the wave number @xmath128 belongs to the inertial range , then @xmath129 and there is no leakage of energy through dissipation .",
    "then , we have that @xmath128 is in the inertial range if @xmath130 this shows that increasing the deconvolution order @xmath14 has the effect of shortening the inertial range of the radm .",
    "this is consistent with the energy balance given above , which suggests that increasing @xmath14 reduces the total energy and increases the effective viscosity .    to determine the kinetic energy distribution in the inertial range , we begin by defining the average velocity of a size @xmath124 eddy , and relating it to model energy via @xmath131 the total energy dissipation rate",

    "if @xmath140 , then @xmath141 and if @xmath142 , then we get @xmath143 these scalings suggest that for larger scales in the inertial range , a @xmath144 roll - off of energy is expected , but for smaller wave numbers , the slope increases to @xmath145 .",
    "this implies that significantly less energy will be held in higher wave numbers , suggesting the model is indeed more easily computable than the nse , which has a @xmath144 roll - off of energy through its entire inertial range .      to test some of these scaling results , a direct numerical simulation ( dns ) of the non - dimensionalized radm",
    "is performed for forced turbulence , which is one of the most extensively simulated turbulent flows ( see e.g. ,  @xcite ) . in particular , we study the energy spectrum of the model for three - dimensional homogeneous and isotropic turbulent flow , on a periodic cubic box with a side length @xmath146 , with reynolds number @xmath147 .",
    "we use a pseudo - spectral method for the spatial discretization of the model with full de - aliasing , and a second - order adams  bashforth scheme for the time stepping .",
    "in addition , we employ a forcing method used by chen et al .",
    "@xcite and she et al .",
    "the numerical forcing of a turbulent flow is the artificial addition of energy at the large scales in a numerical simulation .",

    "van cittert deconvolution is used with order @xmath148 , and we will specify @xmath14 in the plots .",
    "we first begin by testing the scaling law in the previous section , which predicts that the kinetic energy scales with @xmath144 at the beginning of the inertial range , and transitions to @xmath145 near the end of the inertial range .",

    "we also investigate the sensitivity of @xmath14 on the energy spectra of the radm . here , we compute with @xmath151 resolution , @xmath152 and @xmath148 .",
    "results are shown in figure  [ espchn ] , and we observe ( as our analysis predicts ) the radm energy curves shorten as @xmath14 increases ; that is , as @xmath14 is increased , there is less ( or equal ) energy in each wave number across the entire spectrum .",
    "this shows there is less total energy in the @xmath149 system than @xmath153 , and @xmath153 compared to @xmath154 , which is in agreement with the above analysis .",
    "lastly , we use this experiment setup to test the accuracy of the radm energy spectra against a dns of the nse . in figure",

    "we follow very closely the approach in  @xcite and we just highlight the changes needed to adapt the proof to the new radm system . the main difference with respect to the latter reference is that , due to the presence of approximate deconvolution operators , we need to deal with the space - periodic case .    for simplicity of analysis and notation , following  @xcite in this section",

    ".    then we take  - and we test it by @xmath201 ( procedure which can be again justified by approximation with faedo - galerkin method ) .",
    "we observe that @xmath202 , by definition .",
    "hence , by noting that @xmath203 we get @xmath204 using previous estimates we obtain @xmath205 and the bound on @xmath206 implies that @xmath207 is bounded in @xmath208 .",
    "this means that @xmath167 maps @xmath53 into @xmath208 , and thanks to the compact embedding @xmath209 , @xmath167 is compact .",
    "thus the assumptions of theorem  [ thm : attract ] are satisfied , and we conclude that @xmath176 is asymptotically compact . by  @xcite , we conclude that @xmath176 has a global attractor in @xmath53 ; the rest of the proof follows as in  @xcite . with the same arguments one can also show",
    "that if the force is smoother , say in @xmath210 , then the attractor is a compact set in @xmath211 .",
    "in this section we perform some analytical computations with very classical tools , in order to focus on some special analytical features of the solutions of voigt models and also to better understand the possible role of the radm ( and thus the ns - voigt system for @xmath212 ) in modeling of visco - elastic flows .",
    "we recall that prior to turbulence modeling , ns - voigt equations appeared as a linear model for certain non - newtonian fluids , see a series of papers by oskolkov  @xcite    in order to understand , at least qualitatively , the effect of the ( non - viscous ) damping term @xmath213 on the behavior of solutions , we restrict to the very simple setting of : a ) fully developed flows , that is the velocity is directed only along the axis of the pipe ; and b ) we restrict to the ns - voigt case ; that is , assume @xmath214 .",
    "the deconvolution order @xmath215 could be used , but details would change for each specific deconvolution operator , and also the analysis will become ( even more ) technical and also boundary conditions for filtering at the wall would need to be specified . under the two above assumptions we develop analytical solutions , and",
    "even if we are aware that these solutions are not turbulent and describe only the linear behavior , they constitute a good source of data for debugging complex codes , as only very few analytical solutions are known to exist .",
    "moreover , analytical solutions can be used to gain some physical insight into the model s solutions . on the other hand",
    ", we recall that a remarkable feature of the ns - voigt equations is that is one of the few les models which can be fully treated with dirichlet boundary conditions and with given external force , see  @xcite . since the ns - voigt equations can be treated in the presence of solid boundaries with dirichlet boundary conditions , it is natural to investigate some class of exact solutions for ns - voigt , as in the case of the nse , to directly compare the results",
    ".      in this section we make some remarks on the solution of the ns voigt equations , but similar reasoning can be transferred to the radm ( at least in the space periodic - setting , while here we have a problem with solid boundaries and zero dirichlet conditions ) . in particular , as remarked in larios  @xcite the ns - voigt have a pseudo - parabolic behavior , as the abstract equations considered in carroll and showalter  @xcite .",
    "one of the most interesting point is that the solution of the ns - voigt preserve the same regularity as the initial datum .",
    "contrary to the nse for the solution of the ns - voigt it is not possible to show an improvement of the regularity , especially for what concerns the space - variables .",
    "we recall that for the nse ( or more generally parabolic equations ) , as soon as a weak solution is strong , then it becomes smooth ( even @xmath216 if the force and the boundary of the domain are so ) for all positive times .",
    "this has particular consequences on the fine properties of weak solution of the nse , when obtained as limits of solutions to the ns - voigt equations as @xmath217 , see  @xcite .",
    "here we show with a particular simple example that the nonlinear ns - voigt can not produce an improvement of the regularity , by making some very explicit computations on the spectrum of the laplace operator .",
    "this can be also used to shed some light in the different behavior of the ns - voigt with respect to the nse , concerning some very special properties .",
    "let us consider the ns - voigt system in a special physical situation .",
    "we have a channel with cross section @xmath218 and with axis directed along the @xmath219-direction .",
    "we consider an incompressible fluid , modeled by ns - voigt equations in a semi - infinite straight pipe @xmath220 . in a reference frame with @xmath207 ( we call @xmath221 for historical reasons ) directed along the pipe axis and @xmath222 belonging to an orthogonal plane , the ns - voigt equations read @xmath223 where @xmath224 and @xmath225 respectively denote velocity and pressure , and @xmath24 represents kinematic viscosity .    in this subsection and",
    "later on also in section  [ sec : pulsatile ] we use the symbol @xmath224 to remember that the velocity is a vector field and that we will look for special solutions , where the axial velocity @xmath226 is the only non - zero one .    by following classical calculations dating back to hagen and poiseuille",
    ", we look for fully - developed solutions ( also named poiseuille - type solutions ) : @xmath227 where @xmath228 denotes an arbitrary function of time . the poiseuille - type _ ansatz _ implies that the convective term cancels out identically , and this motivates the statement that the results will concern only the linear behavior of solutions .",
    "moreover , it is easy to deduce from the equations that the pressure is @xmath229 .",
    "finally , the dependence of @xmath230 on the space variables @xmath231 and @xmath232 allows us to consider a problem reduced to the cross - section @xmath218 : in the so - called `` direct problem , '' without external force , a given pressure - drop is assigned and the problem is the following : given @xmath233 , find @xmath234 such that @xmath235 where @xmath236 denotes the laplacian with respect only to the variables @xmath231 and @xmath232 .    in this particular setting the nonlinear term is identically vanishing , but we still have a boundary value problem .",
    "we will start by making some explicit calculations in the case @xmath233 is extremely smooth , say @xmath237 and we assign an initial datum @xmath238 .",
    "this corresponds to the classical pressure drop problem with a constant gradient superimposed to sustain the flow , but as we will see this assumption is completely inessential .",
    "we have the following theorem .",
    "[ thm : smoothness ]",
    "let @xmath239 be smooth and bounded .",
    "let @xmath240 be given such that @xmath241 , and let @xmath242 .",
    "then , there exists a unique solution to   such that @xmath243 hence a unique solution to the problem   under the hagen - poiseuille ansatz .",
    "furthermore , if @xmath244 for any @xmath245 , then also @xmath246 for all @xmath247 .",
    "the lack of regularization in the ns - voigt equation is due to the special role of the inviscid regularization and it has some consequences when the voigt model is used for theoretical purposes , see for instance  @xcite .",
    "first we note that the existence and uniqueness of solution with initial datum @xmath248 and external force @xmath249 follows as in  @xcite . here",
    "we make a more explicit construction in order to highlight the regularity properties .",
    "the proof is based on an explicit analysis of the frequency budget , working with a spectral basis to construct the solution .",
    "( in the space - periodic case this can be done even more explicit with a fourier series expansion , but here we deal with the boundary value problem ) .",
    "let @xmath250 denote the eigenfunctions of the laplace operator with dirichlet conditions on @xmath218 , @xmath251 and by standard spectral theory the scalar functions @xmath250 are smooth , orthonormal with respect to the @xmath252 scalar product , and the eigenvalues @xmath253 are an increasing sequence of strictly positive terms .",
    "hence we construct the solution as @xmath254 and it is immediate to check that we have to solve the following ordinary differential equation , for all @xmath255 @xmath256 where @xmath257 and with the initial condition @xmath258 . observe that , from the regularity hypotheses on the initial datum , we have @xmath259 explicit integration of   gives @xmath260\\qquad m\\geq1.\\ ] ] it is straightforward to check that @xmath261 as @xmath262 , and from the explicit expression of the solution we can see that even if @xmath263 would be zero , then @xmath264 , for all @xmath245 , and for all @xmath265 , due to the fact that the exponential @xmath266 does not produce any smoothing ( as if @xmath267 ) , since @xmath268 the situation will be different for what concerns time regularity , since any time - differentiation will produce the zeroth order term @xmath269 which will not affect the convergence of the series describing the solution .      in this section",
    "we consider pulsatile flows , which are driven by a time - periodic force ( the pressure gradient ) .",
    "this is a remarkable case motivated also by recent studies in  @xcite for heart - beat driven , human physiological flows , including blood and cerebrospinal fluid . in the so - called ` direct problem , ' a pulsatile pressure - drop is assigned in problem  .",
    "together with this problem , in many cases of physiological interest ( when the measure of the pressure can not be done directly with sufficient accuracy by phase - contrast magnetic resonance imaging or doppler ultrasonography ) it will be also meaningful to study a problem with assigned flux : @xmath270 , for some smooth - enough given scalar function @xmath271 .",
    "the poiseuille - type _ ansatz _ will lead to the problem : given @xmath271 , find @xmath272 such that @xmath273 which is an _",
    "inverse _ problem and it is linked to one of the nowadays classical leray problems .",
    "the study of this problem when @xmath218 is a circle , @xmath233 is time - periodic , and @xmath267 dates back to richardson ( 1926 ) and sexl ( 1930 ) , while a big interest for applications to bio - fluids raised especially after the work of the physiologist j.  r.  womersley  @xcite .",
    "in particular , he quantitatively clarified why for the nse , if the pulsation is fast enough , then the qualitative behavior of solution can change drastically : instead of a parabolic type profile ( as in the stationary case ) a new phenomenon called `` _ _ annular effect _",
    "_ '' appears : if the frequency of pulsation of @xmath274 is large enough ( with respect to the other relevant parameters of the problem ) , then the maximum of the velocity is not located along the axis of the channel , but near the wall .",
    "this is particularly of interest in blood modeling , where at first approximation we have a pulsatile flow ( blood driven by heart beat ) in a straight channel ( larger arteries ) .",
    "this motivated the analysis of womersley , who explained by analytical formul  the experimental observation that in larger arteries of the rabbit and the dog there is also a reversal of the flow .",
    "this suggests that pulsatile flows , even in the linear range , can be different and much more complicated than the steady ones .",
    "the analysis of womersley was based on a single mode pressure - drop @xmath275 and a circular cross - section @xmath276 . in cylindrical coordinates",
    "@xmath277 and after the separation of variables @xmath278 , the system   becomes : find @xmath279 such that @xmath280 the above equation for a cylindrical symmetric solution can be solved by means of an expression involving the zeroth order bessel function @xmath281 .",
    "the most widely known contribution of womersley is that of determining the non - dimensional quantity ( named later womersley number ) @xmath282 which determines the qualitative behavior of solutions , where @xmath283 is the radius of the channel , @xmath284 the frequency of the pressure drop , and @xmath285 the kinematic viscosity .",
    "the womersley number is the ratio of the transient or oscillatory inertia force to the shear force .",
    "when @xmath286 , the frequency of pulsations is sufficiently low that a parabolic velocity profile has time to develop during each cycle , and the flow will be very nearly in phase with the pressure gradient . in this case using instantaneous pressure to modulate a parabolic profile will give a reasonable solution .",
    "when @xmath287 the frequency of pulsations is sufficiently large that the velocity profile is relatively flat or plug - like , and the mean flow lags the pressure gradient by about 90 degrees .",
    "in addition to this peculiar effect , the womersley solution has become a paradigm in the analysis of biological fluids ( see fung  @xcite and quarteroni and formaggia  @xcite ) for its simplicity , being one of the very few exact unsteady solutions to the nse , to debug complicated cfd flow , and also to provide an improved source of initial / boundary data , as well as a benchmark solution for pulsatile flows .",
    "we now perform an analysis of the ns - voigt equations for this problem .",
    "assume that @xmath288 , and by the ansatz @xmath289 in the case of   we arrive at the following boundary value problem for a single ode : find @xmath279 such that @xmath290      -\\nu\\big(w''(r)+\\frac{w(r)}{r}\\big)&=1\\qquad\\text{for } 0<r < r ,       \\\\      w'(0)=w(r)&=0 .",
    "\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the above equation can be exactly solved by means of an expression involving the zeroth order bessel function @xmath281 . by explicit calculations ,",
    "we get @xmath291 which reduces to the classical solution obtained by womersley in the case @xmath267 .",
    "hence , we get that the natural non - dimensional quantity is the following ( which we call @xmath19-womersley number ) @xmath292{\\alpha^{4}\\omega^{2}+\\nu^{2}}}.\\ ] ] the @xmath19-womersley number is always smaller than the womersley number of the flow with the same viscosity , radius of the pipe , and frequency .",
    "in fact @xmath293{1+\\frac{\\alpha^{4}\\omega^{2}}{\\nu^{2}}},\\ ] ] and the difference can be significant if @xmath19 is not properly chosen .",
    "this gives the hint that a not finely tuned choice of @xmath19 can completely change the behavior of solutions , since the flow can pass from one regime to another , if @xmath294 is large and @xmath19 is not small enough .",
    "here , we want to give a more explicit and real solution by considering the 2d case , that is , the cross section @xmath218 is the 1d interval @xmath295-r , r[$ ] , and showing the effect of a pulsatile force @xmath296 , which is not a peculiar effect of the space dimension . in particular",
    ", we will see that the qualitative behavior is not better in a 2d pipe , with respect to the 3d one .",
    "we consider then the following toy problem @xmath297-r , r [ , \\ ; t\\in{\\mathbb{r}}^+ ,      \\\\",
    "w(t , x)=0&\\qquad x=\\pm r,\\ ; t\\in{\\mathbb{r}}^+ ,    \\end{cases}\\ ] ] which corresponds to the pulsatile flow in a rectangular 2d channel . in this case",
    "the exact solution ( which is real as can be checked by direct inspection ) has the following explicit expression : @xmath298 if we set , in the case @xmath267 ( i.e. the nse ) , @xmath299 , @xmath300 , and @xmath301 , we find wo=12 , and the solution at @xmath302 shows the annular effect and reversal of the flow at distance about @xmath303 , as shown in figure  [ wo12 ] .",

    "moreover , in les , @xmath19 has the role of the smallest resolved length scale , and when looking at the system in this sense , the limitations for this model are those of a good resolution of the flow , otherwise transient features are lost .",
    "this could be used to speculate that the space filter alone can not be very good when studying time - evolution problems with transient or periodic effects , or at the very least the smallest resolved length scale should not be constant across the domain .",
    "this idea is mentioned in  @xcite , and indeed better results for turbulent channel flow were found when @xmath19 was chosen of the order of the local mesh width , which was much finer in the boundary layer .",
    "we have presented a detailed mathematical analysis of several important aspects of the radm . in particular",
    ", we presented a detailed analysis of the model s treatment of energy , which showed that deconvolution acts to drain energy from the system , and likewise affects the energy spectrum .",
    "we derived a scaling for energy in its fourier modes , which shows that increasing deconvolution in the model shortens the inertial range , and that the inertial range is split into two parts : the larger scales of the inertial range have a @xmath144 scaling with energy , while the lower numbers have a faster @xmath145 scaling .",
    "interestingly , this is the same spectral scaling as both the leray-@xmath19 and simplified bardina models .",
    "we presented energy spectra from computations of forced , isotropic , homogeneous turbulence with varying @xmath14 and @xmath19 , which verified the predicted scalings , and showed good agreement on large scales with dns of the nse .",
    "in addition to the radm energy study , we also proved existence of smooth global attractors , and provided an analytical study of pulsatile flows that shows small @xmath19 may be requested to study certain flows .",
    "there are several important directions for future work with the radm .",
    "first and foremost , more benchmark testing needs done . in particular , since the model performed well with @xmath16 turbulent channel flow , future testing on the benchmarks of @xmath313=395 and 590 are natural next steps .",
