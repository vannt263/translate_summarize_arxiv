    "the hkaf with the nearest neighbor interaction has been actively studied theoretically .",
    "it was predicted that for classical and large spins , thermal and quantum fluctuations stabilize the @xmath13 structure without the help of the nnn interaction @xcite , whereas for small spin values as @xmath4 or 1 , strong quantum fluctuation leads to the disordered ground state @xcite .",

    "there exists a mirror plane that passes the middle points of neighboring two cu@xmath3 ions and is perpendicular to the line connecting these two ions .",
    "therefore , the @xmath28 vector should be parallel to the mirror plane @xcite . because there are two fold screw axes along the @xmath79 , [ 0 , 1 , 0]$ ] and @xmath80 $ ] directions , the @xmath28 vectors change their directions alternately along these directions .",
    "thus , the configuration of the @xmath28 vector should be as shown in fig.[fig : dm ] . two symbols @xmath81 and @xmath82 in fig.[fig : dm](a ) and arrows in fig.[fig : dm](b ) denote the local positive directions of parallel and perpendicular components @xmath83 and @xmath84 , respectively .",
    "there is no a priori relation between @xmath83 and @xmath84 . the configuration of the @xmath28 vector shown in fig.[fig : dm ] is just the same as that discussed by elhajal _",
    "et al._@xcite .",
    "the parallel component @xmath83 acts as the easy - plane anisotropy that confines spins in the kagom layer and stabilizes the @xmath12 spin structure .",
    "the large arrows in fig.[fig : dm](a ) represent the @xmath12 spin structure that is stable for @xmath85 . because the @xmath41 plane components of spins form the 120@xmath42 structure , the parallel component @xmath83 does not give rise to the weak moment parallel to the kagom layer .",
    "the perpendicular component @xmath84 leads to the canting of spins from the kagom layer @xcite .",
    "the canting angle @xmath86 is given by @xmath87 this spin canting produces the weak ferromagnetic moment of @xmath88 perpendicular to the kagom layer .",
    "if the weak moments of neighboring layers do not cancel out , then weak net moment emerges along the @xmath41 axis .",
    "although the details of the crystal structure below @xmath68 is unclear at present , it is considered that the configuration of the @xmath78 vector in the low - temperature crystal structure is close to that in the high - temperature crystal structure .",
    "therefore , the weak ferromagnetic moment parallel to the @xmath41 axis observed in the ordered states of cs@xmath0cu@xmath1zrf@xmath2 and cs@xmath0cu@xmath1hff@xmath2 can be attributed to the perpendicular component of the @xmath78 vector ( @xmath84 ) for the dm interaction . in cs@xmath0cu@xmath1snf@xmath2 , no weak moment was observed for @xmath56 .",
    "this should be because the weak moments of neighboring layers cancel out .",
    "sharp cusp anomaly at @xmath53 as shown in the inset of fig.[fig : sus1](c ) is often observed in jarosites @xcite and in the system where the weak moments cancel out @xcite .    as the second origin of the weak moment , we consider the orthorhombic distortion of the kagom lattice , as discussed by wang _",
    "this lattice distortion leads to two types of exchange interaction @xmath89 and @xmath90 , as shown in fig.[fig : ortho ] .",
    "if the 3d ordering occurs , the @xmath11 structure is modified to be isosceles .",
    "the angle @xmath91 between the @xmath41 plane component of @xmath92 and that of @xmath93 or @xmath94 is given by @xmath95 thus , when the @xmath12 spin structure is realized , the weak moment of @xmath96 is produced parallel to the kagom layer .",
    "note that in the triangular lattice , the orthorhombic distortion of the lattice leads to the incommensurate helical spin structure @xcite , which is not accompanied by the weak moment .",

    "elongated axes of cuf@xmath22 octahedra incline alternately in the kagom layer , as shown in fig.[fig : structure1](b ) .",
    "this leads to the staggered inclination of the principal axes of the @xmath107 tensor . when an external field is applied , the staggered component of the @xmath107 tensor produces the staggered field perpendicular to the external field @xcite .",
    "the zeeman interaction due to the staggered field and the dm interaction can have finite matrix elements between the singlet ground state and the excited triplet state , because they are antisymmetric with respect to the interchange of the interacting spins .",

    ". the magnitudes of the gap evaluated from the critical field and the low - temperature susceptibility coincide .",
    "it should be noted that @xmath168 observed in rb@xmath0cu@xmath1snf@xmath2 and the triplet gap of @xmath169 predicted for the @xmath4 uniform hkaf@xcite are of the same order of magnitude .",
    "it is evident from the present measurements that the ground state of rb@xmath0cu@xmath1snf@xmath2 is a spin singlet with a triplet gap , while cs@xmath0cu@xmath1snf@xmath2 has an ordered ground state .",
    "then , we discuss the cause of the different ground states in these systems . although the crystal lattice of cs@xmath0cu@xmath1snf@xmath2 is enlarged to @xmath5 below the structural phase transition at @xmath170 k , the deviation of the magnetic susceptibility from the theoretical susceptibility for the uniform hkaf is small down to 30 k. this implies that the dispersion of the exchange constant ( @xmath171 ) in cs@xmath0cu@xmath1snf@xmath2 is smaller than that in rb@xmath0cu@xmath1snf@xmath2 .",
    "the triplet gap produced in a kagom layer decreases with decreasing dispersion of the exchange constant .",
    "conversely , the gap increases with increasing degree of dimerization .",
    "therefore , the gap produced in a kagom layer should be smaller in cs@xmath0cu@xmath1snf@xmath2 than in rb@xmath0cu@xmath1snf@xmath2 , and the gap in cs@xmath0cu@xmath1snf@xmath2 collapses more easily when weak interlayer interaction operates . because the distances between kagom layers in cs@xmath0cu@xmath1snf@xmath2 and rb@xmath0cu@xmath1snf@xmath2 are almost the same , the interlayer exchange interactions in both systems are of the same order of magnitude .",
    "we infer that the difference between the gaps produced by the exchange interactions in the kagom layers of both systems is an important factor of the different ground states .",
    "recently , cpas _",
    "et al._@xcite have discussed the effect of the dm interaction on the ground state of @xmath4 hkaf .",
    "the configuration of the @xmath78 vectors that they assumed is the same as that shown in fig.[fig : dm ] . using exact diagonalization and finite - size scaling",
    ", they argued that with increasing parallel component @xmath83 , a quantum phase transition from a gapped state to an ordered state occurs , and that the quantum critical point is given by @xmath172 . in the present systems , the magnitude of the @xmath78 vector",
    "is roughly estimated to be @xmath173 @xcite with @xmath174 . because esr spectrum was not observed because of the extremely large linewidth produced by the large dm interaction @xcite , the ratio of @xmath83 to @xmath84 is unclear .",
    "however , it is probable that @xmath83 exceeds @xmath175 , so that the ground state is gapless for triplet excitations . in this case , 3d ordering occurs at finite temperature with the help of interlayer interactions , as observed in cs@xmath0cu@xmath1snf@xmath2 .",
    "we infer that the difference in magnitude of the parallel component of the @xmath78 vector is the second factor leading to the different ground state between cs@xmath0cu@xmath1snf@xmath2 and rb@xmath0cu@xmath1snf@xmath2 .",
    "we have presented the results of magnetic susceptibility measurements on the single crystals of cs@xmath0cu@xmath1mf@xmath2 ( m = zr , hf and sn ) , which are described as @xmath4 hkaf . in these systems ,",
    "structural phase transitions were observed at @xmath6 k , 172 k and 185 k for m = zr , hf and sn , respectively .",
    "the magnetic susceptibilities observed for @xmath7 are almost perfectly described using theoretical susceptibilities obtained by exact diagonalization for the 24-site kagom cluster with the exchange parameters and the @xmath59 factors shown in table[table : tt ] . for cs@xmath0cu@xmath1snf@xmath2 ,",
    "the agreement between theoretical and experimental susceptibilities is fairly good even below @xmath68 .",
    "the magnetic susceptibility exhibits a rounded maximum at @xmath54 k , which coincides with the theoretical result @xmath16 .",
    "magnetic ordering accompanied by the weak ferromagnetic moment occurs at @xmath9 k , 24.5 k and 20.0 k for m = zr , hf and sn , respectively .",
    "the origins of the weak ferromagnetic moment should be ascribed to the lattice distortion that breaks the hexagonal symmetry of the exchange network for @xmath10 and the dm interaction .",
    "we have also presented the results of magnetic measurements on rb@xmath0cu@xmath1snf@xmath2 , which is described as a modified kagom antiferromagnet with four types of exchange interaction .",
    "the results of magnetic susceptibility and high - field magnetization measurements revealed that the ground state is a spin singlet with a triplet gap . using exact diagonalization for a 12-site kagom cluster",
    ", we analyzed the magnetic susceptibility and evaluated individual exchange interactions .",
    "we have discussed the causes leading to the different ground states in cs@xmath0cu@xmath1snf@xmath2 and rb@xmath0cu@xmath1snf@xmath2 .",
    "we infer that the difference in the dispersion of the exchange constant in the kagom layer and/or in the magnitude of the parallel component of the @xmath78 vector causes the different ground states in these two systems .",
