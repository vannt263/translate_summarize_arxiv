    "trajectories of light can be controlled by prisms or a combination of mirrors , as well as by controlling the refractive index(ri ) of a lens , such as grin(gradient index ) lenses like the eaton lens , luneburg lens , and maxwell s fish - eye lens , etc.@xcite it was once thought that the control of light trajectories was unrealistic or very difficult to realize , but recent developments of transformation optics and high ri materials from metamaterial techniques have provided novel methods for controlling wave trajectories .    the eaton lens is a typical grin lens in which the ri varies from one to infinity .",
    "it has a singularity in that the ri goes to infinity at the center of the lens and it originates from a peculiar dielectric .",
    "the speed of light is reduced to zero at this point , and the lens can therefore , change the wave trajectories any direction .",
    "the eaton lens was recently studied at three specific refraction angles : @xmath0(right - bender ) , @xmath1(retroreflector ) , and @xmath2(time - delayer).@xcite the ri of the eaton lens is given as a function of the radius , but it is not analytic except for at a few specific angles . generally , the ri and its trajectories can only be obtained by numerical calculations .",
    "a simple but good approximation of the general form will be helpful for the design and application of eaton lenses .",
    "the ri of the eaton lens is extended to arbitrary refraction angles . by combining a few eaton lenses",
    ", we can construct an optical triangle , square , hexagon , or any geometric shaped path without mirrors .",
    "an extremely simple form of the ri is suggested within a reliable error range for easy and practical use by utilizing a linear approximation of the retroreflector .",
    "hendi et al.@xcite performed studies of light trajectories at central potentials . based on the fact that the trajectory of the eaton lens is an analogue of kepler s scattering problem ( _  scattering tomography \" _ ) , they derived the relation between the light trajectory and its ri at any impact parameter . for symmetric and spherical lenses ,",

    "ri is identical to particle trajectories of equal total energy @xmath11 in a central potential @xmath12 .",
    "the potential of the eaton lens corresponds to the gravitation - like @xmath13.@xcite on the other hand the potential of the luneburg lens corresponds to the harmonic - like @xmath14.@xcite from the conservation of mechanical energy inside and outside the lens , the kinetic energy of a particle in the medium of ri @xmath6 is written as @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the mass and @xmath17 is the velocity of the particle inside the lens .",
    "then , @xmath18 or @xmath19 should be stationary bases on fermat s principle .",
    "replacing @xmath20 into @xmath21 of hannay and haeusser s equation@xcite ( see reference for the detailed derivation ) , we obtain a generalized form of the ri of the eaton lens for arbitrary refraction angles as @xmath22 where @xmath21 is any radian angle and @xmath4 for @xmath5 .",
