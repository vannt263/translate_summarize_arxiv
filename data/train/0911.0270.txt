    "several decades ago , the original works of bekenstein and hawking showed that the black hole is indeed a thermodynamics system @xcite .",
    "it was also found that the black hole satisfies four laws of the elementary thermodynamics with regarding the surface gravity and the outer horizon area as its temperature and entropy , respectively @xcite .",
    "although , it is widely believed that a black hole is a thermodynamic system , the statistical origin of the black hole entropy is still one of the most fascinating and controversial subjects today .",
    "the investigation of thermodynamic properties of black holes is also a fascinating subject .",
    "much of work had been carried out on the stability and phase transitions of black holes .",
    "it is generally thought that the local stability of a black hole is mainly determined by its heat capacity .",
    "negative heat capacity usually gives a thermodynamically unstable system and the positive one implies a local stable one .",
    "the points , where the heat capacity diverges , are usually consistent with the davies points , where the second - order phase transition takes place @xcite .    the properties of a thermodynamic system",
    "can also be studied with the ideas of geometry .",
    "weinhold @xcite firstly introduced the geometrical concept into the thermodynamics .",
    "he suggested that a riemannian metric can be defined as the second derivatives of internal energy @xmath3 with respect to the entropy and other extensive quantities of a thermodynamic system .",
    "however , it seems that the weinhold geometry has not much physical meanings .",
    "few years later , ruppeiner @xcite introduced another metric , which is analogous to the weinhold one .",
    "the thermodynamic potential of the ruppeiner geometry is the entropy @xmath4 of the thermodynamic system rather than the internal energy @xmath3 .",
    "in fact , the two metrics are conformally related to each other @xmath5 with the temperature @xmath6 as the conformal factor .",
    "the ruppeiner geometry had been used to study the ideal gas and the van der waals gas .",
    "it was shown that the curvature vanishes for the ideal gas whereas , for the van der waals gas , the curvature is non - zero and diverges only at those points , the phase transitions take place(for details see the review paper @xcite ) .",
    "the black hole , as a thermodynamics system , has been extensively investigated .",
    "the weinhold geometry and the ruppeiner geometry were obtained for various black holes and black branes @xcite . in particular",
    ", it was found that the ruppeiner geometry carries the information of phase structure of a thermodynamic system . in general , its curvature is singular at the points , where the phase transition takes place .",
    "however , for the rotating banados - teitelboim - zanelli ( btz ) and reissner - nordstr@xmath7 m ( rn ) black holes , the cases are quite different .",
    "the ruppeiner geometry gives a vanished curvature , which means there exists no thermodynamic interactions and no phase transition points .",
    "but the two kinds of black hole do exist the phase transition points .",
    "for this contradiction , many researches has been carried out to explain it .",
    "the main focus is on the thermodynamic potential , which is generally believed to be the internal energy @xmath3 rather than the mass @xmath8 for simple . for the reissner - nordstr@xmath7 m black hole",
    ", it was argued in @xcite that , the thermodynamic curvature should be reproduced from the kerr - newmann anti - de sitter black hole with the angular momentum @xmath9 and cosmological constant @xmath10 .",
    "another explanation of the contradiction was presented by queved et .",
    "few years ago @xcite .",
    "they pointed out that the origin of the contradiction is that the weinhold metric and ruppeiner metric are not legendre invariant .",
    "a legendre invariant metric was introduced by them , which could reproduce correctly the behavior of the thermodynamic interactions and phase transitions for the btz and rn black holes @xcite and other black hole configurations and models @xcite .",
    "another interesting and important question of this field is how the geometry behaves when including the corrected term of the entropy .",
    "it is generally believed that , for a canonical ensemble , there exists a logarithmic corrected term to the entropy @xcite .",
    "considering the correction term , the geometry structure was studied in @xcite for the btz black hole .",
    "especially , its ruppeiner curvature will become non - zero when the logarithmic correction is included .",
    "the aim of this paper is to study the phase transitions and geometry structure of the plane symmetry black hole .",
    "firstly , we study the thermodynamic stability of the plane symmetric black hole .",
    "it is shown that there always exist locally thermodynamically stable phases and unstable phases for the plane symmetric black hole due to suitable parameter regimes .",
    "then , three different geometry structures are obtained .",
    "the weinhold curvature gives phase transition points , which correspond to that of the first - order phase transition only at @xmath0 . while the ruppeiner one shows first - order phase transition points for arbitrary @xmath2 .",
    "both of which give no any information about the second - order phase transition .",
    "considering the legendre invariant , we obtain a unified geometry metric , which gives a correct behavior of the thermodynamic interactions and phase transitions .",
    "it is found that the curvature constructed from the unified metric goes to negative infinity at the davies points , where the second - order phase transition takes place .",
    "the geometry structure is also studied as the logarithmic correction is included .",
    "the result shows that the logarithmic correction term has no affect on the unified geometry depicts the phase transitions of the plane symmetric black hole .",
    "we also show that the absolute values of the charge @xmath11 at the divergence points of the curvature @xmath12 will decrease with the increase of the entropy corrected parameter @xmath13 for large @xmath4 .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ thermodynamic ] , we first review some thermodynamic quantities of the plane symmetric black hole . the thermodynamic stability is also studied . in sec .",
    "[ geometry ] , both the weinhold and ruppeiner geometry structures are obtained .",
    "however , they fail to give the information about the second - order phase transition points . for the reason",
    ", we give a detail analysis and obtain a new legendre invariant metric structure which could give a well description of the thermodynamic interactions and phase transitions in sec .",
    "[ geometrothermodynamics ] . including the logarithmic corrected term , the geometry structure",
    "is considered in sec .",
    "[ fluctuations ] .",
    "finally , the paper ends with a brief conclusion .",
    "in this section , we will present the thermodynamic quantities and other properties of the plane symmetric black hole .",
    "the thermodynamic stability of it is also discussed .",
    "the action depicting the plane symmetric black hole is given by @xmath14 where @xmath15 is a dilaton field and @xmath16 , @xmath17 are constants .",
    "the negative cosmological constant @xmath18 .",
    "static plane symmetric black hole solutions in this theory were first given in @xcite ( some detail works for this black hole can also be found in @xcite ) @xmath19 the metric functions are given by , respectively , @xmath20 where @xmath21 .",
    "the parameters @xmath8 and @xmath11 are the mass and charge of the black hole . the event horizon is located at @xmath22 and the radius @xmath23 satisfies @xmath24 in general , there exist two event horizons , the inner event horizon and the outer event horizon . under the extreme case , the two horizon will merge into each other . here , we have denoted @xmath23 as the radius of outer event horizon .",
    "the surface area of the event horizon corresponds to unit @xmath25 plane @xcite @xmath26 from eq .",
    "( [ event ] ) , the mass can be expressed in the form @xmath27 with the relation between area and entropy , i.e. @xmath28 , we can obtain @xmath29 substituting eq .",
    "( [ radius ] ) into ( [ mass ] ) , the mass can be obtained as a function of entropy @xmath4 and charge @xmath11 in the form @xmath30 from the energy conservation law of the black hole @xmath31 the relevant thermodynamic variables , the temperature and electric potential are obtained @xmath32 for a given charge @xmath11 , the heat capacity has the expression @xmath33 with the zero - points and singular points @xmath34 respectively .",
    "the heat capacity @xmath35 vanishes at @xmath36 , which is considered to be the first - order phase transition points .",
    "it is generally believed that the davies points where the second - order phase transition takes place correspond to the diverge points of heat capacity .",
    "so the heat capacity ( [ 2heatcapacity ] ) may indicate that the second - order phase transition takes place at @xmath37 .",
    "the heat capacity also contains the information of the local stability of the black hole thermodynamics .",
    "the negative heat capacity always implies an unstable thermodynamics system and the positive one shows a stable system . here , we would like to give a brief discussion about the local stability of the plane symmetric black hole . for @xmath38 ,",
    "the numerator of the heat capacity ( [ 2heatcapacity ] ) is negative , while the denominator is positive , which gives a negative heat capacity . for @xmath39 ,",
    "the numerator is positive , but the denominator turns to negative , which also shows a negative heat capacity .",
    "so , in both cases , the heat capacity @xmath35 implies an unstable black hole thermodynamics .",
    "when @xmath40 , both the numerator and denominator are positive , which implies a stable black hole thermodynamics . the behavior of the heat capacity @xmath35 can be directly found from fig .",
    "[ figcapacity ] . for larger and smaller values of @xmath41 , the heat capacity",
    "@xmath35 is negative . while in the middle zone",
    ", it is positive . in summary ,",
    "we have found that there always exist locally thermodynamically stable phases and unstable phases for the plane symmetric black hole due to suitable parameter regimes .",
    "in this section , we would like to study the weinhold geometry and ruppeiner geometry of the plane symmetric black hole . in the first step",
    ", we will show the weinhold geometry .",
    "then , using the conformal relation , we could obtain the ruppeiner geometry .",
    "the weinhold geometry is charactered by the metric @xmath42 where the index @xmath43 denotes the weinhold geometry . here",
    ", we have made the choice that the mass @xmath8 corresponds to the thermodynamic potential and with the extensive variables entropy @xmath4 and charge @xmath11 .    using eq .",
    "( [ lastmass ] ) , the weinhold metric can be obtained in the form @xmath44 its determinant is @xmath45}{2^{3+\\frac{2}{n}}s^{2+\\frac{1}{n}}\\pi^{2}n^{2}}$ ] .",
    "it can be seen that the determinant disappears as the heat capacity vanishes only at @xmath0 .",
    "a simple calculation shows that the christoffel symbols are @xmath46 }                           { 4ns\\big[12\\alpha^{2}s-(2n-1)q^{2}\\big]},\\quad   \\gamma^{s}_{qs}=\\gamma^{s}_{sq}=-\\frac{2nq}{12\\alpha^{2}s-(2n-1)q^{2}},\\nonumber\\\\   \\gamma^{s}_{qq}&=&-\\frac{2ns}{12\\alpha^{2}s-(2n-1)q^{2}},\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad   \\gamma^{q}_{ss}=-\\frac{(2n+1)q^{3}}{4ns^{2}\\big[12\\alpha^{2}s-(2n-1)q^{2}\\big]},\\quad\\\\   \\gamma^{q}_{sq}&=&\\gamma^{q}_{qs }         = -\\frac{12\\alpha^{2}s+(2n+1)q^{2}}{4s\\big[12n\\alpha^{2}s - n(2n-1)q^{2}\\big]},\\quad   \\gamma^{q}_{qq}=\\frac{q}{12\\alpha^{2}s-(2n-1)q^{2}},\\quad \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the christoffel symbols is calculated with @xmath47 the riemannian curvature tensor , ricc curvature and scalar curvature are given , respectively @xmath48 with eq .",

    "its behavior can be seen in fig .",

    "the vanished thermodynamic curvature @xmath53 implies that there exists no phase transition points and no thermodynamic interactions appear .",
    "so , the ruppeiner curvature is not proper to describe the phase transitions of the plane symmetric black hole at @xmath0 .",
    "the divergence of the ruppeiner curvature is at @xmath54 and @xmath36 , which can be seen from the fig .",
    "( [ ruppeiner ] ) .",
    "the points @xmath36 consist with the zero - points ( [ zeropoint ] ) of heat capacity @xmath35 .",
    "this means that the ruppeiner curvature always implies the first - order phase transition points . like the weinhold curvature",
    ", the ruppeiner curvature also implies no any information about the second - order phase transition .",
    "in the previous section , we show that the weinhold curvature implies the first - order phase transition points only at @xmath0 , while the ruppeiner curvature implies the first - order phase transition points expect @xmath0 . both of the geometry structures fail to give the second - order phase transition points of the plane symmetric black hole .",
    "quevedo et .",
    "al . pointed out the failure of the two geometries to describe the second - order phase transition points is that they are not legendre invariant , which makes them inappropriate to describe the geometry of thermodynamic systems @xcite .",
    "considering the legendre invariant , a unified geometry was presented in @xcite , where the metric structure can give a well description of various types of black hole thermodynamics .",
