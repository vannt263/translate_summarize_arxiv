    "the study of the coexistence of superconductivity and magnetic ordering in the ruthenocuprate rusr@xmath2gdcu@xmath2o@xmath3 ( ru-1212 ) has attracted great interest since the original study of bauernfeind _",
    "et al._.@xcite the ru-1212 is a 1212-type layered cuprate structurally similar to the yba@xmath2cu@xmath10o@xmath11(ybco ) , where y and ba are replaced by gd ( or eu ) and sr , respectively , and the cu - o chains replaced by ruo@xmath2 layers.@xcite in these materials the magnetic long - range ordering of the ru sub - lattice occurs below a transition temperature _ t@xmath12 _ @xmath13 130 k while the superconductivity arising from the cuo@xmath2 layers occurs below a critical temperature _",
    "t@xmath14 _ @xmath13 40 k. recent studies have indicated that the magnetic ordering and the superconducting state are essentially decoupled , being related only by the charge transfer between ru and cuo planes.@xcite in addition to this , there is no clear evidence about the exact nature of the magnetic structure of these materials up to now but it is accepted that , for low magnetic fields , there is an antiferromagnetic ( afi ) order , whereas for high magnetic fields ( @xmath15 @xmath16 2 t ) a spin - flop transition is observed,@xcite with ru magnetic order essentially ferromagnetic ( fm ) .",
    "also , from experimental data and theoretical analysis , it was proposed that for temperatures lower than _ t@xmath14 _ , the magnetic - flux lines are present even without an external magnetic field , suggesting the creation of a spontaneous vortex phase ( svp).@xcite    in fact , the genuine coexistence of superconductivity and magnetism at microscopic level is still controversial .",
    "some experimental studies@xcite have shown that the ruthenocuprates are microscopically uniform .",
    "on the other hand , several experimental results have indicated a possible phase - separation of superconducting ( sc ) and magnetic regions.@xcite for instance , high - resolution transmission electron microscopy ( hrtem ) and synchrotron x - ray diffraction analysis have suggested a phase separation in ru-1212 compounds.@xcite it was argued that such a phase separation arises from the rotation of the ruo@xmath17 octahedra around the @xmath18-axis , resulting in the formation of small domains with characteristic lenghts @xmath4 200  separated by sharp antiphase boundaries of reversed rotations.@xcite also , a phase separation between fm and afm nanodomains inside physical grains of ru-1212 has been proposed from a detailed analysis of magnetization data.@xcite the authors have concluded that intragrain properties of the ruthenocuprates exhibit features of granular superconductors and a josephson - junction - array ( jja ) model was invoked to account for the intrinsic inhomogeneities of intragrain superconductivity.@xcite therefore , a discussion of whether both superconducting and magnetic phases originate from the same crystallographic structure , and features of this intimate coexistence on a microscopic scale are relevant questions for the understanding of these materials .    considering that the coupling allowing for the coexistence of superconductivity and ferromagnetism in ru-1212 compounds is very weak and strongly affected by chemical substitutions ,",
    "the dilution of the magnetic ru sublattice by different ions is an interesting approach to probe the coexistent phenomena .",
    "the partial substitution of ru by sn@xmath19 was found to suppress the fm moment of the sublattice and to increase the onset of the sc transition .",
    "these features would reflect an increase in the transfer rate of holes to the cuo@xmath2 planes.@xcite studies regarding substitution of ru by both ti and rh revealed that both fm and sc transition temperatures are reduced upon increasing dopant concentration.@xcite the substitution of ru by nb@xmath20 results in a decrease of the magnetic ordering temperature and an increase in the ru valence,@xcite whereas for ta - substituted specimens an apparent suppression of the superconductivity of ru-1212 has been observed.@xcite in general , both magnetic and superconducting properties of the ruthenocuprates are affected by the ionic radius , valence , and magnetic character of the substituting ion .",
    "however , changes observed in alloying ru-1212 compounds are usually accompanied by significant structural distortions due to differences in ionic radii . within this scenario",
    "it is a difficult task to distinguish between changes arising from properties of the substituted ion and those from crystallographic distortions .    in the present work we have investigated the crystallographic , transport , and magneto - transport properties of ru@xmath0ir@xmath1sr@xmath2gd@xmath21cu@xmath2o@xmath3 compound in order to study the relationship between superconductivity and magnetism .",

    "the main results indicate that ir substitutes ru ions with no significant structural distortions due to similar ionic radii .",
    "the substituted ir dilutes the ru magnetic sub - lattice , decreasing both the magnetic ordering and the superconducting transition temperatures .",
    "the magnetoresistivity data revealed that all samples are superconducting up to 18 t at temperatures higher than 2 k. on the other hand the diamagnetic signal in the magnetization curves is absent for low applied magnetic field .",
    "the combined results indicate that the ruthenocuprates have similar anisotropic properties as observed in bismuth based high - temperature superconductors .",
    "in addition , the ir substitutions and the effect of the applied magnetic field on the electrical resistance curves suggest that the granular behavior observed may be related to phase separation of ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic mesoscopic regions .",
