    "the search for higgs bosons is one of the main goals of the cern large hadron collider ( lhc ) , with @xmath6tev and a luminosity of 100 fb@xmath7 per year @xcite . in the standard model ( sm ) ,",
    "the higgs boson mass is basically a free parameter with an upper bound of @xmath8gev @xcite .",
    "however , present data from precision measurements of electroweak quantities indicate the existence of a light higgs boson(@xmath9 gev at @xmath10 c.l . ) and direct searches rule out the case @xmath11gev @xcite . in addition , in various extensions of the sm , for example , in the two - higgs - doublet models ( thdm ) @xcite , particularly in the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) @xcite , there are five physical higgs particles : two neutral cp - even bosons @xmath0 and @xmath1 , one neutral cp - odd boson @xmath12 , and two charged bosons @xmath13",
    ". the higgs boson @xmath0 should be lightest , with a mass @xmath14gev when including the radiative corrections @xcite .",
    "it has been shown @xcite that the @xmath0 boson can not escape detection at the lhc and that in large areas of the parameter space , more than one higgs particle can be found .    at the lhc",
    ", the neutral higgs bosons can be produced through following mechanisms : gluon fusion @xmath15 @xcite , weak boson fusion @xmath16 @xcite , associated production with weak bosons @xcite , associated production with a heavy quark - antiquark pair @xmath17 @xcite and pair production @xcite . in this paper",
    "we focus our attentions on the production of @xmath18 in association with @xmath2 boson in the mssm .",
    "this is one of the main discovery channels of neutral higgs bosons at the tevatron , with the higgs decays to @xmath3 and @xmath2 decays leptonicly .",
    "the main backgrounds to this signal are @xmath19 production , @xmath20 production and top quark production @xcite . at the lhc , it can be used to detect the `` invisible '' higgs which decays into the lsps . the detailed analysis of signals and backgrounds can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite , where they found the ratio of signal to background can as large as 12 . in the sm , the drell - yan production process ( light @xmath21 annihilation ) of higgs associated with @xmath2 boson @xcite , as well as",
    "the gluon fusion process @xcite , has been studied previously . in the mssm ,",
    "the drell - yan contributions are related to the ones in the sm by an overall coefficient , but the contributions of gluon fusion are generally different in the two models due to the different couplings and additional contributions from new channels . meanwhile , there are potentially important contributions to the production of neutral higgs bosons from @xmath22 annihilation at the tree - level . in the mssm , the yukawa couplings @xmath23@xmath23@xmath24 can enhance higgs boson production cross section via @xmath22 annihilation significantly for large @xmath5 . therefore , besides the production channel via drell - yan process , in order to obtain the complete leading order ( lo ) total cross sections for the associated production of scalar higgs bosons with @xmath2 boson , the partonic subprocesses @xmath25 should also be taken into account . moreover ,",
    "the loop induced subprocess @xmath26 become important due to the potential enhancement , and should be considered , too .",
    "we will investigate all these contributions in our work .",
    "our paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : cal ] , we list analytical results for the tree level cross sections of @xmath27 and loop induced cross sections of @xmath28 in the mssm . in section",
    "[ sec : num ] , we present quantitative predictions for the inclusive cross section of @xmath29 at the lhc adopting the mssm parameters constrained within the minimal supergravity ( msugra ) scenario and discuss the implications of our results .",
    "the relevant mssm couplings and form factors are given in the appendix [ sec : cp ] and [ sec : ff ] , respectively .",
    "the relevant feynman diagrams are created by feynarts @xcite version 3.2 automatically and are shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : feyn1][fig : feyn3 ] .",
    "we carry out the calculation in the t  hooft  feynman gauge and use dimensional reduction for regularization of the ultraviolet divergences in the loop diagrams . in the following expressions , @xmath30 and @xmath31 are the couplings , which are given explicitly in appendix [ sec : cp ] ; @xmath32 stands for the scalar higgs bosons , @xmath0 or @xmath1 ; @xmath33 and @xmath34 are propagating scalar and fermion particles , respectively .    for the partonic subprocesses",
    "@xmath35 we define the mandelstam variables as @xmath36    the tree - level amplitude @xmath37 for the subprocess @xmath38 consists of the three diagrams @xmath39 in fig .",
    "[ fig : feyn1 ] .",
    "the previous results @xcite for vector boson bremsstrahlung include only the first diagram , where the @xmath3 pair replaced by light quark - antiquark pairs .",
    "we also recompute the contributions of light quarks to the tree - level cross sections and compare them with ones of @xmath38 .    using the notations defined above",
    ", the amplitude @xmath37 can be expressed as @xmath40 with @xmath41 here @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 , and @xmath45 is the decay width of @xmath12 .",
    "the gluon fusion subprocess is forbidden at tree - level . at one - loop level , in general",
    ", the cross section will receive contributions from both quark loops and squark loops , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : feyn2 ] , [ fig : feyn3 ] .",
    "note that each diagram actually represents a couple of diagrams with opposite directions of charge flow .",
    "however , we find that the contributions from each pair of squark loop diagrams to this process cancel each other due to the opposite signs of momenta .",
    "so the gluon fusion cross section arises only from the quark loop diagrams , i.e. , @xmath46 where the subscripts @xmath47 refer to the corresponding diagrams in fig .",
    "[ fig : feyn2 ] .    in general , the amplitudes @xmath48 can be written as a linear combination of the invariants formed by three independent external momenta @xmath49 , polarization vectors of three external gauge bosons @xmath50 , metric tensor @xmath51 and levi - civita tensor @xmath52 , in which the terms without levi - civita tensor vanish .",
    "thus , with taking into account the relations @xmath53 , 24 terms remain in the amplitudes .",
    "it is easy to prove the following identity @xmath54 using it , one can immediately see that not all of the 24 terms are linear independent .",
    "actually , there are only 14 independent ones , and finally the amplitudes can be written as @xmath55 the explicit expressions of the form factors @xmath56 are shown in appendix [ sec : ff ] .",
    "the differential cross sections of the subprocesses are given by @xmath57 where @xmath58 for @xmath3 channel and @xmath59 for gluon fusion .",
    "using the standard factorization procedure , the total cross section can be obtained as a convolution of partonic cross sections with corresponding parton distribution functions , @xmath60 \\hat{\\sigma}(\\alpha\\beta \\rightarrow zh),\\ ] ] where @xmath61 , @xmath62 is the center - of - mass energy of the lhc , @xmath63 and @xmath64 denote the initial partons .",
    "in the following we present some numerical results . in our numerical calculations ,",
    "the sm input parameters were taken to be @xmath65 , @xmath66gev , @xmath67gev and @xmath68gev @xcite .",
    "we use the one - loop evolution of the strong coupling constant @xmath69 @xcite with @xmath70 .",
    "the leading order cteq6 parton distribution functions @xcite are used here and the factorization scale is taken to be the invariant mass of the two final particles @xmath71 . moreover , in order to improve the perturbative calculations , we take the running mass of bottom quark @xmath72 evaluated by the one - loop formula @xmath73 with @xmath74gev . the evolution factor @xmath75 is @xmath76 with @xmath77 the relevant mssm parameters , the higgs masses and mixing angles @xmath63 , are determined in the msugra scenario as implemented in program package isajet 7.69 @xcite .",
    "the gut parameters @xmath78 , @xmath79 and @xmath80 were taken to be @xmath81  gev , @xmath82  gev , @xmath83 .",
    "@xmath84 , @xmath5 were varied to obtain various higgs masses .",
    "actually , in msugra scenario , the mass of the light scalar higgs boson @xmath0 can only reach about 125 gev , which is independent of the choice of gut parameters .",
    "it should be noted that in some parameter region , @xmath85 , and the momentum of @xmath12 can approach its mass shell , which will lead to a singularity arising from the @xmath12 propagator .",
    "this can be avoided by introduing the non - zero decay width @xmath45 , which was also calculated by isajet .",
    "[ fig : num1]@xmath86 and [ fig : num2]@xmath86 show the total cross sections for the process @xmath87 versus the light scalar higgs boson mass @xmath88 for @xmath89 and @xmath90 .",
    "[ fig : num1]@xmath91 and [ fig : num2]@xmath91 show the dependence of the cross sections on @xmath5 for @xmath92 and @xmath93  gev . from fig .",
    "[ fig : num1 ] we can see that the @xmath3 contributions are approximately one order of magnitude smaller than the ones of drell - yan process @xcite , and only increase the total cross sections by about several percents , which are smaller than the qcd corrections to the drell - yan process .",
    "[ fig : num2 ] shows the contributions of gluon fusion to the cross sections . comparing with ones of the complete @xmath21 annihilation ( i.e. drell - yan + @xmath3 )",
    ", one can see that for a light @xmath0 ( for example , @xmath92  gev ) , the contributions of gluon fusion are about half of the ones of the @xmath21 annihilation for low @xmath94 , but with the increasing of @xmath5 from 4 to 10 , the former decrease significantly , and become one order of magnitude smaller than the latter in general .",
    "therefore , in most of the parameter regions , the contributions of both @xmath3 and @xmath4 initial states are almost insignificant and can be neglected .",
    "[ fig : num3]@xmath86 and [ fig : num4]@xmath86 show the total cross sections for the process @xmath95 as a function of the heavy scalar higgs boson mass @xmath96 for the three representative values of @xmath5 . fig .",
    "[ fig : num3]@xmath91 and [ fig : num4]@xmath91 show the dependence of the cross sections on @xmath5 for @xmath97 and @xmath98  gev .",
    "we found that the @xmath3 contributions to the total cross sections for the production of heavier neutral higgs boson can be much larger than the contributions of drell - yan process for large @xmath5 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : num3 ] . for example , when @xmath99 and @xmath97  gev , the @xmath3 cross section is about @xmath100  fb , while one of drell - yan process is less than @xmath101  fb .",
    "therefore , the @xmath3 channel provides a dramatic enhancement to the total cross sections , and should definitely be considered . on the other hand , the contributions of gluon fusion are very small ( @xmath102  fb ) and can be neglected in most cases , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : num4 ] .    for the comparison of the production rates of @xmath103 , @xmath0 and @xmath1 ,",
    "they are displayed as the functions of their masses in fig .",
    "[ fig : num6 ] , where all the contributions ( i.e. drell - yan + @xmath3 + gluon fusion ) have been included for @xmath104 and 40 , respectively . for the sm higgs , as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , the gluon fusion contributions are negligible for higgs masses allowed by experiments , so we did nt include them here . from fig .",
    "[ fig : num6 ] , one can find that no matter what the value of @xmath5 is , the production rates of @xmath1 are the smallest , the ones of @xmath0 are the largest , and the ones of @xmath103 are medium .",
    "this feature indicates that the predictions for the associated production of the higgs bosons and @xmath2 boson in the sm and the mssm are different quantitatively and distinguishable , which is in agreement with the results shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , where only drell - yan contributions are included .    in conclusion",
    ", we have calculated the scalar higgs bosons ( @xmath105 ) production in association with a @xmath2 boson through both @xmath3 channel and gluon fusion in the msugra model at the lhc .",
    "our results show that in most of the parameter regions , the contributions to the total cross section for associated production of the light scalar higgs boson @xmath0 and @xmath2 boson mainly come from light quark annihilation and the contributions from initial @xmath3 and @xmath4 are small and negligible . and",
    "the total cross section for associated production of heavy scalar higgs boson @xmath1 and @xmath2 boson , with including the contributions of @xmath3 channel , can be increased greatly . especially for large @xmath5 ,",
    "such increment can reach about one order of magnitude .",
    "thus , the contributions of @xmath3 channel should definitely be taken into account , and the ratio of signal to background obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite , which is based on the previous calculations , can be enhanced at large @xmath5 .",
    "the contributions from gluon fusion are still small and unimportant .",
