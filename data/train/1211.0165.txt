    "early observations of sunspots revealed that there was an epoch from 1645 to 1715 when sunspots almost disappeared from the surface of the sun .",
    "this period is known as the .",
    "this was not an artifact of very few observations as this period was well covered by direct observations ( hoyt & schatten 1996 ) .",
    "several old archival data have shown that there was a strong north - south asymmetry during the last phase of the  because most of the sunspots appeared in the southern hemisphere of the sun ( ribes & nesme - ribes 1993 ) . from the study of cosmogenic isotopes",
    "@xmath0be and @xmath1c , it was found that the solar activity was weaker during the , but the cyclic oscillation of solar activity continued with periods longer than the usual 11 years ( miyahara _ et al . _ 2004 ) .",
    "the production of these isotopes varies with the solar cycle because the strong magnetic field of the sun during solar maximum suppresses the earth - ward incoming cosmic rays flux .",
    "the study of cosmogenic isotopes revealed that the , which has been seen in the direct observational data during the seventeenth century , was not unique ( usoskin , solanki & kovaltsov 2007 ; nagaya et al .",
    "in particular , from the study of @xmath1c data , usoskin , solanki & kovaltsov ( 2007 ) reported that there have been about 27 grand minima in the last 11,000 years and the sun spent about 17% of this time in the grand minima state .",
    "our motivation is to study the physics behind the origin of these grand minima and then to find out their frequency using a dynamo model .",
    "our calculations are based on the flux transport dynamo model , which is the most promising model at present to study the solar cycle and of which a version has been developed in our group over the years ( choudhuri , schssler & dikpati 1995 ; nandy & choudhuri 2002 ; chatterjee , nandy & choudhuri 2004 ; chatterjee & choudhuri 2006 ; goel & choudhuri 2009 ; karak & choudhuri 2012 ; karak & petrovay 2013 ; karak & nandy 2012 ) .",
    "the details of this model have been reviewed by choudhuri ( 2011 ) .",
    "basically this is a kinematic mean - field dynamo model in which the strong toroidal field is generated near the base of the convection zone by the differential rotation and the poloidal field is generated from the decay of the tilted bipolar sunspots near the solar surface (  process ) .",
    "the and the turbulent diffusivity provide the two important transport processes in this model for transporting the poloidal field from the top of the convection zone to the bottom .",
    "let us begin by looking at the possible sources of  in the  which can produce grand minima .",
    "a detailed discussion of our present understanding of the mechanisms that may cause grand minima has been reviewed by choudhuri ( 2012 ) .",
    "therefore we are not going into the same discussion again .",
    "we believe that the possible mechanisms for producing the grand minima are the following : _ i _ )  in the  ( b - l ) process that may make the  weak and _ ii _ )  in the  that may make it slow .",
    "let us look at the b - l process first . in this process",
    ", the poloidal field is generated from the decay of the tilted bipolar sunspots .",
    "this is a complex nonlinear process which depends on many factors , such as tilt angles of the bipolar sunspots .",
    "it has been found that the average tilt angle varies cycle to cycle making the different at every solar minimum from its mean value ( dasi - espuig _ et al .",
    "while the tilts of bipolar sunspots are produced by the coriolis force acting on the rising toroidal flux tubes ( dsilva & choudhuri 1993 ) , the fluctuations in the tilts presumably result from the buffeting of the flux tubes by turbulence ( longcope & choudhuri 2002 ) .",
    "these fluctuations in tilts introduce fluctuations in the b - l process that has been identified as a main source of irregularities in solar cycles ( choudhuri , chatterjee & jiang 2007 ; jiang , chatterjee & choudhuri 2007 ) .",
    "several authors ( choudhuri 1992 ; charbonneau , blais - laurier & st - jean 2004 , passos & lopes 2011 ) introduced fluctuations in the   generation process and found intermittencies resembling grand minima .",
    "we model the  with the assumption that the poloidal field before the  dropped to a very low value .",
    "all our studies are based on the  presented by chatterjee , nandy & choudhuri ( 2004 ) , with a few parameters modified by karak ( 2010 ) . to produce the , we ( choudhuri & karak 2009 ) did the following .",
    "we stop the code at a solar minimum and change the poloidal field by a factor @xmath2 .",
    "we take @xmath3 in southern hemisphere and @xmath4 in northern hemisphere . after this modification in the",
    ", we again run the model for several solar cycles .",
    "figure [ mm_pol ] shows the result of this procedure .",
    "note that for the sake of comparison with the observation data , we have marked the beginning of this figure to be the year 1640 .",
    "our results successfully reproduce the north - south asymmetry in the sunspots and the sudden initiation of  and the gradual recovery .",

    "butterfly diagram during the maunder minimum . from karak ( 2010).,width=384 ]",
    "the other important source of  in this dynamo model is the variations of the meridional circulation .",
    "there is no long - term observational data of the  in the past .",
    "therefore we do not directly know whether the  had large variations with time .",
    "however , we know that there have been variations in the periods of solar cycles . since the period of the flux transport dynamo strongly depends on the strength of the meridional circulation ( yeates , nandy & mackey 2008 ) , we believe that the variations in the periods of the past cycles imply variations in the .",
    "karak & choudhuri ( 2011 ) used this idea to get a rough idea about the variations of .",
    "they also showed that such temporal variations in the  are necessary to model the _ waldmeier effect_. to produce the , karak ( 2010 ) decreased the amplitude of  rapidly to a very low value during a cycle and then , after a few years , it was increased to the usual value . by doing this ,",
    "he is able to reproduce the  remarkably well . figure [ mm_mc ] shows this result .",
    "the physics of this result can be understood from yeates , nandy & mackey ( 2008 ) in the following way .",
    "when we decrease the  to a very low value , the solar cycle periods become longer and the  remains in the convection zone for longer time .",
    "there are two competing effects ",
    "_ i _ ) the differential rotation gets more time to induct the toroidal field which makes the toroidal field stronger and _ ii _ ) diffusion gets more time to diffuse the fields which makes the toroidal field weaker .",
    "now , in our high diffusivity model , the latter effect ( the diffusion of the fields ) is more important . a sufficiently weak  can make the toroidal field so weak that the dynamo is pushed into a grand minimum state .",
    "in the observation data of last 11,000  yrs , there were 27 grand minima with durations longer than about 20  yrs . therefore the probability that a particular solar cycle triggers a grand minimum is @xmath6 .",
    "our present motivation is to see whether the existing can give a correct value of this probability . in the previous section",
    ", we have seen that the can be reproduced either by decreasing the poloidal field to a very low value or by decreasing the meridional circulation to a very low value .",
    "however , instead of reducing either of these two quantities to a very low value , if we reduce both simultaneously , then we can reproduce the  for more moderate values of these two quantities .",
    "karak ( 2010 ) gave the required values of the strength of the  @xmath7 and the strength of the  @xmath2 which can produce a maunder - like grand minimum ( see fig .",
    "6 of karak 2010 ) . here",
    "we present a similar plot in fig .",
    "[ parameters ] .",
    "parameters lying on the solid line produce grand minima of duration about 20  yrs . if the parameters lie below the solid line , then we get grand minima of durations more than 20  yrs .",
    "the shaded region in fig .",
    "[ parameters ] should , therefore , cover all the grand minima observed in the past .",
    "now the question is how to find out the values of these @xmath7 and @xmath2 in the past .",
    "obviously there is no direct way to find out these values .",
    "we ( choudhuri & karak 2012 ) got these values in indirect ways .",
    "we find the values of @xmath7 by assuming that @xmath7 goes inversely as the solar cycle period .",
    "therefore , from the observed periods of the last 28 solar cycles , we get 28 data for the @xmath7 and construct the histogram shown in fig .",
    "[ hists](a ) .",
    "the gaussian fit to this histogram is shown by the solid line in fig .",
    "[ hists](a ) .",
    "next we find out the values of the  by assuming a perfect correlation between the peak sunspot number and the  strength of the previous cycle .",
    "therefore we again get 28 data points for @xmath2 from the peak sunspot numbers of last 28 solar cycles .",
    "the histogram is shown in fig .",
    "[ hists](b ) , with a gaussian fit .",
    "the joint probability density that @xmath7 and @xmath2 of a cycle lie in the range @xmath7 , @xmath8d@xmath7 and @xmath2 , @xmath9d@xmath2 is given by @xmath10 \\times \\frac{1}{\\sigma_{\\gamma } \\sqrt{2 \\pi } } \\exp\\left[- \\frac{(\\gamma - 1)^2}{2 \\sigma_{\\gamma}^2}\\right ] d\\gamma \\ , dv_0.\\ ] ] by integrating the above probability density over the shaded region in fig .",
    "[ parameters ] , we get the probability of a solar cycle triggering a grand minimum as @xmath11 , which is not very far from the observed value @xmath6 .     and the poloidal field scale factor @xmath2 which produce grand minima of duration @xmath12  yrs .",
    "the parameters lying in the shaded region produce grand minima of longer duration .",
    "the dashed curves are the contours of the joint probability @xmath13 , with the values of @xmath13 ( excluding the constant pre - factor ) given in the plot . from choudhuri & karak ( 2012).,width=240 ]     and ( b )",

    "to check whether the above simple argument about the occurrence probability of grand minima is borne out by detailed calculations , we ( choudhuri & karak 2012 ; karak & choudhuri 2013 ) have carried out extensive simulations with our dynamo model .",
    "we introduce stochastic fluctuations both in the poloidal field and the . to introduce fluctuations in the poloidal field",
    ", we change the  by the factor @xmath2 above @xmath15 at every solar minima ( for details see choudhuri , chatterjee & jiang 2007 ) , whereas to introduce fluctuations in the , we change @xmath7 everywhere in the model after a certain coherence time of 30  yrs .",
    "we choose the fluctuation levels of the   and the  according to their distributions shown in fig .",

    "is shown in fig .",
    "[ grand_min ] . in this particular run",
    ", we get 28 grand minima .",
    "we have carried out several simulations with different realizations of the random numbers for the  and the , finding that the numbers of grand minima in all simulations lie in the range 24 - 30 remarkably close to the observed number 27 .",
    "another important result we find is that the sun spent about 1015% of the total time in grand minima state which is close to the observed value 17% .",
    "we have also checked how the results change with the coherence time of  by performing several simulations with varying coherence time .",
    "we have seen that when we take the coherence time less than about 15  yrs , the number of  becomes considerably less .",
    "one important point to note is that the b - l process may not work during , since very few sunspots appear during those times .",
    "therefore the question remains unclear how the sun recovers from a grand minimum after entering one .",
    "we believe that the turbulent @xmath16 effect originally proposed by parker ( 1955 ) might be a good candidate for generating a weak poloidal field and this could eventually pull the sun out of the grand minimum . since the detailed nature of this @xmath16 effect is unclear , our first calculations described here use the same b - l @xmath16 all the time .",
    "however our future work ( karak & choudhuri 2013 ) explores this issue .",
    "we have explored the possible causes of the grand minima using a .",
    "we believe that the fluctuations in the  and in the  are the two important sources of randomness in this dynamo model .",
