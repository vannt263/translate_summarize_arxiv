    "many superconductors of wide interest and recent discovery , such as iron - based superconductors @xcite , mgb@xmath0 @xcite and cuprate superconductors,@xcite have in common an intrinsic material anisotropy , essentially uniaxial , arising from their crystal structure .",
    "the material anisotropy has a profound impact , among the others , on the vortex dynamics and on the related pinning phenomena .",
    "such properties have been much studied due to their importance both for unraveling the fundamental physics of the underlying superconductor and in view of technological applications . as an example , recently a great deal of effort is devoted to the artificial tailoring of pinning on yba@xmath0cu@xmath1o@xmath2 based coated conductors,@xcite mainly through the introduction of extended defects whose effect is to further enhance the anisotropic behaviour .",
    "i focus on the model for electrical transport measurements in the linear regime in the mixed state , since this class of measurements is largely used in the study of vortex dynamics .",
    "the interplay between the material anisotropy and the preferential direction introduced by the magnetic field @xmath3 determines a non - straightforward relationship between the applied current density @xmath4 and the corresponding electric field @xmath5 .",
    "indeed , by applying with a generic orientations @xmath4 and @xmath3 , the vortices move under the effect of the lorentz force @xmath6 and induce ( faraday s law ) an electric field @xmath5 which is in general not parallel to @xmath4 even in isotropic superconductors . in anisotropic superconductors , additionally , in general vortices do not move parallel to the lorentz force , further reducing the possibility to obtain an electric field @xmath5 parallel to the applied @xmath4 .    as a consequence , the measured quantities , such as flux flow and campbell resistivities ( and their vortex counterparts , the vortex viscosity and the pinning constant ) , depend on the angles between @xmath3 , @xmath4 and the anisotropy axes .",
    "hence they require a tensor representation and become not straightforwardly related to the material intrinsic properties .",
    "previous works addressed some aspects of the problem , such as : anisotropic flux flow in the pin - free d.c .",
    "regime;@xcite pinning in non linear regimes in tilted fields , studied in the perspective of magnetization measurements;@xcite two - dimensional anisotropic pinning with isotropic viscous drag and fixed magnetic field orientation;@xcite coupling between anisotropic two - fluid currents and vortex motion , the latter described within an isotropic framework.@xcite    in this work i propose a generalized treatment , centered on the force equation for the vortex motion , referring to uniaxial anisotropic superconductors in a magnetic field applied with generic orientation .",
    "both the material anisotropy and pinning , the latter limited to weak random point pins only , are considered and studied in the very different free flux flow and pinned campbell regimes , for arbitrary angles between @xmath3 , @xmath4 and the anisotropy axis .    the objective is to provide all the quantities of interest as tensors , clearly distinguishing between intrinsic and measurable properties .",
    "moreover , in several examples they will be cast into expressions directly exploitable in the experiments and applied to analyze experimental data .",
    "this work is organized as follows : in section [ sec : rhoffi_tensor ] , the electrodynamics model for the flux flow regime is recalled and recast in a suitable form ; in section [ sec : fluxflowregime ] the vortex viscosity , vortex mobility and flux flow resistivity tensors are computed starting from the vortex force equation ; in section [ sec : campbell ] the treatment is extended to the a.c .",
    "campbell regime , yielding the various pinning tensors .",
    "sections [ sec : exp_fluxflow ] and [ sec : exp_campbell ] are devoted to experimental aspects , providing examples for the measurement of the mixed state anisotropic resistivity and of the pinning constant , respectively .",
    "in their works,@xcite hao , hu and ting ( hht ) addressed the problem concerning the d.c .",
    "flux flow resistivity in anisotropic superconductors in the mixed state .",
    "the model holds in the linear regime in a homogeneous superconductor with an uniform magnetic field applied along a generic direction , in the london limit .",
    "the model neglects pinning and assumes vortices to be straight and rigid flux lines moving in a uniform current field density .",
    "this basic model does not take into account more complex phenomena such as helical instabilities of the vortex lines,@xcite which can occur when there are current components parallel to the applied field , or flux - line cutting effects,@xcite or the breaking of vortex lines into pancakes , occurring in the extreme anisotropy , layered superconductors.@xcite accordingly , i do not consider any electric field component @xmath7.@xcite an intrinsic flux flow conductivity tensor@xcite @xmath8 is introduced,@xcite relating the electric field @xmath5 induced by vortices moving with velocity @xmath9 , which can be expressed through the faraday s law as:@xcite @xmath10 to the current @xmath11 which determines the flux flow dissipation , so that , within the linear response theory : @xmath12 the inverse of @xmath8 yields the intrinsic flux flow resistivity tensor @xmath13 : @xmath14 it is important to note that @xmath8 and @xmath13 are _ intrinsic _ quantities which in general are not directly measured . indeed , in typical experimental setups the imposed current @xmath4 needs not to coincide with @xmath11 of eq .",
    ", so that the experimentally measured resistivity tensor @xmath15 , defined as : @xmath16 will be in general different from @xmath13 .",
    "the above equation states that in general , because of the anisotropy , @xmath17 .",
    "an important outcome of this paper will be to obtain explicit relations between the measured ( @xmath15 ) and the intrinsic ( @xmath18 ) flux flow resistivity tensors .",
    "the fact @xmath19 can be understood considering that the electric field @xmath5 induced by the vortex motion is by definition perpendicular to @xmath3 , i.e.",
    "@xmath20 , and therefore:@xcite @xmath21 the latter expression imposes that @xmath11 can not be freely oriented with respect to @xmath3 , so that @xmath11 is in general distinct from @xmath4 , which instead can be externally applied with arbitrary orientation .",
    "one can write:@xcite @xmath22 where @xmath23 is a supercurrent density , parallel to @xmath3 ( i.e. @xmath24 , being @xmath25 the @xmath3 unit vector ) , giving rise to no dissipation related to vortex motion ( flux line cutting@xcite is neglected ) .",
    "the explicit expression for the @xmath8 has been previously derived.@xcite i follow ref . which , working within the time - dependent ginzburg - landau theory ( @xmath26 ) , accounts for both ohmic losses and order parameter relaxation .",
    "i first specify the frame of reference .",
    "the crystallographic axes are taken as the coordinate axes of a cartesian frame of reference ( fig .",
    "[ fig : ref ] ) , so that @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 , being the latter the axis of the uniaxial anisotropy . in this frame of reference the phenomenological mass tensor,@xcite which can be used to describe in the london limit",
    "the material anisotropy , is diagonal : @xmath30 having defined the in - plane mass @xmath31 , the out - of - plane mass @xmath32 and the anisotropy factor @xmath33 .",
    "the mass tensor @xmath34 contains all the information concerning the material anisotropy , since the only source of anisotropy that will be considered is the effective mass of the charge carriers ( this implies , for example , that the possible anisotropy of the scattering time of the normal carriers is neglected )",
    ".     is also depicted , applied along a generic direction at the polar @xmath35 and azimuthal @xmath36 angles.,width=151 ]    by neglecting the hall contribution and assuming the same anisotropy axes for the normal resistivity and mass tensors @xmath37 ( i.e. the mass tensor is the only source of anisotropy also for the normal state ) , the tensors @xmath13 and @xmath8 are also diagonal in the stated frame of reference .",
    "therefore one has : @xmath38 neglecting the weak field dependence of @xmath39 and writing down explicitly all the field dependencies , one obtains:@xcite @xmath40 this equation implies two relevant results .",
    "first , it is consistent with the important scaling law@xcite according to which the field dependence of the anisotropic physical quantities in the mixed state depends on the @xmath41 ratio only .",
    "second , it shows that all the three tensor elements of @xmath13 share the same field dependence through a common function @xmath42 .",
    "therefore eq . can be rewritten as : @xmath43 the above equation highlights the important property that the field and angular dependence of the whole intrinsic flux flow resistivity tensor can be represented by a single scalar function , namely the element @xmath44 .",
    "similarly , the conductivity tensor is : @xmath45    in the following , for ease of notation the angular and field magnitude dependence will be explicitly written only in the equations reporting the main results .",
    "in this section the well - known vortex force equation,@xcite involving the balance of forces acting on an individual vortex , is studied in the regime of pure flux flow .",
    "this regime is realized by an ideal pin - free superconductor , indifferently in d.c . and a.c .",
    "regimes , whereas in real superconductors it can be obtained with d.c .",
    "currents sufficiently large to overcome the pinning forces , or with a.c .",
    "currents at high enough frequencies .",
    "this treatment will provide a generalized formulation which allows ( i ) the determination of the vortex viscosity tensor @xmath46 ( sec .",

    "moreover , for the sake of compactness , the tensor @xmath62 has been introduced :    @xmath63    by equating the first and last member of eq .",
    "@xmath58 , one obtains :    @xmath64    it can be noted that the viscosity tensor @xmath46 does not obey to the angular scaling law and that it depends also on @xmath36 , even if the superconductor is uniaxially anisotropic , because of the faraday - lorentz contribution included in @xmath65 .",
    "analogously to @xmath13 and @xmath8 , an `` intrinsic '' viscosity tensor ( diagonal like @xmath8 ) can be introduced as follows : @xmath66 which obeys the angular scaling law and whose elements are @xmath67 .",
    "equation can be thus rewritten as : [ eq : eta0 ] @xmath68 before computing @xmath48 , some relevant properties of the viscosity tensor will be highlighted .",
    "the eigenvectors of the viscosity tensor @xmath46 are interesting since , by definition , they are specific vortex velocities @xmath69 for which the viscous drag force is parallel to @xmath69 , @xmath70 , where the scalar @xmath71 is the eigenvalue of @xmath69",
    ". hence , for these special directions the viscosity tensor behaves as a scalar , similarly to the behaviour in isotropic materials .",
    "the eigenvectors and eigenvalues can be computed through standard tensor algebra,@xcite yielding the results reported in table [ tab : eigeneta ] .    in the table",
    "the function @xmath72 has been introduced : @xmath73 which corresponds to the well - known angular - dependent anisotropy parameter@xcite @xmath72 , which defines , among the others , the angle dependence of the critical field @xmath74 .",

    "+    it can be seen that the trivial @xmath87 has zero eigenvalue ( as expected from expression ) and that the other two are both @xmath88 .",
    "hence the three ( unit ) eigenvectors of table [ tab : eigeneta ] constitute an orthonormal right - handed basis `` d '' , i.e. they are the principal axes for the viscosity tensor .",
    "the viscosity tensor @xmath46 is then by definition diagonal in the frame of reference with basis `` d '' .",
    "the transformation matrix for this new frame of reference is @xmath89$],@xcite i.e. its columns are given by the coordinates ( in the standard frame of fig .",
    "[ fig : ref ] ) of the three unit eigenvectors . in the following",
    ", the quantities represented in this frame of reference will be denoted with the superscript `` ( d ) '' : for example , given a generic vector @xmath60 and matrix @xmath90 , @xmath91 and @xmath92.@xcite one obtains :    @xmath93    it can be seen that @xmath94 is a symmetric non diagonal matrix , with zero elements in the third row and third column .",
    "the zeroes in the third row ensures that the viscous drag force component @xmath7 is zero , as anticipated in the comment of eq . .",
    "the zeroes in the third column makes the viscous drag force independent from a possible component of @xmath9 parallel to @xmath3 .",
    "thus , the force eq . with the results and imply that @xmath95 , consistently with the framework of the present model in which a motion of rigid vortices parallel to their axes is meaningless .",
    "moreover , it is evident that the viscosity tensor , defined within the three - dimensional space , is not invertible , since its rank=2 .",
    "hence the viscosity tensor is a bijection not in the whole three - dimensional space but only within the plane perpendicular to @xmath25 .",
    "this implies that , for a given lorentz force , the corresponding vortex velocity is univocally determined , property which is useful in the computation of the vortex mobility tensor .",
    "going back to the eigenvectors , since @xmath96 and @xmath97 are @xmath88 , the force equation implies that for both of them it is possible to find a proper current direction @xmath98 which gives a right - handed orthogonal basis @xmath99 $ ] , which evidently ensures that @xmath100 .",
    "taking @xmath3 in the @xmath101-@xmath102 plane ( @xmath103 ) for the ease of notation and without loss of generality , these current directions are reported in the third column of table [ tab : eigeneta ] and represented in fig .",
    "[ fig : fieldcurconf ] , where the left and right panels corresponds to the second line and first line in the table , respectively . in the figure , @xmath104 has been introduced for later reference .",
    "it is worth stressing again that in general @xmath17 , which makes more complex the experimental determination of the material resistivity . in this view , the above two special current - field configurations are especially useful .",
    "i now consider specific current - field configurations where both vectors are directed along the principal axes of a uniaxial superconductor .",
    "i compare the viscosity obtained from the tensor analysis to the results@xcite computed on the bases of the bardeenstephen@xcite model . from table [",
    "tab : eigeneta ] and eq .",
    ", it is easy to check that for these configurations one has the usual right - handed orthogonal basis @xmath105 $ ] and that @xmath106 . as it can be seen in table [ tab : etacfr ] , the results obtained through the two above mentioned procedures are coherent . in the table",
    "the relation @xmath107 , easily obtainable within the bardeenstephen model , is used .",
    "one additional comment can be done by considering the full @xmath46 tensor explicitly computed for the field orientations along the principal axes and reported in the fifth column of table [ tab : etacfr ] . in this case , the viscosity tensor is diagonal : this means that , by taking @xmath25 and @xmath98 along two principal axes , the vortex motion ( both in terms of @xmath108 and @xmath109 ) occurs along the third principal axis .",
    "moreover , when @xmath25 is parallel to a principal axis , it can be easily verified that the viscosity tensor @xmath46 is diagonal if _ and only if _ @xmath8 is itself diagonal , meaning that the same principal axes of @xmath8 are inherited by @xmath46 .",

    "thus , i exploit the results of section [ sec : viscosity ] : within the plane @xmath124 , @xmath47 is the inverse bijection of @xmath46 whereas the vortex mobility for the ( physically not existing ) lorentz force component @xmath125 can be safely set @xmath126 .",
    "hence , in the frame of reference `` ( d ) '' the vortex mobility is the following diagonal matrix : @xmath127 in the principal frame of reference , one obtains : @xmath128      the flux flow resistivity tensor @xmath48 can be now computed in terms of the vortex mobility @xmath129 . by left cross - multiplying both members of eq . by @xmath3 one obtains , after a little algebra , @xmath130 , valid @xmath131 , which implies : @xmath132 it is of paramount importance that eq .",

    "indeed , with a little algebra ( see appendix [ sec : tensorelementsderivation ] ) it can be demonstrated that the direct measurement of @xmath165 is impossible in general : whichever combination of directions of @xmath3 and @xmath4 is chosen , @xmath165 can not be directly accessed : the measured angular dependence of the vortex - state , @xmath156-axis resistivity in tilted fields _ never _ corresponds to the material - dependent quantity .",
    "hence , @xmath165 must be _ indirectly _ determined through coupled , complementary measurements .",
    "an obvious choice for one of the two needed configurations is the maximum lorentz force configuration ( eq . ) , while the other could be equivalently chosen between the two last commented configurations ( eqs . and ) .",

    "hence the material resistivity along the anisotropy axis , i.e. the intrinsic @xmath156-axis resistivity , can not be measured if the magnetic field is parallel to the same axis , not even by resorting to the measurement of the transverse resistivity components ( i.e. through the determination of the transverse components of the electric field ) .    on the other hand , for a generic @xmath179",

    "currents flowing in anisotropic superconductors with random point pinning centers , described in the weak collective pinning regime.@xcite in particular , i focus on the well - known campbell regime , in which the pinning action on vortices dominates over the dissipative viscous drag and the pinning force is proportional to the small displacement @xmath180 of the vortices from the pinning centers .",
    "the above two conditions are achieved respectively for frequencies smaller than the so - called pinning frequency ( of the order of a few mhz in conventional superconductors@xcite and of several ghz in high-@xmath181 superconductors,@xcite low-@xmath181 thin films@xcite and more complex superconducting heterostructures@xcite ) and for currents small enough to ensure the validity of the linear regime .",
    "considering only point pins ( i.e. zero - dimensional pinning centers ) ensures that no further preferential directions are introduced in the superconducting system , in contrast with extended ( e.g. linear or planar ) defects .",
    "the starting point is the force equation written in the sinusoidal regime @xmath182 , including the pinning force and neglecting the viscous drag : @xmath183 where @xmath184 is the pinning constant ( also called labusch parameter ) tensor and @xmath185 is the displacement of the fluxon from the pinning center .",
    "no creep phenomena are considered .    in the campbell regime ,",
    "losses due to finite real conductivity are neglected , so that the resistivity is purely imaginary and defined , in isotropic superconductors , as : @xmath186 where @xmath187 is the campbell penetration depth.@xcite    going back to anisotropic superconductors , it is evident that the force equation in the campbell regime is formally equivalent to the force equation written for the pure flux flow regime .",

    "it is worth noting that the above equations do not complete the model in the campbell regime , since an explicit expression for the intrinsic tensor @xmath191 is still needed .",
    "whereas in the flux flow regime the problem about the corresponding intrinsic tensor @xmath13 was addressed by the tdgl treatment,@xcite the determination of the intrinsic tensor @xmath191 will be addressed in the following section .",
    "i assume that @xmath191 is diagonal like @xmath13 : this ensures that , according to the final comment of sec .",
    "[ sec : vortexprincipal ] , choosing @xmath25 and @xmath98 along two principal axes , the corresponding pinning force ( and vortex velocity ) will be parallel to the third axis , as it is reasonable to expect . this assumption does not define the whole tensor , since it does not give any information about the two ( within the uniaxial anisotropy ) non - zero diagonal elements , @xmath192 and @xmath193 .    as already seen for its flux flow counterpart ,",
    "@xmath193 is not directly accessible through real current - field configurations .",
    "therefore , it has to be derived indirectly starting from two experimentally measurable resistivities .",

    "[ sec : exp_fluxflow ] and depicted in fig .",

    "it is worth recalling that , in the present campbell regime , the applied @xmath4 is a ( low - frequency and small intensity ) a.c .",

    "hence the pinning force @xmath202 is @xmath203 and is completely described by the scalar eigenvalue pinning constant @xmath204 , which within the two configurations will be denoted as @xmath205 or @xmath206 . this property explains the present choice of the field - current configurations , since other geometries would have given different orientations for @xmath180 yielding @xmath207 and thus preventing a description of the pinning force through one scalar @xmath204 only .",
    "the definition allows then to write down the following :    [ eq : rhoc_xy ] @xmath208    the actual values of the pinning constants are determined as follows .      by simple physical arguments,@xcite for an isotropic superconductor one can evaluate the pinning constant @xmath209 by equating the maximum pinning force @xmath210 acting on a vortex , where @xmath211 denotes the action range of the pinning centers , with the maximum lorentz force @xmath212 exerted when the current equals the critical current density . since for core - pinning @xmath213 , i.e. the coherence length which define the length scale for the spatial variations of order parameter and therefore the radius of the vortex core , one can write @xmath214 where @xmath215 .    for anisotropic superconductors , eq .",
    "must be specialized for the two current configurations `` ( x ) '' and `` ( y@xmath198 ) '' used in eqs . .",
    "the pinning constant @xmath205 [ @xmath206 ] describes the pinning action on vortices moving along the @xmath217 [ @xmath149 ] direction under the action of a current @xmath219 [ @xmath220 : hence the critical current density @xmath221 [ @xmath222 , and @xmath223 [ @xmath224 , i.e. the coherence length along the direction @xmath217 [ @xmath149 ] of the vortex movement .",
    "therefore :    [ eq : kp_jc_xy ] @xmath225    one should note that @xmath206 , despite being referred to a current - field configuration of difficult realization in the experiments , is related to quantities ( @xmath226 and @xmath227 ) which can be expressed within available theories . in this sense , eq .",
    "gives a tool for subsequent elaborations .",
    "indeed , the above equations can be further developed using the blatter - geshkenbein - larkin ( bgl ) scaling law:@xcite in the london approximation , a thermodynamic or intrinsic transport property @xmath228 of a uniaxially anisotropic superconductor depends on the applied field @xmath229 and angle @xmath35 only through the ratio @xmath41 , so that @xmath230 , where @xmath231 is the field - dependent quantity in the equivalent ( according to the scaling rules ) isotropic superconductor , and @xmath232 is a scaling factor typically equal to 1 , @xmath233 or @xmath234 .",
    "the current densities @xmath235 and @xmath226 are provided in ref . for point - pinning in the single vortex and small - bundle pinning regime ( the scaling theory does not describe the large bundle pinning regime , in the highest field and temperature regions ) .",
    "it is found@xcite that they scale as :    [ eq : scalingjc ] @xmath236    where the full expression of @xmath237 is reported in ref . for different pinning regimes .",
    "it is worth stressing that the critical current @xmath237 ( and the corresponding @xmath238 ) for the equivalent isotropic superconductor is not angle - dependent because point pins only are considered , whereas extended pinning centers would introduce preferential directions and therefore angle - dependent quantities even in the isotropic superconductor .",
    "geometrically , the quantities @xmath239 and @xmath240 represent the maximum distances between the axis of the displaced vortex and the point pin .",
    "these distances are univocally defined since in the present model vortices are straight lines and the pinning centers are points with zero spatial extension .",
    "they scale as:@xcite    [ eq : scalingxi ] @xmath241    where @xmath242 denotes the in - plane coherence length .    by using eqs . and in eq . , one can write :    [ eq : kp_jc_xy2 ] @xmath243    it is worth stressing that , thanks to eq . , it is @xmath244 hence the in - plane pinning constant @xmath245 obeys the scaling law given by eq . .",
    "according to eqs . and , one obtains : @xmath246 on the other hand , @xmath247 , using eqs . , and , becomes : @xmath248 therefore , similarly to @xmath13 of eq .",
    ", one can write : @xmath249",
    "this is an important result of this paper : for point pinning , the anisotropy of the pinning tensors and the flux flow tensors is the same and is completely described by the mass anisotropy tensor .",
    "this result is very important also in the study of regimes where both losses and pinning phenomena are equally relevant , placing themselves in a intermediate situation between purely dissipative flux flow and purely reactive campbell regimes .",
    "these regimes , occurring at higher frequencies including the microwave range , will be studied in a future work.@xcite",
    "lastly , due to eq . , the intrinsic pinning constant tensor also satisfies the scaling law : @xmath250 while the measured pinning constant tensor does not : @xmath251 because of the additional contribution given by @xmath252 ( eq . ) .",
    "in this section i provide an example showing the additional information which can be gained using the results of the present work by performing an analysis of experimental data .",
    "various techniques can be used to explore the campbell regime , including inductance measurements,@xcite a.c .",
    "linear susceptibility measurements @xcite and the vibrating reed technique.@xcite the pinning constant can be also determined through microwave measurements,@xcite but they typically go beyond the pure campbell regime and , as such , they are beyond the scope of this work and postponed to a future study.@xcite in the following , i focus on a.c .",

    "the source of the experimental data is ref . , where full details about the experiment can be found .",
    "the measured squared real part of the penetration depth @xmath253 ( @xmath254 is the london penetration depth ) is related to the squared campbell penetration depth @xmath255 which , given the geometry of the experiment , is @xmath256 .",
    "the examined sample are two twinned yba@xmath0cu@xmath1o@xmath2 single crystals , one irradiated at + 30@xmath257 with respect the @xmath156-axis in order to create columnar defects capable of reinforcing the pinning properties and one , virgin , used as reference . as a consequence , four sources of pinning",
    "are expected : point pins and three types of correlated pinning centers , namely the twins along the @xmath156-axis direction , the @xmath150-@xmath151 planes and the columnar defects at + 30@xmath257 ( in the irradiated sample only ) .",
    "it was concluded that pinning was stronger with the field aligned with columnar defects and , from a qualitative analysis , that an enhancement of pinning existed even far from the track direction .",
    "i show in the following that such findings can be put on solid quantitative grounds by exploiting the present model .",
    "in particular , i will use the model developed in the previous section to remove the anisotropic response due to the material anisotropy and to point pins , which can give rise to a significant angle - dependent contribution .",
    "the latter can in principle mask the angle - dependent contributions arising from correlated defects .    here",
    "i consider the data taken from fig . 5 of ref .",
    "for the irradiated sample only , where @xmath258 measured at various angles @xmath35 at t=@xmath259k is reported . in order to extract @xmath260 ,",
    "i extrapolate @xmath261 , take it as an evaluation of @xmath262 and , by neglecting pair - breaking effects , estimate @xmath263 .",
    "then the pinning constant is obtained , using eq . with @xmath264 and normalizing with @xmath265 .",
    "the normalized pinning constant , @xmath266 , is then free from geometrical factors .",
    "the result is reported in fig .",
    "[ fig : labusch]a .",
    "the pinning constant in the irradiated sample with @xmath25 along the columnar defects ( @xmath267 ) is larger than along the other directions .",
    "moreover , by examining the curves with @xmath268 and @xmath269 , it was noted@xcite that , despite being very similar at low fields , the two curves depart near half the matching field @xmath270oe .",
    "thus , it was inferred@xcite that the defects still determined an appreciable contribution to pinning even for the field tilted at @xmath268 , 60@xmath257 far from the tracks directions .",
    "actually , this observation can be further substantiated by resorting to the result of section [ sec : campbell ] , namely eqs . and : were only point pinning present , the in - plane pinning constant at different fields and angles should scale so that by plotting @xmath271 vs @xmath272 all the curves should overlap .",
    "any possible residual difference between the scaled curves should then be ascribed to the effects of correlated defects only , since the scaling removes the background effect of point pinning centers .",
    "the result of such scaling is reported in fig .",
    "[ fig : labusch]b , where @xmath273 has been used ( taking@xcite @xmath274 does not change the result ) .",
    "it can be seen that , even by having removed the effect of point pins , along the tracks directions pinning remains the largest . on the other hand ,",
    "the absolute values for @xmath268 are now larger than those for @xmath269 .",
    "since at these angles the contribution of twins and @xmath150-@xmath151 planes can be neglected ( see also fig . 2 in ref .",
    ") , one can infer that at @xmath268 the artificial defects still reinforce pinning , yielding a higher pinning constant than the one measured at @xmath269 .",
