    "in this work we analyze the behavior of a family of steady state solutions of a homogeneous neumann problem for a nonlinear reaction diffusion equation when some reaction and potential terms are concentrated in a @xmath0-neighborhood of a subset @xmath1 of the boundary that shrinks to @xmath1 as the small parameter @xmath0 goes to zero . roughly , we are assuming that some reactions of the system occur only in an extremely thin region near the border with oscillating upper boundary .",
    "we show that in some sense this singular problem can be approximated by a nonlinear elliptic system with nonlinear boundary conditions where the oscillatory behavior of the neighborhood is captured as a flux condition and a potential term on the portion @xmath1 of the boundary .    to describe the problem , let @xmath4 be the open square in @xmath5 and let @xmath6 be the line segment in @xmath5 given by @xmath7 we consider the following uniformly bounded @xmath0-neighborhood of @xmath1 with oscillatory upper boundary @xmath8 here we assume that @xmath9 is a function satisfying @xmath10 for fixed positive constants @xmath11 and @xmath12 which oscillates as the small parameter @xmath13 .",
    "this is expressed by assuming that @xmath14 the function @xmath15 is a positive smooth function , with @xmath16 periodic in @xmath17 for fixed @xmath18 with period @xmath19 uniformly bounded in @xmath20 , that is , @xmath21 .",
    "let us observe that our assumptions includes the case where the function @xmath22 presents a purely periodic behavior , for instance , @xmath23 .",
    "but it also considers the case where the function @xmath22 defines a strip where the oscillations period , the amplitude and the profile vary with respect to @xmath24",
    ". see figure [ fig1 ] below that illustrates the oscillating strip @xmath25 .",
    "we are interested in the behavior of the solutions of the nonlinear elliptic problem @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the characteristic function of the set @xmath28 , @xmath29 denotes the unit outward normal vector to @xmath30 and @xmath31 is a suitable real number . the nonlinearities @xmath32",
    "are continuous in both variables and @xmath33 in the second one , where @xmath34 is an open set containing @xmath35 .",
    "we also assume that there exists @xmath36 independent of @xmath0 such that the family of potential @xmath37 satisfies @xmath38 also , we suppose there exists a function @xmath39 which is the limit of the concentrating term @xmath40    in our model , we use the characteristic function @xmath27 and the small positive parameter @xmath0 to express the concentration on the region @xmath25 by the term @xmath41 since @xmath42 is thin and it is `` approaching '' the line segment @xmath6 , it is reasonable to expect that the family of solutions @xmath43 will converge to a solution of an equation of the same type with nonlinear boundary condition on @xmath1 . indeed , we will show that , for @xmath44 big enough , the solutions of ( [ 1 ] ) converge in @xmath45 to the solutions of the nonlinear elliptic problem @xmath46 where the boundary coefficient @xmath47 is related to the oscillating function @xmath22 and is given by @xmath48 as previously mentioned , we obtain a limit problem with nonlinear boundary condition that captures the oscillatory behavior of the upper boundary of the set @xmath28 .",
    "in fact , its nonlinear boundary condition involves the function @xmath49 , that is , the mean value of @xmath50 for each @xmath51 .",
    "we now summarize these assertions precisely as our main result .",
    "[ main ] let @xmath43 be a family of solutions of the problem satisfying @xmath52 for some positive constant @xmath53 independent of @xmath0 .",
    "then , there exists @xmath54 independent of @xmath0 such that , for all @xmath55 , there exists a subsequence , still defined by @xmath43 , and a function @xmath56 , with @xmath57 , solution of the problem satisfying @xmath58 as @xmath13 .",
    "since we are concerned with solutions which are uniformly bounded in @xmath59 , we may assume that the nonlinearities @xmath60 and @xmath61 are @xmath33-functions with bounded derivatives in the second variable .",
    "indeed , we may perform a cut - off in @xmath60 and @xmath61 outside the region @xmath62 , without modifying any of these solutions .",
    "this kind of problem was initially studied in  @xcite where linear elliptic equations posed on @xmath33-regular domains were considered . there , the @xmath0-neighborhood is a strip of width @xmath0 with base in a portion of the boundary without oscillatory behavior .",
    "later , the asymptotic behavior of the attractors of a parabolic problem were analyzed in  @xcite , where the upper semicontinuity of attractors at @xmath63 was proved .",
    "the same technique of  @xcite has been used in  @xcite , where the results of  @xcite were extended to reaction - diffusion problems with delay .",
    "the goal of our work is to extend some results of  @xcite to nonlinear elliptic problems when the upper boundary of the strip @xmath28 presents a highly oscillatory behavior .",
    "we also use some ideas of  @xcite where elliptic and parabolic problems defined in thin domains with a highly oscillatory boundary have been extensively studied .",
    "it is important to note that in our work the boundary @xmath30 of the domain @xmath64 is only lipschitz .",
    "in this section we describe some technical results that will be needed in the proof of the main result .",
    "we initially analyze how our concentrating integrals converge to boundary integrals .",
    "we adapt the results of @xcite on convergence of concentrated integrals using that @xmath65 uniformly in @xmath66 .",

    "then , for @xmath79 , @xmath80 and @xmath81 , if we define the operators @xmath82 by @xmath83 we have @xmath84 in @xmath85 .",
    "we also need some results about weak limits of rapidly oscillating functions .",
    "[ lge ] if @xmath86 is defined as in ( [ defg ] ) , then @xmath87    we have to prove @xmath88 since the set of step function is dense in @xmath89 and any step function is a linear combination of characteristic functions , it is enough to take @xmath90 the characteristic function on the interval @xmath91 , for @xmath92 .",
    "so , we have to estimate the integral @xmath93 for this , let @xmath94 be a small number and let @xmath95 be a partition for the interval @xmath91 , and @xmath96 be a fixed point in the interval @xmath97 $ ] , @xmath98 , such that @xmath99 where @xmath100 it is easy to estimate the integrals @xmath101 , @xmath102 , @xmath103 and @xmath104 to obtain @xmath105 , @xmath105 , @xmath105 and @xmath105 , where the function @xmath106 is the step function defined for each @xmath107 by @xmath108 since these inequalities do not depend on @xmath109 , and @xmath110 as @xmath111 uniformly in @xmath0 , we have that @xmath101 , @xmath102 , @xmath103 and @xmath104 goes to zero as @xmath111 uniformly in @xmath109 .",
    "hence , to conclude the proof , we just evaluate the integral @xmath112 .",
    "but this is a application of  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 2.6 )",
    ".    the following result will also be needed .",

    "to write the problems and in an abstract form , we first define the continuous bilinear forms @xmath132 , @xmath133 , by @xmath134    we then consider the linear operator @xmath135 defined by the relationship @xmath136 now , we can write the problem as @xmath137 for @xmath138 , where @xmath139 with @xmath140 is defined by @xmath141    similarly , we can write the problem in an abstract form as @xmath142 where @xmath143 with @xmath140 is defined by @xmath144 where @xmath116 is given by and @xmath117 is the trace operator .",
    "[ rem1 ] there exists @xmath54 independent of @xmath133 such that the bilinear form @xmath145 is uniformly coercive for all @xmath55 .    here",
    "we will just consider the case @xmath145 with @xmath109 .",
    "a similar argument gives the result to the bilinear form @xmath146 .",
    "first we note that for every @xmath147 we have @xmath148 where @xmath149 is the negative part of the potential @xmath78 such that @xmath150 .",
    "for this negative part we have the following bound @xmath151 choosing @xmath152 and @xmath153 , that is , @xmath154 , and using the lemma [ lem1 ] with @xmath155 , we get @xmath156 next we can use young s inequality to obtain @xmath157 for any @xmath158",
    ". then , it follows from ( [ t1 ] ) and ( [ t2 ] ) that @xmath159 consequently , we can take @xmath158 small enough and @xmath160 large enough such that @xmath161 with @xmath162 independent of @xmath0 .",
    "therefore , the bilinear form @xmath163 , @xmath164 , is strictly coercive",
    ". we still note that if @xmath165 in ( [ cf ] ) , then we can take any @xmath160 .",
    "the lemma [ rem1 ] implies that @xmath43 is a solution of if only if @xmath166 satisfies @xmath167 , that is , @xmath43 must be a fixed point of the nonlinear map @xmath168 for all @xmath55 .",
    "the existence of solutions of follows then from schauder s fixed point theorem . in a very similar way",
    ", the solutions of the limit problem can be obtained as fixed points of the map @xmath169 note that they can also be obtained as limits of solutions of , as shown in the next section .",
    "in order to obtain the upper semicontinuity of the family @xmath43 , we study the behavior of the maps @xmath170 and @xmath171 defined in and .",
    "[ lem1eq ] @xmath172 if @xmath173 satisfies @xmath174 , then there exists @xmath175 independent of @xmath0 such that @xmath176    @xmath177 suppose @xmath178 .",

    "part ( 3 ) follows from ( 2 ) adding and subtracting @xmath184 .",
    "so , we just have to prove ( 2 ) . for this",

    "@xmath190 from lemma  [ lem2 ] , we have @xmath191 as @xmath127 , for each @xmath189 . also , this limit is uniform for @xmath192 in compact sets of @xmath193 since @xmath194 \\}$ ] is equicontinuous for fixed @xmath173 . hence , for @xmath195 , we have that the embedding @xmath196 is compact , and @xmath197 now , we show that ( [ convpont1 ] ) is uniform for @xmath173 with @xmath198 .",
    "first , observe that @xmath199 are continuous in @xmath45 with the weak topology , for @xmath66 .",
    "indeed , it follows from lemma  [ lem1 ] and regularity of @xmath60 that there exist @xmath200 , @xmath175 , independents of @xmath0 , and @xmath201 with @xmath202 such that @xmath203 similarly , we get @xmath204 so , since @xmath205 compactly for @xmath206 , we have that @xmath185 and @xmath207 are continuous in @xmath45 with weak topology . hence , @xmath185 and @xmath207 are uniformly continuous in @xmath208 , proving the result .",
    "now , we are in a position to prove our main result , theorem [ main ] .",
    "first , we prove that a family of solutions @xmath43 of satisfying @xmath209 is uniformly bounded in @xmath210 with respect to @xmath0 .",
    "in fact , we have that @xmath43 satisfies @xmath211 hence , if we take @xmath212 , we obtain from lemma [ lem1eq ] that @xmath213 . due to lemma [ rem1 ] , we have that the bilinear form @xmath145 is uniformly coercive for @xmath133 ( we are using @xmath55 ) .",
    "thus , @xmath214 for some constant @xmath36 independent of @xmath0 , which implies @xmath215 for all @xmath133 .",
    "since @xmath43 is uniformly bounded in @xmath210 , we can extract a weakly convergent subsequence , still denoted by @xmath43 , such that @xmath216 , @xmath217 , for some @xmath56 .",
    "it is easy to see that @xmath218 satisfies our limit problem .",

    "for this , we pass to the limit in @xmath221 and we use that the norm is lower semicontinuous with respect to the weak convergence ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* proposition 1.14 ) ) , that is , @xmath222 , to obtain @xmath223",
    "we have shown that the steady state solutions of a homogeneous neumann problem for a nonlinear reaction diffusion equation converge to a certain limit problem when some reaction and potential terms are concentrated in a small neighborhood of of the boundary .    in our analysis",
    "we showed that the family of steady state solutions converges in @xmath224-norm to a solution @xmath218 of an equation of the same type , with a nonlinear boundary condition that captures both the profile and the oscillatory behavior of the boundary .",
    "an important feature here is that we are dealing with the case where the boundary presents a highly oscillatory behavior and , as a consequence , the limit problem is not obvious from the start .",
    "it is also worth remembering that the domain considered here is only lipschitz continuous .",
