    "derived equivalences have become increasingly important in representation theory , lie theory and geometry .",
    "examples are ranging from mirror symmetry over non - commutative geometry to the kazhdan - lusztig conjecture and to brou s conjecture for blocks of finite groups . in all of these situtations , and in many others , derived equivalences",
    "are used that involve finite or infinite dimensional algebras . derived equivalences between algebras , or rings ,",
    "exist if and only if there exist suitable tilting complexes , as explained quite satisfactorily by rickard s morita theory for derived categories of rings ( see @xcite ) ) .",
    "derived equivalences have been shown to preserve many significant algebraic and geometric invariants and often to provide unexpected and useful new connections .",
    "a crucial question in this context has , however , not yet received enough answers :    _ how to construct derived equivalences between rings in a general setup ? _    a good answer - certainly not unique - to this question should be general , flexible and systematic and apply to a multitude of algebraic and geometric situations .",
    "one well - developed approach is based on the theory of tilting modules , building upon results by happel @xcite .",
    "other answers use ring theoretic constructions , such as trivial extensions @xcite .",
    "the aim of this article is to provide a rather different approach .",
    "the input of the technology developed here is a triple of objects @xmath3 in a triangulated category .",
    "these objects are required to be related by certain universal maps ( cohomological approximations - a new concept introduced here , continuing approximation theory of auslander , reiten and smal @xcite ) and some cohomological orthogonality conditions in degrees different from zero only .",
    "the output is a derived equivalence between cohomological endomorphism rings of @xmath4 and of @xmath5 .",
    "the flexibility of the construction lies in the following features : we enhance endomorphism rings by higher extensions to produce cohomological endomorphism rings , broadening the classical concept of yoneda extension algebras . here",
    ", we can choose a set of cohomological degrees to define the cohomological endomorphism ring .",
    "choosing degree zero only gives endomorphism rings in the usual sense - and then no orthogonality assumption is needed .",
    "choosing all integers , or a suitable subset thereof ( satisfying an associativity constraint ) , amplifies the concept of yoneda extension algebras @xmath6 .",
    "there is also some flexibility in the choice of @xmath7 .    a special case of such a triple is given by any auslander - reiten triangle @xmath8 in a derived module category ; this already indicates generality of the construction .",
    "our assumptions are actually much more general and not limited to objects in derived categories of algebras .",
    "a particular feature of the derived equivalences constructed by this method is that they also provide a very general _ mutation procedure _ , turning one ring into another one in a systematic way .",
    "tilting theory has arisen as a far reaching extension of reflection functors for quivers . under some assumptions , but not in general , it provides mutation procedures between two given quivers or algebras , both of which are endomorphism rings of tilting modules ; in the case of quivers one may reflect at sink or source vertices .",
    "mutations similar in style also have come up in various geometric situations .",
    "the theory of cluster categories , or more generally of calabi - yau categories , has extended reflections to a mutation procedure , which works for representations of quivers at all vertices .",
    "such mutations fit into the present framework as well .",
    "there is , though , a new feature introduced by our approach : reflection does not work in general in derived categories ( of quivers or algebras ) .",
    "therefore cluster theory passes to the cluster category , a quotient of a derived category modulo the action of some functor ; endomorphism rings are taken there .",
    "in contrast to this , the current approach always produces equivalences on the level of derived categories , not just of quotient categories ; throughout we are considering derived equivalences between ( cohomological ) endomorphism rings or quotients thereof . in the case of quivers , this possibility of passing to quotient algebras allows mutation at an arbitrary vertex .",
    "more generality and flexibility is added by extending the concept of higher extensions , that is of shifted morphisms ; it is possible to replace the shift functor by any other auto - equivalence of the ambient triangulated category .",
    "there is even a version using two such functors .    the main result of this article provides a construction of derived equivalences in a setup that is very general in several respects .",
    "in the following explanation we start with a special case and then add generality step by step , finally arriving at the main result .",
    "the setup always is a triangulated category @xmath9 , which is an @xmath10-category for some commutative artinian ring @xmath10 , with identity ; so , morphism sets in @xmath9 are @xmath10-modules .    1 .   to start with , we choose any object @xmath7 in @xmath9 and a triangle @xmath11 $ ] , where @xmath12 and @xmath13 are @xmath14-approximations , that is universal maps from @xmath15 to objects in @xmath14 or from @xmath14 to @xmath16 , respectively ; in particular , @xmath17 is in @xmath14 .",
    "for instance , auslander - reiten triangles ( over algebras ) provide such situations .",
    "if the triangle is induced by an exact sequence in an abelian category , then the theorem implies a derived equivalence between the two endomorphism rings @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "this can be seen as a mutation procedure relating the two endomorphism rings .",
    "the derived equivalence has already been established in @xcite .",
    "2 .   in the second step , recasting an idea of @xcite , endomorphism rings are replaced by _ cohomological endomorphism rings _ in the following sense : higher extensions between modules @xmath20 and @xmath21 are shifted morphisms in the derived category , @xmath22)$ ] .",
    "using yoneda multiplication of extensions , this defines an algebra structure on the cohomological endomorphism ring , or generalised yoneda algebra , @xmath23)$ ] .",
    "when @xmath20 is a complex , or any object in a triangulated category @xmath9 , negative degrees @xmath24 may occur .",
    "the main theorem provides derived equivalences between such generalised yoneda algebras .",
    "the construction works , however , not only for these yoneda algebras , but also for perforated ones in the following sense : choose a subset @xmath25 .",
    "then , under some associativity constraint requiring @xmath1 to be admissible ( see subsection [ 2.3 ] ) , the space @xmath26)$ ] is an associative algebra , that in general is neither a subalgebra nor a quotient algebra of the yoneda algebra @xmath27)$ ] .",
    "this algebra is called a _ @xmath1-yoneda algebra _ or a _ @xmath1-perforated yoneda algebra_. we will use the notation @xmath28 for the algebra @xmath29)$ ] , where @xmath30 is any object in @xmath9 .",
    "+ the assumptions of the first step get modified by using cohomological approximations , in the degrees specified by @xmath1 , instead of approximations in degree zero only .",
    "auslander - reiten triangles still satisfy these properties . adding higher extensions requires also to add an orthogonality assumption without which the result would be wrong : assume @xmath31 ) = 0 = { { \\rm hom } } ( y , m[j])$ ] for all @xmath32 .",
    "for the sake of exposition also assume for a moment that the above triangle @xmath33 $ ] is in a derived module category and it is induced from an exact sequence with corresponding properties .",
    "then there are derived equivalences between @xmath1-yoneda algebras @xmath34 .",
    "3 .   this result needs to be modified , if the triangle is not induced by an exact sequence any more .",
    "then some annihilators have to be factored out of the degree zero parts of the cohomological endomorphism rings , and the derived equivalences are connecting the quotient algebras @xmath35 and @xmath36 . here , the ideals @xmath37 and @xmath38 can be described as follows : let @xmath39 and @xmath40 the idempotent element in @xmath41 corresponding to the direct summand @xmath7 .",
    "then @xmath38 is the submodule of the left @xmath41-module @xmath42 , which is maximal with respect to @xmath43 .",
    "let @xmath44 , and @xmath45 the idempotent in @xmath46 corresponding to the direct summand @xmath7 .",
    "then @xmath37 is the submodule of the right @xmath46-module @xmath47 , which is maximal with respect to @xmath48 .",
    "+ another , equivalent , description of @xmath37 and @xmath38 is that @xmath37 consists of all elements @xmath49 such that @xmath50 for @xmath51 and @xmath52 factorises through @xmath14 and @xmath53 , and @xmath38 consists of all elements @xmath54 such that @xmath55 for @xmath51 and @xmath56 factorises through @xmath14 and @xmath57 , where @xmath58 is the diagonal morphism diag@xmath59 , and @xmath60 is the skew - diagonal morphism skewdiag@xmath61 .",
    "4 .   the fourth level of generalisation allows to replace the shift functor by any auto - equivalence of the triangulated category @xmath62 , thus providing a new and versatile meaning of higher extensions in terms of morphisms with one variable shifted by powers of the auto - equivalence .",
    "the additional datum @xmath63 gets mentioned , when necessary , in the notation as an additional superscript , as in @xmath64 .    in this general form ,",
    "the main theorem is as follows :    let @xmath1 be an admissible subset of @xmath65 , and let @xmath9 be a triangulated @xmath10-category and @xmath7 an object in @xmath9 .",
    "assume that @xmath63 is an invertible triangle functor from @xmath9 to itself .",
    "suppose that @xmath66\\ ] ] is a triangle in @xmath62 such that    @xmath67 the morphism @xmath12 is a left @xmath68-approximation of @xmath15 and @xmath13 is a right @xmath69-approximation of @xmath16 ,    @xmath70 @xmath71 for all @xmath51 .",
    "then @xmath72 and @xmath73 are derived equivalent , where @xmath37 and @xmath38 are the above ideals of the @xmath1-yoneda algebras @xmath74 and @xmath75 , contained in @xmath76 and @xmath77 , respectively .",
    "[ thm1 ]    a fifth level of generalisation , using two functors @xmath63 and @xmath78 , will be discussed in the appendix .",
    "a further generalisation of some results in this paper to @xmath0-angulated categories introduced in @xcite will be considered in @xcite .",
    "the second level of generality , where @xmath63 is the shift functor and both @xmath37 and @xmath38 are zero , is already widely applicable .",
    "this case happens frequently for the derived category @xmath79 of an @xmath10-algebra @xmath80 .",
    "let @xmath1 be an admissible subset of @xmath81 , and let @xmath80 be an @xmath10-algebra and @xmath7 an @xmath80-module . if @xmath82 is an exact sequence in @xmath83 such that @xmath12 is a left @xmath84-approximation of @xmath15 and @xmath13 is a right @xmath85-approximation of @xmath16 in @xmath79 , and that @xmath86 for all @xmath51 , then the @xmath1-yoneda algebras @xmath87 and @xmath88 are derived equivalent .",
    "[ cor2 ]    these results partly generalise some results of @xcite .",
    "the setup here , and the main result , covers , combines and extends several classical concepts :    auslander algebras - endomorphism rings of direct sums of all modules of an algebra of finite representation type - are the ingredients of the celebrated auslander correspondence , characterising finite representation type via homological dimensions .",
    "auslander algebras of derived equivalent algebras are , in general , not derived equivalent ; positive results in this direction - for self - injective algebras of finite representation type - previously have been obtained in @xcite . in the current approach",
    "new results can be obtained by appropriate choices of @xmath89 .",
    "another intensively studied class of algebras is that of yoneda algebras , that is , algebras of self - extensions of a semisimple module , or more generally of any module .",
    "apparently , the constructions in corollary [ cor2 ] and in @xcite provide the first general class of derived equivalences for yoneda algebras .",
    "perforated yoneda algebras first have been defined in @xcite , under the name @xmath1-auslander - yoneda algebras .",
    "the approach developed there has been based on the existence of particular kinds of derived equivalences for algebras , which then have been used to construct derived equivalences for perforated yoneda algebras .",
    "the main novelty of the present approach is the systematic use of cohomological data , such as cohomological approximations and perforated yoneda algebras .",
    "this relates smoothly with a wide variety of concepts , such as auslander - reiten sequences and triangles , dominant dimension , calabi - yau categories and frobenius categories .",
    "the article is organised as follows . in section [ sect2 ] , we first fix notation , and then recall definitions and basic results on derived equivalences as well as on admissible sets and perforated yoneda algebras . also , we extend the notion of @xmath90-approximation to what we call cohomological @xmath91-approximation with respect to @xmath92 , where @xmath63 is a functor and @xmath1 is a subset of @xmath81 . in section",
    "[ sect3 ] , the main result , theorem [ thm1 ] , is proven and various easier to access situations are described , for which the assumptions of theorem [ thm1 ] are satisfied .",
    "section [ sect4 ] explains how theorem [ thm1 ] applies to a variety of situations : derived categories of artin algebras , frobenius categories and calabi - yau categories . also , the connection to the concept of dominant dimension is explained . in section [ sect5 ] ,",
    "two examples are given to illustrate the results and to show the necessity of some assumptions in theorem [ thm1 ] .",
    "in the appendix , a more general formulation of theorem [ thm1 ] is stated , which involves two functors , in order to add more flexibility with a view to potential future applications .",
