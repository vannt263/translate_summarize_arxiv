    "they reproduce the behaviour of the numerical occupation numbers averaged over the shell - structure fluctuations .",
    "let us now estimate the direct and resonant contributions to the recombination rate of au@xmath3 .",

    "this corresponds to the recombination rate of @xmath164 @xmath165s@xmath1 , which is two orders of magnitude smaller than the experimental @xmath166 @xmath165s@xmath1 at this energy ( hoffknecht _ et al .",
    "_ 1998 ) .",
    "the electron energy of 0.1 ev is equal to the transversal temperature of the electron beam in the experiment , whereas the longitudinal temperature is much smaller , 1 mev .",
