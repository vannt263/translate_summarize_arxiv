    "the evolution of interacting binaries occurs as a consequence of mass transfer between the stars , and this process has been studied using spectroscopic and photometric analyses , theoretical simulations , and imaging techniques . specifically , the image reconstruction technique of doppler tomography has provided images showing how the gas moves ( or flows ) between and around the stars .",
    "moreover , tomography of time - resolved spectra has been used to determine observational measurements of the mass transfer rate in these binaries and to confirm the rates derived with the aid of the spectrum synthesis code @xcite .",
    "this derived rate is equal to the initial mass loss rate at the onset of roche lobe overflow since the donor star will transfer gas to its companion until the initial mass ratio has been reversed @xcite .",
    "hence , tomographic images of interacting binaries at various evolutionary stages yield important clues about the life cycles of interacting binaries .",
    "the early to late evolutionary stages of interacting binaries have been studied through spectroscopic analysis , calculation of synthetic spectra , and with both 2d and 3d tomography ( e.g. , see @xcite ) .",
    "two - dimensional tomography has provided images of : ( 1 ) accretion disks around the mass gaining star in the long - period algols , cvs , nova - likes , x - ray binaries , and gamma - ray binaries ; ( 2 ) gas streams and gas flowing along magnetic field lines in the magnetic cvs ; ( 3 ) a combination of keplerian disks , gas streams flowing along the predicted gravitational path , shock regions where the stream and disk interact , chromospheres , and other magnetic structures in algol binaries ; ( 4 ) regions where the gas slows down after circling the mass gainer in direct - impact systems ( e.g. , algol , @xmath1 per ) ; and ( 5 ) asymmetric accretion disks that maintain their asymmetry on long timescales ( e.g. , tt hya ) . for a summary of the 2d tomography , see @xcite .",
    "three - dimensional doppler tomography was introduced using the radioastronomical approach ( ra ) developed by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "a summary of the important factors in the realization of 3d tomography is given in @xcite .",
    "to date , the 3d ra technique has been applied to only four systems : three algol - type eclipsing binaries ( u crb , rs vul , and now @xmath1 per ) and the x - ray binary cyg x-1 .",
    "the first 3d tomograms for the entire class of interacting binaries were created by @xcite using the u crb alternating algol system , which displays disklike emission in the tomogram at some epochs and streamlike emission at other epochs .",
    "the 3d tomograms of the disk and stream states of u crb were described by @xcite and compared to rs vul by @xcite .",
    "a prominent gas stream was also discovered in the 2d and 3d images of cyg x-1 @xcite .",
    "the 3d images illustrate the distribution of gas flows in the orbital plane and beyond that plane , and confirm the range and complexity of the emission sources in these binaries : from accretion disks and gas streams , to shock regions and magnetic structures . additional information provided by 3d tomography",
    "includes evidence that ( 6 ) prominent and extensive gas flows exist beyond the central plane of the binary in the @xmath5 direction ( e.g. , u crb , rs vul ) ; ( 7 ) the accretion disk may precess or may be tilted relative to the central plane ( e.g. , u crb ) ; and ( 8) loop prominences and coronal mass ejections associated with the magnetic field of the donor star also contribute to the gas flows ( e.g. , rs vul ) . these results were summarized by @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we continue our exploration of 3d tomography by comparing two magnetically - active systems : @xmath1 per ( algol ) and rs vul .",
    "specifically , we have 1 ) identified the features in the 3d images and related them to those seen in the 2d tomograms ; 2 ) compared the 3d tomogram of @xmath1 per with those of rs vul derived earlier ; and 3 ) provided a physical interpretation of these features .",
    "the system parameters are described in section 2 , the 2d tomograms are reviewed in section 3 , the 3d tomograms are described in section 4 , a model for @xmath1 per and rs vul based on the 3d images is given in section 5 , and the conclusions are stated in section 6 .",
    "@xmath1 per ( algol ) is the prototype of the algol - type binaries .",
    "it is the brightest and nearest eclipsing binary ( d=29 pc ) , and one of the most extensively studied objects in the sky at all wavelengths .",
    "it contains a partially eclipsing binary , with a tertiary in a 1.86 year orbit about the binary ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the system consists of a b8v primary , a k2iv secondary , and an f1v tertiary @xcite .",
    "@xmath1 per is a short - period algol ( @xmath6 = 2.8673 days ; @xcite ) with a mass ratio , @xmath7=0.22 @xmath8 @xcite and an orbital inclination of 81.4@xmath9 @xcite .",
    "other system properties include : @xmath10 = 3.7@xmath11 @xmath12 , @xmath13 = 0.81 @xmath14 @xmath12 , @xmath15 = 2.90 @xmath16 @xmath17 , @xmath18 = 3.5 @xmath19 @xmath17 @xcite , systemic velocity @xmath20= 3.8 km s@xmath4 @xcite , and velocity semi - amplitude @xmath21 = 44.0 @xmath22 km s@xmath4 @xcite .",
    "@xcite used observations from the chara interferometer to determine new masses , radii and orbital properties of @xmath1 per that are consistent with the parameters derived earlier .",
    "the properties of @xmath1 per are compared with those of rs vul in table 1 ; see @xcite for the rs vul references .",
    "one notable difference is that rs vul contains a g1 secondary compared to the k2 mass loser in @xmath1 per .",
    "figure 1 also shows the similarities between the roche geometries of the two binaries .",
    "both binaries have similar mass ratios and the @xmath15/@xmath18 ratio is @xmath23 for both systems even though the stars in rs vul are larger than those in algol , hence these binaries are expected to have similar accretion structures .",
    "magnetic activity associated with algol secondaries is well known ( e.g. , @xcite ) , and both @xmath1 per and rs vul contain late - type magnetically - active secondaries .",
    "@xmath1 per is a strong radio and x - ray source @xcite , and its cool secondary star is the dominant source of the emission at those wavelengths , characteristic of gyrosynchrotron radiation @xcite .",
    "radio emission from rs vul was detected with a flux density of 0.26 mjy at 5 ghz @xcite compared to flux densities as high as 0.3 mjy at 2.3 ghz and 1.2 mjy at 8.3 ghz for @xmath1 per @xcite .",
    "rs vul also has an x - ray luminosity of @xmath24 erg s@xmath4 @xcite , that is about half of algol s luminosity .",
    "so , the magnetic field of algol may be more the active than that of rs vul .",
    "hence a direct comparison between the 3d tomography and the new radio image should be interesting .",

    "the spectra were obtained at closely spaced positions around the entire orbit of the binary , and all of the spectra used with the tomography procedure were obtained at phases outside of primary eclipse to exclude any contributions from the rossiter - mclaughlin effect . since the observed spectra are dominated by the spectrum of the b8 mass gaining star , difference spectra were calculated by subtracting theoretical photospheric spectra from the observed spectra ( see @xcite for details ) .",

    "the velocity images show the center of mass at @xmath32 , while the secondary star is placed at the velocity corresponding to its velocity semi - amplitude .",
    "in the tomograms , the brightest sources are in deep red and the faintest in blue .",
    "the first 2d tomogram of @xmath1 per , based on 1976/77 spectra , was created by @xcite .",
    "that tomogram is similar to those derived from spectra collected in 1992 and again in 1994 , more than 16 years later .",
    "the 1976/77 trailed spectra of @xmath1 per displayed both single- and double - peaked emission whose orbital variations followed s - wave patterns .",
    "the sources of emission identified in the 2d tomogram were , from strongest to weakest : ( 1 ) a gas stream : the source of the single - peaked emission with velocities near the @xmath33 point ; ( 2 ) a localized region : concentrated in the region directly between the stars and along the line of centers ; ( 3 ) a sub - keplerian crescent - shaped disk - like structure : the source of the double - peaked emission ; and ( 4 ) an emission source on the velocity of the secondary star provided evidence of magnetic activity associated with that star .",
    "an independent s - wave analysis performed by @xcite found that the source of the single - peaked emission was coincident with the part of the gas stream near the @xmath33 point , while the source of the double - peaked emission was coincident with the concentrated localized region found in the 2d image .",
    "the extension from 2d to 3d tomography has provided unprecedented views of the gas flows beyond the central plane in which the stars orbit . in this work",
    ", we used the radioastronomical approach of @xcite and @xcite that was developed further by application to four binaries ( see @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite ) .",
    "a summary of the important factors in the realization of 3d tomography is given by @xcite .",
    "the basic assumptions and constraints of the 3d technique include @xcite : ( 1 ) the spectra are assumed to be broadened primarily by doppler motions ; ( 2 ) spectra with high wavelength resolution and good resolution in orbital phase ( or projections ) are essential ; ( 3 ) spectra dominated by emission lines are primarily used ; ( 4 ) the assumption that the gas is optically thin is sufficient to create a good first - order view of the binary ; ( 5 ) the orbital inclination influences the velocity resolution in the @xmath2 direction relative to those in the @xmath34 and @xmath35 directions , hence an adjustment is needed to compensate for the stretching effect of the summarized point spread function ( spsf ) in the @xmath2 direction @xcite ; ( 6 ) the transformation of the emission intensity from velocity space to coordinate cartesian space is very complicated and it has not yet been solved even for 2d images . the ra technique creates 3d velocity maps of the gas intensity and it is an efficient method of processing the image in the case when only a limited number of spectra are available .",
    "the 3d tomogram of @xmath1 per was constructed from the same h@xmath0 spectra from 1992 october that were used to produce the 2d doppler tomogram ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the 3d image was calculated with dimensions @xmath36 for values ranging from -800 to + 800 km  s@xmath4 , with intensities normalized to permit a comparison between slices .",
    "the velocity resolution of the reconstructed 3d image depends on the number of projections ( i.e. , number of spectra ) and their distribution in orbital phase ; while the orbital inclination influences the ratio of the resolutions in the @xmath34 , @xmath35 , and @xmath2 directions .",
    "the 4.3 km  s@xmath4 dispersion is high and certainly good enough to permit an optimal resolution of the 3d image since the dispersion plays a smaller role in setting the resolution of the image compared to the constraints set by the orbital inclination .",
    "figure 2 shows the comparison between the observed spectra of @xmath1 per and those computed from the reconstructed 3d tomograms .",
    "this figure was used to examine the quality of the reconstructed 3d image produced by the ra method and it shows the trailed spectrograms in which the radial velocity , @xmath37 is plotted versus orbital phase .",
    "the observed spectra are displayed in the left frames and the spectra computed from the 3d tomograms are displayed in the middle frames .",
    "two s - wave patterns are noticeable in the observed and computed spectra corresponding to a broad emission component and a narrow emission component .",
    "the overall agreement between the observed and computed spectra is very good .",
    "the quality of the fit is shown in the right frame of figure 2 , which displays the relative chi - square statistic , @xmath38 , versus orbital phase . here",
    ", @xmath39 is normalized to the critical value of @xmath40 , which corresponds to the largest acceptable value of @xmath39 at the 99% confidence level and demonstrates the quality of the calculated values of @xmath39 .",
    "figure 2 shows that @xmath39 was less than 30% of the critical value at most orbital phases and it was only as high as 50% of the critical value over a narrow phase range from 0.15 to 0.20 , perhaps because the 3d code assumes that the gas is optically thin when it might be optically thick at these phases . since @xmath39 was much lower than the critical value the 3d reconstruction provides a good match to the data .",
    "the 3d tomogram of @xmath1 per is displayed in figure 3 as fifteen slices in the ( @xmath34,@xmath35 ) plane from @xmath2 = @xmath41 km  s@xmath4 to @xmath42 km  s@xmath4 , at intervals of @xmath43 km  s@xmath4 .",
    "two additional slices in the ( @xmath35,@xmath2 ) direction are shown in the bottom frames .",
    "figure 3 shows that there are usually relatively small changes in the distribution of gas velocities between slices for a @xmath2 grid spacing of @xmath43 km  s@xmath4 .",
    "the most interesting representative slices in the 3d tomograms of @xmath1 per and rs vul are compared in figure 4 ; for comparison , the full set of slices in the 3d tomogram of rs vul can be found in @xcite .",
    "since the orbital inclination of @xmath1 per is high ( @xmath25 = 81.4@xmath44 ) , the velocity resolutions in the @xmath34 and @xmath35 directions will be better than the resolution in the @xmath2 direction .",
    "the resolution in the @xmath2 direction is the same as that in the other directions only for an inclination of 45@xmath44 , and degrades as the inclination increases toward 90@xmath44 .",
    "consequently , the 3d tomogram of @xmath1 per was restored with a resolution of 40 km  s@xmath4 in the @xmath34 and @xmath35 directions and 180 km  s@xmath4 in the @xmath2 direction , corresponding to a spsf half power beam width ( hpbw ) of @xmath45 in units of km  s@xmath4 . in order to adjust for the artificial stretching effect of the spsf ,",

    "hence it should not be surprising that a cme was detected in a tomogram collected over a period of 16 days in october 1992 .",
    "rs vul was too faint to be included in that survey , so its flaring period is still unknown .",
    "the continuous radio survey of @xmath1 per at 2.3 ghz and 8.3 ghz also yielded evidence of superhump - like behavior , suggesting that the gas stream from the cool star is threaded by that star s magnetic field @xcite .",
    "this was the first detection of the superhump phenomenon in the radio regime and the first observation of superhumps in algol systems .",
    "moreover , this result suggests that the gas in the vicinity of the mass gaining star ( flowing along the path of a sub - keplerian annulus ) in @xmath1 per is threaded with a magnetic field even though this b8v star is not known to have a magnetic field .",
    "instead , the magnetic field in the annulus originates from amplification of the seed field in the magnetized material transferred from the mass losing star .",
    "since the ram pressure of the accretion flow is larger than the magnetic stress at the lagrangian point , the ionized accreting material drags the field along @xcite .",
    "the field lines are wound around the mass gaining star through the gas stream ; the field is stretched and amplified , and at some stage reconnection can occur , causing flaring and acceleration of the particles .",
    "the exception in the case of @xmath1 per is that only one star in the system has a strong magnetic field . in spite of the field reconnection in the gas around the mass gainer ,",
    "the lack of radio emission near the b8v star could be explained by the razin effect and/or plasma low - frequency cutoff when the electron density is high ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "a consequence of this superhump effect is that the circumprimary gas is expected to precess .",
    "this is interesting since @xcite used 3d doppler tomography to predict that the keplerian accretion disk in another algol - type binary , u crb , does precess .",
    "so , it is satisfying to discover that the superhump phenomenon is not restricted to the classical keplerian accretion disks found in compact binaries .",
    "the superhump result predicted by @xcite was confirmed five years later by @xcite through a global very long baseline radio interferometer array ( vlbi ) study which produced a resolved 15 ghz radio image of @xmath1 per based on observations collected in 2008 .",
    "this radio image displayed evidence of gyrosynchrotron filled - loops associated with the cool donor star , a magnetically - threaded gas stream between the stars , and asymmetric magnetic structures that were not confined to the orbital plane ; however , no radio emission was directly associated with the mass gaining star .",
    "figure 8 shows the comparison between the vlbi results and those derived from 3d doppler tomography of @xmath1 per .",
    "the resemblance suggests that tomography is truly a powerful tool that provides information about the gas flows that is consistent with the radio image of the binary , at least in the case of @xmath1 per .",
    "our 3d results confirm the @xcite results , and also provide additional information about the interactions between the two stars beyond the orbital plane .",
    "we have used time - resolved h@xmath0 spectra of two magnetically - active interacting binaries to extract information about the three - dimensional velocity distribution of the gas flows in these systems .",
    "this is the first 3d reconstruction of @xmath1 per using the radioastronomical approach .",
    "emission and absorption features detected in 2d tomograms have been confirmed in the 3d doppler tomograms of @xmath1 per and rs vul .",
    "the 3d images have revealed evidence of the mass transfer process , including the gas stream , circumprimary emission probably caused by the impact of the gas stream onto the surface of the hot mass gaining star , an absorption zone where gas has been heated to temperatures beyond the h@xmath0 regime , and a localized region where the gas that circled the mass gainer has been slowed to sub - keplerian velocities by impact with the incoming gas stream .",
    "the 3d images also display evidence of magnetic activity associated with the cool star , including evidence of loop prominences and coronal mass ejections that could not be discovered from the 2d tomograms alone .",
    "the extension from 2d to 3d images has provided a view of the gas flowing beyond the central plane defined by the orbital motions of the stars .",
    "the 3d images of @xmath1 per and rs vul have once again revealed that the gas flowing beyond the central plane is substantial since the gas achieved @xmath47 velocities as high as @xmath3155 km  s@xmath4 . specifically , the loop prominence reached maximum @xmath47 velocities of -150 to + 155 km  s@xmath4 in rs vul compared to -120 to + 120 km  s@xmath4 in @xmath1 per , and the cme reached a maximum @xmath47 velocity of + 150 km  s@xmath4 in rs vul and + 100 km  s@xmath4 in @xmath1 per . hence , the gas velocities associated with magnetic activity on the cool star in rs vul were slightly higher than those achieved by @xmath1 per . moreover , the ( @xmath34,@xmath35 ) slices showed that gas stream was more elongated in rs vul than in @xmath1 per , but not as impressive as the distinctive extended flow along the predicted path seen in the 3d image of u crb . in both systems ,",
    "the stream path may have been deflected beyond the central plane by the magnetic field of the cool star .    both the 3d h@xmath0 tomography and the vlbi radio images support an earlier prediction of the superhump phenomenon in @xmath1 per : that the gas between the stars is threaded with a magnetic field even though the hot b8v mass gaining star is not known to have a magnetic field .",
