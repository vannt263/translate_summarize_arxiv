    "influences the operation and performance of engineered systems . on the other hand , investigation of clean ,",
    "well characterized nanoscale systems is leading to new insights into these underlying physical phenomena which govern systems under stress .",
    "increases in scientific computing capacity along with the development of new experimental techniques , has recently created opportunities for progress in both theory and measurements .",
    "the surface force apparatus ( sfa ) was originally designed to study solvation forces induced by a liquid confined between parallel surfaces  @xcite .",
    "subsequently it was adapted to measure shear forces  @xcite .",
    "the sfa allows precise measurements on a microscopically thin layer of lubricant , separating atomically smooth ( typically mica ) surfaces .",
    "friction and/or adhesion associated with a single asperity contact can be precisely measured .",
    "we focus here on friction and the associated stick - slip instabilities .    in many practical instances friction",
    "involves rough materials .",
    "however , for rough surfaces it can be difficult to identify underlying mechanisms associated with complex phenomena ( e.g. irregular dynamics , and bifurcations ) . for rough materials",
    "individual asperity dynamics are _ a priori _ combined with any collective phenomena which may be associated with the population of contacts , and the population of contacts itself is necessarily time dependent .",
    "rough surface measurements are thus naturally complementary to investigations of plasticity and rheology of isolated , individual asperities . in addition , for single asperities , effects associated with interfacial materials ( e.g. lubricants ) are more easily isolated .",
    "furthermore , there is growing evidence that the frictional properties of rough surfaces even at macroscopic scales is controlled by the plastic deformation of individual contacts .",
    "indeed , experiments have recently been designed which isolate and measure the dynamics of individual asperities at a rough dry interface , subject to shear  @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we focus on dynamics of an individual lubricated asperity contact .",
    "we model the lubricant using a set of constitutive equations which generalize the shear transformation zone ( stz ) theory for amorphous , glassy materials .",
    "in addition to the stz equations , the model incorporates the effects of glassy relaxation _ via _ the introduction of a state variable related to the internal free - volume ( the additional state variable may alternatively be thought of as an out - of - equilibrium effective temperature ) .",
    "the coupled stz and free - volume dynamics were introduced previously , and shown to capture a range of experimental phenomena in glassy and granular materials  @xcite . here",
    "the constitutive equations model internal states of the lubricant . we perform a series of analytical and numerical calculations which mimic typical sfa experiments  @xcite , and investigate the stationary states , the bifurcation diagram of the transition between stick - slip and steady sliding , the nature of this transition ( i.e.  super- or sub - critical ) , the emergence of chaos , and aging of the yield stress in stop - start tests . at this stage",
    ", we primarily map out qualitative behaviors of the model .",
    "the compelling correspondence to existing experiments sets the stage for future , more detailed , quantitative comparison with data .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section ii provides a brief overview of friction and boundary lubrication .",
    "section iii describes free - volume constitutive equations and summarizes elements of stz theory .",
    "section iv contains the numerical and analytical results in scenarios representative of sfa experimental studies .",
    "finally , we conclude in section v with a discussion of our results , comparisons with experiments , and directions for continuing research .",
    "in this section we provide a brief overview of boundary lubrication .",
    "our emphasis is on novel material properties and the associated modeling challenges which arise for atomically thin , confined liquid films .",
    "note that , even for interfaces with relatively simple features , we still lack precise quantitative , predictive models for friction .",
    "a more complete overview of recent results on friction and lubrication can be found in  @xcite and references therein .    in boundary lubrication a molecularly thin film of material",
    "is confined between two parallel surfaces .",
    "the relative motion of the surfaces is mediated by the plastic deformation of the interfacial material lubricating the contact .",
    "molecularly thin films display specific properties which differ from the viscous behavior of bulk materials . among the most noteworthy of these",
    "is the development of a yield stress for thin films at sufficiently low temperatures .",
    "the changes of material properties under confinement can largely be attributed to a liquid - solid transition  @xcite . in some cases ,",
    "numerical and experimental evidence suggests layering occurs in the interfacial material  @xcite and the situation is similar to a liquid - crystal transition .",
    "that is , the material orders , and its deformation is expected to result from propagation of dislocations , or layer - over - layer sliding . in other cases , no evidence of ordering of the interfacial material is observed , and the liquid - solid transition induced by confinement enters the very large class of structural glass transitions  @xcite . in this case",
    "the material remains amorphous ( liquid - like ) , but displays solids - like properties .",
    "the emergence of a yield stress is accompanied by power - law viscosities , as well as signs of glassy aging  @xcite and anomalous response spectra  @xcite .",
    "for some lubricants , either a glassy or layering transition can be observed , depending on features such as temperature  @xcite , holding time , surface roughness  @xcite , and commensurability of the surface and the film  @xcite .",
    "consequences of solid - like ordering within the film include development of a static yield stress , and stick - slip instabilities  @xcite .",
    "boundary lubrication and the sfa experiments provide special opportunities for theory , because the interface is well characterized and precisely controlled , yet the system is large enough to display phenomena which also arise macroscopically . to date , models have primarily emphasized effects associated with ordering and interactions between the crystalline substrate and the lubricant . these aim to describe effects of layering and surface induced order and involve ( i ) simple , reduced models of non - interacting particles in an effective periodic potential induced by the surfaces  @xcite , ( ii ) ginzburg - landau functionals which account for heterogeneous ordering  @xcite , or ( iii ) motion of adsorbate layers in the periodic potential associated with a regular surface  @xcite .",
    "alternative approaches focus on internal properties of the lubricant , including contrasts between liquid and solid - like properties and glassy behavior .",
    "phenomenological rate and state friction laws have been introduced  @xcite , in which the friction depends on the instantaneous slip rate and a state variable .",
    "the state variable models the collective dependence of friction on the internal degrees of freedom of the lubricant .",
    "this approach assumes the fluctuations are sufficiently self - averaging that microscopic degrees of freedom in the boundary layer can be ignored .",
    "this simplifying assumption was inspired by a large body of work in dry friction where rate - and - state formulations  @xcite have shown to be useful to account for experimental data including stick - slip instabilities  @xcite .",
    "state variables can be motivated by experimental observations or molecular dynamics . for dry",
    "friction the state variable is related to the average lifetime of individual contacts , whereas in boundary lubrication the state variable is loosely connected to the degree of internal order in the lubricant . however , the friction laws these underlying mechanisms inspire are based more on macroscopic , thermodynamic - like criteria , than on the underlying microscopic physics at the interface .",
    "our model aims to provide a microscopically motivated description of the macroscopic forces which arise when the amorphous , interfacial lubricant is subject to shear .",
    "it relies on the assumption that the deformation of amorphous materials is controlled primarily by excluded volume effects , which dominate over fine details of molecular interactions .",
    "this is an old idea , advocated by struik in the 70 s  @xcite , and supported by striking similarities between very different amorphous systems . as a result , a relatively simple account of visco - plasticity",
    "is expected to hold for wide classes of amorphous systems . in the conclusion ,",
    "we discuss how the equations we study here may account for the behavior of not only lubricants , but also sheared granular materials  @xcite .    for the theorist",
    ", boundary lubrication has some special , simplifying features which in many respects make it an ideal template to study plasticity of amorphous materials .",
    "the interfacial lubricant layer is sufficiently thin that certain bulk phenomena , such as strain localization , appear to be avoided . as a consequence boundary lubrication is , in fact , one of the few experimental setups where _ homogeneous _ constitutive equations can be directly tested .",
    "in contrast , for glassy bulk materials deformation organizes in shear bands , usually a few particle diameters thick , and the strain - rate measured in an experiment averages over a non - uniform field .",
    "the origin of strain localization is poorly understood , but clearly a more complete understanding of simple homogeneous flows must be established first .",
    "no shear banding is expected to occur in nano - confined films because the deformation is already confined at scales equal to or smaller than that which would be expected for the shear band .",
    "the sfa experimental setup resembles closely the sheared strip used in recent numerical studies of relaxation in glasses  @xcite .",
    "there are , however , several persistent challenges associated with the sfa .",
    "firstly , an astonishingly wide range of phenomena have been observed in this system for different lubricants under different conditions .",
    "the range of behaviors remains a puzzle which is difficult to piece together in the absence of a systematic theory that clearly captures the most basic observations .",
    "the variability of experimental observations might be attributed to inherent difficulties in the preparation of samples of any glassy material , due to the effects of aging . certainly capturing the full spectrum of properties",
    "is a long term target for theoretical models .",
    "secondly , it is difficult to increase the stiffness of the apparatus beyond @xmath0  @xcite .",
    "a salient feature of boundary lubrication , which directly results from this finite stiffness , is the emergence of stick - slip instabilities at low velocity  @xcite . in the most dramatic cases , the transition to stick - slip",
    "is accompanied by chaotic behavior  @xcite . the main consequence of the stick - slip instability ( and of the finite scanning length of the experimental apparatus ) , is that the sfa can provide stationary data only for limited ranges of strain - rates .",
    "thus for a wide range of parameters , information about the interfacial material can be gathered only through the observation of instabilities and transient dynamics .",
    "therefore , it is essential to treat this finite stiffness explicitly in any theoretical approach . ultimately , rather than hampering our understanding of structural glasses , stick - slip instabilities and transient dynamics provide us much richer data than simple stationary states .",
    "these instabilities may help clarify important , general issues associated with the out - of - equilibrium properties of structural glasses .",
    "the model we study in this paper is an intermediate statistical theory recently proposed  @xcite for sheared structural glasses . here",
    "`` intermediate '' refers to the fact our model falls between the thermodynamic - like , phenomenological rate and state descriptions which have been proposed for friction at dry and lubricated interfaces , and an atomistic statistical mechanical description of the lubricant , which takes into account detailed microscopic , molecular interactions .",
    "the model begins with shear transformation zone ( stz ) theory  @xcite , which was inspired by molecular dynamics simulations of fracture in amorphous materials , and which provides a microstructural description of shear - induced rearrangements  @xcite .",
    "stz theory accounts for the emergence of a yield stress in amorphous materials through introduction of state variables characterizing the anisotropy of structural arrangements .",
    "drawing on earlier approaches to describing creep in metallic alloys  @xcite , stz theory models local shear rearrangements as activated processes , controlled by local density fluctuations .",
    "this leads to the introduction of free - volume activation factors , in the spirit of early theories of the glass transition  @xcite .    in  @xcite and subsequent works",
    "@xcite , it was noted that previous approaches treat free - volume as a fixed parameter , although it clearly varies as the material dilates or contracts . in granular materials , for example , density relaxations",
    "have been observed and precisely characterized experimentally  @xcite , inspiring several models of slow relaxations  @xcite .",
    "dilatancy in granular material is also involved in the definition of frictional properties and stick - slip transitions  @xcite .",
    "slow relaxation of volume or enthalpy are ubiquitous features accompanying the glass transition  @xcite .",
    "we expect more explicit modeling of the time - dependence of density fluctuations may capture the emergence of a wide range of glassy properties near a jamming transition .",
    "the constitutive equations introduced in @xcite were thus developed to address the question : how much glassy phenomenology can be captured by the simplest account of free - volume dynamics , coupled to the dynamics of shear transformation zones ?",
    "previously it was shown that free - volume dynamics suffices to characterize aging and power law rheologies , while the dynamics of shear transformation zones are required to account for the emergence of a yield stress  @xcite . in transient regimes ,",
    "both processes may interact and contribute to rheological properties .",
    "furthermore , chaotic behavior has been observed in the sfa close to the stick - slip instability  @xcite , and it is known in over - damped frictional equations , that two or more state variables are necessary to understand the occurrence of chaos . here , we did not invoke an _ ad hoc _ theory with multiple state variables @xcite , by were led to it by the underlying physical mechanisms already associated with other , relevant experimental observations .",
    "moreover , as chaos is difficult to characterize experimentally , significant insight is provided when observations are supplemented with theoretical models , to guide measurements and analysis .",
    "finally , we note that it is not _ a priori _ necessary to identify the additional state variable as a free - volume .",
    "it was previously noted by falk and langer that free - volume was related to the notion of edwards temperature  @xcite . as noted later  @xcite , the essential feature that free - volume dynamics captures is the existence of an intensive quantity which measures internal disorder , and which evolves as the system orders or is driven away from equilibrium .",
    "alternative approaches characterize the internal state in terms of an effective temperature  @xcite .",
    "the similarity between free - volume and a temperature results from the fact that , in hard - sphere materials at constant pressure , the dominant contribution to the energy of a subset of molecules is enthalpy . in this case ,",
    "local energy and density fluctuations are directly correlated .",
    "note finally , that the concept of edwards temperature is likely to be related to effective temperatures arising in weak versions of the fluctuation - dissipation theorem  @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we use free - volume terminology , and refer the reader to  @xcite where the relation between free - volume and effective temperature is discussed in more detail .",
    "our presentation of the model is broken down into four steps : ( i ) preliminaries associated with the sfa , explicitly accounting for the finite stiffness , ( ii ) stz theory , ( iii ) free volume equations , and ( iv ) rescaling to obtain dimensionless equations .",
    "the equations in sections ( ii - iv ) have been presented elsewhere , but we include their derivation for the sake of completeness .",
    "we refer the reader to  @xcite and  @xcite for more detailed discussions of the underlying assumptions .",
    "a primitive model of the sfa consists of a single slider block , pulled along a surface by a spring of stiffness @xmath1 .",
    "the opposite end of the spring advances at a prescribed velocity @xmath2 . letting @xmath3 denote the displacement of the block relative to the stationary surface , the spring exerts a force @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is time measured from some initial time @xmath6 when @xmath7 .",
    "the block is subject to both the pulling force from the spring and frictional resistance at the surface .",
    "modeling the sfa as a single slider assumes that the sliding surface is sufficiently small , rigid , and uniform and that friction at the contact is sufficiently self - averaging that slip occurs uniformly across the interface .    assuming the thickness @xmath8 of the interface remains constant , the motion of the slider is related to the rate of shear deformation @xmath9 of the interfacial material by , @xmath10 .",
    "if the area @xmath11 of the contact is constant , the shear stress exerted by the slider on the interfacial material can be written , @xmath12 . furthermore",
    ", for the experiments we consider , the friction is sufficiently strong that the motion is overdamped , and inertial forces associated with the nonzero mass of the slider can be neglected .",
    "this leads to an equation of motion for the stress : @xmath13 with , @xmath14 , and @xmath15 .",
    "the motion @xmath16 of the slider follows from the solution to ( 1 ) , which depends on how the strain - rate @xmath9 is related to shear stress @xmath17 and the internal state variables .",
    "we next define the constitutive equations which couple free - volume and stz dynamics .",
    "later we restrict our discussion to subsets and ( linearized ) simplifications of these equations to isolate effects associated with distinct state variables and/or nonlinearities , and to illustrate phenomena which require a larger number of state variables to be resolved .",
    "stz theory is based on the idea that the macroscopic deformation of an amorphous material results from localized rearrangements involving cooperative molecular motion at mesoscopic scales  @xcite .",
    "the loci of such rearrangements are called shear transformation zones , and the internal state of the system is characterized by their number density . in its simplest form ,",
    "stz theory involves only two types of zones ( labeled + `` and - '' , with number density @xmath18 and @xmath19 , respectively ) oriented along the principal axes of the shear stress .",
    "zones of each types transform into one another during an elementary shear .",
    "the average strain rate @xmath20 is given by @xmath21 here @xmath20 averages over the populations of zones , @xmath22 , that reorient with probabilities @xmath23 , respectively .",
    "the important insight falk and langer contributed to previous stz theories was to treat the populations densities @xmath22 as state variables , and propose equations of motion for the populations .",
    "these take the following form  @xcite : @xmath24 the first two terms on the right hand side account for exchanges between the populations of stz s due to mesoscopic rearrangements , while the last term introduces a coupling with the mean flow , through creation of stz s at rate @xmath25 , and annihilation at rate @xmath26 .",
    "the equations describe how shear deformations induce small displacements of the molecules , hence creating and destroying shear transformation zones . in this framework ,",
    "the emergence of a yield stress in amorphous solids at low temperature is associated with the mobilization of zones when stress is applied .      in the original formulation of stz theory ,",
    "the rates were estimated to be nonlinear functions of stress .",
    "derivation of the rates were based on free - volume activation , as developed by cohen , turnbull and coworkers to understand the phenomenology of the glass transition  @xcite .",
    "specifically , the rates @xmath23 were estimated to be of the form @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is a stress - dependent activation volume , and @xmath29 is a material dependent constant .",
    "the detailed formulation of transformation rates @xmath23 is not essential to capture the stz mechanism for jamming . instead , a first order approximation for the stress dependence of the rates @xmath23 is sufficient  @xcite .",
    "however , for hard - sphere systems , the free - volume @xmath29 is directly related to the density .",
    "there is no reason to believe that it should take a fixed value as a function of pressure and temperature . on the contrary",
    ", it is a dynamical quantity which evolves as the material dilates or contracts .",
    "this observation naturally leads to dynamical equations for the free - volume , written in analogy with equations of motion for the populations @xmath22  @xcite . while free - volume accounts for the existence of disorder in molecular packing , the difference in stz densities describe its anisotropy .",
    "activation factors depends both on free - volume and stress fluctuations . assuming these effects",
    "are uncorrelated , we express the rates as : @xmath30\\,\\exp\\left[\\pm{\\sigma\\over\\bar\\mu}\\right ] \\quad.\\ ] ] an elementary shear rearrangement takes a `` + '' oriented zone to a `` - '' oriented zone , or vice versa , and occurs if sufficient free - volume ( large than @xmath28 ) is available , and if the virtual work of shear forces promotes the transition in the @xmath31 direction .",
    "the variable @xmath32 is here a scale of forces ( not to be confused with the elastic modulus @xmath33 ) which may depend on temperature , and governs stress activation factors .",
    "note that the introduction of backward and forward jumps is an old idea , already present in eyring s theory of viscous liquids  @xcite or in spaepen s approach to creep in metallic glasses  @xcite .",
    "the equation of motion for @xmath29 is given by @xmath34 + { \\cal a}_v\\,\\sigma\\,\\dot\\gamma\\ \\quad.\\ ] ] here free - volume dynamics involve two competing mechanisms : ( i ) activated elementary compaction which increase the density , and ( ii ) the transfer of macroscopic work into enthalpy , which dilates the material .",
    "the parameter @xmath35 specifies how efficiently the work of external forces is used in dilatancy .",
    "the parameter @xmath36 is an update frequency , which should be of the same order as @xmath37 ; the activation volume @xmath38 may differ from @xmath28 , because the two elementary rearrangements ( shear and compaction ) involve different relative motion of the molecules , hence different reactional pathways .",
    "the ratio @xmath39 is an essential parameter of the theory , and is expected to depend on the shape of the molecules .",
    "the equations described here correspond to the low temperature limit of a more general set of equations for the dynamics of a disorder temperature  @xcite .",
    "we will restrict our current discussion to this free - volume formulation . as we will show",
    ", it captures a wide range of phenomena observed experimentally .      for the constitutive equations defined above ( equations  ( [ eqn : gammadot ] )  ( [ eqn : npm ] )  ( [ eqn : vf ] ) )",
    ", it is convenient to introduce reduced variables  @xcite , @xmath40 along with the rescaled parameters , @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 , and @xmath45 .",
    "this change of variables leads to the following set of equations : @xmath46\\ , \\left(\\lambda\\,\\sinh\\left({\\sigma\\over\\bar\\mu}\\right)-\\delta\\,\\cosh\\left({\\sigma\\over\\bar\\mu}\\right)\\right)\\\\ \\label{eqn : stzdil:2 } \\dot\\delta&=&{\\dot\\gamma\\over\\epsilon_0}\\,\\left(1-{\\sigma\\over\\mu_0}\\,\\delta\\right)\\\\ \\label{eqn : stzdil:3 } \\dot\\lambda&=&{\\sigma\\,\\dot\\gamma\\over\\mu_0\\,\\epsilon_0}\\,\\left(1-\\lambda\\right)\\\\ \\label{eqn : stzdil:4 } \\dot\\chi & = & -e_1 \\exp\\left[-{\\kappa\\over\\chi}\\right]+\\alpha\\sigma\\dot\\gamma\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] equations  ( [ eqn : stzdil:1 ] ) ,  ( [ eqn : stzdil:2 ] ) , and  ( [ eqn : stzdil:3 ] )  free - volume @xmath47 in ( [ eqn : stzdil:4 ] ) being held constant  are almost identical to the original formulation of stz theory by falk and langer  @xcite . the variable @xmath48 accounts for the total density of stz s .",
    "the steady state value @xmath49 is a stable fixed point . in stz theory",
    ", @xmath48 differs from @xmath50 only in the initial transient , and its initial value is expected to depend on the type of annealing performed during the creation of a glass from a high temperature liquid .",
    "here we are not concerned with transient features associated with these annealing - dependent initial values of @xmath48 , and will assume @xmath49 throughout .",
    "this eliminates equation  ( [ eqn : stzdil:3 ] ) .",
    "the variable @xmath51 , is a normalized difference @xmath52 and @xmath53 stz densities .",
    "it accounts for the anisotropy of the molecular structure . for",
    "a fixed applied stress @xmath17 ( and fixed free - volume , @xmath47 ) , equations  ( [ eqn : stzdil:1 ] ) and  ( [ eqn : stzdil:2 ] ) were shown previously to account for a transition between an elastic regime ( jamming ) and a visco plastic regime ( flowing ) .",
    "the transition occurs at a yield stress , @xmath54 , satisfying @xmath55    the variable @xmath47 is a normalized free - volume , which accounts for the existence of disorder in the molecular structure .",
    "its dynamics , determined by equation  ( [ eqn : stzdil:4 ] ) , couples with equations  ( [ eqn : stzdil:1 ] ) and  ( [ eqn : stzdil:2 ] ) only as far as @xmath47 appears in the prefactor of equation  ( [ eqn : stzdil:1 ] ) , setting the time scale of elementary shear events .    at a fixed applied stress @xmath17 , equation  ( [ eqn : stzdil:1 ] ) ,  ( [ eqn : stzdil:2 ] ) and  ( [ eqn : stzdil:4 ] ) account for plastic deformation resulting from the coupled dynamics of @xmath51 and @xmath47 .",

    "it captures most of the phenomenology accompanying the stick - slip instability , and allows for interesting analytical calculations .    throughout this paper",
    ", we will use these three sets of equations the full , coupled system of equations including stz and free - volume effects , the nonlinear equations describing free volume dynamics only , and the linearized version of the free - volume equations in order to clarify the consequences of our assumptions and the role of the different state variables .",
    "the questions raised are : what behavior is already captured by free - volume dynamics , in the stress - linear version ( equations  ( [ eqn : vflin:1]-[eqn : vflin:2 ] ) ) ? what is the importance of activation factors , and the non - linear dependence of strain - rate versus stress ( equations  ( [ eqn : vf:1]-[eqn : vf:2 ] ) ) ?",
    "what are the expected consequences of the interaction between several internal state variables , as modeled by equations  ( [ eqn : stzdil:1 ] ) ,  ( [ eqn : stzdil:2 ] ) and ,  ( [ eqn : stzdil:4 ] ) ?",

    "most of our investigation focuses on the equations governing free - volume dynamics , either in their non - linear form  ( [ eqn : vf:1]-[eqn : vf:2 ] ) or in their linear form  ( [ eqn : vflin:1]-[eqn : vflin:2 ] ) .",
    "we study ( i ) stress versus strain rate relations in steady sliding , ( ii ) transient dynamics upon start - up , and ( iii ) the transitions to stick - slip at low velocities . in the last part of our work , we focus on the existence of",
    "( iv ) chaotic regimes of stick - slip . in order to observe chaos ,",
    "we need the full ( three - dimensional ) set of non - linear equations  ( [ eqn : stzdil:1]-[eqn : stzdil:4 ] ) .",
    "the first step in characterizing the behavior of sheared materials is , of course , the steady state relation between stress and strain rate . in boundary lubrication and single asperity friction",
    ", it has been observed that , at low velocities , the friction force is weakly velocity weakening .",
    "this weak dependence is reminiscent of the original observations by dieterich  @xcite in the case of dry surfaces , where a logarithmic dependence can be assumed with a reasonable degree of confidence . in boundary lubrication and single asperity friction",
    "there is insufficient data to conclusively determine whether the steady state relation between force and velocity is logarithmic , power law , or a combination of the two  @xcite .",
    "below we calculate the stress vs. strain rate relationship in order of increasing model complexity , beginning with the linearized free - volume equations , followed by the nonlinear free volume equations , and finally for the complete model , including stz s .      in the stress - linear version of our model ( equations  ( [ eqn : vflin:1 ] ) and  ( [ eqn : vflin:2 ] ) )",
    "the ratio between stress and strain rate determines a viscosity , @xmath59 which is a simple function of the free - volume @xmath47 .",
    "initially , we take the limit of infinite stiffness for the experimental apparatus , so that , from equation  ( [ eqn : stress ] ) , @xmath60 .",

    "this instability is not related to stick - slip , since it occurs for any value of the stiffness .",
    "it indicates that at large shear rates , the material can not dissipate the work of external forces , and is driven towards a highly disordered state .",
    "situations when @xmath64 are by definition transient : the material does not reach a steady state . instead @xmath47 diverges .    interpreting @xmath47 as a free - volume",
    ", this divergence may correspond to an opening of the interface , and possible loss of contact between the surfaces .",
    "in typical experiments , if such high shear rates are applied , the divergence of @xmath47 would be _ a priori _ limited by the scanning length of the experimental device .",
    "it is intriguing , however , that opening modes at large shear rates are observed experimentally  @xcite .",
    "they have not been characterized in the literature because they are usually viewed as experimental technicalities which limit the range of accessible driving velocities .",

    "the location of the transition to stick - slip , its dependence on compliance , and the type of transitions to stick - slip are important predictions of our model that present opportunities for more detailed comparisons with experimental data .",
    "drummond and israelachvili  @xcite have been able to study transition to stick - slip for a few values of the compliance over a limited range .",
    "we hope this initial , exploratory study will be followed by a more complete set measurements to compare with our predictions .",
    "recent experimental results by gourdon and israelachvili  @xcite have focused on the temperature and pressure dependence of the transition to stick - slip . while these variables are more accessible experimentally than compliance , they present greater challenges for theory , and can not be addressed directly here because temperature and pressure do not appear explicitly in the constitutive laws we consider .",
    "however , a recent derivation of similar equations  @xcite provides new theoretical insights for temperature and pressure dependence , suggesting future opportunities to extend our current analysis in this direction .",
    "a quantity which arose in several contexts throughout this paper was the critical strain rate @xmath67 , beyond which the value of @xmath47 can not reach steady state . in our equations , above @xmath67 , @xmath47 diverges with time , because the internal ( bounded transition rate ) relaxation dynamics can not keep pace with the rate energy is added to the system . while an actual divergence of @xmath47 may be impeded by various physical mechanisms ( which we did not attempt to incorporate ) , we believe that the existence of a change of behavior at some high strain rate is physically meaningful , and likely to be an important property that it is closely related to the existence of a latency time in stop - start tests . because transformation rates are bounded , at high strain rates , the underlying state variable is expected to decouple from the relation between stress and strain rates .",
    "this decoupling and has several consequences : ( i ) since the shear rate is only weakly dependent on state variables , and since it is an increasing function of the stress , velocity strenghening behavior emerges .",
    "( ii ) the state variable is hidden , its value can not be deduced from the relation between stress and strain rate , and measurements of apparent steady relationships between stress and strain rate may not correspond to a true steady state .",
    "( iii ) the hidden value of the state variable depends on the strain .",
    "( iv ) when the deformation is interrupted , the state variable requires some time before it reaches a sufficiently low value for it to make a measurable impact that can be probed by the emergence of a transient peak ( i.e. a stiction spike ) in stress . in this case",
    ", the latency time becomes a function of the overall strain .",
    "if a high strain rate fixed point is reached by the state variable , this dependence disappears , and the latency time should only depend on strain rate .",
    "it would therefore be particularly interesting to see whether the underlying dynamics of a state variable can be probed in experiments close to and above @xmath67 and whether it is consistent with either the emergence of a high strain rate fixed point , or with unstationary dynamics of the state of the lubricated contact .",
    "velocity strengthening has not been observed with the sfa , probably because of intrinsic limits due to the finite scan length .",
    "therefore , it is likely that the high strain rate regimes we discuss here can not be directly accessed with this experimental setup .",
    "however , velocity strengthening has been observed in numerics ,  @xcite and recently in the experiments  @xcite by bureau and coworkers .",
    "this latter experimental set - up is constructed to allow sliding over longer distances , and provides access to higher drive velocities than those available with the sfa .",
    "it thus may present opportunities to probe some phenomena which arise at high velocities .",
    "finally , we note that the constitutive equations presented here are derived from heuristic assumptions , which extend stz theory to the rearrangements occurring inside the sheared material in a lubricated contact .",
    "although our approach is phenomenological , it relies on a specific picture of the microscopic and mesoscopic mechanisms of deformation , and thus forms a bridge between macroscopic , empirical , descriptions and a fundamental understanding of the microscopic physics .",
    "the stz picture of plastic rearrangements occurring in localized zones is supported by numerical observations  @xcite .",
    "however , it would be useful to also image rearrangements in experimental situations .",
    "although the sfa provides a very well - controlled environment at the microscopic level , it seems unlikely that such atomistic imaging of the lubricant could be performed .",
    "other materials are more likely candidates for such observations .",
    "indeed , the picture of elementary rearrangements which emerges here is not limited to lubricants , but is expected to apply to a wide range of amorphous materials , in particular colloidal suspensions and granular materials .",
    "indeed , recent experiments by gollub have imaged local rearrangements in granular bead packs forming the interfacial material in friction measurements .",
    "these experiments also exhibit stick - slip at low drive velocities , and a transition to steady sliding as the drave rate is increased .",
    "@xcite a further theoretical challenge associated with these measurements arises because slip does not occur homogeneously in the material , but rather is primarily restricted to a relatively narrow dilatent region near the top of the bead pack .",
    "we expect the results presented here may extend to other types of amorphous materials , but in situations when strain localization does not preempt the application of a homogeneous description .",
    "colloids and granular materials may provide simultaneous access to macrocopic rheological properties , and microscopic imaging of elementary rearrangements .",
    "this work was supported by the w. m. keck foundation , and the nsf grant no .",

    "we present here the details of the calculation of the hopf bifurcation . for the stress - linear free - volume",
    "constitutive equations  ( [ eqn : vflin:1 ] ) and  ( [ eqn : vflin:2 ] ) .",

    "however , the calculation identifying the critical hopf point @xmath127 dividing the sub- and super - critical bifurcation lines requires more lengthy calculations and benefits from the introduction of simplifying notation .",
    "let us write the equations as : @xmath128 and perform the analysis in this more general framework .",

    "if @xmath11 is an increasing function of @xmath47 ( @xmath78 )  which also means that @xmath138 is an increasing function of @xmath81 , there is no hopf bifurcation , and the steady sliding motion is stable .",
    "if @xmath79 , @xmath11 is a decreasing function of @xmath47 ; for any @xmath81 , there is a critical value of @xmath33 where the system undergoes a hopf bifurcation : @xmath139 ^ 2 \\quad.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    in order to determine the type of hopf bifurcation ( super- or sub - critical ) , we write our non - linear system of ode s in normal form . for this purpose , we look for the linear operator @xmath140 which transforms the jacobian as : @xmath141 where the eigenvalues of the jacobian are @xmath142 .",
