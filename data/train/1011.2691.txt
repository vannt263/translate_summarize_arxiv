    "in a typical transmission spectrum of fiber bragg gratings ( fbgs ) , it is common to observe a comb of resonances on the shorter wavelength side of the bragg peak .",
    "these dips result from the resonant coupling between the forward - propagating core mode and modes that propagate backwards within the cladding of the fiber  @xcite .",
    "since modes guided in the cladding of a fiber are very sensitive to bending of the fiber as well as the surrounding environment , they are widely exploited for sensing applications . in such sensor arrangements , fbgs and long period gratings ( lpgs )",
    "are used as core to cladding mode converters  @xcite . however",
    ", conventional fbgs , in which the cross - section of the core is uniformly modified , couple light only into cladding modes of the lowest azimuthal order  @xcite . in general , coupling into higher azimuthal fiber modes can be realized by fbgs that are tilted  @xcite or have an asymmetric transverse index profile  @xcite .",
    "more elaborate in - fiber devices to achieve strong cladding mode resonances involve tapered fiber sections  @xcite or deliberately misaligned fiber splices  @xcite .    in this paper , we investigate how strong cladding mode coupling can be achieved and controlled with highly localized fbgs .",
    "such fbgs can be fabricated using focused ultrashort lasers operating in the near infrared ( nir )  @xcite . due to the nonlinear nature of the absorption process of light pulses in the femtosecond regime",
    ", highly localized refractive index profiles can be obtained in non - photosensitive materials without damaging the surrounding fiber material .",
    "the induced refractive index change is no longer confined to the photosensitive region of the fiber ( as is the case for fbgs written with ultra - violet lasers ) , but is determined solely by the focusing geometry of the ultrashort laser .",
    "both the size and position of the modifications depend heavily on the alignment and focusing of the writing beam  @xcite .",
    "highly localized fbg exhibit a pronounced coupling to cladding modes .",
    "our aim is to investigate and understand these cladding mode spectra in detail in terms of a full vectorial coupled mode theory .",
    "our work shows that excitation of cladding - modes with strong selectivity and precision is possible , detailing how the coupling behavior is determined by the fiber geometry and to which extend it can be manipulated with the cross - section of the fbg .",
    "the details of the grating inscription procedure closely follow that , which has been reported in  @xcite .",
    "a femtosecond laser ( spectra - physics , hurricane ) that delivered pulses shorter than @xmath1  fs at a wavelength of @xmath2  nm was utilized for grating inscription . a @xmath3 oil immersion objective ( @xmath4 )",
    "was used for focusing the ultrashort pulses into the core of the fiber , as well as for imaging the fiber core before and after inscription of the gratings .",
    "all experiments were performed with a standard single mode fiber ( corning smf-28e ) .",
    "the fiber was completely stripped of its polymer cladding prior to grating inscription and subsequently threaded through a glass ferrule which was placed in close proximity to the objective lens .",
    "the lens , ferrule and fiber were immersed in an index matching oil in order to minimize refraction as the pulse propagates towards the focal spot .",
    "the ferrule was positioned such that the core of the fiber was located at the focus of the laser beam and the fiber was then pulled through the ferrule at a constant velocity while the grating was inscribed . by adjusting the ferrule s location with respect to the focus of the lens , the transverse position of the modifications of the fbg could be controlled to micrometer accuracy within the fiber core .",
    "the error in the longitudinal position of the modifications was much smaller , because the fiber was pulled by an air - bearing translation stage designed for constant velocity traversals , and the repetition rate of the laser was constant .",
    "all gratings were inscribed in smf-28e fibers and are @xmath5  mm long . except where stated otherwise , the gratings have a period @xmath6  m that reflects 1.5  m light in the second order .    , establishing the coordinate system , where @xmath7 points along the fiber and @xmath8 and @xmath9 are perpendicular to the fiber axis . ]",
    "pulse energies between @xmath10 and @xmath11  nj were used , which provided enough irradiance within the focal volume to cause a micro - explosion in the fiber , leaving behind a micro - void and hence forming a type ii - ir point - by - point ( pbp ) fbg  @xcite .",
    "the micro - voids are surrounded by a compressed region of increased refractive index . in previous work",
    ", we have demonstrated that the net effective refractive index change is negative , although this is not significant in the present work  @xcite .",
    "microscope images of the grating modifications taken from the top ( a ) and side ( b ) views are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : mod_sketch ] . the micro - void regions , which are highlighted in fig .  [ fig : mod_sketch ] , measure 0.4  min width by 1.9  min height .",
    "they are enclosed by a densified type i  shell of width approximately 1  mand height 8  m , where the index is slightly increased .",
    "the modifications are not necessarily centered , thus having an offsets of @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "the measurement of the transmission and reflection properties was carried out with a swept wavelength system ( sws ) ( jds uniphase ) , that consisted of a narrow line - width external cavity laser diode .",
    "the probing wavelength of the laser diode can be continuously swept from @xmath14  to  @xmath15  nm with a resolution of @xmath16 pm . a typical transmission spectrum is shown in fig .  [ fig : firstpeaks ] .",
    "in contrast to fbgs written with conventional techniques , the cladding mode structure is very pronounced : the reflectivity of core light into cladding modes is higher than @xmath17  percent , even at wavelengths @xmath5  nm shorter than the bragg wavelength @xmath18  nm . for gratings at 1555  nm , we see strong resonances 35  nm below the bragg peak , limited only by the wavelength range of our measurement system .",
    "comparable cladding mode spectra can be obtained with conventional techniques only with blazed fbgs with large tilt angles , e.g. 80  @xcite , whereas our gratings are untilted .    as detailed in section [ sec : classify ] , each resonance can be attributed to the coupling of the core mode to one or more definite cladding modes characterized by their radial and azimuthal mode numbers .",
    "it can be seen that the spectrum contains three sets of resonances with distinct well - defined envelopes .",
    "we will show that the envelopes correspond to modes with even ( green dots ) or odd ( red dots ) azimuthal mode numbers .",
    ", the colored dots indicate the envelopes of resonances with he @xmath19 ( red ) , eh @xmath19 ( blue ) and he @xmath20 ( green).the lower graphs show expanded scales to illustrate the he / eh splitting of modes with high radial order @xmath21 ( lower left ) , and the existence of first - order cladding mode peaks right up to the second - order bragg peak ( lower right ) . ]",
    "close inspection reveals that many of the resonances , especially at wavelengths lower than 1530 nm ( see lower left panel of fig .  [",
    "fig : firstpeaks ] ) , actually consist of doublets ( marked by red and blue dots respectively ) .",
    "no such splitting is observed at the low order ( long wavelength ) resonances .",
    "these doublets result from the hybrid nature of the cladding guided modes , which will be discussed in detail in section [ sec : classify ] .",
    "finally , the lower right panel of fig .  [ fig : firstpeaks ] provides a striking illustration of the strength of the cladding mode coupling in these gratings .",
    "it shows the response at wavelengths longer than the second - order bragg peak at 1540  nm . a sequence of regularly - spaced pairs of resonances 12  db deep , each themselves with a recurring splitting pattern , is clearly visible .",
    "we interpret these peaks as the tail of the first - order cladding mode spectrum , and they therefore correspond to resonances many hundreds of modes below the fundamental .",
    "the actual first order bragg peak would occur in the mid - ir around 3  mand is beyond our observable range due to losses and the spectral range of our near - ir characterization setup .    in the following sections , we perform calculations to understand these types of cladding mode spectra and explain their features in precise detail .",
    "for the purpose of calculating and classifying the cladding modes we consider a standard , cylindrical step - index fiber supporting a single core - guided mode over the wavelength range of interest .",
    "the elliptical modifications introduce a small anisotropy to the core and the modes are technically birefringent , but this effect is insignificant for the cladding modes .",
    "we therefore treat the fiber as having perfect circular symmetry , with core radius @xmath22 and cladding radius @xmath23 .",
    "the refractive indices are @xmath24 , respectively .    exploiting the small difference in @xmath25 and @xmath26 ,",
    "cladding modes are most often calculated with a two - layer model consisting of a solid rod of index @xmath26 and radius @xmath23 surrounded by an air cladding with index 1 .",
    "they are further often treated in the approximation of weak - guidance or linearly polarized ( lp ) modes  @xcite .",
    "this approximation is usually sufficient for computing the position of the resonances in the spectrum @xcite , since the propagation constants of the true he and eh hybrid modes of the step index fiber differ only by a very small amount @xmath27  @xcite .",
    "it has previously been found , however , that in order to accurately calculate coupling coefficients between core and cladding modes , both these approximations must be avoided  @xcite .",
    "the core - cladding boundary influences the electric field distribution of the lower order modes especially .",
    "hence it is necessary to solve the cladding modes for the full three - layer structure  @xcite .",
    "moreover , because fiber modes of higher azimuthal order are not linearly polarized , we need a full vectorial approach  @xcite to accurately explain splittings in the cladding - mode spectra that do not appear in the lp picture .    in the remainder of the paper ,",
    "the core radius @xmath28  mand the cladding radius @xmath29 62.5  m. the refractive indices of the core , cladding and surrounding air are @xmath30 and @xmath31 respectively .",
    "modes travel in the @xmath7 direction with the propagation constant @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is the effective index .",
    "a mode is guided within the core if @xmath34 , and in the cladding if @xmath35 . to excite the system , we launch a single linearly polarized @xmath36 core mode .      in our analysis",
    ", we make extensive use of the three - layer fiber model in the form laid out by erdogan  @xcite .",
    "he adapted the full analytical solution of the three - layer treatment of tsao  @xcite , which yields all hybrid modes with the azimuthal and radial integer indices @xmath37 and @xmath21 .",
    "however , in @xcite , erdogan focused solely on cladding mode reflections of conventional fiber gratings , for which only @xmath19 resonances occur . in our work , higher order modes with @xmath38 are needed .",

    "for azimuthal number @xmath37 , the transverse field components of the he modes have predominantly a @xmath63 radial dependence , whereas the eh modes are dominated by the @xmath64 bessel function .",

    "the mode parameter @xmath68 also turns out to be very convenient for the classification of cladding modes in the three - layer fiber .",
    "however , the he / eh criterion has to be modified . for further discussion , we define the projected normalized wavevector @xmath69 which corresponds to the normalized frequency a cladding mode would have in the core region if the refraction on the core - cladding boundary is ignored . in fig .",

    "it can indeed be seen that a further intensity ring appears within the core each time there is a discontinuity in the @xmath58 plot .",

    "we now turn to the detailed explanation of the form of the cladding mode spectra , calculating the resonant wavelengths , the coupling coefficients and finally the complete transmission spectra .",
    "one of the challenges of computing fbg spectra of strong cladding mode coupling is that it usually occurs over large bandwidth ranging from 20 to several hundred nanometers .",
    "all resonances that result from the reflection of the incoming mode @xmath36 into cladding modes @xmath90 by the grating of period @xmath91 are defined by the phase matching condition @xmath92 taking all the propagation constants as positive , the upper sign holds for fbgs , and the lower sign for long period gratings . since eq .",
    "involves the wavelength implicitly through the effective indices of the modes , computing the resonance wavelengths requires solving the dispersion relation for hundreds of modes at finely discretized wavelengths . within a bandwidth of 30",
    "nm , the material dispersion of the fiber can usually be neglected as it is of the order of @xmath93 and affects both core and cladding refractive indices in a similar fashion .",

    "however , the waveguide dispersion is significant and must be accounted for .",
    "solving eq .   exactly is relatively straightforward , but considerable care is required in solving the dispersion relation   to find all the required effective indices @xmath95 at all wavelengths , since some of the eh modes appear as resonances as narrow as one part in a million .",
    "if the intention is to identify particular modes in a measured spectrum rather than precisely predict their location in advance , a more convenient approximate approach that provides additional insight is to solve the dispersion relation at the bragg wavelength @xmath96 and extrapolate the waveguide dispersion of the propagation constants using the relation  @xcite @xmath97 where @xmath98 is a mode - dependent dispersion - free constant .",
    "this relation applies for the two - layer model of a fiber in air ( @xmath99 ) in the lp approximation and the regime of high @xmath100 number ( for the cladding modes @xmath101 ) .",
    "these lp resonances represent the he / eh doublets for resonances of high radial number @xmath21 described earlier .",
