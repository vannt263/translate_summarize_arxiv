    "the wkb approximation is an asymptotic approximation technique which can be used when a system contains a large parameter ( see _ e.g. _ ) .",
    "hence , the wkb method can be used in a system where a wave propagates through a background medium which varies on some spatial scale which is much longer than the wavelength of the wave .",
    "the soho and trace satellites have recently observed mhd wave motions in the corona , _",
    "i.e. _ fast and slow magnetoacoustic waves and alfvn waves ( see reviews by ; ; @xcite ) .",
    "the coronal magnetic field plays a fundamental role in their propagation and to begin to understand this inhomogeneous magnetised environment , it is useful to look at the structure ( topology ) of the magnetic field itself .",
    "potential - field extrapolations of the coronal magnetic field can be made from photospheric magnetograms .",
    "such extrapolations show the existence of an important feature of the topology : _",
    "null points_. null points are points in the field where the magnetic field , and hence the alfvn speed , is zero .",
    "detailed investigations of the coronal magnetic field , using such potential field calculations , can be found in and",
    ".    found that for a single 2d null point , the fast magnetoacoustic wave was attracted to the null and the wave energy accumulated there .",
    "in addition , they found that the alfvn wave energy accumulated along the separatrices of the topology .",
    "they solved the 2d linearised mhd equations numerically and compared the results with a wkb approximation : the agreement was excellent . from their work and other examples",
    "( _ e.g. _ ; ; @xcite ; ) it has been clearly demonstrated that the wkb approximation can provide a vital link between analytical and numerical work , and often provides the critical insight to understanding the physical results .",
    "this paper demonstrates the methodology of how to apply the wkb approximation in linear 3d mhd .",
    "we believe that with the vast amount of 3d modelling currently being undertaken , applying this wkb technique to 3d will be very useful and beneficial to modellers in the near future .    the work undertaken by deserves special mention here .",
    "they performed numerical experiments on the effect of twisting the spine of a 3d null point , and described the resultant wave propagation towards the null .",
    "they found that when the fieldlines around the spine are perturbed in a rotationally symmetric manner , a twist wave ( essentially an alfvn wave ) propagates towards the null along the fieldlines .",
    "whilst this alfvn wave spreads out as the null is approached , a fast - mode wave focuses on the null and wraps around it .",
    "they concluded that the driving of the fast wave was likely to come from a non - linear coupling to the alfvn wave @xcite .",
    "they also compare their results with a wkb approximation and find that , for the @xmath7 fast wave , the wavefront wraps around the null point as it contracts towards it .",
    "they perform their wkb approximation in cylindrical polar coordinates and thus their resultant equations are two - dimensional ( since a simple 3d null point is essentially 2d in cylindrical coordinates ) . in contrast , we solve the wkb equations for three cartesian components , and thus we can solve for more general disturbances and more general boundary conditions .",
    "this also allows us to concentrate on the transient features that are not always apparent when only cylindrically symmetric solutions are permitted .    more recently , and have performed numerical simulations in which the spine and fan of a 3d null point are subject to rotational and shear perturbations .",
    "they found that rotations of the fan plane lead to current sheets in the location of the spine and rotations about the spine lead to current sheets in the fan .",
    "in addition , shearing perturbations lead to 3d localised current sheets focused at the null point itself .",
    "this general behaviour is in good agreement with the work presented in this paper , _",
    "i.e. _ current accumulation at certain parts of the topology .",
    "however , the primary motivation in and was to investigate current - sheet formation and reconnection rates , whereas the techniques described in this paper focus on mhd wave - mode propagation and interpretation .",
    "the propagation of fast magnetoacoustic waves in an inhomogeneous coronal plasma has been investigated by , who showed how the waves are refracted into regions of low alfvn speed . in the case of null points",
    ", the alfvn speed actually drops to zero .",
    "the paper has the following outline : in section [ sec:1 ] , the basic equations are described .",
    "section [ wkbapproximation ] details the 3d wkb approximation utilised in this paper .",
    "the results for the fast wave and alfvn waves are shown in section [ sec : fast ] and [ sec : alfven ] .",
    "the conclusions and discussion are presented in section [ conclusion ] .",

    "in fact , under the assumptions of linearisation and no gravity , it has no influence on the momentum equation and so in effect the plasma is arbitrarily compressible @xcite .",
    "we now non - dimensionalise the above equations as follows : let @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 and @xmath54 , where we let @xmath55 denote a dimensionless quantity and @xmath56 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and @xmath57 are constants with the dimensions of the variable that they are scaling .",

    "@xmath69 , and its derivatives , are considered to be the large parameters in our system .",
    "one of the difficulties associated with 3d mhd wave propagation is distinguishing between the three different wave types , _",
    "i.e. _ between the fast and slow magnetoacoustic waves and the alfvn wave . to aid us in our interpretation , we now define a new coordinate system : @xmath70 ) , where @xmath71 is our wavevector as defined above .",

    "however , for all @xmath1 the main result holds : the fast wave accumulates at the null point .    in both sections [ sub1 ] and [ sub2 ] , the fast wave , and thus the wave energy , accumulates at the null point .",
    "the fast wave can not cross the null because the alfvn speed there is zero .",
    "thus , the length scales between the leading and trailing edges of wave pulses will decrease indicating that the current ( and all other gradients ) will increase . in section [ current_fast ] , we calculated theoretical limits of the current build up and found that it was bounded by two exponentially growing functions .",
    "moreover , it was shown that for a fast wave starting at @xmath124 , @xmath195 , and for fast wave starting at @xmath160 : @xmath298 .",
    "hence , no matter how small the value of the resistivity is , if we include the dissipative term then eventually the @xmath299 term in equation ( [ 6 ] ) will become non - negligible and dissipation will become important .",
    "in addition , since @xmath282 grows exponentially in time , diffusion terms will become important in a time @xmath300 ; as found by and .",
    "this means that linear wave dissipation will be very efficient .",
    "thus , we deduce that 3d null points will be the locations of wave energy deposition and preferential heating .",

    "for the alfvn wave approaching the null point from above ( planar wave starting at @xmath124 ) the wave accumulates along the fan plane . for an alfvn wave approaching from the side ( propagation initially perpendicular to the spine ) the wave accumulates along the spine .",
    "this behaviour is in good agreement with the results of and , but the method we present here clearly illustrate why this occurs , e.g. by following the ray paths in section [ sub4 ] , it is clear why an alfvn wave generated crossing the fan plane must accumulate along the spine .    furthermore , we found an analytical solution for the alfvn wave . from this",
    "we were able to show that the alfvn wave rotates the fieldlines , the volume occupied by the wave pulse is conserved and that the associated currents build up exponentially . for a wave starting at @xmath124 , the currents build up along the fan plane , and @xmath288 and @xmath289 grow as @xmath301 and @xmath302 , respectively .",
    "thus , resistive effects will eventually become non - negligible in a time @xmath303 . for a wave starting at @xmath124 ,",
    "the value of @xmath1 determines where the preferential heating will occur : fan - plane ( @xmath2 ) , along the @xmath3axis ( @xmath4 ) or along the @xmath5axis ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "in contrast , an alfvn wave starting at @xmath278 or @xmath160 will lead to preferential heating along the spine .",
    "all of the work described here highlights the importance of understanding the magnetic topology of a system , specifically the location of the spines and fans for a 3d null point .",
    "it is at these areas where preferential heating will occur , _",
    "i.e. _ these areas are where the wave energy accumulates .",
    "in addition , it is of note that for both the fast and alfvn waves , current builds up exponentially and thus _ diffusion terms will become important in a time that depends on @xmath304_. this is all in good agreement with the 2d work of mclaughlin & hood ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "it is also useful to make an order of magnitude estimate for the quantities presented here , in order to gain a better understanding of the physical conclusions .",

    "we find that resistive effects become non - negligible in a time @xmath325seconds . for comparison , after @xmath326seconds , our wave has built up a current of @xmath327ma and has travelled a distance of @xmath328 mm .",
    "the alfvn wave is degenerate with the fast wave along the spine and so has the same estimates as above ( under identical conditions ) .",
    "the 3d wkb technique described in this project can also be easily applied to other magnetic configurations , e.g. 3d dipole , and we hope that this paper has illustrated the potential of the technique .",
    "in addition , it is possible to extend the work by dropping the cold plasma assumption .",
    "this will lead to a third root of equation ( [ f1 ] ) which will correspond to the behaviour of the slow magnetoacoustic wave .",
    "we conclude this paper with some caveats concerning the method presented here , _",
    "i.e. _ if modellers wish to compare their work with a wkb approximation , it is essentialy to know the limitations of such a method .",
    "firstly , in linear 3d mhd , we would expect a coupling between the fast and alfvn wave types due to the geometry .",
    "however , under the wkb approximation presented here , the wave sees the field as locally uniform and so there is no coupling between the wave types . to include the coupling",
    ", one needs to include the next terms in the approximation , _",
    "i.e. _ the work presented here only deals with the first - order terms of the wkb approximation .",
    "secondly , note that the work here is only strictly valid for high - frequency waves , since we took @xmath69 and hence @xmath329 to be a large parameter in the system .",
    "the extension to low frequency waves is considered in .    finally , the wkb approximation becomes degenerate at the points @xmath330 , _",
    "i.e. _ regions where the alfvn speed and sound speed are equal .",
    "thus , the wkb method in the form presented here can not be used to investigate mode conversion ( _ e.g. _ see ) and , as mentioned above , the next terms in the approximation are needed . alternatively",
    ", work is underway to overcome this degeneracy using the method developed by to match wkb solutions across the mode conversion layer ( layer where @xmath330 ) .",
    "the results of such work in 1d can be found in .",

    "<S> this paper is a demonstration of how the wkb approximation can be used to help solve the linearised 3d mhd equations . using charpit s method and a runge - kutta numerical scheme , we have demonstrated this technique for a potential 3d magnetic null point , @xmath0 . under our cold plasma assumption , </S>",
    "<S> we have considered two types of wave propagation : fast magnetoacoustic and alfvn waves . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the fast magnetoacoustic wave experiences refraction towards the magnetic null point , and that the effect of this refraction depends upon the alfvn speed profile . </S>",
    "<S> the wave , and thus the wave energy , accumulates at the null point . </S>",
    "<S> we have found that current build up is exponential and the exponent is dependent upon @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , for the fast wave there is preferential heating at the null point . for the alfvn wave , </S>",
    "<S> we find that the wave propagates along the fieldlines . for an alfvn wave generated along the fan - plane </S>",
    "<S> , the wave accumulates along the spine . for an alfvn wave generated across the spine , </S>",
    "<S> the value of @xmath1 determines where the wave accumulation will occur : fan - plane ( @xmath2 ) , along the @xmath3axis ( @xmath4 ) or along the @xmath5axis ( @xmath6 ) . </S>",
    "<S> we have shown analytically that currents build up exponentially , leading to preferential heating in these areas . </S>",
    "<S> the work described here highlights the importance of understanding the magnetic topology of the coronal magnetic field for the location of wave heating . </S>"
