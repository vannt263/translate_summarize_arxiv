    "the standard model for cosmology can be described by a small number of parameters , and relatively accurate determinations of many of those parameters are now available . recently",
    ", cosmic microwave background experiments , most notably wmap , have determined the primordial spectrum of density fluctuations down to small angular scales with excellent agreement with galaxy and cluster surveys ( bennett 2003 ; spergel 2003 ) .",
    "the overall curvature of the universe is determined to be @xmath4 within a few percent , where @xmath5 .",
    "the evolution of the universe ( past , present , and future ) also depends on the composition of matter in the universe : radiation , baryons , cold dark mater , a cosmological constant or dark energy .",
    "agreement between cmb measurements , supernovae type i data ( riess 1999 ; perlmutter 1999 ; tonry 2003 ) , and clustering data ( percival 2002 ; tegmark 2003 ) are concordant with @xmath6 approximately 2:1 . here , we are interested in the redundancies in the determination of the baryon density , @xmath7 , using both the cmb and big bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) ( walker 1991 ; sarkar 1996 ; olive , steigman , & walker 2000 ; fields & sarkar 2002 ) .    the baryon density ( or the baryon - to - photon ratio , @xmath8 ) is the sole parameter in the standard model of bbn . prior to the recent high accuracy measurements of the microwave background power spectrum , the best available method for determining the baryon density of the universe was the concordance of the bbn predictions and the observations of the light element abundances of d , 3 , 4 , and 7 .",
    "a high - confidence upper limit to the baryon density has long been available ( reeves 1976 ) from observations of local d / h abundance determinations ( giving roughly @xmath9 ) , but a reliable lower bound to @xmath3 , much less a precise value , has been problematic .",
    "observations of each of the light elements d , 4 , and 7 can be used individually to determine the value of @xmath3 .",
    "confidence in any such determination , however , relies on the concordance of the three light isotopes .",
    "likelihood analyses ( fields & olive 1996 ; fields 1996 ; hata 1997 ; fiorentini 1998 ; esposito 2000 ; cyburt , fields , & olive 2001 ; burles , nollett , & turner 2001 ) using the combined 4 , 7 and d / h observations enable one to determine a 95 % cl range of @xmath10 with a most likely value of @xmath11 corresponding to @xmath12 . however , one concern regarding the likelihood method is the relatively poor agreement between 4 and 7 on the one hand and d on the other .",
    "the former two taken alone indicate that the most likely value for @xmath13 is 2.4 , while d / h alone implies a best value of 6.1 .",
    "this discrepancy may point to new physics , but could well be due to underestimated systematic errors in the observations .",
    "recently , more weight has been given to the d / h determinations because of their excellent agreement with the cmb experiments .    in the past few years , balloon and ground - based observations have made the first observations at multipoles @xmath14 , where the sensitivity to @xmath3 lies , and determinations of @xmath3 at the 20 % level became possible ( netterfield 2002 ; abroe 2002 ; pryke 2002 ; sievers 2002 ; rubio - martin 2003 ; goldstein 2002 ; benoit 2002 ) .",
    "with wmap ( bennett 2003 ; spergel 2003 ) , the cmb - based inference of the baryon - to - photon ratio is @xmath15 , or @xmath16  a precision of 4% .",
    "this estimate is the best - fit wmap value , which is sensitive mostly to wmap alone ( primarily the first and second acoustic peaks ) but does include cbi ( sievers 2002 ) and acbar ( goldstein 2002 ) data on smaller angular scales .",
    "note , however , that there is a small and marginally significant difference between the values of @xmath3 derived by using only the wmap data or using the wmap data in combination with other observations ( spergel et al .",
    "2003 ) as shown here in figure 1 .",
    "[ fig1 ]    one can use @xmath17 as an input to bbn calculations and predict the primordial abundances of the light elements .",
    "this yields relatively precise abundances ( cyburt 2003 ) : @xmath18 because there are no measurements of 3 at very low metallicity ( i.e. , significantly below solar ) at this time , a higher burden is placed on the remaining three elements .",
    "the d / h prediction is in excellent agreement with the average of the five best determined quasar absorption system abundances ( burles & tytler 1998a , b ; omeara 2001 ; pettini & bowen 2001 ; kirkman 2003 ) which give @xmath19 ( see figure 1 ) .",
    "in contrast , the 7 prediction is rather high .",
    "the results of ryan , norris , & beers ( 1999 ) , give 7/h = @xmath20 which is a factor of 3 below the wmap value , and almost a factor of 2 below even when systematics are stretched to maximize the 7 abundance ( ryan 2000 ) .",
    "even a recent study ( bonifacio 2002 ) with temperatures based on h@xmath21 lines ( considered to give systematically high temperatures ) yields 7/h = @xmath22 .",
    "recent attempts ( coc 2004 , cyburt , fields , & olive 2004 ) to ascribe this discrepancy to systematic uncertainties in the relevant nuclear rates for 7 show that this is unlikely .",
    "of course , some of the discrepancy may be due to li depletion in the stellar atmosphere ( vauclair & charbonnel 1998 , pinsonneault 1999 , 2002 ) .",
    "finally , the predicted 4 abundance is also rather high when compared to the large body of data on 4 in extragalactic hii regions .    given the concordance of the wmap determinations with the average of the d / h determinations , is the value of @xmath3 secure , and thus , should the topic be considered closed ?",
    "there are a number of reasons that we feel that it is important to resolve the differences indicated in figure 1 .",
    "first , it is important to remember that individual cosmological parameters can not be derived independently from microwave background measurements ; the microwave background measurements constrain combinations of cosmological parameters .",
    "thus , independent constraints on individual parameters ( or , in this case , the combination of just two parameters - @xmath23 ) continue to be very important .",
    "second , the concordance of the primordial abundances of the light elements has long been regarded as a triumph of modern cosmology , and thus , regaining concordance remains an important goal . finally , there are some aspects of the @xmath3 determinations that bear further inspection .",
    "one example is the previously mentioned small difference between the value derived from wmap alone and that derived from combining in other observations .",
    "another example , also shown in figure 1 , is the fact that the error bars on the individual d / h @xmath3 determinations , in many cases , are not overlapping , and averaging the five best determined absorption systems may not be the correct way to treat the data",
    ". the dispersion in the d / h data may be a result of chemical evolution or underlying systematic uncertainties in the observations ( fields 2001 ) .",
    "thus , we feel that the problem of the concordance of the various determinations of @xmath3 is an important one , and here we will concentrate on the determination of the value of the primordial helium abundance .    unlike the other light element abundances , in order to be a useful cosmological constraint , 4 needs to be measured with a precision at the few percent level .",
    "thus , the determination of the 4 abundance has become limited by systematic uncertainties . to date",
    ", the most useful 4 abundance determinations are made by observing helium emission lines in hii regions of metal - poor dwarf galaxies .",
    "izotov & thuan ( 1998 , hereafter it98 ) assembled a sample of 45 low metallicity hii regions , observed and analyzed in a uniform manner , and derived a value of @xmath24 @xmath25 0.244 @xmath26 0.002 and 0.245 @xmath26 0.001 ( with regressions against o / h and n / h respectively ) .",
    "this value is significantly higher than the value of @xmath24 @xmath25 0.228 @xmath26 0.005 derived by pagel ( 1992 , hereafter pste ) using nearly identical analysis techniques .",
    "peimbert , peimbert , & ruiz ( 2000 , hereafter ppr00 ) have derived a very accurate helium abundance for the hii region ngc 346 in the small magellanic cloud , and from this they infer a value of @xmath24 @xmath25 0.2345 @xmath26 0.0026 .",
    "ppr00 take a fundamentally different approach to determining the electron temperature ( compared to pste and it98 ) .",
    "specifically , they use the he  i emission lines to solve for the electron temperature ( resulting in a lower temperature than indicated by the [ o  iii ] lines , in line with predictions from photoionization models ) and include the effects of estimating the amplitude of temperature fluctuations .",
    "thus , these two different results depend not only on different observations , but also on differences in the analyses of the observations . recently ,",
    "luridiana et al .",
    "( 2003 , hereafter lppc ) have analyzed spectra of five metal poor hii regions and , after considering the effects of additional physical processes ( e.g. , collisional excitation of the balmer lines ) , have produced a higher ( compared to ppr00 ) determination of y@xmath27 .",
    "as shown in figure 1 , this higher value is still significantly lower than the value derived by it98 or from the wmap observations .",
    "we are left with the conundrum in that the studies that appear to have the higher quality observations and the more complete physical analysis ( ppr00 and lppc ) arrive at a answer which is further from concordance with wmap results ( relative to it98 ) .",
    "one approach to the problem would be to assume that the cmb measurements are providing us with the correct value of @xmath7 , and then bbn allows us to calculate the corresponding value of y@xmath2 ( cyburt , fields , & olive 2002 , 2003 ) . assuming that this is correct",
    ", we may be better able to understand the systematic effects in the determination of y@xmath2 from nebular spectroscopy .    in an earlier paper , ( olive & skillman 2001 , hereafter os ) we critically examined the `` self - consistent '' approach of determining the 4 abundance used by it98 , and concluded that uncertainties were systematically underestimated , especially with regard to the treatment of underlying stellar absorption ( see also skillman , terlevich , & terlevich 1998 ) .",
    "this effect alone could be sufficient to explain the discrepancy between the it98 result and the wmap result , but it is unlikely to resolve the difference between the it98 and ppr00 studies .",
    "additionally , benjamin , skillman , & smits ( 2002 ) have presented new calculations of hei radiative transfer effects and have shown that some of the fitting formulae introduced by it98 had significant errors .    in this paper , we will attempt to better quantify the true uncertainties in the individual helium determinations in extragalactic hii regions and hopefully produce a more secure estimate of y@xmath2 .",
    "we present an update of our minimization procedure , adding in the ability to solve self - consistently for the electron temperature .",
    "the new calculations of radiative transfer effects are also incorporated into this new code .",
    "the goal of this paper is to explore different analysis methodologies and to promote particular analysis techniques in order to carefully assess the true systematic uncertainty in 4 abundance determinations .",
    "in our previous work ( os ) , in order to make calculations directly comparable to those of it98 , we used the h  i emissivities calculated by hummer & storey ( 1987 ) , the he  i emissivities calculated by smits ( 1996 ) , the collisional rates of sawey & berrington ( 1993 ) , the resulting collisional corrections calculated by kingdon & ferland ( 1995 ) , and the he  i radiative transfer model of it98 based on robbins ( 1968 ) . here ,",
    "these are replaced and combined by new calculations from benjamin , skillman , & smits ( 1999 ; 2002 ) . while the emissivity and collisional corrections presented by benjamin , skillman , & smits ( 1999 ) did not result in large changes relative to previous values ,",
    "the new radiative transfer model presented in benjamin , skillman , & smits ( 2002 ) is substantially different from that of it98 .",
    "as detailed in our previous paper , we also allow for the possibility of underlying stellar absorption .",
    "the details used in computing the helium abundance are given in the appendix .",
    "the self consistent method we employ makes use of six he emission lines : @xmath283389 , @xmath284026 , @xmath284471 , @xmath285876 , @xmath286678 , @xmath287026 .",
    "the ratio of each he  i emission line intensity to h@xmath29 is compared to the theoretical ratio and corrected for the effects of collisional excitation , fluorescence , and underlying he  i absorption . from these line ratios ,",
    "we need to determine three physical parameters , the density , @xmath30 , the optical depth , @xmath31 , and the equivalent width for underlying helium absorption , @xmath32 . in os",
    ", we had assumed an input temperature ( typically derived from [ o  iii ] emission lines ) .",
    "as pointed out in ppr00 , the temperature dependences of the he  i emissivities are exponential and can be both positive and negative , so that the relative he  i lines can provide a strong temperature diagnostic ( which will be more appropriate to the he@xmath33 zone )",
    ". thus , our new procedure allows us to solve for the temperature as we do for the other physical parameters .",
    "as described in detail in os , we use the derived he abundances @xmath34 to compute the average helium abundance , @xmath35 , |y = _ y^+ ( ) ( ) ^2 / _ 1 ( ) ^2 this is a weighted average , where the uncertainty @xmath36 is found by propagating the uncertainties in the observational quantities stemming from the observed line fluxes ( which already contains the uncertainty due to c(h@xmath29 ) ) , and the equivalent widths .    from @xmath37",
    ", we can define a @xmath38 as the deviation of the individual he abundances @xmath34 from the average , ^2 = _ ( y^+ ( ) - |y)^2 ( ) ^2 [ chi4 ] we then minimize @xmath38 , to determine @xmath39 , and @xmath31 and the temperature , @xmath40 .",
    "uncertainties in the output parameters are determined by varying the outputs until @xmath41 .",
    "the real challenge for the new code is determining the correct combination of temperature and density .",
    "while it is true , in principle , that the he  i lines can provide a strong temperature diagnostic , in practice , this requires very precise emission line fluxes to pin down the temperature to a narrow range .",
    "the difficulty comes from the fact that the three strong lines which form the backbone of the solution ( @xmath285876 , @xmath284471 , and @xmath286678 ) all have the same sense of temperature and density dependence , i.e. , f_hei = a t^b - c n_e [ tndep ] where a , b , and c are positive constants .",
    "because the three main lines ( and @xmath284026 ) all behave in similar ways , there is a natural tendency towards solutions combining either high temperatures and low densities or low temperatures and high densities .",
    "thus , if temperatures are systematically overestimated ( as is probably true if one assumes the temperature derived from the [ o  iii ] lines ) , then the solutions are forced systematically to low values of density .",
    "the fact that two of the lines ( @xmath283889 and @xmath287065 ) have negative exponents in the temperature term does not provide as much leverage on the temperature because these two lines are also strongly affected by optical depth and collisional excitation effects .",
    "finally , for a more robust determination of the uncertainties in the physical parameters and ultimately in @xmath37 , we perform a monte - carlo simulation of the data . starting with the observational inputs and their stated uncertainties , we have generated a data set which is gaussian distributed for the 6 observed he emission lines . from each distribution",
    ", we randomly select a set of input values and run the @xmath38 minimization .",
    "the selection of data is repeated 1000 times .",
    "we thus obtain a distribution of solutions for @xmath39 , @xmath31 , and @xmath40 and we compare the mean and dispersion of these distributions with the initial solution for these quantities .    in simple photoionization models ,",
    "hii regions divide into two different ionization zones where the cooling is dominated by either o@xmath33 or o@xmath42 .",
    "typical abundance analyses usually take this into account and derive different electron temperatures for the two different zones ( and use the different electron temperatures for deriving ionic abundances , see garnett 1992 ) . in our new code we have the option of using two different temperatures in determining the he / h abundances ( as done in ppr00 and lppc , but not in it98 ) .",
    "we have experimented with this option , and , for this study have decided to concentrate on single temperature models .",
    "given the number of physical parameters that one is solving for and the limited number of emission lines measured with high precision , satisfactory results were only achieved in cases where a relationship was assumed between the temperatures in the low and high ionization zones ( as is usually done when calculating oxygen abundances ) .",
    "since we are advocating non - parametric solutions , we felt it best to stick to the simpler case of single temperature solutions .",
    "the study of ngc  346 by ppr00 emphasized the advantages ( relative to studying more distant blue compact galaxies ) of ( 1 ) no underlying absorption correction for the helium lines , ( 2 ) the opportunity to observe multiple lines of sight , and ( 3 ) due to a lower electron temperature , the effects of collisional excitation on the permitted lines are small .",
    "they also identified the disadvantage of a larger correction for chemical evolution for the study of the primordial helium abundance .",
    "this study introduced the technique of deriving the electron temperature directly from the helium lines .",
    "given the high quality of observations presented there , it is a good starting point to compare our own analysis techniques . here",
    "we will concentrate on their region `` a '' , which provides the highest quality spectrum . the relevant he  i emission lines , equivalent widths , and errors , taken from ppr00 , are presented in table 1 .",
    "here we have taken the reddening corrected he  i emission line fluxes and their associated errors directly from ppr00 . in analyzing these data ,",
    "our main goal is to see if our analysis is consistent with that of ppr00 .    in os we made specific suggestions about treating the errors in the reddening correction , and we thought it would be interesting to revisit that question here .",
    "thus , we carry out parallel analyses on a second set of data .",
    "the second set of data listed in table 1 ( labeled `` re - analyzed '' ) have been derived from the original flux ratio observations of ppr00 and then de - reddened using the prescription for solving for reddening and underlying h absorption as described in os . for this second set , we have adopted the average extinction law of cardelli , clayton , & mathis ( 1989 ; hereafter ccm ) .",
    "this is the most commonly used astrophysical extinction law , but it differs slightly from that of the normal extinction law of whitford ( 1958 ) used by ppr00 . since the extinction law is normally assumed without any associated errors , we were interested in the effect of simply using a different ( although generally acceptable ) extinction law . figure 2 shows the differences between the ccm extinction law and that used by ppr00 .",
    "we also assign errors of 10% to the ew measurements ( as some value of error is needed for our minimization technique , and none is reported in ppr00 ) .",
    "the error in the ew is a conservative one , but the final results do not change significantly if the errors are varied between 10% and 2% .",
    "[ fig2 ]    in what follows we refer to a simple minimization based on the input data as a `` direct '' analysis ( labeled `` d '' in the tables ) , and an analysis over 1000 representations which are consistent with the errors in the input data as a `` monte carlo ( `` mc '' ) analysis . '' in our first analysis , we assume a temperature of 11,920 k , the average he  i temperature found by ppr00 . holding this temperature fixed , and assuming no underlying absorption , we derive values of he@xmath43/h@xmath43 @xmath25 0.0795 @xmath26 0.0005 and n@xmath44 @xmath25 164@xmath45 which compare quite well with 0.0793 @xmath26 0.0006 and 146 @xmath26 50 reported by ppr00 ( see table 2 ) .",
    "dropping the assumption of zero underlying absorption gives a very similar result in the direct analysis , supporting ppr00 s claim that there is no underlying absorption ( see table 2 ) . using a monte carlo analysis",
    ", we derive he@xmath43/h@xmath43 @xmath25 0.0801 @xmath26 0.0011 and n@xmath44 @xmath25 159 @xmath26 69 , where we see that the central values are only slightly changed , but the error bars on he@xmath43/h@xmath43 increase by about a factor of two ( see table 2 ) .",
    "the close similarity of the two results indicates that our minimization techniques produce similar results with high quality data and similar assumptions .",
    "although the ppr00 could not use the radiative transfer results of benjamin skillman , & smits ( 2002 ) , the spectrum for ngc  346 indicates very low values of @xmath31(3889 ) , so good agreement is expected .    in figure",
    "[ fig3 ] , we show the results of our analysis for the case where we have fixed the temperature and allow for positive values of the underlying absorption coefficient , @xmath32 . for this model",
    "we have used a two zone temperature model and assumed that the temperatures in those two zones are identical to the values derived by ppr00 .",
    "thus , the main difference between these calculations and those of ppr00 are dropping the assumptions of zero underlying absorption and zero optical depth in the triplet helium lines .",
    "note the very good agreement between the our results ( shown by the position of the solid circle ) and those of ppr00 ( shown by the intersection of the vertical and horizontal lines ) .",
    "the small dots show the possible variations in solutions due to the monte carlo generation of data .",
    "the solid square shows the position of the mean value of the 1000 sets of generated data .",
    "while the mean value is consistent with both our direct solution and ppr00 , the uncertainty in @xmath46 is nearly doubled .",
    "[ fig3 ]    when we allow the code to solve for the electron temperature , we get a slightly higher value of 12,510 k ( see table 2 ) .",
    "this temperature lies between the values of t(o  iii ) ( 13,070 k ) and t(o  ii ) ( 11,810 k ) , which would normally be expected ( peimbert , peimbert , & luridiana 2002 ) .",
    "this new solution drops the @xmath38 value from 3.0 to 2.4 , which an _ ftest _ shows is significant only at the 45% confidence level .",
    "the solution with the higher temperature also favors a lower density and a small amount of underlying absorption ( although consistent with zero ) with a resulting he@xmath43/h@xmath43 ratio which is 2% higher than the ppr00 value .",
    "note that , although 2% seems like a small difference , the value obtained from the direct analysis allowing for underlying absorption and deriving the electron temperature from the helium line ratios is 3@xmath47 higher than the ppr00 value .",
    "the mc value is slightly higher still , but this could be mainly due to the fact that the code requires the underlying absorption to be positive , so that , when the value is close to zero , there is a bias in the mean value to be larger .",
    "the results of the mc analysis are shown in figure 4 .",
    "in addition to the value of @xmath46 being larger , the uncertainty in @xmath46 is now over a factor of 2 larger than quoted in ppr00 .",
    "[ fig4 ]    as a check on the assumption of positive underlying he absorption , we then ran the direct and monte carlo codes allowing both positive and negative values of underlying he absorption .",
    "the result of the direct analysis is almost identical to that obtained with the absorption held positive ( see table 2 ) . in the table , ` solved + ' refers to the restriction that only positive values of the parameter were permitted , ` solved free ' indicates that both positive and negative values are allowed , and ` fixed ' means that the parameter was not solved for , but rather an input value was used and held fixed .",
    "thus , the detection of a small amount of underlying he absorption is not due to a bias from the code only allowing positive values .",
    "the higher values of the he abundance ( roughly 2% higher for the direct method and 3% higher for the monte carlo method ) are probably due to a small , but real , amount of underlying he absorption .",
    "finally we ran the direct and monte carlo codes allowing both positive and negative values of all three physical parameters : density , underlying absorption , and optical depth while still solving for electron temperature ( last lines in table 2 ) .",
    "note that negative values of density and optical depth are non - physical .",
    "now the favored value for the underlying absorption is almost very close to zero .",
    "however , it is very interesting that the free solution has favored negative ( non - physical ) values of the optical depth . in this solution , because of the negative value for the optical depth , the density has jumped up to 427 ( mainly because of the inverse dependences on density and optical depth for the @xmath287065 line ) , resulting in a he@xmath43/h@xmath43 value which is even lower than the ppr00 value .",
    "the favored negative values of the optical depth indicate that either our prescription for the treatment of radiative transfer on the helium line strengths is not appropriate for ngc  346 or that the value for @xmath283889 ( the main driver of the optical depth solution ) is somewhat in error ( or both ) .    from this exercise",
    "we conclude that the error bars on the derivation of individual hii region parameters are underestimated for several reasons .",
    "first , as concluded in os , unless a monte carlo analysis of the data is performed , the resulting errors of a single minimization exercise are likely to be underestimates . in the case for which we solve for temperature and absorption , our mc uncertainty is over a factor of 2 larger than that quoted by ppr00 .",
    "second , by making different reasonable assumptions , different central values of the helium abundance are obtained ( and these values differ by several standard deviations if the errors are calculated in the direct manner ) . for ngc  346a",
    "these differences are only a few percent because the quality of the data constrains the results to a relatively narrow range . however , typical hii region spectra used for deriving helium abundances are not even close to the quality of the ngc  346a spectrum from ppr00 .",
    "third , by allowing the code to examine non - physical values of certain parameters there is an indication that perhaps the prescription for treating the radiative transfer is not completely appropriate .",
    "this implies a systematic uncertainty which has not been accounted for in the errors analysis .    in table 2",
    "we also report the results of re - analyzing the ngc  346a spectrum using our favored prescriptions for the solution for reddening and underlying hydrogen absorption and the appropriate error propagation ( we label these entries `` re - an '' ) .",
    "our analysis finds a similar value for c(h@xmath29 ) @xmath25 0.174 @xmath26 0.008 ( compared to 0.15 @xmath26 0.01 for ppr00 ) , and no evidence of underlying hydrogen absorption ( formally @xmath480.6 @xmath26 0.5  ) .",
    "as seen in table 1 , there are small differences between the ppr00 relative line fluxes and those resulting from our re - analysis , which are mostly due to the differences in the adopted reddening curve ( and some small differences might be expected simply due to round - off errors ) .",
    "as expected , only small differences are found when we analyze these helium ratios ( as shown in table 2 ) .",
    "there is , however , one interesting difference .",
    "when we solve for all of the parameters including temperature , the temperature is higher ( although not as high as the [ o  iii ] temperature ) with the result that the density falls and the helium abundance rises by 2% relative to that found in the similar analysis with the ppr00 data .",
    "both the original data and the re - analyzed data favor negative values of the optical depth .",
    "it appears that even with excellent quality spectra , one is never far from unsatisfactory results , and that one needs exquisite quality data to insure that the best minimization values favor physically meaningful values .",
    "a detailed inspection of table 2 indicates that the values derived for the physical parameters and the helium abundance depend on the assumptions that are made in the analysis . while the variations are of order 2 ",
    "3% for most of the helium abundance determinations , this is very significant for determination of @xmath3 , and of order the discrepancies found in the literature .",
    "for example , the ppr00 value of @xmath49 corresponds to a 4 mass fraction of 0.2403 , from which they inferred a primordial abundance of 0.2345 which in turn corresponds to @xmath50 .",
    "our value ( using the re - analyzed data ) of @xmath51 corresponds to a 4 mass fraction of 0.2483 . using the same slope ( dy / dz ) yields a primordial abundance of 0.2425 which in turn corresponds to @xmath52 .",
    "thus , one sees a difference of nearly a factor of two in the derived value of @xmath13 simply from using a different set of assumptions .",
    "figure 5 underscores this point .",
    "here we have plotted the he@xmath43/h@xmath43 ratios and errors derived for each line as a result of our direct method which solves simultaneously for helium abundance , temperature , density , underlying absorption and optical depth under the assumption that all are positive .",
    "the solid and dotted lines across the bottom indicate the solution from ppr00 .",
    "the significant difference is due primarily to assumptions made in analyzing the observations . in other words ,",

    "are not reported , so we have estimated the strength of the continuum ( from published spectra ) and used the ew(h@xmath29 ) to derive these ews .",
    "this is , of course , less than desirable , and , at first , we hesitated to carry this out .",

    "several differences between the results of the it98 analysis and our re - analysis are immediately apparent .",
    "first , the physical parameters t , n , @xmath31(3889 ) , and he(abs ) are all significantly less well constrained in our re - analysis . in some cases , this is because some of these values were assumed to be zero with no associated errors , and in other cases we believe that the errors were underestimated . the larger uncertainties in the physical parameters naturally translate into larger uncertainties in the helium abundances .",
    "table 11 shows a larger dispersion in the re - analyzed he abundances , with a slight bias toward higher values .",
    "note that in the discussions of the individual objects we raised reservations concerning the suitability of several of these spectra for deriving very high accuracy helium abundances . specifically , sbs 0940 + 544n and mrk 193",

    "sbs 0335 - 052 and sbs 1420 + 544 both have relatively large values of @xmath31(3889 ) , and we doubt that the simple prescription for correcting for optical depth effects will be accurate in this regime . although we specifically selected objects with high emission line equivalent width , two objects ( ngc 2363 a and haro 29 ) show significant evidence for underlying helium absorption , and thus , are dependent on our assumption of the behavior of the absorption equivalent widths on a line - by - line basis .    in sum ,",
    "even the spectra that were selected specifically to be the highest quality provide only nominal constraints on the physical conditions in the hii regions , and thus , carry significant errors on their helium abundances compared to what is necessary to constrain the value of the primordial helium abundance .",
    "recently , izotov & thuan ( 2004 ; it04 ) have presented new observations of 33 hii regions in order to provide a better metallicity baseline and therefore stronger constraints on @xmath59 .",
    "they combine these new observations with those of it98 to conduct an analysis of 82 hii regions .",
    "we have studied the new spectra presented by it04 to determine if there are new observations which satisfy our criteria for inclusion in a `` high quality '' data sample , and , in fact , there are seven targets that do satisfy the criteria enumerated at the beginning of  4 .",
    "these seven targets , in order of increasing metallicity are : j  0519 + 0007 , hs  2236 + 1344 , hs  0122 + 0743 , hs  0837 + 4717 , cgcg  007 - 025 , hs  0134 + 3415 , and hs  1028 + 3843 .",
    "we performed a complete analysis of these seven targets following the method used in  4 .",
    "[ fig6 ]    unfortunately , we discovered a serious problem with many of the observations reported in it04 , which render them questionable for use in our analyses .",
    "when we solve for the reddening and underlying balmer absorption in the spectra from it04 , we often encounter significantly negative values of underlying balmer absorption .",
    "this is found in 4 of the 7 cases identified as potential `` high quality '' sample targets .",
    "figure 6 shows the solutions for these four sources .",
    "the solutions for underlying absorption are found to be negative ranging from 1.4 @xmath47 for cgcg  007 - 025 to 4.1 @xmath47 for j  0519 + 0007 . as can be seen from figure 6 , in all cases it04 derived values of 0   for the underlying balmer ratios .",
    "this may be due to limiting the solution to physically meaningful , i.e. , positive values .",
    "as noted before , it was problematic that two of the targets in the it98 `` high quality '' data sample showed negative values for underlying balmer absorption ( sbs  0940 + 544n at the 1.0 @xmath47 level and mrk 193 at 1.7 @xmath47 ) , but the prevalence in the new sample can not be ignored .",
    "in fact , roughly half of the new observations reported in it04 indicate zero underlying balmer absorption , indicating that this problem exists throughout the dataset . if we look at the object in the `` high quality '' data sample with the most negative value of underlying balmer absorption ( j  0519 + 0007 ) we find that the reddening corrected values for the blue balmer lines are all significantly too high relative to the theoretical values ( i.e. , h@xmath60/h@xmath29 , h@xmath61/h@xmath29 , h9/h@xmath29 , and h10/h@xmath29 are @xmath624.4 @xmath47 , @xmath625.1 @xmath47 , @xmath620.4 @xmath47 , and @xmath621.8 @xmath47 respectively ) .",
    "in fact , the values for the blue balmer lines before reddening correction are all close to their theoretical values , indicating very low reddening to this target .",
    "brief inspection of the other targets reveals a similar pattern , indicating that the problem may be solely with the h@xmath21 line ( in the sense that the h@xmath21 line is too strong ) and this could point to a problem with the sensitivity calibration in that wavelength range . on the other hand ,",
    "j  0519 + 0007 is at a galactic latitude of @xmath4820@xmath63 and according to schlegel et al .",
    "( 1998 ) should have an extinction of a@xmath64 @xmath65 0.4 mag .",
    "if there is no problem with the sensitivity calibration , then the effect could be due to atmospheric differential refraction ( cf .",
    ", filippenko 1982 ) even thought the object was observed at an airmass of 1.2 .",
    "an alternative explanation could be that these spectra indicate the collisional enhancement of the h@xmath21 ( see discussion in skillman & kennicutt 1993 ) , but it seems unlikely that we would see it in so many sources and not find a strong correlation with electron temperature .",
    "until this problem is solved , we have reservations concerning the inclusion of the spectra from it04 in our study of the primordial helium abundance . in table 12",
    "we have reported our re - analysis of the `` high quality '' sample of it04 .",
    "unfortunately , it04 do not report their derived values for @xmath30 and @xmath31(3889 ) so direct comparisons are not possible , but it appears that many of the characteristics from table 11 are also found in table 12 . in our analysis , several of the targets show relatively large values of @xmath31(3889 ) and significant evidence for underlying hei absorption .",
    "given the different possible assumptions one can make regarding the treatment of the underlying absorption , optical depth , or temperature , one can justifiably wonder whether it is indeed possible to extract a reliable value of the primordial abundance of 4 from these observations .",
    "it is our hope that by striving to free our solutions from as many parametric constraints as possible and by considering all identifiable sources of error that we can now produce a value of the primordial helium abundance with reasonable error estimates .",
    "[ fig7 ]    if we take our preferred solutions based on the re - analyzed data ( where we use the monte carlo technique and solve for temperature and restrict all parameters to take positive values ) for the seven `` high quality '' targets from it98 , then a regression of y@xmath43 on o / h yields an intercept of : y_p = 0.2491 0.0091 the corresponding value for the baryon - to - photon ratio is _ 10 = 6.64^+11.1_-3.82 easily in good agreement with the cmb determination of @xmath3 .",
    "figure 7 shows a comparison between the original it98 values and our re - analysis for the seven `` high quality '' targets . it also compares the results of the above regression with the original value obtained by it98 for the full set of 45 targets .",
    "the error on y@xmath2 derived above and shown in figure 7 is 4.5 times larger than derived by it98 .",
    "one could argue that we should drop the two observations which yielded negative balmer absorption . in this case , our regression for five points would yield , @xmath66 .",
    "while the intercept has decreased slightly , the uncertainty has increased making the 1 @xmath47 upper limit virtually identical .",
    "obviously , some of the increase in the error is due to the decrease in the sample size from 45 to 7 , and some of the increase in the error is due to a larger error on the slope due to a smaller metallicity baseline .",
    "however , a good part of the increase in the error is due to the larger error on the individual points .",
    "additionally , some of the decrease in the intercept error gained by extending the metallicity baseline to higher metallicities is misleading because it is dependent on the questionable assumption of a perfectly linear relationship between y and o / h .",
    "we can investigate the effect of limiting the sample size by including some of the it04 data points . if we include the three `` high quality '' targets from it04 which do not show evidence of negative underlying h  i absorption , using all eight points which show no sign of negative h  i absorption we obtain : y_p = 0.2502 0.0093 the corresponding value for the baryon - to - photon ratio is _",
    "10 = 7.48^+12.9_-4.45 again , easily in good agreement with the cmb determination of @xmath3 .",
    "finally , if we include all seven `` high quality '' targets from it04 together with all seven from it98 , we obtain : y_p = 0.2504 0.0073 the corresponding value for the baryon - to - photon ratio is _ 10 = 7.63^+9.1_-3.95 also easily in good agreement with the cmb determination of @xmath3 .    note that although the error on y@xmath2 is declining with the increase in number of targets , it is not decreasing as the square root of the number of targets .",
    "it appears that there is a floor in the uncertainty which is likely greater than 0.005 .    in figure 1",
    "we summarize our view of the present situation .",
    "clearly the true uncertainty on the primordial helium abundance is much larger than indicated in previous studies .",
    "we can not rule out values as high as the those achieved with our re - analysis of the it98 observations .",
    "neither can we rule out values as low as those derived by ppr00 . thus , perhaps the best we can say is that the primordial 4 abundance lies within the `` conservative allowable range '' indicated in figure 1 .",
    "0.232 y_p 0.258 this extended range in @xmath24 corresponds to 1.8 _ 10 18 thus , at present , there is no conflict with the cmb inferred value of @xmath24 .",
    "one of the key results of the preceding exercise is that despite having apparently high quality data , the final 4 abundance for any given hii region will depend critically on assumptions concerning the appropriate electron temperature , the presence of underlying absorption , and the treatment of the optical depth effects .",
    "many of the systems analyzed here show significant evidence for underlying absorption which leads to an increase in the derived 4 abundance .",
    "additionally , many of the systems show significant evidence for non - zero values of @xmath31(3889 ) which relies on an untested formula for correction .",
    "furthermore , as one can see from the results for individual hii regions shown in the tables , the spread in the derived 4 abundances can be far greater than the derived error for a given solution .",
    "this is a clear sign that systematic uncertainties are dominating the error budget . while some of the systematics such as optical depth and underlying absorption move the 4 abundance in opposite directions , it makes no sense to suppose that these systematic uncertainties cancel each other out and therefore can be ignored as argued in it04 .",
    "nor does it make sense to continuously average literature data to beat down the statistical errors , once again in complete neglect of the systematic uncertainties as attempted in dmitriev , flambaum & webb ( 2004 ) . in this context",
    ", we stress that there is no evidence for a discrepancy between bbn predictions of 4 using the wmap baryon density and observational determinations of the 4 abundance as frequently reported in the literature .",
    "inherent degeneracies between the parameters allow for very different solutions with equally acceptable @xmath38 .",
    "this was the main point of our previous work ( os ) .",
    "perhaps most troubling is the degeneracy in the parameter space identified here between temperature and density .",
    "as we noted throughout our analysis , it98 have fixed the temperature to the oiii temperature which is systematically high ( peimbert , peimbert , & luridiana 2002 ) . however , as one can see from eqs .",
    "( a2 ) , changes in temperature can be compensated by changes in the density allowing for the possibility of very different results due to various corrections .",
    "this may explain the puzzling result that the dispersion in the it98 helium abundances is actually smaller than their formal errors . by assuming that the oiii temperatures are appropriate to the entire he@xmath33 emission zone , the densities have been biased to unrealistically low values resulting in higher values of the helium abundance . on the other hand , by assuming that underlying he absorption is negligible , the derived helium abundances have been biased to lower values .",
    "the narrow range of derived helium abundances may be a result of these biases in the analysis .",
    "there are other potentially important sources for systematic uncertainty such as temperature fluctuations ( steigman , viegas , & gruenwald 1997 ; sauer & jedamzik 2002 ) , ionization corrections ( ballantyne , ferland , & martin 2000 ; viegas , gruenwald , & steigman 2000 ; gruenwald , steigman & viegas 2002 ; sauer & jedamzik 2002 ) , and the collisional excitation of hydrogen emission lines ( skillman & kennicutt 1993 ; stasi ' nska & izotov 2001 , lppc ) .",
    "however , it is our impression that these are small compared to the uncertainties that we have focused on here .    from our analyses",
    ", it appears that the high ew regions may be more prone to high values of @xmath31(3889 ) , which makes them less suitable candidates .",
    "this could be a real problem for identifying new candidates for high precision helium abundances .",
    "if derived helium abundances depend on our simple model for helium optical depth effects , we have a systematic uncertainty which , at present , is not testable . at this point , the prudent thing to do is to exclude all targets with relatively high values of @xmath31(3889 ) from any analysis sample ( as opposed to trying to correct for such effects ) .",
    "we suggest that the following efforts will result in future progress on obtaining a more accurate value for the primordial helium abundance . on the observation side :    \\(1 ) significantly higher quality spectra are needed for almost all of the regions studied to date .",
    "concentrating on those objects which appear to have higher ew(h@xmath29 ) and low @xmath31(3889 ) , in addition to low o / h abundance , will be important .",
    "\\(2 ) it is still important to search for new targets . obviously the targets which satisfy the above criteria are rare ( terlevich , skillman , & terlevich 1996 )",
    "\\(3 ) observations along multiple lines of sight to individual targets will allow testing of our analysis techniques as the physical conditions are changing while ( hopefully ) the helium abundances are not ( e.g. , skillman et al .  1994 ) .",
    "\\(4 ) observations are needed at higher spectral resolution and over a larger wavelength range .",
    "the higher resolution ( better than 1  ) will allow the profiles of the underlying hei absorption to be observed , and thus allow for better corrections .",
    "the larger wavelength range will allow measurements of additional physical parameters ( i.e. , the temperature in the lower ionization zone from [ o  ii ] lines ) which will place stronger constraints on the derived physical parameters .",
    "long - slit double spectrographs provide the best tool for this work .    on the theoretical side ,",
    "work remains in order to better characterize the uncertainties in the current atomic data and the prescriptions by which the observations are converted into abundances ( e.g. , porter , bauman , & ferland 2003 ) .    in sum ,",
    "echoing our introduction , pinning down the primordial helium abundance to a higher accuracy remains a worthwhile goal . to significantly decrease",
    "the uncertainty in the primordial helium abundance will require spectra of metal poor hii regions of a quality exceeding most of those present in the literature today and analyses that take into account the several sources of systematic errors which have been identified so far .",
