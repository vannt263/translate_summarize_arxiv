    "it is generally assumed that the relativistic particles in powerful radio galaxies and quasars , initially generated in the vicinity of the active galactic nucleus and channeled by the radio jets out to hundreds of kpc , are re - accelerated in the radio hot spots , which mark the location of strong planar shocks formed at the heads of the jets themselves ( e.g. , begelman et al .",

    "one of the most important pieces of evidence in favor of electron re - acceleration in the hot spots is the detection of synchrotron emission in the optical / near - ir band , due to high energy electrons ( lorentz factor @xmath3 ) with very short radiative lifetimes ( e.g. , meisenheimer et al .",

    "rser ( 1989 ) first discovered the northern radio hot spots in the optical band , whereas lhteenmki & valtaoja ( 1999 ) found optical linear polarisation ( @xmath8- and @xmath9-band ) with the 2.5 m nordic optical telescope on la palma ; to our knowledge , no optical fluxes have been quoted in the literature . on 1995",

    "on the basis of positional coincidence we identified optical counterparts of the two northern radio hot spots on the wfpc2 image . in order to better constrain the optical spectra we also observed these hot spots with a 1200-s b - band exposure at the 3.5 m tng on la palma during the night of 2001 august 16 .",
    "the hot spots were detected with a high signal to noise and the errors on the fluxes ( table 1 ) , obtained with 4-arcsec aperture photometry ( the seeing was 1.5 arcsec ) , are within 10% .",

    "in addition to the nuclear source , two relatively bright x - ray sources , coincident with the double northern radio hot spot , are clearly detected : @xmath2 82@xmath1010 and 54@xmath109 net counts are associated with components j and l , respectively . despite the poor statistics , we have attempted to derive spectral information using appropriate response and effective area functions . in both cases a single power law ( 3c 351j : @xmath11 ; 3c 351l : @xmath12 ) , with absorption fixed at the galactic value @xmath13@xmath14 ( elvis et al .",
    "1989 ) , provides an acceptable description of the data .",
    "as no bright thermal emission from a cluster around 3c 351 has been detected by the _",
    "chandra _ observation , we find that x - ray emission from any shocked gas in the hot spot region would be orders of magnitude lower than that observed . as discussed in the introduction , the most plausible non - thermal mechanism responsible for x - ray emission is ssc . in fig .",
    "2 we show fits to the broad band spectrum of the hot spots 3c351j and l. the emitted synchrotron and ssc spectra are obtained with standard recipes , assuming an electron energy distribution as derived under basic fermi - i acceleration theory : a power - law spectrum with injection energy index @xmath15 which steepens at higher energies ( @xmath16 ) up to a high energy cutoff @xmath17 , whereas it flattens at lower energies before a low energy cutoff ( equations for the electron spectrum and for the ssc calculation are given in brunetti et al .",

    "the ssc flux is obtained by taking radii @xmath18 and @xmath19 arcsec for 3c 351j and l , respectively ( bridle et al .",
    "the parameters of the spectra obtained from fitting the radio and optical data points , i.e. , the electron injection index ( @xmath15 ) , the synchrotron break ( @xmath20 ) and cutoff frequency ( @xmath21 ) are given in table 2 ( 90% confidence level ) .",
    "a synchrotron spectrum with a cutoff frequency at very high energies is still consistent with the data of 3c 351j and is also plotted in fig .  2 in order to show the maximum synchrotron contribution to the x - rays ( @xmath22 at 90% confidence level ) .",
    "it should be noted that the high - frequency cutoff of 3c 351j is at least one order of magnitude larger than those of other optical hot spots in the literature , and that the break frequencies for both hot spots are also higher than the typical breaks measured in the synchrotron spectra of optical hot spots ( e.g. , meisenheimer et al .",
    "1997 ; gopal - krishna et al .",
    "2001 ) .",
    "we find that for both hot spots the ssc mechanism provides a good representation of the _ chandra _ data for magnetic fields , ( @xmath23 , table 2 ) , which are a factor of @xmath24 smaller than the equipartition values ( @xmath25230 @xmath26 g for 3c 351j and @xmath25100 @xmath26 g for 3c 351l ) .",
    "for these field strengths , we find that inverse - compton ( ic ) scattering of cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) photons could account for @xmath27% of the x - ray flux of 3c 351l , whereas it does not significantly contribute to the x - ray spectrum of 3c 351j .",
    "it is interesting to note that the x  ray luminosity of 3c 351j is comparable to or slightly higher than the synchrotron radio to optical luminosity .",
    "if the x - rays are of ssc origin , the radiative losses of the relativistic electrons would be dominated by ic ( due to second- and third - order scattering ) so that the electrons cooling times would be a factor of @xmath28 shorter than those due to the synchrotron process alone . however , as the value of the magnetic field strength in the compton - dominated 3c 351j is @xmath24 times smaller than equipartition , the radiative cooling time of the electrons emitting synchrotron radiation at @xmath29hz is a factor @xmath30 larger than that computed under equipartition , so that the acceleration of such particles is eased with respect to the equipartition case .",
    "a viable model for the x  ray emission of 3c 351j can also be obtained with a combination of a synchrotron spectrum and a ssc component ( accounting for @xmath31 of the flux ) . in this case",
    ", the resulting spectral index would be somewhat steeper than that of the ssc model .",
    "this would imply very efficient electron acceleration processes , but the basic ssc model remains unchanged . improved spectral measurements may be able to settle the size of a possible synchrotron contribution .",
    "relativistic boosting appears to be necessary to explain the x - ray jet emission in a few core - dominated radio - loud quasars ( e.g. , tavecchio et al .  2000 ; celotti et al .",
    "2001 ; brunetti et al .",
    "2001 ) , however its role in the case of the hot spots is still unclear ; for instance , statistical analysis of samples of frii radio sources implies non - relativistic velocities ( e.g. , arshakian & longair 2000 ) . under equipartition ( in the hot spot frame )",
    "ic scattering of cmb photons can produce the observed x - ray fluxes for doppler factors @xmath32 and 3.8 in the cases of 3c 351j and l , respectively .",
    "such factors , however , can only be obtained for relatively small angles between the hot spots velocities and the line of sight ( @xmath33 with @xmath34 for 3c 351j , and @xmath35 with @xmath36 for 3c 351l ) , whereas the radio properties of 3c 351 and the lack of lobe asymmetry suggest much larger inclination angles and smaller hot spot velocities .",
    "this problem remains even if we relax the equipartition condition : assuming a departure from equipartition similar to that required by the ssc , a doppler factor @xmath37 ( @xmath38 ) is necessary to match the x - ray flux of 3c 351j by ic scattering of the cmb .",
    "a second possible way of accounting for the large x - ray fluxes of the hot spots is to require the ssc to be enhanced with respect to the synchrotron emission via doppler de - boosting .",
    "we find , however , that in order to match the data under equipartition conditions @xmath39 is required , implying extremely high bulk lorentz factors ( @xmath40 , with @xmath41 ) .",
    "based on evidence for relativistic jet bulk motion out to 100-kpc scales , gopal - krishna et al .",
    "( 2001 ) have reconsidered a minimum loss scenario in which the relativistic electrons , accelerated in the central active nucleus , flow along the jets losing energy only due to the inescapable ic scattering of cmb photons . under these assumptions , comparing the electron radiative lifetime with the travel time to the hot spots , they find that _ in situ _ electron re - acceleration is in general not absolutely necessary to explain the optical / near - ir synchrotron radiation from the hot spots so far detected . following gopal - krishna et al .",
    "( 2001 ) we define @xmath42 , the ratio between the distance of the hot spots from the nucleus and the largest distance covered by the electrons in the jet before dropping to less than e@xmath5 of their initial energy due to ic losses ; i.e. ,    @xmath43^{1/2 } \\label{dmax}\\ ] ]    with @xmath44 and our constraints on @xmath21 and @xmath1 we find @xmath45@xmath46 ( 3c 351j ) and @xmath47@xmath48 ( 3c 351l ) for @xmath49@xmath50 ( as adopted by gopal - krishna et al .",
    "we also find that if the electrons are accelerated in 3c 351j and then transported in a jet out to 3c 351l , the lifetime of the optically emitting electrons in 3c 351l ( @xmath51 yr assuming @xmath52 g in the jet ) is at least one order of magnitude less than the time necessary to cover the distance between the two hot spots at non - relativistic speeds , and @xmath53 is still @xmath54 if they are transported at relativistic speeds .",
    "these large values unequivocally point to the necessity of efficient re - acceleration processes in both the northern hot spots of 3c 351 .",
    "an independent estimate of the magnetic field strength @xmath1 in the hot spot can be obtained in the framework of shock acceleration models .",
    "the highest energies of the relativistic electrons accelerated in a shock region by fermi processes is given by the ratio between gain and loss terms . for a strong shock ( here , for simplicity , we consider the non - relativistic case ) the largest energy of the accelerated electrons is ( e.g. , meisenheimer et al .",
    "1989 ) :    @xmath55    where @xmath56 is the velocity of the flow in the upstream region ( with respect to the shock ) , @xmath57 is the total equivalent magnetic field strength in the downstream region , and @xmath58 is the mean free path of the relativistic electrons in the downstream region .",
    "the break energy of the electrons in the downstream region ( i.e. , the highest energy of the oldest electrons in the post shock region ) is :    @xmath59    where @xmath60 is the velocity of the flow in the downstream region , @xmath61 is the linear extension of such a region and @xmath62 a constant . substituting into eqs.([gammac][gammab ] ) the expression for the synchrotron cutoff frequency , @xmath63 , one obtains : @xmath64 \\right)^{2/3 } l_{\\rm kpc}^{-2/3 } \\left ( { { \\nu_{\\rm c } } \\over { 10^{15}{\\rm hz } } } \\right)^{-1/3 } \\xi^{1/3 } \\label{bp}\\ ] ]    where @xmath65 is @xmath66 0.5 for the hot spot j and 0.9 for l , and the value of @xmath67 can be estimated from bridle et al .",
    "( 1994 ) . for @xmath68",
    "eq.4 reduces to @xmath69 , and from the values of @xmath20 previously constrained we find @xmath70 and @xmath71 g for j and l , respectively , with a formal uncertainty of about a factor 2 .",
    "these values are in good agreement with the magnetic field strengths implied by an ssc origin for the x - ray emission .",
    "the radio to optical spectrum of the two northern hot spots of 3c 351 is well accounted for by a synchrotron model under the standard shock acceleration scenario .",
    "the most straightforward interpretation of the x - ray emission discovered by _",
    "chandra _ is the ssc mechanism",
    ". a viable model for 3c 351j is also given by a combination of ssc and synchrotron spectra , with the ssc accounting for @xmath72 of the x - ray flux . in order to match the x - ray fluxes a magnetic field strength of a factor 3 lower than the equipartition value",
    "is required in both the hot spots . in principle",
    "the assumption of relativistic bulk motion of the hot spots might reduce the departure from equipartition , but large _ ad hoc _ distortions of the radio jet would be required , with the hot spots moving close to the line of sight .",
    "the frequencies of the cutoff in the synchrotron spectra and the magnetic field strengths point to the need for _ in situ _ electron ( re)acceleration in the region of both the hot spots .",
    "when we independently estimate the magnetic field strength of the hot spots , using relationships from standard shock theory , our results are consistent with the more precise value obtained by modeling the x - ray emission as resulting from the ssc mechanism .",
