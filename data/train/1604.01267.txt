    "the studying of black holes in the asymptotically ads spacetime is mainly motivated by the gauge / gravity duality @xcite .",
    "this novel duality provides us a powerful tool to study the strongly coupled gauge theory by mapping it to weakly coupled classical gravitational system living in one higher dimension . in this holographic setup ,",
    "asymptotically ads black hole is dual to a thermal state of conformal field theory on its boundary @xcite .",
    "the construction of various holographic models of condensed matter physics depends highly on the properties of this kind of backgrounds .",
    "so understanding the various properties of asymptotically ads black hole is a central topic in current fundamental research .",
    "the interaction of charged field with the electromagnetic background in a charged black hole is more interesting than expected because of the superradiance phenomenon .",
    "this effect is mainly known for the rotating black hole , for which it allows a bosonic wave to carry out the rotating energy of the black hole @xcite .",
    "however , the charged scalar field in the vicinity of charged black hole can also extract the electromagnetic energy of the black hole by a wave with increased amplitude via superradiant scattering process @xcite .",
    "if , in addition , the scattering wave is reflected by a potential barrier or a mirror sufficiently far away , then the wave will be amplified repeatedly .",
    "the resulted exponential growth is dubbed as the superradiant instability , or black hole bomb @xcite .",
    "because of the theoretical significance and astrophysical application of superradiant instability , it has attracted a lot of attention in recent years @xcite .",
    "one can refer to ref.@xcite for a comprehensive review on this topic .    in the rnads",
    "black hole case , the timelike boundary of ads black hole is equivalent to the infinite high potential barrier , which implies the absence of dissipation at infinity .",
    "so , a charged scalar field in rnads black hole background will exhibit superradiant instability , which has been confirmed by calculating the quasinormal modes of rnads black hole in @xmath0-dimension @xcite and in general @xmath1-dimensions @xcite in the limit of small @xmath2 ( @xmath3 is the horizon radius of black hole and @xmath4 is the ads curvature radius ) .",
    "these results are valid when ignoring the backreaction on the spacetime .",
    "the understanding of dynamics of charged scalar field in rnads black hole requires the full nonlinear machinery of einstein equation , complemented with the linearized analysis .",
    "actually the spherically symmetric nonlinear evolution of superradiant instability for the charged scalar field has recently been reported and the corresponding final states have also been studied @xcite . the static black hole solutions which is conjectured to be the end point of the superradiant instability were also constructed in @xcite previously .",
    "however , the linear time domain analysis of charged scalar field in rnads black hole backgrounds in general @xmath1 dimensions is still missing .",
    "this paper intends to fill this gap , which is supposed to be a good preparation for one to attack the more generic nonlinear dynamics of instability .",
    "especially , we also confirm there exists the rapid exponential growing mode when the charge of scalar field is large enough , which makes the rnads black hole a good test ground to investigate the nonlinear development of superradiant instability .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we introduce the basic setup of a charged massless scalar field in rnads black hole in general @xmath1-dimensions , and derive the linear evolution equation of the perturbation . in sec .",
    "iii , we describe our numerical schemes including the pseudospectral method , runge - kutta method , prony method , and the direct integral method in detail .",
    "we present our numerical results and relevant discussions in sec .",
    "final remarks are made in the last section .",
    "the background spacetime considered in the present paper is the spherically symmetric reissner - nordstrm anti - de sitter black hole in general @xmath5 dimensions , and the metric is given by @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the metric on the unit @xmath8-sphere , and the metric function @xmath9 takes the form @xmath10 the parameters @xmath11 and @xmath12 are related with the mass and charge of the black hole , and @xmath4 is the ads radius , which is related to the cosmological constant @xmath13 by the formula @xmath14 .",
    "this line element ( 1 ) describes the black hole if @xmath15 has two real roots , which correspond to the event horizon @xmath16 and the cauchy horizon @xmath17 , respectively .",
    "in addition , the electric charge @xmath12 of black hole is also constrained by the relation @xmath18 to ensure the positive definiteness of the hawking temperature .",
    "the electromagnetic gauge field @xmath19 of rnads",
    "black hole is given by @xmath20 where the constant @xmath21 can be gauge fixed .",
    "it is argued that this constant just shifts the real part of the quasinormal mode without affecting the imaginary part .",
    "therefore , when studying the superradiant instability below , we can take @xmath22 for convenience .",
    "note also that all physical quantities can be normalized by the ads scale @xmath4 .",
    "so we shall set the ads radius @xmath23 in the following numerical calcualtions .",
    "it turns out to be very useful to adopt the ingoing eddington - finkelstein coordinates in studying the time domain evolution of the perturbation field , which is defined by @xmath24 with @xmath25 being the tortoise coordinate , defined as @xmath26 .",
    "then the metric in the ingoing eddington - finkelstein coordinates reads as @xmath27 and the electromagnetic gauge field in the new coordinates can be written as @xmath28 where we have also performed a gauge transformation to eliminate the space component of gauge field .    for simiplicity , it is sufficient to consider the test scalar field to be charged and massless .",
    "the dynamics is then governed by the klein - gordon equation @xmath29 where @xmath30 denotes the charge of the scalar field .    by taking the ansatz of the scalar field @xmath31 where @xmath32 is a scalar spherical harmonic on the @xmath8-sphere",
    ", the klein - gordon equation is shown to be separable in this background .",
    "after some algebra , we can finally get the following partial differential equation @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the @xmath8-dimensional spherical harmonic eigenvalue .",
    "we can now numerically evolve the scalar field according to this partial differential equation once the initial condition is given .",
    "in the space direction , we introduce a new radial coordinate @xmath35 to transform the spatial domain @xmath36 $ ] to a compact domain @xmath37 $ ] .",
    "it is obvious that the spatial infinity of ads is precisely located at @xmath38 in the new coordinate .",
    "so we can set the boundary condition at the spatial infinity of ads as @xmath39 .",
    "we then expand the scalar field in a basis of chebyshev polynomials in the space direction . the scalar field function is discretized by those values on the gauss - lobatto collocation points .",
    "the spatial derivative of the scalar field can be computed by multiplying the gauss - lobatto derivative matrix .",
    "one can refer to ref.@xcite for a recent review on this method to discretize the space direction , which is usually named as pseudospectral method .",
    "next we use the forth order runge - kutta scheme to integrate the scalar field in time direction . to be more precise , we first evolve the space derivative of the scalar field according to ( [ kg ] ) and then integrate out the scalar field by multiplying the integral matrix .",
    "it should be noted that the integral matrix was constructed according to the aforementioned boundary condition on the boundary of rnads black hole , which is automatically maintained in the whole evolution process .",
    "the initial condition of the scalar field configuration will be chosen as the gaussian wave packet as usual .",
    "it is noteworthy that our method to evolve the perturbation field , namely pseudo - spectral method in the spacial direction supplemented by runge - kutta method in temporal direction , is very different from the usually used finite difference scheme .    in order to extract the quasinormal mode that is dominant in the evolving process",
    ", we use the prony method of fitting the time domain profile data by superposition of damping or growing exponents @xmath40 we consider the late time behavior of the perturbation , which starts at @xmath41 and ends at @xmath42 , where @xmath43 is a integer and @xmath44 .",
    "then the above formula is valid for each value from the profile data @xmath45 the prony method allows us to find @xmath46 in terms of the known @xmath47 , and to calculate out the quasinormal modes @xmath48 since @xmath49 is also known .",
    "the dominant mode is then selected as the one that has the greatest amplitude @xmath50 among the @xmath51 modes we obtained .      for the sake of comparing our time domain analysis with the frequency domain analysis , we shall use the shooting method to calculate the quasinormal mode .",
    "firstly , we take the fourier transformation of our evolution equation ( [ kg ] ) to derive the eigenvalue equation for the quasinormal modes . then by taking the regular boundary condition near the event horizon (",
    "note that the ingoing boundary condition is automatically achieved by this regular boundary condition in the ingoing eddington - finkelstein coordinates ) , we can integrate the eigenvalue equation from a point @xmath52 very close the horizon outwards up to a radial value @xmath53 . similarly , we can also integrate the eigenvalue equation inward from infinity by taking the fall off boundary condition , where the infinity may be taken as @xmath54 .",
    "the obtained two solution at the intermediate radius @xmath53 should satisfy the condition that their wronskian is equal to zero .",
    "then this condition can be used to solve the quasinormal mode in terms of a secant method .",
    "we take different values of @xmath53 to check the numerical accuracy .",
    "we also compare our numerical results for quasinormal modes with those reported in ref.@xcite and @xcite , and find that they are in good agreement .",
    ".quasinormal modes for the 4-dimensional rnads black hole with @xmath55 , and @xmath56 .",
    "the first column gives the values of @xmath57 , where @xmath58 in the present case .",
    "the second column is taken from the time domain analysis by fitting the evolution data using the prony method , while the third column is calculated from the frequency domain analysis by using the direct integration method . [",

    "in this paper , we have studied the long time evolution of charged massless scalar field perturbation in the background of reissner - nordstrm anti - de sitter black hole in general @xmath1 dimensions .",
    "we have adopted pseudo - spectral method and the forth - order runge - kutta method to evolve the scalar field with the initial gaussian wave packet .",
    "it is shown by our numerical scheme that , by fitting the evolution data using the prony method , the obtained dominant mode coincides well with the unstable modes computed from the frequency domain analysis .",
