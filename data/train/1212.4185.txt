    "observations of galaxy clusters provide crucial insight into the development of structure in the universe , from the growth of clusters themselves , to the evolution of their member galaxies .",
    "furthermore , cluster studies yield important constraints on cosmological models through tests of the growth of structure ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the greatest constraining power on cosmological parameters and on the co - evolution of galaxies and clusters requires large , well - controlled samples of clusters out to @xmath6 . to date , a number of techniques have been successfully applied in order to generate such samples of clusters at @xmath7 .",
    "these include approaches based upon detecting galaxy overdensities ( in a combination of apparent colour and sky position ; e.g. @xcite ) , extended x - ray sources ( e.g. @xcite ) and the sunyaev - zeldovich decrement observed toward the cosmic microwave background ( e.g. @xcite ) .    although the systematic estimation of the cluster number density above @xmath6 is an important issue the search for high redshift clusters is made difficult by the faintness of the cluster signal , e.g. small galaxy over - density in optical and near - infrared ( nir ) imaging , weak x - ray emission whose extent is difficult to assess , etc .",
    "however , should x - ray imaging observations of sufficient depth and spatial resolution be executed , the detection of high redshift clusters via spatially - extended emission is advantageous as it provides clear evidence of hot gas confined within a gravitational potential well .",
    "care must be taken though to assess the extent to which faint x - ray active galactic nuclei ( agn ) may mimic or modify the significance and spatial extent of cluster emission and its spectral form ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "systematic searches for high redshift galaxy clusters in x - rays are currently being conducted via dedicated xmm surveys ( xdcp @xcite ; xmm - lss @xcite , this work ; xcs @xcite ) .",
    "these surveys employ quantitative algorithms to identify extended sources and are characterised by accurate selection functions and a clearly defined relationship between cluster observables ( such as x - ray luminosity ) and total cluster mass @xcite .",
    "galaxy clusters at @xmath8 may also be detected by the extension of successful `` red sequence '' searches to near and mid  infrared ( mir ) wavebands in order to detected the redshifted emission from distant galaxies ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "an associated technique employed by the irac shallow cluster survey @xcite identifes clusters to @xmath9 as stellar mass overdensities in multi - band photometric redshift slices .",
    "each mir imaging technique has proven very successful at identifying large numbers of candidate and confirmed clusters .",
    "galaxy clusters at @xmath7 have been employed extensively to study their member galaxy populations and indicate that they are composed of uniformly old stellar populations where the bulk of their stars formed at @xmath10 or greater @xcite .",
    "in addition , low redshift clusters display strong population trends such as the morphology  density relation ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "such relations reflect the dominance of bright , red , bulge - dominated galaxies in cluster cores .",
    "observing clusters at high redshift provides an opportunity to approach the epoch when the progenitors of low - redshift galaxies where assembled .",
    "indeed impressive direct evidence is emerging of both red sequence truncation @xcite and merger driven galaxy assembly @xcite in a mir selected ( yet x - ray detected ) cluster at @xmath11 .",
    "the evolution of the brightest cluster galaxies ( bcgs ) in distant clusters presents a more complex picture : @xcite report that the stellar mass of bcgs in 160 clusters spanning @xmath12 grow steadily with decreasing redshift in a manner consistent with a semi - analytic model . in potential contrast to such evolution in high redshift cluster galaxies , @xcite report that the stellar mass contained in the bcgs of a sample of 20",
    ", @xmath13 clusters has changed little between the epoch of observation and the present day .",
    "such trends observed in heterogeneously assembled samples will be better understood by performing similarly extensive analyses upon a complete sample of high redshift clusters selected employing a single method ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the xmm - lss survey is well placed to contribute to this investigation : covering 11 deg@xmath1 with x - ray imaging to a depth of @xmath14 erg s@xmath15 @xmath16 for extended sources in the [ 0.5 - 2]kev waveband and accompanied by optical and mir photometry .",
    "the xmm - lss project has previously demonstrated the ability to identify clusters to @xmath17 ( @xcite ) and has published @xmath7 cluster number counts selected according to a clear , quantitative selection function ( @xcite ) .",
    "this paper presents the xmm - lss distant cluster sample .",
    "these are defined to be extended x - ray sources at @xmath0 and consist of spectroscopically confirmed clusters together with a number of candidate clusters supported by a detailed photometric redshift analysis .",
    "the distant cluster sample has been identified from the full sample of extended x - ray sources within a 9 deg@xmath1  sub - area of the xmm - lss survey and in this sense it represents a complete sample of x - ray selected distant clusters .",
    "in particular , the methods employed to determine whether a given extended x - ray source is or is not a distant cluster are selected to minimise any potential bias such as the presence of a strong red sequence . in this sense",
    "the sample should be as complete as possible and should provide an unbiased perspective of the galaxy populations in distant x - ray clusters .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows .",
    "section 2 describes the construction of the distant cluster sample ( containing both spectroscopically confirmed and candidate systems ) and the multi - wavelength data sets used to define it in addition to presenting images of the sources in the sample .",
    "section 3 describes the approaches taken to explore which of the candidate systems have clear photometric evidence for being genuine distant clusters .",
    "section 4 discusses the results of applying these approaches and explores the diversity of properties shown by the likely high redshift systems .",
    "this paper employs a friedmann - robertson - walker cosmological model described by the parameters @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 .",
    "an angular scale of 1corresponds to a transverse physical scale of 480 kpc , 508 kpc and 502 kpc at redshifts @xmath21 , 1.5 and 2 respectively .",
    "all photometry is quoted in the ab system .",
    "the xmm - lss survey currently covers approximately 11 deg@xmath1 and is described in @xcite and clerc et al .",
    "galaxy clusters are detected as extended x - ray sources and are classified as either c1 or c2 on the basis of their surface brightness characteristics @xcite .",
    "the effective flux limit is @xmath22erg s@xmath15 @xmath16 for extended sources",
    ".    visual inspection of the x - ray images of individual systems along with their optical and nir images confirm that the c1 class represents an uncontaminated sample of extended x - ray sources ( mainly clusters but with some detections of x - ray halos in very low redshift galaxies , @xcite ) .",
    "the c2 class displays a contamination rate of 30 - 50% , with the main sources of contamination being misclassified point sources and artefacts on the x - ray image .",
    "these contaminants are typically removed by visual inspection of the x - ray image prior to further analysis .",
    "the 11 deg@xmath1 xmm - lss sample contains 50 c1 and 60 c2 sources , of which 44 c1 and 27 c2 sources have confirmed redshifts from optical spectroscopy .",
    "the redshift distribution of confirmed sources ranges over @xmath23 .",
    "the lower spectroscopic confirmation rate for the c2 sources arises due to a ) the lower priority placed on follow - up of such sources compared to c1 sources and b ) the increased difficulty of following up fainter , lower quality detections .",
    "the analysis used to generate the xmm - lss distant cluster sample is based upon a 9 deg@xmath1 subregion of the xmm - lss field .",
    "this region represents the common footprints of the xmm - lss , canada france hawaii telescope legacy survey ( cfhtls ) w1 and spitzer swire 3.6 and 4.5@xmath24 surveys and contains 88 c1@xmath25c2 sources ( of which 55 have spectroscopic redshifts ) .",
    "nir imaging drawn from a variety of sources ( i.e. the ukidss and wirds surveys in addition to individual cfht / wircam and vlt / hawki images ) exists for many of the spectroscopically confirmed and candidate distant systems , with the available bands and depth varying on a source - by source basis .",
    "the principal data sets and their processing are described below .",
    "the characterisation and measurement of extended sources in the xmm - lss survey is described in detail in @xcite and @xcite and we summarise the important features of the analysis here .",
    "sources are detected above a specified pixel threshold by appliying the sextractor routine to a multi - scale wavelet reconstruction of the xmm science image .",
    "individual sources are characterised as either extended or point - like on the basis of the likelihood values of appropriate models applied to each source .",
    "taking the example of an extended source , nearby point - sources identified individually by the detection algorithm are masked when performing the source extended fit using the sextractor segmentation map @xcite .",
    "therefore the extent likelihood used for c1/c2 classification is almost free from contamination by bright point sources .",
    "faint point - sources contaminating the extended source emission and not deblended by the algorithm may be present , particularly in regions close to the cluster centre .",
    "accounting for them is challenging given the faintness of our objects and their compactness relative to xmm point spread function .",
    "we compute x - ray fluxes for the extended sources associated with spectroscopically confirmed and candidate clusters in the [ 0.5 - 2 ] kev band employing the procedure outlined in @xcite .",
    "the method applies a curve - of - growth analysis to the x - ray count rate data which confers the advantage of being free of any profile assumptions applied to the extended x - ray source .",
    "we estimate that the application of a finite size aperture used for these measurements recovers 80 - 90% of the total count rate of the cluster and we note that this bias is lower than the statistical error of our measurements .",
    "the flux measurement step allows a further check for additional blended emission .",
    "point sources lying close to but off the cluster central region are either identified by the detection algorithm or flagged visually . in both cases their contribution to the total flux is excluded from the extraction region , and the missing area is accounted for by assuming a circularly symmetric flux profile . the fluxes were obtained assuming a fixed conversion factor of @xmath26 .",
    "this value was calculated using xspec from an apec emission model with the following parameters : @xmath21 , @xmath27 kev , @xmath28 , @xmath29 ( note that the conversion factor changes by less than 5% for @xmath30 and @xmath27 kev ) .",
    "bolometric luminosities were calculated with xspec employing the measured fluxes , the cluster redshift ( quoted in table [ tab_clus ] ) and the fitted cluster temperature ( @xcite ) or assuming @xmath27 kev if no temperature was available . flux and luminosity values for each cluster are listed in table [ tab_clus ] .      as noted above ,",
    "most of the data used in this analysis are taken from existing large area surveys which cover part or all of the xmm - lss region .",
    "descriptions of the cfhtls and spitzer swire data used in the paper are described in gwyn ( 2012 ) and chiappetti et al .",
    "( 2012 ) respectively .",
    "large area nir survey data provided @xmath31 , @xmath32 and/or @xmath33-band imaging for a number of the c1 and c2 @xmath0 candidates .",
    "these data came from either the ukidss deep extragalactic survey ( dxs dr8 ; see * ? ? ? * ) or the wircam deep survey ( wirds ; * ? ? ?",
    "typical depths ( @xmath34 ) for these data are @xmath35 ( dxs ) and @xmath36 ( wirds ) .",
    "nir imaging data for the remaining sources in the distant cluster sample were obtained with principal investigator programs using vlt / hawki and cfht / wircam and are described below .",
    "details of the available multi - wavelength photometry for each @xmath0 system , both candidate and confirmed , are given in table [ tab_clus ] .",
    ".distant clusters in the xmm - lss survey .",
    "these sources represent all c1@xmath25c2 sources ( section 2 ) within the approximately 9 deg@xmath1 xmm - lss / chftls / swire footprint that can not be unambiguously associated with a @xmath37 cluster or galaxy .",
    "spectroscopically confirmed distant clusters are displayed in the upper section of the table and have their redshift values indicated .",
    "each is also described by an official xlssc identifier .",
    "candidate distant clusters are displayed in the middle section of the table and their photometric redshift values ( where computed ) are indicated with accompanying uncertainty .",
    "unknown sources are displayed in the lower section of the table and do not have a redshift value .",
    "each cluster is further identified using a sequential number ( column 1 ) to simplify their discussion in this paper . in subseqent publications that refer to these sources ,",
    "we recommend using either the cluster names or the xlssc numbers which are the only iau validated labelings .",
    "the procedures used to compute the x - ray flux and luminosity measures are described in section 2.1 .",
    "[ cols=\"^,<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ , < , < , < \" , ]",
    "the aim of this paper is to present a complete sample of extended x - ray sources with redshifts @xmath0 .",
    "the motivation for generating a complete sample essentially centres upon the assertion that , only by generating a complete sample of x - ray selected @xmath0 clusters can one a ) compare the abundance of distant clusters to a cosmological model prediction in quantitative manner and b ) discuss the range of galaxy properties exhibited by the member population in a relatively unbiased way . constructing a complete sample",
    "ultimately requires providing a robust explanation of the nature of every extended x - ray source in the sample area .",
    "though it is the aim of the xmm - lss survey to confirm spectroscopically all extended c1 and c2 sources , this remains an observationally challenging prospect at this stage .",
    "the methodology of this paper is therefore to employ the available photometric data to direct the detailed follow - up of individual clusters ( e.g. deep nir imaging and spectroscopic observations ) towards extended sources that show compelling evidence for being a bona - fide cluster above some redshift threshold .",
    "the threshold of @xmath0 applied in this paper was defined in response to largely practical considerations , e.g. given the depth of available optical data , experience indicated that all clusters at @xmath37 could be recognised with little ambiguity .",
    "a threshold of @xmath0 ( as opposed to a larger value ) generated a final sample containing approximately 20 distant clusters which was deemed large enough that evolution of cluster galaxy properties such as red sequence colour and population mix could be traced within the sample rather than via reference to other cluster samples selected possibly using alternative techniques .",
    "finally a threshold of @xmath0 corresponds to a look back time of approximately 7 gyr and accords with the redshift definition applied to distant clusters in the literature .",
    "we summarise below the steps employed to evaluate the robustness ( or otherwise ) of the evidence pointing to a high redshift identification for each candidate :    * classify visually all c1/c2 sources based on @xmath38 and @xmath39 images .",
    "identify potentially distant systems and reject misclassified point sources . *",
    "compute the surface density of galaxies along the line of sight to each source that satisfy photometric selection criteria appropriate for identifying @xmath0 galaxies .",
    "compare to the visual classification results as a check .",
    "* compute the colour of galaxy overdensities along the line of sight to each source and compare to the expected colour of model galaxies as a test of the distant cluster hypothesis . *",
    "compute photometric redshifts for galaxies along the line of sight to distant cluster candidates with available multi - wavelength photometry .",
    "identify photometric redshift peaks spatially associated with the location of the extended x - ray source . *",
    "obtain where possible spectroscopic observations of distant cluster candidates with @xmath40 with the aim of confirming at least 3 concordant redshifts within the sky area giving rise to the extended x - ray emission .",
    "the first step is straightforward and is carried out on all c1 and c2 sources in the 9 deg@xmath1 xmm - lss / cfhtls / swire field .",
    "the cfhtls and swire fields containing each c1 and c2 x - ray source were inspected visually , in order to identify any obvious clustering at or close to the x - ray position .",
    "images in individual bands and pseudo - true colour images ( @xmath41 and @xmath42 ) were used in this process .",
    "this step was performed by up to six people and the final classification was subject to the decision of two moderators .",
    "visual inspection is relatively rapid to perform and provides useful information on the broad nature of each x - ray source e.g. bright , clustered galaxies consistent with a low redshift cluster , a misclassified point source , or a significant , extended x - ray source with at best a grouping of faint , red galaxies consistent with being a high - redshift cluster .",
    "however , visual classification is likely to provide only an imprecise estimate of the redshift of each system . in practice ,",
    "though all 88 c1@xmath25c2 sources were inspected visually , the classification efforts were focussed on the 33/88 c1@xmath25c2 sources lacking a secure spectroscopic identification .    of these 33 sources",
    ", 12 displayed convincing evidence for being a cluster at a redshift sufficiently below @xmath43 to be a secure classification ( figure [ fig_ex_loz ] provides an image of a typical system ) .",
    "the remaining sources displayed either a ) weak or absent optical emission with an identifiable clustering of 3.6  sources , b ) a clear case of a misclassified point source , or c ) a weak , yet potentially extended x - ray source with no identifiable overdensity of galaxies at 3.6 .",
    "of these classes of objects , those in group ( a ) are retained as candidate @xmath0 clusters ( we note at this stage that the visual classification may include sources at @xmath37 but the philosophy at this stage is that any cut avoid being conservative ) .",
    "sources in group ( c ) could either represent false detections resulting from the x - ray pipeline or potentially very distant x - ray clusters with little evidence of galaxy clustering at any wavelength . in either case ,",
    "the prospects for spectroscopic confirmation of such systems are exceptionally poor and   as they represent at best 1 or 2 systems out of a sample of 88   are not retained as candidate distant clusters at this stage .",
    "this simple sifting can work to at least @xmath17 as the highest redshift xmm - lss cluster xlssc 046 @xcite is straightforwardly selected in this way with an obvious compact overdensity of @xmath44 galaxies at the x - ray position with no bright optical counterparts ( see figure [ fig_bremer ] ) .",
    "however , at high redshifts whether a cluster is straightforwardly identifiable depends on several factors affecting its surface density contrast against the background and foreground galaxies .",
    "if the foreground / background density in the @xmath17 cluster field had been higher and the spatial distribution of red cluster galaxies less compact ( spread over a 1  radius region rather than the 15  radius of the detected overdensity ) , the system would have been harder to discern in this way .",
    "two exceptions to this process are clusters 06 and 19 .",
    "cluster 06 lies at the very edge of the swire footprint and has data available at 3.6  but not 4.5 .",
    "cluster candidate 19 lies just outside the swire footprint yet had previously been flagged as a high redshift candidate on the basis of the extended x - ray image and faint , @xmath45-band detection of the candidate bcg .",
    "we include it in the following discussion and in table [ tab_clus ] yet do not include it in the number of systems quoted in the @xmath0 area limited sample .",
    "the visual classification supported by the existing spectroscopic observations populates each cluster class as follows : spectroscopically confirmed or candidate clusters at @xmath37 , 57 ( `` @xmath37 clusters '' hereafter ) ; spectroscopically confirmed clusters at @xmath0 , 9 ( see figure [ fig_spec_rzi1 ] ; `` confirmed clusters '' hereafter ) ; candidate clusters at @xmath0 , 14 ( see figure [ fig_cand_rzi1 ] ; `` candidate clusters '' hereafter ) ; point - like or marginal sources with no clear identification , 8 , ( see figure [ fig_dud_rzi1 ] ; `` unknown extended sources '' hereafter ) .      following the visual inspection , the colours of galaxies in all fields , whether or not identified as clustered from initial inspection , are examined in order to identify any clustering in both position and colour .",
    "these colours , given data of suitable depth , can provide an indication of the redshift of the system .",
    "the photometric analysis employs the @xmath46 and @xmath47 colours derived from the cfhtls and spitzer / irac data .",
    "these colours have been proven to select for distant cluster galaxy populations ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . with data of sufficient depth",
    ", the use of the @xmath47 colour is particularly powerful as it is a strong function of redshift between @xmath48 for galaxies with a wide range of star formation histories and the scatter in colour between histories is relatively small ( see * ? ? ?",
    "for all clusters , the surface density of galaxies within 1  of the x - ray position with @xmath49 and ( independently ) @xmath50 and @xmath47@xmath51 was computed . for 3.6  sources",
    "that are undetected in @xmath52 ( approximately @xmath53 ) the computed colour is a lower limit on the true colour .",
    "these values were compared to those computed for the @xmath37 clusters and 1000 randomly placed apertures over the survey area .",
    "figure [ fig_apc ] displays these values for all c1 and c2 clusters and cluster candidates in the 9 deg@xmath1  area .",
    "as expected , the spectroscopically confirmed distant clusters are in the top - right of the distribution , along with many of the candidates .",
    "this is evidence that at least a subset of the candidates are at redshifts similar to , or even higher than , those of the spectroscopically confirmed clusters , with the candidate fields having a higher surface density of sources with the reddest @xmath47 colours than the spectroscopically confirmed @xmath0 clusters .",
    "the separation of cluster classes indicated in figure [ fig_apc ] is supported by a two - sided kolmogorov - smirnov ( ks ) analysis of the surface density values ( in this case using @xmath46 colours ) .",
    "a ks test between the @xmath37 cluster sample and the 1000 random apertures result in a probability that the two samples are drawn from the same population of 0.74 , which is sensible given the photometric criteria are designed to be sensitive to @xmath0 galaxies .",
    "the corresponding ks probabilities between the @xmath0 sample ( confirmed and candidates ) and the @xmath37 clusters , the random apertures and the unknown sources are @xmath54 , @xmath55 and @xmath56 respectively   thus confirming the trend observed in figure [ fig_apc ] .",
    "however , some overlap remains between the visually - assigned classes . for the low- versus high - redshift sources",
    "this is partly due to the fact that photometric uncertainties will result in low redshift galaxies exceeding the applied colour cut and vice versa ",
    "this blurring is expected to be most evident for clusters close to the effective redshift cut - off implied by the photometric criteria .",
    "in addition , while it is unlikely that any of the 57 @xmath37 clusters are at @xmath0 we do note that two of the @xmath0 candidate clusters ultimately result in photometric redshift estimates slightly less than @xmath43 .",
    "in general though , when considering the @xmath0 candidate clusters and the unknown extended sources the surface density analysis indicates that the optical - mir data can not provide an unambiguous assessment of these systems . put another way , there is no straightforward threshold that can be applied to the surface density of optical - mir selected galaxies along the line of sight to the extended x - ray source sample that will generate a complete sample of candidate distant cluster candidates with low contamination .",
    "we address this point further in section [ discuss ] .",
    "in addition to computing the surface density of faint , red galaxies , colour magnitude diagrams ( cmds ) and colour histograms in both @xmath46 and @xmath47 were created for the confirmed and candidate @xmath0 clusters and compared to the background colour distribution ( e.g. see figure [ fig_cmd_col_hist ] ) . assuming that a cluster contains a significant number of passively - evolving galaxies , the presence of a red sequence should confirm a cluster identification and the characteristics of that sequence",
    "should indicate an estimated redshift for the cluster when compared to stellar population models ( figure [ fig_hiz_2col ] ) .",
    "the analysis indicates that the confirmed clusters , located at @xmath2 , display red sequence colours broadly consistent with the expectation of a simple model of an old , passively evolving stellar population considered at the confirmed spectroscopic redshift ( see figure [ fig_hiz_2col ] for further details ) .",
    "a number of the candidate clusters at @xmath0 also display red sequences consistent with the expectation of a high redshift passive stellar population .",
    "however , it is also clear that a subset of the candidate clusters do not display red sequence colours consistent with this simple model of a high redshift stellar population ",
    "specifically they appear to be systematically bluer in @xmath46 than the expected colour for @xmath57 .",
    "this effect can be understood by noting ( as indicated in figure [ fig_cmd_col_hist ] ) that a number of sources detected at 3.6  in the candidate clusters are undetected in cfhtls w1 @xmath52-band data .",
    "the indicated @xmath46 red sequence colours are therefore lower limits and will underestimate the true colour .",
    "a further limitation is that the @xmath47 red sequence colour is largely degenerate with redshift at @xmath58 .",
    "the above steps indicate ( often strongly ) that each confirmed and candidate cluster is associated with an overdensity of galaxies consistent with @xmath0 . however ,",
    "although the optical and mir imaging data are effective at determining the presence of over - densities of high - redshift galaxies they only provide limited information on the redshift associated with the red sequence location .      having searched for evidence of red sequences in colour magnitude diagrams ( cmds ) , we extend our analysis by removing the assumption that any distant cluster galaxy population has a significant red sequence , and allow the possibility that the galaxies associated with a cluster can have a range of spectral energy distributions corresponding to a range of star formation histories .",
    "we use the public code le phare @xcite to estimate the photometric redshifts .",
    "le phare is based on a standard template fitting procedure .",
    "the templates are redshifted and integrated through the appropriate transmission curves .",
    "the photometric redshifts are obtained by comparing the modelled fluxes and the observed fluxes with a @xmath59 merit function .",
    "we run the code using exactly the same configuration as used in the cosmos field @xcite .",
    "the set of templates was generated by @xcite for the elliptical and spiral galaxies .",
    "twelve blue templates generated with @xcite were added .",
    "four different dust extinction laws were applied @xcite , and an additional bump at 2175 , depending on the considered template .",
    "emission lines were added to the templates using relations between the uv continuum , the star formation rate and the emission line fluxes @xcite .",
    "moreover , an automatic calibration of the zero - points was performed using a sample of 650 spectroscopic redshifts within the photometric data area drawn from the xmm - lss sample described by @xcite .",
    "the calibration is obtained by comparing the observed and modelled fluxes @xcite at known spectroscopic redshifts .",
    "having demonstrated that the optical and mir colours of candidate @xmath0 galaxies provide only a relatively inaccurate estimate of the redshift of a given confirmed or candidate cluster , the photometric redshift analysis described here is limited to those confirmed and candidate clusters with additional nir photometry in at least the @xmath31 and @xmath60 bands ( see table [ tab_clus ] for a list of clusters with @xmath61 photometry ) . at @xmath0 the @xmath61 bands sample the rest frame optical spectral energy distribution ( sed ) including the prominent d4000 feature which provides a strong @xmath61 colour signature   and thus strong constraining power in a photometric redshift analysis   as a function of redshift for galaxies composed of evolved stellar populations .",
    "figure [ fig:3panel ] displays the photometric redshift histograms for all clusters with available @xmath61 data . for clusters with spectroscopic redshifts ,",
    "data are plotted for all galaxies within 30  of the x - ray source that are brighter than the @xmath60-band completeness limit of each data set ( see section [ sec_nir ] ) . for clusters with photometric redshifts ( see below ) @xmath62 and @xmath63 , data are plotted for all galaxies within 1  and 30  respectively of each x - ray source that are brighter than the corresponding @xmath60-band completeness limit .",
    "we represent the redshift density function for each cluster using both a standard histogram ( @xmath64 ) and a variable kernel density estimation ( vkde ) approach .",

    "we apply the method outlined by @xcite whereby one identifies the third reddest galaxy in each cmd ( 3rg ) and selects galaxies displaying @xmath73 colours within @xmath74 .",

    "we apply this method to all confirmed and candidate clusters with @xmath73 imaging and display the resulting @xmath75 and @xmath79 values in figure [ fig_jmkred ] . for cluster 19 we set @xmath75 equal to the colour of the candidate bcg and @xmath80 . in many cases",
    "this approach identifies a viable , yet often poorly populated , red sequence .",
    "however , we note that this approach does not identify a clear red sequence for candidate clusters 16 , 17 and 18 .",
    "we address this result in more detail in the section [ backsub ] .    for those clusters displaying a clear red sequence consistent with @xmath75 and @xmath79",
    "we compare the red sequence colour versus redshift data to a set of representative colour - redshift loci generated using the bc03 spectral synthesis code @xcite .",
    "the plot indicates that the location of the putative red sequences of the confirmed and candidate clusters follow a clear locus in colour - redshift space that can be described by the simple passive evolution of an old stellar population .",
    "we do not attempt to fit the stellar population parameters best describing the data beyond noting that solar metallicity models arising from a 1 gyr burst of star formation at @xmath81 appear to be favoured over either extended ( @xmath82 gyr ) , sub - solar ( @xmath83 ) or younger ( @xmath84 ) bursts of star formation .",
    "it is worth noting at this point that the strength of this conclusion rests upon the red sequence colours of the candidate clusters at @xmath85 . in one sense",
    "this demonstrates the important leverage that distant clusters place upon our knowledge of galaxy evolution in dense environments . in another sense",
    "however , this result can only be viewed as tentative pending spectroscopic confirmation of these clusters .",
    "an alternative approach to identifying the red sequence of candidate cluster galaxies is to investigate their distribution directly on the colour magnitude plane .",
    "the main issue is to isolate the potentially weak cluster signature from the `` background '' of non - cluster galaxies along the line of sight . to achieve this we bin the colour magnitude distribution of galaxies located within 1  of each cluster x - ray centroid .",
    "galaxies are binned on the @xmath73 versus @xmath60 plane with bin dimensions of 0.2 and 0.5 mag . respectively .",
    "the cmd of non - cluster galaxies ( termed the model background here ) is formed by selecting all sources at @xmath86 from each cluster or cluster candidate and scaling the resulting distribution by the relative cluster and background sky areas .",
    "although the resulting background subtracted cmd for each cluster displays an identifiable overdensity of faint , red galaxies , the signal is accompanied by variations in the true background associated with each cluster ( both poisson and cosmic in nature ) . upon subtraction of the scaled model background",
    "these variations persist as residual positive and negative signatures .",
    "however , their statistical distribution should average to zero over all cluster fields and , in an attempt to reduce their impact , we stack the binned subtracted cmds to investigate the average cluster cmd . prior",
    "to stacking we shift each cluster distribution on the colour magnitude plane to account for the @xmath87-correction and distance dimming of an evolving stellar population at each cluster redshift .",
    "we correct each cluster to a common redshift applying an apparent colour and magnitude shift based upon the evolution of a 1 gyr solar metallicity burst of star formation occuring at @xmath88 and described by a salpeter imf . using this same model",
    "we have confirmed that the colour terms between the different nir filter systems employed are small compared to the photometric zero point errors for each cluster .",
    "we stack all cluster and cluster canditates as follows : spectroscopically confirmed clusters at @xmath0 ( 5 systems ) , cluster candidates at @xmath89 ( 4 ) , cluster candidates at @xmath63 either with a clear red sequence ( 4 ) or without ( 3 , i.e. clusters 16 , 17 and 18 ) .",
    "we also stack the cmd of six control fields constructed in order to test the null hypothesis that each cluster candidate is false .",
    "we take the location of six clusters observed with hawk - i and shift the cluster centroid to an adjacent detector ( approximately a 3  shift ) .",
    "we then repeat the stacking procedure using these new centroids and apply the same colour and magnitude shifts applied to galaxies selected according the original cluster locations .",
    "figure [ fig : chist ] displays the colour histrogram generated from each stack by summing the cmd along the magnitude axis with the restriction @xmath90 , for @xmath91 , or @xmath92 otherwise , to consider the photometrically complete region of the cmd . figure [ fig : chist ] confirms that there is little difference in the intrinsic red sequence properties between spectroscopically confirmed clusters at @xmath93 and the candidate clusters .",
    "more importantly , the subset of candidate clusters lacking apparent red sequences on the basis of photometric redshift selection have been shown to have average red sequences statistically identical to the remainder of the candidate sample following the stacking analysis .",
    "we speculate that these clusters display a range of star formation histories that are not well described by the available sed templates used in the photometric redshift analysis .",
    "the resulting photometric redshift peak will be broadened by this systematic uncertainty and attempting to select cluster galaxies using the photometric redshift method described in this paper will result in a greater level of background contamination relative to clusters with well modeled seds .",
    "thus the already weak red sequence may be diluted further by the increased effective background along these sightlines .",
    "this effect can only be verified once spectroscopic redshifts are available for these clusters .",
    "all of the stacked cluster colour distributions are clearly real and significant when compared to the null distribution . for the clusters without an individual red sequence",
    "the fact that only 3 systems contribute to the average supports the assertion that the majority ( if not all ) are real as otherwise the signal observed in the average histogram would be very much diluted . we therefore conclude that each of the clusters presented in this sample is real in that the extended x - ray source is associated with a galaxy population clustered both spatially and in colour , whose spectra , photometric redshifts and/or colours are consistent with @xmath0 .",
    "the cluster red fraction provides a simple statement of the population mix of cluster galaxy members selected by colour and magnitude .",
    "it is conceptually identical to the cluster blue fraction computed by butcher and oemler ( 1984 ) yet here we focus on the the red galaxy component in order to highlight the contribution of the cluster red sequence to each cluster in our sample .",
    "we compute the red fraction as the ratio @xmath94 where @xmath95 denotes the number of galaxies satisfying @xmath96 and @xmath60 brighter than a evolving model early - type galaxy .",
    "the model assumes a galaxy of @xmath97 at @xmath30 described by a 1gyr solar metallicity burst of star formation occurring at @xmath88 and described by a salpeter imf .",
    "the corresponding @xmath60 limit at the redshift of each cluster is computed accordingly .",
    "@xmath98 denotes the total number of galaxies satisfying the appropriate magnitude limit .",
    "@xmath99 includes all galaxies within 1  of the x - ray centroid and @xmath100 includes all galaxies at greater than 1  from the cluster centroid with the value scaled to match the relative areas of the cluster and background samples .",
    "the red fraction values for all confirmed and candidate clusters with @xmath73 photometry are displayed in figure [ fig_red_frac ] .",
    "the figure indicates that the cluster sample displays a range of red fraction values ranging from clusters almost wholly dominated by the red sequence ( @xmath101 ) to those with low values , i.e. @xmath102 . the observation of a wide range of red fraction values supports the assertion that the compilation of a complete sample of x - ray selected distant clusters can provide a relatively unbiased view of galaxy populations in such systems .",
    "a comparable analysis of the red fractions in a non - x - ray selected distant cluster sample has not yet been performed   which is unfortunate as the results of such a study would provide a valuable perspective on the wavelength dependent biases affecting distant cluster identification .",
    "the range of red fraction values displayed by the distant cluster sample is similar in extent to that of comparable mass clusters at redshifts @xmath103 @xcite also studied within the xmm - lss survey ( note that we discuss mass estimation based upon x - ray flux measurements in section [ sec_xflux ] ) .",
    "however , the xmm - lss distant clusters will increase in mass by a factor @xmath104 between a redshift @xmath30 and @xmath105 @xcite .",
    "such low redshift clusters of mass @xmath106 typically display dominant , bright red sequence populations with @xmath107 .",
    "if one assumes that the evolution of galaxies onto the red sequence occurs following the rapid cessation of star formation ( quenching ) ",
    "for example as a result of ram pressure stripping @xcite or galaxy - galaxy interactions @xcite   then the large observed range of red fraction values displayed by the xmm - lss distant cluster is consistent with the scenario whereby the galaxy populations have been caught in a variety of states transforming between active star forming environments ( where the red fraction is low and comparable to that of the field ) to a `` red and dead '' environment typified by @xmath7 massive clusters .",
    "a key motivation for identifying the most distant clusters is to determine their global properties and thereby reveal the details of cluster evolution .",
    "one of the most important properties is the total cluster mass .",
    "unfortunately , this is not observable directly but it can , with certain assumptions , be determined from other observables including the x - ray flux ( luminosity ) of a system . while one could employ well - studied scaling relations at @xmath7 in order to convert a flux measurement to one of mass ,",
    "the extrapolation of these scaling relations to @xmath8 is fraught with uncertainty .",
    "we therefore adopt an alternative approach whereby we compare the x - ray flux observed from clusters of known redshift ( either spectroscopic or photometric ) to the flux expected from a model cluster of specified properites .",
    "this approach offers the reassurance that the model assumptions are defined and compared to the two observables ( flux and redshift ) in as clear a manner as possible .",
    "figure [ fig_xflux_redshift ] compares the flux values for individual clusters to the flux of model clusters computed as a function of cluster mass and redshift .",
    "the model assumes the luminosity - temperature relation of @xcite with self - similar evolution .",
    "the mass - temperature relation is taken from @xcite with @xmath108 and massive clusters ( extrapolated down to the entire mass range ) with self - similar evolution .",
    "a comparison of the flux values for the individual clusters to the model indicates that the clusters display an approximate mass limit of @xmath109 to @xmath110 .",
    "all clusters display masses inferred from this comparison less than @xmath111 .",
    "we refer to this as the baseline model in the following text .",
    "it is clear that adopting a different set of model assumptions will affect the mass estimates returned by the above analysis .",
    "figure [ flux_redshift_compare_self ] examines the extent to which adopting an alternative set of scaling relations influences the estimated cluster mass .",
    "we retain the assumption that scaling laws evolve in a self - similar manner and compare two alternative approaches to our baseline model described above ( figure [ flux_redshift_compare_self ] ; black solid lines ) : 1 ) a model which replaces the @xmath112 relation for a @xmath113 relation taken from sun et al .",
    "( 2009 ) , valid down to 1 kev , and assuming the @xmath114 relation described by pratt et al .",
    "( 2009 ) , see figure [ flux_redshift_compare_self ] ( blue dotted lines ) .",
    "model 2 ) considers the flux - redshift relation for self - similar clusters following the scaling laws described in vikhlinin et al .",
    "( 2009 ) ",
    "see figure [ flux_redshift_compare_self ] ( red dashed lines ) .",
    "each of these alternative models generates mass estimates for clusters of given flux and redshift which are a generally a factor 2 lower than those generated applying the baseline model .",
    "figure [ flux_redshift_compare_evol ] examines the extent to which allowing a given scaling relation to evolve with redshift affects the estimated cluster mass .",
    "once again , the black lines in figure [ flux_redshift_compare_evol ] indicate the baseline model described by self - similar evolution .",
    "alternative evolution prescriptions include that of reichert et al .",
    "( 2011 ; blue dots ) , clerc et al . ( 2012 ; red dashed ) and the evolving scaling relations derived by vikhlinin et al .",
    "( 2009 ; green dot - dash ) . in this case , introducing alternative assumptions regarding the evolution of scaling relations can generate mass estimates for clusters of given flux and redshift which are up to a factor 2 - 4 greater than those generated applying the baseline model .",
    "the above considerations indicate that models which consider potential variations in cluster scaling relations and their evolution can generate mass estimates for @xmath0 clusters which vary by up to an order of magnitude . however , given the shape of the contours displayed in figures [ fig_xflux_redshift ] , [ flux_redshift_compare_self ] , and [ flux_redshift_compare_evol ] it is apparent that the _ relative _ masses of the @xmath0 clusters are likely to be robust against uncertainties in the assumed cluster scaling relation model .",
    "having compiled a sample of @xmath0 confirmed and candidate clusters it is instructive to compare their observed abundance to the number predicted using a calculation based upon all relevant cosmological , cluster scaling relation and selection considerations .",
    "we computed the expected abundance of distant clusters by assuming a @xcite redshift - dependent mass function .",
    "these authors provide a functional form of the halo mass distribution calibrated using numerical simulations up to @xmath115 . for this calculation , we assume @xmath116 @xcite .",
    "halo masses are then converted from @xmath117 to @xmath118 following @xcite assuming a nfw mass profile and a concentration model from @xcite .",
    "the conversion from masses to x - ray observables is performed based upon the same baseline @xmath119 and @xmath120 scaling laws as quoted above .",
    "we assume a scatter of @xmath121 in the @xmath120 relation .",
    "both scaling laws are assumed to evolve self - similarly . the xmm - lss c1+c2 selection function @xcite accounts for the probability of detecting a cluster given its x - ray observables , namely its [ 0.5 - 2 ] kev count - rate and its apparent core radius ( corresponding to a @xmath122 model with @xmath123 ) .",
    "for this purpose , model count - rates are estimated assuming an apec spectral model with abundance @xmath124 .",
    "the core radius is assumed to scale with the halo radius following a simple scaling relation @xcite : @xmath125 .",
    "the final expected redshift distribution is integrated in various redshift bins : we predict 28.5 clusters lying at @xmath0 , 5.2 at @xmath126 and 2.5 at @xmath85 in 9 deg@xmath1 of surveyed area . by comparison ,",
    "the sample of high redshift clusters presented in this work consists of up to 22 , 7 and 6 clusters at @xmath127 , @xmath128 and @xmath129 respectively , thus showing a rough agreement with model predictions .",
    "however we note a slight ( @xmath130 ) excess of @xmath85 clusters in our sample .",
    "if confirmed , this excess could be due either to an overestimate of photometric redshifts or to a unaccounted selection bias that would arise due to e.g. an increased contamination of the x - ray flux from unresolved agns in these objects .",
    "furthermore , model uncertainties also impact the predicted number of high - redshift clusters .",
    "in particular , relaxing the self - similarity constraint on the evolution of the cluster mass - luminosity relation can lead to considerably different predictions @xcite .",
    "a further comparison of interest is that between the surface density of xmm - lss distant clusters and that of other x - ray selected distant cluster samples present in the literature .",
    "the surface density of @xmath0 clusters in the xmm - lss survey is @xmath131 above a nominal mass limit of @xmath132 .",
    "this may be compared to a figure of 15 @xmath133 clusters in approximately 1 deg@xmath1 reported by @xcite above a mass limit of @xmath132 in addition @xcite present a compilation of 22 @xmath134 clusters detected in up to 79 deg@xmath1 of archival xmm observations with a mass limit of @xmath135 ( though specific details regarding the selection function are currently unavailable ) .",
    "the surface density of clusters reported in @xcite lies between 0.3 and 1.3 @xmath136 with the exact value depending upon the subset of xmm observations analysed .",
    "we note that the @xcite compilation containes two previoulsy published xmm - lss clusters with the result that this comparison is largely but not completely independent .",
    "the variance observed in these reported surface densities arises from differences in the techniques applied to select extended x - ray sources , confirm galaxy overdensities and subsequently compute photometric redshifts or to compile spectroscopic redshifts .",
    "a further point worth noting is that distant clusters are often detected in survey data originally compiled to study galaxy clusters at @xmath7 . as such",
    ", they represent a subset of marginal detections and whether they are subsequently classified and confirmed as distant clusters is a very sensitive function of the set of selection tests applied to the data . with this in mind",
    "we have attempted to generate a complete sample of distant x - ray clusters in a manner that depends solely upon the x - ray data by performing an analysis of all extended sources in a subset of the xmm - lss area .",
    "one can not completely escape the requirement of input from other wavebands , e.g. the optical , nir and mir data employed in this paper .",
    "however , we have attempted as far as possible to select galaxy overdensities associated with each extended x - ray source in a manner which is insensitive to the assumed star formation history of individual galaxies .    more detailed follow - up of individual clusters , including spectroscopic and deeper x - ray imaging observations",
    "are currently underway . ultimately combining the precise redshift measurements into a self - consistent analysis including selection effects and model uncertainties @xcite",
    ", we will be able to draw firm conclusions from the abundance of high - redshift clusters .",
    "the analysis presented in this paper effectively completes the assessment of 88 extended c1 and c2 sources from approximately 9 deg@xmath1 of xmm - lss data . of these sources 59 display spectroscopic or photometric redshifts @xmath37 , 21 sources display spectroscopic or photometric redshifts @xmath0 ( or colours consistent with the same redshift limit in the case of candidate clusters 23 and 24 ) , and a remaining 8 sources appear to be consistent with misclassified point sources or marginal detections .",
    "the sample also contains cluster 19 at a photometric redshift @xmath137 which is included in this paper having been flagged as a potential distant cluster at an earlier stage .",
    "the distant cluster sample is complete in that it represents ( with the low - redshift and marginal source identifications ) a complete account of a 9 deg@xmath1 area of the xmm - lss survey .",
    "this sample is generated from the x - ray data employing a quantitative selection function @xcite and it therefore permits a number of important questions in cosmology and galaxy evolution to be investigated .",
    "the complete nature of this sample is dependent upon the primacy of the applied x - ray selection procedures .",
    "although it is difficult to conceive of a targeted x - ray survey for distant clusters that does not employ information at additional wavebands ( e.g. optical , mir , etc . ) , the application of a simple selection threshold to identify high - significance clusters in these additional wavebands ( e.g. the surface density of optical - mir selected sources ) will either lead to an incomplete x - ray sample or a large rate of contamination ( from low - redshift or spurious sources ) , c.f .",
    "figure [ fig_apc ] .",
    "these comments do not undermine the nature of optical - mir selected samples of distant clusters   which are complete in terms of the applied selection criteria .",
    "instead they reflect the fact that distant x - ray detected clusters must be confirmed at other wavebands . in doing so with this paper",
    "we have attempted to perform as comprehensive an assessment as possible of each confirmed and candidate system with the aim of compiling a complete sample of x - ray selected distant clusters .",
    "it is important to recognise that the analysis presented in this paper represents only one stage in the creation a complete sample of distant x - ray clusters .",
    "clearly , much of the interpretation as to the nature of each cluster rests upon the photometric redshift analysis and spectroscopic confirmation of the redshifts of these clusters must be considered as the next , important step .",
    "furthermore , the extent to which point source emission from unresolved agn ( both within each cluster and superposed along the line of sight ) modifies the appearance of a sample of distant x - ray clusters is not well understood .",
    "we intend to employ the superior angular resolution of the chandra observatory to characterise the point source contribution to a representative sub - sample of the distant clusters presented in this paper .",
    "only when these steps are complete will we have a better understanding of what constitutes a complete , robust sample of distant clusters .",
    "this xmm - lss distant cluster sample represents an important resource and will form the basis for studies in both the growth of large scale structure and the evolution of cluster galaxies to be presented in forthcoming papers .",
