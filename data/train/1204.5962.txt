    ", the entanglement entropy shows the feature of the second order phase transition : the entanglement entropy is continuous and its slop has a jump at the critical temperature . on the order hand , in the case of first order phase transition , there exists not only a jump for the entanglement entropy at the critical temperature , but also a kink shape ( swallowtail shape ) for the entanglement entropy for a given range of strip widths in the superconducting phase .",
    "the kink persists even for zero temperature solutions .",
    "it was argued there that the appearance of the kink can be attributed to the existence of a new scale in the theory and the entanglement entropy is a good probe of the new scale .",
    "the new scale can be viewed as a finite correlation length .",
    "quite interestingly , in our p - wave superconductor model , the kind does not appear even in the first order phase transition case ( see figure.[entropywidth1 ] ) .",
    "this suggests that the existence of this new scale is not universal in holographic superconductor models .",
    "note that in this p - wave model , not only the @xmath156 symmetry but also the rotational symmetry are broken , hence , the superconducting phase is anisotropic .",
    "on the other hand , only the @xmath156 symmetry is broken in the s - wave model studied in ref .",
    "@xcite and the superconducting phase is isotropic . we suspect that the anisotropy might be responsible for the absence of the kink in the superconducting phase in the first order transition case",
    ". clearly it would be quite interesting to investigate whether such kink is common in other s - wave superconductor models .",
    "note that the zero temperature solution studied in ref .",
    "@xcite is an rg flow between two ads spaces . indeed",
    ", the existence of the kink for the entanglement entropy in such backgrounds has also been observed in ref .",
    "@xcite ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite ) where null energy condition is used to constrain the monotonic behavior of c - function along rg flows .",
    "it was shown there that the kink would emerge for particular choice of the asymptotically ads geometry , which is obviously shown in  figure(6 ) in ref .",
    "more specifically , the geometry is controlled by a parameter @xmath157 .",
    "a kink will emerge for @xmath158 , while it will disappear for the case @xmath159 . in ref .",
    "@xcite , it has been also analyzed in some details when the kink will appear .",
    "it shows that the presence of the kink is due to the particular potential in the model which in turn further determines the geometry structure of the background solutions .",
    "let us further stress here that the kink of entanglement entropy also appears in the ads soliton backgrounds  @xcite , and the signal of the kink acts as the  confinement / deconfiment \" phase transition .",
    "finally we would like to mention that the holographic p - wave superconductor model has been extended to include the gauss - bonnet term in refs .",
    "@xcite where the condensate is found to become harder as the gauss - bonnet coefficient grows up . on the other hand ,",
    "the original entanglement entropy proposal has been generalized to include some higher derivative corrections , such as the gauss - bonnet term , in the bulk  @xcite .",
    "the entanglement entropy in the gauss - bonnet gravity has been calculated for many configurations and discovered to give additional contributions  @xcite",
    ". there might be some new features for the entanglement entropy in the p - wave superconductor models with the gauss - bonnet term .",
    "we wish to report on the related work in future .",
    "we would like to thank hai - qing zhang , zhang - yu nie , and shu - hao zou for their helpful discussions and suggestions .",
