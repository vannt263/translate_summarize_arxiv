    "the usage of a coherent field to control the optical properties of a medium has led to many remarkable results such as enhanced nonlinear optical effects @xcite , electromagnetically induced transparency ( eit ) @xcite , lasing without inversion @xcite , ultraslow light @xcite , storage and revival of optical pulses @xcite and many others @xcite .",
    "most of these effects rely on quantum interferences which are created by the application of a coherent field .",
    "the coherent field opens up a new channel for the process under consideration .",
    "the application of the coherent field gives us considerable flexibility as by changing the strength and the frequency of the field we can obtain a variety of control on the optical properties of the medium .",
    "the zeeman degeneracy of the atomic levels adds to this flexibility as the coherent field may open up more than one pathway thereby leading to new interferences .    in this paper",

    "iv , we show how new features arise in these profiles as effects of the new coherence .",

    "this kind of configuration is important for studying the effects of cross talk among different transitions @xcite .",
    "note that cross talk in a @xmath1-system can lead to gain in the transmission of the probe field @xcite .",
    "similar configuration with degenerate sublevels also leads to electromagnetically induced absorption while interacting with control and probe fields with the same polarization @xcite .",
    "we apply a dc magnetic field to remove the degeneracy of the excited and the ground states . in general , the zeeman separation @xmath2 of the excited magnetic sublevels @xmath3 is not the same as the zeeman separation @xmath4 of the ground levels @xmath5 , due to difference in the land @xmath6-factors in these manifolds .",

    "further , at certain region of the detuning @xmath71 ( @xmath72 ) of the probe field , the imaginary part of @xmath58 becomes _ negative _ , leading to the _ gain in the @xmath64 component_. for the case of a @xmath1-system , there would be no possibility of gain in the medium [ solid line in fig .",
    "[ chap5fig2](b ) ] for any @xmath71 . in the next section ,",
    "we analyze these new features in terms of the new coherence that we discussed in the sec .",
    "we should mention here that two - photon gain in hot alkali vapor has been reported in recent experiments @xcite .",
    "the gain involves absorption of two photons from the detuned @xmath64 polarized control field and emission of two photons in @xmath22-polarized probe field at raman resonance .",
    "detailed theoretical analysis @xcite has shown that these are due to quantum interference of several excitation pathways , originating from hyperfine structures .",
    "because in our model , gain arises due to interference of two different pathways , as described sec .",
    "ii , we should emphasize the main difference between the model in @xcite and our model .",
    "we consider a different set of polarizations and frequency of the electric fields interacting with the non - degenerate electronic levels , contrary to @xcite , where degenerate hyperfine levels have been considered . in our model ,",
    "the gain , associated with emission of a single photon in @xmath64 component , is essentially a two - photon process , and thus much larger in effect compared to that arising due to four - photon process described in @xcite .",
    "in addition , gain occurs when the probe field is _ not _ at raman resonance with the control field .",
    "we start with the expression ( [ rho_eg1 ] ) for @xmath73 in the @xmath1-system .",
    "clearly , the susceptibility of the probe field arises only by the population difference between the relevant levels @xmath74 and @xmath29 , as the zeroth - order coherence between the levels @xmath75 and @xmath74 is zero in this case .",

    ".  [ chap5fig1 ] , the coherence @xmath77 also contributes to the susceptibility @xmath58 [ see eq .",
    "( [ rho_egn ] ) ] , while contribution from @xmath78 to @xmath58 vanishes at two - photon resonance ( @xmath68 ) as @xmath76 .",
    "then , using eqs .",
    "( [ popul ] ) and ( [ rhogeex ] ) , we can write for @xmath79 @xmath80 where @xmath81 , and @xmath82 .",
    "the first term inside the bracket in the above equation is due to the contribution of @xmath83 and the second term is due to the coherence @xmath84 .",
    "we see from the above expression , that real parts of these two terms cancel each other , and it is essentially their imaginary parts which contribute to the susceptibility .",
    "we find that @xmath85 which is non - zero as @xmath86 .",
    "thus nonzero susceptibility of the system of fig .",
    "[ chap5fig1 ] manifests itself as an effect of the _ zeroth order coherence _ in the @xmath87 transition .",
    "further , it is essentially associated with no absorption , as eq .",
    "( [ nonzero ] ) has no imaginary part .",
    "we should mention here that the susceptibility becomes negative due to larger land @xmath6 factor of the ground state manifold ( i.e. , @xmath88 ) .",
    "clearly , in absence of the magnetic field , the medium becomes isotropic , and no special features can be found in the dispersion profile .    in fig .",
    "[ fig3](a ) , we show how the real part of @xmath58 varies with the detuning @xmath63 of the control field at two - photon resonance @xmath68 .",
    "clearly , even for resonant control field ( i.e. , for @xmath61 ) , the susceptibility is negative .",
    "moreover , the real part of @xmath58 becomes zero at two - photon resonance for certain value of @xmath71 .",
    "putting @xmath76 in eq .",
    "( [ rho_egn ] ) , one can calculate the corresponding value @xmath89 for the present parameters , we find that @xmath90 , which is shown in fig .  [ fig3](a ) .",
    "in fact , for @xmath91 , the contributions of the population difference term and the coherence term to re(@xmath58 ) cancel each other and the susceptibility of the probe field vanishes . in fig .  [ fig3](b ) , we show that the control field can be a good control parameter for the susceptibility . the susceptibility remains negative for the entire range of @xmath26 at two - photon resonance .",
    "this is unlike the case of a @xmath1 system [ see fig .  [ fignew](b ) ] for which the real part of @xmath58 would remain zero at two - photon resonance irrespective of the value of rabi frequency @xmath26 of the control field .",
    "it is well understood that , the absorption spectrum of the probe field in the @xmath1 system of fig .  [ fignew](b ) shows autler - townes doublet .",
    "moreover , there does not arise any gain in the medium . at two - photon resonance @xmath68 ,",
    "the absorption becomes zero .",
    "however , the case of the four - level system of fig .",
    "[ chap5fig1 ] is different .",
    "we already have noted that the susceptibility @xmath58 of the @xmath64 component is contributed by two terms : @xmath84 and @xmath83 .",
    "we show the individual contribution of these two terms in the absorption spectra in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] . from this figure",
    "one can see that at certain region of frequency ( @xmath92 ) , the negative contribution of @xmath84 is larger in magnitude than the positive contribution of @xmath83 .",
    "thus , gain arises in the medium . in our model",
    ", this novel feature can be attributed to the control field @xmath26 which gives rise to the non - zero coherence @xmath84 .",
    "further , from the expressions of @xmath93 and @xmath94 [ eqs .",
    "( [ popul ] ) ] , one sees that the zeroth - order populations in both the @xmath95 levels are larger than those in the levels @xmath96 due to the presence of non - zero decay terms @xmath97 and @xmath98 . thus there is no population inversion in bare basis and we have _ gain without inversion_. note that at two - photon resonance ( @xmath68 ) , the contributions from the terms @xmath84 and @xmath83 to the absorption profile cancel each other , leading to transparency .",
    "we should further mention here that the contribution of @xmath78 to the gain is negligible for all @xmath71 .",
    "in conclusion , we have shown how a control field can give rise to new coherence effects in a specific four - level system .",
    "the control field leads to multiple pathways , interference between which leads to the effects like gain without inversion and non - zero susceptibility associated with zero absorption .",
    "we have explained these results in terms of the new coherence arising due to this interference .",
