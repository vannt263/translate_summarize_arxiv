    "an understanding of the physics of the edge has been one of the long - standing challenges in the field of fractional quantum hall ( fqhe ) systems [ ] . in ideal fqhe systems the excitations in the bulk are suppressed at low temperatures because of a gap , and low - energy excitations exist only at the edge .",
    "furthermore , the electrons at the edge move only in one direction defined by the @xmath10 drift .",
    "the edge thus behaves like a chiral one - dimensional system .",
    "given the success of bosonization methods ( see [ ] for review ) in dealing with one - dimensional electron liquids , it is attractive to attempt a description of the physics of the fqhe edge by reformulating the theory in terms of the bosonic density wave excitations following the usual method of bosonization .",
    "such a theory requires @xmath11 species of bosons [ ] for the fqhe states at @xmath12 . of its many predictions ,",
    "the one that has been subjected to the most reliable experimental tests relates to the non - ohmic behavior of the tunnel conductance for transport from an ordinary fermi liquid into the fqhe edge [ ] .",
    "the bosonic approach predicts a power - law behavior @xmath13 for all fqhe states of the form @xmath12 .",
    "experiments do find a non - fermi liquid behavior , but with an exponent of @xmath14 2.8 , 2.3 and 2.0 for @xmath1 , @xmath0 and @xmath15 , respectively , and also do not find a plateau in the exponent as a function of the filling factor .",
    "a number of theoretical studies have explored the origin of the discrepancy [ ] .",
    "an independent approach for describing the fqhe edge uses the idea of composite fermions ( cfs ) [ ] , without making any reference to bosonization .",
    "the microscopic foundations of the cf theory have been confirmed for the bulk physics ( by comparison with experiment , or with exact results in the compact spherical geometry that contains no edges ) , and also for hall droplets with an edge [ ] .",
    "the fqhe state at @xmath12 is described as a state with @xmath11 filled @xmath2 levels , where the @xmath2 levels of composite fermions are analogous to the landau levels of electrons , but reside within the lowest electronic landau level .",
    "the edge excitations of this state then have a one - to - one correspondence with the edge excitations of the iqhe state with @xmath11 filled landau levels .",
    "the natural questions that occur here are whether the cf theory and the bosonization approach are consistent , and what the precise correspondence is between the two pictures .",
    "the most studied edge is that of the @xmath1 state [ ] . this state consists of all the cfs occupying the lowest @xmath2 level , and its edge excitations mainly have all the cfs staying in the lowest @xmath2 level .",
    "much less investigated , from a microscopic view point , are the edges of other fractions , although some work has been done in that direction [ ] .",
    "we focus in this paper on the simplest nontrivial edge , namely the edge of the @xmath0 state , and seek to understand its physics from a microscopic starting point .",
    "the physics of the edges of other fqhe states of the form @xmath12 is expected to be similar .    a fundamental aspect in which the edge of the @xmath0 system differs from the simpler @xmath1 edge is the presence of several sectors in the edge spectrum at @xmath0 .",
    "different sectors in the spectrum corresponds to different numbers of composite fermions in each of the two @xmath2 levels .",
    "each sector has its own edge excitations , thus resulting in a fan - like diagram for edge excitations , as seen in fig .",
    "[ spectrasectors ] below .",
    "several of these sectors are essentially degenerate in the thermodynamic limit for a realistic geometry and confinement .",
    "the same is of course true of the iqhe state at @xmath16 as well .",
    "as far as labeling and counting of edge modes is concerned , @xmath17 is analogous to @xmath16 .",
    "however , a potential subtlety arises with extending the analogy between the fqhe and the iqhe to the process of adding an electron to the edge , which is relevant for the experiments quoted above .",
    "suppose we begin with the ground state in the @xmath3 $ ] sector at @xmath16 , which contains @xmath4 electrons in the lowest landau level and @xmath5 in the second , and add an electron to this system . for a non - interacting system of electrons , we will end up with an excited state in either of the two sectors @xmath6 $ ] or @xmath7 $ ] .",
    "now consider @xmath17 , and add an _ electron _ at the edge of the ground state in the @xmath3 $ ] sector , in which @xmath4 composite fermions compactly occupy the lowest @xmath2 level and @xmath5 the second .",
    "the crucial point is to remember that we are adding an electron , not a composite fermion . as this electron gets converted into a composite fermion , which is a nonperturbative process , it is not clear , a priori , how it will spread over the states of all possible sectors of the form @xmath8 $ ] , where @xmath9 is an arbitrary integer .",
    "one of the pleasing outcomes of our study is that , even in this case , the resulting state lies in either the @xmath6 $ ] or the @xmath7 $ ] sector . at low energies , adding an electron at the edge of a @xmath17 system is thus equivalent to adding a composite fermion into one of the two @xmath2 levels .",
    "an important simplifying assumption made in our work is that we neglect @xmath2 level mixing ; the question of how @xmath2 level mixing modifies our conclusions is beyond the scope of the present work .",
    "there are reasons to believe that @xmath2 level mixing may be relevant . in a previous work",
    "the tl exponent of the edge liquid computed [ ] by a direct evaluation of the equal - time green s function was found to be in agreement with the prediction of the bosonic approach when @xmath2 level mixing was neglected , but was found to change when @xmath2 level mixing ( caused by the residual interaction between composite fermions ) was allowed .",
    "these studies indicate that the bosonized description is appropriate for noninteracting composite fermions , but inter composite fermion interactions produce corrections .",
    "it is not known what such corrections correspond to in the bosonic description . in this study",
    "we do _ not _ allow mixing with higher @xmath2 levels , and all our conclusions are subject to this assumption .",
    "one of our aims in the present study is to establish a  dictionary \" between the operators and states in the effective two - boson description .",
    "a possible direct connection between them identifies the  fermion \" creation operator of the bosonic theory as the operator that actually creates a  composite fermion \" at the edge , with the bosonic degree of freedom representing particle - hole pairs of composite fermions at the edge .",
    "such an identification can be verified by comparing the appropriately normalized matrix elements of the creation operators ( which are called spectral weights , and which are precisely the elements that enter into the expression of the standard spectral function ) in the two frameworks , following palacios and macdonald [ ] . such tests have been performed [ ] for @xmath18 , and show that while the individual spectral weights are nonuniversal and do not necessarily conform to the bosonic model [ ] , their sum at a given momentum does [ ] .",
    "the reason for considering the sum of the spectral weights at a given momentum is that the power - law exponent characterizing the tunnel conductance is determined in the asymptotic regime by the sum of the spectral weights for edges for which the dispersion is linear [ ] .",
    "we calculate the sum of such spectral weights at various momenta ( which correspond to angular momenta in our geometry ) and compare our results to the e2bd description .",
    "the two  bosons \" represent bosonic particle - hole excitations of composite fermions at the edges of the two @xmath2 levels .",
    "the following facts support this conclusion :    1 .",
    "the e2bd of the @xmath0 edge contains two bosons .",
    "this is naturally expected within the cf theory where the @xmath0 state has two filled @xmath2 levels , and thus two bosonic excitations associated with their edges . 2 .",
    "the counting of edge excitations of cf @xmath2 levels matches with the counting from the e2bd .",
    "3 .   addition of an electron at the @xmath0 edge is equivalent to the addition of a composite fermion at the edge , which can go into either of the two @xmath2 levels or some linear combination of them .",
    "an explicit evaluation of the spectral weights ( for transitions into the two relevant sectors ) from the microscopic cf theory demonstrates that they satisfy the sum rule predicted by the e2bd .",

    "the individual spectral weights are all non - zero and do not match the numbers given in table [ swtable ] .",
    "it is expected that the individual spectral weights are not the same as the prediction since the bosonic operators @xmath149 do not directly correspond to the angular momentum excitations in the @xmath2 levels ( though they must be related to each other by unitary transformations ) .",

    "[ sw ] shows the sum of the spectral weights for the case where the newly added electrons enters as a composite fermion in the lowest @xmath2 level producing a final state in the sector @xmath6 $ ] . in this case",
    ", the numerical evaluation of the spectral sum rule can be simplified by noting that only one of the spectral weights is non - zero for the cf basis ( as shown analytically in appendix [ sw_in_lll ] ) .",
    "the sum of the spectral weights is again in agreement with the e2bd predictions .",
    "the fact that the sum of the spectral weights at each angular momentum matches with the same from the bosonization approach shows that there is a one - to - one correspondence between the vector space of states with constant total angular momentum in the two approaches .",
    "in addition to these two situations , one can consider the case where the added electron appears as a cf in one of the other sectors , such as @xmath3\\rightarrow [ n_1 - 1,n_2 + 2]$ ] .",
    "[ coupling ] shows the overlap matrix element for several sector - ground - states .",
    "the overlap with sector - ground - state of @xmath141 $ ] rapidly approaches 0 as @xmath36 increases . using simple angular momentum accounting , similar to the one in appendix [ sw_in_lll ]",
    ", one can show that the overlap of the new state into the sector @xmath142 $ ] is identically zero .",
    "these results indicate that the coupling to sectors other than @xmath6 $ ] and @xmath7 $ ] is vanishingly small ; the other sectors can therefore be neglected insofar as the process of tunneling of an electron is concerned .",
    "we have undertaken an investigation of the @xmath0 edge within the framework of the microscopic cf theory .",
    "our motivations are twofold .",
    "the @xmath0 edge has interesting additional structure , due to the presence of multiple quasi - degenerate edge sectors , that is not found at the edge , and tunnel conductivity experiments exhibit a larger discrepancy from the predictions of the effective bosonic theory .",
    "we have found several interesting results .",
    "first of all , even though there is a continuum of quasi - degenerate fans of edge excitations , belonging to different @xmath3 $ ] sectors , the tunneling is dominated by two sectors , which are the sectors in which a composite fermion is added at the edge of the lowest or the second @xmath2 level .",
    "the addition of an electron to the edge of a fqhe system is thus equivalent to the addition of a composite fermion ",
    "a result that is pleasing but far from obvious .",
    "second , we find that the values of the spectral weight sum at constant total angular momentum is , in the thermodynamic limit , consistent with the values predicted by the effective two - boson theory .",
    "these sum rules govern the exponent relevant for the tunnel conductance at low biases ; thus our results provide a nontrivial microscopic confirmation of the predictions of the two - boson theory ( within our approximations ) . strictly speaking",
    ", our analysis holds for a situation in which the two edge channels have the same velocity , so the sum over spectral weights at a fix momentum is identical to the sum over spectral weights at a fixed energy , but arguments can be given ( see appendix a ) that the same exponent is obtained even when the edge channels have different velocities .",
    "a numerical verification of sum of spectral weights for constant momenta in the _ individual _ modes is yet to be accomplished .",
    "finally , we confirm the operators constructed in refs .  [ ] and [ ] for adding composite fermions to various @xmath2 levels .",
    "we conclude by speculating on the origin of the discrepancy between the e2bd predictions and the experimental results .",
    "one possibility is that of edge reconstruction [ ] which renders the exponents non - universal .",
    "however , intrinsic sources for the discrepancy have not been ruled out . as indicated in ref .",
    "[ ] , @xmath2 level mixing , which is always present ( because although the inter - cf interaction is small compared to the cf cyclotron energy , the two have the same energy scale ) but neglected in the present work , can possibly be relevant and can produce corrections to the edge exponents .",
    "further investigations will be required to sort out these effects .",
