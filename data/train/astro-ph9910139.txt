    "the x - ray burst source and soft x - ray transient aquila x1 displays x - ray variability on all time scales .",
    "usually the source is in its quiescent state with a very low x - ray luminosity , typically @xmath1 erg s@xmath2 ( verbunt et al .",
    "1994 ) . within intervals of months",
    "to years it shows outbursts characterized by a gradual increase in flux to a level that sometimes is comparable to the crab , but at other times is two orders of magnitude fainter .",
    "the periodicity of these long - term outburts is unstable with recurrent periods of @xmath0 125 and 309 days ( priedhorsky & terrell 1984 ; kitamoto et al . 1993 ) .",
    "the rise time is typically 10 days , the source remains at a flux maximum for 510 days and then decays back to quiescence in typically 3050 days ( campana et al .",
    "1998 ; kitamoto et al .",
    "the spectrum is soft and no regular pulsations have been detected ( cui et al .",
    "1998 ; zhang , yu & zhang 1998 ) . during outbursts",
    ", aquila x1 displays type - i x - ray bursts ( zhang et al .",
    "1998 ) that can be explained in terms of runaway thermonuclear burning of matter on the surface of the neutron star . as in many other low - mass x - ray binaries ( lmxb ) ,",
    "khz quasi - periodic oscillations ( qpo ) have been detected in the persistent flux of aquila x1 ( zhang et al .",
    "1998 ; cui et al .",
    "these khz qpo occurred in the frequency range 740830 hz , had a q value ( = @xmath3 ) of over 100 and an average fractional @xmath4 amplitude of 7% .",
    "khz qpo may be caused by orbital motion of gas around the neutron star very close to its surface ( see van der klis 1999 for a recent review ) .",
    "recent deep optical and infrared images and low resolution spectroscopy of this system suggest that the mass - donating companion is a v=21.6 k7v star , located at an estimated distance of 2.5 kpc ( callanan et al .",
    "1999 ; chevalier et al . 1999 ) , and not the v=19.2 k1iv star , 0.48@xmath5 west , previously assumed to be the candidate ( chevalier & ilovaisky 1991 ; shahbaz , casares & charles 1997 ) . at radio wavelengths",
    "aquila x-1 is unusual in being one of the only neutron star binaries to exhibit radio emission ( hjellming & han 1995 ) .",
    "the late - type optical counterpart and the episodic outbursts define aquila x1 as a soft x - ray transient ( sxt ) , whereas the existence of type i bursts denotes a low magnetic field neutron star companion ( as opposed to black hole ) . prior to exosat ,",
    "low mass x - ray binaries ( lmxb ) were classified on the basis of their x - ray luminosity ( schulz , hasinger & trmper 1989 ) into two classes : high and low luminosity systems .",
    "the low luminosity systems included the so - called x - ray bursters . thanks to its wide orbit and large collecting area ,",
    "the exosat satellite allowed long uninterrupted observations and detailed x - ray timing analysis .",
    "taking into account the rapid aperiodic variability it turned out that low - mass x - ray binaries could be divided into two different subclasses , z and atoll sources , defined by the patterns that these sources display in x - ray color - color diagrams and the properties of the rapid x - ray variability ( hasinger & van der klis 1989 , hereafter hk89 ) .",
    "the classification of aquila x1 in this scheme is not certain .",
    "_ rxte _ data has suggested that aquila x1 is an atoll source ( cui et al .",
    "1998 ) , though some properties appear anomalous . in this paper",
    "we investigate the correlated x - ray timing and spectral variations of aquila x1 and present evidence for its classification as an atoll source .",
    "the data used in this work were retrieved from the public _",
    "rxte _ archive and correspond to two different sets of observations .",
    "the first one took place between 1997 february 16  march 10 and consists of 12 separate observations ( one every two days , roughly ) , with a total usable time of about 96 ks ( see zhang et al .",
    "these data correspond to the decay phase of an outburst .",
    "the observations during the second set , 1997 august 11 ",
    "september 10 , were conducted at a typical rate of once or twice per day and produced approximately 168 ks of usable data .",
    "these observations began halfway through the rising phase of another outburst and finished half way through the decay phase .",
    "five type i x - ray bursts ( two of them were already reported in zhang et al .",
    "1998 ) as well as khz qpo were present in the data .",
    "the bursts were excluded from our analysis .",
    "another four snapshots taken during the rising phase of the 1998 february - march outburst ( cui et al .",
    "1998 ) were also analysed in order to compare our results with those of other authors .",
    "_ rxte _ carries two pointed instruments , the proportional counter array ( pca ) developed to cover the lower part of the energy range ( 260 kev ) , and the high energy x - ray timing experiment ( hexte ) sensitive to x - rays between 15 and 250 kev .",
    "these instruments are equipped with collimators yielding a fwhm of one degree .",
    "in addition , rxte carries an all - sky monitor ( asm ) that scans about 80% of the sky every orbit . in this work we analyzed data from the pca only since its large collecting area ( @xmath0 6500 @xmath6 ) , makes it the most appropiate instrument for timing studies .",
    "background subtracted light curves corresponding to the energy ranges 2.03.5 kev , 3.56.0 kev , 6.09.7 kev and 9.716.0 kev were used to define the soft and hard colors as sc = 3.56.0/2.03.5 and hc = 9.716.0/6.09.7 , respectively . in a few of the observations one or two of the five detectors of the pca were switched off ; we only used the three detectors which were always on to calculate these count rates , and normalized the count rates to 5 detectors .",
    "the color - color diagram of aquila x1 is shown in figure  [ cd ] .",
    "the data points in this color - color diagram fall into several distinct groups , the hard color being the defining quantity .",
    "the statistical scatter in the uppermost ( open squeres ) and middle ( open circles ) groups in figure 1 is considerable .",
    "these groups of points come from observations at the very end ( after march 5th ) of the decay of the 1997 march outburst .",
    "the lower branch corresponds to observations from the rest of the 1997 february  march run and from the entire 1997 august ",
    "september run .",
    "the points represented with filled squares correspond to the 1998 march 2 observation .",
    "the mean pca intensity of each group is given in table  [ fitres ] .",
    "at the rising part of the 1997 august - september outburst the source moved smoothly from left to right along the lower elongated branch , and moved back from right to left during the decay phase . during the 1997 february - march outburst the source also moved towards lower soft colors as the intensity decreased .    in order to measure the source luminosity in the different states spanned in the color - color diagram we extracted energy spectra and fitted an absorbed blackbody plus power - law model to the data .",
    "an iron line at 6.4 kev was added if necessary .",
    "the 210 kev x - ray luminosity , assuming a distance of 2.5 kpc , varies from 2.0 @xmath7 10@xmath8 erg s@xmath2 in the uppermost group to 3.2 @xmath7 10@xmath9 erg s@xmath2 in the middle one .",
    "the elongated lower group of points presents the highest count rate . here the source luminosity increases from left to right , from 2.4 @xmath7 10@xmath10 erg s@xmath2 to 3.9 @xmath7 10@xmath10 erg s@xmath2 .",
    "these structures in the color - color diagram and associated count rate differences are similar to those of typical atoll sources .",
    "the upper and middle group of points can be associated with the so - called island state , whereas the more elongated lower part would then represent the banana state . only by looking at the position occupied by the points of the 1998 observation it is not posssible to tell whether they define an island or a banana state and an analysis in terms of the aperiodic variability",
    "is needed . in any case",
    "they seem to indicate that the transition between the two spectral states is smooth .",
    "the gap between the branches is probably observational : no data were obtained for two days between the banana and the island and for three days between the island and the extreme island states during the 1997 observations .    in order to investigate the variability of aquila x1 as a function of the position in the color - color diagram we divided the color - color plane into several regions as shown in figure  [ cd ] .",
    "the two island branches define the first two groups .",
    "the banana branch was divided so that each region contains approximately the same amount of data .",
    "we then approximated the shape of the banana branch with a spline , and used the parameter @xmath11 to measure positions along this spline ( mndez et al .",
    "we set @xmath11 to 2 at ( sc , hc)= ( 1.732,0.338 ) and to 3 at ( sc , hc)=(2.045,0.320 ) .",
    "the intermediate positions are obtained through spline interpolation between the two defining values .",
    "this could be done for the banana branch only since the discontinuity between the island and banana branches does not allow to define a unique path .",
    "we arbitrarily assigned the values 1.1 and 1.5 to the two island states . in this way",
    "each one of the regions in which we had divided the color - color diagram is then characterized by a value of the parameter @xmath11 .      in order to study the source variability at low frequencies ( @xmath12 512 hz ) we divided the 260 kev pca light curve ( no energy selection was done ) of each observation into 256 s segments and calculated the fourier power spectrum of each segment up to a nyquist frequency of 1024 hz .",
    "the high frequency end ( 9501024 hz ) of the power spectra was used to determine the underlying poisson noise , which was subtracted before performing the spectral fitting .",
    "the power spectra were normalized to fractional @xmath4 squared per hertz ( van der klis 1995 ) . in a few observations one or two of the five pca units",
    "were switch off .",
    "we have used only those observations for which the five detector units were switched on .",
    "this implied a loss of @xmath0 11% of the data . to avoid contributions to the power from the khz qpos we restricted the spectral fitting to the frequency interval 1/256512 hz .",
    "the 256-s power spectra were then grouped according to the position of the source in the color - color diagram : for each region in the banana and each island state one mean power spectrum was obtained .",
    "the power spectra were fitted using two broad noise components called the very - low frequency noise ( vlfn ) and the high - frequency noise ( hfn ) .",
    "these two components are mathematically represented by a power - law and a power - law times an exponential cut - off , respectively ( hk89 ) .",
    "the vlfn accounts for the low - frequency part of the spectrum , whereas the hfn dominates at higher frequencies .",
    "figure  [ pds ] shows six power spectra corresponding to different positions in the color - color diagram ; all the island states and the lower , middle and upper banana states are shown .",
    "while the vlfn plus hfn model can satisfactorily describe the banana - state power spectra , it does not provide good fits for the faintest ( @xmath13 ) of the two island - state power spectra .",
    "ford & van der klis ( 1998 ) used a broken power - law plus one low - frequency ( 1050 hz ) lorentzian , possibly representing lense - thirring precession ( stella & vietri 1998 ) , to fit the island - state power spectra of the atoll source 4u 172834 . in aquila x1",
    "we find that a simple broken power - law gives good fits ( @xmath14 @xmath12 1.2 ) to the power spectra in both island states .",
    "although described by different mathematical functions , the cut - off power - law of the banana state and the broken power - law of the island state are likely to represent the same type of noise component , namely hfn .",
    "to be consistent , we have used the broken power - law model to fit the power spectra of the island states .",
    "figure  [ rms ] shows the variation of the amplitude ( as fractional @xmath4 ) of the vlfn ( circles ) , hfn ( squares ) and broken power - law ( triangles ) components .",
    "the latter refers to the island states .    unlike the hfn component",
    ", the amplitude of the vlfn component does not show any clear trend , but remains at @xmath0 6 - 7% @xmath4 , irrespective of the position that the source occupies in the banana .",
    "the maximum strength of the hfn is found during the island phases ( @xmath15 34% and 18% for the upper and lower island sates , respectively ) .",
    "this is in contrast to the results of cui et al .",
    "( 1998 ) who did not detect such hfn component in the first observations of the 1998 february - march outburst ( mjd 5087577 ) , despite the inference from the color diagrams that these data were in an island state .",
    "these authors discuss the absence of an hfn in the island state as an unusual phenomenon .",
    "we have reanalysed the first four observations in the cui et al .",
    "( 1998 ) paper and found that there is , in fact , an hfn component with an @xmath4 of 6.0@xmath160.3% ( fig  [ pds ] , table  [ fitres ] ) in the first two observations .",
    "as expected in the island , there is no vlfn ( 1.6% upper limit , 95% confidence level ) .",
    "the mean hard and soft colors of the corresponding points are hc=1.84 , sc=0.34 and hc=1.86 , sc=0.31 for the first and second observation , respectively .",
    "that is , in our color - color diagram they lie in between the lower island and the banana states .",
    "this distribution of the island points in the color - color diagram suggests a continuous transition between the island and banana groups .",
    "the other two observations produced points in the banana only .      for the khz qpo analysis we produced power spectra using 64 s data segments and a nyquist frequency of 2048 hz .",
    "khz qpo were only observed in a specific range in the color - color diagram , namely the lower banana near @xmath17 ( the filled circles in fig .",
    "the 260 kev fractional amplitudes of the khz qpo ranged from @xmath0 4.5% to @xmath0 11.7% .",
    "we did not detect qpo in the upper part of the banana , with a 95% confidence upper limit of 1.4% @xmath4 nor in the island with an upper limit of @xmath0 8% .",
    "figure  [ figrate ] shows the dependence of the frequency of the qpo as a function of the 216 kev pca count rate .",
    "the two parallel groups at the lower left of the plot ( open and grey circles ) correspond to the 1997 february - march observations ( zhang et al .",
    "1998a ) , while the rest come from the 1997 august - september set of observations .",
    "mndez et al .",
    "( 1999 ) found that there is a much better correlation between the frequency of the khz qpo in 4u 160852 and the position of the source on the color - color diagram than between frequency and flux .",
    "similarly , the multi - valued dependence of @xmath18 on x - ray flux in aquila x1 is reduced to a single relation when @xmath18 is plotted against the @xmath11 parameter , which in our case is just a measure of the soft color ( fig .",
    "[ fig_hc ] ) .",
    "the hard color is not as sensitive to changes in the khz qpo frequency in aquila x1 as it is in 4u 160852 ( kaaret et al .",
    "1998 ; mndez et al .",
    "we have measured the color and timing properties of the lmxb aquila x1 , and found a behavior similar to that of other low - luminosity lmxbs .",
    "the color - color diagram shows the classical atoll shape with the banana and island states .",
    "the island state is not defined by a single group of points but it is split into a number of different groups as in other atoll sources , e.g. 4u 163653 ( prins & van der klis 1997 ) and 4u 160852 ( yoshida et al . 1993 ) . the lowest count rate and fluxes are detected in the island state with the hardest color and increase as the hard color decreases .    based on the similarity of the color - color diagram of aquila x1 to that of other atoll sources it seems likely that aquila x1 can be placed in the group of atoll sources . however , the information provided by the color - color diagram is , by itself , not always sufficient to classify the source state .",
    "it is not always possible to make a distinction between z and atoll sources or between the two spectral states ( island / banana ) within the atoll class ( hk89 ) .",
    "moreover , in some atoll sources the island and banana branches have been seen to shift in the color - color diagram , both in soft and hard colors ( prins & van der klis 1997 ) .",
    "the information obtained from the analysis of the noise components in the power spectra provides the key for an unambiguous classification .",
    "the preliminary classification of aquila x1 as an atoll source on the basis of the color - color diagram is confirmed by the fast - timing analysis .",
    "the power spectra of atoll sources ( hk89 ) are characterized by two broad noise components called the very - low frequency noise and the high - frequency noise .",
    "the relative strengths of these two components vary in anticorrelation with each other and with the inferred mass accretion rate , @xmath19 , as measured by @xmath11 in our analysis : the vlfn component appears at the highest inferred @xmath19 , whereas that of the hfn decreases as @xmath19 increases .",
    "these two components are present in the power spectra of aquila x1 ( see fig .",
    "[ pds ] and table [ fitres ] ) .",
    "as is commonly seen in atoll sources the vlfn is most prominent in the banana state , while the hfn dominates the island state .",
    "the fractional amplitude of the hfn component decreases as the system moves from the island state to the lower banana and from here to the upper banana .",
    "the vlfn component is practically undetectable ( @xmath4 @xmath12 2% ) in the island state , and although present in the banana state its amplitude does not change as expected ( see below ) .",
    "another similarity between the power spectra of aquila x1 in the banana state and those of atoll sources is the presence of wiggles in the vlfn ( hk89 ) .",
    "the increase of the break frequency as the x - ray count rate ( or flux ) increases , and the fact that the largest fractional amplitude and the hardest spectrum are observed in the two island states , represent further evidence in favor of an atoll classification for aquila x1 ( e.g. 4u 0614 + 09 , mndez et al .",
    "it is worth noting that all these characteristics are also seen in black hole candidates during the low state , emphasizing the observational similarities between atoll sources and black holes systems ( van der klis 1994 ) .",
    "one of the open questions in atoll sources is whether the transition from the island to the banana states occurs continuously or abruptly , that is , with the source jumping from one state to the other .",
    "the trends of the spectral parameters just described seem to indicate that such transition is continuous .",
    "this idea would be supported by the 1998 march data ( cui et al .",
    "the upper limit to the @xmath4 of the vlfn component in the 1998 march observation ( @xmath20% , 95% confidence ) is lower than the value in the banana ( 57% ) , and the @xmath4 of the hfn is larger ( 6% compared to 3.5% ) .",
    "the break frequency @xmath21 @xmath22 43 hz follows the same trend as the other two island states , namely , increases as the source moves into the banana .",
    "an interesting difference between the island state of 1998 march and the other two island states is the source count rate . while the two 1997 march islands show the lowest pca intensity , the 1998 march one is comparable to that detected in the lower banana state .",
    "it is worth noting that the 1997 island data were collected during the _ decay _ of an x - ray outburst , whereas that of 1998 correspond to the _ rise _ of the outburst .",
    "a hysteresis effect may be present .",
    "our observed vlfn amplitude does not change significantly in the banana state , contrary to what is observed in other atoll sources .",
    "also , the power - law index of the vlfn becomes less steep as the source moves up in the banana branch , while usually in other atoll sources a slight increase , if any change , occurs .",
    "this unusual behavior of the vlfn component may be related to nuclear burning on the surface of the neutron star . in periodic x - ray burters , like aquila x1",
    ", the entire surface of the star is rapidly ( @xmath12 10 s ) burned by a fast propagating thermonuclear instability .",
    "this can only happen at low mass accretion rates , where the envelope is convectively combustible most of the time .",
    "the convective burning makes it difficult for slower combustion to occur , thus suppressing the vlfn ( bildsten 1993 ) .",
    "yu et al . ( 1999 ) reported another unusual aspect of the vlfn in aquila x1 , namely , its disappearance after a type i burst , in which the 210 kev flux decreased by about 10% and the khz qpo frequency fell abruptly by @xmath0 37 hz .    aquila x1 is unusual among the group of low - mass x - ray binaries with khz qpo in that only one khz qpo has been so far observed .",
    "all other sources ( z and atoll ) have at least sometimes shown two simultaneous khz qpos .",
    "nevertheless , the relationship between the frequency of the khz qpo and the x - ray flux in aquila x-1 is very similar to that seen in the atoll sources 4u 160852 ( mndez et al .",
    "1999 ) and 4u 0614 + 091 ( ford et al . 1997 ) : on time scales longer than @xmath0 1 day there is no correlation between the khz frequency and the x - ray intensity ( or flux ) , whereas on short time scales ( @xmath0 hours ) , these two quantities correlate remarkably well ( zhang et al .",
    "we also find that similarly to other sources , on time scales longer than a day , the qpo frequency correlates much better to color ( or @xmath11 ) than to count rate .",
    "we have used _ rxte _ data to carry out a timing analysis with the aim of solving the issue of the classification of aquila x1 in the z / atoll scheme .",
    "aquila x1 traces a pattern in the color - color diagram that is consistent with having an island and a banana branch .",
    "the pca intensity correlates with the position of the source in the color  color diagram , decreasing in the sense upper banana @xmath23 lower banana @xmath23 island state .",
    "the power density spectra of the banana states can be described in terms of a power - law component , the so - called very low - frequency noise and a cut - off power - law component or high - frequency noise . in the island state",
    "the high frequency noise component is best described in terms of a broken power - law , whereas the very low frequency noise is practically undetectable .",
    "the characteristics of the power spectra also change in correlation with the position of the source in the color - color diagram .",
    "the amplitude of the high frequency noise increases as the @xmath11 parameter decreases .",
    "finally , we have shown that the soft color ( via the @xmath11 parameter ) correlates with the frequency of the khz qpo .",

    "<S> based on _ rossi x - ray timing explorer _ data , we discuss the classification of the soft x - ray transient aquila x1 in the z / atoll scheme , and the relation of its kilohertz quasi - periodic oscillations ( khz qpo ) properties to the x - ray colors . </S>",
    "<S> the color - color diagram shows one elongated ( `` banana '' ) structure and several `` islands '' of data points . </S>",
    "<S> the power spectra of the island are best represented by a broken power - law , whereas those of the banana by a power - law below @xmath0 1 hz plus an exponentially cut - off component at intermediate frequencies ( 3060 hz ) . the parameters of these two components change in correlation with the position of the source in the color - color diagram . </S>",
    "<S> based on the pattern that the source shows in the color - color diagram and its aperiodic variability we conclude that aquila x1 is an atoll source . </S>",
    "<S> we have also investigated the possible correlation between the frequency of the khz qpo and the position of the source in the color - color diagram . </S>",
    "<S> the complexity seen in the frequency _ versus _ count rate diagram is reduced to a single track when the frequency is plotted against hard or soft color .    # 1*#1 * </S>"
