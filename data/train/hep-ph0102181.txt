    "supersymmetry ( susy ) models with r - parity invariance offers a leading candidate for the dark matter observed in the universe at large and locally in the milky way galaxy . thus in models of this type , the lightest neutralino , @xmath12 , is generally the lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) and hence is absolutely stable .",
    "the observed dark matter is then the relic neutralinos left over after the big bang .",
    "susy models are predictive since they can calculate simultaneously the amount of relic density expected , milky way detection signals and the production cross sections at accelerators .",
    "thus cosmological , astronomical and accelerator constraints simultaneously constrain the susy parameter space .    the procedure for calculating the relic density of neutralinos is well known .",
    "( for a review , see @xcite . )",
    "over the past decade , a number of refinements of the analysis needed to get accurate answers have been included .",
    "thus the treatment of threshold and s - channel resonances in the annihilation cross section in the early universe was discussed in @xcite . in calculating the relic density , in",
    "most of the parameter space it is sufficient to use the two body neutralino annihilation cross section , since the effects of heavier particles are suppressed by the boltzman factor .",
    "however , in special situations , the next to lightest supersymmetric particle ( nlsp ) may become nearly degenerate with the lsp , and the coupled annihilation channels of lsp - lsp , nlsp - lsp , nlsp - nlsp must be simultaneously considered  @xcite .",
    "this phenomena of coannihilation was considered within the framework of the minimal supersymmetric model ( mssm ) in @xcite for the situation when the lightest chargino , @xmath13 , becomes nearly degenerate with the @xmath12 . in this paper",
    "we consider supergravity ( sugra ) models with grand unification of the gauge coupling constants and soft susy breaking at the gut scale @xmath14 gev .",
    "the low energy properties of the theory is thus obtained by running the renormalization group equations ( rge ) from @xmath15 to the electroweak scale , where susy breaking at @xmath15 triggers @xmath16 breaking at the electroweak scale . aside from being in accord with the lep data implying grand unification , radiative breaking of @xmath16 greatly enhances the predictiveness of the theory as it reduces the number of susy parameters , and one finds generally for such models that the @xmath12 is mostly bino , and the @xmath13 is mostly wino ( when the soft breaking masses are less than 1 tev ) .",
    "then the @xmath12 and @xmath13 do not become nearly degenerate and this type of coannihilation does not generally take place .",
    "( an exception for a class of d - brane models is discussed below . )",
    "more recently it was pointed out that in sugra models , the sleptons ( particularly the lightest stau , @xmath17 ) can become nearly degenerate with the @xmath12 leading to a new type of coannihilation , and this was explored for low and intermediate values of @xmath18  @xcite .",
    "( here @xmath19 give rise to ( @xmath20,@xmath21 ) quark masses ) . in this paper",
    "we examine this effect for the full range of @xmath0 , i.e. @xmath22  @xcite .",
    "further , in addition to @xmath23 coannihilation , we find the possibility of light stop @xmath24 coannihilation as well as light sbottom @xmath25 coannihilation .",
    "we consider these effects for a range of models based on grand unfication of the gauge coupling constants : ( 1 ) minimal supergavity model ( msugra )  @xcite where there is universal soft breaking masses at @xmath26 , ( 2 ) nonuniversal supergravity models  @xcite , where the first two generation soft breaking masses are kept universal at @xmath26 ( to suppress flavor changing neutral currents ) as well as the gaugino masses , but the higgs and third generation soft breaking masses are allowed to be nonuniversal , and ( 3 ) a d - brane model  @xcite based on type iib strings  @xcite where soft breaking masses at @xmath26 of the @xmath27 doublet squark , slepton and higgs are kept degenerate but distinct from the @xmath27 singlets , and similarly the gaugino @xmath27 doublet soft breaking mass is distinct from the @xmath27 singlets .",
    "while the first two models have been characterized as sugra models , they can also be realized in string models , and in fact any string model based on grand unification at a high @xmath26 scale with the standard model gauge group holding below @xmath26 , phenomenologically can be treated as a sugra model with an appropriate amount of nonuniversal soft breaking . thus the three models sample the possibilities of universal soft breaking , nonuniversal soft breaking in the squark , slepton and higgs sector but universal gaugino masses , and finally nonuniversality in the gaugino sector as well .",
    "since the milky way is perhaps 90@xmath28 dark matter , it is a  laboratory \" for studying the properties of dark matter ( dm ) .",
    "possible signals for dm include annihilation in the halo of the galaxy , annihilation in the center of the sun or earth , and direct detection from scattering by terrestial nuclear targets .",
    "of these , the last is most promising , and we restrict our discussion here to this .",
    "( for recent discussions of the other possibilities see @xcite ) . in general , the neutralino - nucleus scattering has a spin independent and spin dependent part .",
    "however , for heavy nuclei ( aside from exceptional situations discussed below ) , the spin independent scattering dominates , giving rise to approximately equal scattering by neutrons ( @xmath29 ) and protons ( @xmath30 ) in the nucleus .",
    "it is thus possible to extract from any data the neutralino - proton cross section , @xmath31 ( subject to astronomical uncertainties about the milky way ) .",
    "current detectors ( dama , cdms , ukdmc ) are sensitive to cross sections @xmath32 with a one to two order of magnitude improvement possible in the near future .",
    "future detectors ( e.g. genius , cryoarray ) plan to be sensitive down to @xmath33 and thus it is of interest to see what parts of the susy parameter space can be examined by such detectors .    in order to obtain accurate calculations of both the relic density and @xmath31 for large @xmath0 ,",
    "it is necessary to include a number of corrections in the analysis , and we list these here : ( i ) in relating the theory at @xmath26 to phenomena at the electroweak scale , the two loop gauge and one loop yukawa renormalization group equations ( rge ) are used , iterating to get a consistent susy spectrum .",
    "( ii ) qcd rge corrections are further included below the susy breaking scale for contributions involving light quarks .",
    "( iii ) a careful analysis of the light higgs mass @xmath34 is necessary ( including two loop and pole mass corrections ) as the current lep limits impact sensitively on the relic density analysis .",
    "( iv ) l - r mixing terms are included in the sfermion ( mass)@xmath35 matrices since they produce important effects for large @xmath36 in the third generation .",
    "( v ) one loop corrections are included to @xmath37 and @xmath38 which are again important for large @xmath36 .",
    "( vi ) the experimental bounds on the @xmath39 decay put significant constraints on the susy parameter space and theoretical calculations here include the leading order ( lo ) and nlo corrections for large @xmath36 .",
    "note that we have not in the following imposed @xmath40 ( or @xmath41 ) yukawa unification or proton decay constraints as these depend sensitively on unknown post - gut physics .",
    "for example , such constraints do not naturally occur in the string models where @xmath42 ( or @xmath43 ) gauge symmetry is broken by wilson lines at @xmath26 ( even though grand unification of the gauge coupling constants at @xmath26 for such string models is still required ) .    in carrying out the above calculations we have included the latest lep bound on the light higgs mass , @xmath44 114 gev  @xcite and the recent nlo corrections for large @xmath0 for the @xmath39 decay  @xcite .",
    "( we have checked numerically that @xcite and @xcite give identical results . )",
    "since there are still some remaining errors in the theoretical calculation of @xmath34 as well as uncertainty in the top quark mass , @xmath45 gev , we will conservatively assume here that @xmath44 110 gev .",
    "in the mssm , the constraint on @xmath34 is @xmath0 dependent as @xmath46 production ( @xmath47 is the cp odd higgs ) when @xmath48 is possible for @xmath49 and this can be confused with @xmath50 production . however , in sugra models , radiative electroweak breaking eliminates this part of the parameter space , and so it is correct to impose the lep bound on @xmath34 for the full range of @xmath0 .",
    "lep also gives the bound  @xcite @xmath51 102 gev , and the tevatron bound for the gluino @xmath52 is @xcite @xmath53270 gev ( for squark ( @xmath54 ) and gluino masses approximately equal ) .",
    "we assume an allowed 2@xmath55 range from the cleo data for the @xmath39 branching ratio  @xcite : @xmath56    in calculating the relic density we will assume the bounds",

    "the lower bound on @xmath66 is somewhat lower than more conventional estimates ( @xmath67 ) , and allows us to consider the possibility that not all the dm are neutralinos .",
    "( in the following , we will mention when results are sensitive to this lower bound . )",
    "accurate determinations by the map and planck satellites of the dark matter relic density will clearly strengthen the theoretical predictions , and already , analyses using combined data from the cmb , large scale structure , and supernovae data suggests that the correct value of the relic density lies in a relatively narrow band in the center of the region of eq .",

    "the situation here is more complicated .",
    "as pointed out for low and intermediate @xmath0 in @xcite , an accidental cancellation can occur between the higgs @xmath20-quark and the higgs @xmath21-quark scattering amplitudes which can greatly reduce @xmath138 and we investigate here whether this cancellation continues to occur in the high @xmath0 region . since the cancellation is somewhat subtle , we briefly describe how it comes about . in general , @xmath60 , is a mixture of bino(@xmath143 ) , wino(@xmath144 ) and the two higgsinos ( @xmath145 @xmath146 ) : @xmath147 where @xmath148 are the amplitudes .",
    "in much of the parameter space , the t - channel higgs exchanges ( @xmath149 , @xmath150 ) dominate @xmath138 .",

    "( [ eq24 ] ) can happen if @xmath161 is positive , which is the case for @xmath7 .",
    "once @xmath155 is sufficiently suppressed , it can cancel the remaining ( smaller ) @xmath20-quark contribution coming from @xmath162 , leading to a nearly zero value of @xmath138 .",
    "for fixed @xmath0 , total cancellation occurs at a fixed value of @xmath80 , though the effects of cancellation has a width .",
