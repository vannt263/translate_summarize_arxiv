    "the kuiper belt objects ( kbos ) are icy celestial bodies near and beyond the orbit of neptune in the outer solar system .",
    "one of the most outstanding mysteries of these distant objects is the unexpected high orbital inclination ( @xmath0 ) . in the previous work ( li et al .",
    "2014 , hereafter lzs14 ) , we began to study this issue by considering the dynamics of the high - inclination plutinos . by definition ,",
    "a plutino occupies the 2:3 neptune mean motion resonance ( nmmr ) at semimajor axis @xmath19 au .",
    "we have defined the special libration centre ( slc ) of the resonant angle @xmath20 at the minimum of the averaged disturbing function @xmath21 , which corresponds to a stable equilibrium point because the variation of the semimajor axis @xmath22 .",
    "then we designated the mean value of @xmath20 during the time evolution as the general libration centre ( glc ) at @xmath23 , i.e. , the usually called `` libration centre '' . for low - inclination orbits ,",
    "the position of the slc is fixed exactly at the glc .",
    "but for high - inclination orbits , the slc becomes strongly dependent on the argument of perihelion @xmath24 and oscillates around the glc with large amplitude ( gallardo 2006 ) .",
    "nevertheless , the average value of the slc over @xmath25 always matches the glc .",
    "this outcome suggests a new method that can help us to easily determine the libration centre of the other nmmrs for any inclined orbits .",
    "we refer the reader to lzs14 for more details on the calculations of the slc .",
    "in lzs14 we also updated the possible @xmath0-range of the potential plutinos . using the @xmath26-body simulations , we first investigated the stability of high - inclination candidates populating in the 2:3 nmmr for times up to the age of the solar system .",
    "the dynamical map has been built up on the initial @xmath27 plane at different eccentricities ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "we have found that the stable resonant orbits could cover the whole inclination space of @xmath28 . based on this result",
    ", we further explored the outward transportation of planetesimals with initial @xmath0 up to @xmath9 in the framework of the planet migration and 2:3 nmmr sweeping model ( malhotra 1995 ) .",
    "our results showed that the resonant capture and retainment is allowed for any inclined or even perpendicular orbits . beside the aforementioned main concerns , the role of high @xmath0 in both the formation of plutinos during neptune s migration and the later long - term evolution has been discussed in detail .",
    "as the continuation of our study of the high - inclination kbos , in this paper we investigate a population of bodies with @xmath29 au in the 1:2 nmmr , which are known as twotinos .",
    "it is of further interest to present a global view of the dynamics of twotinos on inclined orbits . in the mpc ( minor planet center )",
    "database , about 24 twotinos have been registered and their osculating @xmath3 and @xmath0 at epoch 2012 september 30 are shown in fig . [",
    "observed ] . for the sake of identifying these twotinos , we numerically integrated the trajectories of observed kbos with @xmath30 au for a timespan of @xmath31 yr , under the gravitational perturbations of four jovian planets .",
    "then we examined the time evolution of the resonant angle @xmath32 corresponding to the 1:2 nmmr , where @xmath33 and @xmath34 are the mean longitude and the longitude of perihelion of the kbo , respectively , and @xmath35 is the mean longitude of neptune . in this way a kbo is regarded as a twotino if it exhibits libration of @xmath4 , i.e. , the resonant amplitude @xmath36 .",
    "it is seen that the twotinos possess high inclinations up to about @xmath37 , which seems to be in accord with the stable @xmath0-range obtained in previous literatures ( melita & brunini 2000 ; nesvorn & roig 2001 ; lykawka & mukai 2007 ; tiscareno & malhotra 2009 ; gladman et al .",
    "2012 ) . in spite of this",
    ", we are still eager to know whether @xmath38 is actually the limit of all the potential twotinos .",
    "it must be noted that here we just confirmed or rejected the 1:2 nmmr librators with nominal orbital elements given in the mpc site . if one takes into account the uncertainties of the orbital elements , there might yield some other librators near 47.8 au , and particularly a part of them",
    "could have @xmath14 . besides",
    ", observational selection effects would also work against the detection of high - inclination objects .",
    "it is well known that , for the type of 1:@xmath39 exterior mean motion resonances , there are three possible resonant modes : the usual _ symmetric _ libration of @xmath4 around @xmath23 ; and two separate _ asymmetric _",
    "librations for @xmath40 ( leading ) and for @xmath41 ( trailing ) ( beaug 1994 ; morbidelli et al .",
    "the leading and trailing librators reach their perihelia at longitudes ahead of and behind neptune s longitude , respectively . in the framework of",
    "the planar circular restricted 3-body problem , malhotra ( 1996 ) pointed out that the libration centre @xmath42 is not a well - defined one but depends upon the orbital eccentricity @xmath3 of the particle .",
    "later , the value of @xmath42 related to the asymmetric 1:2 nmmr as a function of @xmath3 was estimated by nesvorn & roig ( 2001 ) . however , the dependence of @xmath42 on the inclinations of twotinos has not been researched until now .",
    "this is due to the fact that the analytical or semi - analytical computations of asymmetric periodic orbits are not so easy in the three - dimensional restricted 3-body problem ( kotoulas 2005 ) .    with respect to the history of neptune s outward migration ,",
    "the relative populations of the leading and trailing twotinos may be an important diagnostic for the migration time - scale @xmath43 .",
    "chiang & jordan ( 2002 ) and murray - clay & chiang ( 2005 ) proposed that planetesimals are less likely to be trapped into the leading rather than the trailing 1:2 nmmr for @xmath43 shorter than @xmath44 yr . but according to observational data shown in fig .",
    "[ observed ] , 10 twotinos are in the leading resonance and only 4 are in the trailing resonance , such a number difference may support an even larger @xmath43 ( lykawka & mukai 2007 ) .",
    "indeed , a time - scale of @xmath45 yr was derived by li et al .",
    "( 2011 ) from @xmath26-body simulations for the orbital evolution of jovian planets embedded in a self - gravitating planetesimal disc .",
    "this reasonable value has already been adopted in lzs14 .",
    "moreover , murray - clay & chiang ( 2005 ) also discussed the capture into the asymmetric 1:2 nmmr influenced by planetesimal s initial eccentricity @xmath46 and initial semimajor axis @xmath47 .",
    "given the time - scale of @xmath48 yr and @xmath49 au ( 1 au exterior to the initial 1:2 nmmr ) , the ratio of leading to trailing particles can be infinitely small for @xmath50 ; while it grows with lager @xmath46 and would nearly approach 1 for @xmath51 , i.e. , the difference in populations vanishes . as we argued in lzs14 , the primordial planetesimals may have high initial inclinations @xmath12 prior to the onset of the resonance sweeping . therefore , in order to complete a survey of the 1:2 nmmr capture in the entire orbital element space , a detailed analysis of the role of @xmath12 is clearly warranted .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    ", we reveal the shift of the libration centre @xmath42 due to high @xmath0 , and the complex resonant behavior in the 1:2 nmmr . in section 3 , we probe the long - term stability of high - inclination objects in the 1:2 nmmr , and show that @xmath0 of stable librators could be as high as @xmath9 . here , the @xmath0-dependent @xmath42 is crucial to choose the initial conditions . in section 4 , for different initial inclinations",

    "the general characteristics of the 1:2 nmmr can be understood by analyzing the behavior of the slc for a series of @xmath24 between @xmath71 and @xmath72 , as presented in fig .",

    "since the amplitude of the slc is the lower limit of @xmath57 , this implies that the resonant angle @xmath4 would eventually take all values between @xmath71 and @xmath72 .",
    "as we will see in the next section , the resonant angle @xmath4 would be simply circulating in this case ; while a plausible scenario where there is a libration of @xmath4 around slc but slc itself circulates would never occur .",

[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     a comprehensive information of clts and ctts is given in table [ cltandctt ] . for test particles with @xmath104 , the capture efficiency of the asymmetric 1:2 nmmr ( i.e.",
    ", the sum of both leading and trailing cases ) is @xmath105 per cent , which is a bit higher than that in chiang & jordan ( 2002 ) ( @xmath106 per cent ) . considering their adopted migration time - scale of @xmath107 yr",
    ", such an efficiency enhancement is obviously due to a slower migration here with @xmath45 yr .",
    "more importantly , we find that there are more clts ( 26.2 per cent ) than ctts ( 23.2 per cent ) , contrary to the difference in the numbers of these two populations in chiang & jordan s calculations .    assuming a planar model , the slc of 1:2 resonant orbits is fixed at @xmath23 for @xmath108 where @xmath109 .",
    "this means that only the symmetric resonance trapping is possible at the moment of 1:2 nmmr encounter .",
    "as time passes , a particle may transit from symmetric to asymmetric libration when its eccentricity has been pumped up via the sweeping 1:2 nmmr or the associated kozai mechanism .",
    "as pointed out before by murray - clay & chiang ( 2005 ) , for @xmath110 yr , symmetric librators are preferentially caught into the tailing rather than the leading asymmetric resonance during the outward migration ; however , this trend could be reversed in a migration model with larger @xmath43 . the spatial distribution",
    "for which more asymmetric twotinos lie in the leading island is also supported by lykawka & mukai ( 2007 ) .    with the increase of @xmath12 , the probability of capture into the asymmetric 1:2 nmmr",
    "would be modified dramatically .",
    "firstly , for test particles with @xmath111 , the capture efficiency @xmath112 fails from 49.4 per cent for @xmath104 to 0.4 per cent for @xmath113 .",
    "particles that originate in this @xmath12-range can reside deeply in the asymmetric islands ( with low min@xmath114 , and therefore become long - term residents of the 1:2 nmmr . here",
    "we would like to stress that an overwhelming majority of clts and ctts have final @xmath3 larger than @xmath84 with regard to their particular @xmath0 .",
    "but there are two exceptions coming from the case of @xmath115 , because they have considerable oscillations of @xmath3 and will not strictly follow our semi - analytical approximation .",
    "secondly , for each @xmath116 , at most only one of the 911 test particles can be hijacked into the asymmetric 1:2 nmmr .",
    "for the two clts from @xmath117 , @xmath9 and the one ctt from @xmath118 with relatively large @xmath57 (= min@xmath57 ) , they are actually embedded in or very close to the unstable ( grey ) area in fig .",
    "[ asym ] . by extending the integrations , we confirm that these three individuals will evolve into the l&c orbits in less than several hundreds of myrs , and then escape from the resonance",
    ".    on the other hand , the influence of high @xmath12 could be very strong on the ratio of clts to ctts .",
    "an inclined particle captured by the sweeping 1:2 nmmr first evince the oscillation of @xmath4 around the slc , which may locate at any position between @xmath71 and @xmath72 when @xmath119 . as for the case of @xmath120 , on extremely short time - scales , the value of @xmath3 for the captive would be excited above @xmath121 by this resonance , then it will fall into the typical symmetric libration around the glc at @xmath23 .",
    "the subsequent evolution of such symmetric librators is equivalent to the scenario in the planar model described above , producing more twotinos in the leading island .",
    "however , when @xmath122 , the captive would never undergo a period of symmetric libration around @xmath123 prior to the emergence of the asymmetric islands .",
    "this is because , for orbits with @xmath18 , the glc at @xmath23 does not exist when @xmath124 , as we argued in section 2 . as a result",
    ", the probability of the captive to enter the leading or trailing island can not be determined by the analytic methods used in murray - clay & chiang ( 2005 ) .",
    "our numerical experiments demonstrate that the relative population of the clts and the ctts is continuously varying with @xmath125 .        in view of the above",
    ", the mechanism of resonant capture may exclude the existence of twotinos with @xmath126 .",
    "[ distribution ] supplies the distribution of inclinations for clts ( red ) , ctts ( green ) and csts ( blue ) , at the end of the @xmath31 yr migration simulation .",
    "it is visually apparent in this figure that most objects have inclinations within the range of the observed values ( @xmath127 ) . for even inclined twotinos ,",
    "the relative fraction is estimated to be about 4 per cent .",
    "this number is considered to be deduced from the total inclination distribution of all potential twotinos in the kuiper belt .",
    "as most surveys for kbos target near the ecliptic plane , the probability of discovering an object is crudely proportional to @xmath128 ( brown 2001 ) .",
    "thus , migration models can predict a weighted fraction as low as @xmath1290.1 per cent for the unknown twotinos with @xmath14 in future discoveries .    nevertheless , a more accurate comparison between the inclination distribution of observed twotinos ( fig .",
    "[ observed ] ) and that produced in our simulations ( fig .",
    "[ distribution ] ) shows a noticeable discrepancy .",
    "if we consider the high - inclination population with @xmath130 , the real twotinos give a fraction of @xmath131 , while the captured ones weighted with @xmath128 yield only @xmath132 .",
    "moreover , under a theoretical point of view , we chose the extreme and unrealistic disk initially having a uniform distribution in inclination up to @xmath9 .",
    "this may be an artifact in a primordial planetesimal disk , where would likely to have existed much less particles with higher inclinations .",
    "we expect that the intrinsic percentage of captured twotinos with @xmath130 should be even smaller , and too low to account for current observations .",
    "consequently , the twotinos must not have been formed solely by the resonance sweeping mechanism .",
    "an alternative hypothesis is that , a portion of twotinos may have originated from the chaotic capture of scattered kbos , resulting in a larger fraction of inclined twotinos ( lykawka & mukai 2006 ) .    the last piece of information about the migrating evolution of captured twotinos is linked to the eccentricity distribution .",
    "we notice in tables [ cst ] and [ cltandctt ] that a few particles are transported to nearly circular orbits with @xmath3 as small as 0.04 . in the context of adiabatic model",
    ", the longer migration distance leads to larger eccentricity excitation of a planetesimal locked in the 1:2 nmmr .",
    "given the outer edge of the planetesimal disk at 46.8 au , from equation ( 9 ) in lzs14 , it follows that a twotino with @xmath127 should have @xmath133 .",
    "the lower eccentricities obtained by our simulations can be readily accounted for by the temporary kozai mechanism , which may last shorter than a complete cycle of @xmath24-libration and transfer @xmath3 to @xmath0 irreversibly during the planet migration era ( gomes 2003 ) .      of captured twotinos coming from our simulations ,",
    "many objects exhibit the libration of @xmath24 after entering the migrating 1:2 nmmr , but only a small subset occupies the kozai mechanism at the end of the integration , recorded in tables [ cst ] and [ cltandctt ] . were the final 10 @xmath24-librators lasting one to several kozai cycle periods also transient residents ?",
    "to better confirm their kozai behaviors , we continued the integrations of these orbits for another @xmath31 yr without any migration .",
    "there are a total of 4 remaining @xmath24-librators : 1 in the symmetric resonance , and 3 in the leading asymmetric resonance .",
    "[ kozai]a displays the time evolution of @xmath24 for the one and only cst associated with the stable kozai state , from the case of @xmath104 .",
    "as it can be seen , the libration centre @xmath134 alters from time to time about @xmath71 , @xmath9 , @xmath23 and @xmath52 , which are equilibrium points of the kozai mechanism inside the symmetric 1:2 nmmr as shown in wan & huang ( 2007 ) .",
    "these authors also found that such long - lived @xmath24-librator does exist near the separatrix of kozai islands , and it would spend more time around the stable equilibrium points @xmath135 and @xmath52 than around the unstable ones @xmath136 and @xmath23 ( personal communication ) .",
    "for the asymmetric 1:2 nmmr , the kozai dynamics could be much different . because the libration centre of @xmath4 is not at @xmath71 or @xmath23 , the secular and 1:2 resonant terms containing @xmath137 in the disturbing function",
    "can not be averaged to be 0 .",

    "this outcome might explain today s observed void of kozai twotinos having @xmath18 or residing in the trailing resonance ( fig . [ observed ] )",
    ".    however , a principle issue is that , of the 1075 captured twotinos with @xmath127 , there are only 4 possible @xmath24-librators .",

    ", the migration - capture scenario would not be the sole mechanism to produce twotinos .",
    "here , the deficit of captured twotinos experiencing the kozai mechanism gives an extra evidence of this fact .",
    "-librators in the symmetric ( panel a ) and the leading asymmetric ( panels b , c ) 1:2 nmmr.,width=321 ]",
    "to continue our previous study of the high - inclination kbos , in which we explored the dynamic of plutinos with @xmath0 up to @xmath9 ( in lzs14 ) , this second paper is devoted to twotinos .",
    "we are acutely aware of the existence of symmetric and asymmetric motions in the 1:2 nmmr , thus twotinos may furnish a unique window on the distant past of the outer solar system .    using the semi - analytical method developed in lzs14 , for the first time",
    ", we provide a global picture of the dynamical aspects of the 1:2 nmmr in three dimensions . depending on the critical eccentricities @xmath1 and @xmath2",
    "as functions of the inclination @xmath0 , three different behaviors of the resonant angle @xmath4 have been found : ( 1 ) if @xmath63 , the circulation of @xmath4 by @xmath72 is certain ; ( 2 ) if @xmath64 , there appear a libration of @xmath4 around @xmath23 for @xmath144 , and another libration around @xmath71 for larger @xmath0 ; and ( 3 ) if @xmath65 , the asymmetric libration of @xmath4 becomes possible , meanwhile the symmetric libration around @xmath23 is also allowed . at zero inclination",
    ", we have @xmath86 and @xmath87 , equally consistent with earlier works ( beaug 1994 ; malhotra 1996 ) . but with increasing @xmath0 , these two quantities both shift to larger values , and @xmath84 achieves a maximum of @xmath88 when @xmath145 .",
    "these characteristics indicate that , for highly inclined orbits , the asymmetric libration islands can only emerge at large eccentricities .",
    "accordingly , we calculated the libration centres @xmath5 for 1:2 resonant orbits with @xmath146 , at specific @xmath3 .",
    "we have shown that , for high - inclination twotinos , their @xmath5 are strongly dependent on @xmath0 and could be very different from those of low - inclination ones .    with the initial @xmath6 on a particular grid of @xmath7 based on the above semi - analytical predictions , test particles initialized on 1:2 resonant orbits were numerically integrated with four jovian planets for times up to the age of the solar system .",
    "our principal findings for the long - term stability of twotinos can be briefly summarized as follows .",
    "\\(1 ) in the symmetric resonance , we find that the stable horseshoe orbits have @xmath147 , @xmath148 and resonant amplitudes @xmath149 .",
    "the most regular motion only exists in the low inclination region of @xmath150 , where initial horseshoe orbits can exhibit persistent libration of @xmath4 throughout the entire 4 gyr simulation . for more inclined particles",
    ", they are fated to undergo the frequent alternation between libration and circulation during the evolution , while many of them can survive as symmetric librators in the 1:2 nmmr .",
    "\\(2 ) in the asymmetric resonance , we find that the inclination coverage of stable tadpole orbits is @xmath151 for moderate @xmath96 , and as high as @xmath9 for large @xmath3 between 0.25 and 0.4 . by measuring the full resonant amplitude @xmath152 over the 4 gyr interval , the dynamical maps have been constructed on the plane of initial resonant amplitude versus initial inclination .",
    "it is shown that the stable regions are generally delimited by initial @xmath153 , but their widths are quite distinct at different initial @xmath0 .",
    "the unstable tadpole librators are principally accounted for by the appearance of the kozai mechanism . however , their escaping routes from the 1:2 nmmr could be drastically different for small ( @xmath154 ) , medium ( @xmath103@xmath155 ) and high ( @xmath156@xmath9 ) inclinations .",
    "overall , there is no statistically significant discrepancy in the dynamical structure between the leading and trailing asymmetric resonances .",
    "then , we further investigated the evolution of primordially inclined planetesimals with respect to the 1:2 nmmr sweeping and capture , for which neptune starts at @xmath157 au and migrates slowly with a time - scale of @xmath45 yr . at each @xmath12 between @xmath71 and @xmath9 ( @xmath158 ) , 911 test particles with @xmath159 au ( @xmath160 au ) and @xmath161 have been introduced . of surviving objects in the 1:2 nmmr zone at the end of the migration , according to the above stability analysis ,",
    "we defined captured twotinos as : captured symmetric twotinos ( csts ) with @xmath149 ; captured leading twotinos ( clts ) and captured trailing twotinos ( ctts ) with @xmath153 .",
    "our results show that the capture efficiency of the symmetric 1:2 nmmr , @xmath162 , decays from 4.7% to 0.2% as the initial inclination @xmath12 increases from @xmath71 to @xmath156 . while for @xmath163 , there is a complete absence of csts .",
    "the final inclinations of csts suggest an upper limit of @xmath164 for potential symmetric twotinos , which is just inside the border of the totally unstable horseshoe region at @xmath8 .",
    "as for the asymmetric 1:2 nmmr , the capture efficiency @xmath165 fails from 49.4 per cent for @xmath104 to 0.4 per cent for @xmath113 .",
    "particles originated in this @xmath12-range can possess small enough @xmath57 to reside deeply in the asymmetric islands , and therefore form long - lived residents .",
    "for few clts and ctts with relatively large @xmath57 from the cases of @xmath116 , they are actually embedded in or very close to unstable regions and will ultimately escape from this resonance . by combining the inclination distributions of csts , clts and ctts , resonance sweeping",
    "capture may exclude the existence of twotinos with @xmath126 .",
    "moreover , this very mechanism predicts that the probability of discovering twotinos with higher inclinations @xmath14 than observed values , near the ecliptic plane , is only @xmath166 per cent .",
    "analytic arguments tell us that the ratio of clts to ctts is largely determined by two factors : neptune s migration time - scale and initial particle eccentricity ( murray - clay & chiang 2005 ) . in addition",
    ", we found that the influence of initial particle inclination @xmath12 could also be great on this ratio , provided small particle eccentricity of @xmath108 .",
    "when @xmath16 , a particle is captured first into the symmetric 1:2 nmmr when neptune migrates outward , then it will follow the dynamical pathway described in murray - clay & chiang ( 2005 ) . due to the long migration time - scale of @xmath45 yr",
    ", such symmetric librator is preferentially caught into the leading rather than the trailing asymmetric resonance . however , for the case of @xmath122 , a particle captured by the sweeping 1:2 nnmr from a nearly circular orbit would never firstly fall into the symmetric resonance .",
    "this is because the libration of @xmath4 around @xmath23 is not permitted for orbits with @xmath18 and @xmath124 , as we have learned in the semi - analysis part . as a result , in the subsequent evolution ,",
    "the probability of the high - inclination captive to enter the leading or trailing islands is not certain but would be continuously varying with @xmath125 .    among captured twotinos from our simulations",
    ", we obtained a total of 4 potential @xmath24-librators : 1 in the symmetric resonance , 3 in the leading asymmetric resonance .",
    "these kozai twotinos all come from the cases of @xmath16 . despite somewhat excitation due to the kozai mechanism ,",
    "their @xmath0 would always undergo low value episode below @xmath167 and end at @xmath168 .",
    "this outcome seems compatible with today s observed void of kozai twotinos residing in the trailing islands or having @xmath18 .",
    "nevertheless , the planet migration model suffers from two major problems : ( 1 ) the fraction of captured twotinos with high inclinations is 12 orders of magnitude too low to account for present observations ; ( 2 ) the capture efficiency of the kozai mechanism that we obtain is only @xmath142 per cent , whereas the observed value is @xmath169 per cent .",
    "these discrepancies argue that an unknown fraction of currently observed twotinos is not likely to originate by the resonance sweeping mechanism from a planetesimal disk interior to 47.8 au .",
    "these particular objects indicate that there is a distinct source region for the high - inclination twotinos , and they might be able to promise new insight into the dynamical history of the kuiper belt .",
    "we expect our future works could tell .",
