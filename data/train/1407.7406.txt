    "in many recent developments involving cosmological models and brane collisions in higher - dimensional gravity theories @xcite , the dynamical @xmath0-branes carrying charges have played important roles . in the classical solution of a single @xmath0-brane , the coupling of the dilaton to the field strength includes the parameter @xmath3 .",
    "since these brane solutions with @xmath4 are related to well - known d - branes and m - branes in supergravity theories , they certainly exhibit many attractive properties in the higher - dimensional spacetime .",
    "some static solutions with @xmath5 also have supersymmetry after dimensional reductions to lower - dimensional theory @xcite .",
    "the time - dependent generalizations of these solutions are thus important examples of higher - dimensional gravity theories .",

    ", we have found that the dynamical single 0-brane solution describes the milne universe @xcite .",

    "the construction of intersecting branes with a cosmological constant is a natural generalization of the single cosmological brane solutions .",

    "however , in the higher - dimensional gravity theories , one of the branes is localized along the relative transverse directions but delocalized along the overall transverse directions , which are partially localized branes solutions .",

    "a brane configuration has to satisfy an intersection rule which is an algebraic equation that relates the coupling of the dilaton to the dimensionality of the branes .",

    "an exceptional case arises if the parameter @xmath3 in the dilaton coupling takes another value than 4 .",

    "gets asymptotically power - law expanding solutions if the dilaton is nontrivial . for the trivial dilaton ,",
    "the einstein equations give an asymptotically de sitter solution for a single 2-form field strength .",
    "since the cosmological constant is related to the field strength , the time derivative of the warp factor arises only from the ricci tensor and can be compensated by the cosmological constant in the einstein equations .",
    "this is the same structure as in refs .",
    "@xcite and the generalization of the solutions @xcite . in @xmath4 case ,",
    "the equation of motion in the presence of the cosmological constant gives the static delocalized or partially localized intersecting brane solution because of the ansatz of the fields .",
    "thus , one expects that the recipe for picking an accelerating expansion from the dynamical intersecting brane solutions depends on the dilaton coupling constant , and this is the case for the proposal in ref .",
    "once the de sitter solution is obtained in the single @xmath0-brane solutions , it is possible to apply it to the intersecting brane systems .",
    "an immediate point is that the time - dependent solutions make dynamical compactification more or less obvious , since cosmological evolution is a general property of the solution ( with constant parameters ) once the function @xmath190 is properly endowed with the time dependence .",
    "the power of the scale factor in some solutions gives an accelerating expansion law even in the case that functions @xmath190 depend on both the time and coordinates of overall transverse space , while the extra dimension will shrink as cosmic time increases .",
    "however , something is still missing , because the scale factor of our universe diverges at @xmath225 . at the moment , it is not clear how to do this .    we have discussed the dynamics of the brane collisions . as the spacetime is contracting in the @xmath6-dimensional spacetime , each 0-brane approaches others as the time evolves for @xmath336 but separates for @xmath315 in the asymptotically power - law expanding solutions .",

    ", the @xmath334-brane system in ten dimensions or the smeared @xmath2-brane system in @xmath6-dimensional theory can provide examples of colliding branes if they have the same brane charges and only one overall transverse space .",

    "the brane collision would not occur if the brane charges are different .",
    "moreover , if these branes are localized at different positions , it raises the possibility that the curvature singularities appear .",
    "we have also studied the dynamics of the five- or six - dimensional supergravity models with applications to cosmology and collision of branes .",
    "first we have discussed the brane solutions to study the time evolution in the nss model . in the case of vanishing 3-form field strength in the five - dimensional effective theory ,",
    "the scale factor of our four - dimensional spacetime is a linear function of the cosmic time which is the same evolution as the milne universe . on the other hand , for the dynamical",
    "1-brane without 2-form field strength , the solution tells us that the function @xmath188 depends on all the world - volume coordinates of the 1-brane .",
    "hence , the contribution of the field strength except for the 2-form leads to an inhomogeneous universe .",
    "we have investigated the dynamics of 0-branes and found that , when the spacetime is contracting in six dimensions , each 0-brane approaches the others as the time evolves .",
    "all domains between branes connected initially ( @xmath262 ) , but it shrinks as @xmath91 increases . however , for the 0-brane system without smearing branes , a singularity appears before 0-branes collide , and eventually the topology of the spacetime changes such that parts of the branes are separated by a singular region surrounding each brane .",

    "thus , in the case of @xmath532 , 1-branes never collide . on the other hand , the case of @xmath489 , for @xmath264 , could provide an example of colliding 1-branes .",
    "we found that the collision time depends on both brane charges and the place in the world volume of the 1-brane . since this case has the time - reversal symmetry , the evolution for @xmath259 is obtained by the time - reversal transformation .",
    "we also investigated the time - dependent solution in the five - dimensional supergravity model .",
    "the power of the scale factor is so small that the solutions can not give a realistic expansion law .",
    "then , it is necessary to include additional matter on the background in order to obtain a realistic expanding universe .",
    "we finally analyzed the classical instability of the dynamical brane background towards singularity . in order to present the instability of the dynamical brane background",
    ", we have estimated whether an instability does exist by computing the energy of the klein - gordon modes .",
    "one can find that the energy seen by an observer diverges as the curvature singularity is approached .",
    "this implies that the mode of the scalar field is likely to destabilize the background metric modes near the singularity .",
    "although this result has been given by preliminary analysis , it has made the property of singularity in the dynamical brane background more clear .",
    "it is also necessary for us to perform a more rigorous analysis by considering in detail the metric perturbation whether the stability analysis arrives to the same conclusion or not .",
    "a recent study of intersecting systems depending on the time coordinate and overall transverse space shows that all warp factors in the solutions can depend on time @xcite .",
