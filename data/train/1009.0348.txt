    "the radio spectrum of dark clouds has recently come under scrutiny following the proposal that their centimetre - wave emission is due to spinning dust ( casassus et  al .",
    "2006 ; ami consortium : scaife et  al . 2009a , b ; 2010 ) .",
    "these observational studies have largely concentrated on the arcminute scale emission , neglecting the known small scale radio emission detected from a significant fraction of protostars ( anglada 1995 ; rodrguez et  al .",
    "as these investigations become more detailed it is necessary to quantify correctly this emission in order to avoid confusing it with that arising from spinning dust when observing at resolutions where the two may not be easily distinguishable .",
    "most radio protostar searches and surveys ( e.g. anglada 1995 ; stamatellos et  al . 2009 ; andr et  al .",
    "1987 ) are conducted at 3.6 and 6 cm wavelengths , however the spectrum of emission due to spinning dust is thought to peak at shorter wavelengths of 12 cm ( drain & lazarian 1998 ) and this is the wavelength range where most spinning dust observations are made .",
    "although a few observations towards specific sources have been made at 2 cm ( rodrguez & canto 1983 ; bieging , cohen & schwartz 1984 ; pravdo 1985 ; rodrguez & reipurth 1997 ; andr , motte & bacmann 1999 ) their number is still limited , particularly in the case of low luminosity protostars and class o objects .    longer wavelength radio emission is capable of escaping from the high column density envelopes which surround deeply embedded young protostars , making it an appropriate mechanism for searching for such objects .",
    "very high sensitivity observations are required as the thermal ( vibrational ) dust spectrum falls off steeply in intensity at longer wavelengths .",
    "however , young and low luminosity protostars are also known to produce additional radio emission which can make them more easily detectable . in general",
    "this radio emission has been observed to possess a rising spectrum , indicating that it occurs as a consequence of free  free radiation from ionized gas .",
    "the spectral index of such emission ( defined as @xmath3 , where @xmath4 ) can lie anywhere in the range @xmath5 .",
    "an index of @xmath6 indicates optically thin free - free emission , whereas @xmath7 indicates optically thick ; values intermediate to these limits imply a medium which is partially optically thick ( reynolds 1986 ) . in the case of a spherically symmetric shell of decreasing density with @xmath8 , @xmath9 .",
    "a number of mechanisms have been proposed to produce free  free emission in the immediate vicinity of stellar objects : where a high enough ionizing flux is present , generally in later type t tauri stars , photoionization can support an embedded hii region ( churchwell 1990 ) ; a fully ionized stellar wind , again associated more often with later type stars , would produce an easily observable radio signal ( panagia & felli 1975 ; curiel et  al .",
    "1989 ) , as could a partially ionized , collimated outflow ( reynolds 1986 ) ; the accretion shock on the surface of protostellar discs may heat and ionize infalling gas ( winkler & newman 1980 ; cassen & moosman 1981 ) ; the molecular outflows from young , low mass protostars and the neutral winds thought to initiate them can generate free  free emission through shock ionization as they impact on the surrounding envelope ( curiel et  al . 1987 ; 1989 ; rodrguez & reipurth 1996 ) . in the case of low luminosity protostars",
    "it is the last of these mechanisms which is considered to be most plausible and indeed , where measured , the outflow force of most protostellar jets has been found to be energetically viable to explain the observed cm - wave radio emission ( anglada 1995 ) .",
    "this theory is also supported by very high angular resolution observations of the radio emission from protostars ( simon et  al .",
    "1983 ; anglada 1996 ) , which find that the radio emission is elongated along the direction of the molecular outflows",
    ".    recent measurements of the luminosity distribution of protostars from the _ spitzer _ space telescope ( dunham et  al .",
    "2008 ; evans et  al . 2009 ) have aggravated the `` luminosity problem '' first articulated by kenyon et  al .",
    "the trend is increasing numbers of protostars at lower luminosities down to an internal luminosity , which describes the total luminosity of the central protostar and circumstellar disc , of @xmath10 , below which the numbers start to decline .",
    "for young embedded protostars the accretion luminosity will dominate over that from the stellar photosphere .",
    "however , simple star formation models , such as the spherical accretion model of shu ( 1977 ) , predict that a low mass source on the stellar / brown dwarf boundary ( @xmath11 ) should have an internal luminosity @xmath12 from accretion alone ( evans et  al .",
    "non - steady accretion , starting in the earliest protostellar stages , is currently the best solution to this discrepancy ( kenyon & hartmann 1995 ; young & evans 2005 ; enoch et  al . 2007 ) .",
    "the luminosity problem is most difficult to rectify in very low luminosity objects ( vellos ; young et  al .",
    "2004 ; dunham et  al .",
    "2008 ) with extreme luminosities @xmath13 .",
    "the nature of these objects is unclear , whether they are young class o protostars which are just powering up , or are more evolved but in a low accretion state ( dunham et  al .",
    "2008 ; evans et  al . 2009 ) .    the vello iram  04191-irs ( andr et  al .",
    "1999 ) is a good example of this situation .",
    "iram  04191-irs has a well measured molecular outflow , from which the mass accretion onto the protostar can be calculated ( andr et  al .",
    "1999 ; dunham et  al .",
    "the luminosity expected from this accretion , using steady accretion arguments , is found to be 25 times the measured value ( dunham et  al .",
    "however , it is not the case that all vellos are so well defined , and indeed many of their physical properties are often inconsistent ( bourke et  al 2006 ) . the existing sample of vello sources , although expanded by _",
    "( dunham et  al . 2008 ) , is in no way complete .",
    "vellos are difficult to confirm as protostars in the infra - red due to their low luminosity and embedded nature , and measuring their molecular outflows may also be problematic as exemplified by the case of l1014 ( bourke et  al . 2005 ; crapsi et  al . 2005 ) .",
    "it is also the case that vellos are often found in cores which are not only assumed to be starless , but which were also not believed to be approaching collapse ( bourke et  al .",
    "nevertheless , identifying a complete sample of these low luminosty embedded protostars is vital for understanding low mass star formation .",
    "this paper presents high resolution , high sensitivity observations towards a sample of known or proposed protostellar objects all located within clouds targeted by a joint arcminute microkelvin imager ( ami ) and sunyaev ",

    "2003 ) and is designed to measure the emission from the clouds on arcminute scales .",
    "the majority of the cores observed here have low bolometric luminosity , with a significant proportion being very low luminosity objects . since these studies are on differing scales but target the same regions we now explicitly define our nomenclature . _",
    "cores _ are defined as compact objects on scales of a few tenths of a parsec and are typically identified at sub - mm wavelengths .",
    "cores can be protostellar or starless , a distinction made on the basis of their seds , the presence of an ir source , a molecular outflow or a compact cm - wave source ( andr et  al .",
    "vellos are a subset of cores , which until recently were often presumed to be starless but are in fact a low luminosity embedded population .",

    "eight complex visibilities are formed in 0.75ghz bandwidth channels . in practice , the two lowest frequency channels ( 1 & 2 ) are not generally used due to a lower response in this frequency range and interference from geostationary satellites .",

    "the bracketed values indicate the number of vellos within this bin that have not been confirmed independently of their _ spitzer _ identification and which may be confused by the physical mechanisms discussed in   [ sec : nd ] .",
    "a starred value indicates a number which includes an object with a borderline class ( e.g. l1152  smm and bern  48 ) . the detection rate does not vary a great deal across the protostellar objects .",
    "a detection rate of zero towards starless objects confirms that the radio emission we see arises from a physical process other than a flattened dust tail due to vibrational emission .",
    "this highlights the ability of 16ghz radio observations to identify protostellar activity in cores which do not possess definitive sub - mm or infra - red measurements .",
    "the rising radio spectrum of the cm - wave emission from protostellar objects makes higher radio frequencies more suitable for their detection than the longer wavelengths often employed .",
    "the low intensity of thermal dust emission at frequencies below @xmath21ghz greatly reduces the possibility of confusing the observed radio emission associated with molecular outflows or stellar winds , and therefore an indication of protostellar activity , with the cold dust tail from starless cores .",
    "the combination of these two effects makes 16ghz an effective frequency at which to distinguish protostellar objects and starless cores .",
    "this situation also extends to the very low luminosity objects , vellos , and embedded objects since the dense cores surrounding these objects are transparent to the longer wavelengths of the radio emission .",
    "two of the objects detected here , l723-irs and l1165-irs , were classified as poor candidates for embedded objects by dunham et  al .",
    "however the cm - wave emission we detect towards these sources might suggest that some protostellar activity is present .",
    "as previously noted these objects may be external galaxies , or possibly later type stars which have been mis - identified in the mir data , both of which could have radio counterparts .",
    "however , in both cases the morphology of the radio emission is not point - like , notably so in the case of l1165-irs , which suggests that the radio emission is most probably not from a stellar wind in a later type star as this is generally well modelled by a spherical morphology and would appear point - like to the ami - la synthesized beam .",
    "if the radio emission arose from an external galaxy we would expect to see a steep spectrum synchrotron component and therefore also be able to identify the source in lower frequency radio data .",
    "more information is necessary to conclusively identify these objects as protostellar cores .",
    "the radio emission from the sources detected here is generally @xmath22mjy and has a relatively compact morphology , although cb188  smm-1 is possibly an exception to this situation . as such",
    "it should not provide a major source of confusion for spinning dust studies of the surrounding clouds that contain these cores , which are generally conducted on much larger angular scales .",
    "the results presented here have shown that , in the absence of 70@xmath23 m data , it is possible that the radio luminosity may be used as a proxy for the internal luminosity of embedded protostellar objects and to enable a larger sample of vellos to be identified . however , at present the correlation presented here suffers from a lack of data and will require further observations to define the trend more completely .",
