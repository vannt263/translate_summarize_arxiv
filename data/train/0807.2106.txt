    "the anomalous x - ray pulsars ( axps ) and soft gamma repeaters ( sgrs ) have spin down properties indicative of magnetic fields of @xmath14 g which places them at the high end of the neutron star field distribution .",
    "the source of the quiescent x - ray luminosity in both the sgrs and the axps is unclear , but it is generally believed that it is associated with the decay of some component of the magnetic field .",
    "the standard model of @xcite assumes that the fields are generated at the time of formation of the neutron star by an efficient @xmath15 dynamo that operates at low rossby numbers and requires millisecond birth periods .",
    "neutron stars born with initial periods @xmath16 are predicted to generate large scale magnetic fields of @xmath17 under optimum conditions , which is more than adequate to explain the fields in magnetars .",
    "a consequence of the rapid initial spin predicted for these models is that the supernova explosions that create the magnetars are expected to be an order of magnitude more energetic than ordinary core - collapse supernovae , if one makes the standard assumption that angular momentum is lost by magnetic braking and not by gravitational radiation or due to emission in a jet .",
    "however , the energetics of some well studied supernova remnants associated with magnetars , appear to suggest that their formation may not always be accompanied by a hypernova explosion @xcite .",
    "the origin of magnetic fields in magnetars therefore remains unclear .",
    "recent observations have provided two additional clues on the origin of magnetars .",
    "firstly , several magnetars have been associated with massive star clusters .",
    "the magnetar candidate cxo j164710.2 - 455216 has been associated with the open cluster westerlund  1 @xcite and sgr 1806 - 20 with the giant galactic hii complex w31 @xcite , both suggesting progenitors with @xmath18 .",
    "massive ( @xmath19 ) progenitors appear also to be indicated for sgr 1627 - 41 @xcite and sgr 0526 - 66 @xcite .",
    "interestingly , the progenitors have masses in the range @xmath20 where interaction with a fall - back disc is expected to play an important role in determining the ultimate outcome of stellar evolution - namely whether a neutron star or a black hole forms @xcite .",
    "a second clue comes from the discovery that more massive stars tend to have higher magnetic fluxes than less massive stars , and that the incidence of magnetism on the main sequence increases with mass .",
    "some @xmath21% of o and early b stars in the orion cluster are strongly magnetic with fields in the range @xmath22  g ( @xcite , @xcite ) so that the progenitors of the magnetars are also likely to be strongly magnetic .",
    "fossil magnetic fluxes similar to those observed in the magnetars may already be present in stellar cores prior to collapse and could give rise to global magnetic fields of @xmath23  g either directly through magnetic flux conservation , or indirectly by acting as seed fields for a dynamo . in this context , we note that while the dynamo mechanism is effective in generating weak fields of the order of the equi - partition value in the convective cores of stars with radiative envelopes @xcite , much stronger fields can be generated by the dynamo mechanism if a fossil field is present in the radiative region @xcite .    in this paper , we carry out a population synthesis study to analyse the observed numbers of magnetars and their magnetic field and period distributions allowing for x - ray selection effects .",
    "our basic premise is that the birth magnetic field of a neutron star is related primarily to the mass of the progenitor star @xmath3 .",
    "our aim is to determine the form of this relationship in the hope that it may provide some insights into the origin of magnetars .",
    "we assume that the magnetic field of a magnetar is composed of two components , as in @xcite : an underlying dipolar component @xmath24 and a crustal component @xmath25 .",
    "we assume that the dipolar component is a global field that does not decay on a time scale of @xmath26  yr , the lower limit to the field decay time scales in normal radio pulsars ( e.g. see the most recent population syntheses calculations of @xcite , @xcite ( hereafter fw ) , @xcite ) and is solely responsible for the spin down of the magnetar which occurs along constant field lines .",
    "the crustal component is envisioned to be a toroidal or tangled field which does not partake in the spin down of the star , decays on time scales of @xmath27  yr , and is the source of the anomalous x - ray and @xmath28ray emission ( see section [ results ] for a discussion of the alternative hypothesis that the spin down is due to a decaying field ) .",
    "the apparent upper limit of @xmath29  s for the spin periods of magnetars has to be attributed to the expected rapid decline in the x - ray luminosity predicted by field decay models ( e.g. see the period clustering study of @xcite ) .",
    "models of neutron stars with a heat source in the crust predict that cooling will occur initially at a nearly constant luminosity after which the luminosity will decay exponentially to negligible values @xcite , but there are no detailed models that investigate the dependence of decay rates on initial magnetic field and envelope composition . in the absence of such calculations ,",
    "we have adopted the following parametrisation to describe the decline of the crustal luminosity @xmath30 where @xmath31 here , @xmath32 and @xmath33 are constants , and we have assumed that the birth crustal luminosity is proportional to the intrinsic dipolar field .",
    "we have also allowed for the possibility that the decay time is a function of the magnetar s field strength @xmath24 via the parameter @xmath34 .",
    "recently , there have been detailed stellar evolution calculations for stars in the mass range @xmath35 that have attempted to incorporate magnetic fields and rotation @xcite .",
    "these calculations allowed for fields generated in the differentially rotating radiative regions of stars and their effect on the transport of angular momentum , on the assumption that a dynamo mechanism is in operation . however , the basic premise on which these calculations were made has recently been seriously challenged by @xcite .",
    "therefore , the role played by magnetic fields and rotation in the evolution of stars still remains uncertain .",
    "it is likely that the magnetic flux of the progenitor star , @xmath36 , and to a lesser extent the initial angular momentum , both play an important role in determining the magnetic flux @xmath37 of the nascent neutron star . in our modelling , we assume that the progenitor mass @xmath3 is the primary variable that describes the birth magnetic flux of the neutron star .",
    "our modelling procedure is as discussed in fw , except for our treatment of the birth magnetic flux and birth spin period .",
    "briefly , we begin with a dynamical model for the galaxy , an initial mass function , and an initial - final mass relationship for neutron stars .",
    "we then follow the spin evolution and motion of neutron stars and calculate the properties of the currently observed population of magnetars allowing for x - ray selection effects .    in the present study",
    ", we assume that the birth magnetic flux of the neutron star is distributed as a gaussian about a mean that is given by a power law @xmath38 with dispersion @xmath39 . for consistency with our previous study of radio pulsars , we assume @xmath40 and deduce the exponent @xmath7 from the study of magnetars .",
    "the birth spin period is assumed to be given by a gaussian distribution with mean @xmath41 and dispersion @xmath42 .",
    "the birth magnetic field of the neutron stars is calculated from @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the radius of the neutron star in cm given by the mass - radius relationship for neutron stars which depends on the equation of state ( see fw for further details ) .",
    "we have chosen to use the subset of magnetars discovered from the _ rosat _ all - sky survey to constrain our models . in order to achieve this",
    ", we need to account for interstellar extinction and x - ray selection effects .",
    "we have implemented the methodology laid out by @xcite for finding the percentage of the magnetars in our calculations that yield a _",
    "rosat _ limiting count rate of 0.015 counts  s@xmath13 in the @xmath45  kev energy range @xcite .",
    "our synthetic objects have been assigned a two - component model ( power law and blackbody ) modulated by interstellar absorption .",
    "hence , as in @xcite , the number of photons in the energy range @xmath46  @xmath47  @xmath48 is given by    @xmath49e^{\\displaystyle{-n_h\\sigma(e)}}\\,de\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    here , @xmath50 is the power - law normalisation in units of photons kev@xmath13@xmath51s@xmath13 , @xmath52 is the power law energy index , @xmath53 is the temperature in kev and @xmath54 is the blackbody normalisation in units of @xmath55 , where @xmath56 is the luminosity in units of @xmath57 erg  s@xmath13 and @xmath58 the distance in units of 10 kpc . the neutral hydrogen column density @xmath59 is obtained using the @xcite model of the galactic hi distribution .",
    "the photoelectric absorption cross - sections @xmath60 are from @xcite used with the ism abundances of @xcite . in order to convert the absolute photon fluxes into the photon counts of the x - ray telescope ( xrt ) detector ,",
    "we have used the _ rosat _",
    "calibration guidelines and the xrt effective area combined with the pspc sensitivity .    in our modelling",
    ", the magnetars have been assigned a temperature and an energy index according to gaussian distributions with means and spreads @xmath61 and @xmath62 respectively .",
    "the relative contribution of the black body and power law components to the total x - ray luminosity has been randomly assigned with values consistent with the observed distribution given by @xcite .",
    "we have computed a series of models for different values @xmath63 , @xmath7 , @xmath64 , @xmath65 , @xmath66 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 until a model is obtained that satisfies the following criteria : ( a ) the model must envelope and provide a reasonable representation of the observed period and magnetic field distributions and ( b ) the total number of observed magnetars must be less than the theoretically predicted number after x - ray selection effects are taken into consideration .",
    "given the small number of magnetars and the unknown number of active , but currently dormant magnetars ( e.g. objects such as sgr  1627 - 41 that has only recently re - activated after a nearly 10 year long quiescent period @xcite ) , the real galactic distributions is not well enough sampled to justify a more detailed modelling .",
    "[ best_fit ]    = 0.7    the total number of active magnetars in the galaxy depends strongly on @xmath63 because of the rapidly declining initial mass function .",
    "our calculations show that in addition to the initial mass function , the parameters @xmath7 , @xmath67 , @xmath68 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 together determine the magnetic field , period , and period derivative distributions .",
    "our results are rather insensitive to @xmath65 and @xmath42 because of the rapid initial spin down of magnetars .",
    "hence , this study can not exclude the possibility that magnetars are born at millisecond periods as required by some recent models @xcite , or that the birth spin period may be a function of magnetic field as assumed in fw . for simplicity ,",
    "in our models we have adopted @xmath69 seconds and @xmath70 second , although the fw prescription with an upper initial period cutoff at @xmath71 seconds is also acceptable .",
    "we present in figure  1 our favoured model with @xmath72 , @xmath73 , @xmath74 , @xmath75 , @xmath76  yr , and @xmath77 .",
    "the corresponding birthrate is @xmath78",
    "this model best envelopes the field , period , period derivative , characteristic age , luminosity and temperature distributions and predicts 26 active magnetars after applying the _ rosat _ detectability criteria .",
    "we exclude the possibility of a significantly lower @xmath63 ( e.g. @xmath79 ) on the grounds that it will lead to a conflict with the birth rate of radio pulsars which we assume arise from stars with @xmath80 . on the other hand",
    ", the use of a significantly higher @xmath63 ( @xmath81 ) leads to too few magnetars and inconsistencies with the observed distributions .",
    "we have also constructed a @xmath82 diagram which is shown in figure 2 where our _ rosat _ selected objects are compared with the observations of all magnetars with known @xmath83 .",
    "thus , among the observed objects we have also included sgr  0526 - 66 , which is located in the lmc , and cxou  j010043 - 721134 which is in the smc , since their position in the @xmath84 diagram is unlikely to depend on which galaxy they reside .",
    "the predicted number of active magnetars from our favoured model can be reconciled with the observed number of 5 _ rosat _ detected sources if we assume that only @xmath85% of magnetars were in an active state which brought them to a high enough luminosity to be detected by this satellite . in this case , the actual birthrate of magnetars would be @xmath86yr@xmath13 , which of course depends on our basic assumption that all stars in the mass range @xmath87 produce magnetars . however , we note that the total number of observed magnetars in the galaxy is only 14 .",
    "if no additional magnetars exist in our galaxy , that is if all magnetars have already been discovered , this means that we have produced too many magnetars from progenitors in the mass range @xmath87 .",
    "this may suggest that some 50% of stars in this mass range will produce black holes .",
    "if this is the case , the birth rate of magnetars would reduce to @xmath88yr@xmath13 .",
    "studies of sgr bursts conducted by @xcite indicated that there can not be more than 7 active sgrs in the galaxy and @xcite suggested that magnetars are born at a rate of about @xmath89 per century .",
    "the recent study carried out by @xcite was based on a study of the five axps detected in the _ rosat _ all - sky survey , and indicated a birthrate of 0.22 per century with their progenitors being massive main sequence stars .",
    "both these estimates are generally consistent with the birth rate that we deduce .",
    "another recent study carried out by @xcite who searched for magnetars in archival chandra and xmm - newton observations of the galactic plane , yielded a birthrate in the range @xmath90 yr@xmath13 .",
    "the upper end of this range is excluded by our calculations .    on the fossil field hypothesis ,",
    "the high value indicated for the magnetic flux index @xmath7 may simply reflect the intrinsic magnetic flux distribution on the main sequence .",
    "observations of main sequence stars show that the maximum magnetic fluxes observed on the main sequence map on to the magnetic fluxes of the highest field magnetic white dwarfs ( @xmath91  g ) and neutron stars ( @xmath92 g ) rather well .",
    "however , due to sensitivity limitations of polarimetric observations , only the upper end of the magnetic field distribution of main sequence stars ( the strongly magnetic stars ) can be observed , so we only have a partial picture of magnetism on the main sequence .",
    "unfortunately , most stars in the mass range @xmath93 that give rise to radio pulsars have magnetic fluxes well below the currently observed range on the main sequence so that the index @xmath7 can not be empirically estimated .",
    "we note however that magnetic fluxes similar to those inferred in magnetars occur in @xmath8% of massive b and o - type stars .",
    "if we somehow dismiss the close similarities between the magnetic fluxes of massive main sequence stars and magnetars by putting them down to mere coincidence , alternatives to the fossil field hypothesis need to be explored .",
    "it is possible that the mass of the progenitor determines the spin of the nascent neutron star and thereby the strength of a dynamo generated field .",
    "support for this hypothesis comes from the calculations of @xcite which allow for angular momentum transport by magnetic fields generated by differential rotation during stellar evolution .",
    "these show that more massive stars tend to produce more rapidly spinning neutron stars . for a @xmath94 progenitor ( the highest mass they considered )",
    ", they predict that the neutron star will have a spin period of @xmath95  ms which is rapid enough for the generation of a a magnetar - type field by the @xmath10 dynamo mechanism of @xcite .",
    "however , for this to be a viable explanation of the magnetars , the @xmath10 dynamo mechanism would need to be effective for neutron stars that arise from progenitors with significantly lower masses ( @xmath96 ) or the derived birthrate of magnetars would be too low to explain the observations . furthermore , since the calculations of @xcite have been seriously challenged by @xcite , it appears that we are still waiting for more stellar evolution calculations , that allow for both magnetic field and rotation , to show us whether or not millisecond rotation periods can result from massive stars .",
    "if such periods can be achieved , this would give support to the idea that the dynamo model is a viable alternative to the fossil field hypothesis , although it is likely that a fossil field could still play the role of a seed field .",
    "= 0.4    [ ppdot_diag ]    it is relevant that we comment on the alternative to our basic hypothesis on spin evolution , namely that the field that decays is also the field that drives spin evolution during the magnetar phase .",
    "we have considered this possibility using `` avenue c '' of @xcite , but excluded it from our present considerations because it failed to populate the high field end of the observed magnetar field distribution .",
    "it is conceivable that with the use of different field decay parameters for avenue c we may also be able to model the data , but we expect that such a model will need to have field characteristics during the magnetar phase that are so similar to those adopted in the present calculations that our major conclusions will remain largely unchanged .    in conclusion , we note that the origin of the crustal field component in magnetars remains unresolved . @xcite have shown that the shearing of a poloidal field of fossil origin in a differentially rotating radiative region can lead to the generation of a toroidal field so that field complexity of the type that appears to be required in magnetars may arise naturally from stellar evolution , when the complex interplay between rotation and fossil magnetic fields is taken into consideration . on the other hand ,",
    "since fall - back discs are expected to play a role in the evolution of stars in the mass range @xmath97 , it is tempting to speculate that the crustal field component that characterises the magnetars may have its origin in the interaction of the fall - back disc with the magnetic field of the stellar core , in cases where a magnetar is the outcome of stellar evolution .",
    "if this is the case , one would expect that most of the mass in the fall - back disc would be magnetically ejected .",
    "the authors would like to thank the referee , u. geppert , for valuable comments and koji mukai for providing assistance with the rosat / pspc x - ray selection software ."
