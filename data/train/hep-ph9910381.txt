    "exclusive reactions are a very powerful tool to study the transition between weakly interacting quarks at small distances and large distance effects such as the quark confinement responsible for the hadron structure .",
    "one of the cleanest ways to tackle this problem is via virtual compton scattering ( vcs ) , even though this reaction is experimentally challenging for a number of reasons .",
    "first , the cross - section is small and decreases as @xmath1 or @xmath2 increases .",
    "furthermore , the vcs process ( @xmath0 ) has to be separated from a number of concurrent background processes , often with counting rates several times higher than the vcs itself . until recently this kind of experiment was not achievable because it requires high beam current , high duty cycle , and low emittance .",
    "the advent of cebaf , enabled us to perform the first vcs experiment above the pion threshold at high q@xmath3 and s. this experiment is currently under analysis.@xcite in the upcoming years this machine will be upgraded to 8 gev , then 12 gev and perhaps 24 gev in the future . in the same time",
    ", the elfe project in europe is planning to use the existing lep cavities to build a 30 gev machine with similar beam characteristics @xcite ( high current , high duty cycle and good energy resolution ) .    in a contribution to the workshop cebaf at 8 gev @xcite we stressed the benefits of the vcs approach .",
    "this paper will focus on the experimental challenges for vcs experiments above 8 gev .",
    "our interest in vcs is twofold :    * deeply virtual compton scattering ( dvcs ) corresponding to the diffraction of a virtual photon in the forward direction .",
    "dvcs@xcite @xcite @xcite allows us to access the off forward parton distribution ( ofpd ) directly linked to the non perturbative part of the nucleon .",
    "the kinematic domain of dvcs is deep inelastic electron scattering ( large @xmath2 and q@xmath3 ) with the final photon produced very nearly in the virtual photon direction . for incident energies of 6 to 12 gev ,",
    "the accessible domain is in the quark valence regime ( @xmath4 ) . *",
    "the large p@xmath5 domain .",
    "this is the domain where @xmath2 is large and the angle between the real and virtual photons is large ( neither near 0 nor near @xmath6 ) . @xmath1 is moderate or even quasi - real .",
    "this probes the quark wave function @xcite@xcite .",
    "[ q2s ] shows the kinematical domains relevant for dvcs and large @xmath7 .",
    "it also shows the limit on @xmath1 and @xmath2 given an accelerator energy .",
    "to the lowest order in @xmath8 the three graphs in the top panel of fig .",
    "[ diagrame ] contribute to the electro - production of a photon .",
    "graph ( a ) is the vcs and graphs ( b ) and ( c ) are the bethe - heitler ( bh ) graphs .",
    "the latter two are fully calculable if we know the form factors of the proton , and their amplitude is purely real .    3.5 cm",
    "-0.5 cm    due to the propagator of the virtual electrons and the the virtual photon , three different poles have to be considered in the bh graphs : @xmath9 these poles determine the shape of the bh cross section at high energy .",
    "since the sign of the electron propagators are opposite in the two bh graphs there is a strong destructive interference at the @xmath10 pole .",
    "-0.3 cm    in fig.[vcsamp ] , bh , dvcs , and large @xmath7 vcs cross sections are evaluated for a particular electron kinematics .",
    "the dvcs contribution is evaluated with a model given by p.a.m .",
    "guichon and m. vanderhaeghen @xcite .",
    "the ofpd are modeled as the product of the dis distribution functions and the elastic form factors .",
    "the cross section for the large @xmath7 domain is modeled with the virtual photon flux and a scaling ansatz for the photo - production cross section : @xmath11 we will use these two models to estimate counting rates .",
    "one of the main difficulties of vcs experiments is to be able to measure a cross - section over several ( 5@xmath128 ) orders of magnitude .",
    "the dominant contribution is the bh at the two electron poles . at the photon pole @xmath13 ( @xmath14 )",
    "the bh is also larger than vcs . far away from these poles",
    "bh becomes much smaller than the vcs , and the cross section is small ( @xmath12 1 pb gev@xmath15 sr@xmath16 ) .",
    "the dvcs cross - section by itself is very small and the bh makes up most of the total cross - section in the dvcs regime .",
    "fortunately , it is possible to extract the dvcs using asymmetries to access the interference term between the dvcs and the bh amplitude .",
    "this interference has an important contribution to the cross - section since the bh amplitude is large .",
    "this enhancement of the dvcs with the bh is the key to the measurement of the dvcs .",
    "there are two kinds of asymmetries that we can use :    * the lepton charge asymmetry , * the beam polarization asymmetry      this asymmetry is measured by the difference in the cross section for a negative or positive incident lepton ( electron to positron ) :    * the vcs amplitude ( diagram ( a ) , fig .  [ diagrame ] ) @xmath17 is anti - symmetrical under a charge conjugation , there is only one coupling on the lepton line .",
    "* the bh amplitude ( diagrams ( b and c ) , fig .  [ diagrame ] )",
    "@xmath18 is symmetrical , there are two couplings onto the lepton line .    therefore , the interference term between the bh and the vcs in the cross section is the only term contributing to an electron - positron asymmetry @xcite @xmath19\\ ] ] this asymmetry is a direct measure of the vcs amplitude since the bh amplitude is fully calculable .",
    "we use in the following the asymmetry : @xmath20 we give in fig .",
    "[ asymmetry ee ] the value of this asymmetry for three angles between the virtual photon and the real photon @xmath21 .",
    "it is plotted against the azimuthal angle @xmath22 between the leptonic and the hadronic plane .",
    "this figure is for an incident beam energy of 8 gev , s=8 gev@xmath3 and @xmath1= 3 gev@xmath3 . from the figure",
    "we see that the asymmetry is large for small angles of the real photon relative to the virtual photon direction .",
    "-0.5 cm    we think it is very interesting to use this characteristic and that is why we propose to build at cebaf and at elfe a positron beam .",
    "we will come back on this point later .",
    "another interesting observable is the beam helicity asymmetry @xmath23 produced with a polarized beam .",
    "this asymmetry is defined by the ratio between the difference and the sum of the cross - sections obtained when reversing the beam longitudinal polarization . here also , the interference between the bh amplitude and the vcs is the only term contributing ( assuming the longitudinal vcs amplitude is much smaller than the bh ) .",
    "this was pointed out in the case of large @xmath7 by p. kroll et al .",
    "@xcite@xcite and afterwards applied by m. diehl et al @xcite and pam guichon and m. vanderhaeghen @xcite in the case of the dvcs .",
    "cm    we give in fig .",
    "[ asymmetry phi ] the value of this asymmetry , for the same kinematics as in fig .",
    "[ asymmetry ee ] .",
    "the asymmetry deviates slightly from a pure @xmath24 behavior , due to the structure of the bh amplitude .",
    "this asymmetry is maximal out of plane ( @xmath25 ) and is zero when the photon angle @xmath21 is zero.unfortunately the cross section is maximum when @xmath21 is zero .",
    "the beam helicity asymmetry will require a larger integrated luminosity to achieve the same precision as the beam charge asymmetry .",
    "in order to select vcs events ( dvcs or large p@xmath5 ) one must make sure to select photon electro - production events . to do that we can use the squared missing mass . we need to know :    * the incident particle - that is why it is so crucial to have a good quality beam ; * the scattered electron - it fixes the virtual photon ; * the recoil proton and/or the photon produced . the choice to detect the recoil proton and/or the photon will be fixed by the kinematics and the level of resolution needed .    if the photon is not detected , it is necessary to separate the missing mass zero ( photon missing mass ) from the pion mass .",
    "the squared missing mass resolution must be @xmath26 if we measure the photon ( instead of the proton ) , the resolution we require on @xmath27 is much looser : @xmath28 there is a factor of twenty between the required resolution on the squared missing mass in the two cases .",
    "the best case will be when the photon is detected and measured ( momentum and direction ) and the proton detected ( position only ) . in this case",
    "we can use not only a missing mass technique , but also require coplanarity conditions on the virtual photon , the recoil proton and the photon .",
    "there are two main sources of background .",
    "the @xmath29 electroproduction : @xmath30 ( diagram d , figure [ diagrame ] ) , and the pion associated production with photon electroproduction : @xmath31 ( diagrams e , f and g figure [ diagrame ] ) .",
    "the graph of the @xmath29 electro - production is the d graph of the figure [ diagrame ] .",
    "when the @xmath29 decays with a photon emitted in the forward direction , the second photon from the @xmath29 is backward and has a very low energy ( few mev ) .",
    "the final products of this reaction are nearly the same as a vcs event except for a soft backward photon which is very difficult to detect at an electromagnetic machine .",
    "the missing mass technique is unable to solve the problem either .",
    "the @xmath29 events are partially removed by a coplanarity cut on triple @xmath32 coincident events .",
    "the solution for the remaining @xmath29 events is to record in the calorimeter events with the @xmath29 decay at 90 degrees in the centre of mass .",
    "the two photons are emitted in the forward direction with comparable energies and their opening angle is @xmath33 . using these events",
    "we can infer the @xmath29 cross section and subtract its contribution from the events with only one photon recorded .    in the figure [ inner - outer ] we give an example of a composite calorimeter .",
    "the inner part , with a small granularity to collect the vcs events , the outer part with a bigger granularity to collect the two photons events from the @xmath29 decay .    in the dvcs kinematics",
    "the @xmath29 production :    * decreases as @xmath34 , faster than the dvcs which decreases as @xmath35 .",
    "* has no interference with bh , contrary to the vcs which is amplified by the bh when the quadri - transfer @xmath36 is small .",
    "* has no beam charge - dependent asymmetry .",
    "thus this background vanishes identically in @xmath37 .",
    "we should point out that the @xmath29 cross section is in itself a very interesting result . in dvcs kinematics , it is sensitive to another combination of the off forward parton distribution @xcite .",
    "another parasitic reaction is the associated pion production at the photon electro - production .",
    "the corresponding graphs are fig .",
    "[ diagrame ] e , f and g. the last two graphs ( f and g ) are the associated pion production with the bh process ( abh ) .",
    "the a - bh process can be exactly predicted , given knowledge of the @xmath38 transition form factors ( instead of the proton form factors as in the vcs ) .",
    "the third graph ( avcs ) is the pion production in the vcs .",
    "it leads to the same final state as the e and f graphs and therefore the three graphs interfere .",
    "the physics of associated production in dvcs ( f ) is just as important as the physics of the dvcs process .",
    "for example , for pion - nucleon system at the mass of the @xmath39 ( or higher @xmath40 ) a - dvcs gives access to some of the @xmath41 transition ofpd s .",
    "however it is not so simple to extract the a - dvcs amplitude since , in this case a - bh is no longer purely real but has an imaginary part as well ( because of the intermediate on - shell @xmath40 state ) .",
    "close to the pion threshold ( @xmath42 system in s - wave ) a low energy theorem can be built to relate the @xmath43 ofpds to the elastic ofpds .    under the charge change of the lepton",
    ", the associated pion production has an asymmetry similar to the dvcs case .",
    "if the proton is not detected , the associated pion production can appear in either the @xmath44 or @xmath45 final states .",
    "if the recoil proton is detected , only the @xmath29 channel is open .",
    "we have pointed out the interest of the charge asymmetry .",
    "but to access this information we need a positron beam .",
    "several techniques can be used such as radioactive sources but the main technique is to produce positrons on a heavy material target .",
    "this yields positrons of about 60 mev , which are then collected and injected into the linac .",
    "this does not require any significant changes in the linac setup .",
    "[ positron ] ) .",
    "positrons can just be injected into the linac with a rf phase difference of 180@xmath46 relative to the electrons .",
    "the positron yield is proportional to the electron beam power on the conversion target .",
    "table  [ positron beam]@xcite lists the parameters of the positron source used at the slc , the parameters of the source for the next linear collider ( nlc ) . the cebaf extrapolation is obtained by scaling the to the cebaf beam power on the conversion target .",
    "we have given for cebaf two extrapolations ( a ) and ( b ) based the slc number and the nlc project .",
    "this latter give a larger positron yield due to an improved positron collection . we can conclude that a positron beam is realistic for cebaf .",
    "because the asymmetry is large we do not need rapid switching from electrons to positrons .",
    "we need to switch the beam ( reverse the polarity of the arc magnets ) approximately once every 100 hours .",
    "the following modifications needs to be done on the beam line to provide a positron beam :    * a new magnet at the end of the north linac , * a beam transport line in the north tunnel , * a room for the positron target , and the optics to collect the positrons , * a 80 kw beam dump for 0.5 gev beam    .positron production from the slc-94 and the next linac collider ii@xcite .",
    "the estimation for cebaf is obtained by scaling with the cebaf beam power ( a ) on slc , or ( b ) on the future project nlc - ii , which increases the parameter of the positron collection . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]    + table  [ anglemaxkine ] gives several examples of dvcs kinematic computed at the maximum angle in the lab between the proton and the virtual photon . at this angle",
    "the jacobian @xmath47 is maximal ( meaning our cm solid angle is maximal ) .",
    "+ from this table several conclusions can be extracted : 1 .",
    "the proton momentum is high . in this table",
    ", the lowest p@xmath48=.551 gev has a range of 20 g cm@xmath16 in iron .",
    "this implies that we can shield the proton detector from low energy particles without losing in efficiency on the proton detection .",
    "since most of the high noise counting rate is at low energy this also has the benefit to allow us to use high luminosities .",
    "the angle between the virtual photon and the real photon is small .",
    "thus , we can place the photon calorimeter in the direction of the virtual photon .",
    "this calorimeter can have a small angular acceptance and we will still be able to catch the real photon . the optimum position is a tradeoff between this angle and the electron spectrometer acceptance .",
    "the angle of the proton and the virtual photon is large ( 40 degrees for the smallest in the table ) .",
    "the virtual photon is close to the forward direction , ( 10 - 20 degrees ) the proton detector however will be farther thus , less sensitive to background allowing us to work at high luminosities . * the solution proposed for the photon calorimeter to solve the pile - up problem based on sampling at 1 gigahertz will nicely improve the detection of the proton also .",
    "-1.0 cm    finally , we can propose the experimental setup sketch presented in the figure [ setup ] .",
    "the proton detector is a ring of plastic scintillators located around the direction of the virtual photon .",

    "the associated events do not have the same distribution .",
    "the phase space ( 4 body ) of the associated production events is evenly spread on the acceptance whereas the dvcs events are concentrated at a ring on the edge of the phase space .",

    "[ asymetri_ei8],[asymetri_ei6q2],[asymetri_ei27q5 ] give for three kinematics the expected yield for measurements of the beam - charge and beam - helicity asymmetries .",
    "this simulation was done using the code `` bitch '' @xcite , which takes into account the resolution of the spectrometer , the multiple scattering in the target , and the dvcs cross section model of ref .",
    "it must be noted that in the two lowest energy settings ( 6 and 8 gev ) the electron spectrometer corresponds to the cebaf hrs spectrometer . at 16 and 27 gev",
    "the angular acceptance is much smaller .",
    "the calorimeter is a lead glass calorimeter with a preshower compensation .",
    "no attempt was made to optimize the size of this calorimeter for counting rate ( at 6 and 8 gev the counting rate can be increased by using a bigger calorimeter surface . ) these asymmetries contain the physics of the off forward parton distributions .",

    "in table  [ table : pt ] , we give the counting rate by day for several incident energies and kinematics . since the large @xmath7 domain can be reached by two symmetrical kinematics around the virtual photon it is possible to place the proton spectrometer in the same side ( relative to the electron beam ) ( positive angles ) the electron spectrometer .",
    "the photon calorimeter is then placed in the opposite hemisphere ( negative angle ) .",
    "we can chose a center of mass angle not too far from 90@xmath54 which maximize the @xmath7 .",
    "if we want to increase the solid angle , ( linked to the proton jacobian @xmath55 ) we can put the calorimeter in the backward direction .",
    "this will also decrease the electro magnetic background allowing us to work at higher luminosities .",
    "we have assumed a low angular acceptance of the electron spectrometer ( 2.5 msr ) compatible with the small angles .",
    "since the proton spectrometer is at larger angle we have taken the hrs cebaf spectrometers solid angle acceptance .",
    "the purpose of the photon calorimeter is only to add a third arm coincidence to reject accidentals .",
    "therefore , it does not need high energy resolution .",
    "it can be done with a sandwich of lead and plastic scintillators . a lead sheet placed in front to protect it from low energy x - ray and photons .",
    "we will then just set a threshold on this calorimeter response to get rid of the low energy noise .",
    "the photon calorimeter angular range is large , since it has to match the proton acceptance . @xmath56",
    ".    for the large @xmath7 reaction the associated bh amplitude is small , and will be not enhanced by abh .",
    "this means it will be smaller than in the dvcs case so it should not be a problem . on the other hand the pion electro production is becoming relevant in this kinematic .",
    "we will use missing mass cuts to select our events .",
    "the missing mass will be constructed with the scattered electron and the recoil proton .",
    "if this is not enough , then we can use the photon calorimeter granularity for coplanarity cuts .",
