    "since the existence of the thick disk of our galaxy was confirmed by gilmore & reid ( 1983 ) more than ten years ago , it has been generally accepted that a complete description of the thick disk , such as its scale length , scale height , density normalization , metallicity and kinematical properties , is a necessary step towards understanding the galaxy formation , halo collapse , disk dynamical and chemical evolution .",
    "unfortunately , the characteristics of this population remain controversial , especially for its density profile .",
    "several attempts have been made to deduce this parameter by remote star counts and field star survey ( buser & kaeser 1985 , gilmore , reid & hewett 1985 , reid & majewski 1993 , buser , rong & karaali 1998 ) .",
    "but the results are still quite uncertain .",
    "this is partly due to the lack of complete sample of thick disk stars since its members can not be easily recognized from that of the thin disk and/or the halo in most observable distributions .",
    "moreover , the determination of thick disk characteristics requires large star samples in various directions well distributed in both the longitude and latitude ( robin et al .",
    "1996 ) , which can not be obtained easily at the present time .",
    "recently , the study of chemical evolution of the galactic disk has been proven to be a powerful tool to explore the formation and evolution of our galaxy .",
    "numerous models have been detailedly put forward ( matteucci & francois 1989 , ferrini et al .",
    "1994 , giovagnoli & tosi 1995 , prantzos & aubert 1995 , timmes et al .",
    "1995 , carig 1996 , pilyugin & edmunds 1996a , chiappini , matteucci & gratton 1997 , allen et al .",
    "1998 , thon & meusinger 1998 , prantzos & silk 1998 ) . among them ,",
    "chiappini , matteucci & gratton ( 1997 hereafter cmg97 ) were the first to take into account the effect of thick disk .",
    "they assumed that there are two main accretion episodes .",
    "the first is responsible for the formation of the thick disk , and the second , delayed relative to the first , forms the thin disk .",
    "the predictions of their best - fitting model are in good agreement not only with the observed metallicity distribution , but with the observed number of very low metallicity stars ( rocha - pinto & maciel 1996 , hereafter rm96 ) .",
    "this enlightens us to do more detailed analyze of the disk evolution based on the new chemical constraints .    in the present paper , the two - component model for the galactic disk evolution ( such as cmg97 )",
    "is adopted , in which the local surface density of the thick disk at the present time is chose to be one of the free parameters . the infall rate is assumed to be in a gaussian form instead of an exponentially decreasing one . the quantitative comparison between model predictions and the observations , i.e. , the new g - dwarf metallicity distribution obtained by hou et al ( 1998 ) , is used for the @xmath0-test of the best - fitting model .",
    "the outlines are as follows . in section 2",
    ", we present brief description of observational constraints up to now , of which the most important is the g - dwarf metallicity distribution .",
    "section 3 is the model and its main ingredients . in section 4",
    ", we present best - fittings of four different models , which are closed - box , one - component , pre - thin and post - thin models respectively , to the observations .",
    "discussions of the models are also included in section 4 .",
    "our conclusions are shown in the last section .",
    "a successful model of the chemical evolution of the galactic disk should reproduce the main observational features of both the solar neighborhood and whole disk .",
    "our set of constraints includes : + ( 1 ) g - dwarf metallicity distribution in the solar neighbourhood ( hou et al 1998 ) ; + ( 2 ) radial abundance gradients at present time ; + ( 3 ) age - metallicity relation ( amr ) ; + ( 4 ) the correlation between [ o / fe ] and [ fe / h ] ; + ( 5 ) radial profiles for the gas surface density ; and + ( 6 ) the variations of star formation rate ( sfr ) across the disk .",
    "+ the first one is selected as the observational constraint to quantitatively estimate the best - fitting model in this paper , since g dwarfs cover the whole life of the galactic disk and its metallicity distribution can reflect the local chemical enrichment history .",
    "the others are used for the comparisons between the best - fit model predictions and observations .",
    "the metallicity distribution of g dwarfs in the solar neighborhood is one of the most important constraints on the chemical evolution of the galactic disk . since g dwarfs have lifetimes comparable to the estimated age of the galaxy , they represent a sample which has never been depleted by stellar evolution , accumulating since the first episodes of low - mass star formation .",
    "therefore , a complete sample of these stars in the solar neighborhood carries memory of the local star formation and chemical enrichment history .",
    "pagel & patchett ( 1975 ) derived a cumulative g - dwarf metallicity distribution , based on a volume - limited sample of @xmath1 g dwarfs within about 25 pc of the sun .",
    "pagel ( 1989 ) revised previous data of pagel & patchett ( 1975 ) by means of a new calibration between the ultraviolet excess @xmath2 ( u - b ) and [ fe / h ] .",
    "later , rana ( 1991 ) and sommer - larsen ( 1991 ) independently revised the distribution of pagel ( 1989 ) , taking into account the dynamical heating effect on the observed distribution .",
    "rm96 derived a g - dwarf metallicity distribution in the solar neighborhood , using @xmath3 photometry and up - to - date parallaxes . rm96",
    "introduced a chemical criterion , according to which all sters have [ fe / h ] @xmath4 -1.2 are considered to be halo members and excluded from the final sample .",
    "the distribution of rm96 comprises 287 g dwarfs within 25 pc from the sun and differs from the classic one by having a prominent single peak around [ fe / h ] = - 0.2 ( see rm96 for details ) .",
    "recently , hou et al ( 1998 ) collected a new , enlarged sample of g dwarfs within 25pc from the sun .",
    "the stars are selected from the third catalogue of nearby stars ( gliese & jahreiss 1991 ) .",
    "the @xmath3 data are taken from the catalogues of olsen ( 1993 ) and hauck & mermilliod ( 1990 ) .",
    "no chemical criterion was introduced in hou et al ( 1998 ) since observational evidences showed that , in the metallicity interval -1.5 @xmath4 [ fe / h ] @xmath4 -1.0 , the fraction of thick disk stars in the solar neighbourhood appears to be as high as 60@xmath5 ( nissen & schuster 1997 ) .",
    "this is one of the main differences between the distribution of hou et al ( 1998 ) and that of rm96 .",
    "the final sample contains 382 g dwarfs with photometric data . the adopted metallicity calibration and kinetic correction is the same as that of rm96 .",
    "following pagel ( 1989 ) and rm96 , hou et al ( 1998 ) have also corrected the distribution for observational errors and cosmic scatter .",
    ".the obtained g - dwarf metallicity distribution in the solar neighbourhood taken from hou et al ( 1998 ) [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     one important parameter predicted by the best - fit of our two - component model is the local surface density of thick disk at the present time . on the other hand , the density ratio of thick to thin disk",
    "are usually deduced from studies of star counts . in table 3 , we present the comparison between our model predictions and the data compiled from literatures . since the density normalization and scale - height of the thick disk are anti - correlated when fitted simultaneously ( reid & majeweski 1993 , majeweski 1993 , robin et al .",
    "1996 ) , the scale heights of the thick disk are also shown in 2th column .",
    "the previous results for the space density ratio of thick to thin disk ( the parameter @xmath6 ) are shown in 3th column .",
    "taking the scale - height of thick and thin disk as @xmath7 = 1000pc and @xmath8 = 300pc respectively as usual ( majewski 1993 ) , the local space density ratio of thick to thin disk at the present time predicted by our model can be obtained based on the following equation : @xmath9 where @xmath10=10.0@xmath11 and 15.0 @xmath11 for the best - fittings of the pre - thin and post - thin model , respectively .",
    "moreover , equation ( 13 ) can also be used for deducing the @xmath12 with published @xmath6 and @xmath7 in literatures .",
    "the results are shown in 4th column of table 3 with @xmath8=300pc and @xmath13=55.0@xmath11 , respectively .    from table 3",
    ", it can be seen that the previous density normalizations of thick disk span a wide range ( from 0.02 to 0.11 ) .",
    "this is partly due to the difficulty in distinguishing the kinematical , chemical and spatial characteristics of thick disk with halo and thin disk .",
    "moreover , comparing published star counts and color distribution in neighboring fields , star density discrepancies are sometimes larger than photometric random errors as established by authors ( ojha et al .",
    "1996 , robin et al .",
    "but the results of more recent surveys are in good agreement within the error range ( ojha et al .",
    "1996 , robin et al .",
    "1996 , buser et al 1998 ) .",
    "table 3 shows that the value of @xmath10 predicted by the post - thin model are consistent with most of the previous results from literatures , while @xmath10 predicted by the pre - thin model is larger than the previous data from studies of star counts . to illustrate this quantitatively ,",
    "figure 2 shows the @xmath0 as a function of the @xmath10 within reasonable range for both the pre - thin model ( long dashed curve ) and post - thin model ( full curve ) in which other free parameters are fixed as @xmath14=1.0gyr , @xmath15=1.0gyr and @xmath16=4.0gyr .",
    "it is shown that the value of @xmath0 is very sensitive to @xmath10 .",
    "this suggests that the thick disk has great influence on the galactic chemical evolution . in figure 2 , three short horizontal lines indicate the model confidential level of @xmath17 ( dotted line ) , 50@xmath5 ( long dashed line ) and 70@xmath5 ( full line ) , respectively .",
    "the points in figure 2 indicate the different results of @xmath0 if the value of @xmath10 from ten literatures ( table 3 ) are adopted for both the pre - thin model ( open squares ) and post - thin model ( open circles ) , respectively .",
    "figure 2 shows that , for the post - thin model , five points have model confidential level larger than 70@xmath5 , while only two points have confidential level larger than 70@xmath5 for the pre - thin model .",
    "this suggests that the post - thin model be better than pre - thin model .",
    "other evidences tended to favour the post - thin scenario for the formation of thick disk comes from the following facts .",
    "first , the thick disk is kinematically distinct from the thin disk and it shows no kinematic gradients ( ojha et al 1994 a , b ) .",
    "second , gilmore et al ( 1995 ) studied metallicity distribution of thick disk stars up to about @xmath18 from the galactic plane .",
    "they found that thick disk stars show no vertical abundance gradient .",
    "this argues against dissipational setting as the formation process of the thick disk ( freeman 1996 ) .",
    "based on the above discussions , we treat the post - thin model with @xmath19=1.0 gyr , @xmath15=1.0gyr , @xmath16=4.0 gyr and @xmath10= 10.0@xmath11 as the best - fit model .",
    "figure 3 presents the comparison between our best - fit model predictions for the amr and the observations .",
    "the full line is our model predictions and the points are observational data taken from edvardsson et al ( 1993 ) .",
    "figure 3 shows that , at the beginning of the formation of the thick disk ( @xmath20 ) , the iron abundance of ism decreases a little due to the increasing infall rate of the primordial gas .",
    "after that phase , the model predicts that the metallicity increases smoothly with time .",
    "the overall tendency for this relation is consistent with the mean observations , but the present model can not reproduce the large observed scatters .",
    "nordstrom et al .",
    "( 1997 ) discussed in detail the main hypotheses for the origin of this scatter , such as star formation in an inhomogeneous gaseous medium , orbital diffusion in homogeneous galaxy and mergers or accretion events .",
    "however , a physical mechanism that reproduces the observed scatter in the amr without violating other observational constraints has not yet been identified .",
    "figure 4 compares the predicted behaviors of [ o / fe ] vs. [ fe / h ] for the best - fit model ( full line ) with the observations .",
    "the observed data are taken from edvardsson et al ( 1993 ) ( asterisks ) and barbuy ( 1988 ) ( full squares ) .",
    "our model predicts that there is a small loop at [ fe / h]= -1.6 .",
    "the similar behavior is predicted in the best - fit model of cmg97 .",
    "figure 4 shows that our model prediction is in good agreement with the observations .",
    "this suggests that the relative stellar yield for oxygen and iron we adopted here be reasonable .",
    "contrary to the case of the solar neighbourhood , the available observations for the milky way disk offer information maily about its current status , not its past history .",
    "therefore , there is much more freedom in constructing a model . up to now",
    ", chemical evolution models of the galactic disk consider the disk as a system of independent rings .",
    "this oversimplification generally ignores the possibility of radial inflows produced in gaseous disks , e.g. by viscosity or by the infall of gas with a specific angular momentum different from that of the underlying disk ( prantzos & silk 1998 ) .",
    "fortunately , a radial variation of the infall time - scale may play a similar role . in our best - fit model , the infall timescale of the thin disk @xmath16",
    "is assumed to be radially dependent , taking an lower values in the inner disk ( @xmath16=2 gyr at @xmath21=2 kpc ) and larger ones in the outer disk ( @xmath16=4 gyr at @xmath21=8.5 kpc ) .    in figure 5 , we compare the predicted radial distribution of oxygen abundances by our best - fit model ( full line ) with the observations .",
    "the observed data of hii regions are from shaver et al ( 1983 ) ( asterisks ) , fich & silkey ( 1991 ) ( open circles ) and vilchez & esteban ( 1996 ) ( open squares ) .",
    "the observations of early b - type main - squence stars are taken from smartt et al ( 1997 ) ( full squares ) and gummersbach et al ( 1998 ) ( crosses ) .",
    "it shows that model predictions of oxygen abundances are larger than most of the observations .",
    "moreover , our model predicts that the abundance gradient in inner region ( -0.01 dex / kpc for @xmath22 8.5 kpc ) is steeper than that in outer region ( -0.07 dex / kpc for @xmath23 8.5 kpc ) .",
    "this seems to be contradictory to the observations of hii region , which suggests a flatter oxygen abundance gradients in outer region .",
    "this disagreement was also obtained by most of chemical evolution models for the galactic disk ( see brief reviews in tosi 1996 ) .",
    "this is probably due to the simplicities of the present models .",
    "samland et al .",
    "( 1997 ) developed a chemi - dynamical evolution model for the galactic disk and presented better fit for the observed variations of oxygen abundance across the whole disk .",
    "therefore , this disagreement probably could be solved if one considers the influence of dynamical evolution on the chemical evolution and the effect of gas heating on star formation rate .",
    "figure 6 presents the comparison between the predictions of our best - fit model for the radial profile of the present sfr ( full line ) and the observations .",
    "observed data are normalized to sfr in the solar neighborhood .",
    "data are based on several tracers of star formation : lyman continuum photons from hii regions ( full squares , from gusten & merger 1983 ) ; pulsars ( open circles : from lyne et al 1985 ) ; and supernova remnants ( crosses : from guibert et al 1978 ) .",
    "the good agreement between our model prediction and the observations indicates that our model predicts reasonable star formation history for the galactic disk .",
    "finally , in figure 7 , we present the comparison for the radial distribution of the present gas surface density between our best - fit model predictions ( full line ) and the observations ( dashed lines ) .",
    "two dashed lines are reproduced from prantzos & aubert ( 1995 ) .",
    "the lower dashed line is the sum of atomic and molecular hydrogen given in dame ( 1993 ) , corrected for the contribution of 30@xmath5 helium .",
    "the upper one is obtained by adopting the gas surface density in the solar neighbourhood as 16 @xmath24 and scaling the curve of dame ( 1993 ) accordingly ( prantzos & aubert 1995 ) .",
    "given the uncertainties in the observational data , the model is also in good agreement with the observed profile .",
    "in this work , we introduce a two - component models for the chemical evolution of the galactic disk , which assumes that the formation of the thick and thin disks occur in two main accretion episodes . the infall rate is assumed to be gaussian .",
    "both the pre - thin and post - thin scenarios for the formation of the galactic disk are considered .",
    "the local surface density of the thick disk at the present time is chosen to be one of the free parameters .",
    "following prantzos & silk ( 1998 ) , we also assume that the sfr is not only proportional to @xmath25 power of gas surface density , but directly correlates with the galactocentric distance . comparing model predictions with the new metallicity distribution in the solar neighbourhood ( hou et al 1998 )",
    ", we use the @xmath0-test to derive best - fittings and compare the reasonableness of four different models , which are closed - box , one - component , pre - thin and post - thin models .",
    "moreover , comparisons between the predictions of our best - fit model and the main observational constraints are presented .",
    "the main results can be summarized as follows .    1 .",
    "our results suggests that the post - thin model for the formation of the galactic disk should be preferred .",
    "this is consistent with the observational evidences that the thick disk is chemically and kinematically distinct from the thin disk and it shows no vertical abundance gradient .",
    "the goodness - of - fit for model predictions about metallicity distribution to the observations , @xmath0 , is very sensitive to the local surface density of the thick disk at the present time .",
    "this suggests that it is necessary to treat the thick and thin disks differently if one want to investigate detailedly the galactic chemical evolution .",
    "3 .   the post - thin model predicts @xmath10 = 10.0@xmath11 .",
    "the resulted space density ratio of thick to thin disk is consistent with the previous data from recent studies of star counts .",
    "however , the pre - thin model predicts a larger value of the local thick disk density .",
    "4 .   the predictions of our best - fit model are in good agreement not only with the observed data in the solar neighborhood , but also with the main observational features of the galactic disk .",
    "however , contrary to the observations in hii regions , our model predicts the oxygen abundance gradient in outer region is steeper than that in inner region .",
    "the authors wish to thank prof .",
