    "the deconfinement / chiral symmetry restoration phase transition in ultrarelativistic heavy ion collisions is inherently a multiparticle phenomenon .",
    "therefore , event - by - event analysis of multiparticle hadronic observables is of paramount interest .",
    "we carry out a texture , or local fluctuation , analysis to determine the correlation / fluctuation content of single events , and analyze the scale composition of the correlations .",
    "the idea to look at particle distributions in rapidity @xmath1 to search for critical behaviour was proposed @xcite based upon a ginzburg - landau type of multihadron production theory @xcite , where a random hadronic field @xmath2 plays the role of an order parameter in a hadronization transition . enhanced large scale correlations of hadrons in @xmath1 at",
    "the phase transition would signal critical fluctuations in the order parameter .",
    "stephanov and coworkers @xcite indicated a second order qcd phase transition point which should exist under certain initial conditions , within the reach of today s experiments .    in our work",
    ", a power spectrum analysis of event texture in pseudorapidity @xmath3 and azimuthal angle @xmath4 , based on a discrete wavelet transformation ( dwt)@xcite , is performed on a number of large event ensembles sampled according to their multiplicity , thereby studying the impact parameter dependence of the observables .",
    "dwt quantifies contributions of different @xmath4 and @xmath3 scales into the event s overall texture , thus testing the possible large scale enhancement .",

    "ionization energy loss of charged particles was measured in 512 silicon pads , with radial granularity of 16 and azimuthal granularity of 32 .",
    "the pads were read out by amplex @xcite chips , one chip per sector .",
    "@xmath5-electrons , produced by the @xmath6 beam traversing the target , were swept away to one side by a dipole magnetic field ( @xmath7 tl ) . only the @xmath5-electron - free side was used in the analysis .",
    "empty target runs were used to measure the background .",
    "cross - talk in the detector was evaluated off - line .",
    "track density in an individual event @xmath8 is represented by a 2d array of the calibrated digitized amplitudes of the channels ( an _ amplitude array _ ) .",
    "this is expanded into a basis of _ _ haar wavelet__@xcite functions @xmath9 , orthogonal with respect to scale fineness @xmath10 and location @xmath11 , with the @xmath12 index numbering three modes of texture direction sensitivity  @xmath4 , @xmath3 , and @xmath13  for azimuthal , pseudorapidity and diagonal .",

    "more experimental and algebraic details can be found in @xcite and the references therein .",
    "figure [ compare ] shows that the power spectra in central pb+pb collisions are indeed enhanced on the coarse scale .",
    "it is necessary to eliminate `` trivial '' and detector related contributions to this enhancement .",
    "event mixing is done by taking different channels from different events . in order to reproduce the electronics cross - talk effects in the mixed event sample",
    ", mixing is done sector - wise , i.e. the sectors constitute the subevents subjected to the event number scrambling .",
    "the mixed events preserve the texture associated with detector position offsets , the inherent @xmath20 shape , cross - talk and dead channels . this is _",
    "static _ texture as it reproduces its pattern event after event ; we are interested in _ dynamic _ texture .",
    "we reduce sources of static texture in the power spectra by empty target subtraction and by subtraction of the mixed events power spectra , thus obtaining the _ texture correlation _ @xmath21 .",
    "this quantity , normalized to the @xmath22 fluctuation of @xmath23 , is used to characterize the relative strength of local fluctuations in an event .",
    "its distribution for different @xmath12 is plotted on figure [ limit ] in an integral way , i.e. as an @xmath24 graph where for every @xmath15 , @xmath25 is the fraction of the distribution above @xmath15 .",
    "the _ confidence level _ with which local fluctuations of a strength @xmath15 can be excluded is then @xmath26 .",
    "fluctuations greater than @xmath27 are excluded in the azimuthal and pseudorapidity modes with 90% and 95% confidence , respectively .",
    "the monotonic fall of the curve is consistent with absence of abnormal subsamples in the data .",
    "figure [ multi_dep ] summarizes texture correlation data for different multiplicity events .",
    "the systematic errors were evaluated by removing the @xmath6 target and switching magnetic field polarity to expose the analyzed side of the detector to @xmath5-electrons , while minimizing nuclear interactions . correlations ( i.e. deviations of @xmath28 from @xmath23 ) in such events measure the remaining systematic uncertainties .",
    "thus , this component of the systematic error is signed , and the systematic errors are asymmetric",
    ". the other component ( significant only on the coarsest scale ) is the uncertainty of our knowledge of the beam s geometrical cross - section .",
    "a monte carlo simulation was performed , including known background texture effects and the subtraction of mixed simulated events . the finite beam size effect , irreducible by the subtraction methods ,",

    "the data are consistent with clustering of @xmath29 per fireball below 50 .",
