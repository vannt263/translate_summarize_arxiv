    "photonic crystals ( pc ) are a new kind of materials which facilitate the control of the light .",
    "pc exhibits photonic band gaps ( pbg ) that forbids the radiation propagation in a specific range of frequencies .",
    "@xcite in the past ten years has been developed an intensive effort to study and micro - fabricate pbg materials in one , two or three dimensions .",
    "@xcite    however , for many applications it is advantageous to obtain some degree of tuning of the pbg .",
    "@xcite this can be made by changing the refractive index of the constitutive materials by means of an external parameter , such the temperature or voltage .",
    "@xcite one of the most promising routes to achieve such tuning is the use of liquid crystals ( lc).@xcite recently it has been reported several works of pc infilled with lc with robust ranges of tuning in the optical regime .",
    "@xcite in most of the cases , the theoretical analysis is performed via the calculation of the band structure or light reflection ( transmission ) using plane wave expansion or transfer matrix methods ( tmm).@xcite in this work we illustrate the possibility of determining the degree of tuning in a simple manner by using the von - laue condition ( vlc ) .",
    "the vlc takes account of the variation of the constitutive parameters of the unitary cell introducing an effective refractive index that averages the value of the constitutive parameters .",
    "this formula is useful to determine in a easy way the tuning of the recently reported experimental configurations .",
    "@xcite the performance and limits of our approximation is compared with exact calculations obtained with the plane wave method ( pwm).@xcite     and @xmath0 , respectively .",
    "the width of each slab is @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "the width of the unit cell is @xmath3",
    "we start our analysis by considering the von - laue diffraction condition , @xcite    @xmath4    @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the wave vector and reciprocal lattice vector , respectively . if the vectors @xmath5 and @xmath6 are parallels , it can be written    @xmath7    where the absolute value of the reciprocal latttice vector ( @xmath8 ) is defined as    @xmath9    @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the lattice period and the diffraction order , respectively .",
    "the wave vector @xmath12 is defined as    @xmath13    where @xmath14 is the effective index of the composite medium .",
    "using eqs .",
    "( 3 ) , ( 4 ) and ( 2 ) the vlc is    @xmath15    where we have introduced the definiton of reduced frequency @xmath16 , with @xmath17 as the wavelength for the diffraction order @xmath11 .",
    "1 shows a unit cell composed of liquid crystals and dielectric , with refractive indices @xmath18 and @xmath0 , respectively .",
    "the width of each layer is @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "the width of the unit cell is @xmath19 .",
    "we define the filling fraction as the space filled by the dielectric material over the total space in the unit cell , @xmath20 . the effective index @xmath14 is taken as a simple average in the unit cell in the form    @xmath21    the tuning of the diffraction condition can be written as    @xmath22},\\ ] ]",
    "to verify our analytical formula , we have performed a detailed calculation of a particular pc .",
    "we have chosen the experimental parameters recently reported by tolmachev _",
    "we consider the pc as a stack of alternating slabs of dielectric and lc with refractive index @xmath23 and @xmath24 , respectively .",
    "the filling fraction is @xmath25 . in fig .",
    "1 we show the photonic band structure ( pbs ) calculated with the pwm .",
    "@xcite we observe the existence of four band gaps .",
    "we have plot the pbs in the usual way with wave vector ( @xmath26 ) and reduced frequency ( @xmath27 ) in the abscissa and ordinate , respectively .",
    "additionally , in the right side of the ordinate axis , we have plot a wavelength scale .",
    "this has be done because most of the experimental results are usually presented in this form in lc experiments . in this case",
    ", we have illustrated the wavelength scale for a period of @xmath28 @xcite .",
    "we consider a change in @xmath18 as the result of the variation from the homeotropic ( @xmath24 ) to the pseudoisotropic ( @xmath29 ) @xcite state under the influence of an external voltage . in fig .",
    "3 we present the shift of the pbg as the variation of @xmath30 in panels ( a ) - ( d ) we present the evolution of the first four pbg , which are illustrated in the gray zones . inside each gray zone , we have plotted the evolution of the vlc eq .",
    "we observe that for the first pbg in panel ( a ) , the vlc lies in the middle . for the rest of the cases ,",
    "the vlc does not defines the center of the pbg .",
    "however , the interesting fact is that the shift of the pbg s are predicted . in order to define the stop band shift ,",
    "we introduce the formula    @xmath31    where @xmath32 and @xmath33 are the diffraction for the order @xmath11 . in table 1",
    "we present the numerical values obtained with the eqs .",
    "( 7 ) and ( 8) .    0.2 in    .numerical values of the vlc for the first four diffraction orders .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tab1 ]    we observe that the greatest shift is given for the diffraction order @xmath34 . for the following diffraction orders , the shift decreases .",
    "it is important to note that for the diffraction order @xmath35 , we obtain the experimental value obtained in ref .",
    "in conclusion , we have numerically demonstrated the advantage to use the vlc to predict the tuning of the stop band in pc structures . previously theorethical reports on tuning were based on calculationd on pwe or tmm .",
    "we have shown that our formulation agree well with experimental data reported in ref .",
    "( 9 ) we consider that our formula can be useful to determine in an easy way the tuning of the stop band in tunable pc .",
