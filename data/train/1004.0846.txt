    "the density can be analyzed with the help of hermite polynomials . due to this connection with classical orthogonal polynomials",
    "many explicit calculations can be done , both for finite @xmath5 and in the limit @xmath6 , see @xcite . in particular",

    "the local scale is characterized by the sine kernel @xmath11 in the bulk .",

    "this result leads in particular to the statement about the largest eigenvalue @xmath22\\ ] ] where @xmath23 is the airy kernel and the determinant is the fredholm determinant of the integral operator with airy kernel acting on @xmath24 .",
    "the limiting distribution is the famous tracy - widom distribution named after the authors of the seminal work @xcite in which the right - hand side of is expressed in terms of the hastings - mcleod solution of the painlev ii equation .",
    "these basic results of random matrix theory have been extended and generalized in numerous directions . within the theory of random matrices ,",
    "they have been generalized to ensembles with unitary , orthogonal and symplectic symmetry and to non - invariant ensembles ( wigner ensembles ) .",
    "the distribution functions of random matrix theory also appear in many other probabilistic models that have no apparent connection with random matrices ( models of non - intersecting paths , tiling models , and stochastic growth models ) , see e.g. @xcite , @xcite .",
    "mehta s book @xcite is the standard reference on random matrix theory .",
    "the book of deift @xcite has been very influential in introducing riemann - hilbert techniques into the study of random matrices . in recent years",
    ", a number of new monographs appeared @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite that cover the various aspects of the theory of random matrices .",
    "one direction within random matrix theory is the study of ensembles of the form @xmath25 defined on @xmath2 hermitian matrices @xmath26 , which reduces to the gue in case @xmath27 .",

    "local eigenvalue statistics , however , have a universal behavior as @xmath6 , that is described by the sine kernel in the bulk .",
    "thus for points @xmath39 with @xmath40 the limit holds true . at edge points of the limiting spectrum the density @xmath35 typically vanishes as a square root and then the universal airy kernel appears . for real analytic potentials",
    "@xmath41 this was proved in @xcite , @xcite using riemann - hilbert methods .",
    "this was vastly extended to non - analytic potentials in recent works of lubinsky @xcite and levin and lubinsky @xcite , among many others .      in this paper",
    "we present an overview of the work ( mainly of the author and co - workers ) on multiple orthogonal polynomials and their relation to random matrix theory .",
    "multiple orthogonal polynomials are a generalization of orthogonal polynomials that have their origins in approximation theory ( hermite - pad approximation ) , see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "they enter the theory of random matrices via a generalization of which we call a multiple orthogonal polynomial ( mop ) ensemble @xcite .",
    "we present a number of models that give rise to a mop ensemble , namely the model of non - intersecting brownian motions , the random matrix model with external source and the two matrix model .",
    "the mops are described by a riemann - hilbert problem that may be used for asymptotic analysis as @xmath6 by extending the deift - zhou method of steepest descent @xcite .",
    "the extensions are non - trivial and involve either an a priori knowledge of an underlying riemann surface ( the spectral curve ) or the formulation of a relevant equilibrium problem from logarithmic potential theory @xcite , which asks for a generalization of the weighted energy functional .",
    "the latter approach has been succesfully applied to the random matrix model with external source and to the two matrix model , but only in very special cases , as will be discussed at the end of the paper .",
    "we will describe here multiple orthogonal polynomials of type ii , which we simply call multiple orthogonal polynomials .",
    "there is also a dual notion of type i multiple orthogonal polynomials .",
    "suppose we have a finite number of weight functions @xmath42 on @xmath38 and a multi - index @xmath43 .",
    "associated with these data is the monic polynomial @xmath44 of degree @xmath45 so that @xmath46 the linear system of equations may not be always uniquely solvable , but in many important cases it is . if @xmath44 uniquely exists then it is called the multiple orthogonal polynomial ( mop ) associated with the weights @xmath42 and multi - index @xmath47 .",
    "existence and uniqueness does hold in the following situation .",

    "on @xmath49 of the form a mop ensemble , see @xcite .",
    "the mop ensemble is a determinantal point process @xcite ( more precisely a biorthogonal ensemble @xcite ) with a correlation kernel @xmath55 that is constructed out of multiple orthogonal polynomials of type ii and type i. it is conveniently described in terms of the solution of a riemann - hilbert ( rh ) problem .",
    "this rh problem for mops @xcite is a generalization of the rh problem for orthogonal polynomials due to fokas , its , and kitaev @xcite .",
    "the rh problem asks for an @xmath0 matrix valued function @xmath56",

    "the formula is essentially the christoffel - darboux formula for multiple orthogonal polynomials .",
    "besides giving a concise formula for the correlation kernel , the expression for the kernel gives also a possible way to do asymptotic analysis in view of the deift - zhou method of steepest descent for rh problems .",
    "a rich source of examples of determinantal point processes is provided by non - intersecting path ensembles . in special cases these reduce to mop ensembles .      consider a one - dimensional strong markov process with transition probability densities @xmath68 for @xmath69 .",
    "suppose @xmath5 independent copies are given with respective starting values @xmath70 at time @xmath71 and prescribed ending values @xmath72 at time @xmath73 that are conditioned not to intersect in the full time interval @xmath74 .",

    "figure1.eps    the density function is a biorthogonal ensemble , which in very special cases reduces to the form of a mop ensemble .",

    "turns into @xmath80 with a different constant @xmath4 .",
    "this is up to trivial scaling the same as the p.d.f .   for the eigenvalues of an @xmath2 gue matrix .    if however , we let all @xmath79 and choose only @xmath1 different starting values , denoted by @xmath81 , and @xmath82 paths start at @xmath83 , then turns into a mop ensemble with weights @xmath84 and multi - index @xmath85 .",
    "this is a multiple hermite ensemble , since the associated mops are multiple hermite polynomials @xcite    figure2.eps      the squared bessel process is another one - dimensional markov process which gives rise to a mop ensemble .",
    "the squared bessel process is a markov process on @xmath86 , depending on a parameter @xmath87 , with transition probability density @xmath88 where @xmath89 is the modified bessel function of first kind of order @xmath90 . in the limit",
    "where all @xmath91 and @xmath92 the p.d.f .",

    "@xmath97 this further reduces to an orthogonal polynomial ensemble for a laguerre weight .",
    "the random matrix model with external source , and the two matrix model also give rise to mop ensembles .      the hermitian matrix model with external source",
    "is the probability measure @xmath98 on @xmath2 hermitian matrices , where the external source @xmath99 is a given hermitian @xmath2 matrix .",

    "see @xcite    for the case @xmath104 the external source model is equivalent to the model of non - intersecting brownian motions with several starting points and one ending point , cf .  .",
    "the hermitian two matrix model @xmath105 is a probability measure defined on couples @xmath106 of @xmath2 hermitian matrices . here",
    "@xmath41 and @xmath107 are two potentials ( typically polynomials ) and @xmath108 is a coupling constant .",
    "the model is of great interest in @xmath109d quantum gravity @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , as it allows for a large class of critical phenomena .",
    "the eigenvalues of the matrices @xmath110 and @xmath111 are fully described by biorthogonal polynomials .",
    "these are two sequences @xmath112 and @xmath113 of monic polynomials , @xmath114 , @xmath115 , such that @xmath116 see e.g.  @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "if @xmath107 is a polynomial then the biorthogonality conditions can be seen as multiple orthogonal polynomial conditions with respect to @xmath117 weights @xmath118 see @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the eigenvalues of @xmath110 are a mop ensemble with the weights and multi - index @xmath119 with @xmath120 for @xmath121 and @xmath122 for @xmath123 if @xmath124 with @xmath125 and @xmath126 non - negative integers , see @xcite for the case where @xmath127 .",
    "we discuss the large @xmath5 behavior in the above described models .      in order to have interesting limit behavior as @xmath6 in the non - intersecting brownian motion model we scale",
    "the time variables @xmath128 , @xmath129 , so that @xmath130 . in the case of one starting value and one ending value , see figure [ figure1 ] , the paths will fill out an ellipse as @xmath6 .",
    "in the situation of figure [ figure2 ] the paths fill out a heart - shaped region as @xmath6 , as shown in figure [ figure3 ] .",
    "new critical behavior appears at the cusp point where the two groups of paths come together and merge into one .",
    "around the critical time the correlation kernels have a double scaling limit , which is given by the one - parameter family of pearcey kernels @xmath131 where @xmath125 and @xmath132 are solutions of the pearcey equations @xmath133 and @xmath134 .",
    "this kernel was first identified by brzin and hikami @xcite who also gave the double integral representation @xmath135 where the contour @xmath136 consists of the rays from @xmath137 to @xmath138 and the rays from @xmath138 to @xmath139 .",
    "as already noted above , the model of non - intersecting brownian motion with two starting points and one ending point is related to the gaussian random matrix model with external source @xmath140 with external source @xmath141 in this setting the critical @xmath142-value is @xmath143 and the pearcey kernel arises as @xmath6 with @xmath144 . in @xcite",
    "this was studied with the use of the riemann - hilbert problem for multiple hermite polynomials with two weights @xmath145 . the asymptotic analysis as @xmath6",
    "was done with an extension of the deift - zhou method of steepest descent @xcite to the case of a @xmath146 matrix valued rh problem .",
    "see also @xcite and @xcite for a steepest descent analysis of the rh problem in the non - critical regimes @xmath147 and @xmath148 , respectively .",
    "another interesting asymptotic regime is the model of non - intersecting brownian motion with outliers . in this model",
    "a rational modification of the airy kernel appears that was first described in @xcite in the context of complex sample covariance matrices , see also @xcite .",
    "if @xmath41 is quadratic in the random matrix model with external source then this model can be mapped to the model of non - intersecting brownian motions .",
    "progress on this model beyond the quadratic case is due to mclaughlin @xcite who found the spectral curve for the quartic potential @xmath149 and for @xmath142 sufficiently large ( again @xmath99 is as in ) .",
    "a method based on a vector equilibrium problem was introduced recently by bleher , delvaux and kuijlaars @xcite .",
    "the vector equilibrium problem extends the equilibrium problem for the weighted energy that is important for the unitary ensembles and which is crucial in the steepest descent analysis of the rh problem for orthogonal polynomials @xcite .",
    "in @xcite it is assumed that @xmath41 is an even polynomial , and that @xmath99 is again given as in .",
    "the vector equilibrium problem involves two measures @xmath150 and @xmath151 , and it asks to minimize the energy functional @xmath152 where @xmath150 is on @xmath38 with @xmath153 , @xmath151 is on @xmath154 ( the imaginary axis ) with @xmath155 , and in addition @xmath156 , where @xmath157 is the measure on @xmath154 with constant density @xmath158    there is a unique minimizer , and the density @xmath159 of the measure @xmath150 is the limiting mean eigenvalue density @xmath160 where @xmath55 is the correlation kernel of the mop ensemble with weights @xmath161 .",
    "the rh problem is analyzed in the large @xmath5 limit with the deift / zhou steepest descent method in which the minimizers from the vector equilibrium problem play a crucial role .",
    "the upper constraint @xmath156 is not active for large enough @xmath142 and in that case the support of @xmath150 has a gap around @xmath138 . for smaller values of @xmath142",
    "the constraint @xmath157 is active along an interval @xmath162 $ ] , @xmath163 , on the imaginary axis .",
    "critical phenomena take place when either the constraint becomes active , or the gap around @xmath138 closes , or both .",
    "if one of these two phenomena happens , then this generically will be a phase transition of the painlev ii type that was described in the unitary matrix model in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "if the two phenomena happen simultaneously then this is expected to be phase transition of the pearcey type which , if true , would be a confirmation of the universality of the pearcey kernels at the closing of a gap @xcite .",
    "both kinds of transitions are valid in the external source model with even quartic potential @xmath164 , see @xcite .",
    "for the particular value @xmath165 , there is a passage from the painlev ii transition ( for @xmath166 ) to the pearcey transition ( for @xmath167 ) .",
    "the description of the phase transition for @xmath165 remains open .",
    "in @xcite duits and kuijlaars applied the steepest descent analysis to the rh problem for the two matrix model with quartic potential @xmath168 and for @xmath41 an even polynomial .",
    "the corresponding mop ensemble has three weights of the form and the rh problem is of size @xmath169 .",
    "again a vector equilibrium problem plays a crucial role .",
    "the vector equilibrium problem in @xcite involves three measures @xmath150 , @xmath151 and @xmath170 .",
    "it asks to minimize the energy functional @xmath171 among measures @xmath150 on @xmath38 with @xmath153 , @xmath151 on @xmath154 with @xmath172 and @xmath170 on @xmath38 with @xmath173 .",
