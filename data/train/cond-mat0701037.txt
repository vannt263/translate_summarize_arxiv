    "over the past two decades , _ nonextensive statistical mechanics _ has successfully addressed a wide spectrum of nonequilibrium phenomena in non - ergodic and other complex systems @xcite .",
    "recently , it has also entered the field of networks @xcite .",
    "nonextensive statistical mechanics is a generalization of boltzmann - gibbs ( bg ) statistical mechanics .",
    "it is based on the entropy @xmath1^q}{q-1 } \\;\\;\\;\\;\\ ; % \\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\ ; \\bigl [ % \\quad   \\bigl ( % \\rm{with } \\ ; % \\quad   s_1=s_{bg } \\equiv -\\int dx \\ , p(x ) \\ln p(x )   \\bigr ) \\,.\\ ] ] the extremization of the entropy @xmath2 under appropriate constraints @xcite yields the stationary - state distribution .",
    "this is of the @xmath0-exponential form , where the @xmath0-exponential function is defined as @xmath3^{1/(1-q ) } \\quad , \\label{qexp}\\ ] ] for @xmath4 , and zero otherwise ( with @xmath5 ) .",
    "the tail exponent @xmath6 characterizes the asymptotic power - law distribution .    since the very beginning of the tremendous recent modeling efforts of complex networks it has been noticed that degree distributions asymptotically follow power - laws @xcite , or even exactly @xmath0-exponentials @xcite .",
    "the model in @xcite describes growing networks with a so - called preferential attachment rule , meaning that any new node @xmath7 being added to the system links itself to an already existing node @xmath8 in the network with a probability that is proportional to the degree @xmath9 of node @xmath8 . in @xcite",
    "this model was extended to also allow for preferential rewiring .",
    "the analytical solution to the model has a @xmath0-exponential as a result , with the nonextensivity parameter @xmath0 being fixed uniquely by the model parameters . recently in @xcite preferential attachment networks",
    "have been embedded in euclidean space , where the attachment probability for a newly added node is not only proportional to the degrees of existing nodes , but also depends on the euclidean distance between nodes .",
    "the model is realized by setting the linking probability of a new node to an existing node @xmath7 to be @xmath10 @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the distance between the new node and node @xmath7 ; @xmath13 corresponds to the model in @xcite which has no metrics .",
    "the analysis of the degree distributions of the resulting networks has exhibited @xcite @xmath0-exponentials with a clear @xmath14-dependence of the nonextensivity parameter @xmath0 . in the large @xmath14 limit , @xmath0",
    "approaches unity , i.e. , random networks are recovered in the boltzmann - gibbs limit . in an effort to understand the evolution of socio - economic networks , a model was proposed in @xcite that builds upon @xcite but introduces a rewiring scheme which depends on the _ internal _ network distance between two nodes , i.e. , the number of steps needed to connect the two nodes .",
    "the emerging degree distributions have been subjected to a statistical analysis where the ( null ) hypothesis of @xmath0-exponentials could not be rejected .",
    "it has been found that networks exhibiting degree distributions compatible with @xmath0-exponentials are not at all limited to growing and preferentially organizing networks .",
    "a model for nongrowing networks which was recently put forward in @xcite also unambiguously exhibits @xmath0-exponential degree distributions .",
    "this model was motivated by interpreting networks as a certain type of gas where upon an ( inelastic ) collision of two nodes , links get transfered in analogy to the energy - momentum transfer in real gases . in this model",
    "a fixed number of nodes in an ( undirected ) network can merge , i.e. , two nodes fuse into one single node , which keeps the union of links of the two original nodes ; the link connecting the two nodes before the merger is removed . at the same time",
    "a new node is introduced to the system and is linked randomly to any of the existing nodes in the network @xcite . due to the nature of this model the number of links is not strictly conserved  which can be thought of as jumps between discrete states in some phase space. the model has been further generalized to exhibit a distance dependence as in @xcite , however @xmath12 not being euclidean but internal distance .",
    "again , the resulting degree distributions have @xmath0-exponential form .",
    "a quite different approach was taken in @xcite where an ensemble interpretation of random networks has been adopted , motivated by superstatistics @xcite .",
    "here it was assumed that the average connectivity @xmath15 in random networks is fluctuating according to a distribution @xmath16 , which is sometimes associated with a hidden - variable distribution . in this sense",
    "a network with any degree distribution can be seen as a superposition of random networks with the degree distribution given by @xmath17 .",
    "it was shown in @xcite , as an exact example , that an asymptotically power - law functional form of @xmath18 leads to degree distributions of zipf - mandelbrot form , @xmath19 , which is equivalent to a @xmath0-exponential @xmath20 with @xmath21 and @xmath22 . very recently",
    "a possible connection between _ small - world _ networks and the maximum @xmath2-entropy principle , as well as to the hidden variable method @xcite , has been noticed in @xcite .    in yet another view , networks have recently been treated as statistical systems on a hamiltonian basis @xcite . it has been shown that these systems show a phase transition like behavior @xcite , along which networks structure changes . in the low temperature phase one finds networks of star type , meaning that a few nodes are extremely well connected resulting even in a discontinuous @xmath23 ; in the high temperature phase one finds random networks .",
    "surprisingly , for a special type of hamiltonians networks with @xmath0-exponential degree distributions emerge right in the vicinity of the transition point @xcite .",
    "given the above characteristics of networks and the fact that a vast number of real - world and model networks show asymptotic power - law degree distributions , it seems almost obvious to look for a deeper connection between networks and nonextensive statistical physics .",
    "the purpose of this work is to show that various model types can be unified into a single dynamic network - formation model , characterized by a reasonably small number of parameters . within this parameter space ,",
    "all networks seem to be compatible with @xmath0-exponential degree distributions .",
    "the following model is a unification and generalization of the models presented in @xcite .",
    "the model in @xcite captures preferential growing aspects of networks embedded into a _",
    "metric space _ , while @xcite introduces a static , selforganizing model with a sensitivity to an _ internal metric _",
    "( chemical distance , diekstra distance ) .",
    "the rewiring scheme there can be thought of having preferential attachment aspects in one of its limits @xcite ( see below ) , but has none in the other limit .",
    "the network evolves in time as described in @xcite : at @xmath24 , the first node ( @xmath25 ) is placed at some arbitrary position in a metric space .",
    "the next node is placed isotropically on a sphere ( in that space ) of radius @xmath26 , which is drawn from a distribution @xmath27 ( @xmath28 , @xmath29 stands for _ growth_. to avoid problems with the singularity , we impose a cutoff at @xmath30 .",
    "the second node is linked to the first .",
    "the third node is placed again isotropically on a sphere with random radius @xmath31 , however the center of the sphere is now the barycenter of all the pre - existing nodes . from the third added node on , there is an ambiguity where the newly positioned node should link to .",
    "we choose a generalized preferential attachment process , meaning that the probability that the newly created node @xmath7 attaches to a previously existing node @xmath8 is proportional to the degree @xmath9 of the existing node @xmath8 , and on the metric ( euclidean ) distance between @xmath7 and @xmath8 , denoted by @xmath32 .",
    "in particular the linking probability is @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the number of nodes at time @xmath35 .",
    "it is not necessary that at each time step only one node is entering the system , so we immediately generalize that a number of @xmath36 nodes are produced and linked to the existing network with @xmath37 links per time step .",
    "note that @xmath36 and @xmath37 can also be random numbers from an arbitrary distribution . for simplicity and clarity",
    "we fix @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "after every @xmath40 timesteps , a different action takes place on the network . at this timestep",
    "the network does not grow but a pair of nodes , say @xmath7 and @xmath8 , merge to form one single node @xcite .",
    "this node keeps the name of one of the original nodes , say for example @xmath7 .",
    "this node now gains all the links of the other node @xmath8 , resulting in a change of degree for node @xmath7 according to @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the number of nodes , which shared links to both of @xmath7 and @xmath8 before the merger . in the case that @xmath7 and",
    "@xmath8 were first neighbors before the merger , i.e. , they had been previously linked , the removal of this link will be taken care of by the term @xmath43 in eq .",
    "( [ update ] ) .",
    "the probability that two nodes @xmath7 and @xmath8 merge can be made distance dependent , as before . in particular to stay close to the model in @xcite , we chose the following procedure .",
    "we randomly choose node @xmath7 with probability @xmath44 and then choose the merging partner @xmath8 with probability @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the shortest distance ( path ) on the network connecting nodes @xmath7 and @xmath8 ; obviously , tuning @xmath47 from @xmath48 toward large values , switches the model from the case where @xmath8 is picked fully at random ( @xmath44 ) , to a case where only nearest neighbors of @xmath7 will have a nonnegligible chance to get chosen for the merger .",
    "note that the number of nodes is reduced by one at that point .",
    "to keep the number of nodes constant at this timestep , a new node is introduced and linked with @xmath37 of the existing nodes with probability given in eq .",
    "( [ pa ] ) .",
    "this concludes the model . summing up , the relevant model parameters , we have the merging exponent @xmath47 , the attachment exponent @xmath49 , controlling the sensitivity of distance in the network , and the relative rate of merging and growing , @xmath40 .",
    "the parameters , @xmath50 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 , and @xmath51 have been found to play no major role in the model .    [",
    "cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     in fig .",
    "[ cglob ] we compare the global clustering coefficients from our model , with those obtained from a random graph with the same dimensions ( same number of nodes and links ) . for the erds - renyi random graph the clustering coefficient is @xmath52 .",
    "the comparison makes clear that there is almost no attachment effects for @xmath53 ( i.e. , negligible dependence from @xmath49 ) , and a strong dependence on @xmath47 and @xmath40 , as expected .",
    "we have introduced a general network formation model which is able to recover , as particular instances , a large class of known network types .",
    "we checked that , to a very good approximation , the resulting degree distributions exhibit @xmath0-exponential forms , with @xmath54 . while a full theory of how complex networks are connected to @xmath55 statistical mechanics is still missing , we provide further evidence that such a relation does indeed exist . for example , if we associate a finite fixed energy or  cost \" to every bond , and associate with each node half of the energy corresponding to its bonds ( the other half corresponding to the other nodes linked by those same bonds ) , then the degree distribution can be seen as an energy distribution of the type emerging within nonextensive statistical mechanics .",
    "it might well be that the full understanding of this relation arises from the discrete nature of networks .",
    "the importance of appropriate values of @xmath55 for systems living in topologies with a vanishing lebesgue measure has been pointed out before @xcite .",
    "this possibly makes phase space for certain nonextensive systems look like a network itself . in this view",
    "the basis of nonextensive systems could be related to a network - like structure of their phase space , explaining the ubiquity of @xmath0-exponential distribution functions in the world of networks .",
    "let us end by pointing out that , in variance with frequent such statements in the literature , the present model neatly illustrates that never ending growth is _ not _ necessary for having networks that are ( asymptotically ) scale - free .",
    "indeed , @xmath0-exponential degree distributions do emerge for large enough networks which do _ not _ necessarily keep growing .",
