    "in the local universe , galaxies separate into two broad classes @xcite : ( 1 ) large disk - dominated galaxies show ongoing star formation rates ( sfrs ) comparable to their past averages as evidenced by their overall blue colors , and frequent spiral arms , and ( 2 ) spheroidal , or bulge - dominated galaxies with current sfrs much less than their past averages .",
    "however , especially in the more distant universe , there exists a third class of galaxies which exhibits a large amount of stellar population diversity and irregular morphologies ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the mechanism by which a galaxy transitions from a uniformly blue , star forming galaxy ( with either disk - dominated or irregular morphologies ) into a bulge - dominated , quiescent galaxy remains an open question .",
    "many studies have added to a growing body of evidence that the irregular morphologies are due , at least in part , to heterogeneous ( clumpy ) star formation ( e.g. , @xcite )",
    ". believed to be formed through gravitational instabilities in gas - rich disks ( e.g. , @xcite ) , these clumps typically contribute @xmath6 of the total galaxy light @xcite and most have bluer colors and elevated specific star formation rates ( ssfr ) compared to the surrounding regions @xcite .",
    "this contrast between a young star forming region and the older underlying galaxy population may lead to a large amount of variation in the internal colors of a galaxy .",
    "the ability to investigate the separation ( heterogeneity ) of the different stellar populations ( blue star forming clumps versus the older , redder stellar disk ) becomes increasingly difficult at high redshift , because a galaxy s morphology often depends heavily on the bandpass in which the galaxy is observed . for example , observed optical light ( rest - frame uv ) traces the distribution of unobscured star - forming regions @xcite which are often non - uniformly distributed .",
    "recent observations of clumpy galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite ) find that clumps located toward galaxy centers are older and redder than clumps located toward the outskirts .",
    "this suggests that highly star forming clumps may migrate toward the center where they could condense to form a psuedo - bulge ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the formation of such a bulge , in turn , could be sufficient to stabilize the stellar disk against new star - formation @xcite , homogenizing the stellar populations and reducing the variations in internal color .",
    "if this scenario is correct , we would expect to observe a relation between the internal color dispersion of a galaxy and the formation of a bulge .    to investigate any potential relation , we require a tool to quantify the stellar population diversity of a galaxy .",
    "traditional morphological classification methods : visual inspection , srsic profile fitting , concentration and asymmetry values @xcite , and gini coefficients @xcite are calculated in a single bandpass and , as such , do not provide enough insight into the stellar population variations .",
    "@xcite developed a differential morphological measure , the internal color dispersion ( icd ) , which quantifies the heterogeneity of stellar populations ( such as with clumps ) between bandpasses ; galaxies with non - uniform distributions of young stellar populations give rise to a larger icd than a galaxy with a homogeneous or evenly mixed stellar population .",
    "similarly , galaxies with variable amounts of extinction will also exhibit large icd values , due to the spatial variations in the reddening .",
    "combining the icd with other morphological indicators that quantify the distribution of light in a galaxy ( e.g.  srsic , gini-@xmath7 , concentration and asymmetry ) provides insight into galaxies physical properties such as clumpy star - formation and their evolution in both overall color and structure .    in this paper",
    ", we build upon previous studies ( e.g. , @xcite ) and we use the icd as the primary metric in a comparative study of the rest - frame uv and optical morphological properties of the largest sample yet ( @xmath8 ) of @xmath0 galaxies to date .",
    "in addition to broader ir coverage , we combine optical and near - ir data from _ hst _  from the southern region of the great observatories origins deep survey and cosmic assembly near - infrared deep extragalactic survey , which also includes the deeper data in the hubble ultra deep field .",
    "we investigate the presence of heterogeneous stellar populations in a sample of @xmath0 galaxies and interpret our results in the context of galaxy evolution where a galaxy transitions from a disk - dominated to a more bulge - dominated morphology while experiencing a suppression of the diversity in its stellar populations .    in section  [ sec : data ]",
    "we discuss the data and sample selection .",
    "we discuss the icd measuring technique in detail in section  [ sec : the icd ] .",

    ", we use a concordance cosmological model ( @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and @xmath11 ) , assume a chabrier initial mass function ( imf ; @xcite ) , and use ab magnitudes @xcite .",
    "for this work , we make use of deep imaging data taken as part of the cosmic assembly near - infrared deep extragalactic survey ( candels ; pis faber and ferguson ; @xcite ) of the southern region of the great observatories origins deep survey ( goods , hereafter referred to as goods - s , @xcite ) along with extremely deep observations of the hubble ultra deep field ( hudf ) .",
    "the large variation in depth between the goods - s observations and the hudf ensures that we have access to galaxies with a large range in stellar mass .",
    "we take advantage of the third version of the advanced camera for surveys ( acs ) mosaics in goods - s which includes images taken with f435w , f606w , f775w , and f850lp ( hereafter referred to as , , , and ) . in addition , we use imaging obtained from wide field camera 3 ( wfc3 ) in f098 m , f105w , f125w , and f160w ( hereafter as y@xmath12 , , , and ) .",
    "the wfc3 imaging is split into two parts ; the deep portion covers the central 50% of goods - s with the wide portion covering the southern - most 25% to a depth approximately 1 magnitude shallower than the deep portion . to complete our wfc3 coverage of goods - s ,",
    "we make use of the wfc3 science organizing committee s early release science program ( pi oconnell ; @xcite ) which covers the northern 25% in y@xmath12 , , and .    in addition",
    ", we include very deep imaging of the hudf taken with both acs @xcite and wfc3 as part of hudf09 ( pi illingsworth ; e.g. , @xcite ) and udf12 ( pi ellis ; @xcite ) .",

    "see @xcite for full details on the construction of the photometric catalog .",
    "we make use of the photometric redshifts for the galaxies in our sample derived by @xcite .",
    "this photometric redshift catalog is constructed by combining redshifts derived by 11 different investigators using different photometric redshift codes e.g. , eazy @xcite , hyperz @xcite , lephare @xcite , etc .",
    "these photometric redshift codes derive redshifts by fitting different combination of spectral energy distribution templates and priors including available spectroscopic redshifts .",
    "we make use of spectroscopic redshifts where available ( see @xcite for the compilation of spectroscopic datasets ) .",

    "@xcite showed that galaxies with heterogeneous stellar populations have high icd between their rest - frame uv and optical light .",
    "for our galaxy sample with @xmath0 , the candels acs and wfc3 bands probe rest - frame uv and optical wavelengths respectively . using the photometric redshifts described previously ( section [ sec : photoz ] ) we select all galaxies with photometric or spectroscopic redshifts in this range .",
    "we apply a magnitude limit of 25 mag in , which allows for a robust determination of morphological parameters and the icd values ( see section [ sec : icd vs ston ] for reasoning ) . to avoid stars ,",
    "we remove objects with stellarity index @xmath17 ; stellarity derived using sextractor gives a likelihood of an object being a star . applying this set of criteria",
    "yields a parent sample 3369 galaxies .",
    "because the photometric redshifts are the result of the combination of of the probability density functions from many routines , @xcite show they provide more accurate estimates of the redshift .",
    "the method employed by @xcite does not provide additional physical properties for the candels galaxies .",
    "we derive stellar population parameters for the galaxies in our sample using fast @xcite , a stellar population synthesis modeling and fitting code .",
    "we fix the galaxy s redshift at the photometric redshift from the @xcite catalog and fit 14-band galaxy photometry covering @xmath18  with model spectral energy distributions to estimate the stellar masses ( along with dust attenuation ) for the galaxies in the sample .",
    "we used models for a range of stellar population properties from the 2003 version of the bruzual & charlot models ( @xcite ) stellar population synthesis models allowing for a range of attenuation ( @xmath19 mag ) using the @xcite extinction law .",
    "we opt to use @xcite to facilitate the comparison to other studies and because recent work shows that the bruzual & charlot 2007 models may overestimate the contributions of late type giants to the near - ir ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "we assumed models with a delayed , exponentially declining ( log @xmath20 ) star formation history , solar metallicity and a @xcite imf .    using a salpeter imf @xcite would to first order increase systematically the stellar masses by @xmath21 dex .",
    "using different assumptions for the stellar population metallicities will affect the derived stellar masses by @xmath22 dex @xcite .",
    "the average uncertainty in stellar mass for our sample is 0.11 dex , although errors from systematics in the metallicities , star - formation histories and other aspects of the spectral energy distribution fitting likely dominate ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the errors on the photometric redshifts do not influence greatly our conclusions . while , photometric error uncertainties can affect the derivation of stellar population parameters , for small photometric redshift errors , like those for our sample , the contribution to the stellar mass uncertainty is minimal because small changes in redshift translate to small changes in distance ( see discussion in @xcite ) .",
    "for example , our uncertainty of rms@xmath23 = 0.03 $ ] corresponds to a change in luminosity distance of @xmath245% for our sample . because the stellar mass scales quadratically with luminosity distance , the mass uncertainty from photometric redshift errors is similarly small , @xmath2410%",
    "this error is much smaller than systematic uncertainties in stellar mass arising from model fitting ( see discussion in @xcite ) , and so we neglect errors from the photometric redshifts on the stellar masses .    along with stellar masses",
    "fast provides an estimate of the total attenuation ( @xmath25 ) due to dust in a galaxy .",
    "we use this value in section  [ sec : attenuation ] to understand better how the icd might be effected by reddening due to dust .",
    "we use the structural catalog provided by @xcite which provides srsic index , @xmath26 , @xcite and the effective radius , @xmath27 ( measured along the major axis of the galaxy ) , for all sources in the goods - s catalog from @xcite .",
    "these parameters are produced by galfit @xcite using the best - fitting srsic models for the objects in the  imaging .",
    "we also use the non - parametric indicators gini parameter ( @xmath28 ) and the second - order moment of the brightest 20% of the galaxy light , @xmath7 .",
    "these indicators quantify the spatial distribution of light without assuming a specific functional form when classifying the morphologies of disturbed or irregular galaxies . for a complete description of this method see @xcite .",
    "we use color gradient measurements from hilton et al .",
    "( in prep ) , where hilton et al .",
    "compute the color gradients between the core and outskirts by centering annular apertures on each galaxy .",
    "they define concentric , elliptical , annular apertures such that the total  light of each galaxy is divided equally between three annuli .",
    "the galaxy core corresponds to the `` inner '' aperture and the galaxy outskirts correspond to the `` outer '' aperture .",
    "the color gradient of the galaxy is denoted by @xmath29 where , @xmath30 and @xmath31 are the respective apparent magnitudes",
    ". a galaxy where the core has a redder color than the outskirts will have a negative color gradient and a galaxy with a bluer core than outskirts will have a positive gradient .      in this work",
    ", we measure the total star - formation rate ( sfr ) as the sum of the sfr implied by the observed uv luminosity ( uncorrected for dust extinction , @xmath32 ) and by the ir ( as estimated from the 24  luminosity , @xmath33 ) .",
    "we convert the observed 24  luminosity into a sfr using the empirical relationship from @xcite . for galaxies which are not detected in 24 ,",
    "the sfrs are based on an attenuation - corrected uv flux using attenuation value estimated by fast , so @xmath34 . in both instances , we follow @xcite to convert the luminosity to sfr .",
    "the @xcite conversion is salpeter - based , whereas the masses and other derived quantities are chabrier - based . to account for the difference in imf",
    ", we divide the total sfr by 1.66 , @xmath35      in section  [ sec : clumps ] we compare the internal color dispersion measurements to the frequency of discrete star forming regions ( colloquially `` clumps '' ) in galaxies using the clump catalog of @xcite . in order to facilitate clump finding ,",
    "@xcite require galaxies to be approximately face - on ( b / a @xmath36 ) , reasonably extended ( @xmath37 ) , and with a sufficient brightness ( @xmath38 mag ) .",
    "individual clumps are selected from the uv luminosity contrast between the individual clump and the total galaxy . from the catalog , we select clumps with uv luminosity @xmath39 of the total galaxy uv light ( @xmath40 ) contained within galaxies in our sample . while @xcite selects clumps with uv luminosity @xmath41 ; we lower this threshold to include more uv - faint clumps as they are redder and provide a more comprehensive view of the icd .",
    "this provides clump measurements for 180 objects , containing between zero and eight clumps per galaxy .",
    "first developed by @xcite , the internal color dispersion ( icd ) is a flux - independent statistic , defined as the ratio of the squared difference of the image flux - intensity values about the mean galaxy color to the square of the total image flux , or , @xmath42 the icd assesses the morphological difference of a galaxy between two passbands .",
    "the rest - frame uv - optical icd quantifies the spatial homogeneity ( or lack thereof ) between young stellar populations ( dominating the rest - frame uv light ) and older stellar populations , contributing most of the rest - frame optical light . galaxies with",
    "spatially segregated stellar populations with different colors would have large icd ( see @xcite ) .",
    "whereas , a galaxy with a homogeneous stellar population throughout would have a low icd .",
    "the terms in equation  [ eqn : xi ] sum over @xmath43 with @xmath44 being the number of pixels associated with each galaxy , @xmath45 and @xmath46 are the image flux  intensity values for each object obtained in each of two passbands and @xmath47 and @xmath48 are the pixel intensity values from a contiguous , similarly sized , region of the two passbands not associated with any object .    to determine which pixels belong to a galaxy we define the aperture size as @xmath49 , where @xmath50 is the petrosian radius of @xmath46 as defined for the _ sloan digital sky survey _ @xcite , and @xmath51 is defined as the ratio of the galaxy surface brightness , @xmath52 , averaged over an annulus of radius @xmath53 , to the mean surface brightness within this radius , @xmath54 .",
    "the petrosian radius depends on the surface ",
    "brightness distribution of the galaxy and is thus independent of redshift or systematics in the image calibration .",
    "the chosen aperture encompasses most of the light from the galaxy without adding excessive background light .",
    "therefore , the summations are over the individual pixels associated with the object or blank region of a similar size .",
    "the scaling factor @xmath55 is the ratio of total fluxes between images @xmath46 and @xmath45 , while the linear offset @xmath56 adjusts ( if necessary ) for differences in the relative background levels of the two images . in practice , we calculate these terms by minimizing the statistic , @xmath57 ^ 2 $ ] , adjusting @xmath55 and @xmath56 as free parameters ( where @xmath58 represents the uncertainties on the @xmath46 flux  intensity values ) .",
    "the treatment of the background terms ( @xmath47 and @xmath48 ) are important to the icd , as the background itself can contain an intrinsic amount of internal color dispersion based on our definition .",
    "therefore , to eliminate icd contribution from the background , @xmath47 and @xmath48 are selected for each individual galaxies to contain the same number of pixels ( @xmath44 ) at random locations excluding any preexisting objects , and include the same pixels in both image 1 and 2 . in order to minimize the icd variations due to background , we select the median icd value computed from using nine different background regions . however , simple fluctuations may not be the only source of icd . because , the wfc3 imaging psf has been convolved ( see section  [ sec : data ] ) to match that of the acs , there exists the possibility of correlated noise in the background measurements .",
    "this could have an effect if the background region is not selected in the same way as the galaxy ( e.g. , choosing individual pixels at random versus a single contiguous region ) .",
    "we test for possible effects by choosing individual pixels not associated with an object at random from the imaging , choosing a single contiguous _",
    "square _ region and contiguous _ circular _ region .",
    "we find no effect based on the morphology of chosen background pixels .",
    "previous studies @xcite noted that the icd produces unreliable results for galaxies with low signal - to - noise ( s / n ) .",
    "we test the behavior of the icd using simulated galaxies with _ a priori _ known ( fixed ) total flux and icd .",
    "each simulated galaxy is placed throughout the _ hst _ images at a random location and is then checked to insure no overlap with an actual object by comparing the location with the sextractor segmentation image .",
    "the flux of the galaxy is slowly decreased to a level barely above the background .",
    "we then derive an icd value for each simulated object using the definition in equation  [ eqn : xi ] .     in the _ bluer band",
    "_ the median icd deviates more than 34% away from the true value .",
    "therefore , we remove any object from our initial sample that have @xmath59 in the bluer band .",
    "the s / n requirement for galaxies with intrinsically high icd could be set to a lower threshold , but we choose to constant criterion to keep the selection uniform.,scaledwidth=49.0% ]    figure  [ fig : ston_i ] shows the fractional change ( true minus observed divided by true ) in the icd as a function of @xmath60 , where @xmath61 represents the flux ",
    "intensity values , and @xmath62 is the image variance due to the noise of the background . the sum is taken over all pixels identified as belonging to the object , by computing the petrosian radius and comparing the enclosed pixels to the sextractor segmentation image .",
    "the four simulated objects illustrate how different levels of icd ( 2% , 6% , 13% , and 26% ) are effected by the galaxy s s / n .    the behavior of the fractional change is dramatically different depending on whether a galaxy has intrinsically `` low '' or `` high '' icd . for all galaxies with very high s",
    "/ n we recover the expected icd to within 0.1%",
    ". however , as the s / n decreases equation  [ eqn : xi ] systematically _ underestimates _ the icd .",
    "this bias is most apparent for galaxies with `` low '' intrinsic icd .    because of the systematic underestimation of the icd it is important to clip the sample at a s / n which still provides accurate results .",
    "we choose s / n = 10 such that the bias is does not impact our results",
    ". for example , the bias is the fractional change ( @xmath63 ) . for objects with s / n = 10 and high intrinsic icd ( @xmath64 ) , the bias is small , with relative changes of @xmath65 , and the bias decreases for objects with increasing icd .",
    "the bias increases for objects with lower intrinsic icd , such that the relative change is 100% for objects with s / n = 10 and @xmath66 .",
    "this is acceptable because the icd increases by only a factor of 2 .",
    "therefore , to our s /",
    "n = 10 limit , we can be confident that objects with observed high icd have high intrinsic icd , and objects with low observed icd have low intrinsic icd .    in principle",
    "this s / n requirement applies to both bands used in equation  [ eqn : xi ] .",
    "however , for this particular study , the redder band ( namely ) s / n is much higher in the majority of galaxies analyzed , such that this requirement , in practice , only applies to the bluer imaging band .",
    "it is also important to note that this s / n does not correspond to a single bluer band magnitude limit , because at fixed magnitude a larger object ( with lower surface brightness ) will have a lower s / n . for galaxies with an intrinsic icd very near zero , and low surface brightness in the bluer band , it is possible for the icd calculation to produce negative results when the background contributes significantly to the fluctuations .",
    "galaxies with an intrinsically larger icd are more resistant to surface brightness dimming as the fluctuations of the galaxy dominate those of the background .    after applying the s / n = 10 restriction in",
    ", we have a final , primary sample of 2601 galaxies .",
    "unfortunately , this s / n requirement leads to a selection effect where we prefer galaxies with some level of active star - formation , as passively evolving galaxies often do not have enough blue light to be included in this analysis .",
    "the effect of this selection bias is discussed further in section  [ sec : icdvmass ] .",
    "@xcite defines the statistical error associated with the icd , assuming that the background pixels ( those not associated with any galaxy ) are normally distributed , as @xmath67 @xcite note that equation  [ eq : icd error ] underestimates the uncertainties associated with the icd .",
    "they estimated that the uncertainties for equation  [ eqn : xi ] in their data required corrections of factors of 6 - 7 to account for correlated noise in the images .",
    "@xcite find that even after the correction suggested by @xcite , the uncertainty on the icd obtained for bright objects ( those with low errors ) are underestimated by as much as a factor of three .",
    "the dominant source of error being contributions from non - uniform sky backgrounds and psf mismatch between the two passbands .    for this work ,",
    "we use the observed icd values for different levels of intrinsic icd and galaxy s / n to estimate the error associated with each measurement . to estimate the systematic uncertainty we compare the median icd fractional change ( the dashed line in figure  [ fig : ston_i ] ) to the true value , and to estimate the statistical uncertainty we compute the median absolute deviation .    in all cases , galaxies with very high (  s / n @xmath68 )",
    "s / n have low ( @xmath69 ) systematic uncertainties and very low ( @xmath70 ) statistical uncertainties .",
    "the closer to our s / n cutoff ( s / n = 10 ) the systematic error , described in the previous section , increasingly dominates .",
    "the statistical uncertainty remains very low @xmath71 and so we neglect any effect due to the statistical variation in the icd .",
    "for the majority of our results we choose to use @xmath72 as our primary diagnostic . for the galaxies in our sample ,",
    "these two filters span the balmer/4000  break over @xmath73 , and allow us to compare the rest - frame uv ( traced by the  band ) to the rest - frame optical ( traced by the  band ) .",
    "this provides us the ability to investigate recent star formation ( with ) and past - averaged star formation ( with ) . in several sections (",
    "section  [ sec : icdvmass ] and section  [ sec : redshift ] ) we make use of different versions of the icd , namely @xmath74 which allows us to compare slightly different parts of each galaxy s spectral energy distribution to better understand the results given by @xmath75 .",
    "the median icd for the full sample is @xmath76 . in the sections that follow we refer to galaxies with icd value above and below this median as `` high '' and `` low '' icd , respectively          stellar mass is one of the most fundamental properties of galaxies .",
    "the stellar mass of a galaxy correlates with many of its physical properties including overall color @xcite and sfr ( e.g. , @xcite ) to @xmath77 ( and perhaps beyond e.g. , @xcite ) . as such , it is possible to gain much insight into the formation and evolution of galaxies through the rates of change of the icd as functions of stellar mass .",
    "figure  [ fig : icd_vs_mass ] shows the @xmath75 as a function of stellar mass for the galaxies in our sample .",
    "we find the median @xmath75 values in the three low stellar mass bins are between @xmath78 , the median icd value in the moderate stellar mass bin is above 8% , and at stellar masses @xmath79 , we find that galaxies have a median icd value about 9% . if we take into account the systematic underestimations of low icd values , discussed in section  [ sec : icd error ] , we find little relative change in the median @xmath75 between bins , in that the moderate stellar mass bins still show higher @xmath75 medians than the bins of lower stellar masses .        to illustrate the icd , figure  [ fig : montage ] shows galaxy images in the @xmath72-mass plane .",
    "the galaxies are selected at random from all of the galaxies contained in each bin of mass and @xmath75 .",
    "the rgb images are combinations of , and .",
    "galaxies with elevated icd values ( top rows ) and in the moderate stellar mass range appear significantly different than the galaxies in other stellar mass bin or galaxies with lower icd values .",
    "visually , galaxies with high icd have morphologies with well - separated regions of rest - frame uv ( blue ) and rest - frame optical ( red ) light .",
    "galaxies with low icd values tend to have smooth morphologies and uniform colors , suggesting fewer regions of separated red and blue emission .",
    "the highest stellar mass galaxies ( @xmath80 ) deserve special attention .",
    "because the s / n threshold applies only to the bluer band used in the icd calculation , galaxies which are well detected in  may not be well detected in .",
    "specifically , massive galaxies often have the reddest @xmath81 colors , so we expect that many of them have high  s / n and low  s / n .",
    "the concern is that these objects could have higher intrinsic icd , but are excluded because of our signal to noise requirement ( see section  [ sec : icd vs ston ] ) .    to investigate this possibility",
    ", we compare the mean @xmath81 color of the high stellar mass galaxies included and excluded from our sample .",
    "galaxies which have s / n@xmath82 have @xmath83 mag while galaxies with s / n@xmath84 have @xmath85 mag .",
    "this suggests that the excluded high stellar mass galaxies simply do not have enough blue light to produce high icd values .",
    "@xcite simulate just such a situation where the authors find that extremely red galaxies , even with the addition of highly star - forming regions produce nearly no icd as the older stellar populations simply overwhelm any diversity .",
    "for the seven high stellar mass galaxies with @xmath86 mag in our sample , four have high @xmath72 ; however , a visual inspection provides additional insight into these objects ( discussed below ) .",
    "a visual inspection of the 26 most massive galaxies , shown in figure  [ fig : highmass_stamps ] shows that the majority of these objects have smooth light profiles in both , and .",
    "there are several exceptions which fall into two broad categories : galaxies which appear to have faint , nearby objects detected in  but not  ( e.g. , 16375 , 17205 and 16934 ) . because  serves as the object detection image , it is possible that these faint objects lie within the  pertrosian radius used for the icd calculation , contributing significantly to the measured icd . while the origin of these nearby objects is unclear ,",
    "possible scenarios include a chance alignment or a disrupted satellite . and , galaxies in the highest - mass subsample with extended structures , showing distinct red / blue regions and likely individual `` clumps '' of star - formation embedded within the galactic structures ( e.g. , 282 , 15639 and 15261 ) .",
    "in both cases , these features contrast with the  dominated central region producing the large @xmath75 value . the blue central regions in the @xmath81 color maps reflects small mismatches in the psf matching ( see @xcite for a description ) and do not contribute significantly to the icd as they are small compared to the total flux of the galaxy .",
    "after a visual inspection , if we remove the galaxies with neighboring objects from the high stellar mass bin the median @xmath75 becomes @xmath87 .",
    "however , if we instead place a more stringent  s / n requirement (  s / n @xmath88 ) on the high stellar mass galaxies , we find the median @xmath75 further drops to 3.3% .    because it is unclear whether or not the faint objects neighboring the primary galaxy are physically associated with the primary , or are chance alignments along the line of sight , we do not exclude these objects and do not adjust the  s / n requirement .",
    "instead , we note that these are objects are infrequent in the sample , and so do not affect our conclusions .",
    "so while the median @xmath75 in the high stellar mass bin may appear to be very similar to the moderate stellar mass bins , it is likely that the median is being inflated due to inclusion of galaxies with neighboring objects or galaxies with low  s / n and high  s / n .      many previous works ( e.g. , @xcite ) use the srsic index to classify a galaxy s morphology",

    "the systematic underestimation described in section  [ sec : icd error ] , has very little effect on the preference of galaxies with low srsic index and intermediate stellar mass to have high @xmath75 .",

    ". a uniformly blue galaxy would begin with a blue @xmath129 color and if we were to add a level of inhomogeneous dust then we would expect the icd to rise , as there is now red light with which to contrast the blue and the overall color to shift toward the red .",

    "both authors acknowledge that extinction variations could play a role in providing variations in the blue starlight , but conclude that the effect is smaller than those produced by variations in segregated stellar populations of different mass - weighted ages .",

    "@xcite suggest that in order to have icd @xmath134 , young star - forming disk in galaxies are required to have a surrounding older spheroid ; for higher icds ( @xmath135 ) , they suggest compact star - forming hii regions ( discrete star - forming regions or clumps ) are also required .",
    "this picture is corroborated in a recent study by @xcite who found that star - forming galaxies at @xmath136 , with stellar masses @xmath137 have redder centers and bluer outer regions .",

    "the mean number of clumps per galaxy is 1.2 ; for galaxies with higher icds ( @xmath139 ) , the mean number of clumps is 2.1 therefore , we find that if a galaxy has at least two clumps , on the average , it will have a high @xmath75 value .",
    "this trend continues , where galaxies with four or more clumps show median icd of greater than 10% .",
    "therefore , the icd is sensitive to the number of star - forming clumps .",
    "the clump catalog provides several clump detection levels ( see section  [ sec : data_clumps ] ) .",
    "when we increase in the detection threshold ( uv luminosity @xmath139 instead of @xmath140 ) we find the mean number of clumps remains roughly constant ( @xmath141 ) regardless of the @xmath75 value . also ,",
    "while the total number of clumps per galaxy is reduced , we find the @xmath75 of galaxies with fewer than two clumps remains generally unchanged between the two uv luminosity thresholds .    because the star - forming clumps are expected to form in gas - rich disks ( e.g.@xcite ) , the icd must trace galaxies which have a redder but still gaseous stellar disk .",
    "these individual clumps are thought to be relatively short lived ( only @xmath142 myr ; @xcite ) , which would correspond well with the lifetimes of hot , blue stars contributing to the uv light associated with high icd .",
    "for the galaxies in this study , we find that as both the stellar mass and srsic index increase , the icd decreases ( figure  [ fig : icd_vs_mass_vs_sersic ] ) .",
    "this is unsurprising as previous studies suggest galaxies with high srsic indices have smooth light profiles with little color variation across them ( e.g.  @xcite ) and these stellar populations produce little color dispersion as any variation is small relative to the total galaxy flux @xcite .",
    "however , the galaxies with high icd values have intermediate stellar mass and are disk - dominated ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "as mentioned previously , @xcite found that for a galaxy to have high icd a red bulge surrounded by a blue disk with hii regions ( i.e.  clumps ) is required . because high icd is most prominent in disk - dominated morphologies and associated with star - forming clumps , the icd is less sensitive to the red bulge component and more driven by the color variation between the underlying stellar disk and highly star - forming clump .",
    "we see this in the previous comparison of the @xmath75 computed with and without the central region ( see section  [ sec : color gradients ] ) , where we found that galaxies with their nuclear region removed show an increased @xmath75 ( figure  [ fig : icd_icdcored ] ) .",
    "interpreted another way , the decrease of @xmath75 with increasing srsic index suggests that there is a continual suppression of the mechanism which causes high icd ( perhaps clumps ) with spheroid formation .",
    "this shows that _ if _ galaxies are to form quiescent bulges or spheroids along with a star - forming disk or clumps ( as is typical of classical hubble sequence galaxies ) it is only happening at this moderate ( @xmath143 ) stellar mass range and with relatively small bulge contributions .",
    "once a bulge contributes significantly to the galaxy s morphology , the amount of icd decreases dramatically , suggesting that the bulge plays a role in the homogenization of the galaxy s stellar populations .",
    "two different effects could be associated with the formation of a bulge and subsequent reduction in the observed icd .",
    "one theory is the `` morphological quenching '' @xcite concept , by which the formation of the a bulge stabilizes the gaseous disk against further fracturing and star formation .",
    "the second could be some feedback process associated with the bulge which removes any remaining gas from the disk , preventing new clump formation .",
    "the first step in the quenching process is to form a strong bulge component .",
    "one scenario for this process is for clumps to migrate through dynamical friction to coalesce in the nuclei , and merge to form a bulge ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the galaxies with high icd values also show negative color gradients ( figure  [ fig : icd_vs_color_grad ] ) suggesting the central stars are older ( or perhaps more attenuated by dust ) than the outer star - forming regions .",
    "other studies ( e.g. , @xcite ) find that central clumps are both older ( by @xmath144 myrs ) and more attenuated than the clumps in the outskirts suggesting that migration plays a significant role .",
    "of course , not all galaxies in the moderate stellar mass range have high icd values .",
    "either only some galaxies have periods of high icd or all galaxies go through such a phase , but the period of elevated icd is very short lived . if all galaxies experience a period of elevated icd at some point during their evolution , then the characteristic time scale of high icd is the product of the time spanned by the look - back time across the redshift range ( 2.4 grys ) and the fraction of sources with high icd . in this work ,",
    "21% of galaxies have @xmath145 . therefore",
    ", if all galaxies go through a high icd phase , then the timescale of high icd is approximately 375 myrs .",
    "this timescale is similar to the predicted clump survival timescale of @xmath146 myrs @xcite .",
    "regardless of the mechanism at work , there is a distinct suppression in the icd of galaxies once a bulge is formed .",
    "galaxies which contain highly star forming clumps match well the description of these high icd objects and clump migration could be a primary cause of icd suppression .",
    "it will take further investigation in the future to better associate galaxies showing high icd with star forming clumps .",
    "in this work , we investigate the dependence of the rest - frame uv and optical icd on other galaxy properties .",
    "we define the icd as the ratio of the square difference of the image flux ",
    "intensity values about the mean galaxy color to the square of the total image flux .",
    "it is a measure of the amount of variation in the stellar diversity of a galaxy ; that is separated red and blue stellar populations . using imaging from candels of goods - south and the hudf , we select galaxies between @xmath147 , a  magnitude brighter than 25 mag and a requirement that the signal - to - noise be sufficient enough to provide an accurate measurement of the icd ( see section  [ sec : qc and selection ] ) .",
    "this selection yields 2601 galaxies .",
    "we present our results from comparing the icd to the stellar mass of the galaxies ( section  [ sec : icdvmass ] ) , the morphology based on srisc index ( section  [ sec : sersic ] ) and star formation rates ( section  [ sec : icdvssfr ] ) .",
    "we then investigate possible causes of the icd including : mergers ( section  [ sec : mergers ] ) , physical size ( section  [ sec : size ] ) , color gradients ( section  [ sec : color gradients ] ) , band - pass shifting effects ( section  [ sec : redshift ] ) , attenuation ( section  [ sec : attenuation ] ) and clumpy star forming regions ( section  [ sec : clumps ] ) .",
    "we attribute icd to heterogeneous stellar populations ( possibly clumps ) with a possible contribution from dust attenuation .",
    "* galaxies have the largest amount of stellar population diversity , as measured by the icd , at stellar masses @xmath148 .",
    "this stellar mass range corresponds well to the range in which local galaxies experience a decrease in their star formation efficiency , and galaxies at @xmath136 which are found to show star forming clumps .",
    "therefore , the stellar population diversity driving the icd could be discrete , highly star - forming regions contrasted against an older , redder , underlying population . *",
    "high icd is preferentially found in galaxies with extended light profiles ( srisc index @xmath1 ) .",
    "this suggests that galaxies only have diverse stellar populations when there is little or no bulge present .",
    "* there is a continual suppression in the mechanism which causes high icd with increasing srisc index .",
    "this could be due formation of clumps , which initially increase the icd , and then migrate toward the center and coalescence into a quiescent bulge .",
    "the presence of this bulge then stabilizes the disk again fragmentation and new clump formation , which suppresses the icd .",
    "the results suggests that some fraction of galaxies with high icd are a result of the combination of structures such as quiescent bulges and star - forming ( perhaps clump ) disks in galaxies .",
