    "as numerical relativity is empowered by ever larger computers , numerical evolutions of black hole data sets are becoming more and more common@xcite .",
    "the need for such simulations is great , especially as gravitational wave observatories like the ligo / virgo / tama / geo network are gearing up to collect gravitational wave data over the next decade ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "a recent , thorough , and very detailed study indicates that black hole collisions are considered a most likely source of signals to be detected by these observatories@xcite . among the conclusions of this work",
    "is that reliable information about the merger process can be crucial not only to the interpretation of such observations , but also could greatly enhance the detection rate .",
    "therefore , it is crucial to have a detailed theoretical understanding of the coalescence process , and particularly the merger phase , that can only be achieved through numerical simulation .    however , numerical simulations of black holes have proved very difficult , largely because of the problems associated with dealing with singularities present inside . even in axisymmetry , at present it is difficult to evolve black hole systems beyond about @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the mass of the system@xcite . in 3d calculations ,",
    "the huge memory requirements make these problems much more severe .",
    "the most advanced 3d calculations based on traditional cauchy evolution methods published to date , utilizing massively parallel computers , have difficulty evolving schwarzschild  @xcite , misner  @xcite , or distorted schwarzschild  @xcite beyond about @xmath3 .",
    "characteristic evolution methods have been used to evolve distorted black holes in 3d indefinitely@xcite , although to date waveforms have not been extracted and verified , and it is not clear whether the technique will be able to handle highly distorted or colliding black holes due to potential trouble with caustics .    in spite of these problems ,",
    "much physics has been learned , especially in axisymmetry .",
    "there , calculations of distorted black holes with @xcite and without angular momentum@xcite , have been performed .",
    "furthermore , calculations of the misner two black hole initial data have been carried out@xcite , and the waveforms generated during the collision process have been extensively compared to calculations performed using perturbation theory@xcite .",
    "one of the important results to emerge from these studies is that the numerical and perturbative results agree very well , giving great confidence in both approaches .",
    "in particular , the perturbative approach turned out to work extremely well in some regimes where it was not , _ a priori _ , expected to be accurate .",
    "this has led to considerable interest in comparing perturbative calculations to full scale numerical simulations , as a way of not only confirming the validity of each approach , but also as an aid to interpreting the physics of the systems@xcite .",
    "we expect this rich interplay between perturbation theory and numerical simulation to play an important role in the future of numerical relativity .    to this end , in the present paper we study a family of distorted axisymmetric and full 3d black hole initial data sets using perturbative techniques .",
    "these data sets consist of single black holes that have been distorted by the addition of gravitational waves .",
    "they can be considered to represent the final stages of the coalescence of two black holes , just after the horizons have merged .",
    "they therefore provide an excellent system to study the late stages of this process without having to model the long and difficult inspiral period .    by using perturbative techniques to compute the waveforms expected in the evolution of these data sets",
    ", we provide an important testbed for full nonlinear codes that should evolve the same systems . in regimes",
    "where the distortions are considered moderately small perturbations of the underlying schwarzschild or kerr geometries , full scale numerical calculations should agree well with the type of perturbative treatment presented here .",
    "we expect that these results should have many uses in testing numerical relativity codes , and should also be useful in interpreting the physics contained in such simulations . for cases where",
    "different 3d codes and techniques are being developed , these results should help certify and interpret the numerical results .",
    "for example , 3d codes are being developed with standard adm and new hyperbolic formulations of the equations@xcite , with different slicing conditions .",
    "new approaches to black hole evolution that promise to extend dramatically the accuracy and duration of such calculations are under development , such as apparent horizon boundary conditions ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite and references therein ) or very recently characteristic evolution  @xcite . in all cases , these testbeds should be applicable and should provide important tests of the numerical simulation results .",
    "in this section we provide the basic mathematical formalism for evolving distorted black holes as perturbative systems .",
    "we want to investigate the possibility of treating the non - spherical multipole moments of a general ( numerical ) spacetime as a linear perturbation about its `` background '' spherical part . roughly speaking",
    ", this approach should be a valid way to describe black hole spacetimes whose nonspherical departure from schwarzschild is small . in practice , such an approach has already shown itself to be spectacularly successful in the `` close - limit '' approximation that regards the misner initial data for two colliding black holes as a nonspherical perturbation to schwarzschild  @xcite . in this paper",
    "we apply similar ideas to the evolution of distorted single black hole spacetimes , providing detailed comparisons with fully nonlinear numerical evolutions in axisymmetry , and providing the framework for comparing fully 3d simulations with perturbative evolutions .",
    "this approach is also motivated by earlier work of ref .",
    "@xcite , where perturbative evolution was used as a check on numerical evolution , but not as a way to evolve cauchy initial data .",
    "we assume the spacetime metric @xmath4 to be in some general coordinate system @xmath5 .",
    "this metric comes either from an analytic solution to the einstein equations , or a numerical simulation . at this point",
    "we do not distinguish between these cases . in this coordinate system",
    "we can always write the metric in the form @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the spherically symmetric @xmath8 term , in a decomposition of @xmath4 into tensor spherical harmonics , and @xmath9 contains the higher multipoles which describe the deviations from the spherically symmetric @xmath8 mode .",
    "the terms @xmath9 satisfy , to @xmath10 , the linear field equations , linearized about @xmath7 . thus if the terms @xmath9 are small , in the sense that @xmath11 , they can be well approximated by a solution to the linearized equations .    our general approach",
    "then , is to take cauchy initial data which we expect to describe a system which is close to spherical symmetry . from this initial data ,",
    "we use a decomposition into tensor spherical harmonics to construct a background metric @xmath12 , and perturbations @xmath9 .",
    "the perturbations @xmath9 are then evolved using the linear field equations .",
    "the methods for extracting @xmath7 and @xmath9 , and for evolving @xmath9 are now discussed in detail .",
    "we write the background metric in the form @xmath13 the perturbations @xmath9 , which describe the deviations from spherical symmetry , are expanded using regge - wheeler harmonics  @xcite as @xmath14 in the above , there are seven even - parity @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 and three odd - parity @xmath22 variables , which are functions only of @xmath23 and @xmath24 . in eqs .",
    "( [ eqn : rw1 ] ) to ( [ eqn : rw10 ] ) a summation over the modes @xmath25 , @xmath26 is understood .",
    "given this formal expansion of the full metric @xmath27 , using the orthogonality of spherical harmonics we can extract the components of the background metric @xmath12 by appropriate integrations over the 2-sphere @xmath28 ( we note that a similar expression in ref.@xcite contained an error ) .",
    "the ten variables describing the non - spherical contributions ( for @xmath29 ) can be extracted by similar integrals , for example @xmath30 a complete list of formulae is given in appendix  [ app : extraction_formulae ] . in the usual case where the full metric @xmath27 is given numerically , say after solving the cauchy initial value problem of numerical relativity , these integrals over 2-spheres can be computed numerically . in certain cases ,",
    "the initial data may be known analytically , in which case the integrals can also be computed analytically . in the sections below",
    "we shall encounter examples of both cases . in any case , by performing these integrals over a series of 2-spheres of different radii on a given time slice ( say , the initial time slice ) , we obtain the spherical background metric coefficients @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 and for each nonspherical @xmath34mode the ten metric perturbation functions , e.g. , @xmath18 .",
    "these metric perturbation functions , coming directly from the metric , are gauge dependent ; their values will depend on the particular gauge used , say , by the numerical code used to generate them . however , a gauge - invariant perturbation theory of spherical spacetimes has been developed by various authors  @xcite . as shown originally by abrahams  @xcite ,",
    "such formalisms can be used in numerical relativity calculations to isolate the even- and odd - parity gauge - invariant gravitational wave functions .",
    "the basic idea is that while the metric perturbation quantities , such as @xmath18 , will transform under infinitesimal coordinate transformations @xmath35 in the usual way , one can use this information to construct special quantities that are invariant under such gauge transformations . on a schwarzschild background",
    "these gauge - invariant quantities are found to obey the standard regge - wheeler and zerilli equations describing gravitational waves propagating on the spherical black hole background .",
    "we will follow this approach below .    to compute these gauge - invariant perturbations on the general , _ time - dependent _ background @xmath7",
    ", we could follow the work of refs .",
    "@xcite and construct gauge - invariant functions from the extracted @xmath36 multipole moments , and evolve these functions using the gauge - invariant linearized equations . in this way we could treat data which is given in a general , and even time dependent , spherical coordinate system (",
    "although we note that in the present formalism the shift terms @xmath37 must be treated as perturbations , i.e. , they must be formally @xmath38 ) . here",
    ", we take a simpler approach , which has so far been suitable for our needs .",
    "we assume that the cauchy initial data for @xmath4 is , to @xmath38 , given on a hypersurface of constant schwarzschild time .",
    "we then construct gauge invariant variables using moncrief s prescription @xcite , which can then be easily evolved using the zerilli or regge - wheeler wave equations .",
    "we first transform @xmath4 to the areal radial coordinate , using @xmath39 and then @xmath40 note that @xmath41 can be easily calculated using @xmath42 then , we calculate all the required multipole moments of this transformed metric , integrating the metric over 2-spheres as described above , using formulae detailed in the appendix  [ app : extraction_formulae ] .",
    "this provides the ten metric perturbation functions as described above .    with this information , following moncrief",
    "we construct an odd - parity function @xmath43 , and an even - parity function @xmath44 , which are invariant under first order coordinate transformations .",
    "these are defined by @xmath45 \\frac{s}{r } \\\\ \\text{and } \\nonumber\\\\ q^{+}_{lm } & = & \\frac{1}{\\lambda}\\sqrt{\\frac{2(l-1)(l+2)}{l(l+1 ) } }          \\left(l(l+1)s        ( r^2\\partial_r g^{(\\ell m)}-2h_1^{(\\ell m ) } ) \\nonumber \\right . \\\\&&+\\left .",

    "we approximate this mass by examining the function @xmath47 , given by @xmath48 in practice , in the spacetimes we are considering here , the function @xmath47 is quite constant in @xmath49 , and so there is no practical ambiguity in computing the mass . alternatively , for very small perturbations , one could consider simply using the adm mass of the spacetime for @xmath2 , as is often done  @xcite , but this will include contributions from the waves in the spacetime . hence the mass defined by eq .",
    "( [ eq : mass ] ) provides a slight improvement in the treatment .    while the individual metric quantities @xmath9 will transform in the usual way by a linear gauge transformation @xmath50 , the functions @xmath51 and @xmath52 are invariant , and thus are more directly connected to the physics of the system .",
    "we note that we have introduced a slight inconsistency in our construction of the gauge - invariant quantities @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "we have defined the regge - wheeler perturbation functions ( e.g. @xmath18 ) in a general way , on a general time - dependent background metric , but in computing the gauge - invariant quantities we have simply assumed the background to be in schwarzschild coordinates .",
    "more complex expressions for the gauge - invariants on the more general background could be used , but in the present applications this has not proved to be necessary .    at this stage we hint at a complication in this procedure which will we return to in more detail below .",
    "the numerical prescription outlined above , using integrals over 2spheres to pick off the different @xmath53 wave modes in a distorted black hole spacetime , simply lumps `` everything not spherical '' into the wavefunctions .",
    "it does not discriminate between contributions at various orders in the perturbation expansion , but rather it lumps them altogether .",
    "one must be careful when using the standard perturbation equations , as described below , which are derived from a formal theory keeping only terms at linear order .",
    "in particular , we will encounter cases where some perturbation modes appear _ only _ at higher order .      having taken a general distorted black hole metric ,",
    "we have detailed a technique to compute the gauge - invariant functions describing the waves on a schwarzschild background .",
    "we now turn to the linearized evolution of these quantities .",

    "must also be calculated to provide cauchy data for the evolution . in this paper only time",
    "symmetric initial data has been used , for which @xmath62 but it is no problem to provide time derivatives through analysis of the extrinsic curvature variables given as initial data in the more general non - time symmetric case .    to summarize the development of this section , we have detailed the technique we use to isolate the even- and odd - parity gauge - invariant perturbation functions @xmath60 and @xmath61 from a numerically generated metric , under the assumption that the waves are linear perturbations on a spherical background metric .",
    "this information can be used in two ways : ( a ) it can be used to extract waveforms from a numerical simulation at a finite radius , and ( b ) it can be used to provide initial data for the linearized evolution equations given originally by regge - wheeler ( odd - parity ) and zerilli ( even - parity ) .",
    "these evolution equations can be used to compare results obtained with the full nonlinear evolution of black hole spacetimes .",
    "in this section we take the somewhat abstract discussion of the previous section and show how one applies it in practice to an actual family of numerically generated distorted black hole data sets .",
    "the method is tested on the so - called black hole plus brill wave spacetimes  @xcite , which represent a black hole distorted by a gravitational wave .",
    "the deviation from a schwarzschild spacetime can be parameterized by a dimensionless parameter @xmath63 , corresponding to the amplitude of the wave . in the sections below we describe these initial data sets ,",
    "describe tests we can perform on the procedures used to obtain initial data for the perturbation equations discussed above , and in section  [ sec : evol ] we compare linear and nonlinear numerical evolutions .      in this section",
    "we review the single distorted black hole initial data sets that we evolve in this paper .",
    "these black holes are distorted by the presence of an adjustable torus of nonlinear gravitational waves .",
    "the amplitude and shape of the initial wave can be specified by hand , as described below , and a range of initial data can be created , from slightly perturbed to very highly distorted black holes .",
    "such initial data sets , and their evolutions in axisymmetry , have been studied extensively , as described in refs.@xcite .",
    "three dimensional versions have been developed and studied recently in refs.@xcite .",
    "following@xcite , we write the 3metric in the form originally used by brill  @xcite : @xmath64 where @xmath24 is a radial coordinate defined by @xmath65 , where @xmath2 and @xmath66 are the mass and standard schwarzschild isotropic radial coordinate of the black hole in the schwarzschild limit , described below . in this paper , we choose our initial slice to be time symmetric , so that the extrinsic curvature vanishes , although more general datasets can also be considered@xcite .",
    "given a choice for the `` brill wave '' function @xmath67 , the hamiltonian constraint leads to an elliptic equation for the conformal factor @xmath68 .",
    "the function @xmath67 represents the gravitational wave surrounding the black hole , and is chosen to be @xmath69 thus , an initial data set is characterized by the parameters @xmath70 , where , roughly speaking , @xmath63 is the amplitude of the brill wave , @xmath71 is its radial location , @xmath72 its width , and @xmath73 and @xmath74 control its angular structure .",
    "the parameters @xmath73 , which must be a positive even integer , and @xmath74 dictate the angular ( @xmath75 ) structure of the brill wave . in particular , if @xmath76 , the resulting spacetime is axisymmetric .",
    "a study of full 3d initial data and their evolutions are discussed elsewhere @xcite . if the amplitude @xmath63 vanishes , the undistorted schwarzschild solution results , leading to @xmath77    note that the initial data defined by eq .",
    "( [ eq : metric ] ) and ( [ eq : q2d ] ) have octant symmetry ( i.e. , equatorial plane symmetry and discrete symmetry in the four quadrants around the @xmath78axis ) .",
    "together with the time - symmetry condition , this implies that @xmath79 and @xmath80 is real , and only non - zero for even @xmath81 and @xmath82 .",
    "therefore in the tests performed in this paper , only even - parity modes with even @xmath83 numbers are present , and in all analysis that follows linear evolutions will be carried out with the zerilli evolution equation",
    ". however , the techniques presented are quite general , and can be used on a wider class of initial data sets than considered here , containing the full range of modes . all the data sets considered now , and in the following sections have @xmath84 , @xmath85 and @xmath86 , that is , loosely speaking , the brill waves initially have unit width , and are centered on the throat of an @xmath84 schwarzschild black hole .    the elliptic equation to be solved for @xmath68 must in general be solved numerically , as will normally be the case .",
    "once this is done , it can be evolved with a fully nonlinear numerical relativity code , and it can be also be used to compute initial data for the perturbation equations as described above .    however , in this case we can also write down a solution in terms of special functions which analytically solves the hamiltonian constraint to linear order in the expansion parameter @xmath63 .",
    "this will provide a useful check on our procedures to compute linear initial data for the perturbation equations from the full nonlinear , numerically generated data .",
    "we give these solutions in schematic form below , and in more detail in appendix  [ app : linsol ] .",
    "the conformal factor is expanded into spherical harmonics , such that @xmath87 and the hamiltonian constraint is solved to linear order in the expansion parameter @xmath63 .",
    "depending on the parameters considered in eq .",
    "( [ eq : q2d ] ) , the resulting linear conformal factor has a different angular structure .",
    "three cases are considered in the following :    1 .",
    "@xmath88 , @xmath76 : the only non - zero coefficients are @xmath89 , @xmath90 and @xmath91 .",
    "@xmath92 , @xmath76 : in this axisymmetric case , the only non - zero coefficients in the expansion are @xmath89 and @xmath90 .",
    "the @xmath91 term that one might expect is _",
    "missing_. note that this implies that at linear order the @xmath93 zerilli function vanishes , although it will appear at order @xmath94 .",

    "the @xmath100 contribution does not exist , and hence the @xmath101 zerilli function will vanish at linear order .    with these fully nonlinear numerical solutions and perturbative expansions",
    "we are in a position to extract and analyze initial data for the zerilli evolution equation ( and for the full 2d nonlinear evolution code ) , which is the topic of the next section .      in this section",
    "we discuss specific examples of the extraction procedure applied to the axisymmetric black hole initial data sets discussed above . here",
    "we focus on the extraction of initial data itself , not on the evolution .",
    "we use the exact analytic solution to the perturbative initial data equations as an aid to evaluating and understanding the numerically extracted initial data from the full nonlinear solution to the hamiltonian constraint .",
    "there are two main variations on the extraction of initial data that we compare and contrast in this section :    \\(a ) we compute the gauge - invariant functions @xmath102 numerically , by computing numerical integrals over 2spheres according to the procedure outlined above and in appendix  [ app : extraction_formulae ] .",
    "\\(b ) we can use the exact perturbative solution to calculate _ analytically _ the gauge - invariant variable denoted by @xmath103 , which we obtain by linearizing about the spherically symmetric background , and then constructing the variables as if the background was schwarzschild .",
    "this follows the spirit of the general numerical procedure described above , and is the solution to which we expect to converge with the complete numerical procedure .",
    "this exact solution is too lengthy to be reproduced here , but can be obtained straightforwardly with a computer algebra package .",
    "we note that we can also use the exact solution to the perturbation expansion to calculate a gauge - invariant variable , which results from linearizing the spacetime about the background mass @xmath2 schwarzschild spacetime .",
    "this is not quite the same as the wave @xmath103 obtained by linearizing about the more general spherical background .",
    "this is due to two effects .",
    "first , the individual metric perturbation functions , such as defined via eq .",
    "( [ eq : h2 ] ) above , are computed on a more different spherical background than schwarzschild second , the brill wave introduces the presence of a non - zero coefficients @xmath89 in the expansion  ( [ eqn : expansion ] ) , which is reflected in the definition of the mass defined in eq .",
    "( [ eq : mass ] ) .",
    "the difference between the two waveforms is @xmath104 .",

    "were constructed on a 2d grid in @xmath105 coordinates ( keeping only those terms linear in the brill wave parameter @xmath63 ) .",

    "we will see in the next section that even in cases such as these where the linear study deviates significantly from the nonlinear extraction , the linear evolution can still do a reasonably good job in predicting the results of the full nonlinear evolution far from the black hole .",
    "the key reason for this seems to be that the nonlinearities of these particular datasets are largest well inside the peak of the potential barrier , and hence they are kept inside and propagate down the black hole .",

    "we have demonstrated that our extraction method is accurate by comparisons with known linear solutions , and shown that the nonlinear initial data sets , parameterized by the brill wave parameter @xmath63 , yield initial waveforms which agree closely with the known linear solution for small @xmath63 . in the next section we turn to evolutions of these numerically extracted linear initial data sets .",

    "one must be careful in comparing waveforms measured with different time coordinates . since the nonlinear evolution implements a general slicing condition ( in these examples an algebraic slicing ) , and not the schwarzschild slicing used in the linear evolution , it could happen that corrections would be needed to account for the differences in slicing .",
    "however , in our simulations the slicings are similar enough in the regions where the waves are computed that this is only a very small effect , as is borne out by the figures .",
    "for all the results shown here , both for the linear and nonlinear evolutions , the accuracy of the results were carefully studied , to be sure that any differences between the nonlinear and linear waveforms is due only to the different initial data or the mode of evolution .",
    "this is particularly important to ensure that the observed modes are not due to insufficient resolution or boundary effects .",
    "first , we discuss the evolutions corresponding to the axisymmetric initial data sets specified by @xmath88 , @xmath76 , for a range of brill wave amplitudes @xmath63 . for the exact linear initial data described in sec .",

    "[ ext3d_1 ] .",

    ", these modes should _ not _ agree with full nonlinear evolutions .",
    "building on previous work ( e.g. ,  @xcite ) we have further developed the use of perturbation theory as a tool for numerical relativity .",
    "we presented techniques for studying single , distorted black holes without net angular momentum , using the perturbative regge - wheeler and zerilli equations .",
    "these techniques include extracting initial data , decomposed into different @xmath83 modes , from a numerically computed black hole initial data set , and evolving these modes forward in time with the perturbation equations .",
    "these results can then be used both to perform a powerful check on the accuracy of fully nonlinear evolution codes , from which waveforms can be extracted , and to help untangle linear and nonlinear effects , such as mode - mixing , of the full evolution .",
    "we applied this technique to a series of distorted black holes , using the `` brill wave plus black hole '' family of initial data sets  @xcite .",
    "these data sets have adjustable parameters for the shape and amplitude of the initial distortions , and have been well studied previously and found to mimic the behavior of two black holes that have just collided head - on .",
    "they have a further nice property that an analytic solution to the initial value problem is possible if the brill wave amplitude is small .",
    "this information was used both to test the accuracy of the perturbative initial data extraction techniques , and to understand the spectral decomposition of both the linear and _ nonlinear _ contributions to the initial data .",
    "we then performed a series of axisymmetric , fully nonlinear supercomputer evolutions of the full initial data sets , and compared gravitational radiation waveforms extracted from these simulations to results obtained via our perturbative techniques using the zerilli equation .",
    "we find that for initial data sets containing @xmath114 modes that can be shown to be _ linear _ in the wave amplitude parameter , the extracted waveforms from the full nonlinear evolutions show excellent agreement with the perturbatively evolved waveforms , confirming both the very high degree of accuracy that can be achieved with axisymmetric codes and the linear perturbation code and approach to the problem .",
    "however , we also find that some modes computed with the nonlinear simulation code do _ not _ agree with the linearized treatment ; in some cases the linear evolution can give very different results from the full nonlinear evolution for specific modes , even when other modes agree well .",
    "but in all such cases , one can see from analytic study of the initial data that it is precisely these `` renegade '' modes that show up at a _ nonlinear _ order in the wave amplitude parameter .",
    "their perturbative evolution equations should then be extended to second order , with nonlinear source terms ( composed of linear modes ) coming in . in effect , such modes are _ too small _ to be treated by linear theory , since nonlinear contributions from other modes are relatively large enough not to be neglected .",
    "hence one can see clearly the effects of mode - mode coupling in these cases .",
    "the combination of linearized treatment and perturbative treatment was essential not only to confirm the nonlinear code , but also to interpret the complex nature of the numerical results .",
    "furthermore , we pointed out that the use of linear waveform extraction techniques should be studied further for systems that may contain modes only at higher , nonlinear order .    another important point",
    "to mention is the role that the potential barrier plays in the evolution of these distorted black holes .",
    "the application of perturbation theory to the evolution of these distorted black holes often works well , even in cases where one can see large deviation between linear and nonlinear treatment in the initial data .",
    "but in such cases , the error made by using a linear approximation is largest _ inside _ the peak of the potential barrier , and hence most of this nonlinearity is swallowed by the black hole .",
    "hence , as has also been stressed in previous work  @xcite , the potential barrier acts to trap much of the deviation from linear behavior , extending the range of applicability of perturbative treatment over what one might naively expect .",
    "finally , we also applied this technique to study a new class of 3d distorted black hole initial data sets  @xcite , and we showed that the initial data can be extracted accurately for study in 3d , just as in axisymmetry .",
    "the comparison of evolutions of such 3d distorted black hole initial data between full nonlinear numerical relativity and perturbation theory will be the subject of the next paper in this series .    in this paper",
    "we have only considered examples of time symmetric , even - parity perturbations of non - rotating black holes .",
    "the technique is much more general , and also applies to all even- and odd - parity modes , and to non - time symmetric initial data , which will be considered in future papers in this series .",
    "the data sets developed in ref.@xcite also contain distorted black hole initial data with angular momentum .",
