    "one way of analyzing phase transitions is to study the zeros of @xmath17 when @xmath6 and/or @xmath12 are treated as _ complex",

    "if we set all the edge weights @xmath14 equal to the same value @xmath18 , we obtain a two - variable polynomial @xmath19 that is essentially equivalent to the standard tutte polynomial @xmath20 [ see section  [ subsec.tutte ] for details ] .",
    "but the main message of this paper is that it is often useful to consider the multivariate polynomial @xmath17 , even if one is ultimately interested in a particular two - variable or one - variable specialization .",
    "for instance , @xmath17 is in the variables @xmath21 ( i.e. , of degree 1 in each @xmath14 separately ) ; often a multiaffine polynomial in many variables is easier to handle than a general polynomial in a single variable ( e.g. , it may permit simple proofs by induction on the number of variables ) .",
    "furthermore , many natural operations on graphs , such as the reduction of edges in series or parallel , lead out of the class of `` all @xmath14 equal '' .",
    "i  shall illustrate the advantages of this `` multivariate ideology '' by showing several instances in which the multivariate extension of a single - variable result is not only vastly more powerful but also much _ easier _ to prove : indeed , in one case , a 20-page proof is reduced to a few lines .",
    "all of these considerations can be extended from graphs to matroids : if @xmath1 is a matroid with ground set @xmath4 and rank function @xmath22 , its multivariate tutte polynomial is defined by @xmath23 which is a polynomial in @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "this extends the graph definition in the sense that if @xmath0 is a graph and @xmath24 is its cycle matroid , then @xmath25 [ because @xmath26 .",
    "since a matroid is completely determined by its rank function , @xmath27 is simply an algebraic encoding of _ all _ the information about the matroid @xmath1 .",
    "moreover , my earlier statement that @xmath13 encodes `` a vast amount '' of information about the graph @xmath0 can now be made more precise : @xmath13 encodes the number of vertices @xmath28 together with all the information about @xmath0 that is contained in its cycle matroid @xmath24 [ and no other information ] .",
    "i  am now convinced that matroids are the natural category for studying the multivariate tutte polynomial .",

    "first , a trivial but useful observation : starting from the definition @xmath29 and using the simple relation @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the cyclomatic number ( i.e. , number of linearly independent cycles ) of the graph @xmath9 , we can rewrite @xmath13 in the alternate form @xmath32    [ sec.potts.defs.trees ] _ trees . _ for any tree @xmath33 we have @xmath34 this follows immediately from , using the fact that @xmath35 for all @xmath36 .",

    "we usually consider @xmath14 to be a real or complex variable .    in statistical physics",
    ", this formula arises as follows : in the potts model @xcite , an `` atom '' ( or `` spin '' ) at the site @xmath52 can exist in any one of @xmath6 different states .",
    "the _ energy _ of a configuration is the sum , over all edges @xmath53 , of @xmath54 if the spins at the two endpoints of that edge are unequal and @xmath55 if they are equal .",
    "the _ boltzmann weight _ of a configuration is then @xmath56 , where @xmath57 is the energy of the configuration and @xmath58 is the inverse temperature .",
    "the _ partition function _ is the sum , over all configurations , of their boltzmann weights .",
    "clearly this is just a rephrasing of , with @xmath59 . a coupling @xmath60 ( or @xmath14 )",

    "it is far from obvious that @xmath66 , which is defined separately for each positive integer @xmath6 , is in fact the restriction to @xmath67 of a _ polynomial _ in @xmath6 .",
    "but this is in fact the case , and indeed we have :    [ thm.fk ]    for integer @xmath68 , @xmath69 that is , the potts - model partition function is simply the specialization of the multivariate tutte polynomial to @xmath67 .    in , expand out the product over @xmath53 , and let @xmath70 be the set of edges for which the term @xmath71 is taken .",
    "now perform the sum over configurations @xmath72 : in each component of the subgraph @xmath9 the color @xmath47 must be constant , and there are no other constraints .",
    "therefore , @xmath73 as was to be proved .",
    "the subgraph expansion of the potts - model partition function was discovered in the late 1960s by fortuin and kasteleyn @xcite .",
    "it was discovered many decades earlier by birkhoff @xcite and whitney @xcite ; see also tutte @xcite . ]",
    "please note that if @xmath74 and @xmath62 for all @xmath15 , then the weights in are nonnegative , and so can be interpreted probabilistically ( after normalization by @xmath13 ) .",
    "the resulting probability measure on @xmath75 is called the @xcite for the graph @xmath0 . furthermore , for @xmath67 a natural joint probability measure on spin states and edge occupations [ i.e. , a coupling of and ] has been given by edwards and sokal @xcite ; it underlies the swendsen ",
    "wang @xcite monte carlo algorithm for the ferromagnetic potts model , and is also useful in the rigorous analysis of the potts model .",
    "another important special case arises when @xmath76 for all edges @xmath15 : then @xmath77 gives weight 1 to each proper coloring and weight 0 to each improper coloring , and so counts the proper colorings .",
    "it follows from theorem  [ thm.fk ] that the number of proper @xmath6-colorings of @xmath0 is in fact the restriction to @xmath67 of a polynomial in @xmath6 , called the @xmath78 .",
    "the chromatic polynomial thus corresponds to the zero - temperature ( @xmath79 ) limit of the antiferromagnetic ( @xmath80 ) potts model .",
    "many properties of the chromatic polynomial in fact extend to the entire antiferromagnetic region ( i.e. , @xmath64 for all @xmath15 ) .",
    "let us now consider the different ways in which a meaningful @xmath81 limit can be taken in the @xmath6-state potts model .",
    "the simplest limit is to take @xmath81 with fixed @xmath21 . from the definition",
    "we see that this selects out the subgraphs @xmath70 having the smallest possible number of connected components ; the minimum achievable value is of course @xmath82 itself (= 1 in case @xmath0 is connected ) .",
    "we therefore have @xmath83 where @xmath84 is the generating polynomial of `` maximally connected spanning subgraphs '' (= in case @xmath0 is connected ) .",
    "a different limit can be obtained by taking @xmath81 with fixed values of @xmath85 . from we",
    "see that this selects out the subgraphs @xmath70 having the smallest possible cyclomatic number ; the minimum achievable value is of course 0 .",
    "we therefore have @xcite @xmath86 where @xmath87 is the generating polynomial of _ spanning forests_.    finally , suppose that in @xmath88 we replace each edge weight @xmath14 by @xmath89 and then take @xmath90 .",
    "this obviously selects out , from among the maximally connected spanning subgraphs , those having the fewest edges : these are precisely the maximal spanning forests (= in case @xmath0 is connected ) , and they all have exactly @xmath91 edges .",
    "hence @xmath92 where @xmath93 is the generating polynomial of maximal spanning forests . and",
    "the tutte polynomial @xmath20 .",

    "trees_. ] alternatively , suppose that in @xmath96 we replace each edge weight @xmath97 by @xmath98 and then take @xmath99 .",
    "this obviously selects out , from among the spanning forests , those having the greatest number of edges : these are once again the maximal spanning forests .",
    "hence @xmath100 in summary , we have the following scheme for the @xmath81 limits of the multivariate tutte polynomial : @xmath101 finally , maximal spanning forests (= spanning trees in case @xmath0 is connected ) can also be obtained directly from @xmath102 by a one - step process in which the limit @xmath81 is taken at fixed @xmath103 , where @xmath104 @xcite .",
    "indeed , simple manipulation of and yields @xmath105 the quantity @xmath106 is minimized on ( and only on ) maximal spanning forests , where it takes the value @xmath107 .",
    "hence @xmath108      let @xmath2 be a finite undirected graph , and let @xmath109 be a finite abelian group of order @xmath110 .",
    "let us choose arbitrarily an orientation for each edge of @xmath0 ( all subsequent results will be independent of this choice ) .",

    "furthermore , it turns out that @xmath115 is the restriction to @xmath116 of a polynomial in @xmath6 , called the of @xmath0 and also written @xmath115 .    in order to prove these facts ( and much more ) ,",
    "let us generalize @xmath114 as follows : assign to each edge @xmath53 a weight @xmath117 , and write @xmath118 . then define @xmath119     \\ ; ,   \\label{eq.sec.flowpoly.1}\\ ] ] where the sum runs over all @xmath109-flows @xmath112 on @xmath0 .",
    "if we take @xmath120 for all @xmath15 , this reduces to our friend @xmath114 .",

    "the tutte notation _ makes it impossible _ to assign unequal weights @xmath14 to the edges .",
    "i  therefore recommend use of the notation @xmath102 whenever the `` multivariate ideology '' is potentially of use .",
    "let me conclude by observing that numerous specific evaluations of the tutte polynomial have been given combinatorial interpretations , as counting some set of objects associated to the graph @xmath0 ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "it would be an interesting project to seek to extend these counting problems to `` counting with weights '' , i.e. , to obtain suitably defined univariate or multivariate generating polynomials for the objects in question as specializations of @xmath19 or @xmath102 , respectively .",
    "a few examples of this are given in sections  [ subsec.q0 ] and [ subsec.flow ] above .",
    "many ( but not all ) of the properties of the multivariate tutte polynomial for graphs can be carried over to the matroid version .",
    "where the treatment is essentially identical , i shall be brief .",
    "[ [ section-1 ] ]    when @xmath43 , the multivariate tutte polynomial becomes trivial : @xmath147    [ [ section-2 ] ]    for _ graphs _ , we saw in section  [ subsec.fk.graphs ] that the multivariate tutte polynomial @xmath102 for integer @xmath68 counts @xmath6-colorings of the vertices of @xmath0 , with weights that depend on whether each edge @xmath15 is properly or improperly colored [ cf",
    ".  / ] . in particular ,",
    "the chromatic polynomial @xmath78 counts proper @xmath6-colorings of @xmath0 .",
    "one consequence of this is that the nonnegative integer zeros of @xmath148 are consecutive integers , namely @xmath149 , where @xmath150 is the chromatic number of @xmath0 .",
    ", as it is easy to show that @xmath148 has no negative real zeros ( when @xmath0 is loopless ) : see e.g.  @xcite . ]",
    "simple examples show that the latter property does not hold in general for the chromatic polynomial ( also known as ) of a matroid , @xmath151 .",

    "it therefore seems unlikely that @xmath158 can be given a `` coloring '' interpretation for _ arbitrary _ matroids @xmath1 and _ arbitrary _ integers @xmath68 .",
    "nevertheless , in some special cases such a representation can be given , as i would now like to sketch ; this account is drawn from work in progress with sergio caracciolo and andrea sportiello @xcite .",

    "moreover , as a corollary of the failure of the multivariate brown  colbourn conjecture for the complete graph @xmath534 , royle and i are able to show @xcite that the univariate conjecture is false as well : counterexamples include a 4-vertex , 16-edge planar graph that can be obtained from @xmath534 by adding parallel edges , and a 1512-vertex , 3016-edge simple planar graph that can be obtained from @xmath534 by adding parallel edges and then subdividing edges .",

    "of course , the constant 7.963907 is an artifact of the proof ; it is presumably far from sharp .",
    "the linear dependence on @xmath372 is , however , best possible , since the complete graph @xmath621 has chromatic roots @xmath622 .",
    "furthermore ( and perhaps surprisingly ) , the complete graph @xmath621 is _ not _ the extremal graph for this problem , and a bound @xmath623 is _ not _ possible .",
    "in fact , a non - rigorous ( but probably rigorizable ) asymptotic analysis , confirmed by numerical calculations , shows @xcite that the complete bipartite graph @xmath624 has a chromatic root @xmath625 , where @xmath626 ; here @xmath627 denotes the principal branch of the lambert @xmath627 function ( the inverse function of @xmath628 ) @xcite .",
    "so the constant in corollary  [ cor.sokal ] can not be better than @xmath629 .",
    "it is immediately apparent that theorem  [ thm.sokal ] and corollary  [ cor.sokal ] are `` hard '' results in the sense of section  [ sec.complex ] : the zero - free region depends on the maximum degree @xmath372 .",
    "the proof of these results follows the plan sketched there : namely , the multivariate tutte polynomial on the graph @xmath38 is first mapped onto a gas of nonoverlapping `` polymers '' on @xmath3 , i.e.  a hard - core lattice gas on the intersection graph of @xmath3 ; then this hard - core lattice gas is controlled by means of the theorems mentioned at the end of section  [ sec.complex ] .",
    "the mapping to a polymer gas is really quite simple ; indeed , it is nearly trivial .",
    "the definition writes the multivariate tutte polynomial @xmath630 as a sum over spanning subgraphs @xmath9 .",
    "let us perform this sum in two stages : first we sum over partitions of @xmath3 into disjoint nonempty subsets @xmath631 ( @xmath632 arbitrary ) ; these subsets will correspond to the vertex sets of the connected components of @xmath9",
    ". then we sum over the ways of choosing edges within each component so as to make it connected . from",
    "we see that a component @xmath633 will get a weight          where @xmath634 denotes the induced subgraph .",
    "note , in particular , that ( provided @xmath0 is loopless ) any set @xmath382 of cardinality 1 gets weight @xmath635 .",
    "so we need not consider such sets explicitly : it suffices to define the `` polymers '' to be the sets @xmath636 of cardinality 2 or more ; we then know that any vertex not covered by a polymer must be covered by a set @xmath636 of cardinality 1 .",
    "the polymers are therefore an arbitrary family ( possibly empty ) of disjoint sets @xmath637 of cardinality 2 or more .",
    "we have thus written @xmath630 as an independent - set polynomial (= hard - core lattice gas ) of the form for a graph @xmath638 whose vertices are the subsets of @xmath3 of cardinality 2 or more , and whose edges are the pairs with nonempty intersection .",
    "the fugacities are given by .",
    "the usefulness of this representation for proving the absence of zeros at large @xmath614 comes from the fact that the fugacities @xmath639 are all suppressed by powers of @xmath11 ( since @xmath640 ) , hence are small for large @xmath614 .",
    "furthermore , this suppression operates more strongly for larger polymers .",
    "this raises the hope that , when @xmath614 is sufficiently large , the model lies in a `` low - fugacity '' regime where the methods mentioned in section  [ sec.complex ] can be brought to bear .",
    "this is in fact the case .    of course",
    ", i  have sloughed over one crucial point : the sum over @xmath178 in .",
    "it is here , not surprisingly , that the maximum degree @xmath372 enters ( along with @xmath641 ) .",
    "what one needs , it turns out , is a bound on the number of connected subgraphs @xmath642 containing a specified vertex @xmath145 and having a specified number of vertices @xmath643 .",
    "what is easier to prove , however , is a bound on the number of connected subgraphs @xmath642 containing a specified vertex @xmath145 and having a specified number of _ edges _ ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 4.2 ) @xcite .",
    "the relation between the two is far from obvious , but it turns out that in the complex antiferromagnetic region @xmath617 ( and only there ! ) , a beautiful inequality due to oliver penrose @xcite allows connected subgraphs to be bounded by _",
    "trees_. the upshot is that the sum over @xmath178 in can be controlled , with the result that @xmath639 satisfies a uniform bound that is exponentially decaying in @xmath644 , provided that @xmath614 is large enough compared to @xmath372 .",
    "this suffices to ensure the convergence of the `` polymer expansion '' , and hence the nonvanishing of @xmath630 .",
    "i  believe it should be possible to extend this result beyond the complex antiferromagnetic regime , by bounding directly the number of connected subgraphs having a specified number of vertices @xcite .",
    "but the resulting bound on @xmath614 will no longer be linear in @xmath372 and @xmath641 ; rather , it will behave roughly like @xmath645 . and",

    "the bounds obtained from theorem  [ thm.sokal ] and its variants are sometimes very far from sharp : for instance , a tree can have arbitrarily large @xmath372 and @xmath652 , but its chromatic roots are only 0 and 1 ! of course , this defect can be cured by the _ ad  hoc _ technique of applying theorem  [ thm.sokal ] ff .   to each block of @xmath0 rather than directly to @xmath0 . but",
    "the deeper significance of this remark is that the quantities @xmath372 and @xmath652 are _ unnatural _ for studying the multivariate tutte polynomial because they are _ not matroidal_.    one would like , therefore , to find a graph invariant that is smaller than @xmath372 and @xmath652 , that `` trivializes over blocks '' ( and ideally generalizes to matroids ) , and that is strong enough to bound the roots of @xmath148 and @xmath102 .",
    "i  have a candidate : it is the _ maxmaxflow _ @xcite , defined as follows : for @xmath659 with @xmath278 , let @xmath660 be the max flow from @xmath145 to @xmath146 :      the _ maxmaxflow _",
    "@xmath661 is then defined by @xmath662 [ note the contrast with the edge - connectivity , which is the _ minimum _ of @xmath660 over @xmath278 . ] clearly @xmath663 $ ] , so that @xmath664 furthermore , it is easy to see that maxmaxflow `` trivializes over blocks '' in the sense that @xmath665 where @xmath666 are the blocks of @xmath0 .",
    "an apparently very different quantity can be defined via cocycle bases . for",
    "@xmath667 disjoint subsets of @xmath3 , let @xmath668 denote the set of edges in @xmath0 between @xmath669 and @xmath670 .",
    "a of @xmath0 is a set @xmath671 where @xmath672 and @xmath673 .",
    "it is well - known that the cocycles of @xmath0 form a vector space over @xmath674 with respect to symmetric difference ; this is called the of @xmath0 .",
    "let @xmath675 be the minmax cardinality of the cocycles in a basis , i.e. @xmath676 where the min runs over all bases @xmath677 of the cocycle space of @xmath0 , and the max runs over all the cocycles @xmath678 in the basis @xmath677 .",
    "since one special class of cocycle bases consists of taking the stars @xmath679 for all but one of the vertices in each component of @xmath0 , we clearly have @xmath680    the relationship , if any , between maxmaxflow and cocycle bases is perhaps not obvious at first sight .",
    "but bill jackson and i have proven @xcite that @xmath681 the two definitions thus give dual approaches to the same quantity .",
    "all this theory , extends in fact , to the more general situation of a finite undirected graph @xmath0 equipped with nonnegative real edge weights @xmath682 .",
    "( in the application to the multivariate tutte polynomial , one might want to take @xmath683 or something similar . )",
    "the ultimate goal of this work is to prove ( or disprove ! )",
    "strengthenings of theorem  [ thm.sokal ] ff .   in which maximum degree or second - largest degree are replaced by maxmaxflow . for instance , for",
    "chromatic polynomials one would like to prove the following :    [ conj.chrom.1 ] there exist universal constants @xmath684 such that all the chromatic roots ( real or complex ) of all loopless graphs of maxmaxflow @xmath471 lie in the disc @xmath685 .",
    "indeed , i conjecture that @xmath686 can be taken to be linear in @xmath471 .",
    "it is natural to try to prove conjecture  [ conj.chrom.1 ] by modifying the arguments of @xcite so as to decompose a spanning subgraph of @xmath0 into its _ 2-connected _ ( rather than merely _ connected _ ) components .",
    "such an argument will require , at a minimum , a good bound on the number of 2-connected subgraphs @xmath642 containing a specified edge @xmath15 and having a specified number of vertices or edges .",
    "bill jackson and i have found some bounds of this type @xcite .",
    "but this is only a first step , and the other obstacles in generalizing this proof  such as controlling the interaction between the 2-connected components  have yet to be overcome .",
    "it is worth mentioning that @xmath687 can be defined also for binary matroids , generalizing the definition for graphs .",
    "but we do not yet know whether it is strong enough to give a good ( i.e. , singly exponential ) bound on the number of 2-connected deletion minors containing a specified element @xmath15 and having a specified size . nor do we know whether it is useful in bounding the zeros of the matroid chromatic polynomial @xmath688 .",
    "there is no compelling reason , _ a priori _ , to limit attention in the complex @xmath6-plane to discs centered at the origin ; many other types of regions are of interest .",
    "for instance , the following conjecture might conceivably be true :          since the truth of conjecture  [ conj.chrom.3 ] would imply that @xmath148 has all nonnegative taylor coefficients at @xmath691 , and since @xmath148 is not identically zero ( when @xmath0 is loopless ) , conjecture  [ conj.chrom.3 ] would imply :      even the weaker versions of these conjectures with @xmath471 replaced by @xmath652 or @xmath372 are open !",
    "so one has the @xmath695 matrix of conjectures @xmath696 in which the strongest might well be true and the weakest is still an open question . and [ conj.chrom.2]@xmath697 .",
    "his graphs are planar ( but not series - parallel ) and all vertices but one have degree 3 ( hence @xmath698 ) . included in his family",
    "are a 47-vertex graph with chromatic roots @xmath699 , a 95-vertex graph with chromatic roots @xmath700 , a 191-vertex graph with chromatic roots @xmath701 , and a 383-vertex graph with chromatic roots @xmath702 . ] it might be useful to seek counterexamples , either by systematic calculation on small graphs up to @xmath703 vertices or , perhaps more fruitfully , by constructing suitable infinite families of graphs .",
    "it goes without saying that i  have no idea how to prove any of these conjectures , or even any compelling reason to believe they are true ( other than my inability thus far to find counterexamples )",
    ".    we can pose these questions most generally as follows : let @xmath167 be a class of finite graphs , and let @xmath704 be a subset of the complex plane",
    ". then we can ask about the sets @xmath705     s_2({{\\mathcal{g } } } , { { \\mathcal{v } } } )    & = &        \\bigcup_{g \\in { { \\mathcal{g } } } } \\ ;        \\bigcup _ { { { \\bf v } } \\colon v_e \\in { { \\mathcal{v}}}\\ ; \\forall e }        \\{q \\in { { \\mathbb c}}\\colon\\ ;   z_g(q , { { \\bf v } } ) \\,=\\ , 0 \\}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] among the interesting cases are the chromatic polynomials @xmath706 , the antiferromagnetic regime @xmath707 $ ] , and the complex antiferromagnetic regime @xmath708 .",
    "the theorems discussed in this section show that the sets @xmath709 and @xmath710 are _ bounded _ , where @xmath711 ( resp .",
    "@xmath712 ) is the set of all graphs whose maximum degree ( resp .",
    "second - largest degree ) is less than or equal to @xmath203 .",
    "but boundedness is a rather weak statement about a set ; one would like to learn more about its location in the complex plane .    in the other direction ,",
    "i  have recently shown @xcite that if @xmath167 is the family of all generalized theta graphs @xmath656 @xcite , then @xmath713 is dense in the region @xmath657 .",
    "moreover , if @xmath714 denotes the family of joins of @xmath656 with the complete graph @xmath715 , then @xmath716 is dense in the entire complex plane . and",
    "@xmath57 , denoted @xmath717 , is the graph obtained from the disjoint union of @xmath0 and @xmath57 by adding one edge connecting each pair of vertices @xmath718 , @xmath719 .",
    "] the idea of the construction in @xcite is to exploit the reduction formulae of section  [ subsec.2-rooted ] : suitably chosen 2-rooted subgraphs ( in this case single edges ) are concatenated in order to create a larger 2-rooted subgraph that has some desired value of the effective coupling @xmath720 .",
    "such a construction is obviously inapplicable to 3-connected graphs , in which 2-rooted subgraphs of more than a single edge can not occur .",
    "it is thus reasonable to ask : what is the closure of the set of chromatic roots of _ 3-connected _ graphs ?",
    "the answer , alas , is still the whole complex plane @xcite . to see this ,",
    "consider the graphs @xmath721 for fixed @xmath430 and varying @xmath722 : they are @xmath723-connected , and their chromatic roots ( taken together ) are dense in the region @xmath724 .",
    "in particular , considering both @xmath430 and @xmath725 , the chromatic roots are dense in the whole complex plane .",
    "so even arbitrarily high connectedness does not , by itself , stop the chromatic roots from being dense in the whole complex plane .        here",
    "the answer may well be much smaller than @xmath462 or @xmath728 .",
    "but it will not be a bounded set @xcite , since the bipyramids @xmath729 are 4-connected plane triangulations , but their chromatic roots are unbounded @xcite .",
    "the ultimate goal of this research is to prove theorems of the type `` such - and - such graph property ( or conjunction of properties ) implies such - and - such bound on the chromatic roots '' .",
    "but there is a virtually unlimited number of possible assertions of this type ; the hard part is to figure out which ones are true !    there is thus , in my opinion , much room for numerical experiment as a means for obtaining intuition about which graph properties ( e.g.  maximum degree and its relatives , girth , planarity , connectivity ,  ) affect which aspects of the chromatic roots ( e.g.  large positive real roots , large positive or negative real part , large imaginary part , etc . ) .",
    "some information can be obtained by systematic calculation on all graphs of a specified type up to as many vertices as can be handled  or , for suitable classes ( e.g.  cubic graphs ) , by random generation of typical graphs with a rather larger number of vertices  in an attempt to correlate properties of the graph with properties of the chromatic roots .",
    "guided by this information , one may then choose to focus on special classes of graphs that potentially exhibit some type of `` extremal '' behavior , and either pursue the numerical calculation to larger graphs or , better yet , find infinite families of graphs that exhibit such `` extremal '' behavior and for which one can compute exactly the asymptotic behavior of the chromatic roots .",
    "it is important to keep in mind that many asymptotic properties of chromatic roots are achieved very slowly as the number of vertices grows : for instance , the roots of cubic graphs move quite slowly towards negative real part @xcite , and the roots of the generalized theta graphs @xmath656 fill out the complex plane extremely slowly as @xmath730 @xcite . as a result , numerical experiments can be deceptive unless interpreted with extreme care .",
    "it is for this reason that exact computations with well - chosen infinite families of graphs are particularly valuable ."
