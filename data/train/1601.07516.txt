    "when one considers a universe following the standard einstein cosmology , that is , when the dynamics of the universe is described by the general relativity equations , one deduces that there exists a mysterious singularity at the beginning of time , so called big bang .",
    "this singularity may be considered as a deficiency of einstein cosmology at high energies @xcite .",
    "actually , one can assert that the big bang implies the breakdown of general relativity at scales with high energies , whereas we know from the observational evidences , such as the existence of the cosmic microwave background , that the big bang model works at scales lower than planck energy scale . at these scales ,",
    "the universe was full of a hot photon - baryon combination almost described by a radiation fluid .",
    "this hot combination was cooling down as the universe was experiencing the expansion , and due to the different scaling behaviors of pure radiation and pure matter , the energy density of non - relativistic matter started to dominate over the energy density of radiation and led to the formation of structures .",
    "loop quantum gravity ( lqg ) is one of the potential candidates for the study of quantum gravity @xcite .",
    "homogenous and isotropic space time , reduces loop quantum gravity ( lqg ) to loop quantum cosmology ( lqc ) @xcite . according to this theory , due to the effective quantum gravitational effects",
    ", the big bounce happens to remove the big bang singularity , after which a super - inflation phase occurs , and then the universe enters a normal inflation regime @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the loop quantum cosmology effects manifest themselves in a new effective form of modified friedmann equation .",
    "these effective equations have been derived in the literature for flrw loop quantum cosmologies considering different matter sectors at early universe @xcite .",
    "an extended scenario of the matter bounce cosmology , considering a single scalar field with an approximately exponential potential , was proposed as an alternative to the slow roll inflation , in the context of ( lqc ) , in which the universe has experienced a quasi - matter contracting phase with a variable equation of state parameter @xcite .",
    "this matter bounce scenario , in the teleparallel version of ( lqc ) , was shown to be in good agreement with the new bicep2 data @xcite .",
    "a gauss - bonnet extension of ( lqc ) , by introducing holonomy corrections in modified @xmath0 theories of gravity was also developed where the authors have provided a perturbative expansion in the critical density as well as a parameter characteristic of ( lqg ) , and obtained leading order corrections to the classical @xmath0 theories of gravity .",
    "they also presented a reconstruction method which makes possible to find the ( lqc ) corrected @xmath0 theory capable of realizing various cosmological scenarios @xcite . in another work , in order to avoid singularities of @xmath1 model , holonomy corrections to this model were introduced in einstein frame and a detailed analytical and numerical study was performed when holonomy corrections are taken into account in both jordan and einstein frames .",
    "they obtained , in jordan frame , a dynamics which is different qualitatively , from the one of the original model , at early times . according to this dynamics",
    ", the universe is not singular , neither at early times in the contracting phase , nor at bouncing to enter in the new expanding inflationary phase .",
    "this dynamics may lead to better predictions for the inflationary phase in comparison to the current observations @xcite .",
    "motivated by the above mentioned success of ( lqc ) in describing the very early stage of inflationary universe , we are encouraged to study the evolution of universe after the inflationary era and investigate the possible establishment of a specific kind of dark matter ( see below ) and study its contribution in the subsequent evolution of the universe .",
    "explicitly , we assume that after inflation the universe includes ordinary dark matter ( bosonic particles ) , dark energy , radiation and baryonic matter , and that the ordinary dark matter component in the sufficiently cooled universe has gone through a phase transition provided by the bose - einstein condensation , which might have happened during the early stages of cosmological evolution of the universe with a low temperature comparable to the critical temperature for bose - einstein condensation @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the particle mass , @xmath4 is the particle density and @xmath5 is boltzmann s constant @xcite-@xcite .",
    "particularly , in the bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) model , the dark matter can be described as a non - relativistic newtonian gravitational condensate , whose pressure and energy density are related by a barotropic equation of state .",
    "based on the above arguments , we assume the possibility that the bose - einstein condensation might have happened during the early stages of cosmological evolution of the universe with a temperature comparable to the critical temperature for bose - einstein condensation @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the particle mass , @xmath4 is the particle density and @xmath5 is boltzmann s constant @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the modification of cosmological evolution of the early universe , in the presence of condensate dark matter in standard cosmology , has already been studied in @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we generalize this model from standard cosmology to lqc .",
    "the organization of the present paper is as follows . in section",
    "@xmath6 we outline the modification of friedmann equations in lqc model and the basic properties of the normal and bec dark matter in addition to the presentation of the relevant physical quantities and the equation of state . in section",
    "@xmath7 we give a brief explanation about the cosmological dynamics of the bose - einstein condensate .",
    "next , we introduce the numerical values of the cosmological parameters at the condensation point , and then obtain the important @xmath8 parameter as a volume fraction of matter in the bose - einstein condensed phase which explains the evolution of the dark matter energy density during the transition process , and extract the order of bec time interval in lqc model . in the following , we study the post condensation phase in lqc model describing the evolution of the scale factor parameter under the effect of the existence of the bec dark matter in lqc .",
    "the paper ends with a conclusion .",
    "in this section , we intend to review the bose - einstein condensation and explore the dynamics of the condensation and some of the relevant cosmological implications .",
    "we consider the line element of the flat friedmann - robertson walker metric @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the scale factor presenting the cosmological expansion .",
    "we describe the matter by the perfect fluid energy momentum tensor , @xmath11 where ( @xmath12 , @xmath13 ) stands for ( @xmath14 , @xmath15 ) , ( @xmath16 , @xmath17 ) , and ( @xmath18 , @xmath19 ) for baryonic matter , radiation and dark matter , respectively .",
    "note that we do not consider the interaction between these energy terms , in other words the energy of these components are individually satisfying the conservation equation .",
    "+   + taking into account the well - known loop quantum gravity constraints and coupling the matter to classical phase space of flrw universe , we obtain @xcite @xmath20 @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the matter hamiltonian , @xmath23@xcite represents the barbero - immirzi parameter and also @xmath24 is the length gap .",
    "meanwhile , @xmath25 is the conjugate momentum and @xmath26 is proportional to the physical volume of a cubical cell , with unit comoving volume @xmath27 .",
    "it is noticeable that dot means derivative with respect to the time . by rewriting the equations ( [ eq4 ] ) and ( [ eq5 ] )",
    ", we have @xmath28 @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the hubble parameter and the matter density is limited as @xmath31 where @xmath32 .",
    "combination of ( [ eq6 ] ) and ( [ eq7 ] ) reduces to the modified flrw equation in loop quantum cosmology model @xcite @xmath33 as we mentioned , the effective equations have been derived for flrw loop quantum cosmologies considering different matter sectors at early universe",
    "so , we may use the modified flrw equation in loop quantum cosmology model , namely eq.([eq8 ] ) , and assume the matter density @xmath12 as the combination of different matter components @xmath14 , @xmath16 , @xmath18 , and @xmath34 indicating the baryonic matter , radiation , dark matter and cosmological constant respectively , so that @xmath35 the second modified flrw equation is also given by @xmath36 and also for the energy density conservation equation we have @xmath37    now , regarding the cosmological evolution of radiation and baryonic matter we consider the relations @xmath38 and @xmath39 , respectively ; meanwhile @xmath40 and @xmath41 are the energy densities corresponding to their values at @xmath42 , and also for the dark matter we work with a general form of density as @xmath43 . it should be noted that @xmath44 is an arbitrary function which depends on the special dark matter model . as we know",
    "we have the critical density as @xmath45 , where @xmath46 is the value of the hubble parameter at @xmath42 .",
    "in addition , we can write dimensionless parameters known as density parameters as @xmath47 , with @xmath48 . using these relations helps us to write the following new form of modified flrw equation @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the dark energy density parameter .",
    "thus , we can write the constraint @xmath51    now , we suppose that at early universe the bosonic particles , with mass @xmath52 and a very high temperature @xmath53 , were in equilibrium state with other particles in a hot relativistic plasma . after the expansion of universe and rapid decrease of the temperature it was decoupled from this equilibrium state at a high chemical potential @xmath54 or low decoupling temperature @xmath55 . at this decoupling temperature , we assume that the bosonic particles are still in kinetic equilibrium among themselves in an isotropic gas with low temperature . consequently ,",
    "for the spatial number density we have @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the helicity states number , @xmath58 is planck s constant , and @xmath59 is defined as follows @xmath60 - 1\\right)},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath61 is the energy @xmath62 and @xmath13 is the momentum of the particle . due to the red - shift in the momentum of particles , we have @xmath63 where @xmath64 and @xmath65 denote for the momentum of particles and the scale factor of universe , respectively , at the temperature @xmath66 denoting for the decoupling temperature from the rest of plasma . besides , we have the scaling evolution relation for the number density given by @xmath67 @xcite . for the extreme - relativistic case @xmath68 ( @xmath69 and @xmath70 ) , the distribution function",

    "the associated energy density @xmath77 and kinetic energy - momentum tensor @xmath78 are as follows , respectively @xmath79 @xmath80 the mentioned pressure is described by @xmath81 where we have used @xmath82 @xcite . the density of dark matter @xmath18 for the nonrelativistic case with @xmath83 and @xmath84 is given by @xmath85 whereas the dark matter pressure is given by @xmath86 which leads to @xmath87 where we have used @xmath88 , @xmath89 being the one - dimensional velocity dispersion . by means of the dark matter conservation equation @xmath90 we can find the following general solution @xmath91 where @xmath92 is the density of dark matter at the present value of scale factor @xmath42 . in the standard model , for the description of the dynamics of our universe with a normal dark matter we work with the following equation@xmath93.\\ ] ] however , in lqc model we will have the following modification @xmath94 since we aim to extract numerical results for dynamical bec quantities , we have to mention the values of several parameters and quantities such as the hubble constant @xmath95 @xmath96 @xmath97 , the hubble time @xmath98 @xmath99 , the critical density @xmath100 @xmath101 , and the present day dark matter densities @xmath102 , @xmath103 , @xmath104 , @xmath105 respectively @xcite .",
    "it is worth to remind that the following dark matter case is non - relativistic so the global cosmological evolution of the universe will not be affected by the variation of the numerical values of @xmath106 .",
    "as is explained in the introduction , in the very low temperature all dilute bose gas particles are condensed to the same quantum ground state which leads to the bec formation . when the particle s wavelengths overlap , they will experience correlation with each other and the mean inter - particles distance @xmath107 becomes definitely smaller than the thermal wavelength @xmath108 .",
    "this is possible when the temperature is almost @xmath109 @xmath110 , where @xmath3 is the particle mass in the condensate , @xmath5 is boltzmann s constant @xcite and @xmath12 is the density . under the condition that the universe is sufficiently large and",
    "temperature is low enough , there will be a coherent state in progress due to the overlap of the particles wavelengths .",
    "our main assumption is that the dark matter halos may be constructed by a strongly coupled dilute bec at absolute zero . as a result ,",
    "all the particles are in the condensate .",
    "therefore in this situation , just binary collisions at low energy are considerable .",
    "these collisions are specified by just one parameter @xmath111 , _ s - wave scattering length _ , which is thoroughly independent of the two - body potential .",
    "consequently , the interaction potential can be replaced by an effective interaction @xmath112 , where @xmath113 @xcite .",
    "the gross - pitaevskii ( gp ) equation , describing the ground state properties of the dark matter , for the dark matter halos can be obtained from the gp energy functional as follows @xmath114=\\int\\left[\\frac{\\hbar^{2}}{2m_{\\chi}}|\\nabla\\psi(\\vec{r})|^{2}+\\frac{u_{0}}{2}|\\psi(\\vec{r})|^{4}\\right]d\\vec{r}- \\frac{1}{2}gm^{2}_{\\chi}\\int\\int\\frac{|\\psi(\\vec{r})|^{2}|\\psi(\\vec{r}^{'})|^{2}}{|\\vec{r}-\\vec{r}'|}d\\vec{r}d\\vec{r}^{'},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath115 @xcite and obviously we have applied @xmath116 as the wave function of the condensate . in the equation ( [ eq22 ] ) , the first and second terms are the quantum pressure and the interaction energy , respectively , and also the third term is the gravitational potential energy . it should be noted that the condensate dark matter mass density is as follows @xmath117 and that the wave function satisfies the normalization condition @xmath118 , where @xmath119 is the total number of particles .",
    "eventually , by imposing the variational procedure @xmath120-\\mu~\\delta\\int|\\psi(\\vec{r})|^{2}d\\vec{r}=0 $ ] , the gp equation is extracted @xmath121 while @xmath122 plays the role of chemical potential .",
    "in addition the gravitational potential @xmath26 follows the well - known poison equation @xmath123 . having considered time dependency , the generalized gp equation , showing a gravitationally trapped rotating bec ,",
    "is found as @xmath124\\psi(\\vec{r},t).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    by means of the well - known madelung representation of the wave function , we can reach to our purpose more easily than using the last generalized gp equation . in order to go trough this , we should consider the following representation of @xmath125 @xmath126,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath127 represents the classical action . inserting the last expression of @xmath128 into equation ( [ eq25 ] ) leads to the following differential equations @xmath129",
    "@xmath130=- \\nabla p_{\\chi}\\left(\\frac{\\rho_{\\chi}}{m_{\\chi}}\\right ) - \\rho_{\\chi}\\nabla\\left(\\frac{v}{m_{\\chi}}\\right)-\\nabla v_{q},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath131 is the velocity of the quantum fluid and @xmath132 is the quantum potential , given by @xmath133 by defining @xmath134 , the condensate effective pressure is obtained @xmath135    the quantum pressure term makes a great contribution just close to the boundary of the condensate provided that the number of particles in the gravitationally bounded bec becomes large enough . as a result , the quantum stress term in the condensate equation of motion can be ignored , which is so called thomas - fermi approximation .",
    "when the number of particles in the condensate goes to infinity , the mentioned thomas - fermi approximation becomes accurate .",
    "it is also related to the classical limit of the theory . according to its definition , the velocity field is irrotational following the condition @xmath136 . in accordance with equations ( [ eq10 ] ) and ( [ eq30 ] )",
    "we can write @xmath137 which has the following general solution with the integration constant @xmath138 @xmath139 having imposed the condition @xmath140 for @xmath42 , we can find the density of the condensate as @xmath141 where @xmath142",
    "for an interacting bose system case , where all dark matter particles are supposed to be in a single - particle state , the transition procedure from the normal to the condensed phase , and the order of the phase transition has been extensively studied in the recent literature @xcite-@xcite . in principle , bec represents a spontaneous breaking of @xmath143 gauge symmetry , with the condensate fraction showing the order parameter , leading to the second order phase transition @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , it has been shown that bec is a first - order phase transition@xcite , @xcite . from another point of view , in thermodynamics",
    "the first - order phase transitions result in a genuine mathematical singularity .",
    "the question that  can finite systems in nature explicitly show such a behavior ? \" is a mysterious controversial question in physics @xcite .",
    "nonetheless , a significant study about the thermodynamic instability in an ideal bose gas , confined in a cubic box , has shown that a system including a finite number of particles can exhibit an interrupted phase transition , describing a real mathematical singularity , with constant pressure @xcite .",
    "of course the mentioned result was obtained without considering a continuous approximation or a thermodynamic limit .",
    "therefore , according to above discussion , we will assume that the intrinsic dynamics of bec is described in the framework of a first - order phase transition .      as we know",
    ", in general , the chemical potential @xmath122 in a physical system is a function which depends on the temperature and particle density @xmath144 ( @xmath4 is the total particle number and @xmath26 is the volume ) . by considering the property of extensivity of the helmholtz free energy @xmath145",
    ", we are allowed to write not only @xmath146 but also @xmath147 , where @xmath148 and @xmath149 . using the helmholtz free energy",
    "we can obtain @xmath150 and @xmath151 having the same information .    imposing the thermodynamical requirements ,",
    "the chemical potential and the pressure are supposed to be single - valued which means that for arbitrary values of @xmath4 , @xmath152 and @xmath53 , there must be just one choice for @xmath122 or @xmath13 , respectively @xcite .",
    "hence , the pressure at the transition moment during the bec process must be continuous .",
    "imposing this thermodynamic condition on equations ( [ eq18 ] ) and ( [ eq30 ] ) , helps us to fix the transition density @xmath153 as follows @xmath154    apparently , in order to have the numerical value of the transition density , we should know the scattering length , the dark matter particle mass and the particle velocity dispersion .",
    "supposing typically the mass of dark matter particle , the mean velocity square , and the scattering length to be of the order of @xmath155 @xmath156 , @xmath157 @xmath158 and @xmath159 @xmath160 , respectively , we can write @xmath161 therefore , the critical temperature at the bec moment is obtained by @xmath162 where @xmath163 is the riemann zeta function , or equivalently @xmath164 the critical pressure of the dark matter fluid at the critical point is given by    @xmath165    using the equation ( [ eq35 ] ) we can calculate the critical value of scale factor as @xmath166 consequently , we can find the critical red - shift as follows    @xmath167    by inserting the above mentioned numerical values of the parameters in the two last relations we have    @xmath168    and @xmath169 the obtained critical values of density , temperature , pressure , scale factor and redshift are important in the study of subsequent ( lqc ) evolution of the the universe during the bose - einstein condensation toward the end time of phase transition when the universe enters in the complete bose - einstein condensed dark matter phase .",
    "we will use these critical values in the study of this evolution in the following subsection .        using all these equations",

    ", we deduce the approximation @xmath202 in the following calculations .",
    "another approximation comes from neglecting the radiation energy density contribution , so the equation ( [ eq53 ] ) can be integrated to extract @xmath8 @xmath203 where we have defined @xmath204 and @xmath205 in order to obtain the necessary time interval for the entire converting process of the total normal dark matter into the bose - einstein condensed phase , we put @xmath206 in our last calculation @xmath207.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] by inserting the value of dark energy density parameter @xmath50 as 0.68 and also considering the standard values @xmath208 @xmath209 , @xmath210 @xmath211 , @xmath212 @xmath213 , and @xmath214 , we can obtain the following expression for the conversion time of the dark matter to the bose - einstein condensed phase @xmath215\\times t_{h}\\rm s.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for instance , for @xmath216 and @xmath217 , we will have @xmath218 . since it is thoroughly useful to depict the time evolution of @xmath8 , we have represented ( [ eq54 ] ) for different values of @xmath219 in fig.1 .",
    "after the complete conversion to the bec phase , the post - condensation phase begins , which starts at @xmath220 and @xmath221 .",
    "similar to the era , during the condensation phase , in which the cosmological dynamics is affected by the bec ( see ( [ eq50 ] ) ) , the bose - einstein condensed dark matter , in the post condensation phase , may change the cosmological dynamics of the universe in lqc model .",
    "moreover , the bose - einstein condensed dark matter may have considerable impact on the subsequent structure formation in the universe .",
    "therefore , the post condensation phase and the corresponding cosmological values in lqc model are important and deserve more scrutiny .    according to ( [ eq33 ] ) ,",
    "we can obtain the cosmological density of the dark matter as follows @xmath222 where , the numerical value of @xmath223 is obtained from ( [ eq34 ] )    @xmath224    clearly , the density ( [ eq59 ] ) should be positive which leads to the condition @xmath225 . simplifying the equation ( [ eq21 ] ) and defining @xmath226 gives us the time evolution of the scale factor in the bec phase",
    "as follows    @xmath227    by integration of this relation , we obtain exactly an expression with the following form @xmath228 where @xmath229 is an integration constant , determined from the constraint @xmath230 at @xmath220 as            @xmath231    for the universe presented here , filled with radiation , dark energy , baryonic matter and bose - einstein condensed dark matter , the equation describing time evolution of the scale factor is given by @xmath232 which can be integrated by considering the initial conditions @xmath233 . to study the time evolution of the scale factor in such a universe which contains bec dark matter",
    ", it will be useful to depict it for different values of the @xmath223 in fig.@xmath234 .",
    "it is remarkable that the existence of the condensed dark matter changes the cosmological dynamics of the universe in the post condensation phase , and the magnitude of this change decreases with the increase of the bose - einstein condensate parameter @xmath223 .",
    "this behavior is expected because as @xmath223 increases , the corresponding gravity contributes stronger to the dynamics and decreases the expansion rate . on the other hand ,",
    "it is seen from fig.2 that as @xmath223 increases , the bose - einstein condensation phase ( where @xmath235 ) occurs at earlier times .",
    "this is also justified because as @xmath223 increases , the @xmath236 increases as well and so the scale factor @xmath237 corresponding to this increased density tends toward the scale factors having higher density , which naturally occurs at earlier times .",
    "when the bose - einstein condensation happens , dark matter contains two phases , the normal and the condensed phase , respectively . under a thermodynamic condition , we expect to have the continuity of the pressure profile of these two phases right at the beginning of the condensation process .",
    "this leads to uniquely determination of dark matter density at the condensation time as well as other thermodynamical quantities , like temperature and pressure .",
    "the explicit numerical values of the condensation quantities is related to mean square velocity of the normal dark matter @xmath106 and the mass @xmath52 of the dark matter particle and the scattering length @xmath111 . as a result of the uncertainty of the values of @xmath106 , @xmath52 and @xmath111 ,",
    "apparently it is difficult to predict the precise and exact cosmological moment of the bose - einstein condensation and consequently the corresponding cosmological quantities . nevertheless , by considering some `` standard '' numerical values , it will be possible to obtain a total qualitative picture of the transition .",
    "consequently , we estimate the values of the dark matter mass and the mean velocity of the non - relativistic dark matter particles , of the order of @xmath238@xcite , @xcite and @xmath239 , respectively .",
    "according to the general analysis of the condensation process , the first phase of condensation belongs to the standard @xmath34 cold dark matter ( @xmath34cdm ) model . in this paper",
    ", we have generalized this analysis and have gone through the loop quantum cosmology context . with the standard numerical values of the dark matter quantities ,",
    "the condensation was begun at a redshift around @xmath240 . here , we have studied the time evolution of the fraction factor @xmath8 of the condensed dark matter through the loop quantum cosmology . in the next step ,",
    "we have extracted the modified phase transition time interval in lqc , which is approximately of the order of hubble time and shows the viability of our results .",
    "we have studied the evolution during the bose - einstein condensation phase and found that this condensation process modifies the expansion rate of the universe .",
    "also , we have studied the post - condensation phase in lqc model , describing the time evolution of universe right after the end of phase transition , which leads to ( [ eq64 ] ) .",
    "the cosmic time dependence of the global formation of bec dark matter ( at @xmath184 ) is an advantage , compared to the ordinary dark matter , which makes bec dark matter to be preferred than the ordinary dark matter .",
    "this is an important feature which makes bec dark matter to be similar to the global dark matter candidates like neutrinos , wimps , axions and lsp .",
    "the ordinary dark matter has not such capability and can not form global sources of dark matter at a definite cosmic time , and that is why we have favoured bec dark matter in the present study .",
    "we have plotted the time behavior of equations ( [ eq53 ] ) and ( [ eq64 ] ) in figures 1 and 2 for different values of @xmath219 and @xmath223 , showing the definite effect of the phase transition and bose - einstein condensed dark matter density in the modified cosmological history in the loop quantum cosmology .",
    "a major point regarding the present study is that assuming two phases of dark matter , one as the bosonic particles before bec , and the other one as bec dark matter , `` is there any experimental indication for the occurrence of bec , the existence of these two phases , and the preference of one to the other one ? '' or `` why it is necessary to distinguish ordinary dark matter from bec dark matter ? '' . of course",
    ", at present there is no direct evidence for the occurrence of bec , the existence of these two phases , and the preference of one to the other one .",
    "however , in order to answer properly these questions , we may try to answer the alternative question that `` is there any indication for distinguishing between the dynamics of the universe having bosonic particles without the occurrence of bec , and the one with bec dark matter '' . in this regard , we may point out that the time evolution of the scale factor with bec is different from that of without bec for many possible reasons such as i ) the equation of state parameter of bec dark matter is different from that of bosonic particles without bec , due to the first order phase transition , ii ) in the absence of bec , the bosonic particles may interact or participate in some possible transformations into other matter components , like visible matter or dark energy , each resulting in different dynamical history of the universe ; however with bec the condensed bosonic particles can not decay into other forms of matter and they remain as the bec dark matter permanently , with a definite dynamical history distinguishable from variety of dynamics corresponding to the regular bosonic particles having different kinds of interaction with other matter components .",

    "<S> we consider the flrw universe in a loop quantum cosmological model filled with the radiation , baryonic matter ( with negligible pressure ) , dark energy and dark matter . </S>",
    "<S> the dark matter sector is supposed to be of bose - einstein condensate type . </S>",
    "<S> the bose - einstein condensation process in a cosmological context by supposing it as an approximate first order phase transition , has been already studied in the literature . here , we study the evolution of the physical quantities related to the early universe description such as the energy density , temperature and scale factor of the universe , before , during and after the condensation process . </S>",
    "<S> we also consider in detail the evolution era of the universe in a mixed normal - condensate dark matter phase . the behavior and time evolution of the condensate dark matter fraction is also analyzed . </S>"
