    "nonlinear wave equations ( nlwe ) lie at the heart of many fields in physics including hydrodynamics , classical integrable systems , field theories , etc .",
    "let us give a prototype class of nlwe for a real scalar field , @xmath0 in @xmath1 dimensional space - time : [ nlwe ] - + ^(n ) = f(),^(n)=_i=1^n , where the real function , @xmath2 , defining the theory is given for example as @xmath3 for the `` canonical '' @xmath4 model , and @xmath5 for the sine - gordon ( sg ) model .",
    "a particularly interesting class of solutions of nlwe is the class of nonsingular ones exhibiting spatial localization .",
    "such spatially localized solutions have finite energy and can correspond to static particle - like objects or to various traveling waves . in field theory",
    "localized static solutions have been quite intensively studied in a great number of models in various space - time dimensions , see e.g.  the recent book of sutcliffe and manton @xcite .",
    "spatially localized solutions with a non - trivial time dependence ( i.e. not simply in uniform motion ) of nlwe are much harder to find .",
    "in fact the simple qualitative argument stating that _ `` anything that can radiate does radiate '' _ , indicates that the time evolution of well localized cauchy data leads _ generically _ to either a _ stable static _ solution plus radiation fields , or the originally localized fields disperse completely due to the continuous loss of energy through radiation . since derrick - type scaling arguments exclude the existence of localized static solutions in scalar field theories given by eq .",
    "( [ nlwe ] ) in more than two spatial dimensions , for @xmath6 one does not expect to find localized states at all at the end of a time evolution . simplifying somewhat the above",
    ", one could say that in the absence of static localized solutions , localized initial data can not stay forever localized .",
    "in fact for localized initial data there is a time scale which is the crossing time , @xmath7 , ( the time it takes for a wave propagating with characteristic speed to cross the localized region ) and a priori one would expect the rapid dispersion of initially localized cauchy data within a few units of @xmath7 .",
    "one of the rare examples of a time - periodic solution , staying localized forever is the famous `` breather '' in the @xmath8 dimensional sine - gordon ( sg ) model .    in the @xmath8 dimensional `` canonical '' ( with a double well potential ) @xmath4 theory the pioneering work , based on perturbation theory by dashen , hasslacher and neveu @xcite indicated the possible existence of breather - like solutions .",
    "a completely independent numerical study by kudryavtsev @xcite has also indicated that suitable initial data evolve into breather - type states .",
    "these results stimulated a number of investigations about the possible existence of non - radiative solutions in the @xmath8 dimensional @xmath4 model .",
    "after a long history segur and kruskal @xcite and vuillermot @xcite have finally established that in spite of the above mentioned perturbative and numerical indications time - periodic spatially localized finite energy solutions ( breathers ) do not exist .",
    "even if genuine localized breathers in the @xmath8 dimensional @xmath4 model are absent , in view of the perturbative and numerical evidence for the existence of long living states `` close '' to genuine breathers , it is a natural question how to describe them .",
    "boyd has made a detailed study of time periodic solutions which are only _ weakly localized _ in space ( i.e. the field @xmath0 possesses a slowly decreasing oscillatory tail ) but as long as the amplitude of the oscillatory `` wings '' are small they still have a well defined core .",
    "boyd has dubbed such solutions `` nanopterons '' ( small wings ) , we refer to his book for a detailed review @xcite .",
    "quite interestingly bogoluvskii and makhankov have found numerical evidence for the existence of spatially localized breather - type states in the spherically symmetric sector of @xmath4 theory in @xmath9 dimensions @xcite .",
    "these breather - like objects observed during the time evolution of some initial data are called nowadays `` oscillons '' .",
    "most of the observed oscillon states are unstable having only a _ finite lifetime_. they lose their energy by radiating it ( slowly ) to infinity .",
    "more recent investigations started by gleiser @xcite have revealed that oscillons do form in a fairly large class of scalar theories in various spatial dimensions via the collapse of field configurations ( initial data ) that interpolate between two vacuum states of a double well potential .",
    "such a spherically symmetric configuration corresponds to a bubble , where the interpolating region is the bubble wall that separates the two vacuum states at some characteristic radius .",
    "these works have led to a renewed interest in the subject .    it has been found that oscillons have extremely long lifetimes which is already quite remarkable and makes them of quite some interest .",
    "these long living oscillon states seem to occur in a rather generic way in various field theories involving scalar fields in even higher dimensional space - times @xcite and according to @xcite oscillons are also present in the nonabelian su(2 ) bosonic sector of the standard model of electroweak interactions at least for certain values of the pertinent couplings",
    ". such oscillons might have important effects on the inflationary scenario @xcite as they could form in large numbers retaining a considerable amount of energy .",
    "in a recent study @xcite of a @xmath8 dimensional scalar theory on an expanding background exhibited very long oscillon lifetimes , while in ref .",
    "@xcite , @xcite extremely long living oscillons have been exhibited in a @xmath10 dimensional sine - gordon model .",
    "the sophisticated numerical simulations by honda and choptuik of the cauchy problem for spherically symmetric configurations in the @xmath4 theory in @xmath9 dimensions @xcite , @xcite , have revealed some interesting new features of the oscillons .",
    "in particular in ref .  @xcite it has been found that by a suitable fine - tuning of the initial data the lifetime of the oscillons could be increased seemingly indefinitely , and it has been conjectured that actually an infinitely long lived , i.e.  non - radiative , spatially localized solution exists .",
    "furthermore the existence of such a solution would even provide the explanation of the `` raison dtre '' and of the observed genericness of long lived oscillons .",
    "the eventual existence of a non - radiative breather in this simple and `` generic '' @xmath4 model in @xmath9 dimensions would be clearly of quite some importance .",
    "it should be noted , that in quite a few spatially discrete models , localized time - periodic `` discrete breathers '' have been shown to exist and they are being intensively studied @xcite .",
    "one of the motivation of our work has been to clarify if non - radiative breathers indeed exist and to find them directly by studying time - periodic solutions of the nlwe .",
    "our numerical results led us to conclude that no localized ( with finite energy ) time - periodic solutions exist in the @xmath4 model . on the other hand",
    "this study has led us to understand the oscillon phenomenon better and we present a simple but quantitatively correct scenario explaining some important properties of the oscillons ( such as their existence and their long lifetimes ) .",
    "our scenario is based on the existence of a special class of time periodic solutions which are weakly localized in space . such solutions ( which have infinite energy )",
    "will be referred to as quasi - breathers ( qb ) .    in the present paper",
    "we make a detailed study of oscillons in the ( already much studied ) @xmath4 model in @xmath9 dimensions . using a previously developed and well tested time evolution code where space is compactified , thereby avoiding the problem of artificial boundaries @xcite , we compute some long - time evolutions of gaussian - type initial data .",
    "we observe that long living ( @xmath11 in natural units ) oscillon states are formed from generic initial data .",
    "these oscillons radiate slowly their energy and for short ( as compared to their total lifetime ) timescales they can be characterized by a typical frequency , @xmath12 .",
    "this frequency increases slowly during the lifetime of the oscillon and when @xmath12 reaches a critical value @xmath13 there is a rapid decay . by fine - tuning the initial data one can achieve that the oscillon state instead of rapidly decaying evolves into a near time - periodic state , whose frequency is nearly constant in time and @xmath14 .",
    "the existence of such near - periodic states ( referred to as resonant oscillons ) has been already reported in ref .",
    "@xcite , and we also observe an increase of the lifetime of these states without any apparent limit by fine - tuning the parameters of the initial data to more and more significant digits .",
    "there are , however , also some discrepancies .",
    "we find that clearly distinct near - periodic states for various values of the pulsation frequency @xmath14 exist .",
    "according to our results there is little doubt that for any value of @xmath12 in this range a corresponding near - periodic oscillon state exists .",
    "our data clearly shows that the near - periodic states also radiate , although very weakly .",
    "the radiation becomes weaker and weaker as @xmath15 .",
    "on the other hand we have implemented a multi domain spectral method in order to find directly stationary , time periodic solutions of the nlwe and compare them to the long living oscillon states obtained from the time evolution .",
    "this makes it possible to attack the problem of finding directly the putative time periodic breather(s ) .",
    "( one could easily generalize our method for the quasi - periodic case . )",
    "we find that there is a large family of time periodic solutions which are only _ weakly localized _ in space , in that they have a well defined core , and an oscillatory tail decreasing as @xmath16 .",
    "we single out a special family among them by minimizing the amplitude of their oscillatory tail which definition comes close to minimizing the energy density of the oscillatory tail .",
    "these solutions are the closest to a breather and for that reason we call them quasi - breathers .",
    "they seem to exist for any frequency , @xmath17 , although in this paper we exhibit qbs only with @xmath18 .",
    "the amplitude of the oscillatory tail of the qbs becomes arbitrarily small as the frequency approaches the continuum threshold defined by the mass of the field , @xmath15 .",
    "our numerical evidence speaks clearly against the possible existence of a truly localized , breather - like solution periodic in time , for the frequency range @xmath19 contrary to the claims of ref .  @xcite . in view of these conflicting numerical findings",
    "it is now highly desirable to try to find an analytical proof or disproof of the existence of a localized non - radiative solution to settle this issue .",
    "we do not expect the situation being qualitatively different from the @xmath8 dimensional case , and although the proofs of refs .",
    "@xcite are not applicable for the @xmath9 dimensional case , we see no reason that their negative conclusion would be altered .",
    "more importantly , we believe to have made a step towards understanding the mechanism behind the existence of such long - living oscillonic states without the need to invoke genuine breather solutions , which even if they would exist would be clearly non - generic , while the qbs seem to be generic .",
    "the total energy of the quasi - breathers is divergent , due to the lack of sufficient ( exponential ) spatial localization , hence they are not of direct physical relevance .",
    "nevertheless a careful numerical study shows that the _ oscillons _ produced during the time evolution of some suitable cauchy data are quantitatively very well described by the _ quasi - breathers_. by comparing the fourier decomposition of an oscillon state at some instant , @xmath20 characterized by a frequency , @xmath21 , obtained during the time evolution with that of the corresponding qb , we have obtained convincing evidence that the localized part of the oscillon corresponds to the core of the qb of frequency @xmath21 .",
    "what is more , the oscillatory tail of the qb describes very well the standing wave part of the oscillon .",
    "our oscillon scenario is based on this analysis and leads us to propose that any oscillon contains the core and a significant part of the oscillatory tail of the corresponding qb .",
    "the time evolution of an oscillon can be approximatively described as an adiabatic evolution through a sequence of qbs with a slowly changing frequency @xmath21 .",
    "this oscillon scenario is based on the existence and of the genericness of the qbs .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",

    "this way we can guarantee that our computational grid , associated with a finite - difference scheme , covers the entire physical spacetime , at least in principle .",
    "specifically , a new radial coordinate , @xmath34 , is introduced in the following way : @xmath35 where @xmath36 is an arbitrary positive constant . in the new radial coordinate , @xmath34 ,",
    "the entire minkowski spacetime is covered by the coordinate domain @xmath37 while spacelike infinity is represented by the ` hypersurface ' @xmath38 .",
    "the @xmath39 ` lines ' represent world - lines of ` static observers ' , i.e. integral curves of the vector field @xmath40 . in the compactified representation",
    "the field equation , ( [ e : fe2 ] ) , reads as @xmath41 where @xmath42 is given by @xmath43    we remark that the spacelike compactification used here is a simplified variant of the conformal transformation used in @xcite .",
    "there instead of the @xmath44 hypersurfaces the initial data are specified on hyperboloids .",
    "furthermore minkowski spacetime is compactified mapping null infinity to finite coordinate values .",
    "since in the present case the scalar field , @xmath0 , is massive , i.e. never reaches null infinity the hyperboloidal compactification is not essential .    in order to obtain a system of first order equations",
    "we introduce the independent variables @xmath45 and @xmath46",
    ". then equation ( [ e : fe3 ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath47 which together with the integrability condition @xmath48 and the defining equation @xmath49 form a strongly hyperbolic system of first order differential equations for the three variables @xmath30 , @xmath50 and @xmath51 ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the initial value problem for such a first order system is known to be well - posed @xcite .",
    "note that the relation @xmath52 is preserved by the evolution equations , and therefore it corresponds to a constraint equation .    in order to solve the initial value problem for equation ( [ e : fe4 ] )",
    "we discretize the independent variables @xmath20 and @xmath34 .",
    "a simple uniform grid with steps @xmath53 and @xmath54 is introduced .",

    "time integration is done using the ` method of lines ' in a fourth order runge - kutta scheme , following the recipes proposed by gustafsson _",
    "et al _ @xcite .",
    "a dissipative term proportional to the sixth derivative of the field is added in order to stabilize the evolution . since this dissipative term",
    "is also chosen to be proportional to @xmath55 , it does not reduce the order of the applied numerical method , in other words , its influence is decreased by the increase of the used resolution .",
    "the numerical methods and the actual numerical code we use for calculating time evolution in this paper are also based on those developed in @xcite .",
    "a few non - physical grid points are introduced for both negative radii @xmath56 and for the region `` beyond infinity '' @xmath57 .",
    "instead of calculating the time evolution of the @xmath56 points , the symmetry property of @xmath0 about the origin @xmath58 is used to set the function values at each time step .",
    "similarly , @xmath0 , being a massive field , decays exponentially towards infinity , consequently all the field values @xmath30 , @xmath50 and @xmath51 are set to zero for @xmath59 during the entire evolution .",
    "this takes care of the spacelike infinity @xmath60 in equation ( [ e : fe4 ] ) .",
    "therefore it is possible to use symmetric stencils exclusively when calculating spatial derivatives .",
    "the grid point at the origin @xmath58 needs special treatment since the last term as it stands on the right hand side of equation ( [ e : fe4 ] ) is apparently singular .",
    "however , this term , when evaluated in terms of the original ( non - singular ) field value @xmath0 have zero limit value at @xmath58 .    although compactifying in spatial direction restricts the coordinate @xmath34 to a finite domain , grid points in our numerical representation get separated by larger and larger physical distances as we approach @xmath38 .",
    "this far region , where shells of outgoing radiation can not be represented properly , moves out to higher and higher physical radii as @xmath54 decreases .",
    "numerical simulations with increasing number of grid points demonstrate that wave packets of outgoing massive fields get absorbed in the transitional region without getting reflected back into the inner domain . in this way",
    "our numerical simulations still give a good description of the field behavior precisely in the central region for very long time periods .",
    "the simple but physically non - uniform grid together with the help of the dissipation term appears to absorb outgoing radiation in a similar way to the explicit adiabatic dumping term method applied by gleiser and sornborger @xcite .",
    "furthermore , because of the very low inward light velocity in the asymptotic region @xmath61 the field behavior in the central region is correctly given for a long time period even after the appearance of numerical errors at @xmath61 .",
    "simulating time evolution of oscillons up to their typical maximal lifetime of @xmath62 using spatial resolution of @xmath63 points took usually a week on personal computers .",
    "however , because of the need of several runs when fine - tuning parameters in the initial data , we mostly used typical resolutions of @xmath64 spatial points .",
    "the parameter @xmath36 in the coordinate transformation ( [ e : itr2 ] ) was set to @xmath65 in our simulations in order to concentrate approximately the same number of grid points to the central oscillon region and to the far away region where the massive fields form high frequency expanding shells .",
    "a courant factor of @xmath66 turned out to be appropriate to obtain stable simulations with our choice of @xmath36 .",
    "the convergence tests confirmed that our code does provide a fourth order representation of the selected evolution equations .",
    "moreover , we monitored the energy conservation and the preservation of the constraint equation @xmath52 .",
    "most importantly , we compared the field values which can be deduced by making use of the green s function and by the adaptation of our particular numerical code to the case of massive linear klein - gordon fields @xcite .",
    "the coincidence between the values in the central region provided by these two independent methods for long time evolutions ( @xmath67 measured in mass units ) made it apparent that the phenomena described below should be considered as true physical properties of the investigated non - linear field configurations .",

    "no matter what the initial guess for the different modes is , the code always converges to a trivial static solution of this type .",

    "<S> it is demonstrated that the oscillon states can be quantitatively described by the weakly localized quasi - breathers . </S>",
    "<S> it is found that the quasi - breathers and their oscillon counterparts exist for a whole continuum of frequencies . </S>"
