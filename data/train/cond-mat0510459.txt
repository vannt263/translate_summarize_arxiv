    "the classic example of a gapless ` algebraic ' spin liquid is the ground state of the nearest neighbor spin-@xmath2 chain .",
    "this state has slow power law correlations for both the neel and vbs correlations . in this brief section",
    "we provide a lightning overview of its field theoretic description which will be useful for us later .",
    "the low energy physics of the spin-@xmath2 chain may be described by the following field theory @xmath19 here @xmath20 . the number @xmath21 is defined as follows .",
    "the field @xmath8 defines a map from @xmath22 to @xmath23 .",
    "the volume in @xmath23 bounded by the surface traced out by @xmath8 defines @xmath21 .",
    "formally @xmath24 here the two dimensional space - time @xmath22 is regarded as the boundary of a solid ball b , and @xmath25 are coordinates of b. the matrix @xmath8 has been extended to the ball b in such a way that at the boundary it has the correct value for the two dimensional field theory .",
    "we may write @xmath8 in the form @xmath26 with @xmath27 , _",
    "i.e _ in terms of a four component unit vector .",
    "then the action may be written @xmath28 the neel and vbs order parameters are simply determined in terms of the unit vector @xmath29 .",
    "we have @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "the wzw field theory has global @xmath32 symmetry due to which the neel vector can be rotated into the vbs order parameter .",
    "this symmetry which emerges as a property of the low energy fixed point guarantees that the neel and vbs order parameters have the same long distance correlations .",
    "thus the wzw field theory provides a ` superspin ' field theory of the two dominant competing orders of the quantum spin-@xmath2 chain .",
    "note that the topological wzw term is required to correctly reproduce the known physics of the spin chain in this superspin decription .",
    "the wzw theory must be contrasted with another popular field theory for the spin-@xmath2 chain : the @xmath4 sigma model with a topological term .",
    "this representation treats the neel and vbs orders on unequal footing even though they eventually have the same low energy behavior .",
    "indeed the vbs order parameter is represented rather non - trivially as the topological charge density and its connections to the neel vector are not at all obvious in this field theory .",
    "finally it is possible to examine the spin-@xmath2 chain in a slave particle description of the spins by writing the spin operator at site @xmath33 as @xmath34 with @xmath35 a spinful fermionic ` spinon ' field at each lattice site .",
    "following standard techniques the spin hamiltonian may be recast as a @xmath12 ( or @xmath7 ) gauge theory of these spinons coupled to a fluctuating gauge field - see refs . .",
    "a suitable continuum approximation can then be made to obtain a theory of massless dirac spinons coupled to a fluctuating gauge field ( massless @xmath36 in the @xmath12 case ) .",
    "the gauge fluctuations can then be integrated out exactly after bosonization and the resulting theory is equivalent to the wzw theory above . in particular as emphasized in ref .",
    "the slave spinon is quite distinct from the true spinon known to exist in the spectrum of the spin-@xmath2 chain .",
    "thus in this one dimensional algebraic spin liquid the spinon - gauge description is unnnecessary and a description in terms of the slow competing orders is possible .",
    "here we consider a two dimensional system obtained as an infinite array of one dimensional spin-@xmath2 chains coupled together by short - ranged antiferromagnetic interactions .",
    "the entire system then has rectangular symmetry in two dimensions . in general such coupling",
    "tends to stabilize ordering of one of the slow fluctuating order parameters of the decoupled chain . for unfrustrated interchain couplings ,",
    "collinear neel ordering at @xmath37 is stabilized . with frustration that suppresses neel order , columnar vbs ordering at @xmath38",
    "often gets stabilized as shown in recent work by starykh and balents@xcite .",
    "the competition between the neel state and the columnar vbs state of this rectangular lattice may be understood in the following terms .",
    "consider the limit of reasonably strong two dimensional coupling .",
    "then an @xmath39 @xmath4 non - linear sigma model description of the neel vector fluctuations is useful .",
    "this model must be supplemented with appropriate berry phases .",
    "these berry phases only affect singular hedgehog configurations of the neel vector in space - time@xcite . due to the berry phases these hedgehog insertions have the same symmetry as the vbs order parameter and",
    "hence may be identified with them@xcite . with rectangular symmetry",
    "it is known that in any putative continuum description the hedgehogs are doubled ( note contrast to square lattice where they are quadrupled ) .",
    "neel order is destroyed if the hedgehogs proliferate .",
    "their berry phases then induce vbs order . here",
    "the resulting state is two - fold degenerate due to the doubling of hedgehogs and may be identified with the two - fold degenerate columnar vbs pattern .",
    "the neel - vbs transition in this case is presumably first order due to the likely relevance of doubled monopoles at the critical fixed point of the hedgehog - free theory@xcite .",
    "( however there will be an interesting deconfined multicritical point ) .",
    "now we show how these results may be reproduced in an alternate approach that directly attempts a ` superspin ' description of the two competing orders ( neel and vbs ) in terms of a four component field . as already illustrated by the analysis in @xmath40",
    ", this will require incorporating an appropriate topological term . before supplying the derivation",
    "let us first understand the structure of the allowed superspin field theory .",
    "with a four component ` order parameter ' field , we might attempt a description in terms of an @xmath1 non - linear sigma model with some @xmath4 anisotropy . ignoring the anisotropy for the time being ,",
    "the action for such a theory is defined by @xmath41 where @xmath29 is a four - component unit vector .",
    "the neel and vbs order parameters are related to @xmath29 in the same way as in the @xmath42 case .",
    "the order parameter clearly lives in @xmath23 . in three spacetime dimensions",
    "( with for instance boundary conditions that identify space - time with @xmath23 ) configurations of the @xmath29 field may be classified by an integer ` winding number ' corresponding to @xmath43 .",
    "the winding number is expressed in terms of the @xmath29 field through @xmath44 it is then possible to consider adding a topological berry phase term to the action @xmath45 which gives different weights to the different topological sectors parametrized by @xmath46 .",
    "thus consider @xmath47 the physics is clearly periodic under @xmath48 .",
    "the system is parity and time reversal invariant for @xmath49 or @xmath6 .",
    "now we will show that a derivation of such a theory with a four - component field for the coupled spin chains naturally lead to the sigma model at @xmath6",
    ". our derivation will closely follow haldane s well - known derivation of the @xmath4 sigma model field theory with the @xmath5 term for _ one dimensional _",
    "spin chains starting from the microscopic path integral for a single quantum spin . here",
    "we will start instead from the wzw theory for each spin chain , and then derive a two dimensional continuum field theory for the field @xmath29 .",
    "we start from the decoupled chain limit in which each chain is described by the @xmath7 level 1 theory .",
    "we then include interchain couplings for the slow modes of this theory .",
    "consider therefore the following action for the coupled chains : @xmath50\\\\ s_2 & = & \\int dx d\\tau \\sum_y [ u \\vec{\\phi}(x , \\tau , y).\\vec{\\phi}(x , \\tau , y+1 ) \\\\ & & -v \\phi_0(x , \\tau , y)\\phi_0(x,\\tau , y+1)]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath51 is the continuous coordinate along the chain direction , @xmath52 is an integer labelling the different chains , and @xmath8 is the @xmath7 matrix field which enters the description of each chain . the action @xmath53 $ ] is the @xmath7 level 1 wzw action summed over all the chains .",
    "the term @xmath54 in the action is the interchain coupling .",
    "it has been written in terms of the four component vector @xmath29 .",
    "the couplings @xmath55 .",
    "we have assumed there is an antiferromagnetic coupling of the neel order parameter ( @xmath56 ) between two neighboring chains , and a ferromagnetic coupling between the vbs orders ( @xmath57 ) .",
    "this is completely appropriate to describe the competition between @xmath37 neel order and @xmath38 columnar vbs order in the two dimensional problem .",
    "it is useful to first consider the simple limit where @xmath58 and then to perturb around this limit .",
    "when @xmath58 the action has extra global @xmath1 symmetry that is broken to @xmath59 when @xmath60 . at @xmath58 ,",
    "we can write @xmath54 as @xmath61 this tends to prefer a ` staggered ' ordering of the @xmath8 perpendicular to the chains where @xmath8 for even chains is the inverse of that for the odd chains . we therefore write @xmath62 and take the continuum limit with @xmath63 assumed to vary slowly in both spatial directions .",
    "the first term in @xmath64 has a simple continuum form : @xmath65 the continuum form of the wzw term requires some work .",
    "substituting eqn .",
    "[ contpar ] , we get @xmath66\\ ] ] this alternating sum can now be evaluated analogous to haldane s calculation in @xmath42 .",
    "first write it as @xmath67 - \\gamma[g(y-1)])\\ ] ] each term is the difference in volume in @xmath23 bounded by the surfaces traced out by @xmath68 and @xmath69 . with @xmath63 smoothly varying the full sum over @xmath52",
    "can then be related to the total volume in @xmath23 swept out by @xmath70 .",
    "specifically we get @xmath71 this is precisely the @xmath1 model at @xmath6 as may be seen by writing the @xmath7 matrix @xmath63 in terms of the four - component @xmath29 field .",
    "taking @xmath60 introduces some anisotropy in the model which lowers the symmetry to @xmath59 .",
    "let us now study this model in the presence of such weak anisotropy .",
    "consider defect configurations of the @xmath4 vector field @xmath72 . in three space - time dimensions these are hedgehogs . in the core of the hedgehog the magnitude of @xmath72 is suppressed . in the present model",
    "this means that the @xmath29 vector points along the @xmath73 direction in the core .",
    "clearly we can distinguish two different kinds of hedgehogs depending on whether @xmath57 is positive or negative in the core .",
    "these hedgehogs are very analogous to meron - vortices in @xmath4 models with weak easy plane anisotropy",
    ". therefore we will refer to these as meron - hedgehogs .",
    "each meron hedgehog may be regarded as one half of a point defect of the @xmath1 model with non - zero @xmath46 .",
    "thus for elementary meron hedgehogs we have @xmath74 depending on the sign of @xmath57 in the core . the topological @xmath5 term then gives a berry phase @xmath75 associated with each meron hedgehog .",
    "let us now study various phases of the anisotropic @xmath1 model .",
    "when the @xmath4 vector orders ( the neel phase ) the meron hedgehogs or their berry phases play very little role in the low energy physics .",
    "consider now phases where the neel vector is disordered .",
    "this may be usefully discussed in terms of a three dimensional coulomb gas of meron hedgehogs which interact with each other through @xmath76 interactions and where appropriate berry phase factors are associated with the hedgehogs .",
    "the action for this coulomb gas takes the form @xmath77 here @xmath33 is the site of some three dimensional space - time lattice .",
    "@xmath78 are integers corresponding to the number of the two kind of @xmath79 hedgehogs at site @xmath33 .",
    "the first term is a hedgehog core action .",
    "the second term is the berry phase . in the last term @xmath80 is the total hedgehog number at any site @xmath33 .",
    "this term describes the interhedgehog three dimensional coulomb interaction with @xmath81 . as usual",
    "an equivalent sine gordon theory is readily obtained by decoupling the interaction with a potential @xmath82 and summing over the integers @xmath83 .",
    "it is easy to see that the resulting action takes the form @xmath84 here @xmath85 creates a strength-@xmath13 hedgehog .",
    "we thus see that only even strength hedgehogs appear in this sine gordon theory .",
    "the berry phases have lead to a doubling of the hedgehogs .",
    "the doubled hedgehogs proliferate at long scales in this paramagnetic phase .",
    "this leads to a two - fold degenerate ground state ( the two ground states being distinguished by the expectation value of the single hedgehog operator ) .",
    "thus phases that have unbroken @xmath4 symmetry of the anisotropic @xmath1 model at @xmath6 necesarily has a two - fold ground state degeneracy .    to understand better the nature of these @xmath4 symmetric phases in the particular microscopic realization of weakly coupled chains",
    "let us study the role of various discrete symmetries .",
    "in particular we must distinguish between parity transformations @xmath86 along the chain direction ( the @xmath51-direction ) and the one perpendicular to the chains .",
    "microscopically the @xmath87 symmetry involves @xmath88 _ together _ with @xmath89 .",
    "for the hedgehogs this then implies @xmath90 , @xmath91 . under @xmath92",
    "we have @xmath93 .    in the smooth ground states of the sine - gordon model the possible values of @xmath82 depend on the @xmath94 .",
    "if @xmath95 is the dominant coupling then @xmath96 prefers @xmath97 so that @xmath87 is broken while @xmath92 is preserved .",
    "we may identify this with the @xmath98 columnar dimer state . on",
    "the other hand @xmath99 prefers @xmath100 so that @xmath92 is broken while @xmath87 is preserved .",
    "this may actually be identified with the @xmath101 columnar dimer state ( _ i.e _ vertical dimers between the chains ) .",
    "it is interesting that though we derived the sigma model focussing on the competition between neel and the @xmath98 vbs state it is still capable of describing the @xmath102 vbs state as well .",
    "all of this is completely consistent with results known from the earlier direct analysis of the @xmath4 sigma model with berry phases appropriate for a two dimensional lattice with rectangular symmetry .",
    "thus the superspin @xmath1 formulation with the @xmath5 term correctly captures the neel - vbs competition in this system .",
    "finally we note that spin-@xmath2 magnets on lattices with rectangular symmetry are not expected to have trivial featurless paramagnetic phases that also preserve all lattice symmetries .",
    "non - trivial paramagnetic phases such as spin liquids with topological order are however possible .",
    "this then implies that the @xmath1 model at @xmath6 in the presence of @xmath59 anisotropy will also not possess simple phases which break no symmetry .",
    "any such symmetry unbroken phase must necesarrily also have some hidden order ( such as topological order ) .",
    "we now turn our attention to spin-@xmath2 quantum magnets on isotropic two dimensional square lattices . here",
    "apart from the well - known neel state , paramagnetic vbs states are again possible .",
    "in contrast to the quasi - two dimensional case here the vbs state will have a four fold ground state degeneracy .",
    "a superspin description of the neel - vbs competition was recently derived by tanaka and hu@xcite .",
    "here we first very briefly review their derivation from a slightly different perspective . in the presence of some easy plane anisotropy for the neel vector",
    "we explicitly show the equivalence to the spinon - gauge field theory proposed in ref . for the deconfined critical point between these two ordered phases .",
    "the appropriate spinon - gauge field theory involves gapless bosonic spinons coupled to a gapless non - compact @xmath12 gauge field and has been dubbed the non - compact @xmath103 ( nccp@xmath104 ) model@xcite .",
    "consider a half - filled hubbard model on a two dimensional square lattice with @xmath105 flux through each square plaquette described by the hamiltonian @xmath106 here @xmath107 are spinful electron operators at sites @xmath108 of a square lattice .",
    "the @xmath109 are chosen to have @xmath105 flux through each plaquette .",
    "a specific choice is @xmath110 for horizontal bonds and @xmath111 for vertical bonds .",
    "the @xmath8 term is the usual onsite hubbard repulsion . at @xmath112",
    "the band structure is well - known and consists of four fermi points ( at @xmath113 ) in the brillouin zone of the square lattice .",
    "the electron dispersion is linear in the vicinity of these points .",
    "the low energy physics may be described in terms of a continuum dirac theory that focuses on the modes near these fermi points . for @xmath114 write @xmath115 with @xmath116 , and @xmath117 .",
    "then the continuum hamiltonian reads @xmath118 here @xmath119 and each @xmath120 is a two - component dirac spinor .",
    "the pauli matrices @xmath121 act on the dirac index .",
    "the index @xmath122 labels the node and @xmath123 labels the physical spin .",
    "the corresponding action ( after letting @xmath124 ) is @xmath125 where we have defined @xmath126 .",
    "at small @xmath8 the interactions renormalize to zero and a semi - metallic state is stable . as @xmath8 is increased there will be a metal - insulator transition where the fermions acquire a charge gap . in the resulting insulator",
    "it is expected that in some parameter ranges a simple neel state will emerge . in other",
    "parameter ranges a valence bond solid state may well be stabilized .",
    "either insulator may conveniently be described starting from the hubbard model in a hartree - fock description that builds in a non - zero value for the appropriate order parameter . to describe the competition between these two kinds of ordered insulators",
    ", we will introduce fields that couple to either order parameter and integrate out the fermions to obtain effective sigma model descriptions .",
    "it is easy to see that the neel vector coresponds to the fermion bilinear @xmath127 where @xmath128 are pauli matrices in the node index .",
    "the vbs order parameter @xmath129 corresponds to @xmath130 . to access either insulating phase",
    "we therefore include the terms @xmath131\\ ] ] to begin with we will assume that @xmath132 for simplicity .",
    "later we will add anisotropy between the neel and vbs fluctuations .",
    "this term may be decoupled with a 5-component hubbard stratonovich field @xmath133 .",
    "we therefore get @xmath134 here @xmath135 are a set of five @xmath136 matrices defined through @xmath137 note that @xmath138_+ = 2\\delta_{\\alpha\\beta}$ ] and @xmath139 .",
    "equivalently the phase diagram and universal aspects of the various phases will be preserved by restricting the @xmath140 vector to have unit magnitude .",
    "we thus consider the action @xmath141 the hartree - fock aproximation to the insulating phases consists of giving @xmath29 some non - zero mean value which gaps out the fermions . to access these insulators while including fluctuation effects we integrate out the @xmath142 assuming that @xmath143 is large .",
    "the resulting fermion determinant has been evaluated by abanov and wiegmann@xcite and gives @xmath144 = \\int d^3x \\frac{1}{2 g } \\left(\\partial_i \\hat{\\phi } \\right)^2 - 2\\pi i \\gamma[\\hat{\\phi}]\\ ] ] this takes the form of a non - linear sigma model for the superspin vector @xmath29 that combines the neel and vbs order parameters .",
    "the crucial feature is the presence of the second term - this is a wess - zumino - witten term for the 5-component unit vector field @xmath29 and is defined as follows .",
    "the field @xmath29 defines a map from @xmath23 to @xmath145 .",
    "the fraction of the total volume of @xmath145 that is bounded by the hypersurface traced out by @xmath29 defines @xmath21 .",
    "specifically let @xmath146 be any smooth extension of @xmath147 such that @xmath148 and @xmath149 .",
    "then @xmath150 thus the neel - vbs competition for spin-@xmath2 magnets on an isotropic two dimensional square lattice is described by this @xmath151 superspin non - linear sigma model with the extra topological wzw term .",
    "this sigma model must be supplemented with an anisotropy that reduces the symmetry to @xmath152 where the @xmath153 corresponds to spin rotation and the @xmath12 rotates between the two components of the vbs order parameter .",
    "further microscopically this @xmath12 symmetry must have further anisotropy that reduces the symmetry to @xmath154",
    ".    in their original derivation tanaka and hu viewed the @xmath105 flux state as a fermionic spinon mean field theory for heisenberg spin magnets .",
    "their subsequent calculations are identical to what we described above .",
    "however from that point of view it becomes important to include gauge fluctuations before establishing a firm connection to the original quantum magnet flux state this involves coupling the fermionic spinons to a gapless @xmath7 gauge field ] .",
    "here we have sidestepped this issue by considering the hubbard model on the square lattice with @xmath105 flux as our starting point .",
    "there is no question of introducing extra fluctuating gauge fields from this point of view .",
    "note that once the system enters the insulating phase the spin physics at energy scales below the charge gap may be described ( in principle ) in terms of a short ranged spin model of spin-@xmath2 moments .",
    "thus the @xmath105-flux hubbard model as a microscopic starting point is very convenient to derive an effective theory to describe the neel - vbs competition in two dimensional quantum magnets .",
    "we now show the equivalence of the superspin sigma model with the wzw term to the nccp@xmath104 model in ref . for the deconfined critical point between the neel and vbs states .",
    "we will do this in the specific case where there is large easy plane anisotropy on the neel vector so that it points primarily in the @xmath155 plane in spin space .",
    "to handle this case we write @xmath156 with @xmath157 a four component unit vector . here",
    "@xmath158 is a two component vector which denotes the direction of the neel vector in spin space . with this restriction the wess - zumino term in the action",
    "can be evaluated straightforwardly and simply becomes @xmath159 where @xmath46 is the by now familiar index describing the winding of the unit four vector field @xmath160 in three space - time dimensions .",

    "it can be reinstated without any major changes if necessary and in any case has been argued to be irrelevant at the deconfined critical fixed point . ]",
    "the topological term again plays a crucial role . to expose its role",
    "let us warm up by considering some simple configurations of the @xmath160 field .",
    "it will be useful to view it as a two component complex vector @xmath162 with @xmath163 complex numbers satisfying @xmath164 .",
    "the topological index @xmath46 is readily writen in terms of derivatives of @xmath165 .",
    "an equivalent form is obtained by considering the  vector potential \" @xmath166 some algebra shows that @xmath167 as a topological index @xmath46 is invariant under smooth continuous deformations of @xmath168 . as a particular example",
    "a smooth gauge transformation @xmath169 changes @xmath170 to @xmath171 .",
    "the integral for @xmath46 above is clearly invariant under such a gauge transformation .",
    "consider first configurations where @xmath172 with @xmath173 a smooth single valued function of @xmath51 , and @xmath174 arbitrary .",
    "this means that that there are no vortices anywhere in the complex field @xmath175",
    ". then the gauge transformation @xmath176 makes @xmath175 real everywhere .",
    "it is clear then that for such configurations @xmath177 ( as with @xmath175 real one component of @xmath160 vanishes everywhere ) .",
    "the same result obviously also holds for configurations where there are no vortices anywhere in @xmath174 but @xmath175 is arbitrary .",
    "thus @xmath46 is non - zero only if there are vortices in both @xmath175 and @xmath174 .    to construct a configuration with non - zero @xmath46",

    "this implies that whenever a @xmath175-vortex moves fully around a @xmath174-vortex ( or vice versa ) there is a phase factor of @xmath105 . in other words",
    "the @xmath175 and @xmath174 vortices are mutually non - local and see each other as sources of @xmath105-flux .",
    "it is now straightforward to see the equivalence to the easy - plane nccp@xmath104 action .",
    "indeed the vortices in @xmath175 are just the @xmath196 vortices in the easy plane neel order parameter .",
    "the @xmath105 phase shift that these vortices acquire when taken around the vortices in @xmath174 suggests that the latter may be thought of as spin-@xmath2 spinons .",

    "for instance for the @xmath209-vortex the hopping term becomes @xmath210 a sum over the integer vortex currents @xmath211 is implied .",
    "the integration over @xmath212 as usual implies the current conservation condition @xmath213 the sum over the ising variable @xmath214 may also be performed and leads to the constraint @xmath215 thus the presence of a @xmath209-vortex is seen as @xmath105 flux by the @xmath13-vortex .",
    "thus the term @xmath208 precisely implements the mutual @xmath105 statistics of the two vortices .    in the neel phase the vortex @xmath216 is gapped while the @xmath209-vortex is condensed ( with the reverse being true in the vbs phase ) . at a putative second order transition between the two",

    "the other @xmath217 is realized non - trivial as a topological symmetry associated with the conservation of the photon .",
    "in this section we will consider massless @xmath0 in @xmath219 dimensions .",
    "this consists of @xmath3 two - component dirac fermions @xmath142 coupled to a fluctuating non - compact @xmath12 gauge field @xmath220 with the action @xmath221 the @xmath222 are pauli matrices .",

    "this scale invariant theory has slow power law correlations for a set of gauge invariant fermion bilinears that transform as adjoints under the @xmath15 .",
    "can we dispense with the gauge description completely in favor of some sort of sigma model decription in terms of these slow fluctuations ? as discussed in previous sections",

    "here we study the specific case @xmath17 in @xmath224 and show that a sigma model description is again possible provided topological terms are included .",
    "for @xmath17 the fermions transform with spin-@xmath2 under the global @xmath7 symmetry .",
    "it is expected that the gauge invariant @xmath7 vector @xmath225 will have slow correlations , and perhaps might even generically order . to expose its effects let us add the following term to the action @xmath226 with @xmath227 .",
    "this term may be decoupled with a fluctuating @xmath10 field to get a term of the form @xmath228 equivalently the phase diagram and universal aspects of the various phases will be preserved by restricting the @xmath10 vector to have unit magnitude .",

    "we assume space - time to be @xmath23 . the resulting fermion determinant has been calculated ( in a @xmath232 expansion ) by abanov and wiegmann@xcite and leads to the following remarkable result : @xmath233\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath234 in @xmath45 .",
    "the @xmath235 is the topological current density of the @xmath236 field , _",

    "@xmath241 $ ] .",
    "then @xmath242 in the absence of the coupling to the gauge field , the hopf term changes the spin and statistics of the skyrmion .",
    "note that the gauge field @xmath170 couples to the skyrmion current density of the @xmath236 vector .",
    "therefore at long scales the skyrmion density is pinned at zero .",
    "thus the resulting model is the three dimensional @xmath4 vector model where skyrmion configurations have been suppressed .",
    "this leads to enlargement of the degrees of freedom to a four component field and the symmetry to @xmath1 . to see this",
    "most simply , rewrite the @xmath4 sigma model above in the @xmath103 representation .",
    "we have @xmath243 we may now integrate over the gauge field @xmath220 .",
    "this is conveniently done by choosing a gauge where @xmath244 is transverse ( _ i.e _ @xmath245 ) .",
    "we get @xmath246 thus the @xmath103 gauge field @xmath244 has been rendered massive due to the coupling to the fluctuating gauge field @xmath220 . at long distances and low energies",
    "we may thus drop the gauge field altogether .",
    "( strictly speaking we should just integrate out the gauge field to generate a term that is quartic in the @xmath165 fields and involves two derivatives - this term is expected to be irrelevant at the critical point of the resulting theory . a similar result was established in ref .",
    "@xcite in the absence of the topological term ) .",
    "the action @xmath247 then becomes @xmath248 which has @xmath1 symmetry as can be made manifest by rewriting in terms of the real and imaginary parts of the two components of @xmath165 .",
    "what happens of the hopf term ?",
    "clearly @xmath249 is invariant both under independent left and right multiplications by constant @xmath7 matrices .",
    "thus it too is @xmath1 invariant .",
    "a simple calculation shows that the hopf invariant @xmath238 is exactly equal to @xmath46 where @xmath46 is the topological index characterizing configurations of an @xmath1 unit vector field in three dimensions .",
    "thus the action reduces to the @xmath1 model at @xmath6 .    note that in the @xmath1 symmetry broken phase there are three gapless linear dispersing modes . in the gauge theory description",
    "this corresponds to broken chiral symmetry with @xmath250 . here",
    "again there are three gapless linear dispersing modes - two are spin waves in @xmath236 while the third is simply the gapless photon .",
    "a somewhat similar possible duality between massless @xmath17 @xmath0 and the usual critical @xmath1 model was conjectured recently in ref .",
    "using very different arguments .",
    "our derivation shows that such a duality indeed exists but necessarily includes the topological term .",
    "does the topological term make any difference to the properties of the model ?",
    "we turn to this question in the following subsection .",
    "what may we say about the properties of the _ isotropic _ ( _ i.e _ @xmath1 symmetric ) model at @xmath6 from the analysis in this paper ?",
    "first we expect that a phase with broken @xmath1 symmetry is stable for weak coupling .",
    "the @xmath5 term presumably plays very little role at low energies in this phase as it only affects topological configurations that cost large energy . at strong coupling paramagnetic phases where",
    "@xmath1 symmetry is preserved are presumably possible .",
    "the arguments in previous sections show that a trivial featureless paramagnet can not exist . to see this first assume that such a paramagnetic phase can indeed exist .",
    "then turn on a small anisotropy that breaks the @xmath1 symmetry to @xmath59 .",
    "such an anisotropy will have no effect on the ground state of such a trivial paramagnet - but the arguments of section [ quasi1d ] shows that such trivial paramagnetic ground states do not exist in the anisotropic model .",
    "thus such states are forbidden for the isotropic model as well .",
    "what are the possibilities then ?",
    "gapped phases can exist if the ground state has topological order .",
    "gapless paramagnetic states are also not precluded by these arguments .",
    "similar and more interesting conclusions may also be drawn by considering weak @xmath161 anisotropy ( instead of @xmath251 ) . first note that with this anisotropy the model has an extra @xmath203 symmetry that interchanges the two @xmath217 symmetries .",
    "it is clear that this is exactly equivalent to the motrunich - vishwanath self - duality symmetry@xcite of the equivalent easy plane nccp@xmath104 model .",
    "we can now discuss the phase diagram of the @xmath6 @xmath1 model with weak @xmath161 anisotropy in terms of the known phases and phase transitions of models with the same field content as the easy plane nccp@xmath104 model .",
    "first consider the @xmath1 ordered phase . with the @xmath161 anisotropy",
    "this becomes the location of a first order ` spin flop ' transition between phases that separately break either of the two distinct @xmath217 symmetries .",
    "what about phases that preserve @xmath252 symmetry ?",
    "here there are two possibilities .",
    "first the self - dual second order deconfined critical line of the easy plane nccp@xmath104 appears as a paramagnetic _ phase _ of the sigma model .",
    "thus this is a concrete example of the possibility of a gapless strong coupling paramagnetic phase at @xmath6 in the @xmath1 model ( albeit with some @xmath161 anisotropy ) .",
    "it is concievable that the self - dual critical manifold of the easy plane nccp@xmath104 admits a special multicrtitical point with higher @xmath1 symmetry .",
    "the existence of such a fixed point would imply the possibility of a gapless paramagnetic phase at @xmath6 with full @xmath1 symmetry .",
    "the other possibility that preserves full @xmath161 symmetry is a gapped @xmath203 topologically ordered paramagnet which coresponds to the @xmath203 spin liquid allowed in the lattice easy plane spin-@xmath2 antiferromagnet .",
    "this phase should persist with full @xmath1 symmetry as well .    in view of the above",
    "it seems clear that the transitions out of the ordered phases with @xmath161 anisotropy would be in a different universality class from those in a model without the @xmath5 term . with full @xmath1 symmetry",
    "it thus seems rather likely that at @xmath6 the transition is in a different universaity class from that at @xmath49 .",
    "in this paper we have provided a number of examples illustrating how the physics of two dimensional spin-@xmath2 quantum magnets can in principle be described in ` superspin ' sigma models that describe the slow competing orders . as such these are as close that one might get to a landau - ginzburg description of these competing orders .",
    "an important feature of these sigma models is the presence of topological terms which reflect the underlying quantum nature of the spins . from the conventional point of view",
    "it is these topological terms that complicate a direct application of naive landau - ginzburg - wilson(lgw ) thinking to quantum magnetism .",
    "thus they are at the root of the failure of the lgw paradigm in describing various quantum phases and phase transitions .",
    "the sigma model formulations provide a potential alternate to the gauge theoretic descriptions that have been used thus far to describe the non - lgw physics .",
    "however as things stand we know even less about how to handle the effects of topological terms than we know about gauge theories .",
    "so it is at present not clear how useful the sigma model will be .",
    "finally our results raise the possibility of such a sigma model description for stable algebraic spin liquids in two dimensions ( of which the @xmath253 state popular in cuprate physics may be a possible example ) .",
    "these also have slow power law corelations in a number of physical observables .",
    "the results on @xmath17 massless @xmath0 provide some positive hints .",
    "stronger evidence is the sigma model description of the deconfined neel - vbs critical point .",
    "these may be thought of as a special kind of algebraic spin liquid that has one relevant perturbation . in the gauge theory description",
    "they have gapless bosonic matter fields coupled to a non - compact @xmath12 gauge field .",
    "as these theories seem to have sigma model descriptions perhaps their fermionic cousins do as well . perhaps such descriptions might even be useful !",
