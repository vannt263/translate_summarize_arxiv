    "one of the recurring themes in surface photochemistry on metal surfaces is the almost ubiquitous contribution that photoelectrons make to the observed photochemical processes . in particular ,",

    "this rather smooth energy distribution can interact with the relevant electron affinity levels of the adsorbate system .",
    "if one is particularly interested in the dissociation of molecules via dissociative electron attachment ( dea ) , then one would expect that the convolution of the @xmath3 with the @xmath4 will yield a flux of desorbing species that arises from a relatively wide range of photoelectron energies ( roughly the width of @xmath5 for energies a few ev above @xmath2 ) .",
    "one can inquire if there are mechanisms that will modify this nascent energy distribution in particular , can the photoelectron energy distributions be narrowed to be more selective in the dissociation of adsorbed species . a related question has to do with electron transport in thin molecular films and how the electrons in these films can interact with other species- again , are there physical systems that will be highly selective in the interactions between co - adsorbed molecules ?",
    "one approach was first detailed on theoretical grounds by rous@xcite who considered how an incoming electron might couple with the electron affinity levels of a @xmath6 molecule near a metal surface to vibrationally excite the molecule .",
    "it was shown by application of a kkr calculation that the electron affinity level @xmath7 would display a strong enhancement by resonance with electron image states of the surface system .    in order to form such an image state and have an image state lifetime sufficient to yield a significant enhancement ,",
    "one requirement is that the surface have a bandgap at the relevant electron energy ( typically e@xmath8 - 0.5ev relative to @xmath9 for the _ n_=1 state ) , which does indeed occur for a number of low index metal surfaces .",
    "a practical complication is that these image states on clean metal surfaces have been found to be very sensitive to contamination effects rather small concentrations of some adsorbates on metal surfaces have been found to open decay channels that suppress the image state @xcite .",
    "a different approach is to take advantage of image states that can be formed at dielectric surfaces- these were first described in detail by cole and cohen@xcite and were subsequently observed using microwave spectroscopy on _ l_-he",
    "surfaces@xcite . more recent work on image states at dielectric thin films has been in the context of characterizing the energies and lifetimes of these states using femtosecond two - photon photoemission ( fs-2ppe ) spectroscopy . in general terms ,",
    "molecules having negative electron affinities ( i.e. repulsive for low energy electrons ) in thin layers form a bandgap that encompasses the image state energies ( i.e. the energy region just below @xmath9 ) . in qualitative terms , the decay of these electron image states is dominated by the transmission probability through the barrier , a barrier that increases the lifetimes roughly exponentially with film thickness .",
    "there is now a substantial body of work on the effect of thin films interacting with intrinsic metal image states for both the case of available conduction band states at the image state energies ( image state resonance , e.g. kr and xe on cu(100)@xcite ) and pure image electron barrier layers ( e.g. thin alkane layers@xcite ) on various metal surfaces .",

    "when these molecules are adsorbed at a metal or dielectric surface , the anion state is shifted downward in energy and the threshold electron energy for dea decreases and the survival probability for the anion increases , so that in general the peak dea cross section is at lower electron energy and has a substantially larger magnitude .",

    "one more possibility to consider is that the ch@xmath0br dissociation is due to dea from an interface electron state _ inside _ the _ n_-hexane layer ( similar to states identified in ar thin films@xcite ) , and the rapid rise in the 2ml4ml region is due to the exclusion of this state from the thinner films . sustaining such",

    "also when experiments were performed on cu(100)-i or cu(100)-cl the maximum signal was seen for much thinner films ( 12ml ) so we do not believe that such an interface electron state in _ n_-hexane is responsible for the observed dissociation .    if the observed photodissociation of adsorbed ch@xmath0br is mediated by an image state electron intermediate , then one expectation would be that this photodissociation would be very efficient for even a small submonolayer of the dissociating species .",

    "these image state electrons can interact with the co - adsorbed ch@xmath0x and cause dissociation via the dea mechanism .",
    "the ch@xmath0 photofragments detected in the tof experiment have a translational energy distribution that is insensitive to the incident photon energy and the yields of ch@xmath0 are indicative of the image state mediated mechanism .",
    "this mechanism is likely to be viable for a number of molecular systems , as a wide variety of molecules have the requisite negative electron affinity and bandgap to create such image states , and there are also many molecules which undergo various chemical processes due to interactions with very low energy electrons .",

    "<S> the 248 nm and 193 nm photodissociation of submonolayer quantities of ch@xmath0br and ch@xmath0i adsorbed on thin layers of _ n_-hexane indicate that the dissociation is caused by dissociative electron attachment from sub - vacuum level photoelectrons created in the copper substrate . </S>",
    "<S> the characteristics of this photodissociation translation energy distributions and coverage dependences show that the dissociation is mediated by an image potential state which temporarily traps the photoelectrons near the _ n_-hexane  vacuum interface , and then the charge transfers from this image state to the affinity level of a co - adsorbed halomethane which then dissociates . </S>"
