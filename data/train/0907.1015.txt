    "the optical layout of geo600 , the german - british gravitational - wave detector , differs in an essential way from that of ligo and virgo , the two other working gravitational - wave interferometers . in both ligo and",
    "virgo each of the arms consists of a high - quality fabry - perot cavity , where most of the light power is concentrated , while the beamsplitter is located outside of both cavities .",
    "by contrast , in geo600 the light , after passing the beamsplitter , is processed only once through each of the doubly - folded arms @xcite .",
    "therefore , geo600 is much more sensitive to the noise originating at the beamsplitter than its ligo / virgo counterparts .",
    "the beamsplitter in the geo600 laser interferometer induces a difference in the optical path lengths between the interferometer s two arms since one of the beams is transmitted through the beamsplitter twice while is the other is being reflected from its surface .",
    "this difference in the optical path length can be modified by a change in the refractive index of the beamsplitter due to random fluctuations of temperature in the refracting material . as braginsky , gorodetsky , and vyatchanin",
    "have shown @xcite , the temperature fluctuations result from a random heat flow between different parts of the refractive medium . since the interrogating beam is not homogeneous but has a gaussian profile",
    "the inhomogeneous temperature fluctuations produce a net ( fluctuating ) change in the transmitted beam s phase which is seen as noise in the overall output of the instrument . for a circular gaussian beam ,",
    "braginsky and vyatchanin @xcite have computed the following spectral density of this thermo - refractive noise expressed as an equivalent change in the end mirror s position @xmath3 : @xmath4 here , @xmath5 is boltzmann s constant , @xmath6 the thermal conductivity ,",
    "@xmath7 the temperature , @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the refractive index , @xmath10 is the beamsplitter s thickness , @xmath11 the specific heat , @xmath12 the density and @xmath13 is the beam s radius defined in terms of the beam intensity , so that @xmath14 .",
    "the expression in eq .",
    "( [ bvresult ] ) has been used to estimate the thermo - refractive noise in the geo600 beamsplitter @xcite .",
    "however , inside the geo600 beamsplitter , the beam is not circular : the @xmath15 angle of incidence and the refractive index @xmath16 of fused silica introduces ellipticity of the beam .",
    "the ratio of the major and minor axes of the beam s elliptical crossection is given by @xmath17 , while the minor axis equals the width of the original beam .",
    "more importantly , the beam is not homogeneous in the longitudinal direction since a standing wave is formed in the beamsplitter as a result of the beam s reflection from the end mirror .",
    "the changes in the material s refractive index @xcite close to the nodes of the electric - field intensity have less effect on the wave s phase than changes in the antinodes . therefore , random thermal fluctuations on the scale of the light wavelength are important , making for a much higher level of noise at frequencies higher than @xmath18 hz than the bv result would suggest .    in this paper",
    "we derive the expression for the thermo - refractive noise with these corrections taken into account .",
    "we obtain the following result : @xmath19   \\label{result}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath20 is the optical pathlength through the beamsplitter , where @xmath21 is the angle between the beam axis and the normal to the beamsplitter , @xmath22 is the wavevector and @xmath23 is the thermal diffusion length .",

    ".parameter values taken from @xcite [ cols=\"^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the first term on the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ result ] ) is the contribution due to the transverse elliptic profile of the beam , and it agrees with the result in @xcite for @xmath24 , while the second term is due to the presence of the standing wave . it is common to express the noise amplitude in terms of the dimensionless metric @xmath25 for easy comparison to other sources .",
    "figure [ plot ] is a plot of @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the interferometers _ unfolded _ armlength and figure [ plot2 ] is a comparison to the measured noise spectrum and the previous estimate for the beamsplitter thermo - refractive noise @xcite .    at a typical gravitational wave frequency of 100 hz",
    "the noise amplitude is @xmath28hz@xmath2 . for low frequencies the effect of",
    "the standing wave is negligible and we have the @xmath29 dependence , consistent with the previous calculations .",
    "however , for higher frequencies the standing - wave contribution takes over and the noise spectrum becomes white between @xmath30hz and @xmath31mhz with an amplitude @xmath32hz@xmath2 . at the latter frequency",
    "the thermal diffusion length becomes comparable to the wavelength of the beam light , and the @xmath29 dependence is recovered but at much higher value than would be predicted by the bv formula .",
    "the foundation of this analysis is direct method @xcite for calculating thermo - refractive noise .",
    "the relevant readout variable is the phase of the output beam , translated into a change in the end mirror s position @xmath3 .",
    "it is a fairly straightforward calculation to show @xmath33 where the integral is over the beamsplitter s volume @xmath34 , @xmath35 is the temperature fluctuation at @xmath36 , and @xmath37 is the form - factor given , taking the elliptic gaussian beam and standing wave into account , by @xmath38\\sin^2(kz ) .",

    "periodically inject entropy into the medium with volume density @xmath39 2 .",
    "calculate the dissipated power @xmath40 as a result of this entropy injection .",
    "+ to do the latter , we solve the heat equation @xmath41 while keeping in mind that : * the solution is periodic with frequency @xmath42 * the wavelength is much smaller than the beamsplitter thickness so we can ignore boundary effects * the diffusion of the osscilating temperature in the transverse direction is negligible , giving @xmath43 , since @xmath44 for all frequencies of interest .",
    "+ the dissipated power is then computed by using the standard expression @xmath45 taken from e.g.  landau and lifshitz @xcite , where @xmath46 denotes the time average over one period .",
    "3 .   calculate the spectral density of the noise in @xmath3 using the fluctuation dissipation theorem @xcite , @xcite : @xmath47    these three steps lead directly to the main result in eq .",
    "( [ result ] ) .",
    "the small scale of the wavelength opens up the possibility for a new type of thermal noise which has not yet been considered .",
    "the fused silica used for contemporary beamsplitters contains minute quantities of contaminants such as oh ions , cl ions and other defects which have an effect on the refractive index depending on their concentration .",
    "as these optically - active contaminants diffuse up and down the steep gradient of the standing - wave electric - field intensity , they cause fluctuations of the overall beam s phaseshift .",
    "lets compute this thermo - chemical noise .",
    "let @xmath48 be the fluctuating volume concentration of the optically active impurities .",
    "the optical path change due to these impurities is given by @xmath49 where @xmath50 and @xmath37 is given by eq .",
    "[ formfac ] .",
    "we can follow our earlier treatment of thermal noise @xcite and calculate the dissipated power in the system under the hamiltonian @xmath51 this can be easily done by recalling that the formal expression for @xmath48 is @xmath52 where @xmath53 are the positions of individual optical impurities . then",
    ", under the action of the above hamiltonian , each impurity experiences a force @xmath54 under the action of this force , the impurity drifts and energy is dissipated .",
    "we assume that the impurities achieve their terminal drift velocity @xmath55 on a timescale much shorter than the frequencies of interest , and use einstein s relation @xcite @xmath56 to compute the drift velocity @xcite . here",
    "@xmath57 is the diffusion cofficient .",
    "the dissipated power per particle is @xmath58 ; summing over the particles and substituting the result into eq .",
    "( [ fdt ] ) yields @xmath59    taking values of suprasil 311 sv used in geo-600 for oh ions @xcite , @xmath60 and @xmath61 and estimating a value for @xmath57 from @xcite to be in the order of @xmath62 at room temperature we get @xmath63 at a frequency of 100 hz , suggesting that a simple version of the thermo - chemical noise is outside the realm of relevance for the geo600 interferometer",
    ". however , there may be other optically - active mobile impurities ( e.g. , small structural defects or localized 2-state systems ) in glass that have not yet been considered .",
    "potential presence of such impurities must be thoroughly investigated in future work .",
    "the calculations presented here demonstrate that the thermo - refractive fluctuations result in a noise floor which , while substantially below currently measured noise , may become important for future updates of the geo600 interferometer . the standing - wave contribution should be taken into account in all future calculations of the thermo - refractive noise from transmissive optics .    as a side product , we have identified a new type of thermal noise : the thermo - chemical noise , which is also enabled by the presence of the optical standing wave in the beamsplitter .",
    "the naive estimates of this noise , which are based on what is known about the chemical impurities in suprasil 311 , place it beyond the realm of concern .",
    "however , one needs to be vigilant about other types of mobile impurities which have not yet been identified , and which could potentially produce a higher thermo - chemical noise .",
