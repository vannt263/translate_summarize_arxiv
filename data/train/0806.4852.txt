    "during the last two decades the problem of controlling the coherent time evolution of quantum systems has received a great deal of attention both because it could lead to a deeper understanding of fundamental aspects of quantum mechanics and because it is of interest for applications @xcite .",
    "the possibility of generating and controlling non classical correlations ( i.e. entangled states ) in multipartite systems , despite their coupling with an external environment , is a fundamental ingredient for instance in the theory of quantum measurement and in the study of the border between the quantum world and the macroscopic classical world @xcite .",
    "in addition such a possibility is an essential goal in the field of quantum computing and quantum information theory @xcite .",
    "it is well known that the interaction of an open quantum system with an external reservoir is an important source of dissipation and decoherence . in order to describe such phenomena ,",
    "a master equation approach can be used @xcite . in particular , following ref .",
    "@xcite , one has at his disposal a general formalism allowing to derive the quantum master equation of a general quantum system , provided one knows the hamiltonian governing the unitary part of its dynamics .",
    "exploiting this recipe , one can see that the dissipative dynamics , in the born - markov and rotating wave approximations , is described by a master equation in which the quantum jumps occur among eigenstates of the hamiltonian of the open quantum system under scrutiny .",
    "this microscopic approach may be sometimes in contrast with some phenomenological approaches to quantum dissipative dynamics present in the literature , as one can see for example in refs .",
    "@xcite .    within this framework and with the aforementioned approach",
    ", here we analyze the dynamical behavior of the entanglement between two coupled two - state systems each of them interacting with a bosonic bath .",
    "the model is quite versatile and can be exploited , for instance , in order to describe the dipole - dipole ( flux or charge ) interaction of two distant atomic ( flux or charge ) qubits . in the case of josephson flux",
    "qubits the coupling term corresponds to a flux - flux coupling proportional to their mutual inductance @xcite .",
    "it is worth noting that the same model can be used to describe richer physical situations , for instance the coupling between a josephson junction based qubit in the charge regime with an impurity located in the substrate of the device @xcite . in this case",
    "the qubit can be thought as coupled with external environmental degrees of freedom describing the auxiliary circuitry ( necessary , for instance , for the qubit control and the redout ) which can be modeled as an infinite bath of harmonic oscillators , while the substrate impurity may interact with a phononic bath .",
    "starting from such a model of qubit - qubit interaction , and including counter - rotating terms in the system hamiltonian , we derive a quantum master equation in order to describe the dissipative dynamics of the two - qubit system , concentrating on some aspects such as the structure of the stationary state of the system and the time evolution of the entanglement between the two qubits .",
    "the entanglement dynamics of open bipartite quantum systems has been studied in previous works , for example in refs .",
    "@xcite , bringing to light important features such as the complete disentanglement of the system in a finite time ( entanglement sudden death ) , and , in the case of ref .",
    "@xcite , the sudden reappearance of entanglement ( sudden birth ) . in the latter case ,",
    "the presence of stationary entanglement for very long times has been related to the presence of a reservoir common to the two subsystems , so that the non - local correlations between them can be thought of as due to the mediation of the environment . in this paper",
    "we will show that stationary entanglement can occur also in the case wherein the two qubits interact with two independent reservoirs , provided the interaction between the two subsystems contains also counter - rotating terms , which are usually neglected in the literature .",
    "in such a case , the stationary entanglement occurs because the counter - rotating terms cause the ground state of the system to be an entangled state of the bipartite system .",
    "the paper is structured as follows . in section 2",
    "we introduce the model previously described and we microscopically derive the markovian master equation in the weak damping limit assuming that the two reservoir are independent and with arbitrary temperatures , @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "therefore , in section 4 , we analyze the dynamics of the system in the limit case @xmath2 discussing the stationary entanglement and the features of its time evolution considering different initial conditions for the bipartite system .",
    "finally , conclusive remarks are given in section 5 .",
    "let us consider two interacting two - level systems and let us call @xmath3 ( @xmath4 ) the ground state of the first ( second ) system and @xmath5 ( @xmath6 ) the corresponding excited state .",
    "let us assume that the two systems are coupled in such a way that their unitary dynamics is governed by the following hamiltonian ( in units of @xmath7 ) : @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the bohr frequency of the @xmath10-th two - level system , @xmath11 is the coupling constant and where we have used the pauli operators @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 , with @xmath15 . in the case of josephson flux qubits the coupling term in eq .",
    "( [ hamiltonianmodel ] ) corresponds to a flux - flux coupling with @xmath11 proportional to their mutual inductance @xcite .",
    "it is worth noting that in the hamiltonian also the counter - rotating terms of the interaction have been included and we will see that they play a central role in the dynamics of the entanglement between the two systems .    the model in eq .",
    "( [ hamiltonianmodel ] ) can be exactly diagonalized . by exploiting the fact that the hamiltonian @xmath16 in the uncoupled basis @xmath17 , where for instance @xmath18 , is block diagonal , it is straightforward to show that the eigenvalues ( given for increasing energies ) are : @xmath19 while the corresponding eigenstates are : @xmath20 here @xmath21 and the parameters @xmath22 and @xmath23 satisfy the relations : @xmath24    the losses in the system under scrutiny will be taken into account by considering the coupling between the @xmath10-th system and its own reservoir at temperature @xmath25 . in the following we will consider the case of independent bosonic reservoirs , whose temperatures , in the general case , can take different values .",
    "the total hamiltonian of the bipartite system and the reservoirs can thus be written as follows : @xmath26 here @xmath27 ( @xmath28 ) is the annihilation ( creation ) operator of the @xmath29-th mode ( of frequency @xmath30 ) of the reservoir interacting with the first subsystem and similarly @xmath31 ( @xmath32 ) is the annihilation ( creation ) operator of the @xmath33-th mode ( of frequency @xmath34 ) of the reservoir interacting with the second subsystem .",

    "figure 3 shows that , apart from the oscillations of the entanglement due to the oscillations of the excitation in the one - excitation subspace , the behaviour of the concurrence is characterized by the phenomena of sudden birth and sudden death of the entanglement already found by ficek and tanas @xcite for the scenario of two interacting qubits .",
    "while the phenomenon entanglement sudden death , i.e. , the complete disentanglement of the system in a finite time , is quite well understood and is a feature common to any dissipative two - qubits dynamics , provided the system starts from the proper initial state @xcite , the occurrence of stationary entanglement is a phenomenon usually ascribed to the presence of a reservoir which is common to the two parts of the bipartite system @xcite .",

    "to summarize , we have presented a microscopic derivation of the markovian master equation in the weak damping limit governing the time evolution of two interacting two - state systems , each of them coupled to independent bosonic reservoirs , and we have studied the time evolution of the entanglement between the two qubits for various initial conditions of the bipartite system .    the behaviour of the concurrence is consistent with the results of the literature , showing the occurrence of entanglement sudden death for some initial states and of stationary entanglement for any initial state .",
    "the presence of stationary entanglement which is not washed away from dissipation is perhaps the most important result of our analysis . indeed",
    "this feature is usually ascribed to the presence of a common reservoir which correlates the two parts of the bipartite system .",
    "instead we have shown here that stationary entanglement can occur also due to the interaction between the two parts , provided their interaction is described in a complete way which includes the counter - rotating terms in their interaction hamiltonian .",
    "we feel that our approach could help in understanding the role of energy non - conserving terms in the dissipative dynamics of open bipartite quantum systems . from this point of view",
    "more is expected from the analysis of the cases with reservoirs at different temperatures or with non - flat spectrum , in the framework of a non - markovian extension of the master equation presented here .",
