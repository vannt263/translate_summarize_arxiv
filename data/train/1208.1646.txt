    "traditionally , the role of information carrier in spin- and electronic devices is taken by respectively the spin or the charge of the conduction electrons in the system . in recent years , however , there has been an increasing awareness that spin excitations in insulating magnets ( either magnons or spinons ) may be better suited for this task .",
    "the reason behind this is that these excitations are not subject to joule heating .",

    "( [ eq : kappa ] ) , the combination of these two effects may be studied experimentally by measuring @xmath202 as a function of temperature . as the temperature increases , the thermal distribution of the bosonic magnons broadens , which enables the higher bands to contribute to thermal transport .",
    "alternatively , one can probe the chiral subgap edge states ( above the bands whose total tknn number is odd ) directly by microwave means .",
    "the first magnetic subband corresponds to several gigahertz , which falls within the scope of standard microwave techniques .",
    "excitation of some of the low - energy modes of the skyrmion lattice by microwave radiation has been performed  @xcite and analyzed .",
    "@xcite the magnonic reflectionless wave guide modes are analogous to those found in photonic crystals  @xcite and can provide intriguing spintronics applications .",
    "magnonic edge states have recently been proposed to exist in yig without any equilibrium spin texture but with an array with an array of fe - filled pillars , in which ellipticity of magnons due to dipolar interactions can give rise to magnonic bands with a nonzero tknn invariant .",
    "we have studied how fictitious magnetic fields , which are caused by a textured equilibrium magnetization , lead to thermal hall effects in two - dimensional insulating magnets in which the nontrivial equilibrium magnetization is caused by spin - orbit interaction .",
    "we have given a general expression for the fictitious magnetic vector potential and found that it consists of two contributions : a geometric texture contribution and a contribution due to the original spin - orbit term in the free energy .",
    "we have shown that both contributions are generally of the same order of magnitude .",
    "we have derived the relevant properties of the two ground states of interest to us ( the spiral state and the skyrmion lattice state ) in the phase diagram of a two - dimensional non - itinerant ferromagnet with nonzero dzyaloshinskii - moriya interaction .",
    "we have found that a system which has the spiral state as magnetic ground state does not have a finite thermal hall conductivity .",
    "however , we predicted that certain domain wall structures do display thermal hall effects .",
    "we have numerically diagonalized the hamiltonian describing the triangular skyrmion lattice .",
    "we found that due to the spatially varying fictitious magnetic vector potential , the excitation spectrum consists of broadened magnetic subbands .",
    "we have calculated the berry curvature of the magnetic subbands and showed that the berry curvature in combination with the excitation spectrum completely determines the thermal hall conductivity of the skyrmion lattice . at present , we are only able to capture the contribution to the thermal hall conductivity from higher magnetic subbands , as well as thermal- or microwave transport through the associated edge states . in order to properly describe the lowest subbands ,",
