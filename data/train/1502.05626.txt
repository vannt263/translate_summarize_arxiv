    "furthermore , this restricted @xmath151 matrix naturally emerges when one considers a relaxed sa assumption .",
    "recall that the validity of sa required that all energy gaps are large compared to a relevant time scale .",
    "many interesting topological systems have a degenerate groundspace with a large gap to the first excited state , but then the spectrum of excitations will be dense or even a continuum in the large system limit .",
    "this means that sa can not be used to eliminate transitions between different excited states .",

    "[ sec_convergence ] that decoherence in the groundspace is governed by only @xmath154 .",

    "the bath temperature only influences what state we converge to , and not how quickly we get there .",
    "this conclusion is quite remarkable .",
    "so much so , that naively it seems to violate some basic tenet of physics .",
    "two candidates are the arrhenius law and detailed balance .",
    "the arrhenius law is an empirical rule of thumb that has been successful in modeling chemical reactions .",
    "recently , it has been suggested that it may also apply to quantum memories , though violations have been observed in various settings  @xcite .",
    "the arrhenius law predicts that decoherence times scale as @xmath156 where @xmath0 is the system gap .",
    "we have a gapped degenerate ground space , but quasiparticles from the environment can poison the system without creating an excitation . from this perspective",
    "perhaps we should consider @xmath157 , and our temperature independence to be consistent with the arrhenius law .",
    "however , although we have focused on ground space decoherence our observation apply also to the dynamics of excitations with a discrete spectrum .",
    "that is , the rate at which excitation populations equilibrate is also temperature independent !",
    "indeed , the arrhenius law is not a universal law and we conclude that it is absolutely violated in the domain of gaussian fermions .",
    "detailed balance is a form of microscopic reversibility .",
    "it states that at thermal equilibrium the population transfer is symmetric for each process .",
    "consequently , the rate of transitions must depend on the temperature . at first",
    "this seems to imply that decoherence rates must be temperature dependent .",
    "indeed , detailed balance has been used to study decoherence times of spin ( qubit ) systems with the toric code hamiltonian  @xcite and cubic code hamiltonian  @xcite .",
    "these results revealed an exponential temperature dependence , and so one may expect this feature to be generic .",

    "@xcite have rigorously proved very general bounds on thermalization rates .",
    "their analysis appears to show an explicit temperature dependence , but closer inspection reveals variables that depend on the specific features of the bath .",
    "these variables can be set , whilst still respecting detailed balance , to precisely cancel all temperature dependence .",
    "we have seen that when the whole system - bath is gaussian , this is indeed what happens .",
    "to further illustrate that temperature independence is consistent with detailed balance we present in app .",
    "[ appdb ] a very simple classical markov process where convergence rates decouple from temperature .",
    "detailed balance has an esteemed history going back to boltzmann , who proclaimed it a key axiom of statistical mechanics and used it to great effect .",
    "however , there has been a recent surge of interest in non - equilibrium statistical mechanics , where detailed balance is violated , both in quantum  @xcite and classical settings  @xcite .",
    "mazza _ et .",
    "@xcite studied the effect of various noise models on the 1-dimensional kitaev chain .",
    "their main result is that various hamiltonian perturbations will decohere the system , but this decoherence is suppressed by increasing the length of the kitaev chain .",
    "conclude their paper by also discussing a more destructive noise model , open systems dynamics ( see pg.4 of ref .",
    "this model is a master equation with the hamiltonian of the standard kitaev wire ( with chemical potential set to zero ) , and lindblad operators @xmath158 which allows for fermions hopping to the environment and where we use @xmath159 to parameterize the strength of the hopping .",
    "they give numerical plots for decoherence of this model , but it can also be understood analytically .",
    "we proceed by casting these master equations in the language of covariance matrices , and find@xmath160 composing @xmath161 will cancel the imaginary parts , giving @xmath162 note that the eigenvalues of @xmath16 are purely imaginary so that @xmath163 is unitary , but the dissipative component adds a constant real negative component .",

    "budich _ et .",
    "@xcite made similar observations .",
    "they considered two models where only the end of a kitaev wire couples to the environment . in both models",
    "the system - environment coupling has the form @xmath167 where @xmath168 is some operator acting on the bath .",
    "they also considered the standard kitaev chain with zero chemical potential , so that the interaction commuted with the system hamiltonian .",
    "they observed rapid decoherence of majorana edge modes , with no dependence on the energy gap .",
    "these toy models are excellent ways to illustrate a serious deficit in prior claims to effectiveness of topological protection of majorana edge modes .",
    "however , they tell us little about what to expect when the interaction and hamiltonian do not commute . furthermore , one may also wish to consider much more exotic models , such as majorana fermions in 2d systems or even higher dimensions .",
    "these gaps in previous work are now filled by the more general insights presented here .",
    "we have seen that decoherence of gaussian fermionic systems can not be reduced by cooling . for markovian dynamics",
    ", we provided a microscopic derivation of the master equation in the weak coupling limit , leading to exponentially fast decoherence .",
    "therefore , to use gaussian systems as a quantum memory they must be either highly non - markovian or have minimal tunneling with any nearby gaussian heat baths .",
    "eliminating tunneling is potentially challenging when in any of the many popular proposals for acquiring topological order through the proximity effect  @xcite . in these proposals ,",
    "electron hopping with an external @xmath132-wave superconductor is the mechanism by which topological robustness is acquired .",
    "both electron hopping and the superconducting hamiltonian are gaussian , and so this opens the door to temperature invariant decoherence .",
    "for such systems it is urgent that we acquire a better understanding of the proximity effect from an open systems perspective .    after completing this work ,",

    "<S> coupling to a thermal bath leads to decoherence of stored quantum information . for a system of gaussian fermions , the fermionic analog of linear or gaussian optics , </S>",
    "<S> these dynamics can be elegantly and efficiently described by evolution of the system s covariance matrix . taking both system and bath to be gaussian fermionic </S>",
    "<S> , we observe that decoherence occurs at a rate that is independent of the bath temperature . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we also consider a weak coupling regime where the dynamics are markovian . </S>",
    "<S> we present a microscopic derivation of markovian master equations entirely in the language of covariance matrices , where temperature independence remains manifest . </S>",
    "<S> this is radically different from behaviour seen in other scenarios , such as when fermions interact with a bosonic bath . </S>",
    "<S> our analysis applies to many majorana fermion systems that have been heralded as very robust , topologically protected , qubits . in these systems </S>",
    "<S> , it has been claimed that thermal decoherence can be exponentially suppressed by reducing temperature , but we find gaussian decoherence can not be cooled away .    </S>",
    "<S> thermalization through interaction with an external bath is one of the principal mechanisms by which quantum systems lose information . in quantum technologies , </S>",
    "<S> rapid thermalisation destroys their advantage over classical counterparts . by better understanding these processes , one hopes to identify and engineer physical systems that act as more robust stores of quantum information . in topologically ordered systems , information is stored non - locally within the degenerate ground space of some large many - body system . </S>",
    "<S> the primary benefit of topology is robustness against random adiabatic fluctuations in the system hamiltonian . </S>",
    "<S> damage from such noise is exponentially suppressed with system size . </S>",
    "<S> topological systems also have an energy gap @xmath0 between the degenerate ground space and excited states , and are said to be protected by the gap against thermal excitations . a common claim  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite is that thermal processes occur at a rate @xmath1 , which is sometimes called the arrhenius law . </S>",
    "<S> the bold conclusion is that topology can exponentially eliminate noise merely by increasing system size and decreasing temperature .    of all topological systems , </S>",
    "<S> majorana zero modes have attracted the most attention . </S>",
    "<S> it was theorized that a so - called kitaev wire supports majorana zero modes at edges , which could be realised in simple solid state hetrostructures  @xcite , for example a nanowire coupled to a conventional s - wave superconductor  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this drove a series of experiments , eventually leading to observations of majorana edge modes  @xcite . beyond topological robustness </S>",
    "<S> , majorana zero - modes also possess the braiding statistics of non - abelian ising anyons . </S>",
    "<S> though insufficient for direct quantum computation , braiding ising anyons can demonstrate nonlocality , teleportation and superdense coding  @xcite . furthermore , </S>",
    "<S> ising anyon braiding can be promoted to full quantum computing when supplemented with some nontopological ( noisy ) operations  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the physics of these majorana systems is especially tractable as their hamiltonians are quadratic in fermion creation and annihilation operators . </S>",
    "<S> we say such a system is gaussian , or quasifree fermionic , in analogy with gaussian linear optics . </S>",
    "<S> gaussian states can be described purely in terms of the expectation value of quadratic observables , which are captured by a covariance matrix . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , some dissipative processes can be described within this powerful covariance matrix formalism  @xcite , and allow single fermions to hop between system and bath via @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> single fermion hopping violates conservation of fermion parity in the system , which is otherwise respected by unitary evolution . </S>",
    "<S> it is a toxic process that can cause errors without creating excitations , circumventing arguments that energy penalties suppress thermal processes to a rate @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , majorana modes in the kitaev wire ( see fig .  [ figwirebath ] ) have been shown to decohere due to fermion hopping at rates independently of system size or the system gap  @xcite , and we will review these results in detail . </S>",
    "<S> this article considers all gaussian fermionic systems , not just the kitave wire , and how they decohere as a function of temperature . </S>",
    "<S> a single fermion appearing in the system will have a partner appear in the environment , and so perhaps there is hope that a gapped bath hamiltonian will provide an energy penalty inhibiting these processes .        </S>",
    "<S> we present a very general , yet simple , argument that decoherence is independent of temperature , assuming only that the system - bath is governed by a gaussian hamiltonian . </S>",
    "<S> we extend this argument by providing a microscopic derivation of a master equation in the weak coupling regime , and again observe temperature independent decoherence . </S>",
    "<S> when fermions couple to bosonic baths , or through quartic fermion - fermion interactions @xmath3 , one would instead find a non - trivial temperature dependence . </S>",
    "<S> any real physical system will experience noise from multiple sources , mostly with temperature dependent rates . </S>",
    "<S> however , fermionic hopping presents a constant background noise that can not be suppressed through cooling . </S>",
    "<S> this adds to a growing body of work  @xcite that shows the outlook for majorana fermions makes them less promising quantum memories than initially supposed . </S>",
    "<S> our conclusions can be avoided by going beyond gaussian fermions , for instance by making use of complex many - body interactions used in the passive quantum memories reviewed in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss how our results demonstrate a break down of the arrhenius law , whilst still satisfying a notion of detailed balance . </S>",
    "<S> decoherence of two - level systems , such as spins , has been studied when they couple to spin or fermion baths  @xcite where a temperature dependence is observed but at low temperatures relaxation rates plateau , similarly breaking the arrhenius law . throughout , we use the phrase thermalize as synonymous with equilibrate or approach steady state . </S>",
    "<S> the reader should not infer that the steady state is the thermal gibbs distribution with respect the system hamiltonian and ambient temperature , as may not be the case . </S>"
