    "the growth conditions are more general .",
    "also we obtain new multiplicity results and we also establish the existence of non - trivial homoclinic solutions . our approach is variational and it is based on the non - smooth critical point theory of chang [ 4 ] .",

    "problems with non - differentiable potential which is only locally lipschitz in the state variable @xmath2 , are known as ` hemivariational inequalities ' and have applications in mechanics and engineering . for details in this direction",
    "we refer to the book of naniewicz and panagiotopoulos [ 27 ] .    in the last decade",
    "there has been an increasing interest for problems involving the one - dimensional @xmath0-laplacian or generalizations of it .",

    "it is easy to see that if @xmath11 is a local extremum of @xmath4 ( i.e. a local minimum or a local maximum ) , then @xmath28 . from the smooth critical point theory , we know that a basic tool is a compactness - type condition , known as the ` palais ",
