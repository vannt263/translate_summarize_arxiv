    "electromagnetic field computations and , more generally , the numerical discretization of equations enjoying a relevant geometric structure , is one of the most interesting challenge of numerical analysis for pdes and several results have been obtained in the last decade .",
    "indeed , only for galerkin methods , three acta numerica overview papers have been published : by hipmair @xcite , by arnold , falk and winther @xcite , and by boffi @xcite , addressing different aspects of the problem .    on the one hand ,",
    "discrete schemes have to preserve the geometric structure of the underlying pdes in order to avoid spurious behaviors , instability or non - physical solutions ( see e.g. , the pioneering paper @xcite ) . for electromagnetics ,",
    "as it is clear from the references above , numerical schemes have to be related with a discrete de rham complex .",
    "on the other hand , especially in view of high frequency computations , numerical schemes need to be efficient and accurate .",
    "this requires many features , and among others it requires adaptivity , or at least local mesh refinement capability , in order to capture the strong singularities of the electromagnetic field , possibly driven by _ a - posteriori _ error estimator as , e.g. , in @xcite . in this paper",
    "we present and analyse discretization techniques for electromagnetic fields based on splines and generalizations of splines , as nurbs ( @xcite ) or t - splines ( @xcite or below ) .",
    "our work originates from isogeometric analysis ( iga ) , @xcite .",
    "isogeometric analysis has been introduced in 2005 by hughes and co - authors in the seminal paper @xcite to solve structural mechanic problems directly on the geometry output by a cad system , and has set the paradigm to use splines , nurbs or their generalization as generating functions for the construction of galerkin spaces .",
    "this idea has been proved to be extremely effective and iga is spreading very fast across different scientific communities : structural mechanics ( see e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) , geometric modeling ( see e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and also @xcite ) and numerical analysis ( see e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .    in this paper",
    "we present the recent advances in the use of the isogeometric paradigm and spline - based methods for electromagnetic wave computations .",
    "this research has started with the two papers @xcite and @xcite and can likely be considered as still in infancy ( see also @xcite for the applications of this results ) .",
    "this paper aims at showing the potential impact of these techniques in the electromagnetic community by addressing several aspects : from the geometric structure of the proposed methods , to local refinement strategies .",
    "we introduce the * spline complex * studied in @xcite ( see and ) and we present its properties : we construct canonical bases so that the matrices representing differential operators are the incidence matrices of the underlying meshes , and this enlightens the relation between the spline complex and the geometry of the underlying meshes .",
    "we show that for different choices of the degree of splines , the spline complex is isomorphic to the co - chain complex or to the chain complex of the underlying mesh .",
    "besides this interesting fact , we also introduce the concept of _ control fields _ in analogy to control points which are ubiquitous in spline theory ( see e.g. , @xcite or @xcite ) which provide the correct physical interpretation of degrees of freedom . finally , we extend the results of @xcite to * multi - patch * geometries , i.e. , geometries which are piecewise spline or nurbs mapping of the unit cube .",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite for a detailed description of this class of geometries .    the second major contribution in this paper is a step towards * adaptivity * for spline - based methods .",
    "leveraging on the recent work on t - splines , we design a two dimensional * t - spline complex * where meshes with t - junctions can be used to allow for adaptivity .",
    "t - splines are the most attractive way to break the tensor product structure of splines while keeping their structure and their accuracy .",
    "t - splines have been introduced in @xcite and @xcite and their use as a fundamental tool to enhance isogeometric analysis with adaptivity has been proposed in @xcite .",
    "a series of papers has followed @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , together with the relevant class of analysis suitable t - splines @xcite , @xcite which we use in our construction .",
    "the two dimensional t - spline complex is used to treat three dimensional problems with symmetry .",
    "we should also mention that the definition and use of t - splines in three dimension are not yet well understood , but object of an intensive study .",
    "their use will allow , on a longer time perspective , to design full adaptive algorithms , on very general geometries parametrized on totally unstructured meshes .",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite for a monograph on the modern use of t - splines in geometric modeling .",
    "finally , we should remark that the spline spaces we study in this paper have a wide domain of applications and can be applied successfully to the discretization of other problems than electromagnetics . in fact , they can be used to solve the darcy flows equations or more generally the hodge laplacian operator as detailed in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "moreover , thanks to the regularity of spline spaces , their use in fluids is very promising . in the paper @xcite",
    "they are used for the first time to solve the stokes equations , in @xcite the stokes eigenvalue problem is addressed , and in the sequence of three papers @xcite , @xcite , @xcite they are applied to solve stokes and brinkman equations , steady and unsteady navier - stokes equations , providing impressive results .    the outline of the paper is the following . in section [ sec : notation ] we set up the notation for the problems we address , in section [ sec : prel - splin - nurbs ] we present known results about splines and nurbs in a self - contained way ; in section [ sec : spline - complex ] we present the spline complex and all the related results while in section [ sec : tt ] we introduce the t - spline complex and analyse its properties .",
    "finally , in section [ sec : num ] we present numerical results : the first ones are two and three dimensional , academic tests aiming at demonstrating the validity of the proposed approach . as a last example , we compute the propagation in a waveguide with geometric inhomogeneity , on a three dimensional locally refined mesh .",
    "in this section we present the notation that we need to describe the time - harmonic maxwell problem .",
    "let @xmath0 be a bounded lipschitz domain .",
    "we denote by @xmath1 the space of complex square integrable functions on @xmath2 , endowed with standard @xmath3 norm @xmath4 , and by @xmath5 their vectorial counterparts .",
    "the hilbert space @xmath6 contains functions of @xmath1 such that their first order derivatives also belong to @xmath1 .",
    "we denote by @xmath7 the subspace of functions with homogeneous boundary condition .",
    "we will also make use of the space @xmath8 , constituted by all functions in @xmath5 such that their curl also belongs to @xmath5 , and @xmath9 , the space of functions in @xmath5 such that their divergence belongs to @xmath1 .",
    "moreover , we denote by @xmath10 ( resp .",
    "@xmath11 ) the subspace of @xmath8 ( resp .",
    "@xmath9 ) of fields with vanishing tangential ( resp .",
    "normal ) component .    for the sake of simplicity",
    ", we assume that the domain @xmath2 , referred to as physical domain in the following , is bounded lipschitz and simply connected , and that its boundary @xmath12 is connected .",
    "we also assume that it is defined through a continuously differentiable parametrization with continuously differentiable inverse which we denote as @xmath13 , where @xmath14 will be referred to as the _ parametric domain_. further assumptions on the geometrical mapping @xmath15 will be given later",
    ".    some notation will be borrowed from the context of differential forms : first of all , we define the spaces @xmath16 since the parametrization @xmath15 and its inverse are smooth , we can define the pullbacks that relate these spaces as ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "2.2 ) ) : @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the jacobian matrix of the mapping @xmath15 .",
    "then , due to the curl and divergence conserving properties of @xmath19 and @xmath20 , respectively ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "3.9 ) , for instance ) , the following commuting de  rham diagram is satisfied ( see ( * ? ? ? * sect .",
    "2.2 ) ) : @xmath21    we are also interested in spaces with boundary conditions , denoted with the subindex @xmath22 , @xmath23 for which the de  rham diagram reads @xmath24 which also expresses the integral preserving property of @xmath25 .",
    "as it is well known , the exactness of the sequences and relies on the assumption that @xmath2 ( and @xmath26 ) has a trivial topology .",
    "all what we develop in this paper applies in principle also to the case of arbitrary topology but we do not present all the details here .",
    "we give here a brief overview on b - splines and , in the spirit of @xcite , we also introduce some concepts that will be needed in the definition of t - splines . for more details on b - splines",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite .        given two positive integers @xmath27 and @xmath28",
    ", we say that @xmath29 is a @xmath27-open knot vector if @xmath30 where repeated knots are allowed and denote by @xmath31 the multiplicity of the knot @xmath32 .",
    "we assume @xmath33 for all internal knots .    from the knot vector @xmath34 , b - spline functions of degree @xmath27 are defined following the well - known cox - deboor recursive formula : we start with piecewise constants ( @xmath35 ) : @xmath36 and for @xmath37 the _ b - spline _ functions are defined by the recursion @xmath38 this gives a set of @xmath28 b - splines that form a basis of the space of _ splines _ , that is , piecewise polynomials of degree @xmath27 with @xmath39 continuous derivatives at the internal knots @xmath32 , for @xmath40 .",
    "we denote this univariate spline space by @xmath41 an example of some b - splines is given in figure  [ fig:1 ] .",

    "for this reason , we define the _ local knot vector _ @xmath45 , and we will sometimes denote @xmath46(\\zeta)$ ] .    in the context of splines ,",
    "three kinds of refinement are possible , as explained in @xcite :    1 .   _",
    "@xmath47-refinement _ which corresponds to successive application of the cox - deboor formula . regularity is raised together with the degree : therefore , the spaces are not nested under @xmath47-refinement but , at each step ( degree and regularity elevation ) , the dimension of the space increases by @xmath48 .",
    "the name @xmath47-refinement has been introduced in @xcite ; 2 .   _",
    "@xmath49-refinement _ which corresponds to mesh refinement and is obtained by knot insertion .",
    "let @xmath50 be the knot vector after inserting the knot @xmath51 in @xmath34 .",
    "then , the new b - spline functions @xmath52 are constructed as follows : @xmath53 where @xmath54 , if @xmath55 , @xmath56 , if @xmath57 and , @xmath58 for @xmath59 .",
    "when @xmath51 is equal to @xmath60 or @xmath61 or to both , the knot insertion corresponds to reduction of the inter - element regularity at @xmath62 .",
    "@xmath27-refinement _ which corresponds to the degree raising with fixed interelement regularity , and generates a sequence of nested spaces .    assuming the maximum multiplicity of the internal knots is less than or equal to @xmath27 , i.e.",
    ", the b - spline functions are at least continuous , the derivative of the b - spline @xmath43 is a spline as well .",
    "indeed , it belongs to the spline space @xmath63 , where @xmath64 is a ( @xmath65)-open knot vector .",
    "obviously , the regularity of splines in @xmath66 is one less than the regularity in @xmath67 .    in the following",
    "we assume that @xmath68 and @xmath69 .",
    "the domain @xmath70 of definition of the spline functions is the one - dimensional _ parametric _ domain . on it ,",
    "the knot vector @xmath34 induces a partition of the interval @xmath70 that we denote by @xmath71 .",
    "precisely , we define @xmath71 as the set of the knot spans @xmath72 , @xmath73 , that can also be empty due to knot multiplicity greater than @xmath48 .",
    "empty intervals still play a role in the definition of b - splines and are graphically represented as points close one to the other , as proposed in @xcite .",
    "note that in this representation of @xmath71 , the number of lines is the knot multiplicity with one exception : for each boundary knot ( at 0 or 1 ) of an open knot vector in @xmath71 we represent only a multiplicity of @xmath74 , which is @xmath75 lines if @xmath27 is odd , and @xmath76 lines if @xmath27 is even ( see figure  [ fig:1 ] ) .",
    "the reason for this construction of @xmath71 will be motivated in the next section .",
    "finally , it is worth noting the relationship between the space @xmath67 and the space of derivatives @xmath66 , and their respective meshes @xmath71 and @xmath77 .",
    "the meshes @xmath71 and @xmath77 may differ only as regards the number of points at the boundary .",
    "indeed , according to the definition above , if @xmath27 is odd both meshes coincide , and if @xmath27 is even the number of elements of @xmath77 with respect to @xmath71 is reduced by two , one on each side .      in this section",
    "we present the concept of anchors and of greville sites as points in the parametric space @xmath70 which may be associated to each b - spline function .",
    "greville sites , which are also known as knot averages , are classical and can be found for instance in @xcite , while the concept of anchors has been introduced recently in @xcite . since splines are not interpolatory , the association of functions to points ( or , as we will see , other geometric entities ) is somehow more arbitrary than with lagrangian finite elements .",
    "anchors and greville sites are two different choices , and we present here both .",
    "anchors are very useful when dealing with non - tensor product extensions of splines as t - meshes , while greville sites ( and related geometric entities ) carry    degrees of freedom in a more natural way .    given a b - spline function @xmath78 , and its local knot vector @xmath79 , we set : if @xmath27 is odd , the anchor @xmath80 associated with @xmath78 is the central knot of @xmath81 .",
    "if @xmath27 is even , the anchor @xmath80 associated with @xmath78 is chosen to be the midpoint of the central knot span of @xmath81 , namely : @xmath82 .",
    "the position of the anchors for degrees @xmath83 and @xmath84 are represented in figure  [ fig:1 ] .",
    "note that obviously the correspondence between anchors and b - splines functions is one to one , but different anchors @xmath85 may lie at the same position @xmath86 .",
    "a remedy to this abuse of notation , at the cost of more complex definition , is proposed in @xcite where the use of both an _ index _ and a _ parametric _ domain is proposed .",
    "the set of anchors is denoted as @xmath87 . when @xmath27 is odd anchors",
    "are located at all knots of the partition @xmath71 ( which may be repeated ) , while when @xmath27 is even anchors are located at midpoints of all elements in @xmath71 ( including the ones of zero area ) .",
    "indeed , this fact is the reason for the definition of @xmath71 in particular as regards to the multiplicity of boundary knots .",
    "most often , we will use anchors to index functions and local knot vectors .",
    "namely , for an anchor @xmath88 , @xmath89 and @xmath90 will denote the corresponding local knot vector and b - spline function , respectively .",
    "when no confusion occurs , the subindex may be removed .",
    "[ rem : interpolatory - b - splines ] the b - splines are , in general , not interpolatory at the anchor @xmath91 , while they are interpolatory at knots having multiplicity @xmath27 .",
    "this always happens at @xmath92 and @xmath93 , and happens in the interior of the parametric domain where the basis is @xmath94 continuous , i.e. , at knots with multiplicity @xmath27 .",
    "see e.g. , figure  [ fig:1](left ) .    given @xmath88 , and @xmath95 for some @xmath96 , then the _ greville site _",
    "is defined as : @xmath97 unlike anchor positions , greville sites are all different one from the other , when the multiplicities @xmath31 verify @xmath98 and thus b - splines are all continuous .",
    "the greville sites induce a partition of the unit interval , referred as greville mesh and denoted @xmath99 .",
    "these concepts are ubiquitous in spline theory and geometry representation .",
    "greville sites are intimately related to _ control points _ and _ control polygon _ whose properties we briefly recall in the next section .",
    "a b - spline curve @xmath100 in @xmath101 is defined by a parametrization in the interval @xmath70 , in the form @xmath102 where @xmath103 are called the _",
    "control points_. control points are in a one - to - one correspondence with b - spline basis functions .",
    "the piecewise linear interpolation of the control points gives the control polygon @xmath104 .",
    "see figure  [ fig : ctrl_polygon ] for an example .",
    "the control points @xmath105 have an important role not only in the definition of the spline parametrization , but also in the visualization and interaction with spline geometries within cad softwares .",
    "indeed , it is common in cad softwares to represent , together with the parametrized curve @xmath100 , the control points @xmath106 and the associated control polygon @xmath104 .",
    "typically , the cad user defines or interacts with the control points in order to input and modify the geometry .",
    "since the b - splines are not in general interpolatory ( recall remark [ rem : interpolatory - b - splines ] ) , then the control polygon @xmath104 differs from @xmath100 , but it is `` close '' to it .",
    "precisely , @xmath104 converges to @xmath100 under @xmath49-refinement .",
    "this convergence is proved , e.g. , in @xcite and discussed here below .",
    "we introduce the usual lagrangian basis for piecewise linear polynomials on the greville mesh @xmath99 , denoted by @xmath107 : @xmath108 the control polygon @xmath104 is then parametrized by the mapping @xmath109",

    "assume @xmath116 , the degree @xmath117 and the knot vector @xmath118 are given , for @xmath119 .",
    "these knot vectors define a tensor product mesh @xmath71 in the parametric domain @xmath120 where , as in section [ sect : anchors ] , we have to take into account the knot multiplicity .",
    "the multiplicity of a knot vector in @xmath121 is represented graphically by lines ( @xmath122 ) or planes ( @xmath123 ) one close to the other , while the boundary is treated exactly as in one dimension .",
    "the set of anchors is defined on @xmath71 as the cartesian product @xmath124 .",
    "considering , for example , the trivariate case ( @xmath123 ) and recalling the definitions from section [ sect : anchors ] for the univariate case , we have that : if all @xmath125 are odd the anchors lie at the vertices of the mesh ; if both @xmath126 and @xmath127 are odd and @xmath128 is even , then the anchors are middle - points of the vertical edges of @xmath71 ; if both @xmath126 and @xmath127 are even and @xmath128 is odd , then the anchors are centers of the horizontal faces of @xmath71 ; if all @xmath125 are even the anchors lie at the center of the elements of @xmath71 , and so on . as in the univariate case",
    ", the anchors may be located at the center of zero length edges or zero area faces or empty elements , according to knot repetition .",
    "also , the computation of the local knot vectors for each anchor follows from the univariate case .",

    "even we have instead a chain complex without explicitly constructing the dual mesh , which has no analogue in the finite element framework",
    ".    moreover , the use of anchors and the structure of the mesh at the boundary guarantee that in both the chain and cochain complex the boundary is treated in a simple and canonical way . in the case of finite elements",

    "we perform the refinement first in an l - shaped two - dimensional section , and then propagate to the three - dimensional domain with a uniform mesh in the @xmath456-direction , as already explained in section  [ sect:3d - t - splines ] .",
    "the refinement is performed identically for every patch , in such a way that conformity can be ensured at the patch interfaces .",
    "to construct the two - dimensional mesh , at each refinement step , and for every patch , we refine a small square region near the reentrant edge , subdividing each element into 4 . then some t - junction extensions are added , depending on the degree , to make the mesh analysis suitable , as defined in section  [ sect : as ] .",
    "for instance , in the example of figure  [ fig : mesh_thickl ] we start with an @xmath457 mesh for each patch , which is drawn in black . at the first step",
    "we refine a region of @xmath458 elements on each patch .",
    "since the degree is @xmath459 , two - bay extensions must be added to make the mesh analysis suitable .",
    "the refined elements at this step are given by the blue lines .",
    "at the second refinement step , which is marked in red , we first refine a square region of @xmath460 elements , and again we add the two - bay extensions to make the mesh analysis suitable .",
    "finally we remark that , since the dyadic partition and the definition of analysis suitable t - mesh depend on the degree , different meshes are used for different degrees .",
    "the problem has been solved for degrees  @xmath462 and  @xmath463 . in tables",

    "[ fig : thickl_eigv ] we display the convergence rate for the first eigenvalue , comparing the results obtained with t - splines and with a b - spline discretization of the same degree in the corresponding refined tensor - product dyadic mesh .",
    "as can be seen , with t - splines we obtain the same error with an important reduction in the number of the degrees of freedom .",
    "the geometry @xmath2 is three quarters of a cylinder of radius and length equal to one ( see figure  [ fig : mesh_camembert ] ) , that in cylindrical coordinates is given by @xmath469 .",
    "we impose the null tangential component on @xmath470 , and the source term @xmath471 is taken such that the exact solution is @xmath472 , i.e. , it is singular in the first two directions , but it is regular in the @xmath456 direction , for which the local refinement of the previous test is well suited for this case .    as in the previous example , the domain is defined with three patches , and the discrete fields @xmath473 are only tangentially continuous between them .",
    "the construction of the mesh in the parametric domain is identical to the one in the previous example : for each patch we first create a two - dimensional mesh locally refined towards the corner , and extend it to the three dimensional domain by tensor product .",
    "the mesh is then mapped to the physical domain , as can be seen in figure  [ fig : mesh_camembert ] .",
    "the problem is solved with t - splines of degree  3 , and also with b - splines of the same degree in the corresponding tensor product mesh .",
    "the errors in @xmath474-norm for the two methods are compared in figure  [ fig : error_camembert ] . as in the previous example , with t - splines",
    "we are able to obtain results similar to those of b - splines with a reduction of the number of degrees of freedom .          as the last numerical test we use t - splines to simulate the propagation of a singular mode in a waveguide with a twist .",
    "the configuration , which is presented in figure  [ fig : waveguide ] , is the same given in ( * ? ? ?",
    "8) , changing the material discontinuity by a geometric inhomogeneity ( the twist ) .",
    "the problem is solved in a waveguide with a twist of 90  degrees , with a section of three quarters of the circle of 2  cm radius , and for which we assume that the walls are perfect electrical conductors .",
    "we also assume that the waveguide extends to infinity without other inhomogeneities , and it is truncated by the planes @xmath475 and @xmath476 to obtain the computational domain , which consists of three different regions : a middle region where the waveguide is twisted ( see figure  [ fig : waveguide ] ) , and two straight regions near the ports , to keep the inhomogeneity far enough from them , in such a way that only the dominant mode te@xmath477 can propagate without attenuation . the total length of the computational domain is 24  cm : 4  cm for each straight region , and 16  cm for the region with the twist .",
    "the frequency @xmath478 is taken equal to 32  ghz , and it is between the cutoff frequencies for the first mode ( 21  ghz ) and the second mode ( 33.84  ghz ) .",
    "following @xcite , and working in the time harmonic regime at a given frequency @xmath478 , the ( complex - valued ) electric field @xmath479 is solution of the problem @xmath480 where @xmath481 with @xmath482 and @xmath483 the magnetic permeability and electric permittivity of free space .",
    "the incident electric field @xmath484 at the port @xmath475 , and the wavenumber of the first mode @xmath485 are defined as @xmath486 in the case of waveguides of rectangular or circular section , the value of the constant @xmath487 and the mode @xmath488 are known . in the general case , they can be obtained by solving a 2d eigenvalue problem on the port @xmath475 , which consists on finding the minimum eigenvalue @xmath489 , and its associated eigenvector @xmath490 , such that @xmath491    the electric field @xmath492 in equation is discretized with t - splines of degree  3 , using the approach already explained in section  [ sect:3d - t - splines ] .",
    "the two - dimensional t - mesh for the section is built as in the previous examples , and in the @xmath456 direction we use one element for each straight region near the ports , and 4 elements along the twist , for a total of 7936 degrees of freedom . for the solution of the 2d problem",

    "the magnitude of the real part of the computed solution @xmath492 is shown in figure  [ fig : waveguide_mode ] , which shows that the mode is correctly propagated .",

    "<S> in this paper we introduce methods for electromagnetic wave propagation , based on splines and on t - splines . </S>",
    "<S> we define spline spaces which form a de rham complex and , following the isogeometric paradigm , we map them on domains which are ( piecewise ) spline or nurbs geometries . </S>",
    "<S> we analyse their geometric structure , as related to the connectivity of the underlying mesh , and we give a physical interpretation of the fields degrees - of - freedom through the concept of control fields . </S>",
    "<S> the theory is then extended to the case of meshes with t - junctions , leveraging on the recent theory of t - splines . </S>",
    "<S> the use of t - splines enhance our spline methods with local refinement capability and numerical tests show the efficiency and the accuracy of the techniques we propose .    </S>",
