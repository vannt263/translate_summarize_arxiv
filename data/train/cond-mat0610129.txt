    "as electrodynamical media the cuprate high - t@xmath0 superconductors are highly anomalous . in their normal state they behave like metals in the planar ab - directions while they can be regarded as dielectrics along the interplanar c - direction , at least at finite frequencies . only in the regime where the superconductivity start to degrade because of too high doping levels , metallic ` normalcy ' develops along the c - axis @xcite .",
    "electrodynamical anomaly raises a general question regarding the nature of electron - phonon coupling in the cuprates . insulating cuprates are as any other oxide characterized by a highly polarizable lattice .",
    "the consequence is that one is dealing with strongly ` polar ' electron - phonon ( ep ) couplings , associated with the long range nature of the coulomb interaction between carriers and the ionic lattice @xcite . in normal metals these long range interactions",
    "are diminished by metallic screening and one is left with rather weak , residual short range ep interactions .",
    "although this is also the case in the planar directions of the cuprates , due to incoherent electron motion perpendicular to the planes we argue that the c - axis phonons are largely unscreened in this direction and strong polar ep - couplings are active @xcite .    in our recent paper @xcite , angle - resolved photoemission ( arpes ) studies of optimally - doped and overdoped bi@xmath1sr@xmath1cuo@xmath2 ( bi2201 ) superconductors",
    "have indicated that polar c - axis couplings play an important role .",
    "energy dispersion `` kinks '' resulting from coupling to well defined bosonic modes , which we argued to be phonons rather than spin resonance modes , are weaker at low binding energies in overdoped compared to optimally doped bi2201 .",
    "this case is twofold : ( a ) a good description is obtained for the electronic self - energy in the nodal momentum direction in an optimally doped single layer bi2201 superconductor by assuming that the eliashberg function @xmath3 largely coincides with the measured c - axis electron energy loss function ; ( b ) the electronic self - energy drastically changes in a strongly overdoped system and we show that these changes are accounted for assuming a frequency dependent screening characterized by a scale @xmath4mev . here",
    "we will present calculations further substantiating this claim .",
    "we will give the reasons why the c - axis optical loss function should be a good model for the eliashberg function associated with the polar couplings in the optimally doped system .",
    "furthermore , we will show that the way the self - energy diminishes in the overdoped regime is qualitatively- and quantitatively consistent with what has been learned from optical measurements about the way metallicity develops in the overdoped regime .",
    "we remark that a great deal of focus has been placed on in - plane phonons such as the breathing modes showing large softenings with doping in the cuprates @xcite .",
    "these modes have been shown to contribute to the electronic self - energy for nodal electrons @xcite . moreover ,",
    "the breathing phonons provide signatures on the spectral function for the formation of charge ordering @xcite and may contribute to @xmath5wave pairing in the presence of strong correlations @xcite . rather than taking into account the interesting and relevant issue of planar phonon couplings ,",
    "our focus here will be on the @xmath6axis phonons in order to explore the role of screening .",
    "the c - axis is insulating , not because a lack of carriers , but instead due to the fact that charge dynamics is strongly overdamped and incoherent .",
    "to be discussed at the end , the damping rate is decreasing rapidly in the overdoped regime , and this is exactly what is needed to explain the behavior of the self - energy .",
    "van der marel and kim @xcite pointed out some time ago that the _ effective _ c - axis plasmon frequency @xmath7 ( @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the c - axis effective carrier density and band mass , respectively ) as determined by an optical sum rule can be as large as 1/4 of the planar plasma frequency @xmath10 ev @xcite .",
    "the essence of overdamped dynamics is captured by the expression for the dielectric function associated with a plasmon with damping rate @xmath11 and frequency @xmath12 at long wavelengths , @xmath13 it is demonstrated ( see eq .",
    "( [ charfreq2 ] ) that in the overdamped case @xmath14 the medium behaves like a dielectric at frequencies larger than the characteristic frequency , @xmath15    in the cuprates , it will be shown that in the doping range up to optimal doping , this frequency is smaller than the typical optical phonon frequencies with the effect that the c - axis optical conductivity @xmath16 looks like that of a polar insulator , dominated by unscreened polar phonons .",
    "to get the impression of the magnitude of @xmath17 , we assume a simple drude form for the optical conductivity ( see eq .",
    "( [ optcon ] ) ) . with this form , @xmath17 is approximately proportional to the height of the electronic background in the c - axis @xmath16 and this background is found to increase rapidly in the overdoped regime in lsco system @xcite .",
    "we find that this change is just of the right magnitude to explain the changes in the self - energy of the overdoped system .",
    "the justification for taking the _ c - axis _ ep couplings being representative of the interactions showing up in the self - energy will be discussed first .",
    "the actual importance of polar ep - couplings in the cuprates is _ a priori _ a rather subtle affair .",
    "on the one hand , there are actually very few phonons which can be regarded as unscreened .",
    "the cuprates can be viewed as a stack of metallic sheets . for one limit , when considering phonons with @xmath18 purely along c - axis ( @xmath19 ) , the screening frequency @xmath17 should be set by the effective c - axis plasmon frequency @xmath12 , such that all phonons with frequency @xmath20 can be regarded as screened .",
    "this @xmath17 will be later shown to be defined by eq .",
    "( [ charfreq2 ] ) .",
    "similarly , for the other limit , when considering phonons with @xmath18 purely in the ab - plane ( @xmath21 ) , @xmath22 should be set by the planar plasmon frequency @xmath23 . since @xmath23 is large compared to @xmath12 @xcite , this implies that phonons with @xmath18 along the c - axis will be left unscreened compared to phonons with @xmath18 in ab plane . in a more general case , at a 3d momentum @xmath24 , the effective 3d plasmon frequency @xmath25 for @xmath26 @xcite ( also see appendix a )",
    "is given by , @xmath27 the polar coupling requires that the phonon frequencies exceed the 3d screening frequency , which should be set by this @xmath28 .",
    "hence , this implies that only phonons in a narrow cone around @xmath29 can contribute to the polar couplings .",
    "it is questionable whether this small @xmath30 will show up in the polar couplings .",
    "given the unknowns , this question is not easy to answer on theoretical grounds . on the other hand , leaving the overall strength aside , the frequency dependence of the electronic self - energy can be easily calculated @xcite and in section iii we will compare the experiment @xcite with the calculation , assuming the predominant electron - phonon coupling is due to the unscreened c - axis phonons .",
    "in the following , the real part of self - energy , @xmath31 , contributed from interactions which can be captured by the c - axis optical dielectric function , @xmath32 , will be calculated where the strength of interactions as a function of energy is represented by the eliashberg function , @xmath3 .",
    "regarding the empirical result shown in the experimental paper @xcite , the main results in this paper are that a ) the c - axis loss function , @xmath33 , is a good representative of @xmath34 for the optimally doped cuprate and b ) when including screening effect , the expression of @xmath34 becomes eq .",
    "( [ elias2metph ] ) giving the good agreement of @xmath31 of the overdoped cuprate",
    ".    the electron self - energy can be given by ( @xmath35 ) , @xmath36 where @xmath37 and @xmath38 are the retarded electron propagator and the effective interaction , respectively .",
    "here we neglect the detailed momentum structure of the electron - phonon coupling , which although important for a subset of phonons ( such as the b@xmath39 and b@xmath40 c - axis phonons ) , is motivated by the interest in small q phonons providing a more or less isotropic charge displacement along the c - axis .",
    "we neglect vertex corrections which may be important for polaron formation but are not crucial to develop the ideas of screening .    when only considering the interaction of electrons to polar c - axis phonons and electrons to electrons , the effective interaction ( see appendix b ) can be written as @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the total dielectric function in which the core polarization , the phononic- and electronic polarizations , in terms of the electronic polarizability @xmath43 , enter additively .",
    "the effective interaction includes both coulomb and ep interactions , and the manifestation of screening is that the interactions are mixed as coulomb interactions modify the phonon propagator @xmath44 and vice - versa .",
    "this effective interaction can be rewritten as @xcite ( @xmath45 is the bare ep vertex neglecting any fermionic momentum dependence ) @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the electronic polarizability eq .",
    "( [ plasmoneps ] ) and @xmath48 ; this is a general expression for phonon - modulated uniform charge displacements .",
    "we now assert that the effective interaction @xmath49 is dominated by the coupling to the unscreened c - axis phonons .",
    "next we assume that momentum dependences are smooth .",
    "this is definitely not problematic for the phonon - propagators hidden in @xmath49 because the important phonons are of the high energy optical variety having small dispersions .",
    "this is further helped by the fact that because of the metallic screening in the planar directions , only phonons with a small planar momentum @xmath30 can be regarded as unscreened .",
    "a more delicate issue relates to the electron momentum dependence of the bare vertex having implications for how the self - energy will depend on @xmath50 .",
    "elsewhere we will show that this can give rise to highly interesting effects associated with the screening physics @xcite but here we will focus on the frequency dependences in a given momentum direction .    neglecting momentum dependences ,",
    "the phonon polarizability can be straightforwardly parameterized , by a sum over phonons with transversal frequencies @xmath51 , damping @xmath52 and strengths @xmath53 , as tabulated by tsvetkov _",
    "@xcite , @xmath54    taking for the electronic polarizability @xmath55 and a plasmon frequency @xmath12 large compared to all phonon frequencies one recovers the standard results for the ep coupling in metals , but we now focus on the category of unscreened phonons , such that @xmath56 .    in the insulator , the phonon propagator turns into the bare phonon propagator @xmath57 which becomes in terms of the parametrization eq .",
    "( [ phoneps ] ) @xmath58 where @xmath59 .",
    "the eliashberg function is defined as the fermi - surface average @xcite , @xmath60 while the real part of the electronic self - energy , calculated from the eliashberg function , is given by @xcite , @xmath61 where @xmath62 with @xmath63 being the fermi distribution function .",
    "assuming smooth momentum dependences , and observing that in the insulator @xmath65 , one immediately infers that the eliashberg function for the polar phonons can be written as , @xmath66 where lumping together in the factor @xmath67 is the numerical factors coming from the momentum integrations ( see appendix c ) . since momentum dependences are weak we can as well take the optically measured c - axis loss function @xmath68 where @xmath69 as representative for the loss functions at small @xmath30 and arbitrary values of @xmath70 . in this way , we obtained a good fit to the measured self - energy in the optimally doped cuprates @xcite .      in the following",
    ", we will include the metallic screening effect to calculate @xmath31 in the overdoped case . in the experimental paper @xcite we found",
    "that the self - energy in the overdoped system was reproduced in detail , @xmath71 using the loss function of the optimally doped system and a ` filter ' function representing a characteristic ` screening ' frequency @xmath72mev . as we will now argue , the ` filter ' function @xmath73 is consistent with the changes in the screening seen in optical spectroscopy . to incorporate the effect of the metallic screening",
    ", one could model the c - axis polarizability according to eq .",
    "( [ plasmoneps ] ) as , @xmath74    we have neglected the details of the frequency and fermionic momentum dependence of the scattering rate .",
    "this simple drude form is an over simplification but all what matters for the phonon screening are the overall energy scales of screening and the phonon frequencies .",
    "moreover , we use `` damping '' as a way of loosely parameterizing the change from coherent metallic transport along the @xmath6axis in overdoped systems to incoherent insulating behavior near optimal doping .",
    "the nature of this change is a very important issue , relating to charge confinement and/or the incoherent nature of anti - nodal quasi - particles governing @xmath6axis propagation in an lda treatment .",
    "a full description of this change is difficult around optimal doping where strong correlations are developed .",
    "an adequate description of the role of correlations requires treating both electronic correlations and ep interactions on equal footing . since",
    "such treatments are presently limited , we give only a heuristic picture of the consequences of strong damping and incoherence .    for finite @xmath12 , @xmath75 will also acquire an imaginary part which contributes to the eliashberg function .",
    "when the plasmon is underdamped while @xmath12 is in the phonon frequency window , the plasmon would become well ` visible ' in the self - energy @xcite .",
    "however , in the overdamped regime , @xmath76 , of interest to the c - axis of the cuprates , this turns into a smooth background contribution . in the experimental determination of the self - energy",
    "such backgrounds are subtracted .",
    "although it would be interesting to find out if such backgrounds associated with the c - axis metallization can be extracted from the experimental data , these should be ignored in the present context and we should focus on the phonon contribution to the effective interaction in eq .",
