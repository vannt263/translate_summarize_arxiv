    "we note in passing that a smooth surface is not likely to be the best surface for producing neutrons since rough surfaces have patches wherein the surface plasma electromagnetic field oscillations will be very much more intense .",
    "however , the following smooth surface model will be employed for estimating the proper low energy nuclear reaction rates produced by electroweak interactions .    to compute the density of surface electron states per unit area per unit energy",
    ", one may begin with a simple renormalized electron mass @xmath231 model and take @xmath232 i.e. @xmath233 if such surface electron states are confined to a wave function width @xmath234 normal to the surface , then we have within the surface region , and after integrating over the emitted neutrino energy spectrum @xmath235    for a smooth surface , integrating the neutrino production rate over a thin slab at the electrode surface yields the estimate for the production rate per unit time per unit area , @xmath236 the above eq.([ispw14 ] ) for smooth surfaces is in agreement with the initial order of magnitude estimate in eqs.([est3 ] ) and ( [ est4 ] ) .",
    "electromagnetic surface plasma oscillation energies in hydrogen - loaded metal cathodes may be combined with the normal electron - proton rest mass energies to allow for neutron producing low energy nuclear reactions eq.([intro2 ] ) .",
    "the entire process of neutron production near metallic hydride surfaces may be understood in terms of the standard model for electroweak interactions .",
    "the produced neutrons have ultra low momentum since the wavelength is that of a low mode isotopic spin wave spanning a surface patch . the radiation energy required for such ultra low momentum neutron production",
    "may be supplied by the applied voltage required to push a strong charged current across the metallic hydride cathode surface .",
    "alternatively , low energy nuclear reactions may be induced directly by laser radiation energy applied to a cathode surface .",
    "they may even be induced , albeit at comparatively low rates of reaction , simply by imposing an adequate pressure gradient ( which can be as little as one atmosphere . ) of gaseous hydrogen isotopes across a metallic membrane@xcite composed of an aggressive hydride - former such as palladium .",
    "the electroweak rates of the resulting ultra low momentum neutron production are computed from the above considerations . in terms of the radiation induced mass renormalization parameter @xmath230 in eqs.([est1 ] ) and ( [ est2 ] ) ,",
    "the predicted neutron production rates per unit area per unit time have the form @xmath237 the expected range of the parameter @xmath238 for hydrogen - loaded cathodes is approximately @xmath239 in satisfactory agreement with the orders of magnitude observed experimentally .",
    "more precise theoretical estimates of @xmath238 require specific material science information about the physical state of cathode surfaces which must then be studied in detail . as discussed in previous work@xcite , a deuteron on certain cathode surfaces",
    "may also capture an electron producing two ultra low momentum neutrons and a neutrino .",
    "the neutron production rates for heavy water systems are thereby somewhat enhanced .    from a technological perspective",
    ", we note that energy must first be put into a given metallic hydride system in order to renormalize electron masses and reach the critical threshold values at which neutron production can occur .",
    "net excess energy , actually released and observed at the physical device level , is the result of a complex interplay between the percentage of total surface area having micron - scale e and b field strengths high enough to create neutrons and elemental isotopic composition of near - surface target nuclei exposed to local fluxes of readily captured ultra low momentum neutrons . in many respects ,",
    "low temperature and pressure low energy nuclear reactions in condensed matter systems resemble r- and s - process nucleosynthetic reactions in stars .",
    "lastly , successful fabrication and operation of long lasting energy producing devices with high percentages of nuclear active surface areas will require nanoscale control over surface composition , geometry and local field strengths .",
