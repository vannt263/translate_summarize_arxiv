    "despite many decades of study , ( see eg . * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the origin of tight correlation between global radio and far infrared ( fir ) flux of normal star - forming galaxies is still not well understood .",
    "the correlation has been observed to exist over five orders of magnitude in both radio and fir luminosity @xcite and exists even at intermediate redshifts @xcite .",
    "the correlation has been suggested to be a consequence of both the 1.4  ghz flux and the fir flux being separately correlated to the star formation rate ( sfr ) .",
    "the radio 1.4  ghz emission comes mainly from synchrotron emission from cosmic ray ( cr ) electrons accelerated in supernova remnants ( snr ) interacting with the magnetic field , and the fir flux comes mainly from dust re - processing of uv photons from young stars ; both are hence correlated to the sfr .",
    "however , while it is true that both the radio and the fir fluxes are expected to correlate to the sfr and hence to each other , the tightness of correlation for disparate systems with large differences in magnetic field strengths remains difficult to understand .",
    "several models have been proposed to explain this tight correlation . in the early ` calorimeter ' model @xcite , galaxies are assumed to be optically thick to both uv photons and cr electrons , and the energies from both are re - processed completely within the galaxies themselves .",
    "the model also assumes source strengths of cr electrons and ionizing photons are both proportional to the sn rate , and that the energy densities of the interstellar radiation field and the magnetic field in all galaxies is a constant .",
    "while this model produces a tight radio - fir correlation , it also predicts radio spectra from star - forming galaxies that are steeper than observed .",
    "@xcite resolves this anomaly by invoking ionization and bremsstrahlung losses at low radio frequencies , and also suggests that magnetic fields in galaxies are much higher than the equipartition field , contributing to the cr electrons loosing their energy in a short timescale .",
    "an alternative ` optically thin ism ' explanation is proposed by @xcite , in which most of the uv photons and relativistic cr electrons escape the galaxy disc , the latter because of a proposed correlation between disc scaleheight and escape scalelength of cr electrons .",
    "@xcite present another model in which the radio continuum , co and fir emissions are all determined by the hydrostatic pressure in galaxies instead of the sfr . however , despite the large amount of modeling effort , a consensus on the cause of the tight radio - fir correlation remains elusive .",
    "most of the above mentioned studies focus on large star forming galaxies .",
    "a specific model which includes small dwarf galaxies was presented by @xcite . in this model",
    "a ` conspiracy ' maintains the radio - fir correlation for low luminosity galaxies , viz .",
    "the fir emission reduces because of the low dust content of these galaxies , while the non - thermal radio emission becomes inefficient due to the easy escape of cr electrons . a more recent numerical work by @xcite attributes the radio - fir correlation to ` calorimetry ' , combined with two different conspiracies at high and low gas density regimes . at low gas densities",
    "more cr electrons escape while low uv opacity causes lower fir emission .",
    "measuring the radio continuum flux from the faintest dwarf irregular galaxies is interesting even apart from the issue of the radio - fir correlation .",
    "@xcite predict that star - forming dwarfs will contribute significantly to the number counts at faint levels in the proposed next generation deep sub-@xmath2jy surveys .",
    "measuring the radio continuum flux also allows one to estimate the magnetic fields strengths .",
    "magnetic fields in low mass star - forming dwarfs can give clues to understanding the seeding of the intergalactic medium ( igm ) at early epochs by similar low mass galaxies , due to easy escape of material from their shallow gravitational potentials @xcite .",
    "magnetic field strengths comparable to those in normal spiral galaxies have been observed for nearby dwarf galaxies with extreme properties ( i.e. evolved objects with recent or ongoing starbursts ) like ngc 4459 , ngc 1569 , ngc 6822 , ic 10 @xcite .",
    "however for faint dwarf irregular galaxies , the available data is very scarce .",
    "the smc has been measured to have a large - scale weak magnetic field of @xmath13 @xmath2 g @xcite .",
    "a systematic survey of radio continuum emission from local group dwarf irregular galaxies @xcite resulted in only 3 new detections with magnetic fields estimated to be @xmath3  5 @xmath2 g .",
    "the dearth of systematic studies of the radio - fir correlation in faint dwarf irregular galaxies is in large part because of the difficulty of detecting radio continuum emission from them .",
    "we present here a study of the radio - fir correlation where the radio and fir fluxes are obtained from stacked images of the individual galaxies .",
    "our sample galaxies are chosen from the faint irregular galaxy gmrt survey ( figgs ) @xcite sample , which is a systematically selected sample of faint , gas - rich , star - forming dwarf galaxies .",
    "details of the radio , fir and fuv fluxes are presented in section  [ sec : pro ] . in sec .",
    "[ sec : dis ] we discuss the implication of our results for the radio - fir correlation and the magnetic field strength .",
    "a summary of our findings is given is sec .",
    "[ sec : sum ] .",
    "as described above , we have available to us 70@xmath2 m and 1.4  ghz fluxes for our sample of faint dwarfs . in order to check the linearity of the radio - fir correlation",
    ", we would need a control sample of large galaxies for which the radio - fir correlation has been measured using fluxes in these same bands .",
    "a suitable sample is provided by the sample of @xcite .",
    "these authors give the radio - fir correlation for a large sample of galaxies in terms of q70 , defined as log@xmath4 , where s@xmath5  and s@xmath6  represent the fluxes as measured by the _",
    "_ s__pitzer mips 70@xmath0  band and at 1.4 ghz respectively .",
    "we compute below the value of q70 for our own sample and compare it with that found by @xcite .",
    "as mentioned above , our sample of dwarf galaxies is drawn from the figgs survey .",
    "although gmrt radio continuum data is available for the galaxies ( from the line free region of the spectrum ) the bandwidths are narrow and the sensitivity is low .",
    "the radio continuum data was hence instead taken from the nrao vla sky survey ( nvss ) @xcite .",
    "the nvss has an effective continuum bandwidth of @xmath142 mhz , synthesised beam fwhm ( angular resolution ) of @xmath145@xmath7 , and background rms ( sensitivity ) of @xmath10.45 mjy bm@xmath8 .",
    "far infrared ( fir ) fluxes for the galaxies were obtained from archival _ _",

    "multiband imaging photometer spitzer ( mips ) @xcite 70@xmath0  images .",
    "the 70@xmath0  band of mips has a bandwidth of @xmath119@xmath0 , and an angular resolution of @xmath119@xmath7 .",
    "the star formation rate ( sfr ) was estimated from archival _ _ galex _ _ fuv band data .",
    "the fuv data have a resolution of @xmath9@xmath7 .",
    "although all figgs sample galaxies have been covered by the nvss , not all of the nvss data are useful for the current purpose .",
    "galaxies where there is a background continuum source superposed on the image can not be used , since their inclusion would bias the radio flux upwards .",
    "visual inspection of all of the nvss images left us with 57 galaxies that have no strong background source near the galaxy .",
    "mips 70@xmath0  data is available for 26 of the figgs galaxies , 13 of these galaxies have detectable emission in the 70@xmath0  band . for all of the detected galaxies the 70@xmath0  flux is less that 2@xmath10  in extent .",
    "therefore we decided to use the standard mips pipeline ( filtered and mosaiced ) processed basic calibrated datasets ( pbcds ) .",
    "multiple pbcds for the same galaxy , wherever available , were processed separately .",
    "public _ galex _",
    "fuv data is available for 46 of the figgs galaxies .",
    "as described above , data at different bands is available for different subsets of the figgs galaxies .",
    "we hence define the following subsamples whose properties we will examine in the following analysis .    1 .",
    "` nvss ' sub - sample consists of the 57 galaxies with available radio continuum data .",

    "only one galaxy , ugc 5456 is detected at 1.4 ghz in nvss , and also has detectable 70@xmath0   and _ _ g__alex fuv emission .",
    "the properties of the three subsamples as well as the galaxy ugc 5456 , are given in table  [ tab : samp ] .",
    "as can be seen the mean properties of all of the sub - samples are quite similar , and not surprisingly our results are not very sensitive to which exact sub - sample ( or which mixture of sub - samples ) is selected for the analysis .",
    ".sample properties [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     @xmath11 the name of the sub - sample / galaxy ; @xmath12 the mean sfr for the sample galaxies as estimated from the measured fuv emission ; @xmath13 the estimated @xmath14  luminosity ; @xmath15 the measured 70@xmath0  luminosity ; @xmath16 the expected 70@xmath0  luminosity for the listed @xmath14  flux ; @xmath17 the measured 1.4  ghz luminosity ; @xmath18 the expected 1.4  ghz luminosity for the given sfr ( fuv based ) , estimated using the calibration in @xcite for l@xmath19l@xmath20 galaxies ; @xmath21 the expected 1.4  ghz luminosity for the given sfr ( fuv based ) , estimated using the calibration in @xcite for l@xmath3l@xmath20 galaxies ; @xmath22 the estimated thermal emission at 1.4  ghz ; @xmath23 the estimated percentage flux of non - thermal origin at 1.4  ghz ; @xmath24 the estimated equipartition magnetic field . + @xmath25 mean value of the 46 galaxy ` fuv ' sub - sample",
    ".    from table  [ tab : flux ] it is evident that , within the measurement uncertainties the radio - fir correlation holds for faint dwarf irregular galaxies .",
    "however , it is unclear if the radio - fir correlation continue to hold because the radio and fir fluxes both trace the sfr , or because of a ` conspiracy ' in which both of the tracers under - predict the star formation rate by about the same amount . to distinguish between these possibilities",
    "we now check how the fir and radio fluxes separately compare to the fluxes that would be expected given their sfr and the radio and fir sfr calibrations for large galaxies .",
    "the various relevant calculated quantities for the different sub - samples and ugc 5456 , using the fluxes measured as described in the last section , are tabulated in table  [ tab : cal ] .",
    "the sfrs listed in column(2 ) were calculated using the calibrations given in @xcite , after accounting for foreground galactic extinction using extinction values of @xcite and formulae from @xcite .",
    "no correction for extinction due to dust within the galaxies were made , as such corrections are found to be small for the few brighter galaxies with detectable dust emission ( dust fluxes and flux limits for a large number of figgs galaxies can be found in @xcite ) .",
    "it is known that at low sfr the @xmath14  emission is suppressed compared to what one would expect from the calibration between sfr and @xmath14  flux at high sfr @xcite .",
    "the @xmath14  luminosities listed in column(3 ) are calibrated using the data for the figgs sample ( i.e. at low sfrs ) by @xcite .",
    "the luminosities listed in column(5 ) are estimated using the calibration of @xcite , which is obtained from the fit to data for high metallicity ( and more luminous ) galaxies ( their equation 18 ) . as can be seen by comparing columns(4 ) & ( 5 ) , our sample dwarfs have fainter 70@xmath2 m luminosities than expected from this calibration . @xcite",
    "proposed separate empirical calibrations of sfr with 1.4  ghz radio luminosity , for galaxies with luminosity less or more than l@xmath20 . for low luminosity galaxies",
    ", it was assumed that there was a non linear relation between the 1.4  ghz flux and the sfr .",
    "the non - linearity is in the sense that at low sfrs , the 1.4  ghz flux gets disproportionately fainter .",
    "@xcite proposed a particular functional form of this relation , chosen to ensure that the radio - fir correlation would be satisfied .",
    "column(7 ) gives the expected value using the calibration for luminous galaxies , while column(8 ) uses this proposed calibration for faint galaxies .",
    "as can be seen the radio luminosities measured by us compare better with the calibration for faint ( l@xmath3l@xmath20 ) galaxies , i.e. are consistent with a non - linear relation between the sfr and the 1.4  ghz flux . how the values listed in columns(9 ) through ( 11 ) were arrived at , are discussed in detail below .    from the values listed in table .",
    "[ tab : cal ] it is clear that our sample galaxies have fainter 70@xmath2 and @xmath26  ghz luminosities than expected from their sfr . in terms of the numerical modelling of @xcite , star - forming dwarf galaxies are neither radio nor fir calorimeters .",
    "however both these quantities are suppressed by approximately the same amount , and hence the radio - fir correlation continues to hold , i.e. the ` conspiracy ' alluded to by @xcite appears to hold for the faintest star forming galaxies .",
    "it is interesting to note in this context , that the formula given in @xcite for converting the 1.4 ghz flux into a sfr appears to work reasonably well for our galaxies , even though the 1.4 ghz flux levels of our sample is about an order of magnitude lower than the that in his sample .",
    "as discussed above the 1.4  ghz flux of our sample galaxies appears suppressed .",
    "it would be interesting to check if this translates into a change in the ratio of thermal to non - thermal emission .",
    "for example if the magnetic fields in dwarf galaxies are weak and/or cosmic ray confinement is less as compared to large galaxies , one would expect the non - thermal emission to be suppressed . to estimate the ratio of non - thermal and thermal parts of the radio flux from the sources , we use @xcite s method to estimate the thermal radio flux from the estimated @xmath14  flux .",
    "@xcite give a relation to compute the expected 5  ghz flux from the observed @xmath14  flux assuming case b recombination , electron density of 100 @xmath27 and temperature of 10,000  k. we translate this to the expected 1.4  ghz flux assuming a spectral index of @xmath28  = 0.1 ( @xmath29 ) for the thermal emission .",
    "this estimated thermal contribution to the 1.4  ghz luminosity is listed in col.(9 ) of table  [ tab : cal ] , while col.(10 ) gives the corresponding non - thermal fraction of the total 1.4  ghz emission .",
    "for normal spirals , typically 90% of the radio flux at 1.4 ghz is non - thermal in origin ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "in contrast , for our sample galaxies it appears that a significant fraction @xmath30 of the 1.4  ghz flux appears to be thermal in origin .",
    "we note that because of the uncertainties in the conversion from the fuv flux to the formation rate of massive stars ( see eg .",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and hence the thermal radio flux the possibility that all of the observed flux comes thermal emission can not be ruled out .",
    "earlier studies have found thermal fractions higher than those in normal spirals , in local group starburst dwarfs like ic 10 @xcite , in the smc @xcite and bcds @xcite .",
    "consistent with this , @xcite find that in ic10 the measured radio emission is much lower than what is expected from the sfr possibly due to escape of a substantial fraction of the cr electrons .",
    "next , from the non - thermal 1.4  ghz flux ( i.e. the difference between the total flux and the estimated thermal flux ) , the equipartition magnetic field can be estimated using the formulae given in @xcite .",
    "the basic assumption behind this calculation is the equipartition of energy densities between the magnetic field and the cosmic rays .",
    "we make the following other assumptions about various parameters : the synchrotron emission spectral index in 0.7 , the proton to electron number density is 100 , and magnetic field is totally turbulent with all possible inclinations between the field and the sky plane at different locations in the galaxy .",
    "the synchrotron pathlength through the galaxy is taken to be the minor axis length .",
    "dwarf galaxies have thick hi as well as stellar discs @xcite , with mean axial ratio for the hi disk @xmath31 .",
    "for the stacked sources , the mean holmberg diameter as listed in table  [ tab : samp ] is hence multiplied by 0.6 to obtain the minimum synchrotron pathlength .",
    "the estimated equipartition magnetic fields are listed in col .  (",
    "11 ) of table  [ tab : cal ] , and can be seen to be @xmath32 g .",
    "this is about 5 times lower than the magnetic field strength of normal spirals @xcite .",
    "we study the radio - fir correlation for some of the faintest known star forming galaxies using radio and fir flux estimates obtained by stacking the images of individual galaxies .",
    "we also use the observed sfr in these galaxies to estimate the expected amount of radio and fir flux , assuming the sfr calibrations that hold for large galaxies .",
    "we estimate the expected thermal radio emission at 1.4  ghz using the observed sfr , as well as the equipartition magnetic field .",
    "our findings are as follows :    1 .   for their measured sfr both the 70@xmath0  and 1.4 ghz flux for dwarf irregular galaxies",
    "is low compared to the calibration for large spirals . 2 .",
    "the ratio of 70@xmath0  to 1.4 ghz flux ( q70 ) however agrees within errorbars with that seen for larger galaxies .",
    "the radio - fir correlation thus appears to be the result of a ` conspiracy ' where both the 70@xmath0  to 1.4 ghz decrease non - linearly with sfr compared to large spirals .",
    "thus dwarf galaxies do not act as ` calorimeters ' for either cr electrons or uv photons .",
    "the inferred thermal fraction of the emission at 1.4  ghz for our sample galaxies is @xmath33 , much larger than the 10% typical for spirals .",
    "the estimated equipartition magnetic field is @xmath1 2 @xmath2 g , about 5 times smaller than the typical large - scale overall magnetic field in spirals .",
