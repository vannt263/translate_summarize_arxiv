    "it has long been recognised ( e.g. jura 1999 ) that the presence of infrared excesses in giant stars which have yet to evolve up the asymptotic giant branch may be due to the presence of long - lived debris discs around these stars .",
    "recent work on debris discs has concentrated on their properties during the main - sequence phase of stellar evolution but is becoming clear that some debris discs survive into the post - main sequence lives of stars , as exemplified by the white dwarfs g29 - 38 and gd  362 @xcite , and possibly around the central star of the helix nebula @xcite .",
    "the presence of detectable discs around evolved stars may provide useful information about processes in debris discs since they have radiation environments which are distinct from systems in which the host star is on the main - sequence .",
    "the study of debris discs might be especially fruitful for giant stars which have yet to ascend the asymptotic giant branch , since infrared emission is unlikely to be contaminated by emission from dust which has been lost from the star itself .    to date",
    ", several studies have been made into the incidence of infrared excesses in giants . in the main ,",
    "these studies have concentrated on the far - ir emission from giant stars .",
    "an important result from @xcite , which is based on detailed analysis of data from the _ iras _ faint source catalog @xcite , is that the incidence of 60 @xmath2 m excesses in giants of spectral type g and k is @xmath3 per  cent .    in the mid - ir ( i.e. wavelengths of order 10 @xmath2 m ) ,",
    "the incidence of excesses in g / k giants is not well determined .",
    "there have been indications that there are some such stars which do exhibit mid - ir excesses .",
    "for example , a study by @xcite , identifies four stars with spectral type g or k and with luminosity class iii which show an excess at wavelengths of @xmath4 m .",
    "another example of a g / k giant which shows mid - ir excesses is hd  233517 , which was subject to mid - ir spectroscopic observations using _ spitzer _ by @xcite , who concluded that this is likely to be a binary system with a peculiar history .",
    "an indication that some g / k giants may have mid - ir excesses is also evident from a study of mid - ir extinction by @xcite .",
    "these authors noted , in passing , that in a selected sample of red - clump stars ( which correspond to g / k giants ) there appeared to be a small proportion of stars which exhibit excesses at @xmath4 m in comparison to measured @xmath5 magnitudes ( see their figure  4 ) .",
    "indebetouw et al .",
    "attributed these mid - ir excesses to circumstellar dust but did not examine this population in detail .",
    "in particular , little attention was paid by these authors as to whether the stars with mid - ir excess are actually g / k giants . in this work",
    "i investigate a similarly selected population of stars , but take considerable care in the selection of such a population and to pay particular attention to determining the nature of stars which show mid - ir excesses .",
    "the aim of this study is to determine the incidence of excesses at 8@xmath6 m in g and k giants , and to use available near- and mid - infrared photometry to investigate the nature of the sources showing such excesses .",
    "the most straightforward approach to such a study would be to cross - correlate a large spectral class catalogue , such as the tycho-2 spectral catalog @xcite with a mid - ir catalogue such as the glimpse catalog @xcite .",
    "this approach was investigated but was found to be limited by the fact that the number of spectroscopically identified g / k giants returned by such a cross - matching is only of order of a few hundred , and of these , many are relatively bright and hence are saturated in one or more photometric bands of the _ spitzer _ irac instrument .",
    "so , while this approach is satisfactory for investigating mid - ir excesses in main - sequence stars ( and is the approach adopted by @xcite ) it returns too few matches to provide any useful information on the incidence of such excesses in g / k giants .",
    "the approach adopted here is to use a near - ir colour - magnitude diagram to select a large sample ( about @xmath7 ) of red - clump stars , and then to investigate in detail the stars from this sample which exhibit mid - ir excesses . in particular",
    ", i attempt to ascertain whether their spectral energy distributions are consistent with being g / k giants with excesses due to circumstellar dust and to rule out other plausible types of source .",
    "this paper is structured as follows : section 2 describes the data sets and the survey region adopted for this study and how a sample of red - clump giants was selected .",
    "section 3 reports on the subset of these sources which are identified as having a mid - ir excess .",
    "the implications of the observed incidence of genuine mid - ir excesses in g / k giants is discussed in section 4 .",
    "the basis of this study is to use a near - infrared colour - magnitude ( cm ) diagram to select a population of objects which have a high probability of being g or k giants .",
    "a distinctive feature of any deep cm diagram of a sample which contains evolved stars of near - solar metallicity is the presence of a feature arising from the so - called red - clump , which corresponds to the core - helium burning phase of intermediate mass stars .",
    "studies of the properties of red - clump giants , such as by @xcite identify such stars as being of spectral type g or k and of luminosity class iii ( i shall use the terms red - clump stars and g / k giants interchangeably here ) .",
    "stars which can be identified as belonging to this population have been used in a variety of contexts as standard candles ; for instance , to study galactic structure @xcite . in this study , the identification of red - clump stars is used as a basis for studying the properties of the stars themselves . in particular , the near - ir cm diagram is used to select a population of stars for which near and mid - ir photometry is available .",
    "a common choice of photometric bands which can be used to construct the required cm diagram is the near - ir @xmath8 and @xmath9 bands . in this study",
    "i use data from the 2mass point source catalog @xcite , which comprises @xmath8 , @xmath10 and @xmath5 photometric bands ( @xmath5 overlaps with the standard @xmath9 band , but is slightly narrower and has a centre - of - band wavelength of 2.15@xmath6 m ) .",
    "figure  1 shows the @xmath11 versus @xmath12 colour magnitude diagram for the chosen survey region ( a description of which is given below ) . in this diagram ,",
    "the red - clump stars form the band of sources stretching from @xmath13 , @xmath14 , down and to the right towards @xmath15 , @xmath16 .",
    "the identification of this feature with g / k giants is supported by its proximity to the expected locus of red - clump stars given a reasonable model for extinction along lines of sight in the survey region . if it is assumed that the extinction per unit distance in the @xmath5 band , @xmath17 , is uniform , then for a given value of @xmath17 , the tracks followed by different spectral classes of stars can be determined . adopting the values given by @xcite for canonical red - clump giants",
    ", that the absolute @xmath5 magnitude @xmath18 and the un - reddened colour @xmath19 , it is found that a good match between the red - clump feature and the expected location of such stars is obtained for @xmath20 ( indicated by the track labelled ` rcg ' in figure  [ figure : cmd ] ) .",
    "this value of @xmath17 is in good agreement with the extinction data of @xcite for the chosen survey region when determined over scales of several kiloparsecs .    to the left and slightly below this feature ( which i refer to as the red - clump band ) ,",
    "the sources which have @xmath11 in the range from 0 to about 1 , are likely to be main sequence stars @xcite , with later type stars showing relatively less reddening due to their proximity to the sun . to the right of the red - clump band",
    "the cm diagram is populated by giants ascending the giant branch and the asymptotic giant branch .",
    "the degree of discrimination between red - clump giants and later type giants is illustrated in figure  [ figure : cmd ] , which also shows the expected loci of stars of type m0iii and m5iii ( with @xmath11 colours as given by @xcite , and absolute magnitudes derived from values given by @xcite ) under the assumption of the same extinction model as adopted for the displayed locus of rcg stars .",
    "it can be concluded that the red - clump is a clearly defined feature in the colour - magnitude diagram .        the survey area for this study",
    "was selected such that mid - ir photometry could be obtained from the glimpse catalog @xcite .",
    "glimpse is a survey of the galactic plane ( @xmath21 and @xmath22 ) made using the four wavelength bands ( 3.6 , 4.5 , 5.8 and 8.0@xmath6 m ) of the irac instrument on _ spitzer _ @xcite .",
    "a preliminary study for this work was based on the version 1 release of the glimpse catalogues ( released april 2005 ) , while the results presented here are based on the version  2 release ( april 2007 ) unless otherwise indicated .",
    "any direction in the glimpse survey region has a long line - of - sight through the disc of the galaxy .",
    "this is advantageous in terms of the numbers of red - clump stars that can be detected , but , of course , the survey regions are subject to relatively high levels of extinction . such extinction , corresponding to column densities of order @xmath23 , is not an issue as such , but it is important to appreciate that variation of extinction across a survey region will lead to a loss of definition ( i.e. a broadening ) of the red - clump band in the resulting cm diagram . in choosing any extended survey area , some variation of extinction is inevitable , but this variation can be reduced by excluding regions with a high content of molecular gas . in choosing the survey region ,",
    "the aim was to maximise the area covered subject to the constraint of avoiding regions of high column density in molecular gas .",
    "this was done by avoiding known star formation regions , and by choosing a region of relatively low column density in molecular hydrogen from inspection of the co emission map of @xcite .",
    "the region used for this study is defined by @xmath24 and @xmath25 . for the area covered by the glimpse survey , the selected region has relatively low column densities of co.    the number of 2mass sources with measured values of @xmath8 and @xmath5 in the selected region is 93888 .",
    "the extent of the survey area is such that about @xmath7 clump giants would be included in the final sample , which is sufficient to measure the incidence of mid - ir excesses at a level of order 0.1 per  cent .",
    "as noted above , the selection of red - clump sources is based on the ( @xmath26)-@xmath5 cm diagram .",
    "rather than using all sources with 2mass @xmath8 and @xmath5 data , preliminary studies revealed that an improvement in the degree of contrast between the red - clump and the main sequence features can be achieved by requiring that included sources are detected the all 2mass bands and the 3.6 , 4.5 and 5.8 @xmath2 m bands of the glimpse catalog .",
    "the number of sources in the survey region which satisfy this criterion is 53520 and it is these sources which are shown in the cm diagram in figure  [ figure : cmd ] .",
    "stars which have a high probability of being g / k giants were selected by following the leftmost side of the the red - clump band which is evident in figure  [ figure : cmd ] .",
    "while such a selection is somewhat subjective , using the left - hand side of the red - clump distribution in this way should minimise contamination of the sample from stars ascending the giant branch / asymptotic giant branch .",
    "the selection criterion used was that @xmath27 and that @xmath11 should lie within @xmath28 magnitudes of the straight line defined by @xmath29 this selection region is overlaid on figure  [ figure : cmd ] .",
    "note that the cutoff at @xmath30 was determined by the fact that at lower magnitudes the locus of the red - clump band becomes difficult to trace due to the small number of sources in this part of the cm diagram .",
    "it can be seen from figure  [ figure : cmd ] that this selection region is only an approximation to the expected track followed by red - clump stars under a model of uniform extinction per unit distance , but is a reasonable method of selecting such stars in the interval @xmath31 ( in fact , the faint cut - off adopted in this work is brighter than @xmath32 , see below ) .",
    "the cm diagram and selection region shown in figure  [ figure : cmd ] allows an estimate to be made of the maximum amount of contamination of the red - clump region by main - sequence stars .",
    "the profile of the distribution at constant @xmath5 was examined at @xmath33 .",
    "the profile reveals a bimodal distribution with peaks due to main - sequence and evolved stars . at the minimum between the peaks of this distribution , the density of main - sequence sources is about 10  per cent of the source density in the red - clump band . since this minimum lies somewhat to the left of the red - clump band , and",
    "assuming that the density of main - sequence stars decreases as ( @xmath26 ) increases , the contamination of main - sequence stars in the selected region will be less than 10  per cent : a reasonable estimate on an upper limit to the contamination would be at the level of a few percent .",
    "in addition to adopting selection criteria which isolate red - clump stars , it is also important to choose a faint cut - off in the value of @xmath5 .",
    "this serves to reduce the bias inherent to detecting excesses at @xmath34 m when many stars are close to the detection threshold at this wavelength .",
    "ideally , it would be best to select a cut - off in @xmath5 which results in all sources being detected at @xmath34 m .",
    "however , such a constraint leads to the rejection of a large proportion of the data .",
    "i investigated ( using version  1 of glimpse ) how the detectability of red - clump sources at @xmath34 m varies with @xmath5 and found that at @xmath35 , 85 per  cent of sources were detected .",
    "this cut - off in @xmath5 was adopted as being a reasonable compromise between expected detection and source numbers . with these criteria applied ( @xmath36 and equation  [ eqn : redclump ] )",
    "the number of red - clump sources selected is 9865 .",
    "this sample forms the basis of the study of mid - ir excesses .",
    "an indication of the incidence of sources with excesses at @xmath4 m in the sample is revealed by the @xmath37)$]-@xmath11 colour - colour diagram of the selected sample of red - clump sources ( figure  [ figure : jh_hk]a ) . it can be seen that there is a small number ( about 20 ) of sources with excesses in @xmath37)$ ] which set them clearly apart from the main distribution of sources .",
    "sources with less pronounced , but still significant excesses , can only be identified from more detailed analysis as described below .",
    "it can also be seen from figure  [ figure : jh_hk]a that the effects of interstellar reddening are apparent in the distribution of sources , with a trend for @xmath37)$ ] to increase with increasing @xmath11 .",
    "it is therefore useful to define a colour @xmath37)_{0}$ ] which includes the effects of reddening .",
    "the results of indebetouw et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , and in particular , their best - fitting straight line to ( @xmath38-k_{s}$])-(@xmath26 ) data ( as shown in their figure  4a and reproduced here on figure  [ figure : jh_hk]a ) , allows this to be calculated as @xmath39)_{0 } = ( k_{s}-[8.0])-0.37 \\times ( j - k_{s})+0.17\\ ] ] for the sample of red - clump sources described above , the mean value , @xmath40)_{0 } \\rangle$ ] is @xmath41 .",
    "the colour excess of any source is given by a colour excess defined by @xmath42)_{0}- \\langle ( k_{s}-[8.0])_{0 } \\rangle $ ]    sources which are candidates for stars having excesses at @xmath34 m were selected using the criterion @xmath43 the significance level here is determined by the sample size : it is chosen such that given a gaussian distribution in @xmath44 , it would be expected that there would be only one source in a sample size of @xmath45 which would exceed this value . on applying the above criterion , 52 sources were identified as candidate mid - ir excess sources .",
    "in order to confirm or reject the candidate excess sources , the following approach was taken .",
    "firstly , where doubts exist over the reliability of a source , it was culled from the sample .",
    "the remaining sources were then analysed in two ways : on the basis of their near - infrared colours and by modelling of the photometric data .      the first stage in checking source reliability was to inspect the glimpse catalog source quality flag ( sqf ) for each source .",
    "of the 52 candidate sources , 14 had sqf flags set which indicated confusion in in - band or cross - band merging .",
    "two further sources were flagged as being potentially affected by banding correction and a single source was flagged as being possibly contaminated by stray light .",
    "in addition to the sqf data provided in the glimpse catalog , the @xmath34 m glimpse image atlas ( version 2 ) was visually inspected to check for artefacts which might have given rise to anomalous @xmath34 m fluxes .",
    "the highest resolution ( 0.6 arcsec pixel size ) @xmath34 m glimpse atlas images were used to check for anomalies .",
    "fields of extent 1.2 arcmin around source positions were inspected and six sources ( which would have been accepted on the basis of their sqf value of zero ) were rejected on the basis of their appearance .",
    "four of these sources appear to be affected by stray light contamination at @xmath34 m , while two are very close to relatively bright multiple sources .",
    "all six of these sources are also deemed to be of questionable reliability and , together with the 17 sources identified by their sqf values , were rejected from the candidate list .",
    "the 2mass and glimpse photometry for the remaining 29 candidate sources is given in table  [ table : candidates ] .",
    "note that hereafter , individual sources are referred to by the identifier ( i d . ) given in this table .",
    "some evidence as to the nature of the stars exhibiting 8  @xmath2 m excesses can be determined by inspection of the @xmath47-@xmath48 colour - colour diagram ( figure  [ figure : jh_hk]b ) .",
    "the locations of the candidate 8  @xmath2 m excess sources are indicated by the numerical identifier given in table  [ table : candidates ] .",
    "the vast majority of the sources in this diagram are distributed in a band which corresponds well to the expected location of g / k giants under different amounts of extinction ( for reference , a reddening vector is shown which indicates the expected direction of the distribution of stars of type k0iii ) . while the majority of candidate 8  @xmath2 m excess sources lie within the region populated by reddened g / k giants , it is notable that seven of the candidate excess sources have @xmath47 values which are substantially lower than would be expected from their @xmath48 colour ( these are sources with identifiers 10 , 13 , 17 , 18 , 23 , 26 and 29 ) .",
    "if these sources are g / k giants , they would appear to have anomalous near - ir colours .",
    "the remaining 22 candidate sources appear to be consistent with being g / k giants . further investigation ( below ) uses the available 7-band photometry available to model these sources .",
    "the 29 sources with excesses in their @xmath37)_{0}$ ] colours were further analysed to attempt to determine if these sources were likely to be g / k giants with excesses at @xmath34 m , or if they have some other origin .",
    "as noted above , the sample of red - clump stars is expected to be contaminated by other types of source at the level of maybe as much as a few percent .",
    "however , it could plausibly be the case that it is these contaminating stars which give rise to the sources detected with 8 excesses .",
    "hence it is important then to consider whether the detected excess sources could be other types of star .",
    "the approach taken was to use the data from the seven photometric bands ( @xmath8 , @xmath10 , @xmath5 , @xmath49 m , @xmath50 m , @xmath51 m , and @xmath52 m ) to compare to the spectra from a selection of plausible models .",
    "clearly , one model which needs to be tested is that of a red - clump giant with a mid - ir excess . as a reference point",
    ", it is useful to define a ` canonical ' red - clump giant using the results of the study of @xcite .",
    "the subset of metal rich ( @xmath53>-0.3 $ ] ) clump giants in their study have a mean effective temperature of @xmath54 and surface gravity of @xmath55 .",
    "the canonical red - clump giant can be approximated by the closest kurucz model ( see below ) , which has @xmath56 , and @xmath57 .    in model",
    "fitting however , i adopted a range of giant star models with a range of surface temperatures from 3500  k to 6500  k. this is a wider temperature range than would be expected for red - clump giants , but provides a useful check that individual stars are not better modelled as cooler or hotter stars .",
    "this , and all other photospheric emission ( in other models described below ) was modelled using a kurucz spectral model @xcite with solar metallicity ( also , the particular set of models used have a turbulent velocity of @xmath58 ) .",
    "the temperature resolution of the published grid of kurucz models is 250  k.    the mid - ir excess is modelled as a component which only contributes significantly to the @xmath34 m band .",
    "this was implemented as a gaussian component at a wavelength of @xmath59 m with @xmath60 m , with only the normalisation of this parameter being allowed to vary . while this component is a reasonable representation of a pah feature observed in the spectrum of hd  233517 @xcite",
    "it should be stressed that an excess in one photometric band could be modelled in a variety of ways , and that i do not claim any particular significance to modelling the excess in this way .",
    "a quite different set of stars which are known to show mid - ir excesses are hot stars with infrared excesses arising from bremsstrahlung emission from plasma surrounding the star @xcite .",
    "such sources are detected in considerable numbers by @xcite and @xcite and are believed to occur for stars of spectral type b8 or earlier .",
    "consequently i also examine a hot star model comprising a main - sequence b8 star and bremsstrahlung emission from a plasma at a temperature of @xmath61 .",
    "note that as far as fitting to the combined 2mass and glimpse photometry is concerned , the model is rather insensitive to the exact stellar type : the choice of b8v is a conservative one which represents the coolest and lowest luminosity star that might plausibly also exhibit an infrared excess due to bremsstrahlung emission .",
    "a component of all of the fitted models was the inclusion of extinction due to interstellar dust .",
    "the extinction values used were taken from the publicly available synthetic extinction curves which are based on the grain model of @xcite and the grain size distribution of @xcite .",
    "the particular extinction curve used was the one for which @xmath62 and which these authors consider to provide a good match to the extinction properties of diffuse hi clouds in the milky way .",
    "for all of the models , three parameters were fitted : the normalisation @xmath63 of the stellar spectral component , the normalisation of either the bremsstrahlung component or of the gaussian line at @xmath59 m , and the line - of - sight column density @xmath64 .",
    "in addition to these parameters , note that for the red - clump giant model , the fitting was conducted across a range temperatures ( as described above ) in order to also determine the photospheric temperature .",
    "a spectrophotometric distance @xmath65 to the star can be derived from the normalisation parameter @xmath63 by @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the stellar radius .",
    "stellar radii were estimated by assuming blackbody emission and relationships between stellar luminosity and temperature as given by @xcite .",
    "it is important to appreciate that the spectral resolution provided by the seven photometric bands used here is , in general , insufficient to provide any clear discrimination in luminosity class : data which are well modelled as a g / k giant with a gaussian excess at @xmath34 m , will also be acceptably fitted by models in which the star is a g / k dwarf or supergiant .",
    "models in which the star is modelled as a dwarf and as a supergiant were also fitted to obtain spectrophotometric distances and values of column density for the excess sources . in order to investigate whether these models could be plausible , a set of neighbouring ( non - excess ) red - clump giants was used to estimate the column density in the direction of each candidate excess source .",
    "the set of neighbouring sources for each candidate excess source was defined as those sources which were selected according to the red - clump criterion ( equation  [ eqn : redclump ] ) and which lie within 5  arcmin of the position of the excess source and which have @xmath5 within 0.2 mag of this source . in fitting to these neighbouring red - clump giants ,",
    "the canonical red - clump stellar model was assumed ( i.e. @xmath56 , and @xmath57 ) .",
    "the fitting process returned a column density and flux normalisation ( @xmath63 ) for each source , allowing a mean column density and mean spectrophotometric distance for the neighbouring red - clump stars to be determined .",
    "these values for a so - called ` neighbouring field ' are given in table  [ table : fitting ] and are discussed further in section  3.4 ."
