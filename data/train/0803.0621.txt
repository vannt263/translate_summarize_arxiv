    "rotation has been identified as an important physics ingredient which needs to be considered to understand the evolution of massive star ( e.g. , heger , langer & woosley 2000 ; meynet & maeder 2000 ) .",
    "it is thought to gives rise to physical effects inside stars which cause observable quantities to change , and may even radically alter the evolutionary path of the stars .",
    "a drastic example is the occurrence of chemically homogeneous evolution , which may provide a progenitor path towards long gamma - ray bursts ( yoon & langer 2005 , yoon et al .",
    "2006 , woosley & heger 2006 ) .",
    "one of the most relevant prediction of massive star models with rotation is that rotationally triggered internal transport processes are capable to bring nuclear processed material , most notably nitrogen , from the convective core of massive main sequence stars into their radiative envelope . for fast enough rotation , fresh nitrogen thus appears at the surface of the star , and becomes continuously more enriched as function of time during core hydrogen burning .",
    "numerous incidental evidences have been collected from observations which are in support of this picture ( cf .",
    "maeder & meynet 2000 , and references therein ) .",
    "however , while many observations refer to stars in their post - main sequence stages , abundance analyses of main sequence stars have mostly been restricted to apparent slow rotators and to rather small groups of stars .",
    "a major step forward in comparing massive star models and observations is provided by the flames survey of massive stars , which encompassed many hundred o and early b main sequence stars in the galaxy and the magellanic clouds ( evans et al .",
    "the b  star sample of this survey was analyzed in a way which allowed for the first time to obtain quantitative constrains on the nitrogen enhancement also in a large number of rapid rotators ( hunter et al .",
    "2008 , fig .  1 )",
    "surprisingly , hunter et al . could not unambiguously conclude that the effects of rotation are observed as expected .",
    "they rather found two groups of rapid rotators , one with significant enrichment and one without ( the latter being dubbed group  1 in fig .  1 ) .",
    "both groups contain stars which are close to core hydrogen exhaustion , as indicated by their low surface gravity .    ) against the projected rotational velocity ( @xmath0 ) for core hydrogen burning objects in two lmc fields centered on n11 and ngc2004 , according to hunter et al .",

    "the mean uncertainty in the nitrogen abundance is 0.25dex while that in @xmath0 is 10% .",
    "the bulk of the stars occupy a region at low @xmath0 and show little or modest nitrogen enrichment .",
    "the stellar evolution tracks are computed for an initial mass of 13@xmath1 corresponding to the average mass of the sample stars , and their rotational velocity has been multiplied by @xmath2/4 to account for random inclinations .",

    "( 2008 ) gave two possible ways of interpretation .",
    "the one which saves the current picture of rotational mixing is that the enriched fast rotators in the flames sample are indeed single stars , while the non - enriched fast rotators have a peculiar binary history .",
    "an observing campaign is underway to test the hypothesis that these latter stars are indeed all binaries  for which in the current flames data there is no clear evidence .",
    "alternatively , the results of hunter et al .",
    "( 2008 ) could imply that rotational mixing is not efficient , and that the enriched fast rotators are all spun - up accretion stars in binaries .",
    "the worry that the latter might be true is strengthened by the finding of yet another discrete group of massive main sequence stars by hunter et al .",
    "( 2008 ; named group  2 in fig .  1 ) , namely intrinsically slowly rotating stars with a strong nitrogen enhancement .",
    "while this group of stars clearly needs an alternative explanation , it appears likely that previous reports of nitrogen enrichment in massive main sequence stars which served as support for rotational mixing picked up stars comparable to those in group  2 , as they were limited to low projected rotational velocities .    in the following ,",
    "we discuss which possibilities are supported by current models of massive close binaries .",
    "as mentioned above , it appears impossible to understand the nitrogen pattern in fast rotators without invoking close binaries .",
    "one may actually wonder whether even _ all _ fast rotators could be produced by close binary effects .",
    "massive close binary evolution is modeled by various groups ( e.g. , podsiadlowski et al .",
    "1992 , wellstein & langer 1999 , belczynski et al .",
    "2002 , vanbeveren et al .",
    "2007 , vazquez et al . 2007 ) .",
    "however , in order to predict the surface nitrogen abundances and the rotational velocities of binary components , a rather large amount of physical effects needs to be considered in binary evolution models .",
    "it is desirable to include , in such binary models , the physics of rotation as it is currently used in models of rotating massive single stars .",
    "the reason is that in close binaries , even rather small amounts of matter transferred during roche - lobe overflow spins up the mass gainer to extreme rotation rates ( packet 1981 ) .",

    "heger et al .",
    "( 2005 ) showed that without this effect , young neutron stars are predicted to spin too rapidly .",
    "suijs et al .",
    "( 2008 ) showed that magnetic transport is also required to prevent too fast rotation in white dwarfs ( fig .  2 ) .    for binary evolution models ,",
    "there are two more pieces of physics which need to be included , which both relate to angular momentum exchange between the components of a binary system .",
    "mass transfer within the roche approximation is commonly applied in binary evolution calculations , but the corresponding angular momentum transfer is mostly neglected .",
    "the latter is crucial to model the spin - up of the accretion star , and thus to represent the most rapidly rotating stars at all .",
    "spin - orbit coupling through tides is the other unmissable ingredient in close binary models , as it can lead to significant spin - down ( mostly ! ) or spin - up ( rarely ) in massive binaries with periods below 10 ... 20  d.    wellstein ( 2001 ) and petrovic et al .",

    "3 shows that mass gainers become more luminous the more mass they gain .",
    "however , if the accreted amount of matter is large , and if it occurs late enough during the core hydrogen burning evolution of the mass gainer , its rejuvenation , i.e. in particular the growth of its convective core to adapt to the increased stellar mass , might be avoided ( braun & langer 1995 ) . in this case , core helium burning may take place very close to the main sequence , i.e. , helium burning stars may be mistaken for main sequence stars . in this respect ,",
    "we point out that hunter et al .",
    "( 2008 ) interpreted the sharp drop of the projected rotational as function of surface gravity as signaling the cool end of the main sequence band .",
    "the increased luminosity of the mass gainers , which is also clearly visible in the evolutionary tracks shown in fig .  4 , may cause them to appear as blue stragglers in samples of stars with similar age ( cf . , pols & marinus 1994 ) .",
    "if then a sample of stars is defined through a visual magnitude cut - off , which might favor evolved main sequence stars near the turn - off , it is conceivable that mass gainers constitute a significant fraction of the whole sample .",
    "in order to model the distribution of stars in fig .  1 , one requires a distribution function for the initial rotational velocity of single stars ( irf ) .",
    "however , what can be measured is only the present - day distribution of rotational velocities ( prf ) .",
    "5 gives an example derived within the flames survey , which is the prf of the o  stars in an smc field centered on ngc  346 ( mokiem et al .",

    "worrisome about fig .",
    "5 is that all but the fastest three rotators have rotation rates of less than a quarter of critical rotation , while two of the three fast rotators appear to be runaway stars .",

    ", scaledwidth=98.0% ]    the surface nitrogen abundance of mass gainers in close binary systems can be affected in two major ways .",
    "first of all , the matter which is accreted from the companion is often nitrogen - rich , as it stems from deep layers of the initial primary .",
    "while the transferred matter may be very nitrogen - rich , with values close to cno - equilibrium being reached toward the end of the mass transfer , the enrichment on the mass gainer remains limited since thermohaline mixing dilutes the accreted matter with its whole envelope .",
    "figure  9 gives an idea of the maximum obtainable enrichment , which , in the mass range considered here , amounts typically to 0.6  dex , where some case  a systems can produce as much as 0.8  dex .",
    "non - conservative systems , where much of the overflowing matter is ejected from the binary system , are expected to obtain substantially smaller enrichments .",
    "secondly , nitrogen can be enhanced in mass gainers due to rotational mixing",
    ". since these stars are amongst the most rapidly rotating main sequence stars , rotational mixing in these stars might be substantial .",
    "in fact the second panel in fig .",
    "6 shows that , while accretion has raised the nitrogen surface mass fraction by @xmath80.4  dex , it furtheron slowly increases to a total enrichement of almost @xmath80.7  dex .",
    "10 shows a more dramatic example : the same binary system as shown in fig .  6 , but with an initial period of 6  d instead of 3  d , accelerates its mass gainer to a rotational velocity of almost 500@xmath9 , which gives an extra nitrogen enrichment of more than a factor two , to about 1  dex in total .",
    "at low metallicity , cantiello et al .",
    "( 2007 ) has found that the mass gainer of a 16@xmath1 + 15@xmath1 system with an initial period of 5  d evolves chemically homogeneously after the case  b mass transfer event .",
    "so we see that , quite naturally , close binaries produce rapidly rotating nitrogen - rich stars .",
    "this remains true if rotational mixing is completely neglected , where the nitrogen enhancement would just be a factor of 2 ... 3 . with rotational mixing included , a factor of  10 can be reached .    but fig .",
    "10 also shows that binaries can indeed produce rapid rotators with little enrichment ( cf .",
    "lower two panels in fig .",
    "note that the highly non - conservative evolution which is required to obtain this may be largely underrepresented in fig .",
    "10 , as the corresponding binary evolution models are numerically difficult .    finally , as the post - mass transfer period in very close systems can lead to rapid tidal spin - down ( e.g. , in the 2.15  d binary shown in fig .",
    "10 ) , close binaries may also produce slowly rotating nitrogen - rich main sequence stars .",
    "we have shown above that an effort is needed to compare the predictions of stellar evolution theory with the new results derived from the flames survey of massive stars ( cf .",
    "fig .  1 ) .",
    "in particular , binary evolution models which include rotational mixing , mass and angular momentum transfer , and tidal interaction are required , of which only few exist today ( cf . ,",
    "10 can not be directly compared with fig .",
    "1 . it does not contain a clean population study , and can therefore only indicate which parts of the diagram might be populated by binary systems , but not how many stars one might expect in those parts .",
    "nevertheless , it appears rather striking that the few models shown in fig .",
    "10 can populate each part of the diagram in which fig .",
    "1 shows a significant density of stars .",
    "in fact , one may ask the question whether single stars are needed at all to understand fig .  1 , except for the slowly rotating non - enriched stars .",
    "this question ties in with the one asked in sect .  4 :",
    "could all rapid rotators be spun - up mass gainers and merger products ?",
    "while it seems difficult to answer this question currently , the following statement seems secure : the flames result shows that it is impossible to understand the nitrogen enhancement in massive stars without considering binary evolution . whether the same statement can be made for single stars is questioned by the results shown above .",
