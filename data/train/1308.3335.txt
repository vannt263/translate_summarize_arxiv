    "numerical methods for two - phase incompressible flows have many important applications , which range from bubble column reactors to ink - jet printing to fuel injection in engines and to biomedical engineering .",
    "in contrast to one - phase flows , several new aspects arise in the numerical treatment of two - phase flows . _",
    "first _ of all a computational technique for the _ numerical treatment of the unknown interface _ has to be developed .",
    "one class of approaches is based on interface capturing methods using an indicator function to describe the interface .",
    "the volume of fluid ( vof ) method and the level set method fall into this category . in the former ,",
    "the characteristic function of one of the phases is approximated numerically , see e.g.  @xcite ; whereas in the latter , the interface is given as the level set of a function , which has to be determined , see e.g.  @xcite . in phase field methods",
    "the interface is assumed to have a small , but positive , thickness and an additional parabolic equation , defined in the whole domain , has to be solved in these so - called diffuse interface models .",
    "we refer to @xcite for details . in this paper",
    "we use a direct description of the interface using a parameterization of the unknown surface .",
    "in such an approach the interface is approximated by a polyhedral surface , see @xcite , and equations on the surface mesh have to be coupled to quantities defined on the bulk mesh .",
    "we refer e.g.  to @xcite for further details , and to @xcite for the related immersed boundary method .",
    "_ secondly _ it is important to _ numerically approximate capillarity effects _ in an accurate and stable way . in two - phase flows , or in",
    "free surface flows , capillarity effects , which are given by quantities involving the curvature of the interface , often determine the flow behaviour to a large extent .",
    "typically an explicit treatment of surface tension forces ( also called capillary forces ) leads to severe restrictions on the time step , see e.g.@xcite , and so more advanced approaches use an implicit treatment .",
    "this approach is discussed e.g.  in @xcite for the level set approach , and in @xcite for the parametric approach .",
    "we note that an inadequate approximation of capillarity effects can trigger oscillations of the velocity at the interface , which can lead to so - called spurious currents , see e.g.  @xcite . in this paper",
    "we propose an implicit treatment of the surface tension forces that leads to an unconditionally stable approximation of two - phase navier  stokes flow .    in each of the approaches mentioned above ( parametric approach , level set method , volume of fluid method , phase field method )",
    "surface tension forces , and hence curvature quantities , have to be computed .",
    "a particular successful method , in the context of the parametric approach and the level set method , is to compute the mean curvature of the approximated interface with the help of a discretization of the identity @xmath0 here @xmath1 is a parameterization of the interface , @xmath2 is the laplace ",
    "beltrami operator , @xmath3 is the sum of the principal curvatures ( often simply called the mean curvature ) and @xmath4 is a unit normal to the interface .",
    "this identity was used for the numerical approximation of curvature driven interface evolution for the first time by dziuk , @xcite .",
    "later this idea was used in e.g.  @xcite , among others , in the context of capillarity driven free surface and two - phase flows .",
    "the approximation of curvature in the present paper also relies on the identity ( [ eq : lbop ] ) .",
    "a _ third _ important issue relevant for the simulation of two - phase flows is to ensure _ a good approximation of the interface _ and in particular _ a good mesh quality _ during the evolution . in phase field methods refinement of the mesh close to the interface and choosing the interface width sufficiently small ensures good approximation properties of the interface .",
    "however , this leads to high computational costs . in volume of fluid methods the interface has to be reconstructed after an advection step of the characteristic function .",
    "although , second order reconstruction methods exist , see e.g.  @xcite , it still remains challenging to approximate geometric quantities , such as the mean curvature and the normal of the interface , accurately .    in level set methods",
    "the level set function is advected with the fluid velocity .",
    "this typically leads to distortions of the level set function , which in turn leads to a poor approximation of the interface .",
    "hence so - called re - initialization steps have to be performed frequently after some time steps , see e.g.   @xcite for details .",
    "in the parametric approach the interface parameterization is transported with the help of the fluid velocity , see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "typically this leads to degeneracies in the mesh , e.g.  coalescence of mesh points and very small angles in the polyhedral interface mesh .",
    "often severe reparameterization steps have to be employed , or the computation even has to be stopped . in our approach",
    "the interface is advected in the normal direction with the normal part of the fluid velocity , but _ the tangential degrees of freedom are implicitly used to ensure a good mesh quality_. this treatment of the interface is based on earlier work of the authors on the numerical approximation of geometric evolution equations and on free boundary problems related to crystal growth , see e.g.   @xcite .    a _",
    "fourth _ issue is the _ approximation of the pressure _ , which is discontinuous across the interface due to capillarity effects .",
    "there are three approaches to handle this in the parametric or level set approach for the interface , combined with a finite element approximation of the fluid quantities .",
    "one is to use a fitted bulk mesh that is adapted to the interface , see e.g.   @xcite . in the case of an unfitted bulk mesh , where the interface and bulk meshes are totally independent",
    ", one can augment the pressure finite element space with additional degrees of freedom in elements of the bulk mesh , which cut the interface .",
    "this is an example of the extended finite element method ( xfem ) , see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "a simpler approach is just to adapt the bulk mesh in the vicinity of the interface , which we adopt in this paper .",
    "however , the xfem or the fitted approaches could be used in our approximation , see subsection [ sec:33 ] for a discussion of the latter .",
    "finally , a _",
    "fifth _ issue is the _ volume ( area in 2d ) conservation of the two phases_. we achieve this by a very simple xfem approach , where the pressure space is enriched by one extra degree of freedom .",
    "this leads to exact volume conservation for a semidiscrete continuous - in - time version of our scheme .",
    "moreover , the fully discrete scheme shows good volume conservation properties in practice .",
    "to summarize , in this paper we extend our parametric approximation of two - phase stokes flow in @xcite to two - phase navier ",
    "stokes flow with different densities .",
    "we present a _ linear scheme _",
    ", i.e.  a linear system of equations has to be solved at each time level , for this problem , which leads to _ an unconditional stability bound_. although , there already exists such a stability bound for a nonlinear scheme for free capillary flows , see @xcite ; to our knowledge the stability proof in this paper is the first one for a linear scheme , and the first one for two - phase flows .    finally , let us mention that developing and analyzing numerical methods for two - phase flows is a very active research field , and we refer to @xcite for some examples of recent contributions .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows . in section  [ sec : two ]",
    "we give a precise mathematical formulation of the two - phase navier  stokes problem . in section  [ sec:2 ]",
    "we introduce a weak formulation for the resulting problem that will form the basis of our novel finite element approximation , which we consider in section  [ sec:3 ] .",
    "there we show that our approximation is unconditionally stable , and introduce our xfem approach for volume conservation . in section  [ sec:4 ]",
    "we discuss how the arising discrete system of linear equations at each time level can be solved in practice .",
    "finally , in section  [ sec:5 ] we discuss our mesh adaptation algorithms , and then present several numerical experiments in section  [ sec:6 ] .",
    "in this paper we consider two - phase flows in a given domain @xmath5 , where @xmath6 or @xmath7 .",
    "the domain @xmath8 contains two different immiscible incompressible phases ( liquid - liquid or liquid - gas ) which for all @xmath9 $ ] occupy time dependent regions @xmath10 and @xmath11 and which are separated by an interface @xmath12}$ ] , @xmath13 .",

    "the main advantages of the fitted mesh approach ( [ eq : fit ] ) over the unfitted approach are that ( a ) with the elements ( [ eq : p2p0],c ) the discontinuity in the pressure at @xmath170 can be resolved and that ( b ) the inner products @xmath343 in ( [ eq : hga],c ) now only involve integration over edges / faces of bulk elements @xmath153 , which is standard .",
    "a further consequence of ( a ) is that for the elements ( [ eq : p2p0],c ) it automatically holds that @xmath344 is an admissible test function in ( [ eq : hgb ] ) , which yields ( [ eq : consm ] ) , and so approximate volume conservation on the fully discrete level .",
    "an additional advantages of the fitted mesh approach is that , since @xmath345 , it holds that ( [ eq : rhoma],b ) reduce to @xmath346 and @xmath347 .",
    "we stress that the fitted mesh approach ( [ eq : fit ] ) for ( [ eq : hga]d ) would also satisfy the stability result ( [ eq : stab ] ) .",
    "however , due to the nature of the moving bulk mesh , the assumptions of theorem  [ thm : stabstab ] , for @xmath348 , in general do not hold , and so the stability result ( [ eq : stabstab ] ) need not hold over several time steps .",
    "another disadvantage of the fitted mesh approach is that at every time step , due to the fact that the underlying bulk mesh changes globally , the obtained velocity solution @xmath224 needs to be appropriately interpolated on the new mesh @xmath342 .",
    "these interpolation errors may significantly impact on the accuracy of the approximation .",
    "a variant of the method described above , which avoids the repeated interpolation onto a new finite element bulk mesh , is the so - called arbitrary lagrangian eulerian ( ale ) approach , see @xcite . here",
    "a prescribed flow drives the movement of the bulk mesh vertices , and this prescribed flow needs to be accounted for in the approximation of the momentum equation .",
    "this means that at present it does not appear possible to prove a stability result similar to theorem  [ thm : stabstab ] for the ale approach . on the other hand",
    ", the fact that the movement of the bulk mesh is incorporated in the finite element approximation means that an interpolation of finite element data after every time step is not needed .",
    "the prescribed bulk mesh flow is usually chosen in a way to obtain a good quality bulk mesh . however , in practice the ale moving mesh approach may fail if the approximated phases change their shape dramatically , as was reported in e.g.  @xcite for the two - dimensional test case 2 there . in higher space dimensions such pathological mesh defects are more frequent , which poses a significant computational challenge . for further details on the ale approach for two - phase navier ",

    "now all the elements marked for refinement are halved into two smaller elements with the help of a simple bisectioning procedure , see @xcite for details . in order to avoid hanging nodes , this will in general lead to refinements of elements",
