    "one - dimensional metallic electron systems are always strongly affected by interactions . at low energy scales",
    "many observables obey anomalous power laws , known as luttinger - liquid behavior , which is very different from conventional fermi - liquid behavior describing most higher dimensional metals.@xcite for spin - rotation invariant systems all power - law exponents can be expressed in terms of a single nonuniversal parameter @xmath1 . for luttinger liquids with repulsive interactions ( @xmath2 ) already one static impurity has a strong effect at low energy scales , even when the impurity potential is relatively weak.@xcite the asymptotic low - energy properties of luttinger liquids with a single impurity have been investigated already in the 1990s .",
    "@xcite for electron systems ( spin-@xmath0 fermions ) with @xmath2 the essential properties can be summarized as follows .",
    "the backscattering amplitude generated by a weak impurity is a relevant perturbation which grows as @xmath3 for a decreasing energy scale @xmath4 .",
    "on the other hand , the tunneling amplitude through a weak link between two otherwise separate wires scales to zero as @xmath5 , with the boundary exponent @xmath6 . at low energy scales",
    "any impurity thus effectively `` cuts '' the system in two parts with open boundary conditions at the end points , and physical observables are controlled by the open chain fixed point.@xcite in particular , the local density of states near the impurity is suppressed as @xmath7 for @xmath8 , and the conductance vanishes as @xmath9 at low temperatures .",
    "we note that these power laws are strictly valid only in the absence of two - particle backscattering . in general",
    "they are modified by logarithmic corrections .",
    "the asymptotic behavior is universal in the sense that the exponents depend only on the properties of the bulk system , via @xmath1 , while they do not depend on the impurity strength or shape , except in special cases such as resonant scattering at double barriers , which require fine - tuning of parameters .",
    "the progress in the fabrication of artificial low - dimensional structures stimulated advanced experimental verification of the theoretical predictions.@xcite in an appropriate temperature and energy range luttinger - liquid behavior can be expected in several systems with a predominantly one - dimensional character , such as organic conductors like the bechgaard salts , artificial quantum wires in semiconductor heterostructures or on surface substrates , carbon nanotubes , and fractional quantum hall fluids for chiral luttinger liquids . for a correct interpretation of experimental data",
    "it would be helpful to have theoretical input beyond asymptotic power laws , which are valid only at sufficiently low energy scales .",
    "it is not always clear whether the asymptotic luttinger - liquid behavior is well developed before finite size effects and interactions with the three - dimensional environment become important .",
    "recently , a functional renormalization group ( frg ) method has been developed for a direct treatment of _ microscopic _ models of interacting fermions with impurities in one dimension @xcite which not only captures correctly the universal low - energy behavior , but allows one to compute observables on all energy scales , yielding thus also nonuniversal properties , and in particular an answer to the important question below which scale the asymptotic power laws are actually valid .",
    "the method has been applied to the spinless fermion model with nearest - neighbor interaction on a one - dimensional lattice , supplemented by various types of impurity potentials .",
    "the most relevant observables such as the local density of states,@xcite the density profile,@xcite and the linear conductance @xcite were calculated .",
    "the truncation of the frg hierarchy of flow equations employed in these works is valid only for sufficiently weak interactions .",
    "however , a comparison with exact numerical results from the density matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) @xcite showed that the truncated flow equations are generally rather accurate also for sizable interaction parameters .",
    "the frg captures complex crossover phenomena at intermediate scales , such as the temperature dependence of the conductance through a resonant double barrier.@xcite it can also be applied to other ( than chain ) geometries , such as mesoscopic rings threaded by a magnetic flux @xcite or y junctions.@xcite    in this work we extend the frg method for interacting fermi systems with a single or few impurities to spin-@xmath0 fermions and apply it to the extended one - dimensional hubbard model . for fermions with spin ,",
    "vertex renormalization is crucial to take into account that two - particle backscattering of fermions with opposite spins at opposite fermi points scales to zero in the low - energy limit .",
    "by contrast , for spinless fermions the effects of a single static impurity are captured qualitatively already within the lowest order truncation of the frg hierarchy of flow equations , where the renormalized vertex is approximated by the bare interaction .",
    "two - particle backscattering scales to zero only logarithmically , and thus gives rise to logarithmic corrections to the asymptotic power laws .",
    "the analysis of fixed - point models , which yields the ultimate low - energy behavior , predicts a power - law decay of the local density of states near an impurity or boundary of systems with @xmath10 .",
    "however , a non - selfconsistent hartree - fock and a dmrg study of the density of states near the end of a finite hubbard model chain with open boundary conditions revealed that the power - law suppression at the lowest scales can be preceded by a pronounced increase of spectral weight.@xcite a similar crossover behavior can therefore also be expected for the density of states near an impurity , at least for a sufficiently strong one , as we indeed obtain in this work from the frg . for the conductance",
    ", a renormalization group analysis of the g - ology model by matveev et al.@xcite showed that two - particle backscattering can lead to an increase as a function of decreasing temperature before the asymptotic suppression sets in .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we introduce the microscopic model and derive the corresponding frg flow equations . in sec .",
    "iii we present results for spectral properties of single - particle excitations near an impurity or boundary , the density profile , and transport properties .",
    "we conclude with a summary and an outlook in sec .  iv .",
    "as a microscopic model for the bulk electron system we choose the one - dimensional extended hubbard model with a nearest - neighbor hopping amplitude @xmath11 , a local interaction @xmath12 , and a nearest - neighbor interaction @xmath13 .",

    "for the ( nonextended ) hubbard model the nearest - neighbor interaction vanishes .",
    "a local site impurity on site @xmath21 is modeled by @xmath22 , and a hopping impurity by the nonlocal potential @xmath23 , such that the hopping amplitude @xmath11 is replaced by @xmath24 on the bond linking the sites @xmath21 and @xmath25 . in the following",
    "we will set the bulk hopping amplitude @xmath11 equal to one , that is all energies are expressed in units of @xmath11 .    in the absence of impurities",
    ", the hubbard model can be solved exactly using the bethe - ansatz,@xcite while the extended hubbard model is not integrable .",
    "the hubbard model is a luttinger liquid for arbitrary repulsive interactions at all particle densities except half - filling , where the system becomes a mott insulator.@xcite the phase diagram of the extended hubbard model is more complex .",
    "away from half - filling , it is a luttinger liquid at least for sufficiently weak repulsive interactions.@xcite for the hubbard model the luttinger - liquid parameter @xmath1 can be computed exactly from the bethe ansatz solution.@xcite    for the calculation of transport properties a finite interacting chain ( with sites @xmath26 ) is coupled to noninteracting leads at both ends .",
    "the influence of the leads on the interacting chain can be taken into account by incorporating a dynamical boundary potential @xmath27 in the bare propagator @xmath28 of the interacting chain.@xcite the parameter @xmath29 is the chemical potential , which is related to the density @xmath30 in the leads by @xmath31 with @xmath32 .",
    "uncontrolled conductance drops due to scattering at the contacts between leads and the interacting part of the chain can be avoided by switching off the interaction potential smoothly near the contacts .",
    "in addition , interaction induced bulk shifts of the density have to be compensated by a suitable bulk potential .",
    "@xcite      we now extend the frg scheme derived and used previously for spinless fermi systems with impurities @xcite to electrons , that is spin-@xmath0 fermions .",
    "we make use of equations and procedures described already in detail in the articles ref .   and ref .",
    ", without repeating the derivations here .",
    "we use the one - particle irreducible ( 1pi ) version of the frg .",
    "@xcite the starting point is an exact hierarchy of differential flow equations for the 1pi vertex functions , which is obtained by introducing an infrared cutoff @xmath33 in the free propagator and differentiating the effective action with respect to @xmath33 .",
    "since translation invariance is spoiled by the impurity , we use a matsubara frequency cutoff instead of a cutoff on momenta .",
    "the cutoff is sharp at @xmath34 @xcite and smooth for @xmath35.@xcite the hierarchy is truncated by neglecting the contribution of the three - particle vertex to the flow of the two - particle vertex .",
    "the coupled system of flow equations for the two - particle vertex @xmath36 and the self - energy @xmath37 is then closed .",
    "the contribution of the three - particle vertex to @xmath36 is small as long as @xmath36 is sufficiently small .",
    "we neglect the influence of the impurity on the flow of the two - particle vertex , such that @xmath36 remains translation invariant . while this is sufficient for capturing the effects of isolated impurities in otherwise pure systems , it is known that impurity contributions to vertex renormalization become important in macroscopically disordered systems.@xcite we also neglect the feedback of the bulk self - energy into the flow of @xmath36 , which yields only a very small correction at weak coupling .",
    "the two - particle vertex is parametrized approximately by a renormalized static short - range interaction @xcite in order to reduce the number of variables in the flow , which would be unmanageably large otherwise .",
    "this approximation is exact at the beginning of the flow and fully captures the nonirrelevant parts of the vertex in the low - energy limit .",
    "the self - energy generated by the simplified vertex is then static ( frequency independent ) and its spatial dependence can be treated fully , that is without resorting to another simplified parametrization .",
    "transport properties are computed by coupling the interacting model to noninteracting leads as described in ref .  .",
    "the conductance is obtained directly from the one - particle green function , since current vertex corrections vanish in our approximation for @xmath36 .",
    "we now describe the parametrization of the spatial ( or momentum ) dependences of the two - particle vertex @xmath36 for spin-@xmath0 fermions , employing a natural extension of our previous parametrization for the spinless case.@xcite we consider only spin - rotation invariant lattice systems with local and nearest - neighbor interactions .",
    "this includes the extended hubbard model .",
    "for a spin - rotation invariant system the spin structure of the two - particle vertex can be decomposed into a singlet and a triplet part : @xmath38 with @xmath39 since the total vertex is antisymmetric in the incoming and outgoing particles , the singlet part @xmath40 has to be symmetric and the triplet part @xmath41 antisymmetric .",
