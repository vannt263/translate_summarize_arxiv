    "magnetic phase transitions of stage-2 cocl@xmath0 graphite intercalation compound ( gic ) have been extensively studied.@xcite this compound magnetically behaves like a quasi two - dimensional ( 2d ) xy - like ferromagnet with a very weak antiferromagnetic interplanar interaction .",

    "below @xmath1 the system is in a 3d antiferromagnetic phase with the 2d ferromagnetic layers being stacked antiferromagnetically along the _ c _ axis .",
