    "the original motivation for this work was to gain some understanding of poisson  lie ( pl ) t - duality @xcite , including zero - modes , at quantum level .",
    "let us recall the relevant facts : usual ( i.e. abelian ) t - duality emerges in the presence of an abelian group of symmetry and it is a continuous counterpart of kramers  wannier ( kw ) duality .",
    "its generalization , pl t - duality , comes from an action of a pl group @xmath0 , which is not necessarily a symmetry group , but rather gives rise to a conserved charge ( ` nonabelian momentum ' ) with values in the dual pl group @xmath1 . in the dual model",
    ", the roles of @xmath0 and @xmath1 are interchanged .",
    "there are path integral @xcite and renormalization group @xcite arguments for pl t - duality at quantum level .",
    "however , they are far from being complete and suffer from problems with boundary conditions . in this respect , it would be nice to have a lattice counterpart of pl t - duality  quantum kw duality .",
    "we should expect emergence of quantum groups in quantization of pl t - duality that are deformations of the corresponding pl groups .",
    "it is necessary at least in the case of open strings @xcite .",
    "the usual ( abelian ) kw duality is an immediate consequence of poincar duality between cohomology groups @xmath2 and @xmath3 . here",
    "@xmath4 is a closed oriented surface and @xmath0 , @xmath1 are mutually dual finite abelian groups .",
    "surfaces with boundaries are also admissible , provided one uses appropriate relative cohomologies ( to be specified below )",
    ".    the only problem with quantum kw duality consists in defining a suitable generalization of @xmath2 , if we replace @xmath0 with a general ( i.e. non - commutative and non - cocommutative ) hopf algebra , preserving poincar duality . in this paper , this is accomplished for finite quantum groups ( finite  dimensional hopf @xmath5-algebras ) .",
    "it is easy to define these `` cohomologies '' using a graph on @xmath4 ( via cocycles ) : ordering problems ( coming from non - commutativity and non - cocommutativity ) are absent here , because there is a natural ( cyclic ) ordering on the edges around a face ( or running from a vertex ) .",
    "the real problem is to prove topological invariance of these `` cohomologies '' .",
    "we should understand what they really are .    now i will try to present briefly quantum kw duality ( pointing out the special abelian case ) in the form that seems to be the most convenient .    our basic objects are called neckfaces . these are compact oriented surfaces , possibly with boundary ; on each boundary circle there are some black and some white points , called beads .",
    "the beads are located as on the figure , i.e. between any two black there is a white one and vice versa ; the beads dissect the boundary into pieces called strings .",
    "@xmath6 now suppose we are given a finite quantum group ( a finite - dimensional hopf @xmath5-algebra ) @xmath7",
    ". then we will give a construction that provides a vector space @xmath8 for any neckface @xmath4 ( @xmath8 is a non - zero finite - dimensional hilbert space ) .",
    "it is the promised analogy of the relative cohomology group @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the set of black beads ( more precisely , it is an analogy of the vector space @xmath11 ) .",
    "the correspondence @xmath12 enjoys certain functoriality properties .",
    "we organize neckfaces into a category nefa : morphisms ( glueings ) are maps @xmath13 that may glue pairs of strings of @xmath14 ( white endpoints with white and black with black ) , but up to this they are orientation - preserving homeomorphisms",
    ". the beads of @xmath15 should be the images of the beads of @xmath14 that lie on @xmath16 .",
    "now we can see @xmath17 as a functor from nefa to the category of vector spaces .",
    "the properties of @xmath17 are described in the section 2 ; for now it is enough to know that @xmath18 .    to have an example in mind",
    ", the reader should read the section 3 ( and without inconvenience , she or he may read the exact statements of definitions given in the section 2 ) . the case @xmath19",
    ", @xmath20 will correspond to @xmath0-spin models ( when @xmath7 is the group algebra @xmath21 ) ; if moreover @xmath0 is abelian , this will correspond to the usual kw duality .",
    "the correspondence between @xmath7 and @xmath17 is the following : let @xmath22 be a disk with 2 black and 2 white beads",
    ". then @xmath23 .",
    "the multiplication and comultiplication on @xmath7 are given by two glueings @xmath24 that give us ( by functoriality ) maps @xmath25 ; these are the multiplication and the dual multiplication ( the adjoint of the comultiplication map @xmath26 , up to a positive factor  cf .",
    "the appendix ) : @xmath27 ( in the lower diagram , the upper @xmath22 is the first and the lower @xmath22 the second in @xmath28 ) .",
    "we use the following convention : images of beads are drawn as beads even if they are inside and images of glued string are represented by dotted lines .",
    "look at the @xmath29 example : if @xmath19 , @xmath20 , we clearly obtain what we want : @xmath29-bundle type over @xmath22 is specified by the discontinuity at the white points , which is an arbitrary element @xmath30 .",
    "the first glueing gives @xmath31 and the second @xmath32 ; the former is the multiplication in @xmath33 and the latter in the dual algebra @xmath34 of functions on @xmath0 . in the general case ,",
    "one obtains the famous hopf algebra coming from the triple @xmath29 .",
    "the other operations ( unit , counit , @xmath35 and @xmath36 ) are also given by glueings ; we just mention the antipode @xmath37 that comes from rotation of @xmath22 for 180 degrees ( notice that @xmath38 as it should be for finite quantum groups ) .",
    "there is an important point in the way we recovered the hopf algebra structure on @xmath39 : we had two maps @xmath25 and one of them was claimed to be the multiplication while the other one to be the dual multiplication .",
    "the distinction was made only by the colour of the beads that were mapped inside @xmath22 .",
    "if we made it in the other way , we would obtain another hopf algebra structure ( clearly the dual one ) on the same space .",
    "this identification of @xmath7 with @xmath34 is given by the fourier transform and this is the origin of fourier transforms in kw duality . in our picture , kw duality will simply state that recolouring the beads corresponds to replacing @xmath7 with @xmath34 . in the case of a commutative group @xmath0",
    "we have @xmath40 ( @xmath10 is the set of black beads ) ; what we have said implies that this space is naturally identified with @xmath41 ( @xmath42 is the set of white beads ( that becomes @xmath10 after recolouring ) and @xmath1 the dual group ) .",
    "the identification is given by fourier transform ( the groups @xmath9 and @xmath43 are mutually dual via poincar duality ) .",
    "after this preparation we can describe the ` statistical models ' and their kw duality .",
    "suppose we are given the surface @xmath44 that is simply the disjoint union of @xmath45 copies of @xmath22 and a glueing @xmath46 ; for example @xmath4 may be a square ( or a torus ) with a tiling by squares coming from @xmath47 .",
    "the model is given by specifying a boltzmann weight @xmath48 .",
    "the ` partition sum ' is an element of @xmath8 : it is simply @xmath49 . if it is necessary , we may take its inner product with some @xmath50 to obtain a number ; one may say that @xmath51 specifies the boundary and periodicity conditions .",
    "the correspondence with the usual lattice models is the following : we have the surface @xmath4 tiled by quadrilaterals ( the tiling comes from @xmath47 ) ; every vertex of the tiling has a colour ( given by its proimage in @xmath44 which is a set of beads of the same colour ) .",
    "we can construct two graphs on @xmath4 : draw the diameter connecting the black beads on each @xmath22 in @xmath44 ; their images form a graph @xmath52 .",
    "if we make the same thing with the white beads , we obtain a graph @xmath53 , dual to @xmath54 .",
    "one can go also in the opposite direction , starting with @xmath54 , making @xmath53 and finally arriving at the tiling @xmath47 . in the usual formulation of kw duality , there are @xmath0-valued spins at vertices of @xmath54 interacting through the edges ; the dual model lives on @xmath53 and has @xmath1-valued spins ( where @xmath1 is the dual of the finite abelian group @xmath0 ) . only internal spins are summed over ( external spins form the boundary condition ) and the spins have to be allowed to take values in an arbitrary principal @xmath0-bundle over @xmath4 .",
    "the partition sum depends on these boundary and periodicity conditions . in the picture",
    "described above , we organized these sums to a single element of a vector space .    recall that in our picture kw duality simply states that recolouring corresponds to transition to the dual hopf algebra and that on @xmath22 the recolouring gives fourier transform ( recoloured @xmath22 is after a rotation again @xmath22 ) .",
    "on @xmath44 one has to make fourier for each @xmath22 . @xmath55",
    "there remain several things that should be added :    we presented the functor @xmath17 as coming from a finite quantum group @xmath7 and showed how to reconstruct @xmath7 from @xmath17 .",
    "the functor @xmath17 was motivated as a generalization of cohomology to quantum coefficients .",
    "but our final formulation , given in the section 2 , characterizes @xmath17 by a set of axioms ( not involving hopf algebras ) and then the theorem , encompassing all our results , claims that there is a 1-to-1 ( up to isomorphisms ) correspondence between such functors @xmath17 and finite quantum groups ( in fact it claims a little bit more  that the two categories are equivalent ) .    in the pl t - duality , an important role is played by the drinfeld double of the pl groups .",
    "it should be expected in the kw duality as well ; in fact , in the case of @xmath0-spin models ( with possibly nonabelian @xmath0 ) it was found that the order and disorder operators are organized into the drinfeld double and also that the canonical @xmath56-matrix of the double gives the braid group statistics of such models @xcite .",
    "the same is true generally and becomes self - evident when the double is realized as @xmath8 for certain @xmath4 ( an anulus with one black and one white bead on each boundary circle ) .",
    "this will be done in the section 5 .",
    "finally , we can naturally generalize ` statistical ' models .",
    "they were described by a glueing @xmath46 and a weight in @xmath57 .",
    "of course , it is possible to take an arbitrary glueing @xmath58 and @xmath59 . if @xmath60 is a disjoint union of disks ( but this time with an arbitrary number of beads ) , we obtain duality for many - particle interactions ( this interpretation is for @xmath33 ) .",
    "just imagine ( as we did in the case of @xmath44 ) @xmath4 tiled by polygons with coloured vertices . at each black vertex",
    "there is a @xmath0-valued spin and at each polygon an interaction .",
    "this may be nice in renormalization , which consits just in writing the map @xmath46 as a composition @xmath61 .",

    "it is a map @xmath109 . using @xmath17",
    ", it gives us @xmath110 , i.e. @xmath111 .",
    "it exchanges multiplication with the dual one , @xmath35 with @xmath112 , etc .",
    "so it is nothing else but the trivial map coming from the fact that @xmath113 ( cf .",
    "appendix ) .",
    "now compose this reflection with the reflection with respect to the vertical diameter ( the one giving @xmath36 when mapped by @xmath17 ) .",
    "the result is the mentioned rotation , and when mapped by @xmath17 , it gives us the fourier transform @xmath108 .",
    "let @xmath0 be a finite group and @xmath114 , @xmath115 its subgroups such that every element @xmath30 can be written uniquely as a product @xmath116 , @xmath117 , @xmath118 . by a @xmath29-bundle over a neckface @xmath4 we mean",
    "a principal @xmath0-bundle over @xmath4 with a specified lift of each string to the bundle ; discontinuities at the beads are allowed but at the black beads they have to be from @xmath114 and at the white beads from @xmath115 .",
    "an automorphism of a @xmath29-bundle is an automorphism of the @xmath0-bundle preserving the liftings of the strings .",
    "clearly , nontrivial automorphisms can exist only on the closed components of @xmath4 .",
    "let us fix a triple @xmath29 .",
    "let @xmath119 be the set of all @xmath29-bundle types over @xmath4 .",
    "we put @xmath120 ( the free vector space over @xmath119 ) .",
    "the inner product on @xmath8 is defined as follows : the basis @xmath119 is orthogonal and for @xmath121 , @xmath122    if @xmath13 is a glueing , we define @xmath123 as follows : for @xmath124 we try to extend the glueing @xmath47 to the bundle in such a way that if two strings are glued , we glue their lifts .",
    "if it is possible , the result is @xmath125 ; otherwise @xmath126 .",
    "this functor is an @xmath17-functor , up to one problem : the maps @xmath83 are projecting only after rescaling the inner products .",
    "but if we rescale each @xmath83 by a positive number so as to obtain a projecting map , we obtain a genuine @xmath17-functor .",
    "the strategy of the proof is as follows :    first we define the finite quantum group structure on @xmath23 for any @xmath17 ( this definition should be cosidered as a part of the statement of the theorem ) and verify that it obeys fqg axioms .",
    "then we prove that @xmath17 is specified by the fqg @xmath23 up to isomorphisms .",
    "the point is that any neckface can be glued from several copies of @xmath22 .",
    "representations of some basic glueings by @xmath17 are already present in @xmath7 ( by its definition ) ; this is sufficient to restore @xmath17 .",
    "finally , we have to show that there is an @xmath17 for any @xmath7 .",
    "our original motivation is used here ",
    "@xmath17 is constructed as a generalization of cohomologies to quantum coefficients .    in this proof",
    "we show explicitely only that @xmath101 is a bijection from eta to fqg , up to isomorphisms . in section 4.3",
    "we construct a functor @xmath127 .",
    "the fact that the composition @xmath128 is isomorphic to the identity follows from the proof immediately .",
    "first notice the following figure : @xmath129 it represents a _ nice _",
    "glueing @xmath130 , so we have an _ isomorphism _ @xmath131 . as a consequence , @xmath132 . also notice that @xmath133 is 1-dimensional , because there is an obvious glueing @xmath134 .",
    "now we can define the fqg structure on @xmath39 .",
    "the multiplication and the dual multiplication were already given on the figure at page 2 .",
    "the counit is given by the following picture : @xmath135 it represents two maps @xmath136 ; the bottom object is a sphere and i indicated on @xmath137 the image of @xmath138 ( rather than @xmath139 ) to make clear that the diagram is commutative . according to the independent projection law , the two glueings are represented by the same @xmath140 .",
    "the definition of @xmath141 is similar ( just change the colour of the beads ) .",
    "finally , the involution @xmath142 is given by the reflection with respect to the diameter connecting the white beads of @xmath22 and the antipode @xmath35 by rotating @xmath22 for 180 degrees .",
    "now we have to prove that we really defined a finite quantum group .",
    "the only problem is to show that the comultiplication acts as a homomorphism with respect to the multiplication .",
    "the next picture presents another definition of comultiplication , where this condition becomes evident : @xmath143 it has the form @xmath144 and a nice glueing @xmath145 is indicated to show that @xmath146 .",
    "we claim that the corresponding map @xmath147 is given by @xmath148 . in other words , we have to prove something about the following diagram ( the dashed arrows indicate nice morphisms ) : @xmath149 consider the image of the diagram by the functor @xmath17 .",
    "there are two paths from the leftmost object to the rightmost one ; if we have to go against an arrow , we take the adjoint of the map .",
    "we have to prove that the lower path is just @xmath150 times the upper path .",
    "so , consider the following diagram : @xmath151 it was obtained from the previous one by nice glueings ( the dashed arrows are now contracted to identities ) .",
    "it has the same representation by @xmath17 , so that we have to prove the same thing about the new diagram . and",
    "it follows from the following general fact : @xmath152 on this diagram , two glueings of the form @xmath153 are drawn ( it represents only the relevant parts of general neckfaces ) ; also a nice glueing @xmath154 is indicated .",
    "we claim that having mapped the diagram to @xmath77 by @xmath17 , going from the left to the right is just @xmath150 times the identity .",
    "and the nice glueing @xmath154 makes it clear .",
    "if @xmath4 is a neckface then the space @xmath8 becomes an @xmath7-module for every black bead of @xmath4 and an @xmath34-module for every white bead .",
    "the picture represents the black bead case : @xmath155 now suppose we are given a glueing @xmath58",
    ". these @xmath7 and @xmath34 module structures on @xmath156 will enable us to write down the projector @xmath157 .",
    "the simplest case is the following : @xmath158 here the projector is given obviously by the action of @xmath159 at the black bead ( due to the definition of @xmath160 ) .",
    "the recoloured version is similar .    consider the following neckface ( with a nice glueing @xmath153 indicated ) : @xmath161 in @xmath60 the black bead splits into 3 beads ( 3 is just an example ) ; they are numbered against the orientation of @xmath4 . by the nice glueing",
    "we have @xmath162 . upon this identification ,",
    "the action of @xmath163 at the black bead of @xmath4 is the same as the action of @xmath164 at the 3 black beads of @xmath60 .",
    "this follows immediately from the bottom figure on page 7 .",
    "a similar thing is valid for any number and in the recoloured version .",
    "putting these two facts together , we can say something about the following type of glueing @xmath153 : @xmath165 the projector @xmath157 is simply the action of @xmath166 at the 3 black beads of @xmath60 .",
    "now we can state the general form of the projector @xmath157 . if @xmath45 black beads of @xmath60 are mapped to a single point _ inside _",
    "@xmath4 , we have to act by @xmath167 ( as in the previous figure ) .",
    "we call this operator _ a black projector_. similar _ white projection _ has to be made at each image of white beads inside @xmath4",
    ". these projections are mutually commuting and their composition is the projector @xmath157 .",
    "this can be proved from the fact concerning the previous picture and from the independent projection law .",
    "now we can prove that the finite quantum group structure on @xmath23 determines @xmath17 uniquely .",
    "the point is that any neckface @xmath4 can be glued from several copies of @xmath22 and the @xmath7 and @xmath34 module structure on @xmath39 is given simply by the multiplication and the dual multiplication .",
    "thus we know @xmath8 as a subspace of @xmath168 and we also know @xmath83 for any @xmath13 .",
    "now we know much about reconstructing @xmath17 from its @xmath7 . for any neckface",
    "@xmath14 we take a glueing @xmath169 and we already know the subspace @xmath170 . also , any glueing @xmath171 gives us a glueing @xmath172 ( by composition ) , so we know @xmath92 and also @xmath173 ( in this picture , @xmath174 and @xmath173 is the orthogonal projection ) .",
    "the only thing we miss is the identification of @xmath8 for any two glueings @xmath175 and @xmath176 : we see @xmath8 as a subspace of @xmath57 and also of @xmath177 ; we have to understand how to identify these subspaces , using the finite quantum group @xmath7 only .",
    "clearly , this has to be possible ( in the view of the previous section ) .",
    "now we simply reverse the line of thoughts .",
    "suppose we are given @xmath7 and we want to define a corresponding @xmath17 ( we already know that @xmath17 is unique up to an isomorphism ) .",
    "the method is rather straightforward : for any glueing @xmath178 we define @xmath179 as a subspace of @xmath168 in the way described above  as the common range of the projectors like @xmath167 .",
    "one easily verifies that these projectors are orthogonal and mutually commuting . for any glueing @xmath99 we have @xmath180 .",

    "we choose an orientation of each edge of @xmath186 and @xmath187 in the following way : on each @xmath22 we orientate the horizontal diameter ( connecting the black beads ) from the left to the right and the vertical diameter from the top to the bottom ; the edges of @xmath186 and @xmath187 are their images .",
    "there is a 1-to-1 correspondence between the edges of @xmath186 ( and also @xmath187 ) and the disks among @xmath44 .",
    "we will consider intersection of graphs ( always a black graph with a white graph , but not necesarilly coming from the same glueing @xmath175 ) .",
    "we will always suppose that the two graphs have only finitely many common points , none of them being a vertex , and that the edges intersect transversally .",
    "this can be achieved by a deformation .",
    "an intersection point is _ positive _ or _ negative _ according to the relative orientation of the intersecting edges ; by definition , all the intesections of @xmath186 with @xmath187 are positive .",
    "we will consider intersections of a @xmath54 with graphs in a 1-parametric continuous family @xmath190 , @xmath191 , too . in this case",
    "we admit only finitely many @xmath192 s for which the intersection of @xmath54 and @xmath190 violate the previous condition , always in this way : either an edge of @xmath53 is crossing a vertex of @xmath54 , or a vertex is crossing an edge , or two opposite crossing of edges disappear or appear ; only one such exception is allowed for a fixed @xmath192 :    @xmath193 this situation can be achieved by a small deformation .    before describing the system @xmath185 itself , we describe a similar procedure for a combinatorial definition of @xmath9 .",
    "recall ( section 3 ) that @xmath40 if @xmath33 for a finite abelian group @xmath0 ( @xmath10 is the set of the black beads of @xmath4 ) .",
    "changing the procedure slightly we arrive at a combinatorial definition of @xmath11 using the hopf algebra structure of @xmath21 only .",
    "this is easily generalized to an arbitrary fqg ( just by taking care of ordering problems ) .",
    "this generalization will be our definition of @xmath185 .",
    "one can define @xmath9 combinatorially as cocycles on the graph @xmath186 modulo coboundaries , i.e. modulo action of @xmath0 at the internal vertices of @xmath186 . here",
    "the transfer of cocycles on @xmath194 to @xmath195 can be done in the following way : take the graph @xmath196 ; if @xmath197 is a cocycle on @xmath194 , the corresponding cocycle @xmath198 on @xmath195 asigns to an edge @xmath199 the product @xmath200 . here",
    "the product runs over all the intersections of @xmath199 with the edges of @xmath196 .",
    "if it is the intersection with an edge @xmath201 , we put to the product @xmath202 according the sign of the intersection ( here @xmath203 is the edge dual to @xmath201 , i.e. corresponding to the same @xmath22 in @xmath204 ) .",
    "now we come to a combinatorial definition of @xmath11 .",
    "let @xmath46 be a glueing .",
    "any element of @xmath9 is represented by a cocycle on the graph @xmath186 , i.e. by an element of @xmath205 . of course",
    ", this cocycle is not unique : we can act by an element of @xmath0 at any internal vertex of @xmath186 . but suppose we take @xmath206 instead of @xmath205 . in this space",
    "we can average over the action of @xmath0 ; the averaging is nothing but the black projector .",
    "so we get an element of @xmath207 which is now unique .",
    "it is _ closed _",
    "( i.e. it is a linear combination of cocycles ) and _ coclosed _ ( i.e. @xmath0-invariant at the internal vertices of @xmath186 ) ; therefore we may call it",
    "_ harmonic_. by linearity , each element of @xmath11 is represented by a unique harmonic element of @xmath207 ; in fact , @xmath11 may by identified with the space of harmonic elements of @xmath207 . evidently , closedness is equivalent to invariance with respect to the white projectors , i.e. the space of harmonic elements of @xmath207 is just @xmath179 .",
    "generally , elements of the range of the black ( white ) projectors will be called coclosed ( closed ) .",
    "the procedure given for @xmath208 works for @xmath11 almost without any change : we just have to use comultiplication to make tranformations like @xmath209 linear .",
    "the procedure has to be concluded by the black projectors ( i.e. averaging ) to assure coclosedness .",
    "the details will be given below for a general @xmath7 .",
    "recall the definition of the black projectors .",
    "let @xmath210 be a vertex of @xmath186 and let @xmath211 be the edges incident with @xmath210 , in the cyclical order , given by the orientation of @xmath4 .",
    "some edges may occur twice in this list .",
    "let @xmath212 if all the edges point to @xmath210 , we form the coproduct @xmath213 and multiply each @xmath214 by @xmath215 from the right . if we allow arbitrary orientations of @xmath216 s , we multiply by @xmath217 from the left instead , if @xmath216 is pointing from @xmath210 .",
    "let @xmath218 .",
    "let us replace @xmath160 with @xmath219 in the definition of the black projector .",
    "clearly , @xmath220 is coclosed at @xmath210 iff the result is @xmath221 for any @xmath219 .",
    "a similar fact is of course valid for closedness ( just using @xmath105 instead of @xmath7 ) .",
    "it can be translated to the following formulation , very similar to closedness of a group - valued cochain .",
    "let @xmath115 be an internal face of @xmath186 ( i.e. containing an internal vertex of @xmath187 ) .",
    "let @xmath211 be the edges of @xmath186 forming the boundary @xmath222 of the face @xmath115 , in the order given by the orientation of the face .",
    "we make comultiplication on @xmath223 at the edges among @xmath222 ( it may happen that an edge is twice in @xmath222 ; in that case we make the comultiplication twice ) . for the sake of clarity",
    ", first suppose that all the edges @xmath211 have the orientation compatible with @xmath115 .",
    "in that case , we take the first component of each coproduct and multiply them in the order @xmath224 ; we have something like @xmath225 the condition states that this has to be @xmath226 . if the edges @xmath211 have arbitrary orientation , we also make the comultiplication on each @xmath214 , but if the orientation of @xmath216 is opposite to @xmath115 , we take from the coproduct @xmath227 and put to the product @xmath228 ; again we have to obtain @xmath226 .",
    "if an edge @xmath216 is twice in @xmath222 , we take to the product @xmath229 and @xmath230 ( the orientation of @xmath216 once agrees and once disagrees with @xmath115 ) .",
    "the condition @xmath231 is clearly independent of the choice of @xmath232 .",
    "we use this definition of closedness in what follows ; it simplifies the proof .",
    "now we define the system of unitary isomorphisms @xmath233 .",
    "let @xmath234 .",
    "recall our requirements on the intersection of the graphs @xmath195 and @xmath196 ; if necessary , we deform @xmath196 so that they held .",
    "later we shall prove that @xmath235 is independent of deformations of the graphs .",
    "we define @xmath235 as the composition of several maps .",
    "first , let us define a map @xmath236 ( recall @xmath237 ) .",
    "for any edge @xmath238 we take the points @xmath239 lying on @xmath240 , in the natural order given by the orientation of @xmath240 .",
    "given an element @xmath241 we form the coproduct @xmath242 ( if @xmath243 , we act by the counit on @xmath244 ) ; @xmath245 corresponds to @xmath246 .",
    "now we define a map @xmath247 .",
    "we simply act by the antipode at the negative points of @xmath248 .",
    "the next map is @xmath249 . for any @xmath250 take its points @xmath251 in the natural order . for @xmath252 form @xmath253    the final map @xmath254 ensures coclosedness",
    ": it is just the composition of all the black projectors of @xmath94 .",
    "@xmath235 is equal to the composition @xmath255 times a positive factor @xmath256 ensuring unitarity .",
    "one easily sees that @xmath257 : we only have to check the evident fact that the composition @xmath258 preserves closedness .",
    "the factor @xmath256 is @xmath259 where @xmath260 is the number of vertices of @xmath187 .",
    "first we have to prove that @xmath235 is independent of deformations of the graphs ; this is a straightforward consequence of the useful identity @xmath261 .",
    "next we have to check ( 1 )",
    ". we do it in the case when @xmath94 and @xmath95 are _ close _ to each other ( in the sense specified below ) and then use the fact that any @xmath94 , @xmath95 can be connected by a sequence @xmath262 with close @xmath263 and @xmath264 .",
    "we say that glueings @xmath265 are close to each other if the graphs @xmath266 differ just by removing an edge separating two different faces or by contracting an edge connecting two different vertices . for close @xmath267",
    "the equation ( 1 ) is straightforward ; we just have to draw the graphs ( in the case of contraction ) so that the contracted graph follows closely the original one , as indicated on the figure :    @xmath268    similarly , to prove that @xmath235 is unitary , we may suppose @xmath269 are close to each other .",
    "we already know @xmath270 checking that @xmath235 is the adjoint of @xmath271 is straightforward .",
    "only few things remain now .",
    "condition ( 2 ) holds evidently .",
    "we have to prove @xmath81 .",
    "let @xmath46 be a glueing and let @xmath272 be the reflection with respect to the vertical diameter .",
    "let @xmath273 be the composition @xmath274 .",
    "the map @xmath275 sends @xmath179 onto @xmath276 .",
    "it is easy to check that it gives us a well - defined and functorial identification of @xmath8 with @xmath277 .",
    "finally , we have to check that the quantum group coming from @xmath17 is indeed @xmath7 .",
    "it is an easy exercise .",
    "recall ( the figure at the top of page 9 ) that @xmath8 is a @xmath7-module for each black bead and a @xmath105-module for each white bead of @xmath4 .",
    "these @xmath7 and @xmath34 actions obviously commute with each other with the exception of neighbouring beads , when the actions form weyl algebra ( cf .",
    "if we take a boundary circle of @xmath4 , all actions combine together to an action of an associative algebra , which is @xmath17 of the following figure ( multiplication is given by glueing the internal circle with the external circle of another copy of the neckface on the figure ; the action on @xmath8 is given by glueing the internal circle with the circle on @xmath4 ) : @xmath278    when the boundary circle contains just one black and one white bead , we will call it a _ dyonic hole_. in this case the @xmath7 action and the @xmath34 action combine to an action of the drinfeld double @xmath279 , i.e. to @xmath280 , where @xmath281 ( together with nice glueing @xmath282 giving rise to @xmath283 ) is @xmath284 thus @xmath8 becomes a @xmath279-module for every dyonic hole . @xmath7 and",
    "@xmath34 actions on @xmath8 correspond to order and disorder operators and at dyonic holes they form drinfeld doubles .    of course ,",
    "the drinfeld double is not just an associative algebra , but a quasitriangular fqg ; this will lead us to a braid group statistics of the dyonic holes , given by the @xmath56-matrix of @xmath279 .",
    "the comultiplication in @xmath279 is drawn in the left part of the following picture : @xmath285 it presents a neckface @xmath4 together with a nice glueing @xmath286 , giving @xmath287 .",
    "if @xmath279 acts on the external circle of @xmath4 , we have a map @xmath288 , i.e. @xmath289 . as in the case of the comultiplication on @xmath7 , it is given by @xmath148 .",
    "the right half of the picture presents another glueing @xmath290 ; it can be obtained by a map @xmath291 exchanging the interal circles .",
    "this exchange correspods to the opposite comultiplication on @xmath279 ; if we have the element of @xmath8 which is @xmath292 in the left decomposition of @xmath4 , it becomes the @xmath56-matrix @xmath293 in the right .",
    "this exchange of two dyonic holes is the basic element from which the braid group statistics of such holes is built up .",
    "it even proves that @xmath279 is quasitriangular .",
    "recall that our original aim was to find a lattice quantization of pl t - duality . clearly , it is still an open problem .",
    "the point is that we have to admitt hopf algebras that come from quantization of pl groups .",
    "finite dimension is ( at least technically ) good , so @xmath7 should be a ( restriced ) quantum group at a root of 1 .",
    "the most important difference is that now @xmath294 , as if turning @xmath22 for 360 degrees did not give the identity .",
    "the way out should be achieved by extending the category nefa .",
    "the functor @xmath17 is closely related to q - invariants of 3-folds computed from the drinfeld double .",
    "in fact , @xmath8 s ( for closed @xmath4 s ) are the state spaces of a tft giving rise to these invariants @xcite .",
    "it would be nice if it had topological applications for open @xmath4 s , too .",
    "it seems reasonable that for @xmath4 s with dyonic holes only , it is connected with ribbon tangles invariants .",
    "there are good reasons to expect that the hypotetical vector spaces @xmath8 for the case of a root of 1 are closely related to the state spaces of chern - simons theory , because 1 . in pl t - duality",
    ", wznw action in the double gives the symplectic structure on the phase space , and 2 . in the finite quantum group case ,",
    "the functor @xmath17 is closely related to invariants of 3-folds computed from the double @xmath295 .",
    "perhaps a part of the extension of nefa should consist in requiring neckfaces to carry a complex structure .",
    "the aim of this appendix is to fix the notation and to describe non - standard definitions used in the text .",
    "we do not give standard definitions here ( see e.g. @xcite ) .    a _ finite quantum group _ ( fqg )",
    "@xmath7 is a finite - dimensional hopf @xmath5-algebra .",

    "the counit @xmath299 is clearly projecting , i.e. it is given by the inner product with an @xmath159 , @xmath300 ( usually , there is no confusion between these two @xmath160 s , except for the definition of morphisms in the category @xmath296 ; we make a warning there ) .",
    "the dual counit @xmath301 is given by the inner product with a positive multiple @xmath141 of @xmath302 such that @xmath301 is projecting ( or @xmath303 ) , i.e. @xmath304 . because @xmath305 , we have @xmath306 .    the element @xmath159 satisfies the identity @xmath307 for any @xmath163 ; as a consequence , @xmath308 ( both sides are equal to @xmath309 ) .",
