    "during evaporation and condensation heat and mass are transported through the interface .",
    "the common description of these phenomena uses assumptions which are questionable .",
    "for instance , one usually assumes equilibrium conditions at the interface @xcite .",
    "furthermore one neglects coupling effects between heat and mass transfer @xcite .",
    "the first one is a zeroth order approximation in deviations from equilibrium and it is desirable to extend it to a more accurate theory .",
    "this is , for instance , done in the monograph by kjelstrup and bedeaux @xcite . neglecting coupling coefficients",
    "was shown to violate the second law of thermodynamics for a one - component system @xcite .",
    "coupling is important since the corresponding resistances for transport across the surface depend on the enthalpy of vaporization .",
    "the significance of this quantity in this context is due to the large difference between the liquid and the vapor values of the enthalpy . neglecting the coupling coefficients",
    "has been shown to imply that the enthalpy of vaporization is zero @xcite , which is clearly incorrect .",
    "the situation becomes even more complicated when one considers evaporation in mixtures .",
    "these processes happen in such industrial applications as distillation and therefore the precise description is important .",
    "depending on conditions one can get mass fluxes of components in the same direction or in the direction opposite to the corresponding thermodynamic forces .",
    "there has been done a number of studies of the interfacial transport for one- and two - component systems : experiments @xcite , molecular dynamic simulations @xcite , kinetic theory @xcite and square gradient continuous description @xcite .",
    "all these works use different approaches , which allows one to investigate different aspects .",
    "most studies were for one - component systems .",
    "it was verified that non - equilibrium thermodynamics could be used to describe the data by fang and ward @xcite , see also @xcite .",
    "the description of transport through surfaces , using non - equilibrium thermodynamics @xcite , gives a unifying treatment also for the results of the molecular dynamics simulations , kinetic theory and the square gradient theory , both for single component systems and mixtures .",
    "an alternative approach to interpret the data is the statistical rate theory @xcite .",
    "see for a critical discussion of the description of evaporation and condensation the paper by bond and struchtrup @xcite .",
    "the results of the molecular dynamics analysis as well as from the square gradient theory give continuous stationary state profiles of , for instance , the temperature and the densities through the surface .",
    "both descriptions @xcite conclude that the surface is in local equilibrium .",
    "this shows that the surface as described by the excess densities introduced by gibbs @xcite is a separate thermodynamic system .",
    "this makes the systematic description of the surface using non - equilibrium thermodynamics given in @xcite possible .",
    "one of the points of interest is the dependence of the resulting overall interfacial resistances on the continuous profiles .",
    "once we have a description which relates the total resistances of the gibbs surface to the continuous profiles of , in particular , the local resistivities and the enthalpy profiles , we can study which aspects of the continuous description are most important ..    it is the aim of this paper to obtain the general discrete approach to describe transport properties through and along the surface on the basis of the continuous description . as the interfacial region is thin ,",
    "it is natural to consider the whole region as a single entity . in equilibrium ,",
    "the common method to do this is to introduce the properties of the gibbs surface as excess densities .",
    "away from equililibrium the surface should be described in terms of excess densities and fluxes . to obtain these one",
    "needs the actual profiles of the thermodynamic densities and fluxes as well as the profiles extrapolated from the homogeneous regions .",
    "within such a description , an equilibrium surface may be considered as an autonomous phase @xcite .",
    "given the validity of local equilibrium it is possible to speak about the gibbs surface also in non - equilibrium states , as was mentioned above .",
    "in this paper we will establish the link between the non - equilibrium continuous description and the transport properties of the whole surface both through and along the surface directly .",
    "crucial in the analysis is that the surface thickness is very small compared to length scales over which variables change in the homogeneous phases and along the surface . for fluids",
    "this leads to 2-dimensional isotropy of the surface discussed in @xcite .",
    "we study the transport through the surface in curvilinear coordinates .",
    "this allows us to consider both transport through planar interfaces and a phenomenon like nucleation .",
    "the curvature of the surface plays an important role in nucleation .",
    "the agreement of the classical theory @xcite with experiments is in some cases rather poor @xcite .",
    "the work in this paper will make it possible to analyze effects due to curvature on the overall resistances for transport of heat and mass through the surface of the nucleus in more detail .",
    "one of the issues this paper focuses on is the overall resistances of the surface to heat and mass transfer through the surface .",
    "the thermodynamic forces , which lead to heat and mass transfer through the surface , are given by the differences between the values of the inverse temperature and chemical potentials divided by the temperature in gas and liquid phase .",
    "it is known that there are jumps of these quantities across the surface @xcite .",
    "these jumps are given in terms of the total heat and mass fluxes using these overall resistances .",
    "we refer to a monograph by kjelstrup et al .",
    "@xcite for a systematic derivation of these linear relations in the context of non - equilibrium thermodynamics of surfaces .",
    "the other issue studied in this paper is the excess conductances along the surface .",
    "also for these conductances integral relations are derived , expressing them in the behavior of the continuous conductivities in the interfacial region .",
    "the analysis in this paper will only consider stationary states .",
    "the resulting overall resistances and conductances can also be used to analyze non - stationary behavior .",
    "we will neglect viscous contributions to the pressure tensor .    from the calculation of the overall surface resistances we are able to understand the aspects in the continuous description which are most important for the size of the overall resistances .",
    "these are found to be the nature of the local resistivity profiles and the enthalpy profiles across the surface .",
    "both can be obtained from the particular continuous description used . from molecular dynamics simulations",
    "there is evidence that local resistivities have a peak @xcite in the interfacial region . within the context of the square gradient model",
    "studied in @xcite this peak was modeled by a square gradient contribution .",
    "such a peak clearly contributes significantly to excess resistances .",
    "the enthalpy is important because the value of the enthalpy is significantly different in gas and liquid phase .",
    "the overall resistances are found to contain integrals over products of the local resistivity profiles and the enthalpy profiles .",
    "the location and the nature of the changeover from a large positive enthalpy in the vapor to a large negative enthalpy in the liquid relative to the change over and the peak in the local resistivities is important for the size and the sign of the overall resistances .",
    "the overall conductances are found to contain the excesses of the conductivities for the continuous description .    in",
    "we give a short discussion of the continuous description of the interface using non - equilibrium thermodynamics .",
    "we use the gibbs relation valid for mixtures in the interfacial region found in the context of the square gradient theory , discussed in @xcite , which we believe to be general .",
    "this enables us to obtain the rate of entropy production everywhere in the interfacial region . in",
    "we define the excess densities needed to describe the non - equilibrium gibbs surface .",
    "furthermore , we show how the small thickness of the interfacial region allows us to split all phenomena in separate contributions parallel and perpendicular to the surface in . in",
    "we derive integral relations for the overall interfacial resistances in terms of the local resistivities and the equilibrium enthalpy profiles . in",
    "we derive the integral relations for the overall interfacial conductances .",
    "we further derive the corresponding relations for the coefficients for the measurable heat fluxes in .",
    "this is done in two steps , for normal resistances in and for parallel conductances in . in",
    "we discuss the consequences of the derived relations .",
    "in particular we discuss the influence of the surface geometry and the enthalpy profile across the interfacial region .",
    "finally , in we give concluding remarks .",
    "consider a two phase @xmath0-component mixture .",
    "let @xmath1 be the temperature and @xmath2 be a scalar pressure .",
    "let @xmath3 be the partial enthalpy of the @xmath4-th component , @xmath5 be the chemical potential and @xmath6 be the chemical potential difference of the @xmath4-th component with the @xmath0-th component .",
    "furthermore , let @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 be the mass specific enthalpy , internal energy , entropy and volume respectively , @xmath11 be the overall mass density and @xmath12 be the mass fraction of the @xmath4-th component .",
    "all these fields depend on the position @xmath13  and the time @xmath14 . for a planar interface",
    "@xmath15 is equal to the parallel pressure @xmath16 .",
    "the interfacial region is known to have a large density variation over a distance of the order of a nanometer .",
    "this was the reason for van der waals @xcite to assume , that , for instance , the helmholtz energy density of the surface depends not only on the local properties , but also on their gradients . due to this dependence the surface tension is unequal to zero .",
    "for a two - phase system it becomes an additional thermodynamic characteristics and has to be accounted in the description of the surface . in the continuous description",
    "the role of the surface tension is played by the tension tensor @xmath17 . for a planar surface in equilibrium the only nonzero element of this tension tensor",
    "is the @xmath18 element along the diagonal which equals @xmath19 .",
    "the integral of this difference over the @xmath20-coordinate normal to the surface gives the surface tension of the planar surface .",
    "for a curved surface the tension tensor is no longer diagonal . for a fluid - fluid interface",
    "it remains symmetric , however .",
    "for the relation with the surface tension in that case we refer to @xcite .",
    "a systematic non - equilibrium thermodynamic description requires the gibbs relation expressing the rate of change of the entropy density in those of the other thermodynamic quantities . in @xcite",
    "we used the following form of the gibbs relation @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the barycentric velocity , and @xmath23 is the substantial time derivative .",
    "furthermore we use the summation convention over double greek indices .",
    "compared to the form of the gibbs relation used in the homogeneous regions @xcite , it has an additional contribution proportional to the divergence of the tension tensor @xmath24 .",
    "this contribution is only nonzero in the interfacial region .",
    "the use of it emphasizes the difference between the surface and the homogeneous regions .",
    "the above expression is equivalent to the one given in @xcite  for the one - component two phase fluid . in @xcite",
    "we motivate the choice of the new term in the interfacial region .",
    "this motivation is not a derivation , however , and the validity of the above gibbs relation is therefore postulated .",
    "the justification of the specific choice of the gibbs relation is on the one hand a comparison with experiments and on the other hand the thermodynamic consistency of the results .",
    "such a consistancy was found to be lacking for other choices .",
    "the next step in the thermodynamic description is to give the relation between the thermodynamic potentials . in a bulk region",
    "they are known to be homogeneous functions of the first order .",
    "it is not obvious that this property remains valid inside the interfacial region .",
    "it follows however from that the internal energy density has to be a homogeneous function of the first order of the entropy density , volume and mass densities .",
    "indeed , all the terms in but the last one have the common form . the last term is proportional to the gradient of the tension tensor , which is not an extensive quantity , however , so it does not contribute to the internal energy .",
    "we therefore may write the following relation both for the homogeneous as well for the interfacial regions @xmath25 we emphasize the role of the interfacial region here . while the thermodynamic potentials are related via the standard thermodynamic relations , the gibbs relation in the interfacial region is different from the bulk gibbs relation .",
    "important is that the standard thermodynamic relations contain @xmath15 , which is equal to the parallel pressure for a planar interface and which is very different in the interfacial region from the asymptotic values away from the surface .",
    "substituting into we obtain @xmath26 this is the gibbs - duhem equation for a two - phase multi - component mixture .",
    "note that since @xmath6 and @xmath27 we have @xmath28 which is the usual contribution to the gibbs - duhem equation associated with the chemical potentials . to simplify the notation",
    "we will not usually indicate the @xmath29 dependence .    for a stationary state the derivative @xmath30 gives zero and takes the following form @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the thermodynamic pressure tensor .",
    "the equation of motion for a stationary state takes the following form : @xmath33 where @xmath34  is the gravitational potential .",
    "contracting this equation with @xmath35  and dividing by @xmath36  the result may be written as : @xmath37 using it together with we get @xmath38 which is the gibbs - duhem equation valid both in the homogeneous regions as well as in the interfacial region in a stationary state . here",
    "@xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "note , that @xmath41 , where @xmath42 is the partial entropy .",
    "the entropy balance equation is @xmath43 with the entropy flux @xmath44 and the entropy production @xmath45 .",
    "given the gibbs relation it is shown in @xcite that the entropy flux and the entropy production are given by the following expressions    [ eq / entropy / balance/02 ] @xmath46 @xmath47    where @xmath48 and @xmath49 are the heat and diffusion fluxes @xmath50 the diffusive mass fluxes satisfy the relation @xmath51 . in turn , the energy flux @xmath52 and the mass fluxes @xmath53 and @xmath54 are convenient quantities since in stationary states @xmath55 furthermore , it follows from that in a stationary state @xmath56 using the gibbs - duhem equation and the conservation laws , under stationary state conditions , it is possible to show that @xmath57 the fluid - fluid interface has a two - dimensional isotropy . a detailed discussion of what this means in a continuous 3-dimensional description is given in @xcite .",
    "the essential element in this discussion is the fact that the interfacial region is thin compared to the radius of curvature , @xmath58 .",
    "this implies that the 3-dimensional vectorial fluxes and forces in the entropy production split up into 2-dimensional vectorial components parallel to the surface and scalar components normal to the surface .",
    "we may therefore write @xmath59 where the parallel and normal contributions are @xmath60 two - dimensional isotropy now implies that the parallel and the normal forces and fluxes do not couple and the force - flux relations for parallel and perpendicular contribution are independent . as we will see below , it is convenient to write these relations in terms of conductivities for parallel contributions and in terms of resistivities for perpendicular contributions .",
    "we therefore have the following force - flux relations in the parallel direction @xmath61 and in the normal direction @xmath62 the 2-dimensional isotropy implies that transport coefficients for both contributions ( conductivities for parallel contribution as well as resistivities for normal contribution ) are scalar .",
    "the off - diagonal coefficients of both sets of force - flux equations satisfy the onsager reciprocal relations . inside the interfacial region",
    "the normal resistivities are different from the corresponding parallel resistivities .",
    "away from the interfacial region the fluid has a 3-dimensional isotropy and the corresponding resistivities ( or conductivities ) for the parallel and the normal direction become equal . in order to be consistent with the sign conventions used in the monograph by kjelstrup et al .",
    "@xcite we changed the sign convention we used in @xcite . for this purpose",
    "we changed the sign of the chemical forces which results in a change of the sign of the cross coefficients between the energy flux and the mass fluxes .",
    "we emphasize the reader s attention on the following difference in the convention .",
    "it is common to give the constitutive force - flux relations for @xmath0-component fluid in terms of @xmath0 independent fluxes , e.g. the heat flux @xmath48 and @xmath63 diffusive fluxes @xmath49 .",
    "those fluxes are linearly independent and the corresponding matrix of transport coefficients ( resistivities or conductivities ) is non - singular .",
    "if one uses @xmath64 fluxes or forces as variables , the corresponding matrix of the transport coefficients has @xmath64 rows and columns and is therefore singular .",
    "this makes it impossible to convert resistivities into conductivities that easily , so the corresponding representation should be fixed .",
    "the use of particular representation ( resistivities or conductivities ) is dictated by the surface symmetry and will be apparent later .",
    "the singularity of the matrix of transport coefficients does not however restrict us much .",
    "for instance , there is one - to - one correspondence between the coefficients of @xmath0-squared matrix and @xmath64-squared matrix ( see e.g. ) .",
    "furthermore , the singularity of the transport coefficients matrix does not affect the onsager reciprocal relations , cf .",
    "* ch.vi ,  3 ) .",
    "we can therefore operate these coefficients normally , unless we want to invert the matrix .",
    "the gibbs surface is described with the help of excesses of different quantities in the interfacial region . in equilibrium",
    "only excesses of the densities are used in the description .",
    "non - equilibrium involves many other quantities which vary through the interfacial region and which therefore require a proper definition of the corresponding excess quantity . in this section",
    "we will define the _ excess densities _ in non - equilibrium . in the following sections the definition of the _ excess resistance _",
    ", the _ excess conductance _ , and the _ excess fluxes _ will be given .",
    "because of the variety in nature of the quantities we want take the excess of , we shall use the unified notation for the excess .",
    "namely , we will use @xmath65 $ ] to denote the excess of a profile @xmath66 , where the subscript @xmath67 indicates the nature of the the quantity @xmath68 .",
    "for example , @xmath69 will indicate the excess of a density and @xmath70 will indicate the excess of a flux .",
    "even though both @xmath69 and @xmath70 represent the property of the gibbs surface , they are defined differently .",
    "the definition of an excess requires the normal direction @xmath71 to be defined in the interfacial region .",
    "the surface may be curved and we may introduce curvilinear orthogonal coordinates @xmath72 with @xmath73 being the normal coordinate and @xmath74 being the tangential coordinates . for the stationary states",
    "these coordinates are independent of the time .",
    "let @xmath75 be a variable defined in the interfacial and the homogeneous regions .",
    "furthermore , for any variable @xmath75 , let @xmath76 , where superscript @xmath77 stands either for @xmath78 or for @xmath79 , be the variable @xmath75 extrapolated from the bulk to the surface region .",
    "the extrapolation is done using the description in homogeneous phases . outside of the interfacial region @xmath76 and @xmath75 are almost identical but inside the surface @xmath80 in general differs from @xmath81 .",
    "in order to make this comparison more precise , let @xmath82 and @xmath83 be the boundaries of the interfacial region at the gas and liquid side respectively .",
    "these boundaries are chosen such that the extrapolated value @xmath76  differs some small fraction ( like for instance 0.1 promille or 0.01 promille ) from the actual value @xmath75 along these boundaries .",
    "given the small size of this difference we can use the following identity for the extrapolated variables @xmath84 the location of the boundaries of the interfacial region depend on the variable @xmath75  and the accuracy used . for a sensible choice of the variable and the accuracy , all choices are equivalent .",
    "in contrast to equilibrium , in non - equilibrium description all the bulk variables vary in space and so do the extrapolated quantities . this is true both for densities , like the density @xmath36 , which vary only slightly in the bulk phases , and for intensive quantities , like the temperature , which may vary significantly even in the bulk phases .",
    "if one extrapolates any function @xmath85 of a number of variables the result equals the original function of the extrapolated variables : @xmath86 this is a consequence of the fact that the equality is obvious away from the surface .",
    "for instance , @xmath87 .",
    "we note however , that even though we introduce the extrapolated variables in such a way that and are true , the use of any numerical procedure to obtain the extrapolated variables will introduce small errors .",
    "this is true in particular for non - equilibrium when the extrapolated variables are not constant .",
    "this is however a technical question , not a fundamental one .",
    "usually the extrapolation involves polynomials in order to fit an actual curve , which introduces a non - zero error in the extrapolated curve .    on the basis of",
    "some criterium one chooses a dividing surface in the interfacial region .",
    "the location along the @xmath88  coordinate is denoted by @xmath89 .",
    "this location is usually , though not necessarily , between @xmath82 and @xmath83",
    ". we will discuss below which criteria are used for this choice .",
    "if @xmath90 is a density per unit of volume in the 3-dimensional space , we can define its excess @xmath91 as @xcite @xmath92 where @xmath93 furthermore , @xmath94 are lame coefficients for the curvilinear coordinates and @xmath95 for @xmath96 are lame coefficients for the curvilinear coordinates along the dividing surface .",
    "given that @xmath97 is a density per unit of volume , the excess @xmath98 is a density per unit of surface .",
    "the excess depends on the position of the dividing surface @xmath99 . for ease of notation we will not further indicate the dependence of @xmath100 , @xmath101 and @xmath102 on @xmath103 explicitly .",
    "the key quantity in the non - equilibrium description is the entropy production . as for any density",
    ", one can introduce the excess entropy production for the gibbs surface .",
    "it will determine the dissipation rate of the whole surface .",
    "consider the entropy production given in .",
    "all the terms have the form @xmath104 , where @xmath105 is a flux and @xmath106 is some scalar function . according to @xmath107 in the stationary states , so @xmath108 .",
    "we show in that this leads to @xmath109 where all the functions on the right hand side are evaluated at @xmath110 .",
    "we see , that the excess entropy production of the gibbs surface in the stationary states can be split into two contributions : the one takes into account only perturbations perpendicular to the surface , the other depends only on the perturbations parallel to the surface : @xmath111 we note , that such a separation does not require the surface to be two - dimensionally isotropic .",
    "substantial simplification in the expression for the excess entropy production can be made if one consider typical conditions , when the interfacial region is thin . as was discussed in @xcite , the interfacial region breaks the 3-dimensional isotropy of the system .",
    "in addition to a typical macroscopic size of the problem @xmath112 , there exists the microscopic size @xmath113 , the surface width , which is of the order of few nanometers .",
    "first , we shall make a note on the definition of the excess density . for",
    "a thin surface the lame coefficients @xmath114 do not vary much along @xmath115 coordinate . to a relative order",
    "@xmath116 they are equal to @xmath117 : @xmath118 substituting this expansion into , we get @xmath119 where @xmath120    for each flux in we can write @xmath121 .",
    "this gives an approximate relation for the order of magnitude @xmath122 where @xmath123 and @xmath124 denote a typical change in the corresponding direction .",
    "there are quantities which change drastically over the distances of the order @xmath125 in the direction perpendicular to the surface , so @xmath126 .",
    "however , a significant change of any quantity along the surface may happen only on a length scale @xmath112 , which is of the order of either the radii of curvature or the system size , so @xmath127 .",
    "because of this property of a surface , we may not expect that @xmath128 , i.e. that the change of the parallel component of a flux on a macroscopic scale along the surface is much larger then the change of the perpendicular component of that flux on a microscopic scale through the surface . for the fluxes for which changes @xmath129 and @xmath130 are of the same order of magnitude @xmath131 , takes the form @xmath132 , which can hold only if @xmath133 , since @xmath113 .",
    "this means that both @xmath134 and @xmath135 . if @xmath136 this statement becomes even stronger .",
    "we then may require that for a thin surface    [ eq / excess / surface/05 ] @xmath137 @xmath138    thus , for a surface with a thickness much smaller than the radii of curvature , the stationary state condition @xmath139 has the form of in an interfacial region",
    ".    the extrapolated fluxes @xmath140 satisfy the same equations    [ eq / excess / surface/07 ] @xmath141 @xmath142    since the extrapolated flux fields also satisfy @xmath143 .",
    "consider now and . both of them are first order ordinary differential equations ,",
    "the solutions of which contains additive constants",
    ". these constants must be the same , since according to @xmath144 at the boundary points .",
    "it follows that @xmath145 and @xmath146 are the same functions : @xmath147 note that does not lead to the relation @xmath148 .",
    "is the relation between values of different functions at the same point but not the relation between values of the same function at different points .",
    "however , it follows from that in curvilinear coordinates @xmath149 and therefore @xmath150 but not @xmath151 .",
    "consider now and .",
    "it follows that @xmath152 applying both and to we get @xmath153 applying to each term in for the entropy production we obtain the general form of the excess entropy production for a surface in stationary state @xmath154 we see , that for a thin surface , the excess entropy production splits into independent contributions which are caused by forces perpendicular and parallel to the surface .",
    "this property has the same origin as the 2-dimensional isotropy of the surface @xcite .",
    "it is desired to have the excess entropy production in the form @xmath155 , i.e. as a sum of independent contributions , each of which can is a product of a flux and a force . however , as one can see from the parallel contributions do not have such a form .",
    "further information about the symmetry of a system is required .",
    "we will therefore consider the cases when the forces are applied perpendicular to the surface and parallel to the surface separately .",
    "consider forces applied only in the direction perpendicular to the surface .",
    "then @xmath156 and the local entropy production @xmath157 which is given by .",

    "the analogous meaning have @xmath161 and @xmath162 .",
    "following the traditional procedure in non - equilibrium thermodynamics , we write the force - flux relations based on the form of the excess entropy production as : @xmath163 we now compare with . for the force - flux relations",

    "we therefore conclude that @xmath174 this is the general form of the resistivity integral relation for the transport normal to the surface .",

    "we now make use of the fact that the surface is thin .",
    "for such a case we expand the lame coefficients @xmath175 around @xmath100 and obtain @xmath176 so that to a relative order @xmath177 the excess resistance @xmath178 is given by @xmath179 .",

    "gives integral relations for the resistivity coefficients for the case that one uses the total energy flux to describe the transport through the surface .",
    "they show that resistivities normal to the surface are additive , as one would expect .",

    "the corresponding force - flux relation are given by .",
    "the excess entropy production given by simplifies to the following @xmath183 this form of the excess entropy production does not allow us to write the constitutive force flux relations yet .",
    "however , the fact that there are no perturbations in the direction perpendicular to the surface , allows us to simplify this expression further .",

    "@xmath186 is independent of @xmath115 .",

    "here we note that for the special case of stationary states the surface is not moving in the normal direction .    for a thin surface one can expand the lame coefficients around @xmath100 and obtain to a relative order @xmath116 that @xmath194 where operator @xmath167 for a flux @xmath195 is still given by .",

    "a curved surface differences of the relative order of the distance between the dividing surfaces divided by the curvature @xmath201 may appear .",
    "the quantity @xmath106 considered above can be written as a function of the temperature and the chemical potentials alone .",
    "we can therefore evaluate this quantity at the temperature @xmath199 and the chemical potentials @xmath200 of the surface .",

    "as we have discussed , the variation of @xmath186 along the surface is the same as the variation of @xmath187 along the surface .",

    "for a conductivity profile @xmath215 it is defined as a matrix @xmath216 next we would like to compare with in order to relate the interfacial conductance @xmath217 to the excess conductance @xmath218 .",
    "this however is not possible directly , since in general the former one is a scalar while the latter one is a matrix .",

    "we may conclude that @xmath223 represents integral relations for the conductivity coefficients for the case that one uses the total energy flux to describe the transport along the surface .",
    "they show that conductivities parallel to the surface are additive , as one would expect .",
    "it is convenient to write the local entropy production also in terms of the measurable heat flux @xmath224 , which is defined as @xmath225 in terms of measurable heat fluxes the expression for the entropy production becomes @xmath226 where @xmath227 . , and , which give the entropy production in stationary states , are equivalent expressions . to second order in the deviation from equilibrium one may , and we will , use the equilibrium values of @xmath228 in .",
    "the resulting expression for the entropy production is then only equivalent to the other two to this order .    as in",
    "we can split the local entropy production into parallel and perpendicular contributions based on the two - dimensional isotropy of the interfacial region , see , so that @xmath229 this leads to the following force - flux relations in the parallel direction @xmath230 and in the normal direction @xmath231 further on , for the transport through the surface we will use only resistivities and for the transport along the surface we will use only conductivities .",
    "we have therefore omitted subscripts @xmath232 and @xmath233 for corresponding transport coefficients to simplify the notation .",

    "in contrast to the transport perpendicular to the surface , in the case of the transport parallel to the surface we are not interested in the extrapolated quantities .",
    "the reason for this is , as was mentioned above , that the surface is a separate entity and the transport along the surface can not be determined by the properties of adjacent phases .",

    "the similar arguments are valid for the interfacial conductances and conductivities .    consider integral relations for the measurable resistances , or .",
    "each component of the resistance matrix @xmath278 contains the excess of the local resistivity profiles coupled to the enthalpy profiles .",
    "since all the terms on the right hand side of these equations are evaluated at equilibrium , the resistances depend linearly on the position of the dividing surface .",
    "the first term in the expression for every resistance is the excess of only the corresponding resistivity profile . as we discussed in @xcite",
    ", each resistivity profile contains a peak due to the interfacial contribution @xcite .",
    "it is the size of this peak which controls the magnitude of the first term and makes it positive .",
    "this contribution is the only contribution to the interfacial resistance @xmath279 to heat flow . in this sense ,",

    "contrary , the interfacial conductance of the droplet does not depend on its size at all .",
    "as the spherical droplet has a two - dimensional isotropy , it is also follows that the excess conductance is still a scalar for a droplet of an arbitrary size .",
    "in this paper we have build a general approach for the description of the transport phenomena in the interfacial region .",
    "we have shown how the continuous description can be linked to the excess properties of the surface .",
    "this makes it possible to consider the surface as an autonomous phase not only in equilibrium but also in non - equilibrium .",
    "we have derived integral relations for the interfacial resistances for the transport perpendicular to the surface an the interfacial conductances for the transport parallel to the surface .",
    "they are the coefficients in the linear force - flux relations for the heat and mass transfer across and along the interface .",
    "the analysis was done for curved surfaces which allows us to address different applications where the evaporation and condensation happens . in particular",

    "we can distinguish the local resistivity / conductivity profiles , the enthalpy of vaporization and the curvature of the surface .",
    "the excess of the local resistivity to transport normal to the surface gives the resistance of the whole surface .",
    "this is similar to the resistance of a finite bulk layer , which may be thought as a series of resistors .",
    "similarly , the excess of the local conductivity for transport along the surface gives the conductance of the whole surface .",
    "this is also similar to the conductance of a finite bulk layer , which may be thought of a set of parallel conductors .",
    "if there is a peak in the local profile , it immediately affects the resistance of the conductance of the whole surface .",
    "it is therefore crucial to have the information about the whole profile of a local transport coefficient , not only its bulk values .",
    "both the interfacial resistances and the interfacial conductances depend on the variation of the enthalpy across the interface .",
    "the overall transport coefficients depend on the equilibrium enthalpies which vary a lot through the interface .",
    "one can see from the above formulae , that the dependence on the enthalpy of evaporation ( the difference between the enthalpies of the liquid and gas phases ) is crucial not only for the diagonal diffusion coefficient , but also for the off - diagonal coefficients .",
    "this is an important result since cross coefficients are usually neglected in the description of the interfacial phenomena .",
    "the curvature of the surface is important for such processes as nucleation . as the radius of the droplet becomes smaller , the higher moments of the resistivities contribute to the overall interfacial resistances .",
