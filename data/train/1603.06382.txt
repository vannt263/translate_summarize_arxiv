    "the determination of black hole spin is an open issue in astrophysics that has received significant attention using various methods @xcite .",
    "it turns out that the astronomical observation of a black hole shadow ( apparent shape ) may significantly help us to resolve this important open issue .",
    "it is widely believed that the black hole shadow may contain information about the nature of a black hole , and it can help us to determine the black hole spin @xcite .",
    "it is shown that the shape of a rotating black hole is deformed in an optically thin emitting medium due to the presence of spin @xcite , which for the schwarzschild black hole or a nonrotating black hole is circular @xcite .",
    "it is also believed that a supermassive black holes exist in the center of a galaxy .",
    "falcke @xcite determined the formation of images of supermassive black holes to demonstrate that a strong gravitational field bends the trajectories of photons released by a bright object and an observer can see a dark zone around a black hole . in 2002 ,",
    "holz and wheeler @xcite detected the retro - images or retro - machos of the sun by a schwarzschild black hole . in @xcite ,",
    "the author discussed the qualitative and quantitative analyses of the shape and position of the rotating black hole shadow on an optically thin accretion disk and its dependence on the angular momentum .",
    "a black hole casts a shadow as an optical appearance because of its strong gravitational field , which for the schwarzschild black hole is investigated in the pioneer study of synge @xcite and luminet @xcite who also suggested a formula to calculate the angular radius of the shadow @xcite .",
    "it is shown that a shadow of the schwarzschild black hole is a perfect circle @xcite through the gravitational lensing either in vacuum @xcite or in plasma @xcite .",
    "bardeen @xcite studied the appearance of a shadow cast by the kerr black hole ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "it can be seen for the kerr black hole that the shadow is no longer circular ; it has a deformed or distorted shape in the direction of rotation @xcite . the shadow of the kerr black hole or a kerr naked singularity by constructing observables has been discussed by hioki and maeda @xcite .",
    "the shadows of several black holes and naked singularities , have been rigorously studied in the last few years , e.g. , for the kerr - newman black hole @xcite , einstein - maxwell - dilaton - axion black hole @xcite , kerr - taub - nut black hole @xcite , rotating braneworld black hole @xcite , kaluza - klein rotating dilaton black hole @xcite , rotating non - kerr black hole @xcite , kerr - newman - nut black holes with cosmological constant @xcite , and the kerr black hole with scalar hair @xcite .",
    "a coordinate - independent characterization of a black hole shadow is discussed in @xcite .",
    "the study of shadows has also been extended for the five - dimensional rotating myers - perry black hole @xcite .",
    "recently , significant attention has been devoted to studying various nonsingular models @xcite including its shadow @xcite .    in the absence of a well - defined quantum gravity ,",
    "models of nonsingular black holes have received significant attention @xcite .",
    "in contrast to classical black holes where singularities are unavoidable , the nonsingular black holes also have horizons , but there is no singularity and their metrics as well as their curvature invariants are well behaved everywhere .",
    "bardeen @xcite proposed the first nonsingular black hole which is a solution of the einstein equations coupled to an electromagnetic field , yielding an alteration of the reissner - nordstrm metric .",
    "however , the physical source associated with a bardeen solution was obtained much later by ayn - beato and garca @xcite . later , the exact self - consistent solutions for the nonsingular black hole for the dynamics of gravity coupled to nonlinear electrodynamics was obtained @xcite . subsequently , there has been an intense activity in the investigation of nonsingular black holes @xcite . recently",
    ", ghosh @xcite employed a probability distribution inspired mass function @xmath5 to replace the kerr black hole mass @xmath6 to obtain a rotating nonsingular black hole .",
    "it has an additional deviation parameter @xmath2 which is identified asymptotically ( @xmath7 ) exactly as the kerr - newman black hole and as the kerr black hole when @xmath8 .",
    "thus , the rotating nonsingular black hole is a generalization of the kerr black hole .",
    "the subject of this paper is to study the size and apparent shape of this rotating nonsingular black hole , and its changes due to the parameter @xmath2 , by analyzing in detail the unstable circular orbits .",
    "thus , we have studied the effect of the parameter @xmath2 on the shape of a shadow of the kerr black hole . as in case of the kerr black hole ,",
    "we use two observables@xmath9the radius @xmath10 and the distortion parameter @xmath11 , characterizing the apparent shape .",
    "we found that these observables and , hence , the shape of the shadows are affected by the parameter @xmath2 .",
    "interestingly , the size of the shadow , decreases with parameter @xmath2 for a given value of @xmath1 in rotating nonsingular black hole , thereby suggesting a smaller shadow than in the kerr black hole .",
    "thus , the larger value of the deviation parameter @xmath2 leads to a decrease in the size of the shadow , and thus @xmath10 decreases with an increase in @xmath2 .",
    "the distortion of the shadow is characterized by the observable @xmath11 which for the case of a rotating nonsingular black hole increases monotonically with the parameter @xmath2 .",
    "thus , the black hole becomes more distorted or deformed with the increase in parameter @xmath2 for a given value of @xmath1 .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ spacetime ] , we briefly review the rotating nonsingular black hole and the study of the ergoregion for this black hole . in sec .",
    "[ geodesics ] , we obtain the geodesics of the photon and also discuss the effective potential . in sec .",
    "[ shadow ] , we obtain the apparent shapes of the rotating nonsingular black hole and calculate the observables , and in sec .  [ ee rate ] , we study the energy emission rate of the black hole . finally , we conclude in sec .",
    "[ conclusion ] .",
    "the metric of the rotating nonsingular black holes was obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite , which in boyer - lindquist coordinates ( @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 ) , with gravitational units @xmath16 , reads @xmath17 \\sin^2 \\theta d\\phi^2,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath18 and @xmath19 are given by @xmath20 the parameters @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 ( @xmath21 ) , respectively , represent the mass , spin , and deviation parameter .",
    "the metric ( [ metric ] ) reduces to the kerr solution @xcite if the parameter @xmath8 and to the schwarzschild solution for both @xmath22 @xcite .",
    "the detailed analysis of the horizon structure and the energy conditions of the metric ( [ metric ] ) are also discussed @xcite .",
    "it is noted that the metric ( [ metric ] ) is singular at @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "however , @xmath23 is a coordinate singularity .",
    "it is seen that the metric  ( [ metric ] ) , for @xmath7 , can be identified as kerr - newman @xcite , i.e. , for @xmath7 , one gets @xmath25 where the charge @xmath26 and mass @xmath0 are related to the deviation parameter @xmath2 via @xmath27 .",
    "the astrophysical black hole candidates are expected to be the kerr black holes , but the actual nature of these astrophysical objects has still to be verified @xcite .",
    "the nonsingular metric can be seen as the prototype of a large class of non - kerr black hole metrics , in which the components of the metric tensor have the same expressions as that of the kerr black hole with @xmath0 replaced by a mass function @xmath28 that reduces to @xmath6 as @xmath29 @xcite .",
    "further , non - kerr black holes or nonsingular ones may indeed look like kerr black holes with different spin ; e.g. , the nonsingular ones with some nonzero values of the deviation parameter and spin parameter that are higher ( lower ) than the value of the spin parameter ( say @xmath30 ) look like kerr black holes with spin parameter higher ( lower ) than @xmath30 .",
    "these black holes have an additional deviation parameter .",
    "the standard procedure to test the kerr black hole with the observational x - ray data in cygnus x-1 is developed in refs .",
    "thus , to test the nonsingular metric with the x - ray data of the black hole candidate in cygnus x-1 would be to repeat the algorithm of refs .",
    "@xcite with the kerr background replaced by the nonsingular black holes .",
    "the procedure has been applied to test the bardeen metric with the x - ray data of the black hole candidate in cygnus x-1 with the kerr black hole background replaced by the bardeen @xcite .",
    "the spin parameter and the inclination angle can be determined by observing the apparent shape of the shadow , which is distorted mainly by these two parameters , defining some observables characterizing the apparent shape ( its radius and distortion parameter ) .",
    "it has been shown that the spin parameter and the inclination angle of a kerr black hole can be determined by the observation @xcite .",
    "one can assume that the observations may allow non - kerr black holes or the nonsingular black holes considered as real astrophysical black hole candidates ; hence , the technique @xcite can be used to determine how the spin parameter may change due to the additional parameter @xmath2 .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^ \" , ]      we first consider the nonrotating case , @xmath31 , in which case the metric ( [ metric ] ) reduces to one obtained in @xcite . in this case , the parameters @xmath32 and @xmath33 satisfy @xmath34 where @xmath13 is the radius of circular orbits . the black hole shadow or plots of eqs .",
    "( [ alpha2 ] ) and ( [ beta2 ] ) are presented in fig .",
    "they are perfect circles .",
    "it can be observed from the plots that the parameter @xmath2 reduces the radius of the shadow ( cf .",
    "[ k - obs ] ) . consider the case when @xmath8 , and eq .",
    "( [ nonrot ] ) transforms into @xmath35 equation  ( [ nonrot0 ] ) is exactly the same as the one obtained for the schwarzschild black hole @xcite .",
    "plot showing the schematic representation of the observable . ]",
    "it is shown that for a rotating black hole the shadow has an atypical deformation due to spin parameters instead of being a perfect circle . here",
    "we wish to further analyze the effect of parameter @xmath2 on the apparent shapes of the rotating nonsingular black hole . furthermore , if @xmath8 , eq .",
    "( [ alpha&beta1 ] ) reduces to @xmath36 now , consider the case when the spin is nonzero , i.e. , @xmath37 .",
    "we have plotted the shapes of the shadow in figs .",
    "[ theta ] and [ k ] . in fig .",
    "[ theta ] , we show the contours of the black hole shadow for various values of deviation parameter @xmath2 with different inclination angles @xmath38 .",
    "indeed , the shapes of the shadow are dependent on the inclination angle of the observer .",
    "furthermore , fig .",
    "[ k ] shows the effect of parameter @xmath2 on the shadow of a black hole .",
    "it is clear from fig .",
    "[ k ] that when @xmath1 and @xmath2 take critical values , the shape of the shadow is more deformed .    furthermore , to calculate the actual size and distortion of the black hole shadow , let us define the observable that characterizes the black hole shadow , namely , @xmath39 and @xmath40 , where the parameters @xmath39 and @xmath40 correspond to the actual size of the shadow and distortion in the shape of the shadow , respectively .",
    "the radius of the shadow can be calculated by considering a circle passing through the three points at the top , bottom , and rightmost corresponding to ( @xmath41,@xmath42 ) , ( @xmath43,@xmath44 ) , and ( @xmath45,@xmath46 ) , respectively @xcite .",
    "the definitions of these observables are given by @xcite @xmath47 and @xmath48 where @xmath49 and @xmath50 are the points where the reference circle and the contour of the shadow cut the horizontal axis at the opposite side of @xmath51 ( cf .",
    "[ observable ] ) .",
    "the plots of the observable can be seen from fig .",
    "[ obs ] which shows that when parameter @xmath2 increases , the radius of the shadow decreases and the distortion increases .",
    "next , we are interested in calculating the rate of energy emission by the rotating nonsingular black hole .",
    "first of all , we know that the limiting constant value of the absorption cross section for a spherically symmetric black hole is given by @xmath52 the black hole shadow is responsible for the high - energy absorption cross section for a distant observer . the mentioned limiting constant value is derived in terms of geodesics and can be analyzed for the wave theories . for a black hole endowed with a photon sphere , the limiting constant value is the same as the geometrical cross section of this photon sphere .",
    "now , by using this limiting constant value , we can compute the energy emission rate @xcite by @xmath53 where @xmath54 this generalizes the hawking temperature of the kerr black hole , and @xmath55 represents the event horizon . if @xmath8 , then one obtains the hawking temperature , @xmath56 for the kerr black hole @xcite .",
    "the plots of the energy emission rate ( @xmath57 ) versus the frequency ( @xmath58 ) can be seen from fig .",
    "[ ee ] for @xmath31 and @xmath59 by varying the parameter @xmath2 .",
    "it is clear that , for small values of @xmath2 , the energy emission rate is high and if it takes a maximum value , then the energy emission rate is low .",
    "the investigation of the shadows of different types of black holes has been an important subject of research because that the observations of a black hole in the center of a galaxy may be determined @xcite .",
    "the shadow of a kerr black hole is distorted mainly by its spin parameter and the inclination angle .",
    "it is a perfect circle for the schwarzschild black hole .    in this paper",
    ", we make a qualitative analysis of the shapes of the black hole shadow cast by a rotating nonsingular black hole which has an additional deviation parameter @xmath2 and also perform a detailed study of its ergoregion .",
    "the dependence of black hole shadows and ergoregions on spin @xmath1 and parameter @xmath2 are explicitly discussed . with the help of a study of null geodesics around the rotating nonsingular black hole ,",
    "we construct the parameters @xmath60 and @xmath61 by using the circular orbit conditions and discuss the behavior of the effective potential .",
    "we consider the black hole shadows for both nonrotating and rotating cases to bring out the effect of spin @xmath1 and parameter @xmath2 .",
    "the shape of the shadows for the nonrotating black hole are perfect circles , and the size decreases with increasing value of @xmath2 . in the next paragraph",
    ", we studied the shape of shadows for the rotating black hole . in this case , the shape is not a perfect circle , but it is deformed due to the presence of spin @xmath1 and parameter @xmath2 .",
    "one can observe that the area of the ergoregion increases with an increase either in parameter @xmath2 or spin @xmath1 .",
    "the observables @xmath39 and @xmath40 are defined to characterize the shape of the black hole shadow .",
    "we demonstrate the influence of the parameter @xmath2 on observables @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "it shows that the value of @xmath10 decreases and @xmath11 increases with the parameter @xmath2 .",
    "the results obtained are similar to the kerr black hole shadows @xcite , but the size of the shadow decreases due to the deviation parameter @xmath2 .",
    "the results obtained here may provide insight to into the qualitative features of a nonsingular black hole .",
    "we have done a detailed analysis of a rotating nonsingular black hole from the viewpoint of the ergoregion and shadow that contains the kerr black hole analysis as the special case when the deviation parameter @xmath8 .",
