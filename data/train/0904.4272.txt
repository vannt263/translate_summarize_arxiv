    "a common technique when studying a class of mathematical objects is to undertake a quotienting process and reduce the problem to studying the `` basic '' objects in the class , these being the objects which have no proper quotients .",
    "this technique has been employed very successfully in graph theory , in particular in the study of distance transitive graphs @xcite , @xmath0-arc - transitive graphs @xcite and locally @xmath0-arc - transitive graphs @xcite .",
    "the success of such methods relies on taking appropriate quotients so that the quotient inherits the desired properties of the original object .",
    "bipartite graphs are incidence geometries of rank two for which the cited results apply . for higher ranks we do nt have such insight .",
    "the aim of this paper is to study quotients of incidence geometries in general and to understand when a geometric property is inherited by a quotient .",
    "the reverse operation of expanding a given geometry to discover families of geometries with the given one as quotient is also important .",
    "quotients of geometries are featured in particular in the seminal 1981 paper of tits @xcite , and in pasini s standard reference @xcite for diagram geometries . in these works various restrictions are made , both on the geometries and the projection maps to the quotients .    like tits",
    ", we consider quotients of what we now call pregeometries ( see below ) and what tits called ` geometries ' .",
    "also , like pasini ( but unlike tits ) , the most general quotients we consider are constructed modulo a type - refining partition ( see subsection [ sec : prelim ] ) .",
    "we also consider the special quotients that tits considered ( and that we call ` orbit - quotients ' ) , constructed modulo the orbits of some subgroup of automorphisms , and an even more special class called ` normal quotients ' that proved effective in the case of @xmath0-arc - transitive and locally @xmath0-arc - transitive graphs mentioned above .",
    "fundamental problems that arise are :    [ prob:1 ] determine when the quotient of a geometry is a geometry .",
    "[ prob:2 ] determine when the quotient of a flag - transitive geometry is a flag - transitive geometry .",
    "because of the restricted type of quotients considered by tits or pasini , these problems essentially did not arise in their work .",
    "however , in a general investigation of the quotients of geometries and pregeometries , they are among the most important problems to consider . in section  [ sec : survey ] , we give a brief summary of the kinds of quotients considered by tits and pasini , together with some instructive examples to facilitate an understanding of our results , and enable their comparison with earlier work .    a partial answer to problem [ prob:1 ]",
    "is given by the following theorem which is a combination of lemmas [ lem : rank3 ] , [ lem : flagliftgeom ] , [ lem : covgivesgeom ] , [ lem : iscovering ] and [ lem : shadowable ] .",
    "the basic definitions for pregeometries are given in subsection  [ sec : prelim ] , covers are discussed in section  [ sec : covers ] and shadowable geometries are discussed in section  [ sec : shadowable ] .",
    "the ( flagslift ) condition is introduced in subsection  [ sec : flagslift ] and essentially states that every flag in the quotient arises as the projection of a flag in the original geometry .",

    "we see in remark [ rem : coseteg ] that even a normal quotient of a flag - transitive geometry need not be a geometry and even if it is a geometry it need not satisfy the ( flagslift ) condition . in constructions [ con : blowup ] and [ con : liftshadowable ] we give two different ways of lifting a geometry to a larger geometry which has the initial geometry as a quotient .    in section [ sec : props ] we explore the geometric properties of connectivity and firmness to determine the impact of the quotienting operation .",
