    "most of the effort in the research on irreversible adsorption is focused on flat homogeneous surfaces as it can be further directly exploited in material sciences .",
    "however , experiments using fractal - like collectors were also made @xcite , though preparation of such surfaces is complicated . on the other hand , there are many porous media in nature and adsorption may play an important role there @xcite .",
    "for example , coral fractal - like structure helps them to catch plankton effectively @xcite .",
    "adsorption on fractal collectors might also be applied in environmental protection in designing effective water or air filters @xcite .",
    "hard spheres packing has a rich research history , both in physics and maths .",
    "the greatest interest has been shown in the maximal possible packing @xcite .",
    "the most common property of a given packing is its density . in @xmath3",
    "dimensional euclidean space , it is given by @xmath4 where @xmath5 is a number of spheres in a unit volume , and @xmath6 is a volume of @xmath3 dimensional sphere having radius @xmath7 .",
    "@xmath8 is the euler gamma function .",
    "presented work focuses on the properties of maximal random coverages , built of spherical particles on flat collectors having fractal dimension of a non - integer value .",
    "earlier , similar studies concentrated mostly on adsorption on lattice collectors .",
    "their popularity was powered by a number of analytic results obtained , e.g.  @xcite .",
    "other investigations concerning fractal collectors concentrate on diffusion properties @xcite or adsorption on rough surfaces @xcite .",
    "fractal structures formed in the adsorption processes were also observed @xcite .",
    "dimensional properties of adsorption layers were studied mostly for collectors having integer dimensions , with special attention paid to two - dimensional case , e.g. @xcite , due to its potential application in chemistry and material science . here , the only analytically solved case is a one - dimensional problem known also as  car parking problem  for which @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "the analysis of hard spheres random packing for @xmath10 , nicely reviewed in @xcite , shows that maximal random coverage ratio decreases with the growth of collector s dimension : @xmath11 with @xmath12 and @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "there are also some characteristics , which do not depend qualitatively on dimension .",
    "for example the two - point density correlation function for maximal random coverages is known to have superexponential decay for large distances @xcite @xmath14 and logarithmic singularity when particles are in touch @xcite @xmath15    the aim of this work is to check if the mentioned characteristics are valid for adsorption on collectors having non - integer fractal dimensions .",
    "the maximal coverages has been obtained here numerically by using random sequential adsorption ( rsa ) algorithm @xcite described in detail in section [ sec : model ] .",
    "the kinetics of rsa simulation has also been of interest to the authors of this work , as it affects estimation of @xmath16 . for sufficiently long simulation time the coverage ratio @xmath17 scales with collector s dimension @xcite : @xmath18 here @xmath19 .",
    "importance of the above relation is increased by the fact that it is also valid for other molecules , more complex than simple spheres @xcite . to model collectors having dimension from a range of @xmath20 the sierpinski s triangle and , carpet - like fractals",
    "adsorption for @xmath2 is studied using general cantor set .",
    "maximal random coverages are generated using rsa algorithm , which has been successfully applied to study colloidal systems .",
    "it is based on independent , repeated attempts of adding sphere to a covering film .",
    "the numerical procedure is carried out in the following steps :    i : :    a virtual sphere is created with its centre position on a collector    chosen randomly according to the uniform probability distribution ; ii : :    an overlapping test is performed for previously adsorbed nearest    neighbours of the virtual particle .",
    "the test checks if    surface - to - surface distance between spheres is greater than zero ; iii : :    if there is no overlap the virtual particle is irreversibly adsorbed    and added to an existing covering layer",
    ". its position does not change    during further calculations ; iiii : :    if there is an overlap the virtual sphere is removed and abandoned .",
    "attempts are repeated iteratively .",
    "their number is usually expressed in a  dimensionless time units : @xmath21 where @xmath22 is a number of attempts and @xmath23 denotes an area of a single sphere projection on a collector .",
    "typically , @xmath24 is a collector area .",
    "although formally the area of any fractal having @xmath25 is zero , @xmath24 denotes here an area of an overlapping square and is equal to @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is a radius of an adsorbed sphere .",
    "collectors are modeled as a successive iteration of a given fractal . for each collector type",
    "at least @xmath28 independent numerical experiments have been performed .",
    "sample coverages are presented in fig.[fig : examples ]    .,width=302 ]    dimension of a given fractal is estimated using relation @xmath29 where @xmath30 is a number of identical smaller parts created in a single iteration and @xmath31 is a scale change . in case of cantor dust , for example , after one iteration four smaller squares appear after one iteration @xmath32 with a side length three times smaller than in the original square @xmath33 .",
    "therefore , dimension of cantor dust is @xmath34    coverage ratio of a given adsorption layer is determined by using random sampling of collector s points and checking whether they are covered by any , previously adsorbed sphere : @xmath35 where @xmath36 is a number of covered points after a dimensionless time @xmath37 ; @xmath38 denotes total number of sampled points .",
    "here @xmath39 , which provides statistical error at the level of @xmath40 .",
    "there are two factors affecting maximal random coverage ratio obtained during simulation .",
    "first , the collector used is not an actual fractal but only a two - dimensional approximation and the number of adsorbed spheres clearly depends on the level of this approximation ( see fig.[fig : examples ] ) .",
    "second , the maximal random coverage is defined for a collector having infinite size and is achieved after an infinite simulation time .    to handle the first factor ,",
    "the successive iterations of fractals have been used .",
    "the number of adsorbed particles becomes stable at about the @xmath41 fractal iteration ( see fig.[fig:2dni ] ) .",
    "similarly , the coverage calculated using eq.([eq : qt ] ) does not change thereafter , too ( fig.[fig:2dti ] ) . therefore , using the @xmath42 iteration has been assumed to be save and to give reliable results .         as a function of fractal s iteration .",
    "iteration zero is a  solid triangle in case of the sierpinski s triangle and a square in all the other cases.,width=302 ]    to obtain maximal random coverage ratio after an infinite time , the rsa kinetics model has to be used .",
    "the analysis of numerical experiments shows that rsa for spheres in integer dimensions obeys the feder s law ( [ eq : feder ] ) .",
    "the results presented in fig.[fig : federlaw ] confirm that for almost all the cases analysed in this study .",
    "additionally , the difference between observed maximal number of adsorbed particles for @xmath43 and the asymptotic value does not exceed @xmath44 .",
    "coverage does not grow asymptotically only in case of adsorption on the sole incoherent collector studied , the cantor dust . in this case , the maximal possible number of @xmath45 particles is adsorbed after relatively short time .",
    "this is due to geometrical relations between collector size and spheres diameter ( see fig.[fig : cantordust ] ) .",
    "after four iterations , each of the remaining squares has a side length of @xmath46 and can adsorb only one sphere .",
    "moreover , due to the large distance between parts of the fractal , particle adsorbed on one square can not block absorption events on its neighbouring squares .",
    "therefore , each square contains a single sphere .",
    "it is noteworthy that further iterations of the fractal do not affect the above reasoning .",
    "therefore , after catching @xmath47 spheres no further adsorption acts are possible .",
    "investigating the relationship between maximal random coverage ratio and fractal dimension is the main purpose of this study .",
    "although , there are number of studies providing lower and upper limits for a saturated coverage , e.g. @xcite , the best direct fit so far is given by eq.([eq : fit1 ] ) .",
    "it perfectly matches simulation data for @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "however , it does not work well for @xmath48 where @xmath49 and @xmath50 where @xmath51 . to obtain better approximation",
    ", we added next order term in the nominator of relation ( [ eq : fit1 ] ) : @xmath52 figure [ fig : qd16 ] presents plot of @xmath16 where values for @xmath1 were obtained with ( [ eq : qt ] ) and ( [ eq : feder ] ) whereas values for @xmath53 were taken from @xcite .    )",
    "fit ( @xmath54 and @xmath55 ) , whereas dashed line is the ( [ eq : fit2 ] ) fit with @xmath56 , @xmath57 and @xmath58.,width=302 ]    the fit defined by eq.([eq : fit2 ] ) matches the data for @xmath0 and is characterized by correlation coefficient @xmath59 .",
    "furthermore , the parameter @xmath60 corresponds very well to random saturation density for @xmath50 .",
    "the correction given by the third term @xmath61 = @xmath62 is important mostly for large @xmath3 values .",
    "therefore , simulations for higher dimensions should determine whether @xmath63 should remain or not .      two - point correlation functions for fractal collectors are presented in fig.[fig : cor ] .    again ,",
    "except for the case of cantor dust collector , all the plots look typical ; for @xmath64 , however , the specific fractal structure is manifested by a number of local extremes .",
    "therefore , the pure superexponential decay ( [ eq : corfast ] ) can not be observed . for small values of @xmath27 ,",
    "the logarithmic singularity ( [ eq : corlog ] ) appears just as for adsorption in higher dimensions . in case of the cantor dust collector",
    ", the two - point correlation function behaviour is strictly connected with cluster character of the fractal .",
    "there is also no point to investigate the singularities at kissing limit because close packing is restricted by incoherent structure of the fractal .",
    "the preliminary rsa simulation has been also performed for @xmath2 using general cantor set ( gcs ) as a collector .",
    "the gcs dimension depends on the size of middle part removed in each iteration : @xmath65}\\ ] ] where @xmath66 is the relative length of the removed fragment . for standard cantor set @xmath67 thus @xmath68 .",
    "the diameter of the collector used during simulations was @xmath69 .",
    "the dependence of @xmath70 on dimension value is shown in fig.[fig : qd06 ] .     for @xmath2 .",
    "dots represent data and dashed line is the ( [ eq : fit2 ] ) fit with @xmath56 , @xmath57 and @xmath58 - the same as presented in fig.[fig : qd16].,width=302 ]    the data for @xmath71 are consistent with the fit ( [ eq : fit2 ] ) within an error range . for lower @xmath3 , when holes in a collector are bigger , the geometrical relations start to play the most important role .",
    "the situation is somehow similar to the cantor dust case ; however for this case , it can be proved that random maximal coverage ratio depends strictly on the particle diameter to collector size ratio .",
    "therefore , the possibility of getting reliable data for @xmath72 from rsa simulation is doubtful .",
    "there is also no point in analysing the two - point correlation function because all collectors having @xmath2 are incoherent and the correlation behaviour will mainly express the structure of a specific collector .",
    "the rsa on fractal collectors having @xmath0 was studied . for such systems ,",
    "the adsorption kinetics obey the feder s law ( [ eq : feder ] ) .",
    "moreover , the singularity of the two - point correlation function at kissing limit is logarithmic .",
    "the decay seems to be superexponential , but the autocorrelations for low dimensional fractals reflect also collector structure .",
    "it was one of the reasons why obtaining reliable results from simulation on collectors having dimension significantly lower than @xmath48 is not possible .",
    "the maximal random coverage ratio for the whole range of collector dimensions is governed by the eq.([eq : fit2 ] ) , which is a simple extension to the rule ( [ eq : fit1 ] ) introduced and analytically supported for high dimensions .",
