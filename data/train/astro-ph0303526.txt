    "the suggestion that the universe is undergoing late time acceleration ( eg efstathiou , sutherland & maddox 1990 ; riess et al .",
    "1998 ; perlmutter et al . 1999 ) has provoked a number of cosmological models that can reproduce the appropriate evolution .",
    "the obvious solution is clearly to add the cosmological constant to the equations determining the evolution of the universe ( see weinberg 1989 ) .",
    "this , as is very well known , is problematic from the point of view of particle physics due to the smallness of the required constant .",
    "it is then interesting to consider scenarios where instead of the cosmological constant , there is a new type of mechanism that can explain the acceleration of the universe . in particular , in this paper we consider two recent suggestions : the dvali - gabadadze - poratti ( dgp ) brane induced gravity -model ( dvali , gabadadze & porrati 2000 ) and the cardassian model(s ) of freese and lewis ( freese & lewis 2002 ) .",
    "both models lead to late - time acceleration with a non - standard friedmann equation and with no explicit cosmological constant .",
    "the two scenarios are , however , fundamentally different in their properties , due to the fact that the dgp - scenario is a truly higher dimensional scenario while the cardassian is an effective description .",
    "both of these scenarios have been studied from the point of view of observational constraints ( deffayet et al .",
    "2002 ; wang 2003 ; gondolo & freese 2002 ; sen & sen 2002 , 2003 ; zhu & fujimoto 2002 , 2003 ) mainly coming from the snia ( riess et al . 1998 ; perlmutter et al . 1999 ) and cmb data .",
    "the constrains are not strong enough to exclude either of the models as an alternative to the standard @xmath4-cosmology .",
    "are they compatible with other current observations , such as the large scale structure ?    in this paper",
    "we study the dgp and cardassian scenarios from the point of view of large scale structure growth . since these scenarios modify gravity on large scales , the growth is non - standard .",
    "the linear growth of perturbations in the original cardassian scenario was also briefly considered in ( gondolo & freese 2002 ) .",
    "our approach is much like that in ( gaztaaga & lobo 2001 ) , where the gravitational growth was studied in a number of non - standard scenarios .",
    "the einstein s equations are modified on large scales , so we must alter our approach accordingly .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section 2 we introduce the two scenarios and briefly consider the experimental constraints . in section 3",
    "we introduce the formalism of studying gravitational collapse in a matter dominated cosmology where energy density of matter is conserved but the friedmann equation is arbitrary . the linear and non - linear growth of perturbations in a standard @xmath4-cosmology is also discussed in this section . in sections 4 and 5 we study gravitational collapse in the dgp and cardassian scenarios and present the results .",
    "observational constraints coming from the linear and non - linear aspects of structure formation are briefly considered in section 6 .",
    "the paper is concluded in section 7 . in the appendix ,",
    "the growth of perturbations in the original cardassian model is studied analytically .",
    "the brane induced gravity model ( dvali et al . 2000 ) offers an alternative explanation to the observed acceleration by a large scale modification of gravity due to the presence of an extra dimension ( deffayet et al .",

    "there is hence no need for an explicit non - zero cosmological constant . at large enough scales gravity",

    "the brane is ( deffayet et al .",
    "2002a ) : h^2=(+1r)^2+ka^2 , where @xmath9 , @xmath10 is the curvature constant , @xmath11 the scale factor of the universe and we have defined @xmath12 , @xmath13 .",
    "the evolution of the scale factor is standard as long as the energy density of matter dominates @xmath14 .",
    "since @xmath15 decreases with time due to the expansion of the universe , the @xmath16-term becomes dominant at some point , and acting as an effective cosmological constant , it leads to an accelerating universe . at late times",
    "the scale factor grows exponentially , @xmath17 .",
    "the continuity equation is unchanged , + 3 h ( + p)=0 .",
    "we are interested in the growth of large scale structure which takes place in a matter dominated universe and hence we assume that @xmath18 and therefore the continuity equation tells us that @xmath19 .",
    "we can view the dgp - scenario as standard cosmology with a perfect fluid with the normal properties .",
    "the only difference is the non - standard friedmann equation .",

    "the normalization condition simplifies to _ m+2=1 , from where it is clear that in order to have @xmath25 , @xmath26 must be restricted to the range 0_r < 14 .    in ( deffayet et al .",
    "2002a ) this model was tested with snia and the cmb data .",
    "it was found that the model is in agreement with data and the preferred parameter values for a flat universe are _ m=0.18^+0.07_-0.06 ,  _ r=0.17^+0.03_-0.02 .      in the cardassian models",

    "the function @xmath28 is assumed to approach the standard form , @xmath29 at early times , including nucleosynthesis , and at late times , @xmath30 , to give accelerated expansion in accordance with the supernova observations @xcite .",
    "since the behavior of the function is different at different values of @xmath27 , there is an associated scale , @xmath31 , or red - shift , @xmath32 , in the function @xmath28 that determines when the evolution is standard and when the non - standard terms begin to dominate",
    ". the exact form of the model can hence vary , as long as it satisfies the aforementioned constraints .",
    "some alternative forms of the friedman equation are presented in ( freese 2002 ) .    as an example , consider the following ( original cardassian ) form of @xmath33 ( freese & lewis 2002 ) ( we omit the subscript @xmath34 from now on ) : h^2=^2+b^n ,  n<23 . at early times",
    "the universe is dominated by the @xmath29-term ( provided that @xmath35 is small enough at the time of interest ) and at late times the @xmath36-term becomes significant , providing acceleration compared to the standard case .",
    "the term of the form @xmath36 in the friedmann equation , and hence the cardassian model(s ) , is motivated by considering our universe as a brane embedded in extra dimensions ( chung & freese 2000 ) ( this idea was , however , critically reviewed in ( cline & vinet 2002 ) ) . in terms of the scale @xmath37 , eq .",
    "( [ car1 ] ) can be written as h^2=^2 , hence @xmath38 . in a matter dominated universe this",
    "is conveniently parametrized by the red - shift at which the two terms are equal , @xmath32 , h^2=^2 , where @xmath21 is the current energy density of matter .",

    "before studying the gravitational growth of structures in the two aforementioned scenarios , we first briefly introduce the usual formalism .",

    "( [ ray2 ] ) , we are using the background quantities and on the rhs the local , perturbed quantities .",
    "hence , using ( [ thet2 ] ) , we get + a+13 ^ 2a^2=3(+h^2)-3(+^2 ) . up to this point , we have not assumed anything but that we live in a frw universe filled with a perfect fluid and hence eq . ( [ ray3 ] ) applies both to the dgp- and cardassian - scenarios . in particular , we have not assumed any connection between the geometry and the energy content but simply rewritten the raychaudhuri s equation in terms of the scale factor .",
    "this is useful since now we can study the evolution of the density perturbations armed with the friedmann equation and the continuity equation , without having to concern us with the einstein s equations .",
    "obviously , these considerations make only sense on large scales where the effects of the non - standard cosmology can be seen .    in order to have a deeper understanding of the different scenarios , we recall the growth of perturbations in the standard scenario with a non - zero cosmological constant .      in the standard scenario , we know the einstein s equations so it is instructive to see how one arrives to the same result by using them and eq .",

    "for the standard einstein - de sitter case we have @xmath130 .",

    "bottom panel of figure [ ps ] shows the comoving volume element ( normalized to eds case ) in the dgp ( dashed line ) , mpc ( long dashed line ) and @xmath4 cosmology ( continuous line ) .",
    "as can be seen in the figure , the @xmath4 cosmology has about 4 times more comoving volume by @xmath132 than the eds case , while dgp and mpc are only 3 and 2 times larger .",
    "despite the smaller volumes , dgp and mpc predicts 2 and 4 times more clusters at @xmath132 than the @xmath4 cosmology because of the stronger freeze in the linear growth factor , which can be seem by comparing figure [ stfig ] to figure [ dgpfig ] .",
    "note that there are four important factors in the ps predictions : i ) @xmath22 , which relates a given cluster mass @xmath34 to @xmath125 in @xmath133 value , ii ) the shape of the power spectrum , which determines the @xmath133 curve , iii ) the volume element , and iv ) the growth factor @xmath118 which gives the red - shift variation of @xmath134 . in our analysis",
    "we fixed i ) and ii ) to the @xmath4 cosmology with @xmath135 .",
    "thus all differences in figure [ ps ] are due to differences in volume and growth factors , which mark the distinction between standard and non - standard cosmologies .",

    "( [ apps3 ] ) in the appendix ) .",
    "these are the unsmoothed values of the skewness at a single point . in practice , to relate to observations , one needs to take into account smoothing effects . for a top - hat window of a given radius @xmath125 , smoothing results in a simple linear correction that is given by the slope @xmath136 of the variance smoothed at a radius @xmath125 ( juskiewicz , bouchet & colombi 1993 ) . in the standard cosmology : @xmath137 ( eg see @xcite and references therein )",
    ". the smoothing correction should be the same for non - standard cosmologies , as long as we work within the spherical collapse model ( ie the shear - free approximation in eq .",
    "( [ ray ] ) ) , which gives the exact leading order contribution to @xmath2 for a top hat window ( see e.g. fosalba & gaztaaga 1998 ; bernardeau et al .",
    "thus , the difference between the standard predictions and the predictions from non - standard cosmologies should not be affected by these smoothing effects . besides smoothing effects ,",
    "@xmath2 is also affected by systematic uncertainties of biasing ( see  7.1 in bernardeau et al .",
    "2002 ) .",
    "current estimations for @xmath2 ( see  8 in @xcite ) agree with the standard predictions but with large uncertainties , of order @xmath138 .",
    "thus current observations on @xmath2 can not be used to separate the different models .",
    "next generation catalogues , such as the sloan digital sky survey , are expected to reduce the sampling variance uncertainties to @xmath139 ( see e.g. szapudi , colombi & bernardeau 1999 ; verde et al .",
    "thus , after removing biasing uncertainties , future measurements on @xmath2 could be used to constraint some of the mpc parameters ( e.g. see figs .",
    "[ mpcfig5 ] and [ mpcfig6 ] ) .",
    "in this paper we have studied the growth of large scale structure in non - standard cosmological scenarios that can undergo acceleration without having an explicit cosmological constant . in order to do this ,",
    "we have extended the standard spherical collapse formalism to account for the non - standard equations .",
    "all that is needed is the friedmann equation and the assumption that the energy density of matter is conserved .",
    "the applicability of our approach is limited to very large scales , where einstein s equations can be modified .",
    "of the two studied scenarios , the dgp - model is more attractive since it is based on physics coming from brane cosmology whereas the mpc - model is a more phenomenological approach . in a flat universe",
    "the dgp - model has only a single free parameter , @xmath22 , but this model is still found to be in accordance with the current observations on large scale structure .",
    "the mpc model has two additional parameters so that it is less surprising that observations on large scale structure do not rule out such a model .",
    "in the dgp- and mpc- models it was found that linear growth is inhibited due to the accelerated expansion , like in the standard @xmath4-cosmology .",
    "depending on the values of the parameters , the suppression at present compared to the eds - case can be as much as 50% .",
    "the non - linear growth was studied by considering the value of the skewness . for dgp ,",
    "the deviation from the eds - value is larger than in the @xmath4-case but still only of the order of one percent . in the mpc - scenario ,",
    "however , the story is quite different and the value of skewness can vary up to @xmath99 percent .    in order to evaluate the significance of the non - standard evolution of large scale perturbations , one obviously needs to relate the predictions of the linear and non - linear growth rate to observations .",
    "as was discussed in section 6 , the linear normalization of large scale density fields can vary greatly .",
    "the value of @xmath1 can be much smaller in the mpc- and dgp- scenarios when compared to the standard @xmath4-cosmology with the same normalization at high redshift .",
    "intriguingly , there is already some observational indication of a small value of @xmath1 at low red - shifts but more observational data is needed in order to determine whether this effect is real .",
    "we also find that in the mpc - scenario , the linear growth can actually be faster than in the eds universe for a limited range of red - shift .",
    "this is an interesting property since models that have late time acceleration typically lead to less linear growth at all times . in any case ,",
    "observations of @xmath1 at low red - shifts , combined with the precision cmb data coming from the _ wmap _ ( and in the future _ planck _ ) mission , will be a powerful probe of non - standard cosmological evolution .",
    "another quantity that is strongly affected by the non - standard linear evolution is the number counts of objects .",
    "as it was shown in section 6 , using the press - schechter formalism gives strong predictions for the number of clusters that differ significantly from one expects in a @xmath4-cosmology .",
    "again , studying the number counts of clusters at different red - shifts gives another way to constrain non - standard cosmological models such as the dgp- and mpc - scenarios .",
    "the higher order statistics can also be modified by the non - standard effects . in this paper",
    "we have considered the normalized skewness , @xmath2 , whose evolution can be straightforwardly extracted in each model .",
    "the skewness gives another probe of possible atypical cosmological evolution .",
    "typically , the effect on the skewness of different cosmological scenarios , @xmath4-cosmology and quintessence @xcite , is very small and totally unobservable .",
    "however , as we have seen here ( see also gaztaaga & lobo 2001 ) , the effect can be much larger and can possibly be detected in the near future experiments such as the sloan digital sky survey .",
    "the growth of large scale structure is tightly bound to the overall evolution of the universe and hence to the particular cosmological model . as such ,",
    "along with the snia and cmb data , it is a powerful tool to probe the space of possible cosmologies .",
    "current large scale structure data agrees well with the two proposals that explain late time acceleration without a cosmological constant .",
    "this agreement is not trivial in the case of dgp , as there are no additional free parameters , once we fit to the snia data or the value of @xmath22 .",
    "we have shown here how upcoming surveys of large scale structure can be used to further constrain these non - standard models and differentiate then from the now standard @xmath4 model .",
