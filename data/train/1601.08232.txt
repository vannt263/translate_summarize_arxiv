    "placing a system of monodisperse rodlike viruses ( filamentous bacteriophages ) in the presence of a non - adsorbing polymer leads to effective depletion attractions that drive lateral association of rods .",
    "when the rodlike particles are chiral , their lateral interactions have a preferred twist , causing them to form a variety of fascinating one - rod - length thick assemblies , including one - dimensional twisted ribbons , braided ribbons , starfish shapes and membranes with twist domain walls @xcite .",
    "considerable theoretical effort has been devoted to modeling and understanding the properties of these self - assemblies ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",

    "the two rod species co - assemble to form bidisperse membranes ( still one - rod - length thick ) , but the distributions of the rods within the membrane depend sensitively on polymer concentration . at low polymer concentrations rods mix homogeneously , while at high concentrations they undergo macrophase separation . at intermediate polymer concentrations , sharma et al .",

    "@xcite measured the interaction potential between pairs of rafts , which they found to be repulsive and exponentially decaying with raft edge - edge separation .",
    "they suggested a physical mechanism for this repulsion , noting that the formation of right - handed rafts in a background of left - handed rods helps alleviate the frustration that arises from the incompatibility of chiral twist and membrane layer formation .",
    "they provided evidence for this explanation by measuring the rod tilt angle at the edge of the rafts , and found that the raft interaction potential for rafts of different sizes collapses on top of each other when rescaled by the tilt angle at the edge .",
    "furthermore , they found that the range of the interaction is independent of raft size , while the strength grows linearly with increasing raft size .",
    "in this paper we present quantitative modeling of the physical mechanism suggested by sharma et al . , focusing on the role of liquid crystal director elasticity in the interaction of chiral rafts .",
    "we do not address the formation or optimal size of the rafts .",
    "we assume that rafts of a particular size have formed ( either naturally or via manipulation by optical tweezers ) , and determine the tilt angle in their interiors and the intervening background membrane , by numerically minimizing the frank elastic energy .",
    "we then compute the interaction between the rafts by comparing the free energy of the system ( rafts plus background membrane ) with a reference system in which the rafts are far apart and noninteracting .",
    "our tilt angle profiles support the physical mechanism for the repulsive raft interaction suggested by sharma et al . @xcite .",
    "the theory allows prediction of how the strength of the raft interaction potential depends on a number of experimentally controllable parameters , such as raft size , the magnitude of chiral twist and elastic moduli for raft or background rods .",
    "we find that the twist penetration depth in the background membrane sets the characteristic decay length of the the raft interaction .",
    "thus , as observed in the experiments , we find that the decay length is independent of raft diameter .",
    "also in agreement with experiment , we find that the strength of the raft interaction increases with increasing raft diameter .",
    "one discrepancy between theory and experiments is that experimentally measured interaction potentials for different - sized rafts collapse into a single curve when rescaled by the tilt angle at the raft edge @xcite ; our theoretical curves come closer together upon rescaling but do not fully collapse .",
    "the mediation of the raft interaction by the background director field is an example of a more general phenomenon of membrane - mediated interactions between membrane inclusions , of which there are examples in liquid crystal systems @xcite , models of embedded proteins in biological membranes @xcite and lipid rafts in cell membranes @xcite .",
    "the bidisperse filamentous bacteriophage experiments established a highly controllable experimental platform with which to measure such membrane - mediated interactions .",
    "our theory provides a means to probe the physical mechanisms underlying these measurements .",
