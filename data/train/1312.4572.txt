    "the theory of the rossby wave instability ( rwi ) in accretion discs was developed by lovelace ( 1999 ) and li ( 2000 ) for thin keplerian discs with negligible self - gravity and earlier by lovelace and hohlfeld ( 1978 ) for thin disc galaxies where the self - gravity may or may not be important and where the rotation is in general non - keplerian . in the first case",
    "the instability can occur if there is an axisymmetric bump ( as a function of radius ) in the inverse potential vorticity @xmath3 at some radius @xmath0 , where @xmath4 is the surface mass density of the disc , @xmath5 is the flow velocity of the disc , @xmath6 is the angular velocity of the flow ( with @xmath7 the mass of the central star ) , @xmath8 is the specific entropy of the gas , and @xmath9 is the specific heat ratio .",
    "the approximations involve the neglect of the relatively small radial pressure force ( see sec . 3 ) .",
    "note that @xmath10 is related to the inverse of the _ vortensity _ which is defined as @xmath11 .",
    "a sketch of a bump in @xmath12 is shown in figure [ fig1 ] .",
    "rossby waves are important in planetary atmospheres and oceans and are also known as _ planetary waves _ ( see rossby 1939 ; brekhovskikh and goncharov 1993 ; chelton and schlax 1996 ; lindzen 2005 ) .",
    "these waves have a significant role in the transport of heat from equatorial to polar regions of the earth .",
    "they may have a role in the formation of the long - lived ( @xmath13 yr ) great red spot on jupiter which is an anticyclonic vortex ( e.g. , marcus 1993 ) .",
    "the rossby waves have the notable property of having the phase velocity opposite to the direction of motion of the atmosphere or disc in the comoving frame of the fluid ( brekhovskikh and goncharov 1993 ; lovelace 1999 ) .",

    "9 gives a brief conclusion .",
    "linearization of the euler and continuity equations for a thin fluid disc with perturbations proportional to @xmath14 ( with azimuthal mode number @xmath15 and angular frequency @xmath16 ) leads to a schrdinger - like equation for the enthalpy perturbation @xmath17 , @xmath18 the effective potential well @xmath19 is closely related to @xmath12 : if the height of the bump in @xmath12 is too small the potential well is shallow and there are no ` bound rossby wave states ' in the well . on the other hand for a sufficiently large bump in @xmath12",
    "the potential @xmath20 is sufficiently deep to have a bound state .",
    "the condition for there to be just one bound state allows one to solve for the imaginary part of the wave frequency , @xmath21 which is the growth rate of the instability ( lovelace et al . 1999 ) . for moderate strength bumps ( with fractional amplitudes @xmath22 ) , the growth rates are of the order of @xmath23 .",
    "the real part of the wave frequency @xmath24 is approxiamtely @xmath25 .        a more complete analysis ( tagger 2001 ; tsang and lai 2008 ; lai and tsang 2009 ) reveals that the rossby wave is not completely trapped in the potential well @xmath20 , but leaks outward across a forbidden region at an outer lindblad resonance ( at @xmath26 indicated in figure [ fig1 ] ) and inward across another forbidden region at an inner lindblad resonance ( at @xmath27 ) .",
    "once the waves cross the forbidden regions they propagate as spiral density wave . the full expression for the effective potential for a thin _ homentropic _ ( @xmath28 const ) disc is @xmath29+{m^2 \\over r^2 } + { \\kappa^2-(\\delta \\omega)^2 \\over c_s^2}~ , \\eqno(3)\\ ] ] where @xmath30 is the doppler shifted wave frequency in the reference frame moving with the disc matter , @xmath31 is the sound speed in the disc , and @xmath32 is the radial epicyclic angular frequency , with @xmath33 and @xmath34 the specific angular momentum ( meheut 2013 ) .",
    "figure [ fig2 ] shows the effective potential for sample cases .",
    "note that the inward propagating waves with @xmath35 have negative energy ( @xmath36 ) whereas the outward propagating waves with @xmath37 have positive energy ( @xmath38 ) ( e.g. , meheut 2013 ) .",
    "the rossby wave instability is analogous to the _ plane parallel shear instability _ which can be interpreted in terms of counter - propagating rossby waves on either side of the resonance layer ( @xmath0 ) and the over - reflection of waves from this resonance layer ( lindzen 1988 ; harnik and heifetz 2007 ) .",
    "the analogy remains to be fully investigated .",
    "an interpretation of the rossby instability as arising from the interaction of two `` edge waves '' on either side of the bump in @xmath12 is given by umurhan ( 2010 ) who points out the analogy of the rwi with the _ diochotron _ instability ( buneman 1957 ; knauer 1966 ) of rotating , non - neutral plasmas in a uniform magnetic field for cases where the plasma is annular with both inner and outer radii so that there are two edge waves .",
    "the rossby wave instability occurs because of the local wave trapping in a disc .",
    "it is related to the papaloizou and pringle ( 1984 , 1985 ) instability where the wave is trapped between the inner and outer radii of a disc or torus .",
    "two - dimensional hydrodynamic simulations of the rwi instability in discs have been done by many groups beginning with li ( 2001 ) .",
    "figure [ fig3 ] from li ( 2001 ) shows an example of the @xmath39 vortices formed by the rwi .",
    "three - dimensional simulations of the instability have been done by meheut ( 2010 , 2012a ) .",
    "the behavior of the rossby wave instability is not dramatically altered in going from the 2d to 3d hydrodynamics . in 3d",
    "there are vertical ( @xmath40 ) motions associated with the vorticies , but the magnitudes of the vertical velocities are small compared with the horizontal perturbation velocities .",
    "earlier 3d simulations of vortices in stratified proto - planetary discs by barranco and marcus ( 2005 ) gave a more complicated picture of the vortex dynamics .",
    "the theory of the instability in three dimensions has been developed by meheut ( 2012b ) and lin ( 2012 ) .",
    "a useful set of references can be found in the proceedings of a recent meeting on vorticies and dust dynamics in proto - planetary discs edited by barge and jorda ( 2013 ) .",
    "barge and sommeria ( 1995 ) first pointed out that anticyclonic vortices in an accretion disc can act to concentrate dust particles in the flow and that this would facilitate the formation of planetesimals .",
    "this subject has been further developed in many subsequent papers ( e.g. , tanga 1996 ; bracco 1999 ; godon and livio 2000 ; johanssen 2004 ; heng and kenyon 2010 ) .",
    "a qualitative explanation is simple .",
    "first note that in an axisymmetric proto - stellar disc the radial force balance for the gas component is @xmath41 , where @xmath42 is gas velocity , @xmath43 is its pressure , @xmath44 is its density , and @xmath7 is the mass of the central star . the pressure gradient term can be estimated as @xmath45 , with @xmath46 the sound speed of the gas . thus the gas velocity is slightly sub - keplerian , @xmath47 $ ] , where @xmath48 is the keplerian velocity and @xmath49 for proto - stellar discs ( where typical value is @xmath50 ) . on the other hand the dust component of the proto - stellar disc",
    "is not affected by a pressure gradient and consequently the dust velocity is keplerian @xmath51 .",
    "the dust particles move slightly faster than the gas and consequently lose angular momentum by the drag from their motion through the gas .",
    "dust particles of sizes @xmath52 cm inspiral to the proto - star faster than the gas for commonly assumed disc viscosities . a rigorous 3d analysis of the dust motion in axisymmetric discs is given by takeuchi and lin ( 2002 ) .",
    "consider a vortex of small radial and azimuthal extent formed by some process in a disc as sketched in figure [ fig4 ] .",
    "it has velocity perturbation @xmath53 and pressure perturbation @xmath54 . in a reference frame rotating with angular rate @xmath55",
    ", the flow approximately satisfies the geostropic equation @xmath56 , which is a balance of the pressure gradient and coriolis forces .",
    "an _ anticyclonic vortex _",
    ", with vorticity @xmath57 oppositely directed to @xmath58 , has a maximum of @xmath54 at the vortex center .",
    "( a cyclonic vortex has a pressure minimum at its center . ) a dust particle in the outer part of the vortex moves faster than the gas and drifts radially inward .",
    "on the other hand a dust particle in the inner part may move slower than the gas with the result that it drifts radially outward . for dust",
    "trapping the vortex must be strong enough for the radial pressure gradient to be positive for an interval inside @xmath0 .",
    "this gives the condition @xmath59 , which is readily satisfied by the vortices arising from the rwi .",
    "dust trapping in vorticies in 3d disc simulations has been studied by modeling the dust component as a separate pressureless fluid coupled to the gas by collisions ( meheut 2012c ) for dust particle sizes of @xmath60 cm .",
    "the dust to gas mass fraction , initially @xmath61 , was found to increase by a factor of order @xmath62 in the centers of the vortices ( meheut 2012c ) . at this mass",
    "fraction the dust has a significant back reaction on the gas dynamics .",
    "a bump in @xmath12 or @xmath63 may arise at the radial boundaries of the `` dead zone '' ( varnire and tagger 2006 ; lyra 2009 ; crespe 2011 ) .",
    "this zone can arise from the suppression of the magneto - rotational instability ( mri , balbus and hawley 1991 ) by low ionization inside the disc ( gammie 1996 ) .",
    "the mri is a small length - scale instability of conducting keplerian discs in the presence of a weak magnetic field where the magnetic pressure is less than the thermal pressure in the disc .",
    "the instability is found to give rise to magnetic turbulence with length - scales of the order of the disc thickness . in turn",
    "this turbulence provides an effective viscosity which is commonly thought to cause the accretion of matter and the outward transport of angular momentum in astrophysical discs ( balbus and hawley 1991 ) .",
    "note however the possibility that the turbulent viscosity arises in hydrodynamic ( non - magnetized ) discs owing to the nonlinear instability in the very large reynolds number , rayleigh - stable keplerian discs ( specific angular momentum increasing outward ) ( paoletti 2012 ; bisnovatyi - kogan and lovelace 2001 ; zeldovitch 1981 ) .",
    "the bump in @xmath12 can give rise to exponential growth of non - axisymmetric perturbations in the vicinity of @xmath0 consisting of _ anticyclonic _ vortices .",
    "in most studies the dead zone has been modeled as radial interval of the disc with a significantly reduced turbulent viscosity compared with the outer and inner parts of the disc .",
    "this is due to the reduced action of the mri .",
    "however , recently , lyra and mac low ( 2012 ) carried out global 3d magneto - hydrodynamic ( mhd ) simulations of the full problem by modeling the dead zone as a region of the disc with significantly lower resistivity .",
    "they find that the rwi develops on the inner edge of the dead zone .",
    "the interactions of a planet with a proto - stellar disc has been studied theoretically and with 2d and 3d hydrodynamic simulations by many authors primarily because of its importance to planet migration , that is , the slow inward or outward radial motion of the planet due to transfer of angular momentum between the planet and the disc .",
    "the dependence of the migration rate and the influence of a planet on the disc ( e.g. , the formation of a gap in the disc ) depends of course on the planet s mass , and it was thought that the formation of a gap in the disc occurs only for planets more massive than about one - tenth of jupiter s mass ( lin and papaloizou 1993 ) .",
    "but the gap formation is sensitive also to the nonlinear steepening and shock formation of the spiral density waves generated by the planet ( rafikov 2002 ) as well as the turbulent viscosity of the disc which damps the density waves ( li 2009 ) . for sufficiently low viscosities ,",
    "the shocks formed by the spiral density waves at the gap edges give rise to maxima in the inverse vortensity @xmath12 ( koller 2003 ; li 2005 ; de val - borro 2007 ; lin and papaloizzou 2010 ) .",
    "this triggers the rossby wave instability . starting from axisymmetric conditions",
    "the simulations show the growth and saturation of several vortices ( @xmath64 ) which later merge to form a single vortex .",
    "recent high resolution 3d hydrodynamic simulations by zhu ( 2014 ) indicate that a gap may be formed over a sufficiently long period for @xmath65 larger than ten times the earth mass . in this work",
    "the gas component of the disc was modeled with the grid based code _",
    "athena _ , and the dust component with lagrangian particles for a wide range of dust particle sizes ( @xmath66 cm ) .",
    "the dust surface mass density in the rossby vorticies is found to increase by a factor of @xmath62 for dust particles with @xmath67 , where @xmath68 is the keplerian rotation rate of the disc at @xmath0 , and @xmath69 is the stopping time of the dust particle motion through the gas ( proportional to the particle s radius ) ( zhu 2014 ) .",
    "note that in the work of meheut ( 2012c ) , where the dust component was treated as a separate fluid , a comparable increase in the dust density was found .",
    "analytic solutions for the dust distribution in disc vortices have been developed by birnstiel ( 2013 ) and lyra and lin ( 2013 ) .",
    "recent observations by van der marel ( 2013 ) of the disc around the star ophiuchus irs 48 with the atacama large millimeter array ( alma ) have revealed a high - contrast crescent - shaped emission region in the @xmath70 mm wavelength from one side of the star indicating a concentration in this region of millimeter size dust grains .",
    "the contrast ratio between the peak emission and the opposite side of the disc is @xmath71 . at the same time observations at different wavelengths",
    "indicate that both the gas and the micrometer - sized dust is distributed uniformly in the disc around the star ( van der merel 2013 ) .",
    "the asymmetric dust emission of oph irs 48 is modeled as a single anticyclonic rossby vortex ( @xmath72 ) excited at the outer gap edge of a @xmath73 jupiter mass planet orbiting the star at @xmath74 au ( au is the sun - earth distance , @xmath75 cm ) ( van der marel 2013 ) . the center of the vortex or dust trap is estimated as @xmath76 au and it is on the line through the planet and star .",
    "starting from axisymmetric conditions , a bump in @xmath12 of amplitude larger than a critical value will lead to the exponential growth of a rossby wave for a particular azimuthal mode number ( typically , @xmath77 ) ( lovelace 1999 ) .",
    "the exponential growth is predicted to cease at the time when the circulation or trapping time of a fluid particle in one of the vortices , @xmath78 , is of the order of the growth - time of the instability , @xmath79 ( lovelace 2009 ) .",
    "this is because the axisymmetric fluid motion assumed in the instability calculation ( lovelace 1999 ) is inapplicable for times @xmath80 .",
    "an analogous saturation conditions is well - known in plasma physics where it was first used to explain the saturation of the two - stream instability ( oneil 1965 ; krall and trivelpiece 1973 ) . a systematic study of the rossby wave saturation with 2d and a sample 3d hydrodynamic simulations finds that the exponential growth saturates when @xmath81 with @xmath82 where @xmath83 is the vorticity of the rossby vortex ( meheut 2013 ) .",
    "the saturation is found to occur in about @xmath84 orbital periods at the radius of the bump ( meheut 2013 ) .",
    "an axisymmetric bump in the inverse vortensity @xmath12 may be maintained at the edge of a disc s dead zone or at the edges of a gap formed in the disc by a planet .",
    "the maintenance of the bump can allow the continuous driving of the rossby vortices for the lifetime of the disc . in the absence of a mechanism for maintaining the bump ,",
    "long - time 3d hydrodynamic simulations show that that the rossby vortices persist for times of the order of @xmath62 orbital periods at the radius of the bump ( meheut 2012a ) . for longer times",
    "the bump in @xmath10 is spread out in radius and reduced in amplitude below the instability threshold .",
    "the vortices do not show measurable radial migration .",
    "the long - time simulations show that an initial multiple vortex pattern ( @xmath64 ) evolves by vortex merging to give a single vortex ( @xmath72 ) ( meheut 2012a ) .",
    "a detailed theoretical analysis of the stability of a single elliptical kida vortex model ( 1981 ) has been carried out by leseur and papaloizou ( 2009 ) with the result such vortices are unstable except for azimuthally elongated vortices which have azimuthal half - widths ( @xmath85 ) longer than @xmath86 times the radial half - width ( @xmath87 ) but with this ratio less than @xmath88 .",
    "the influence of a large - scale magnetic field on the rossby wave instability has been investigated by tagger and collaborators ( tagger and pellat 1999 ; tagger and varnire 2006 ; tagger and melia 2006 ) and others ( yu and li 2009 ; yu and lai 2013 ) .",
    "strong , kilo - gauss , dipole and higher multipole moment magnetic fields are observed in proto - stars ( e.g. , yang and johns - krull 2011 ) .",
    "the stellar magnetic field penetrates the proto - stellar disc to different radial extents depending mainly on the stellar field strength and the disc accretion rate ( lii 2012 ) .",
    "this large - scale field in the inner disc can drive the high velocity jets observed owing to the gradient of the wound - up toroidal magnetic fields ( lii 2012 ) . at the same time",
    "the toroidal magnetic field collimates the jet .",
    "large - scale magnetic fields are also thought to be responsible for the relativistic jets observed to come from accretion discs around black holes ranging from stellar mass to supermassive ( @xmath89 solar mass ) . in the presence of a large - scale , vertical magnetic field @xmath90 , tagger and",
    "collaborators find that the inverse vortensity of equation ( 1 ) may be superceded by the quantity @xmath91 depending on the value of @xmath92 .",
    "a distinguishing aspect of the magnetic rwi is the prediction of the outflow of energy and angular momentum via alfvn waves from the vortices into the disc s corona ( tagger and pellat 1999 ; tagger and varnire 2006 ) .",
    "the outflows from the rotating vortices could explain the quasi - periodic oscillations ( qpos ) observed in the x - ray emissions of low - mass x - ray binaries ( van der klis 2006 ) .",
    "a further promising application of the magnetic rwi is to modeling the quasi - periodic ( @xmath93 min . ) near infra - red and x - ray emission from material orbiting the super massive black hole sagittarius a@xmath94 ( @xmath95 solar masses ) in the center of our galaxy ( tagger and melia 2006 ) .",
    "the authors propose that low angular momentum clouds episodically fall into the vicinity of the black hole and the gas becomes trapped and circularized by viscosity at @xmath96 schwartzchild radii ( @xmath97 cm ) from the black hole .",
    "this event would naturally produce a pronounced bump in the disc surface density and @xmath12 , strong rossby wave growth at the trapping radius , and magnetically driven outflows with a quasi - period similar to that observed .",
    "note that vincent ( 2013 ) find quasi - periodic oscillations in the thermal emission from the inner regions of _ non - magnetized _ discs around black holes .",
    "they find the rwi in from 2d and 3d simulations using the _ amrvac _ code .",
    "a different type of rossby wave instability was found by lovelace ( 2009 ) in the strongly non - keplerian magnetized region of a disk where @xmath98 .",
    "for a keplerian disc , @xmath99 .",
    "this region occurs when an accretion disc encounters the magnetosphere of a slowly rotating star ( romanova 2008 ) .",
    "this rossby mode was proposed as an explanation ( lovelace 2009 ) of the observed twin kilo - hertz qpos ( van der klis 2006 ) .",
    "evidence for the occurrence of this rossby mode with @xmath100 and @xmath101 has been found in the power spectral density plots of the global 3d mhd simulations of waves in discs around rotating magnetized stars with misaligned dipole magnetic fields using the _ cubed sphere _",
    "code ( romanova 2013 ) .",
    "the self - gravity of disc can have an important influence on the rossby wave instability in proto - planetary discs , black hole discs , as well as disc galaxies .",
    "the rwi , earlier termed the `` negative mass instability '' ( lovelace and hohlfeld 1978 ) , was in fact developed for spiral or disc galaxies which are self - gravitating systems of stars and gas .",
    "the rotation curves the disc galaxies are _ not _ keplerian , but `` flat '' because they have @xmath102 const for a large range of radial distances outside their central nuclear regions . for disc galaxies @xmath103 ( lovelace and hohlfeld 1978 ) , where @xmath32 is the radial epicyclic angular frequency given below equation 3 .",
    "the rwi in disc galaxies consisting predominanly of stars has been observed and studied in many different cases using @xmath104body simulations ( sellwood and kahn 1991 ; sellwood 2012 ; sellwood 2013 ) . only a small bump or depression in @xmath12 leads to the growth of a global disc mode ( sellwood 2013 ) . when the self - gravity of the disc is strong , the rwi is observed to occur at radii where @xmath10 is a _",
    "minimum _ rather than a maximum ( sellwood and kahn 1991 ; sellwood 2012 , 2013 ) as predicted by lovelace and hohlfeld ( 1978 ) .    in proto - stellar discs ,",
    "the influence of the self - gravity of the gas and dust on vortices generated by giant jupiter - mass scale planets have been studied in several recent simulation studies ( lyra 2009 ; lin and papaloizou 2011 ) .",
    "lyra ( 2009 ) use a thin disc , 2d model for the gas and dust with the gas described by hydrodynamic equations and the dust described by a large number of lagrangian particles ( typically @xmath105 ) using the _ pencil _ code .",
    "the dust and gas are coupled by an analytic drag force model which allows for a wide range of particle sizes and gas conditions .",
    "the self - gravity is calculated using a fourier transform method .",
    "significant dust accumulation is found to occur at the lagrange points of the planet as well as in the vortices generated at the edges of the planet induced gap in the disc .",
    "the analysis of lin and papaloizou ( 2011 ) is also for thin discs using analytic methods and 2d hydrodynamic simulations with the _ fargo _ code .",
    "the vortices studied were those arising from the planet induced bumps in @xmath12 at the gap edges . the analytic theory and",
    "simulations show that the rossby instability is stabilized for low mode numbers ( @xmath106 ) as the disc mass is increased .",
    "a simpler problem is treated by lovelace and hohlfeld ( 2013 ) where an analytic calculation is made of the stability of a bump or depression in @xmath12 in a thin keplerian disc in the absence of planets .",
    "the results are in agreement with lovelace and hohlfeld ( 1978 ) .",
    "the key quantities determining the stability / instability are found to be : ( 1 ) the parameters of the bump ( or depression ) in the disc surface density .",
    "( 2 ) the toomre @xmath107 parameter of the disc with @xmath31 is the sound speed in the disc ( toomre 1964 ; safronov 1960 ) where a non - self - gravitating disc has @xmath108 . and , ( 3 ) the dimensionless azimuthal wavenumber of the perturbation @xmath109 , where @xmath110 is the half - thickness of the disc . for discs stable to axisymmetric perturbations ( @xmath111 )",
    ", the self - gravity has a significant role for @xmath112 or @xmath113 ; instability may occur for a depression or groove in the surface density if @xmath114 .",
    "for @xmath115 the self - gravity is not important , and instability may occur at a bump in the surface density .",
    "thus , for all mode numbers @xmath116 , the self - gravity is unimportant for @xmath117 .",
    "this review does not consider the instability of self - gravitating gas discs for conditions where the gas cooling is important ( gammie 2001 ) .",
    "recent research on vortices in astrophysical discs is evolving particularly rapidly owing to the completion of the alma infra - red telescope array which allows for the first time the mapping of the distribution of gas and dust grains in the discs of nearby proto - planetary systems .",
    "observations by van der marel ( 2013 ) with alma of a crescent shaped dust concentration in the disc of a proto - star is most simply interpreted as a large mass of dust trapped in the high pressure region of an anticyclonic vortex . at the same time",
    "increasingly sophisticated codes have been developed for simulating the 3d flow of gas and dust in discs ( e.g. , zhu 2014 ) .",
