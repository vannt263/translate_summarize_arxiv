    "quantum zero - point fluctuations play an important role in the ferroelectric phenomena for a wide range of ferroelectric materials @xcite .",
    "some of the materials , such as srtio@xmath3 , show a displacive ( soft - mode ) phase transition , while others are of the order - disorder type , for example the hydrogen - bond kh@xmath1po@xmath4 .",
    "therefore , from the fundamental point of view , one should answer the two questions to characterize each material : ( i ) what is the interplay of quantum ( zero - point ) and classical ( thermal ) fluctuations and ( ii ) how close the transition is to the order - disorder or displacive scenarios . working with model hamiltonians , it is suitable to consider the quantum discrete @xmath5 model here .",
    "the variation of the model parameters allows to go continuously from the displacive to the order - disorder second - order transition .",
    "an introduction of a finite mass and plank constant gives rise to the zero - point fluctuations in the model .",
    "although the discrete @xmath5 lattice is one of the simplest possible microscopic models for the phase - transition phenomena , the studies have been restricted to the asymptotical cases so far . in the general case",
    "the transition type is neither purely displacive nor order - disorder and ( or ) fluctuations are neither purely quantum nor thermal . up to our knowledge , there is no a quantitative investigation of this situation so far .",
    "moreover the exact values of the model parameters are not clear , than the known asymptotical cases realize .",
    "this paper is aimed , in particular , to solve the latter problem .",
    "let us write down the explicit formulae and discuss the known asymptotical behaviour .",
    "the discrete @xmath5 model is a cubic lattice of 2 - 4 anharmonic oscillators , with a nearest - neighbour harmonic coupling .",
    "the hamiltonian can be written as follows @xcite : @xmath6 here @xmath7 is the displacement of the @xmath8-th atom in the unit cell , @xmath9 are parameters of the model .",
    "the first two terms in the potential energy @xmath10 form a double - well potential and the last term stands for the interaction .",
    "there is only the inteaction between nearest - neighbours in the model , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath11 if @xmath12 are the nearest neighbours and vanishes elsewhere . note that the hamiltonian ( 1 ) includes the displacement of atoms , but not the actual distance between them .",
    "if there were no any fluctuations in the system , all atoms would occupy the same position in the cell @xmath13 ( or @xmath14 ) .",
    "there are two sources of fluctuations .",
    "the dimensionless mass @xmath15 determines the role of quantum zero - point fluctuations in the model ( the system is classical at @xmath16 ) .",
    "the classical thermal fluctuations are governed by the reduced temperature @xmath17 ( the system becomes purely quantum at @xmath18 ) .",
    "large fluctuations can destroy the ordering , so that the average of @xmath19 vanishes .",
    "the system of a dimensionality @xmath20 shows a second - order transition for any positive @xmath21 .",
    "the parameter @xmath22 determines the type of the transition : displacive transition corresponds to @xmath23 , while the limit @xmath24 corresponds to the order - disorder system @xcite . at a given @xmath25",
    "there is a critical line @xmath26 in the @xmath27 phase diagram ( hereafter the subscript `` c '' stands for the critical values of temperature and mass ) .    in the reduced dimensionless variables ,",
    "the hamiltonian takes the form @xmath28    the asymptotical cases are studied extensively",
    ". basically , they are the follows .    at the limit @xmath29 the transition is of the soft - mode type .",
    "this asymptotic is studied at @xmath18 , as well as at finite temperature @xcite .",
    "since the double - well potential is small for this case , it can be treated as a perturbation .",
    "therefore a convenient method of the investigation of this limit is the independent - mode approach @xcite .",
    "the system is harmonic in the zero approximation , therefore the phonon vibrations @xmath30 can be treated as uncoupled oscillators so that one assumes @xmath31 ( hereafter the triangle brackets stand for the averaging over thermal and quantum fluctuations ) . in the first approximation",
    "the anharmonic term renormalize the phonon dispersion .",
    "virtually , the real interaction can be reduced to an effective ( _ i.e. _ dependent on the temperature and mass ) harmonic one . at certain values of @xmath32 and",
    "@xmath33 the zero - frequency mode ( soft - mode ) appears in the system indicating the phase transition .",
    "the independent - mode approach is exact in the @xmath29 limit .",
    "however , serious difficulties appear for a finite @xmath25 ; particularly , @xmath34 and @xmath35 are incorrectly predicted to be independent on @xmath25 in the independent - mode scheme .    at the opposite limit @xmath24 , the discrete @xmath5 model shows an order - disorder phase transition . the physical picture in this case is the follows . since an on - site",
    "potential is much larger than all other energy scales , atoms are localized in either left or in the right side of the double - well in the zero approximation : @xmath36 .",
    "therefore , each oscillator can be treated as a two - level system .",
    "the tunnel coupling between the two sides of a well produces some energy splitting @xmath37 , which depends on the mass @xmath33 implicitly .",
    "this case coincides with the transverse - field ising model @xcite .",
    "this model describes an array of @xmath38-spin particles in the external field with a nearest - neighbour interaction between particles .",
    "the hamiltonian of this model is @xmath39 where @xmath40 , @xmath41 are @xmath42 spin operators .",
    "the phase transition can be observed by changing the two parameters : temperature @xmath32 and transverse field @xmath37 .",
    "the transverse - field ising model is also widely studied at @xmath18 and at finite temperature by various approximations .",
    "high - temperature series expansions , ground - state perturbation theory , correlated - basis - function analysis , random phase approximation and its generalizations , @xmath43 and @xmath44 expansions , continuum field theory methods have been used @xcite .",
    "the classical case corresponds to the condition @xmath45 . in this case",
    "the momentum - coordinate uncertainty is small , so that the partition function can be factorised as @xmath46 .",
    "the temperature dependence of the order parameter is determined here by the second term and is therefore independent of mass @xmath33 . the dependence @xmath47",
    "is studied both numerically and by analytical approaches for 2d , layered and 3d systems @xcite .",
    "an extension of the mean - field scheme has been developed , which is appropriate for the description of monte carlo results with a good accuracy in a wide rage of parameter @xmath25 .",
    "the quantum limit takes place at @xmath18 and at finite mass @xmath33 . the dependence @xmath48 is studied @xcite by quantum monte carlo simulations and the simplest analytics for a wide range of @xmath25 .    in this paper",
    ", we study the phase diagram of the quantum discrete @xmath5 model for a full range of parameters , and determine the domain of applicability for the asymptotical results mentioned above .",
    "we also consider the leading - order quantum correction to the classical result . in a conclusive part of the paper",
    "the parameters of several ferroelectric materials are placed in the phase diagram obtained .",
    "we chose the mean - field ( mf ) approximation for the study because of its simplicity .",
    "actually , we are interested in quite crude characteristics such as the domains of applicability .",
    "therefore we believe that this method is suitable here , although it is not very accurate .",
    "the validity of the mf approach is discussed in more details in the end of the paper .",
    "in the mf approach , the real interaction between particles is replaced with an interaction of the on - site oscillator with an external field @xmath49 .",
    "the self - consistent set of mf equations for @xmath50 is formed by this formula and the expression for the average displacement of the on - site oscillator @xcite @xmath51 where @xmath52 in this paper , we are interested in the position of the transition point in phase diagram",
    ". the condition @xmath53 is fulfilled in the point of the phase transition . keeping the leading - order in @xmath50 terms , one obtains the mf equations for the critical point : @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the static linear susceptibility , which is determined at the finite temperature by the standard quantum - mechanical formula @xcite : @xmath56 here",
    ", @xmath57 is the free energy ( @xmath58 is a partition function ) , @xmath59 and @xmath60 are respectively the eigenenergies and the dipole matrix elements for the on - site hamiltonian @xmath61 , defined in eq .",
    "( [ h0 ] ) .",
    "let us briefly discuss the structure of the spectrum . in the displacive limit @xmath62 it is almost equidistant , because the nonlinearity of the potential is small . in the order - disorder case of @xmath63",
    "the situation is quite different .",
    "there are several doublets of the lowest levels , whereas the rest of the spectrum is situated much higher ( fig .",
    "a number of doublets increases with an increase of @xmath33 , since the system becomes more classical and the spectrum becomes almost continuous . at the same time , the behaviour of the system is determined by the first doublet at low and moderate masses .",
    "this is the case of the transverse - field ising model ( 3 ) .",
    "the spectrum and matrix elements of the on - site oscillator ( [ h0 ] ) were calculated numerically . here",
    "are some details of the numerical procedure .",
    "the eigenfunctions of the schrdinger equation with @xmath64 were found by the phase method @xcite .",
    "we controlled the accuracy of calculations by the check of the condition @xmath65 , which was fulfilled with an error bar not exceeding @xmath66 .",
    "we used approximately 50 - 70 levels of @xmath64 to obtain the phase diagrams @xmath67 in the quantum mf approach at moderate values of @xmath25 and for @xmath68 .",
    "this amount is necessary to describe correctly the case of large mass , than the levels are quite dense .",
    "the number of necessary levels is increased with an increase of @xmath32 as well .",
    "the phase diagrams are obtained for a wide range of the parameter @xmath25 .",
    "they correspond to the displacive limit , order - disorder limit and to an intermediate case .",
    "the dependencies @xmath67 are plotted in fig . 2 by solid lines for the three values of the parameter @xmath25 for 2d and 3d lattices .",
    "all curves show a good agreement with the known asymptotes for the quantum limit ( @xmath18 ) and for the classical case ( @xmath69 ) @xcite .",
    "now we turn to the discussion of the domains of applicability for the four mentioned asymptotical cases : displacive , order - disorder , classical and quantum limits . in the displacive limit ,",
    "the mf scheme suffers serious difficulties ( see discussion in the end of the paper ) .",
    "however , from the previous studies of the classical @xcite and quantum @xcite systems , we can estimate that the displacive limit occurs at @xmath25 smaller than @xmath70 .",
    "for the three other limits , we use the following scheme .",
    "we calculate the critical parameters by the mf expressions which are valid in the corresponding asymptotical cases , and compare them with the direct mf calculations . for each limit",
    "we determine the areas where the error bar does not exceed 1% and 5% .    for the quantum limit a deviation of @xmath35 from the value of @xmath71 is detected for each @xmath25 .",
    "the two areas , where @xmath35 differs from @xmath71 in a value smaller than 1% and 5% , respectively , are marked in fig.2 .",
    "to determine the areas , where the system can be considered as classical , we compare @xmath26 with the classical value @xmath72 , at a given value of @xmath25 .",
    "the obtained areas , where the classical result delivers a 1% and 5% accuracy , are shown in fig.3 .",
    "for comparison , we also present the `` purely quantum '' mf dependence of @xmath48 at @xmath18 in the same figure .",
    "finally , the domain of applicability of the order - disorder limit is estimated from the comparison of the dependencies @xmath67 , obtained from the calculation by ( [ chi ] ) with a complete set of eigenfunctions , and with only the first doublet in the spectrum .",
    "the result is shown in fig.3 .",
    "thus , the values of the parameter @xmath25 , which are used to plot the curves in fig.2 , cover a complete range of phase transitions from the displacive type for small values of @xmath25 , to the order - disorder one for large values of @xmath25 .",
    "besides , the presented intervals of @xmath33 and @xmath32 ( figs.2,3 ) show a crossover between quantum and classical phase transitions for the discrete @xmath0 model .",
    "we have also plotted the leading - order quantum correction to the classical mf value .",
    "the idea is to use usual classical mf scheme , which takes into account quantum fluctuations in the system .",
    "it can be obtained in feynman s consideration of the path - integrate representation for the partition function @xcite .",
    "the partition function of the on - site oscillator @xmath73 in this representation can be written as follows : @xmath74 \\exp\\left(\\hbar^{-1}\\int_{0}^{\\frac{\\hbar}{t } } l(x(\\tau ) ) d\\tau\\right),\\ ] ] where the integration is taken over all classical trajectories @xmath75 , describing the propagation in the imaginary time @xmath76 with periodic boundary conditions applied .",
    "@xmath77 is a lagrangian along the trajectory @xmath75 .",
    "the semi - classical approximation consists in the assumption that the deviations of the trajectory from its mean position @xmath78 are small .",
    "one should perform a taylor - series expansion of ( [ feynman ] ) in powers of @xmath79 and keep the terms up to @xmath80 . after this , @xmath81 can be integrated out , yielding @xmath82 here @xmath83 is a factor , independent of @xmath84 .",
    "thus , in this semi - classical approximation we can consider a quantum system using its classical potential with quantum correction @xcite : @xmath85 virtually , quantum correction renormalises the on - site potential parameters making them dependent on temperature .",
    "the results obtained from the classical mf theory with the quantum correction ( [ qcorr ] ) are presented in fig.2 by the dashed lines .",
    "all curves demonstrate an excellent agreement with ones obtained directly from the quantum mf calculations ( [ mf ] ) .",
    "certainly , the approach ( [ qcorr ] ) does not work at low @xmath32 and @xmath33 at all . in our case of discrete @xmath0 model",
    "we can calculate the phase diagrams in this way down to the mass @xmath86 .",
    "nevertheless , the area where the semi - classical approximation works is large enough to demonstrate a crossover between the quantum and classical phase transitions .",
    "we would like also to stress that the calculation via the quantum - mechanical formula ( [ mf ] ) is about @xmath87 times longer than the classical mf method with the quantum correction ( [ qcorr ] ) .",
    "the estimation of the parameters @xmath33 and @xmath25 of the discrete @xmath88 model for real materials and their accordance to the limit cases on the phase diagram @xmath48 ( fig.3 ) is of interest .",
    "we will discuss a situation with the following ferroelectrics : sn@xmath1p@xmath1s@xmath2 , srtio@xmath3 , kh@xmath1po@xmath4 ( kdp ) .    the transition in sn@xmath1p@xmath1s@xmath2 is of an intermediate type @xcite .",
    "therefore , there are thermal regions in phase diagrams , where landau theory is valid , _",
    "i.e. _ the free energy is of the form : @xmath89 , with @xmath90 , @xmath91 . in our estimations for sn@xmath1p@xmath1s@xmath2",
    ", we use the data for the curie low and the value of the saturated spontaneous polarization to obtain values of coefficients @xmath92 and @xmath93 @xcite . the following estimation for the parameters @xmath33 and @xmath25",
    "can be suggested ( for an estimation of @xmath25 , our method is very similar to what was used in @xcite ) .",
    "the following relation can be easily obtained : @xmath94 ( @xmath95 is a volume of the unit cell ) .",
    "also , accordingly to the phase diagram for the classical discrete @xmath5 model @xcite , one has @xmath96 , with @xmath97 for an intermediate type of the transition . from these two relations",
    "one can guess about the ratio @xmath98 .",
    "a suitable estimation for the parameter @xmath15 comes from the observation that the mean - square of the displacement @xmath99 is known from the experiment @xcite . combining this with the two previous formulae , we obtain @xmath100 .",
    "the values @xmath92 , @xmath93 , @xmath95 , @xmath101 and @xmath102 obtained from the experimental data @xcite , as well as our estimations for @xmath33 and @xmath25 are presented in table 1 .",
    "we also use the same method in estimations for srtio@xmath3 , which is a displacive - type material @xcite . however , there are some special issues in this case .",
    "an ordering in srtio@xmath3 is absent due to the quantum effects .",
    "the dependencies @xmath103 and @xmath104 are landau - like only at temperature down to approximately 50 k ; at lower temperature they are saturated .",
    "therefore , in our estimations we use the experimental data @xcite for @xmath105 for @xmath106 .",
    "we approximate these data by the landau - like dependencies @xmath107 , @xmath108 , i.e. assuming a `` classical '' picture of the phase transition .",
    "we extrapolate these `` classical '' dependencies down to @xmath109 , and obtain the `` classical '' critical temperature , and @xmath110 from this extrapolation .",
    "if the system were purely classical , @xmath110 and @xmath111 would take these values .",
    "the extracted data are presented in table 1 .",
    "since the displacive phase transition takes place in srtio@xmath3 we use the estimation for @xmath112 as @xmath113 , according to the previous study of the 3d discrete @xmath0 model @xcite .",
    "all other values required for estimations of @xmath25 and @xmath33 are known from the literature @xcite and are placed in table 1 as well .",
    "the corresponding points for sn@xmath1p@xmath1s@xmath2 and srtio@xmath3 lie in the phase diagram ( fig.3 ) in the classical and quantum areas , with the intermediate and displacive types of the transitions , respectively .",
    "these data correspond to the experimental observations @xcite .",
    "however , the landau theory is hardly applicable even qualitatively in the case of kdp due to the order - disorder phase transition of the essentially quantum nature ( the transverse - field ising model is quite suitable here ) .",
    "we make use of the following method of the estimation of parameters .",
    "the splitting of the first doublet of the on - site oscillator spectrum @xcite is known to be about @xmath114 k , while the third level lies on the distance of approximately @xmath115 k from the first one .",
    "further , we take into account the value for @xmath116 k. given these data , we adjust @xmath25 and @xmath35 to deliver the known values of @xmath117 and @xmath118 .",
    "this estimation gives us @xmath119 and @xmath120 .",
    "thus , the point for kdp disposes in the quantum area of the phase diagram ( fig.3 ) and corresponds to an order - disorder transition .",
    "thus , our estimations place the three mentioned materials to the asymptotical cases they are commonly attributed to .",
    "now we discuss how the points can move on the phase diagram .",
    "the most direct way is to change the isotope mass of the proper components .",
    "an elegant example is the restoration of the ordering via the change from @xmath121o to @xmath122o in srtio@xmath3 @xcite .",
    "the transition temperature happens to be about 23 k in this case , while the `` classical estimation '' for @xmath111 ( placed in table 1 ) is approximately two times larger .",
    "this corresponds well with our data : at small @xmath25 a 5 - 7 % change in @xmath33 can increase the transition temperature from 0 to @xmath123 , while the `` classical '' asymptote is @xmath124 ( see fig.2 ) .",
    "clearly , however , the `` isotopic '' change in @xmath33 can not be large .",
    "finally , we discuss the applicability of the mf method for the present problem .",
    "as the mf scheme ignores correlation effects in the system , it overestimates the transition temperature ( or underestimates the critical mass ) .",
    "this overestimation is particularly large for the displacive limit .",
    "namely , the mf approach predicts a finite value of @xmath125 in any dimension , whereas actually fluctuations result in @xmath126 in 2d at finite temperature @xcite .",
    "however , for the moderate and large values of @xmath25 in 2d , as well as for the whole range of @xmath25 in 3d , we expect that the qualitative behaviour of @xmath47 and @xmath48 is reproduced correctly .",
    "quantitatively , it is known that the mf scheme overestimates @xmath34 @xcite or underestimates @xmath35 @xcite by some 30 - 50 % .",
    "we expect that the similar situation takes place for the general case , then both thermal and quantum fluctuations are present . to get more justification ,",
    "we have now started the quantum monte carlo simulations for the system under consideration @xcite . the pilot calculations support the qualitative validity of the mf results .",
