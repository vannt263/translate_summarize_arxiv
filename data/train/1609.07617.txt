    "results from nasa s @xmath2 mission have revealed an abundance of planets smaller than 2 @xmath13 with orbital periods less than 100 days @xcite .",
    "although only a few of those planets have measured masses , and therefore densities , those measurements have started to unveil an interesting picture . below a radius of about 1.6 @xmath13",
    "most planets are consistent with bare rocky compositions without any significant volatile envelopes @xcite . moreover ,",
    "when considering only planets with masses measured with precisions better than 20@xmath14 via radial velocities , planets with masses smaller than about 6 @xmath6 appear to be rocky and have interiors composed mostly of iron and magnesium silicates in earth - like abundances ( 26@xmath14 fe , 74@xmath14 @xmath15 , on average , based on * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , while planets more massive than about 7 @xmath6 show a wider range of densities @xcite .",
    "such a dichotomy suggests the possible existence of mechanisms by which planets more massive than approximately 7 @xmath6 in orbits of only a few days can retain significant volatile envelopes , while less massive planets lose all the material in their outer layers to a combination of the effect of stellar winds and atmospheric escape .    however , despite the rapid observational progress on the determination of fundamental properties of low mass planets , some basic questions about the origin of this short - period rocky planet population are still not understood .",
    "almost all of the confirmed rocky planets are on highly irradiated orbits , where they are bombarded by large amounts of ionizing euv and x - ray radiation , which can drive a photo - evaporative wind from the atmosphere of the planet and over a planet s lifetime can remove a significant amount of mass from planets with volatiles envelopes ( e.  g. * ? ? ?",
    "several recent studies have shown that kepler s short - period super - earths and sub - neptunes have likely been significantly sculpted by photo - evaporation ( e.  g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , or else by some other comparable process like atmospheric erosion by impacts ( e.  g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "thus , while it is possible that the short - period rocky planets simply formed with their current earth - like compositions , their low masses and highly irradiated orbits mean that they could also be the remnant cores of volatile - rich hot neptunes which have lost their envelopes . even considering all these scenarios , it is not clear why a transition between bare cores and planets with significant volatiles would occur at 1.6 @xmath16 .",
    "for example , recent precise mass measurements of planets with masses between 3 and 8 @xmath6 and periods out to 17 days , via transit timing variations , reveal a wide range of densities for planets with masses near 56 @xmath6 , analogous to the situation for more massive planets @xcite .",
    "the recently discovered kepler-20b , with a mass of 9.7 @xmath6 , radius 1.9 @xmath16 , and a orbital period of 3.7 days appears to be a bare core @xcite .    with the current sample of small planets with precise mass measurements",
    "it is not possible to establish whether stellar irradiation is the cause of the bare core to volatile rich envelopes transition .",
    "it is also not possible to discern whether the transition is abrupt or smooth @xcite .",
    "we therefore need a larger number of precise mass measurements , especially around the apparent 1.6 @xmath16 transition region .",
    "in this paper we report a new mass determination for kepler-21b , a 5.1 @xmath3 1.7 @xmath6 super - earth located near the apparent mass boundary between predominately volatile - poor super earths and volatile - rich larger planets .",
    "kepler-21b orbits the brightest exoplanet host star discovered by @xmath2 ( hd 179070 , v = 8.25 ) , which is also a slightly evolved f6iv star",
    ". an earlier study of this planet by @xcite , based on the first six quarters of @xmath2 data ( q0q5 ) , found a planet radius of 1.6 @xmath3 0.04 @xmath16 , but could not determine the planetary mass because of the effect of the stellar variability on the radial velocity ( rv ) measurements .",
    "our mass measurement comes from new radial velocity data collected with harps - n between 2014 and 2015 , combined with the hires data from @xcite and fitted using gaussian processes regressions ( gps ) .",
    "in addition , we compute a new planetary radius from the complete @xmath2 q0-q17 light curves , detrended from stellar variability using new time series analysis techniques .",
    "we describe the light curve and radial velocity analyses in section 2 . in sections 3 and 4",
    ", we describe the light curve and radial velocity fits and their results .",
    "finally , we discuss our findings and summarize our conclusions in section 5 .",
    "kepler-21 was monitored with @xmath2 in 29.4 min , long cadence mode between quarters q0 and q17 , and in 58.9 sec , short cadence mode in quarters q2 and q5-q17 , covering a total time period of 1,470.5 days ( bjd 2454953.540  2456424.002 ) .",
    "we analyzed the full @xmath2 dataset using two different detrendings : data validation ( dv ) and principal component analysis ( pca ) .",
    "the results of both analyses are shown in figure  [ fig : samplelcs ] .",
    "the result of the dv analysis is the detrended flux time - series available in the dv report summaries @xcite as obtained from the nasa exoplanet archive s q1-q17 dr24 tce table . for this detrending ,",
    "as detailed in @xcite , an optimal photometric aperture is used to sum up the flux from the central pixels of the image and produce a time - series light curve .",
    "the pre - search data conditioning ( pdc ) module then removes systematic trends that are common to multiple stars on the detector .",
    "the resulting time - series is then run through a harmonic filter that identifies and removes sinusoidal trends in the data .",
    "finally , a median detrender is used to remove any remaining photometric variations at durations longer than the transit duration and normalize the data ( see * ? ? ? * for more details ) .    while the dv detrending produces a very clean light curve , any variations at timescales greater than the transit duration , such as the planet s phase curve or stellar variations due to rotation or pulsation ,",
    "are removed .",
    "this is due mainly to the harmonic filter and median detrender , which is selected to preserve features with timescales of the order of the transits .",
    "detailed inspection of the light curves also shows that the pdc module significantly suppresses sinusoidal - like astrophysical signals at 10 days , and completely removes them by 20 days @xcite .",
    "stellar rotation periods , which can be confused with an exoplanet s radial velocity signal , are usually in that same 1020 day period range ( see e.  g. * ? ? ? * ) , so it is important to preserve the stellar signal .",
    "therefore , we also employed a pca detrending @xcite , similar to that described in @xcite in the kepler pyke tools package ( http://keplergo.arc.nasa.gov/pyke.shtml ) ] . for the pca detrending , all available pixels in the image are summed up to produce a time - series light curve .",
    "a pca is then run on the pixel - level time - series data to obtain a series of basis vector components .",
    "these components correspond to the systematic trends belonging to the specific target being analyzed that arise due to motion on the detector , as well as instrumental variation and cosmic ray impacts .",
    "these basis vectors are removed from the time - series photometry , which is then normalized by simply dividing by the median flux level in each quarter .",
    "the advantage of this pca detrending is that it preserves the intrinsic photometric signals introduced by both the star and the planet , while removing systematic trends from the spacecraft and detector .",
    "although kepler-21 , at @xmath1 = 8.25 , is saturated on the detector , both detrendings include all the saturated pixels .",
    "since charge is conserved on the @xmath2 ccds to a very high degree , accurate differential photometry is achievable for saturated objects , as long as enough pixels are included to capture all the saturated regions and a significant amount of the star s point spread function @xcite .    ]",
    "we collected a total of 82 radial velocity ( rv ) observations of kepler-21 with the harps - n spectrograph installed on the 3.6-m telescopio nazionale galileo ( tng ) at the observatorio del roque de los muchachos in la palma , spain @xcite . harps -",

    "kepler-21 is a bright target with @xmath1 = 8.25 ( @xmath17 = 8.2 ) , so we obtained spectra with signal - to - noise ratios in the range snr = 45  308 ( average snr = 167 ) , at 550 nm in 10  30 minute exposures , depending on the seeing and sky transparency .",
    "a summary of the observations is provided in table  [ tab : data ] .",
    "the average rv error of the observations is 1.59 @xmath3 0.68 @xmath8 .",
    "this value is larger than the expected error of about 1.00 @xmath8 for a slowly rotating f- or g - dwarf of similar apparent magnitude , but we attribute it to the faster rotation of this star ( @xmath18 = 8.4 km s@xmath19 ; see section  [ sec : vsini ] ) , which broadens the spectral lines and therefore gives a larger uncertainty on the rv determination . in addition , kepler-21 presents significant photometric and spectroscopy variability , which produces an observed radial velocity variation semiamplitude of about 10 @xmath8 , including the stellar and planetary signals .",

    "they adopted a different observing strategy than the one we used with harps - n : they observed the target in groups of three consecutive exposures , each lasting between 2 and 3 min in order to maintain a typical snr of about 210 and an internal rv error of about 2 @xmath8 per exposure .",

    "the result is illustrated in figure  [ fig : acfplot ] .",
    "the acf peaks in the figure correspond to time offsets that coincide with an integer multiple of the rotation period of the star . in addition , the effective decay time of the spots can be estimated by measuring the amplitude decay of the acf side lobes in the figure .",
    "the amplitude decay occurs as the spots fade away with time . to measure these two parameters",
    ", we fitted the positive acf lobes to the equation of motion for an underdamped simple harmonic oscillator ( usho ) , which has a similar shape to the acf shape .",
    "however , it has been also found that a large number of stars exhibit _ interpulses _ , which occur when an additional large spot appears on the opposite side of the star , introducing additional side lobes at half periods ( giles & cameron , in prep ) .",
    "this can be accounted for by introducing an additional cosine term in the usho equation .",

    "our aim in this analysis is not to test how well an unconstrained gp can fit the data , but to use all the prior knowledge on the system to model the activity - driven signal as best as possible .",
    "we introduce in the model jitter terms for each instrument dataset .",
    "kepler-21 is slightly evolved , thus its photosphere should have fewer and larger granules than main - sequence solar type stars @xcite , and we expect larger activity signals in both the photometry and rvs during turnover convective timescales of a few hours .",
    "this is confirmed in both figures  [ fig : samplelcs ] and  [ fig : allrvs ] .",
    "therefore , we expect uncorrelated noise in a few - hours timescale to be a combination of both instrument systematics and residual granulation and stellar oscillation motions .",
    "regarding harps - n , recent observations of the sun ( * ? ? ?",
    "* phillips et al . in prep ) have shown the instrument has a random day - to - day offset with an rms of 0.9 @xmath8 ( phillips , private comm . ) .",
    "we account for this instrumental systematic by adding a noise term @xmath115 = 0.9 @xmath3 0.1 @xmath8 in quadrature to the measured rv errorbars .",
    "this value of @xmath115 is constrained by a gaussian prior . to estimate the granulation ( and oscillation)-induced noise , we compute the inverse - variance weighted standard deviation of the residuals within each night , at each mcmc step , after subtracting the planet model .",
    "we note that this is only possible for the 2015 harps - n dataset , which has two observations per night , separated by a few hours .",
    "this noise term , @xmath116 , is then added in quadrature to the measured rv errorbars , together with @xmath115 . in the case of hires",
    ", they also collected several rv measurements per night , but those were collected consecutively , so they can not be used to probe granulation over several hours timescales .",
    "we also do not have additional information about the intrinsic instrumental systematics of hires , so we use an overall free term , @xmath117 , to account for both instrument and granulation noise .",
    "we also adopt gaussian priors for the orbital period of the planet and the phase of the transits in the keplerian fit , using the best fit values for those parameters computed in section 4.1 .",
    "finally , we account for instrumental zero - point offsets of the two spectrographs with two separate terms , @xmath118 , for hires and @xmath119 for harps - n .",
    "we summarize the priors used for each free parameter of our rv model in table  [ tab : priors ] .",
    "we fit the hires and harps - n data both separately and together .",
    "we maximize the likelihood of our model and determine the best - fit parameter values through a mcmc procedure similar to the one described in @xcite .",
    "we ran the mcmc chains for 1,000,000 steps each , confirming their convergence using the gelman - rubin criterion @xcite .",
    "the best - fit parameters for all the three runs are summarized in table  [ tab : bigtable ] .",
    "the hires rv dataset on its own yields no significant detection of kepler-21b , as seen in column 1 of table  [ tab : bigtable ] .",
    "our mcmc chains did not converge within 1,000,000 steps . as a test to see",
    "whether the chain converged using a more tightly constrained model , we fixed the eccentricity to zero and imposed gaussian priors on the parameters that had uninformative priors otherwise : @xmath111 , @xmath120 and @xmath117 , but not @xmath121 .",
    "we centered these priors around the best - fit values of the combined hires and harps - n model . in spite of these constraints , the mcmc chains still do not converge as illustrated in figure  [ badshark ] .",
    "these findings are consistent with the non - detection result reported by @xcite .",
    "we also note that our best - fit values for @xmath117 are consistent with the jitter value of 5 @xmath8 reported by @xcite .    ,",
    "@xmath120 , and @xmath117 ( the eccentricity was also kept fixed to zero).[badshark ] ]    we attribute the non - detection in the hires data to the adopted observing strategy .",
    "the hires dataset consists of 40 observations over 80 days . the first 39 observations consisted of groups of three consecutive 150s exposures , some collected on consecutive nights , and some with several - night gaps between them .",
    "each group of three consecutive observations was averaged out to produce an rv data point per night , equivalent to a 10 minute - long observation , so the 40 observations dataset is effectively equivalent to 14 observations .",
    "the largest stretch of consecutive nightly observations is five days , which is slightly less than two orbital periods of kepler-21b .",
    "the full run spans 80 nights , which based on our analysis in section 3.1 , span three stellar active - region evolution timescales , and over six times the stellar rotation cycle .",
    "therefore , the coherence in the activity - induced signal is lost and the sampling of the observations is too sparse to decouple the orbit of kepler-21b from the activity - induced stellar variations .",
    "the harps - n dataset , although its observing strategy was not fully tailored for this system either , does yield a detection of the doppler signal of kepler-21b and a mass measurement of 5.41 @xmath3 1.76 @xmath9 ( see column 2 in table  [ tab : bigtable ] ) .",
    "the harps - n observations are split into two seasons . during the 2014 season , of 45 observations spanning almost four active - region lifetimes and eight stellar rotation cycles , we collected a single observation per night , with the exception of one night in the middle of the run and the last four nights of the run , when we collected two observations per night .",
    "two thirds of the observations were taken in three clusters of 6 , 7 , and 11 consecutive nights ; the remaining third are scattered in groups of three nights or fewer . in the 2015 season",
    "we deployed a different observing strategy , which proved to be better suited to characterizing the planet s orbit and the activity signal . in this season",
    "we collected 37 observations : the first five were still one observation per night , on isolated nights ; the other 32 observations were taken twice per night , separated always at least by 3.5 hours , but on average five hours .",
    "the last 28 observations were taken on 15 consecutive nights , with gaps in two of the nights due to bad weather .",
    "this last stretch of observations fits well within one active - region lifetime ( about two stellar rotation cycles ) , which means that the coherency of the activity - induced variations is preserved .",
    "however , we note that the 28 last observations alone do not yield a significant detection of kepler-21b .",
    "the ideal number of observations , their sampling and stretch in time must be somewhere between these 28 observations and the full harps - n campaign , but exploring this further is beyond the scope of our analysis in this paper . however , we highlight that observational strategies customized for individual targets will yield to significant improvement in our capacity to detect planetary doppler signals in rv curves of active stars .",
    "although the hires campaign alone does not contain sufficient information to provide a robust mass determination of kepler-21b , those data are still compatible with the harps - n campaign , as illustrated in figure  [ fig : model ] , and their combined analysis yields system parameters fully consistent with the harps - n data alone , as shown in column 3 of table  [ tab : bigtable ] .",
    "figure  [ goodshark ] shows the posterior distributions of the mcmc analysis for the combined datasets .",
    "looking closely at the correlation plots of @xmath121 reveals , in addition to the main distribution peak , a local area of maximum likelihood near @xmath121 = 0 @xmath8 , which is not present in the analysis of the harps - n data alone and is therefore introduced by the hires data .",
    "this may be interpreted as the hires data acting as a prior on the harps - n observations when we combine the two datasets . in this case , the influence of this peak is diminished by the larger sampling of the harps - n data and the posterior distribution of @xmath121 is fully dominated by the harps - n dataset ( as shown in table  [ tab : bigtable ] this does not significantly affect the resultant planet mass ) .",
    "however , there may be cases in which the additional peak in the posterior distribution becomes more prominent , affecting the final fit .",
    "this could for example occur when combining datasets from different instruments with similar numbers of observations .",
    "given that the results from the analysis of the harps - n data alone and the combined datasets are consistent , we adopt the solution of the combined datasets ( column 3 table  [ tab : bigtable ] ) in as the best - fit parameter values for the system . the resulting best - fit model for the combined dataset",
    "is shown in figure  [ fig : model ] , and the resultant phase folded orbit of kepler-21b is shown in figure  [ fig : phase ] .",
    "we note that the value of @xmath121 for each fit remains consistent withing 1@xmath5 regardless of our choice of covariance function , parameter distributions or initial parameter values , which attests the robustness of this result .",
    "in addition , the best - fit parameters remain the same when we fix the orbital eccentricity to zero , which supports the result of a zero eccentricity measurement in table  [ tab : bigtable ] .",

    "the two bottom panels , of equal timespan , show how the frequency structure of the model is preserved in time and adequately fits the observations throughout the combined dataset .",

    "<S> hd 179070 , @xmath0 kepler-21 , is a @xmath1 = 8.25 f6iv star and the brightest exoplanet host discovered by @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> an early detailed analysis by @xcite of the first thirteen months ( q0  q5 ) of @xmath2 light curves revealed transits of a planetary companion , kepler-21b , with a radius of about 1.60 @xmath3 0.04 @xmath4 and an orbital period of about 2.7857 days . </S>",
    "<S> however , they could not determine the mass of the planet from the initial radial velocity observations with keck - hires , and were only able to impose a 2@xmath5 upper limit of 10 @xmath6 . here </S>",
    "<S> we present results from the analysis of 82 new radial velocity observations of this system obtained with harps - n , together with the existing 14 hires data points . </S>",
    "<S> we detect the doppler signal of kepler-21b with a radial velocity semi - amplitude @xmath7 = 2.00 @xmath3 0.65 @xmath8 , which corresponds to a planetary mass of 5.1 @xmath3 1.7 @xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> we also measure an improved radius for the planet of 1.639@xmath10 @xmath11 , in agreement with the radius reported by @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that kepler-21b , with a density of 6.4 @xmath3 2.1 @xmath12 , belongs to the population of terrestrial planets with iron , magnesium silicate interiors , which have lost the majority of their envelope volatiles via stellar winds or gravitational escape . </S>",
    "<S> the radial velocity analysis presented in this paper serves as example of the type of analysis that will be necessary to confirm the masses of tess small planet candidates . </S>"
