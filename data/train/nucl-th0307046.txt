    "new effective methods for solving exactly the shell model ( sm ) eigenvalue problem in complex nuclei have been developed in recent years .",
    "a notable one is the monte carlo technique @xcite for generating exact sm ground states @xcite .",
    "its application , however , has been rather restricted because of the well known _ minus - sign _ problem .",
    "alternative methods face directly the diagonalization of the sm hamiltonian by resorting to algorithms like lanczos @xcite and davidson @xcite .",
    "the critical points of direct diagonalization methods are the amount of memory needed and the time spent in the diagonalization process .    in order to overcome these limitations",
    "there have been attempts to combine the stochastic methodology with the standard diagonalization approach @xcite . in @xcite the use of gaussian - like single - particle basis states with random oscillator frequencies was suggested .",
    "the authors of @xcite proposed a stochastic truncation of the sm matrices and suggested for the energies so obtained an exponential extrapolation law to the exact eigenvalues .",
    "in the so call quantum monte carlo diagonalization method ( qmcd)@xcite the reduction of the dimension of the sm space is achieved by using the auxiliary field monte carlo technique to select the _ relevant _ basis states .",
    "though quite successful , the latter method is not free from problems .",
    "indeed , one has to deal with the redundancy of the basis states , which may slow considerably the convergence of the procedure , as well as with the problem of restoring the symmetries generally broken in stochastic approaches .    in a recent paper @xcite ,",
    "we have developed an iterative algorithm for determining a selected set of eigenvectors of a large matrix which is faster than the other , currently adopted , algorithms , including lanczos , and extremely simple to be implemented .",
    "it is , moreover , _ robust _ , yielding always _",
    "ghost_-free stable solutions .",
    "like the other methods , however , it requires the storage of at least one eigenvector , which exceeds the limits of modern computers in many complex systems .",
    "the present paper deals with the problem of overcoming this limitation . to this purpose",
    ", we endow the algorithm with an importance sampling for reducing the sizes of the matrix .",
    "the sampling is closely linked to the iterative algorithm and is in full control of the accuracy of the eigensolutions .",
    "this will emerge clearly from the results of the exhaustive tests presented and discussed in this paper .",
    "in fact , we adopted the importance sampling to solve the shell model problem for three typical nuclei , the semi - magic @xmath1sn , the @xmath2 doubly even @xmath3cr , and the @xmath4 odd @xmath5xe . in order to enhance its efficiency we used a correlated basis obtained from partitioning the shell model space according to a method developed in ref .",
    "we will show that the method not only allows for a drastic truncation of the sm space but yields naturally extrapolation laws to exact eigenvalues and eigenvectors as well as to the occupation numbers and the @xmath6 transition probabilities .",
    "let us first give a brief outline of the algorithm @xcite . for the sake of simplicity ,",
    "we consider here a symmetric matrix @xmath7 representing a self - adjoint operator @xmath8 in an orthonormal basis @xmath9 .",
    "the algorithm goes through several iteration loops .",
    "the first loop consists of the following steps :    1a ) diagonalize the two - dimensional matrix @xmath10 ( i , j=1,2 ) ,    1b ) select the lowest eigenvalue @xmath11 and the corresponding eigenvector @xmath12 1c ) for @xmath13 , diagonalize the matrix @xmath14 where @xmath15 and select the lowest eigenvalue @xmath16 together with the corresponding eigenvector @xmath17 .",
    "this zero approximation loop yields the approximate eigenvalue and eigenvector @xmath18 with these new entries we start an iterative procedure which goes through @xmath19 refinement loops , consisting of the same steps with the following modification . at each step @xmath20 of the @xmath21-th loop ( @xmath22 )",
    "we have to solve an eigenvalue problem of general form , since the states @xmath23 and @xmath24 are no longer orthogonal .",
    "the eigenvalue @xmath25 and eigenvector @xmath26 obtained after the @xmath21-th loop are proven to converge to the exact eigenvalue @xmath27 and eigenvector @xmath28 respectively @xcite .",
    "the algorithm has been shown to be completely equivalent to the method of optimal relaxation @xcite and has therefore a variational foundation .    because of its matrix formulation",
    ", however , it can be generalized with minimal changes so as to generate at once an arbitrary number @xmath29 of eigensolutions .",
    "indeed , the first loop goes through the following steps :    1a ) start with @xmath30 basis vectors and diagonalize the @xmath31-dimensional principal submatrix @xmath32 ,    1b ) select the @xmath29 lowest eigenvalues @xmath33 and the corresponding eigenvectors @xmath34    for @xmath35 , where @xmath36 are the steps necessary to exhaust the whole @xmath37-dimensional matrix ,    1c ) diagonalize the matrix @xmath38 where @xmath39 is a @xmath29-dimensional diagonal matrix whose non - zero entries are the eigenvalues @xmath40 , @xmath41 is a @xmath42-dimensional submatrix , @xmath43 and its transpose are matrices composed of the matrix elements @xmath44 ( i = 1 , @xmath45 ) .",
    "1d ) select the @xmath29 lowest eigenvalues @xmath46 and the corresponding eigenvectors @xmath47    once the basis is exhausted , the process yields @xmath29 approximate eigenvalues and eigenvectors , which are the new entries for a new iteration .",
    "this goes through the same steps with one essential modification .",
    "each loop , in fact , can be viewed as the solution of the eigenproblem for the restriction @xmath48 of the operator @xmath8 to a subspace defined by the span of the set of vectors @xmath49 . since the vectors @xmath50 are linear superpositions of all the basis vectors @xmath24 we started with , the basis obtained after the first approximation loop is no longer orthonormal , just as in the one - dimensional eigenspace , and may be even redundant .",
    "we have therefore to solve an eigenvalue problem of general form .",
    "this is done most effectively through a pivotal choleski decomposition of the overlap matrix @xmath51 @xcite . as outlined in a forthcoming paper",
    ", this procedure is very easy to be implemented and extremely fast , specially in view of the very limited dimensions of the matrices coming into play . with this modifications ,",
    "the subsequent iteration loops proceed as the first one . in this way",
    "we generate a sequence of @xmath29 vectors @xmath52 .",
    "the restriction of the operator @xmath8 to these sets defines a sequence of diagonal matrices , whose non zero elements are the current eigenvalues @xmath53 , with decreasing norms .",
    "this monotonic sequence is certainly bounded from below and therefore convergent .",
    "the just outlined algorithm , though of simple implementation , requires the storage of at least one eigenvector . since for many complex systems",
    "the dimensions of the hamiltonian matrix become prohibitively large , one must rely on some importance sampling which allows for a truncation of the space by selecting only the basis states relevant to the exact eigensolutions .",
    "a notable example is the stochastic diagonalization method @xcite , which samples the basis states relevant to the ground state through a combination of plane ( jacobi ) rotations and matrix inflation .    a similar , but more efficient",
    ", strategy can be implemented in the framework of our diagonalization process .",
    "exploiting the fact that the algorithm yields quite accurate solutions already in the first approximation loop , we can devise a sampling which makes use of the first loop only .",
    "this is to be accordingly modified and goes through the following steps :    1a ) turn the @xmath29-dimensional principal submatrix @xmath54 into the diagonal form @xmath55with eigenvalues @xmath56 .",
    "1b ) for @xmath57 , diagonalize the @xmath58-dimensional matrix    @xmath59    where @xmath60 .",
    "1c ) select the lowest @xmath29 eigenvalues @xmath61 and accept the new state only if @xmath62 otherwise restart from point 1b ) with a new @xmath63 .",
    "we can avoid such a time consuming sampling procedure by resorting to an alternative , though completely equivalent , route based on the method developed for deriving an exact non perturbative shell model hamiltonian @xcite .",
    "we carry the similarity transformation @xmath64 where @xmath65 here , @xmath66 is the @xmath29-dimensional unit matrix and @xmath67 a @xmath29-dimensional vector .",
    "the transformed matrix has the following structure @xmath68 where @xmath69 we now impose the decoupling condition @xmath70 once we find the solution @xmath67 , the matrix element @xmath71 becomes an eigenvalue of the matrix @xmath72 and , therefore , of matrix @xmath73 .",
    "right multiplying eq .",
    "( [ bp ] ) by @xmath74 , we obtain the dispersion relation @xmath75 this admits @xmath58 solutions , corresponding to the @xmath58 eigenvalues of a. in correspondence of the lowest solution @xmath76 , we get the maximum eigenvalue @xmath77 the eigenvalues @xmath78 separate at least in weak sense the new eigenvalues @xmath79 @xcite , namely @xmath80 since @xmath81 we have @xmath82 condition ( [ sampeps ] ) is therefore equivalent to @xmath83 the just outlined sampling procedure requires only the solution of the dispersion equation ( [ disprel ] ) , which is of the type @xmath84 and fulfils the condition @xmath85 we can therefore easily solve it by using the newton method of derivative . this alternative sampling procedure is not only rigorous but also more economical .",
    "it avoids , in fact , the @xmath86fold iterated diagonalization of @xmath58 dimensional matrices .",
    "the extent of truncation induced by the sampling is maximal when the eigenvectors are highly localized .",
    "this condition is fulfilled in most physical problems . even when this is not the case",
    ", we can approach the above condition by using a correlated basis obtained by a multipartitioning method @xcite .",
    "this goes through the following prescriptions :    \\i ) partition the shell model space for n valence nucleons into orthogonal subspaces , @xmath87 and @xmath88 according to @xmath89 ii ) distribute @xmath90 and @xmath91 nucleons ( @xmath92 ) among these subspaces in all possible ways ,    \\iii ) decompose the hamiltonian @xmath93 into @xmath94 iv ) solve the eigenvalue equations @xmath95 obtaining the eigenstates @xmath96 and @xmath97 of @xmath98 and @xmath99 respectively in @xmath87 and @xmath88 .",
    "once this is done , it is possible to replace the standard shell model basis with one composed of the states @xmath100 we use the above basis to diagonalize the residual term @xmath101 of the sm hamiltonian .",
    "the new basis is in general highly correlated and , therefore , highly localized in the fock space , a feature which enhances considerably the efficiency of the method .",
    "we applied the sampling algorithm to the semi - magic @xmath1sn , the n = z even - even @xmath3cr and the @xmath102 odd - even @xmath5xe .",
    "the model spaces are :    \\1 ) @xmath103 for the 8 valence neutrons of @xmath1sn and for the 4 valence protons and 3 valence neutron holes of @xmath5xe ,    2)@xmath104 for the 4 valence protons and neutrons of @xmath3cr .",
    "we adopted a realistic effective interaction deduced from the bonn - a potential @xcite for @xmath1sn and @xmath5xe , and used the kb3 interaction @xcite for @xmath3cr .",
    "for @xmath1sn we used the single particle ( s.p . ) energies ( in mev ) @xmath105 .",
    "apart from the first two currently in use , the other energies were deduced from a fit on @xmath106sn for @xmath107 and from the level @xmath108 in @xmath109sn for @xmath110 .",
    "we used the same set of energies for protons in @xmath5xe , while for neutron - holes we used the slightly different values @xmath111 .",
    "the different set accounts effectively , at least in part , for the significant asymmetry between proton and neutron numbers which yield different contributions from the three- and more - body forces , not included in the effective interaction . as for @xmath3cr",
    ", we used the same energies adopted in ref.@xcite , namely @xmath112 .",
    "we partitioned the shell model space for @xmath1sn according the following prescriptions : @xmath113 this partition is dictated by the large energy gap ( @xmath114 mev ) between the two corresponding sets of single particle energies .    for @xmath3cr and @xmath5xe , we simply decompose the space into a proton and neutron subspace @xmath115 we adopted then the multipartitioning method @xcite to generate a new correlated basis @xmath116 and used this new basis to implement the importance sampling .",
    "for illustrative purposes we discuss only few of the lowest states of the nuclei under investigation . as shown in the plot of fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , the sampling parameter @xmath117 varies very smoothly with the dimensions @xmath21 of the reduced matrices . in these , as in all other states considered , it scales according to @xmath118 }   \\label{epsscale}\\ ] ] in virtue of this law , the increment of the dimensions of the matrix is modest for large values of @xmath117 , but grows dramatically as @xmath117 gets smaller and smaller .",
    "this behavior reflects the density of the unperturbed levels which is very low at low energy and raises steeply around a centroid at high energy .",
    "this is shown in the upper panel of fig .",
    "it follows that the running sum of the unperturbed basis states grows very slowly at low energy , then raises steeply toward its saturating full @xmath37 value in a relatively small energy interval ( middle panel of fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) .",
    "it is important to point out that this is the distribution of our unperturbed correlated states defined by eq .",
    "( [ part1 ] ) .",
    "the partitioning of the shell model space is responsible for the squeezing of their energies around a centroid",
    ". had we adopted the standard sm basis , the state distribution would have resulted more spread out and the running sum would have grown discontinuously through several steps in correspondence of each sub - shell ( lower panel of fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) .    figs .",
    "[ fig3]-[fig5 ] plot the eigenvalues versus the dimensions @xmath21 of the matrices resulting from decreasing values of the sampling parameter @xmath117 for some low - lying states of @xmath1sn , @xmath3cr , and @xmath5xe , respectively .    in all nuclei and for all states ,",
    "the eigenvalues decrease monotonically and smoothly with @xmath21 .",
    "the only meaningful exceptions are represented by the curves of the first excited @xmath119 and @xmath120 and few other , similarly behaving , high - lying states of @xmath3cr . these undergo a jump from an upper to a lower curve at some small value of the sampling parameter @xmath117 , a signal of energy crossing . even in these cases , however , the subsequent behavior of the energies is smooth as for the other states .",
    "it follows that , in all cases , starting from a sufficiently small @xmath117 , the energies scale with the dimensions @xmath21 according to the law @xmath121 } \\label{scale}\\ ] ] where @xmath122 , @xmath123 , and @xmath124 are constants specific of each state and the full dimension @xmath37 provides the scale .",
    "this fit allows for an extrapolation to asymptotic eigenvalues which differ from the exact ones in the second or third decimal digit .",
    "this is explicitly proven for @xmath1sn and @xmath3cr ( table [ tab1 ] ) .",
    "the reliability of the extrapolation in the case of @xmath5xe is inferred from the rapid convergence of the iterative procedure , as clearly illustrated in fig .",
    "indeed , the curves reach a plateau of practically constant energies starting from an @xmath21 value which is smaller than the full dimension @xmath37 by more than one order of magnitude in @xmath1sn , @xmath3cr , and by more than two in @xmath5xe .",
    "our exponential extrapolation law is somewhat different from the one proposed in refs .",
    "@xcite . on the other hand , it is valid for all states and nuclei examined and follows directly from the sampling , as it can be inferred from the following heuristic argument",
    ".    let us consider the simplest case of one - dimensional eigenspace ( @xmath125 ) . from eqs .",
    "( [ disprel ] ) and ( [ samp1 ] ) , we can write the corresponding sampling prescription as @xmath126 expanding @xmath127 , we get a solution whose leading term is @xmath128 > from the plots it is clear that the extrapolation law holds for an energy range of 1 - 2 mev in proximity of the exact eigenvalue .",
    "it accounts therefore for small contributions coming from a small fraction of the basis states in the @xmath129 in the high density region around the peak , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] . since",
    ", in this range , the energies @xmath130 of our correlated basis states are closely packed and approach the @xmath131 value , we can put @xmath132 in first approximation .",
    "it remains to analyze the matrix elements @xmath133 .",
    "these are given by @xmath134 where @xmath135 for the lowest eigenvalue , the dominant @xmath136 components of @xmath17 are the low - energy ones with small @xmath137 values .",
    "it follows that the probability , @xmath133 , that the interaction couples @xmath17 to @xmath24 is small and random for @xmath138 and vanishes for @xmath139 , as prescribed by the sampling criterion .",
    "this implies that the dimension @xmath21 represents the range of the allowed _",
    "events_. we can therefore put @xmath140 , where @xmath141 is a label representative of the small fraction of @xmath63 terms of the sum @xmath129 . we used the factor @xmath37 to fix the scale .",
    "the scaling law ( [ epsscale ] ) for @xmath117 follows from the one for the energy @xmath27 since @xmath117 is essentially the derivative of @xmath27 with respect to @xmath21 .",
    "we have also compared the sampling with the energy truncation of the hamiltonian matrix .",
    "as shown in fig . [ fig6 ] , the sampling is obviously more effective and accurate .",
    "the two procedures , however , tend to become equivalent for a value of @xmath21 which , though large , is still much smaller than the full dimension @xmath37 .",
    "it is to be pointed out , however , that , in our case , the effectiveness of the energy truncation is due to a great extent to the use of the correlated basis obtained through the multi - partitioning method .",
    "an accuracy of the same quality is reached for the eigenstates of the @xmath21-dimensional truncated hamiltonian matrix @xmath142 where @xmath143 are the correlated basis states obtained by the partitioning method .    in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] we give the the overlap of @xmath144 with the exact eigenvector @xmath145 for the first five @xmath146 states of @xmath1sn and @xmath147 of @xmath3cr .",
    "the convergence to unity is fast for all five states , even if , for some of them , the overlap is very small at small @xmath21 .",
    "small fluctuations are noticeable at small n values .",
    "they reflect the interference between the components of different wave functions in correspondence of partial energy crossings .",
    "the above two features represent a further proof of the _ robustness _ of the iterative algorithm .    to complete the analysis we study the behavior versus @xmath148 of the strengths of the @xmath6 transitions between some low - lying states in @xmath1sn and @xmath3cr ( fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] ) , as well as in @xmath5xe ( fig .",
    "[ fig9 ] ) . in all cases ,",
    "the strengths reach soon a plateau and , then , undergo very small variations , appreciable only on a very small scale ( see inset ) .",
    "this fine tuning analysis shows that each strength grows slowly with @xmath149 , apart from the transition @xmath150 , whose strength decreases at an even slower rate . in all cases ,",
    "their smooth behavior allows for an extrapolation to asymptotic values through a formula having the same structure as the scaling law adopted for the energies ( eq . [ scale ] ) .",
    "table [ tab2 ] shows that the strengths computed at a relatively large @xmath117 differ very little from the extrapolated ones , which in turn practically coincide with the exact values .",
    "this rapid convergence is quite significant in view of the extreme sensitivity of the transition strengths to even very small components of the wave function .",
    "we have shown that the importance sampling is inherent in the iterative algorithm for diagonalizing large matrices .",
    "the truncation of the dimensions of the matrices it promotes is not only kept under strict control , but is also quite severe when the eigenvectors are highly localized . for shell model nuclear hamiltonians , we achieved this localization by adopting a correlated basis obtained by partitioning the shell model space into two or more subspaces .",
    "as clearly illustrated by the calculations carried out on some typical nuclei , the sampling so implemented allows to reduce the sizes of the hamiltonian matrix by at least an order of magnitude with no detriment of the accuracy .",
    "we get in fact very accurate energies , wave functions and @xmath6 reduced strengths .",
    "moreover , it generates extrapolation laws to asymptotic eigenvalues and @xmath6 transition probabilities which coincide practically with the exact corresponding quantities , whenever these are available .",
    "it is important to point out that the method is specially effective when applied to @xmath5xe , having a neutron excess . on the ground of this result , we feel confident that the sampling , combined with the use of the correlated basis , will enable us to face successfully the eigenvalue problem in heavier nuclei , all having a neutron excess .",
    "we also like to stress that the partition method is specially suitable for enlarging the standard shell model valence space through the inclusion of n - particle n - hole correlated configurations .",
    "we plan to make such an implementation in order to study the intruder states in light as well as heavy nuclei",
