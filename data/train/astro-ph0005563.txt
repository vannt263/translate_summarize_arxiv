    "at wavelengths longer than @xmath4@xmath0 m the far - infrared emission of the galaxy is dominated by thermal emission from large dust particles that are in thermal equilibrium with the interstellar radiation field .",
    "dust temperatures determined from dirbe measurements are typically 1619k ( e.g.  @xcite ; @xcite ) in rough agreement with model predictions ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "most previous fir dust temperature determinations have been based on cobe observations .",
    "these have , however , poor spatial resolution and in low surface brightness regions the sensitivity of the detectors becomes a limiting factor so that only an average dust spectrum over a large area can be determined .",
    "we use isophot observations to study the spectrum of galactic cirrus in regions selected for their low surface brightness . because of the better sensitivity and angular resolution of the isophot instrument it is possible to determine the cirrus spectrum in these fields based on the cirrus intensity variations . in this way constant or slowly varying components , e.g.  zodiacal light , can be eliminated .",
    "the determination of the cirrus spectrum is important also for extragalactic studies where the galactic foreground emission must be separated . in future work",
    "the same fields will be used to estimate the fir component of the cosmic background radiation .",
    "we start by presenting the observations used in this study . after that calibration differences between isophot and dirbe observations",
    "are discussed .",
    "calibration issues are obviously essential for the determination of the spectra and the dust temperatures .",
    "finally , the method used to derive the cirrus spectra and the derived dust temperatures are presented .",
    "a @xmath3 dust emissivity law will be assumed throughout this paper .",
    "the cirrus spectra were determined in six fields that had been observed at 90@xmath0 m , 150@xmath0 m and 180@xmath0 m with the isophot instrument ( @xcite ) aboard the iso satellite ( @xcite ) .",
    "the observation consist of pht22 raster maps .",
    "detailed description of the observations is given in table  [ mj_table : maps ] .",
    "data reduction was done using the isophot interactive analysis software package ( pia ) ( @xcite ) version 8.0 . in the following the analysis",
    "is based on measurements reduced to the aap level .",
    "flatfielding was done outside pia using custom routines that also removed slow drifts of the detector pixels relative to each other .",
    "good flat fielding is not critical for the determination of the spectra but it will reduce the noise in the subsequent steps .",

    "the results presented in this paper are based on the calibration performed with fine calibration source ( fcs ) measurements .",

    "@xcite recently reported for both c100 and c200 accuracies better than 20% relative to dirbe .",
    "these results apply to fields with surface brightness above @xmath15mjysr@xmath2 while several of our c200 maps are below 4mjysr@xmath2 .",
    "it is therefore useful to compare our observations with dirbe data especially as the calibration accuracy is essential for the determination of the cirrus spectra .",
    "the dirbe and isophot calibration was studied in the case of the fields ngps , ngpn , ebl22 , and ebl26 ( see table  [ mj_table : maps ] ) .",

    "_ comparison of absolute surface brightness levels_. the isophot maps were compared with dirbe zsma ( _ zodi - subtracted mission average _ ) data to which zodiacal light was added according to the model given by @xcite ) . using the dirbe weekly maps observed with the same solar elongation as the iso data did not change the results significantly . because of the lower noise we chose to use the zsma data .",
    "both dirbe zsma and iso were colour corrected assuming a @xmath9 spectrum with @xmath10=18k . the zodiacal light estimates were colour corrected assuming black body spectrum with @xmath10=270k ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "corresponding curves fitted to the dirbe zsma 100@xmath0 m , 140@xmath0 m and 240@xmath0 m data and the zodiacal light estimates were used to derive the dirbe surface brightness estimates interpolated to the wavelength of the iso observations .",
    "the average iso flux density was compared with the derived dirbe values calculated as the average over iso map and weighted by the dirbe beam .",
    "the result is the surface brightness ratio @xmath11(dirbe)/@xmath11(isophot ) .",
    "direct comparison of the surface brightness variations _ in isophot and dirbe zsma maps .",
    "all data were first colour corrected for a spectrum @xmath12 with @xmath10 = 18.0k . for each dirbe",
    "pixel the data were interpolated to the wavelength of the isophot observations and the corresponding isophot surface brightness estimate was calculated as a weighted average over the dirbe beam .",
    "linear fit was done to these points to derive the slope between the surface brightness values @xmath13(dirbe)/@xmath14(isophot ) .",
    "comparison via iras_. linear relations were established between the iras 100@xmath0 m data and the iso observations and between the iras data and the dirbe zsma data interpolated to the wavelength of the iso observations using a fitted curve @xmath9(@xmath15=18k ) .",
    "for each iras issa map pixel inside the field the corresponding iso surface brightness was calculated as an average weighted with a gaussian with fwhm@xmath15 arcmin .",
    "the relation between iras and dirbe surface brightnesses was determined with a similar method but over an area with radius @xmath12 degrees where for each dirbe pixel the average iras value was calculated by weighting with the dirbe beam .",
    "the slopes of these two linear relations @xmath16/@xmath17 @xmath18/@xmath19 give the ratio between dirbe and iso scales , @xmath13(dirbe)/@xmath14(isophot ) .    method ( 1 ) suffers from the small size of the isophot maps which means that for each dirbe pixel a large portion of the flux comes from outside the area mapped with isophot .",
    "method ( 2 ) is even more affected by the limited map sizes and the large size of the dirbe beam since we must determine the relation between brightness variations .",
    "however , ngpn and ngps form together a 3.1 degrees long strip where the surface brightness gradient is along the longer side of the map . here",
    "the fact that the iso map is narrow compared with the dirbe beam should not lead to significant errors . on the other hand , in ebl26 the surface brightness drops quickly outside the bright region in the northern part of the map .",
    "the surface brightness variation is not resolved by dirbe beam and the values @xmath20/@xmath21 obtained would be underestimated . in ebl22 and",
    "ngpn the method does not work because of the lack of sufficient surface brightness variations .",
    "methods ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) are not affected by the presence of zodiacal light .",
    "the last method uses iras issa maps as an intermediate step and is therefore much less affected by the poor resolution of the dirbe data .",
    "it allows also the use of dirbe data over a much larger area and thereby reduces the effect of the large noise present in 140@xmath0 m and 240@xmath0 m dirbe observations . in these low surface brightness regions",
    "the error estimates of 140@xmath0 m and 240@xmath0 m dirbe measurements exceed 50% .",

    "it can be seen that dirbe and isophot surface brightness values agree typically to within 30% .",
    "however , at 90@xmath0 m the isophot surface brightness tends to be above the value predicted from dirbe observations while at longer wavelengths the situation is reversed .",
    "the extrapolation of the dirbe values to 90@xmath0 m using the modified black body fitted to three longer wavelength may not be entirely justified and may lead to underestimation of the surface brightness .",
    "also , in these faintest regions the accuracy of the dirbe 140@xmath0 m and 240@xmath0 m is poor and a reliable comparison with isophot c200 values is difficult .",
    "the modified black body curves fitted to dirbe data are determined mostly by the 100@xmath0 m dirbe value which has significantly smaller error estimates than the two longer wavelengths , and the assumed dust temperature , @xmath15=18.0k .",
    "increasing the temperature by one degree would increase @xmath26 at 90@xmath0 m by some 5% and decrease it at longer wavelengths by some 15% .    in spite of uncertainties the results suggest that the dust temperatures derived from isophot observations are , because of calibration differences , higher than those based on dirbe data .",
    "using pia versions prior to 8.0 the differences between isophot and dirbe surface brightnesses were typically larger by some 20% .",
    "as the first step all data were colour corrected in order to derive monochromatic surface brightness values at the reference wavelengths of the filters .",
    "correction was done for spectrum @xmath27 which approximates the expected cirrus spectrum .",
    "a large fraction of the observed surface brightness values is due to zodiacal light .",
    "since we will study only the relative surface brightness variations the zodiacal light is eliminated from the analysis and it does not affect the required colour correction .    in the calculations",
    "the 180@xmath0 m maps are used as the reference . for each 180@xmath0 m",
    "pixel the corresponding surface brightness value at another wavelength is calculated as a weighted average .",
    "the spatial weighting is done with a gaussian with fwhm@xmath28100 arcsec and the individual measurements are also weighted according to their error estimates .",
    "the calculated values are plotted against the 180@xmath0 m surface brightness and a straight line is fitted to the points with a least squares algorithm that takes into account the error estimates on both axes .",
    "the procedure is repeated for all maps and the slopes of the fitted lines provide the emission spectrum i.e.  for each observed wavelength the relative intensity with respect to the 180@xmath0 m emission .",
    "figure  [ mj_fig : ebl26_fit ] shows as an example the relations between 180@xmath0 m and 90@xmath0 m and 180@xmath0 m and 150@xmath0 m surface brightness values in the field ebl26 .",
    "the fitted least square lines are also shown .",
    "zodiacal light will appear merely as an offset and does not affect the slopes that determine the cirrus spectrum .",
    "furthermore , zodiacal light is weak at 180@xmath0 m and we are looking only for variations correlated with 180@xmath0 m emission .",
    "galactic cirrus is the dominant source of brightness fluctuations and therefore the spectra obtained characterize the galactic cirrus emission .",
    "however , in low surface brightness regions there may be a significant contribution from faint extragalactic sources .",
    "the dirbe ( @xcite ) and firas ( @xcite ) experiments indicated a fir cosmic infrared background flux of  1 mjy sr@xmath2 between 100 and 240@xmath0 m . in fields like ebl22",
    "this would mean that at 180@xmath0 m about one third of the surface brightness is due to extragalactic sources . since the cirrus spectra are determined from the brightness variations we must consider the brightness fluctuations caused by these sources in relation to the cirrus fluctuations .",
    "the cirrus power spectrum is proportional to @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the cirrus brightness and @xmath26 the spatial frequency ( @xcite ) . in other words ,",
    "cirrus fluctuations decrease rapidly as we move to fainter cirrus regions and smaller spatial scales .",
    "@xcite have reported a detection of the extragalactic background fluctuations at 175@xmath0 m in the marano1 field that has cirrus surface brightness comparable to our fields .",
    "even after removal of detected sources they found at scales below 10 arcmin fluctuations in excess of the expected cirrus contribution .",
    "this was interpreted to be caused by point sources below the detection limit .",
    "the larger dimension of our maps is typically 1.5 degrees and most of the surface brightness variations can be expected to be due to cirrus .",
    "this is particularly clear in fields ngps and ebl26 where there is a clear intensity gradient along the mapped strip consistent with the larger scale cirrus distribution visible in iras maps . on the other hand ,",
    "the field ebl22 is remarkably flat and it is conceivable that in the absence of large cirrus structures the extragalactic point sources could affect the derived spectrum .",
    "the small dynamic range means , however , that in this case the accuracy of the derived spectrum is not very good .",
    "the fields vcn and vcs were observed close the bright galaxy ngc5907 and the vcs field actually extends over the centre of the galaxy .",
    "pixels that were clearly affected by the emission from ngc5907 were first discarded but it is still possible that the derived spectra are affected by emission of the galaxy . because of the small field size ( @xmath110 arcmin ) the vcn spectrum could be affected by faint extragalactic sources .",
    "the spectra obtained for the six fields are presented in figure  [ mj_fig : cirrus ] .",
    "the error bars include the error estimates obtained from the fitting procedure and a further 10% error representing the error in the relative calibration of the observations made with different filters . modified planck curves , @xmath31 ,",
    "were fitted to the data and the dust temperatures obtained are shown in the figure .",
    "we have determined cirrus dust temperatures in six fields with low surface brightness .",
    "the derived dust temperatures , @xmath118 - 20k , are higher than the typical temperatures estimated for galactic dust from dirbe and firas experiments assuming the same @xmath3 emissivity law . however , the values are still within the range found in these studies .",
    "@xcite found an average temperature of 17.5k while higher temperatures were mostly associated with star forming regions .",
    "temperatures exceeding 20k were seen only towards the galactic centre and some prominent star forming regions although the scatter in the temperatures is more than 1k at all galactic latitudes .",
    "our fields are all at high galactic latitudes ( see table  [ mj_table : maps ] ) . based on cobe measurements at 100240@xmath0",
    "m @xcite derived average dust temperatures of @xmath32k for regions at @xmath3330 degrees .",
    "earlier firas estimates ( @xcite ) also suggested similar or lower values .",
    "however , based on the dirbe 140@xmath0 m to 240@xmath0 m ratios @xcite ) reported colour temperatures of @xmath3419k for regions with @xmath3345 degrees .    in section  [ mj_sect : cal ]",
    "we found systematic differences between isophot and dirbe calibrations . compared with dirbe",
    "the isophot surface brightnesses were found to be higher at 90@xmath0 m and lower at longer wavelengths . according to table  [ mj_table : dirbe ] adopting",
    "the dirbe calibration would increase our 90@xmath0 m data by up to 30% relative to the longer wavelengths .",
    "this would reduce the estimated dust temperature by @xmath11.5k .",
    "therefore the temperature difference between dirbe and our results can be explained entirely by the difference in calibration .",
    "our temperature determinations are based on data at three wavelengths : 90@xmath0 m , 150@xmath0 m and 240@xmath0 m .",
    "the emission at wavelengths @xmath35100@xmath0 m can be explained by classical grains in equilibrium with the interstellar radiation field .",
    "smaller grains that are transiently heated to higher temperatures are responsible for the emission at shorter wavelengths . based on both observations and theoretical calculations the contribution from transietly heated particles",
    "is significant already at 60@xmath0 m and may extend even to slightly longer wavelengths ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the isophot 90@xmath0 m filter is wide enough to pick up some radiation from wavelenths down to @xmath160@xmath0 m and our observations may be affected to a small degree by this other grain population .",
    "our temperature estimates do not correspond exactly to the equilibrium temperature of large dust particles but the bias towards higher temperatures is expected to be small .    in the low surface brightness regions the accuracy of dirbe measurements is not very good and one can obtain only the average spectrum of a very large area .",
    "because of the better resolution and sensitivity of isophot we have been able to study the cirrus spectrum in separate , small regions .",
    "adopting the isophot calibration the accuracy of the temperature estimates is @xmath11k .",
    "for example , the 2k difference between the adjacent fields ngps and ngpn is likely to be true .",
