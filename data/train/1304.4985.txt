    "topological cycles in shapes capture their important features , and are employed in many applications from science and engineering .",
    "a problem of particular interest in this context is the optimal homologous cycle problem , ohcp , where given a cycle in the shape , the goal is to compute the shortest cycle in its topological class ( homologous ) .",
    "for instance , one could generate a set of cycles from a simplicial complex using the persistence algorithm @xcite and then tighten them while staying in their respective homology classes .",
    "the ohcp and related problems have been widely studied in recent years both for two dimensional complexes @xcite and for higher dimensional instances @xcite .",
    "the ohcp with homology defined over the popularly used field of @xmath3 was known to be np - hard @xcite .",
    "but it was shown recently that if the homology is defined over @xmath1 , then one could solve ohcp in polynomial time when the simplicial complex has no relative torsion @xcite .",
    "the generalized decision version of the problem considering chains instead of cycles ( also termed ohcp ) was recently shown to be np - complete @xcite .",
    "instances that fall in between these two extreme cases have not been studied so far .",
    "in particular , the complexity of ohcp in the presence of relative torsion is not known .",
    "the polynomial time solvability of ohcp was shown by modeling the problem as a linear program ( lp ) , and showing that the constraint matrix of this lp is totally unimodular ( tu ) when the simplicial complex does not have any relative torsion @xcite .",
    "this connection between tu matrices and polynomial time solvability of integer programs ( ips ) by solving their associated lps is well known , e.g. , see ( * ? ? ?",
    "1921 ) . if the constraint matrix of an lp is tu , then its polyhedron is integral , i.e. , all its vertices have integral coordinates .",
    "two other concepts associated with integral polyhedra that are weaker than tu matrices are @xmath4-balanced matrices @xcite and totally dual integral ( tdi ) systems",
    "22 ) @xcite . but applications of such weaker conditions to the ohcp lp and their potential correspondences to the topology of simplicial complexes have not been explored so far .",
    "[ [ our - contributions ] ] our contributions : + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    we define a characterization of the simplicial complex termed non total - unimodularity neutralized , or ntu neutralized for short , which guarantees that even when there is relative torsion in the simplicial complex , every instance of the ohcp lp has an integer optimal solution . under this condition",
    ", the ohcp instance for any input chain with homology defined over @xmath1 could be solved in polynomial time using linear programming even when the constraint matrix of the ohcp lp is not tu .",
    "we arrive at our main result by studying the structure of the ohcp lp , and characterizing several properties of its basic solutions .",
    "recall that the vertices of an lp correspond to its basic feasible solutions .",
    "in particular , we prove that an ohcp lp for a given input chain has a fractional basic solution if and only if the ohcp lp with a component _ elementary _ chain , i.e. , a chain with a single nonzero coefficient of @xmath5 , as input has a certain fractional basic solution . using this result ,",
    "we show that no ohcp lp over the given simplicial complex has a unique fractional optimal solution if and only if every elementary chain involved in each relative torsion has a _ neutralizing chain _ in the complex , i.e. , when the simplicial complex is ntu neutralized .",
    "our result partly fills the gap between the extreme cases of the ohcp lp solving the ohcp when the complex has no relative torsion , and the ohcp being np - complete ( there could well be instances that are amenable to efficient solutions by methods distinct from solving lps ) .",
    "the condition of a complex being ntu neutralized is strictly weaker than requiring its boundary matrix to be tu , or even to be balanced .",
    "further , this condition is a property of the simplicial complex , and is independent of the input chain as well as the choice of weights on the simplices .",
    "hence a much broader class of ohcp instances can be solved in polynomial time using linear programming than previously considered possible .",
    "when the simplicial complex is ntu neutralized , the linear system in the _ dual _ of the ohcp lp is tdi .",
    "but this case does not appear to be covered by any of the currently known characterizations of tdi systems .",
    "in particular , the polytope of the ohcp lp may _ not _ be integral even when the complex is ntu neutralized .",
    "still , an integral optimal solution exists for _ every _ integral right - hand side , i.e. , for _ every _ input chain . as a special case , we show that every @xmath2-complex with trivial first homology group is guaranteed to be ntu neutralized .",
    "we illustrate the condition of a simplicial complex being ntu neutralized by describing a set of two dimensional complexes related to the mbius strip .",

    "consider the three different triangulations of a space in figure  [ fig - threecplxs ] .",
    "in the left and right complexes , we have a mbius strip self - intersecting at one ( @xmath6 ) and two vertices ( @xmath7 ) , respectively , resulting in relative torsion in both cases . in the middle",
    "complex , the self intersection is along the _ edge _ @xmath8 , hence we do not have relative torsion .",
    "hence the boundary matrix is tu only for the middle complex .",
    "still , in the right complex , the ohcp lp has an integral optimal solution for every input chain .",
    "for example , consider the edge @xmath9 ( shown in thick dashes ) with multiplier @xmath5 as the input chain .",
    "let the edge weights be as follows : dashed and dotted edges have weight @xmath5 , thin solid edges have weights of @xmath10 , and thick solid edges have weights of @xmath11 each .",
    "the dashed edges are the `` manifold '' edges in the potential mbius strip in each complex .",
    "the thin solid edges are boundary edges .",
    "the two pairs of thick solid edges are boundary edges in the candidate mbius strips , but are each shared by two triangles in the simplicial complex .",
    "solving the ohcp involves pushing the heavy manifold edge(s ) onto the light boundary edges using the boundaries of triangles . in the left complex",
    ", the unique optimal solution to the ohcp lp corresponds to all the black solid edges , which is the boundary of the mbius strip self - intersecting at vertex @xmath6 , with coefficients @xmath12 .",
    "this instance illustrates the case of minimal violation of tu we study in a general simplicial complex .",
    "the optimal homologous chain is indicated in dark gray in the middle and right complexes ( it is the same in all three complexes ) . in the right complex , there are two integral optimal solutions to the ohcp lp , which are outlined in dark and light gray .",
    "any convex combination of these two chains also corresponds to an optimal solution of the ohcp lp , including the one made of all solid edges with coefficients @xmath12 .",
    "this observation may be explained by the presence of a disk whose boundary is an odd number of dashed edges , e.g. , triangle @xmath13 , which _ neutralizes _ the mbius strip .",
    "this `` odd disk '' provides an alternative to pushing the heavy manifold edge onto all the light boundary edges by going around the entire mbius strip with fractional multipliers .",
    "instead , one could take a `` shortcut '' across the middle of the strip through the neutralizing chain , permitting integer multipliers . in this case",
    ", there also exists a complementary shortcut .",
    "the fractional solution going all the way around the strip is a convex combination of the two shortcut integral solutions .",
    "our characterization of ntu neutralization generalizes this observation to arbitrary dimensions .",
    "intuitively , a complex is ntu neutralized if there exists an `` odd disk '' providing such a shortcut across every relative torsion , for each of its `` manifold '' elementary chains ( similar to edge @xmath9 above ) .",
    "adding triangle @xmath14 to the left complex makes it ntu neutralized .",
    "for instance , @xmath15 is a disc whose boundary is @xmath16 dashed edges . alternatively , adding both triangles @xmath14 and @xmath17 to the left complex also makes it ntu neutralized . in this case , the first homology group becomes trivial , which is a sufficient condition for @xmath2-complexes to be ntu neutralized ( theorem [ thm-1_hom_triv_ntuneut ] ) .",
