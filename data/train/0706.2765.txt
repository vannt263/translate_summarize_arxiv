    "random pure quantum states , _ i.  e. _ , states whose distribution is invariant under an arbitrary unitary transformation , are almost maximally entangled .",
    "let us consider , for instance , a random state @xmath1 from @xmath2 dimensional hilbert space @xmath3 .",
    "we consider a bipartition to subsystems a and b , namely @xmath4 as an element of a tensor product hilbert space @xmath5 where @xmath6 , @xmath7 are hilbert spaces of subsystems a and b , respectively .",
    "the entanglement @xmath8 of the state @xmath1 is then measured by the von neumann entropy @xmath9 of the reduced density matrices @xmath10 or @xmath11 .",
    "it turns out @xcite that @xmath12 which is close to the maximal value @xmath13 attained for maximally entangled state .",
    "since random states carry a lot of entanglement and entanglement  @xcite has no analog in classical mechanics , one can conclude that random states are highly non - classical .",
    "on the other hand , pseudo - random states with properties close to those of true random states can be efficiently generated by dynamical systems ( maps ) in the regime of quantum chaos  @xcite . in such chaotic maps",
    "the classical limit is recovered when @xmath14 .",
    "therefore , one can argue that for high - dimensional random states , _",
    "i.e. _ , in the limit @xmath15 , the quantum expectation value of an operator with a well defined classical limit will be close to its classical microcanonical average . according to this picture random states in a way ``",
    "mimic '' classical microcanonical density .",
    "expectation values are therefore close to the classical ones .    at first sight",
    "this is in striking contrast with the almost maximal entanglement of such states .",
    "how can we reconcile this apparent contradiction ?",
    "in the present paper we are going to tackle this question by considering how can we detect entanglement of random states . by studying the detection of entanglement with decomposable entanglement witnesses we are going to argue that in the limit of large systems the detection of entanglement in a random state becomes increasingly difficult as it would demand the control of very finely interwoven degrees of freedom and a measurement resolution inversely proportional to the size of the hilbert space , which seems hardly feasible experimentally .",
    "therefore , as far as the detection of entanglement is concerned , high dimensional random states are effectively classical",
    ".    moreover , coarse graining naturally appears .",
    "for instance , one could repeat several times the measurement of the entanglement witness for a random state and the prepared random state would be different from time to time due to unavoidable experimental imperfections .",
    "we model this problem by considering mixtures of @xmath0 pure random states , namely @xmath16 where the @xmath17 are mutually independent random pure states , but in general they are not orthogonal .",
    "we are going to show that the detection of entanglement is even more difficult for these mixed states , as it requires a number of measurements growing exponentially with @xmath0 .",
    "there are other physical contexts in which formally the same kind of coarse graining ( mixing of the state ) naturally appears : ( i ) _ time averaging .",
    "_ for example , if a state @xmath4 undergoes a time evolution @xmath18 given in terms of some unitary dynamics @xmath19 , then the time average of a physical observable @xmath20 over an interval @xmath21 is essentially determined by expectation value @xmath22 in the mixed state @xmath23 which has an effective rank @xmath24 where @xmath25 is a dynamical correlation time of the dynamics @xmath19 . for a quantum chaotic evolution @xmath19 ,",
    "the state @xmath26 can be , after some time , arguably well described by a random state and the correlation time @xmath25 is expected to be short , so @xmath27 ( [ eq : rhot ] ) may be considered as a mixture ( [ eq : rho ] ) of @xmath0 uncorrelated random states .",
    "( ii ) _ phase space averaging . _",
    "sometimes it is useful to represent quantum states in terms of distribution functions in the classical phase space , like the husimi function ( see e.g. @xcite ) , which can be understood as a convolution of the wigner function or its coarse graining over a phase space volume @xmath28 in @xmath29 degreees of freedom .",
    "in fact , the husimi function of a pure state can be understood as a wigner function of the following mixed state @xmath30 where @xmath31 are unitary phase space translation operators , and @xmath32 is an arbitrary squeezing parameter .",
    "a random pure state @xmath4 has a wigner function with random sub - planck structures with phase space correlaton length @xmath33 which is semi - classically smaller than the coarse - graining width @xmath34 , so @xmath27 ( [ eq : rhop ] ) can be again considered as a mixture ( [ eq : rho ] ) of @xmath0 random pure states with @xmath35 .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : ew ] , we review known results about entanglement witnesses and pure states entanglement . depending on our a priori knowledge of the random state ,",
    "two relevant cases can be distinguished : ( i ) we do not know in advance of which random state we are going to detect the entanglement , _",
    "i.e. _ , the random state is unknown .",
    "in such a case the best one can do is to choose some generic entanglement witness in advance , independently of the state we measure .",
    "such situation can also be thought to arise in the case when we are not able to prepare an arbitrary entanglement witness but just some subset of witnesses .",
    "( ii ) we know the random state in advance and we are able to prepare an arbitrary entanglement witness . in such case",
    "we can use the optimal entanglement witness for each random state separately .",
    "these two cases are discusses in secs .",
    "[ sec : urs ] and  [ sec : krs ] , respectively . finally , in sec .",
    "[ sec : conc ] , we provide a brief discussion of our results .",
    "first of all , let us introduce some known facts about entanglement witnesses and entanglement of pure states that we will need for the derivation of our results in subsequent sections . given a pure state @xmath4 , its bipartite entanglement content is completely specified by the schmidt decomposition : @xmath36 where the schmidt coefficients @xmath37 are positive real numbers satisfying @xmath38 and @xmath39 and @xmath40 are orthonormal states on subspaces @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "the squares of the schmidt coefficients are equal to the eigenvalues of the reduced density matrices @xmath43 and @xmath44 . for such bipartition",
    "there are at most @xmath45 nonzero schmidt coefficients @xmath37 . for a state having @xmath46 roughly equal nonzero schmidt coefficients ( @xmath47 )",
    ", the reduced von neumann entropy is @xmath48 @xmath49 .",
    "for instance , the simple ( ghz ) state @xmath50 leads to two nonzero eigenvalues of @xmath43 ( @xmath51 ) , and simple schmidt vectors @xmath52 and @xmath53 , resulting in @xmath54 . on the other hand",
    ", a random pure state has all @xmath45 eigenvalues nonzero , very complicated ( random ) schmidt vectors @xmath39 and @xmath40 , and almost maximal entropy @xmath55  @xcite .",
    "note , however , that all the eigenvalues of the reduced density matrix for a bipartite random state are very small .",
    "in fact , they decrease with @xmath45 , the largest being , on average , @xmath56 while the smallest is @xmath57  @xcite .",
    "the guiding idea of this paper is that this smallness of eigenvalues and the complexity of eigenvectors should be somehow reflected in the difficulty of detecting entanglement in such a state , despite the fact that the entanglement content of a random state is large .    besides pure states",
    ", we will also be interested in the entanglement of a mixture of pure states ( [ eq : rho ] ) .",
    "a quantum state @xmath27 of a bipartite system is called separable if it can be written as @xmath58 where @xmath59 and @xmath60 are density matrices for the two subsystems .",
    "a state is entangled if it is not separable . to decide whether a given mixed state is entangled or not is a difficult problem @xcite .",
    "fortunately , there is an operational criterion which is able to detect the most useful entangled states .",
    "this is the famous positive partial transposition ( ppt ) criterion  @xcite : since separable states have positive semidefinite partial transpose in the hilbert space associated with the bipartite system , the density matrix @xmath27 has matrix elements @xmath61",
    ". the partial transpose is constructed by taking the transpose of only latin or only greek indexes ( here latin indexes refer to subsystem a and greek indexes to subsystem b ) .",
    "for instance , the partial transpose with respect to subsystem b is given by @xmath62 ] , all non - ppt states are entangled .",
    "note , however , that for dimensions higher than @xmath63 and @xmath64 there exist ppt - entangled states , known as bound entangled states @xcite .",
    "a convenient way to detect entanglement is to use the so - called entanglement witnesses  @xcite . by definition ,",
    "an entanglement witness is a hermitian operator @xmath65 such that @xmath66 for all separable states @xmath67 while there exists at least one state @xmath68 such that @xmath69 .",
    "therefore , the negative expectation value of @xmath65 is a signature of entanglement and the state @xmath68 is said to be detected as entangled by the witness @xmath65 .",
    "the concept of entanglement witness is close to experimental implementations and detection of entanglement by means of entanglement witnesses has been realized in several experiments  @xcite . because it is easier to measure a larger negative expectation value of an entanglement witness",
    ", one can argue that the detection of entanglement is easier the larger this negative value is .",
    "the expectation value of @xmath65 also provides lower bounds to various entanglement measures  @xcite .",
    "estimation of entanglement entropy by measurement of observables has been considered in  @xcite .",
    "finally , it is interesting to note that violation of bell inequalities can be rewritten in terms of nonoptimal entanglement witnesses  @xcite .    in general , classification of entanglement witnesses",
    "is a hard problem .",
    "however , much simpler is the issue with the so - called decomposable entanglement witnesses ( d - ew )  @xcite .",
    "d - ew is a witness which can be decomposed as @xmath70 that is , with positive semidefinite operators @xmath71 .",
    "d - ew can detect only non - ppt entangled states , _",
    "i.e. _ , those with negative eigenvalues of @xmath72 .",
    "they are therefore equivalent to the ppt criterion but closer to experimental implementations , as full tomographic knowledge about the state is not needed . in the present paper we are going to limit ourselves only to d - ew .",
    "general non - decomposable entanglement witness ( nd - ew ) can be written in a canonical form as @xmath73  @xcite and can also detect entangled states with ppt . finding an optimal nd - ew , for which violation of positivity is maximal ,",
    "is in general hard  @xcite .",
    "in this section we assume that the random state @xmath4 whose entanglement we would like to detect is unknown so that we are not able to use an optimal @xmath65 for a particular @xmath4 .",
    "the best one can do is to choose some fixed entanglement witness @xmath65 in advance , independently of the state .",
    "since we will be interested in the average behaviour over unitary invariant ensemble of pure random states , @xmath65 can be chosen to be random as well . that is , in the present section",
    "we are going to study detection of entanglement with a random entanglement witness , whose precise definition will be given later .",
    "what we want to calculate is the distribution of the expectation values @xmath74 for a fixed @xmath65 and an ensemble of random pure states @xmath4 . averaging over random states",
    "@xmath4 we see that the average expectation value @xmath75 is @xmath76 where @xmath77 denotes an integration over a unique @xmath78-invariant distribution of pure states @xmath4 , and we used the fact that for a random state @xmath79 we have @xmath80 .",
    "we fix normalization of the entanglement witness @xmath65 such that @xmath81 .",
    "therefore , the average expectation value @xmath75 scales @xmath82 .",
    "we therefore define the rescaled quantity @xmath83 , such that @xmath84 , independently of the dimension @xmath45 . from now on we will focus on the random variable @xmath85 , and its distribution with density @xmath86 .",
    "because operator @xmath87 in d - ew ( [ eq : dew ] ) just shifts the expectation value towards positive values , we limit ourselves to d - ew of the form @xmath88 .",
    "any positive semidefinite operator @xmath89 can be written in its eigenbasis in terms of positive eigenvalues @xmath90 , satisfying @xmath91 , and eigenvectors @xmath92 , hence @xmath93 .",
    "we will first study the case when @xmath89 is a simple rank one projector ( subsection [ subsect : qproj ] ) , that is @xmath65 is given by @xmath94 .",
    "there are two reasons why this is the most important case .",
    "first , as we will see below , optimal d - ew is always of such a `` projector '' form .",
    "second , the expectation value for a general @xmath89 can be written ( subsection [ subsect : qany ] ) as a sum of expectation values for individual eigenvectors of @xmath89 and therefore the probability distribution of @xmath85 will be a simple convolution of distributions for the case of @xmath89 being rank one .",
    "most of our theoretical results are derived for one mixing component only , @xmath95 ( i.e. for a pure random state ) , since the general result for arbitrary number @xmath0 of independent mixing components is obtained by simple convolutions as discussed in subsection [ subsect : anym ] .",
    "the entanglement witness is of the form @xmath94 , with a fixed @xmath96 , and we would like to calculate the density of probability distribution @xmath97 of its normalized expectation values @xmath85 for random pure states . this distribution can depend on the chosen @xmath96 .",
    "first few moments of the density @xmath97 can be calculated explicitly .",
    "we have already seen that @xmath84 . for higher moments we can in the leading order ( in hilbert space dimension @xmath98 ) use gaussian averages and wick contractions in order to approximate integrals over the unitary group @xcite . using @xmath99 and similarly for higher order products , we arrive , up to corrections @xmath100 , at @xmath101 here",
    "we denote by @xmath102 the @xmath103-th cumulant .",
    "we see that the average value of @xmath85 as well as the width of the distribution is @xmath104 , independently of the state @xmath96 we use for @xmath65 .",
    "while @xmath105 is a simple normalization , second moment is @xmath104 due to @xmath89 being of rank @xmath104 .",
    "if only the first two cumulants were nonzero our probability density @xmath97 would be a simple gaussian .",
    "let us first see what happens if we choose for @xmath96 a state with large schmidt rank @xmath46 ( number of nonzero eigenvalues of the reduced density matrix @xmath106 ) of order @xmath107 . using schmidt decomposition ( [ eq : sch ] ) for the state @xmath108 we can immediately write eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the hermitian operator @xmath94 .",
    "there are @xmath109 eigenvalues @xmath110 , @xmath111 , with the corresponding eigenvectors @xmath112 and @xmath45 eigenvalues @xmath113 with the corresponding eigenvectors @xmath114 . in our notation , @xmath115 , where @xmath116 if @xmath117 . using these eigenvalues",
    "one can see that the traces of powers of @xmath65 are @xmath118 because eigenvalues of @xmath119 are of order @xmath120 , we have @xmath121 , @xmath122 and so on . note that formulas ( [ eq : trw ] ) are exact up to order @xmath98 and therefore can not be used for @xmath123 and states @xmath96 with the full schmidt rank .",
    "nevertheless , we can conclude that the higher cumulants are at most @xmath124 and therefore vanish in the limit @xmath125 .",
    "therefore , for @xmath65 and @xmath96 with an increasing rank , the probability density @xmath97 converges to a gaussian in the limit @xmath14 , @xmath126 theoretical prediction ( [ eq : gauss ] ) is compared with the results of numerical simulation in figure  [ fig : gauss ] .",
    "probability to measure negative @xmath85 , _ i.e. _ , of detecting entanglement , is @xmath127 and therefore @xmath128 note that this entanglement detection probability is independent of the details of @xmath96 , provided that its schmidt rank @xmath46 is large , more precisely @xmath129",
    ".    the above gaussian form of @xmath97 can be understood also as a consequence of the central limit theorem .",
    "indeed , let us write @xmath65 in its eigenbasis , then we have , writing @xmath130 , @xmath131 denoting overlaps by @xmath132 , where @xmath133 and @xmath134 are two real numbers , we have @xmath135 for the overlap of two random states we know that the angle @xmath136 is distributed uniformly , while the amplitude ( scaled by @xmath137 ) has an exponential distribution , @xmath138 .",
    "therefore , for a given set of eigenvalues @xmath139 of @xmath119 , and assuming @xmath133 to be independent , we can calculate the distribution of @xmath85 using the above formula .",
    "it is a convolution of distributions of individual terms . in the limit",
    "@xmath140 the central limit theorem can be used , resulting in a gaussian distribution ( [ eq : gauss ] ) .",
    "for @xmath96 with a small finite schmidt rank there will be deviations from gaussian because higher cumulants of @xmath97 ( [ eq : trw ] ) will be in general nonzero also in the limit @xmath14 .",
    "the above form for @xmath85 ( [ eq : w ] ) is actually very handy for an explicit calculation of @xmath97 for @xmath96 with a small rank @xmath46 .",
    "let us take the extreme case of rank @xmath141 , where we expect strongest deviations from a gaussian .",
    "we therefore have only two nonzero eigenvalues of @xmath119 , @xmath142 and @xmath143 .",
    "assuming the overlaps @xmath133 to be independent and exponentially distributed and the angles @xmath134 to be uniform , we arrive after evaluating few convolutions at @xmath144 the distribution is a sum of exponentials . probability to detect entanglement , _",
    "i.e. _ , to measure negative value of @xmath85 is @xmath145 . as a function of @xmath146 it reaches a maximum for @xmath147 , _",
    "i.e. _ , both eigenvalues of @xmath119 are equal , where it is equal to @xmath148 ( which is less than for gaussian distribution ( [ eq : gauss ] ) ) . in figure",
    "[ fig : sch ] we compare results of numerical simulation for @xmath97 for two cases : one with @xmath147 , for which the appropriate limit of eq .",
    "( [ eq : pw_sch ] ) gives @xmath149 and the case with an almost pure @xmath119 , @xmath150 , for which the probability of detecting entanglement is @xmath151 .",
    "note that in the limit @xmath152 , _",
    "i.e. _ , of a pure product state for @xmath96 , @xmath85 will always be positive with an exponential distribution .",
    "so far we have discussed only the case when @xmath89 is a one - dimensional projector , @xmath153 . what happens if the rank of @xmath89 is larger ?",

    "if we assume @xmath158 and @xmath159 are statistically independent , so that @xmath160 and @xmath161 are uncorrelated , then the distribution of @xmath162 is given by a convolution of distributions for @xmath163 .",
