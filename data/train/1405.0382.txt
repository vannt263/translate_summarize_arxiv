    "one of the most studied subjects in the ads / cft correspondence  @xcite is holographic superconductors , which may shed light upon real word strongly coupled superconductivity .",
    "some holographic superconductor models with different symmetry of condensation have been constructed , including s - wave  @xcite , p - wave  @xcite and d - wave  @xcite .",
    "such holographic setups indeed reveal some basic properties of the real superconductors .",
    "nevertheless , most of studies in the literature focus on the case with only a single order parameter .",
    "on the other hand , there are various orders in real high temperature superconductors  @xcite .",
    "thus it is desirable to generalize the single order parameter case to multi order parameter case .",
    "indeed , the holographic framework provides us a convenient way to uncover the interaction among those orders by simply adopting dual dynamical fields in the bulk with appropriate couplings .",
    "following this strategy , several attempts on the competition of multi order parameters in the holographic superconductor models have already been made . in refs .",
    "@xcite , the authors considered the case of two competing scalar order parameters coupled to one u(1 ) gauge field in the bulk .",
    "they found the signature of a coexisting phase where both scalar order parameters appear at the same time .",
    "another holographic superconductor model with a scalar triplet charged under a su(2 ) gauge field in the bulk was built in ref .",
    "they showed that the s+p coexisting phase turns out to be thermodynamically favored once it appears .",
    "other related studies can be found in refs .",
    "@xcite . in this paper , we will study the competition mechanism between s - wave order and d - wave order .",
    "there are two acceptable holographic models describing the d - wave condensation in the literature , in which the d - wave order parameter is dual to a charged massive spin two field propagating in an asymptotically ads background .",
    "the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite first constructed a minimal gravitational model by introducing a symmetric , traceless rank - two tensor field minimally coupled to a u(1 ) gauge field in the background of the ads black hole .",
    "the d - wave condensate appears below a critical temperature via a second order phase transition , resulting in a superconducting phase with no hard gap for its optical conductivity .",
    "let us call it ckmwy d - wave model in terms of the initials of the five authors .",
    "the other holographic d - wave model was proposed soon after the first one with the same matter fields but much more complex interactions  @xcite .",
    "the phase diagram , optical conductivity , as well as fermion spectral function were investigated in detail . with a fixed gravity background ,",
    "this model has advantages such as being ghost - free and having the right propagating degrees of freedom .",
    "this model will be named as bhry d - wave model in what follows . to realize s - wave order",
    ", we will take advantage of the well known abelian - higgs model  @xcite in terms of a complex scalar field charged under a u(1 ) gauge field in the bulk .    in order to realize the condensation of s - wave order and d - wave order in one holographic model",
    ", we can simply combine the abelian - higgs model with a d - wave model .",
    "thus , we could have two holographic models with s - wave order and d - wave order .",
    "actually , we will study the competition between s - wave order and d - wave order for both cases in the probe limit where one neglects the back reaction of matter fields to the background geometry .",
    "the phase structures are given and the behaviors of the thermodynamic quantities for the s+d coexisting phase are also studied .",
    "the coexisting phase does appear in both models and is thermodynamically favored .",
    "apart from the above common features , the behavior of the ratio of superconducting charge density over the total charge density versus temperature in two models is different .",
    "we also analyze the optical conductivity of the coexisting phase and find some new features .",
    ", there also exists coexisting phase under the model parameters @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "both results are consistent with each other in that case . ]",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "first we study the competition mechanism in the s - wave + bhry d - wave model in section  [ sect : superfluid ] , by investigating including the phase transition , thermodynamics and optical conductivity .",
    "we discuss the competition between two orders for the s - wave + ckmwy d - wave model in section  [ sect : superconductor ] . we will also give a comparison between the two models .",
    "conclusions and discussions are given in section  [ sect : conclusions ] .",
    "to study the competition between s - wave and d - wave orders , let us first start with the holographic model by combining the abelian - higgs s - wave model  @xcite and bhry d - wave model  @xcite .",
    "the holographic model with a scalar field @xmath3 , a symmetric tensor field @xmath4 and a u(1 ) gauge field @xmath5 is described by the following action : @xmath6-i q_2 f_{\\mu\\nu } \\varphi^{*\\mu\\lambda } \\varphi^\\nu_\\lambda\\\\ -m_2 ^ 2\\big(|\\varphi_{\\mu\\nu}|^2-|\\varphi|^2\\big)+2r_{\\mu\\nu\\rho\\lambda } \\varphi^{*\\mu\\rho}\\varphi^{\\nu\\lambda } -r_{\\mu\\nu}\\varphi^{*\\mu\\lambda}\\varphi^\\nu_\\lambda-\\frac{1}{4 } r |\\varphi|^2 , \\end{split}\\ ] ] where @xmath7 and @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 is the riemann tensor of the background metric .",
    "@xmath3 is the scalar order and @xmath12 is the tensor order .",
    "the parameters @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the charges of the scalar and the tensor fields , respectively",
    ". one can perform a rescaling to set the charge @xmath13 of the scalar to be unity .",
    "then the phase structure of this theory is determined by the ratio @xmath15 by fixing the mass square of the scalar field @xmath16 and the mass square of the tensor field @xmath17 .",
    "we shall set @xmath18 without loss of generality in the following discussion .",

    "working in the probe limit , we choose the background metric to be the 3 + 1 dimensional ads - schwarzschild black hole with planar horizon , which reads @xmath22 where @xmath23 and the ads radius has been set to be unity .",
    "the horizon is located at @xmath24 and the hawking temperature for this black hole is @xmath25 , which is also the temperature of the dual field theory .",
    "we consider an ansatz where @xmath4 and @xmath5 depend only on the radial coordinate @xmath26 and the spatial components of @xmath4 are turned on only .",
    "according to ref .",
    "@xcite , it is consistent to turn on a single component of @xmath4 and to set other components of the gauge field except for @xmath27 to be zero .",
    "then our ansatz is @xmath28 with @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 all real functions .    with the above ansatz",
    ", the equations of motion for @xmath32 , @xmath3 and @xmath33 are given by @xmath34 here the prime denotes the derivative with respect to @xmath26 . from the above explicit equations of motion",
    ", we can easily get the s - wave or d - wave superconductivity by turning off the tensor degree of freedom @xmath33 or the scalar field @xmath3 , respectively .",
    "therefore , with this model at hand , we can study the competition mechanism between the s - wave order and d - wave order .",
    "it is easy to see that equations   has a symmetry @xmath35 under this symmetry transformation , the role of s - wave and d - wave would interchange each other . without loss of generality , here",
    "we focus on the case @xmath36 .    in order to find the solutions for all the three functions @xmath37",
    ", one must specify suitable boundary conditions both at the ads boundary and at the horizon .",
    "we demand that the matter fields near the boundary @xmath38 should behave as @xmath39 where @xmath40 and @xmath41 .   for spin two operators .",

    "note that the fall - off of @xmath3 and @xmath33 is chosen so that the dual charged operators have no deformation but can acquire expectation value spontaneously .",
    "according to the holographic dictionary , up to a normalization , the coefficients @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 and @xmath46 are interpreted as chemical potential , charge density , the expectation values of scalar operator @xmath47 and the spin two operator @xmath48 , respectively .    at the horizon , in addition to @xmath49",
    ", one must require @xmath50 in order that @xmath51 is finite at the horizon .",
    "regularity of the solution at the horizon @xmath52 requires that all the functions have finite value and admit a series expansion in terms of @xmath53 as @xmath54 by plugging the expansion   into  , one can find that there are four independent parameters at the horizon @xmath55 .",
    "note that the equations of motion   have a useful scaling symmetry @xmath56 where @xmath57 is a real positive constant .",
    "taking advantage of the above scaling symmetry , we can set @xmath58 for performing numerics .",
    "then we have three independent parameters @xmath59 , where two of them will be chosen as shooting parameters to match the asymptotic expansion . after solving the set of equations",
    ", we can obtain the condensates @xmath60 and @xmath61 , chemical potential @xmath43 and charge density @xmath44 by reading off the corresponding coefficients in , respectively .",
    "the normal phase in the dual field theory is characterized by the vanishing vacuum expectation values of both condensates , which corresponds to vanishing scalar field @xmath3 and spin two tensor field @xmath33 in the bulk .",
    "the gravity background describing the normal phase can be solved exactly , which reads @xmath62      before solving the set of coupled equations   numerically , we make a briefly qualitative analysis on the possible phases for such a model . following ref .",
    "@xcite , we rephrase the equations for the s - wave and d - wave as a potential problem .",
    "it is convenient to work in the z - coordinate where @xmath63 . in this coordinate ,",
    "the infinite boundary is now at @xmath64 , while the horizon is at @xmath65 . with the transformation @xmath66 and @xmath67 ,",
    "the evolution equations for s - wave and d - wave in equations   can be rewritten as follows @xmath68 where @xmath69 and @xmath70 .    after introducing a new variable @xmath71 ,",
    "the above equations   can be further expressed as @xmath72 where @xmath73 with @xmath74 as @xmath75 and @xmath76 as @xmath77 .",
    "now in terms of the new variable @xmath71 , the equations of motion for s - wave and d - wave are rephrased as a potential problem on a semi infinite line , i.e. , @xmath78 .",
    "we will analyze this potential problem in detail case by case .",
    "our discussion is base upon the lemma proven in ref .",
    "@xcite : for two potentials @xmath79 and @xmath80 over the same domain with @xmath81 , the lowest eigenvalue of @xmath79 would be strictly greater than the lowest eigenvalue of @xmath80 .",
    "the lemma implies that if the lowest eigenvalue mode for @xmath80 is a zero mode and then @xmath79 can not have a bound state or a zero mode .",
    "note that we focus on the case @xmath36 and have set @xmath18 .      in this case , no matter which gauge field configuration we choose , we always have @xmath83 , which implies that a zero mode of s - wave should form before a zero mode of d - wave . although the condensate of s - wave changes the gauge field profile , according to the lemma , with the modified gauge potential @xmath83 and a s - wave has a node - less condensate , no zero mode or bound state of d - wave exists .",
    "that is to say , in the phase with s - wave condensed yet , the d - wave can not condense .",
    "therefore the phase structure of the system is the same as that of s - wave holographic superconductor with a single scalar .",
    "this case is much more complicated .",
    "one may expect that the d - wave field with large charge @xmath14 will always dominate .",
    "however , the potential @xmath85 diverges like @xmath86 near the boundary @xmath87 when we lower the temperature   matters .",
    "lowering the temperature is equivalent to increasing the chemical potential . here",
    "we choose to vary the temperature and keep the chemical potential fixed through the whole paper . ] .",
    "therefore , lowering the temperature possibly makes the mass dependent potential more important and hence the s - wave tends to dominate .",
    "we will confirm this with the numerical calculation .",
    "our main purpose is to observe the phase diagram of the model in terms of temperature and the charge of the tensor field @xmath14 .   as the ratio of charges between the tensor field and the scalar field . ]",
    "we set the mass square @xmath0 and @xmath88 in this paper .",
    "we expect that the model would admit three different superconducting phases .",
    "the first superconducting phase corresponds to the pure s - wave with @xmath89 and @xmath90 .",
    "the second one is the pure d - wave with @xmath91 and @xmath92 .",
    "the third superconducting phase admits the coexisting of the s - wave and d - wave orders .",
    "here we take @xmath93 as a typical example .",
    "the condensations for pure s - wave and pure d - wave superconducting phases are depicted in figure  [ sd ] .",
    "as we lower the temperature , the normal phase becomes unstable to developing scalar / tensor hair at a certain critical temperature @xmath94 .",
    "for the given charge , one can see that the critical temperature of pure s - wave is lower than the one for the d - wave case .",
    "thus when we lower the temperature , the d - wave order phase should first appear .",
    "once the d - wave order appears , if one goes on lowering the temperature , an interesting question arises : whether the other condensate happens or not ?",
    "the left plot shows the condensate as a function of temperature for the pure s - wave phase and the right plot is for the condensate of the pure d - wave phase .",
    "when one lowers the temperature , the s - wave order or d - wave order emerges at a critical temperature.,title=\"fig : \" ]  the left plot shows the condensate as a function of temperature for the pure s - wave phase and the right plot is for the condensate of the pure d - wave phase . when one lowers the temperature , the s - wave order or d - wave order emerges at a critical temperature.,title=\"fig : \" ]      condensate of the operators in the s+d coexisting phase .",
    "the blue curve is for the condensate of the d - wave operator , while the red curve is for the s - wave operator .",
    "we see that the d - wave order first condenses , then both orders coexist , finally the d - wave order disappears , leaving only the s - wave order.,title=\"fig : \" ]     our numerical results confirm that the model does admit the coexistence region of two orders with different symmetry , which is drawn in figure  [ co ] .",
    "we can see that as one lowers the temperature , the d - wave order first condenses at @xmath94 where the superconducting phase transition happens .",
    "when we continue lowering the temperature to a certain value , say @xmath95 , the s - wave order begins to condense , while the condensate of d - wave order decreases , resulting in the state with both orders ; if one further lowers the temperature , the d - wave condensate quickly goes to zero at a temperature at @xmath96 .",
    "when temperature is lower than @xmath96 , there exists only the s - wave order . the coexisting phase with both s - wave order and d - wave order can only appear in a narrow range @xmath97 .    based on the above discussion , we have totally three different superconducting phases in our model . in order to determine which phase",
    "is thermodynamically favored , we should compare the free energy of the system for each phase . here",
    "we will work in grand canonical ensemble , where the chemical potential is fixed . in the gauge / gravity duality the grand potential @xmath98 of the boundary thermal state",
    "is identified with temperature times the on - shell bulk action with euclidean signature .",
    "because we work in the probe limit , we only need to consider the contribution from the matter fields to the free energy .",
    "the gibbs free energy can be expressed as @xmath99 where @xmath100 .",
    "the left plot shows the difference of gibbs free energy between the superconducting phase and the normal phase .",
    "the blue curve is for the d - wave phase , the green line is for the s - wave phase , while the red curve is for the s+d coexisting phase .",

    "the free energy for the d - wave phase is lower when @xmath101 , while the free energy for the s - wave is lower when @xmath102 . when @xmath103 , the s+d coexisting phase has the lowest free energy , indicating that once the s+d phase exists , it is thermodynamically favored . as we know , there is only a small window admitting the two orders to coexist . outside the region",
    ", it reduces to phases with only a single order .",
    "this means that the system is dominated by the d - wave order when @xmath101 , while dominated by the s - wave order when @xmath102 .",

    "once the coexisting solution exists , it is thermodynamically favored , compared to the pure s - wave and pure d - wave phases .",
    "next we give a further investigation on the @xmath104 coexisting phase .",
    "we study the behavior of the charge density and the ratio of the superconducting charge over the total charge density @xmath105 with respect to the temperature .",
    "our numerical results are summarized in figure  [ rho ] and  [ ratio_1 ] .    from figure",
    "[ rho ] , it can be seen clearly that there exist three particular points at which the derivative of the charge density with respect to temperature is discontinuous , indicating a second order phase transition .",
    "the one with the highest temperature is the critical point for the superconducting phase transition , while the remaining two points are inside the superconducting phase , indicating the appearance and disappearance of coexisting phase .     the ratio of the superconducting charge density over the total charge density @xmath105 versus temperature .",
    "the red curve describes the ratio @xmath105 when the system transfers from the d - wave phase to the s - wave phase through the s+d coexisting phase .",

    "this spike may indicate the existence of a bound state  @xcite .",

    "let us first make a qualitative discussion from the side of the free energy . since we fix @xmath137 and @xmath138 and set @xmath18 , the critical temperature from the normal phase to the s - wave superconducting phase is fixed , while the critical temperature for the d - wave superconducting transition is proportional to @xmath14 . for sufficiently large @xmath14 ,",

    "on the other hand , for small enough @xmath14 , the s - wave order condenses before the d - wave order .",
    "as one lowers @xmath14 , the critical temperature of d - wave order decreases and the free energy of the d - wave order becomes higher and higher and will finally be always larger than the one for the s - wave condensate .",

    ", the free energy for s - wave case and the one for d - wave case has an intersection at some temperature .",
    "if no new phase appears , there should be a first order phase transition from one order to the other order .",
    "nevertheless , the competition between two orders results in the state with both orders coexisting near the crossing point ( see figure  [ co ] ) .    to summarize , in the @xmath139 phase diagram , the phase boundary between the pure s - wave phase and normal phase should be a line parallel to the @xmath14 axis , and the line separating the pure d - wave phase from normal phase is a straight line passing through the original point @xmath140 .",

    "we find that this s+d coexisting phase has the lowest free energy and is thus thermodynamically preferred to the s - wave phase and d - wave phase . in more detail ,",

    "<S> we study competition between s - wave order and d - wave order through two holographic superconductor models . we find that once the coexisting phase appears , it is always thermodynamically favored , and that the coexistence phase is narrow and one condensate tends to kill the other . the phase diagram is constructed for each model in terms of temperature and the ratio of charges of two orders . </S>",
    "<S> we further compare the behaviors of some thermodynamic quantities , and discuss the different aspects and identical ones between two models . </S>"
