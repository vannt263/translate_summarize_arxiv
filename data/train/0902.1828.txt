    "in view of new experimental challenges - such as tiny massive neutrinos and their oscillations or extra - neutral gauge bosons , to mention but a few - the standard model ( sm ) @xcite - @xcite - based on the gauge group @xmath1 that undergoes in its electro - weak sector a spontaneous symmetry breakdown ( ssb ) up to the electromagnetic universal one @xmath2 - has to be properly extended .",
    "one of the first and most popular such extensions - designed initially to address another puzzle of the particle physics , namely the parity non - conservation in weak interactions - was proposed in mid 70 s by pati , salam , mohapatra and senjanovic @xcite - @xcite and is known as the ( minimal ) `` left - right symmetric @xmath3 model '' for electro - weak sector . regarding the quark sector , which is subject to the strong interaction , the `` color '' gauge group @xmath4 was replaced by @xmath5 .",
    "the so called pati - salam model @xcite favors phenomenological consequences , such as violation of the barion - lepton number in quark and proton decays and the appearance of the exotic gauge mesons in semileptonic processes .",
    "however , in the last decade , a new direction has emerged in the literature , now being widely exploited .",
    "it resides in replacing the gauge group @xmath6 in the electro - weak sector by the new @xmath7 .",
    "therefore , the gauge symmetry @xmath8 ( hereafter 3 - 4 - 1 model ) was championed in a series of papers @xcite - @xcite with notable results . according to the charge assignment ,",
    "different classes of 3 - 4 - 1 models were obtained by resorting to particular methods @xcite - @xcite for discriminating among the models .",
    "it is worth noticing that both kinds of extensions above mentioned seem to have common points , as it was recently emphasized in refs .",
    "plausible phenomenology can occur since , for instance , the partial unification @xmath9 is broken down to `` minimal left - right '' symmetric model @xmath3 either by four - dimensional higgs mechanism or by inner or outer automorphisms orbifolding in five dimensions @xcite .    here",
    "we deal with a particular class of 3 - 4 - 1 models , namely the one including exotic electric charges @xcite - @xcite and solve it by using the exact algebraical approach @xcite designed for solving gauge models with high symmetries .",
    "our main purpose is to obtain for the boson sector a one - parameter mass scale to be tuned in order to match the data obtained at lhc , lep , cdf @xcite .",
    "this goal is achieved by simply imposing a plausible physical criterion on the resulting mass matrix .",
    "that is , in the low energy limit of the model , the third neutral ( diagonal ) boson has to be decoupled by the other two , since it comes from a higher breaking scale .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : sec.2 briefly presents the main steps of the general method of solving gauge models with high symmetries , while sec.3 deals with the 3 - 4 - 1 gauge model of interest which is treated by using the above mentioned method . at the same time",
    ", some estimates are given for different values of the free parameter @xmath10 in the resulting boson mass spectrum .",
    "sec 4 sketches our conclusions .",
    "in this section we recall the main results of the general method @xcite of treating @xmath11 electro - weak gauge models , in which a particular higgs mechanism - based on a special parametrization of the scalar sector - is embedded in order to properly break the symmetry .      in our general approach ,",
    "the basic piece involved in the gauge symmetry is the group @xmath12 .",
    "its two fundamental irreducible unitary representations ( irreps ) @xmath13 and @xmath14 play a crucial role in constructing different classes of tensors of ranks @xmath15 as direct products like @xmath16 .",
    "these tensors have @xmath17 lower and @xmath18 upper indices for which we reserve the notation , @xmath19 . as",
    "usually , we denote the irrep @xmath20 of @xmath12 by indicating its dimension , @xmath21 .",
    "the @xmath22 algebra can be parameterized in different ways , but here it is convenient to use the hybrid basis of ref .",
    "@xcite consisting of @xmath23 diagonal generators of the cartan subalgebra , @xmath24 , labeled by indices @xmath25 ranging from @xmath26 to @xmath23 , and the generators @xmath27 , @xmath28 , related to the off - diagonal real generators @xmath29 @xcite .",
    "this way the elements @xmath30 are now parameterized by @xmath23 real parameters , @xmath31 , and by @xmath32 @xmath33-number ones , @xmath34 , for @xmath28 .",
    "the advantage of this choice is that the parameters @xmath35 can be directly associated to the @xmath33-number gauge fields due to the factor @xmath36 which gives their correct normalization .",
    "in addition , this basis exhibit good trace orthogonality properties , @xmath37 when we consider different irreps , @xmath20 of the @xmath22 algebra we denote @xmath38 for each @xmath39 such that the corresponding basis - generators of the irrep @xmath20 are @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "the @xmath42 transformations are nothing else but phase factor multiplications",
    ". therefore - since the coupling constants @xmath43 for @xmath44 and @xmath45 for the @xmath42 are assinged - the transformation of the fermion tensor @xmath46 with respect to the gauge group of the theory reads @xmath47 where @xmath48 and @xmath49 is the chiral hypercharge defining the irrep of the @xmath42 group parametrized by @xmath50 . for simplicity",
    ", the general method deals with the character @xmath51 instead of the chiral hypercharge @xmath49 , but this mathematical artifice does not affect in any way the results .",
    "therefore , the irreps of the whole gauge group @xmath11 are uniquely detemined by indicating the dimension of the @xmath12 tensor and its character @xmath52 as @xmath53 .    in general ,",
    "the spinor sector of our models has at least a part ( usually the leptonic one ) which is put in pure left form using the charge conjugation .",
    "consequently this includes only left components , @xmath54 , that transform according to an arbitrary reducible representation of the gauge group .",
    "the lagrangian density ( ld ) of the free spinor sector has the form @xmath55 bearing in mind that each left - handed multiplet transforms as @xmath56 we understand that @xmath57 remains invariant under the global @xmath11 transformations if the blocks @xmath58 transform like @xmath59 , according to the representations @xmath60 which generally are reducible",
    ". these blocks will give rise to the yukawa couplings of the fermions with the higgs fields .",
    "the spinor sector is coupled to the standard yang - mills sector constructed in usual manner by gauging the @xmath11 symmetry . to this end",
    "we introduce the gauge fields @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",
    "furthermore , the ordinary derivatives are replaced in eq .",
    "( [ eq.3 ] ) by the covariant ones , defined as @xmath63 thus arriving to the interaction terms of the spinor sector .",
    "the scalar sector , organized as the so called minimal higgs mechanism ( mhm ) @xcite , is flexible enough to produce the ssb and , consequently , generate masses for the plethora of particles and bosons in the model .",
    "the scalar sector consists of @xmath64 higgs multiplets @xmath65 , @xmath66 , ... @xmath67 satisfying the orthogonality condition @xmath68 in order to eliminate the unwanted goldstone bosons that could survive the ssb .",
    "@xmath69 is a gauge - invariant real scalar field while the higgs multiplets @xmath70 transform according to the irreps @xmath71 whose characters @xmath72 are arbitrary numbers that can be organized into the diagonal matrix @xmath73 the higgs sector needs , in our approach , a parameter matrix @xmath74 with the property @xmath75 .",
    "it will play the role of the metric in the kinetic part of the higgs ld which reads @xmath76 where @xmath77 are the covariant derivatives of the model and @xmath78 is the scalar potential generating the ssb of the gauge symmetry @xcite . this is assumed to have an absolute minimum for @xmath79 that is , @xmath80 where @xmath81 is the unique surviving physical higgs field .",
    "therefore , one can always define the unitary gauge where the higgs multiplets , @xmath82 have the components @xmath83    this will be of great importance when the fermion masses will be computed , due to the fact that the fermion mass terms - provided by eq .",
    "( [ eq.3 ] ) via this mhm - exhibit the yukawa traditional form only when the theory is boosted towards the unitary gauge .",
    "a crucial goal is now to find the physical neutral bosons with well - defined properties .",
    "this must start with the separation of the electromagnetic potential @xmath84 corresponding to the surviving @xmath2 symmetry .",
    "we have shown that the one - dimensional subspace of the parameters @xmath85 associated to this symmetry assumes a particular direction in the parameter space @xmath86 of the whole cartan subalgebra .",
    "this is uniquely determined by the @xmath23 - dimensional unit vector @xmath87 and the angle @xmath88 giving the subspace equations @xmath89 and @xmath90 . on the other hand , since the higgs multiplets in unitary gauge remain invariant under @xmath2 transformations , we must impose the obvious condition @xmath91 which yields @xmath92 in other words , the new parameters @xmath93 determine all the characters @xmath72 of the irreps of the higgs multiplets . for this reason",
    "these will be considered the principal parameters of the model and therefore one deals with @xmath88 and @xmath87 ( which has @xmath94 independent components ) instead of @xmath23 parameters @xmath72 .    under these circumstances",
    ", the generating mass term @xmath95\\,,\\label{eq.9}\\ ] ] depends now on the parameters @xmath88 and @xmath96 . the neutral bosons in eq .",
    "[ eq.9 ] being the electromagnetic field @xmath84 and the @xmath23 new ones , @xmath97 , which are the diagonal bosons remaining after the separation of the electromagnetic potential @xcite .",
    "this term straightforwardly gives rise to the masses of the non - diagonal gauge bosons @xmath98}\\,,\\label{eq.10}\\ ] ] while the masses of the neutral bosons @xmath97 have to be calculated by diagonalizing the matrix @xmath99 where @xmath100 as it was expected , @xmath84 does not appear in the mass term and , consequently , it remains massless .",
    "the other neutral gauge fields @xmath101 have the non - diagonal mass matrix ( [ eq.11 ] ) .",
    "this can be brought in diagonal form with the help of a new @xmath102 transformation , @xmath103 , which leads to the physical neutral bosons @xmath104 with well - defined masses .",
    "performing this @xmath102 transformation the physical neutral bosons are completely determined .",
    "the transformation @xmath105 which switches from the original diagonal gauge fields , @xmath106 to the physical ones , @xmath107 is called the generalized weinberg transformation ( gwt ) .",
    "the next step is to identify the charges of the particles with the coupling coefficients of the currents with respect to the above determined physical bosons .",
    "thus , we find that the spinor multiplet @xmath46 ( of the irrep @xmath20 ) has the following electric charge matrix @xmath108,\\label{eq.14}\\ ] ] and the @xmath23 neutral charge matrices @xmath109\\omega_{\\cdot\\;\\hat{i}}^{\\hat{k}\\;\\cdot}\\label{eq.15}\\ ] ] corresponding to the @xmath23 neutral physical fields , @xmath104 .",
    "all the other gauge fields , namely the charged bosons @xmath110 , have the same coupling , @xmath111 , to the fermion multiplets .",
    "the general method - constructed in ref .",
    "@xcite and briefly presented in the above section - is based on the following assumptions in order to give viable results when it is applied to concrete models :    \\(i ) the spinor sector must be put ( at least partially ) in pure left form using the charge conjugation ( see for details appendix b in ref .",
    "@xcite )    \\(ii ) the minimal higgs mechanism - with arbitrary parameters @xmath112 satisfying the condition @xmath113 and giving rise to traditional yukawa couplings in unitary gauge - must be employed    \\(iii ) the coupling constant , @xmath43 , is the same with the first one of the sm    \\(iv ) at least one @xmath114-like boson should satisfy the mass condition @xmath115 established in the sm and experimentally confirmed .",
    "bearing in mind all these necessary ingredients , we proceed to solving the particular 3 - 4 - 1 model @xcite - @xcite by imposing from the very beginning the set of parameters we will work with .      in what follows",
    "we denote the irreps of the electro - weak model under consideration here by @xmath116 indicating the genuine chiral hypercharge @xmath49 instead of @xmath52 .",
    "therefore , the multiplets of the 3 - 4 - 1 model of interest here will be denoted by @xmath117 .    with this notation , after little algebra involving eqs .",
    "( [ eq.14 ] ) - ( [ eq.15 ] ) and the versor setting @xmath118 , @xmath119 , @xmath120 - case 1 in ref .",
    "@xcite , one finds the following irreps of the spinor sector :    * * lepton families**@xmath121    * * quark families**@xmath122 @xmath123 @xmath124 with @xmath125 and @xmath126 . with this , the conditions ( i ) and ( iii ) are fulfilled .",
    "in addition , the connection between the @xmath88 angle of our method and @xmath127(the weinberg angle from sm ) was inferred @xcite : @xmath128 along with the coupling relation : @xmath129 .    in the representations presented above we assumed , like in majority of the papers in the literature , that the third generation of quarks transforms differently from the other two ones .",
    "this could explain the unusual heavy masses of the third generation of quarks , and especially the uncommon properties of the top quark .",
    "the capital letters @xmath130 denote the exotic quarks included in each family . with this assignment",
    "the fermion families cancel all the axial anomalies by just an interplay between them , although each family remains anomalous by itself .",
    "note that one can add at any time sterile neutrinos - _ i.e. _ right - handed neutrinos @xmath131 - that could pair in the neutrino sector of the ld with left - handed ones in order to eventually generate tiny dirac or majorana masses by means of an adequate see - saw mechanism .",
    "these sterile neutrinos do not affect anyhow the anomaly cancelation , since all their charges are zero .",
    "moreover , their number is not restricted by the number of flavors in the model .",
    "subsequently , we will use the standard generators @xmath132 of the @xmath133 algebra . under these circumstances ,",
    "the hermitian diagonal generators of the cartan subalgebra are , in order , @xmath134 , @xmath135 , and @xmath136 respectively . in this basis , the gauge fields are @xmath137 and @xmath138 , that is @xmath139 with neutral diagonal bosons : @xmath140 , @xmath141 , @xmath142 , and @xmath143 respectively",
    ".    apart from the charged weinberg bosons , @xmath144 , there are new charged bosons , @xmath145 , @xmath146 , @xmath147 , @xmath148 and @xmath149 .",
    "note that @xmath147 is doubly charged coupling different chiral states of the same charged lepton ( the so called  bilepton  ) , while @xmath149 is neutral .",
    "the masses of both the neutral and charged bosons depend on the choice of the matrix @xmath150 whose components are free parameters . here",
    "it is convenient to assume the following matrix @xmath151 where , for the moment , @xmath10,@xmath152 and @xmath33 are arbitrary non - vanishing real parameters .",
    "obviously , @xmath153 , @xmath154 and @xmath155 .",
    "note that with this parameter choice the condition ( ii ) is accomplished .    under these circumstances , the mass spectrum of the off - diagonal bosons according to ( [ eq.10 ] )",
    "are @xmath156 while the mass matrix of the neutral bosons is given by eq .",
    "( [ eq.11 ] ) @xmath157 with @xmath158 throughout this paper . in order to fulfil the requirement ( iv )",
    ", the above matrix has to admit @xmath159 as eigenvalue .",
    "now , one can enforce some other phenomenological assumptions .",
    "first of all , it is natural to presume that the third neutral ( diagonal boson ) @xmath160 should be considered much heavier than its companions , so that it decouples form their mixing as the symmetry is broken to @xmath161 . for this purpose",
    "a higher breaking scale is responsable , that at the same time supplies mass to @xmath160 .",
    "therefore one can well consider @xmath162 in the matrix ( [ eq.30 ] ) .",
    "this gives rise to the condition    @xmath163    which naturally leads to @xmath164 in order to vanish the above terms .",
    "hence , with the plausible physical condition assumed , eq .",
    "( [ eq.30 ] ) looks like    @xmath165    let us observe that the condition ( iv ) - @xmath166 - is fulfilled if and only if @xmath167 , resulting from diagonalization of the remaning part of the matrix ( [ eq.33 ] ) .",
    "therefore , one finally remains with only one parameter - say @xmath10 .",
    "in addition , for there are terms which become singular for @xmath168 which corresponds to the value @xmath169 the weinberg angle is restricted in our model so that @xmath170 less than @xmath171 , which is in good accord to experimental measurements on it @xcite .    obviously , @xmath114 is the neutral boson of the sm , while @xmath172 is a new neutral boson of this model ( also occuring in 3 - 3 - 1 models ) whose mass comes form @xmath173 .",

    "obviously , parameter @xmath10 has now to be upper limited , so that @xmath176 in order to have only positive values for the above experessions of the squared boson masses .",
    "in order to allow for a high breaking scale in the model @xmath177tev and keep at the same time consistency with low energy phenomenology of the sm our solution favors the case with @xmath178 and @xmath179 .",
    "however , assuming that @xmath180gev and @xmath181gev and @xmath182 ( values taken from pdg 2008 - ref.@xcite ) , our approach predicts the exact masses at tree level for the following bosons ( according to eqs .",
    "( [ eq.35 ] ) , ( [ eq.36 ] ) and ( [ eq.41 ] ) ) : @xmath183gev , @xmath184gev and @xmath185gev .",
    "note that all these results are independent of the unique mass scale of the model ( @xmath186 in our notation ) .",
    ".boson masses [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the more heavier bosons are - roughly speaking - in the following hierarchy mass @xmath187 for small values of the parameter @xmath10 . if one desires a more detailed estimate for the latter bosons , depending on the possible values of the free parameter ( and consequently on the mass scale ) , we present a plot of their masses dependence on @xmath10 for a given @xmath186 .",
    "that is , we represented the functions @xmath188 , @xmath189 , @xmath190 and @xmath191 ( see figure ) .",
    "if the mass scale of the model ( @xmath186 in our notation ) , lies in the tev region - which is the current energy involved in lhc data - or even in a higher one , the three latter masses become almost degenerate . more precisely , if @xmath192tev , from eq.([eq.34 ] ) @xmath193 is inferred . hence , @xmath194tev and @xmath195tev , @xmath196tev and @xmath197tev . furthermore , if the mass scale reaches gut energies ( specific to some see - saw mechanism ) these bosons - as expected - become degenerate .",
    "we refer the reader to the following table for some numerical results in the boson sector of the given 3 - 4 - 1 model .",
    "a more accurate estimate for the masses of these bosons and the relations among them ( by a more apropriate tuning of parameter @xmath10 ) will come , once the experimental evidence of their phenomenology will be definitely bring to light at lhc , lep , cdf and other high energy accelerators in a near future .",
    "in this work the boson mass spectrum of a 3 - 4 - 1 model with exotic electric charges has been worked out within the framework of the general method for solving gauge models with high symmetries @xcite and analyzed by just tuning a unique free parameter @xmath10 . in our approach",
    "the latter is close related to the mass scale ( and thus on the overall breaking scale @xmath175 ) in the manner @xmath198(gev ) .",
    "plausible phenomenological predictions were made at a reasonable scale arround @xmath26tev to be confronted by data supplied by lhc , lep , cdf and other colliders .",
    "the method used is flexible enough in order to allow even a different higgs mechanism which could consist in re - defining the scalar multiplets in the manner @xmath199 in order to match the traditional approach , with each new @xmath70 responsable for one particular step in breaking the symmetry .",
    "one can further investigate this model by calculating the neutral currents and specific decays , the oblique corrections @xmath200 @xcite , or conceive a suitable see - saw mechanism in order to generate tiny masses for neutrinos . breaking down the symmetry to the left - right pati - salam purposal",
    "@xcite is also a worthy way for further theoretical investigations . all these , however , are beyond the scope of this paper and will be treated in a future work .",
