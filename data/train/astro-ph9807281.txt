    "in the past two years the rossi x - ray timing explorer ( rxte ) has discovered kilohertz quasi - periodic oscillations ( khz qpos ) in eighteen low - mass x - ray binaries ( lmxb ; see van der klis @xcite for a review ) . in almost all cases",
    "the power density spectra of these sources show twin khz peaks that move up and down in frequency together as a function of mass accretion rate , keeping a separation consistent with being constant ( e.g. , strohmayer et al .",
    "@xcite ; wijnands et al .",
    "@xcite ; ford et al .",
    "@xcite ) . in some sources",
    "a third qpo peak has been detected during type - i x - ray bursts , at a frequency consistent with the frequency separation of the twin peaks ( strohmayer et al .",
    "@xcite ) or twice that value ( smith , morgan , & bradt @xcite ; wijnands & van der klis @xcite ; zhang et al . @xcite ; wijnands et al .",
    "@xcite ) , indicating a beat - frequency interpretation .",
    "the third peak , while not strictly constant in frequency but varying by up to 0.4% , has been interpreted as being close to the neutron star spin frequency ( strohmayer et al .",
    "@xcite ) .    until recently",
    ", sco x1 stood out as the only example where the separation between the two simultaneous khz qpos was not constant , but varied by 40% ( van der klis et al .",
    "@xcite ) as the mass accretion rate increased , posing a serious challenge to the simple beat - frequency interpretation . using data of the 1996 outburst , and a new technique to increase the sensitivity to weak qpos , mndez et al .",
    "( @xcite ) found the second of the twin peaks in 4u 160852 , and presented evidence for similar variations by 26% of the peak separation in this source , although only significant at the @xmath2 level .",
    "in this paper we report on the results from recent rxte observations obtained during the decay of the 1998 outburst of 4u 160852 .",
    "we observed again two qpos , and show conclusively that the peak separation in 4u 160852 changes by more than 40% .",
    "the changes are remarkably similar to those seen in sco x1 .",
    "we used the proportional counter array ( pca ) onboard rxte to observe 4u 160852 between february 6 and april 25 1998 .",
    "the observations were triggered at the peak of the outburst , as measured by the rxte all sky monitor ( asm ) experiment , and were planned to sample the source over the whole decay of the outburst .",
    "the data set consists of 40 observations , each of them with exposures between 600 s and 19,980 s , and a total observing time of 191 ks . figure [ asm ] shows the asm light curve during the outburst , where we indicate the dates when we carried out the pointed pca observations .    beside the two standard modes that are available to all rxte - pca observations , we collected data using additional modes with high time , and moderate energy resolution , covering the nominal @xmath3 kev energy band of the rxte - pca .",
    "we also included a set of burst trigger and catcher modes to record burst data at high time and energy resolution .",
    "we recorded 3 type - i x - ray bursts .",
    "a timing analysis of these data revealed no burst oscillation , with 95% confidence upper limits to the amplitude of 6% rms at the peak of the bursts , and 20% at the beginning or the end .",
    "we used the standard 2 data and the standard pca background model ( stark et al .",
    "@xcite ) for the spectral analysis .",
    "first we divided the data into 4 energy bands , @xmath4 kev , and constructed a color - color and hardness - intensity diagram . based on the spectral data , and on the power density spectra ( described below ) in the range @xmath5 hz",
    ", we conclude that 4u 160852 slowly moved from the upper banana , through the lower banana to the island state ( hasinger & van der klis @xcite ) as the @xmath3 kev count rate decayed from @xmath6 c / s to @xmath7 c / s .",
    "we also produced background subtracted x - ray spectra that were well fitted by means of a model consisting of a blackbody and a power law with a high - energy cut - off . assuming a distance of 3.6 kpc ( nakamura et al .",
    "@xcite ) , during our observations the @xmath8 kev luminosity of 4u 160852 decayed from @xmath9 erg s@xmath10 at the highest count rate , to @xmath11 erg s@xmath10 at the lowest count rate .",
    "details of the spectral fits , color - color diagrams and the analysis of the low frequency part of the power spectra will be presented elsewhere .",
    "we divided the high - time resolution data into segments of 64 s , and calculated a power spectrum for each segment preserving the maximum available nyquist frequency .",
    "for each of the 40 observations we produced an average power spectrum that we searched for qpos at frequencies above @xmath12 hz .",
    "none of the observations obtained before march 23 showed any qpo in this frequency range .",
    "the 95% confidence upper limits on the amplitude for a peak with a fwhm of 10 , 50 , and 100 hz were 0.8% , 1.2% , and 1.6% rms , respectively on february 6 , and 2.0% , 3.8% , and 4.6% rms , respectively on march 19 . starting on march 23 , when the luminosity of the source ( @xmath13 kev ) had dropped to @xmath14 erg s@xmath10 , we detected qpo peaks in 12 observations ( fig .",
    "[ asm ] ) , at frequencies between 400 and 1000 hz . in 5 observations",
    ", this straight fourier analysis revealed two simultaneous qpos , while in the remaining 7 observations we only detected one qpo peak . in fig .",
    "[ figps ] we show an example of an observation where we detected two simultaneous qpos at @xmath15 hz ( hereafter the lower qpo ) , and at @xmath16 hz ( hereafter the upper qpo ) .    for those 7 observations where we only detected a single peak in the average power spectrum we applied the same technique we described in mndez et al .",
    "( @xcite ) .",
    "we fitted the central frequency of the qpo in each segment of 64 s ( or longer when occasionally we had to average some of the 64 s segments to detect the qpo ) , and then shifted the frequency scale of each spectrum to a frame of reference where the position of the peak was constant in time .",
    "finally , we averaged these shifted power spectra .",
    "this procedure revealed a second qpo in 5 of those 7 observations , in 3 occasions at higher frequencies , and in 2 observations at lower frequencies than those of the peak originally used to align the individual power spectra .",
    "for the 2 remaining observations ( march 31 and april 5 ) we did not detect a second peak . the 95% confidence upper limits on the amplitude of a second ( undetected ) qpo with a fwhm of 10 hz , 50 hz , and 100 hz were 3.5% , 4.7% , and 5.3% rms , respectively on march 31 , and 5.2% , 8.1% , and 10% rms , respectively on april 5 .    for the observation of march 25 , when the two qpos were more or less equally strong ,",
    "we measured their fwhm in three energy bands , @xmath17 kev ; the width of the lower and upper peak were @xmath18 hz , and @xmath19 hz , with no significant dependence on energy .",
    "in the rest of this paper we only present the results of the analysis of those data where , either directly or with shifts , we detected two simultaneous khz qpos in the power spectrum .",
    "these are 10 observations of the 1998 outburst ( fig .",
    "[ asm ] , filled circles ) , plus 2 observations of the 1996 outburst ( march 3 and 6 ; mndez et al .",
    "@xcite ) , yielding a total of 1,336 power spectra each of them of 64 s of data . during these observations",
    "the @xmath20 kev fractional amplitudes of the lower and upper qpo varied from 5.3% to 9.1% rms , and from 3.3% to 8.8% rms , respectively , and the fwhm varied from 4.3 hz to 9.4 hz , and from 53 hz to 173 hz , respectively .",
    "we aligned all the 1,336 power spectra using the lower qpo as a reference , and we grouped the data in 13 sets of @xmath21 to @xmath22 power spectra , such that the frequency of the qpo did not vary by more than @xmath23 hz within each set . finally , we combined these aligned spectra to produce an average power spectrum for each set .",
    "we fitted all these 13 power spectra in the range @xmath24 hz using a function consisting of a constant , representing the poisson noise , and two lorentzians , representing the qpos .",
    "the fits were good , with reduced @xmath25 , and the significance of both peaks was always @xmath26 . in figure [ figdif ]",
    "we plot the frequency difference , @xmath27 , between the upper and the lower qpo as a function of the centroid frequency of the lower qpo , @xmath28 : as @xmath28 increases from @xmath29 hz to @xmath30 hz , the separation gradually changes from @xmath0 hz to @xmath1 hz , i.e. by @xmath31 hz . in figure [ figdif ] we also plotted @xmath27 versus @xmath28 as measured for sco x1 ( van der klis et al .",
    "@xcite ) . despite the big difference in luminosity , @xmath32 for sco x1 and @xmath33 for 4u 160852 ,",
    "both sources behave in the same manner .    in order to get a significant measurement of the properties of the upper qpo as a function of the frequency of the lower qpo",
    ", we had to average together power spectra from intervals that were very distant in time .",
    "to check whether this way of averaging the data affected our results we selected three contiguous intervals for which the frequency of the lower qpo remained approximately constant , allowing us to measure reasonably well both qpos simultaneously . during 2624",
    "s , 2624 s , and 3264 s of the observations of 1998 march 26 and 27 , and 1996 march 3 the lower qpo remained more or less constant at @xmath34 hz , @xmath35 hz , and @xmath36 hz , respectively . in the worst case ( 1996 march 3 )",
    "the significance of the detection of the upper peak was @xmath37 .",
    "these three intervals showed exactly the same trend as seen in figure [ figdif ] , only the error bars were larger .",
    "for these three intervals @xmath27 was @xmath38 hz , @xmath39 hz , and @xmath40 hz , respectively .",
    "we have confirmed the existence of the second khz qpo in 4u 160852 , and we have conclusively shown that @xmath27 , the frequency separation of both peaks , is not constant , but changes as a function of the frequency of the lower khz qpo .",
    "this is the first case where this is observed to occur in an atoll source , at a luminosity that is far below the eddington luminosity .",
    "a similar result was obtained previously by van der klis et al .",
    "( @xcite ) only for sco x1 , a z - source at a near - eddington mass accretion rate .",
    "three different models have been proposed to explain the khz qpos . in the photon bubble oscillations model ( klein et al .",
    "1996a , b ) the flow of matter is funneled onto the polar caps of a highly magnetized neutron star accreting at high rates , and the radiation pressure becomes locally super - eddington .",
    "the accretion column develops radiation - hydrodynamic turbulence , and energy is transported to the surface of the accretion column by photon bubbles , which produce oscillations in the luminosity .",
    "klein et al .",
    "( @xcite ) applied this model to explain the 20 , 40 , and 60 hz qpo and the overall shape of the power spectrum observed in the high - luminosity binary pulsar gro j174428 ( fishman et al .",
    "@xcite ; kouveliotou et al .",
    "@xcite ) which contains a neutron star with a high magnetic field ( @xmath41 g ; cui @xcite ) , and to the khz qpo observed in the luminous z - source sco x1 ( van der klis et al .",
    "@xcite ) , which is accreting matter at a high rate ( hasinger & van der klis @xcite ) .",
    "it is widely accepted that in the atoll sources the magnetic field is @xmath42 g. in 4u 160852 during these observations the x - ray luminosity was less than 10% of the eddington luminosity for a @xmath43 neutron star . combining these numbers , and using standard magnetospheric accretion theory , the area of the polecap where the matter accreted onto the neutron star was between 20 and 60% of the total stellar surface ( see frank , king , & raine @xcite , eq . [ 6.14 ] ) .",
    "it is therefore quite unlikely that the accretion rate was locally super - eddington .",
    "this argues , at least for this source , against the photon bubble interpretation of the khz qpos .",
    "titarchuk & muslimov ( @xcite ) , and titarchuk , lapidus , & muslimov ( @xcite ) proposed that all the qpos observed in z and atoll sources might be explained in terms of the rotational splitting of oscillation modes of a nearly keplerian accretion disk .",
    "one of the predictions of this model is that the ratio of the frequency of the upper to the lower khz qpo , @xmath44 , is only a function of @xmath45 , the ratio of the half - thickness of the disk to the radius of the annulus in the disk at which the oscillations occur .",
    "the ratio @xmath44 ( titarchuk et al .",
    "@xcite , eq . [ a9 ] for @xmath46 and @xmath47 ) can vary from 5 ( for @xmath48 ) to 1.37 ( for @xmath49 ) .",
    "when we detected khz qpos , the luminosity of 4u 160852 was @xmath50% @xmath51 .",
    "for these luminosities , and for any realistic structure of the disk , one expects @xmath48 . during our observations of 4u 160852 ,",
    "@xmath52 gradually decreased from @xmath53 at @xmath54 hz to a value of @xmath55 at @xmath56 hz , which are inconsistent with the predicted value of 5 . in sco x1 , despite the large difference in luminosity , and therefore large difference of the inferred structure in the inner part of the disk , @xmath44 changes in the same manner , varying from @xmath57 at 565 hz to @xmath55 at 852 hz ( van der klis et al @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , in both cases @xmath58 reaches lower values than those allowed by the model .",
    "these results show that the disk oscillation model as presented can not account for the observed khz qpos in these two sources .",
    "the most widely accepted models for the khz qpos are beat - frequency models where the upper khz qpo , @xmath59 , represents the keplerian frequency of the accreting material in orbit around the neutron star at some preferred radius ( van der klis et al .",
    "@xcite ) , while the lower frequency peak , @xmath28 , is produced by the beating of @xmath59 with another frequency , @xmath60 , identified as the spin frequency of the neutron star .",
    "strohmayer et al .",
    "( @xcite ) proposed that @xmath59 is produced at the magnetospheric radius , while miller et al .",
    "( @xcite ) proposed that it originates at the sonic radius .",
    "as @xmath61 , these models predict that the frequency difference @xmath27 of the twin khz peaks should remain constant , although @xmath59 and @xmath28 may vary in time .",
    "this kind of models provides a natural explanation for the fact that in most of the sources where two simultaneous khz qpos have been observed @xmath27 does not change significantly as the frequency of the two qpos varies , while they are also consistent with the presence of a third khz peak that is sometimes detected during type - i bursts ( strohmayer et al .",
    "@xcite ; smith , morgan , & bradt @xcite ) at a frequency near @xmath60 or @xmath62 .",
    "two explanations have been put forward to account for the variable peak separation in sco x1 , both of them related to the inferred near - eddington mass accretion rate in this source .",
    "white & zhang ( @xcite ) proposed that the photosphere of the neutron star might expand by 35% while conserving its angular momentum , and therefore slows down as @xmath63 increases .",
    "alternatively , at near - eddington accretion the height of the inner disk might increase and the change of @xmath64 might reflect different values of @xmath59 at different heights in the disk ( lamb , private communication ) .    however , we know now that in the low luminosity source 4u 160852 @xmath27 also changes significantly , in contradiction with a beat - frequency interpretation involving the neutron star spin .",
    "neither of the above explanations can account for this result in 4u 160852 , as it is accreting matter at rates far below the eddington critical rate .",
    "one might argue that 4u 160852 and sco x1 are different , in some respect , from the rest of the sources that show khz qpos .",
    "but if this were the case , it would be difficult to explain why the properties of the khz qpos observed in all sources ( including both 4u 160852 and sco x1 ) are so homogeneous .",
    "moreover , psaltis et al . (",
    "@xcite ) recently showed that for nine other sources where the two qpos have been observed simultaneously , @xmath27 is consistent both with being constant and with having a similar behavior as that observed in sco x1 and 4u 160852 .    in the beat - frequency model the lower khz peak",
    "is expected to be at least as broad as the upper peak , as it is generated by a beat between the upper qpo and the ( coherent ) neutron star spin .",
    "this is contrary to what we observe for 4u 160852 , where the upper peak is intrinsically broader than the lower peak . for instance , during 3840 s on 1998 march 25 , when the frequency of the lower peak varied between 550 hz and 575 hz , the fwhm of the lower and upper peak were @xmath65 hz , and @xmath66 hz ( @xmath3 kev ) , respectively .",
    "a rapidly variable scattering medium around the neutron star could cause the broadening , and might even be responsible for the frequency shift , if it has a ( quasi- ) periodicity of its own ( lamb , private communication ) .",
    "the qpo at @xmath59 , which in the sonic model ( miller et al .",
    "@xcite ) is a beaming oscillation , would be more sensitive to this than the peak at @xmath28 , which is supposed to be produced by oscillations of the luminosity .",
    "if this interpretation is correct , it also needs to explain why the width of the upper qpo does not depend on energy .    at this point",
    ", none of the modified beat - frequency models proposed can explain the varying peak separation in 4u 160852 ( and in sco x1 ) . in order to maintain a beat - frequency model , the change in @xmath67 by @xmath68% , both in 4u 160852 and sco x1 , requires a similar change in @xmath60 .",
    "the spin of the neutron star can not change by such a large factor on such a short timescale .",
    "it might still be possible to rescue the beat - frequency interpretation , although at the expense of its simplicity .",
    "perhaps the idea of a layer at the surface of the neutron star that does not corotate with the body of the star can still be applied to explain these results .",
    "the detection of coherent oscillations during type - i burst in 4u 160852 might provide a strong clue to the nature of the khz qpos in lmxbs , as this would at least make clear at which mass accretion level , if any , the khz peak separation does approach the inferred spin rate .",
