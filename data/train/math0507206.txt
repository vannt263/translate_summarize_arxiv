    "geodesic lines on a surface can be considered either as straight lines with respect to a riemann metric , or trajectories of a particle of mass @xmath0 moving freely on the surface .",
    "the second approach allows for using the methods of analytical mechanics , and has drawn considerable attention , @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that the general solution of the problem of geodetic lines is known only for certain special cases , e.g. ellipsoid , @xcite , @xcite , and the topology , or analysis situs , of geodesics on a surface needs specific studying . in this paper",
    "we use asymptotic methods and in particular focus our attention on geodetic lines that are closed to within the first order of perturbation theory .",
    "the central idea relies on the circumstance that in case of an ellipsoid not differing substantially from a sphere , the great circles of the latter may serve a good approximation to the ellipsoid s geodesics , if they are short enough , and one can visualize the geodesics as winding up in coils ; loops or rings of the coil corresponding to great circles of the sphere , see fig.[fig1 ] . hence approximating the successive rings by great circles , we may describe the change in the position of the rings by the motion of a great circle , see fig.[fig1 ] , which in its turn is determined by the normal vector @xmath1 of the plane cutting the sphere along the great circle . to cast this picture in a more quantitative form",
    "we may use the fact that the normal vector @xmath1 is the angular momentum of the particle moving along the geodetic line .",
    "this , we obtain the advantage of allowing for the use of asymptotic methods , in particular the averaging .",
    "our main instrument is an auxiliary hamiltonian system describing the asymptotic motion of @xmath1 .",
    "it can be easily solved , so that its stationary solutions correspond to closed planar geodesics within the limit of precision provided by the averaging method , see fig.[fig2 ] .",
    "we can get some insight into the behaviour of geodesics by considering solutions joining the stationary solutions , that is separaterixes , which , from a purely geometrical point of view , are a kind of bridges between closed geodesics . in the case of two dimensional torus in three dimensional spcae this phenomenon had been observed by yu.s.volkov , @xcite . generally , a separaterixe geodetic coil does not coincide anywhere with a closed geodesic but comes infinitely close to it , and thus resembles a limit cycle , see fig.[fig2 ] .",
    "the set of stationary points and separaterixes of the auxiliary system forms a net , or graph , which , as is shown in section ii can be realized on projective plane .",
    "thus , we obtain a topological classification of geodetic coils , and find that the number of their topological types is finite .",
    "these arguments are valid even for surfaces having a more general form than that of the ellipsoid . studying the specific case of the deformation determined by fourth order terms involves the surface being substantially different from the ellipsoid as regards its differential geometry , as well as the algebraic structure of its equations , and hence we come across considerable difficulties by attempting a direct investigation of the geodesics . the asymptotic approach outlined above",
    "has the advantage of getting round this problem .",
    "the equations determining geodesics on a surface can be cast in the form of the equation , @xcite ,    @xmath2    where @xmath3 is the right - hand side of the constraint @xmath4 determining the surface . the lagrangian multiplier can be found explicitly , so that the equation of motion , in the form that does not involve @xmath5 , reads    @xmath6    in this paper we consider surfaces that do not differ substantially from sphere , and in assume that their equations be of the form    @xmath7    where @xmath8 are small",
    ". then equations ( [ 2newt_last ] ) read    @xmath9    the equations given above are more tractable than the usual ones employing the christoffel symbols and an explicit parametrization of sphere , so that one may prefer them for the needs of numerical simulation , as is done in this paper . with the view of obtaining a qualitative description of geodesics , we shall consider the angular momentum @xmath10    its components satisfy the equations , which follow from ( [ concrnewt ] )    @xmath11    even though the equations given above are exact , in the sense that they do not involve any approximation and do not use the @xmath8 being small , their treatment still need further refining , and this will be done with the help of the method of averaging .",
    "generally , the approach relies on studying the evolution equations for integrals of motion of the unperturbed system , i.e. in our case the normals to the planes of the large circles , with respect to the basic periodic solution of the latter .",
    "the averaging serves as a filter separating the main regular part of the solution from the oscillating one caused by small terms considered as perturbation , see @xcite .",
    "we shall write the basic equation for the particle s motion on the sphere of unit radius in the form    @xmath12    vectors @xmath13 determined by the equations :    @xmath14    the angular velocity @xmath15 is given by the equation @xmath16 , valid to within the first order of perturbation . here",
    "@xmath17 are coordinates of the normal to the plane of the great circle determining the solution , i.e. the angular momentum .",
    "let us turn to the exact equations for the angular momentum ( [ concrmom ] ) . with the help of the equations given above and neglecting terms of the second , and higher , order in the @xmath18 , we can transform equations ( [ concrmom ] ) in the form    @xmath19 ^ 3         \\left [             \\cos(\\omega t + \\theta ) ( -l_2 )             + \\sin(\\omega t + \\theta ) \\displaystyle \\frac{l_1 l_3}{l }         \\right ] \\vspace{2 mm } \\\\             - \\displaystyle \\frac{2 l^2 \\varepsilon_3}{(l_2 ^ 2 + l_3 ^ 2)^2 }         \\left [          \\cos(\\omega t + \\theta ) ( -l_2 )          + \\sin(\\omega t + \\theta ) \\displaystyle \\frac{l_1 l_3}{l }         \\right]^3         \\left [           \\cos(\\omega t + \\theta ) l_3            + \\sin(\\omega t + \\theta ) \\displaystyle \\frac{l_1 l_2}{l }         \\right ] \\\\      \\end{array }      \\label{explicit}\\ ] ]    @xmath20 ^ 3         \\left [            \\cos(\\omega t + \\theta ) \\cdot 0            + \\sin(\\omega t + \\theta ) \\displaystyle \\frac{- l_2 ^ 2 - l_3 ^ 2}{l }         \\right ] \\vspace{2 mm } \\\\            - \\displaystyle \\frac{2 l^2 \\varepsilon_1}{(l_2 ^ 2 + l_3 ^ 2)^2 }         \\left [             \\cos(\\omega t + \\theta ) \\cdot 0            + \\sin(\\omega t + \\theta ) \\displaystyle \\frac{- l_2 ^ 2 - l_3 ^ 2}{l }         \\right]^3         \\left [           \\cos(\\omega t + \\theta ) ( -l_2 )          + \\sin(\\omega t + \\theta ) \\displaystyle \\frac{l_1 l_3}{l }         \\right ] \\\\",

    "the key point of the present investigation is the concept of geodetic coil which enables us to cast intuitive geometric ideas in analytical form , and relies on constructing an auxiliary hamiltonian system , which can be considered as a reduction of the initial problem to that of constructing a graph on projective plane . in analytical terms",
    ", one may consider it as an asymptotic reduction of the system of equations for geodesics on a deformed sphere to the system similar to that of the top , with the hamiltonian of the fourth order .",
    "the simplification we get in this way , is substantial .",
    "indeed , the hamiltonian system for geodesics could be non - integrable , whereas the auxiliary system is totally integrable , and its phase space can be described by a graph that comprises vertices , which correspond to stationary solutions , or almost closed geodesics , and edges , which can be visualized as geodetic coils joining them .",
    "the important thing is that the arguments , of purely analytical and topological nature , which this analysis involves , turn out to be helpful for the numerical simulation of the equations for geodetic lines , which admits us to give a tangible realization of the visualization problem for geodesics on a surface .",
    "in fact , this paper is profoundly motivated by the technical means provided by numerical modelling , which has allowed us to obtain the final picture of the problem s phase space in terms of the separatrixe graphs .",
    "thus , we feel that the approach used in this paper is the symbiosis of the methods of analytical mechanics , computer analysis , and topology",
    ". the latter is particularly important , giving the conceptual structure for the problem of geodetic lines on the deformed sphere . at this point",
    "it should be noted that the detailed picture of the phase space reconstruction should provide a description of imbedding the invariant torii , which could exist in some regimes , and , perhaps , the domains of chaotic dynamics , peculiar for non - integrable problems , @xcite .",
    "the solution obtained in this paper for the geodesics on the deformed sphere does not preclude the chaotic regimes of geodetic lines , even though the auxiliary hamiltonian system turns out to be completely integrable .",
