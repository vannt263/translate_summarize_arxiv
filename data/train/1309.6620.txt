    "quantum metrology is the study of how accurately physical quantities can be measured within the structure of quantum theory .",
    "quantum - limited metrology is important for such objectives as improving time and frequency standards  @xcite and detecting gravitational waves  @xcite .",
    "the basic scenario of quantum metrology is that of a quantum system whose state is influenced by one or more parameters that are to be determined by probing the system with other physical systems .",
    "the goal is to tailor the measurement made by the probes so as to learn as much as possible about the values of the parameters .",
    "researchers have been busy devising new ways to estimate parameters  @xcite and devising new bounds on how accurately one can estimate a parameter  @xcite .",
    "recently some researchers have proposed ingenious techniques that appear to allow for an improvement in estimation precision beyond the limits quantum mechanics usually imposes . these techniques",
    "go under the names of  probabilistic metrology \"  @xcite , `` metrology with abstention ''  @xcite , and `` weak - value amplification ''  @xcite . before examine probabilistic protocols for estimation ,",
    "we briefly summarize some ways probabilistic protocols are used in quantum information .",
    "probabilistic protocols have a long history in quantum measurement and information theory and have proven to be very useful in some contexts .",
    "for example , in quantum optics , single - photon states can be probabilistically created by heralding on one photon from a pair created by spontaneous parametric downconversion  @xcite .",
    "the low success probabilities seen in experiments are not fundamental and can be increased by multiplexing  @xcite .",
    "similarly , in the knill - laflamme - milburn quantum - optical computing scheme , the probabilistic gates can have arbitrarily high success rates if special resource states can be prepared offline  @xcite .    using unambiguous state discrimination  ( usd )  @xcite",
    ", one can discriminate without error between linearly independent pure states , provided there is the possibility that some of the time one is not required to make a decision among the states .",
    "usd is interesting in its own right , as is probabilistic metrology , but to assess the usefulness of usd for some quantum - information task , one must formulate a performance metric that weighs the trade - off between never making a mistake and sometimes not making a decision . in metrological contexts , one does nt have to formulate a performance metric ; there typically is a natural performance metric related to a measure of the accuracy with which the parameters are estimated .",
    "the aim of this paper is to assess probabilistic metrology relative to such a natural performance metric .",
    "our focus in this paper is not whether protocols for probabilistic quantum metrology are intrinsically interesting , but rather whether they are useful for reaching or beating quantum limits .",
    "the strategy employed by probabilistic metrology schemes is to make a selection measurement that `` concentrates '' information about the parameters into some subset of the measurement outcomes .",
    "further measurements to determine the parameters , made on these favorable outcomes , provide a refined estimates of the parameters ; unfavorable outcomes are discarded with no attempt to gather information from them .",
    "the process of waiting for a favorable outcome is called post - selection ; it amounts to using the selection measurement to prepare states that , on favorable outcomes , provide high sensitivity to the parameters . in prior work , it is not at all clear if the process of post - selection can aid overall estimation accuracy , primarily because the relative scarcity of the favorable outcomes and/or the failure to garner any information from the discarded outcomes is not fully included in the analysis .    in broad terms , the aim of probabilistic metrology is to use the selection measurement to _ increase _ the distinguishability of quantum states . in this paper , we explore whether this strategy can provide benefits for quantum metrology once the probability of favorable outcomes is properly taken into account .",
    "we focus on estimation of a single parameter  @xmath0 and show that if the performance of a strategy for estimating @xmath0 is judged by the mean - square estimation error ( mse ) , post - selection can never improve on quantum limits for estimating  @xmath0 . the framework for our analysis",
    "is laid out in secs .",

    "[ subsec : abstention ] ) .",
    "we are interested in estimating a parameter @xmath0 that is impressed on the system state through some general quantum evolution @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is a trace - preserving completely positive map that depends on @xmath0 .",
    "the parameter could correspond , for example , to a unitary phase shift or to the decay constant of an atom . in order to compare protocols fairly",
    ", we need a way to characterize how well an estimation procedure performs .",
    "we compare protocols based on their mean - square estimation error ( mse ) , @xmath3,\\ ] ] where @xmath4 is an estimator for @xmath5 and @xmath6 $ ] denotes an expectation over data .    for quantum estimation problems",
    "there is a strict lower bound on the mse obtained from any unbiased estimator applied to data collected from any quantum measurement .",
    "the bound is expressed in terms of the quantum fisher information @xmath7 associated with the state @xmath8 that encodes the parameter . for measurements on @xmath9 copies of the system",
    " we call these @xmath9 trials  the bound , called the _",
    "quantum cramr - rao bound _ ( qcrb ) , is expressed as @xmath10 the quantum fisher information is defined as  @xcite @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the _ symmetric logarithmic derivative _ ( sld ) , implicitly defined by the equation @xmath13.\\ ] ]    it is known that there is an optimal quantum measurement whose _ classical _ fisher information , calculated from the probabilities of measurement outcomes , achieves the _ quantum _ fisher information  ( [ eq : irhox ] )  @xcite ; letting @xmath14 be any positive - operator - valued measure ( povm ) , with outcome probabilities @xmath15 , this can be written as @xmath16,\\ ] ] where the classical fisher information of the outcome probabilities is @xmath17=\\sum_k p(k|x)\\!\\left(\\frac{\\partial\\ln p(k|x)}{\\partial x}\\right)^2.\\ ] ] equation  ( [ classical to quantum fisher ] ) is an alternative , operational definition of the quantum fisher information .",
    "an additional important fact is that the maximum likelihood estimator generally achieves the classical fisher bound asymptotically in @xmath9 , and this , together with eq .",
    "( [ classical to quantum fisher ] ) , means that the qcrb does indeed express the quantum limit on achievable mse . to achieve",
    "the qcrb often requires prior information about the parameter and , in practice , an adaptive implementation of the optimal measurement .    before moving on to our detailed analysis",
    ", we draw attention to one important point .",
    "the inequalities we derive are tight only when the relevant likelihood function is approximately normal",
    ". thus the rate of convergence with @xmath9 of a particular likelihood function to the normal distribution determines when the following bounds are tight . for measurements with gaussian statistics ,",
    "the inequalities are saturated immediately , for one trial .",
    "interestingly , distributions that are quite different from the normal distribution rapidly become approximately normal . for example ( see chap .",
    "2 of  @xcite ) , `` a rough rule '' is that for @xmath18 , the normal approximation to a binomial distribution is good if @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the bernoulli or binomial success probability . in practice ,",
    "provided @xmath20 is not too close to 0 or 1 , this means that @xmath21 is sufficient to approximate a normal distribution . as",
    "quantum statistics are often bernoulli or binomial , we can expect our results to hold very closely in as few as @xmath22@xmath23 trials . in typical quantum - metrology applications",
    "@xcite , the likelihood functions are highly nongaussian and oscillatory , yet the convergence to a normal distribution still occurs approximately after as little as @xmath24 trials  ( see sec .  6 of  @xcite ) .",
    "braunstein  @xcite has explored the question of approach to gaussian statistics in the context of the maximum likelihood estimation that can achieve the cramr - rao bound .",
    "rather than using the optimal povm which solves eq .",
    "( [ classical to quantum fisher ] ) , the idea of probabilistic metrology is to `` encode '' the information about the unknown parameter `` in a more efficient way ''  @xcite .",
    "formally , one makes a selection measurement whose outcomes are divided into the set @xmath25 of favorable outcomes , which `` concentrate '' the information about the parameter , and the complementary set @xmath26 of unfavorable outcomes , which are discarded .",
    "when a favorable outcome is obtained , a second measurement is performed on the post - selected state to extract information about @xmath0 .    to investigate these ideas , we compare the quantum fisher information before and after the selection measurement .",
    "this is different from the analysis performed in  @xcite , where there were additional assumptions about how the parameter was encoded in the state @xmath8 and about what types of selection measurement could be performed .",
    "here we use the most general forms allowed by quantum mechanics .",
    "the quantum state that encodes the classical parameter @xmath0 is denoted by @xmath27 , where we now label the system with @xmath28 to distinguish it from the ancilla we introduce shortly .",
    "the system can consist of more than one part : in weak - value amplification , for example , the system @xmath28 is divided into two parts , @xmath29 and @xmath30 , the parameter is the strength of an interaction between @xmath29 and @xmath30 , and the selection measurement is performed on @xmath29 alone  @xcite .",
    "notice also that since we allow the encoded state @xmath31 to be mixed , our analysis covers the case of technical noise that is imposed on the system as the parameter is encoded in the system .",
    "we can simply regard the operation @xmath2 as incorporating a description of such technical  noise .",
    "the selection measurement is described by quantum operations , one for each outcome  @xmath32 , @xmath33 = \\sum_{j=0}^{j_\\alpha-1}m_{\\alpha , j } \\,\\rho_{{{\\scriptscriptstyle{q}}}}(x)\\ , m_{\\alpha , j}{^\\dagger},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the operators @xmath34 are kraus operators . the povm element for outcome  @xmath32 and the completeness relation satisfied by the povm elements",
    "are @xmath35 the subscript @xmath36 allows for the possibility that the quantum operations involve course graining over measurement results we do nt have access to .",
    "our subsequent analysis requires us to be clear about the values assumed by @xmath32 and @xmath36 : the outcomes @xmath32 are labeled by positive integers , @xmath37 , and the index @xmath36 , when associated with outcome @xmath32 , takes on values @xmath38 .",

    "the idea behind probabilistic quantum metrology is that the states for favorable outcomes ( @xmath42 ) have higher fisher information than @xmath31 .",
    "the qcrb arises , however , from the quantum fisher information of an individual quantum state and not directly from an average of the quantum fisher informations for states occurring with various probabilities .",
    "thus , to formalize the idea of probabilistic metrology for analysis using the qcrb , we need to formulate it in terms of a single quantum state . for this purpose",
    ", we employ an ancilla @xmath43 that records and stores the outcomes of the selection measurement .",
    "the joint system - ancilla state we are shooting for is @xmath44 where the states @xmath45 are orthonormal ancilla states . in the state  ( [ sigmanocheck ] )",
    "the ancilla stores a record of the selection - measurement outcomes ; the outcomes are correlated with the post - selected system states @xmath46 , which occur with probability @xmath47 .",
    "we now show how to get to the state  ( [ sigmanocheck ] ) and to successor states that are relevant for probabilistic metrology by physical processes ; this demonstration illuminates how information is discarded at various points in these processes . to reiterate where we are headed",
    ", we are going to show in sec .",
    "[ sec : results_1 ] how getting to the state  ( [ sigmanocheck ] ) and to the successor states envisioned by probabilistic metrology decreases the fisher information available for parameter estimation .",
    "we first invoke the kraus representation theorem  @xcite , which tells us that given the complete set of kraus operators , @xmath48 , there exists an ancilla with initial pure state @xmath49 and a joint unitary operator @xmath50 such that @xmath51 , where the states @xmath52 make up an orthonormal basis for the ancilla .",
    "the evolution under @xmath50 can be written as @xmath53 this joint unitary evolution does not store the measurement outcome in the ancilla .",
    "indeed , since the unitary @xmath50 can be reversed , the state  ( [ eq : firstjoint ] ) has the same quantum fisher information as @xmath31 . to record and store",
    "the outcome in the ancilla requires some decoherence of the ancilla , which can be thought of as a measurement on the ancilla .",
    "navely one might expect that performing the measurement specified by kraus operators @xmath54 would result in the state  ( [ sigmanocheck ] ) , but in fact , it gives the state @xmath55 this measurement , though it removes the coherence between different outcome subspaces in the ancilla , leaves the coherence within each outcome subspace and thus does not reproduce the state  ( [ sigmanocheck ] ) .    to get to the state  ( [ sigmanocheck ] ) , we need to do a measurement on the ancilla in the basis @xmath56 and then keep only the outcome @xmath32 ; erasing the suboutcome  @xmath36 can be done by a post - measurement unitary on the ancilla that , in each outcome subspace @xmath32 , leaves the ancilla in a particular state , which we take to be @xmath57 .",
    "the desired ancilla measurement is thus described by the quantum operation @xmath58 where the kraus operators are given by @xmath59 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : sg ] ) , the symbol @xmath60 is a place holder for the operator the operation acts on . applying @xmath61 to the state  ( [ eq : firstjoint ] ) gives the desired state  ( [ sigmanocheck ] ) , @xmath62 & = \\sum_{\\alpha=1}^j{\\mathcal{f}}_\\alpha[\\rho_{{\\scriptscriptstyle{q}}}(x)]\\otimes{{\\left|{f_\\alpha}\\right\\rangle}\\!{\\left\\langle{f_\\alpha}\\right|}}\\nonumber\\\\ & = \\sigma_{{{\\scriptscriptstyle{q}}}{{\\scriptscriptstyle{a}}}}(x),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we identify @xmath63 .",
    "the quantum operation @xmath61 is a decoherence process that stores the selection - measurement outcomes in the ancilla , correlated with the post - selected system states @xmath46 .    before proceeding further ,",
    "a remark is in order .",

    "having gotten to the state  ( [ sigmanocheck ] ) , we now imagine a further conditional decoherence that for the unfavorable outcomes , damps the system to a state @xmath65 , which contains no information about @xmath0 ( zero fisher information ) , and the ancilla to a state @xmath66 , which can be taken to be the state @xmath45 for a particular unfavorable outcome .",
    "the result is the joint state @xmath67 here @xmath68 is the total probability of the unfavorable outcomes . to simplify our expressions we introduce , in the second form of eq .",
    "( [ sigmacheck ] ) , the conditional distribution @xmath69 .",

    "all information about the parameter has clearly been removed from the unfavorable outcomes , but the state  ( [ sigmacheck ] ) still allows a guess for the parameter when an unfavorable outcome occurs .",

    "tanaka and yamamoto  @xcite proved this inequality for any pair of quantum systems that begin in a pure product state and interact via any interaction hamiltonian .",
    "ferrie and combes  @xcite generalized the inequality of tanaka and yamamoto to a double inequality that includes the mixed state @xmath77 , i.e. , @xmath128 ; in this inequality , the state @xmath77 is the ensemble of post - selected pure states , and the second inequality explicitly includes contributions from the classical fisher information of the selection - measurement probabilities .",
    "ferrie and combes also considered the presence of arbitrary gaussian technical noise on the input state , thus demonstrating that the derived inequalities are true even in the presence of such technical noise .",
    "they also used the chernoff bound , in a special case of the analysis in sec .",
    "[ sec : results_2 ] , to find the consequences of the fisher - information inequalities for a finite number of trials .",
    "recently , zhang , datta and walmsley  @xcite have independently proved a special case of the ferrie - combes inequality and illustrated it with several examples , and knee and gauger  @xcite have shown , using a fisher - information analysis , that if there is technical noise on the detector , weak - value amplification offers no advantage for overcoming such technical imperfections .    in this paper",
    "we have put the analysis of probabilistic metrology on a firm , general footing by using the physically motivated ancilla model .",
    "we generalized prior fisher - information inequalities to the set of inequalities in eq .",
    "( [ eq : fisher2 ] ) , which apply to all mixed input states , thus including the effect of any technical noise at the input , and to all possible quantum operations for the selection measurement .",
    "this means that the analysis covers all protocols for probabilistic metrology in which mse is the performance metric ; in particular , this encompasses all versions of probabilistic metrology that use weak - value amplification , regardless of whether the defined weak values are real or imaginary .    in the remainder of this section ,",
    "we formulate three desiderata for analyses of probabilistic quantum metrology .",
    "then we show how the prior work on using weak - value amplification for metrology and on metrology with abstention is related to the desiderata and to our analysis .",
    "we find it useful to formulate three desiderata for analyses that assess the utility of probabilistic protocols for quantum metrology :    1 .",
    "choose a performance metric , and apply it uniformly to all data .",
    "2 .   include the success probability correctly in the analysis .",
    "this should happen automatically if the problem is set up properly .",
    "assessing the effect of the success probability might require the sort of statistical analysis given in sec .",
    "[ sec : results_2 ] .",
    "3 .   compare the performance of probabilistic protocols with deterministic protocols , using the same performance metric for all cases .",
    "if possible , compare with the optimal deterministic protocol , which sets a quantum limit on estimation as measured by the chosen performance metric .",
    "the analysis we present in secs .",
    "[ sec : parest][sec : results_2 ] adheres to these desiderata by considering single - parameter estimation , with mse as the performance metric and the corresponding quantum cramr - rao bound setting the quantum limit on achievable .",
    "the string of inequalities in our theorem automatically includes the probabilities for favorable outcomes and the overall success probability @xmath102 in just the right way for comparing probabilistic and deterministic strategies . in contrast , in much previous work , the relative scarcity of the favorable outcomes and/or the failure to garner any information about the parameters from the discarded outcomes is not fully included in the analysis , thus making it difficult to judge the impact of discarding outcomes .",
    "though our analysis provides a model for studies of probabilistic quantum metrology , it does not apply directly to much of the previous work for two reasons : some previous work considers multi - parameter estimation , and much of it uses a performance metric other than .",
    "we now take a brief look at some of this previous work to identify problems in the analysis .",
    "analyses of weak - value amplification  @xcite typically use signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) , instead of mse , as the performance metric and consider a probabilistic protocol successful if the snr increases on post - selection .",
    "we note that there is no good reason to prefer snr over mse , since in the case of amplification , mse already includes the effects of gain that snr is meant to capture ; moreover , an improvement in snr does not necessarily imply an improvement in mse  @xcite .",
    "most importantly , as was discussed in  @xcite , the relevant metric for assessing nondeterministic protocols is not the post - selected snr , which fails to include the success probability @xmath129 , but rather the root - probability - snr product , @xmath130 .",
    "snr increases as the square root of the number of trials , so when trials proceed to an estimate only on favorable outcomes , the effective number of trials on average is reduced to @xmath131 ; thus proper accounting requires including @xmath132 in the performance metric . as in the analysis of nondeterministic immaculate amplifiers in  @xcite , it seems likely that the root - probability - snr product will show that weak - value amplification does not improve the ability to detect weak signals , in accordance with the related results reported in  @xcite .",
    "it has been argued that even when the fundamental results presented here and in  @xcite hold , the situation for weak - value amplification changes when `` technical noise '' is included ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) .",
    "we have yet to see any convincing evidence of this claim because success probability is not properly included in the analysis . as we noted in sec .",
    "[ sec : ancilla ] , our analysis already includes the effects of technical noise at the input .",
    "any other technical noise is noise in the measurements and can be regarded as arising from a restriction that prevents the optimal measurement from being performed .",
    "thus , even were it true that weak - value amplification has advantages in the case of such output technical noise , it would mean that the advantages have nothing to do with fundamental quantum limits and should not be viewed as addressing fundamental questions of quantum mechanics .",
    "protocols for metrology with abstention  @xcite have used mean fidelity as the performance metric .",
    "we focus on the protocol considered in  @xcite , which seeks to estimate the direction @xmath133 of the bloch vector of @xmath9 qubits all of which are in the state @xmath134 .",
    "the chosen performance metric is the fidelity of the pure qubit state corresponding to the estimate @xmath135 with the pure qubit state corresponding to the true direction @xmath133 , i.e. , @xmath136 this fidelity is averaged over the prior distribution of @xmath133 and over the measurement results that lead to @xmath135 .",
    "if the prior for @xmath133 is uniform on the bloch sphere , the optimal measurement is the covariant measurement , i.e. , the measurement that is invariant under simultaneous rotations of the qubits .",
    "this covariant measurement is block diagonal in the angular - momentum subspaces , which have total angular momentum in the range @xmath137 , where @xmath138 and @xmath139 .",
    "we let @xmath140 denote an arbitrary angular - momentum subspace with angular momentum @xmath36 ; the number of such subspaces , i.e. , the multiplicity of irreducible representations with angular momentum  @xmath36 , is given in eq .",
    "( 11 ) of  @xcite . in each angular - momentum subspace , the covariant measurement is a measurement in the basis of angular - momentum coherent states , which are specified by a spin direction ; the estimate of spin direction is the result of the measurement .",
    "as shown in  @xcite , the mean fidelity is @xmath141 the second step here follows from the covariance of the measurement , which allows us to pick any direction for the estimate , here @xmath142 , as long as we integrate over the uniform prior for @xmath133 .",
    "the same symmetry under rotations implies that @xmath143 , the probability to find the @xmath9 qubits with angular momentum  @xmath36 , is independent of @xmath133 .",
    "the final result for the average fidelity is @xmath144 where @xmath145 is the average fidelity for angular momentum  @xmath36 .",
    "since the fidelity can be thought of as the probability that @xmath135 matches @xmath133 , the @xmath36th term in the sum  ( [ eq : avf ] ) can be thought of as the probability to get the outcome @xmath36 times the probability of a match given the outcome  @xmath36 ; the overall fidelity is obtained by summing over  @xmath36 .",
    "the abstention protocol regards the identification of total angular momentum  @xmath36 as a selection measurement ; the subsequent identification of a particular subspace within @xmath36 and the coherent - state measurement in that subspace complete the measurement required to give an estimate .",
    "since @xmath146 increases with @xmath36 ( because the bigger @xmath36 , the more well - defined the spin direction ) , the favorable outcomes are chosen to be those whose total angular momentum exceeds a threshold @xmath147 , i.e. , @xmath148 .",
    "the favorable outcomes have overall probability and average fidelity @xmath149 similarly , the unfavorable outcomes have overall probability and average fidelity @xmath150 since @xmath146 increases with @xmath36 , it is clear that @xmath151 .",
    "we can now write a string of inequalities reminiscent of those for quantum fisher information in eq .",
    "( [ eq : theorem ] ) : @xmath152 given that @xmath151 , the first equality says that @xmath153 , i.e. , that the post - selected averaged fidelity is bigger than the unconditioned average fidelity .",
    "it is this increase in post - selected average fidelity that is reported as the advantage of abstention metrology in  @xcite .",
    "the two inequalities that complete eq .",
    "( [ eq : fineq ] ) , both of which correspond to discarding information , indicate why this advantage is not useful .",
    "the first inequality says that the average fidelity decreases if one guesses a random spin direction in the event of an unfavorable outcome ( random guesses have average fidelity of @xmath154 ) , and the second says that the average fidelity decreases further if one refuses to give an estimate for unfavorable outcomes .",
    "note that if eq .",
    "( [ eq : fineq ] ) is divided by @xmath129 , as is typically done in the literature , the inequalities still hold .",
    "if mean fidelity is the performance metric , the post - selected average fidelity must be multiplied by the probability of a favorable outcome . to put it a bit differently , in the case of post - selection , the average probability that the estimate matches the true spin direction must include the probability of having the opportunity to make an estimate .",
    "one could repeat the @xmath9-qubit protocol many times @xmath155 in the hope that there would be so many favorable outcomes @xmath156 that @xmath157 or , equivalently , that @xmath158\\overline f / p(\\checkmark)\\overline f_\\checkmark$ ] .",
    "this clearly does nt work out on average , and the hope can be dashed using the statistical techniques employed in sec .",
    "[ sec : results_2 ] , which show that the probability of this happy occurrence decreases exponentially with @xmath155 .",
    "although the argument we give here is couched in terms of the abstention protocol considered in  @xcite , the same ideas and analysis are easily generalized to any probabilistic protocol that uses fidelity as the performance metric .",
    "the key point is that the probability of favorable outcomes must be included in the post - selected average fidelity .",
    "our chief objective in this paper has been to give a rigorous account of quantum limits on probabilistic metrology .",
    "specifically , we have shown that the quantum fisher information weighted by the success probability does not increase under post - selection ; thus probabilistic metrology can not improve the quantum limit on the accuracy for estimating a single parameter .",
    "the quantum fisher information is relevant because we use a quadratic loss function , the mse of our estimate , as our performance metric ; the qcrb tells us that an unbiased estimator can achieve a mse that is the inverse of the quantum fisher information .",
    "it remains possible , however , that our conclusion might not hold for other performance metrics applied to other parameter - estimation problems .",
    "we conclude now by briefly considering other possibilities , but caution the reader that to reach a different conclusion about probabilistic metrology requires violating one of the two principles we enunciated in sec .",
    "[ sec : results_1 ] .",
    "neither of these principles seems likely to go away .",
    "one approach might be to include a fixed cost for obtaining an unfavorable outcome from the selection measurement .",
    "additionally ( or alternatively ) , one might use a loss function that penalizes deviations of @xmath4 from @xmath5 more heavily than does a quadratic loss function .",
    "a power - law loss function such as @xmath159}$ ] might do that , and the resulting penalty might prejudice one to use states that provide high sensitivity to changes in the parameter .",
    "though it is conceivable that exotic loss functions or other performance metrics might avoid our negative conclusions about probabilistic quantum metrology , the conjurer of any such function faces three tasks before reporting back to the community .",
    "the first task is provide a detailed account of what parameter - estimation problem the performance metric corresponds to .",
    "the second is to determine , if possible , the ultimate quantum limit ",
    "the analogue of the qcrb  on performance in terms of the new metric .",
    "the third is to analyze rigorously the performance of probabilistic protocols as expressed by the new metric , including the effect of success probability in the analysis .",
    "results without the context that comes from performing these tasks have little call on the attention of those who actually face quantum limitations on measurement precision .",
