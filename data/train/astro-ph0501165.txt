    "t  tauri stars ( tts ) are young ( @xmath7 , @xcite ) low - mass stars , and are thought to be the progenitors of solar - type stars .",
    "classical t  tauri stars ( ctts ) exhibit strong h@xmath6 emission , and typically have spectral types of f  k .",
    "some of the most active ctts show emission in higher order balmer lines and metal lines ( e.g.  , h and k ) .",
    "they also exhibit an excess amount of continuum flux in the ultraviolet ( uv ) and infrared ( ir ) .    line profile studies of ctts show evidence for both outflows and inflows , as seen in the blue - shifted absorption features in h@xmath6 profiles ( e.g.  @xcite ) and the inverse p  cygni ( ipc ) profiles ( e.g.  @xcite ; @xcite ) respectively .",
    "typical mass - loss rates of ctts are about @xmath8 to @xmath9 ( e.g.  @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , and mass - accretion rates range from @xmath8 to @xmath9 ( e.g.  @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .    in the currently favoured model of accretion on to ctts , the accretion discs are disrupted by the stellar magnetosphere which channel the gas from the disc on to the stellar surface ( e.g.  @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "this picture of the accretion flows is supported by the observation that ctts have relatively strong ( @xmath10 ) magnetic fields ( e.g.  @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) and by radiative transfer models which reproduce the gross characteristics of the observed profiles for some tts ( e.g.   @xcite ) .",
    "su  aurigae is a bright ( @xmath11 , @xcite ) young star with a g2 spectral type @xcite , and has been classified either as a ctts ( e.g.   @xcite ; @xcite ) or early - type tts ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "it is also the prototype ` su aur type ' @xcite .",
    "based on modelling of the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) , su  aur is known to have an accretion disc ( @xmath12 ) along with an outer envelope ( e.g.   @xcite ) .",
    "near - infrared coronagraphic observations of @xcite and @xcite have shown that the object is associated with a reflection nebula and outflows .",
    "most recently , @xcite have presented high resolution ( 0.3 arcsec ) @xmath13- , @xmath14- and @xmath15-band adaptive optics images displaying nebulosity with a disc - like structure around su  aur .",
    "su  aur has been a subject of a number of variability studies , mainly in the optical , e.g.   @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and most recently @xcite .",
    "the h@xmath6 line , which is most commonly used for variability studies of tts , is produced over a large circumstellar volume , and shows evidence of outflow ( winds ) as well as magnetospheric inflow .",
    "@xcite studied the variability of h@xmath6 and h@xmath0 profiles of su  aur , and found that the modulation of the wind and the accretion components in the profiles are approximately @xmath16 out of phase .",
    "this led them to suggest that the magnetic field axis is slightly tilted with respect to the rotation axis of the star .",
    "near - ir profiles , such as pa@xmath0 and br@xmath17 are likely to become important probes of accretion in ctts and their lower - mass counterparts , since they appear to suffer from less contamination by outflows than h@xmath6 ( e.g.  @xcite ; @xcite , although see @xcite ) and are less affected by dust obscuration , enabling the study of accretion in highly embedded objects . here",
    "we present time - series pa@xmath0 spectra of su  aur , which we use to probe the accretion geometry . in section  [ sec : observations ] we give details on the observations and the data reduction .",
    "the results and analysis are presented in section  [ sec : results ] .",
    "radiative transfer models are computed in an attempt to explain the overall observed variability feature in section  [ sec : models ] .",

    "a total of 503 pa@xmath0  ( @xmath18 ) spectra with a signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) of @xmath19 per pixel ( in the continuum ) were obtained over 3 nights ( 2002 december 13 ) at the united kingdom infrared telescope ( ukirt ) on mauna kea , hawaii .",
    "the approximate temporal sampling rate was one spectrum every 3 minutes .",
    "the cooled grating spectrometer no .  4 ( cgs4 ) , a 15  @xmath20 multi - purpose 2-d grating spectrometer with a @xmath21 insb array , with the echelle grating and long camera ( @xmath22 ) , was used .",
    "this provides a velocity resolution ( at @xmath23 ) of @xmath24 using @xmath25  pix slit width without the nyquist stepping .",
    "the wavelength range of the echelle spectra is about @xmath26 providing enough continuum on either side of the line for accurate rectification .",
    "unfortunately there are insufficient photospheric features to perform a veiling correction telluric standard stars were observed throughout each night ( every 23 hours ) to correct for instrument response and atmospheric transmission .",
    "the data obtained with cgs4 were reduced using a standard procedure ( c.f .",
    "@xcite ) : 1 .",
    "bias subtraction , 2 .",
    "flat - field , and 3 .",
    "optimal extraction ( @xcite ) .",
    "all spectra were reduced in the same manner , using the orac - dr pipeline program .",
    "intrinsic absorption components in the standard stars , used in step  3 to correct for the telluric lines , were subtracted from the original spectra by using the least square fit of the spectra with a combination of two gaussian functions and a third order polynomial .",
    "after the preliminary reduction by the pipeline was finished , a wavelength calibration was performed using a combination of oh sky emission lines and comparison arc lines .",
    "finally we applied heliocentric velocity corrections and shifted the spectra into the rest - frame of su  aur , adopting the radial velocity measurement ( @xmath27 ) of @xcite .",
    "a general overview of the dataset is presented in fig .  [",
    "fig : threenights ] .",
    "the mean spectrum shows a classic inverse p  cygni ( ipc ) profile , with the blue - wing of the emission component extending to @xmath28@xmath29 and the absorption component with maximum depth at @xmath30@xmath29 and extending out to @xmath31@xmath29 .",
    "the peak intensity of the line , relative to the continuum , is about 1.25 .",
    "although comparable in strength , the pa@xmath0 profiles of su  aur presented by @xcite show significant emission red - wards of the absorption dip , and also have maximum absorption occurring at @xmath32@xmath29 i.e. they appear to be shifted by @xmath19@xmath29 blueward compared to our dataset .",

    "[ fig : mean_sp ] .",
    "it is immediately apparent that the blue side of the profile is more stable than the red , with variability of less than 10 per cent ( in continuum units ) at the line peak and blueward .",
    "there is a suggestion of blue - shifted absorption at about @xmath33@xmath29 on the second night .",
    "interestingly , the blue - shifted absorption feature at @xmath5 is also seen in h@xmath6 @xcite and h@xmath0 @xcite profiles , and the modulation period of the absorption feature is identified as the rotational period of su  aur ( @xmath34  d ) .",
    "the red side of the mean profiles shows strong variability , extending redward to over @xmath35@xmath29 . on the final night",
    "there is emission on the red side of the absorption trough , and the profile more closely resembles that presented by @xcite .",
    "the greyscale dynamic spectra ( fig .",
    "[ fig : threenights ] ) reveal the gradual changes that occur over a timescale of hours . on the first night",
    "there is a feature that accelerates monotonically redward across the absorption trough . on the second night both",
    "the red and blue sides of the profile are lower than the mean .",
    "finally , on the third night we see the growth of an emission feature in the absorption dip .",
    "the characteristic level of this red - wing variability is about 10 per cent .      in order to quantify the level and significance of the variability seen in the pa @xmath0 profiles , the temporal variance spectrum ( @xmath36 ) analysis method proposed by @xcite",
    "was applied to the time series spectra from each night separately , and also to all three nights combined .",
    "this method statistically compares the deviations in line features with those of the adjacent continuum . in other words , the level of deviation at a given wavelength is computed with a weight function which is inversely proportional to the signal - to - noise ( s / n ) level of the continuum . by using the definition of @xcite , the @xmath37-th velocity bin of the @xmath36 , in the limit of high photon - count , can be written as :    @xmath38    where @xmath39 is the signal of the @xmath37-th velocity bin belonging to the @xmath40-th spectrum of a time - series , and @xmath41 is the number of observed spectra .",

    "a more convenient quantity to be plotted is the square root of @xmath36 ( temporal deviation spectrum ) because @xmath49 scales linearly with the spectral deviations ; hence , it provides a more accurate impression of the deviation from the variability with respect to the continuum .    using equation  [ eq : definition_tvs ] ,",
    "the temporal deviation spectrum of the times - series spectra from each night was computed , and the results were placed in the top panels of fig .  [ fig : eachnight ] . in the same figure ,",
    "the spectra divided by the mean spectrum of each night ( the quotient spectra ) and the mean spectrum are shown as a function of time .",

    "[ fig : threenights ] .    the @xmath49 value which corresponds to one per cent statistical significance ( the @xmath50-probability ) is also shown in the same figure as a reference point . in the absence of real variability , the observed @xmath49 values should be below this level for 99 per cent of time . from the @xmath49 plot in fig .",
    "[ fig : threenights ] , we confirm that the line displays strong variability the @xmath49 plots in fig .",
    "[ fig : eachnight ] show that the velocity ranges in which the variability is most active change from night to night .    [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]      in section  [ sub : motion - of - subpeak ] , we found that the motion of the subpeak in the red absorption trough was possibly related with the precession of magnetic axis around the rotational axis . in fig .",
    "[ fig : subpeak_model ] , a subset ( 25 out of 50 ) of pa@xmath0 line spectra from model  a is shown .",
    "only the red side of the line profiles are shown to emphasise the motion of the subpeak . at @xmath51 ,",
    "the inclination angle of the magnetic axis with respect to an observer is @xmath52 , then it gradually decreases to @xmath53 as the phase reaches to @xmath54 . the inclination of the magnetic axis increases again to @xmath52 as the phase reaches to @xmath55",
    "the velocity position of the subpeak moves from @xmath56 ( at @xmath51 ) to @xmath57 ( at @xmath58 ) , and then to @xmath59 ( at @xmath60 ) .",
    "the motion is symmetric about @xmath60 .",
    "as the phase approaches @xmath61 , the main subpeak feature becomes less pronounced , and it smoothly shifts to a smaller subpeak seen at @xmath59 ( indicated by an arrow in the figure ) as the phase approaches 0.5 .",
    "[ fig : subpeak_pos_model_a ] shows the positions of the subpeak , presented in fig.[fig : subpeak_model ] , as a function of rotational phase .",

    "the velocity reaches the maximum value ( @xmath57 ) which is about 1.4 times smaller than the maximum velocity seen in the observation ( @xmath63 ) . at @xmath51 and @xmath55 ,",

    ", no clear subpeak is seen in the red absorption trough therefore it is not shown here .",
    "model  c shows a similar variability pattern of the subpeak as in model  a. the gaps in the magnetosphere in model  b and c , are unlikely the causes of the subpeak motion . from this analysis",
    ", we found that the models  a and c reproduce qualitatively similar variability in the red absorption as seen in the observation .",
    "based on the model spectra computed in section  [ sub : model - spectra ] , the ew of pa@xmath0 were computed using the velocity bins from @xmath66 to @xmath67 , and plotted as a function of time ( fig .",
    "[ fig : ew_model ] ) .",
    "the model phase was multiplied by the period of su  aur ( @xmath68 ; @xcite ) , and translated by @xmath69d to match approximately the positions of the peaks in the observed ew variability curve .    according to fig .",
    "[ fig : ew_model ] , the ranges of the ew variation predicted by models  a , b and c are about @xmath70 , @xmath54 and @xmath71 respectively . on the other hand , the observation ( fig .",

    "the amplitudes of ew changes predicated by the models are within the range of the observational uncertainty ( @xmath73 ) .",
    "a direct comparison between the absolute values of ew would be misleading since our model is not a formal fit to the data .",
    "nonetheless , we note that our model mean ew ( @xmath74 ) is comparable to the mean ew of the observation ( @xmath75 ) , although of course the observations do not fully sample a complete rotational period .",
    "the overall characteristics of the ew variability seen in the observation is well reproduced by models  a and c , but model  c with three gaps is preferred because it shows both @xmath76 and @xmath77 variation found in the observation ( section  [ sub : line - equivalent - width ] ) .",
    "model  b is clearly inconsistent with the data .",
    "a better match of the observation with model  c can be achieved by carefully choosing the longitudinal position of the gaps with respect to the tilt of the magnetic axis .",
    "the amplitude of the ew variability can be increased by using wider gaps in the magnetosphere , and by increasing the tilt angle of the magnetic axis .",
    "interestingly , the recent light curve calculation of @xcite , who considered the flux variation caused by the hot spots on the surface of the rotating stars in their magneto - hydrodynamic simulations , showed the presence of second harmonic ( two peaks in one rotational period ) when the inclination angle ( @xmath78 ) .",
    "this is consistent with the ew curve of our model  a.",
    "we have presented the 503 time - series echelle spectra of pa@xmath0 line of su aur ( fig .  [",
    "fig : threenights ] ) . from the temporal variance",
    "spectra analysis ( section  [ sub : temporal - variance - spectra ] ) , we found that the line displayed relatively strong variability while the flux level at the line centre remained almost constant .",
    "a hint of blue - shifted absorption at about @xmath33@xmath29 was found on the second night .",
    "interestingly , a similar blue - shifted absorption feature at @xmath5 are seen in h@xmath6 and h@xmath0 profiles , which modulates with the rotational period of the star ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",

    "the position of the peak was fitted well with the fourier series summed up to the second harmonic term ( @xmath79 in equation  [ eq : fourier_series ] ) , indicating that the variability is associated not only with the rotational period but also a half of the rotational period .",
    "this is consistent with the tilted - axis magnetospheric accretion models ( e.g.@xcite ; @xcite ) . to exclude the possibility that the large amplitude of the change in the subpeak position seen on the second night was caused by a single episodic event",

    "the mean spectra of the models ( a , b and c ) are more asymmetric and triangular than the observed profile .",
