    "@xcite introduced the @xmath0model . in this model ,",
    "the beads are placed on a regular lattice and the ( scalar ) forces are stochastically transmitted , by random fractions denoted by the symbol @xmath0 . even in its simplest version , where one assumes a uniform @xmath0distribution , it already reproduces the main feature of the experimental observations : the probability for large forces decays exponentially @xcite .",
    "although for this uniform @xmath0distribution the forces become totally uncorrelated , in general , correlations do persist @xcite . in the present study",
    ", we investigate for which @xmath0distributions this is the case and we reveal the surprising nature of these correlations . in order to perform an analytical study",
    ", we restrict ourselves to the scalar @xmath0model and allow only correlations between @xmath0values in a layer . more sophisticated lattice models , which include the vector nature of the force and",
    "allow correlations between layers are not considered here @xcite .",
    "although the @xmath0model is particularly simple , its behavior turns out to be very rich .",
    "first of all , there is a so - called critical @xmath0distribution , which produces a force distribution that decays algebraically instead of exponentially @xcite .",
    "it therefore forms a critical point in the space of @xmath0distributions , and its properties were recently investigated in great detail @xcite .",
    "a second intriguing issue concerns the top  down _ dynamics _ of force correlations ( the downward direction can be interpreted as time ) @xcite .",
    "even if both in the initial state ( top layer ) and in the asymptotic state ( infinite depth ) all forces are uncorrelated , there will be correlations at all intermediate levels .",
    "correlations become longer in range while their amplitudes diminish in a diffusion process , and as a result , the asymptotic force distribution is only approached algebraically @xcite .",
    "this process is closely related to the subject of this study , namely the presence of force correlations at infinite depth .     in the @xmath0model for ( a ) the triangular packing ( side view ) and ( b ) the fcc packing ( top view),title=\"fig:\",width=158 ]   in the @xmath0model for ( a ) the triangular packing ( side view ) and ( b ) the fcc packing ( top view),title=\"fig:\",width=158 ]    let us recapitulate the definition of the @xmath0model .",
    "the beads are assumed to be positioned on a regular lattice .",
    "let @xmath1 be the force in the downward direction on the @xmath2th bead in a layer .",
    "this bead makes contact with a number of @xmath3 beads in the layer below , which we indicate by the indices @xmath4 .",
    "the @xmath5 s are displacement vectors in the lower layer as shown in fig .",
    "bead @xmath2 transmits a fraction @xmath6 of the force @xmath1 to the bead @xmath4 underneath it .",
    "these fractions are taken stochastically from a distribution satisfying the constraint @xmath7 which assures mechanical equilibrium in the vertical direction .",
    "so , we can write the force @xmath8 on the @xmath9th bead in a layer as @xmath10 as the weights of the particles are unimportant at infinite depth , we have left out the so  called injection term .",
    "the distribution of forces at infinite depth depends on the @xmath0distribution @xmath11 , where the symbol @xmath12 is a shorthand for all the @xmath6 at a given layer .",
    "this @xmath11 can be any function that is constrained by eq.([a1 ] ) .",
    "if we now assume that there are no correlations between the @xmath0values at different sites , the @xmath0distribution is of the form @xmath13 where @xmath14 is symmetric in its arguments @xmath6 .",
    "although we will refer to these @xmath0distributions as `` uncorrelated '' , note that there are always correlations between the @xmath6 of the same site due to the @xmath15constraint .    in the first part of this study , we show that there is only a limited set of @xmath14 for which the stationary force distribution can be written as a product of single  site distributions , and therefore is totally uncorrelated .",
    "this set is an extension of the set that was already identified by coppersmith et al .",
    "@xcite . in their extensive study",
    ", they also provided numerical evidence that , in general , correlations can persist .",
    "we will show that correlations are still absent in the second order moments .",
    "however , higher order correlations do exist and surprisingly enough , these turn out to decay algebraically .",
    "the results for the triangular packing and the fcc packing are summarized in table [ results ] , section [ discussion ] . in the last part of this work",
    ", we show that one induces 2point force correlations by allowing correlations between @xmath0values on different sites in a layer .",
    "these correlations will generically vanish with a power law , except for the triangular packing , where the decay of force correlations follows the decay of the @xmath0correlations .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ criterion ]",
    "we derive a criterion that a distribution @xmath14 has to obey in order to produce an uncorrelated stationary state .",
    "we then show in section [ factorization ] , that this criterion is only obeyed for a limited set of @xmath16 .",
    "after that , we study the nature of the correlations , by writing the evolution of the force moments as master equations in section [ moments ] , and by analysing the stationary solutions of these equations in section [ long  range ] .",
    "section [ correlq ] deals with the effects of allowing correlations between the @xmath17 of different sites in a layer , and the paper closes with a discussion .",
    "using the recursive nature of the force transmission , eq.([a2 ] ) , one can write down the following recursive relation for the force distribution @xcite : @xmath18 where we have introduced a vector notation for the forces in one layer @xmath19 , and for the integrations we use the abbreviations @xmath20 @xmath21 it is often convenient to work with the laplace transform of eq.([b1 ] ) . defining the laplace",
    "transform as @xmath22 the recursion simplifies to @xcite @xmath23 with @xmath24 the two representations eq.([b1 ] ) and ( [ b3 ] ) are equivalent , and they will both be used , depending on the nature of the problem .    the force distribution at infinite depth @xmath25 or @xmath26 can be obtained by finding the fixed point of the recursive relation .",
    "the main question of this section is to determine whether a given @xmath11 leads to a @xmath25 that is simply a product of single ",
    "site force distributions @xmath27 . in section [ correlq ]",
    "we will show that this can only be the case for @xmath0distributions of the type eq.([a3 ] ) .",
    "so for this section , the question is : which @xmath16 lead to uncorrelated asymptotic states ?    to answer this question ,",
    "let us assume that such a fixed point exists , i.e. @xmath28 inserting this ansatz into the laplace representation of the recursion relation , eq.([b3 ] ) , yields @xmath29 where the function @xmath30 is the outcome of the integral over the @xmath17 .",
    "the arguments represent the @xmath3 sites that are connected to site @xmath2 in the previous layer . integrating out all forces except those at the @xmath3 sites connected to @xmath2 means putting all @xmath31 except the set @xmath32 : @xmath33 this projection of the total force distribution can only factorize if @xmath30 is a product function as well , i.e. @xmath34 this leads to the following criterion for asymptotic factorization :    * given a @xmath0distribution @xmath35 , one can construct a factorized fixed point if , and only if , there is a function @xmath36 that satisfies the following condition : @xmath37^z \\,=\\ , \\prod_\\alpha   \\tilde{\\psi}(s_\\alpha ) .\\ ] ] * this function @xmath36 is related to the single  site distribution as @xmath38^z .\\ ] ]    here , we omitted the site index @xmath2 , and furthermore , our formulation depends only on @xmath3 ( the number of @xmath0values per site ) and not on the details of the lattice .",
    "it is a well  known fact that the so  called uniform distribution , in which @xmath14 is a constant , produces an uncorrelated asymptotic force distribution .",
    "in fact , coppersmith et al . identified a countable set of @xmath0distributions , of which the uniform distribution is a member , that have this property @xcite .",
    "although it might seem obvious that a uniform distribution leads to an uncorrelated asymptotic state , it is really not trivial . due to the constraint of eq.([a1 ] ) , there are correlations between the @xmath6 on each site @xmath2 , which induce force correlations that only disappear under the special conditions discussed in the previous section , eq.([b8 ] ) . in this section",
    ", we will show when these special conditions are obeyed .",

    "coppersmith et al . already found these @xmath0distributions for integer values of @xmath46 , also based on eq.([zinnjust ] ) @xcite .",
    "however , it holds for any real @xmath47 .",
    "this means that the set for which the stationary force distribution factorizes is substantially larger ; it ranges from the infinitely sharp distribution ( @xmath48 ) to the critical distribution ( @xmath49 ) @xcite .",
    "note that one recovers the results for the uniform distribution by putting @xmath50 .",
    "although there is a huge variety of @xmath0distributions that lead to uncorrelated force distributions , in general one can not find a @xmath36 that obeys eq.([b8 ] ) .",
    "we will prove this by making a taylor expansion of @xmath36 @xmath51 and then try to solve for the coefficients @xmath52 by imposing eq.([b8 ] ) .",
    "it turns out that the equations can only be solved under special conditions , which are precisely obeyed by the class of @xmath0distributions given by eq.([c2 ] ) .",
    "let us first focus on the left hand side ( lhs ) of eq.([b8 ] ) .",
    "the taylor expansion will give rise to terms of the type @xmath53 , which have to be integrated over all @xmath54 .",
    "this leads to terms @xmath55 with prefactors given by the _",
    "moments _ of @xmath35 @xmath56 these moments are not independent , due to the constraint eq.([a1 ] ) . in appendix [ qmoments ] , we show that the moments @xmath57 are in fact sufficient to characterize all relevant moments of eq.([c6 ] ) .",
    "besides the moments , there are of course additional prefactors consisting of combinations of the @xmath52 ; these are the quantities we try to find , for a given @xmath0distribution @xmath35 .    the right hand side ( rhs ) of eq.([b8 ] ) also produces terms @xmath58 , with prefactors @xmath59 .",
    "the remaining task is to equate the prefactors of the terms @xmath58 on both sides of the equation .",
    "this gives a set of equations , from which one can try to solve for the @xmath52 .    the zeroth order equation is trivially obeyed for any @xmath60 , as can be seen by putting all @xmath61 . for convenience",
    "we fix @xmath62 .",
    "the same happens at first order , since for each @xmath5 , the lhs contains @xmath3 terms @xmath63 , and the rhs is simply @xmath64 .",
    "the first non - trivial equation appears at second order .",
    "there are two equations , for @xmath65 and for @xmath66 where @xmath67 : @xmath68 \\displaystyle \\left ( z \\psi_2 + { z ( z-1 ) \\over 2 } \\psi^2_1 \\right ) \\frac{2(1-z\\eta_2)}{z(z-1 ) }   & = & \\psi^2_1 \\end{array } \\right .\\ ] ] due to the constraint @xmath69 , one can obtain an identity by multiplying the first equation by @xmath3 , and adding it to the second equation multiplied by @xmath70 .",
    "hence , the two equations are not independent and @xmath71 can be solved .",
    "the value of @xmath71 depends only on @xmath72 , the second moment of the @xmath0distribution @xcite .    working out the combinatorics of the higher orders ,",
    "one finds the following general mathematical structure :    * at the @xmath73th order , there are as many equations as there are different partitions @xmath74 that make @xmath75 .",
    "permutations should not be considered as different because @xmath35 is symmetric in its arguments . *",
    "one of these equations is dependent , as one can obtain an identity by adding the equations , after multiplication by appropriate factors .    for @xmath76",
    ", there are two third order equations , corresponding to the partitions @xmath77 and @xmath78 , of which only one is independent .",
    "this means that @xmath79 can be solved as a function of @xmath72 ( in appendix [ qmoments ] we show that @xmath80 depends on @xmath72 , for @xmath76 ) .",
    "we run into problems at fourth order , where we have @xmath81 , @xmath82 and @xmath83 , and hence two a priori independent equations for one coefficient @xmath84 .",
    "it turns out that the remaining equations are only identical if there is a relation between @xmath85 and @xmath72 , namely @xmath86 in appendix [ qmoments ] , it is shown that this relation is precisely obeyed by the class of @xmath0 distributions eq.([c2 ] ) for which @xmath36 was already solved .",
    "the fact that the expansion of @xmath87^{1/z}$ ] only fails at fourth order implies that a mean field approximation , in which one explicitly assumes a product state , does give the exact results up to the third moment of @xmath88 .",
    "this is precisely the reason why the mean field solution @xmath89 differs only marginally from the real solution . to be more precise ,",
    "the deviation @xmath90 should change sign @xmath91 times , since it does not affect all moments lower than @xmath92 . a careful inspection of the numerical results in @xcite for a @xmath0distribution in which @xmath93 or @xmath94 shows that these small `` wiggles '' are indeed present .",
    "to magnify this effect , we show our simulation data in fig .",
    "[ wiggles ] .",
    "distribution with @xmath93 or @xmath94 .",
    "the small deviation @xmath90 changes sign @xmath91 times.,width=226 ]    for @xmath95 , the problems already appear at third order .",
    "since we have @xmath96 , @xmath97 and @xmath98 , we encounter two independent equations for @xmath79 .",
    "again , it turns out that the equations can be solved if there is an additional relation between the @xmath0moments : @xmath99    for @xmath100 , there are two independent third order equations as well , originating from @xmath101 , @xmath102 and @xmath103",
    ". this problem can always be overcome by assuming a particular relation between the moments @xmath80 and @xmath72 , corresponding to the special @xmath0distributions of eq.([c2 ] ) . since at higher orders",
    "the number of equations per coefficient @xmath52 becomes increasingly high , there will be no other @xmath0distributions than those of eq.([c2 ] ) that obey eq.([b8 ] ) , and thus have an uncorrelated force distribution .",
    "now that we know that , in general , correlations do exist in the stationary force distributions , it is interesting to study the nature of these correlations . in this section , we write the evolution of the moments as master equations , along the lines of ref . @xcite . with this formalism , we will , in the next section , analyze the correlations by finding the stationary states of these master equations .",
    "first , let us define the second moments of a distribution as @xmath104 we have reintroduced the site  index @xmath2 , and @xmath105 is a displacement  vector in a layer .",
    "as the system is translationally invariant , these second moments depend only on the displacement @xmath105 .",
    "the recursion for these moments is obtained by combining eq.([a2 ] ) and eq.([b1 ] ) as @xmath106 using the overline notation for the @xmath0averages again , eq.([d2 ] ) becomes @xmath107 this relation is reveals from which points ( in correlation  space ) the moment @xmath108 receives a contribution during a recursion step .",
    "however , it is in fact easier to consider the opposite relation , revealing how much a moment contributes to correlation space points during recursion .",
    "the `` inverse '' of eq.([d3 ] ) becomes @xmath109 this latter relation allows for a master equation type formulation , as we may write it in the form @xmath110 the transition rates are defined as @xmath111 with @xmath112 determined by the set @xmath113 as @xmath114 in the current problem , where we consider second order moments , the transition rates are particularly simple . if @xmath115 , the @xmath0averages are independent , and will always give the value @xmath116 ( this only holds for @xmath0distributions of the type eq.([a3 ] ) ) . if @xmath117 , one encounters second moments of @xmath35 , as in eq.([c6 ] ) .",
    "this leads to the following transition rates : @xmath118 so , the moments evolve in an anomalous diffusion process , with differing transition  rates at the origin . for a detailed discussion of the corresponding dynamics , see ref . @xcite .",
    "note that this diffusion takes place in a @xmath119 dimensional space , as @xmath5 , and therefore also @xmath112 , is a displacement in a layer . in the remainder of this paper we use the bold notation @xmath120 whenever the displacement is really a vector .",
    "the advantage of this somewhat formal representation is that we can take it over to higher order moments without further ado .",
    "the generalization of the master equation for the @xmath73th order moments @xmath121 becomes : @xmath122 with the position indices @xmath123 , and the displacements @xmath120 defined as @xmath124 the dimensionality of the diffusion process has now become @xmath125 .",
    "the transition rates can be calculated as @xmath126 analogous to the second moments , these transition rates are all @xmath127 , as long as the indices of the position vector @xmath128 are not equal to zero nor coincide .",
    "however , the differing rates make the problem complicated , because one has to deal with different transition rates at special points , lines , planes etc . in the space of diffusion",
    ".    one can now study the correlations at infinite depth by finding stationary states of the master equation for the moments . as a first attempt to construct a stationary solution ,",
    "i.e. @xmath129 , one can try a detailed balance solution .",
    "detailed balance means that there is no flow of `` probability '' from one point to another . in that case , all terms of the sum on the right hand side of eq.([d10 ] ) vanish individually , i.e. @xmath130 this condition can also be formulated in terms of _ elementary loops _ , which are the smallest possible pathways from a point to itself . for all lattices in this study , these elementary loops are triangles , and we denote the three jump rates as @xmath131 or @xmath132 depending on the direction in which the loop is traversed .",
    "it is easily verified that the property @xmath133 must be obeyed in _ all _ elementary loops in order to have a detailed balance solution . in the next section",
    "we show that correlations appear whenever the detailed balance conditions are not obeyed .",
    "in this section , we study the nature of the correlations for @xmath0distributions of the type eq.([a3 ] ) that do not fall into the special class of eq.([c2 ] ) .",
    "we first solve the stationary master equation for the second order moments , for which we already know that there are no correlations ( section [ factorization ] ) .",
    "for the triangular packing ( @xmath76 ) , correlations only show up at fourth order , and these fall off as @xmath134 . for @xmath135 , there are third order correlations that also decay with a power law ; for the fcc packing ( @xmath95 ) the decay is @xmath136 .",
    "finally , we provide a simple relation to calculate the various exponents .      in order to get familiar with the structure of the master equations , we first consider the second order moments desribed by eq.([d5 ] ) . away from the origin @xmath117 , all transition rates of eq.([d8 ] ) are identical .",
    "therefore , the detailed balance condition eq.([e1 ] ) requires all @xmath137 to be identical .",
    "the value at the origin @xmath138 has to obey a detailed balance condition for each @xmath139 , but these equations are identical for all @xmath112 because the corresponding rates are the same .",
    "putting @xmath140 , one obtains the following stationary solution : @xmath141 this solution precisely describes an asymptotic state without any 2point correlations , as the average of the product @xmath142 equals the product of the averages for all @xmath143 .",
    "of course , any multiple of eq.([e2 ] ) , also forms a stationary solution of eq.([d5 ] ) .",
    "however , these solutions are physically irrelevant in the thermodynamic limit , where the lattice size @xmath144 @xcite .",
    "moreover , we find that the asymptotic second force moment is solely determined by @xmath3 and @xmath72 . for critical @xmath0distributions",
    "one has @xmath145 , leading to a diverging second moment .",
    "the diffusion of third order moments @xmath146 takes place on a @xmath147dimensional lattice , since there are two free parameters @xmath105 and @xmath148 of dimension @xmath119 . on this lattice , there are three _ special subspaces _ , namely @xmath117 , @xmath149 , and @xmath150 , for which the transition rates of eq.([d12 ] ) differ from the _",
    "bulk_value @xmath151 .",
    "moreover , the rates at the origin @xmath152 differ from both the bulk  rates and the rates on the special subspaces .",
    "let us first consider the triangular packing ( @xmath76 ) , for which the third order moments diffuse on a @xmath153dimensional lattice , with differing rates on three special lines .",
    "as these lines are all equivalent , it is natural to draw them at an angle of @xmath154 , see fig .",
    "[ triang ] .",
    "we then obtain a triangular lattice , with transitions to six nearest neighbors and two _ self jumps _",
    ", which are `` transitions '' to the same lattice site ( @xmath155 ) .",
    "the detailed balance condition between a special line and the bulk is naturally identical to the second order condition , implying the same ratio as in eq.([e2 ] ) . as the transition rates at the origin are again identical for each @xmath156 ( because of symmetry )",
    ", one can construct the following detailed balance solution : @xmath157 this means that there are also no @xmath158point correlations for @xmath76 : at the origin we encounter @xmath159 , on the lines we have @xmath160 , and in the bulk @xmath161 .",
    "it is easily checked that condition eq.([enew1 ] ) is indeed satisfied in every elementary loop .        for the fcc packing ( @xmath95 ) ,",
    "the third order moments diffuse on a @xmath91dimensional lattice . unlike the @xmath76 packing",
    ", it is not possible to construct a detailed balance solution in this case .",
    "first , we write the displacement vectors as @xmath162 , where the @xmath5 s and @xmath112 s are 2dimensional vectors ( fig .",

    "one can jump away from the origin with two different rates , namely @xmath163 and @xmath164 .",
    "these rates correspond to @xmath165 ( towards a special plane ) and @xmath166 ( into the bulk ) respectively .",

    ", however , it is not possible to construct a detailed balance solution for the third order moments . in the next paragraph",
    ", we show that the absence of detailed balance indicates that there are force  correlations , that decay with a power law ; in this case the decay is @xmath136 .",

    "the symmetry of the bcc lattice allows only harmonics with @xmath205 , leading to the observed @xmath134 decay .",
    "so we find that the stationary master equation for the moments becomes a discrete poisson s equation , and the presence of differing transition rates leads to a multipole source around the location of these rates , see eq.([enew7 ] ) .",
    "however , this source is only `` active '' if there is no detailed balance , since detailed balance leads to trivial solutions like eq.([e3 ] ) @xcite . keeping this in mind ,",
    "let us now investigate the real fourth order problem , including the differing rates at the special lines and planes .",
    "we argue that the asymptotic value is still approached as @xmath134 , but the amplitude of this field will be modified . since there is no detailed balance , the differing rates at the lines and planes will act as sources as well .",
    "their amplitudes , however , will decay with increasing distance , since the `` flow '' associated with the absence of detailed balance becomes zero at @xmath206 .",
    "the effect of the induced sources at the special lines and planes can be taken into account perturbatively .",
    "the first step is to only consider the effect of the origin , as we have done above .",
    "the second step would be to compute the strength of the sources at the lines and planes on the basis of the first order solution , and then to determine their function @xmath194 and recalculate the solution eq.([enew8 ] ) .",
    "the induced sources around the origin basically lead to a modification of the strength @xmath198 , but not of the asymptotic decay .",
    "however , the far away points at the lines and planes could modify the asymptotic decay .",
    "a closer inspection of the field of these sources shows that it is of order @xmath207 , since the differing rates lead to a local laplacian acting on the first order field decaying as @xmath134 .",
    "hence , every step of this perturbative calculation yields a leading term @xmath134 ; the amplitude changes in every step and its determination is a difficult problem indeed .      from the previous section ,",
    "it is clear that correlations occur whenever the detailed balance condition is frustrated around the origin .",
    "the stationary master equation then becomes a discrete poisson s equation in @xmath125 dimensions , leading to correlations that decay with an integer power of the distance @xmath46 .",
    "following the derivation in appendix [ appbcc ] , it is clear that the asymptotic behavior comes from the lowest non  isotropic term in @xmath194 , since division by @xmath208 gives a singularity .",
    "the value of the exponent can be calculated as @xmath209 where @xmath125 is the dimensionality of the correlation space and @xmath210 is the order of the lowest non  isotropic terms in the expansion of @xmath194 .",
    "although this result is remarkably simple , the actual calculation of @xmath194 is not trivial , as it reflects the symmetries of the jump directions on the @xmath125 dimensional lattice .",
    "working out the @xmath91dimensional lattice of the third order moments in the fcc packing , we find that @xmath211 and correlations vanish as @xmath136 .",
    "so far , we have only discussed @xmath0distributions of the type eq.([a3 ] ) , for which there are no correlations between @xmath0values at different sites .",
    "we have shown that , for these @xmath0distributions , there are no asymptotic @xmath153point force correlations . in this section",
    "we will demonstrate that even the smallest correlation between @xmath0values at different sites induces @xmath153point force correlations .",
    "we first solve the problem for arbitrary correlations in the triangular packing .",
    "then , we study the fcc packing assuming only a nearest  neighbor @xmath0correlation ; this already leads to force correlations that decay as @xmath212 .      in general , the ( second order )",
    "transition rates are defined by eq.([d6 ] ) . for @xmath76 ,",
    "the displacement vector @xmath5 can only take two values , for which we conveniently choose @xmath213 .",
    "this allows us to write the transition rates as @xmath214 asymptotically @xmath215 has to approach the value 1/4 , for @xmath0distributions without long  ranged correlations . as the second moments diffuse on a line , one can easily construct a detailed balance solution : @xmath216 m(k-1 ) = \\left[1/2-w_0(k)\\right ] m(k),\\ ] ] or @xmath217 this is the general form of the @xmath153point force correlations @xmath218 in the triangular packing , as a function of @xmath215 that describes the @xmath0correlations .",
    "one can draw two interesting conclusions from this result .",
    "first of all , there can only be an uncorrelated solution if @xmath215 is constant ( i.e. @xmath219 ) for each @xmath220 .",
    "this means that even the smallest @xmath0correlations lead to force correlations .",
    "secondly , the long distance behavior of the @xmath153point force correlations is identical to that of the @xmath153point @xmath0correlations , following from the simplicity of eq.([f3 ] ) .",
    "unfortunately , the analysis is much more complicated for the fcc packing , whose second order moments live on the @xmath153dimensional triangular lattice of fig .",
    "[ triangfcc ] .",
    "we therefore allow only correlations between @xmath0values at neighboring sites .",
    "remember that one can easily construct an uncorrelated solution @xmath178 for uncorrelated @xmath0distributions , eq.([e2 ] ) , since all detailed balance conditions at the origin are identical by symmetry .",
    "this still holds when there are nearest neighbor correlations .",
    "however , the detailed balance condition will now be frustrated on the ring of surrounding sites , as these are connected in four a priori different directions , see fig .",
    "[ triangfcc ] . in analogy to the problem discussed in the previous section , the stationary master equation for @xmath181 transforms into @xmath221 the",
    "`` charge density '' @xmath222 is only non - zero around the frustrated ring , see appendix [ appfcc ] .",
    "again , it is a discrete version of poisson s equation , but now in @xmath153dimensions .",
    "the solution can therefore be expanded in cylindrical harmonics , @xmath223 , and the six  fold symmetry of the lattice requires @xmath224 .",
    "the problem is again solved rigorously by fourier transformation of eq.([f4 ] ) . in appendix [ appfcc ]",
    "we show that @xmath225 which is in agreement with the simple electrostatic picture .",
    "so , for the fcc packing , we find that even a nearest ",
    "neighbor @xmath0correlation leads to @xmath153point force correlations that decay with a power law .",
    "this algebraic decay is generic for @xmath226 since any @xmath0correlations lead to a master equation whose detailed balance relations can not be solved around the origin .",
    "we have studied force correlations in the @xmath0model at infinite depth , for general @xmath0distributions .",
    "the calculated correlation functions are rather unusual : for @xmath0distributions of the type eq.([a3 ] ) , correlations only show up at higher orders , and these correlations decay with a power of the distance .",
    "the only exceptions are the @xmath0distributions given by eq.([c2 ] ) , which do produce a factorized force distribution .",
    "the results for the triangular packing and the fcc packing are summarized in table [ results ] . as an example , consider two different sites @xmath2 and @xmath227 in a layer of the triangular packing . since there are no correlations in the second and third order force moments , we find @xmath228 and @xmath229 , independent of the distance @xmath105 . however , the moments @xmath230 and @xmath231 are correlated and approach their asympotitic value as @xmath232 .",
    "the fact that one has to go to higher orders to observe force correlations is the reason why numerical simulations only marginally differ from the mean field solutions @xcite .",
    "the ( single  site ) mean field solutions @xmath89 are correct up to the third order moments , for the triangular packing .",
    "this implies that @xmath89 `` wiggles '' around the real solution @xmath88 ; the deviation @xmath90 changes its sign @xmath91 times ( fig .",
    "[ wiggles ] ) .",
    "packings that have more than three @xmath0values per site ( @xmath226 ) already have third order correlations .",
    "also this time correlations only decay algebraically ; for the fcc packing we find @xmath136 .",
    "this algebraic decay can be understood from an analogy with electrostatics .",
    "the force moments evolve according to a master equation , and the corresponding stationary state is described by a discrete version of poisson s equation .",
    "the `` source '' turns out to be a multipole around the origin , which is only active whenever the master equation has no simple detailed balance solution .",
    "the moments therefore approach their asymptotic ( uncorrelated ) values algebraically .",
    "the value of the exponent depends on the dimension of the correlation space @xmath125 , and on the symmetry of the multipole , see eq.([enew10 ] ) .",
    "although in general correlations do exist , there is a special class of @xmath0distributions , given by eq.([c2 ] ) , for which there are no force correlations at all .",
    "this has been demonstrated by means of condition ( [ b8 ] ) , which has a nice physical interpretation .",
    "it can be shown that the function @xmath233 is the laplace transform of the distribution of _ interparticle forces _ that live on the bonds connecting the particles : @xmath234 .",
    "although the @xmath0 s leaving a site are correlated ( they have to add up to @xmath235 ) , the corresponding @xmath236 can become statistically independent .",
    "it is only when this miracle happens that the force distribution becomes a product state .",
    "nevertheless , the @xmath0distributions for which this is the case range from infinitely sharp ( @xmath206 ) to almost critical ( @xmath237 ) .",
    "finally , we found that there will be 2point force correlations whenever the @xmath0values of different sites are correlated . even with only nearest neighbor @xmath0correlations , the fcc packing has force correlations that vanish as @xmath212 .",
    "again , the triangular packing is less sensitive for correlations ; the nature of the force correlations is identical to that of the @xmath0correlations , eq.([f3 ] ) .",
