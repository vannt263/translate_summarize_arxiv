    "[ fig : di - hadron ]     the ampleness of data being produced at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) offers us a faultless chance to study the dynamics of strong interactions in the high - energy limit . in this kinematical regime , the balitsky - fadin - kuraev - lipatov ( bfkl )",
    "approach  @xcite represents the most effective tool to perform the resummation to all orders of the leading ( lla ) and the next - to - leading terms ( nla ) of the qcd perturbative series which are heightened by powers of large energy logarithms .",
    "the inclusive production of two jets with high transverse momenta and well separated in rapidity , known as mueller  navelet reaction  @xcite , has been one of the most studied processes in the last years . for this reaction ,",
    "the bfkl resummation with nla accuracy relies on the combination of two ingredients : the nla green s function of the bfkl equation  @xcite and the nla jet vertices  @xcite . in  @xcite nla bfkl predictions of cross sections and azimuthal angle correlations for the mueller - navelet jet process , observables",
    "earlier proposed in  @xcite , were given , showing a very good agreement with experimental data at the lhc  @xcite . in order to further and deeply probe the dynamical mechanisms behind partonic interactions in the regge limit , @xmath0 , some other observables , sensitive to the bfkl dynamics ,",
    "should be considered in the context of the lhc physics program .",
    "an interesting option , the detection of three and four jets , well separated in rapidity from each other , was recently suggested in  @xcite and investigated in  @xcite . in this paper a novel possibility , _",
    "i.e. _ the inclusive production of two charged light hadrons : @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 featuring high transverse momenta and separated by a large rapidity interval , together with an undetected gluon radiation emission is proposed  ( see figure  [ fig : di - hadron ] ) . for this process , similarly to the mueller - navelet reaction , the bfkl resummation in the nla is viable , since nla expression for the vertex describing the production of an identified hadron , was obtained in  @xcite .",
    "on one side , hadrons can be detected at the lhc at much smaller values of the transverse momentum than jets , allowing us to explore an additional kinematic range , supplementary to the one studied with mueller  navelet jets .",
    "on the other side , this process makes it possible to constrain not only the parton densities ( pdfs ) for the initial proton , but also the parton fragmentation functions ( ffs ) describing the detected hadron in the final state .",
    "it is known that the inclusion of nla terms makes a very large effect on the theory predictions for the mueller  navelet jet cross sections and the jet azimuthal angle distributions .",
    "similar features are expected also for our case of inclusive dihadron production .",
    "this results in a large dependence of predictions on the choice of the renormalization scale @xmath5 and the factorization scale @xmath6 . here",
    "we will take @xmath7 and adopt the brodsky - lepage - mackenzie ( blm ) scheme  @xcite for the renormalization scale setting as derived in its `` exact '' version in  @xcite .",
    "the process under investigation is the hadroproduction of a pair of identified hadrons in proton - proton collisions @xmath8 where the two hadrons are characterized by high transverse momenta , @xmath9 and large separation in rapidity @xmath10 , with @xmath11 and @xmath12 taken as sudakov vectors .",
    "the differential cross section of the process can be presented as @xmath13 \\;,\\ ] ] where @xmath14 , with @xmath15 the two hadrons azimuthal angles , while @xmath16 gives the total cross section and the other coefficients @xmath17 determine the azimuthal angle distribution of the two hadrons . in order to match the kinematic cuts used by the cms collaboration",
    ", we consider the _ integrated coefficients _ given by @xmath18 and their ratios @xmath19 .",
    "for the integrations over rapidities and transverse momenta we use the limits , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 gev , which are realistic values for the identified hadron detection at lhc .",
    "we use the pdf set mstw 2008 nlo  @xcite with two different nlo parameterizations for hadron ffs : akk  @xcite and hkns  @xcite . pursuing the goal to stress the potential relevance of the process we are proposing , rather than to give a high - precision prediction",
    ", we present our first results neglecting the nla parts of hadron vertices and planning their inclusion as the mail goal of a later , more technical publication . in figure",
    "[ fig : hadrons ] the dependence on the final state rapidity interval @xmath23 , of the @xmath24-averaged cross section @xmath25 and of the ratios @xmath26 , @xmath27 , and @xmath28 at the center - of - mass energy @xmath29 tev is shown .",

    "the general features of our predictions are rather similar to the respective ones of the mueller  navelet jet process .",
    "although the bfkl resummation predicts a growth with energy of the partonic cross section , the convolution of the latter with proton pdfs leads to a decrease with @xmath23 of @xmath25 .",
    "the decreasing behavior with @xmath23 of the @xmath34 azimuthal ratios is due to the increasing amount of undetected parton radiation @xmath35 ( see equation  ( [ eq : process ] ) ) in the final state allowed by the growth of the partonic subprocess energy .",
    "we present our nla blm predictions together with the results we obtained in lla , using both blm and natural scale setting ( @xmath36 , always smaller than the blm one )",
    ". plots of figure  [ fig : hadrons ] show that lla results at blm scales lie closer to the nla blm ones than lla results at natural scales .",
    "in this paper we investigated the dihadron production process at the lhc at the center - of - mass energy of @xmath37  tev , giving the first theoretical predictions for cross sections and azimuthal angle correlations in the lla and partial nla bfkl approach .",
    "we implemented the exact version of the blm optimization procedure in order to make completely vanish the  @xmath38-dependence in our observables and minimize the size of the nla corrections .",
    "we found that our nla blm predictions are close to the lla blm ones , while the lla calculations at natural scales overestimate the total cross section @xmath25 and predict a stronger decorrelation for the azimuthal ratios @xmath34 .",
    "the good agreement between lla and nla at blm scales is a direct consequence of the small size of the higher - order corrections , representing so a clear signal of the reliability of the blm method .",
    "however , more accurate analyses are still needed : full nla calculations including next - to - leading order hadron vertices , together with the study of larger rapidity intervals in the final state and considering the effect of a different choice for the factorization scale @xmath6 with respect to the renormalization scale @xmath5 , are underway  @xcite . in view of all these considerations ,",
    "we encourage experimental collaborations to include the study of the dihadron production in the program of future analyses at the lhc , making use of a new suitable channel to improve our knowledge about the dynamics of strong interactions in the regge limit .",
