    "recall that a ( complete deterministic ) automaton @xmath0 with state set @xmath1 and alphabet @xmath2 is called _ synchronizing _ if there is a word @xmath3 such that @xmath4 .",
    "the word @xmath5 is called a _ synchronizing word_. the main conjecture in this area is :    an @xmath6-state synchronizing automaton admits a synchronizing word of length at most @xmath7 .",
    "there is a vast literature on this subject .",
    "see for example  @xcite . the best known upper bound is cubic  @xcite , whereas it is known that one can not do better than @xmath7  @xcite .",
    "my goal here in this note is not to prove the ern conjecture for a new class of automata , but rather to give a no - frills , uniform approach to an argument that underlies a growing number of results in the ern conjecture literature ( cf .",
    "underlying all these results ( as well as the more difficult results of  @xcite and  @xcite ) are two simple ideas :    * if a finite sequence of numbers is not constant , then it must at some place exceed its average ; * finite dimensional vector spaces satisfy the ascending chain condition on subspaces .",
    "the latter idea is often cloaked in the language of rational power series .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section i state what i call the `` averaging lemma . ''",
    "it is a method , with a probabilistic flavor , for obtaining bounds on lengths of synchronizing words . before proving the lemma ,",
    "i show how to deduce from it kari s solution of the ern conjecture for eulerian automata , as well as recent results of bal and perrin  @xcite for one - cluster automata and carpi and dalessandro  @xcite for ( locally ) strongly transitive automata .",
    "we also recover an old result of rystsov  @xcite on regular automata ( which is essentially the same thing as strongly transitive automata ) .",
    "in fact , we obtain new generalizations of all these results .",
    "the final section proves the averaging lemma .",
    "let @xmath2 be an alphabet . denote by @xmath8 the free monoid on @xmath2 and put @xmath9 the ring of polynomials with real coefficients in the non - commuting variables @xmath2 is denoted @xmath10 . by a ( finitely supported ) _ probability _ on @xmath8 , we mean an element @xmath11 such that : @xmath12 for all @xmath3 , and @xmath13 the _ support _ of @xmath14 is @xmath15 notice that if @xmath16 and @xmath17 are probabilities , then so is @xmath18 .",

    "random variable _ , then the _ expected value _ of @xmath21 ( with respect to the probability @xmath14 ) is : @xmath22 the fundamental property of a random variable that we exploit in this paper is that either it is almost surely constant ( and equal to its expectation ) , or with positive probability it exceeds it expectation .",
    "more precisely , it is immediate from and the definition of a probability that either @xmath23 for all @xmath24 , or there is a value @xmath24 with @xmath25 .",

    "we use @xmath34^t$ ] to denote the transpose vector .",

    "if @xmath60 is odd , then the proof shows that the bounds in lemma  [ expand ] can be improved to @xmath61 and @xmath62 , respectively .",
    "before , proving the lemma , let us use it to derive anew some results from the literature .",
    "the first is a result of kari on synchronizing eulerian automata  @xcite .",
    "an automaton is _ eulerian _ if its underlying graph admits an eulerian directed path , or equivalently , it is strongly connected and the in - degree of every vertex is the same as the out - degree ( and hence is the alphabet size ) . actually , we can generalize his result .    let us say that a strongly connected automaton @xmath0 is _ pseudo - eulerian _ if we can find a probability @xmath14 with support @xmath2 such that the matrix @xmath63 is doubly stochastic ( i.e. , each row and column of @xmath14 adds up to @xmath64 ) .",
    "for instance , if @xmath51 is eulerian with adjacency matrix @xmath65 and @xmath66 , then we can set @xmath67 one checks that @xmath68 , and hence is doubly stochastic by the eulerian hypothesis .",
    "thus every eulerian automaton is pseudo - eulerian .",
