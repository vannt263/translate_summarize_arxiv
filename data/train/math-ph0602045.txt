    "in order to clearly state the question addressed here , it is important to recall some points of the mathematical foundation of observables in quantum mechanics .",
    "there will be two main contributions , one related to some weak solutions of the schrdinger equation and other to dimensional interpretations .",
    "the problem of finding the correct self - adjoint extension describing the quantum ( schrdinger ) operator corresponding to a physical model can be subtle and difficult . usually the physicist has a clear expression for the operator , an unbounded one acting in a hilbert space  @xmath0 , but it is not obvious which domain should be taken ( some general references for what follows are @xcite ) .",
    "let @xmath1 denote the inner product in  @xmath2 ; if @xmath3 is a linear operator acting on its dense domain @xmath4 , then to represent a physical observable it is necessary that @xmath3 is hermitian , i.e. , @xmath5 however this condition is not enough to guarantee that @xmath3 has real spectrum and the time evolution it generates is unitary ; the right condition is self - adjointness .",
    "the domain of its adjoin @xmath6 is @xmath7 and for @xmath8 one has @xmath9 it follows that @xmath6 is well defined if @xmath10 is dense in @xmath0 , and @xmath3 is hermitian if , and only if , @xmath6 is an extension of @xmath3 .",
    "the operator @xmath3 is self - adjoint if @xmath11 .",
    "notice also that ( often ) for bounded operators the distinction between hermitian and self - adjoint operators does not exist .",
    "as already mentioned , usually @xmath3 is hermitian with dense domain , and one asks if it is also self - adjoint or has any self - adjoint extension ; such extensions are the candidates for the operator describing the related physical observable .",
    "a nice situation that often occurs , in particular for the hamiltonian of the hydrogen atom ( and other atomic systems as well ) , is that @xmath3 is essentially self - adjoint , i.e. , it has just one self - adjoint extension and the physical operator is well determined .",
    "however , there are situations where there are infinitely many self - adjoint extensions and each one should correspond to a different physical circumstance ; the choice is a physical one , not on mathematical bases .",
    "even worse , some hermitian operators have no self - adjoint extensions !    the standard example of such framework is the momentum operator @xmath12 for a particle in a box @xmath13 $ ] . in this case",
    "@xmath14 $ ] , it is natural to take @xmath15 as smooth functions @xmath16 such that @xmath17 ( so that the particle remains confined to the box ) ; the self - adjoint extensions of this hermitian operator are @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is a complex number with @xmath20 , and all elements of @xmath21 satisfy @xmath22 .",
    "it is worth remarking that if @xmath3 is hermitian and @xmath23 , then @xmath3 is bounded , so that in general such domain questions are not avoidable .",
    "these interesting problems are well explored in the literature , and as additional references see @xcite and for applications to the one - dimensional hydrogen atom see  @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , there are some delicate issues in the mathematical foundations of quantum mechanics that seem not yet exploited from the physical point of view",
    ". the main goal of this work is to discuss one of such issues and relate it to a physical situation .",
    "recall that a self - adjoint hamiltonian operator @xmath24 generates a time evolution @xmath25 , which is a solution of the schrdinger equation @xmath26 since @xmath27 is a family of unitary operators , for any time @xmath28 its domain is the whole hilbert space @xmath0 , so that it is meaningful to consider @xmath29 for @xmath30 but with @xmath31 , i.e. , the time evolution is not restricted to the domain of @xmath24 .",
    "sometimes @xmath29 , for @xmath31 , is called a weak solution of the schrdinger equation .",
    "an unusual situation will be presented .",
    "a self - adjoint operator @xmath24 with dense @xmath32 will be considered , vectors @xmath33 not belonging to its domain will be given , although they are pseudo - eigenvectors of @xmath24 , that is , @xmath34 for @xmath35 . some numerical calculations will indicate that @xmath36 has a nonzero component in the continuous subspace of @xmath24 , so that the nave time evolution built from ( [ pseudoeigenvalue1 ] ) gives an incorrect answer .",
    "it will be argued that such solutions are related to the same model in smaller dimensions .",
    "furthermore , the physical system in question is one of the most celebrated models in quantum mechanics , the three dimensional ( 3d ) hydrogen atom .",
    "the hermitian hamiltonian of the 3d hydrogen atom is @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the electron mass , @xmath39 its electric charge and @xmath40 denotes the set of smooth functions with compact support .",
    "this operator is essentially self - adjoint and its unique self - adjoint extension @xmath41 , _ the _",
    "3d hydrogen atom hamiltonian , reads @xmath42 with @xmath43 denoting an appropriate sobolev space ; in particular , @xmath43 is a subspace of @xmath44 , it is also the natural domain of the free particle hamiltonian and all its elements are continuous functions  @xcite .    the usual spectral analysis of @xmath41 can be performed and its well - known eigenvalues @xmath45 can be found . recall that the closed subspace @xmath46 generated by its eigenvectors is named the point subspace of @xmath41 and its orthogonal complement @xmath47 is a nontrivial subspace ( i.e. , it has nonzero elements ) and named the absolutely continuous ( or scattering ) subspace of @xmath41 .",
    "physically , the members of @xmath46 are the bound states while the elements of @xmath47 describe the ionizing atomic states ( this interpretation follows , for instance , by the rage theorem @xcite ) .    the eigenvalue equation for the 3d hydrogen atom hamiltonian is separable in spherical coordinates @xmath48 , and by taking the standard representation @xmath49 the equation for @xmath50 is given by  @xcite @xmath51 with @xmath52 and @xmath53 being integer constants .",
    "for each @xmath54 value one has @xmath55 .",
    "consider first the particular case @xmath56 ; it follows that @xmath57 and ( [ thetaeq ] ) reduces to @xmath58 the usual normalized solution of this equation is @xmath59 . however , there is also the additional solution ( that will play a major role here ) @xmath60.\\ ] ] this is just one instance of additional solutions @xmath61 of ( [ thetaeq ] ) for @xmath62 as above ; such solutions are legendre function of the second kind  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath61 solutions have been discarded in the mathematical literature since they are not continuous at @xmath63 and @xmath64 , and so via ( [ rtp ] ) they do not generate elements in the domain of @xmath41 ; and discarded in the physical literature  @xcite by arguing they are not bounded functions .    by taking the usual radial @xmath65 and azimuthal @xmath66 solutions for the 3d hydrogen atom , set ( @xmath67 ) @xmath68 ^ 3 } \\right]^\\frac12 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{r}{n a_0}\\right)\\left(\\frac{2 r}{n a_0}\\right)^\\ell l^{2 \\ell+ 1}_{n+\\ell}\\left(\\frac{2 r}{n a_0 } \\right)\\ ] ] so that one gets the standard eigenfunctions ( here restricted to @xmath57 ) @xmath69 and now the additional ones    @xmath70 where @xmath71 denotes the bohr radius and @xmath72 are the laguerre polynomials .    for @xmath73 the probability density generated by @xmath61 diverges ( recall",
    "the jacobian is @xmath74 ) , i.e. , @xmath75 thus the corresponding functions @xmath76 do not belong to the hilbert space @xmath44 .",
    "hence , it is meaningless to talk about their time evolution even as weak solutions of the 3d hydrogen atom schrdinger equation .    however , for @xmath57 the probability density generated by @xmath77 does not diverge , i.e. , by choosing appropriate constants it is found that @xmath78 so that together with the @xmath79 and @xmath80 counterparts in ( [ rtp ] ) , @xmath77 generates elements @xmath81 of @xmath44 , as given by the expression above .",
    "notice that although @xmath81 does not belong to the domain of @xmath41 , one formally finds @xmath82 so that @xmath81 and @xmath83 are pseudo - eigenvectors and pseudo - eigenvalues of @xmath41 , respectively .",
    "another point supporting the use of the adjective `` pseudo '' is that @xmath81 are not orthogonal to every @xmath84 ( for instance , @xmath85 is not orthogonal to @xmath84 with odd  @xmath86 ) .",
    "the question to be addressed now is about the time evolution of @xmath81 , which is well defined since @xmath87 and so @xmath88 is a weak solution of the 3d hydrogen atom schrdinger equation @xmath89 based on ( [ pseudoeigenvalue ] ) the nave expression for the solution @xmath90 is @xmath91 such solution is not correct for @xmath81 is not in the domain of @xmath41 ; if ( [ naivesolution ] ) holds then @xmath92 would be strongly differentiable and so one could conclude that @xmath93 . notice that ( [ naivesolution ] ) is correct if @xmath36 is replaced by @xmath94 .",
    "from the dynamic point of view it is important to check if @xmath81 belongs to the point subspace @xmath95 associated to @xmath41 or if it has a component in the absolutely continuous subspace @xmath96 . in the latter case ionization can take place ; in the former case these generalised eigenstates are written as superpositons of ordinary eigenstates , even if they do not belong to the domain of the operator , and so such solutions would be , in some sense , between linear combination of ordinary eigenvectors and the continuous space ( but with no ionization ) .    in order to check if @xmath81 is generated by @xmath97 , @xmath98 , @xmath99 @xmath100 , i.e. , if @xmath81 belongs to the point subspace of @xmath41 , consider @xmath101 with @xmath102 denoting the component of @xmath81 in the continuous subspace @xmath96 . notice that clearly @xmath103 if @xmath73 .",
    "it was numerically found that @xmath104 , as indicated in figure  [ figpn ] for @xmath105 ( in figure  [ figpn ] the values of @xmath106 are exact , since symbolic calculus was used ) ; the parameter @xmath107 is an approximation for @xmath108 .",
    "similar results were found for other values of  @xmath54 .",
    "therefore one concludes that @xmath81 have both nonzero point and continuous components , so that their time evolutions actually are not described by ( [ naivesolution ] ) , but give nonzero probabilities @xmath109 of ionization ( and then far from being bound states ) .",
    "as function of @xmath110.,width=226,height=226 ]",
    "the fact that all @xmath81 belong the hilbert space raises the possibility of finding physical meanings for them ; this section aims at discussing possible physical contents of these pseudo - eigenvectors .",
    "the first crucial remark is that formally @xmath81 has null azimuthal angular momentum ( @xmath57 ) .",
    "the solution @xmath85 has also null total angular momentum ( both @xmath111 ) , but there is a lack of rotational symmetry ( see  ( [ qsi ] ) ) ; this particular solution gives a clue on the physical interpretation .",
    "in fact , in comparision with ordinary eigenfunctions @xmath112 are elongated over the @xmath113-axis with a logarithmic divergence at @xmath63 and @xmath114 .",
    "figure  [ figzerozero ] shows the absolutely values of @xmath115 and @xmath116 as a function of  @xmath117 , and figure  [ function3d ] a boundary surface of the 3d wavefunction @xmath118 , which is to be compared with @xmath119 that has complete radial symmetry ( its boundary surfaces are spheres centrered at the origin ) . hence , there is a strong indication that @xmath85 are reminiscent of classical trajectories performing one - dimensional ( 1d ) like motion , in agreement with its null angular momentum and lack of rotational symmetry .",
    "so , it is natural to relate such wavefunctions to the 1d hydrogen atom , an interesting and controversial subject , popularized by the work of loudon @xcite published in 1959 .",
    "and @xmath120 ( dashed ) as function of  @xmath117.,width=226,height=226 ]    loudon stated that the 1d hydrogen atom was twofold degenerate , having even and odd eigenfunctions for each eigenvalue , except for the ( even ) ground state having infinite binding energy .",
    "typically 1d systems have no degenerate eigenvalues , and loudon justified the double degeneracy as a consequence of the singular atomic potential .",
    "andrews @xcite questioned the existence of a ground state with infinite binding energy .",
    "ten years later haines and roberts @xcite revised loudon s work and obtained that the even wave functions , with continuous eigenvalues , were complementary to odd functions , but such results were criticized by andrews @xcite , who did not accepted the continuous eigenvalues .",
    "gomes and zimerman @xcite argued that the even states with finite energy should be excluded .",
    "spector and lee @xcite presented a relativistic treatment that removed the problem of infinite binding energy of the ground state .",
    "several other works @xcite ( see also references therein ) have discussed this ( apparent ) simple problem .",
    "the 1d hydrogen atom has been used as a simplification of the 3d model in several theoretical and numerical studies @xcite .",
    "it is then interesting that cole and cohen @xcite and wong et al .",
    "@xcite have reported some experimental evidence for the 1d hydrogen atom .",
    "the `` quasi-1d '' solutions @xmath85 are natural candidates to describe such experimental observations and may be relevant for an appropriate justification for the use of 1d simplifications .",
    "lastly , the 1d eigenvalues coincide with the eigenvalues of the 3d hydrogen model .    .",
    ", width=453,height=302 ]    now the solutions @xmath121 have nonzero total angular momentum while zero angular momentum in the @xmath113-direction , and the logarithm divergence for @xmath63 and  @xmath114 is also present for all @xmath122 , indicating that the @xmath113-axis plays a special role in the classical trajectories analogy .",
    "so it is possible to interpret that @xmath121 is related to two - dimensional motions taking place in planes containing the @xmath113-axis , i.e. , to the 2d hydrogen atom .",
    "figure  [ figdoisdois ] illustrates such interpretation for @xmath123 .",
    "the 2d hydrogen atom has also been considered in the literature ( see @xcite and references therein ) , but its history is not as controversial as for the 1d case .    finally , a word about @xmath124 ; since they do not belong to the hilbert space , based on the above discussion and proceeding heuristically , it is tempting to interpret such solutions as the `` contribution '' due to the classical trajectories which come into collision with the nucleus , and the mathematical apparatus prudently avoids them explicitly ( maybe a mathematical consequence of the uncertainty principle ) .     and @xmath125 ( dashed ) as function of @xmath117.,width=226,height=226 ]",
    "one is naturally inclined to presume that higher dimensional quantum models carry somehow lower dimensional dynamics , and the study of such simpler models could mimics important aspects of the original one .",
    "of course , in general the difficulties of performing such dimensional reductions are enormous , and usually carried out by `` brute force . ''",
    "the case of the 3d hydrogen atom discussed in this work has revealed a particular and interesting framework : there are experimental evidence for the 1d hydrogen atom ; the 3d hermitian model has just one self - adjoint extension , and its 3d eigenvalue equation presents formal solutions @xmath81 that do not belong to the domain of the corresponding hamiltonian operator ; in spite of being formal eigenvectors , these solutions live in the underlying hilbert space and present a component in the continuous subspace of the hamiltonian so that , for an electron in such state , ionization can take place ; these solutions have formally zero azimuthal angular momentum , with integrable probability densities , and are concentrated around the @xmath113-axis , indicating their 1d and 2d character for @xmath85 and @xmath121 , respectively .",
    "summing up , such solutions are reminiscent of 1d and 2d classical trajectories and give a connection between the hydrogen atom in different dimensions .",
    "in addition , notice that there is an attractive relation between the dimensional interpretations advocated in this work and the mathematical formalism , which exhausts the possibilities for ( pseudo-)eigenvectors . for genuine 3d motion it presents eigenfunctions in the hamiltonian operator domain ; for 1d and 2d reminiscent trajectories it presents eigenfunctions in the hilbert space but not in the domain of the operator ; and for those colliding trajectories ( axial divergence ) the formal eigenfunctions do not belong to the hilbert space ."
