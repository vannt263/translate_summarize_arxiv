    "sgr  a * , a compact radio source , is believed to be associated with the supermassive black hole at the galactic center ( eckart , 2002 ; ghez , 2000 ) .",
    "the inferred bolometric luminosity ( l@xmath4 l@xmath5 ) is far below the eddington luminosity for the black hole mass of @xmath62.6@xmath7 m@xmath8 .",
    "sgr  a * represents an extremely dim galactic nucleus .",
    "the low luminosity of sgr a * is explained by the low efficiency radiative advection dominated accretion flow ( adaf ) model ( narayan  1998 ) .",
    "however , the adaf alone can not explain the detailed activities , such as the radio outbursts and the x - ray flares .",
    "the recent work by yuan  ( 2002a ) provides an alternative model to link a jet outflow ( falcke  1993 ) with the adaf .",
    "this new model appears to be able to fit reasonably well the overall spectrum of sgr  a * from radio , sub - millimeter , ir to the x - ray .    the apparent structure at radio wavelengths longer than 3 mm appears to be mainly dominated by the scattering effects due to the ism .",
    "at 3 mm , the scattering effects are finally small enough that the intrinsic source size is estimated to be less than 0.27 mas ( doeleman  2001 ) , or about 40 times the schwarzchild radius ( @xmath9 hereafter ) . a promising way to explore this extremely compact source is to monitor the variations of the emitted flux density from radio to x - ray .",
    "the variations in radio flux density of sgr  a * have been known for two decades ( brown & lo 1982 ) .",
    "the nature of the radio variability has not been well understood . at the long wavelengths , the flux density of sgr  a *",
    "might be modulated by the scintillation due to the turbulence in the ism ( zhao  1989 ) .",
    "the radio light curves observed with the vla at wavelengths from 20 to 1.3 cm during the period of 1990 - 1993 suggest that the fractional amplitude variations increased towards short wavelengths and that the rate of radio flares appeared to be about three per year ( zhao _ et al .",
    "_ 1992 ; and zhao & goss 1993 ) .",
    "the typical time scale of these radio flares is about a month .",
    "the observed large amplitude variations in flux densities at 3 mm ( wright & backer 1993 ; tsuboi  1999 ) are consistent with the wavelength - dependence of the variability as observed at centimeter wavelengths .    the presence of a 106 day cycle in the radio variability of sgr a@xmath10 was suggested from an analysis of data observed with the vla in the period of 1977 - 1999 ( zhao  2001 ) .",
    "the periodic oscillation at a period around 100 days appears to persist in the densely sampled light curves obtained with the vla at 2 , 1.3 and 0.7 cm over the past two years ( zhao  2002 ) .",
    "the period of the fluctuation cycle appears to increase to @xmath6 130 days ( bower  2002a ; zhao  2002 ) .",
    "in addition , a longer periodic fluctuation feature with a period 2.4 - 2.5 times the short one has also been seen ( zhao  2002 ) . similar periodic fluctuation in flux density",
    "was also observed in the gbi monitoring data ( falcke , 1999 ) .",
    "observations of sgr a * at sub - millimeter can penetrate into the deep region of this intriguing source . in this letter , we report results obtained from a monitoring program at 1 mm , with the partially finished sub - millimeter array ( hereafter sma ; moran 1998 ) .",
    "observations of sgr  a * at 1.3 mm and 0.87 mm were made using the partially completed sma with three or four antennas and baselines ranging from 7 to 55 kilo wavelengths at 1.3 mm .",
    "a total of 24 epochs of observations at 1.3 mm were carried out in reasonably good weather conditions ( the sky opacity @xmath11 0.3 at 1.3 mm ) .",
    "one observation was made at 0.87 mm on 2001 march 22 with @xmath120.5 at 0.87 mm .",
    "the observations were carried out with a total bandwidth of 328 mhz for each sideband .",
    "a typical system temperature is 200 - 300 k at 1.3 mm .",
    "a typical r.m.s . noise of @xmath6 20 mjy was achieved from an observation with four antennas for a typical on - source integration time of 2 hrs . in each epoch of observation , we interleaved sgr a * with sgr b2(n ) , a compact ( @xmath13  in size ) nearby ( @xmath14 ) hii region , and two nearby qsos , ov236 ( @xmath15 ) and nrao 530 ( @xmath16 ) . the flux density scale in each observation was determined by observing a compact planet ( neptune ( @xmath17  in diameter ) and uranus ( @xmath18 ) ) .",
    "sgr  b2(n ) ( @xmath650 jy at 1.3 mm ) was used to monitor the stability of the telescope during the observations , for example the effect due to the possible telescope pointing drift .",
    "further calibration was done by observing two qsos , ov236 and nrao 530 .",
    "we fitted the secular variations of each calibrator with polynomials .",
    "any correlated offsets in flux density from the secular variations of the two qsos are considered as systematic offsets , such as telescope pointing error .",
    "the residual gain correction determined from the offsets are applied to the sgr a * data in order to minimize the the systematic errors .",
    "the final uncertainty of @xmath19 in the flux density calibration is assessed by calculating the standard deviations of the residual offsets from the calibrators .",
    "however , the variation of a possible linear polarization as a function of parallactic angle was not corrected . a fractional linear polarization of @xmath67% from sgr",
    "a * has been detected ( bower _ et al .",
    "_ , 2002b ) .",
    "the error due to this effect is less significant and is embedded in the final uncertainty .",
    "in addition , sgr  a * is embedded in the complex , extended source sgr a west .",
    "1 shows the image of sgr a * and its vicinity observed with the sma at 1.3 mm with a beam of 7.4@xmath202.3(p.a .",
    "= 7 ) . at this wavelength and this angular resolution ,",
    "sgr a * is about 10 times brighter than the surrounding components . by examining the visibilities as a function of baseline lengths",
    ", we find that , for baselines @xmath6 20k@xmath21 or longer , sgr  a * is the dominant source and the confusing flux density at 1 mm from the surrounding free - free and dust emission is less than 0.3 jy .",
    "the flux density measurements were made in both the visibility and imaging domains . in the visibility domain , we measured the amplitude of the baselines of @xmath620 k@xmath21 and longer .",
    "the flux density was double checked by constructing images with the self - calibrated ( phase - only ) visibility data .",
    "the measurements of the point source flux density were done by deconvolving the telescope beam and taking out the contribution from surrounding components using imfit in aips .",
    "the flux densities derived from the two domains are in an agreement within 10% of the mean value .",
    "this additional 10% level of the uncertainty in the measurements is mainly due to the confusion from the surrounding emission and is added to the final error assessment .",
    "the error bars of sgr a * are derived from the quadrature addition of the uncertainty in flux density calibration and the uncertainty due to the confusion .",
    "the typical uncertainty at 1 mm is in a range of 10 to 20% .",
    "2 shows the sma light curve at 1.3 mm suggesting that sgr  a * varies significantly .",
    "a few `` flares '' were observed from sgr a * while the calibrators show secular variations with opposite drifts in flux density over the past year ( fig .",
    "three `` flares '' were observed over a 1-year period .",
    "both the 2001-march and 2002-february flares ( flare 1 and flare 3 as marked in fig .",
    "2b ) were partially observed in their decreasing phase .",
    "the 2001-july flare ( flare 2 ) was observed covering an entire cycle from its inception to a slow decrease back to its steady state value .",
    "flare 1 , which started from 4.1@xmath220.5 jy after an unobserved peak and decreased to 1.1 @xmath22 0.15 jy within less than three months , appeared to be relatively stronger than others .",
    "the rising time for flare 2 was about 2 - 3 weeks , reaching a peak of @xmath23 jy on 2001 july 10 .",
    "then , a slow decrease lasted about 40 - 50d .",
    "we were not able to observe sgr  a * for the next three months due to the proximity to the sun .",
    "the monitoring program was resumed in 2002 february .",
    "a tail of a possible flare ( flare 3 ) was observed in early 2002 .",
    "based on the sparse data , marginal day - to - day variations at a level of 2 - 3@xmath1 ( or 20 - 30% ) were observed during flare 1 and flare 2 as well as in later may 2002 .",
    "intra - day variations on short time scales were searched based on the 24 epochs of observations at 1.3 mm .",
    "we averaged the data in a 5min bin and checked the visibility plots for each baseline .",
    "we also averaged all baseline together and checked intra - day light curves .",
    "no evidence for significant variations on a time scale of @xmath61 hr has been found , _",
    "i.e. _ a variability quantity @xmath24   \\over \\left[s_{max}+s_{min } \\right ] } < 20\\%}$ ] , where @xmath25 and @xmath26 are the maximum and minimum flux densities at 1.3 mm , respectively , in a single observing track of 6 hrs or less .",
    "we also searched for periodic signals in a period ranging between 10 min to 2.5 hrs based on the observations of 5.5 hr on may 29 , 2002 .",
    "there is a possible oscillation signal with a frequency of 1.1@xmath27 hz ( or 2.5 hr in period ) on an e - w baseline .",
    "this oscillation signal can be well modeled as a structure due to interference between sgr a * and surrounding components . combining all baselines ,",
    "a @xmath28 non - detection limit of a periodic signal from sgra * at a level of@xmath65% can be inferred .",
    "we also observed sgr  a * at 0.87 mm with the sma on 2001 march 22 .",
    "we observed sgr  a * ( s@xmath29 jy ) at the sub - millimeter band using the three - element array of the partially completed sma .",
    "3a shows a spectrum derived from the mean flux density determined from the multiple observations within two weeks of the peak of flare 1 .",
    "the error bars were derived from the quadrature addition of the standard deviation and the maximum error in individual measurements .",
    "the spectral index @xmath30 ( s@xmath31 ) appears to be 0.1@xmath220.1 at 100 ghz and below , and 1.5@xmath32 between 232 and 345 ghz , suggesting a break frequency in spectral index of @xmath6100 ghz or higher .",
    "a flux density excess towards sub - millimeter wavelengths has been observed ( zylka , mezger , & lesch 1992 ; serabyn  1997 ; falcke  1998 ) .",
    "the overall spectrum can fit two power - law components , _",
    "i.e. _ s@xmath33 = s@xmath34 + s@xmath35 .",
    "three sets of combination of @xmath36 and @xmath37 are used in the fitting .",
    "first , for @xmath38 and @xmath39 ( dashed lines in fig .",
    "3 ) , the sub - millimeter component corresponds to the thermal synchrotron emission either arising from the inner region of the accretion disk ( _ e.g. _ liu & melia 2002 ) or produced from a jet - nozzle ( falcke & markoff 2000 ) .",
    "second , for @xmath40 and @xmath41 ( solid lines in fig .",
    "3 ) , the spectral index of 2.5 suggests that a homogeneous opaque , non - thermal synchrotron source might be present in the inner region of the accretion flow .",
    "such a model appears to be plausible if one considers the non - thermal synchrotron particles to be accelerated inside the compact source , perhaps within a jet nozzle as has been proposed for the case of ngc 4258 ( yuan _ et .",
    "2002b ) . finally , if the low frequency component has an exponential cut - off , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath42 , at @xmath43 ghz , a smaller value of @xmath44 ( dash - dotted lines in fig .",
    "3 ) for the sub - millimeter component is also consistent with a spectrum produced from the adaf in which a gradient of @xmath45 depresses the rising part of the spectrum ( narayan _ et .",
    "al . _ , 1998 ) .",
    "the observed spectrum suggests an opaque nature of the sub - millimeter component at 1.3 and perhaps 0.87 mm .",
    "observations at the shorter sub - millimeter wavelengths appear to be critical to differentiate between the models .",
    "the spectrum in a minimum state is also shown ( fig .",
    "the excess at 1.3 mm appears to be less significant .",
    "the sma data at 1 mm appears to show a correlation with the light curves observed with the vla .",
    "the sma light curve shows three `` flares '' from sgr  a * in the past year from 2001 march to 2002 may .",
    "the variation in flux density that we observed in the sma light curve suggests that flares are constantly occurring in this source .",
    "a quantitative analysis of cross - correlation properties between the light curves at 1.3 mm and 1.3 cm has been carried out . due to the sparse data sampling",
    ", large uncertainty remains in the cross - correlation analysis for individual flares ( zhao 2002 ) .",
    "however , a global delay between the 1.3 mm and 1.3 cm light curves can be searched for using the z - transformed discrete correlation function ( zdcf ) without interpolating in the temporal domain ( alexander 1997 ) . with no prior models assumed ,",
    "the zdcf is a reliable and efficient method to search for a delay .",
    "4 shows the zdcf between the sma and vla light curves at 1.3 mm and 1.3 cm .",
    "the peak in the correlation function corresponds to a delay of 4@xmath46 d. a noticeable asymmetric shape of the zdcf near the zero lag shows a significant excess in cross - correlated power towards the positive lags , suggesting that the true global delay is @xmath47 .",
    "the zdcf indicates that flares at 1.3 mm starts first .",
    "in addition , the strong x - ray flare with a time scale of @xmath61 hr , observed by baganoff  ( 2001 ) , occurred about 10 days earlier than a radio peak observed in all three vla monitoring bands . during flare 2 ( 2001 july ) , chandra observed sgr  a * on 2001 july 14 , a few days past the 1 mm peak but no x - ray flares were observed .",
    "the x - ray flux level was consistent with that of a quiescent state ( baganoff 2001 , private communication ) .",
    "the sma observations have shown that sgr  a * varies significantly at 1 mm during the course of sma monitoring in 2001 march to 2002 may .",
    "the derived lags from a cross - correlation analysis appear to be good evidence that the flaring occurs from the inside out starting from short wavelengths and then continuing to longer wavelengths . in the jet - adaf model connecting a jet outflow with the adaf ( yuan  2002a ) , the sub - millimeter excess is thought to arise from a sum of the emission from both the adaf and the jet nozzle .    on the other hand , from the observations with the sma and the vla , further constraints on the models",
    "can be derived .",
    "taking a global delay time of @xmath48 and the source size of 40 r@xmath49 , an expansion velocity , v@xmath501200 km s@xmath51 or @xmath52 0.004 c , is inferred .",
    "the expansion velocity appears to be far below the escape velocity of 0.1 c at r @xmath6 40 r@xmath49 .",
    "the bulk kinetic energy associated with the flares appeared to be too small to power a noticeable collimated jet in sgr  a*. in addition , the break in the spectral index at @xmath63 mm also indicates that a large fraction of the flaring plasma might well be confined within the characteristic radius at 3 mm .",
    "however , the possible outflow tries to expand to a larger scale .",
    "the data presented here does not exclude the possibility of a strong flare which can lead to an observable jet - like structure .",
    "the inferred small expansion velocity may imply that other processes contribute to the transport of high energy particles , _ e.g. _ diffusion and convection may also play a role in powering sgr a * at lower radio frequencies .",
    "the time scale ( weeks ) of 1 mm flares differs from the time scale ( 1 hr ) of the x - ray flare ( baganoff , 2001 ) .",
    "the lack of strong flares on a short time scale at 1 mm places a critical constraint on the models of the inverse compton scattering as has been proposed for the short duration x - ray flares ( falcke & markoff 2000 ; markoff _ et .",
    "al . _ , 2001 ; liu & melia , 2002 ) . considering the opaque nature of the sub - millimeter component at 1.3 mm",
    ", the x - ray flares could hide at 1.3 mm due to a self - absorption .",
    "alternatively , the flares at sub - millimeter wavelengths might be a result of collective mass ejections associated with the x - ray flares that originate from the inner region of the accretion flows near the event horizon of the supermassive black hole at the galactic center .",
    "we would like to thank the sma staff from both the sao and the asiaa for supporting this monitoring program .",
    "we are grateful to jim moran and heino falcke ( the referee ) for their valuable comments .",
    "jhz thanks irwin shapiro for his initial suggestion of the sma monitoring program .",
