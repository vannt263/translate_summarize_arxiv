    "the great variety of critical behaviour is reduced by dividing all systems into a small number of universality classes .",
    "these classes are characterized by global properties like dimensionality and the number of components of the order parameter and have the same set of critical exponents and scaling functions , which are independent of microscopic details @xcite . here the 3d ising universality class is considered by studying the binder cumulant @xcite of the next - nearest neighbour ising model ( nnn model ) .",
    "if all universal quantities of one class are known , the asymptotic critical behaviour is believed to be also known completely under the condition , that only two nonuniversal amplitudes @xmath0 and @xmath1 are given .",
    "this particular feature is called two - scale factor universality .",
    "the free - energy - density @xmath2 , from which we can derive thermodynamical quantities and which is measured in units of @xmath3 , can be expressed by @xcite : @xmath4 where @xmath5 and @xmath6 is the ordering field .",
    "the singular part @xmath7 is the part which yields thermodynamical singularities in the @xmath8 limit .",
    "@xmath9 denotes the non - singular part of @xmath2 , which can be chosen without field dependence . for the singular part @xmath7 we can write for the ising model @xmath10 @xmath11",
    "is called the scaling function and is universal using system - dependent factors @xmath1 and @xmath0 .",
    "+ chen and dohm @xcite recently predicted some deviations from this universality , from a @xmath12 theory .",
    "+ in the following section we study the universal value of the binder cumulant for the nnn model for different next - nearest neighbour interaction @xmath13 by simulations . according to privman , hohenberg and aharony @xcite , the binder cumulant scales according to @xmath14 where @xmath15_{y=0}$ ] . for @xmath16 ( means @xmath17 ) ,",
    "@xmath18 approaches with growing @xmath19 a universal constant @xmath20 , @xmath21 which we are going to simulate , shows only small deviations from the universal value @xmath20 @xcite .",
    "consequently , it is possible to give a realistic approximation of the final value @xmath20 simulating finite lattices .",
    "to show the variation of @xmath22 within the 3d ising universality class , we choose the next - nearest neighbour model ( nnn model ) without external field and a simple cubic lattice .",
    "each lattice site has 6 next neighbours in the distance @xmath23 and 12 next - nearest neighbours in the distance @xmath24 , if @xmath23 is defined as the lattice constant .",
    "the exchange force @xmath13 of the next - nearest neighbours can now be chosen to be different from the exchange force @xmath25 of the 6 nearest neighbours as we also would also intuitively expect , because their distance to the considered site is also not identical .",
    "a ferromagnetic phase transition is also existent for an antiferromagnetic exchange force @xmath13 .",
    "this kind of exchange , ferromagnetic for nearest neighbours and antiferromagnetic for next - nearest neighbours , will be treated for our universality test of @xmath22 .",
    "furthermore we studied the universality of @xmath26 in the zero field nnn ising model with an isotropic nearest - neighbour ( nn ) coupling @xmath27 and an anisotropic next - nearest neighbour ( annn ) coupling @xmath28 .",
    "we refer to the considered model of chen and dohm in their publication  nonuniversal finite - size scaling in anistropic systems  [ 4 ] .",
    "the anisotropic nnn ising model is established by considering only 6 of the 12 next - nearest neighbours being effective for nnn interaction @xmath28 and the other 6 nnn having no nnn interaction .",
    "the effective next - nearest neighbours have the positions @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 of a simple cubic lattice .",
    "simulating the nnn model @xmath13 can be varied , while it is chosen @xmath32 . for values of @xmath13",
    "higher than a critical value @xmath33 we observe ferromagnetic phase transitions , while below @xmath34 no ferromagnetic phase transition occurs . at @xmath35",
    "we obtain the standard 3-dimensional ( 3d ) ising ferromagnet . here the region @xmath36 and thus a small antiferromagnetic interaction @xmath13 is considered .",
    "+ simulating now the `` fixed point value '' at the critical point of the binder cumulant @xmath37 , we evaluate @xmath38 to check its universality within the 3d ising universality class . for an ising model in zero field",
    ", the binder cumulant simplifies to @xmath39 where @xmath40 symbols the magnetization per spin . for the determination of each @xmath22",
    "was plotted @xmath41 as a function of temperature @xmath42 for three different lattice lengths @xmath19 ( @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 ) . to get more precise results ,",
    "several curves of @xmath46 for different lattice sizes with different seeds were averaged . in figure 1",
    "is shown this method for two different @xmath13 .",
    "the errors were calculated by averaging the values of the three different crossing points of @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 .",
    "[ sdf1 ]      in figure [ ende ] and table 1 we can see all simulated results as a function @xmath38 and these results in comparison with theoretical results of chen and dohm @xcite plotted as a function @xmath50 with @xmath51 .",

    "monte carlo simulations of the universal quantity of the binder cumulant and the universal susceptibility ratio with different next - nearest neighbour interactions @xmath13 showed a variation of both quantities for all applied models .",
    "the variation of these universal quantities leads to the conclusion , that in the considered region the nnn ising model does not belong fully to the 3d ising universality class . + we assume that for regions , where chosen values of @xmath25 and @xmath13 still cause ferromagnetic phase transitions , but are close to a region where we will find no more ferromagnetic behaviour , a new definition for universality classes for this model has to be found .",
