    "monopoles have been studied within the context of both abelian @xcite and non - abelian @xcite gauge theories .",
    "usually , the approach is to start with a classical monopole configuration ( _ i.e. _ having a magnetic field which becomes coulombic as @xmath1 ) and then consider the quantum corrections to the system .",
    "one difficulty with this approach is that the coupling strength of monopole configurations is large due to the dirac quantization condition @xcite which requires that there be an inverse relationship between electric and magnetic couplings .",
    "a perturbatively small electric coupling requires a non - perturbatively large magnetic coupling .",
    "the perturbative quantization techniques do not work well with monopoles for the same reason that they have trouble with qcd in the low energy regime : the couplings are non - perturbatively large .    here",
    "we will use a modification of a non - perturbative quantization method originally used by heisenberg to quantize nonlinear , strongly coupled spinor fields @xcite @xcite .",
    "however , rather than applying this quantization to an su(3 ) field configuration which is monopole - like already at the classical level , we apply it to a non - monopole configuration , which has fields and an energy density which diverge at spacial infinity ( @xmath2 ) . after applying heisenberg s quantization technique to this solution",
    "we find that the fields and energy density become physically well behaved , and the asymptotic magnetic field becomes monopole - like .",
    "this result may indicate that monopoles are inherently quantum objects . rather than quantizing a classical field theory configuration which appears monopole - like ,",
    "real monopoles might arise as a consequence of quantizing non - monopole classical solutions .",
    "in this section we will briefly review the classical , spherically symmetric , su(3 ) yang - mills theory solution @xcite to which we will apply the modified heisenberg quantization method .",
    "we begin with the following ansatz for pure su(3 ) yang - mills theory @xmath3 here @xmath4 are the gell - mann matrices ; @xmath5 is a color index ; the latin indices @xmath6 are space indices ; @xmath7 ; @xmath8 are the usual spherically coordinates .",
    "this is a simplified version of an ansatz considered by several groups @xcite  @xcite .    under this ansatz",
    "the yang - mills equations ( @xmath9 ) become @xmath10 where the primes indicate differentiation with respect to @xmath11 . in the asymptotic limit @xmath2 the solutions to eqs .",

    ", were studied numerically @xcite it was found that the approximate form of the solution in eqs . -",
    "was a good representation even for @xmath16 fairly close to the origin .",
    "it was also found that for a broad range of boundary conditions for the functions @xmath17 that @xmath18 tend to fall in the range @xmath19 .",
    "thus for large @xmath16 the ansatz function @xmath20 is a smoothly , increasing function , which yields an increasing time - like gauge potential from eq . .",
    "this can be compared with the confining potentials used in some phenomenological studies of quarkonia bound states @xcite .",
    "it is also possible to find analytic solutions with such increasing gauge potentials if one couples the yang - mills fields to a scalar field @xcite .",
    "however , this increasing of @xmath20 also leads to the field energy and action of this solution diverging as @xmath21 .",
    "the `` magnetic '' ( @xmath22 ) and `` electric '' ( @xmath23 ) fields associated with this solution can be found from the non - abelian gauge potentials , @xmath24 , and have the following behavior @xmath25 here for @xmath26 , and @xmath27 the color index @xmath28 and for @xmath29 and @xmath30 @xmath31 .",
    "although the confining behavior of the above classical solution is of interest due to its similarity with certain phenomenological potentials , its infinite field energy makes its physical importance / meaning uncertain .",
    "one possible resolution to this classical solution s divergent field energy is if quantum effects removed its bad long distance behavior .",
    "the difficulty is that strongly interacting , nonlinear theories are notoriously hard to quantize . in order to take into account the quantum effects on this solution",
    "we will employ a variation of the method used by heisenberg @xcite in attempts to quantize the nonlinear dirac equation .",
    "we will outline the key points of the method by using the nonlinear dirac equation as an illustrative example .",
    "the nonlinear spinor field equation considered by heisenberg had the following form : @xmath32 = 0\\ ] ] where @xmath33 are dirac matrices ; @xmath34 are the spinor field and its adjoint respectively ; @xmath35 $ ] is the general nonlinear spinor self interaction term which involved three spinor fields and various combinations of @xmath36 s and/or @xmath37 s .",
    "the constant @xmath38 has units of length , and sets the scale for the strength of the interaction .",
    "next one defines @xmath39 functions as @xmath40 | \\phi \\rangle\\ ] ] where @xmath41 is the time ordering operator ; @xmath42 is a state for the system described by eq . .",

    "y_n ) + ... \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] eq . represents one of an infinite set of coupled equations which relate various order ( given by the index @xmath45 ) of the @xmath39 functions to one another . to make some head way toward solving this infinite set of equations",
    "heisenberg employed the tamm - dankoff method whereby he only considered @xmath39 functions up to a certain order .",
    "this effectively turned the infinite set of coupled equations into a finite set of coupled equations .",
    "for the su(3 ) yang - mills theory this idea leads to the following yang - mills equations for the quantized su(3 ) gauge field @xmath46 here @xmath47 is the field operator of the su(3 ) gauge field .    one can show that heisenberg s method is equivalent to the dyson - schwinger system of equations for small coupling constants .",
    "one can also make a comparison between the heisenberg method and the standard feynman diagram technique . with the feynman diagram method quantum corrections to physical quantities",
    "are given in terms of an infinite number of higher order , loop diagrams .",
    "in practice one takes only a finite number of diagrams into account when calculating the quantum correction to some physical quantity .",
    "this standard diagrammatic method requires a small expansion parameter ( the coupling constant ) , and thus does not work for strongly coupled theories .",
    "the heisenberg method was intended for strongly coupled , nonlinear theories , and we will apply a variation of this method to the classical solution discussed in the last section .    we will consider a variation of heisenberg s quantization method for the present non - abelian equations by making the following assumptions",
    "@xcite :    1 .",
    "the physical degrees of freedom relevant for studying the above classical solution are given entirely by the two ansatz functions @xmath17 appearing in eqs .",
    "no other degrees of freedom will arise through the quantization process .",
    "2 .   from eqs .",
    ", we see that one function @xmath48 is a smoothly varying function for large @xmath11 , while another function , @xmath49 , is strongly oscillating .",
    "thus we take @xmath48 to be an almost classical degree of freedom while @xmath49 is treated as a fully quantum mechanical degree of freedom .",
    "naively one might expect that only the behavior of second function would change while first function stayed the same .",
    "however since both functions are interrelated through the nonlinear nature of the field equations we find that both functions are modified .    to begin we replace the ansatz functions by operators @xmath50 .",
    "@xmath51 these equations can be seen as an approximation of the quantized su(3 ) yang - mills field equations . taking into account assumption ( 2 ) we let @xmath52",
    "become just a classical function again , and replace @xmath53 in eq . by its expectation value to arrive at @xmath54 where",
    "the expectation value @xmath55 is taken with respect to some quantum state @xmath56 : @xmath57 .",
    "we can average eq . to get @xmath58 eqs .",
    "are almost a closed system for determining @xmath59 except for the @xmath60 and @xmath61 terms .",
    "one can obtain differential equations for these expectation values by applying @xmath62 to @xmath53 or @xmath63 and using eqs . - .",
    "however the differential equations for @xmath60 or @xmath61 would involve yet higher powers of @xmath64 thus generating an infinite number of coupled differential equations for the various @xmath65 . in the next section",
    "we will use a path integral _ inspired _ method @xcite to cut this progression off at some finite number of differential equations .",
    "within the path integral method the expectation value of some field @xmath66 is given by @xmath67 } d \\phi\\ ] ] the classical solutions , @xmath68 , give the dominate contribution to the path integral .",
    "for a single classical solution one can approximate the path integral as @xmath69 } d\\phi \\approx a e^{is[\\phi_{cl } ] }    \\label{av-2a}\\ ] ] where @xmath15 is a normalization constant .",
    "consequently the expectation of the field can be approximated by @xmath70 } d\\phi \\approx \\phi_{cl } .",

    "the classical solution with the asymptotic form has an infinite energy and action .",
    "when one considers the euclidean version of the path integral above the exponential factor in becomes @xmath75 $ ] which for an infinite action would naively imply that this classical configuration would not contribute to the path integral at all .",
    "however , there examples where infinite action classical solutions have been hypothesized to play a significant role in the path integral .",
    "the most well known example of this is the meron solution @xcite , which has an infinite action .",
    "analytically the singularities of the meron solutions can be dealt with by replacing the regions that contain the singularities by instanton solutions .",
    "since instanton solutions have finite action this patched together solution of meron plus instanton has finite action .",
    "however , the yang - mills field equations are not satisfied at the boundary where the meron and instanton solutions are sewn together .",
    "in addition recent lattice studies @xcite @xcite have indicated that merons ( or the patched meron / instanton ) do play a role in the path integral . here",
    "we will treat this divergence in the action in an approximate way through a redefinition of the path integral integration measure .",
    "since the divergence in the action comes from first term of the @xmath48 ansatz function of , which does not contain @xmath74 we will take the action for different @xmath76 s to be approximately the same : @xmath77 \\approx s_0 \\rightarrow \\infty$ ] .",
    "then changing the functional integration measure in the following way  @xmath78  allows us to approximate the expectation value of @xmath79 as @xmath80 where @xmath81 is the probability for a given classical solution .",
    "we will consider the classical solutions whose asymptotic behavior is given by - , and we will take the different solutions ( as distinguished by different @xmath74 s ) to have equal probability @xmath82 .",
    "therefore @xmath83 here @xmath84 is the function from the eq .. the path integral _ inspired _ eqns .",
    "- are the heart of the cutoff procedure that we wish to apply to eqns . , . on substituting eqs . ,",
    "into eqs . , we find that eq . is satisfied identically and eq . takes the form @xmath85 which has the solutions @xmath86 where @xmath87 is some constant .",
    "the first solution is simply the classically averaged singular solution which still has the bad asymptotic divergence of the fields and energy density .",
    "the second solution , , is more physically relevant since it leads to asymptotic fields which are well behaved .",
    "the solution of eq . implies the following important result : * _ the quantum fluctuations of the strongly oscillating , nonlinear fields leads to an improvement of the bad asymptotic behavior of these nonlinear fields . _",
    "* this means that after quantization the monotonically growing and strongly oscillating components of the gauge potential become functions with good asymptotic behavior .    as @xmath2",
    "we find the following su(3 ) color fields @xmath88 we can see that as @xmath2 @xmath89 . in particular at infinity we find only a monopole `` magnetic '' field @xmath90 with a `` magnetic '' charge @xmath91 .",
    "this result can be summarized as : * _ the approximate quantization of the su(3 ) gauge field ( by averaging over the classical singular solutions ) gives a monopole - like configuration from an initial classical configuration which was not monopole - like .",
    "_ * we will call this a * _ `` quantum monopole '' _ * to distinguish it from field configurations which are monopole - like already in the classical theory .",
    "the divergence of the fields of the classical solution given by eqs . - leads to a diverging energy density for the solution , and thus an infinite total field energy .",
    "the energy density @xmath92 of the quantized solution is @xmath93 the first two terms on the right hand side of eq . , which involve the `` classical '' ansatz function @xmath94 ,",
    "go to zero faster than @xmath95 as @xmath2 due to the form of @xmath94 in eq . .",
    "thus the leading behavior of @xmath92 is given by the last two terms in eq .",
    "which have only the `` quantum '' ansatz function @xmath96 . to calculate @xmath97",
    "let us consider @xmath98 in the limit @xmath99 we have @xmath100 from eqs .",
    "and we see that @xmath101 which implies @xmath102 thus the third term in gives the leading asymptotic behavior as @xmath2 to be @xmath103 and the total energy of this `` quantum monopole '' ( excitation ) is infinite .",
    "this fact indicates that our approximation is good only for @xmath104 calculations but not for the derivative @xmath105 . .",
    "starting from an infinite energy , classical solution to the su(3 ) yang - mills field equations we found that the bad asymptotic behavior of this solution was favorably modified by a variation of the quantization method proposed by heisenberg to deal with strongly coupled , nonlinear field theories .",
    "in addition , although the original classical solution was not monopole - like , it was found that the quantized solution was monopole - like .",
    "this may imply that if real monopoles exist they may be inherently quantum mechanical objects _",
    "i.e. _ that monopoles arise from the quantization of non - monopole classical solutions .",
    "this is to be contrasted with the standard idea that monopoles result from quantizing solutions which are already monopole - like at the classical level .",
    "one possible application of this is to the dual - superconductor picture of the qcd vacuum . in this picture one",
    "models the qcd vacuum as a stochastic gas of appearing / disappearing monopoles and antimonopoles as in fig.[fig1 ] .",
    "these monopole / antimonopole fluctuations can form pairs ( analogous to cooper pairs in real superconductors ) which can bose condense leading to a dual meissner effect @xcite @xcite expelling color electric flux from the qcd vacuum , expect in narrow flux tubes which connect and confine the quarks .",
    "lattice calculations confirm such a model @xcite : monopoles appear to play a major role in the qcd lattice gauge path integral .",
    "based on the results of the present paper it may be that the monopoles which are considered in the dual superconductor qcd vacuum picture should be the `` quantum '' monopoles discussed here rather than `` classical '' monopoles ( _ i.e. _ monopoles which are already monopole - like at the classical level ) .",
