    "the non - monotonic @xmath0 below about 10  k is very likely caused by the occurrence of magnetic order and the opening of a gap in the magnetic excitation spectrum . upon approaching the magnetic / non - magnetic phase boundary at a critical pressure @xmath8  gpa",

    "this interpretation is supported by the evolution of a high - temperature maximum in @xmath0 as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : tepall ] .",

    "the features in @xmath0 below about 10  k and @xmath27  gpa reflect presumably the appearance of long - range magnetic order @xcite . at 5.7  gpa , however ,",

    ", the main observation is that the long - range magnetic order is suppressed at a critical pressure @xmath30  gpa and that a hf like behaviour equivalent to that in ceru@xmath2si@xmath2 at ambient pressure sets in for @xmath31 .",
    "the almost identical @xmath0 curves of ceru@xmath2si@xmath2 at ambient pressure and ceru@xmath2ge@xmath2 at high pressure strongly suggest that the unit - cell volume is the crucial parameter as far as the size of the kondo exchange interaction is concerned , and suggests that the position of the peak in @xmath0 at low temperature is a measure for the kondo temperature @xmath9 @xcite .",

    "the 4f@xmath45 configuration is excluded , i.e. , an infinite strong repulsion between 4f - electrons is assumed .",
    "taking the impurity concentration equal to one , and imposing that the average number of conduction electrons and 4f - electrons is conserved ( self - consistency condition ) @xcite , the hamiltonian for the effective single - ion anderson model is given by    @xmath46    where @xmath47 describes the conduction states , @xmath48 represents cef states at @xmath49 and @xmath50 , and @xmath51 gives the transfer of electrons between 4f and conduction states .",

    "the model represents the 4f@xmath41 configuration of the ce ion at ambient pressure and high temperature .",
    "an increase of pressure stabilises the 4f@xmath40 configuration of the ce - ion and enhances the configurational mixing .",

    "thus , for a given ce - compound , @xmath59 and @xmath60 remain constant at all temperatures and pressures @xcite .    in order to describe the influence of pressure on @xmath0 and @xmath1 of ceru@xmath61ge@xmath2 , which is paramagnetic at high temperature and ambient pressure , it is sufficient to consider the case @xmath62 .",
    "the behaviour of the anderson model in that limit is controlled by several well defined fixed points @xcite . in the case of @xmath63",
    ", the impurity appears to be magnetic and the low - temperature behaviour is characterised by the fl fixed point , which describes a singlet formed by the 4f - moment and the conduction electrons .",
    "an increase of temperature gives rise to a transition to the local moment ( lm ) fixed point , which characterises a cef split 4f - state weakly coupled to the conduction band .",

    "the definition of @xmath10 in the nca is given in the next section .",
    "the remarkable feature of the anderson model is that the physics at the fl and the lm fixed points is governed by the same characteristic energy scale @xmath10 .",
    "a further transition to a fixed point related to the scattering of conduction electrons on an effective six - fold degenerate 4f - multiplet occurs at temperatures above @xmath53 . in the case of @xmath65 ,",

    "the fl and the lm regimes are too close for the sign - change to occur , and the crossover is indicated by a shallow minimum between two asymmetric peaks or just a shoulder in @xmath0 . for larger @xmath3-values , the crossover is from the fl to a mv regime but the fl scale is large , @xmath158 , and @xmath0 grows monotonically towards the high - temperature maximum .",

    "a qualitative understanding of the pressure - induced changes in the electrical resistivity @xmath166 and thermopower @xmath0 of ceru@xmath2ge@xmath2 was developed in the framework of the single - site anderson model .",
    "the evolution of @xmath166 and @xmath0 with pressure was accounted for by the increase of the 4f - conduction band electron hybridisation @xmath3 .",
    "the calculated spectral functions @xmath90 show that the temperature - induced redistribution of spectral weight yields several of the pronounced features observed in the measured transport quantities .",
