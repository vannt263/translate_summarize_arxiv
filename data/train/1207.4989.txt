    "most laser slowing methods rely on the radiative force in a monochromatic field @xcite .",
    "the momentum transfer @xmath2 arising from photon absorption allows atoms to be accelerated or decelerated , and their velocity distribution to be narrowed ( cooled ) .",
    "however , the radiative force is limited in its magnitude by the spontaneous emission rate @xmath3 , to a maximum of @xmath4 .",
    "long slowing times allow the small transverse velocity spread in an atomic beam to significantly reduce the source brightness , negatively impacting the loading of the slowed atoms into a magneto - optical trap ( mot ) .",
    "unlike the radiative force , the dipole force arising from intensity gradients in a monochromatic standing wave is not limited by the radiative decay rate . however , it alternates sign on the scale of an optical standing wave .",
    "the average force is zero , limiting its usefulness in a decelerator , although a pulsed slower can be created by utilizing a transient standing - wave lattice produced by an intense pulsed laser @xcite .",
    "another way around this limitation , demonstrated by kazantsev and krasnov  @xcite , is to rectify the dipole force . adding a second frequency to the standing wave results in a modulated light shift , which can be adjusted to keep the sign of the dipole force positive .",
    "this technique eventually resulted in the deflection of sodium atoms by a few m / s by grimm and coworkers  @xcite .    continued refinement of slowing techniques in bichromatic fields by grimm and coworkers eventually led to the observation of a much larger rectified dipole force in cesium , with a velocity range of 225  m / s  @xcite .",
    "this was the birth of the optical bichromatic force ( bcf ) , which relies on a pair of counterpropagating two - color beams that , when the intensity and standing wavelength are carefully selected , will coherently drive the atom through cycles of photon absorption and stimulated emission much more rapidly than the radiative decay rate .",
    "these developments led to more extensive research on the bichromatic force , which to date has been demonstrated in cs  @xcite , na  @xcite , na@xmath5  @xcite , rb  @xcite , and metastable helium ( he * )  @xcite . despite this progress and the obvious advantages of a strong continuous optical force",
    ", there appears to be only one instance in which the bcf has been used with a mot , a recent experiment in which improved efficiency was demonstrated for atomic beam loading of an @xmath6rb mot @xcite .",
    "we have designed two experiments to test the potential limits of the bcf and evaluate the feasibility of an atomic beam slower for he*. the first set of experiments tests the sensitivity and limitations of the bcf at large detunings .",
    "this is required for a static atomic slower design , which would utilize one or two pairs of bichromatic beams configured such that the bcf profile has a wide velocity range , capable of decelerating he * atoms by several hundred m / s .",
    "the second set of experiments explores an alternative bcf slower scheme that avoids many of the difficulties of using large bichromatic detunings . here",
    "bcf beams with a relatively small detunings are used , with the addition of dynamic frequency chirping to maintain resonance with the changing doppler shifts of the decelerating atoms . this design conserves laser power at the cost of added complexity in the control electronics .",
    "more importantly , it keeps the bcf parameters in a range within which they are robust against small misadjustments .",
    "we demonstrate deceleration by 370 m / s in a prototype design , constrained mainly by the low - power diode lasers used for initial tests .",

    "the frequency pairs at @xmath8 give rise to a series of rf beat notes , each with an area of approximately @xmath7 . ]    an intuitive but somewhat inaccurate model for the bcf @xcite is based on the concept of periodic momentum exchange between the atom and the co- and counterpropagating bichromatic beams using @xmath7-pulses . as shown in fig .",
    "1 , each pair of two - color beams is offset by the atomic doppler shift @xmath12 so that in the frame of the moving atom , the frequencies are offset from the atomic resonance @xmath13 by @xmath8 .",
    "thus the atom experiences from each direction a traveling sequence of beat notes , each with duration @xmath14 . in the @xmath7-pulse model ,",
    "the two sets of beat notes are treated as if they are independent non - overlapping pulse trains . in this approximation ,",
    "if the laser power is chosen so that the beat note area satisfies the @xmath7-pulse condition for an atomic transition , the atom will experience a sequence of alternating excitations and stimulated de - excitations .",
    "this occurs when @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the on - resonance rabi frequency of each bichromatic frequency component @xcite .",
    "a large decelerating force to the left occurs if the excitations come from the right - hand beam and the de - excitations from the left .",
    "if @xmath17 , this force will greatly exceed the radiative force @xmath18 .",
    "this force is quite tolerant of deviations from the exact @xmath7-pulse condition so long as the left - hand beat notes closely match the right - hand ones . in the pulse - pair model ,",
    "the two pulses will then appear to the atom as time - reversed images of one another .",
    "the second pulse in each pair reverses the curve on the bloch sphere traced out by the first @xcite , leaving the atom back in the ground state after each two - pulse cycle .",
    "this simple time - domain picture is very useful for estimating the breakdown of the bcf at large detunings or large atomic velocities , a subject that we discuss further in section [ sec : dephasing ] .",
    "the @xmath7-pulse model also leads to a simple and intuitive estimate for the velocity range of the bcf , which appears to have been overlooked in the previous literature . to a first approximation",
    ", finite atomic velocities merely induce doppler shifts @xmath19 and @xmath20 for the two pulses in each pair , and since the pulses still appear as time - reversed images there is little effect . however , the generalized rabi frequency is also modified @xcite , because the doppler shifts detune the center or",
    " carrier \" frequency of each beat note from the atomic resonance : @xmath21 if the doppler shift @xmath12 is comparable to the resonance rabi frequency @xmath22 , the rabi cycling even for a single pulse is so badly out of phase that the bcf will be disrupted . in the simplified limit of a rectangular pulse with @xmath23 ,",
    "the resulting full width of the velocity range is @xmath24 in agreement with much more sophisticated models apart from the factor of 2 .",
    "the relative phase between the co- and counterpropagating beat notes is critical to the optimization of the bcf , as can easily be seen by considering a single pair of @xmath7-pulses separated by time @xmath25 , the first arriving from the right and the second from the left .",
    "if the atom is excited by the first pulse but undergoes spontaneous decay before the second pulse arrives , it will start cycling in the wrong sequence , leading to acceleration .",
    "this can be minimized by making @xmath25 as short as possible while maintaining the discreteness of the pulses .",
    "further , if the repetition period @xmath26 , an atom that is already cycling in the wrong sequence will be more likely to radiate to the ground state after the two - pulse sequence than in between the pulses , placing it back into the correct sequence for deceleration by future pulse pairs . for short rectangular pulses the optimal configuration would be with minimal delay @xmath25 , but for beat note trains ,",
    "the best one can do is to set the relative phase to @xmath27 , where @xmath28 corresponds to the limiting case of simultaneous arrival , where the pulses fully overlap and there is no net force , and @xmath29 is the equally ineffective symmetric case where @xmath30 . averaging over several radiative lifetimes with @xmath27 , the correct ( decelerating ) sequence occurs during 3/4 of the interaction time , while the atom is accelerated during the remaining time . numerical calculations and experiments support this argument , which reduces the average force by a factor of two compared with perfect in - phase cycling . because the individual @xmath7-pulses exchange momentum increments of @xmath2 at rate @xmath31 , the average bichromatic force is @xmath32 this average force exceeds the radiative force by a factor of @xmath33 .      a more complete model that still provides some intuitive insight involves dressing the atomic levels with the red- and blue detuned photon field number states .",
    "originally developed by grimm and coworkers @xcite , this `` doubly dressed '' model results in a ladder of states separated by @xmath34 and an infinite tridiagonal hamiltonian matrix that is well described by metcalf and yatsenko  @xcite . numerically solving for the eigenstates of the hamiltonian",
    "provides an estimate of the bcf magnitude that agrees with the @xmath7-pulse model , and is also in agreement that the optimal phase is @xmath35 . unlike the @xmath7-pulse model it predicts that the optimal rabi frequency is given by @xmath36 this result , larger than eq .",
    "[ eq : rabi_pi ] by about 56% , is in excellent agreement both with experiment and more complete numerical calculations .",
    "applying floquet theory and using a second - order perturbation treatment , this model also yields an estimate of the velocity range of the force , but this prediction is too small by about a factor of two , probably because the effects of doppler shifts are not fully incorporated  @xcite .",
    "a more comprehensive but less transparent approach is to numerically solve the optical bloch equations ( obes )  @xcite in the bichromatic field .",
    "the obes fully describe the internal state of a two - level atom in the rotating - wave approximation ( rwa ) , taking into account the rabi cycling of atomic states in the field as well as spontaneous emission , which is added phenomenologically .",
    "we obtain numerical solutions using a program based largely on code developed for earlier bcf studies by the authors of refs .",
    "the rotating frame is chosen to be at the center frequency of the bichromatic spectrum , leaving some residual time dependence due to the approximately symmetric detunings @xmath37 .",
    "the obes are solved over small time steps in the bichromatic field and the instantaneous force is evaluated using ehrenfest s theorem  @xcite , @xmath38,\\ ] ] and then averaged over several radiative lifetimes .",
    "the atomic velocity is not explicit in the force calculation , but is inferred using a constant - velocity approximation so that the atomic position is given by @xmath39 .",

    "[ eq : rabi_dda ] and the bichromatic beat phase offset is @xmath27 , verifying both of the central predictions of the doubly - dressed atom model . both predictions also agree well with experimental results . under these optimal conditions",

    "[ fig : bcf_profile ] is about @xmath43 , but the profiles take on distinctly different shapes for @xmath44 @xcite , developing broad peaks near @xmath45 with a force nearly as large as for the central zero - velocity peak .",
    "atoms traversing a gaussian bichromatic beam profile will interact with a range of intensities , so a realistic simulation should include an average over the force profiles .",
    "this yields an improved estimate of the bcf velocity range  @xcite , @xmath46 that is half as large as the rough estimate in eq .",
    "[ eq : pipulse_v_range ] .    the time required to slow an atom across this full velocity range is @xmath47 .",
    "this  bichromatic slowing time \" is independent of the detuning @xmath48 and for helium its value is @xmath49s .",
    "it follows that even a fast beam of metastable helium atoms , with @xmath50 , can be decelerated by @xmath51 in an interaction length of less than 1  cm .",
    "another feature of the bcf profile is the sharp drop - off at either end of its range , clearly visible in fig .",
    "[ fig : bcf_profile ] .",
    "if the force is applied for a time greater than the bichromatic slowing time , atoms within the velocity range of the force will `` pile up '' at the low - velocity limit .",
    "this can yield significant cooling in addition to deceleration , as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : lds_results ] and refs .",
    "recently harold metcalf has argued that the cooling is due to radiation exchange between the bichromatic fields , and may not be subject to limitations tied to the rate of spontaneous emission  @xcite .",
    "a practical atomic beam slower for metastable helium must reduce the atomic velocity by at least 700800 m / s to produce a large flux of atoms at mot capture velocities .",
    "ideally , this could be achieved with a single pair of counterpropagating beams producing a bcf profile with a correspondingly large velocity range . however",
    ", this would require unreasonably high irradiances , so it is necessary to break up the required velocity range in some way . in this section",
    "we investigate the feasibility of a static two - stage slower and more generally , we study the large - detuning limits of the bcf .      for efficient deceleration by two successive bcf interactions , the first stage should have a velocity profile doppler shifted so that its leading edge is located in an appropriate portion of the slow tail of the atom velocity profile , and the second stage should have a smaller doppler shift with its leading edge just overlapping the trailing edge of the first profile .",
    "we have constructed a decelerator in the first - stage configuration to test the concept , as diagrammed in fig .  [",
    "fig : ldsexplayout ] .",
    "the metastable helium source is a reverse - pumped , liquid nitrogen cooled dc discharge source patterned closely on a prior design @xcite , with external modifications to permit installation in an existing vacuum chamber .",
    "the metastable atom flux from the source is about @xmath52  he * atoms / sr@xmath53s with a most probable velocity of approximately 1050  m / s and a metastable fraction of roughly @xmath54  @xcite .",
    "the atomic beam passes from the source chamber through a @xmath55 m diameter skimmer aperture into a time - of - flight chamber . after passing through a @xmath56 m diameter collimating aperture ,",
    "it is mechanically chopped by a tuning fork chopper operating at 160  hz with a @xmath57 m slit width .",
    "the resulting chopped atom beam , with a divergence half - angle of 4.1  mrad , travels through the counterpropagating bichromatic decelerating laser beams for a few centimeters . after an additional time - of - flight ( tof ) path ,",
    "the chopped beam impinges on a stainless steel faraday cup .",
    "electrons ejected by he * atom impacts are collected and detected by a ceratron continuous dynode electron multiplier .",
    "the he * velocity distribution is then calculated from the tof spectra , with a velocity resolution of about 67  m / s .",
    "a limitation of this method is that it can not measure velocities slower than about 350 m / s because the slowed atoms will then be overlapped by atoms from the succeeding chopper pulse . for the experiments reported here , we avoid this problem by selecting an initial velocity range high enough in the velocity distribution that the slowed atoms remain above this lower limit .",
    "to measure the velocities in a practical mot loading scheme , a modified beam chopper or a laser tagging method would be required .",
    "the bichromatic laser beam pairs are generated from a single diode laser ( toptica dl100 ) locked to the @xmath58 transition at 1083.3  nm using a saturated absorption spectrometer .",
    "this laser at the atomic frequency @xmath9 is double - passed through an acousto - optic modulator ( aom ) operating at the bichromatic detuning frequency @xmath59 , producing two superimposed frequencies at @xmath60 .",
    "it is then coupled into a cw fiber laser amplifier ( nufern nuamp ) with a single - mode output of up to 7  w. the amplified beat - note train is split into equal parts , then doppler frequency shifts of @xmath61  mhz are added using additional aoms , to center the bichromatic force profile at a velocity of about 866  m / s . an optical delay line is used to set the relative phase between the two bichromatic beat note trains to the optimal @xmath62  @xcite .",
    "the bichromatic beams enter the chamber linearly polarized , pass through quarter - wave retarders to produce @xmath63 light , and cross the helium atomic beam at an angle of about @xmath64 .",
    "the beams are tightly focused to waists with top - hat radii of 0.32  mm to provide the required irradiance without exceeding the capabilities of the amplifier . because of this tight focus the overlap with the atomic beam is imperfect , resulting in an interaction region about 3.7  cm long but covering only about 40% of the atomic beam .",
    "the results for this large - detuning slowing are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : lds_results ] .",
    "we extend previous work using a fixed detuning of @xmath65 ( @xmath66300 mhz ) @xcite by exploring several different detunings .",
    "the figure shows raw experimental data without enhancement to compensate for imperfect beam overlap , as was done in some prior bcf experiments on he *  @xcite .",
    "consequently , the depth of the holes in the velocity profiles can be at most 40% of the population , which may be further reduced because the atomic beam contains some atoms in the @xmath67 metastable state that can not be slowed .",
    "unfortunately these experiments were terminated abruptly by the failure of our 7  w fiber amplifier . as a result ,",
    "only one set of data was acquired in the previously unexplored range of detunings between @xmath65 ( 300 mhz ) , where a large bcf was observed @xcite , and @xmath68 , where no effect could be found @xcite .",
    "our new results are consistent with these prior reports , showing a badly disrupted bcf at an intermediate @xmath69 , establishing an appareent upper limit to the bcf that we discuss further in sec .  [ sec : dephasing ] .    , consistent with previous observations of an upper limit to the bcf detuning . ]",
    "the changes in the velocity profiles shown in fig .  [ fig : lds_results ] were confirmed to be due to the bcf by adjusting the beat note phase , by blocking one of the two bichromatic beams , and by blocking a single frequency component in one of the beams . as expected , when the phase is increased to @xmath70 , the sign of the force changes and the deceleration becomes an acceleration .",
    "this is perhaps the most obvious and identifying signature of the bcf .",
    "when the phase is set to @xmath28 or @xmath29 , the force vanishes altogether , also as expected . if one or more of the frequency components is blocked the bcf vanishes and smaller peaks appear in the atomic velocity distribution due to the radiative force from each bichromatic frequency component .    to establish a consistent convention for measuring the extent of slowing and the velocity range of the bcf",
    ", we define  slowing \" as the velocity difference between the peak of the slowed atom distribution and the corresponding minimum of the hole in the slowed velocity distribution , as indicated in fig .",
    "[ fig : lds_results ] .",
    "the velocity range of the bcf can be estimated by measuring the full width between the half - maximum of the slow side of the slowed atom peak and the half - minimum on the fast side of the hole in the original velocity distribution .",
    "this is the convention used by the metcalf group in their bcf slowing experiments  @xcite . in some circumstances",

    "note that the result for @xmath71 does not exhibit a velocity profile consistent with unidirectional bcf slowing , so this slowing measurement is shown only for comparison . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     the optimal experimental chirp ramp durations are found to increase from about 30 to 50 @xmath72s as the chirp magnitude increases from 100 - 300 mhz . as mentioned previously , the monte carlo model described in sec .",
    "[ sec : chirpmodel ] yields results in good agreement if the bichromatic force magnitude is reduced by a factor of two from its ideal value .",

    "again the agreement with experiment is good .",
    "the most probable velocity of the slowed group of atoms experimentally matches the model prediction within 20  @xmath73 , although the fraction of slowed atoms is relatively small in this initial experimental configuration .",
    "there was no slowing observed when the chirp was increased to 400  mhz , indicating badly sub - optimal bcf conditions .",
    "the model predicts this behavior in two scenarios  a smaller bcf magnitude than expected , or periodic , temporary loss of the bcf as would be caused by occasional large phase errors . both of these factors were potentially present in the experimental configuration for this initial test .    ]",
    "the small fraction of slowed atoms was caused not only by limited beam overlap , but by practical difficulties in using a chopped atomic beam to measure velocity distributions with a single frequency - chirp ramp .",
    "the atomic beam pulse duration , about 40  @xmath72s at the chopper , expands to more than 120  @xmath72s by the time the atoms reach the interaction region .",
    "this is longer than the chirp ramp duration , so atoms on the leading edge and trailing edges of the pulse fall outside the chirped bcf profile and are not slowed .",
    "this effect is more pronounced with faster frequency ramps and results in a much reduced number of slowed atoms . in a fully realized design , rapidly repeating chirp sequences can be used in conjunction with a cw atomic beam to assure that most of the atoms in a continuous beam experience the full chirped bcf force , as discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : fullslower ] .",
    "while our initial attempts to slow he * atoms using the chirped bcf scheme described in sec .  [ sec : chirp_exp ] have limited to @xmath74  m / s , this is already a significant improvement , and the results have allowed us to identify straightforward improvements that will greatly extend the range .",

    "[ fig : finalmodel ] , monte carlo modeling indicates that the 600  mhz chirp , together with the increased static velocity range at a detuning of @xmath76 , is sufficient to slow atoms from the lower half of the initial velocity distribution to final velocities of 0 - 100 m / s .    with our present 160 hz beam chopping rate",
    ", the average brightness of the slowed atomic beam would be very low due to the atom beam duty cycle of only 1% . to create a slower capable of replacing a zeeman slower ,",
    "the chirp configuration must be adapted to use a continuous or near - continuous atomic beam .",
    "this requires that the frequency chirping cycle repeats continuously and as quickly as possible .",
    "using a chirp ramp duration of 10  @xmath72s with an additional 5  @xmath72s to reset the laser frequency gives a cycle period of 15  @xmath72s .",
