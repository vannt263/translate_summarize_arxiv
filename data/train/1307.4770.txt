    "quantum states of light such as squeezed sates or entangled states , have long been known to produce greater precision , resolution and sensitivity in metrology , imaging , and object ranging  @xcite than what is possible classically .",
    "one of the most prominent examples of such a non - classical state is the n00n state  @xcite , which is an equal coherent superposition of @xmath1 photons in one path of a mach - zehnder interferometer with none in the other , and vice - versa .",
    "this state may be written as @xmath2 , and can be used to achieve heisenberg - limited supersensitivity as well as super resolution in quantum metrology  @xcite . in recent years , several schemes for reliable production of such states have been proposed , making them useful in super - precision measurements in optical interferometry , atomic spectroscopy , gravitational wave detection , and magnetometry along with potential applications in rapidly evolving fields such as quantum imaging and sensing  @xcite .",
    "however , due to inevitable interactions with the surrounding environment , the n00n state tends to decohere in presence of noisy environment .",
    "recently , a few authors investigated the effects of photon loss on the performance of n00n state in quantum interferometric setups  @xcite , that demonstrate that n00n states undergoing loss decohere very rapidly , making it difficult to achieve super - sensitivity and resolution in a lossy environment .",
    "proposed a class of generalized fock states , known as @xmath0 states , by introducing decoy photons to the n00n state in both paths of the interferometer , and showed that such states provide better metrological performance than n00n states in presence of photon loss  @xcite .    in real life applications such as a quantum sensor or radar , phase fluctuation due to different noise sources",
    "can further degrade the phase - sensitivity by adding significant noise to the phase @xmath3 to be estimated or detected .",
    "for instance , when one considers propagation of the entangled states over distances of kilometers , through say the atmosphere , then atmosphere turbulence becomes an issue as it can cause uncontrollable noise or fluctuation in the phase . in this sense , phase - fluctuation stands as the most detrimental for phase estimation , rendering the quantum metrological advantage for achieving super - sensitivity and super - resolution totally useless .",
    "it is therefore imperative to investigate the impacts of such random phase - fluctuations on the phase - sensitivity of quantum mechanically entangled states .",
    "in particular , we consider both the @xmath0 and n00n states , and show how the phase - sensitivity and visibility of the phase signal are affected by added phase - fluctuations caused by turbulence noise .",
    "we study the parity detection  @xcite for the interferometry with the phase - fluctuated @xmath0 and n00n states .",
    "this detection scheme has been shown to reach heisenberg limited sensitivity when combined with the lossless n00n state  @xcite . here",
    "we calculate the minimum detectable phase shift in presence of the turbulence noise , and show that the lower bound of the phase - fluctuated sensitivity for both the states saturates the quantum cramr - rao bound  @xcite , which gives the ultimate limit to the precision of the phase measurement .",
    "this result suggests that the parity detection serves as an optimal detection strategy when the given states are subject to the phase - fluctuations .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we introduce the @xmath0 and n00n states , and describe their evolution under the phase fluctuations .",
    "we define the parity detection operator in section iii , and calculate the phase - sensitivity and the visibility with the phase noise using the parity operator . in section iv , we derive lowest possible uncertainty ( quantum cramr - rao bound ) in estimating the phase @xmath3 for these path - entangled fock states , and show that the parity operator saturates the quantum cramr - rao bound for both @xmath0 and n00n states . using the same detection technique , we then derive the phase - sensitivity and the visibility in a more general case with both the photon loss and phase - fluctuations in sec v. section vi contains our concluding remarks , and further outlook with the potential implementations of the phase estimation with fluctuating phase noise .",
    "the states we now wish to investigate are the following : @xmath4 and @xmath5 indicate the two paths of a two - mode optical interferometer .",
    "these states are called the @xmath0 states , and they can be produced , for example , by post - selecting on the output of a pair of optical parametric oscillators  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath0 state reduces to a n00n state when @xmath6 and @xmath7 , leading to latexmath:[\\ ] ]      in quantum optical metrology , the precision of the phase measurement is given by the phase - sensitivity .",
    "we now calculate the phase sensitivity for both the @xmath0 and n00n states using the expectation values of the parity operator obtained above .     of the @xmath0 state @xmath34 ) , or the n00n state @xmath35 , having the same phase information , as a function of phase shift @xmath3 from a two - mode interferometer for different values of @xmath20 : @xmath36 ( curved blue dashed line ) , @xmath37 ( curved black double - dotted line ) , @xmath38 ( curved purple dotted line ) . the heisenberg limit ( @xmath39 ) and the shot noise limit ( @xmath40 ) of the phase sensitivity for the n00n state",
    "are shown by the red solid line and the black dashed line , respectively , for comparison.,height=230 ]    phase sensitivity using the parity detection is defined by the linear error propagation method  @xcite @xmath41 where @xmath42 .",
    "given @xmath43 the phase - sensitivity with the parity detection for the @xmath0 state is @xmath44     of the @xmath0 state @xmath34 ) , or the n00n state @xmath35 as a function of @xmath20 .",
    "the shot noise limits ( snl ) and the heisenberg limits ( hl ) of the phase - sensitivity for both the states are also shown for comparison . ]    for the n00n state the phase - sensitivity with the parity detection is similarly obtained as @xmath45 we note that in the limit of no dephasing @xmath46 , @xmath47 . for the n00n state , @xmath48 case leads to @xmath49 ( heisenberg limit of the phase - sensitivity for the noon state ) .    in fig .  2",
    ", we plot the phase sensitivities @xmath50 and @xmath51 for the various dephasing rates @xmath20 choosing @xmath52 , so that the amount of phase information is the same for either state . for @xmath52 , eqs .",
    "( 13 ) and ( 14 ) show that the @xmath0 and n00n states give rise to the same phase - sensitivity .",
    "in particular , we show the phase - sensitivity for the states @xmath35 and @xmath53 , and find that both the states perform equally well in presence of phase fluctuations when parity detection is used , although the former has been shown to outperform n00n states in presence of photon loss  @xcite .",
    "the minimum phase - sensitivities @xmath54 can be obtained from eqs .",
    "( 13 ) and ( 14 ) for @xmath55 , or @xmath56 for the @xmath0 or n00n states , respectively . for the @xmath35 and @xmath53 states ,",
    "we plot the minimum phase - sensitivity @xmath54 in fig",
    ".  3 for as a function of @xmath20 , and compare with the snl and hl for both the states .",
    "the hl for a general @xmath0 state is @xmath57 in terms of the total number of photons available , and is equal to @xmath39 for the n00n state .",
    "the snl for these two states is given by @xmath58 and @xmath40 , respectively . in fig .",
    "3 , we see that the minimum phase - sensitivity @xmath54 hits the hl for the noon state for @xmath59 only , while it never reaches the hl for the @xmath0 state .",
    "however , @xmath54 is below the snl for both of the states for small values of @xmath20 , but increase in the phase - fluctuation , _ i.e. _ @xmath20 , leads to the phase - sensitivity above the snl , as shown in fig .",
    "we use the parity operator for the detection , and to quantify the degree of measured phase information we define the relative visibility as @xmath60 where the numerator corresponds to the difference in the maximum and minimum parity signal in presence of phase fluctuations , while the denominator corresponds to the one with no dephasing , @xmath61 @xmath62 . visibility for the n00n state is similarly defined as @xmath63    using eqs .",
    "( 10 ) and ( 11 ) , we then obtain the visibilities for the @xmath0 state @xmath64 and for the n00n state @xmath65 we note that the visibility of the n00n state with the parity detection in eq .",
    "( 18 ) agrees with the visibility in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the visibility in eqs .",
    "( 17 ) and ( 18 ) depends on the value of the dephasing rate @xmath20 and @xmath1 ( or @xmath66 ) , and for a given value of @xmath20 , the visibility falls down faster as n increases .",
    "hence , high - n00n states ( or @xmath0 states ) with large number of photons are very much susceptible to the phase - fluctuations compared to the low - noon states , and hence are not suitable to achieve metrological advantage with robustness in presence of phase noise .",
    "this is shown in fig .  4 , where we plotted the visibility for different n ( or @xmath67 ) with respect to the dephasing rate @xmath20 .     of the @xmath0 state for different @xmath67 ( for different @xmath1 in case of n00n states with the same phase information ) as a function of @xmath20 .",
    "the visibility @xmath68 is plotted for @xmath1(or @xmath67)=2 [ solid blue line ] , @xmath1(or @xmath67)=4 [ dashed red line ] , @xmath1(or @xmath67)=6 [ double dotted black line ] , and @xmath1(or @xmath67)=8 [ dotdashed purple line ) .",
    "we see that the visibility drops faster for larger values of @xmath67 ( or @xmath1).,height=230 ]",
    "in order to minimize the uncertainty @xmath69 of the measured phase , we now seek to provide the lowest bound on the uncertainty of the phase .",
    "this bound is given by the quantum cramr - rao bound @xmath70 , and is inversely proportional to the quantum fisher information @xmath71  @xcite @xmath72 a general framework for estimating the ultimate precision limit in noisy quantum - enhanced metrology has been studied by escher _",
    "et al _  @xcite . in the following ,",
    "we first obtain the quantum fisher information , leading to the quantum cramr - rao bound for both the @xmath0 and n00n states in presence of the phase fluctuations , and show that the parity detection attains the quantum cramr - rao bound for both of these states subject to the dephasing .",
    "the quantum cramr - rao bound has been shown to be always reached asymptotically by maximum likelihood estimations and a projective measurement in the eigenbasis of the symmetric logarithmic derivative @xmath73  @xcite , which is a self - adjoint operator satisfying the equation @xmath74 where @xmath75 is given by eq .",
    "( 6 ) for @xmath0 state and by eq .",
    "( 7 ) for n00n state .",
    "the quantum fisher information @xmath76 is then expressed as  @xcite @xmath77 the symmetric logarithmic operator @xmath73 is given by @xmath78 for all @xmath79 and @xmath80 , where @xmath81 and @xmath82 are the eigenvalue and the corresponding eigenvector of @xmath75 . evaluating @xmath75 and @xmath83 from eq .",
    "( 6 ) and then using eqs . ( 21 ) and ( 22 ) , we obtain the quantum fisher information for the @xmath0 state @xmath84 leading to the quantum cramr - rao bound @xmath85 for the n00n states , similar calculation with eq .",
    "( 7 ) yields @xmath86 and @xmath87 eqs .  ( 24 ) and ( 26 ) represent the lowest bound on the uncertainty of the phase measurement for the @xmath0 and n00n states , respectively .    for a detection scheme to be optimal",
    ", it has to saturate the quantum cramr - rao bound .",
    "( 13 ) and ( 14 ) represent phase sensitivity for the @xmath0 and n00n states respectively , and these expressions can be shown to be identical to the quantum cramr - rao bounds in eqs .",
    "( 24 ) and ( 26 ) for @xmath55 , or @xmath56 for the @xmath0 or n00n states respectively .",
    "thus , parity detection saturates the quantum cramr - rao bounds and is optimal for both the states in presence of the phase fluctuations .",
    "following ref .",
    "@xcite , two fictitious beam splitters are added before stage i of our previous configuration to model photon loss from the system into the environment , as shown in fig .  5 .",
    "the two fictitious beam splitters have transmittance @xmath88 and @xmath89 , and reflectance @xmath90 and @xmath91 , respectively .",
    "general @xmath88 and @xmath89 are used in the following derivation of the density matrix , but later we assume @xmath92 to mimic the local path which is well - isolated from the environment .     and @xmath93 , the system results in a mixed state at stage i. ]    the photon loss entangles the system with the environment and leaves the system in a mixed state . for a general @xmath94 input state , the density matrix of the system at stage",
    "ii can be easily deducted from ref .  @xcite as @xmath95 where @xmath96 , @xmath97 as before , and the coefficients @xmath98 are defined as @xmath99 given the system undergoes pure dephasing after stage ii , we may use previous result and show that the evolution of the density matrix @xmath100 is @xmath101 it is then easy to see that @xmath102 , @xmath103 , @xmath104 and @xmath105 .",
    "similar to ref .",
    "@xcite , we define @xmath106 and it is straightforward to show that @xmath107 and @xmath108 . from eqs .",
    "( 10 ) and ( 27 ) , the parity signal of a @xmath94 state under both photon loss and phase fluctuation can be shown to be @xmath109 this gives rise to the phase - sensitivity for the parity detection for a @xmath94 state under both photon - loss and phase - fluctuations as @xmath110 where linear error propagation method in eq .",
    "( 12 ) is employed .",
    "notice that when loss is negligible this sensitivity recovers eq .",
    "( 13 ) .    a relative visibility with respect to both loss and phase - fluctuations can be defined as @xmath111 where @xmath112 characterizes the loss in the upper path and @xmath113 is set to be zero as aforementioned . in the limit of @xmath114 ,",
    "@xmath115 approaches one and the visibility reduces to the previous result . notice the dephasing only affects the off - diagonal terms of the density matrix while loss affects both diagonal and off - diagonal terms .",
    "however , because of the linearity of the mach - zehnder interferometer , the effect from photon loss is independent of that from phase - fluctuation , as expected .",
    "all results in this section apply to n00n states with @xmath116 and @xmath117 .",
    "in this work , we studied the effects of phase fluctuations on the phase sensitivity and visibility of @xmath0 and n00n states in an optical interferometric setup .",
    "although @xmath0 states are more robust than n00n states against photon loss , we showed that they do not provide any better performance in presence of such phase fluctuations than their equivalent n00n counterpart .",
    "we have used the parity detection technique for phase estimation , that can be readily implemented using photon - number - resolving detectors  @xcite in the low power regime and using optical nonlinearities and homodyning in the high power regime  @xcite . using the same detection technique , we explicitly derived the phase - sensitivity and the visibility in a more general case with both the photon loss and phase - fluctuations .",
    "we have also presented a brief study on the quantum fisher information for both the @xmath0 and n00n states and showed that the parity detection serves as the optimal detection strategy in both cases as it saturates the quantum cramr - rao bound of the interferometric scheme .",
