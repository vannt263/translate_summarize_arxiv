    "the study of phase transitions into absorbing states is a fascinating field of nonequilibrium statistical physics  @xcite .",
    "such phase transitions can be observed in models for the spreading of some ( generally non - conserved ) agent as a result of a competition between local reproduction and decay . if the rate for reproduction is sufficiently high , the system is able to maintain a fluctuating active phase where the stationary concentration of the spreading agent is positive . on the other hand ,",
    "if the decay process dominates , the concentration of the spreading agent decreases and tends to zero .",
    "eventually the system becomes trapped in an absorbing state from where it can not escape .",
    "an interesting situation emerges at the borderline between survival and extinction . here",
    "the system undergoes a nonequilibrium phase transition which is characterized by non - trivial critical behavior .",
    "it is believed that transitions into absorbing states can be categorized into a finite number of universality classes .",
    "typically each class is associated with certain symmetry properties of the dynamics .    at present two universality classes",
    "are firmly established .",
    "the first and most prominent one is the universality class of _ directed percolation _ ( dp )  @xcite .",
    "the dp class is characterized by the _ absence _ of symmetries ( apart from conventional symmetries such as translation and reflection invariance ) and covers a wide range of models  @xcite . roughly speaking ,",
    "dp models follow the reaction - diffusion scheme @xmath7 , @xmath8 .",
    "in addition , there has to be a nonlinear mechanism which limits the particle density . in ` fermionic ' models with at most one particle per site ,",
    "the density is limited automatically . in ` bosonic ' models , allowing for infinitely many particles per site , this mechanism has to be implemented by adding the reaction @xmath9 .",
    "it is important to note that dp is a _",
    "unary _ spreading process , i.e. , individual particles are able to reproduce and destruct themselves .",
    "some time ago grassberger _",
    "et  al . _",
    "@xcite discovered a second universality class which can be considered as a generalization of directed percolation from one to two absorbing states related by an _ exact _",
    "@xmath10-symmetry ( dp2 ) .",
    "it comprises various models , including nonequilibrium ising models  @xcite , certain monomer - dimer models  @xcite , as well as generalized versions of the domany - kinzel model and the contact process  @xcite . in 1 + 1 dimensions it is possible to regard kinks between differently oriented absorbing domains as particles . by definition ,",
    "these particles evolve according to a parity - conserving dynamics , exemplified by branching - annihilating random walks with two offspring @xmath11 , @xmath12 @xcite . for this reason , the universality class is often referred to as the _ parity - conserving _ ( pc ) class .",
    "however , it should be noted that the pc class and the dp2 class are different in higher dimensions .",
    "three years ago , howard and tuber  @xcite raised the question whether there might exist a third universality class of models with a phase transition from ` real ' to ` imaginary ' noise . as a prototype",
    ", they introduced the annihilation - fission ( af ) process @xmath13 , @xmath14 with single - particle diffusion .",
    "obviously , this process is neither parity - conserving nor invariant under any other unconventional symmetry transformation .",
    "in contrast to dp and dp2 , the af model is a _ binary _ process , i.e. , only pairs of particles can decay or reproduce themselves .",
    "the critical properties at the transition are still poorly understood .",
    "recently , carlon _ et .",
    "_ analyzed the transition using density matrix renormalization group techniques  @xcite . estimating the critical exponents they arrived at the conclusion that the transition of the af process should belong to the dp2 universality class , although there is no @xmath10 symmetry or parity conservation law .",
    "however , as pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite , various physical arguments suggest that the af process might belong to an independent universality class which has not been investigated before .",
    "since the universality class could not be identified so far , it is of interest to understand the most salient features of the transition in the af process from a descriptive point of view . to this end",
    ", we introduce an effective model which separates the dynamics of pairs and solitary particles in the af process by introducing two species of particles @xmath4 and @xmath5 . the @xmath4",
    "s perform an ordinary dp process while the @xmath5 s are subjected to an annihilating random walk .",
    "both subsystems are cyclically coupled by particle transmutation .",
    "it is shown that this three - state model exhibits a nonequilibrium phase transition which is similar to the one observed in the af process .    the following section briefly summarizes the phenomenological properties of the af process . in sec .  [ interpretation ]",
    "we demonstrate that the critical behavior is governed by two competing dynamic modes for spreading and diffusion . based on this interpretation",
    "we introduce an effective model involving two species of particles ( see sec .  [ model ] ) . in sec .",
    "[ numerics ]",
    "the critical exponents of this model are estimated by monte carlo simulations .",
    "the article ends with several concluding remarks in sec .",
    "[ conclusions ] .",
    "assuming the usual scaling picture for phase transitions into absorbing states , we expect the af process to be characterized by four critical exponents @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and @xmath18 . the first one is associated with the field - theoretic annihilation operator and describes the behavior of the stationary density @xmath19 close to the transition . the exponent @xmath16 is associated with the creation operator and plays a role whenever initial conditions are specified .",
    "for example , the survival probability of a cluster grown from a single seed involves the exponent @xmath20 .",
    "the other two exponents are related to the spatial and temporal correlation lengths @xmath21 and @xmath22 , respectively .",
    "it should be noted that in the case of dp the two order parameter exponents @xmath15 and @xmath16 coincide because of a duality symmetry ( see e.g. ref .",
    "in the present case , however , they turn out to be different .    using a density matrix renormalization group approach , carlon _ et .",
    "estimated the critical exponents of the af process for various diffusion rates @xmath23 .",
    "since their estimates @xmath24 and @xmath25 were in fair agreement with the numerical values of dp2 exponents ( see table 1 ) , they concluded that the af process should belong to the dp2 universality class , although there is no @xmath10-symmetry or parity conservation law in the system .",
    "this conclusion , however , collides with the general believe that critical phenomena are determined by their symmetry properties or , equivalently , by their associated field theories . without the required symmetries on the microscopic level , a special mechanism would be necessary in order to restore these symmetries effectively on large scales .",
    "as there is no such mechanism , it is near at hand to expect that the af process does not belong to the dp2 class . to support this point of view ,",
    "preliminary monte - carlo simulations were presented in ref .",
    "@xcite and later improved by grassberger and dor  @xcite . because of strong corrections to scaling , the estimates for the critical exponents depend on the numerical effort .",
    "the estimates for @xmath26 , for example , are scattered over the range @xmath27 and seem to decrease with increasing simulation time .",
    "a similar tendency was observed for the exponents @xmath28 and @xmath15 .",
    "moreover , it is not yet fully clear to what extent the exponents depend on the diffusion rate @xmath29 .",
    "a tentative list of critical exponents , including recent results obtained by simulations on parallel computers  @xcite , is given in table 1 .",
    ".[tab ] estimates for the critical exponents in 1 + 1 dimensions .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     for @xmath30 the corresponding exponent is given by @xmath31 .",
    "similar measurements for @xmath32 and @xmath33 ( not shown here ) suggest that this value is the same for all @xmath34 . in order to obtain the dynamic exponent @xmath35",
    ", we perform finite size simulations at criticality . here",
    "the particle densities should obey the scaling form @xmath36 where @xmath37 is a universal scaling function .",
    "thus , plotting @xmath38 against @xmath39 , all data sets should collapse onto a single curve . comparing different data",
    "collapses it turns out that @xmath40 shows a much cleaner scaling behavior than @xmath41 . as shown in fig .",
    "[ figcoll ] , the best collapse is obtained for @xmath42 and @xmath43 .    to obtain the third exponent",
    ", we study the behavior @xmath44 below and above criticality . according to the usual scaling theory for absorbing - state transition",
    ", we expect the scaling form @xmath45 where @xmath46 denotes the distance from criticality . plotting @xmath47 against @xmath48(see fig .  [ figcoll ] )",
    ", the best data collapse is obtained for @xmath49 and @xmath50 .    in order to cross - check these estimates",
    ", we perform dynamic simulations starting with a single pair of particles located in the center  @xcite . as usual in this type of simulations , we measure the survival probability @xmath51 that the system has not yet reached one of the two absorbing states , the average numbers of particles @xmath52 and @xmath53 , and the mean square spreading of all particles from the origin @xmath54 averaged over the surviving runs . assuming that @xmath52 and @xmath53 scale asymptotically with the same exponent , these quantities should obey the power laws @xmath55 with certain dynamical exponents @xmath56 und @xmath57 . as shown in fig .  [ figseed ]",
    ", the survival probability shows a clean power law over almost five decades .",
    "moreover , the quotient @xmath58 quickly tends to a constant value .",
    "fitting power laws to the data shown in fig .",
    "[ figseed ] , we obtain the estimates @xmath59 together with the previous results these estimates satisfy the generalized hyperscaling relation  @xcite @xmath60 within numerical errors . combining all results , the critical exponents are given by @xmath61 it should be noted that the error bars were obtained by assuming power - law behavior .",
    "thus , they do not include systematic errors due to possible corrections to scaling emerging after very long time .",
    "this work was motivated by recent studies of the annihilation - fission process which exhibits a novel type of nonequilibrium critical behavior .",
    "using a scale - invariant space - time plot we have demonstrated that critical clusters of the af process are characterized by an interplay of two different dynamic modes . in the high - density mode",
    "we observe spreading avalanches whereas the low - density mode is characterized by random walks of solitary particles . in order to understand the interplay between these modes from a phenomenological point of view",
    ", we have introduced an effective model which involves two species of particles . the dynamic rules of this model can be regarded as being composed of cyclically coupled dp and pair annihilation processes , i.e. , it follows the reaction - diffusion scheme @xmath62 , @xmath63 , @xmath64 .",
    "the model exhibits a nonequilibrium phase transition which is in many respects similar to the one observed in the af process .",
    "in fact , the af process and the three - state model proposed in the present work have several features in common :    * they both have two non - symmetric absorbing states , namely the empty lattice and the state with a single diffusing particle .",
    "* there is no unconventional symmetry ( such as parity conservation ) . *",
    "both models exhibit a continuous nonequilibrium phase transition with non - dp critical exponents . *",
    "the visual appearance of critical clusters is very similar ( see fig .",
    "[ figdemo ] ) .    compared to the af process",
    ", the three - state model has several advantages . on the one hand , it is defined as a two - site nearest neighbor process . on the other hand , corrections to scaling are less severe , allowing us to determine the critical exponents more accurately .",
    "there are several open questions .",
    "is the critical behavior of the three - state model universal ?",
    "if this is indeed the case , does it represent a independent universality class different from dp and dp2 ? are the af process and the present model in the same universality class , i.e. , do they have the same critical exponents ? from the field - theoretic point of view , there is no reason for them to coincide . yet the two classes may ` intersect ' in 1 + 1 dimensions .",
    "very recently , dor carried out a systematic study of the annihilation / fission process performing simulations on a parallel computer combined with generalized mean field approximations and coherent anomaly extrapolations  @xcite .",
    "he reports two different universality classes for low and high values of the diffusion constant @xmath29 .",
    "the corresponding critical exponents are shown in table 1 . according to dor , the exponents for @xmath65 are in fair agreement with the exponents observed in the three - state model . however",
    ", this conclusion is still speculative and needs to be substantiated by further investigations ."
