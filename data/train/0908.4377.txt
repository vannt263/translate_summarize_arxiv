    "entanglement is considered to be a key resource for quantum information technology @xcite .",
    "its nonlocal character , which is truly quantum and beyond classical realm , is the driving force of the various attractive quantum information protocols .",
    "such a highly quantum state however is not easily found in laboratories , and its preparation itself is an important issue for the realization of the ideas of quantum information",
    ".    the entanglement would be most simply and naturally generated by a direct interaction between quantum systems , or between qubits in the context of quantum information @xcite .",
    "there would be however physical setups in which qubits are located separately beyond the range of the mutual interaction . a possible way to make",
    "those qubits entangled is to send `` mediators '' to the qubits in order for them to communicate in an indirect manner through the mediators .",
    "such an idea has been explored in the literature @xcite and actually employed in several experiments @xcite .    a typical scheme based on this idea is the following .",
    "we consider two spin qubits @xmath0 and @xmath1 and take another spin as a mediator qubit @xmath2 . @xmath0 and @xmath1 are initially in a product state @xmath3 , and @xmath2 polarized in @xmath4 is sent to make @xmath0 and @xmath1 entangled .",
    "@xmath2 interacts first with @xmath0 and then with @xmath1 .",
    "suppose that those interactions preserve the total spin angular momentum of the three qubits @xmath5 .",
    "then , if @xmath2 is found to be flipped down to @xmath6 after the interactions with @xmath0 and @xmath1 , we are sure that the spin of either @xmath0 or @xmath1 is flipped up but we do not know which , and we end up with an entanglement @xmath7 between @xmath0 and @xmath1 , with certain amplitudes @xmath8 and @xmath9 .    in this scheme ,",
    "the post - selection of the spin state of the mediator plays a crucial role .",
    "there would be however various physical setups where such post - selection is technically hard .",
    "for instance , if we consider an electron as a mediator , in the context of a solid - state system @xcite , the post - selection of its spin state would be difficult by the current technology .",
    "in addition , the above scheme requires the preparation of the target qubits in @xmath3 , before starting the protocol .",
    "preparation of a quantum state ( not necessarily an entangled state ) from an _ arbitrary _ given state is also an important and nontrivial subject .",
    "a generic scheme has been proposed to prepare a pure quantum state from an arbitrary ( mixed , in general ) state by repeated measurements on an ancilla system interacting with the target @xcite .",
    "applying this idea to the present issue , schemes for the extraction of entanglement between separated qubits , from an arbitrary given state @xcite or from a state belonging to a certain class of states @xcite , by repeated measurements on the mediator have been explored .",
    "still , they require the preparation and the post - selection of the internal state of the mediator .    in this paper",
    ", we propose a scheme which is less demanding in these respects : neither the preparation nor the post - selection of the spin state of the mediator @xmath2 is required .",
    "the initial state of the target qubits @xmath0 and @xmath1 can be arbitrary , from which the singlet state of @xmath0 and @xmath1 is extracted .",
    "the idea is to make use of the resonant scattering of @xmath2 by @xmath0 and @xmath1 , controlled by the entanglement in @xmath0 and @xmath1 , which was discovered in ref .",

    "@xcite . preparing and post - selecting the spin state , e.g.  of an electron in solid , are technically hard in practice .",
    "the scheme we are going to discuss in the following has an advantage over the previous schemes in this respect .",
    "our procedure is the following :    1 .",
    "the initial state of @xmath0 and @xmath1 is _ arbitrary _ and is a mixed state @xmath12 in general .",
    "we send @xmath2 with its spin _ arbitrary _ ( which can be `` random '' ) from the left to @xmath0 and @xmath1 , with a resonant wave vector @xmath43 , and detect it on the right after the scattering , _ without resolving the spin state of x_. 3 .",
    "we repeat this process many times , and if @xmath2 is repeatedly confirmed to be transmitted to the right ( _ irrespectively of its spin state _ ) , the singlet state @xmath38 ( an entanglement ) is extracted in @xmath0 and @xmath1 from @xmath12 .",
    "once @xmath2 is confirmed to be reflected in a trial , we stop the procedure : we fail to extract the singlet state .",
    "the singlet state is obtained only when all the @xmath2s sent are confirmed to be transmitted .",
    "this is a probabilistic scheme for the extraction of the singlet state .    in the scheme proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite , the incident spin of @xmath2 is prepared in @xmath4 and the same state @xmath4 is post - selected after the scattering ( irrespectively of whether it is transmitted or reflected ) . in the present scheme , on the other hand , neither the preparation nor the post - selection of the incident spin is required . instead , we post - select the transmission events .",
    "the singlet spin state of the pair of qubits is extracted by the repetition of the post - selection for the spatial degree of freedom of the mediator .",
    "if the incident spin of @xmath2 is not polarized and is completely random , it would be represented by the completely mixed state @xmath45 on average .",
    "then , the confirmation of the transmission of @xmath2 induces the following change in the spin state of @xmath0 and @xmath1 , @xmath46 up to normalization .",
    "notice that , since we do not resolve the spin state of @xmath2 after the transmission , we take trace over possible spin states of @xmath2 .",
    "@xmath47 repetitions of this process drive @xmath0 and @xmath1 into @xmath48 here the extracted state @xmath49 is normalized to unity .",
    "this state @xmath49 is obtained only when the transmission of @xmath2 is confirmed successively @xmath47 times , and the normalization factor @xmath50 gives the probability for this to occur .",
    "we are going to prove that @xmath0 and @xmath1 are driven into the singlet state @xmath51 after the repeated confirmations of the transmissions , and the probability approaches @xmath52 the singlet state @xmath38 is extracted from an arbitrary given state @xmath12 with a _ nonvanishing _",

    "by looking at the explicit expression of @xmath24 at resonance @xmath43 , given in ( [ eqn : trreso - a ] ) , it is easy to check that the singlet state @xmath54 is a fixed point of the map @xmath55 and the projection onto the singlet state @xmath56 is the eigenprojection of @xmath55 belonging to the eigenvalue @xmath57 , @xmath58 the convergence ( [ eqn : purification ] ) is proved by showing that the singlet state is the only eigenvector belonging to the eigenvalue @xmath57 and all the other eigenvalues are strictly smaller than @xmath57 .",
    "the proof proceeds similarly to a proof found in @xcite .",

    "the inequality ( [ eqn : ieq1 ] ) implies @xmath71 let us look at the first condition . by noting the unitarity ( [ eqn : unitarity ] ) , it is written as @xmath72 and",
    "hence , is reduced to @xmath73 by inserting the explicit expression of @xmath25 at resonance @xmath43 , given in ( [ eqn : trreso - b ] ) , it reads @xmath74 since this coefficient is nonvanishing , this implies @xmath75 and further , @xmath76 similarly , the second condition in ( [ eqn : cond1 ] ) implies @xmath77 combination of the conditions ( [ eqn : sigma1 ] ) and ( [ eqn : sigma2 ] ) yields @xmath78 and hence , @xmath79 with a real number @xmath80 . inserting ( [ eqn : sigma1 ] ) and ( [ eqn : u ] ) to ( [ eqn : polar ] ) , we obtain @xmath81 which yields @xmath82 for the eigenvalue in ( [ eqn : uniteigen ] ) .",
    "since the phase @xmath83 in the eigenvector is irrelevant to the eigenvalue problem , this proves that the singlet state @xmath54 is the only eigenvector of the map @xmath55 belonging to a peripheral eigenvalue , which is actually @xmath57 , and all the other eigenvalues are strictly smaller than @xmath57 .",
