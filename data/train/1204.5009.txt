    "<S> it is , however , to be noted that the intensity and frequency of the counter - clockwise rotational mode are larger and lower , respectively , than those of the clockwise rotational mode according to the theoretical simulation . </S>",

    "<S> the internal vibrations of skyrmion should be endowed with the magnetoelectric coupling . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , nontrivial microwave responses such as directional dichroism are expected similarly to electromagnons in the thz regime@xcite . </S>",
