    "in the last decade the coherent manipulation of cold atoms has been reduced to the micrometer scale by realizing magnetic microtraps on dielectric substrates using standard microelectronic fabrication techniques .",

    "enables tight traps with low power consumption , and may enable a new tool for fundamental studies as well as numerous applications such as clocks , sensors and quantum information processing .",
    "however , as the atoms approach the dielectric or metallic surface , they are perturbed by atom - surface interactions and by temporal and spatial magnetic field fluctuations . on the one hand , this enables surface microscopy studies using ultra - cold atoms  @xcite and studies of dispersion forces , including the  interaction  @xcite , but on the other hand this destroys atomic coherence and introduces heating , trap loss and potential corrugation  @xcite .",
    "there have been many suggestions for ways to overcome these limiting processes and experiments to quantify their success  @xcite .",
    "a recent proposal suggests that using electrically anisotropic materials can help reduce decoherence due to the nearby surface  @xcite .",
    "another proposal is to employ metallic alloys at cryogenic temperatures to improve the lifetime of the trapped atomic samples  @xcite .",
    "utilizing superconducting wires in atomchips  @xcite may suppress some of the hindering effects noted above .",
    "such wires have recently been used to achieve bose - einstein condensation  @xcite , to trap ultra - cold atoms using persistent currents  @xcite , and to study the meissner state  @xcite .",
    "long  cnt , grown on an  sio@xmath0 layer and electrically connected with  pd wires ( @xmath1  wide @xmath2  thick ) .",
    "we have verified that the currents used for the simulations described in this work are sustainable for the repeated cycling required by atomchip experiments .",
    "[ fig : cnt_el],scaledwidth=35.0% ]    it has also been suggested that suspended carbon nanotubes  ( cnts ) could prove to be advantageous for trapping ultra - cold atoms  @xcite .",
    "in particular , these authors investigated suspended  cnts in order to examine the feasibility of trapping cold atoms much closer than  @xmath1 from the  cnt ; since nearby surfaces were excluded , only the atom - nanotube  force needed consideration . for a  cnt lying directly on a dielectric surface and not suspended above it ,",
    "the  force becomes much stronger because of the much larger surface area of the nearby substrate .",
    "this attractive force can destroy the atom trap by inducing tunneling through the magnetic potential barrier created by the current flowing through the  cnt .",
    "nevertheless , since  cnts grown on surfaces can carry higher currents and utilize simpler fabrication procedures , it is exactly this system for which we study the feasibility of trapping cold atoms at sub - micron distances .",
    "we also use accurate  calculations for atomic densities in order to fully estimate their trapping capabilities .    the motivation to trap cold atoms close to a  cnt ranges from improving atom optics technology to fundamental studies of  cnts .",
    "the first motivation relates to the goal of creating a trap hundreds of nanometers from the surface _ en route _ to a real solid - state device with long coherence times  @xcite .",
    "such traps would enable high resolution manipulations of the external degrees of freedom (  creation of controllable tunneling barriers ) , high gradient traps with low power consumption , and small inter - trap distances for atom - atom entanglement (  for creating 2-qubit gates ) . achieving this goal",
    "may be hindered by the  force that attracts atoms to the surface at short distances , and by thermal noise that causes the atoms to undergo spin flips , heating , and decoherence , all of which may be reduced by using  cnts  @xcite .",
    "cnts may also offer less magnetic potential corrugation due to their ballistic transport of electrons  @xcite .",
    "in addition , when integrated with high - q photonics , cnts offer sharp absorption peaks ( relative to metals ) allowing resonator modes to be positioned in their vicinity .",
    "another possible advantage lies in the ability of  cnts to form mechanical oscillators , thus providing coupling between a cold atom and a macroscopic device  @xcite . finally , in the longer term , cnts open the door to combining the field of atomchips with molecular electronics and self - assembled circuits .",
    "the second motivation relates to the atoms sensitivity to current corrugation  @xcite and electron thermally induced currents  @xcite .",
    "this may enable experimental insight into the rich phenomena of electron transport in  cnts and quantum effects such as orbiting electrons  @xcite and spin - orbit coupling  @xcite .",
    "for example , measurements of the trap lifetime ( limited by thermal  cnt noise - induced spin flips ) will readily verify whether the standard theory for thermal magnetic noise in metals  @xcite is applicable to  cnts . in addition , the atoms may serve as a probe for forces such as  @xcite and may therefore probe the forces induced by the  cnt .",
    "in this paper we present a realistic scheme , based entirely on procedures available in atomchip fabrication facilities , for building and testing a single - wall  cnt atom trap .",
    "this will hopefully provide a first step in a practical effort eventually leading to much more complex geometries , including multi - wall cnt contacts with no need for metallic contacts in the vicinity of the atom trap  @xcite , arrays of cnts  @xcite , and hopefully even deterministic growth or positioning of cnts on atomchips  @xcite .",
    "this feasibility study utilizes single - wall  cnts grown directly onto a dielectric substrate and contacted by metal leads .",
    "we find that this configuration demands simpler fabrication , and as noted earlier , it will enable more complex geometries and larger currents than those possible for suspended nanotubes  @xcite .",
    "for example , to the best of our knowledge , the maximum current thus far achieved for suspended  cnts of length  @xmath3 is  @xmath4  @xcite , compared to  @xmath5 ( @xmath6 ) and  @xmath7 ( @xmath8 ) for surface - grown cnts  @xcite . to verify simplicity in fabrication ,",

    "a separate bias field  ( @xmath20 ) directed parallel to the nanotube axis allows adjustment of the magnetic field at the trap minimum ( the ioffe - pritchard field  @xmath21 ) , which is important for limiting the majorana spin - flip rate ( sec .",

    "the bias fields can be achieved by wires positioned on the lower chip of a double - layered chip design  @xcite , an example of which is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : atomchip_schematic ] .",
    "the vertical separation is necessitated by the fact that the magnetic field component parallel to the atomchip surface vanishes at the height of the wires producing it , so the  @xmath20 and  @xmath19 bias fields that are required very close to the  cnt can not be created by wires placed in the same vertical plane .",
    "we use the double - layer configuration to simulate realistic bias fields .",
    "these fields are nearly homogeneous close to the cnt trap minimum but they are not as uniform as fields provided by external coils ; we do not use the latter however , because the nanotube magnetic trap requires bias fields about three orders of magnitude smaller than typical bias fields .",

    "nanotube magnetic guides are expected to enable very strong confinement in the transverse direction when atoms are brought nearby  @xcite . at the same time however , the  short - range attractive force  @xcite limits how close the atoms may approach the  cnt without being lost to it by tunneling through the magnetic potential barrier created by the current through the  cnt .",
    "the trap gradient increases when atoms are brought closer to the  cnt , but the barrier height is reduced . in our case , where we have chosen the simplest configuration in which the  cnt is not suspended , atoms approaching the  cnt also feel the  force due to the substrate surface . throughout this paper",

    "the  cp potential is dominated by  si for large  @xmath23 ( @xmath29 ) , while for small  @xmath23 the potential is dominated by the thin  sio@xmath0 layer . for the intermediate values of  @xmath23 needed here",

    "it is evident that optimizing  @xmath16 to obtain the deepest trap requires balancing the potential barrier at low heights  @xmath23 with the barrier at large  @xmath23 that is provided by the bias field  @xmath19 . to find this balance accurately",
    ", we must also consider the trap shape , two examples of which are shown by the isopotential surfaces in fig .",

    "these escape routes are most efficiently blocked by two balanced barriers at a trap height of  @xmath51 , where the two curves of fig .  [",
    "fig : at_pot](c ) intersect .",
    "this height then corresponds to the deepest possible trap of  @xmath52 for the present configuration , which in turn optimizes the number of atoms that can be held in the trap , as discussed in the following section .",
    "the ground state  @xmath53 of  @xmath54 interacting bosons in an external potential is given by the  equation  @xcite : @xmath55\\psi(\\mathbf{r})=\\mu\\psi(\\mathbf{r}),\\ ] ] where  @xmath56 is the atomic mass ,  @xmath57 is the external potential ,  @xmath58 the chemical potential , and  @xmath59 is the coupling constant , with  @xmath60 being the _ s_-wave scattering length ( @xmath61 for  @xmath9 ) .    for systems with a `` large '' number of interacting atoms , one often uses the thomas - fermi approximation  @xcite .",
    "as an example , for  275 atoms in a  @xmath12-long nanotube trap , this approximation underestimates the chemical potential by  @xmath62 and the corresponding wavefunction is  @xmath63 more confined in the transverse direction ( at  10% of the peak probability ) than the  wavefunction .",
    "we therefore solve the full  equation for the atomic density calculations throughout this study .",
    "for a given number of atoms in the  cnt trap , these solutions yield a ground state energy , which can be expressed as a fraction of the trap depth .",
    "conversely , fixing the ratio of the trap depth to the ground state energy determines the number of atoms  @xmath54 that may be held by any particular  cnt trap .",
    "we fix this ratio at  @xmath64 for all the  calculations discussed in this paper in order to ensure adequate trapping .",

    "taking the current , bias field , and trap frequency of our  @xmath12-long nanotube trap operating at  @xmath5 ( table  [ tbl : length_dependence ] ) , we calculate a heating rate of @xmath129 . even for the shortest , highest - frequency traps considered , we calculate @xmath130 and",
    "we conclude that heating due to technical noise is not expected to limit the experimental lifetime .",
    "note that these calculated heating rates are significantly smaller than previously measured rates  @xcite , as the technical noise here is limited to the shot - noise level because of the low current and high resistance of the  cnt .     through",
    "the gold  `` z''-wire only ( the `` loading '' trap ) , and due to the `` combined '' trap , which has in addition a  @xmath5 current flowing through a  @xmath12-long nanotube .",
    "both trap minima are  @xmath131 from the surface .",
    "the nanotube current creates a much higher potential barrier for the combined trap as well as generating tighter confinement .",
    "( b )  potential isosurface for the combined trap at an energy of  @xmath132 using the above currents , demonstrating how the combined  cnt trap `` pinches off '' the atom density directly above the nanotube contacts and isolates it from the atomchip surface .",
    "[ fig : pinching],scaledwidth=45.0% ]",
    "as part of this feasibility study , we also wish to analyze the loading of the  cnt trap .",
    "transferring atoms from one magnetic trap to another requires optimization of bias fields and gradients such that the atom transfer is adiabatic ,  the heating due to the transfer process is minimal . in experimental language",
    "this transfer is nearly adiabatic if the two traps are `` mode - matched ''  @xcite ,  that the frequencies and position of the traps must be similar and the change of the magnetic field gradients should be such that atoms are not driven into collective oscillation .",
    "loading of the  cnt trap refers to the final transfer of atoms from a standard gold wire trap to the  cnt wire trap . here , we make use of the simple gold `` z''-shaped wire located  @xmath22 directly below the  cnt on the lower layer of the atomchip ( fig .  [",
    "fig : atomchip_schematic ] ) . by applying a bias field perpendicular to the wire , a magnetic `` loading '' trap",
    "is created from which atoms can be transferred into the  cnt trap . at the beginning of the sequence ,",
    "the loading trap is deep and relatively far from the atomchip surface , and current through the  cnt does not influence the trap . as we gradually move the loading trap closer to the nanotube by increasing the applied bias field , the magnetic field gradient increases , enabling `` mode - matched '' conditions .",
    "the trap gets shallower as the loading trap is brought closer to the atomchip surface ,  from  350 to  @xmath133 as the trap minimum position is decreased from  50 to  @xmath134 from the nanotube  ( 150 to  @xmath135 from the gold `` z''-wire ) . such a trap can still hold thermal atoms .",
    "below  @xmath1 however , the barrier height for the loading trap is reduced to  @xmath136 by the  potential , as seen in fig .  [",
    "fig : pinching](a ) . to overcome this problem",
    "we create a `` combined '' trap by running a current through the  cnt simultaneously . at these close distances ,",
    "a current of  @xmath5 in the  cnt is sufficient to increase the barrier height of the combined potential to  @xmath137 , thus providing a good shield against tunneling .",
    "consequently , atoms that are immediately above the nanotube will be trapped as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : pinching](b ) while the remainder , originally trapped by the ( longer ) gold `` z''-wire , will be lost to the surface .",
    "the effect of the  cnt in the combined trap is to `` pinch off '' the atomic cloud directly above the nanotube contacts , thus isolating its central portion from surface depletion .",
    "once this isolation is achieved , current in the gold `` z''-wire can be turned off , leaving the atoms trapped by the magnetic field generated only by the nanotube .    finally ,",
    "after some trapping time , the atoms should be detectable .",
    "this could be accomplished using highly sensitive micro - cavity  @xcite , micro - disc  @xcite , or fiber - based fluorescence  @xcite techniques . in this feasibility study",
    "however , we focus on simple resonant absorption imaging using external optical elements in order to avoid further fabrication on the  cnt atomchip ( although , if required , this can indeed be done ) .    given the typical spatial resolution of absorption imaging , we need to release the cloud from the  cnt trap and allow it to drop ( due to gravity ) and expand .",
    "the cloud should drop far enough that the imaging laser beam will not be diffracted from the surface ( @xmath138 ) , and the cloud should expand sufficiently for it to be observable with modest resolution ( @xmath139 ) without losing too much optical density ( @xmath140 ) .",
    "these conditions are satisfied within  @xmath141 time - of - flight , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : imaging ] .",
    "trap release may be initiated by turning off all the magnetic fields and the  cnt current . however ,",
    "if the magnetic force is turned off completely , the strong  force would overcome gravity for portions of the cloud that are released too close to the surface [ fig  [ fig : imaging](a ) ] . while adiabatic de - loading of the magnetic trap is possible  @xcite , we consider instead ejecting all the atoms by turning off the  @xmath19 and @xmath20 bias fields , thereby applying a magnetic gradient due to the current still passing through the  cnt .",
    "as both  @xmath21 and the  cnt field give rise to a larmor frequency of only a few tens of  khz , one should take care to close the fields sufficiently slowly to avoid spin flips to high - field seeking states . in early stages of the trap release , the bias fields are therefore turned off gradually while the magnetic field generated by the nanotube is still on .",
    "this creates a magnetic potential which is still trapping , but with reduced frequencies and which is moving progressively further from the atomchip , thereby repelling the atom cloud .",
    "once the bias fields are turned off completely , the net force acting on the center of mass of the cloud is the sum of the attractive  force @xmath142 dragging atoms toward the surface , the magnetic gradient force @xmath143 repelling the atoms from the nanotube , and the gravitational force @xmath144 , also directed away from the atomchip surface .",
    "the resulting equation for the center - of - mass motion is @xmath145    we solve the above differential equation classically for two cases , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : imaging](a ) .",
    "we first consider atoms under the influence of gravity and the  force , but exclude the magnetic gradient . in this case , for atom - surface distances closer than the position of unstable equilibrium  @xmath146 , defined by the condition @xmath147 , the net force exerted on the released atomic cloud is directed towards the chip surface . as a result",
    ", atoms released with  @xmath148 will collide with the atomchip unless we retain the magnetic gradient .",
    "we therefore also solve eq .",
    "( [ eq : z(t)-kick ] ) with all three potential terms . in order to evaluate how different parts of the cloud move",
    ", we assume a range of initial positions around the trap center at  @xmath149 .",
    "the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : imaging](a ) shows that part of a cloud initially trapped at the cloud center would be lost to the surface because of the  force .",
    "in contrast , the main part of the figure shows that retaining the magnetic gradient prevents any part of the cloud from being attracted to the surface , and very effectively accelerates the atoms downwards , away from the atomchip .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : imaging](b ) we consider the expansion of a cloud of interacting atoms .",
    "the cloud expansion is calculated by solving the time - dependent  equation for a trapping potential whose frequencies are reduced exponentially as discussed above .",
    "this expansion is superimposed on the motion of the center of mass , which is solved classically as shown in the main panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : imaging](a ) . by turning the trapping potential off gradually ,",
    "the cloud expansion is reduced compared to the case where the potential is turned off suddenly .",
    "this helps to retain a higher optical density over longer times , allowing the cloud to further separate from the atomchip for detection .",
    "in this work we have shown that trapping of ultra - cold atoms above surface - grown single - wall carbon nanotubes is feasible with standard  cnt fabrication techniques and electrical parameters .",
    "the number of atoms that can be trapped increases with the length of the nanotube and the current passed through it and can reach several thousand for nanotubes longer than  @xmath150 .",
    "we have also shown how a practical two - layer cnt - based atomchip may be constructed and how the ultra - cold atoms can be transferred from a conventional magnetic trap to the  cnt trap .",
    "several types of trap losses were considered .",
    "trap properties were chosen to ensure a majorana spin - flip loss rate of  @xmath87 at a trap center distance of  @xmath131 , slow enough to allow experimental confirmation of atom trapping , again using practical elements of the atomchip design .",
    "under these conditions we found that all other trap loss mechanisms are even slower , including tunneling to the atomchip surface , thermal noise - induced spin flips , and heating effects .      the results of this study should allow the development and testing of cnt - based atomchip traps and the investigation of their properties , including the unique smoothness and electronic characteristics of  cnts , and perhaps detailed studies of current flow in  cnt contacts .",
    "a successful realization of a  cnt atom trap may open the road to numerous improvements of the atomchip including reduced potential corrugation , lower levels of spin flip and decoherence , less destructive absorption near cavity modes thereby facilitating on - chip optical micro - cavities , and , for suspended  cnts , reduced  forces and coupling of atoms to mechanical resonators .",
