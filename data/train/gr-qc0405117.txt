    "in the context of inflationary cosmology , initial seeds of today s structures are generated in the de - sitter phase of an inflationary universe , as a consequence of quantum vacuum fluctuations ( see e.g. @xcite for a comprehensive overview of the theory of cosmological fluctuations and @xcite for a recent introductory overview ) . the standard way of analyzing these fluctuations is through linear perturbation theory .",
    "however , the linear analyses is limited by the non - linear nature of the einstein equations , and in particular , the presence of perturbations is likely to affect the evolution of the background cosmology at the non - linear level .",
    "the back reaction of short wavelength gravity waves on an expanding friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) cosmology is a well - understood problem @xcite .",
    "however , in the context of inflationary and post - inflationary cosmology , the scalar metric fluctuations ( fluctuations coupled to energy density and pressure perturbations ) are believed to dominate over the effects of gravity waves , and thus , it is of great interest to understand the possible back reaction of these scalar perturbations on the cosmological background .",
    "furthermore , during inflation , the phase space of infrared modes ( defined as modes with wavelength greater than the hubble radius ) grows exponentially , whereas the phase space of the ultraviolet modes does not grow and since the amplitude of the associated metric fluctuations of these infrared modes does _ not _ decrease in time , the back reaction of these infrared modes may grow to be significant .",
    "there have been different approaches to address this question . in @xcite ,",
    "the effective energy - momentum tensor formalism of @xcite was generalized to study the back reaction of infrared modes on the spatially homogeneous component of the metric .",
    "the result was that , in a slow - roll inflationary background , the back reaction of infrared modes takes the form of a negative cosmological constant .",
    "this was later confirmed in @xcite using very different techniques .",
    "the objections ( see @xcite ) to these analyses are mainly concerned with the fact that @xcite do not consider a local observable quantity , and even if the effect is not simply a gauge artifact , it is still not clear how a local observer could distinguish the back reaction of long - wavelength modes from an initial condition ambiguity in a homogenous universe . more importantly , calculating an `` observable '' from the spatially averaged metric",
    "will not in general give the same result as calculating the spatially averaged value of the observable . a later work by abramo and woodard in @xcite tried to resolve this problem by identifying a local physical variable which describes expansion rate of the universe , then calculating the back reaction of cosmological perturbations on this quantity .",
    "a different approach was introduced in @xcite , where a simple variable describing the local expansion rate was considered and calculated up to second order in the metric fluctuations in a model with a single inflation field . in this approach ,",
    "the leading contribution of back reaction of infrared modes to this variable was evaluated . when evaluated at a fixed value of the matter field @xmath0 , the only physical clock available in this simple system",
    ", the dependence of the expansion rate on the clock time takes on exactly the same form as in an unperturbed background .",
    "thus , the leading infrared back reaction terms had no locally measurable effect in this system .",
    "similar conclusions were reached in @xcite .    however , the fact that during inflation the phase space of infrared modes is growing in time , i.e. modes are exiting the hubble radius , leads us to the conjecture that there might be a locally measurable effect just due to these crossings , and if we include the corrections due this effect , the results for single scalar field models may change .",
    "since these modes are generated in the quantum mechanical ultraviolet limit , handling them in general is very difficult .",
    "attempts , so far , in order to model the evolution through writing a classical langevin - like equation for the coarse - grained scaler field , the so - called _ stochastic approach _",
    "@xcite , fail to include the inflaton and metric fluctuations self - consistently . in this work ,",
    "for the first time , we devise a self - consistent stochastic framework to study the evolution of the coarse - grained inflaton .",
    "while the approach uses the results of linear ( metric+inflaton ) perturbation theory for the ultraviolet and transitional modes , it is rigorously extended to the _ non - linear _ infrared regime , which allows a consistent study of the evolution of fluctuations through their entire history .",
    "we then apply this framework to the problem of back reaction in inflationary cosmology , and investigate how / when the non - linear effects may change properties / predictions of the standard slow - roll inflation .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows : in section ii , we explain how the linear theory of perturbations can be self - consistently generalized to the non - linear infrared regime , including both inflaton and metric fluctuations .",
    "we also introduce @xmath1 , the local expansion rate , and how it is related to metric perturbations . in sec .",
    "iii , we show that the quantum generation of fluctuations can be modelled as a stochastic term in the equation of motion for @xmath1 , coarse - grained over local hubble patches . in sec .",
    "iv , we apply this equation to a chaotic inflationary scenario with a quadratic potential @xmath2 and evaluate the local expansion rate with back reaction corrections due to infrared modes .",
    "v contains the generalization of the result from sec .",
    "iv to any power - law potential . in sec .",
    "vi , we investigate if back reaction can ever significantly change the inflationary predictions for our observable universe .",
    "finally , sec .",
    "vii summarizes our results and concludes the paper . throughout this paper",
    ", we use the natural units , and set the planck mass equal to unity , i.e. @xmath3 .",
    "our analysis is based on the consistent quantization of the linearized metric and matter perturbations in a classical expanding background space - time . in this framework",
    ", it can be shown that , in the linear regime , the sasaki - mukhanov parameter @xmath4 @xcite , defined as : , the hubble expansion rate by @xmath5 , and the scalar matter field by @xmath0 . ] @xmath6 \\ , = \\ ,   \\frac{a\\dot{\\varphi}}{h}\\zeta,\\ ] ] obeys the equation of motion of a free scalar field , on scales much smaller than the hubble radius . here",

    "this ansatz , though not a general solution , represents the most important sector of the metric , as any such metric can be continuously connected to a metric with linear scalar perturbations , which is the dominant sector if perturbations are generated during slow - roll inflation @xcite .",
    "we consider the simplest model of matter with a single scalar field @xmath0 , the inflaton .",
    "we also use a perfect fluid model to describe the expansion of the universe .",

    "( [ eqnquad ] ) , we note that @xmath61 is simply the expansion rate in the absence of perturbations , @xmath64 where our convention for @xmath18 is so that it has a negative initial value @xmath65 and goes to zero towards the end of inflation , so that @xmath1 decreases as inflation proceeds .",
    "now we substitute @xmath61 back into eq .",
    "( [ eqnquad ] ) to find @xmath66 , @xmath67 this step is easily followed by calculation of @xmath63 .",
    "@xmath68 since @xmath54 is a random gaussian variable , we are not interested in the spontaneous value of @xmath1 , and instead investigate the statistical behavior of @xmath69 , the expectation value of the expansion rate over time as more infrared modes cross the hubble radius and may build up a back reaction effect .",
    "as @xmath61 does not have a @xmath54 term , and the expectation value of @xmath62 vanishes over time , we have : @xmath70 where @xmath71 can be derived from eqs .",
    "( [ theta2 ] ) and ( [ xi2 ] ) , which finally enables us to calculate expansion rate with corrections due to stochastic back reaction : @xmath72    contrary to our expectation from @xcite , we can see that the back reaction term has a positive value and it is increasing with time , as if it is speeding up inflation .",
    "however , as we see in the next section , this is merely a result of our choice to average over hyper - surfaces of constant _ proper _ time , while other choices of time hyper - surfaces may lead to different forms , or even a different sign , for the back reaction term .    nevertheless , as both @xmath1 and @xmath18 are observable",
    ", we may conclude that the back reaction _ does not vanish _ during inflation and",
    "since its magnitude is increasing with time , it may become important if inflation lasts long enough .",
    "notice that this correction is , in fact , due to wavelengths larger than the hubble radius as , using eq .",
    "( [ theta2 ] ) , @xmath71 could be expressed as an integral over @xmath36 , the wave number instead of @xmath18 , which would yield @xmath73 and the above integral is only over modes which have already crossed the hubble radius . in this sense , this is an infrared back reaction effect .",
    "in this section , we generalize the calculations of the last section to power law inflaton potentials .",
    "also , rather than proper time , we use the inflationary e - folding number as our time variable , as it has more direct and intuitive observational relevance . the number of e - foldings since the beginning of inflation is @xmath74    using eq .",
    "( [ thetapsi ] ) , we can see that @xmath75 may be used as a measure of e - folding : @xmath76 and thus , in order to find how @xmath1 changes as a function of @xmath77 , it is sufficient to express it in terms of @xmath75 . combining eq .",

    "( [ maineqn2 ] ) can be solved to obtain @xmath1 in terms of @xmath75 : @xmath82    note that we assumed @xmath83 towards the end of inflation .",
    "the result may be simplified for the case of a quadratic potential : @xmath84    we see that , if averaged over the hyper - surfaces of constant e - folding rather than constant proper time , the second order back reaction has a negative sign , i.e. it slows down inflation .",
    "we again believe that this is a real effect , as both @xmath1 and @xmath77 are observable parameters .",
    "let us calculate the ratio of the second order term in eq .",
    "( [ backp ] ) to the zeroth order term @xmath85 if @xmath86 , close to the end of inflation . currently , the most stringent constraints on the inflationary potential is due to the observations of the cosmic microwave background anisotropies by the wmap satellite @xcite .",
    "the observed amplitude of anisotropies at the observable horizon scale require : @xmath87 with @xmath88 being the derivative of @xmath89 with respect to @xmath0 .",

    "( [ ratio ] ) can be expressed in terms of @xmath94 : @xmath95    although , this result is specific to the power law inflaton potentials , we expect a similar order of magnitude for any smooth potential that is consistent with observational bounds",
    ".    does this mean that back reaction will always be negligible during inflation ?",
    "of course , the number of e - foldings , @xmath77 , could be arbitrarily large .",
    "indeed , after enough e - foldings , we end up with the self - similar chaotic inflationary picture which results from the stochastic formulation @xcite .",
    "however , only @xmath96 of these e - foldings could fit in our local hubble patch today , and any effect on the power spectrum due to the back reaction of the super - hubble modes is inaccessible to observations .",
    "another possibility is that the inflaton potential may not be smooth .",
    "the observational bounds on @xmath90 hold from the observable horizon ( @xmath97 ) down to the scale of the lyman-@xmath14 forest ( @xmath98 ) @xcite , constraining only about 10 e - foldings in the inflaton potential .",
    "an unusually flat portion in the inflaton potential ( see fig . [ signal ] ) may yield a significantly larger amplitude of fluctuations , e.g. @xmath99 , and be inaccessible to cosmological observations if it happens at small enough scales .",
    "however , such a large amplitude may result in the production of primordial black holes ( pbhs ) , as the modes enter the hubble radius , which results in further constraints on @xmath94 .    to study the production of pbhs @xcite ,",

    "thus may form pbhs , where @xmath108 is given by @xmath110    \\frac{d\\zeta}{\\sqrt{2\\pi \\delta^2_{\\cal r } } }   \\sim \\delta_{\\cal r } \\exp[-\\delta^{-2}_{\\cal r}/2].\\ ] ]    the current density in pbhs in units of the critical density , @xmath111 , is given by @xmath112 where @xmath113 , is the fraction of the mass in a hubble patch that goes into the pbh @xcite . requiring that @xmath114 yields @xmath115 for @xmath116 , eq . ( [ ff ] ) gives @xmath117 , and thus eq .",
    "( [ omega ] ) , in combination with large scale structure observations , require @xmath118    other astrophysical observations may put tighter constraints on a population of pbhs in the universe @xcite . instead of going through these constraints ,",
    "let us give an example .",

    "this is consistent with current astrophysical constraints on such objects @xcite .    to summarize this section",
    ", we showed that if we assume a smooth inflaton potential , in single matter field models infrared back reaction ( during the last 70 e - foldings of inflation ) should be negligible , at least to the 2nd order ( one loop ) in the amplitude of perturbations .",
    "however , if we relax this assumption , it is possible to construct an inflaton potential that allows a significant back reaction effect during the slow - roll inflationary period , without breaking any observational constraints .",
    "we use a stochastic coarse - graining method to approach the problem of infrared back reaction in a single scalar field inflationary cosmology . using the coarse - grained generalized bardeen parameter ,",
    "we self - consistently derive the stochastic langevin equation that governs the evolution of the local expansion rate . solving this equation to second order ( one loop ) for chaotic inflation with a power law potential",
    ", we see that there is a non - vanishing average back reaction term due to the infrared modes that have left the hubble radius .",
    "although , the size of this effect will be negligible ( within the observable universe ) for smooth inflaton potentials , we show that it is possible to have non - smooth potentials which allow significant back reaction happening on sub - horizon scales , without breaking any observational constraints .",
    "a possible implication of such non - smooth potentials is the generation of a population of massive primordial black holes , which could be further used to constrain or verify these models .",
