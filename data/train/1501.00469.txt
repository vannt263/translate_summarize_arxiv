    "this paper is about hard thermal loop ( htl ) amplitudes in finite temperature quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) .",
    "this has been the subject of many investigations not only in qed but also in non - abelian gauge theories and gravity .",
    "these htl amplitudes have loop momenta of the order of the temperature , @xmath0 , which is considered large compared with all the external momenta . in the case of non - abelian gauge field theories ,",
    "it is possible to sum all the amplitudes in terms of a closed form expression for the effective action @xcite .",
    "similarly , in gravity , closed form expressions for the static and the long wavelenght limits of the effective action have been obtained @xcite .",
    "the main motivation for these investigations is the search for a consistent thermal field theory in the perturbative regime .",
    "it is well known that the thermal effective action in qed has a leading temperature behavior proportional to @xmath1 which arises only from the contribution of the photon polarization tensor .",
    "all the other thermal amplitudes are either subleading or they vanish as a consequence of the neutrality of the plasma . on the other hand , it is also known that the htl amplitudes can be generated using the boltzmann transport equation .",
    "this approach has been used in scalar , non - abelian gauge theories and gravity @xcite .",
    "when we adopt the boltzmann transport equation approach , in the case of qed , we realize that there is ground for considering some more general possibilities for the thermal amplitudes ( although restricted to the semiclassical limit ) .",
    "first , since the plasma does not need to be neutral , amplitudes with an odd number of external photons can be generated .",
    "second , amplitudes which are not simply proportional to a power of @xmath0 ( like the @xmath1 behavior of the two - photon amplitude ) are also generated .",
    "( this is the key distinction between the non - abelian and abelian theories , since in the former , each amplitude generated by the boltzmann transport equation formalism is proportional to the same power of @xmath0 . ) furthermore , all these contributions are generated from a manifestly gauge invariant effective action , simply because , as we will see , the boltzmann transport equation formalism yields an effective action which is expressed in terms of the electromagnetic field tensor @xmath2 .",
    "however , it is not known if the same @xmath3-photon amplitudes can also be obtained from a first principle approach , like qed at finite temperature .",
    "our main goal in the present work is to investigate this issue using the imaginary time formalism @xcite .",
    "the main motivation of this investigation is to extend the concept of htl amplitudes including all the contributions which arise from the boltzmann transport equation approach .",
    "in fact , considering that the boltzmann transport equation formalism is a classical limit , it is important to understand how it relates with the high temperature limit of qed at finite temperature . as a first step toward this goal , we investigate in the present paper the @xmath3-photon amplitudes in both formalisms .    in the next section ,",
    "we review the boltzmann transport equation approach and derive the effective action and the corresponding thermal amplitudes .",
    "we obtain an implicit expression for all the thermal amplitudes and compute some explicit examples . in sec .",
    "[ sec3 ] we consider the thermal green s functions in qed at finite temperature .",
    "we review how the thermal green s functions can be expressed in terms of forward scattering amplitudes .",
    "then , using the htl limit , we argue that the leading behavior of each of these forward scattering amplitudes agrees with the results obtained in sec .",
    "the agreement is explicitly verified up to the four photon function . finally , in sec .",
    "[ sec4 ] we discuss the main results .",
    "let us consider the semiclassical description of a qed plasma in terms of a distribution @xmath4 where @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the four - vectors of position and momenta .",
    "the dirac delta and theta functions impose the conditions @xmath7 for on - shell , positive energy , particles of charge @xmath8 and mass @xmath9 .",
    "let us now assume that the collisions between the particles are neglectable . then ,",
    "when an external electromagnetic field is present , the trajectory followed by the particles is determined by the equations of motion @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the electromagnetic field tensor and @xmath12 is the proper time . as a result , the distribution function satisfies the equation @xmath13 we remark that the right - hand side of the previous equation does not vanish when the effect of collisions is taken into account . using eqs .",
    ", we obtain the boltzmann transport equation @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the partial derivative in relation to the four momentum @xmath16 and we have defined @xmath17 this covariant form of the boltzmann transport equation has been previously obtained in more general cases of non - abelian gauge fields and also noncommutative gauge theories @xcite .",
    "let us now consider the current which is produced when the plasma interacts with the external field .",
    "this can be expressed in terms of the distribution functions for the negative or the positive charge carriers ( e.g. positrons or electrons ) as @xmath18 where @xmath19 takes into account the degrees of freedom associated with the charged particles ( @xmath20 for an electron in 3 + 1 dimensions ) .",
    "the total current in a plasma would be given by @xmath21 of course one could think of other possible scenarios such that the net charge of the plasma does not vanish .",
    "for this reason , it is convenient to consider @xmath22 separately .    if we now perform the replacement @xmath23 in eq . , we obtain @xmath24 on the other hand , if we make @xmath25 we get @xmath26 this shows that we can choose @xmath27",
    ". therefore we can , alternatively , express eq .",
    "as @xmath28 so that the charge conjugation is equivalent to reversing the sign of the thermal particle momentum .",
    "let us now consider the general relation that must exist between the current and the thermal effective action of electromagnetic fields interacting with a thermal plasma .",
    "this relation can be simply written as @xmath29 where we have made explicit the dependence of @xmath30 on the external field @xmath31 , which follows from the substitution of the solution of eq . into eq . .",
    "in the most trivial scenario , when the external field is switched off , and the system is in thermal equilibrium , eq . is satisfied by @xmath32 the equilibrium distribution @xmath33 depends on the statistics of the particles . in the case of electrons and positrons @xmath34 which is the fermi - dirac distribution ( for our present purposes @xmath33 could be any @xmath35-independent distribution ) .",
    "then , the partial currents are given by @xmath36 and the corresponding effective actions are @xmath37 introducing the four - vector @xmath38 , we can write @xmath39 where @xmath40 denotes the integration over the directions of @xmath41 and we have introduced the integration operator @xmath42 which operates on functions of @xmath43 .",
    "( together with the powers of the temperature , @xmath44 give the full temperature dependence for the contribution of order @xmath3 ) .",
    "since @xmath45 , we finally obtain @xmath46 of course , in the case of a neutral plasma , the sum of the two partial contributions vanishes @xmath47 as we will see this simple property will remain true for all odd powers of the external field ( see eq . ) .    in the presence of a general external field ,",
    "the solution of the boltzmann transport equation can be quite involved .",
    "here we consider external field configurations which can be dealt with using a perturbative approach . in these cases a formal solution of the eq . can be written as @xmath48 so that each @xmath49 is of order @xmath3 in powers of the external field and the complete phase space distribution can be expressed as @xmath50 . it is convenient to write eq . in a more explicitly iterative fashion as @xmath51 where @xmath52 . from these solutions , and using eqs . and",
    ", we can obtain the corresponding partial effective actions , defined order by order in terms of the phase space distributions , as follows @xmath53 in principle , the effective action is completely determined by this direct procedure starting from the knowledge of @xmath54 , which can be chosen , for instance , as given by eqs . and .",
    "the nontrivial effects of the external field interacting with the plasma will be manifest when we consider the second or higher order contributions in eq .",
    "( @xmath55 ) . to derive the explicit dependence on the external field ,",
    "let us look at the details of the integrand in eq . .",
    "substituting eq . into eq .",
    "we obtain @xmath56 performing an integration by parts in the momentum integral , yields @xmath57 where the derivative of @xmath58 acting on @xmath59 produces a vanishing contribution as a consequence of the antisymmetry of the electromagnetic tensor field . performing an integration by parts in the configuration space integral and using again the antisymmetry of the electromagnetic tensor field we obtain @xmath60 ( from this result one can easily verify that , for odd @xmath3 , @xmath61 ) .",
    "this form of the effective action encodes a number of interesting features .",
    "first , since eq . is expressed directly in terms of @xmath2 ( notice that @xmath62 is implicitly dependent on @xmath63 as a solution of ) , gauge invariance is explicitly manifested at any given order .",
    "second , it is straightforward to obtain any higher order contributions by successive substitutions of eq . into eq . .",
    "these properties can be concisely summarized by expressing the external fields in terms of fourier components so that the effective actions can be written as @xmath64 where @xmath65 are the thermal amplitudes associated with the boltzmann transport equation formalism .",
    "then , from the gauge invariance of @xmath66 under @xmath67 , we conclude that the thermal amplitudes must satisfy the ward identities @xmath68 notice that in the case of non - abelian gauge theories the corresponding ward identities would relate @xmath69 with @xmath70 so that all the amplitudes would have the same leading high temperature behavior . on the other hand , in the abelian theory ,",
    "each contribution @xmath71 to the effective action is individually gauge independent and the corresponding amplitudes are not all proportional to the same power of the temperature .",
    "this can be simply understood by power counting the momentum dependence of successive terms obtained from eq . .",
    "furthermore , from the general form of eq .",
    "one can easily see that all the amplitudes will be functions of degree zero in the external momenta @xmath72 .    as an example , let us now compute the explicit form of the two - photon amplitude ( thermal self - energy ) .",
    "making @xmath73 in eq .",
    "one readily obtains @xmath74 using eqs .",
    "and @xmath75 expressing the external fields in terms of fourier components we obtain @xmath76 where @xmath77 inserting into and comparing the resulting expression with , we obtain the following result for the two - photon amplitude @xmath78 this particular example of the two - photon function illustrates the general structure of all @xmath3-photon functions , which , as we will see can be expressed in terms of an angular integral over the directions of , the integrand being a rank @xmath3 tensor which depends on @xmath79 as well as the external momenta . the same structure has been previously obtained for the leading high temperature limit of non - abelian as well as noncommutative gauge theories @xcite .",
    "iterating eq .",
    "one more time , eq . yields @xmath80 performing an integration by parts in the momentum integral , the result can be cast in the form    @xmath81    where @xmath82 + k_{\\mu_1 } k_{\\mu_2 } k_{\\mu_3 } k_{\\lambda_1 } k_{\\lambda_2 } \\eta_{\\lambda_3\\nu_3}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    it is then straightforward to obtain the three - point amplitudes .",
    "similarly to the previous cases , we now consider @xmath83 in the eq . and express the external fields in terms of fourier components .",
    "comparing the resulting expression with eq .",
    "we obtain the result @xmath84 where the explicit result for @xmath85 is given in appendix [ apa ] .",
    "using this iterative approach , we have also computed the explicit result for the four - photon amplitude .",
    "since the calculation is straightforward , but rather involved , we have made use of computer algebra .",
    "the result has been compared with the one obtained using the high temperature limit of thermal field theory , as we describe in the next section .",
    "it is clear that , in general , the iterative procedure will produce a result for the @xmath3-photon function which is proportional to @xmath86 so that each thermal amplitude has a simple temperature dependence given by the factors @xmath87 .",
    "in this section we consider the qed @xmath3-photon amplitudes in the usual thermal field theory setting @xcite .",
    "furthermore , we chose the imaginary time formalism , which , as it will be seen , is the most direct approach to obtain the thermal amplitudes in the present context . also , to fully describe a plasma under the influence of an external electromagnetic fields , the external energies in these diagrams have to be analytically continued to continuous values , after the matsubara sums have been performed .",
    "this prescription extends the imaginary time formalism to a nonequilibrium regime under the influence of external fields .",
    "let us consider the one - loop diagram , shown in fig .",
    "once we compute this basic diagram , the @xmath3-point one - particle - irreducible ( 1pi ) amplitudes can be obtained as the sum of certain permutations of the pairs @xmath88 , so that the bosonic symmetry is satisfied . in the imaginary time formalism the contribution of this basic diagram can be written as @xmath89 where    @xmath90    and we have taken into account the minus sign associated with the fermion loop .",
    "the factor @xmath91 is a shorthand notation for all the contributions to the numerator which arises , for instance , from the traces of dirac matrices and coupling constant factors .",

    "in the right - hand side of the complex plane and taking into account the poles from the denominator of eq . we obtain @xmath100 where the quantities @xmath101 denote on - shell forward scattering amplitudes , as depicted in fig .",

    "also the terms proportional to odd powers of @xmath9 vanish simply because they are proportional to the trace of an odd number of gamma matrices , which is zero when the space - time dimension is even ( in an odd - dimensional space - time there would be induced chern - simons terms proportional to the odd powers of @xmath9 ) .",

    "produce a result which is given by a cyclic permutation of the pairs @xmath88 . in this way",
    ", the final result can be expressed as the sum @xmath102 in eq . .",
    "this representation of one - loop 1pi diagrams in terms of forward scattering amplitudes of on - shell thermal particles has been derived in various other physical systems such as non - abelian gauge theories and gravity @xcite . as a result ,",
    "in all these cases it is natural to think in terms of a physical scenario where on - shell thermal particles of momentum @xmath104 are scattered by the external photons of momenta @xmath112 , @xmath113 , as advanced by barton @xcite .",
    "this is clearly in tune with the boltzmann transport equation approach of the previous section .",
    "the full contribution to the 1pi thermal green s functions can now be obtained adding all the @xmath106 permutations of the basic result in eq . .",
    "then , taking into account that @xmath114 , we can express the 1pi amplitudes as @xmath115 and the corresponding effective actions are @xmath116 ( we remark that , due to the symmetry of the basic diagram in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , the sum of the @xmath106 permutations of external legs produces completely bosonic symmetric amplitudes @xmath117 . )    in the previous section we have seen that all the effective actions have a simple temperature dependence of the form @xmath87 , as a result of eq . .",
    "on the other hand , the thermal field theory effective actions have a more complicated temperature dependence . from a physical point of view",
    ", we expect that the boltzmann transport equation approach is restricted to the high temperature limit , when the system approaches a classical limit .",
    "this indicates that in the thermal field theory description , we have to consider the limit when @xmath0 is high compared with the energy - momentum scale of the external field .",
    "this amounts to consider the so - called hard thermal loop approximation , which in turn implies that the integration in is dominated by the region where .",
    "denoting the htl limit of @xmath118 by @xmath119 , the equivalence of the two effective actions would then imply that @xmath120 in qed this is a well - known result for the leading @xmath1 contribution to the two - photon amplitude .",
    "( in the case of non - abelian gauge theories it can be proved that all the htl @xmath3-gluon functions , which have the same @xmath1 behavior , can be generated using the boltzmann transport equation approach @xcite . )",

    "next , let us consider the more interesting cases when @xmath55 . as we have seen in the previous section",
    ", the boltzmann transport equation approach produces @xmath131-photon amplitudes which are proportional to @xmath132 . on the other hand , eq",
    ". seems to yield , for each thermal amplitude , when substituted in eq .",
    ", several other terms proportional to higher powers of @xmath0 .",
    "therefore , a necessary condition to have the equivalence , is that contributions proportional to higher powers of @xmath0 should vanish .",
    "for instance , the term proportional to @xmath133 , in the two - photon function , as well as the terms proportional to @xmath133 and @xmath134 in the three - photon function , and so on , should vanish .",
    "all the contributions proportional to @xmath133 , which would contribute to , come from the first term in eq . .",
    "from the htl procedure above described , one can see that @xmath135 must have the highest degree in @xmath136 , being proportional to @xmath137   \\dots   [ k\\cdot ( p_1+p_2+p_{n-1 } ) ] }   .\\ ] ] after performing the sum over all the cyclic permutations and using momentum conservation , it is straightforward to show that the resulting expression vanishes .",
    "more formally , we have the following necessary condition for the equivalence high - temperature qed and the boltzmann transport equation formalism of the previous section .",
    "@xmath138 we remark that this is a property of individual diagrams which is true at the level of the forward scattering amplitudes ( one does not need to add the @xmath106 permutations to cancel these so - called superleading @xmath139 contributions ) .",
    "of course for a neutral plasma the sum @xmath140 would vanish trivially , since the terms which are proportional to any odd power of @xmath0 are also odd in @xmath104 .",
    "however , in the present context , it is important to check the behavior of the individual components ( for both even and odd @xmath3 ) , in order to properly compare with the boltzmann transport equation results of the previous section .    since eq .",
    "already eliminates the @xmath139 contribution to the two - photon function , only the second term in eq .",
    "may contribute to leading order , producing a @xmath1 contribution . a straightforward calculation yields ( @xmath141 and @xmath142 ) @xmath143 inserting eq .",
    "into eq . , we obtain @xmath144 comparing eq . with eq .",
    "we can see that is satisfied for @xmath145 , which is the correct result for fermions in @xmath130 dimensions .",
    "up to this point the thermal field theory calculations have been performed without using any computer algebra tool . if we go further and try to verify eq . for @xmath146",
    "the calculation starts to become much more involved .",
    "therefore , to proceed up to at least @xmath147 we have employed the feyncalc computer algebra tool @xcite .    at the three - photon order , there would be in principle contributions from @xmath148 , which would give rise to a contribution proportional to @xmath1 .",
    "this would invalidate the equivalence of the boltzmann transport equation approach with thermal field theory .",
    "however , a straightforward calculation yields @xmath149 which is manifestly antisymmetric .",
    "therefore , the sum of its permutations vanish trivially .",
    "( it is remarkable how eq .",
    "is simply related to the tensor structure of eq . . indeed ,",
    "if we contract it with @xmath150 we obtain a relation which resembles the lorentz structure of the non - abelian gauge theory , without the antisymmetric colour factor ) .",
    "we are then left with a leading contribution to the three - photon function which is of order @xmath0 as in the case of the boltzmann transport equation approach .",
    "with the help of computer algebra , the resulting expression for @xmath151 can be computed in a straightforward way . after performing the permutations of the external photon lines , we obtain complete agreement with , when using eqs . and .    the next and more interesting @xmath147-photon order can be dealt with similarly to the previous cases , although the calculation becomes much more involved .",
    "a straightforward computer algebra calculation shows that , besides the cancellation of the contribution proportional to @xmath139 , the other contributions due to @xmath152 and @xmath153 also vanish after we add the permutations .",
    "finally , the remaining result is also in agreement with as in the previous cases .",
    "this shows that , up to the four - photon order , we have full agreement with the boltzmann transport equation approach .",
    "the previous results show that equivalence between thermal field theory and the boltzmann transport equation approach is verified at the level of the forward scattering amplitudes , in the htl limit , so that it is not necessary to explicitly perform the angular integrations in eq . .",
    "in this work we have investigated the equivalence between the high temperature limit of thermal field theory and the boltzmann transport equation . specifically , we have argued that both approaches produce the same @xmath3-photon thermal amplitudes .",
    "this is indicated by the general form derived for the amplitudes , as well as from the explicit calculations up to @xmath147 .",
    "furthermore , we have considered the more general cases when the plasma may not be neutral , so that the amplitudes with odd values of @xmath3 are nonvanishing .",
    "this equivalence implies that the quantities @xmath154 in eq .",
    "such that @xmath155 should vanish .",
    "only the contribution with @xmath156 can be interpreted as arising from the classical limit of finite temperature qed . on the other hand ,",
    "the @xmath157 contributions represent quantum corrections which are not described by the boltzmann transport equation .",
    "a similar equivalence is well known in the case of non - abelian gauge theories as well as gravity and also in the particular case of the two - photon amplitude in qed . in the case of non - abelian theories",
    "it has been useful in order to derive a closed form for the gauge invariant hard thermal loop effective action @xcite .",
    "our analysis shows that all the results obtained from the boltzmann transport equation can be identified with a more general htl limit of the thermal green s functions in qed .",
    "consequently , the gauge invariant effective action , rather than being proportional to a single power of the temperature , will have a more general dependence on @xmath0 as can be seen from the form of the thermal amplitudes in eq . .",
    "we remark that the electron mass is not being neglected so that the amplitudes with @xmath158 are well defined functions of @xmath159 .",
    "once the equivalence with the boltzmann transport equation is established , a full resumation of the thermal effects in qed , to all orders in the external field , would require a further investigation , taking into account the gauge invariant effective actions as given by eq . .",
    "the resulting effective action would be relevant to describe a low density plasma in an external field with frequencies which are small compared with the temperature .",
    "a similar but much more involved expression has been obtained for the four - photon amplitude , using computer algebra . in all the cases",
    "we have obtained agreement between the results derived using either the boltzmann transport equation or the high temperature limit of thermal field theory ."
