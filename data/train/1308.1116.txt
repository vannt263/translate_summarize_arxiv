    "particle accelerators are devices that propel and accelerate charged particles ( like protons ) to high speed .",

    "this energy is to make use of naturally occurring processes in the vicinity of astrophysical objects .",
    "black hole ( bh ) can behave as a particle accelerator and can accelerate the colliding particles to an unlimited cme .",
    "the cme of colliding particles can grow limitlessly in different situations , e.g. , nature of colliding particles , bh / naked singularity , modified gravity theories etc .",
    "when two particles collide near horizon , the energy grows infinitely in the cm frame because particles are infinitely blueshifted near the horizon .",
    "banados , silk and west ( 2009 ) discussed ( bsw effect ) the effect of infinite growth of energy in the cm frame due to collision of particles near the horizon .",
    "it was first studied in the locality of the kerr ( extremal ) bh and was shown that two colliding particles propelling in equatorial plane can have arbitrarily large cme near the maximal bh spin . lake ( 2010 ) explored the effect of particles collision near the horizon of the kerr ( non - extremal ) bh and obtained finite cme .",
    "grib and pavlov ( 2011 ) suggested that cme can become infinite in the non - extremal case if two scattering particles with equal masses collide close to the horizon .",
    "the bsw effect has also been studied for sen bh ( wei et al .",

    "the same authors ( 2012b ) described that the high energy collision can take place near the naked singularity of janis newmann winicor metric ( found by adding a massless scalar field in the schwarzschild bh ) , while these collisions are not present in the schwarzschild bh .",

    "liu et al . ( 2011 ) obtained arbitrarily high cme for colliding particles with non - equatorial motion near horizon of ( extremal ) kerr - newman bh .",
    "jacobson and sotirious ( 2010 ) showed that it takes an infinite time to attain infinite cme .    in this paper , we study cme by particles collision in equatorial plane for two well - known bhs .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sections * 2 * and * 3 * , we explore cme for regular bh and for charged accelerating and rotating bh near the horizon . the last section summarizes the results .",
    "this section is devoted to study the particle acceleration in a static spherically symmetric bh coupled to a non - linear electrodynamics .",
    "the general form of a regular bh is @xmath2 where @xmath3 is a @xmath4-dimensional sphere and @xmath5 ayon and garcia ( 2000 ) proposed a non - singular bh solution coupled with nonlinear electrodynamics whose line element is @xmath6 for which the electric field is @xmath7 here @xmath0 and @xmath1 are the mass and magnetic charge parameter of bh , respectively . comparing eqs.([1 ] ) and ( [ 3 ] ) , we have @xmath8 leading to @xmath9 expanding by taylor s expansion at @xmath10 , i.e. , near the center , it follows that @xmath11 the general expression is @xmath12 comparing both these equations , we obtain @xmath13 , while @xmath14 . using the condition ( joshi and patil 2012c ) , it follows that the center is non - singular",
    ". moreover , this solution asymptotically behaves as rn solution , i.e. , @xmath15 thus we can write the metric near the center as @xmath16    consider a particle exhibiting geodesic motion in a static spherically symmetric spacetime",
    ". let @xmath17 be the four velocity of the particle , which is restricted to equatorial motion @xmath18 , hence @xmath19 .",
    "thus the metric admits only two killing vectors @xmath20 and @xmath21 . using these killing vectors",
    ", we can define energy and angular momentum by @xmath22 which are interpreted as constants of motion , i.e. , energy and angular momentum are conserved throughout the motion . using eq.([1 ] ) , these quantities turn out to be @xmath23 leading to @xmath24 using normalization condition , @xmath25 , the radial component becomes @xmath26^{\\frac{1}{2}}.\\ ] ] here positive and negative signs correspond to ingoing and outgoing particles along the radial direction .",
    "we define the effective potential along radial direction as @xmath27 thus eq.([7 ] ) leads to @xmath28 the quantity @xmath29 provides the necessary condition for a particle to reach the center .",
    "when velocity is positive , particle reaches the center but it turns back for zero velocity .",
    "now we evaluate the minimum of @xmath30 graphically as shown in figure * 1*. it is observed that the curve admits a minimum at @xmath31 , which gives @xmath32 and the corresponding value of @xmath30 is @xmath33 when @xmath34 , we have @xmath35 .",
    "moreover , we see that @xmath36 and @xmath37 as @xmath38 .",
    "this implies that the function admits a zero for two values of @xmath39 , i.e. , @xmath40 for @xmath41 ( say ) and @xmath42 ( say ) , where @xmath43 and @xmath44 . in this case",
    ", the metric has its inner and outer horizons at @xmath41 and @xmath42 , respectively . for these values of mass and charge ,",
    "the inner and outer horizons are defined by @xmath45 . in this case",
    "metric corresponds to bh .",
    "the curvature invariants @xmath46 , @xmath47 and @xmath48 , yield @xmath49 , \\\\r_{2}&=&\\frac{1}{(q^{2}+r^{2})^{8}}[2q^{4}\\{18q^{8}+q^{2}r^{4}(81m^{4 } -20r^{2}-168m(q^{2}+r^{2})^{\\frac{1}{2}})-36q^{6}\\\\&\\times&(-2m^{2}+r^{2}+2m\\sqrt{q^{2}+r^{2 } } ) + r^{6}(117m^{2}+2r^{2}+30m\\sqrt{q^{2}+r^{2}})\\ } ] , \\\\k&=&\\frac{4}{(q^{2}+r^{2})^{8}}[6q^{12}+12m^{2}r^{10 } -24q^{2}r^{8}(m+\\sqrt{q^{2}+r^{2}})+q^{6}r^{4}(129m^{2}\\\\&-&44r^{2 } -192m\\sqrt{q^{2}+r^{2}})-12q^{10}(-2m^{2}+r^{2}+2m\\sqrt{q^{2}+r^{2 } } ) + 2q^{8}r^{2}\\\\&\\times&(6m^{2}+34r^{2}+15m\\sqrt{q^{2}+r^{2 } } ) + q^{4}r^{6}(105m^{2}+14r^{2}+90m\\sqrt{q^{2}+r^{2}})].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath50 , @xmath51 and @xmath52 are finite for finite values of @xmath39 which show that all of them are bounded everywhere . thus for @xmath34 , the singularities appearing in the metric are only coordinate singularities describing the existence of horizon .",
    "as all the curvature invariants are finite everywhere and as @xmath53 , which gives @xmath54 , thus for @xmath55 , we neither have horizon nor singularity . in this case , the conditions @xmath56 and @xmath57 are also satisfied .",
    "when @xmath58 , we have @xmath59 and hence both inner and outer horizons coincide . in other words , these shrink into a single horizon , i.e. , @xmath60 , which can be related to extremal bh as in the rn solution . when charge and mass satisfy the constraint @xmath61 , we obtain @xmath55 , which is the condition for the avoidance of horizon ( joshi and patil 2012c ) .",
    "thus we can avoid the singularities and event horizons .",
    "now we investigate cme of two particles having masses @xmath62 and @xmath63 . in terms of four - momentum @xmath64 ,",
    "the cme of two particles is ( liu et al . 2011 ) @xmath65 which yields @xmath66.\\ ] ] when @xmath67 , using eq.([3 ] ) , it follows that @xmath68^{\\frac{1}{2 } } [ e_{2}^{2}-(1\\\\\\label{12}&-&\\frac{2mr^{2}}{(r^{2}+q^{2})^{\\frac{3}{2}}}+ \\frac{q^{2}r^{2}}{(r^{2}+q^{2})^{2}})(1+\\frac{l_{2}^{2 } } { r^{2}})]^{\\frac{1}{2}}-\\frac{l_{1}l_{2}}{r^{2}}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for @xmath69 in eq.([8 ] ) , we have @xmath70 and hence at @xmath71 , it gives @xmath72 , which leads to @xmath73    we consider the collision of particles whose motion is along radial geodesics with conserved energy @xmath74 ( implies that the ingoing particles asymptotically approach to the center ) and angular momentum is taken to be @xmath75 ( particles reach the center ) .",
    "consequently , eq.([12 ] ) yields @xmath76 the cme depends upon the chosen location of the colliding particles .",
    "this will be maximum when the effective potential is minimum . inserting the value of @xmath77 in eq.([14 ] ) , it follows that @xmath78 this shows that the maximum cme depends on the ratio of mass and charge of the regular bh , which is large for @xmath58 .",
    "when charge is greater than mass by infinitesimally small amount , we introduce a new parameter @xmath79 as @xmath80 for @xmath81 , the cme becomes infinite , i.e. , @xmath82    when we take a collision between particles with @xmath83 and angular momentum @xmath84 moving along the same path , then @xmath85 @xmath86 since @xmath87 , therefore , the condition for @xmath88 to be real leads to @xmath89 if @xmath90 , then @xmath91 , i.e. , the particle remains at rest for @xmath71 .",
    "if @xmath92 , then @xmath88 is real , i.e. , an ingoing particle will come out as an outgoing particle either after getting bounced back or after crossing over the center .",
    "thus the cme near the extremal limits is given by @xmath93    finally , we consider the collision between an ingoing particle with finite radial velocity as well as energy say @xmath94 and particle at rest , where @xmath95 ( having energy @xmath96 and zero angular momentum ) .",
    "the cme of these colliding particles is @xmath97 for extremal limits , this leads to @xmath98 which is divergent .",
    "hence the high energy collisions are independent of horizon and singularities and can occur in the regular bh .",
    "here we investigate acceleration and particle collision in charged accelerating and rotating bhs ( non - extremal ) .",
    "plebanski and demianski ( pd ) presented a class of type d bhs known as the family of pd bhs ( plebanski and demianski 1976 ) .",
    "the general form of the metric is @xmath99 we consider a pd bh ( sharif and javed 2012 ) with zero nut parameter so that the metric is @xmath100 with @xmath101 here @xmath102 and @xmath103 represent the mass and rotation of bh respectively , while the parameters @xmath104 and @xmath105 are the electric and magnetic charges , respectively , @xmath106 represents acceleration of the bh .",
    "the rotation parameter @xmath107 in terms of @xmath103 and @xmath108 is given by @xmath109 .",
    "it is interesting to mention here that all the parameters @xmath106 , @xmath102 , @xmath104 , @xmath105 and @xmath103 vary independently but @xmath107 depends on the value of @xmath103 . for @xmath110 ,",
    "the metric reduces to the kerr - newman bh , while @xmath111 leads to c - metric . in the limit @xmath112 , this yields rn bh , while for @xmath113 , the schwarzschild bh can be obtained .",
    "the horizons are found for @xmath114 , leading to @xmath115 which is quadratic in @xmath39 with roots @xmath116 for the existence of horizon @xmath117 where @xmath118 represent the inner and outer horizons .",
