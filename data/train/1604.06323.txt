    "the hardy  littlewood inequality ( @xcite , 1934 ) is a continuation of famous works of littlewood ( @xcite , 1930 ) and bohnenblust and hille ( @xcite , 1931 ) and can be stated as follows :    * ( * ? ? ?",

    "one of the most for reaching generalizations of the hardy  littlewood inequality is the following theorem ( see also @xcite ) :    [ aaa](see albuquerque , araujo , nez , pellegrino and rueda @xcite ) let @xmath32 be a positive integer , @xmath33 and @xmath34 be positive integers such that @xmath35 if @xmath36 $ ] and @xmath37 then the following assertions are equivalent : + @xmath38 there is a constant @xmath39 such that    @xmath40    for all continuous @xmath3-linear forms @xmath41",

    "moreover , for @xmath63 , the difference between the bases in the exponential upper and lower estimates of @xmath9 is not bigger than @xmath64 ( see the figures [ one ] and [ two ] ) .    in the final section we also provide upper and lower estimates for the sharp constants @xmath65 of the real case of ( [ yh6 ] ) , showing that @xmath66 for all @xmath67 this result recovers , in particular , the optimality of the constant @xmath68 of the real case of the littlewood s @xmath69 inequality obtained in @xcite .",
