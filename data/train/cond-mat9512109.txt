    "after perturbation theory is summed , we shall see that our renormalization group recursion relations have a well - defined limit when surface tension and mass are set to zero .",

    "the topological charges @xmath107 of the disclinations can partially be cancelled by the curvature charges due to the gaussian curvature , when membranes buckle out to form a cone or a saddle surface .",

    "the coulombic interaction between disclinations can be screened by gaussian curvatures , and the disclination energies are reduced in deformable membranes due to buckling into the third dimension .",

    "the system creates and destroys disclinations to minimize its free energy , and , in the hexatic phase , it will always choose configurations in which there is no overall @xmath108 term in the energy .",
    "in flat membranes , this term can be eliminated by the condition of charge neutrality . in membranes",
    "whose shape can change , this term can also be eliminated by an average flat configuration and the condition of charge neutrality .",
    "we believe that this is the most likely scenario , however , it is not impossible that there are curved configurations with an overall unbalanced charge that manage to eliminate the @xmath109 energy . here",
    "we will consider only charge neutral configurations .",
    "local buckling may lead to different fugacities @xmath110 and @xmath111 for positive and negative disclinations .",
    "however , because of the constraint of charge neutrality , physical observables such as the free energy will depend only on the product @xmath112 .",
    "we can generalize the our charge neutral renormalization calculation to take into account an asymmetry in positive and negative disclination fugacities . using the hamiltonian in ref .",
    "@xcite with different fugacities for positive and negative disclinations @xmath113 and @xmath114 , respectively , we modify the sine - gordon model as follows : @xmath115 where @xmath116 and @xmath117 following the same renormalization scheme as above , we find the recursion relations for the bending rigidity , the hexatic rigidity , and the fugacities for positive and negative disclinations : @xmath118 @xmath119 @xmath120 defining @xmath121 and @xmath122 , we find @xmath87 @xmath123 @xmath124 equations for @xmath3 and @xmath47 are identical to symmetric case .",
