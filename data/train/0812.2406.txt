    "the mathematical model that we analyze in this paper describes the dynamic evolution of two spherical shells of charged matter which freely move outside the field of a central reissner - nordstrom ( rn ) source .",
    "microscopically these shells are assumed to be composed by charged particles which move on elliptical orbits with a collective variable radius . the angular motion , distributed uniformly and isotropically on the shell surfaces , is mathematically described by a tangential - pressure term in the energy momentum tensor of the einstein equations .",
    "the definition of the shell implies that all the particles have the same following three ratios : energy / mass , angular momentum / mass , and charge / mass .",
    "indeed , since the equations of motion for any singled - out particle `` a '' are @xmath0 ( @xmath1 and @xmath2 are the components of a spherical symmetric metric and @xmath3 is the electric potential ; @xmath4 and @xmath5 are arbitrary constants ) , it is easy to see that the radial motion for all particles is the same if @xmath6 where each @xmath7 does not depend on the index @xmath8",
    ". therefore , if at the beginning the particles are on the same radius @xmath9 , then the shell will evolve `` coherently '' , i.e. all particles will evolve with the same radius .",
    "now the problem we are interested in is to find the exchange of energy between the two shells after the intersection .",
    "indeed the motion of the shells before and after the crossing can be easily deduced from the equation of motion for just one shell , which equation has been found many years ago by chase@xcite with a geometrical method first used by israel@xcite . instead , the intersection problem was considered first by langer - eid@xcite : they applied it to the particular case of electrically neutral and pressureless shells ( neutral dust ) , then barkov et al.@xcite considered the more general case of shells intersections when the shells have also tangential pressure ( so langer - eid s results follows from barkov et al .",
    "results as particular case ) .",
    "now we generalize this problem for the shells with tangential pressure and also electric charge .",
    "what we achieve in the present paper is the determination of the constant parameters after the intersection knowing just the parameters before the intersection .",
    "actually the unknown parameter is only one , @xmath10 , which is the schwarzschild mass parameter measured by an observer between the shells after the intersection .",
    "this parameter is strictly related to the energy transfer which takes place in the crossing , and it is found imposing a proper continuity condition on the shells velocities .    in the model",
    "we assume that there are no other interactions between the two shells apart the gravitational and electrostatic ones .",
    "in particular the shells , during the intersection , are assumed to be `` transparent '' each other ( i.e. no scattering processes ) .",
    "the paper is divided as follows : in sec.2 we preliminarily discuss the one - shell case ; in sec.3 , which is the central part of this article , we find the unknown parameter @xmath11 ; then , secs.4 - 7 are devoted to some applications : post - newtonian approximation , zero effective masses case ( i.e. ultra - relativistic case ) , test - shell case , and finally the ejection mechanism .",
    "in this paper we deal only with the mathematical aspects of the problem ; some astrophysical applications of charged shells in the field of a rn black hole have been considered in ref .",
    "the motion of a thin charged dust - shell with a central rn singularity was firstly studied by de la cruz and israel@xcite , while the case with tangential pressure was achieved by chase@xcite in 1970 .",
    "all these authors used the extrinsic curvature tensor and the gauss - codazzi equations .",
    "however we followed a different way , indeed the same solution can be found also by using @xmath12 and @xmath13 distributions and then by direct integration of the einstein - maxwell equations ( see ref . [ ] and the appendix in ref . [ ] ) .",
    "this method has the advantage of a clearer physical interpretation , and it is also straightforward in the calculations ; however in the following we will give only the main passages .",
    "let there be a central body of mass @xmath14 and charge @xmath15 and let a spherical massive charged shell with charge @xmath16 move outside this body .",
    "it is clear in advance that the field internal to the shell will be rn , while externally we will have again a rn metric but with different mass and charge parameters @xmath17 and @xmath18 . using the coordinates @xmath19 and @xmath20 , which are continuous when passing through the shell , we can write the intervals inside , outside , and on the shell as    @xmath21    where we denoted @xmath22 and @xmath23 in the interval ( [ ds3 ] ) , @xmath24 is the proper time of the shell .",
    "the `` dilaton '' factor @xmath25 in ( [ ds1 ] ) is required to ensure the continuity of the time coordinate @xmath26 through the shell .",
    "if the equation of motion for the shell is @xmath27 then joining the angular part of the three intervals ( [ ds1])-([ds3 ] ) , one has @xmath28,\\ ] ] where the function @xmath29 describes the relationship between the global time and the proper time of the shell . joining the radial - time parts of the intervals ( [ ds1])-([ds2 ] ) on the shell",
    "requires that the following relations hold : @xmath30 @xmath31 if the equation of motion for the shell i.e .",
    "the function @xmath32 is known , then the function @xmath29 follows from ( [ 7 ] ) and consequently @xmath33 can be deduced by ( [ 6 ] ) .",
    "thus the problem consist only in determining @xmath32 , which can be done by direct integration of the einstein - maxwell equations @xmath34 with the energy - momentum tensor given by : @xmath35    here on we employ the following notations : @xmath36 the above equations are to be solved for the metric @xmath37    and for the potential @xmath38    as follows from the landau - lifshitz approach [ ] ( see ref . [ ] ) the energy distribution of the shell is @xmath39}{4\\pi r^2 u^0 \\sqrt{-g_{00}g_{11}}},\\ ] ] while its charge density is @xmath40}{4\\pi r^2u^0\\sqrt{-g_{00}g_{11}}},\\ ] ] where @xmath12 is the standard @xmath12-function . in the absence of tangential pressure @xmath41 , the quantity @xmath42 in eqn.([11 ] ) would be a constant , but in presence of pressure , @xmath43 includes the rest energy along with the energy ( in the radially comoving frame ) of the tangential motions of the particles that produce this pressure .",
    "it can be checked that the einstein part of ( [ a.1 ] ) actually lead to the solution ( [ ds1])-([ds3 ] ) with , in addition , the `` joint condition '' @xmath44 where we denoted @xmath45,\\ ] ] while @xmath46 is a constant which can be interpreted as the total amount of energy of the shell",
    ". then , from the maxwell side of ( [ a.1 ] ) the only non - vanishing component of the electric field is @xmath47\\}\\ ] ] ( @xmath48 is the standard step function ) .",
    "finally , the equations @xmath49 can be reduced to the only one relation : @xmath50}{8\\pi r u^1\\sqrt{-g_{00}g_{11}}}\\ ] ]    we will not treat here the steady case ( i.e. @xmath51 ) which should be treated separately ; thus in the following we will assume always @xmath52",
    ".    the joint condition ( [ joint ] ) can be written in several different forms : two of them , which will be useful in the following , are @xmath53 and @xmath54 as in ref .",
    ", all the radicals encountered here are taken positive , since for astrophysical considerations only these cases are meaningful . to proceed further",
    ", we must specify the equation of state , i.e. the function @xmath55 . here",
    "we consider a particle - made shell , therefore the sum of kinetic and rest energy of all the particles is @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the tangential momentum of each particle ( the electric interaction between the particles is already taken into account by the self - energy term of , e.g. , ( [ 18 ] ) , thus one has not to include it in @xmath42 too ) . from the definition of the shell ( see introduction ) it follows : @xmath58 the square root in ( [ 21 ] ) does not depend on the index @xmath8 ; then defining @xmath59 formula ( [ 21 ] ) can be re - written ( remembering definition ( [ mu ] ) too ) as @xmath60 thus , now , one can determine the function @xmath32 from equation ( [ joint ] ) [ or from one of the equivalent forms ( [ 18])-([19 ] ) ] if the initial radius of the shell and the six arbitrary constants @xmath61 and @xmath62 are specified . accordingly with (",
    "[ 11 ] ) , ( [ 14 ] ) , ( [ mu ] ) and ( [ 24 ] ) , the equation of state that relates the shell energy density @xmath63 to the tangential pressure @xmath41 is @xmath64 as in the uncharged case , i.e. the presence of the charges do not modify the relation between energy density and pressure ( indeed the presence of the charge is hidden in the equation of motion ) .",
    "note that when the shell expands to infinity ( @xmath65 ) the angular momentum becomes irrelevant and the equation of state tends to the dust case @xmath66 .",
    "let us now consider the case of two shells which move in the field of a central charged mass .",
    "the generalization from the previous ( single - shell ) case is straightforward if the shells do not intersect : indeed the outer shell do not affect the motion of the inner one , while the inner one appears from outside just as a rn metric .",
    "therefore the principal aim of this section is to consider the intersection eventuality and to predict the motion of the two shells _ after _ the crossing , having specified the initial conditions before the crossing . after the intersection one has a new unknown constant that has to be found by imposing opportune joining conditions as now we are going to explain ( the analysis follows step by step the ref.s one ) .",
    "let us previously analyze the space - time in the @xmath67 coordinates ( which are continuous through the shells ) .",
    "we define the point @xmath68 as the intersection point ; then the space - time is divided in four regions ( see fig.1 ) : @xmath69 correspondingly to these regions we have the metric in form ( [ 7 ] ) but with different coefficients @xmath70 and @xmath71 : @xmath72 the dilaton factor @xmath33 allows to cover all the space - time with only one @xmath26-coordinate ; here , @xmath73 and @xmath74 are the same as those in ( [ 4 ] ) while @xmath75 and @xmath76 are given by similar expressions : @xmath77 as we said , the parameters @xmath78 are assumed to be specified at the beginning , while @xmath10 is the actual unknown constant which has yet to be determined from the joining conditions on @xmath79 .",
    "let us write the equation of motion for the two shells before the intersection ( shell-1 inner and shell-2 outer ) .",
    "this can be made easily adapting the ( [ 19 ] ) and ( [ 18 ] ) to the present case : @xmath80 for shell 1 , while for shell 2 @xmath81 with @xmath82 here , @xmath83 and @xmath84 are the proper times of the first and second shells respectively , while @xmath85 $ ] and @xmath86 $ ] .",
    "now we have to impose the joining conditions for the intervals on both the shells .",
    "for the first shell ( on curve ao ) one has : @xmath87 @xmath88 while for the second shell : @xmath89",
    "@xmath90    if all free parameters and initial data to eqs.([30])-([32 ] ) were specified and if the functions @xmath91 and @xmath92 were derived , then their substitution in ( [ 33])-([36 ] ) gives the functions @xmath93 , @xmath94 and @xmath95 , @xmath96 , which is enough for determining the motion of the shells before the intersection .",
    "therefore the intersection point @xmath79 can be found by solving the system @xmath97 which we assume that has a solution .",
    "the equation of motion for the shells after the intersection time @xmath98 can be constructed in the same way again by turning to eqns.([18 ] ) and ( [ 19 ] ) , and introducing the new parameter @xmath10 which characterize the `` schwarschild mass '' seen by an observer in the region @xmath99 .",
    "we use eq.([18 ] ) for ( now outer ) shell 1 and eq.([19 ] ) for ( now inner ) shell 2 : @xmath100    @xmath101    naturally , @xmath102 and @xmath103 are given by the same expression of ( [ 32 ] ) but now they have to be calculated on @xmath91 and @xmath92 after the intersection .",
    "joining the intervals on the first shell ( on curve @xmath104 ) yields @xmath105 @xmath106 then , joining the second shell ( on curve @xmath104 ) we obtain : @xmath107 @xmath108 since the initial data to eqs.([38 ] ) and ( [ 39 ] ) have already been specified ( from the previous evolution ) , then the evolution of the shells after the intersection would be determined from eqs.([38])-([43 ] ) if parameter @xmath10 were known .",
    "thus we need an additional physical condition from which we could determine @xmath10 .",
    "this condition follows from the fact that the christoffel symbols ( i.e. the accelerations ) of the shells have only finite discontinuities ( finite jumps ) , therefore the relative velocity of the shells must remain continuous through the crossing point .    in the presence of two shells ,",
    "we can construct one more invariant than in the single shell case ( where only @xmath109 was possible ) : the scalar product between the two 4-velocities of the shells .",
    "we can also avoid to apply the parallel transport if we evaluate the 4-velocities on the intersection point @xmath79 .",
    "the continuity condition can be found imposing that the scalar product has to have the same value when evaluated in both the two limits @xmath110 and @xmath111 .",
    "let us start determining the quantity @xmath112 which is the scalar product of the two 4-velocities evaluated in the intersection point from the region @xmath113 ( along the curves @xmath114 and @xmath115 ) .",
    "written explicitly , the unit tangent vector to trajectory @xmath114 is    @xmath116    while for the trajectory @xmath115 we have    @xmath117    the fact that these are actually unit vectors follows from the joining equations ( [ 33 ] ) and ( [ 36 ] ) .",
    "the components of the vector ( [ 44 ] ) can be easily expressed from eqs.([30 ] ) and ( [ 33 ] ) as @xmath118    @xmath119    where @xmath120 analogously , for the components of vector ( [ 45 ] ) , we obtain the following expressions from eqs.([31 ] ) and ( [ 36 ] ) : @xmath121    @xmath122    @xmath123    thus , from the preceding results , we obtain : @xmath124 here and in the following we omit the coordinate dependence of @xmath125 , @xmath126 etc .",
    ", implicitly assuming that they have to be evaluated on @xmath79 where not differently indicated .",
    "it is possible to apply the same procedure to the region @xmath99",
    "( i.e. after the intersection time ) , finding the quantity @xmath128    now the unit tangent vectors to trajectories @xmath104 and @xmath129 are , we tacitly assume before a ( possible ) second intersection . ] :    @xmath130    and    @xmath131    from the joining conditions ( [ 41 ] ) and ( [ 42 ] ) it is possible to see that these are actually unit vectors .",
    "the components of @xmath132 can be deduced from eqs.([38 ] ) and ( [ 41 ] ) , while the components of @xmath133 from eqs.([39 ] ) and ( [ 42 ] ) . then , using the metric in the region @xmath99 , it is possible to calculate the scalar product @xmath134 where @xmath135 and @xmath136 have been defined as in ( [ 48 ] ) and ( [ 51 ] ) , but for @xmath137 .",
    "we introduced these symbols only for generality , but actually we are interested only in the case with , because there are non discontinuities in the velocities . ]",
    "@xmath138    the necessary continuity requirement is thus @xmath139 then , since @xmath140 is assumed to be known , this equation allows to find @xmath10 .",
    "using standard definition for the shell velocities before the intersection one has @xmath141    @xmath142    and similarly for the velocities after the intersection , @xmath143    @xmath144    then it is easy to obtain from the definitions ( [ 52 ] ) and ( [ 56 ] ) , that , which is the relative velocity definition of two `` particles '' in relativistic mechanics . ]",
    "@xmath145 and @xmath146      first of all it is convenient to introduce new symbols to simplify the expressions of q and q. with    @xmath147    and    @xmath148    then @xmath149 and @xmath150 can be re - written as @xmath151 and @xmath152 now , in principle is possible to find @xmath10 by squaring and solving @xmath153 ( which is a quartic equation ) .",
    "however the procedure is cumbersome and moreover it is not possible with eq.([58 ] ) alone to determine the sign of the roots .",
    "fortunately , as in the non - charged case , it is possible to follow another easier way .",
    "indeed , it is possible to introduce two other invariants , say @xmath154 and @xmath155 , similar to @xmath149 and @xmath150 , which are constructed using the scalar products of the 4-velocities of the two shell , but now taking the limit to @xmath79 from the @xmath156 and @xmath157 regions respectively .",
    "more explicitly , we define @xmath158 and @xmath159 then , the same continuity requirement of eq.([58 ] ) implies that it must hold also that @xmath160 following the same method used to find @xmath149 and @xmath150 , after some calculations , one arrives to @xmath161 and @xmath162 where we have denoted    @xmath163    and    @xmath164      thus the complete set of continuity conditions at the point of intersection can be written as @xmath165 it turns out that this three quartic equations for the unknown parameter @xmath10 have only one common root , and then choose the correct root solution by requiring that @xmath166 has to be positive , see ref .  .",
    "it is possible to find the solution using hyperbolic functions .",
    "the final result is remarkably simple : @xmath167 or equivalently , in terms of @xmath76 : @xmath168 it can be easily seen from eqn.([78 ] ) that the charge @xmath15 of the central singularity does not affect the result ( but it affects the equation of the motion of the shells and thus @xmath149 ) .",
    "formula ( [ 78 ] ) solves the problem of determining the mass parameter @xmath10 from the quantities specified at the evolutionary stage before intersection .",
    "it is then possible to determine the energy transfer between the shells .",
    "indeed the energy of shell 1 and 2 before the intersection are , respectively @xmath169 while , after the intersection @xmath170 the conservation of total energy is automatically ensured by the above formulas , indeed @xmath171 then it is natural to define the exchange energy as @xmath172 then , from eqn.([78 ] ) and the above definitions , it follows that @xmath173 it is also useful ( especially for the newtonian approximation ) to use eqn.([62 ] ) and re - express @xmath174 as : @xmath175",
    "for slow velocities of the shells it is interesting to consider the post - newtonian limit of eqn.([84 ] ) :    @xmath176 ^ 2+\\frac{gm_2l_1 ^ 2}{m_1r_*^3}+ \\frac{gm_1l_2 ^ 2}{m_2r_*^3 } \\right\\}+o\\left(\\frac{1}{c^4}\\right ) \\ .\\label{99}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    it is worth noting that only the zeroth order in @xmath177 changes with respect to the uncharged case ( because of the coulomb term @xmath178 ) , while all the other orders remain unchanged , being of kinetic origin ; @xmath179 and @xmath180 are the rest masses of the shells , indeed we have used for the masses @xmath181 and @xmath182 the definitions ( [ 32 ] ) .    it can be also useful to re - express all the quantities in a newtonian language and consider only the zeroth order in @xmath177 , e.g. we can expand the energy as @xmath183 where @xmath184 and @xmath185 do not depend on @xmath186 .",
    "therefore , similarly , we can define at the first order in @xmath177 @xmath187 then it follows also that the energy conservation law takes the form @xmath188 and eqn.([82 ] ) becomes @xmath189 where @xmath190 .",
    "thus from the above formulas and definitions it is clear that @xmath191",
    "it is interesting also to consider the case in which the motion of the particles of the shells is only radial ( i.e. @xmath192 ) and the rest masses are negligible with respect to the kinetic energies and to the charges indeed this is the case for two shells composed by ( ultra)rela - tivistic electrons and positrons . in this case",
    "the effective masses can be replaced by @xmath194 where @xmath195 is a parameter arbitrary small . from eqn.([83 ] ) , with @xmath149 expressed by formula ( [ 53 ] ) , it is easy to find that the energy transfer in this case is @xmath196 having assumed that the shells have opposite - directed velocities , i.e. @xmath197 otherwise , if the shells goes in the same direction , i.e. @xmath198 then eqn.([83 ] ) becomes simply @xmath199 obviously the previous formulas make sense only if @xmath140 exists .",
    "we want to underline the presence of the term @xmath200 , because , strictly speaking , a charge can not have zero rest mass , therefore we are in the case of just _ small _ effective masses . as expected , in the case of vanishing charges ( @xmath201 ) , eqn.([120l ] ) gives zero at @xmath202 because this is the case of two photon - shells which go in the same direction and therefore can not never intersect .",
    "let us consider firstly the case of a test shell on the rn field .",
    "this limit has the only aim to show that the shell s equation of motion ( [ 18 ] ) actually reduce to the simple test - particle case ; the limit can be obtained by putting @xmath203 with @xmath204 .",
    "then , considering also ( [ 24 ] ) , we find that eqn.([18 ] ) becomes @xmath205 now , putting @xmath206 the self - energy term is killed ; then re - writing eqn.([128 ] ) using the more familiar schwarzschild time @xmath26 and eqn.([rr2 ] ) , @xmath207 it is easy to recognize that eqn.([129 ] ) coincides with the first integral of motion of a test - charge particle on the reinssner - nordstrom background , where @xmath208 is the conserved energy of the particle , @xmath184 the rest mass , @xmath16 the charge and @xmath62 the angular momentum .",
    "now we can deal with the more interesting two - shell case , in which shell-2 is considered `` test '' . to gain this limit we have to put @xmath209 then , using eqn.([78 ] ) with @xmath149 given by formula ( [ 53 ] ) , one obtains @xmath210 thus , only the self - energy terms of shell-2 are killed by @xmath202 .",
    "now , it is worth noting the following fact : shell-1 does not have any discontinuity when it intersect the shell-2 ( this is natural because shell-2 is `` test '' and does not affect the metric ) , on the other hand shell-2 undergoes a discontinuity in the metric when it cross shell-1 and consequently it has an actual discontinuity in the velocity .",
    "it is easy to calculate this gap ; indeed using the definition ( [ 59.b ] ) of velocity @xmath211 [ with the time @xmath212 given by the joint condition ( [ 36 ] ) ] , with metric coefficient ( [ 26 ] ) , and with the help the first integral of motion ( [ 31 ] ) , one finds @xmath213 where we have used @xmath214 ; in the same way , using ( [ 63.b ] ) , ( [ 42 ] ) , ( [ 28 ] ) , and ( [ 39 ] ) , the velocity @xmath215 ( after the intersection ) is @xmath216 ^ 2=    1-{f_{in}}(r_2)\\left(\\frac{e_2'}{m_2(r_2)}-\\frac{e_2(e_1+{e_{in}})^2}{m_2(r_2)r_2}\\right)^{-2}+o(\\lambda ) \\ , \\ \\ \\",
    "t\\geq t_*\\ , \\ ] ] where @xmath217 can be expressed in function of @xmath218 with the help of ( [ 137 ] ) . from the previous formulas it is clear that in general @xmath219",
    "the exchange in energy of the shells during the intersection makes possible that one initially bounded shell can acquire enough energy to escape to infinity .",
    "the shell ejection mechanism can take place also in the newtonian regime . in this case , from eqs.([90])-([91 ] ) it results that @xmath220 and then , after the first intersection @xmath221 where we have denoted the radius of the first and second intersection with @xmath222 and @xmath223 respectively . in the following",
    "we will consider only the case @xmath224 this is e.g. the case in which the two shells have opposite charges .",
    "thus , also in the case @xmath225 , if @xmath226 and if the initial condition were in such a way that @xmath222 is enough small and @xmath223 not too much close to @xmath222 , then it is possible to have @xmath227 , i.e. the ejection of the second shell .",
    "let us now assume that @xmath228 , and consider a `` semi - relativistic '' case in which at the first intersection we use the full relativistic formulas .",
    "] , @xmath229 while at the second intersection we use the newtonian approximation ,    @xmath230    \\\\\\\\         e_2''&= e_2'-\\frac{{gm_1m_2-e_1e_2}}{r _ * '' }   \\\\         & = e_2+\\left[\\frac{m_1(r_*')m_2(r_*')(-q)-e_1e_2}{r_*'}-\\frac{{gm_1m_2-e_1e_2}}{r_*''}\\right]\\ , .",
    "\\end{cases}\\ ] ]    this approximation is always justified if the radius of the second intersection @xmath223 is enough large .",
    "now , it is remarkable that whatever the value of @xmath222 is , the first term in the square brackets in eqn.([143 ] ) satisfies the inequality @xmath231 comparing the expressions ( [ 143 ] ) , ( [ 144 ] ) and ( [ 141 ] ) it is possible to see that in the relativistic regime the shell ejection possibility is even greater than in the newtonian case . furthermore , it is worth noting that the presence of the charge do not change qualitatively the pure gravitational analysis , but just magnifies the ejection effect .",
    "let us consider also briefly the case in which the shells are equal - signed charged and the repulsion overcome the gravity attraction , i.e. @xmath232 .",
    "in this case the ejection can happen only after an odd number of intersections .",
    "e.g. after three intersections , from the previous formulas we have , in the newtonian approximation : @xmath233 obviously this formula has a meaning only if @xmath234 otherwise the ejection happens at the first intersection ( and then there would not be other crossings , and no @xmath235 ) , or never more ; if eqn.([146 ] ) is true , then it means that the barycenter of the two shells is falling into the center singularity .",
    "we have found the energy exchange between two charged crossing shells ( formula ( [ 84 ] ) ) . then we have studied special cases of physical interest in which the formulas simplify : the non relativistic case , the massless shells , the test shell , and finally the ejection mechanism in a semi - newtonian regime : we found that the ejection mechanism is more efficient in the charged case than in the neutral one if the charges have opposite sign ( because the energy transfer is larger due to the coulomb interaction ) ."
