    "exclusive processes with hadronic final states test various model calculations motivated by perturbative or non - perturbative qcd .",
    "two - photon production of exclusive hadronic final states is particularly attractive due to the absence of strong interactions in the initial state and the possibility of calculating @xmath15 amplitudes .",
    "the perturbative qcd calculation by brodsky and lepage ( bl )  @xcite is based on factorization of the amplitude into a hard scattering amplitude for @xmath16 and a single - meson distribution amplitude .",
    "their prediction gives the dependence on the center - of - mass ( c.m.)energy @xmath17 and scattering angle @xmath18 for @xmath19 processes @xmath20 where @xmath21 represents a meson and @xmath22 denotes its electromagnetic form factor .",
    "vogt  @xcite , based on the perturbative approach , claimed a need for soft contributions , as his result for the hard contribution was well below the experimental cross section obtained by cleo  @xcite .",
    "diehl , kroll and vogt ( dkv ) proposed  @xcite the soft handbag contribution to two - photon annihilation into pion or kaon pairs at large energy and momentum transfers , in which the amplitude is expressed by a hard @xmath23 subprocess and a form factor describing the soft transition from @xmath24 to the meson pair .",
    "dkv , as well as bl , predict the @xmath10 dependence of the angular differential cross section , which is an important test of these approaches .",
    "it is interesting to investigate experimentally an energy scale where those theoretical predictions become valid .",
    "the recent measurements of @xmath13 and @xmath1 performed by aleph  @xcite are consistent , within their errors , with the bl s prediction of the energy dependence , but not the normalization .",
    "however , their dataset is not sufficient to conclusively test the @xmath4 and @xmath10 dependences .    in this report",
    ", we measure @xmath13 and @xmath14 processes with high precision , and make quantitative comparisons with qcd predictions .",
    "this analysis is based on an @xmath2 data sample collected at or near the @xmath25 resonance energy , accumulated with the belle detector  @xcite located at kekb  @xcite .",
    "kekb is a colliding beam accelerator of 8@xmath26 electrons and 3.5@xmath26 positrons designed to produce copious @xmath27 meson pairs to observe _ cp _ violation .    the belle detector , with a @xmath28 solenoidal magnetic field , surrounds the interaction point and subtends the polar angle range @xmath29 , measured from the @xmath30 axis , which is aligned opposite the positron beam .",
    "it is described in detail in ref .",
    "briefly , charged track momenta and their decay points are measured by the central drift chamber ( cdc ) and silicon vertex detector ( svd ) .",
    "the hadron identity of these charged tracks is determined using information from the time - of - flight counters ( tof ) , the aerogel threshold erenkov counters ( acc ) , and the specific ionization in the cdc .",
    "hadron / electron discrimination is performed using the above information as well as the energy deposition and shower profile in the segmented csi(tl)-crystal electromagnetic calorimeter ( ecl ) .",
    "hadron / muon discrimination is achieved using information from the neutral - kaon and muon detector ( klm ) , which consists of glass resistive plate counters embedded in the solenoid s iron flux return .",
    "the signal events are collected predominantly by a trigger that requires two charged tracks penetrating through the cdc and tof , with an opening angle in the @xmath31 plane ( perpendicular to the @xmath30 axis ) of at least @xmath32 .",
    "we select signal candidates according to the following criteria .",
    "there must be exactly two oppositely - charged reconstructed tracks satisfying the following conditions : @xmath33 for the polar angle @xmath34 of each track ; @xmath35 gev/@xmath36 for the momentum component in the @xmath31 plane of each track ; @xmath37 cm and @xmath38 cm for the origin of each track relative to the nominal @xmath39 collision point ; and @xmath40 cm for the two tracks origin difference along the @xmath30 axis , where the origin is defined by the closest approach of the track to the nominal collision point in the @xmath31 plane .",
    "the event is vetoed if it contains any other reconstructed charged track with transverse momentum above 0.1 gev/@xmath36 .",
    "cosmic rays are suppressed by demanding that the opening angle @xmath41 between the two tracks satisfy @xmath42 .",
    "the signal is enriched relative to other backgrounds by requiring that the scalar sum of the momentum of the two tracks be below 6 gev/@xmath36 , the total energy deposited in the ecl be below 6 gev , the magnitude of the net transverse momentum of the above - selected two charged tracks in the @xmath39 c.m .",
    "frame be below 0.2 gev/@xmath36 ( this condition is tightened in the next section ) , the invariant mass of these two tracks be below 4.5 gev/@xmath43 , and that the squared missing mass of the event be above 2 gev@xmath44/@xmath45 . here , the two tracks are assumed to be massless particles .",
    "the latter two requirements eliminate radiative bhabha and initial state radiation events .",
    "the remaining events consist of two - photon production of @xmath39 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 , and @xmath49 final states as well as unvetoed @xmath50 events according to a monte carlo ( mc ) study  @xcite .",
    "the predicted versus measured range and transverse deviation of hits in the klm are used to construct a normalized likelihood @xmath51 that a track extrapolated from the cdc is a muon rather than a pion or kaon . here",
    ", we classify an event as arising from @xmath52 if either track has @xmath53 .",
