    "holomorphic ( and antiholomorphic ) fields are the basic building blocks of conformal field theories ( cfts ) .",
    "they have simple short - distance expansions among themselves and with other fields of the theory .",
    "although the prototype of such holomorphic field is the stress tensor @xmath0 , which is present in all cfts , many interesting cfts contain holomorphic fields with fractional conformal spin .",
    "these are often referred to as parafermionic .",
    "the correlation functions of such holomorphic fields are necessarily power - behaved , and therefore , in local theories , can exist only in the massless , conformal case .",
    "many cfts are also believed to describe the scaling limit of critical lattice models . in order to understand the emergence of holomorphic fields in this limit",
    ", the simplest possibility is that there should exist analogues already in the discrete setting . these we refer to as _",
    "discretely holomorphic observables _ of the lattice model .",
    "a precise definition is given below .    recently a number of examples of such observables have been discovered in well - known lattice models . in models which possess a kramers - wannier duality symmetry ,",
    "parafermionic observables can be defined in terms of suitable products of neighboring order and disorder variables  @xcite . in the case of the @xmath1 , or clock , models ,",
    "it was shown in @xcite that such parafermions are indeed discretely holomorphic , but only at the _ integrable _ critical points identified by fateev and zamolodchikov  @xcite . in this case",
    "the parafermions were defined algebraically directly in terms of the spin variables and boltzmann weights of the model .",
    "a second example is the @xmath2-state potts model , which also possesses a duality symmetry .",
    "this model , in its fortuin - kasteleyn ( fk ) random cluster form , can also be represented in terms of a set of dense random curves  @xcite . in @xcite",
    ", it was shown that the parafermions defined in terms of order - disorder products have support on these curves , and indeed may be considered as observables depending only on the curves .",
    "for example , the two - point function vanishes unless the two points happen to lie on the same curve . in @xcite",
    "a simple argument was given that these parafermionic observables are discretely holomorphic , but only at the critical point of the potts model ( where it is also known to be integrable ) .",
    "in this paper we amplify these comments and enlarge the list of lattice models for which discretely holomorphic observables can be identified . in particular , we consider various versions of the @xmath3 model which do not possess kramers - wannier duality and for which the definition of a parafermion in terms of an order - disorder product fails .",
    "however , these models all have a representation in terms of curves on the lattice , and using this we show that one may still define parafermionic observables , generalising the construction in the potts model . moreover , in all cases",
    ", these turn out to be discretely holomorphic precisely when the model is integrable and critical .",
    "more generally , we may consider versions of these models where the weights are anisotropic . in this case",
    ", one would expect the scaling limit to be a rotationally invariant cft only if the lattice is embedded in the plane in a particular way .",
    "in general , there is a one - parameter family of such inequivalent embeddings of a homogeneous lattice . for a given embedding",
    ", we find that discrete holomorphicity holds only for a particular set of weights .",
    "these weights , in all cases , satisfy the yang - baxter equation , with the usual spectral parameter being simply related to the angle of shear in the embedding .",
    "this is a remarkable result , since the requirement of discrete holomorphicity , as we will show , gives a set of linear equations in the weights for a fixed value of the spectral parameter . on the other hand ,",
    "the yang - baxter equations are cubic functional relations between the weights at different values of the spectral parameter .",
    "let us define more carefully the notion of discrete holomorphicity .",
    "let @xmath4 be a planar graph ( which will usually be a regular lattice ) embedded in the complex plane , with vertices at points @xmath5 .",
    "let @xmath6 be a function defined on the vertices of the medial lattice : the midpoints @xmath7 of the edges @xmath8 of @xmath4 .",
    "then @xmath9 is discretely holomorphic on @xmath4 if @xmath10 where the sum is over the edges of each face , or plaquette , @xmath11 of @xmath4 . may be thought of as a discrete version of cauchy s theorem .",
    "however , note that , since there are fewer equations than unknowns , even in the discrete setting is not sufficient to solve a boundary value problem on @xmath4 .",
    "( this should be compared with the example of the discrete laplace equation . ) in addition , if we try to take the scaling limit by covering the interior of some domain @xmath12 in the plane by a suitable sequence of graphs @xmath4 whose mesh size approaches zero , we may deduce that contour integrals vanish , but morera s theorem implies that the scaling limit of @xmath9 is analytic only if we first assume , or prove , that it is continuous .",
    "( in the ising case , where the scaling limit has been proven  @xcite , it was in fact necessary to adopt another less direct approach . )    in the examples we discuss , the discrete holomorphicity follows entirely from local properties of the lattice model , and therefore we may in fact take @xmath6 to be any correlation function of the local parafermionic observable with other local fields at other locations , which may be thought of as a conditional expectation value . in",
    "what follows we shall not distinguish explicitly between the observable and its correlation functions .",
    "we note that smirnov  @xcite has argued that if one can find suitable discretely holomorphic parafermionic observables of curves in lattice models , and also prove that they have a holomorphic scaling limit satisfying suitable boundary conditions , such that their dependence on @xmath13 in simple domains is computable , then it follows that the scaling limit of the curves is schramm - loewner evolution ( sle@xmath14 ) with a value of @xmath15 related to the conformal spin . this programme has been carried to completion for the ising model , for the curves forming boundaries of both the spin clusters and the fk clusters  @xcite .",
    "this application of discrete holomorphicity is not the purpose of the present paper .",
    "rather it is to point out that it holds in a wider class of models than was observed up to now , and that it appears to be intimately related to integrability .",
    "however , we should note a general feature of the relation of our results to sle . as was first observed in @xcite , the statement that a curve starting on the boundary of a domain is sle is equivalent in cft to the assertion that the boundary operator which inserts the curve corresponds to a virasoro highest weight representation with a null state at level 2 , usually denoted by @xmath16 ( or @xmath17 ) .",
    "it has conformal weight @xmath18 .",
    "now one of the important properties of a _ holomorphic _ bulk conformal field @xmath19 with spin @xmath20 is that , when taken to the boundary , it gives a boundary field with the _ same _ total conformal weight , that is @xmath20 .",
    "if the bulk field is an observable which depends on @xmath21 curves , which meet locally at the point @xmath13 but begin at different points @xmath22 on the boundary , this implies that the cft correlation function @xmath23 is non - zero . by the fusion rules of boundary cft",
    ", this implies that @xmath24 must be a @xmath25 field , and therefore that @xmath26 thus if one knows the value of @xmath20 one may infer the value of @xmath15 . in this paper",
    "we give examples with @xmath27 , as well as cases when the curve can not be simple sle .",
    "we note that in this paper we shall consider homogeneous , translationally invariant lattices , but many of the arguments extend to so - called baxter lattices , which may be embedded in the plane isoradially ( that is all their faces are rhombi ) .",
    "these have been discussed with respect to the @xmath1 models in @xcite and the potts model in @xcite .",
    "discretely holomorphic functions in the ising model are also studied in  @xcite .",
    "the layout of this paper is as follows . in section  [ sec : potts ]",
    "we review the arguments for the fk representation of the potts model . in section  [ sec : onsquare ] we give a parafermionic observable for nienhuis @xmath3 model on the square lattice  @xcite , and show that it is discretely holomorphic precisely on the integrable manifolds  @xcite . in section  [ sec : c21 ] we extend this to a model  @xcite with two different kinds of loops which may cross each other",
    ". our arguments in these last two cases are generalisations of those of smirnov  @xcite for the @xmath3 model on the honeycomb lattice .",
    "the @xmath2-state potts model is a classical spin model on the lattice .",
    "each vertex carries a spin variable @xmath28 , and the boltzmann weight for a spin configuration is @xmath29 =    \\prod_{\\langle i , j \\rangle } \\exp \\left [ j_{ij } \\",
    "\\delta(s_i , s_j ) \\right ] \\,,\\ ] ] where the product is on the edges of the lattice , and @xmath30 is the coupling constant attached to edge  @xmath31 .",
    "we consider the case of the square lattice @xmath32 , with coupling constants @xmath33 on the horizontal and vertical edges , respectively .",
    "the model can be reformulated  @xcite as a dense loop model on the medial lattice @xmath34 : this is the lattice consisting of the midpoints of the original lattice .",
    "the elementary configurations of the loop model are defined on square plaquettes @xmath11 , which are the faces of the covering lattice @xmath35 , the dual of @xmath34 ( see left - hand side of figure  [ fig : medial ] ) .",
    "the boltzmann weights of the elementary plaquettes ( see figure  [ fig : tl - bw ] ) are @xmath36 , where @xmath37 and @xmath38 respectively if the plaquette contains a horizontal or a vertical edge of the original lattice .",
    "each closed loop carries a weight @xmath39 .",
    "equivalently , the loop model boltzmann weights can be encoded in the @xmath40-matrix @xmath41 , where @xmath42 ( the temperley - lieb generator ) is the operator acting on loop diagrams as depicted on the right of figure  [ fig : tl - bw ] , and @xmath43 is called the spectral parameter .    in this paper , we will restrict ourselves to the self - dual line : @xmath44 in the case that the loop model is homogeneous . for @xmath45",
    ", the potts model has a second - order transition on this line . in this regime",
    ", we can write : @xmath46    in @xcite , a lattice holomorphic observable @xmath47 was identified in this loop formulation .",
    "the observable @xmath47 is defined on the midpoints of the plaquette edges as follows : @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the probability of the graph  @xmath50 , @xmath51 is the set of loop configurations for which the points @xmath52 and @xmath13 belong to the same loop , and @xmath53 is the winding angle of this loop from @xmath52 to @xmath13 .",
    "more precisely , we fix arbitrarily a point @xmath52 on the edge of a plaquette ( this could be in the bulk or on the boundary of the domain ) , and a direction for the loop segment passing through @xmath52 . the winding angle  @xmath53 is defined incrementally , setting @xmath54 , and adding @xmath55 for each elementary plaquette on the loop , according to the turn made by the loop .",
    "the real number @xmath20 is the spin of the parafermion @xmath47 . in @xcite ,",
    "the holomorphicity relation   was established for @xmath56 defined in  , at the isotropic self - dual point : @xmath57 .",
    "this is only true if the spin @xmath20 satisfies : @xmath58 in this section , we adapt these results to the whole ( anisotropic ) self - dual line .    on the one hand , since the loop plaquettes obey a temperley - lieb algebra , the @xmath40-matrix satisfies the yang - baxter equations : @xmath59 for the parameterisation @xmath60 . on the other hand ,",
    "let us consider the following _ deformed model _",
    ": this is the self - dual potts model with and anisotropic weights @xmath61 , defined on the rectangular lattice with vertical edges scaled by a factor @xmath62 ( see figure  [ fig : medial ] ) . various arguments ( see _ e.g. _ @xcite ) support the statement that , in the continuum limit , the deformed model has the same behaviour as the isotropic self - dual potts model , if the angle @xmath63 is related correctly to the ratio @xmath64 .",
    "we shall obtain the following results for the deformed model :    a.   @xmath56 is holomorphic on the lattice if the spin @xmath20 satisfies the relation  .",
    "b.   there exists a linear relation between the spectral parameter @xmath43 and the angle @xmath63 .",
    "let us describe in more details the deformed geometry : the plaquettes become rhombi with internal angles @xmath65 , and the increments of @xmath66 are now @xmath67 on each plaquette .",
    "the left - hand side of has only contributions from the loop configurations in which a closed loop @xmath68 connects @xmath52 to two edges of the plaquette  @xmath11 .",
    "let @xmath50 be one such configuration , where the plaquette  @xmath11 is in configuration ( a ) of figure  [ fig : tl - bw ] , and @xmath69 the configuration differing from @xmath50 only by the configuration of the plaquette  @xmath11 .",
    "our method is to show that the contributions to the left - hand side of from @xmath70 cancel each other .",
    "there are essentially two inequivalent external connectivities of the loop outside of @xmath11 , as shown in figure  [ fig : holo - potts ] . in the case",

    "the last factor vanishes for @xmath77 .",

    "note that   is different from the usual relation @xmath82 .",
    "this can be corrected by setting the loop s angle increments on a plaquette to @xmath83 .",
    "then the system   still holds , if we set @xmath84 .",
    "the angle @xmath85 can then be tuned to recover the appropriate relation between @xmath63 and @xmath43 .",
    "the scaling limit of the self - dual potts model is described by a coulomb gas with central charge and conformal weights given by : @xmath86 where the coupling constant @xmath87 is given by @xmath88 .",
    "one can then write as @xmath89 . according to our earlier observation ,",
    "this is consistent with the fact that there are _ two _ curves meeting at the observation point @xmath13 . _ _",
    "in this section , we find solutions of the holomorphicity equations   for the @xmath3 loop model on the square lattice  @xcite .",
    "this is a dilute loop model , defined by the vertices in figure  [ fig : on - bw ] , where each closed loop carries a weight given by : @xmath90 note that we have grouped the anisotropic weights so that there is symmetry under reflections in the diagonal axes .",
    "this symmetry is preserved when the plaquettes are deformed into rhombi .",
    "since every loop configuration has an even number of plaquettes of type @xmath91 or @xmath92 , the change @xmath93 does not affect the boltzmann weights .",
    "we consider the observable  @xmath47 , defined similarly to , except that the sum is now over graphs where there is an _ oriented open path _ going from @xmath52 to @xmath13 .",
    "a similar observable has been considered by smirnov  @xcite for the case of the hexagonal lattice .",
    "now consider the contributions to the holomorphicity equation   where the first time the oriented curve , starting at @xmath52 , enters the chosen plaquette @xmath11 is through a particular edge , for example the lowermost in figure  [ fig : on - holo ] )",
    ". there are four inequivalent external connectivities as shown .",
    "we imagine these to be fixed , summing over all internal configurations consistent with them .",
    "this yields the linear system for the boltzmann weights : @xmath94 where we have set : @xmath95 . for real boltzmann weights , ( [ eq : syst - on1][eq : syst - on4 ] )",

    "\\eref{eq : syst - on4 }    \\right ] = 0\\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] thus , we can generally reduce ( [ eq : syst - on1][eq : syst - on4 ] ) to a @xmath98 real system .     connected to point @xmath52 . ]",
    "there are two classes of solutions , for vanishing and non - vanishing @xmath99 .",
    "first , if @xmath100 , then the configurations corresponding to never occur , and so this equation does not hold . in the special case @xmath101 , there exists a non - trival solution _ for any value of @xmath20 _ : @xmath102 this model can be mapped onto the six - vertex model ( see figure  [ fig : on-6v ] ) , with weights @xmath103 .",
    "the corresponding anisotropy parameter  @xcite is @xmath104 .",
    "this is an example of a model admitting a holomorphic observable on the lattice , but for which the scaling limit of the corresponding curve can not be described by simple sle .",
    "this is because , for ordinary sle , the central charge of the cft is directly related to the sle parameter @xmath15 @xcite and hence to the conformal spin @xmath20 : @xmath105 . in the present case ,",
    "since the boundary conditions for the six - vertex model are not twisted , its scaling limit has central charge @xmath106 for all @xmath107 .",
    "however the conformal spin @xmath20 varies continuously with @xmath107 .",
    "therefore the scaling limit of the curve can be sle , with @xmath108 , for at most one value ( in fact @xmath109 . )",
    "we conjecture that other values of @xmath107 correspond to sle@xmath110 .    for @xmath111 , we get a @xmath112 linear system , with determinant @xmath113 . imposing @xmath114 yields @xmath115 and in turn @xmath116 , where @xmath117 are integers .",
    "thus , for the solution to exist at any value of @xmath63 , we have to set @xmath118 .",
    "the boltzmann weights are then : @xmath119 the solution of the case @xmath120 is similar , and leads to the same boltzmann weights and spin @xmath118 .",
    "if we change the sign of @xmath121 , then the model   is equivalent to the dense loop model of section  [ sec : potts ] , with parameters @xmath122 . to see this ,",
    "fill empty spaces with loops of weight @xmath123 ( _ ghost loops _ ) .",
    "the local weights do not depend on the type of loops involved ( actual or ghost loops ) , so each loop has an overall weight @xmath124 . as a consequence , the dense loop model has a lattice antiholomorphic observable ( @xmath125 ) , besides the holomorphic one found in  @xcite .",
    "however , several arguments rule out the hypothesis that @xmath126 corresponds to an antiholomorphic field in the continuum limit .",
    "first , @xmath126 is lattice antiholomorphic for any @xmath127 , whereas it is well known that the self - dual potts model is only critical for @xmath128 .",
    "furthermore , the ratio @xmath129 in does not depend on the angle @xmath63 , which means that the same model has an antiholomorphic observable for any deformation angle : this is not acceptable physically in the continuum limit .",
    "so we conclude that , in the case @xmath100 and generic @xmath130 , the holomorphicity conditions   for the dilute @xmath3 model merely lead to the case of the dense loop model , but the corresponding @xmath47 is not a candidate for an antiholomorphic field in the continuum limit .",
    "let us now discuss the solutions of second class ( @xmath131 ) , for a generic value of @xmath132 .",
    "we get the @xmath98 real system : @xmath133 with determinant : @xmath134 .",
    "non - trival solutions exist if the spin satisfies : @xmath135 the various solutions to can be parameterised by extending the range of @xmath136 to @xmath137 $ ] , and setting : @xmath138 then , we get the second class of solutions , with boltzmann weights : @xmath139 a remarkable fact is that the weights   are a solution of the yang - baxter equations for the @xmath140 loop model on the square lattice . indeed , after a change of variables @xmath141 , coincides with the integrable weights in  @xcite .",
    "so , by solving the holomorphicity equations  ( [ eq : syst - on1][eq : syst - on4 ] ) on a deformed lattice , we recovered the integrable weights .",
    "now we interpret our findings in terms of cft .",
    "first , in the regime @xmath142 ( branches 1 and 2 in @xcite ) , on the basis of numerical diagonalisation of the transfer - matrix  @xcite and analysis of the bethe ansatz equations @xcite , it has been argued that the model   has the same continuum limit as the @xmath3 model on the hexagonal lattice  @xcite : it is described by a coulomb gas of coupling constant @xmath143 , with central charge and critical exponents given by .",
    "the value of the spin can then be written as @xmath144 . in the regime @xmath145 ,",
    "the continuum limit is no longer described by a simple coulomb gas .",
    "rather , it has central charge : @xmath146 where @xmath147 .",
    "the relation between @xmath20   and @xmath148  , which is @xmath149 , is not consistent with sle , so this is another example of a model with a holomorphic observable whose curves are not described by simple sle .",
    "note that in this case @xmath148 may be greater than one , so some variant of sle such as that considered by bettelheim _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite may be the correct description .",
    "a simple generalisation of the loop model of section  [ sec : potts ] to a model with two loop colours was introduced in  @xcite .",
    "it is a dense loop model on the square lattice , where each loop can be either black or grey , and carries a weight @xmath132 given by : @xmath90 the vertices of the model are shown in figure  [ fig : c21-bw ] . for fixed @xmath132 ,",
    "the model has a one - parameter family of boltzmann weights that satisfy the yang - baxter equations  @xcite .    to describe the observable @xmath47 that will be shown to be holomorphic",
    ", we first introduce a special kind of defect in the loop model : this defect sits on the midpoint of a plaquette edge , and consists in a change of colour for the loop passing through .",
    "the observable  @xmath47 is then defined similarly to , except that the sum is now over graphs  @xmath50 where @xmath52 and @xmath13 belong to the same loop , and each of these points carries a defect .",
    "the angle  @xmath53 is defined as the sum of the windings of each loop strand from @xmath52 to @xmath13 . for a given plaquette  @xmath11 in ,",
    "the graphs that contribute are those for which two edges of the plaquette  @xmath11 are connected to the point @xmath52 , and one edge contains a defect .",
    "the holomorphicity conditions   yield the system : @xmath151 where we have set : @xmath152 . for real boltzmann weights , we have the linear relation : @xmath153 = 0\\,.\\ ] ] thus , for @xmath154 , we can ignore @xmath155 , and the remaining @xmath112 real system has determinant : @xmath156 .",
    "it has a non - trivial solution for : @xmath157 there are two branches of solutions , which can be obtained by setting @xmath158 , and extending the range of @xmath136 to @xmath159 $ ] .",
    "the boltzmann weights then read : @xmath160 these are exactly the integrable weights given in @xcite , with the change of variables @xmath161 .",
    "so the @xmath150 loop model is another example where the solution of the lattice holomorphicity equations   satisfies also the yang - baxter equations .",
    "in this paper we have identified several more examples of discretely holomorphic parafermionic observables in lattice models , and shown that this requirement always appears to pick out the critical points which are also integrable in the sense of yang - baxter .",
    "it would of course be important to have a more general understanding of this .",
    "it may give a simpler route to finding new integrable models .",
    "these parafermions are natural discrete candidates for parafermionic holomorphic conformal fields in the scaling limit , and thus can also suggest new structures in particular cfts . in some cases the models we have considered correspond to cfts with @xmath162 , so the scaling limit of the corresponding curves is probably described by some modification of simple sle .",
    "the loop models we have considered may also be mapped to generalised restricted solid - on - solid ( rsos ) models , and , from this point of view , it would be interesting to understand the coset construction of the corresponding cft and its relation to the parafermionic fields .",
