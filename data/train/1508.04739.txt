    "in the past few decades , utilization of energy sources has highly been increased due to large need .",
    "the available natural resources are mostly being used to serve the purpose .",
    "the most of non - renewable natural resources ( coal , petroleum and natural gases ) have limited stock , and due to very fast consumption rate it may not be available in next fifty years . therefore , the need of alternate resources of energy which can fulfill our requirement without affecting the ecological and environmental conditions are in high demand .",
    "thermoelectric ( te ) materials are one of the best resource of clean energy , which is efficient in conversion of heat energy into electrical energy . there are various applications of te materials such as electronic component cooling , electricity production from waste heat of automobiles , infrared sensor , etc.@xmath2 the suitability of any materials for te applications are decided on the basis of their thermoelectric efficiency",
    ". this thermoelectric efficiency is defined in terms of a dimensionless parameter called as thermoelectric figure of merit @xmath3=@xmath0@xmath4@xmath5t/@xmath6 , where @xmath0 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 and t are seebeck coefficient , electrical conductivity , thermal conductivity and absolute temperature , respectively .",
    "the square dependent of @xmath0 in the zt expression makes it a very important parameter to decide the quality of materials in the te applications . from the basic physics point of view",
    "@xmath0 gives important information about carrier concentration @xmath7 , and various phase transformation , for example of martensitic transformation in metals and alloys.@xmath8 the dependency of @xmath0 on @xmath9 , and effective mass @xmath10 is useful to study the electronic phase transition driven by the change in electronic band structure.@xmath11 any changes around the fermi surface due to change in @xmath9 and @xmath12 shows the significant change in @xmath0 versus t measurement .",
    "+ seebeck coefficient ( @xmath0 ) is defined as the ratio of @xmath13v/@xmath13 t , where @xmath13v is the potential difference that arises due to temperature gradient @xmath13 t between hot and cold end of the sample .",
    "the accurate measurement of @xmath0 appears to be simple in concept , but in practice it is more complex . to obtain the experimental value of @xmath0",
    ", temperature gradient is created across the sample and induced thermoelectric voltage is measured .",
    "the accurate measurement of @xmath0 demand the simultaneous measurement of @xmath13 t and @xmath13v between same point of hot and cold end of the sample .",
    "there are two different way to measure the experimental value of @xmath0 , known as differential and integral method.@xmath14 many groups have used these two conventional methods and designed the different apparatus.@xmath15 in this conventional method accurate and simultaneous measurement of @xmath13 t and @xmath13v poses many challenges . using this method , design of the apparatus become more complex .",
    "ivory and boor et al have proposed another method in which measurement of thermal voltages across the hot and cold ends is required and value of @xmath0 is obtained by making the ratio of these two voltages.@xmath16 in this way the error in the value of @xmath0 due to inaccuracy of @xmath13 t measurement gets minimized , and also design of the apparatus becomes simple .",
    "this method also gives more accurate value of @xmath0 and have certain advantages over the conventional method used by others.@xmath15 in spite of its simplicity , this method has been adopted by few people to fabricate the apparatus for seebeck coefficient measurement , as this method is proposed in the recent past years . here",
    ", we have adopted the method given by boor et al,@xmath17 and developed a simple and low cost apparatus to measure the thermopower in the temperature range 300 - 620 k. in our designed apparatus we have used two k - type thermocouples ( tc ) to measure the thermal voltages between the hot and cold end of the sample .",
    "furthermore , the @xmath0 value of the sample is calculated by using the formula .",
    "@xmath18 where @xmath0 is the seebeck coefficient of sample , @xmath0@xmath19 is the seebeck coefficient of the tc , and @xmath20 is the seebeck coefficient of negative leg of tc . u@xmath21 and u@xmath22 are measured voltages between positive ( @xmath0 + ve ) and negative ( @xmath0 -ve ) legs of the tcs , respectively .",
    "+ the existence of small spurious voltages from the measurement system can contribute the error in seebeck coefficient of the sample .",
    "this error comes from the presence of temperature differences in electrical connections or inhomogeneities in the thermocouples .",
    "the contribution of error due to small spurious voltage is larger when temperature gradient across the sample is less than 0.1 k. for the temperature gradient more than 0.1 k , the value of seebeck coefficient converges to true sample s seebeck coefficient .",
    "the correction in seebeck coefficient value is required when the temperature gradient across the sample is less than 0.1 k and the temperature difference in the two thermocouples readings ( when they are at the same temperature ) is of the order of 0.001 k. if the temperature gradient across the sample is more than 0.2 k , then the contribution of the spurious voltage to the seebeck coefficient is small . in our case",
    ", we are using the equation ( 6 ) of boor et al . , for calculating the seebeck coefficient value . in the fabricated apparatus",
    "we can get the temperature gradient more than 1 k at the averaged sample temperature 300 k. there is self maintained temperature gradient ( 1 - 10 k ) across the sample in the averaged sample temperature range 300 - 620 k. therefore , at this temperature gradient value there is small spurious voltage contribution in the seebeck coefficient of sample .",
    "the error in the seebeck coefficient value due to small spurious voltages at large temperature gradient across the sample comes within the @xmath23 1 micro - volt / k .",
    "this is the reason we have obtained reasonably good quality of the data for nickel metal sample and the temperature dependent behavior is similar to the data reported in the literature .",
    "the schematic diagram of sample holder assembly of the apparatus is shown in fig . 1a , where different components of the equipment is represented by numbers .",
    "a very thin ( @xmath250.3 mm diameter ) k - type tcs , _ * 4@xmath265 * _ , are attached to the cu blocks , which are at the hot and cold end of the sample , respectively .",
    "thermocouples are securely fixed using high temperature silver paste on the each face of cu blocks , which are very close ( @xmath250.5 mm distance ) from the sample end , and it is used to measure the averaged sample temperature as well as voltages u@xmath21 and u@xmath22 .",
    "the region around the point of contact of the two k - type thermocouples on each face of cu blocks is shown in figure 1(b ) . to maintain the good thermal contact , throughout the measurement",
    ", we employ a spring loading mechanism , which is at top of the cu block , * _ 2 _ * , and away from the hot zone .",
    "pressure is applied on the cu block , _ * 2 * _ , by a brass rod , * _ 6 _ * , which is supported by the stainless steel frame , _ * 7*_. the other end of the brass rod is attached with the stainless spring , _ * 9 * _ , which essentially provides the pressure on the sample during the experiment .",
    "+ sample holder assembly shown in fig 1a , consist of two brass plates ( * 11@xmath2616 * ) having the dimensions of length 50 mm , breadth 40 mm , and thickness 7 mm",
    ". the bottom brass plate ( * 11 * ) act as a base for holding the sample platform , ceramic heater and spring loading arrangement .",
    "further , these two brass plates are well connected mechanically by using four brass rods of equal dimensions ( diameter 6 mm and length 17 cm ) .",
    "these four brass rods act as a supporting pillar .",
    "since these two plates are connected symmetrically to each other , therefore it provides a more stable position for sample holder assembly .",
    "the whole sample holder assembly is inserted in the vacuum chamber by using the mild steel ( ms ) rod ( of dimensions- length 16.5 cm , diameter 15 mm ) .",
    "the sample holder assembly is axially balanced by ms rod , as one end of this rod is connected at the center of the upper brass plate ( * 16 * ) and other end of ms rod is connected to the center of vacuum flange , which is held at the top of the vacuum chamber . in this way the sample holder probe achieves more lateral stability . as shown in fig .",
    "1b , the whole sample probe having dimensions of about 45 cm in length and 50 mm in width is inserted into the ms vacuum chamber . the cylindrical ms vacuum chamber ( height 50 cm , i.d .",
    "76 mm , o.d .",
    "70 mm ) is sufficient to prevent the sample and cu blocks from oxidation , and it also minimizes the heat loss due to convective heat exchange . the vacuum chamber evacuated with the help of rotary vacuum pump , and vacuum level of 0.017 mbar is obtained .",
    "all the electrical connections are made by using the electrical feedthrough .",
    "+ to achieve the desired temperature of the sample we have designed resistive heater , _ * 12*_. the cu blocks are kept inside the ceramic tube onto which kanthal wire ( 0.6 mm diameter ) is winded .",
    "the heater is mounted on a movable brass ring , _ * 13 * _ , so that the mean position of the sample with respect to the centre of heater can be adjusted with the help of mechanical knob , _ * 14*_. the mechanical lifting arrangement , _ * 15 * _ , helps to do initial positioning of the heater for getting the suitable temperature gradient across the sample .",
    "the design of the heater and its variable positioning allows to do the initial setting of heater position such that it provides the self maintained temperature gradient throughout the measurement .",
    "although , we can do the initial positioning of the heater for suitable temperature gradient , however , the selection of appropriate thickness of the sample can also play an important role to control the temperature gradient indirectly .",
    "the temperature gradient across the sample having more thickness and low thermal conductivity will be larger .",
    "+ the measurement procedure in our setup is quite similar to the one described by boor _ _ et al.__@xmath17 to measure the @xmath0 , thermal gradient is generated across the sample . to create the thermal gradient ,",
    "the temperature of the heater is raised manually by using the crown made dual output dc regulated power supply ( range 0 - 30v/5a ) .",
    "it is important to note that , no direct control of temperature gradient is required during the measurement process . to assure the temperature gradient across the hot and cold ends of sample",
    ", the temperature is measured using two thermocouples ( * 4@xmath265 * ) .",
    "the upper cu block , _ * 2 * _ , is connected to spring loading arrangement through ceramic bead , _ * 8 * _ , which acts as thermal insulator . thus heat loss due to conduction gets minimized and heat gets shielded at hot end side of the sample .",
    "the lower cu block , _ * 3 * _ , is in physical contact with ms platform , _ * 10 * _ , which is placed on the brass plate . therefore , heat loss takes place for the cold end side of the sample through conduction process .",
    "this arrangement helps to get the self maintained temperature gradient between hot and cold end of the sample .",
    "the average sample temperature is measured manually by using the digital multimeter and two tcs . the u@xmath21 and u@xmath22 voltages are measured by using the same tcs connected to the two channels of keithley 2182a nanovoltmeter . + the nanovoltmeter is interfaced to the computer by using the labview graphical program .",
    "the experimentally measured quantities u@xmath21 and u@xmath22 are used to calculate the value of @xmath0 with the help of eq .",
    "the time difference between each set of the measurement for u@xmath21 and u@xmath22 is 0.2 second .",
    "for each averaged sample temperature , we take 20 set of measurement for u@xmath21 and u@xmath22 , and calculate the average value of @xmath0 . during this experimental time , the thermal gradient remains almost same and the maximum change in the average sample temperature is observed to be less than 1 k. this process minimizes the noise and improve the quality of data . + in order to calibrate the instrument , we have used the high purity ( 99.99 ) ni metal of 6 mm diameter and about 2 mm thickness .     of pure nickel as a function of temperature.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=45.0% ] [ ]",
    "the experimental data have been collected in the temperature range 300 - 620 k in the interval of @xmath255 k. the temperature dependence of @xmath0 is shown in the fig .",
    "2 . from the @xmath0 vs t graph , we observe that the value of @xmath0 at 300 k is -19.15 @xmath27v / k and it decreases continuously to the minimum value of -25.84 @xmath27v / k at @xmath25487 k. the change in the value of @xmath0 is about 7 @xmath27v / k in 300 - 487 k temperature range .",
    "the value of @xmath0 sharply increases above 487 k , and it has the value of -20.62 @xmath27v / k at about 620 k. the change of about 5 @xmath27v / k is observed in the temperature range 487 - 620 k. to compare the temperature dependent behavior of @xmath0 obtained from our set up with the data reported in the literature , we have plotted the literature data in the same graph .",
    "the data obtained by ponnambalam et al . , and abadlia et al . , are inserted in to the fig . 2 by extracting the data point value using the digitization technique .",
    "it is important to notice that digitization process always have an inherent error in data selection from the literature graph . in our case",
    ", we expect the maximum error of about 0.5 @xmath27v / k in the literature data due to digitization .",
    "therefore , the difference of @xmath251 @xmath27v / k observed in between the literature data and data obtained by our setup may be due to contribution of digitization error .",
    "the temperature dependent behavior of @xmath0 and change in its magnitude in the temperature range 300 - 620 k is very similar to those reported in the literature.@xmath24 our designed setup is useful to characterize the materials in disk or rod shaped .",
    "the materials used for the measurement by our setup have the pallet having thickness from 0.5 mm to 2 mm and diameter of 5 mm to 10 mm .",
    "it is our believe that other samples of disk or rod shaped with similar dimensions can be well characterized .",
    "the present sample probe design is appropriate for sample with cross section comparable with the two surrounding copper blocks ( in order to minimize the thermal contact resistance ) . at this point , it is important to note that the cross section of the cu blocks is about 10 mm and the sample cross section is about 6 mm .",
    "the sample cross section is about 4 mm less than the cross section of two cu blocks .",
    "the difference in the cross - section between the sample and the cu block may lead to thermal contact resistance which normally affects the data quality .",
    "however , in the present case we obtained good quality data .",
    "moreover , the two cu blocks surrounding the sample are replaceable",
    ". thus one can always replace these two cu blocks with the another set of cu blocks of suitable cross - section wherever one faces the problem of thermal contact resistance .",
    "in current design there is also possibility that the fragile sample may break .",
    "a sample of good thermal conducting properties is more suitable for characterization as it have temperature gradient ( 1 - 10 k ) across the sample .",
    "however , the movable platform for heater allow us to set the sample center position to get the suitable temperature gradient",
    ". the sample with low thermal conductivity will have a large temperature gradient when the averaged sample temperature is above 100 @xmath28c .",
    "the large temperature gradient will give the error in the averaged sample temperature as it is the average of the two temperatures i.e. hot and cold end of the sample .",
    "thus any electronic phase transition occurs in the narrow temperature range will not be probe accurately .",
    "the measurement without any sample gives a value of 0.5 - 1.0 @xmath27v / k in the temperature range 300 - 620 k , therefore thermoelectric materials having higher value of @xmath0 can well be characterized by using this setup .",
    "+ now we are going to use the designed apparatus to study the thermoelectric property of lacoo@xmath1 samples with different crystallite sizes .",
    "we have chosen the lacoo@xmath1 sample due to its semiconducting to metal transition behavior about 540 k.@xmath29 this compound belongs to thermoelectric oxides materials and have very large variations in thermopower in the temperature range 300 - 600 k.@xmath29 the thermopower measurement of oxide thermoelectric materials will give more versatility and characterization capability of the fabricated setup .",

    "the @xmath0 value at 300 k is observed about 645 , 635 , 245 and -304 @xmath27v / k for the samples sintered at 800@xmath28c , 1000@xmath28c , 1100@xmath28c , and 1200@xmath28c , respectively .",
    "however , at higher temperature , i.e. about 600 k , @xmath0 value is almost same for all the samples . at 600 k , value of @xmath0",
    "is observed about 46 @xmath27v / k for all the samples .",
    "the high temperature thermoelectric behaviour shows that the value of @xmath0 and its sign changes with sintering temperature .",
    "this observation of large positive and a large negative thermoelectric power in undoped lacoo@xmath1 samples may be due to oxygen off - stoichiometry as the samples were prepared in air atmosphere . in this work",
    "it has been observed that centred of oxygen stoichiometry can open a new opportunity for tuning the thermoelectric behavior of the oxide compounds , which will be more useful for high temperature thermoelectric applications .",
