    "the high depletion factors found for fe in the interstellar medium ( ism ) , down to @xmath5 @xcite , and the relatively high cosmic abundance of this element , imply that fe is a very important contributor to the mass of refractory dust grains @xcite .",
    "the high depletion factors also imply that the destruction of a small quantity of dust grains will translate into a significant , i.e. measurable , increase of the fe abundance in the gaseous phase .",
    "hence , the study of the fe abundance in the gas of different regions where different conditions prevail can be used to identify the processes that govern the evolution of dust in the ism . in the diffuse ism",
    ", the depletion patterns found for all available elements , including fe , have led to the identification of shock waves as the main destruction mechanism of dust ( @xcite and references therein ) . in regions , the lack of strong lines from other refractory elements and the reasons outlined above imply that fe is the best choice to study depletion trends .",
    "such a study , based on the fe abundances measured in several galactic regions , suggests that energetic photons are responsible for the destruction of some dust grains in these nebulae @xcite .",
    "fe is expected to be in three ionization states in regions : @xmath6 , so that the measurement of , , and emission lines will allow us to determine the fe abundance in these nebulae . [ ] and [ ] lines , although weak , have already been observed in several regions and starburst galaxies ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "most of the optical [ ] lines are affected by fluorescence effects @xcite , but the fe@xmath7 abundance can be estimated from a few lines that are almost insensitive to fluorescence . the fe@xmath7 abundance turns out to be low in most of the regions studied to date @xcite , as expected from the low ionization potential for this ion ( 16.2 ev ) . on the other hand , [ ]",
    "lines are much weaker than [ ] and [ ] lines and hence very difficult to observe .",
    "therefore , the fe abundance in regions is usually obtained from [ ] lines and an ionization - correction factor ( @xmath8 ) , derived from photoionization models , to account for the contribution of fe@xmath1 .",
    "the relation @xmath9 where @xmath10 stands for the ionization fraction of the @xmath11 ion , is especially well suited for determining the fe abundance from optical observations of regions , since ( 1 ) the ionization potentials of the o and fe ions are similar ( 30.6 and 54.8 ev for fe@xmath0 and fe@xmath1 , 35.3 and 54.9 ev for o@xmath7 and o@xmath0 ) , and ( 2 ) both o@xmath7 and o@xmath0 can be measured from strong optical lines and one can get the o abundance @xmath12 , and hence also @xmath13 from @xmath14 .",
    "the values of the above @xmath8 and their dependence , if any , with the degree of ionization can be found using grids of photoionization models .",
    "the available grids of models @xcite imply that a constant value for this @xmath8 , @xmath15 , should provide a good estimate of the total fe abundance to within @xmath16  dex",
    ".    however , available measurements of some weak [ ] lines @xcite imply fe@xmath1 abundances that are smaller , by factors 38 , than the values implied by equation ( [ eq1 ] ) with an @xmath8 equal to 1.1 .",
    "this `` [ ] discrepancy '' translates into an uncertainty of up to a factor of 5 in the fe abundances derived for a wide range of objects , from the nearby orion nebula to the low metallicity blue compact galaxy sbs  0335@xmath4052 .",
    "thus , the discrepancy has important implications for our understanding of the evolution of dust in regions , the dependence of dust depletion factors on metallicity , and the chemical history of low metallicity dwarf galaxies .    in this paper",
    "we study the ionization equilibrium of fe using photoionization models that incorporate recently improved values for all the atomic data relevant to the problem .",
    "we compare the new model results with the available observational data , discuss the possible reasons behind the [ ] discrepancy , and study its effect on the reliability of the derived fe abundances .",
    "we have used the photoionization code nebula ( see , e.g , @xcite and references therein ) to calculate a grid of spherically symmetric models of constant density ionized by a single star .",
    "we use this grid to determine the value of @xmath17 , the @xmath8 in equation ( [ eq1 ] ) , and its dependence on the degree of ionization given by @xmath18 .",
    "we have updated nebula with the atomic data derived recently from improved calculations that are relevant to the problem : photoionization cross sections for fe@xmath7 , fe@xmath0 , o@xmath19 and o@xmath7 @xcite , recombination coefficients for fe@xmath0 , fe@xmath1 , o@xmath7 and o@xmath0 @xcite , the charge - exchange reactions involving these ions ( @xcite ; and the ornl / uga charge transfer database for astrophysics ) ; and the nlte model stellar atmospheres of @xcite for solar metallicity with surface gravity @xmath20 .",
    "the photoionization cross section of fe@xmath7 was constructed using both the calculated values of @xcite and the experimental ones of @xcite , following the prescriptions given by the later authors .",
    "other recent upgrades to the code are described by @xcite .",
    "our grid of 36 models covers the following parameter space : effective temperature of the ionizing star @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , and 50000  k ; total nucleon density @xmath24 , 1000 , and @xmath25  @xmath26 ; and `` orion metallicity '' z@xmath27 ( @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 ) , z@xmath37 , and z@xmath38 .",
    "all the fluxes of the ionizing stars were normalized to get a total number of ionizing photons s@xmath39 for hydrogen of @xmath40 , but we checked that this has no effect on the @xmath8 : we ran two new models with @xmath41 ionizing photons s@xmath39 and found that they follow the same trend of @xmath17 versus @xmath42 defined by the original grid .",
    "this same consistent behavior was found when we used one of the supergiant models of @xcite , with @xmath43  k and @xmath44 , as the ionizing star .",
    "the photoionization cross sections for the o and , especially , the fe ions show some sharply peaked resonances arising from excitations to autoionizing states ( quasi - bound states , above the ionization threshold ) . the energies at which these resonances occur , their widths and their peak intensities can be uncertain by a few percent or more , as seen in the direct comparison with experimental data in the few instances where the later are available ( e.g. @xcite for o@xmath45 and fe@xmath45 , respectively ) . for this reason , and for reasons of computational ease ,",
    "the photoionization cross sections are usually smoothed or fitted with simple functions .",
    "we used the analytic fits of @xcite for o@xmath19 and o@xmath7 , and , following @xcite , we smoothed the photoionization cross sections for fe@xmath7 and fe@xmath0 doing a convolution with a gaussian of width 3% the energy .",
    "the fluxes of the stellar atmospheres were also smoothed by convolving with a gaussian of width 1% the energy .",
    "figure  [ sgv ] shows the values of the @xmath8 in equation ( [ eq1 ] ) , @xmath46 , obtained from various models as a function of the degree of ionization given by @xmath47 .",
    "the results of previous ionization models @xcite for metallicities that go from solar to 1/50 of solar , are also shown for comparison .",
    "our new models show lower values for the @xmath8 , and a small dependence with the degree of ionization .",
    "it can also be seen in figure  [ sgv ] that the results for solar or near solar metallicity show slightly larger values for the @xmath8 than the results for lower metallicities .",
    "this is due to the relatively high optical depth reached in the outer parts of these solar - metallicity models at the o@xmath45 ionization edge . at lower metallicities",
    "this optical depth becomes negligible .",
    "this dependence on the metallicity is small and will not be further considered .",
    "a least - squares fit to the new model results in figure  [ sgv ] leads to the ionization - correction scheme : @xmath48",
    "the @xmath8 implied by the models can be compared with the values derived empirically for the handful of objects where the observed spectra include any [ ] line ( along with diagnostic lines , [ ] , [ ] , and [ ] lines ) . to the objects considered by @xcite",
    ", we have added several objects where [ ]  @xmath49 has been observed recently : the regions m42 @xcite and ngc  3576 @xcite , and three of the planetary nebulae ( pne ) observed by @xcite : ngc  6210 , ngc  6826 , and ngc  6884 .",
    "@xcite provided the intensities of other [ ] lines in some objects , but all of them are blends or possible misidentifications .    physical conditions and ionic abundances have been derived following the same procedure outlined in @xcite , except that the new values for the fe@xmath1 transition probabilities of @xcite have been used for all the objects .",
    "the fe@xmath1 abundances implied by these new data differ from the values presented by @xcite by less than 20% .",
    "table  [ t1 ] shows the physical conditions used in the abundance determination ; table  [ t2 ] shows the ionic and total abundances derived for all the objects . in all the objects but two ( n88a and sbs  0335@xmath4052 ) , the abundances have been derived with the usual two - zone scheme : we used the electron temperature implied by the [ ] diagnostic lines , @xmath50 [ ] , to derive the o@xmath0 and fe@xmath1 abundances , and @xmath50 [ ] to derive the o@xmath45 and fe@xmath0 abundances . in n88a and sbs",
    "0335@xmath4052 , we used @xmath50 [ ] to derive all ionic abundances .",
    "we could have used instead an uncertain estimate of @xmath50 [ ] obtained from @xmath50 [ ] and one of the existing relations between the two @xmath50 s ( either empirical or derived from photoionization models ) , but this would not change our results in a significant way .",
    "for example , with the relation of @xcite we obtain @xmath51}=12\\,900 $ ]  k in n88a  bar .",
    "if we had used this @xmath50 instead of @xmath52}=14\\,200 $ ]  k to derive the o@xmath45 and fe@xmath0 abundances in this object , the total fe and o abundances presented in table  [ t2 ] would change by less than 0.05  dex , and the value of any of the ionic ratios we will be considering would remain within the error bars .    as in @xcite",
    ", it has been assumed that @xmath53 , @xmath54 , and that the fe@xmath45 abundance is negligible in those objects showing a high degree of ionization .",
    "the spectra of the pne and sbs  0335@xmath4052 show some lines from high ionization ions , such as [ ] , [ ] , [ ] or [ ] , but we expect that only traces of these ions are likely to be present in our sample objects .",
    "@xcite calculated @xmath55 from the [ ] line at @xmath56  @xmath57 m measured by the infrared space observatory ( _ iso _ ) in ngc  6884 .",
    "this @xmath58 abundance is just 8% of our adopted o abundance . @xcite",
    "also estimated that the contribution of @xmath58 to the total abundance would be @xmath3 times lower for ngc  6210 and completely negligible for ngc  6826 .",
    "furthermore , since @xmath59 has an ionization potential very close to that of @xmath60 ( @xmath61 and @xmath62  ev , respectively ) , @xmath63 is not likely to have a significant concentration .",
    "similar considerations , based on the @xmath64 ratio , were used by @xcite to conclude that the concentrations of @xmath58 and @xmath63 are likely to be very low for the other high ionization objects .",
    "the values of @xmath46 versus @xmath47 implied by the results in table  [ t2 ] are compared with the model results in figure  [ ru ] .",
    "the new model results , although closer to the measured values than were the previous model predictions , are still unable to explain the measured values .",
    "we constructed additional models with a different geometry , where the ionized gas is located in a shell around the star .",
    "we used z@xmath37 , @xmath65 and @xmath66  k , @xmath24 , 1000 , and @xmath25  @xmath26 , and internal radii for the shell in the range 0.15.4 pc .",
    "typical results , shown in figure  [ ru ] as stars , are very close to those obtained from the spherical models .",
    "we also calculated the @xmath8 implied by different lines of sight through the spherical model with z@xmath37 , @xmath65  k , and @xmath24  @xmath26 .",
    "the results followed the same trend defined by the shell models , and did not help in explaining the discrepancy .",
    "hence , we did not pursue this approach further .",
    "one could also speculate that the discrepancy is due to the fact that we are comparing simple constant - density models with complex real objects .",
    "@xcite found that this can lead to significant errors in ratios like @xmath47 .",
    "however , according to the models , fe@xmath0 and o@xmath45 should have similar concentrations , and [ ] and [ ] lines should form in similar regions in the nebula , and hence these ions should be affected by similar systematic effects .",
    "@xcite discussed the most likely explanations of this discrepancy , namely , errors in the collision strengths used to derive the fe@xmath0 and fe@xmath1 abundances or errors in the @xmath8 derived from models , probably arising from errors in the input parameters governing the ionization equilibrium .",
    "if the model - predicted @xmath8 is seriously wrong , then the trend defined in figure  [ ru ] by the observed objects will lead to an @xmath8 that should be more reliable than the one predicted by the model results .",
    "the trend is only clearly defined for those objects whose degree of ionization is within the range covered by the models ( i.e. with @xmath67 above @xmath68 ) .",
    "we note that since our photoionization models are tailored for regions , the highest @xmath69 we are considering is @xmath66  k. for this @xmath69 , there are very few ionizing photons with energies above @xmath70  ev and o@xmath0 and fe@xmath1 ( both with ionization potentials above 54  ev ) are not expected to be substantially further ionized .",
    "the three objects with higher degree of ionization in figure  [ ru ] are pne , where the central stars can reach or surpass @xmath69 of @xmath71  k. even if these objects do not have significant concentrations of either o@xmath1 or fe@xmath72 , as discussed above , they might have small amounts of these ions that could lead to a change in the trend followed by the @xmath8 with @xmath67 . hence , a change in the trend at @xmath73 does not seem unlikely .",
    "thus we limit the relationship to define an @xmath8 for lower degrees of ionization .",
    "a least - squares linear fit to the data for those objects with @xmath74 in figure  [ ru ] leads to the ionization - correction scheme : @xmath75 which should be valid for @xmath76 . for @xmath77 , the concentrations of fe@xmath0 and o@xmath45 will grow , making these ions the dominant ionization states , and a constant @xmath8",
    ": @xmath78 would be the preferred choice .",
    "the contribution of fe@xmath45 will still be very small for most objects @xcite . in   [ why ] we consider what changes in the relevant input parameters that affect the ionization equilibrium of the models would be needed to explain the discrepancy .",
    "changes in the values of the collision strengths are considered in ",
    "the @xmath8 implied by the photoionization models depends on the following factors : ( 1 ) the number of photoionizations of fe@xmath0 and o@xmath7 , which in turn depends on the photoionization cross sections for these ions and on the spectral energy distribution of the ionizing flux , ( 2 ) the number of radiative and dielectronic recombinations of fe@xmath1 and o@xmath0 , which depends on the recombination coefficients , and ( 3 ) the rate of the charge - exchange reactions leading to recombinations of fe@xmath1 and o@xmath0 .",
    "the smoothing of the photoionization cross sections and the stellar atmospheres could introduce errors in the number of photoionizations computed in the models . in order to constrain these errors , we calculated the number of photoionizations of fe@xmath0 implied by the original stellar fluxes and photoionization cross section of fe@xmath0 by integrating the product of these two quantities between @xmath79  ev , the ionization potential of fe@xmath0 , and @xmath80  ev , the ionization potential of he@xmath45 and the maximum energy considered in the photoionization models .",
    "we compared the result with the number of photoionizations implied by the smoothed stellar fluxes and found that the original value was 1% lower than the smoothed one for @xmath81  k and 18 , 6 , and 9% higher for @xmath43 , @xmath23 , and 50000  k , respectively .",
    "these differences are far too small to change our results in a significant way .",
    "we consider now the effect of changes in the stellar ionizing flux .",
    "the ionizing fluxes could be wrong because of uncertainties in the stellar atmosphere models , or because we are using the results for models with solar metallicity whereas lower metallicities might be more appropriate .",
    "we can constrain the kind of changes we need to check by noting that the smoothed photoionization cross sections for fe@xmath0 and o@xmath7 are very similar for energies above the o@xmath7 ionization threshold ( fig .  [",
    "therefore , only a change in the ionizing flux in the energy range between the two ionization thresholds ( i.e. between @xmath82 and @xmath83 ev ) can have a significant effect on the @xmath8 .",
    "a lower ionizing flux in this energy range will change the @xmath8 in the right direction to solve the discrepancy .",
    "we did a test with two of the model atmospheres , dividing their fluxes by factors of up to a factor of ten in the energy interval of interest ( see fig .  [ at ] ) , thus bringing the fluxes in this interval very close to zero .",
    "we achieved this by dividing the fluxes by the function @xmath84 $ ] , where e is the energy in ry .",
    "we ran two models using these new stellar fluxes ( with @xmath24  @xmath26 and z@xmath85 ) , and found that the decrease in the @xmath8 was @xmath86 dex , far too small to explain the discrepancy .",
    "we believe that this rules out any uncertainty in the stellar ionizing flux distributions as the main cause behind the discrepancy .",
    "we are then left with errors in the atomic data governing the ionization equilibrium of o and fe as the possible explanations of the discrepancy . since the fe ions are more complex than the o ions , their atomic data are more difficult to calculate and hence more uncertain .",
    "we will center our discussion on the effects of changes in the ionization and recombination data for fe .",
    "changes in the data for o going in the opposite direction from those we will consider for the fe data would also help in explaining the discrepancy , but we note that the discrepancy was first discovered as related to fe by considering tailor - made models for m42 , i.e. , the discrepancy seems to be independent of the degree of ionization given by the o ions @xcite .",
    "we consider the @xmath87 ionization equilibrium , since fe@xmath45 has a low concentration in all the objects of our sample . at a given point in a nebula , the ionization - equilibrium equation for these two ions",
    "is given by ( see , e.g. @xcite ) : @xmath88 where @xmath89 is the volume density of @xmath90 , @xmath91 is the mean intensity of the radiation field at the point , @xmath92 is the photoionization cross section for fe@xmath0 , @xmath93 is the total ( radiative plus dielectronic ) recombination coefficient of @xmath59 , and @xmath94 is the rate coefficient of the charge - exchange reaction @xmath95 .    for a given @xmath47 we can get a lower value of the @xmath8 @xmath46 by decreasing the photoionization cross section for fe@xmath0 or increasing either the recombination coefficient of fe@xmath1 or the rate of the aforementioned charge - exchange reaction .",
    "we selected two models to use as templates .",
    "they are ionized by stars with @xmath43  k and @xmath40 ionizing photons s@xmath39 , and @xmath96  k , @xmath41 ionizing photons s@xmath39 ; both have @xmath24  @xmath26 and z@xmath37 .",
    "we then tested sequentially the effect on the results of these models of changes by a factor of 2 in the photoionization cross section , and by factors of 2 and 10 in each of the recombination coefficient and the rate of the charge - exchange reaction .",
    "we did not consider a change by a factor of 10 in the photoionization cross section of fe@xmath0 because the comparisons of calculated cross sections with the available experimental data ( e.g. @xcite for o@xmath45 and fe@xmath45 , respectively ) usually show better agreement .",
    "the results from the two model templates and from the test calculations are shown as connected open circles in figure  [ cha ] , where it can be seen that a change by a factor of 10 in the recombination data will be needed in order to reproduce the observed results .",
    "a factor of 10 uncertainty would not be unexpected for the dielectronic part of a recombination coefficient or for the rate of a charge - exchange reaction @xcite .",
    "figure  [ cham]a shows the comparison between the @xmath46 @xmath8 implied by models and observations when either the derived fe@xmath0 abundances are divided by a factor @xmath97 or the fe@xmath1 abundances are multiplied by the same factor .",
    "figure  [ cham]b shows the same comparison for @xmath98 as a function of @xmath47 .",
    "it can be seen that this factor of 2.5 change in the relative abundances of fe@xmath0 and fe@xmath1 would lead to an agreement between observations and models .",
    "it might then look promising that the recent calculations of collision strengths for fe@xmath0 by @xcite differ from the previous results we are using here @xcite by factors up to 2 .",
    "this new atomic data might then imply fe@xmath0 abundances lower by a factor of 2 , thus reducing the discrepancy in fig .",
    "however , @xcite calculate the collision strengths only for transitions between terms , whereas the fine - structure values are needed to derive fe@xmath0 abundances and , most important in the present context , to check their reliability by comparing the predicted relative line intensities with the observed ones .",
    "the atomic data we are using here for [ ] do seem to be reliable , since they lead to consistent abundances for the various [ ] lines ( @xcite ) and , when the [ ] lines are used as an electron density diagnostic , they lead to values similar to those implied by the usual diagnostics such as [ ] , [ ] or [ ] @xcite .",
    "however , it is possible to preserve this consistency while changing the values of the collision strengths so that they lead to lower fe@xmath0 abundances .",
    "since the upper levels of the optical [ ] lines are mainly populated through collisional transitions from the ground term , the relative intensities of the lines we are considering will not change significantly if all the collision strengths for transitions originating in the ground term are changed by a similar factor .",
    "it is therefore suggestive that all the term - averaged collision strengths of @xcite for transitions from the ground term are lower than the results given by @xcite by factors @xmath99 .",
    "a test calculation shows that if the collision strengths of @xcite for transitions from the ground term are enhanced by a factor of 2 , the [ ] line ratios remain mostly unaffected and the fe@xmath0 abundances are lower by a factor of @xmath99 .",
    "hence , this change in the fe@xmath0 collisional data would explain most , if not all , the discrepancy .",
    "new calculations that provide the collision strengths for the fine - structure levels will be extremely valuable in order to test this idea .",
    "on the other hand , the discrepancy might be due to errors in the atomic data for fe@xmath1 , which are difficult to test through a comparison between observed and predicted relative line intensities because the lines are very weak and difficult to measure .",
    "our new model results along with the new observational results for m42 and , especially , for ngc  3576 in figure  [ ru ] , which are very close to the expected ones , allow us to rule out the large uncertainties in the collision strengths , of factors 67 , contemplated by @xcite , and to settle for changes by factors 23 .",
    "a comparison between the results in figures  [ cha ] and [ cham ] shows that both the explanation involving errors in the collision strengths of fe@xmath1 or fe@xmath0 by a factor 23 and the explanation requiring a change in the recombination data for fe@xmath1 ( the recombination coefficient or the rate of the charge - exchange reaction with h@xmath100 ) by a factor of 10 look equally plausible ( it must be taken into account that the model results show some dispersion around their defined trends ) . of course , the final explanation for the discrepancy might require a combination of causes , but the fact that we can not decide on the most likely or on the more important one , introduces an uncertainty in the fe abundances calculated for the various objects . in the next section ,",
    "we assess this uncertainty and try to see what constraints we can place on the fe abundance in the nebulae of our sample .",
    "the last two columns in table  [ t2 ] show the fe abundances derived for all the objects from the sum of the ionic abundances ( col .  [ 8 ] ) and from the fe@xmath0 abundance and the @xmath8 ( see eq .",
    "[ [ eq2 ] ] ) implied by our photoionization models ( col .  [ 9 ] ) .",
    "if the model predicted @xmath8 is seriously wrong , the best values for the fe abundance will be those shown in column  ( 8) ; if the discrepancy is only due to errors in the fe@xmath1 collision strengths , the best values will be those in column  ( 9 ) ; and if the discrepancy is mainly due to errors in the fe@xmath0 collision strengths by the factor of @xmath99 suggested by the calculations of @xcite ( see   [ col ] ) , the best values will be those shown in column  ( 9 ) lowered by @xmath101  dex .",
    "figure  [ dep ] shows the depletion factors for the fe / o abundance ratio ( @xmath102=\\log(\\mbox{fe}/\\mbox{o})-\\log(\\mbox{fe}/\\mbox{o})_\\odot$ ] ) implied by these three possibilities as a function of the o / h abundance ratio .",
    "we note that if the discrepancy is due to some combination of the aforementioned causes , the errors required in any of the atomic data are likely to be lower than those considered above , and the depletion factors will consequently be intermediate between those shown in the three panels of figure  [ dep ] .",
    "we use fe / o to calculate depletion factors because our objects have different metallicities ( see the values of the o / h abundance ratio in table  [ t2 ] ) but are likely to have a near solar value for fe / o ( considering the abundances in gas and dust ) , or at least , their intrinsic fe / o abundance will show less variation than either o / h or fe / h . indeed , the fe / o abundance ratio has been found to be near solar or slightly ( @xmath103  dex ) below solar for the magellanic clouds and for other low - metallicity dwarf galaxies ( see e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite , and references therein ) .",
    "we have used @xmath104 , a value that agrees to within @xmath105  dex with recent determinations of the solar fe and o abundances @xcite .",
    "even if we do not know which are the correct values for the nebular fe abundances , several things can be inferred from the results in figure  [ dep ] .",
    "since we are considering quite extreme variations of the atomic data entering in the abundance determinations , we can use the range of abundances as a reasonable constraint on the true fe abundances .",
    "an inspection of the depletion factors in figure  [ dep ] shows that the galactic regions ( m42 , ngc  3576 ) and pne ( ic  4846 , ngc  6210 , ngc  6826 , and ngc  6884 ) have depletion factors in the range @xmath106 to @xmath107 , intermediate between the values observed for warm and cold clouds in the galactic ism , where typical depletion factors are @xmath108 and @xmath109 , respectively @xcite .",
    "thus most of the fe atoms are in dust grains in these nebulae : less than @xmath110% of their total fe abundance is present in the gas .",
    "the depletion factor in lmc  30  doradus , where the metallicity is about @xmath111  dex lower , is at the higher end of the above range , @xmath112 . in smc",
    "n88a , with about @xmath113  dex lower metallicity than in the galactic objects , the depletion factor is lower , in the range @xmath114 to @xmath115 .",
    "the blue compact galaxy sbs  0335@xmath4052 , with a metallicity @xmath106  dex below those of the galactic nebulae , shows a somewhat lower depletion , in the range @xmath116 to @xmath117 .",
    "the depletions could be somewhat lower for the metal - poor objects if their intrinsic fe / o abundance ratios are below solar , as commented above .",
    "this trend of higher depletions at higher metallicities , which was also shown to hold for a smaller sample of objects by @xcite , is consistent with what we know about depletion factors in the ism of the magellanic clouds @xcite and with a recent measurement of the gas to dust ratio in the smc @xcite .",
    "a similar trend has been found to hold for damped ly@xmath118 systems @xcite .",
    "the trend could arise from a low efficiency of dust - formation processes at low metallicities or , at least for the objects in our sample , from a high dust - destruction rate due to the harsh radiation fields usually found in metal - poor galaxies .",
    "further measurements of both [ ] and [ ] lines in a sample of metal - poor galaxies would help to constrain this issue .",
    "we note that the depleted fe atoms are not likely to be in the form of silicates in n88a .",
    "@xcite did not find the @xmath119  @xmath57 m silicate feature in the ir spectrum of this region , and @xcite derived a solar value for the si / o abundance ratio .",
    "furthermore , @xcite found that si ( and mg ) are essentially undepleted in the smc ism , concluding that silicates can not be an important component of dust in this galaxy .",
    "this lack of silicate dust does not seem to be a common feature of low - metallicity galaxies , since the @xmath119  @xmath57 m feature has been detected in sbs  0335@xmath4052 @xcite .",
    "the depleted fe may be in the form of oxides or metallic grains , or deposited onto carbon grains .",
    "such fe - containing non - silicate dust grains are also considered to be an important dust component in our own galaxy , where less than half of the depleted fe can be accounted for with silicates ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "we have presented a detailed analysis of the current discrepancy between the observationally derived and model predicted concentrations of fe ions in ionized nebulae .",
    "we have calculated new photoionization models that incorporate state - of - the - art values for all the atomic data relevant to the problem .",
    "the predicted fe ionic concentrations have been compared with those implied by the available observational data .",
    "our new model results are closer to the observed values than previous calculations , but there is still a discrepancy that translates into an uncertainty in the derived fe abundances of a factor up to @xmath120 .",
    "we have studied the possible reasons for this discrepancy and conclude that the most likely explanations are those due to uncertainties in the atomic data .",
    "we are able to find a satisfactory agreement between the model predictions and the observations in three different ways : ( 1 ) increasing either the total recombination coefficient or the rate of the charge exchange reaction with h@xmath100 for fe@xmath1 by a factor of @xmath3 , ( 2 ) decreasing the collision strengths for fe@xmath1 by a factor of 23 , and ( 3 ) increasing the collision strengths for fe@xmath0 by a factor of 23 . of course",
    ", if errors in different atomic data are involved , the above factors need not be as large .",
    "since we are considering quite drastic changes in the atomic data involved in the abundance calculation , we feel justified in using the fe abundances implied by the three possible explanations listed above as a way to constrain the true fe abundances in the gas of our sample objects .",
    "our set of galactic regions and pne have fe depletion factors ( @xmath121 ) below @xmath106 ; most of the fe atoms are deposited onto dust grains in these nebulae",
    ". only a few per cent or less of their fe atoms are in the gas phase .",
    "the extragalactic regions of our sample ( lmc  30  doradus , smc  n88a , and sbs  0335@xmath4052 ) show somewhat lower depletions and help define a trend of increasing depletion with increasing metallicity ( see fig .  [ dep ] ) .",
    "the depletion factor in sbs  0335@xmath4052 , one of the most metal - deficient galaxies known , is only poorly constrained : it should be in the range @xmath117 to @xmath116 .",
    "the exact amount of depletion in this interesting object will not be known until the [ ] discrepancy is fully explained .",
