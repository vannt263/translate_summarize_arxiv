    "it has long been realized that the small - angle scattering of x - rays by dust grains can result in a detectable x - ray `` halo '' around a distant x - ray source ( overbeck 1965 ) , with a radial intensity distribution that depends on the dust properties and location .",
    "this phenomenon was first detected by rolf ( 1983 ) using data from _",
    "einstein _ and confirmed by later observations ( e.g. mauche & gorenstein 1986 ; predehl et al .",
    "1991 ) .",
    "in the case of gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) , the transient nature of the burst combined with the large initial x - ray flux means x - ray scattering may be visible for a short period of time with a relatively high surface brightness . as the transient flux passes through a dust slab between the observer and the grb ,",
    "the scattering process introduces a time - delay in which the x - rays at larger angles to the line of sight arrive increasingly delayed with respect to the non - scattered x - rays .",
    "thus , the dust allows us to view the grb x - ray flux at earlier times .",
    "the time - dependent x - ray halo around the grb can , in principle , be used to provide detailed information on the location , spatial distribution and properties of the dust and the distance to and brightness of the grb ( e.g. trmper & schfelder 1973 ; klose 1994 ; miralda - escud 1999 ; draine 2003 ) .",
    "images of transient x - ray sources seen in scattered light are analogous to `` light echos '' seen around some supernovae ( e.g. sn 1987a , xu , crotts & kunkel 1995 ) .    scattered x - rays observed at an angle @xmath3 from the line - of - sight to a grb arrive after the direct emission with a time - delay @xmath4 given by :    @xmath5    where @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the redshift and angular diameter distance of the scattering dust , @xmath8 is the angular diameter distance of the grb and @xmath9 is the angular diameter distance from the dust to the grb ( miralda - escud 1999 ) .",
    "here we discuss the case of grb  031203  observed by _ xmm - newton _ on two occasions shortly after the burst .",
    "the first observation revealed the first dust - scattered x - ray halo detected around a grb .",
    "grb  031203  was detected by the ibis instrument on _ integral _ on 2003 december 3 at 22:01:28 ut as a single peaked burst with a duration of 30 s and peak flux of @xmath10 erg s@xmath11 @xmath12 in the 20200 kev band ( gotz et al .",
    "2003 ; mereghetti & gotz 2003 ) . a 58 ks _ xmm - newton _ observation of the field began at 2003 december 4 , 04:09:29 ut . several x - ray sources were detected within the @xmath13 radius _ integral _ error - circle ( santos - lle & caldern 2003 ) , the brightest of which ( s1 ) appeared to fade through the observation ( rodrguez - pascual et al .",
    "2003 ) and was interpreted as the x - ray afterglow of grb  031203 .",
    "we refined the astrometric position of the afterglow by performing a cross - correlation with the usno - a2 catalog , the improved s1 position was ( j2000 ) ra=@xmath14 , dec@xmath15  @xmath16  @xmath17 ( @xmath18 error 0.7 , tedds et al . 2003 ) .",
    "the position in the galactic plane ( @xmath19 ) results in high optical extinction ( @xmath20 , schlegel , finkbeiner & davis 1998 ) . optical / ir observations failed to locate an afterglow .",
    "radio observations did locate a transient source location consistent with the x - ray afterglow ( soderberg , kulkarni & frail 2003 ) , and optical imaging and spectroscopy revealed a candidate host galaxy at @xmath21 which shows star - forming features typical of grb hosts ( prochaska et al .",
    "2003a , b ) .",
    "our refined location for the x - ray afterglow is within 0.5  of the optical galaxy and consistent with the position of the radio source .    during the first _ xmm - newton _ observation the grb",
    "was observed on axis with all epic instruments in full - frame modes ( strder et al .  2001 ; turner et al .",
    "2001 ) . a second 54 ks _ xmm - newton _ observation was obtained on 2003 december 6 in which the grb was @xmath22 off axis .",
    "the observational details and the grb spectrum and light - curve are discussed in detail in watson et al .",
    "( 2004 ) .",
    "the extraction of science products followed standard procedures using the _ xmm - newton _ science analysis system ( sas v5.4.1 ) .",
    "the epic data were processed using the sas chains to produce calibrated event lists and remove background flares .",
    "grb afterglow source counts were extracted from circular regions ( radius @xmath23 ) and background counts were estimated from a large off - axis region free from obvious point sources and the halo .",
    "the grb afterglow fades as @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the time of the grb , which is unusually slow for grb x - ray afterglows .",
    "the x - ray image from the first _ xmm - newton _ observation reveals an extended , circular halo concentric with the grb  031203  afterglow ( see fig .  1 ) .",
    "this halo was seen in all three cameras of the epic instrument , is unique to this observation , and is not due to scattered optical or x - ray light within the instrument .",
    "summing the entire observation the halo had the form of a virtually complete ring ( vaughan et al .",
    "2003 ) , but splitting the observation into contiguous time intervals revealed distinct rings which increased in radius through the observation .    in order to better quantify this expansion , epic mos images were produced for ten contiguous time intervals of @xmath26  s duration , spanning the entire first observation , and binned to @xmath27 pixels .",
    "we concentrate on the mos data as the halo lies over several chip gaps in the epic pn images , but the same halo was seen in both .",
    "the radial profiles of the images about the afterglow were calculated removing the three brightest point sources within the region of interest ( s1 , s2 and s3 in fig .",
    "1 ) by ignoring all counts within @xmath28 from the centroid of each source .",
    "the radial profiles were then background subtracted using the mean level from the @xmath29 annulus , which is well outside the detected halo .",
    "the resulting count profiles as a function of radius are shown in fig .  2 .",
    "the strongest peak moved outward from @xmath30 to @xmath31 during the observation , while a second peak moved from @xmath32 to @xmath33 .",
    "the radial positions of the two rings were measured from the local maxima of the two peaks in the radial distributions .",
    "3 shows the change in radii as a function of time , and both were well fit by a simple power - law ( @xmath34 ) .",
    "fixing @xmath35 , the indices of the power - law expansions were measured to be @xmath36 and @xmath37 for the inner and outer rings respectively ( errors are 90% confidence intervals ) , consistent with the @xmath38 expansion predicted for a scattered halo . as a consistency check we allowed @xmath25 to be a free parameter but fixed @xmath39 and refitted to derive limits of @xmath40  s and @xmath41  s for the inner and outer ring respectively , both consistent with @xmath42 .",
    "the second _ xmm - newton _ observation obtained 3 days after the burst showed no evidence for any ringed structure .",
    "the distance to the grb is large ( adopting the redshift of the putative host galaxy ) , the time - delay is short and @xmath3 is relatively large , thus to a good approximation @xmath43 and @xmath44 in equation ( 1 ) , hence @xmath45 .",
    "assuming @xmath38 and @xmath42 , the data in fig .",
    "3 imply that the scattering dust slabs are located at distances from the observer of @xmath46 pc and @xmath47 pc , corresponding to the inner and outer ring respectively . at these distances ,",
    "the ring diameters probe size scales of 23 pc in the dust scattering medium .",
    "the halo spectrum was extracted from an annulus with radii @xmath48 using only the first half of the observation ; the decreased surface brightness of the halo at later times makes spectral extraction unreliable .",
    "a background spectrum was extracted from a large off - axis region ( avoiding the halo and other point sources ) .",
    "4 shows the halo spectrum compared to the afterglow spectrum .",
    "the spectrum of the halo is much steeper than that of the afterglow .",
    "fitting with a simple absorbed power - law yielded photon indices of @xmath49 and @xmath50 for the afterglow and halo , respectively .",
    "the best - fitting absorbing column was @xmath51  @xmath12 when fixed to be the same for both afterglow and halo spectra . this is larger than the galactic value of @xmath52  @xmath12 ( dickey & lockman 1990 ) .",
    "the specific fluxes at @xmath53  s after the burst at @xmath54  kev are @xmath55 photons @xmath12 s@xmath11 kev@xmath11 for the afterglow and @xmath56 photons @xmath12 s@xmath11 kev@xmath11 for the halo .    to model the dust scattering medium ,",
    "we have simultaneously fitted the ten radial profiles shown in fig .",
    "2 using the differential and total scattering cross sections of the rayleigh - gans approximation ( mauche and gorenstein 1986 ) .",
    "this is a valid approximation if the grain radius in @xmath57 m is much less than the x - ray photon energy in kev ( smith & dwek 1998 ) .",
    "we assume that the dust is confined to two slabs at distances @xmath58 and @xmath59 with thickness @xmath60 .",
    "the halo seen is created by the combination of the soft x - ray pulse from the grb and the subsequent afterglow .",
    "the observed angular width of the rings results from a combination of the duration of the soft x - ray pulse , @xmath61 , @xmath60 and the point spread function ( psf ) of the telescope .",
    "the width of the psf corresponds to @xmath62 s or @xmath63 pc . given that the grb is very short , @xmath64 s ( mereghetti & gotz 2003 )",
    ", we assume that @xmath65 s and hence , allowing for the psf , the observed broadening of the rings , @xmath66 , gives us an estimate of the slab thickness , @xmath67 pc .",
    "the angular and temporal distribution was well fitted using grains with radii in the range @xmath68 @xmath57 m .",
    "smaller grains scatter to much larger angles ( not visible because the time elapsed since the burst is too small ) and the upper limit to the grain size distribution is expected to be @xmath69 @xmath57 m ( predehl et al .",
    "1991 ) . using this range of grain sizes",
    ", we require the initial grb pulse and afterglow to have a photon index of @xmath70 ( as observed for the afterglow from 6 h ) to match the observed photon index of the halo ( @xmath71 ) .",
    "the brightness of the halo depends on the product of the differential scattering cross sections of the grains , the column densities of the grains in the slabs and the integrated flux of the x - ray pulse and afterglow .",
    "interstellar extinction maps show structure in the grb direction , with a considerable increase to @xmath72 mag at a distance of @xmath73 kpc ( neckel & klare 1980 ) .",
    "this distance is consistent with the location of the more distant dust slab we detect . adopting a mean grain size of @xmath74 @xmath57 m",
    ", an @xmath75 mag corresponds to a grain column density of @xmath76 @xmath12 ( mauche and gorenstein 1986 ) .",
    "the best fit to the ring structure ( @xmath77/d.o.f .",
    "@xmath78 ) results from dividing this column density between the two slabs , @xmath79 and @xmath80 @xmath12 ( i.e. most of the dust is in the more distant slab ) . using these values and @xmath81 ,",
    "the time - integrated flux required for the soft x - ray pulse is @xmath82 photon @xmath12 kev@xmath11 at 1  kev . assuming a 30 s rectangular pulse this is equivalent to @xmath83 crabs ; using @xmath84 the predicted grb flux in the @xmath85  kev band is @xmath86 photon @xmath12 s@xmath11 .",
    "given the assumptions ( e.g. spectral shape ) this is in reasonable agreement with the value reported for grb  031203  ( peak of @xmath87 photon @xmath12 s@xmath11 , gotz et al .",
    "2003 ; mereghetti & gotz 2003 ) .",
    "the x - ray burst is very bright compared to the afterglow ( see watson et al .",
    "extrapolating the decay of the afterglow ( section  2 ) to the time of the grb accounts for only @xmath88 per cent of the halo emission .",
    "the line of sight to grb  031203  passes close to the center of the gum nebula which appears as a @xmath89 diameter sphere in h@xmath90 centered at @xmath91 ( chanot & sivan 1983 ) .",
    "the gum nebula is likely to be a supershell created by repeated sne explosions within it .",
    "reynoso & dubner ( 1997 ) detected a neutral gas disk ( h  i ) associated with the gum nebula , located @xmath92 pc from us , with a radius of @xmath93 pc .",
    "the dust slab nearest to us may be associated with the rear face of the gum nebula which is known to have a concentration of molecular clouds ( woermann , gaylard & otrupcek 2001 ) .",
