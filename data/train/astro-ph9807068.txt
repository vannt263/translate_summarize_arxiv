    "@xcite introduced a method for recovering the shape of the three - dimensional primordial mass power spectrum on large scales from the one - dimensional transmission power spectrum of the lyman - alpha forest .",
    "they observed that the two are related by an integral of the form : @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the wave - vector along the line of sight , @xmath2 is the magnitude of the three - dimensional wave - vector , and @xmath3 and @xmath4 are the one - dimensional redshift - space transmission power spectrum and the three - dimensional redshift - space mass power spectrum respectively . it was suggested that redshift distortions merely change the normalization of @xmath4 from its real - space counterpart , and so a simple differentiation of @xmath3 would suffice in recovering the shape of the three - dimensional real - space mass power spectrum .",
    "redshift distortions ( see and references therein ) , however , imply that @xmath4 is in general a function of @xmath1 as well as @xmath2 , in which case differentiation of @xmath3 alone would not recover the true shape of the three - dimensional real - space mass power spectrum .",
    "we show in  [ general ] how to perform the inversion from the one - dimensional redshift - space transmission power spectrum to the three - dimensional real - space mass power spectrum correctly , for general , not necessarily linear , redshift distortions .",
    "it involves the inversion of a triangular matrix , which acts as a distortion kernel .",
    "we illustrate the method in  [ perturb ] with a perturbative example ( i.e linear distortions ) , and demonstrate that the method of simple differentiation generally outputs a real - space mass power spectrum which is flatter than the true one .",
    "we end with some concluding remarks in  [ conclude ] .        to avoid a proliferation of superscripts and subscripts , we adopt the following convention for the various power spectra , @xmath3 , discussed in this paper .",
    "we use @xmath5 to distinguish between one - dimensional and three - dimensional power spectra : @xmath3 is 1-d and @xmath4 is 3-d ( i.e. @xmath3 has a dimension which is the cube - root of that of @xmath4 ) . to distinguish between the three - dimensional redshift - space ( anisotropic ) versus the three - dimensional real - space ( isotropic ) power spectra , we rely on either the context or explicit arguments of the power spectra :",
    "the former is denoted by @xmath6 while the latter , being isotropic , is denoted simply by @xmath7 . in this paper , all one - dimensional power spectra ,",
    "on the other hand , are implicitly in redshift - space . finally , to tell apart the power spectrum of density from that of transmission / flux , we use superscripts : @xmath8 versus @xmath9 , where @xmath10 denotes the density and @xmath11 the transmission .",
    "the three - dimensional , generally anisotropic , power spectrum of some random field is related to its one - dimensional projection through the following integral ( ) @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the wave - vector along the line of sight , and @xmath2 is the magnitude of the three - dimensional wave - vector i.e. @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the magnitude of the wave - vector perpendicular to the line of sight .",
    "we assume that @xmath4 is independent of the direction of @xmath16 , by azimuthal symmetry , as is in the case of redshift distortions .",
    "note that we have used @xmath17 for the three - dimensional power spectrum , to distinguish it from @xmath3 , its one - dimensional counterpart .",
    "the power spectra are related to the three - dimensional , generally anisotropic , two - point correlation function @xmath18 by the following : @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the zeroth order bessel function .",
    "the two - point correlation @xmath18 depends on the magnitude of @xmath21 but not its direction , again by azimuthal symmetry .",
    "the @xmath22 coordinate above stands for the velocity along the line of sight ( in @xmath23 ) i.e. @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the observed wavelength , @xmath26 is the mean wavelength of interest , and @xmath27 is the speed of light .",
    "the @xmath28 coordinate stands for the transverse distance in velocity units i.e. @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the actual comoving transverse distance , @xmath31 is the mean redshift of interest and @xmath32 is the hubble parameter at that redshift .",
    "the mean redshift and the mean wavelength are related by @xmath33 , @xmath34 .",
    "the fourier counterparts of @xmath35 and @xmath36 are @xmath13 and @xmath15 .",
    "occasionally , we will abuse the notation by using the ( @xmath22 , @xmath13 ) pair to denote the coordinates in wavelength units i.e. @xmath37 and its fourier transform",
    ".    the effect of redshift - space distortions on the power spectrum , at both small and large scales , can be described by : @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the isotropic power spectrum in the absence of peculiar motion , and @xmath40 is a suitable distortion kernel .",
    "note that we rely on explicitly displaying the arguments to distinguish between the isotropic and the anisotropic power spectra .    finally , putting eq .",
    "( [ distortion ] ) into eq .",
    "( [ projection ] ) , it can be seen that the one - dimensional redshift - space power spectrum is related to the isotropic three - dimensional real - space power spectrum by a linear integral equation : @xmath41    thus far , we have not specified the actual random field whose power spectrum we are interested in .",
    "the random field could be the mass overdensity @xmath42 or the transmission / flux overdensity @xmath43 , where @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 , and @xmath47 is the optical depth .",
    "we will use @xmath8 or @xmath48 to denote the mass power spectrum and @xmath49 or @xmath50 to denote the transmission power spectrum .      in discretized form , this is equivalent to : @xmath53 where the power spectra are represented as vectors and @xmath54 is an upper ( or lower ) triangular matrix , which is invertible if none of the diagonal entries of @xmath54 vanishes . the special case considered by croft et al .",
    "@xcite corresponds to @xmath55 , where inverting the above matrix equation is equivalent to the differentiation of @xmath56 .    the problem of eq .",
    "( [ projection3 ] ) is of course that @xmath57 , for any given @xmath13 , depends on an infinite vector : @xmath58 for all @xmath2 s , from @xmath13 to , in principle , @xmath59 . to make it useful for computation , we have to truncate the infinite vectors somehow .",

    "( [ projection4 ] ) .    by inverting eq .",
    "( [ projection4 ] ) , we can in principle determine @xmath66 , with @xmath67 left as a free parameter .",
    "we can do better , however , by the following observation : since @xmath66 is generally a rapidly decreasing function of @xmath2 for sufficiently high @xmath2 s ( @xmath68 , or faster if @xmath10 is equated with the baryon density , see footnote in  [ largescales ] ) , assuming @xmath69 does not increase significantly with @xmath2 , one can see that @xmath67 can be made small by choosing a sufficiently high truncation @xmath70 . therefore ,",
    "inverting eq .",
    "( [ projection4 ] ) by ignoring @xmath67 altogether would still give accurate estimates of @xmath66 for @xmath2 s sufficiently smaller than @xmath70 .",
    "we will illustrate this with an explicit example of @xmath54 or @xmath51 in the next section .      in this section",
    ", we will perform a linear calculation of @xmath9 , and we will assume the actual shape of @xmath9 on large scales , even in the presence of nonlinearities on small scales , agrees with that of the linear prediction , while its amplitude might not .",
    "this is in the spirit of croft et al .",
    "@xcite who argued that , ignoring redshift - distortions , @xmath9 should be proportional to the linear @xmath8 on large scales , even though the mass fluctuations have gone nonlinear on small scales .",
    "the reader is referred to scherrer & weinberg @xcite for arguments on why that is reasonable , in the context of local - biasing ( the mapping from @xmath71 to the optical depth or transmission can be seen as some kind of local - biasing ; see  [ conclude ] for subtleties however ) .",
    "the output of our calculation would be a distortion kernel @xmath51 ( eq .",
    "[ [ projection2b ] ] ) , which may or may not be the true kernel on large scales if the mass density field has already gone nonlinear on small scales . we will have some more to say about this in  [ conclude ] .",
    "nonetheless , it is unlikely that the true @xmath51 is equal to a simple constant i.e. the general method of inverting a triangular matrix outlined in eq .",
    "( [ projection3 ] ) should be used , rather than mere differentiation .",
    "the perturbative example set forth in this section should be seen as an illustration of the method .      to derive the linear theory limit of @xmath9 ,",
    "let us start with the following general expression for the optical depth ( see e.g. ): @xmath72 \\ , , \\label{tau}\\ ] ] where @xmath73 is the proper number density of neutral hydrogen , @xmath31 is the mean redshift of interest , @xmath74 is the comoving spatial coordinate and the integration is done over the velocity @xmath75 along the line of sight .",
    "velocity is related to distance by @xmath76 where @xmath77 is the peculiar velocity along the line of sight , and @xmath78 is the position where the redshift due to the hubble expansion alone coincides exactly with @xmath31 .",
    "the jacobian @xmath79 multiplying the proper density @xmath73 gives us the neutral hydrogen density in velocity - space , and the summation is over multiple streams of @xmath74 s at a given @xmath75 .",

    "@xcite , this implies a range of @xmath184 , within which method i should give a negative inverted mass power spectrum . of course , a strict power - law power spectrum with @xmath185 in such a range is not very interesting because it gives a diverging one - dimensional transmission power spectrum ( @xmath186 is required for convergence ) .",
    "it is for this reason that a direct comparison can not be made between the above simple estimates and a test - case shown by croft et al .",
    "@xcite in which the initial power spectrum has @xmath187 .",
    "in fact , for a scale - free initial power spectrum of @xmath188 , the stable - clustering mass power spectrum at high @xmath2 should be @xmath189 ( ) . for @xmath190 , this means the high @xmath2 mass power spectrum asymptotes to @xmath191 , which is still not enough to regularize the integral for the transmission power spectrum ( eq .

    "it is likely that in their test - case , an effective ultraviolet cut - off is imposed by the finite resolution of the simulation , or else the true nonlinear redshift - distortion kernel provides an effective regularization .",
    "note , however , that there is no small - scale jeans smoothing to help here because croft et al .",
    "@xcite used n - body - only simulations .    nonetheless , we should emphasize that while , on large scales , the direction of the systematic error of method i is on firm ground ( i.e. systematic flattening ) , the size of the error , on the other hand , is subject to further investigation .",
    "we have used linear theory in  [ perturb ] to estimate the magnitude of this effect .",
    "the linear calculation gives us the effective `` bias - factor '' ( let us call it @xmath192 , which equals @xmath193 in eq .",
    "[ [ wlinear ] ] ) associated with the distortion parameter @xmath130 ( i.e. @xmath194 ) , but this might not be the correct @xmath192 in the presence of nonlinear fluctuations on small scales .    for instance , according to arguments by scherrer & weinberg ( ) , the galaxy - bias @xmath195 ( different from @xmath192 above , see below ) , defined as the ratio of the galaxy to mass two - point function on large scales ( where galaxy is related to mass by a local transformation ) , generally involves all the higher derivatives of the local transformation around @xmath196 i.e. not just the first derivative , as is in the case of a linear perturbative calculation .",
    "one might naively think that , in the case of the lyman - alpha forest , @xmath192 should be set equal to the analog of the galaxy - bias defined above , namely the ratio of the transmission to mass power spectrum on large scales .",
    "let us denote this latter quantity also by @xmath195 .",
    "this number is smaller than @xmath177 in our case ( because the exponential ( @xmath197 ) suppresses large fluctuations ) , which means the redshift distortions are more pronounced than we have assumed in ",
    "[ perturb ] , and the systematic error of method i should be even larger !    however , there are at least two reasons to suspect that this is not the correct conclusion .",
    "first , as emphasized recently by dekel & lahav ( ) , the bias factor that shows up in the linear distortion kernel ( @xmath192 ) is not necessarily the same as @xmath195 defined above , because of the nonlinearity of the biasing transformation ( see below for a discussion of the transformation relevant in our case ; we do not suffer from stochastic biasing , however ) .",
    "in fact , according to dekel & lahav , even the form of the linear distortion kernel could be slightly modified ( see also ) .    a second , perhaps more important",
    ", reason is that the mapping from the mass density field @xmath10 to the transmission @xmath11 actually involves two local `` biasing '' transformations with the redshift - space distortion in between .",
    "first ) . ] , the mass density in real - space is related to the neutral hydrogen density in real - space through the local transformation @xmath198 ; second , this is then `` distorted '' into the optical depth in redshift - space through @xmath199_z$ ] , where @xmath200_z$ ] denotes a quantity in redshift - space ; finally , another local transformation maps the optical depth in redshift - space to the transmission in redshift - space : @xmath44 .",
    "it is plausible that the first two steps determine the correct value of @xmath192 , while the last merely shifts the overall normalization of the final redshift - space power spectrum of the transmission on large scales ( see ) .",
    "lastly , there is of course the possibility that even the form of the large - scale distortion kernel in eq .",
    "( [ wlinear ] ) might be incorrect , or as is more likely the case , that the linear distortion kernel applies only at ( a small range of ) the largest scales ( see e.g. ) .",
    "this is related to the question of how nonlinear clustering on small scales , or translinear clustering on intermediate scales , affects the large scale behaviour of redshift distortions .",
    "couple this with the effects of nonlinear local transformations : we indeed have a complicated problem here .",
    "some of these issues are begining to be addressed ( see for the former , and for the latter ) .",
    "the good news , at least in the case of the lyman - alpha forest , is that the form of the relevant local `` biasing '' transformation is known exactly .    both issues , the problem of translinear or nonlinear redshift - space distortions and the problem of biasing in real as well as in redshift - space , are obviously of great interest in the wider context of large scale structure and galaxy surveys . analytical calculations , with reality checks using simulations ,",
    "would be necessary to address these questions .",
    "we hope to pursue aspects of these issues in a future publication .",
    "as this paper was nearing completion , the author became aware of a preprint by nusser & haehnelt ( ) who also considered the effects of redshift - space distortions on the forest , not in the case of inversion from the transmission power spectrum to the mass power spectrum , but in the case of the recovery of the mass density field itself .",
