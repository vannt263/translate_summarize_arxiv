    "several decades passed from serber s early description  @xcite of nuclear reactions induced by nucleons and light nuclei at few hundred mev per nucleon . in their standard outline , such reactions , generally called spallation , could be described as a fast excitation of an atomic nucleus , followed by a slower decay process  @xcite : depending on the phase space available @xcite , the system undergoes a sequence of more or less asymmetric splits  @xcite ranging from particle evaporation to fission .",
    "it was found already in pioneering studies  @xcite , that the most excited systems can also produce intermediate - mass fragments ( imf ) , and lead to a richer phenomenology comparable with nucleus - nucleus collisions and nuclear fragmentation  @xcite .",
    "further research focused on the study of thermodynamic observables from spallation reactions in the relativistic domain  @xcite , in connection with the liquid - gas phase transition in nuclear matter  @xcite , and in parallel with the research on the multifragmentation process observed in ion - ion collisions in the fermi - energy domain  @xcite .",
    "several fields of application , from energy and environment to neutron sources and exotic beams , stimulated intense research on protons and deuterons in the 1 gev range impinging on heavy nuclei .",
    "the production of some specific light nuclides with large kinetic energy resulted of great relevance in several technical issues ( radiation damages , fragilisation of structural materials in accelerator - driven systems , side effects in medical hadron - therapies ) .",
    "this despite the minor contribution of the whole imf production to the total reaction cross section , which was found to amount to few millibarn . in more recent experiments , the possibility of correlating isotopic cross sections to high - resolution kinematic observables allowed tracking the process of the imf production :",
    "it was advanced that it could originate from a melange of two processes , multifragmentation from the most excited configurations  @xcite , and asymmetric fission  @xcite .",
    "this work proposes a fully dynamical description of the process , within a boltzmann - langevin transport approach , with the aim of probing the mechanism which rules the physical process , through the analysis of kinematic and correlation observables .",
    "the imf production in spallation , especially in the 1@xmath2 gev range , is a process at the threshold between multifragmentation and compound - nucleus decay . to characterise the process ,",
    "an ideal experimental approach should measure event - by - event particle - particle and kinematic correlation observables at high - resolution .",
    "this goal has been only partially achieved , so that the lack of resolution or the missing of some correlations opens the way for a variety of physical interpretations , ranging from attributing all imf s to sequential fission processes to the opposite extreme that all imf s signal multifragmentation events . in the following",
    "we will refer to two specific experimental approaches , implying that the same considerations could follow from other experimental analyses .",
    "the first experimental approach we focus on is a campaign of inverse - kinematics experiments , performed at gsi ( darmstadt ) : the fragment separator  @xcite ( frs ) , a high - resolution magnetic achromat  @xcite , was employed to measure the nuclide production in several spallation reactions at around 1@xmath2gev  @xcite . in some systems it was possible to measure the isotopic cross sections of the imf and the corresponding zero - angle invariant - velocity distributions ;",
    "these distributions are constructed by selecting only the velocity vectors aligned along the beam direction ( they are evidently different from longitudinal projections of the whole velocity distributions ) .",
    "[ fig_v_distr ] presents some of those experimental results taken from ref .",
    "@xcite , and resumes few essential steps of the data analysis  @xcite .     measured in the imf region for the system @xmath3xe@xmath4 at 1@xmath2gev , from the experiment of ref .",
    "( b ) zero - angle invariant velocity distributions @xmath5 extracted from the experimental data for some isotopes  @xcite .",
    "( c ) analysis detail for one isotope , @xmath6f : invariant velocity plot on a plane containing the longitudinal axis .",
    "two contributions are present with a recoil mismatch : a coulomb ring with radius @xmath7 and a gaussian - like distribution .",
    "( d ) reduction of the two - dimensional plot to a distribution along the beam axis : two kinematic contributions to the invariant - velocity spectrum appear as a convex mode ( coulomb ring ) and a concave mode ( gaussian - like ) , respectively . ]    as evident in fig .",
    "[ fig_v_distr ] , in the imf region the velocity spectra of a given nuclide is the composition of two shapes : one is concave ( showing two peaks ) , the other is convex .",
    "the two contributions were also found to have different relative shares as a function of the nuclide .",
    "though , the presence of two different contributions is evident only in the kinematics , while the nuclide production selected for either the concave or the convex mode contribute to the same region of the nuclide chart , in general situated in the neutron - rich side with respect to @xmath8 stability : this is the reason why the presence of these two modes was invisible in many experiments . moreover ,",
    "the two contributions are associated with a shift in the mean value of the spectra , indicating incompatible values for the mean momentum transfer : this latter reveals in fact the violence of the entrance channel .    the concave shape is reflected in a coulomb - shell velocity distribution probed at zero angle .",
    "the radius of the shell is compatible with a fission kinematics  @xcite and the mean value evolves coherently with empirical systematics for the mean recoil momentum as a function of the fissioning system ( i.e. compatible with the systematics of morrissay  @xcite ) .",
    "the convex shape is one broad hump , often asymmetric , which signs the folding of many different contributions ; it is associated with a mean recoil momentum which does not follow any empirical systematics .",
    "this indicates that the fissioning configuration is not achieved , either because the multiplicity of fragments is not equal to two , or because the kinematics is not consistent with a conventional fission configuration . in this respect",
    ", the convex shape is rather compatible with multifragmentation .",
    "such observations led to the conclusion that the imf production should combine asymmetric - fission ( concave shapes ) and multifragmentation ( convex shapes ) .",
    "on the one hand , this description was rigorously established because these two velocity contributions were measured at the same time for each single nuclide  @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", the problem of assuring such interpretation was that particle - particle correlations and imf multiplicities were not measured in the inclusive approach .",
    "especially for the convex shape this information is important as multifragmentation is usually associated with a large number of imf of similar size .",
    "a second experimental technique was adapted to obtain this information .",
    "some of the systems previously measured inclusively at the fragment separator were successively measured again with an exclusive approach in the spalladin experimental campaign  @xcite at gsi ( darmstadt ) .",
    "these experiments indicated that imf are observed in events where fragment multiplicity is prevalently equal to two , and that events with larger multiplicity were more rare .",
    "on the one hand , this confirmed that there are actually two contributions to the imf production , a binary channel and a higher multiplicity channel .",
    "on the other hand , the events exceeding two imf were not easily identifiable with ordinary multifragmentation because of the low imf multiplicity and the size asymmetry .",
    "this encouraged interpretations fully relying on statistical models , where the imf production is obtained either from a sequence of ( asymmetric ) fission contributions , or sampled from an ensemble of possible multifragmented configurations .",
    "in general , these approaches are both an efficient workaround because they define directly the outcome of the reaction on the basis of the involved excitation energy , and they can yield quite similar results for the imf production despite implying different physical pictures . then the question arises whether we can include spallation in the multifragmentation picture .",
    "it is our intention to illustrate that the key to achieve a fully coherent understanding of this apparently self - contradictory experimental information , conciliating the possibility to emit only few imf s with the observation of new kinematic properties , is a microscopic dynamical description of the process .      avoiding prominent mechanical contributions from the entrance channel which characterise ion - ion collisions at fermi energies , spallation is a favoured processes to produce a thermalised remnant .",
    "it is therefore well established that the usual hypothesis of a hot and fully equilibrated source is perfectly adapted to spallation and in fact statistical models proceeding from this assumption are well suited to reproduce large part of the experimental observables  @xcite . on the other hand , it is not the purpose of these approaches to investigate the reaction mechanism which leads to the final configuration . to directly address the quest",
    ", we proceed through a dynamical description avoiding any a priori assumption on the degree of equilibration of the system at a given reaction time .",
    "in particular , the dynamical approach allows to describe the possible onset of mechanical instabilities in a fermionic system : this is a general process which characterises fermi liquids at low densities and which results in inhomogeneous density patterns . as we will explore in the following",
    ", the incident energy of a light projectile can actually be large enough to produce the thermodynamical and density conditions for unstable modes to get amplified , i.e. to enter the nuclear spinodal region  @xcite .",
    "the dispersion relation  @xcite defines how the growth rate of these unstable modes connects to the mean - field potential . in this direction , a one - body approach based on an efficient description of the dispersion relation is well adapted , and a stochastic treatment is necessary to sample the variety of possible dynamical trajectories that unstable conditions may produce . with the purpose of investigating fragment formation , stochastic one - body approaches",
    "have already been applied to spallation  @xcite , but with incomplete success because fluctuations were not treated in full phase - space . as an improvement , in this work we employ the boltzmann - langevin one body ( blob ) approach  @xcite which has been constructed under the explicit constraint of describing the fluctuation mechanism in full phase - space by solving the boltzmann - langevin ( bl ) transport equation in three dimensions .",
    "the model was firstly applied to dissipative central ion - ion collisions  @xcite at fermi energies , to investigate the transition from incomplete fusion to multifragmentation in proximity of the low - energy threshold for multifragmentation , which we expect spallation can also probe in the 1@xmath2gev regime .",
    "within the blob transport model we follow the dynamics of the target nucleus , after the interaction with the light projectile .",
    "we describe the @xmath9-body system with a one - body hamiltonian @xmath10 supplemented by a fluctuating contribution to account for the unknown @xmath9-body correlations .",
    "the bl equation describes the time evolution of the semiclassical one - body distribution function @xmath11 in its own self - consistent mean field : @xmath12,f\\right\\ } = { \\bar{i}[f]}+{\\delta i[f ] } \\;. \\label{eq1}\\ ] ] the left - hand side gives the vlasov evolution for @xmath13 and the right - hand side introduces the residual interaction , which also carries the unknown n - body correlations .",
    "this latter contains the average boltzmann hard two - body collision integral @xmath14 $ ] and the fluctuating term of markovian type @xmath15 $ ] , also written in terms of the one - body distribution function @xcite .",
    "the propagation of the one - body distribution function is described through the test particle method and employs a skyrme - like ( _ _ skm__@xmath16 ) effective interaction  @xcite , defined according to a soft isoscalar equation of state ( of compressibility @xmath17  mev ) ; the potential energy per nucleon @xmath18 is defined as @xmath19 with @xmath20 and @xmath21 , where @xmath22 and @xmath23 are the saturation and the isovector density , respectively .",

    "the @xmath39 is taken equal to the free nucleon - nucleon cross section , with a cutoff at @xmath40  mb .",
    "moreover , the differential cross section depends on the scattering angle according to the prescription of ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "all test - particle agglomerates are redefined at successive intervals of time in phase - space cells of volume @xmath41 ; in their initial state they correspond to the most compact configuration in the phase - space metrics which does neither violate pauli blocking in the initial and in the final states , nor energy conservation in the scattering .",
    "the metrics of the test particle agglomerates is defined in such a way that the packet width in coordinate space is the closest to @xmath42 , where @xmath43 corresponds to the screened cross section prescription proposed by danielewicz  @xcite , which was found to describe recent experimental data  @xcite . in this way , the spatial extension of the packet decreases as the nucleon density increases .",
    "the nucleon - nucleon correlations produced through this approach are then exploited within a stochastic procedure , which consists in confronting the effective collision probability @xmath44 with a random number . when the scattering is successful , a precise shape - modulation technique  @xcite is applied to ensure that the occupancy distribution does not exceed unity in any phase - space location in the final states .",
    "such constraint avoids that the pauli blocking could be violated , and it imposes to pay special attention to the metrics of the phase space ( see discussion in ref .",
    "@xcite ) .    as a consequence ,",
    "fluctuations develop spontaneously in large portions of phase space , with an amplitude variance equal to @xmath45 , at equilibrium , in a phase - space cell of volume @xmath41 .",
    "this leads to a correct fermi statistics for the distribution function @xmath13 , in terms of mean value and variance .",
    "calculations in a periodic box for unstable nuclear matter , in one dimension  @xcite and in three dimensions  @xcite have shown that the blob approach describes the growth rate of the corresponding ( spinodal ) unstable modes , related to the form of the mean - field potential , as ruled by the dispersion relation .",
    "thus the blob model for heavy - ion collisions is constructed as based on the efficient description of these aspects .",
    "differently from heavy - ion collisions at fermi energy , in this application to spallation only the dynamics of the heated heavy nucleus is followed after a suitable initialisation . as usual , the system is initially defined by organising the test particles in a minimum - energy configuration in accordance with the form chosen for the nuclear interaction . in order to define the heated system ,",
    "this configuration is redefined by processing a simplified cascade induced by the incoming light projectile : the amount of energy deposited by the projectile in traversing the nucleus is calculated as well as the corresponding distribution in phase space .",
    "a time - dependent calculation would require very small time steps and a relativistic formalisation of the dynamics .",
    "due to the rapidity of the spallation process with respect to the dynamics of the heated system , it is convenient to reduce the cascade to an approximate description where only test - particles from the incoming relativistic projectile are followed along space trajectories and target test - particles are not displaced during the cascade . in practice , this simplification is made by reducing the cascade process to a calculation of the energy loss of the projectile , modifying the momentum landscape of the target test - particles without processing any time evolution of the system in coordinate space . for relativistic projectiles",
    "this choice is not incompatible with the observation that the projectile leaves the target nucleus before that the swarm of the first fastest ejectiles appears at the surface of the target nucleus  @xcite .",

    "the test particles composing the projectile hit the nucleus along the projectile direction within a cylinder of radius equal to the projectile radius .",
    "each projectile test particle produces a cascade path inside of the target nucleus , which is redefined at each scattering occurrence : after scattering , the projectile test - particle trajectory continues to be followed along the fastest scattered particle and the other particle , after being assigned a new momentum , is no more followed . between two scattering points",

    "the action of the secondary decay may turn some few events into three - imf patters which enter the selection and fill the centre of the plot . in the @xmath46pb system ,",

    "moreover , their final yield , after de - excitation has been considered , is quite close to the yield given by the blob simulations at @xmath63 .",

    "when present , the contribution of events with fragment multiplicity larger than two are indicated . for the @xmath3xe system it appears only in the cold system , leading to a wide convex portion of the spectrum , especially in the fluorine case : the convexity results from the variety of possible sizes and patterns involved in the splitting configurations , mainly",
    "when @xmath86 .",
    "the resulting overall concave or two - humped wide spectra of the cold carbon and fluorine isotopes is produced by imparting different boosts to the fragments issued of binary events as a function of the partner size , producing wide humps from the folding of different coulomb boosts , and by an additional contribution from asymmetric fission of the heavy residues , which selects a narrower coulomb peak . from the analysis of fig .",
    "[ fig_dalitz ] we infer that , even when the multiplicity is larger than two , the kinematics of the splits should however manifest a binary - like character due to the size asymmetry among fragments : the kinematics reflects in this case the prominent coulomb repulsion imparted by the largest fragment .",
    "this effect becomes dominant in the @xmath46pb system , where concave wide spectra are also observed for larger fragment multiplicities .",
    "the calculation was limited to a small interval of impact parameters .",
    "the extension to the full range of impact parameters would , firstly , add or enhance the feeding of coulomb peaks in the cold - imf spectrum from asymmetric fission of heavy residues .",

    "events where imf are produced are related to a large range of central to semi - central impact parameters , and are mostly contributing to the centre of the distribution .",

    "in general , we observe that the more or less pronounced filling of the centre and the appearing of wide humps in the zero - angle spectra signs the presence of mechanisms possibly related to the sudden production of a few imf s in a same short interval of time , as suggested in experimental observations  @xcite",
    "even though a quantitative comparison with experimental data is beyond the purpose of this work , we observe that the model describes a large range of observable , from nuclide production to kinematics , which is globally consistent with the available experimental information .",

    "grow in amplitude and potential ripples develop , becoming the nesting sites of fragments : inhomogeneities in the bulk density profile stand out at around 100 fm / c , but it takes them long time to eventually separate into fragments .",

    "[ fig_animation_frag ] analyses for this same system the density averaged over those blobs as a function of their size at different times .",
    "the blobs are identified as any potential concavity found in the system and the size is their average radius ( their shape is nearly spherical ) . at early times",
    "potential concavities coincide with the whole expanding system or with some large portions of it when particle flow develops . at late times",
    "potential concavities have a large probability to coincide with the inhomogeneities arising in the density landscape : because their size reflects the leading instability mode  @xcite , they are all comparable in size , corresponding with larger probability to neon or oxygen nuclei  @xcite . at intermediate times , sizes range from the whole system to the size of the spinodal undulations in the density landscape .",
    "this coexistence recalls phase - transition signals and corresponding results at fermi energies , where suitable observables ( such as the asymmetry between the charges of the two heaviest fragments produced in one collision event  @xcite or the size of the largest fragment produced in one event  @xcite ) have been proposed .",
    "however , only in presence of a sufficiently large radial expansion these blobs can separate into fragments of comparable size and preserve the spinodal signal also in the exit channel .",
    "we can observe that this is definitely not the case : not all blobs succeed in separating in single fragments but they bond together in groups .",
    "the event of fig .",
    "[ fig_animation_frag ] finally results in the fragmentation of the system into four asymmetric parts .",

    "in fact this latter , even when displaying a peak around the elements selected by the spinodal instability like oxygen and neon , presents a rather flat distribution which implies a large recombination of the spinodal inhomogeneities into larger fragments .",
    "as it was already argued in ref.@xcite , we can conclude on this phenomenology that the multifragmentation mechanism in spallation in the 1  @xmath2gev energy regime is frustrated by the action of the mean field which tends to recompact the system as far as not enough energy is spent in the radial expansion .",

    "moreover , they also act , over many events , in expanding the bundle of dynamical reaction paths into a large chaotic pattern of bifurcations  @xcite : this leads to a variety of exit channels .",
    "[ fig_trajectories ] illustrates this effect by plotting the average radius of inhomogeneities found in the density landscape as a function of time for several stochastic evolutions of the systems @xmath46pb+@xmath55 at 1 @xmath2 gev .",
    "each trajectory could lead to a different exit channel , characterised by a different kinematics and larger or smaller fragment multiplicities and charge asymmetries .",
    "particularly interesting are trajectories leading to only two fragments in the exit channel , as it can occur rather often in systems like @xmath3xe+@xmath55 at 1 @xmath2 gev , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig_animation_fiss ] . also in this case , a spinodal process may activate and immediately enter in competition with the action of the mean field which tends to reverse the fragmentation pattern into a compact shape .",
    "most of the times , this frustrating process results in one single compound nucleus .",
    "very seldom the mean field succeeds only partially in coalescing the inhomogeneities of the density profile , and one or a group of those separates into a fragment and leaves the system .",
    "depending on the stochastic configuration of the fragmenting system , the partial coalescence could recompact the inhomogeneities in many combinations resulting in different asymmetries .",
    "xe+@xmath55 at 1 @xmath2 gev for one events resulting into an asymmetric binary split . ]    to characterise the final exit channel , we have combined the dynamical process and the additional secondary decay , which we simulated through a fission - evaporation afterburner .",
    "it turns out that two mechanisms may coexist in the spallation systems we examined .",
    "one is a multifragmentation process frustrated by the coalescence effect of the mean field , which constrains the fragment multiplicity to small values , rarely equal to three or four , more often equal to two : this work focused mostly on this process .",
    "the other mechanism , related to the production of heavy residues , is also a binary split , but it coincides with asymmetric fission from a compound nucleus in the secondary decay process  @xcite . for different causes ,",
    "both processes contribute to the same imf production when regarding the charge distribution and even when regarding the isotopic content .",
    "however , these two contributions are fundamentally different because of two reasons .",
    "first : they are separate in time ; multifragmentation develops within the short time of the dynamical collision process , while the second occurs during the longer time of the fission decay process .",
    "second : from a dynamical point of view binary splits emerging from fission or from multifragmentation are different : fission of a compound nucleus is a trajectory in a deformation landscape which passes through the development of a neck ; on the other hand , multifragmentation leads initially to a mottling topology in density space , possibly driven by spinodal instabilities , and then the expansion dynamics attempts to keep this topology , in competition with the antagonist tendency of reverting into a compact shape .",
    "this would lead to binary channels , similar to fission , but obtained through re - aggregation processes .",
    "the latter could generally have different kinematic features with respect to standard fission processes .",
    "experimentally , this difference would be reflected in the velocity spectra of the imf s if the resolution is sufficiently high .",
    "the length of the transport calculation makes it prohibitive to track all contributions to the yields coming from the full distribution of excitation energies of the spallation system , and we had to restrict to the most violent collisions only .",
    "more quantitative simulations are left for further works .",
    "the boltzmann - langevin one body ( blob ) approach has been applied to the dynamics of hot nuclear systems produced in spallation reactions .",
    "a simplified cascade procedure was introduced to simulate the collision of relativistic protons and light projectiles on heavy target nuclei .",
    "successively , the dynamics is followed in time within the blob treatment , to investigate the trajectory followed by the system as a function of the initial energy deposition .",
    "we find that unstable isoscalar modes can actually arise in such systems , like heavy nuclei bombarded by protons and deuterons in the 1 a gev regime and , with a low but not negligible probability , become responsible for the fragmentation of the system . according to our theoretical approach",
    ", we find that unstable modes in spallation should exhibit quite a similar phenomenology as spinodal instability in dissipative central heavy - ion collisions when the incident energy corresponds to the threshold between fusion and multifragmentation @xcite .    in the case of dissipative ion - ion collisions ,",
    "the excitation of the system is mostly determined by mechanical perturbations , while in the spallation process the excitation originates from an almost isotropic propagation of the energy deposited by the light projectile .",
    "though these situations are different in some aspects , they both drive phase - space fluctuations of large amplitude and they may both activate the spinodal behaviour and the amplification of mechanically unstable modes . in both cases , the mean field may then have the effect of reverting the whole system , or part of it , into a compact shape , smearing , modifying , or completely erasing the fragment configuration .",
    "in particular , if the kinetic energy feeding the expansion dynamics is not sufficient to disintegrate the system but it is still larger than the system can hold , the fragment multiplicity reduces and the fragment configuration becomes asymmetric . as an extreme situation , the process may look like asymmetric fission , but the chronology , as well as the violence of the process will be incompatible with the conventional fission picture : this process would correspond to a binary channel obtained by re - aggregation , keeping some dynamical aspects .    further binary contribution to imf deriving from fission have been accounted for by adding to the dynamical simulation a fission - evaporation treatment for the decay of all the possible warm configurations explored by the collision .",
    "the overall simulation , constructed around a boltzmann - langevin description of the most violent collision events , leads to a correct qualitative picture for the production and kinematics of imf nuclides .",
    "in particular , the physical description that we suggest for imf production in spallation may solve apparent discrepancies between some experimental interpretations of inclusive and exclusive data , the former revealing multifragmentation - like kinetic energies , the latter revealing small fragment multiplicities compatible with compound - nucleus decays .",
    "these experimental results would actually be perfectly coherent .    as a conclusion , we found within a dynamical transport approach incorporating a langevin term that the incident energy of a light projectile in the 1 gev range is sufficient to turn the heavy target into an unstable system , where mechanically unstable modes develop leading to a variety of aymmetric fragment configurations , including binary channels .",
    "this phenomenology reflects the entrance of the system in the spinodal zone of the nuclear matter phase diagram and appears as a frustrated spinodal behaviour .",

    "<S> heavy nuclei bombarded with protons and deuterons in the 1 gev range have a large probability of undergoing a process of evaporation and fission ; less frequently , the prompt emission of few intermediate - mass fragments can also be observed .    </S>",
    "<S> we employ a recently developed microscopic approach , based on the boltzmann - langevin transport equation , to investigate the role of mean - field dynamics and phase - space fluctuations in these reactions .    </S>",
    "<S> we find that the formation of few imf s can be confused with asymmetric fission when relying on yield observables , but it can not be assimilated to the statistical decay of a compound nucleus when analysing the dynamics and kinematic observables : it can be described as a fragmentation process initiated by phase - space fluctuations , and successively frustrated by the mean - field resilience . as an extreme situation , which corresponds to non - negligible probability , the number of fragments in the exit channel reduces to two , so that fission - like events are obtained by re - aggregation processes .    </S>",
    "<S> this interpretation , inspired by nuclear - spallation experiments , can be generalised to heavy - ion collisions from fermi to relativistic energies , for situations when the system is closely approaching the fragmentation threshold </S>",
