    "as current technology advances , more and more attention is placed upon quantum mechanics to solve future problems .",
    "furthermore , quantum systems are capable of performing some tasks more efficiently than classical systems @xcite , drawing even more emphasis to quantum technologies . in particular , the fields of optical communication , optical imaging and optical information processing have been appended by the rapidly developing fields of quantum communication @xcite , quantum imaging @xcite and quantum information processing @xcite .",
    "thus , the study of quantum phenomena promises to be a fruitful enterprise .    for many years",
    "researchers have studied the non - classical behavior of light , such as squeezing @xcite and antibunching @xcite . however , most theoretical and experimental investigations deal with time variables only .",
    "that is , most treatments consider only one spatial mode . in a recent review article , kolobov",
    "@xcite demonstrates that many quantum phenomena also occur when considering spatial variables of the electromagnetic field .",
    "many areas of technology stand to benefit from the possible applications provided by such quantum phenomena .",
    "an invaluable tool in these areas of research is the generation of entangled photons using parametric down - conversion @xcite .",

    ", we provide a theoretical background for the experiment reported in @xcite .",

    "[ sec : spdc ] we discuss the theoretical observation of spatial antibunching of photons using a two - photon entangled state produced by spdc , as in @xcite .",
    "we close with some concluding remarks in section [ sec : conc ] .",
    "it is well known that any state of the electromagnetic field that has a classical analog can be described by means of a positive nonsingular glauber - sudarshan @xmath0 distribution , which has the properties of a classical probability functional over an ensemble of coherent states . because of this fact , the normally - ordered intensity correlation function for stationary fields must obey the following inequality @xcite : @xmath1 where @xmath2 stands for time and normal ordering .",
    "photon density operators are defined as @xmath3 where @xmath4 @xmath5 is the annihilation operator for the mode with wave vector @xmath6 and polarization @xmath7 , @xmath8 is the unit polarization vector , @xmath9 is the quantization volume and @xmath10 .    expression ( [ eq : in1q ] ) is commonly written in the shorter form @xmath11 where @xmath12 since the delayed photon coincidence detection probability @xmath13 is proportional to @xmath14 @xcite , inequality ( [ eq : short ] ) means that for the class of fields considered above , photons are detected either bunched or randomly distributed in time .",
    "photon antibunching in time , characterized by the violation of ( [ eq : in1q ] ) , was predicted by carmichael and walls @xcite , kimble and mandel @xcite , and was first observed by kimble , dagenais and mandel in resonance fluorescence @xcite .    in the space domain , the concept analogous to stationarity is homogeneity . for a homogeneous field , the expectation value of any quantity that is a function of position is invariant under translation of the origin @xcite .",
    "in particular , on a plane surface normal to the propagation direction , @xmath15 and @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the transverse position vector , @xmath18 and @xmath19    for homogeneous and stationary fields described by positive nonsingular @xmath0 distributions , the schwarz inequality implies that @xmath20 that is , @xmath21 analogously to what was concluded from inequality ( [ eq : short ] ) , for fields that admit classical stochastic models , inequality ( [ eq : bunch ] ) implies that photons are detected either spatially bunched or randomly spaced in a transverse detection screen .",
    "violation of ( [ eq : bunch ] ) implicates the possibility of quantum fields exhibiting spatial antibunching .",
    "spatial antibunching of photons has been predicted by some authors @xcite .",
    "in this section we show that a field that violates inequality ( [ eq : bunch ] ) can be generated by means of spontaneous parametric down - conversion .",
    "the experimental setup we are considering is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : exp ] .",
    "a nonlinear birefringent crystal is used to generate collinear entangled photon pairs .",
    "the down - converted photons are then incident on a birefringent double - slit ( see section [ subsec : bds ] ) and coincidences are detected by detectors @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "the pump beam is focused on the center of the plane of the double - slit , between the two slits .",
    "interference filters are used such that the monochromatic approximation is valid .",

    "we consider type - ii phase matching , in which case @xmath35 and @xmath36 where @xmath37 @xmath38 stands for extraordinary ( ordinary ) polarization .",
    "@xmath39 is the two - photon component of the total quantum state .",
    "the function @xmath40 , which can be regarded as the normalized angular spectrum of the two - photon field @xcite , is given by @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the normalized angular spectrum of the pump beam , @xmath43 is the length of the nonlinear crystal in the @xmath25-direction , and @xmath44 is the magnitude of the pump field wave vector .",
    "the integration domain @xmath45 is , in principle , defined by the conditions @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "however , in most experimental conditions , the domain in which @xmath40 is appreciable is much smaller than that .",
    "the state written above is not to be considered as a general expression for the spdc process .",
    "its validity is determined by experimental conditions , especially by the detection apparatus . as long as the monochromatic and paraxial approximations are valid , the results predicted by expression ( [ eq:14 ] ) are in excellent agreement with experience .",
    "monochromatic approximation is guaranteed by the presence of narrow - band interference filters in the detection apertures , whereas paraxial approximation is guaranteed by keeping transverse detection regions much smaller than their distance from the crystal .    .",
    "the pump beam is focused on the double slit .",
    "single and coincidence counts are registered with detectors @xmath22 and @xmath23 . ]",
    "we consider for now that the down - converted fields are incident on some sort of aperture , so as to produce fourth - order interference in the absence of second - order interference .",
    "the reason for such a requirement is the following : spatial photon antibunching is a fourth - order effect in a homogeneous field , that is to say , in a field that , according to [ eq : uniform ] , does not show intensity patterns . with this scheme",
    ", we are seeking for a fourth - order interference pattern that depends only on @xmath48 , the relative position of detectors .",
    "furthermore , this fourth - order interference pattern must have a minimum when @xmath49 in order to produce antibunching .",
    "fourth - order spatial interference in the absence of second - order can be achieved in spontaneous parametric down - conversion by means of a double - slit whose slit separation is much greater than the transverse coherence length of the down - converted field , as reported by fonseca _",
    "however , in reference @xcite the fourth - order correlation function , which is proportional to the coincidence rate , depends on @xmath50 instead of @xmath48 . in order to achieve a minimum of coincidences",
    "when @xmath49 , we have to introduce a phase difference of @xmath51 between the two possibilities + \\{photon 1 through slit 1 , photon 2 through slit 2 } and \\{photon 1 through slit 2 , photon 2 through slit 1}. in our experiment , that phase difference was introduced by means of birefringent elements placed in front of each slit , as described later .",
    "after the aperture , the two - photon state can be written as @xmath52 where @xmath53 is a normalization constant , @xmath54 is the angular spectrum of the biphoton field on the aperture plane , that is , @xmath55.\\nonumber\\\\",

    "@xmath56 is given by the fourier transform of the aperture function @xmath60 .",

    ", we can define @xmath65 as the two photon coincidence detection amplitude , where @xmath66 is the monochromatic form of ( [ eq : vdef ] ) in the paraxial approximation and @xmath25 is the distance between the aperture plane and the detection plane , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : geom ] .",
    "it is assumed that the polarization vector @xmath67 is independent of @xmath57 .",
    "the two - photon coincidence - detection probability for stationary fields is proportional to the fourth - order correlation function with @xmath68 : @xmath69       and @xmath70 are aligned with orthogonal fast axes .",
    "@xmath71 is a double slit with slits separation @xmath72 . ]",
    "the birefringent double slit consists of two quarter - wave plates mounted in front of a typical double slit , such that each wave plate covers only one slit and their fast axes are orthogonal to one another , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : slit ] .",
    "the slits are separated a distance @xmath72 . with the plate - slit aperture oriented such that the slits and one fast axis are parallel to the @xmath37 ( @xmath73 ) direction and the other fast axis parallel to the @xmath74 ( @xmath75 ) direction , we can approximate the field - aperture functions by @xmath76 where @xmath77 is the @xmath75-component of @xmath78 .",
    "the plate - slit apertures provide a controlled phase factor , that is , no phase will be added to a field with polarization parallel to the direction of the fast - axis of the wave - plate , while a field with perpendicular polarization will be modified by a phase factor of @xmath79 .",
    "thus , the phase factor depends on the polarization of the field as well as through which slit the field  passes \" .      combining equations ( [ eq : scatt][eq : vparax ] ) and ( [ eq : slits ] )",
    ", we arrive at the following expression for coincidence - detection amplitude in the fraunhofer approximation : @xmath80 + \\psi_{oe}\\ [ \\bm{\\epsilon}_{o}\\otimes \\bm{\\epsilon}_{e}],\\ ] ] where @xmath81\\right.\\nonumber\\\\ & & \\left .",

    "it is clear from expression ( [ eq : detect2 ] ) above , that the fulfillment of the homogeneity condition ( [ eq : uniform ] ) for @xmath90 in the @xmath75-direction depends on the factor @xmath91 . if @xmath92 , the dependence on @xmath93 disappears and transverse field on the detection plane can be considered as homogeneous",
    "this is the reason why the pump beam must be focused on the center of the double slit . in this case ,",

    "\\label{eq:31}\\ ] ] when @xmath96 , the coincidence count rate is zero and increases with @xmath48 until @xmath97 .",
    "therefore , the fourth - order correlation function @xmath98 , which is proportional to the coincidence detection probability @xmath99 , does not have a maximum at @xmath96 .",
    "this contradicts ( [ eq : bunch ] ) , thus characterizing spatial antibunching of photons .",
    "we have shown the theoretical background behind the spatial antibunching of photons using parametric down - conversion . it may be instructive for the reader to compare the experiment analyzed here with its classical counterpart . in this context",
    ", the single count detection rate @xmath100 should be proportional to the classical average intensity @xmath101 , whereas the coincidence count rate @xmath102 should be proportional to the intensity - intensity ( or the fourth - order ) correlation function @xmath103 .",
    "the single count detection rate of down - converted light in the presence of a double - slit has been studied in previous works @xcite . in reference @xcite it was demonstrated that in terms of its single count rate , spdc behaves like a classical schell - model extended light source . in our experiment ,",
    "the transverse coherence length being shorter than the slits separation and shorter than the slits widths themselves , the single count rate is given by the classical expression for incoherent illumination , which can be approximated by a gaussian @xmath104 where @xmath105 and @xmath106 is the width of the slits . since the transverse detection range @xmath107 is much shorter than the width of this gaussian profile for the slits - detectors distance considered , the single count rate is fairly constant over de detection range @xcite . by another side ,",
    "the coincidence detection rate due to a classical source is totally different from the observed with down - converted light .",
    "perhaps , the best classical model for type - ii spdc is a superposition of two extended light sources orthogonally polarized and correlated in intensity .",
    "after the light is diffracted by the birefringent double - slit , the calculation of the classical fourth - order correlation function is quite similar to the case of the hanbury brown ",
    "twiss intensity interferometer @xcite .",
    "classical intensity interferometry is known to be insensitive to phase .",
    "therefore , the birefringent elements have no effect on the predicted fourth - order correlation , that is , @xmath108 .",
    "\\label{eq : hbt}\\ ] ] the visibility @xmath109 is in the range @xmath110 and depends on the statistics of the source .",
    "it is clear from expression ( [ eq : hbt ] ) above that @xmath102 predicts spatial bunching , as expected from any classical light source . in view of the above analysis",
    ", the results presented here describe an entirely quantum fourth - order interference effect , with no classical analog @xcite .",
    "in addition to rendering further interest in the study of non - classical states of light , spatial antibunching promises to be a useful tool in quantum imaging and quantum information technologies ."
