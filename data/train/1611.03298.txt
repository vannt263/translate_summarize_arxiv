    "the emergence of new technologies that enable collection of geospatial and temporal data along with the explosive growth of research in the fields of online social networks and their implications have led the path to conduct research on the _ offline _ experiences of humans , the social behaviour and movement of people in the _",
    "real world_. online social networking sites facilitated easy collection of data and social graphs which motivated a large number of studies : from analyzing the structure of the networks , identifying the most influential people in a network , predictive models for inferring social connections to evolution studies for communities in social graphs .",
    "however , the properties of the online social networks may not necessarily apply to the real world .",
    "even the social ties projected in the online world may not necessarily capture the social ties that exist in reality .",
    "online social networks are curated and rather embellished versions of real - life mobility and social interactions .",
    "it is therefore imperative to bridge the gap between the amounts of research on online social networks and the real lives .",
    "this brings forth the need to examine the real world social networks and individual mobility patterns .",
    "such _ real world mobility data _ can be collected through various online services such as geo - tagged tweets , check - ins from foursquare and facebook or from mobile apps data such as whatsapp . since this data is collected from the people who visit certain places at a certain time , the properties inferred from such data are applicable to the real world as opposed to the online social networks .",
    "there are certain disadvantages of collecting data from various online websites .",
    "first , the data can be highly irregular depending on whether the user checked - in at particular places , whether the application was running at that time , whether the gps was switched on by the user etc .",
    "second , it does not track the fine - grained movements of the user at regular intervals .",
    "third , often the check - in location is known however the duration spent at the location may remain unknown . finally , the number of check - in locations visited by the user are unbounded and therefore it is relatively hard to attach a context to every location .",
    "we attempt to demonstrate the power of collecting _ fine - grained behavioral social network data from mobile phones of users_. we introduce * daiict spatio - temporal network ( dssn ) * - a spatiotemporal dataset which addresses the above challenges and produces fine - grained data with each location visited by the users recorded at minute and regular intervals .",
    "the dataset is complimented by an extensive survey of the participants in which demographic , sociability and most importantly ground truth data about social ties with other participants is collected .",
    "we then turn to various experiments conducted on one of the possible lines of research with this dataset- finding the inter - relationship between reported friendship and the time spent together , introducing * temporal diversity * as a feature to infer the strength of friendship between two individuals and comparing its performance to measures of diversity in previous works .",
    "we believe temporal diversity can be beneficial in environments where mobility is governed by schedules and time - tables much like in real life .",
    "we also explore the concept of time diversity and how it evolves with time . *",
    "finally , we discuss the numerous different research avenues that can be pursued using such a fine - grained spatiotemporal dataset . *",
    "the subjects from this study consisted of students pursuing b - tech ict at daiict ( dhirubhai ambani institute of information and communication technology ) , a university located in gujarat , india .",
    "it has a residential campus which spans 60 acres and houses approximately 1,500 students .",
    "this choice of location provided several advantages .    * the movements of the subjects",
    "were largely encapsulated within the geographical boundary of the campus .",
    "this provided us with a finite set of locations that are visited by the subjects at different times . *",
    "each location inside the campus has an inherent function attached to it .",
    "for example , the library is used for reading purposes while the sports center is used for recreational purposes . * the subjects of the study pursuing the b - tech ict program are compulsorily residing within the campus .",
    "the in - campus residence along with the distinct designated buildings for recreation , academics etc inside the campus make it an interesting and reliable microcosm of real world activities , movements and social behaviour .",
    "the data was collected from 46 subjects between the months of march and may , 2016 . for this",
    "paper s analyses , we used a subset of the data collected during the month of april , 2016 . out of the 46 subjects that participated in the study , 36 of them completed the survey conducted in july , 2016 .",
    "the subjects volunteered to become part of the experiment .",
    "for each user , the timestamp , latitude and longitude , elevation , accuracy , satellites , network provider is recorded .",
    "the total number of data points collected are 7,33,403 .",
    "the total number of data points within the month of april are : 6,59,268 ( this subset of data is used for the following analysis ) .",
    "the total number of subjects using the application to record data are 46 .",
    "the data recorded varies in accuracy with an average accuracy of 36.0 meters .      the data was collected from the android - based mobile phones of the subjects .",
    "the subjects installed the gps - logger app which is available on playstore ( https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.crearo.gpslogger ) .",
    "the application exploits the gps capabilities of the mobile phones to log co - ordinates and runs as a background process at all times .",
    "the following functionalities are present in the application :    * logs data from the mobile phones of subjects at a regular interval of 2 minutes on local storage .",
    "since the application is only programmed to log location data , the privacy invasion is minimum as compared to previous such approaches which log voice calls , messages , active applications , phone s charging status etc.@xcite * the data is sent to the server periodically ( every 2 hours ) if the mobile phone is connected to internet . if not , the data file is pushed to a queue and resent at a later time .",
    "* the subjects can not switch off the application ( without  force kill \" or un - installing the application ) .",
    "it shall restart in 30 minutes if the subject attempts to do so . *",
    "the battery consumption is optimized to last as long as possible .",
    "* it is a user - friendly application where the subject only has to press  start logging \" after installing the application .",
    "since the application automatically restarts following any crashes , data losses mainly occur only due to powered - off devices .",
    "the application can be assumed to be running on the phone while the phone is powered - on , however , the accuracy of the dataset generated shall rely on the strength of the gps signal captured .",
    "the strength of the signal shall vary based on the location as well as hardware of the phone .",
    "we therefore have to deal with the accuracy loss and random chunks of missing data that is characteristic of any real - time gps data collection .",
    "an anonymized version of the dataset can be downloaded at : ( https://github.com/deshanadesai/geospat ) .",
    "we conducted an online survey for the subjects who participated in the dssn data collection .",
    "the survey is detailed and focuses on questions to report strength of friendship and estimated average proximity with each subject .",
    "it also includes general questions regarding the subjects social behaviour , participation in various activities , anxiety levels , academic performance etc .",
    "* estimate your average proximity with the person .",
    "( time spent together on an average per day ) * * scale of 1 - 5 ( 1- 0 to 5 minutes , 2- 5 to 30 minutes , 3- 30 minutes to 2 hours , 4- 2 to 4 hours , 5- 4 hours and above ) * estimate strength of friendship with the person . * * scale of 0 - 5 ( 0- do not know the person , 1- acquainted , 2- sort of friends , 3- friends , 4- good friends , 5- very good friends )    * rate your participation in the following activities : * * sports , programming , quizzing , debate , electronics , writing college magazine , dance , e - sports , music , drama , academics , research * native language , birthplace * rate amount of stress experienced , gpa ( academic performance ) , productivity with the time in college , satisfaction with time in college , social comfort , self - confidence .",
    "given a set of users u = ( u1,u2, .. ,un ) and a set of data points recorded by every user u : users location - _ l _ , which consists of latitude and longitude values , the timestamp - _ t _ , the provider used to measure location - _ p _ and finally , the accuracy logged by the provider - _ a_.*the objective is to infer the relationship score between each pair of users based on quantitative values . * _ definition 1 : _ relationship strength is a quantitative measure that tells how strongly associated two people are . _ definition 2 : _",
    "encounter is defined as an event when two users co - occur at the same place at the same time . the distance threshold _",
    "d _ chosen can be varied with the mean accuracy of the logged data points .",
    "one of the pioneering papers that study the behavioral characteristics of friendship and infer social network structure of the real world using mobile data is by nathan eagle et al@xcite .",
    "they study social networks with binary relational ties ( i.e. are two students friends or not ? ) .",
    "however , these binary indicators only provide a very coarse indication of the nature of the relationships , and do not embrace the complexity of human relationships .",
    "our purpose is to estimate the strength of people s relationships based on their interaction frequency , other proximity variables and describe the same in a discrete manner tending to the degree of friendship .",
    "their collection of data includes mobile phone logs , calls , messages , usage of applications etc which is considerably privacy can not be done at scale .",
    "their results showed that the behavioural data collected by the mobile phones and the self - reported data are indeed related .",
    "in addition , the amount of communication was the most significant predictor of friendship .",
    "this is extended by the work of crawnshaw et al . who introduces various features such as specificity , location entropy , etc to analyze social connections .",
    "this study provides an insight into the social network structure showing that there exists a relationship between the mobility patterns of the user and number of friends that the user has in his social network .",
    "further , cyrus et al .",
    "@xcite included the impact of co - incidences and co - occurrences at locations to infer a continuous variable predicting the relationship strength between a pair of subjects .",
    "they compute the strength of relationship by conducting multiple linear regression over location diversity ( the spread of encounters over different locations ) and frequency of encounters weighted by the location entropy ( how crowded a place is ) .",
    "@xcite explore the inherent strucutre in mobility patterns which are governed by geographic and social constraints .",
    "they find that short ranged travel is periodic both spatially and temporally and not affected by social ties , while long - distance travel is more influenced by social networkt ties .",
    "* temporal representation : * the day is divided into intervals of _ t _ minutes .",
    "for example , if _ t _ is 5 minutes , the day can be divided into 288 intervals from 00:00 - 00:05 , 00:05 - 00:10 to 23:55 - 00:00 .",
    "the variable _ t _ can be a maximum of 1440 minutes where the entire day is counted as one interval .",
    "* temporal encounter vector : * temporal encounter vector t@xmath0 contains the total number of times user i and user j had an encounter for each _ t _ minute interval of the day over a period of n days .",
    "the day can be divided into 1440/_t _ intervals and hence the dimensions of the vector are fixed .",
    "example , for t=5 minutes , t@xmath1 = ( 1,3,0,0,0,0, ... 2 ) would mean that user 1 and user 2 had one encounter between 00:00 - 00:05 , three between 00:05 - 00:10 and two between 23:55 - 00:00 across n days .",
    "* temporal diversity : * we introduce a new feature called temporal diversity which can be beneficial in predicting social ties based on spatio - temporal data . _ motivation : _ over a period of days , encounters with a close friend will be spread across different time intervals in a day , as compared to encounters with someone you only meet because of scheduled activities .",
    "essentially , encounters with friends over time do nt follow any rules or schedules and are randomly spread across a day s time - span . on the other hand , encounters with people whom a person meets due to scheduled activities ( eg : for work , lectures , tutorials ) are routine and therefore would occur repeatedly at a scheduled time .",
    "we aim to capture this diversity in encounters over time to infer relationship strength . _",
    "definition : temporal diversity quantifies the effective spread of encounters across time - intervals in a day s timespan . _    given two users i and j , temporal encounter vector @xmath2 contains the total number of times user i and user j had an encounter for each _ t _ minute interval of the day over a period of n days .",
    "let @xmath3 represent an encounter between user i and user j in location l and time interval _",
    "let @xmath4 be the set of co - occurrences of user i and j in all time intervals .",
    "the probability that a randomly picked encounter from the set r(i , j ) happened at time interval t is : @xmath5    if we randomly pick an encounter from the set r(i , j ) and define its time - interval as a random variable then the uncertainty associated with this random variable is defined by the shannon entropy for user i and j as follows : @xmath6    @xmath7    diversity _ d _ is the effective number of t min time intervals user i and j have been together for in a day .    the more spread the encounters are across different time intervals ,",
    "the higher the diversity .",
    "example : if we use the temporal representation with t=120 minutes , you can divide the day in 12 parts as follows : 00:00 - 02:00 ,",
    "02:00 - 04:00 till 22:00 - 00:00 .",
    "user a and user b have a temporal encounter vector t@xmath8 calculated over 14 days such that , t@xmath8 = ( 0,0,0,2,10,3,0,0,0,2,0,0 ) t@xmath9 = ( 3,0,4,0,3,0,2,2,0,0,0,3 ) expanding t@xmath8 for clarity , user a and user b , had 2 encounters in 06:00 - 08:00 interval , 10 encounters in 08:00 - 10:00 interval , 3 encounters in 10:00 - 12:00 interval and 2 encounters in 18:00 - 20:00 interval over 14 days . note : user a and user b have had 17 encounters in 14 days , so have user a and user c. temporal entropy for t@xmath8 = 1.1218 temporal diversity for t@xmath8 = 3.1 temporal entropy for t@xmath9 = 1.7623 temporal diversity for t@xmath9 = 5.8 most encounters for user t@xmath8 happened in the time interval 08:00 - 10:00 which could suggest that they were governed by some schedule such as a common lecture or breakfast routine .",
    "encounters between user a and c are spread across the day and are more random or one might say _ diverse .",
    "_ we want to give less weight to to time intervals where the users have encountered a lot because it could be due to some schedule shared between the users .",
    "they will still contribute , but lesser compared to encounters which were not part of schedules .",
    "our assumption is that interactions with friends overtime are outside the purview of schedules and meeting times will be distributed across the entire day if averaged over n days .",

    "we ve emphasized before how the essence of temporal diversity lies in the growing randomness of encounters across a day over time for users with strong social ties .",
    "hence , it s important to explore how temporal diversity changes for over days for different sub - groups of closeness .",
    "* methodology : * each user has different number of common days for which they share data . for this experiment",
    ", we calculate temporal diversity between pairs of users using only common days less than equal to d , while we sweep d from 1 to 11 . for example , for _ _ d__=3 we calculate temporal diversity between pairs based on data from their respective first three common days . in case",
    "a pair has only 2 common days , temporal diversity for _ _ d__=3 is set as empty .",
    "then , for each sub - group in closeness and common day",
    "_ d _ , we calculate the average temporal diversity .        *",
    "observations : *    * temporal diversity in general increases as the number of common days between two users increases . * for the sub - group _ very good friends _ ,",
    "average temporal diversity is starkly higher than the averages in other sub - groups .",

    "in this paper , we first introduce and release the daiict spatio - temporal social network ( dssn ) dataset which is a granular dataset about 46 participant s movement in a residential college campus over a span of thirty days .",
    "it reflects human patterns guided by routine and schedule in a geographically bounded area of a university .",
    "the data is complemented with rich self reported data about the participants based on an extensive survey capturing demographics , extent of participating in various campus activities , proximity to other participants in the survey and questions pertaining to happiness , sociability and self - confidence .",
    "further , we introduce a new feature called temporal diversity which our experiments confirmed to have superior predictive power for inferring social ties as compared to its counterparts : location diversity and mean encounters .",
    "next , we examined how temporal diversity changes with time and gets better at differentiating between sub - groups of social - ties as the number of common days increase .",
    "lastly , we saw how temporal diversity is robust to sparsity of data collected between two users and can function well even with lesser data .",
    "we believe , temporal diversity can be an useful feature to predict social ties in environments where users are governed by fixed schedules and the number of meaningful unique locations are less .",
    "we believe a bustling resendential university campus is a microcosm of urban lifestyles to some extent .",
    "this work along with releasing of the dssn dataset opens up opportunities to answer interesting multi - disciplinary questions .",
    "how does mobility affect self - confidence , sociability , happiness or gpa ?",
    "do people with similar interests end up in the same social groups ? do people in relationships have a particular mobility pattern ?",
    "are certain time - intervals of meeting more helpful in predicting social ties than others ?",
    "how can one effectively predict social - ties in an environment where co - incidental encounters are abundant due to schedules and closed spaces like in workplaces ? we wish to investigate some of these issues in our future work and at the same time hope that the research community finds the dataset useful to explore some of their own questions .",
