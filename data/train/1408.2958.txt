    "* model specimens .",
    "* in order to investigate the intensity envelope of multiple planes of emission , we first constructed a model specimen consisting of a monolayer of atto 532 dye covalently attached to the surface of a planoconvex silica lens which we placed on top of a broad - band dielectric mirror , as in fig .",
    "we performed single - spot laser - scanning on this specimen with a leica sp5 confocal microscope using a 5x/0.15 n.a .",
    "dry objective and observed concentric fluorescence fringes as in fig .",
    "[ fig1]c , with the fringe spacing as one would expect if the fluorescent monolayer cut through successive antinodal planes of standing - wave excitation .",
    "the centre of the fringes , which is the point of contact between the specimen and the mirror , is dark as expected because the mirror surface is the first node of the standing wave .",
    "this result is the fluorescence equivalent of classic demonstrations of standing light waves @xcite .",
    "we sought to extend this experiment to include objectives of high numerical aperture , such as are needed in cell biology imaging .",
    "these have a limited working distance of a fraction of a millimetre .",
    "we coated a glass coverslip with a thin layer of fluorescein dye and placed this on top of a planoconvex silicon lens ( # 69 - 673 , edmund optics , inc . ,",
    "usa ) which served as a mirror , as in fig .",
    "we performed laser - scanning in this setup using a 40x/1.30 n.a .",
    "oil immersion objective and again obtained a pattern of concentric fluorescence fringes , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1]d , consistent with standing - wave excitation , in spite of the presence of rays at a wide range of angles of incidence .",
    "we discuss the origin of apparently planar antinodal zones in a single - point scanning microscope even with objectives of high numerical aperture ( where the focussed spot produces curved antinodes ) in supplementary section s2 and supplementary fig .",
    "s2 . to verify that the axial fringe spacing is constant and comparable to the antinode spacing @xmath4 , we have plotted the fringe intensity as a function of axial height of the fluorochrome above the reflector surface .",
    "figure  [ fig2]a shows a median section of the half - spherical surface of the specimen in fig .  [ fig1]a , of radius @xmath5 , centred at @xmath6 , in contact with the mirror .",
    "a bright fringe of radius @xmath7 is at a height @xmath8 above the mirror , and the fringe next it , of radius @xmath9 , is at a height @xmath10 .",
    "the height separating these two successive fringes is then obtained from the two triangles formed separately by @xmath7 and @xmath9 , the lengths of which are given by the pythagorean theorem as @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "the separation height is therefore @xmath13 .",
    "taking an intensity profile along a radial line in fig .",
    "[ fig1]c , we are able to plot the fluorescence intensity as a function of radial distance , as in fig .",
    "[ fig2]b . a bright fringe in fig .",
    "[ fig1]c corresponds to a peak in fig .",
    "[ fig2]b , which shows the fringe spacing getting smaller with distance from the centre , which is what we would expect if a fluorescent shell of spherical shape is excited by the evenly - spaced antinodes of a standing wave . using our result above for the height @xmath14 separating two successive fringes , expressed in terms of the radial distance , we are then able to translate the plot in fig .  [ fig2]b into one of fluorescence intensity as a function of height from the mirror surface , as in fig .",
    "[ fig2]c , where we have obtained evenly - spaced peaks of fluorescence emission , corresponding to where the dye is excited by successive antinodes of the standing wave . in the plot",
    "there are 37 peaks , and by locating the positions of the maxima by flipping the function vertically and using _ fminbnd _ in matlab@xmath15 , which finds the minimum of a function within an interval , we find that the antinodal spacing is 255 nm . in the experiment setup , there is only air between the specimen and the mirror ( @xmath16 ) , and using @xmath17 nm for the excitation , we obtain the actual antinode spacing @xmath18 nm , showing that our experimental result is within 0.78 @xmath19 of the actual value .",
    "finally , the measured experimental antinodal spacing in fig .",
    "[ fig2]c and the actual lateral separation of the fringes in fig .",
    "[ fig2]b lead to an accurate reconstruction of the planoconvex specimen in three dimensions , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2]d .",
    "in addition to fluorescence fringes detected at a wide spectral bandwidth of 100 nm , we also observed that the fringes were radially modulated in a precise way particularly when the detection bandwidth was reduced to 5 nm , which is the spectral resolution of the leica sp@xmath15 spectral detector @xcite . in our experiments ,",
    "the modulation has a frequency proportional to the stokes shift , consistent with a moir pattern between the excitation and emission , which occurs at the difference frequency between the periodicity of the excitation standing - wave field and the periodicity of the standing - wave field created by the light at the selected emission wavelength .",
    "a moir pattern arising from the presence of two distinct patterns has a spatial frequency that is the difference frequency between the two individual patterns @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig3_beats ] shows the moir pattern in the directly - observed fringes and clearly demonstrates the increasing frequency as the fluorescence is detected from 550 nm ( fig .",
    "[ fig3_beats]a ) through to 580 nm ( fig .",
    "[ fig3_beats]d ) . taking fig .",
    "[ fig3_beats]d as an example , a moir pattern from 514 nm excitation and 580 nm emission has a theoretical spatial period of @xmath20 nm from @xmath211/514 nm ",
    "1/580 nm . fig .",
    "[ fig3_beats]h plots the fluorescence intensity in fig .",
    "[ fig3_beats]d as a function of height from the mirror surface , using the method described for fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] . using the spacing between peaks in the moir pattern , equal to @xmath22 , we measured a spatial period of 4690 nm , accurate to within 3.8 @xmath19 of the theoretical value .",
    "previous work has shown that when fluorescent molecules are placed close to a mirror , the emitting molecule acts as an oscillating dipole ( an antenna ) and that the reflected and unreflected parts of the emitted fluorescence wave interfere with each other , producing fringes from wide - angle interference @xcite and oscillations in the fluorescence decay time @xcite , with analytic expressions for the radiation patterns derived from electrodynamic theory @xcite and modified further from the fixed - dipole amplitude assumption to model the fluorophore as a dipole of constant power and variable amplitude @xcite .",
    "subsequent work in this area studied the modulation of fluorescence intensity with distance from the mirror , and explained the modulation as a consequence of the interference effects of the excitation and of the emission being both present @xcite .",
    "we have obtained the fluorescence fringes from the standing - wave field created by the self - interference of the emission alone , by replacing the mirror with a laser - line notch filter ( ll01 - 514 - 25 , semrock , inc . ,",
    "usa ) to transmit the excitation and therefore suppress the excitation standing - wave field . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3_beats]e , the modulation in the fringes detected at 580 nm is absent in this case .",
    "more importantly , as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig3_beats]g , subtraction of the 580 nm emission fringe pattern in fig .",
    "[ fig3_beats]e from the fringe pattern of the excitation in fig .",
    "[ fig3_beats]f gives a modulated fringe pattern identical to the moir pattern in fig .",
    ". the spatial period of this modulation , as measured using the peak spacing in fig .",
    "[ fig3_beats]i , is 4670 nm , which is within 3.3 % of the theoretical value , confirming that it occurs at the difference frequency between the excitation and emission .",
    "the observation of a moir pattern of the type we describe here appears to be novel in optical fluorescence microscopy , and suggests a method by which the successive standing wave antinodes could be distinguished by their amplitude .",
    "it may be possible to extend this distinction further to an unequivocal identification by analysis of fringe colour , using multiple colocalised fluorochromes with overlapping excitation spectra but differing in emission wavelength and stokes shift .    in order to test whether the fluorescence fringes that we observed",
    "were caused by standing - wave excitation formed by the interaction of the excitation light with the mirror , and not by a fabry - perot cavity effect , where the silica - air interface on one side and the mirror on the other formed the cavity , we constructed specimens in which we put immersion oil ( @xmath23 ) , pure glycerol ( @xmath24 ) and a solution of 91 @xmath19 glycerol in water ( @xmath25 ) @xcite between the substrate and the mirror in fig .",
    "[ fig1]a . putting a film of fluid that has the same refractive index as the silica lens ( @xmath25 )",
    "@xcite eliminates reflection from the convex surface .",
    "we still observed the concentric fluorescence fringes in all these cases , shown in supplementary fig .",
    "s3 , proving that the fringe pattern is caused by a standing wave only . +",
    "* red blood cells . * recent work has shown elegantly that the first antinode can be positioned near the contact between living cells and their substrate , by growing cells on a dielectric layer of appropriate optical thickness deposited on a reflector @xcite . since we wished to observe multiple antinodes , we selected as specimen red blood cells stained with the plasma membrane - specific dyes dii @xcite , dio @xcite or dii(5 ) @xcite .",
    "we stabilised mouse red blood cells in their characteristic shape of a biconcave disk about 7 - 8 @xmath26 m in diameter and about 1 @xmath26 m thick at the thinnest point at the centre and 2.5 @xmath26 m at the thickest point in the periphery @xcite . for this experiment , we obtained fresh blood by cardiac puncture from healthy mice .",
    "in order to exclude the possibility of lensing or focussing effects from refractile material inside the cell , we also prepared red blood cell ghost specimens in addition to intact red blood cell specimens .",
    "red blood cell ghosts have the same shape as normal red blood cells but with the haemoglobin removed from the interior .",
    "we used the protocol of harris _ et al . _",
    "@xcite for the preparation of the ghosts , which we describe in the _ methods _ section .",
    "we stained the membrane of the prepared ghosts and intact red blood cells with dii , dio or dii(5 ) , and mounted these on top of a mirror .",
    "we also prepared specimens of the ghosts and red blood cells on ordinary non - reflective glass microscope slides , to serve as controls .",
    "all specimens were mounted using 4 @xmath19 bovine serum albumin ( bsa ) in phosphate - buffered saline solution ( @xmath27 ) @xcite to match the average refractive index of the membrane , and imaged with a leica sp5 confocal microscope using a 100x/1.40 n.a .",

    "<S> standing - wave excitation of fluorescence is highly desirable in optical microscopy because it improves the axial resolution . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate here that multiplanar excitation of fluorescence by a standing wave can be produced in a single - spot laser scanning microscope by placing a plane reflector close to the specimen . </S>",
    "<S> we report here a variation in the intensity of fluorescence of successive planes related to the stokes shift of the dye . </S>",
    "<S> we show by the use of dyes specific for the cell membrane how standing - wave excitation can be exploited to generate precise contour maps of the surface membrane of red blood cells , with an axial resolution of @xmath090 nm . </S>",
    "<S> the method , which requires only the addition of a plane mirror to an existing confocal laser scanning microscope , may well prove useful in studying diseases which involve the red cell membrane , such as malaria .    </S>",
    "<S> standing - wave excitation of fluorescence has been achieved previously using two methods : the 4pi geometry , where counter - propagating coherent waves are directed into the specimen @xcite , and the simpler approach of placing a reflector close to the specimen , done in wide - field illumination @xcite , and used recently in laser - scanning @xcite . here </S>",
    "<S> , we have observed that the standing waves close to a reflector are radially modulated in a precise way , and show that this corresponds to a moir pattern between the excitation and emission standing - wave fields . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate that standing - wave - excited fluorescence in red blood cells allows precise contour - mapping of the cell membrane , with an axial resolution of @xmath090 nm , compared with the 300 nm of a confocal microscope @xcite .    in standing - wave fluorescence microscopy using a reflector </S>",
    "<S> , interference can occur between the direct and reflected components of the excitation beam . </S>",
    "<S> this creates a standing wave pattern that excites fluorescence only at the antinodal planes , which are regularly spaced in the axial direction . using an excitation wavelength @xmath1 and a medium of refractive index @xmath2 , and </S>",
    "<S> given that the antinodal planes are parallel to the reflector surface , the axial resolution is improved to the sine squared intensity peaks at the antinodes , with a full width at half maximum of @xmath3 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , the drawback in using standing - wave excitation is that if the specimen is thicker than the antinodal spacing @xmath4 , several planes may be excited simultaneously within the depth of field of the objective lens and their contributions may be hard to separate from each other @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> but if the specimen is simple in structure as in a cell membrane and the height variation is not too rapid across the field of the microscope , distinct excitation fringes can be recognized in xy images and used as contour lines for precise three - dimensional mapping . </S>"
