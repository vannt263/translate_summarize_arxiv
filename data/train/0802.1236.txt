    "however , the geometric frustration for antiferromagnetic ordering within the vanadium sublattice of the spinel structure is likely the reason why long - range antiferromagnetic order is suppressed in pure @xmath4@xmath5 and a heavy electron state emerges instead .",

    "<S> both the @xmath6li nmr spectrum and nuclear spin - lattice relaxation rate are inhomogeneous in the presence of the magnetic defects . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath6li nmr data for the _ powders _ are well explained by assuming that ( i ) there is a random distribution of magnetic point defects , ( ii ) the same heavy fermi liquid is present in the samples containing the magnetic defects as in magnetically pure liv@xmath4o@xmath5 , and ( iii ) the influences of the magnetic defects and of the fermi liquid on the magnetization and nmr properties are separable . in the _ single crystals _ </S>",
    "<S> , somewhat different behaviors are observed , possibly due to a modification of the heavy fermi liquid , to a lack of separability of the relaxation effects due to the fermi liquid and the magnetic defects , to non - fermi liquid behavior of the conduction electrons , and/or to quantum fluctuations of finite - size magnetic defects ( magnetic droplets ) . </S>",
    "<S> remarkably , the magnetic defects in the powder samples show evidence of spin freezing below @xmath7  k , whereas in the single crystals with similar magnetic defect concentration no spin freezing was found down to @xmath8  k. thus different types of magnetic defects and/or interactions between them appear to arise in the powders versus the crystals , possibly due to the substantially different synthesis conditions of the powders and crystals . </S>"
