    "based on the recent results of high - energy heavy - ion collisions at rhic , the early matter produced in the collisions may be a strongly - coupled qgp ( sqgp ) , which has a very high energy density and reaches local thermalization within about 1 fm / c@xcite .",
    "the expansion of the matter after that time may be unstable .",
    "many effects , such as the large fluctuations of the initial transverse energy density@xcite , the sausage instability@xcite , and possible phase transition@xcite , may lead to the fragmentation of the system and the formation of many spherical droplets due to the surface tension of the qgp @xcite .    to describe the evolution of a droplet , we use relativistic hydrodynamics where the energy momentum tensor of a thermalized fluid element in the center - of - mass frame of the droplet is@xcite @xmath5 u^{\\mu}(x ' )   u^{\\nu}(x ' ) - p(x ' ) g^{\\mu \\nu } \\ , , \\ ]",

    "the rhic hbt puzzle of @xmath38 suggests that the pion emitting time may be very short . in order to explain the hbt puzzle",
    ", we consider a granular source of @xmath39 qgp droplets distributed in a distribution @xmath40 as illustrated in fig .",
    "we assume that the evolution of the granular source is simply the superposition of the evolutions of individual droplets with the same initial conditions .",
    "as the average freeze - out time is proportional to the initial radius of the droplet , the freeze - out time and @xmath41 decreases if the initial radius of the droplet decreases . on the other hand , @xmath42 increases if the width of the droplet spatial distribution @xmath40 increases .",
    "a variation of the droplet size and the width of droplet spatial distribution can result in @xmath1 nearly equal to @xmath42 [ @xcite ] .",
    "furthermore , if the granular source has a collective expansion the hbt will measure the size of the region of the ellipse in figure 2(b)@xcite . in this case",
    "the value of @xmath43 decreases even further and may be smaller than unity@xcite .",

    "the average particle emission time scales with the initial radius of the droplet .",

    "some signals of the granular source such as the correlation function fluctuations may likely be suppressed after averaging over many events@xcite .",
    "however , the property of an earlier average emission time of the granular source will remain as it is common to all events and not averaged out by event mixing .",
