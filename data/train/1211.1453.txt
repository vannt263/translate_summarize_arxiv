    "optimal filtering is one of the major themes of research interest in the areas of systems and control .",
    "there are two distinct approaches to filter design which have been applied in the design of filters for systems subjected to process / measurement noise .",
    "the most well known approach to filter design is the kalman filter developed for linear systems in the 1960s @xcite .",
    "the kalman filter uses the statistics of the noise / measurement processes in order to compute the coefficients of the equations used to update the state estimate as new measurements are observed .",
    "an alternative approach is the minimum energy filtering technique developed by mortensen @xcite .",
    "this interpretation views the optimal filtering problem as a optimal control problem where the objective is to minimize the energy of the noise process required to explain the observations .",
    "the resulting filter obtained via both these approaches for the linear system case with white noise processes ( and a quadratic energy function with @xmath1 noise processes ) turns out to be the kalman filter @xcite .    in the case of nonlinear systems ( or non - normal noise ) the congruence in these two approaches no longer holds .",
    "there are various extensions of the kalman filter to nonlinear systems ( e.g. unscented kalman filter @xcite , particle filter @xcite , extended kalman filters @xcite ) .",
    "however the extensions of the deterministic filter to the nonlinear case and non euclidean spaces have only recently garnered greater attention @xcite .",
    "the specific problem of practical interest motivating this work on filter design for nonlinear systems is the attitude estimation problem @xcite on the group of rotation matrices ( the special orthogonal group @xmath0 ) .",
    "recent work by coote et al.@xcite and zamani et al.@xcite studied the deterministic optimal filtering problem for the case of systems evolving on @xmath2 and @xmath0 respectively .",
    "the filter obtained in the latter case is a near optimal solution to the filtering problem ( i.e. it is shown to lie within a specific performance gap from the optimal filter ) .",
    "the motivation in this work on using a near optimal approximation has to do with the numerical intractability of solving the optimal control problem associated with the filter design",
    ". for nonlinear systems standard approaches using the dynamic programming method suffer from larger computational requirements ( termed the curse of dimensionality ) while computing numerical solutions to these classes of problems .",
    "in the recent past , a new class of approaches to manage this computational intractability have been developed for both filtering @xcite and control @xcite for a variety of application domains . in this article",
    "we introduce and solve the hamilton - jacobi - bellman ( hjb ) equation for the optimal control problem ( associated with the filtering problem ) using recently developed theoretical and numerical techniques for nonlinear filtering .",
    "these approaches ( termed min / max - plus methods ) utilize the fact that the dynamic programming operator for the hjb equation is a linear operator on a particular algebra ( the semi - convex functions ) .",
    "hence , in a certain class of problems , it is possible to solve the hjb equation without having to generate a mesh / grid thereby allowing for numerical tractability . by applying these techniques to the current problem",
    "we indicate an approach to achieve dimensionality reduction in filter synthesis for nonlinear systems @xcite  specifically the attitude estimation problem ; thus we extend the max / min - plus filtering methods to the case of a compact lie group ( @xmath0 ) .",
    "this article is organized as follows : we first introduce the system description and the problem statement for the attitude estimation problem in sec .",
    "[ sysandprobdescription ] .",
    "this leads to a consideration of the variation in the parameterization of the value function as it is propagated in time using the dynamic programming propagator .",
    "it is shown in sec .",
    "[ minplusandstructpres ] that this structure is preserved .",
    "hence this permits the use of a specific expansion of the value function in terms of a basis whose form is preserved  allowing for the generation of reduced dimensionality methods for filtering . the theory developed",
    "is then applied to a class of example problems in sec .",
    "[ example ] thereby validating the techniques introduced . in sec .",
    "[ conclusion ] we conclude this article with a description of several interesting avenues for future research into different aspects of the min - plus approach to filtering for the classes of problems described herein .",

    "backward _ time state transition function be defined as @xmath7 thus the operator @xmath8 is the state transition operator , which in this case would be time ordered exponential map .",
    "given measurements @xmath9 , drift @xmath10 , and an initial state estimate @xmath11 the cost function for the filtering problem is given by @xcite @xmath12 where @xmath13 , \\quad r \\in so(3)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath14 denotes the state at time @xmath15 given the choice @xmath5 of the disturbance signals which lie in the space @xmath16 of @xmath1 signals .",
    "thus the cost function is a measure of the weighed sum of the energy in the disturbance in the system dynamics , the unexplained part of the measurements and the error in the initial estimate ( versus the predicted initial estimate as obtained from the choice of the disturbance signal ) .",

    "numerically we make the following assumption .",
    "we use a discretized and bounded version of the disturbance set @xmath16 . for simplicity of notation",
    "we abuse the notation and reuse it to denote the bounded discrete set .",

    "this motivates the following more general proof of the invariance of this affine property . under propagation by the dynamic programming operator",
    "we first indicate the structure preservation and then describe how this approach to solving for the optimal cost function can be used to obtain the state estimate subsequent to propagation of the solution for the duration of the filter time horizon .",

    "this is the reason for the aforementioned non - restrictiveness of the boundedness assumption .",
    "the basis function parameterization sets above evolve via the form @xmath44 .",
    "the above expressions provide the mechanism via which the basis function sequences @xmath45 and their corresponding components @xmath46 and @xmath47 are generated at each time step in response to the new measurements being gathered therein .      having obtained the value function in terms of a min - plus basis expansion we have the following expression for the optimal state estimate . given the observation time horizon @xmath48 ( the window over which we use the observations to generate a state estimate ) , the optimal state estimate is defined as follows @xmath49(r ) ,    \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath50 is the collection of affine functions generated at the time step @xmath48 via the recursive propagation as described in the previous section . in previous approaches to min - plus fitlering for general non - linear systems on euclidean space , quadratic basis functions led to direct approaches to obtain this estimate ( determining the minimum of each of the quadratic functions yields the desired state estimate c.f .",

    "this proceeds by formulating the problem as a convex optimization problem for which computationally efficient techniques exist @xcite .",
    "the details of this approach are as follows .",
    "the minimum value of the optimal cost ( value ) function is achieved at the optimal state estimate .",

    "they serve to be indicative of the levels of performance achievable with minimal effort and hence demonstrate the potential nominal performance achievable from these classes of filters with little effort at tuning them .",
    "this also serves to guide some of the directions which such work could proceed along as described in the next section .",

    "the results obtained reveal the need to study various aspects of these class of techniques .",
    "some of the paths that this work can be directed along are : the study of the sensitivity of various filter weight matrices on the performance of the filter ; the error analysis for a specific value of these parameters ; an analysis of the length of the filtering window and weight matrices on the performance of the filter ; determining the optimal values of these filter parameters for a specific noise process having known statistics ; analysis of the filter robustness to unknown noise / disturbance and unmodeled dynamics ; the consideration of min - plus based deterministic filter design for alternative system models @xcite for attitude tracking problems .",
    "note that in the current article we assume that the number of terms in the basis expansion generated for the given filter time horizon is capable of being stored in memory .",
    "however in the case that this growth in the number of terms if unfeasible , there exist pruning methods @xcite which can be considered in order to manage this growth ( e.g. when the time horizon of the filter or the cardinality of the disturbance process set is larger than the available memory constraints )",
