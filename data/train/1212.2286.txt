    "recently heisenberg antiferromagnets on the triangular lattice have attracted considerable experimental and theoretical interest . among them , cs@xmath1cucl@xmath2 has been under particular scrutiny as it provides an interesting example of a spatially anisotropic spin-@xmath3 triangular antiferromagnet .",
    "@xcite much of the interest in this compound stems from its unusual , non - classical magnetic properties , arising from the competition between the spatial anisotropy , dzyaloshinskii - moriya ( dm ) interactions , and quantum fluctuations .",
    "extensive neutron scattering studies @xcite on the magnetic properties of cs@xmath1cucl@xmath2 revealed several interesting features .",
    "first , despite frustration and low - dimensionality , a long - range magnetic order develops at low temperatures : the observed spin order is incommensurate and sets in at temperatures below @xmath4 k. magnetic excitations above this ground state are also quite unusual . while the low - energy excitation spectrum contains well - defined sharp modes , as expected for an ordered state , a broad continuum is formed at intermediate and high energies .",
    "a number of theoretical proposals have been made to explain the origin of this continuum .",
    "it has been suggested that the existence of a continuum is an indication that the system is proximate to a spin liquid phase that determines the behavior of excitations except for low energies.@xcite an alternative suggestion is that the continuum might originate from magnon - magnon scattering which is enhanced in non - colinear magnets.@xcite    in view of the ambiguity in the interpretation of the neutron scattering data , a complementary experimental analysis of the magnetic properties of cs@xmath1cucl@xmath2 by a different technique is highly desirable .",
    "a very effective and frequently used experimental tool to study low - temperature properties of low - dimensional quantum magnets is the two - magnon raman scattering.@xcite the two - magnon raman intensity is directly related to the spectrum of two interacting magnons in a total spin zero state at vanishingly small momentum and weighted by a form factor that is dependent on the polarization of the incident light .",
    "it contains detailed information on the two - magnon density of states and the magnon - magnon interactions .",
    "therefore , direct comparison of experimental spectra with those obtained from theoretical analysis can lead to rather accurate estimates on values of the superexchange and dm interactions .",
    "in addition , the analysis of the polarization dependence of the magnetic raman scattering@xcite might shed some light on whether the ground state is ordered , as neutron scattering experiments have suggested , or is actually in a spin liquid state , as some theories suggest .",
    "a pronounced polarization dependence would indicate that magnetically ordered state is the most probable candidate for the ground state , and that the observed continuum is due to relatively strong interactions between magnons .",
    "on the other hand , if the raman scattering depends weakly on the scattering geometry , the continuum in neutron scattering might be due to unconventional excitations above a spin liquid ground state .",
    "triangular lattice with anisotropic spin exchanges . ]    in this paper , we carry out a theoretical analysis of two - magnon raman scattering from an anisotropic @xmath0 heisenberg antiferromagnet ( haf ) on a triangular lattice ( see fig.[fig : tri ] ) .",
    "to evaluate the two - magnon raman spectra , we use the well - established , semi - phenomenological loudon - fleury ( lf ) approach.@xcite by chosing model parameters relevant for the compound cs@xmath1cucl@xmath2 , we find that the spectral shape as a function of frequency is sensitive to @xmath5 corrections of the magnon spectrum and is strongly modified by the magnon - magnon interactions in the final state .",
    "the intensity of the two - magnon peak also significantly depends on the scattering geometry which is in contrast with the polarization independence of the magnetic raman response in isotropic haf on triangular lattice.@xcite    the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : model ] , we present a model of cs@xmath1cucl@xmath2 and discuss its classical ground state , which is an incommensurate spin spiral with a pitch vector determined by the competition of anisotropic nearest - neighbor interactions . in sec .",
    "[ sec : larges ] , we first review results of the one magnon excitations in the anisotropic @xmath0 haf to first order in @xmath5 . we show that although @xmath5-corrections are present in the whole brillouin zone ( bz ) , they are less drastic than in the isotropic case of the triangular lattice .",
    "this is due dm interactions , which suppress quantum fluctuations and open a gap at the ordering vector . in sec .",
    "[ sec : ram ] , we first review the lf formalism and then use it to calculate the raman spectra at various levels of approximation , i.e. , using only the bare magnon dispersion , using a magnon dispersion renormalized to order 1/s , and with final state interactions included .",
    "we show that the raman profile is very sensitive to the magnon - magnon interactions and to the scattering geometry .",

    "the small raman intensity @xmath143 at low energies is due to two reasons .",

    "thus , only magnons with momentum near @xmath144 can be excited by photons with frequency @xmath145 .",
    "as one can see from fig .",
    "[ disp ] , the rather steep magnon spectrum in the vicinity of zone center gives rise to a small density of states .",

    "the raman response is non - vanishing but very small for the whole energy range compared with intensities observed in other geometries .",
    "the relative smallness can be understood by comparing this result with the well - studied case of the square lattice , for which the lf operator in the @xmath149 geometry commutes with the heisenberg hamiltonian , and , as a result , the raman response vanishes . in the case of the anisotropic triangular lattice ,",
    "a non - commuting part of the lf operator ( [ loudonf ] ) remains non - zero even for the a@xmath150 geometry .",
    "this part leads to small raman intensities , scaling with the ratio @xmath151 . indeed , as we have discussed earlier , the anisotropic triangular lattice can be viewed as an interpolation between the square and the isotropic triangular lattice by varying @xmath18 .    in fig .",
    "[ thetadep ] , the two - magnon peak is shown as a function of the scattering angle @xmath113 .",
    "a strong dependence on the scattering geometry can be seen : the largest peak intensity is observed at the @xmath152 , i.e. cross - polarization , which gradually decreases and reaches its minimum at @xmath153 or @xmath154 ( though not exactly , the peak intensity is roughly proportional to @xmath155 ) .",
    "this polarization dependence is consistent with the fact that the anisotropy in the present case resembles more that of a rectangular than of an isotropic triangular geometry .",
    "an angular - dependence analysis of the raman spectrum on cs@xmath1cucl@xmath2 is highly desirable as it could provide a potential diagnosis of whether a long - range spin order develops in the ground state .",
    "if an angular dependance similar to the one described above is observed , then the ground state is likely to be an incommensurate spiral .",
    "@xcite on the other hand , a raman response that is independent of the scattering geometry might indicate a spin - liquid ground state ,  @xcite as proposed in some recent theories .",
    "@xcite here some precautions are necessary . since the underlying hamiltonian is spatially anisotropic , the spinon excitations of the proposed spin - liquid phase might inherit the crystal anisotropy to some degree , hence also giving rise to a polarization - dependent raman signal .",
    "this question should be further studied but we believe that even if this is the case , the polarization dependence of the raman response will be much weaker than in the case of spiral magnetic order .    next we incorporate @xmath5 corrections to the raman spectrum .",
    "this can be easily done by replacing the bare energy with the renormalized magnon energy @xmath156 ( 30 ) in the propagator @xmath157 .",
    "the renormalized raman spectra are shown by dashed lines in fig .",

    "we have also shown that through exchange and dm interactions , the spatial anisotropy of the lattice is transferred to the magnon dispersion of the spiral magnetic order .",
    "this makes the two - magnon raman scattering anisotropic and very sensitive to the scattering geometry when the spiral magnetic order is the ground state .",
    "our results on the polarization dependence of the spectrum suggest that raman spectroscopy might be very useful to resolve the ambiguity in the interpretation of the neutron scattering experiments and to gain insight into the magnetic structure of cs@xmath1cucl@xmath2 . a final note . in this paper we used as an input the orientation of the dm vector extracted from neutron scattering in ref .",
    "recent electron spin resonance ( esr ) measurements by povarov et al .",
    "@xcite suggested an alternative orientation of the dm vectors in cs@xmath1cucl@xmath2 , in which the strongest dm interaction is along the spin chains .",
    "the direction of the dm vector is important for magnetic properties of cs@xmath1cucl@xmath2 in the presence of the magnetic field because in this case both the magnetic ground state and the excitation spectra depend on the relative orientation of the external field and the direction of the dm vector.@xcite however , the direction of the dm vector does not affect raman intensity , at least at a qualitative level .",
    "the reasoning is that the change of the orientation of the dm vector does not change the classical ground state of the model ( [ eq : h ] ) and does not change qualitatively the spectrum of spin wave excitations , as in both geometries it s main role is to open the gap .    _",
