    "in a previous paper @xcite of this series ( hereafter referred to as i ) we developed a theory based on the density functional formalism @xcite for the deformation free energy of any system with continuous broken symmetry and applied the theory to derive expressions for the elastic constants of uniaxial nematic and smectic a ( sm a ) phases . in the second paper @xcite ( hereafter is referred to as ii ) the theory was applied to derive expression for all the twelve bulk elastic constants of biaxial nematic phase of orthorhombic symmetry .",
    "these expressions of elastic constants are written in terms of order parameters which characterize the nature and amount of ordering in the phase and the structural parameters which involve the generalized spherical harmonic coefficients of the direct pair correlation function of an effective isotropic liquid the density of which is determined using a criterion of the weighted density - functional formalism .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to expand upon the theory given in i and apply it to those smectic phases in which the director is tilted with respect to the smectic layer normal .",
    "this class of smectics include sm c , sm i , sm f and sm k phase and their chiral versions .",
    "in general , smectic liquid crystals have a stratified structure with the long axes of the rod - like or lath - like molecules parallel to each other in the layers .",
    "this situation corresponds to partial breakdown of translational invariance . since a variety of molecular arrangements are possible within each layer a number of smectic phases are possible .",
    "thus a smectic is defined by its periodicity in one direction of space and by its point group symmetry which is continuous or discrete subgroup of @xmath0 . in this article",
    "we are confined to those smectic phases which point group symmetries are @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "most important phases of this class of smectics as far as elasticity is concerned , are sm c and sm@xmath3 phases .    in sm",
    "c the molecules are arranged as shown in fig.1 .",
    "each smectic layer is a two dimensional liquid .",
    "the director @xmath4 makes a finite angle with the normal to the layer .",
    "the tilted orientational order is described by a two dimensional unit vector which is along the projection of @xmath4 on the layer and is denoted as @xmath5 ( see fig.1 ) .",
    "the direction of @xmath6 is defined relative to a chosen axis in the plane and simultaneously with the sign of projection of @xmath4 on the normal to the layer .",
    "the correlation of the tilt direction of different layers implies that @xmath5 must be uniform over macroscopic distance .",
    "though sm c is @xmath7 symmetric , such symmetry operation does not hold for the @xmath5 -director .",
    "the states described by @xmath5 and @xmath8 are not equivalent and hence @xmath5 is a two dimensional polar vector .",
    "the tilted structure introduces biaxiallity within the layers and sm c is optically biaxial with point symmetry @xmath1 .",
    "the other non - chiral smectic phases of this class namely sm i , sm f and sm k all possess more order than the sm c phase . in these each smectic layer is an independent two dimensional bond orientational ordered system .",
    "the coupling between neighbouring hexatic layers drives the quasi long range hexatic bond - orientational ordering of a layer into a truly long range ordered hexatic state .",
    "therefore these phases have long ranged bond - orientational order but short ranged positional order in the layer in a three dimensional stacked hexatic systems .",
    "the director @xmath4 , as in sm c , makes a finite angle with the layer normal .",
    "these phases , in spite of having quite different local order , have the same symmetry as a sm c phase .",
    "the phase transition between sm c and one of the tilted hexatic phases is found to be first order .",
    "this transition is analogous to the 3-dimensional liquid to vapor transition which is first order upto a critical point , and beyond the critical point there is no real phase transition .",
    "one can go continuously from one to the other phase without phase transition at all .",
    "the expression for the elastic free energy density for these phases are , therefore , similar to that of sm c ; the difference can be only quantitative . in view of this",
    "we discuss the elasticity of sm c phase only .",
    "the chiral smectic c ( sm@xmath3 ) has modulated structure at a scale dimension of the order of 1 @xmath9 m and larger .",
    "the modulated ( helical ) structure occurs as a result of a precession of the molecular tilt about an axis perpendicular to the layer planes .",
    "the tilt direction is rotated through an azimuthal angle @xmath10 on moving from one layer to the next . as the rotation is in a constant direction ,",
    "a helix is formed which is either left or right handed . in sm@xmath3 the mirror plane is lost but @xmath2 axis is present locally in each smectic layer ( it is perpendicular to the plane containing the molecular axes ) . the @xmath2 axis in the case of sm@xmath3 phase is a polar axis which admits the existence of a spontaneous polarization along it .",
    "the sm@xmath3 phase therefore exhibits ferroelectricity .",
    "many compounds exhibit phases such as antiferroelectric ( sm@xmath11 ) , ferroelectric ( sm @xmath12 ) etc in addition to sm@xmath3 , as the temperature is varied .",
    "the director @xmath4 in the sm@xmath11 phase , like in sm@xmath3 phase is uniformly tilted with respect to the layer normal .",
    "however , unlike in sm@xmath3 phase , the difference in azimuthal angle of * n * in successive layer is @xmath13 .",
    "the small angle @xmath14 gives rise to helical structure of * n * along the layer normal and arises from the chirality of the constituent molecules . in sm@xmath12",
    "the layers are stacked in such a way that there is a net overall ( in contrast to sm@xmath11 phase ) spontaneous polarization .",
    "this means the number of layers of opposite polarization is not equal .",
    "the elasticity associated with the structure of all chiral smectic phases is same as that of sm@xmath3 phase .",
    "the paper is organised as follows : in sec .",
    "ii we describe the elastic continuum theory for sm c and sm@xmath15 phases and derive expression for the elastic free energy density .",
    "this expression is then written in terms of deformation variables so that it becomes appropriate for comparison with an expression found from microscopic theory .",
    "the density functional approach has been used in sec .",
    "iii to describe the deformed state of smectics with tilted orientational order .",
    "the expression for the deformation free energy density derived here is more general than that given in i in the sense that all the cases discussed in i correspond to tilt angle equal to zero .",
    "the expressions for the elastic constants are derived by comparing the elastic free energy found from the density functional theory with that given in sec ii .",
    "these expressions of the elastic constants involve the order parameters which measure the nature and amount of ordering in the system and direct pair correlation function ( dpcf ) of an effective isotropic liquid . in sec.iv",
    "we discuss the relative magnitude of these constants using reasonable guess for the order parameters and the spherical harmonic coefficients of the dpcf .",
    "an undeformed smectic has parallel and equidistant layers and position independent director .",
    "when some small amplitude long wavelength distortions are imposed on this ideal state , layers may get displaced and curved .",
    "let @xmath16 represent displacements of the layer normal to their planes . a layer at @xmath17",
    "before displacement is now at @xmath18    we choose a space - fixed ( sf ) frame @xmath19 such that its @xmath20-axis is along the normal to the unperturbed smectic layers ( see fig.1 ) .",
    "the system is described by ( i ) the angle @xmath21 of director @xmath5 with respect to @xmath22-axis and ( ii ) the vertical displacement @xmath23 of the layers whose derivatives @xmath24 represent small angles of rotation about @xmath25 and @xmath26-axes , respectively .",
    "since the free energy of a system with broken continuous symmetry is invariant with respect to spatially uniform displacements and rotations that take the system from one point in the ground state manifold to another , the elastic free energy must be function of derivatives of @xmath27 or second order derivatives of @xmath23 which correspond to the curvature of the planes .",
    "the contribution to free energy density due to deformation is called elastic free energy density @xmath28 . to find @xmath28",
    "one expands @xmath29 that belongs to the deformed state around the ideal state having the free energy density @xmath30 .",
    "the expansion is expressed in terms of the spatial derivative of the order parameter fields .",
    "the elastic continuum theory deals only with small spatial derivatives .",
    "consequently , only the lowest order terms in the expansions are taken into account .    because of the symmetry of sm c the free energy density must be invariant of the simultaneous transformations @xmath31 ( due to centre of symmetry ) and by the transformation @xmath32 as the vertical @xmath33 plane is the plane of symmetry .",
    "thus for the elastic free energy density one has @xcite",
    "@xmath34    where @xmath35 represents contribution arising due to distortion of director @xmath5 while @xmath36 is associated with curvature of layers .",
    "@xmath37 represents the contribution arising due to coupling of different deformation modes whereas @xmath38 represents the contribution due to variation in layer thickness as in sm a. thus @xcite    @xmath39    where @xmath40 describes the variation in the thickness of layers .    to derive expressions for @xmath41 we consider director triad formed by three orthonormal unit vectors @xmath42 and let at origin the director @xmath5 is along the @xmath25-axis of sf frame , @xmath43 along @xmath20 - axis , _ i.e. _ along normal to the layers and @xmath44 along @xmath26-axis , _ i.e. _",
    "@xmath45    the orientation of the director triad at a neighbouring point is rotated with respect to the space - fixed coordinate frame due to deformation and is given as @xmath46    because of orthonormality condition of director triad @xmath47    for small deviations we have @xmath48    combining the three orthonormal vectors @xmath49 we can form nine invariants .",
    "the elastic free energy density can be expressed in terms of these invariants @xcite @xmath50    note that the invariants @xmath51 , and @xmath52 correspond to variation of layer compression ( or dilation ) along @xmath26 and @xmath25-axes , respectively : @xmath53 these terms are omitted as their contributions are small compared to linear term @xmath38 ( see eqn . ( 2.4 ) ) .",
    "we are therefore left with six independent invariants .",
    "the elastic free energy density due to orientational deformation of sm c can be written in terms of these six independent invariants .",
    "each term should , however , satisfy the symmetry elements of sm c. note that @xmath54 plane is a symmetry plane , @xmath44 is @xmath2 axis and there is also inversion symmetry .",
    "we can therefore write elastic free energy density as a sum of square of each invariant and their products taken in such a way that @xmath55 and @xmath5 enter the expansion in an even number of times ( _ i.e. _ @xmath55 and @xmath5 are considered without discrimination ) and @xmath44 which also appear even number of times but on its own . thus    @xmath56    since @xmath57 it is the sum of two gradient terms ( surface terms ) and a term analogous to @xmath58 .",
    "similar decomposition can also be made for @xmath59 .",
    "we therefore have only two independent terms in the expression of @xmath37 due to coupling between the deformation of director * c * and the curvature of smectic layers , as given in ref.[4 ] .",
    "since @xmath35 involves director @xmath5 and can be written in terms of @xmath60 and @xmath61 as @xmath62    therefore the constants @xmath63 , @xmath64 , @xmath65 , @xmath66 can be identified as elastic constants associated with bend , splay , twist and coupled twist - bend modes of deformations of director @xmath5 and have the dimension of energy per unit length ( dynes ) .",
    "the last term in eq.(2.11a ) is allowed because of the sm c is invarient under the simulataneous transformation @xmath67 and @xmath68 .",
    "these constants are expected to be comparable in magnitude to the frank elastic constants of a homologous nematic phase .",
    "the contribution @xmath36 is analogous to sm a and is due to layer deformation ( curvature ) .",
    "the term @xmath69 , @xmath70 and @xmath71 represent splay contribution of a system of a monoclinic symmetry as sm c has @xmath1 symmetry in contrast to @xmath0 of sm a. the value of these constants are therefore expected to be of the same order of magnitude as in sm a phase .",
    "@xmath72 ( see eq.(2.4 ) ) which has dimension of energy per unit volume is associated with possible change of interlayer distance .",
    "since sm c@xmath73 has no inversion symmetry , its elastic free energy density may have terms linear in invariants of eq ( 2.9 ) .",
    "however , due to symmetry requirements only those invariants which involve @xmath55 and @xmath5 in pairs without discrimination and @xmath74 alone contribute to linear terms .",
    "thus @xmath75 where superscript ( 1 ) stands for linear terms . in terms of @xmath76 vector field    @xmath77    out of the three terms in eq.(2.15 ) the term @xmath78 is most important as it corresponds to simple twist of director @xmath5 .",
    "the terms @xmath79 corresponds to bend of director @xmath5 while @xmath80 tends to transform a flat layer into a twisted ribbon .",
    "the terms @xmath79 and @xmath80 are expected to be negligible in comparison to @xmath78 term .",
    "if @xmath81 where @xmath65 is defined in eq.(2.11a ) the contribution @xmath82 for sm c@xmath73 is modified to @xmath83 while other terms of eq.(2.11 ) remain same .",
    "the ground state of sm c@xmath73 has a helical structure .",
    "the @xmath65 term can therefore be considered to be a contribution due to deformation from this uniform helical structure .",
    "the expressions for the elastic constants are obtained by comparing the expression of elastic free energy density obtained from the continuum theory and from a microscopic theory involving molecular parameters . in order to make this comparison possible",
    "we have to rewrite eq.(2.16 ) in terms of distortion vectors defined below .",
    "since in the ground state the directors are position independent we take @xmath19 to be the unperturbed director frame at a point @xmath84 .",
    "let @xmath19 be described by the unit vectors @xmath85 such that ( see eq .",
    "( 2.5 ) )    @xmath86    let s be the perturbed director frame described by the unit vector @xmath87 such that ( see eq . ( 2.6 ) )    @xmath88    where @xmath89 may be regarded as the distortion vectors , and let @xmath90 be the components of the perturbed directors with respect to @xmath19 frame .",
    "the transformation from @xmath19 to @xmath91 is effected by @xmath92 orthogonal matrix @xmath93 with element @xmath94 such that @xmath95 the orthogonality condition @xmath96 leads to @xmath97 where prime on summation indicates no summation over @xmath98 .",
    "thus for small deformations @xmath99 where @xmath100 means first order small quantity .    from above relations",
    "it follows that @xmath101 , @xmath102 and @xmath103 can be regarded as basic independent distortion variables ; all as a function of @xmath84 .",
    "every other component can be constructed with the help of eq.(2.20 ) .    from above discussions",
