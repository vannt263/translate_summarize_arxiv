    "sequences of collapses and revivals in the wavepackets temporal evolution are a well known aspect of quantum dynamics .",
    "this phenomenon has been theoretically understood @xcite and to date it has been observed in striking experiments with atoms and molecules @xcite , bose - einstein condensates @xcite and recently in coherent states in a kerr medium @xcite .",
    "moreover , quantum revivals have been studied theoretically in low - dimensional quantum structures as graphene , graphene quantum dots and rings in perpendicular magnetic fields @xcite    in this paper we show that the analysis of wavepacket quantum revivals can be carried out using the fisher - shannon product @xmath0 , defined as @xcite : @xmath1 with @xmath2 being the fisher information , @xmath3 the shannon entropy , and @xmath4 the so - called entropy power @xcite .",
    "it is known that these information measures show complementary descriptions of the spreading or concentration of the probability density , where the fisher information gives a local measure of the spreading ( due to the gradient in the functional form ) , whereas the shannon entropy provides a global one .",
    "this entropic product has proved useful in the analysis of different physical situations , i. e. , electronic correlation @xcite , atomic physics @xcite , chemical reactions @xcite , quantum phase transitions @xcite , astrophysics @xcite or in the study of geophysical phenomena @xcite .",
    "there is a generalization of the fisher - shannon product , the so - called fisher - rnyi product @xcite .",
    "note here the existence of other important complexity measures which have also been used in the description of a great variety of systems ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "we shall consider the fisher - shannon information product as it applies to quantum revival phenomena .",
    "in particular , we shall show the role of this quantity in the dynamics of two model systems that exhibits sequences of quantum collapses and revivals : the so - called quantum ` bouncer ' ( that is a quantum particle bouncing against a hard surface under the influence of gravity ) and a graphene quantum ring model .",
    "it is well known that the temporal evolution of localized bound states @xmath5 for a time independent hamiltonian is given in terms of the eigenvectors @xmath6 and eigenvalues @xmath7 as @xmath8 where @xmath9 are the fourier components of the vector @xmath5 , and @xmath10 is the main quantum number of the system ( in general one has to consider the set of quantum numbers corresponding to the system , see @xcite , but in this paper we will consider only systems with one quantum number ) .",
    "now , a wavepacket is constructed with the coefficients @xmath11 tightly centered around a large value of @xmath12 , with @xmath13 . the exponential factor in ( [ expansion ] )",
    "can then be written as a taylor expansion around @xmath14 ( within this approximation , @xmath10 is a continuous variable ) as @xmath15 \\notag \\\\ = & \\exp\\left(-i\\omega_0 t - 2\\pi i(n - n_0 ) t / t_{\\rm cl } -2\\pi i ( n - n_0)^2 t / t_{\\rm r } + \\cdots \\right)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where each term in the exponential ( except for the first one , which is a global phase ) defines a characteristic time scale , that is , @xmath16 and @xmath17 ( see @xcite for more details ) .",
    "the so called fractional revival times can be given in terms of the quantum revival time - scale by @xmath18 , where @xmath19 and @xmath20 are mutually prime .",
    "next , we study the wave packet dynamics by means of the so - called entropy product , i.e. , the product of the fisher information and the shannon entropy power , @xmath21 , to conclude that it provides another framework for visualizing fractional revival phenomena . again",
    ", we expect that the formation of a number of minipackets of the original packet will correspond to relative minima of the information product . before proceeding ,",
    "recall that @xmath0 satisfies the isoperimetric inequality @xcite    @xmath22    the equality is reached for gaussian densities . by combining the above inequality with the stam uncertainty principle @xcite @xmath23 and the power entropy inequality @xcite @xmath24 leads to the usual formulation of the uncertainty principle in terms of the variance in conjugate spaces , @xmath25 .",
    "it is straightforward to show that the equality limit of these four inequalities is reached for gaussian densities .",
    "quantum states of matter in a gravitational field have been recently realized experimentally with neutrons @xcite .",
    "these were allowed to fall towards a horizontal mirror which , together with the earth s gravitational field , provided the necessary confining potential well . from a theoretical point of view , this constitutes an example of the quantum variant of a classical particle subject to a uniform downward force , above an impermeable flat surface .",
    "the revival behavior of quantum bouncers has been discussed in @xcite and an entropy - based approach was carried out in @xcite . here , we shall evaluate the goodness of the entropy - product when applied to a quantum bouncer .",
    "the time dependent solution of the schrdinger equation for the potential @xmath26 if @xmath27 and @xmath28 otherwise reads @xmath29 where the eigenfunctions and eigenvalues are given by @xcite @xmath30 in the above equation , position and energy variables have been rescaled , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , and are denoted by primed symbols .",
    "@xmath33 is a characteristic gravitational length , @xmath34 is the airy function , @xmath35 denotes its zeros , and @xmath36 is the @xmath37 normalization factor . @xmath38 and",
    "@xmath36 were determined numerically by using scientific subroutine libraries for the airy function , although accurate analytic approximations for them can be found in @xcite . in the remainder of this paper , the primes on the energy and position variables will be omitted and we shall assume initial conditions that correspond to gaussian wave packets localized at a height @xmath39 above the surface , with a width @xmath40 and an initial momentum @xmath41 , @xmath42 the corresponding coefficients @xmath11 of the wave function ( [ wavefunction ] ) can be obtained analytically as @xcite , @xmath43 \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\times { \\rm ai}\\left(z_0-z_n+\\frac{\\sigma^4}{16 } \\right),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath44 .",
    "it is now a straightforward calculation to obtain for the classical period and the revival time @xmath45 and @xmath46 , respectively @xcite .",
    "the temporal evolution of the wave packet in momentum - space is obtained numerically by the fast fourier transform method .",
    "we have computed the temporal evolution of the entropy product ( [ fs ] ) for the initial conditions @xmath47 , @xmath41 , and @xmath48 .",
    "figure [ fig1 ] displays @xmath49 and the location of the main fractional revivals .",
    "it can be neatly observed that the entropic product decreases and reaches a minimum at most of the fractional revivals , where the quasiclassical behavior and a gaussian shape are recovered .",
    "notice how the initial value of unity for the information product is approximately recovered at the full revival , when the gaussian form of the wavepacket is roughly restored .",
    ", and @xmath50 in a quantum bouncer .",
    "the main fractional revivals are indicated by vertical dotted lines .",
    ", scaledwidth=85.0% ]      we shall consider the behavior of the fisher - shannon information in another physical situation .",
    "let us consider a graphene quantum ring within a simplified model @xcite which is described by the hamiltonian @xmath51 where @xmath52 corresponds to each of the two inequivalent corners @xmath53 and @xmath54 of the first brillouin zone , @xmath55 is the momentum measured relatively to the @xmath53 ( @xmath56 ) point , @xmath57 a finite mass term , @xmath58 m / s is the fermi velocity , and @xmath59 where the components are the pauli matrices .",
    "we shall work using a geometrical approximation of a zero width ring with radius @xmath60 ( used in @xcite ) .",
    "the eigenstates and eigenfunctions are given in polar coordinates by @xcite @xmath61 @xmath62 @xmath63 where @xmath64 , @xmath65 and @xmath66 , and with @xmath67 with @xmath68 , @xmath69 , @xmath70 being the eigenvalue of the total angular momentum @xmath71 .",
    "now we shall construct the initial wave packet centered around an eigenvalue @xmath72 . in fig .",
    "[ ring ] the fisher - shannon product for a ring of @xmath73 nm , @xmath74 mev and @xmath75 mev is depicted .",
    "we can observe a quasiclassical evolution ( with a period of @xmath76 ns ) at early times , which corresponds to a minimum in the fisher - shannon product .",
    "we can see that at @xmath77 ( and at multiples times of it ) , where the wave - packet recovers its quasiclassical behavior , we have a relative minimum again .",

    "we have presented an analysis of quantum wavepacket revival phenomena in the quantum bouncer and a graphene ring , based on the information product .",
    "we have shown that this theoretical tool ( which has proved to be useful for the analysis of different phenomena in atomic physics , molecular reactions , solids , and even in geophysics ) appropriately describes the dynamics of wavepackets .",
    "in particular , we have found that the revivals and fractional revivals of wavepackets correspond to relative minima in the entropic product , signaling the recovery of the quasiclassical behavior of the wavepacket .",
