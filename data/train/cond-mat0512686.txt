    "the densest way to cover a large area with non - overlapping unit disks is as in figure  [ fig : disks ] .",
    "= 2.8truein @xmath0    a * packing * is a collection of congruent copies of a subset with pairwise disjoint interiors .",
    "see @xcite for a proof that the above packing is indeed densest possible for unit disks .",
    "it is an old unsolved problem to understand whether densest packings of spheres , simplices or other shapes , in a euclidean or hyperbolic space of any dimension , exhibit crystallographic symmetry .",
    "for instance , this is the spirit of hilbert s eighteenth problem ; see @xcite for background",
    ".    using physics models of two- and three - dimensional matter as a guide , we are tempted to try to gain insight about densest packings by considering packings at densities below the maximum .",
    "( for an example concerning spheres in @xmath1 , see @xcite . ) in effect , we are emphasizing not so much that densest packings and sparse packings differ by their _ symmetry _",
    ", as that they differ in some fundamental geometric fashion . indeed , it is commonly suggested in the physics literature ( see for instance @xcite ) that 2-dimensional models of matter do not exhibit crystallographic symmetry , and it is sometimes said by mathematicians that in high dimensional euclidean space , densest packings of spheres may not have crystallographic symmetry .",
    "so perhaps it is appropriate to reexamine the precise manner in which densest packings differ fundamentally from sparse packings , and to use packings at less than optimum density as a guide .",
    "the density of the unit disk packing of figure  [ fig : disks ] is @xmath2 ; packings of density 0.89 ( say ) can be obtained by shrinking the disks slightly , shaking the whole collection , and then expanding the whole picture to recover unit - size disks .",
    "one might ask whether by doing this one preserves long - range correlations .",
    "experiments and discrete models indicate that such long - range correlations are indeed preserved , but this has never been proved .",
    "see @xcite for background .    in this work we prove the conjectured behavior , not for disks but for deformed disks , copies of a `` zipper '' tile designed specifically for the purpose ; see figure [ fig : tile ] .",
    "this tile can cover the plane completely , in which case the packing has density 1 , and is completely connected in any sense .",
    "what we show is that even at somewhat lower densities , the uniform random packing still has rich structure ; in particular it has a form of connectedness associated with site percolation @xcite .",
    "what this means for packing large but finite boxes ( with torus boundary conditions ) is that the necessary gross irregularities of most packings at such high densities occur , but not in a way to disconnect the packings .",
    "although we define  uniform random packing \" of the plane by limits of measures on packings of finite boxes , the key to our proof is to examine isometry - invariant probability measures on packings of the whole plane and to show that the ones that maximize  degrees of freedom per tile \" are unique for high densities .    in physics one",
    "is interested in change of behavior as density changes .",
    "we show that at high density there is a nonzero probability of an infinite linked component , and that this probability is zero at low density .",
    "thus , there are different `` phases '' of the packings @xcite .",
    "( this is the same phase transition seen in continuum percolation , where one looks at overlapping disks with random independent centers , but our methods are quite different . indeed , no such result is known for packings of disks . )",
    "although we believe such a result also holds for packings of disks or of spheres  pairs of which would be called `` linked '' if sufficiently close  we are able to prove the result only for our tiles , which are shaped to allow three well - defined levels of pairwise separation .",
    "it is generally understood that crystalline behavior is not seen in two dimensions , so the form of connectedness we use may be useful in understanding the role of geometry in hilbert s problem .",
    "we consider packings by a deformed disk denoted by @xmath3 , referred to as `` the tile '' and depicted in figure [ fig : tile ] . in this section , we define it precisely .",
    "let @xmath4 be a regular hexagon of area 1 .",
    "let @xmath5 be the radius of the in - circle of @xmath4 .",
    "let @xmath6 be a disk concentric with the in - circle and of radius @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is a number we shall choose more precisely later .",
    "we shall construct the shape @xmath3 by modifying @xmath4 as follows ; @xmath6 will be called the * shadow disk * of @xmath3 .",
    "= 2.7truein @xmath9    = 3.7truein @xmath10    as shown in figure [ fig : tile ] , the tile @xmath3 equals @xmath4 with each side modified by a `` fringe '' and each corner modified by a hook and inlet , where a hook is about half an element of the fringe .",
    "as shown in figure [ fig : measure ] , the fringe height is @xmath11 .",
    "the elements of the fringe have two different size `` necks '' , one of size @xmath12 and one of size @xmath13 , allowing neighboring tiles to be linked in either of two well - defined modes , `` tight linked '' and `` loose linked '' , the former illustrated in figure [ fig : tight ] and the latter illustrated in figure [ fig : loose ] .",
    "we say that two tiles @xmath3 are * linked * ( tightly or loosely ) if when one is held fixed , the other can be moved continuously only by a bounded amount ( without overlapping the first ) .",
    "a * tight * link is one that permits no movement of one tile while fixing the other ,",
    "while a link that is not tight is called * loose*. a key feature of our model is that when two tiles are tightly linked , any motion of one would necessitate a corresponding motion of the other . as we shall explain , the uniform probability distribution on packings of the plane at given density is a limit of such a distribution on packings of larger and larger tori . in our model ,",
    "these distributions on packings of finite tori are concentrated on packings with the maximal number of degrees of freedom , and therefore intuitively the fewest possible number of tiles bound by tight links .",
    "this gives us useful control on the packings in the support of our distributions .",
    "= 3.5truein @xmath14    = 3.5truein @xmath15    a tile is called * fully linked on one side * if it is linked with another tile on that side in such a way that either they are tight linked and the line joining their centers goes through the midpoint of the sides of the corresponding hexagons ; or the tiles are not tight linked but can be moved continuously so that their shadow disks touch each other .",
    "a tile is * fully linked * if it is fully linked on all sides .",
    "we note that the fully tight - linked packing ( figure  [ fig : tight ] ) corresponds to a tiling by the original hexagon and has density 1 , and that the tile has area 1 by construction .",
    "to state our results we need some notation .",
    "let @xmath16 be the space of all packings of the plane by the tile @xmath3 . given a compact subset @xmath17 of the plane and two packings of the plane",
    ", we consider the distance between the two packings with respect to @xmath17 to be the hausdorff distance between the unions of the tiles in the respective packings intersected with @xmath17 .",
    "then @xmath16 is endowed with the topology of hausdorff convergence on compact subsets ; @xmath16 is compact .",
    "intuitively , two packings are close in @xmath16 if they are close in the hausdorff sense in a large ball centered at the origin .",
    "we shall define a probability measure on @xmath16 that is `` uniform '' on the set of all packings of a fixed density . for this",
    ", we shall need the space @xmath18 of all packings by the tile of the @xmath19 torus @xmath20 .    for any integer @xmath21 ,",
    "let @xmath22 consist of those packings which contain exactly @xmath21 tiles ( @xmath23 is empty if @xmath21 is large enough ) . to each tile",
    ", we assign the set of @xmath24 unit vectors based on its center and pointing to the center of each of its edges . through this assignment",
    ", we can view @xmath23 as a subset of @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the unit tangent bundle of the @xmath27 torus modulo a @xmath28 rotation and the symmetric group @xmath29 acts by permuting the factors .",
    "when @xmath30 is small , @xmath23 is @xmath31-dimensional .",
    "however , when @xmath30 is sufficiently large , the dimension of @xmath23 inside @xmath25 is less than @xmath32 .",
    "this is because at least two tiles in any packing of @xmath23 will have to be tightly linked , so that it is impossible to move one continuously without moving the other .",
    "thus it is useful to decompose @xmath23 into a ( finite ) disjoint union of sets @xmath33 of packings containing exactly @xmath34 tight links .",
    "generically , the dimension of @xmath33 is @xmath35 .",
    "the dimension can be strictly less than this if the packings are jammed in the sense of @xcite , although this fact will not be important for us .",
    "the * top dimension * of @xmath36 means the maximum dimension of all @xmath33 .",
    "let @xmath37 be the probability measure on @xmath23 obtained by normalizing the hausdorff measure on @xmath23 in the top dimension of @xmath23 with respect to the natural metric inherited from @xmath25 .",
    "we interpret @xmath37 as being a uniform measure .",
    "the fact that @xmath37 is supported on those packings with the fewest number of tight links will be crucial in the analysis to follow .",
    "let @xmath38 be the space of all @xmath39-periodic packings of the plane .",
    "in other words , @xmath38 consists of those packings that are preserved under translations by @xmath40 . under the quotient map ,",
    "this space is naturally identified with @xmath41 .",
    "therefore , we can view the measures @xmath37 as living on @xmath42 .    for a fixed density @xmath43 $ ] , let @xmath44 be any measure obtained as the weak * limit of measures of the form @xmath37 such that @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "( note that @xmath30 is the density of every packing in the support of @xmath37 and @xmath47 is the average density of a packing chosen with respect to @xmath44 : see lemma [ lem : cont ] . ) a priori , @xmath44 may not be unique , although we shall prove that it is for large enough @xmath47 .",
    "as we have seen , two tiles @xmath3 can be linked .",
    "therefore it makes sense to speak of a * linked component * of a packing ; it is a maximal sub - packing such that for every two tiles @xmath48 in it , there is a sequence @xmath49 such that @xmath50 is linked to @xmath51 ( @xmath52 ) .",
    "a * tight - linked component * is defined similarly , but we require @xmath50 to be tightly - linked to @xmath51 .",
    "we say that a measure on the space @xmath16 of packings is invariant if it preserved under the full isometry group of the plane .",
    "all the measures we consider are probability measures unless stated otherwise .",
    "let @xmath53 be the unique invariant measure on tilings ( packings that cover @xmath54 ) by our tile .",

    "[ thm : low1 ] for some @xmath62 , the probability ( with respect to any @xmath44 for any @xmath63 ) that the origin is inside an infinite linked component is zero .",
    "for small @xmath64 , if tiles @xmath65 and @xmath66 are not tightly linked and do not overlap , then the distance between their centers is at least @xmath67 .",
    "consider the line segment from the center of @xmath65 to the center of @xmath66 .",

    "if the tiles are not linked , then the claim is obvious .",
    "if they are linked , then to minimize the distance , it must be that their fringes match up ( so they are fully linked on one side ) .",
    "thus the closest they can come is if the two are pushed flat up against each other so that their shadow disks touch . in this case , the distance between the centers is exactly @xmath69 .",
    "we shall say that two tiles are * densely loose linked * if they are loose linked and their shadow disks touch .",
    "there is a unique invariant measure on maximally dense packings by congruent disks @xcite .",
    "hence the probability measure @xmath55 that we defined earlier is the unique invariant measure on packings by @xmath3 such that all tiles are fully and densely loose linked .",

    "we begin with a lemma that holds for any tile shape ( in fact , for any _ collection _ of shapes and sizes , as long as each can be fit into a disk of some fixed radius @xmath189 , and `` density '' is interpreted as number of tiles per unit area ) .",
    "[ lem : poisson ] for small enough density @xmath47 , if a packing @xmath71 is drawn from @xmath44 , then the probability that the disk @xmath249 of radius @xmath250 about the origin contains more than @xmath251 tile centers goes to zero as @xmath252 .",
    "let @xmath189 be the radius of the smallest disk containing the tile ( in our case , @xmath189 is about @xmath253 ) and choose @xmath254 for our zipper tiles with small enough @xmath64 , @xmath255 suffices .",
    "let @xmath256 be the set of tiles whose centers fall in @xmath249 , @xmath257 and @xmath258 .",
    "letting @xmath259 denote the probability of an event with respect to the measure @xmath44 , we shall show that @xmath260 for some constant @xmath261 .",
    "it then follows that @xmath262 as @xmath252 , as desired .",
    "the measure @xmath44 is the limit of uniform distributions of configurations on the @xmath141 torus @xmath263 , in turn obtainable by choosing a sequence of @xmath264 points from the lebesgue distribution @xmath265 on @xmath266 as the centers of the tiles , orienting each tile independently and uniformly at random , and finally conditioning on no overlap .",
    "we denote by @xmath267 the _ a priori _ probability that exactly @xmath95 points fall inside @xmath249 ( which we take to be some fixed disk in the torus ) .",
    "let @xmath268 be the event that there is no overlap among the tiles whose centers lie in @xmath249 , and @xmath269 the event that there is no overlap involving any tile whose center falls _ outside _ @xmath249 . then @xmath270 and our job is to bound the three fractions on the right .",
    "for the first , we note that @xmath271 is binomially distributed in the measure @xmath265 , hence @xmath272 for large @xmath250 .",
    "the next fraction is easy : since we may throw the first @xmath34 centers into @xmath249 , then the remaining @xmath273 , we have @xmath274 is the probability that the additional @xmath273 centers do not cause a collision , which is at most 1 .    for the ( inverse of ) the third fraction ,",
    "we throw @xmath275 centers into the region outside @xmath249 , then the remaining @xmath273 . a new point ,",
    "if it lands at distance greater than @xmath276 from any previous point or from the disk @xmath249 , causes no new overlap ; and at each stage there are fewer than @xmath277 points already placed .",
    "hence @xmath278 @xmath279 for @xmath280 .    putting the inequalities together",
    ", we have @xmath281 where @xmath282 by choice of @xmath47 .",
    "[ thm : low ] for some @xmath62 , the @xmath44-probability that the origin is inside an infinite connected component of loosely - linked tiles is zero for @xmath283 .",
    "let @xmath284 be a density to be chosen later .",
    "let @xmath71 be a packing drawn from @xmath44 ; we aim to show that the probability that the origin is connected by a loose - linked chain of tiles of @xmath71 to some point at distance @xmath250 approaches zero as @xmath252 .",
    "we again choose some large radius @xmath250 and let @xmath256 be the set of tiles of @xmath71 whose centers fall inside the disk @xmath249 .",
    "fix the positions of the tiles of @xmath285 ( the black tiles of figure  [ fig : chain ] ) and consider the space of packings having these tiles plus @xmath286 tiles whose centers fall in @xmath249 .",
    "we think of this space as being a subset of @xmath287 , where @xmath288 is the unit tangent bundle of @xmath249 ( modulo a @xmath28 rotation to take into account the symmetries of the tile ) and the symmetric group acts by permuting the factors .",
    "if @xmath289 is the volume ( in @xmath287-space ) of this space and @xmath290 , then by packing @xmath291 tiles into @xmath249 and then the remaining @xmath21 in the left - over space , we have @xmath292^m \\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath189 is , as before , the radius of the circle circumscribing a tile .",
    "this takes into account possible intrusion of tiles in @xmath293 into @xmath249 , and the fact that a tile center at point @xmath294 can exclude nearby centers but only within distance @xmath276 of @xmath294 .",

    "if a packing `` percolates '' , that is , contains a chain of loose - linked tiles connecting the center to the boundary of @xmath249 , let @xmath299 be a shortest such chain ( the dark grey tiles of figure  [ fig : chain ] ) . note that @xmath300",
    ". for each @xmath301 , the tile @xmath50 is linked to one of the three sides of @xmath302 farthest from the side of @xmath302 linked to @xmath303 , and has wiggle room at most @xmath296 with respect to @xmath302 .",
    "accounting for the orientation of @xmath65 and allowing the remaining @xmath291 tile centers to fall anywhere in @xmath249 , we have that the @xmath304-dimensional volume of the set of percolating packings is bounded by @xmath305 .",
    "comparing with the lower bound for @xmath289 , we find that given @xmath306 , the probability of percolation is less than @xmath307^m } < \\big(\\frac{27 \\beta d r^2}{\\pi\\big[(r-2s)^2 - 36 d r^2 { s}^2\\big]}\\big)^m /\\beta \\,,\\ ] ] which goes to zero as @xmath250 ( thus also @xmath21 ) increases , for suitably chosen @xmath47 . since we know from lemma  [ lem : poisson ] that @xmath308 approaches 1 as @xmath252 , the proposition follows .",
    "a more careful argument would prove proposition  [ thm : low ] for any density below @xmath309 for sufficiently small @xmath64 , but clearly the probability of percolation will remain 0 for much higher densities than that .",
    "we have shown that high - density random packings of zipper tiles in the plane contain an infinite loose - linked component with positive probability , while low - density random packings do not .",

    "because of homotheties , one may fix the intensity of the point process to be 1 .",
    "then there is a phase transition in @xmath5 .",
