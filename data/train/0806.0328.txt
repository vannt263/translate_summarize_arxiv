    "two photon production of hadronic resonances is one of the clearest ways of revealing their composition , as illustrated in fig .  1 . the nature of the isoscalar scalars seen in @xmath1 scattering below 2 gev , the @xmath2 or @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 , remains an enigma  @xcite .",
    "while models abound in which some are @xmath8 , some @xmath9 , sometimes one is a @xmath10-molecule , and one a glueball , definitive statements are few and far between . since photons couple to neutral hadrons through their charged constituents , as in fig .  1 , their two photon width is a measure of the charge of these  @xcite .",
    "for instance , if the @xmath4 is an @xmath11 state its radiative width is 0.2 kev  @xcite , while if it is a @xmath10-molecule , this is 0.6 kev  @xcite depending on the specifics of the model  @xcite .",
    "can experiment distinguish these possibilities ?     to produce a @xmath12 pair and for these to bind by strong dynamics to form the hadron . ]     from mark  ii  @xcite , cello  @xcite and belle  @xcite . in each case",
    "the cross - section is integrated over @xmath13 .",
    "@xmath14 is the @xmath15 c.m . energy . ]    .",
    "their 1988 data  @xcite are integrated over @xmath16 , while the 1992 data  @xcite ( not shown ) with increased statistics cover @xmath17 . ]",
    "the key features of data on @xmath18 production  @xcite , fig .  2 , are a large enhancement just above threshold , controlled by the one - pion exchange born term , then a small structure ( rather confused in fig .",
    "2 ) near 1  gev associated with the @xmath4 , followed by a clear @xmath19 peak . the @xmath20 cross - section , measured ( and normalised alone ) by crystal ball  @xcite , fig .",
    "3 , is in contrast small from threshold up to 900 mev . at 1  gev",
    ", there is small shoulder and then it is dominated by the @xmath19 signal too .",
    "such dominance reflects the ease with which tensor mesons are formed by two spin-1 photons . but how much of this peak is really pure spin-2 ? data on @xmath15",
    "production cover only 60 - 80% of the angular range , making a complete partial wave separation tricky .",
    "however , as we will recall below , by making the most of the general properties of @xmath21-matrix theory and knowledge of final state hadronic interactions , a determination of the individual spin components becomes feasible .",
    "such a separation of the @xmath18 and @xmath20 results published in the 20th century revealed two classes of solutions  @xcite : one in which the @xmath4 appeared as a _ peak _ with a radiative width of @xmath22 kev , the other the same state appeared as a _ dip _ with a width of @xmath23 kev . with data in c.m .",
    "energy bins of 20 mev , both are possible .    the advent of high luminosity @xmath24 colliders with an intense programme of study of heavy flavour decays has now produced two photon data of unprecedented statistics . the belle collaboration  @xcite have published results on @xmath25 in 5 mev bins above 800 mev . these show a very clear peak for the @xmath4 , fig .",
    "analysis of just their integrated cross - section by belle  @xcite finds its radiative width to be @xmath26 ev .",
    "here we present the results of an amplitude analysis  @xcite of all these data including the angular information  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath1 system can be formed in both @xmath27 and @xmath28 states .",
    "the near threshold cross - section is dominated by the born amplitude , which means that though we expect the @xmath28 @xmath29-channel to have no resonances , it is comparable to the @xmath27 component in all low energy partial waves",
    ". consequently we have to treat the @xmath18 and @xmath20 channels simultaneously .",
    "though there are now more than 2000 datapoints in the charged channel below 1.5 gev , we only have 126 in the neutral channel , and we have to weight them more equally to ensure that the isospin components are reliably separable .    a key role in such an analysis is played by analyticity , unitarity and crossing symmetry . when these are combined with the low energy theorem for compton scattering  @xcite , and constraints from chiral dynamics ,     integrated over @xmath30 . ]",
    "these anchor the partial wave amplitudes close to @xmath1 threshold  @xcite , and help to make up for the limited angular coverage in experiments  @xcite .",
    "moreover , unitarity imposes a connection between the @xmath0 partial wave amplitudes and the behaviour of the hadronic processes with @xmath1 final states . as shown in fig .",
    "5 , the relation involves a sum over all kinematically allowed intermediate states @xmath31 in fig .",
    "gev marks a divide , below the sum is saturated by the @xmath1 intermediate state , while above the @xmath10 channel is critically important . beyond 1.4 - 1.5 gev multipion processes",
    "start to contribute as @xmath32 threshold is passed .",
    "little is known about the @xmath33 channel in each partial wave .",
    "consequently , we restrict attention to the region below 1.44 gev , where @xmath1 and @xmath10 intermediate states dominate .",
    "the hadronic scattering amplitudes , @xmath34 , for @xmath35 and @xmath36 are known  @xcite and so enable the unitarity constraint of fig .  5 to be realised in practice and in turn",
    "allow an amplitude analysis to be performed .    .",
    "]    the @xmath15 partial waves with definite isospin @xmath37 , spin @xmath38 and helicity @xmath39 , @xmath40 , are parametrised in terms of the real functions @xmath41 , where @xmath29 is the square of the c.m .",
    "energy @xmath14 : @xmath42 \\nonumber & & { \\hspace{1.2cm}}{\\alpha_1}^i_{j\\lambda}(s)\\,{{\\cal t}^i_{j}}(s;{\\pi\\pi\\to\\pi\\pi})\\\\[3pt ] & & { \\hspace{1.8cm}}+{\\alpha_2}^i_{j\\lambda}(s)\\,{{\\cal t}^i_{j}}(s;{{\\overline k}k\\to\\pi\\pi})\\ , .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the functions @xmath43 represent the coupling to each hadronic intermediate state with the appropriate quantum numbers .",
    "these couplings , having no right hand cut , are parametrised as smooth functions of @xmath29 , and these form the basis for this energy - dependent amplitude analysis . with data in 5  mev intervals from belle , such continuity is sensible . for simplicity , we will denote the partial waves @xmath44 by @xmath45 .    [ cols=\"<,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      + these widths are determined from the pole residues using eq .  2 . see ref .",
    "@xcite for the details .",
    "the world data can be fitted adequately by a range of solutions  @xcite : a range , in which there is a significant ambiguity in the relative amount of helicity zero amplitudes between @xmath21 and @xmath46 waves , particularly above 900 mev .",
    "this is a consequence of the data covering only 60 - 80% of the angular range , and hence such waves are not orthogonal to each other in the integrated cross - sections .",
    "nevertheless , there is a favoured solution , which is the one we illustrate here .",
    "others are described in the analysis paper  @xcite .    in figs .  3 and 4 ,",
    "we show how this favoured solution describes the integrated cross - section on @xmath47 from crystal ball , and on @xmath25 from belle .",
    "the resulting amplitude has @xmath27 partial wave cross - sections shown in fig .  6 for the dominant waves , @xmath21 , @xmath46 and @xmath48 ( _ i.e . @xmath45",
    "near threshold their contributions are those of the born term , modified by largely calculable final state interactions  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath21-wave shows a clear @xmath4 signal and then a broad enhancement     partial wave components , @xmath45 , to the full integrated cross - sections for the favoured solution . ]",
    "that might be identified with the @xmath5 . above 900 mev",
    ", the @xmath49 wave is dominated by the @xmath19 , which is produced mainly in the helicity two state , expected for a tensor @xmath8 meson  @xcite .",
    "in fig .  7 , we show the argand plot of the favoured @xmath50 amplitude , with its clear @xmath4 loop . by continuing these amplitudes to the resonance pole position on the appropriate unphysical sheet , we determine the two photon coupling of the @xmath4 and for the @xmath49-wave the @xmath19 .",
    "these pole residues are the only process - independent definition of their couplings , @xmath51 .",
    "these give a measure of their radiative widths through the commonly used formula :      where @xmath53 is the fine structure constant .",
    "this gives the values listed in table 1 . as described in ref .",
    "@xcite , the full range of acceptable solutions gives a radiative width for the @xmath4 from 100 to 540 ev , with 415 ev favoured .",
    "this range allows @xmath11 , @xmath10 and @xmath54 compositions to be possible  @xcite .",
    "the favoured solution accords with none of these specific alternatives .     @xmath27 @xmath21-wave amplitude .",
    "the labels mark the energy every 0.1 gev , with smaller dots every 25 mev .",
    "the amplitude moves quickly between 950 and 1000 mev because of the @xmath4 , with kinks  at the two @xmath10 thresholds . ]",
    "achasov and shestakov  @xcite have analysed the belle integrated cross - sections in terms of amplitudes in which key resonances have both direct and meson loop contributions , and they find @xmath55 kev , which supports their model of the @xmath4 as a @xmath9 state .    here",
    "we have presented the amplitude favoured by world data on both integrated and differential cross - sections for both charged and neutral pion production . as discussed in more detail in ref .",
    "@xcite , this is one of a range of amplitudes that provide an acceptable description of current experiments .",
    "the forthcoming @xmath47 data from belle  @xcite should have the power to reduce this range considerably .",
    "once these are finalised the inclusion of these data in an amplitude analysis will hopefully lead to a consistent set of two photon widths for the low mass isoscalar states .    for the @xmath2 or @xmath3 in table 1",
    ", we have little new to add  @xcite since the belle data only start at 800 mev , figs .  2,4 , and so the analysis relies on older data  @xcite  see ref .",
    "@xcite for the discussion . to reduce still further the uncertainty in its @xmath15 width",
    "requires precision charged and neutral pion data between threshold and 700  mev  @xcite .",
    "the introduction of appropriate taggers in an upgraded da@xmath56ne machine at frascati  @xcite may well make this feasible .",
    "two photon couplings are a key window on the detailed structure of low mass scalar states .",
    "such couplings are likely to be just as critical in determining the nature of the scalar field(s ) that break electroweak symmetry .",
    "perhaps this / these scalar(s ) that await discovery in the @xmath57 tev region will be just as complex in their structure as those at @xmath57 gev , making the present study of the states of qcd an important guide .          n.  n.  achasov , s.  a.  devyanin and g.  n.  shestakov , z.  phys .",
