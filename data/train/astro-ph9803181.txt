    "the generally accepted distance modulus to the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) is @xmath4mag ( for recent discussion see westerlund 1997 , madore & freedman 1998 ) . however , there is a long standing @xmath5mag discrepancy between the `` long '' distance determined using cepheids ( e.g. laney & stobie 1994 ) and the `` short '' distance determined using rr lyr stars ( e.g. walker 1992 , layden et al .",
    "a similar discrepancy is present in the distance to the lmc derived with the supernova sn1987a ( @xmath6mag , gould & uza 1998 ; @xmath7mag , panagia et al .  1997 ) .",
    "recently udalski et al .  (",
    "1998 ) used red clump stars observed in the lmc by the ogle 2 project ( udalski et al .",
    "1997 ) and obtained a value of @xmath8mag ( statistical plus systematic error ) .",
    "this distance modulus is @xmath2mag smaller than the `` long '' distance modulus used , for example , by the _ hst _ extragalactic distance scale key project team ( e.g.  rawson et al .",
    "1997 and references therein ) . because errors in the distance to the lmc can propagate into errors in such key quantities as distances , luminosities , masses , and sizes of extragalactic objects , it is important to check the result of udalski et al .",
    "( 1998 ) using independent data , in order to investigate possible systematic errors .",
    "red clump stars are the metal rich equivalent of the better known horizontal branch stars , and theoretical models predict that their absolute luminosity only weakly depends on their age and chemical composition ( seidel , demarque , & weinberg 1987 ; castellani , chieffi , & straniero 1992 ; jimenez , flynn , & kotoneva 1998 ) . indeed , the absolute magnitude - color diagram from _ hipparcos _ data ( perryman et al .",

    "we describe the data used in this paper and select low extinction regions for further analysis . in section 3",
    "we analyze the red clump distribution in the lmc and derive the distance to this galaxy . in section 4 we discuss the possible reasons for the discrepancy with the cepheid distance to the lmc and how it can be resolved .",
    "zaritsky , harris & thompson ( 1997 ) have undertaken a large scale @xmath11 photometric ccd survey of the magellanic clouds , with the ultimate goal of imaging the central @xmath12 of the lmc and @xmath13 of the smc .",
    "the initial results for a @xmath14 region were presented by zaritsky et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , and the extinction map for the same region was constructed by harris , zaritsky & thompson ( 1997 ) .",
    "the area of the lmc observed by zaritsky et al .",
    "( 1997 ) is shown in figure  [ fig : lmc ] , along with the four fields used by udalski et al .",
    "( 1998 ) to determine the red clump distance to the lmc .    as noted by udalski et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , uncertainties in the extinction estimates are the largest contributor to their systematic error .",
    "we therefore select low reddening regions from the area observed by zaritsky et al .",
    "harris et al .",
    "( 1997 ) used @xmath15 ob main sequence stars to construct a map of the reddening in the region observed by zaritsky et al .",
    "they find a mean reddening of @xmath16mag , with a non - gaussian tail to high values . as discussed by harris et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , it is possible that the reddening map is biased to high reddening values , since it is based on the reddening toward ob stars , a population that may reside in dustier - than - average regions of the ism . on the other hand , the nature of their interpolation may partially counter this bias by smoothing over reddening spikes .",
    "recently schlegel , finkbeiner & davis ( 1998 ; hereafter : sfd ) published a new all - sky reddening map , based on the cobe / dirbe and iras / issa maps . with its high spatial accuracy , the sfd map might be potentially useful for selecting low - reddening regions in the magellanic clouds . however , as discussed by sfd , the lmc , smc and m31 are not removed from their map , nor are sources within their holmberg radius .",
    "the reddening estimates from the sfd map are unreliable within these objects because of the lack of spatial temperature resolution from dirbe and confusion with internal ir sources . however , because neither of these two effects artificially creates large areas of low redenning in the map , the map can be used as a guide to select regions of low total extinction .",
    "if the total column density of dust is low , then the dispersion of reddening values of a population distributed along the line - of - sight will also be low .",
    "we therefore decided to select regions of low dirbe / iras reddening from the area observed by zaritsky et al .",
    "( 1997 ) and then determine the reddening using the map of harris et al .",
    "( 1997 ) .    examining the sfd map in the region observed by zaritsky et al .",
    "( 1997 ) we selected two circular regions with @xmath17 radii ( defined by the low extinction region ) , which we hereafter call a1 and a2 .",
    "these regions are centered on ( ra , dec)@xmath18 and ( ra , dec)@xmath19 , respectively , and are shown as small circles in figure  [ fig : lmc ] .",
    "the sfd map gives an average reddening of @xmath20mag for each of these regions .",
    "the harris et al .",
    "( 1997 ) map gives @xmath21 for the region a1 and @xmath22 for the region a2 .",
    "we find the good agreement between the maps reassuring .",
    "however , we assume a conservative error of the @xmath23 reddening to be @xmath24mag , following the discussion by harris et al .",
    "this leads to the values of the extinction @xmath25mag and reddening @xmath26mag for the region a1 and @xmath27mag and @xmath28mag for the region a2 .    in figure",
    "[ fig : cmd ] we show the red clump dominated parts of the @xmath29 color - magnitude diagrams ( cmds ) for both regions a1 and a2 , corrected for the extinction and the reddening using the above values of @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "the dashed rectangle corresponds to the region of the cmd selected for comparison with the local red clump stars observed by _",
    "( see the next section ) .",
    "the lmc red clump is clearly bluer than the local one ( paczyski & stanek 1998 , their figure  2 ) , indicating a lower average metallicity of the lmc ( see jimenez et al .",
    "1998 , their figure  5 ) . however , there is a sufficient overlap with the _ hipparcos _ color range to allow for meaningful comparison , which we perform in the next section .",
    "following paczyski & stanek ( 1998 ) , we selected the red clump stars in the color range @xmath32 and the magnitude range @xmath33 in the a1 region ( 1725 stars ) and in the a2 region ( 1273 stars ) .",
    "the color range was selected to correspond to the color range of the red clump stars observed locally by the _ hipparcos _ ( paczyski & stanek 1998 , their figure  2 ) .",
    "following garnavich & stanek ( 1998 ) , we fitted both distributions with a function @xmath34.\\ ] ] the first three terms describe a fit to the `` background '' distribution of the red giant stars , and the gaussian term represents a fit to the red clump itself .",
    "@xmath35 corresponds to the peak magnitude of the red clump population .",
    "we obtained the values of @xmath36 for the a1 region and @xmath37 for the a2 region .",
    "the distribution of the lmc red clump stars as a function of their @xmath38 magnitude is shown in figure  [ fig : dist ] along with the fitting function described by the eq.1 .",
    "the gaussian fitted to the a1 field red clump distribution has a smaller dispersion , @xmath39mag , than the gaussian fitted to the a2 red clump , @xmath40mag .",
    "the red clump is less pronounced , and has a correspondingly larger dispersion , in the a2 field because the red clump is bluer and mostly falls outside the color cut .",
    "indeed , when we select the red clump stars within the color range @xmath41 , both fitted distributions have the same @xmath42mag .",
    "this different color selection also moves the red clump peaks @xmath35 to slightly fainter magnitudes , @xmath43 for the a1 region ( 1907 stars ) and @xmath44 ( 2497 stars ) for the a2 region .",
    "this slight color dependence in the @xmath9-band magnitudes of the red clump stars is consistent with the results of paczyski & stanek ( 1998 ) , stanek & garnavich ( 1998 ) & udalski et al .",
    "( 1998 ) .",
    "we now proceed to obtain the lmc distance modulus using the red clump , by assuming that the absolute @xmath9-band brightness of the red clump stars is the same for the local stars observed by _",
    "hipparcos _ and those in the lmc .",
    "the straight average of the red clump peak apparent magnitudes @xmath35 for the two regions is @xmath45 and the weighted mean is @xmath46 . combining @xmath47 with the distribution of local red clump stars , which have @xmath48 ( stanek & garnavich 1998 )",
    ", we obtain the distance modulus for the lmc , @xmath49mag , or @xmath50 ( statistical error only ) . after adding the systematic error of @xmath51mag due to the uncertainty in the @xmath30 determination , and @xmath24mag due to the zero - point uncertainty in the @xmath9-band photometry ( zaritsky et al .",
    "1997 ) , we arrive at the final value of @xmath52mag ( statistical plus systematic error ) .",
    "this is indistinguishable from the value of @xmath53mag determined by udalski et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , but @xmath2mag below generally accepted value of @xmath54mag ( madore & freedman 1998 ) .",
    "we discuss possible reasons for this discrepancy and how it can be resolved in the next section .",
    "as with all distance - ladder techniques , our analysis includes the assumption that the calibrating and target objects being compared are intrinsically similar . in our red clump analysis , this assumption is manifested by the assertion that the @xmath9-band brightness of red clump stars is independent of the age , chemical composition , and mass differences that may exist between the red clump stars near the sun and those in the lmc .",
    "indeed , the lmc red clump is systematically bluer than the local one , indicating the somewhat different properties of these stars .",
    "however , paczyski & stanek ( 1998 ) , stanek & garnavich ( 1998 ) and udalski et al .",
    "( 1998 ) found that the @xmath9-band peak magnitude of the red clump depends very weakly on their @xmath55 color in the range @xmath56 , and therefore is independent of the metallicity ( jimenez et al .",
    "this is confirmed in this paper as well , by comparing the peak brightness of the red clump for two color ranges @xmath57 and @xmath58 ( see the previous section ) .",
    "the fact that the observed red clump distributions are so narrow ( @xmath59mag ) indicates that the age dependence of the red clump @xmath9-band peak luminosity is also small ( @xmath60mag ) . otherwise , in a system with a complex star formation history , such as the lmc ( holtzman et al .",
    "1997 ; geha et al .  1998 ) , the resulting red clump should have considerable width .",
    "stanek & garnavich ( 1998 ) compared three different lines - of - sight that probe a large range of m31 galactocentric distances and locations , and hence a range of metallicities and possibly ages and star formation histories .",
    "the fact that the derived distance moduli for their three fields varied by only @xmath61mag indicates that the red clump is a potentially stable standard candle .",
    "the mostly empirical support for using the red clump stars as a distance indicator should also be verified using modern theory of the stellar structure and evolution . in particular ,",
    "@xmath9-band predictions are seldom given by such theoretical calculations .",
    "so why does the red clump distance to the lmc disagree with the cepheid distance ( madore & freedman 1998 ) ? as usual , there are several possible answers .",
    "contrary to our arguments given above , there might still be something `` unusual '' about the red clump population in the lmc .",
    "although the red clump and cepheid distances to the lmc are discrepant , the distances to m31 derived from the two methods are in excellent agreement ( @xmath62 from stanek & garnavich  1998 and 24.44@xmath63 from freedman & madore  1990 ) .",
    "another possibility is that the cepheid distance to the lmc is simply poorly determined , as there are few cepheids with well determined parallaxes in the _ hipparcos _ catalog . in their recent study , madore & freedman ( 1998 )",
    "find @xmath64mag , from a sample of 19 cepheids observed by _ hipparcos _ with good @xmath65 data , and @xmath66mag , from a sample of only 7 cepheids with good @xmath67 data .",
    "yet a third possibility , as discussed by madore & freedman ( 1998 ) , is that there are other effects on the cepheid pl relation ( e.g. extinction , metallicity , and statistical errors ) , which are as significant as any reassessment of the zero point based on _",
    "hipparcos_. the metallicity effect on the cepheid pl relation , determined by kennicutt et al .",
    "( 1998 ) ( @xmath68 = -0.24 \\pm 0.16 $ ] ) , reduces the discrepancy between the red clump and cepheid distances to the lmc by @xmath69mag , while the somewhat larger metallicity dependence found by sasselov et al .",
    "( 1997 ) and kochanek ( 1997 ) reduces it by @xmath70mag . to illustrate the effect of the assumed reddening on the derived distance modulus",
    ", we note that the value of the lmc distance modulus , @xmath71mag , derived recently by salaris & cassisi ( 1998 ) and based on the @xmath72-band brightness of the rr lyr stars , becomes @xmath73mag if their assumed reddening of @xmath74mag is increased to @xmath75mag , corresponding to the mean reddening found by harris et al .",
    "it is disturbing that the distance to a key calibrator of the entire distance scale is uncertain by up to 20% .    as described by udalski et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , the @xmath2mag discrepancy between their ( and now our as well ) `` short '' distance to the lmc and the `` long '' distance to the lmc from the cepheids can be resolved by using detached eclipsing binaries as a direct distance indicator ( paczyski 1997 ) .",
    "the cepheids in the lmc can also be used to get a direct distance estimate through a modified baade - wesselink method ( e.g. krockenberger 1996 ; krockenberger , sasselov , & noyes 1997 ) .",
    "both these methods require no intermediate steps in the distance ladder , therefore avoiding the propagation of errors usually crippling the distance scale . with the 6.58 meter telescopes now being built in the southern hemisphere",
    "the necessary spectroscopy of the detached eclipsing binaries and cepheids can be quite easily obtained for these 1418 magnitude stars .",
    "it is worth mentioning here that the effort to obtain direct distances with the detached eclipsing binaries and cepheids to the m31 and m33 galaxies is already under way and the first results look promising ( project direct : kaluzny et al .",
    "1998 , stanek et al .",
    "1998 , krockenberger et al .",
    "1998 , sasselov et al .  1998 ) .    to summarize , among the various stellar distance indicators the red clump giants might be the best for determining the distance to the lmc and other nearby galaxies because there are so many red clump stars . in particular , _",
    "hipparcos _ provided accurate distance determinations for almost 2,000 such stars , but unfortunately @xmath9-band photometry is available for only @xmath76 of them , so it is important to obtain @xmath9-band photometry for all _ hipparcos _ red clump giants .",
    "we also need to test the metallicity dependence of _ hipparcos _ red clump giant absolute luminosities and colors .",
    "there are many stars within @xmath77 of the sun for which very high - resolution spectroscopy is possible ."
