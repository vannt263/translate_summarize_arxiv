    "one choice , familiar in nuclear and particle physics applications @xcite , are the 15 @xmath10 matrices of @xmath11 .",
    "this set is suitable for examining @xmath6 and @xmath4 sub - algebras involving 8 and 3 operators , respectively , but for our interest in this paper , an alternative representation proves more convenient .",
    "this starts from two qubits and employs their individual pauli matrices , 6 in number , along with tensor products , 9 in number : @xmath12 . together with the unit @xmath13 matrix ,",
    "these 16 matrices called @xmath14 are explicitly tabulated in an earlier paper @xcite .",
    "( a slightly different arrangement of the same operators , called @xmath15 , with much useful group - theoretic discussion , is in @xcite ) .",
    "they have the advantage for the unitary integration procedure ( to be described below ) that the square of each is , to within a factor , the unit matrix .",
    "exponentiation of these operators is thereby rendered simple , involving just two terms .",
    "table i gives the commutators @xmath16 $ ] and is useful for picking out sub - algebras .",
    "for example , @xmath17=io_6 $ ] .",
    "the four states in this representation may be described either in the four - state language as the column vectors @xmath18 , or in spin notation as latexmath:[$|\\uparrow \\uparrow   \\rangle , |\\uparrow \\downarrow \\rangle , |\\downarrow \\uparrow \\rangle ,      there is a large set of six - dimensional sub - algebras formed out of two triplets obeying @xmath4 or , equivalently , @xmath20 angular momentum commutation relations .",
    "one such set , @xmath21 , is the trivial @xmath22 subalgebra of local operations on two qubits @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "there are many equivalent sets generated by a similarity transformation ( st ) acting on the elements of a subalgebra by right - left multiplication by an arbitrary element of the full @xmath2 group .",
    "let @xmath25 be a unitary @xmath13 matrix , and @xmath26 an @xmath11 algebra element .",
    "then , st acts as @xmath27 in this section we will use only a discrete subgroup of all possible st transformations , which have the property that the set of 15 operators @xmath14 is transformed into the same set @xmath28 , i.e. the action of st is equivalent to a permutation among the @xmath14 . in this case",
    "the @xmath22 subalgebras , obtained by st transformation of @xmath29 can be identified by direct analysis of subgroup structures using table 1 .",
    "subgroups different from the trivial @xmath30 one can be generated only by two - qubit entangling operations , such as transformation to the bell basis ( or magic bell basis @xcite ) .",
    "one can easily verify that the set @xmath31 is such a subalgebra .",
    "that is , the operator sets @xmath32 and @xmath33 are two mutually commuting triplets with @xmath4 commutation relations . the st transformation with the unitary matrix @xmath34 passes from the @xmath23 set to @xmath35 and from @xmath24 to @xmath36 . the basis corresponding to eq .",
    "( [ eqn1 ] ) is the bell basis , @xmath37 , which are simultaneous eigenstates of @xmath38 and @xmath39 @xcite .",
    "all such subalgebras are maximal @xmath22 sub - algebras of @xmath11 , in the sense that , if any operator from table i is added to the six already chosen , the algebra closes ( as a lie algebra ) only in the full @xmath11 algebra .",
    "another perspective on the above bell basis is provided by considering a four - level system with nearest neighbor couplings as in the hamiltonian ,    @xmath40    such a matrix may be viewed as built up of three symmetric @xmath13 matrices @xmath41 , with unit entries in row ( column ) @xmath42 and column(row ) @xmath43 and zero everywhere else , so that @xmath44 . starting with these three real , symmetric matrices ,",
    "we define two non - zero commutators between them , @xmath45 , m_{24}=-i[m_{23},m_{34}]$ ] to give two imaginary , anti - symmetric matrices , and a final real symmetric @xmath46 $ ] to complete a full 6-dimensional @xmath47 algebra . using the well - known relation between @xmath48 and @xmath9 groups",
    ", this sub - algebra decomposes into two sets of mutually commuting triplets , @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "these linear combinations correspond to the subalgebra @xmath51 of the full @xmath11 algebra .",
    "such a construction generalizes to @xmath52-level systems , @xmath53 , with nearest neighbor couplings .",
    "the matrices @xmath41 defined as    @xmath54,\\ ] ] provide @xmath55 generators of a @xmath56 algebra .",
    "these form a sub - algebra of the @xmath57-dimensional @xmath58 algebra although , for @xmath53 , the @xmath56 no longer reduces to a product of @xmath4 algebras .",
    "a class of maximal seven - dimensional sub - algebras of @xmath11 , different from the one considered in the previous subsection , can be constructed by taking linear combinations of @xmath60 generators .",
    "inspection of table i shows that the first seven elements form a diagonal sub - block closed under commutation , isomorphic to a @xmath47 algebra . with @xmath61 commuting with all the rest of this sub - block , the other six divide into two mutually commuting @xmath4 triplets upon forming appropriate linear combinations which pass from a standard @xmath13 antisymmetric real - matrix representation of @xmath47 to @xmath22 matrix ( @xmath13 ) form .",
    "another such example , previously considered by one of us @xcite , is provided by @xmath62 , with @xmath63 commuting with all of them .",
    "the linear combinations , defined in @xcite as  pseudo - spins \" , obey @xmath4 commutation relations while not being isomorphic to pauli spinors .",
    "while the pauli matrices constitute a matrix algebra with the unit operator as the identity element , the pseudo - spin matrix algebra has as its identity element the operator @xmath64 .",
    "one implication is that this particular type of @xmath22 algebra is not related by a st operation to the @xmath22 algebras considered in the previous section .",
    "these @xmath65 sets arise , for example , in the physical context of nuclear magnetic resonance @xcite with scalar coupling and heteronuclear two - spin coherences . for applications in methods such as unitary integration which require closure under commutation ,",
    "such pseudo - spins work equally well as we will see below .",
    "there are many such sub - algebras which can be obtained by the discrete subgroup of st operations as discussed in the previous section . for example",
    ", one can simply relabel @xmath66 .",
    "indeed , each row ( or column ) of table i has seven zero entries .",
    "the corresponding seven operators constitute such an algebra for a total of 15 sets @xcite .",
    "the recent demonstration of two qubit gates formed out of josephson junctions @xcite considers the hamiltonian ,    @xmath67    expressing in terms of the @xmath14 matrices in table i , this hamiltonian is a linear combination of @xmath68 . together with @xmath69 , they form a closed sub - algebra , and the operator @xmath70 commutes with all of them . for applications below in section 2 , we record the hamiltonian in terms of the pauli spinors ,    @xmath71    and    @xmath72    where we have defined @xmath73 , and    @xmath74    the sets @xmath75 and @xmath76 mutually commute and each obeys the commutation relations of an @xmath4 algebra but , as in @xcite , they are not completely isomorphic to the @xmath13 matrix @xmath77 or @xmath78 algebras , as discussed above .",
    "in particular , as is easily seen , the squares of @xmath79 and @xmath80 are not the unit operator but involve @xmath38 as well . while sharing the same commutation relations as the similar pseudo - spins defined in @xcite , the sets here differ as @xmath13 matrices , being in the  @xmath26-representation \" instead of the counterpart  @xmath81-representation \" in @xcite .",
    "time - dependent quantum problems can be conveniently handled through the unitary integration procedure of @xcite .",
    "solutions of the schrdinger equation for the quantum state are obtained through the evolution operator @xmath82 defined by        @xmath84 + \\frac{1}{2}i\\!\\sum_{k}\\left ( [ l_k\\rho , l_k^{\\dagger } ] + [ l_k,\\rho l_k^{\\dagger } ] \\right )   \\nonumber \\\\    & \\!\\!= \\!\\ ! & [ h,\\rho ] \\!-",

    "this remains true if more than one @xmath4 is involved so long as they are mutually commuting , each set involving one riccati equation .",
    "note also that since only commutators of @xmath96 are involved in the derivation , the results apply also to pseudo - spins as in the previous section , or for other algebras such as @xmath20 or @xmath98 differing only in the sign or value of the structure coefficients which do not change the form of the defining equations for the @xmath99 .     two - qubit josephson junction system .",
