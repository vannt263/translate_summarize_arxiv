    "even before nasa s dawn mission arrived at vesta , it was known to have an interesting cratering history .",
    "hubble space telescope images revealed a large central - peak crater near its south pole estimated to be 460 km in diameter and 13 km deep , comparable in diameter to vesta itself @xcite .",
    "vesta had long been suggested as the parent body of the he d ( howardite , eucrite and diogenite ) meteorites on the basis of spectral and geochemical evidence @xcite .",
    "its location in the inner asteroid belt between the 3:1 mean - motion resonance with jupiter and the @xmath0 secular resonance with saturn is favorable for delivering material to near - earth space @xcite , and there is a dynamical family of related bodies ( often called ` vestoids ' ) in the vicinity of vesta , stretching toward those resonances @xcite .",
    "the detection of the large south pole crater quite literally provided the ` smoking gun ' evidence linking vesta to the vestoids and heds .",
    "studies of the he d meteorites showed that vesta formed and differentiated early in solar system history ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for a review ) , such that its surface should provide a record of some of the earliest times in solar system history .",
    "thus , there were many reasons for the selection of vesta as one of the targets of the dawn mission @xcite .",
    "more detailed observations once dawn arrived at vesta revealed that there were in fact two overlapping large impact basins in the southern hemisphere , the larger and younger one known from the hst imaging now named rheasilvia , and the older one named veneneia @xcite .",
    "vesta showed a strong dichotomy between north and south , with the north being heavily cratered and the south showing relatively few craters @xcite .",
    "initial crater counts of the rheasilvia and veneneia basins placed their ages at approximately 1 ga for rheasilvia , and at least 2 ga for veneneia , with the uncertainty in the latter being due to the fact that it was somewhat disrupted during the formation of rheasilvia @xcite .",
    "the formation of these two large basins erased nearly all pre - existing craters in the southern hemisphere , but apparently left the northern hemisphere relatively undisturbed .",
    "rheasilvia has sharply - defined features such as ridged terrain on the crater floor and a prominent rim scarp @xcite , suggestive of a relatively young age .",
    "additional evidence for the relatively recent formation of rheasilvia comes from the vesta asteroid family , the ` vestoids , ' that are dynamically related to vesta and were likely ejected in a large cratering event .",
    "the size distribution of these bodies is quite steep compared to the background population ( eg . * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and @xcite showed that the family would have to be less than about 1 ga old , otherwise its size distribution would collisionally grind down and not remain as steep as observed . finally , the gamma ray and neutron detector ( grand ) on dawn detected hydrogen on the surface of vesta , which is interpreted to be exogenic , and found a much lower abundance of hydrogen within the perimeter of the rheasilvia basin compared to the rest of the surface , suggesting that rheasilvia formed and reset the surface relatively recently @xcite .",
    "broadly , the sum of this evidence points to an ancient surface that has been modified over time by craters , including several large and relatively recent ones , such that vesta s surface units span a wide range of ages . while relative crater densities can be used to place these different units in a stratigraphic sequence",
    ", one would always like to be able to determine absolute ages . in practice",
    ", however , this is not always a straightforward process . @xcite and @xcite used estimates of the impact rate in the current main belt to estimate the ages of rheasilvia and veneneia , which can work reasonably well for surfaces dating back to about 3 ga or so , as the impact rate in the main belt was likely fairly constant over that time period ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for a recent review of main - belt dynamical and collisional history ) .",
    "prior to that , however , the impact rate was likely higher , such that there is no longer a linear relationship between age and crater density ( this relation is generally termed a ` chronology function ' or ` chronology curve ' ) . furthermore , as we discuss in sec .",
    "[ sec_bg ] , the degree to which the impact rate has changed over time has been a matter of debate .",
    "here we present a chronology based on the current understanding of main - belt dynamical history , which we then constrain using the record of the largest impacts on vesta .",

    "we present these curves in a normalized form , such that they can be used with different estimates of the crater production function .",
    "our estimate of the crater production function is then discussed in sec .",

    "the lunar cratering record is the most well - studied in the solar system , and benefits from the availability of radiometrically dated samples from some surfaces that have been studied with crater counts . despite this ` ground truth ' , however , there remains some ambiguity .",
    "radiometric dating of samples of lunar impact melts ( eg . * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) showed an unexpected clustering of ages around 3.9 ga and absence of earlier ages , which ran counter to the prevailing idea that the impacts on the moon and terrestrial planets were due the dynamically - decaying remnants of planet formation .",
    "@xcite coined the term ` terminal lunar cataclysm ' for this spike in impact activity , occurring @xmath1600 ma after the formation of the moon ( it is also widely referred to as the late heavy bombardment , or lhb ) .",
    "later studies of melts in lunar meteorites ( eg . * ? ? ?",
    "* ) showed a similar clustering of impact ages around 3.9 ga , although the distribution was more broad than that inferred from the apollo samples .",
    "@xcite suggested that the apparent lack of impact melt ages prior to 3.9 ga may be due to what he termed the ` stone - wall ' , in which there was a smoothly declining cratering rate , but prior to @xmath13.9 ga it was so intense that no surface rocks were able to escape resetting .",
    "while this can not be strictly true , given that many older lunar rocks exist that did not experience any impact melting , more complicated processes might have occurred in which , for example , there is a selection effect towards older impact melt rocks being more deeply buried and younger ones more likely to be found on the surface @xcite .",
    "further modeling is necessary to fully understand regolith evolution and the types of selection effects it can introduce .",
    "combining crater counts with known radiometric ages can shed some light on the problem , although it is dependent to some degree on how well we can measure the crater production populations and how well we actually know the age of the surfaces .",
    "for example , the age of the nectaris basin , a key marker in the lunar chronology system , is placed at @xmath14.1 ga by some groups and @xmath13.9 ga by others , depending on how the distribution of ages in apollo 16 samples is interpreted .",
    "assuming that the age of nectaris is represented by the 4.1 ga age signature in the apollo 16 samples , @xcite , ( also * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) proposed that the impact rate was relatively constant back to @xmath13.5 ga , and exponentially increased back to the formation of the moon at 4.5 ga ( however , as that analysis is only based on samples dating back to 4.1 ga , it does not provide a solid constraint on what happened before 4.1 ga ) . on the other hand , if the age of nectaris is assumed to be represented by the 3.9 ga signature in the apollo 16 samples , the exponential decay would be much steeper and can not be extrapolated back to 4.5 ga without the moon accreting more than a lunar mass of material @xcite .",
    "this argues that the decay could not have been monotonic , and some sort of impact cataclysm must have occurred .",
    "the latest work suggests that none of the available samples actually originate from nectaris , making direct dating of that basin impossible @xcite .",
    "@xcite find that the 4.1 - 4.2 ga ages seen in the apollo 16 samples may actually be from the serenitatis basin , with serenitatis ejecta thrown to the apollo 16 site by the imbrium impact",
    ". the serenitatis basin may be only slightly older than nectaris ( eg . * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , however , so the work of @xcite is consistent with a @xmath14.1 ga age for nectaris .    while it s fair to say that the evidence for or against the declining flux and impact cataclysm models from cratering records and dated lunar samples is still not conclusive ( see , eg .",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* for a discussion ) , other lines of evidence can provide additional constraints .",
    "for example , @xcite discuss the constraints from highly siderophile element abundances in lunar rocks ( eg . * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "they use those constraints to infer a total impacting mass of @xmath2 kg on the moon since its formation , whereas the total impacting mass implied by extending the @xcite , @xcite and @xcite bombardment history back to 4.5 ga is roughly four times larger .",
    "@xcite modeled the dynamical and collisional evolution of possible long - lived dynamical reservoirs in the inner solar system to determine if a decaying population of planetesimals could remain massive enough and decay slowly enough to match the number of basins that formed on the moon between @xmath13.8 and 4.1 ga .",
    "they found that , especially when collisional grinding was considered , there was no population capable of surviving long enough to explain the formation of those basins .",
    "both of these studies point to the need for a delayed bombardment , regardless of whether the actual age of nectaris is 3.9 or 4.1 ga .    various mechanisms have been proposed to explain how a delayed increase in the impact flux could occur , such as the late formation of neptune @xcite , the destabilization of a fifth terrestrial planet that originally existed between mars and the asteroid belt @xcite , or the breakup of a vesta - sized body in the mars - crossing population @xcite .",
    "the leading scenario is generally called the _ nice model _ as all of the authors were working in nice , france when it was developed @xcite . in this model , jupiter and",
    "saturn formed interior to a mutual mean - motion resonance ( mmr , initially proposed to be the 2:1 resonance but more likely even closer together inside their 3:2 resonance ) .",
    "the scattering of remnant planetesimals in a disk beyond the giant planets caused jupiter and saturn to slowly diverge until they crossed the resonance , triggering an instability that among other things destabilized the asteroid belt , cleared out most of the remnant planetesimals , and caused the giant planets to rapidly migrate to their current orbital configuration .",
    "in the original simulations , @xcite found that the migration of jupiter and saturn across their mutual 2:1 mmr would cause resonances to sweep through the asteroid belt , sending those asteroids onto potentially earth - crossing orbits and depleting the mass of the belt by a factor of 10 - 20 .",
    "the impact rate on the moon would spike fairly sharply , consistent with the lunar cataclysm scenario suggested by @xcite .",
    "however , more detailed work with a wider range of simulations found that the best match to a range of solar system constraints was obtained when jupiter has an encounter with one of the ice giants ( uranus or neptune ) immediately following the resonance crossing , causing a much more rapid migration than would be obtained simply by planetesimal scattering @xcite .",
    "this was termed the ` jumping jupiter ' scenario .",
    "@xcite also found that a very short timescale of jupiter s migration was necessary in order to match constraints from the asteroid belt , consistent with that scenario .",
    "@xcite showed that unlike in the original simulations of @xcite where the asteroid belt was depleted by a factor of 10 - 20 , the depletion factor in the jumping jupiter case was only about 2 .",
    "@xcite showed that there may be an additional factor of @xmath12 depletion due to the longer term chaotic diffusion of unstable asteroids following jupiter s migration , but that still means that the mass of the asteroid belt prior to jupiter s migration was only about 4x its current mass , and could not provide sufficient impactors to explain all of the large basins on the moon , especially the oldest ones .",
    "an extension of this scenario was proposed by @xcite , who suggested that the primordial asteroid belt extended inwards to roughly 1.8 au ( compared to roughly 2.1 au now ) .",
    "this innermost part of the primordial asteroid belt was termed the `` e - belt , '' and would have been stable prior to the giant planet migration in the nice model , since the @xmath0 secular resonance that currently defines the inner edge of the asteroid belt would have been located beyond the asteroid belt when jupiter and saturn were closer together , interior to their mutual 3:2 mmr .",
    "when the 3:2 mmr was crossed and the nice model instability occurred , the @xmath0 would have swept through the belt to its current location , making the e - belt unstable .",
    "bodies from that population would be sent on earth / moon - crossing orbits and have a relatively high collision probability with the earth and moon , compared to bodies derived from further out in the asteroid belt .",
    "furthermore , the impacting population would experience a relatively slow decay with time , rather than the sharp spike in impacts produced in the early nice model simulations .",
    "@xcite found that the impacts from e - belt bodies would create roughly 10 lunar basins between 3.7 and 4.1 ga , broadly consistent with the number of basins in the @xcite , @xcite and @xcite chronology since @xmath14.1 ga ( with nectaris likely being the first or one of the first basins formed by the destabilization of the e - belt ) .",
    "the e - belt impacts would not be enough to explain all of the large basins on the moon , however , as several times as many basins formed prior to nectaris than after it .",
    "@xcite showed that the best fit to the lunar cratering record is from a combination of a declining impact flux due to leftover planetesimals from terrestrial planet accretion , which would have formed the pre - nectarian basins , combined with an increased flux starting around 4.1 ga due to jupiter s migration and the destabilization of the asteroid belt and e - belt that would have formed the more recent basins .",
    "@xcite find that the crater size - frequency distribution ( sfd ) on and near the nectaris basin is different from that on pre - nectarian terrains , suggesting a transition in the impactor population around that time . while there could be multiple interpretations of the nature of the transition",
    ", they show that it is consistent with a change in velocity of the impactors as the more highly - excited e - belt population begins to dominate over the primordial impacting population around the time of nectaris formation .",
    "it is important to note that while there have been many historical disagreements about the interpretation of the lunar cratering record , this hybrid model of @xcite is essentially consistent with the lunar chronology proposed by @xcite , @xcite and @xcite back to @xmath14.1 ga ( ie .  back to the earliest time for which we have samples that can potentially be associated with a specific areas of the lunar surface ) .",
    "the primary uncertainties lie in what happened before that time .",
    "such a hybrid scenario was alluded to earlier by @xcite , although never explicitly modeled .",
    "it is common practice to scale the crater production rate from one planet to another in the inner solar system using estimates of the orbital distribution of impactors ( namely the near - earth asteroids , neas ) and scaling laws for crater production ( eg . * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . while this approach is not without its difficulties and uncertainties , it is generally reasonable given that the different planets are all targets being hit by a single source population , the neas .",
    "the same approach can not necessarily be applied to scale the early lunar crater production rate to the asteroid belt , however . the dynamical history that delivers the impactors from the main belt to the terrestrial planet region",
    "may imply a much different collisional history for bodies in the asteroid belt compared to the moon and terrestrial planets .",
    "a simple example is that if the asteroid belt was suddenly reduced in mass by a factor of 2 at @xmath14 ga , with the asteroids being delivered to the terrestrial planet region , the impact rate in the asteroid belt would merely drop by a factor of 2 , while bodies in the terrestrial planet region would experience a significant spike in their impact rate .",
    "another important factor is that the nea size distribution may differ from that of the main belt , because the neas are derived from the main belt in part by the action of size - dependent forces , namely the yarkovsky effect ( see , eg .",
    "* for a thorough review ) .",
    "in fact , @xcite and @xcite find that there are two different crater sfds on the moon , one for older highland terrains , and a steeper sfd for younger maria terrains .",
    "the implication is that impactors hitting the older terrains have a sfd that closely matches the main belt , and were derived from it by a size - independent process ( such as the effects of nice - model resonance sweeping on the belt ) , while the younger surfaces are cratered primarily by neas , which have a steeper sfd than the main belt due to the action of the yarkovsky effect .",
    "thus , the impactor sfd inferred from small craters on the moon , which are primarily counted on younger surfaces , is not necessarily the same as the impactor sfd in the asteroid belt itself .",
    "in addition , neas are delivered primarily through resonances in the inner asteroid belt , but vesta can be hit by central - belt and many outer - belt bodies as well , and all of those regions have somewhat different size distributions ( eg . * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .    instead , we must look at the dynamical history of the asteroid belt itself and use that to determine the impact rate vs.  time . as described in sec .",
    "[ sec_bg_sub1 ] , the asteroid belt since @xmath14.1 ga likely experienced a factor of @xmath14 depletion due to the combined effects of the resonance sweeping during the nice model instability @xcite and the subsequent decay of unstable asteroids @xcite . the e - belt ,",
    "while it dominated the impacts on the terrestrial planets , would have only been a relatively small fraction of the mass in the primordial belt .",
    "prior to @xmath14.1 ga , rather than increasing back in time , the mass of the asteroid belt may have remained relatively constant at @xmath14 times the current mass going back several hundred million years .    at the earliest times , immediately following the formation of the solar system , the asteroid belt may have had significantly more mass than it currently does @xcite , which would have been depleted over the first @xmath1100 ma and led to an increased impact rate in the belt during that time .",
    "another possible contributor to the early impact rate in the asteroid belt could be leftover scattered planetesimals from the terrestrial planet region , although the effect of such bodies on the asteroid belt has not been fully quantified .",
    "regardless of the source of these earliest impactors , it is likely that there was a somewhat larger impact rate in the asteroid belt immediately following the formation of the solar system , which would have decayed to @xmath14 times the current rate and stayed at that level until @xmath14.1 ga , then decayed to its current rate following the destabilization of the asteroid belt and e - belt .",
    "this depletion at @xmath14.1 ga would correspond to the beginning of the late heavy bombardment on the moon .",
    "there are two additional sources of impactors that we do not consider here .",
    "the giant planet migration and resulting depletion of the asteroid belt and e - belt around @xmath14.1 is driven by the scattering a massive primordial trans - neptunian disk of planetesimals , some of which will cross the inner solar system ( eg * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . however , there is not strong evidence for a significant cometary component to the impact flux in the inner solar system .",
    "the sfd of ancient craters surfaces on the moon , for example , is consistent with being derived entirely from main belt impactors @xcite . because highly siderophile elements ( hses , like the platinum - group elements ) in the lunar crust would have been heavily depleted during its differentiation , current abundances of those elements are likely due to subsequent impacts .",
    "abundances of hses in the lunar crust show no signature of primitive , carbonaceous chondritic material like ci or cm chondrite ( taken to be good proxies for cometary material ) , suggesting that comets did not play a major role in the lunar bombardment ( eg . * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "similar results are obtained from studies of actual projectile fragments in regolith breccias from the apollo 16 site @xcite .",
    "the lack of evidence for cometary impactors could be due to disintegration of comets once they reach into the inner solar system ( eg .",
    "* ) , or perhaps the primordial trans - neptunian disk was somewhat less massive ( eg . * ? ? ?",
    "* ) than initially envisioned in @xcite .",
    "@xcite model the formation and evolution of asteroid families under the influence of an lhb - era cometary bombardment , and find that comets could potentially lead to a significant impact flux , although to explain the number of observed families it is likely that 80% of comets are disrupted due to close approaches to the sun before they are able to impact the asteroids .",
    "hence , we ignore for now the possibility of cometary impactors on vesta , although this should be revisited in the future pending better constraints on the impact flux .",
    "it has also been proposed that the formation of jupiter may have scattered planetesimals through the asteroid belt region and caused a ` jovian early bombardment ' @xcite .",
    "the actual bombardment rate in that model can be quite large , potentially intense enough to erode vesta s surface , but varies significantly based on chosen initial conditions .",
    "all of the impacts in that model would have occurred very early , and vesta may have taken at least several million years to differentiate and form its crust ( see * ? ? ? * for a review ) , so it is not clear that those impacts would actually be recorded on its surface as seen today .",
    "hence we do not include it in the model presented here , but note that scattered planetesimals during jupiter s formation may be an additional impactor population to include in future analysis , provided it can be better constrained .",

    "it may seem strange that the largest crater on vesta would be so young , where we define young here as forming in the last @xmath13 ga , during which time the impact rate is roughly the same as the current rate .",
    "we find that while it may be a low - probability event , it is still plausible given the impact history implied by the model chronology . assuming that one rheasilvia - sized basin formed over the lifetime of vesta , the probability that it formed in the last 3 ga is roughly estimated as @xmath74 = 0.134 , or 13.4% , assuming the nominal model chronology parameters .    as described in sec .",

    "if the depletion occurred through a different process ( eg .  the ` grand tack ' of @xcite ) , the depletion would have been faster , and the resulting primordial impacting mass @xmath31 in our model would have to be correspondingly higher . while all of these are reasonable assumptions to make , given the uncertainties involved , it does mean that the chronology presented here should not be taken as the final word for calculating ages on vesta s surface , and should certainly not be used to calculate 3-significant - figure ages as is common in the crater counting literature .",
    "rather , we provide a general framework for vestan chronology that can be refined as further constraints may become available , and which can be used to provide reasonable age estimates in the context of our current understanding of solar system evolution .",
    "because of the uncertainties involved , we stress that in presenting crater counts for vesta , the age should not be the only piece of information given .",
    "rather , since any absolute age calculation is model - dependent , a quantitative measure of the crater density ( such as the number of craters larger than a certain size ) should be given , as well as any other relevant information such as the assumed impacting population , so that the reader can do their own comparison between the results of different groups who may be making different assumptions .",

    "the dynamical history that delivers the impactors from the main belt to the nea population may imply significantly different collisional histories for bodies in the asteroid belt compared to the moon and terrestrial planets .",
