    "recent experimental observations of two hadrons correlations in the relative azimuthal angle @xmath0 and in the pseudorapidity separation @xmath1 in high - multiplicity proton - proton ( p+p ) @xcite and proton(deuteron)-nucleus ( p+a ) @xcite collisions , show a great deal of similarity to that measured in semi peripheral nucleus - nucleus collisions @xcite .",
    "in particular , the discovery of the so - called ridge phenomenon , namely the near - side ( @xmath2 ) di - hadron correlations which extend to a large pseudorapidity separation @xmath3 , in high - multiplicity events selection in both p+p and p(d)+a collisions at the lhc and rhic @xcite , triggered an on - going debate about the underlying dynamics of high - multiplicity events . a similar ridge - type structure has also been observed in heavy - ion collisions at rhic and the lhc and is understood as a phenomenon related to hydrodynamical behavior of the quark - gluon - plasma , see e.g refs.@xcite .",
    "the hydrodynamic approach , based on the final - state interaction provides good description @xcite of the high multiplicity p+p data as well .",
    "nevertheless , no compelling argument has yet been given that a small system like the one produced in p+p collisions , an order of magnitude smaller than heavy - ion collisions , should exhibit a hydro type behavior .",
    "on the other hand , the initial - state color - glass - condensate ( cgc ) approach , the effective field theory of low - x partons in the hadronic or nuclear wavefunctions , also provides a qualitatively good description of the same data @xcite .",
    "it is thus fair to say that the true physical origin of the ridge in p+p and p+a collisions is still unknown , see also refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the mechanism of prompt di - photon ( photons produced in hard scatterings , not from hadron decay ) production @xcite in the cgc / saturation framework is quite different than that of di - hadron production @xcite . in the cgc picture ,",
    "hadrons are produced in two stages : first soft gluons ( or gluon mini - jets ) are put on - shell from the projectile wave function by directly scattering on a saturated target , and subsequently gluon mini - jets decay to hadrons via a final - state hadronization process .",
    "the first stage is theoretically under control while the last stage of hadronization can be only treated phenomenologically in the small - x framework using the gluon fragmentation functions @xcite .",
    "in contrast to gluons , prompt photons do not scatter on the target gluon field , but rather decohere from the projectile wavefunction due to scattering of the quarks .",
    "moreover , prompt photons are free from the final - state hadronization processes , and possible initial state - final state interference effects .",
    "therefore , prompt photons can be a powerful probe of initial - state effects , and in particular the prompt di - photon correlations can provide vital information about the intrinsic correlations of partons in the hadronic and nuclear wavefunctions .",
    "such measurments can also shed light on the origin of the observed ridge phenomenon in di - hadron production and help us understand whether it is the initial or final state effects that play dominant role in formation of the ridge collimation in p+p and p+a collisions .",
    "note also that unlike description of di - hadron correlations @xcite which requires the knowledge of correlators of a higher number of wilson lines , the di - photon production cross section ( at least in leading order in @xmath4 ) depends only on the dipole amplitude @xcite , which is the best understood observable in terms of the high energy evolution .",
    "therefore , within the cgc framework , the theoretical understanding of observables necessary to describe di - photon production is more robust compared to di - hadron production .    the main aim of this paper is to investigate prompt di - photon azimuthal angular correlations in p+p and p+a collisions at rhic and the lhc .",
    "we concentrate on relatively forward rapidities and employ the hybrid approximation @xcite within the cgc approach . in ref.@xcite , we calculated di - photon cross - section in the hybrid approximation at the leading - order in the cgc framework employing the soft approximation . since in the cgc approach",
    "the scattered quark does not change its longitudinal momentum while propagating through the target , the soft approximation amounts to the assumption that the transverse momenta of the produced photons are smaller that the typical transverse momentum of exchanges with the target .",
    "although the soft approximation greatly simplifies calculations , it is not applicable in a significant range of interesting kinematics in high - energy collisions . here ,",
    "for the first time , we provide the full calculation of prompt di - photon production in p+a collisions at leading - order in the cgc framework without resorting to any further approximation .",
    "we show that prompt di - photon in high - energy collisions exhibit ridge - type structure in quark - nucleus collisions albeit the physics of these correlations is significantly different than that of hadronic correlations discussed previously in the cgc framework @xcite .",
    "in particular the correlations decrease for moderate rapidity separation between the two photons ( @xmath5 units ) .",
    "we investigate the energy , rapidity , transverse momentum , and density dependence of prompt di - photon correlations and show that the di - photon correlations have many novel features .",
    "we attribute the intrinsic azimuthal collimation ( the ridge ) in prompt di - photon to the double - fragmentation contribution at relatively high transverse momentum while the away - side peak to single fragmentation contribution coming mainly from relatively low transverse momentum .",
    "we also show that the degree of manifestation of these correlations in the final state is strongly influenced by the gluon saturation dynamics .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "ii we introduce the main formalism for calculating the cross - section of inclusive prompt di - photon production in high - energy proton - proton and proton - nucleus collisions in the cgc framework and obtain the cross - section within the hamiltonian light - cone approch at leading - order . in sec .",

    "it is seen that the correlations both in near - side and away - side in p+a collisions at the lhc disappears for approximately @xmath123 .",

    "another interesting features of the correlations at rhic is the emergence of a double - peak structure for away - side correlations at low transverse momentum @xmath131 of photons . at higher",
    "@xmath131 it is replaced by a single peak structure due to the fragmentation contribution .",
    "note that a double - peak structure for the two - particle structure was also reported for the photon - hadron @xcite and dilepton - hadron @xcite correlations in a small windows of kinematics in the cgc approach .",
    "therefore , it seems the existence of a double - peak structure at away - side to be a universal feature of electromagnetic probes . in the present case",
    "we understand its emergence in the following way .",
    "we recall that in order for higher fock components of the projectile hadron wavefunction to be resolved and photons to be radiated , the projectile quark should interact with small - x target by exchanging transverse momentum .",
    "this means that when total momentum transfer @xmath110 is zero , the production rate of di - photon should go to zero and off - shell di - photon remains as a part of projectile hadron wavefunction .",
    "note however because of convolution with parton distribution functions , the local minimum at low @xmath110 will not be zero but gets smeared out . on the other hand ,",
    "the production has a maximum at low @xmath110 due to single fragmentation contribution .",
    "therefore , a double peak structure appears for the away side di - photon correlations as a result of combination of a local minimum and a local maximum for the correlations . at higher transverse momentum ,",
    "the back - to - back fragmentation contribution overwhelms the cross - section and prompt di - photon correlations has a single - peak structure .",
    "note that in the lhc kinematics , the typical momentum transfer to the target is larger than at rhic and the double - peak structure becomes single - peak structure for a wide range of kinematics .",
    "this effect was also seen for the photon - hadron @xcite and dilepton - hadron @xcite correlations at rhic and the lhc .",
    "the systematics of the results can perhaps be understood in the following way .",
    "first , recall that in our approach the photons do not scatter off the hadronic target directly .",
    "the final state di - photons arise from two contributions .",
    "one is the two photon component of the incoming quark state , which is put on shell by virtue of the quark scattering out of the initial state , while the other is the photon(s ) emitted by the `` bare '' outgoing quark while it `` reconstitutes '' the dressed quark wave function , see .",
    "the first contribution is a part of the direct di - photon , while the second is mostly contained in the fragmentation ( single and double fragmentation ) part , see .",
    "there is no physics in the scattering event itself that can generate the same side correlations .",
    "therefore such correlations can only appear due to correlations that exist in the proton wave function or are produced during the ( double ) fragmentation stage .",
    "just like in hadronic case bose enhancement of photons exists in the incoming quark ( proton ) wave function @xcite .",
    "however now this enhancement does not extend over large interval of rapidities but is peaked at @xmath132 .",
    "once the quark scatters out of the initial wave function putting the two photons on shell , the initial state enhancement due to double fragmentation translates directly into the same side correlations in the final state , since the momentum of the two photons is not changed by the scattering . in this sense",
    "the initial state correlations are even more directly reflected in the final state di - photon momentum distribution than in a di - hadron , which does absorb transverse momentum from the target .",
    "this above simple reasoning assumes that one can cleanly separate the final state photons which originate from the two photon initial state .",
    "this is difficult to do in the non - saturation model , the `` no sat '' curves on figs.([f - qa1],[f - qa2 ] , [ f - pa - cut ] ) or when the total transfer momentum to target is very small @xmath127 ( in the non - saturation model ) in figs.([f - qa2],[f - pa - cut ] ) .",
    "the scattering probability @xmath133 is strongly peaked at low momenta . on the other hand ,",
    "if the momentum transfer to the quark is much smaller that the transverse momenta of the observed photons @xmath134 , while propagating through the target the quark changes direction adiabatically , so that no photons with momenta @xmath135 are produced . the production is therefore dominated by the momentum transfer @xmath136 . in this regime",
    "however , there is no clear picture of a well defined contribution of the initial two photon state for two reasons .",
    "first , the factorization scale for fragmentation functions is itself of the order of the momentum transfer @xmath137 and with all momenta being of the same order some of the would be `` initial state di - photons '' are identified as fragmentation photons .",
    "secondly , in this regime there is strong interference between different diagrams in the amplitude , and the separation on the probability level is not possible .",
    "as the saturation momentum is increased @xmath138 or @xmath139 , the maximum of the scattering probability moves to higher transverse momentum transfer @xmath140 . at this point",
    "the simple picture of initial state correlations becomes valid , and one indeed observes the imprint of the initial correlations in the emitted di - photon distribution . eventually , when @xmath113 and therefore typical momentum transfer @xmath131 becomes too large , the quark is kicked out of the proton wave function too violently , so that an ever increasing contribution to the direct di - photon comes from the immediate vicinity of the interaction point rather than from the incoming wave function .",
    "those photons are not correlated , and so the normalized correlation function @xmath81 decreases .",
    "in this paper , we investigated prompt di - photon correlations , and in particular the existence of ridge correlations for di - photon production within the cgc approach in high - energy q+p(a ) and p+p(a ) collisions at rhic and the lhc .",
    "our formulation is only valid for the case of dilute - dense scatterings at forward rapidity .",
    "our main findings are as follows :    a ridge - type structure exists for prompt di - photon production in high - energy quark - nucleus collisions ( even in minimum - bias collisions ) at both the lhc and rhic .",
    "prompt di - photon ridge at near side @xmath141 mainly comes from the double fragmentation di - photon contribution and the effects of bose enhancement in the projectile wave function , while the away side ridge @xmath142 originates from the single fragmentation contribution which is dominated by the usual back - to - back correlations .",
    "the ridge structure at near - side in quark - nucleus collisions disappears for rapidity differences @xmath143 .",
    "additionally it exists only in a limited kinematics windows with small value of the light - cone variable @xmath57 and within the saturation regime , see figs.([f - qa1],[f - qa2 ] ) .    for the case of proton - nucleus collision ,",
    "the near - side correlations are washed away at the lhc 5.02 tev after integration over @xmath57 variable ( or convolution with the pdfs ) while the ridge - like structure survives in p+a collisions at rhic 0.2 tev at rather low transverse momenta of the produced photons even up to @xmath144 , see figs.([f - pa - all],[f - rhic ] ) .",
    "we showed that in principle the ridge - like structure at the lhc can re - appear by imposing a lower cut on the total transfer momentum to the target @xmath104 by isolation cut techniques , see .",
    "the prompt di - photon near side @xmath141 correlations ( the ridge ) strongly depends on the saturation dynamics and the value of typical total transfer momentum to the target ( or @xmath104 ) .",
    "it is absent when @xmath145 , is generated by increasing the saturation scale to @xmath146 or @xmath147 ( at small @xmath57 ) .",
    "this is mainly due to the fact that a larger saturation scale shifts the main contribution of the integrand of the cross - section to higher transverse momentum where the double - fragmentation becomes important leading to enhancement of near - side correlations while it reduces the single fragmentation contribution , consequently unbalancing the back - to - back correlations leading to suppressions of the way - side correlations , see e.g. .",
    "the prompt di - photon correlations at forward rapidities in the away side region exhibit single or double peak structure depending on the kinematics , namely transverse momenta of the produced photons , rapidity interval between two photons and center - of - mass energy .",
    "similar effect was also reported for photon - hadron @xcite and dilepton - hadron @xcite correlations in high - energy p+pb collisions .",
    "although di - hadron ridge was observed in p+p and p(d)+a collisions @xcite both at the lhc and rhic , the di - photon correlations have not yet been measured at the lhc and rhic .",
    "our study here shows that the energy , density and transverse momenta dependence of di - photon correlations both at near side and away side provide essential complementary information to understand the true underlying dynamics of emergence of ridge phenomenon in high - energy collisions .",
    "it was argued that the di - hadron ridge effect can be understood entirely within the framework of the initial - state cgc physics .",
    "there are also competing mechanisms based on the final state effects , like hydrodynamics approach @xcite , which provide excellent description of the same data .",
    "our study here pertains to the minimal bias p - pb data , where one certainly does not expect collective phenomena in the final state to play a crucial role .",
    "therefore observation or non observation of di photon correlations at rhic and the lhc ( see e.g. ) would be an important test for the two approaches .",
    "it is interesting to note that ref.@xcite required both the projectile proton and the target to be in the saturation regime in order to describe the ridge effect in p+pb collisions .",
    "the existence of two saturation scales in the problem ( for the projectile proton and the target ) both in p+p and p+pb collisions , is essential for @xcite in order to find a good fit to the observed number of charged hadron tracks in which the ridge appears .",
    "the origin of such rare high multiplicity events in p+p and p+pb collisions is not yet well understood . in our hybrid approach on the other hand the projectile proton is assumed to be in dilute regime and is consequently treated in standard parton model approach , while the target is treated as a dense object .",
    "therefore , we have here only one saturation scale and our calculation should be applicable to minimal bias events in p+pb collisions and a more significant fraction of p+p events than those exhibiting di - hadron ridge correlations . in this sense",
    "the di - photon correlations is a much cleaner probe of initial state effects compared to di - hadrons , as it does not require modelling of rare fluctuations leading to high multiplicity events .",
    "one of the main results of this paper is that the prompt di - photon near - side collimation and the ridge - type structure can also be probed in quark - nucleus collisions at the lhc at small value of @xmath57 , albeit within a limited rapidity interval .",
    "we recall that strictly speaking our formulation is only valid for dilute - dense scatterings ( such as proton - nucleus and electron - nucleus collisions ) at small - x .",
    "therefore , our general outcome here in particular the di - photon ridge phenomenon in quark - nucleus collisions can be also tested in a future electron - ion collider @xcite .",
