    "the atlas electromagnetic ( em ) calorimeter is a lead / liquid argon sampling calorimeter with accordion shaped electrodes and absorbers interleaved .",
    "the calorimeter is divided in two half barrel cylinders covering the pseudo - rapidity range @xmath4 , housed in a single cryostat and two endcap detector ( covering @xmath5 ) housed in two separate endcap cryostats .",
    "its accordion structure provides complete @xmath6 symmetry without azimuthal cracks .",
    "the total thickness of the calorimeter is greater than 22 radiation lengths ( @xmath7 ) in the barrel and 24@xmath7 in the endcaps .",
    "the em calorimeter is highly segmented with a 3-fold granularity in depth and @xmath8 granularity of @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and @xmath11 , respectively in the front , middle and back compartment .",
    "a pre - sampler with a fine granularity in @xmath12 ( @xmath13 ) is located before the cryostat and the coil , enabling to correct for the corresponding dead material effects .",
    "more details on the atlas detector can be found in  @xcite .",
    "the energy measurement in the calorimeter cells is the starting point of the reconstruction of electrons and photons .",
    "the construction of cell clusters is based on two algorithms , fixed - size window clusters for photons and topological clusters for electrons .",
    "the fixed - size algorithm starts by choosing a seed cell in the middle layer of em calorimeter and then varies the position of a window to maximize the total energy contained in it .",
    "for the topological cluster , cells are chosen as seeds if their energy is above a given threshold . since the material in front and the segmentation of the calorimeter",
    "affect the measured energy and position of em clusters , position and energy corrections are applied at the cluster level .",
    "due to the finite granularity of the detector , the difference between the true and the computed shower barycenter , as a function of the @xmath12 position inside the cell , has a typical s - shape .",
    "the cluster position in @xmath6 is determined from the energy barycenter in the second sampling .",
    "the measurement of @xmath6 is biased by an offset due to the accordion shape and depends on the distance to the folds of the accordion .",
    "the energy of a cluster is obtained by @xmath14 , where @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the energies in the pre - sampler and the three layers of calorimeter .",
    "the offset term @xmath19 corrects for upstream energy loss before pre - sampler .",
    "the parameters @xmath20 , @xmath19 , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 , called longitudinal weights , are calculated by a @xmath23 minimization of @xmath24 using monte carlo single particle samples .",
    "figure  [ figure1 ] shows the resolution as a function of the particle energy for electrons and photons at @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "the fits shown allow the extraction of a sampling term of the order of @xmath27}$ ] and a small constant term  @xcite .",
    "this result is confirmed by the analysis of real test beam data  @xcite .",
    "figure  [ figure2 ] ( a ) shows the reconstructed distribution of the invariant mass of the electrons after calibration , in the @xmath28 decay , with @xmath29 gev . the central value is correct at the @xmath30 level and with a gaussian resolution of @xmath31 .",
    "figure 2 ( b ) shows the reconstructed photon pair invariant mass for @xmath32 decays with @xmath33 gev .",
    "the central value of the reconstructed invariant mass is correct at @xmath34 level and with a gaussian resolution of @xmath35  @xcite .         using the clean and large - statistics sample of @xmath36 , it is possible to evaluate the overall em energy scale of the calorimeter from the data , and to determine precisely the inter calibration between different regions of the calorimeter .",
    "monte carlo - based evaluations , using  87,000 reconstructed @xmath36 events , shows that the long - range constant term can be kept below @xmath37",
    "this gives a global constant term below the design value of @xmath38 .",
    "the `` sliding window '' algorithm is used to find and reconstruct em clusters .",
    "this forms rectangular seed clusters with a fixed size , @xmath39 , positioned to maximize the amount of energy within the cluster .",
    "the combined reconstruction and classification checks whether a track can be matched to the seed cluster . if yes",
    "and the track does not correspond to a conversion , it is classified as an electron , else as a photon .",
    "the cluster is calibrated according to the particle hypothesis ( electron / photon ) with an optimized cluster size .    due to the structure of the atlas tracker , photons which convert within @xmath40 mm of the beam axis",
    "are associated with a track seeded in the silicon volume , while photons which convert further away from the beam pipe are found using tracks seeded in the transition radiation tracker ( trt )  @xcite with or without associated hits in the silicon detector volume  @xcite . to reconstruct converted photon vertices ,",
    "a dedicated vertex finder algorithm is used . combining these tools , a reconstruction efficiency of almost @xmath41",
    "can be achieved for conversions that occur up to a distance of @xmath42 mm from the beam axis  @xcite .",
    "low momentum , so called soft , electrons from @xmath43 and @xmath44 decays are useful to determine in - situ performance of the trigger , offline reconstruction and to calibrate the em calorimeter . for initial luminosities of @xmath45 , a trigger on low energy dielectron pairs ( two level 1 trigger em clusters greater than @xmath46 gev ) and tracking selection in the high level trigger should provide a large sample of soft electrons from direct production of @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "track - seeded offline reconstruction of low energy electrons finds a track in the inner detector and extrapolates it to the middle layer of the em calorimeter and apply energy and position corrections  @xcite to calorimeter em cluster . with an integrated luminosity of @xmath47 ,",
    "a cut based electron identification and using the reconstruction of low - mass electron pairs , approximately two hundred thousand @xmath43 decays could be isolated  @xcite .",
    "in order to separate real electrons and photons from jets , several discriminating variables are constructed by combining the information from the calorimeters and the inner tracking system .",
    "calorimeter information is used to select events containing a high-@xmath48 em shower .",
    "track isolation is used to further reduce remaining fake photons from high-@xmath49 low multiplicity jets .",
    "electron indentification uses more sophisticated track information .",
    "cut - based identification of high @xmath48 electrons ( photons ) is based on many cuts which have been optimized in up to seven ( six ) bins in @xmath12 and up to six ( eight ) bins in @xmath48 .",
    "three levels of selections with increasing purity are available : loose , medium and tight  @xcite .",
    "figure  [ figure3 ] shows the identification efficiency of the loose , medium and tight cuts as a function of @xmath50 .",
    "the efficiencies are compared between single electrons of @xmath51gev and electrons found in simulated supersymmetric events .",
    "as expected , the single electron sample displays higher efficiencies than in supersymmetric events , because of the large hadronic activity in the later type of events .        in the log - likelihood ratio ( llr )",
    "method , the distribution of each of the shower variables is normalized to unity to obtain a probability density function ( pdf ) . once the pdf s are established , the llr value is computed as @xmath52 , where @xmath53 and @xmath54 are pdf s of the @xmath55 shower shape variable for the real electrons / photons and the jets , respectively .",
    "figure  [ figure4 ] ( a ) shows the distribution of llr for photons and jets . the llr cut can be tuned in bins of @xmath12 and @xmath48 to obtain an optimal separation between photons and jets .",
    "the h - matrix method exploits the correlations among transverse and longitudinal shower shape variables to identify electrons and photons .",
    "the resemblance of a candidate to an electron or a photon shower is quantified by @xmath56 , where @xmath57 is the inverse of the covariance matrix @xmath58 of the shower shape variables , and the indices @xmath59 and @xmath60 run from 1 to the total number of variables , namely 10 .",
    "the shape of the distributions of the selected shower shape variables depend on the @xmath12 and energy of the incoming photon or electron .",
    "these effects are taken into account in the construction of the h - matrix using single photon or electron samples of different energies , to parameterize each of the covariance terms in the matrix @xmath58 as a function of photon or electron energy .",
    "the separation power of the h - matrix between real photons and jets is illustrated in figure  [ figure4 ] ( b ) , where the @xmath23 distribution of the h - matrix for the jet samples is compared to that obtained for photons from the @xmath61 decay ."
