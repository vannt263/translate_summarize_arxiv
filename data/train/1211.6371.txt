    "heterointerfaces between metal oxides like srtio@xmath0  ( sto ) , laalo@xmath0  ( lao )  and latio@xmath0  ( lto ) show considerable promise as components in all - oxide electronics because they exhibit unique properties unobserved in the corresponding isolated parent compounds . in their bulk phase , srtio@xmath0  and laalo@xmath0  are non - magnetic wide - bandgap materials , but when assembled into superlattices , interesting properties such as high @xmath2 superconductivity , magnetism , ferroelectricity and colossal magnetoresistance",
    "are observed . despite recent experimental and theoretical activities ,",
    "the field of oxide interfaces remains full of surprises and unsolved problems.@xcite    a number of heterointerface behaviors have been explained using density functional theory ( dft ) , but several authors ( see refs .   and references therein ) have shown that more elaborate methods like dynamical mean field theory@xcite or gw - based approaches@xcite are needed to successfully model interfaces of strongly correlated electronic systems and predict the direction of charge transfer . while many - body techniques in combination with dft methods are sufficient for this task , they remain computationally demanding , particularly when it is necessary to account for the important structural relaxations and phase transitions occurring at interfaces .",
    "theory s predictive power can be enhanced by considering the properties of the two ( or more ) parent materials in the bulk phase , followed by mapping to obtain heterointerface properties.@xcite to successfully model the perovskites considered herein , good band gaps and accurate structural / geometric properties beyond reasonable lattice parameters are required .",
    "for example , the tio@xmath3  rotation and tilt angles are likely responsible for the metal - insulator transition in oxide superlattices@xcite and necessitate accurate theoretical structures .    controlling the octahedral rotations relies on good geometric values of tio@xmath3 and is considered by some to be the key to designing functional metal oxides.@xcite further , the tio@xmath3  rotation and/or tilts affect the electronic properties of both bulk metal oxides and their superlattices . for example , the degeneracy of the @xmath4 states in ( lao)@xmath5/(lto)@xmath6/(lao)@xmath5  superlattices is lifted by the crystal field induced by the tio@xmath3  octahedral rotation in latio@xmath0  layer.@xcite consequently , accurate determination of crystal field splittings ( cfs ) induced by the phase transition in bulk metal oxides is also important to the ti-@xmath7 orbital reconstruction at the heterointerfaces.@xcite    recently , jalan _ _ et al.__@xcite found that stress also exerts a pronounced influence on the electron mobility in sto , with moderate strains resulting in a greater than 300% increased mobilities .",
    "good theoretical estimation of strain in metal oxides is thus recommended and computational methods approaching the experimental strain are preferred .",
    "this is the case for the recent hse06 calculations of janotti _",
    "et al._,@xcite which confirmed the experimental findings and showed that strain in sto affects seriously the electronic effective masses and the conductivity .    a survey of literature ( see ref .   and references therein ) presented in table  [ tab : comparison ] below",
    ", summarizes the main semilocal and hybrid functional trends for bulk srtio@xmath0 , a widely - used substrate for the heterointerface superlattices of interest here .",
    "methods underestimating the band gaps , like the local spin density approximation@xcite ( lsda ) , the generalized gradient approximation functional of perdew , burke and ernzerhof@xcite ( pbe ) , and the pbesol@xcite re - parameterization for solids must be avoided because they lead to an overestimation of the two - dimensional band at the heterointerfaces , and tend to overestimate the octahedral rotation angle in srtio@xmath0 .",
    "in addition , lsda and pbe also fail to describe the antiferromagnetic insulating character in strongly - correlated systems    lllllll [ tab : comparison ] functional & lsda & pbesol & pbe & dft+u & hybrids +   + lattice parameter & too low & good & too big & too low & good +   + band gaps & too small & too small & too small & good & good + &  -40% &  -40% &  -40% & & @xmath86% + tio@xmath3  rotation angle & too big & too big & too big & too big & good + & up to 8@xmath9&5@xmath9&4@xmath9&4 - 5@xmath9 &  1 - 2@xmath9 +    dft@xmath10 methods can open the band gap to the experimental value by empirical tuning of the value of the coulomb on - site ( @xmath11 ) and exchange ( @xmath12 ) interaction parameters , but at the cost of incorporating parameters that are external to theory and are material - dependent . while dft@xmath10 can correctly describe the insulating character of latio@xmath0  in the ground state,@xcite geometric issues like the rotation angle overestimation problems in sto , which originate from the parent functionals lsda and pbe , do not improve by adding the @xmath10 correction . despite these well - known limitations , dft+@xmath11 has been the method of choice for the oxide superlattice calculations , mainly because the corrected gaps approach the experimental band gaps of srtio@xmath0 , laalo@xmath0  and latio@xmath0  bulk phases with a minimal additional cost compared to regular dft calculations , especially for superlattices.@xcite    very important progress has been made in furthering our understanding of metal oxides superlattices using dft+@xmath11 ; however , one value of @xmath11 will not produce the correct band gap for differing bulk metal oxides , which poses a problem for heterostructure systems like lao / sto , lto / sto , lto / lao , etc .    in fact , most dft+@xmath11 calculations assume that the value of @xmath11 appropriate for the substrate is also valid to describe the grown material , as well as the heterointerface,@xcite although in some instances the @xmath11 correction is applied to the bulk only , while the grown material is treated at the regular dft level.@xcite ( even more sophisticated methods use different values of @xmath11 and @xmath12 for the ti-3@xmath13 and la-4@xmath14 states ; see for example ref .  ) .",
    "another problem recently gaining notoriety is the fact that dft+@xmath11 predicts exaggerated octahedral distortions in the fully - relaxed superlattices,@xcite which seriously affects the electronic structure and the properties of the 2-d electron gas at the interfaces .",
    "all of these shortcomings indicate the need for a universally applicable functional to better describe the electronic structure of thin films and their interfaces .",
    "electronic structure calculations on bulk srtio@xmath0  using the global hybrid functionals b3pw,@xcite b3lyp,@xcite and b1-wc@xcite were performed by several groups,@xcite showing improved band gaps compared to semilocal dft .",
    "for example , band gap deviations from experiment were only 6 - 7% with b3pw , while structural properties and order parameters of the antiferrodistortive ( afd ) phase ( see table  [ tab : comparison ] ) were also closer to experiment .",
    "nevertheless , the use of global hybrids in studying heterointerfaces remains limited due to their high computational cost .",
    "screened hybrid density functionals like that of heyd , scuseria , and ernzerhof@xcite ( hse / hse06 ) and the middle - range screened hybrid functional of henderson , izmaylov , scuseria and savin ( hiss)@xcite are excellent candidates for this task due to their accuracy and much lower computational cost compared to regular hybrids.@xcite screened hybrid functionals yield srtio@xmath0  structural properties for both phases@xcite in very good agreement with experiment,@xcite especially if used with large ( but still computationally tractable ) basis sets .",
    "the best results arise from the hse / tzvp combination.@xcite previous calculations on iron  @xcite and transition metal monoxides  @xcite using hse03@xcite indicate that the magnetic moment , exchange splitting and band width in metals are overestimated relative to experiment .",
    "subsequent tests on strongly - correlated magnetic materials have been carried out by rivero _ _ et al.__@xcite using the short - range screened hybrid hse06 and the long - range screened hybrid lc-@xmath15pbe.@xcite they demonstrated that both range - separated hybrids give a good quantitative description of the electronic structure of strongly - correlated systems , with magnetic coupling constants that are larger than experiment , yet improved compared to the results of the global hybrid , b3lyp .    a more recent work form philipps and peralta@xcite involving transition metal molecular complexes suggests that hse06 is a promising alternative for the evaluation of exchange couplings in extended systems , again because of reasonable accuracy at reduced computational expense .",
    "the present paper is a continuation of earlier work@xcite with srtio@xmath0 : herein , we assess the accuracy of hse06 for calculating the crystal field splitting in srtio@xmath0 , the geometries of laalo@xmath0  in its different phases , as well as the structural and magnetic properties of the strongly - correlated system , latio@xmath0 .",
    "all calculations presented in this paper were performed using a development version of the gaussian suite of programs,@xcite with the periodic boundary condition ( pbc)@xcite code used throughout . unless otherwise noted , crystal structures were downloaded as cif files from the icsd.@xcite ( see ref .   for the specific i d numbers . )",
    "the def2-  @xcite series of gaussian basis sets were optimized for use in bulk latio@xmath0  and laalo@xmath0  calculations , following the procedure described in ref .   for bulk srtio@xmath0 .",
    "we use the notation tzvp and szvp to differentiate these optimized pbc basis sets from the molecular def2-tzvp and def2-szvp basis sets .",
    "the functionals applied in this work include the lsda@xcite ( svwn5),@xcite pbe , and hse06 . lsda and",
    "pbe calculations were utilized to assess the quality of the gaussian basis sets via comparison with planewave calculations from the literature .",
    "most numerical settings in gaussian were left at the default values , _",
    "e.g. _ , geometry optimization settings , integral cut - offs , @xmath16-point meshes and scf convergence thresholds . for laalo@xmath0 ,",
    "the reciprocal space integration used a 12@xmath1712@xmath1712 @xmath16-point mesh for the cubic unit cells of 5 atoms , while for the larger rhombohedral supercell of 30 atoms , the default @xmath16-point mesh of 8@xmath178@xmath174 was found to be sufficient . because we performed optimizations of both atomic positions and lattice parameters ,",
    "the scf convergence threshold was set to , or 10@xmath18 atomic units .",
    "the fully relaxed structures can be obtained from the cambridge structural database . ]",
    "due to the metallic nature of latio@xmath0 , a mesh of 24@xmath1724@xmath1718 for the @xmath16-point sampling was required in order to ensure stable convergence.@xcite for the sake of computational efficiency , all calculations on lto were carried out using the szvp basis set .",
    "under ambient conditions , bulk srtio@xmath0  crystallizes in a cubic perovskite structure , subsequently undergoing a second order phase transition at @xmath19=105 k to a tetragonal structure with slightly rotated oxygens around the @xmath20-axis , known as the antiferrodistortive ( afd ) phase .",
    "the phase transition of sto is governed by two order parameters .",
    "the primary order parameter is the rotation angle of the tio@xmath3 octahedra ( @xmath21 ) that can reach up to 2.1  at 4.2  k.@xcite the second order parameter measures the tetragonality of the unit cell , as defined by the ratio of @xmath22 , and can be as large as 1.0009 upon cooling to 10  k.@xcite    the finer details of the conduction band splitting induced by the afd phase transition in sto are still under debate,@xcite with discrepancies between theory and experiment arising from differences in the sample dopant or defect concentrations : the tio@xmath3  rotation angle may be enhanced or reduced depending on the doping conditions and this affects directly the rotation of oxygen atoms in the @xmath23-plane when sto distorts into the afd phase .",
    "we have shown@xcite in modeling an idealized sto ( with no defects , doping , strain or surface effects ) that hse06 provides band gaps and phase transition order parameters in excellent agreement with experiment .",
    "we found a @xmath22=1.0012 corresponding to a + 0.12% tensile strain along the [ 001 ] direction or the @xmath20-axis .",
    "however , we did not address the crystal field splitting ( @xmath1 ) of the conduction band minimum ( cbm ) induced by the phase transition .",
    "as is evident from the enlargement of the region around the calculated cbm at the @xmath24 point the crystal field causes the 3-fold degenerate band to split into a doubly - degenerate band and a single band 3 mev higher in energy .",
    "further discussion arise from figure  [ fig : sto ] by zooming at 10% from brillouin zone center along the high symmetry directions , [ 100 ] ( @xmath25 ) , [ 001 ] ( @xmath26 ) , [ 101 ] ( s ) , [ 110 ] ( @xmath27 ) and [ 111 ] ( @xmath28 ) in the body centered tetragonal brillouin zone . along @xmath25 , @xmath26 , and s ,",
    "we observe a qualitative behavior very similar to that predicted in an earlier augmented plane wave ( apw ) calculation without spin - orbit ( so ) coupling.@xcite however , differences arise along @xmath27 and @xmath28 directions where we observe that the lowest doubly degenerate band splits into a heavy electron ( @xmath29 ) and light electron ( @xmath30 ) bands as we move farther from the @xmath24 point",
    ". the differences might come from the model used in the apw calculation by mattheiss neglecting both the nearest and second - nearest neighbor oxygen - oxygen @xmath31 interactions and the interaction between the oxygen-@xmath32 and the titanium @xmath4 orbitals in the cubic state .",
    "quantitatively , the apw calculations predict @xmath33=20.7 mev which is much greater than the @xmath34 mev we obtain in the present work .",
    "this is also the case for the spin - orbit splitting for cubic sto @xmath35=83 mev , if compared with @xmath36=28 mev computed using the vasp planewave code by janotti et _",
    "al._.@xcite    janotti et _ al .",
    "_ studied with hse06 the effect of @xmath81% strain on the cbm focusing on the splittings and the electron effective masses taking into account the spin - orbit effects .",
    "they also found that the rotation of tio@xmath3  octahedra around the @xmath20-axis without including the tetragonal distortion ( @xmath37 ) lead to a splitting of the doubly degenerate band of 4  mev with minor changes on the effective masses .",
    "going back to our results in figure  [ fig : sto ] , one concludes that the small + 0.12% tensile strain along the [ 001 ] direction arising from the tetragonal distortion might not contribute significantly to the cbm splitting but plays a role on the important differences in the electron effective masses we observe along the high symmetry directions .",
    "for example , the curvature of the cbm is higher ( i.e. lower effective mass or light electrons-_le _ ) along @xmath38 and @xmath25 directions parallel to the strain indicating higher electron mobilities in those directions .",
    "this result is in line with the enhanced electron mobility janotti et _ al .",
    "_ concluded for srtio@xmath0   subject to + 1% tensile strains along the ( 001 ) direction .",
    "however , further investigation is still needed to draw a final conclusion since the electron effective masses and the order of the bands change upon the inclusion of so effects .",
    "@xcite    the combined hse06 results , @xmath39 and @xmath36 show an excellent _ quantitative _ agreement with experimental data obtained from single domain shubnikov - de haas oscillation raman spectroscopy measurements,@xcite namely : @xmath40=2 mev and @xmath41=18 mev .",
    "however , they do not support the picture proposed by the recent angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) experiment of chang _",
    "et al._,@xcite which indicates that the single band is of lower energy , with a doubly - degenerate band 25 mev higher .",
    "this disagreement may arise from the fact that sto samples used in this experiment were doped with oxygen vacancies ( v@xmath42 ) , which are known to introduce a shallow defect level in the band gap of sto.@xcite finally , using hse06 and the tzvp basis set to model sto relaxed in the afd phase , we found that the crystal field splits the cbm at the gamma point by 3 mev , leaving it doubly degenerate in the absence of so coupling .",
    "bulk laalo@xmath0  undergoes a phase transition from the simple cubic structure to a rhombohedral - central hexagonal structure with space group @xmath43 at temperatures below 813  k.@xcite the two order parameters for this phase transition are the tilt of the alo@xmath3 octahedra ( @xmath44 ) , which can reach a maximum value of 5.7at 4.2k,@xcite and @xmath45 , a measure of spontaneous strain , defined as @xmath46 , with values of up to -0.008 .",
    "the calculated lattice parameters relative to experiment for both phases of bulk lao are underestimated with lsda , overestimated with pbe and in - between for hse06 ( table  [ tab : lattice ] ) .",
    "this is well - known behavior for lsda and pbe ( see _ e.g. _ ref",

    "in addition , @xmath48 and @xmath49 ratios compare very well with experiment@xcite an indication that the octahedral distortion is well reproduced .",
    "with pbe , @xmath47 has a positive sign which suggests that the tio@xmath3  octahedra elongate along @xmath50 instead of @xmath51 which qualitatively incorrect .",

    "<S> this large crystal - field splitting associated with the large magnetic moment found in the g - type antiferromagnetic state suggest that latio@xmath0 has an induced orbital order , which is confirmed by the visualisation of the highest occupied orbitals . these results strongly indicate that hse06 is capable of efficiently and accurately modeling perovskite oxides , and promises to efficiently capture the physics at their heterointerfaces . </S>"
