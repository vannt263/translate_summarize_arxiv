    "bubbles blown in the interstellar medium ( ism ) by massive stars are a common astrophysical phenomenon .",
    "x - ray observations can provide information regarding the density , metal abundance , temperature , ionisation state and physical structure in the hot bubbles surrounding wolf - rayet ( wr ) and o stars ( wrigge , wendker & wisotski 1994 ) , luminous blue variables ( lbv s ) such as @xmath2 carinae ( corcoran 1995 ) and planetary nebulae ( pn ) ( kreysing 1992 ; leahy , zhang & kwok 1994 ; arnaud , borkowski & harrington 1996 ; leahy 1996 ) . on the larger scale ,",
    "superbubbles are created by the sum of the winds and sn within ob associations ( belloni & mereghetti 1994 ) and giant star forming regions in young starburst galaxies .",
    "superbubbles within starburst galaxies such as m82 eventually break out the galaxy to form spectacular galactic winds ( watson , stanger & griffiths 1984 ; heckman , armus & miley 1987 ) . in many cases the x - ray emission probes different regions of the object in question to that revealed by optical observations , increasing the importance of the x - ray data .",
    "analytic solutions to the development and structure of astrophysical bubbles must rely on simplifying assumptions , and increasingly attention has turned to the use of numerical hydrodynamics .",
    "these simulations have been enlightening with respect to the nonlinear processes occurring , with some degree of quantitative agreement with observation , but generally lack predictive power .",
    "this is partially due to the difficulty in comparing them with observations , in particular x - ray observations .",
    "the problem is that x - ray observations are usually analysed by fitting a single or two temperature spectral model to the observed spectra ( see for example the references above ) , and the best - fit results are used to infer the physical properties of the object .",
    "however , for wind - blown bubbles such as those mentioned above , the true situation is more complex , and the results of the spectral fits may be influenced by , for example : projection of different physical regions along the line of sight ; the presence of a wide range of temperatures ; interstellar absorption ; unknown or non - standard elemental abundances ; non - ionisation equilibrium conditions ; low numbers of observed photons and the limitations of the current x - ray telescope optics and detectors .",
    "all of these make the interpretation of what is normally a one or two temperature spectral fit to the data difficult to relate to the underlying physical conditions , and conversely , make it difficult to predict the _ observable _ properties of a model or simulation .    to our knowledge",
    "there has been no study of the influence of the complexities mentioned above on the best - fit properties of a spectral fit to the observable x - ray data , and in particular not for wind blown bubbles .",
    "as we shall show , the combination of the physical effects above and the properties ( and limitations ) of real x - ray observatories , can significantly affect the results of simple spectral fitting .",
    "previous authors ( weaver 1977 ; zhekov & perinotto 1996 ) have calculated theoretical x - ray spectra from their 1-d models , but did not consider particular instruments or fit models to those spectra . in general only x - ray luminosities are calculated ( volk & kwok 1985 ; mellema & frank 1995 ; garcia - segura & mac low 1995 ) .    the aim of this paper is to introduce a method of analysing numerical simulations in the same way as actual x - ray observations are analysed , predict the _ observable _ x - ray properties .",
    "this method can be applied to a wide range of phenomenon where x - rays are important , from wind - blown bubbles around wr stars and pn , through the larger bubbles around clusters of massive stars to starburst - driven galactic winds .",
    "we simulate a wind blown bubble using a 2-dimensional hydrodynamic code , concentrating on the properties of the hot x - ray emitting gas .",
    "the hydrodynamic model is used to generate artificial x - ray spectra and images , in particular simulated _ rosat _ spectra .",
    "we then analyse these spectra in the same way as real _ rosat _ spectra would be , in order to determine what the observationally determined properties of the bubble would be , and how those relate to its actual structure .",
    "this synthesis is necessary to a ) determine the physical processes that are observationally important , and b ) _ allow a direct comparison between observation and theory_.    our model of a wind - blown bubble is deliberately chosen to be the simplest applicable model with an analytic solution , in order to simplify the analysis of our results , and avoiding added complications that a more physically accurate model of a wind blown bubble ( garca - segura , mac low & langer 1996 ) would introduce into the interpretation of our results .",
    "later papers will consider more realistic models , with additional physics such as time varying energy and mass injection rates , along with spatial variation of the x - ray properties .",
    "this will be necessary to understand the properties of the extended emission from galactic winds ( see for example strickland , stevens and ponman 1997 ) .    in section  [ sec : num_method ]",
    "we describe the numerical code used to produce the results shown in section  [ sec : results ] .",
    "section  [ sec : disc ] discusses the implications of these results , and we briefly sum up in section  [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "the 2-d numerical simulations presented in this paper were performed using virginia hydrodynamics-1 ( vh-1 ) , written by john blondin and co - workers ( blondin 1990 ) .",
    "vh-1 is based on the piecewise parabolic method ( ppm ) of colella & woodward ( 1984 ) , which is a third order accurate finite difference algorithm . for a more detailed description of the code see stevens , blondin & pollock ( 1992 ) .",
    "radiative cooling is handled assuming optically thin gas with solar abundance ratios and ionisation equilibrium .",
    "the cooling curve for the temperature range @xmath3 was generated using the raymond - smith plasma code ( raymond & smith 1977 ) , assuming solar element abundances . because cooling times at @xmath4 are short , we place a limit of the numerical timestep to prevent more than a @xmath5 energy loss per computational cell per timestep . for @xmath6 the cooling is set to zero .",
    "for the simulations described below vh-1 was run in cylindrical coordinates ( @xmath7 , @xmath8 ) , assuming symmetry around the @xmath8-axis . in practice",
    "this gives rise to numerical artifacts along the coordinate axes , but these are small and do not affect our results .",
    "the computational grid consisted of @xmath9 cells of equal size , spanning a physical distance of @xmath10 .",
    "as a simple realistic model of a wind - blown bubble we consider the analytical model of castor , mccray & weaver ( 1975 ) and weaver ( 1977 ) .",
    "a wind of constant terminal velocity @xmath11 and mechanical luminosity @xmath12 ( where @xmath13 is the mass loss rate of the star ) blows into a medium of uniform density @xmath14 .",
    "this generates a bubble with a structure divided into three distinct regions : an outer shock , separating the undisturbed ambient ism from a shell of swept up and shocked ism ; a bubble of hot shocked stellar wind material , bounded at its outer edge by a contact discontinuity between it an the shell of shocked ism , and at its inner edge by a reverse shock between it and the third innermost region of the freely expanding stellar wind .",
    "after several thousand years the shell of swept up ism cools and collapses down to form denser , cold ( @xmath15 ) shell , which is the source of the the optical emission associated with the nebula .    in the standard weaver ( 1977 )",
    "model thermal conduction leads to evaporation of matter off the dense shell of swept - up ism into the hot bubble interior , cooling it and significantly increasing its density .",
    "in common with many of the hydrodynamical simulations of bubbles we do not include conduction .",
    "magnetic fields may suppress conduction , even at very low b - field strengths that otherwise are dynamically unimportant ( soker 1994 ; band & liang 1988 ) . given the limited observational knowledge on the state of magnetic fields and conduction within bubbles we choose to ignore both !",
    "we shall consider two simulations , both with @xmath16 . to obtain different temperatures in the hot bubble we vary the wind mass loss rate between simulations .",
    "the low mass loss rate simulation has @xmath17 . in the high mass loss rate simulation @xmath18 , giving a bubble of half the temperature of the low mass loss rate simulation .",
    "mass and energy are added to cells within @xmath19 at each timestep .",
    "the ambient medium is assumed to be uniform and totally ionised , with a total number density of @xmath20 .",
    ".model parameters for the two bubble simulations [ cols= \" < , < \" , ]      the true properties of the bubble in the high mass loss rate simulation are practically identical to those of the low mass loss rate bubble .",
    "the only differences are that the density and temperature in the shocked wind are a factor of two different .",
    "the intrinsic x - ray luminosity in the @xmath21-@xmath22 band is 3% higher , but most importantly the _ rosat _ count rate is double that of the low mass rate simulation .",
    "the intrinsic luminosity is again dominated by the cool , dense material near that shocked wind / cold shell interface , whose properties are almost identical between the two simulations .",
    "the count rate depends on both the intrinsic spectrum and the detector s spectral response . in this case",
    "the cooler bubble interior brings the emission from the shocked wind more within the _ rosat _ spectral response , giving more high energy photons in the pspc spectra , and hence making them seem harder .",
    "this explains the higher best - fit temperatures of this cooler bubble , compared to the low mass loss rate simulation .",
    "this is further evidence , if needed , that it is necessary to predict the _",
    "observable _ properties of a model when comparing observation with theoretical models .",
    "fitted absorption columns can vary wildly in a case with a complex spectrum , biasing estimated emission measures are luminosities .",
    "it might be safer not to fit for the column , and use estimates from optical or measurements .",
    "the metallicity in single temperature models is badly underestimated .",
    "given the current debate over x - ray determined abundances ( bauer & bregman 1996 ) , where much of the attention has concentrated on the hot plasma codes rather than the effect of multi - temperature gas , this is a very interesting result . is this a peculiarity of this particular model , or a general property ? does this also affect higher spectral resolution instruments such as _ asca _ or the future _ xmm _ ?",
    "as single temperature fits fail to represent to true emitted spectrum they generally underestimate the thermal energy in the bubble , as this is primarily in hot , tenuous gas with much lower emissivity than the cool gas .",
    "we note that this could provide an explanation for the apparent discrepancy reported by magnier ( 1996 ) between the thermal energy in the superbubble n44 as derived from _",
    "rosat _ and _ asca _ spectral fits , where the x - ray derived thermal energy is a factor @xmath23-@xmath24 lower than expected on the basis of the weaver model .",
    "however , we have not demonstrated that our results apply over such a wide range of parameter space , and the alternative explanation that the stellar wind energy input may have been overestimated may well be true .",
    "we are continuing this work to specifically model superbubbles in future papers .    nevertheless , it is safe to say that the results of simple spectral fits to what are in reality more complex sources depend strongly on both the spectral response of the detector and the spectral distribution of the source .",
    "we have not included several physical effects that are potentially important in real stellar wind blown bubbles : thermal conduction , magnetic fields , time - dependent ionisation , non - solar abundance ratios , mass loading and interaction with the winds from the main sequence and red giant stages of the star .",
    "mass and energy were injected onto the computational grid in a manner more suitable for superbubbles around ob associations and in starburst galaxies . for the spectral fitting , we have ignored the soft x - ray background .",
    "these omissions do not invalidate or reduce the significance of the results contained in this paper .",
    "our aim is to illustrate the need for modeling the x - ray emission , and analysing in as similar a manner to real observations as possible . in this introductory paper",
    "we have avoided the potential complications that additional physics would introduce into the interpretation of the results , and take the known properties from relatively simple model , calculate what would be seen in a real observatory such as _ rosat _ , and ask `` can we infer the true properties from the x - ray emission resulting from those properties ? '' relaxing the above assumptions only make the need for this method of direct comparison more urgent .",
    "we intend to extend this work , relaxing the assumptions of constant mass and energy injection , and a homogeneous ism , to model the properties of superbubbles and galactic winds in starburst galaxies . as a general method and philosophy it can , of course ,",
    "be applied to a wider range of astrophysical bubbles .",
    "in future we shall consider the spatial variation of the x - ray properties , as done for example for the _ rosat _ observation of m82 s galactic wind by strickland , ponman & stevens ( 1997 ) .",
    "we shall also extend this work to other x - ray observatories such as _ asca _ or _ xmm _ , to make use of the superior spectral resolution of these instruments .",
    "for the higher signal - to - noise spectra that _ xmm _ will make available , this method of direct comparison will be absolutely necessary !",
    "we have shown that in order to compare x - ray observations to theory , it is necessary to consider the _",
    "observable _ x - ray properties of the theory .",
    "the results of a spectral fit are a complex function of the the density and temperature distributions of the source , absorption , the properties of the detector used and the spectral fitting procedure . as such they should not be considered as `` real '' values , but as characteristic values , and specific to the instrument used . the normal method of fitting a simplistic model to the observed data , and then treating the best - fit parameters as the real properties can easily give answers an order of magnitude out from the truth .",
    "this technique will allow the first direct comparison between observation and theoretical models of superbubbles and starburst driven outflows .",
