    "ngc  7793 is a reasonably face - on galaxy ( @xmath553.7@xmath6 ) , of type sd(s ) ( iv ) ( sandage & tammann @xcite ) , and is one of the five well - known galaxies making up the nearby sculptor galaxy group .",
    "it has a very thin bulge and a filamentary spiral structure , though this spiral pattern is almost lost within the numerous regions of hii  emission and star formation . though estimates of its distance vary , ranging from 2.5 ( de vaucouleurs et al.@xcite ) to 3.4mpc ( carignan @xcite ) , recent efforts have concentrated towards the high end of this range , and we here adopt a distance of 3.38mpc , in agreement with several other authors ( blair & long @xcite ; carignan & puche @xcite ; puche & carignan @xcite ) . at this distance ,",
    "1  corresponds to just under a kiloparsec ( 0.98kpc ) .",
    "it is an intrinsically small and dim system , with an exponential scale length @xmath7 , and an absolute @xmath8 magnitude @xmath9 .",
    "this absolute magnitude corresponds to a total blue luminosity of @xmath10 ( carignan & puche @xcite ) .",
    "as far as previous x - ray observations of ngc  7793 go , ngc  7793 was observed with the _ einstein _",
    "ipc for almost 2ks in 1979 ( fabbiano et al .",
    "very little was gleaned from these observations apart from the fact that the ` x - ray centroid does not coincide with the nucleus ' .",
    "these observations are described more fully throughout this paper .",
    "the _ rosat_x - ray telescope ( xrt ) however , with the position sensitive proportional counter ( pspc ) ( pfeffermann et al .",
    "@xcite ) at its focal plane , offers three very important improvements over previous x - ray imaging instruments ( such as the _ einstein _  ipc ) .",
    "firstly , the spatial resolution is very much improved , the 90% enclosed energy radius at 1kev being @xmath11 ( hasinger et al.@xcite ) .",
    "secondly , the pspc s spectral resolution is very much better ( @xmath12 fwhm at 1kev ) than earlier x - ray imaging instruments , allowing the derivation of characteristic source and diffuse emission temperatures .",
    "lastly , the pspc internal background is very low ( @xmath13ct s@xmath2 arcmin@xmath14 ; snowden et al.@xcite ) , thus allowing the mapping of low surface brightness emission source populations ( see trmper ( @xcite ) for a description of the _ rosat _  satellite and instruments ) .    here",
    "we report the results of a 23.8ks _ rosat _  pspc observation of the field surrounding ngc  7793 .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows .",
    "sect.[sec_obs_data ] describes the observation and the preliminary data reduction methods used , sect.[sec_disc_sources ] discusses the results as regards the point source emission , and sect.[sec_disc_unres ] discusses the results as regards the remaining unresolved emission .",
    "sect.[sec_disc_n7793 ] discusses the x - ray properties of ngc  7793 , with regard both to its membership of the sculptor group and to how it compares to spiral galaxies in general .",
    "finally a summary is presented in sect.[sec_summary ] .",
    "the field surrounding ngc  7793 was observed with the _ rosat _  pspc in essentially two separate observations ( on december 7th 1992 , and between may 20th-27th 1993 ) for a total of 23.8ks . towards the end of the december 1992 observation , a modest increase ( by a factor of @xmath151.5 ) in the count rate is observed .",
    "investigating further , one sees that this extra emission pervades the entire field of view , and is merely an enhancement in the background over the whole detector .",
    "this background enhancement , which merely decreases the signal to noise ratio over parts of the observation , is noted here , and its effects are discussed throughout the paper . apart from this , the data appeared essentially very clean , and just less than 600 seconds of data were removed on the basis of either very high ( @xmath16ct s@xmath2 ) accepted event rates , very high ( @xmath17ct s@xmath2 ) master veto rates , or large values of atomic oxygen column density along the line of sight .",
    "source detection and position determination were performed over the full field of view with the exsas local detect , map detect , and maximum likelihood algorithms ( zimmermann et al .",
    "images of pixel size 15  were used for the source detection .",
    "sources accepted as detections were those with a likelihood l @xmath1810 , and this gave rise to a number of sources .",
    "probabilities p , are related to maximum likelihood values l , by the relation p@xmath19 .",
    "thus a likelihood l of 10 corresponds to a gaussian significance of 4.0@xmath20 ( cruddace et al.@xcite ; zimmermann et al .",
    "@xcite ) .    over the central 25@xmath2125  area ( which we here concentrate on ) ,",
    "27 sources are detected , and these are listed in table  [ table_srclist ] as follows : source number ( col.1 ) , corrected right ascension and declination ( cols.2,3 ) , error on the source position ( col.4 , including a 39 systematic attitude solution error ) , likelihood of existence ( col.5 ) , net counts and error ( col.6 ) , count rates and errors after applying deadtime and vignetting corrections ( col.7 ) , and 0.1@xmath222.4kev flux , assuming a 5kev thermal bremsstrahlung model ( col.8 ) .",
    "count rates of the pspc - detected point sources can be converted into fluxes , assuming a variety of spectral models .",
    "a 1kev thermal bremsstrahlung model for instance , gives rise to fluxes 0.88 times those given in table  [ table_srclist ] .",
    "two hardness ratios are given in cols.9 & 10 , hr1 , defined as ( hard@xmath22soft)/(hard@xmath23soft ) ( hard and soft being the net counts in the hard ( channels 52@xmath22201 ) and soft ( channels 8@xmath2241 ) bands , respectively ) , and hr2 , defined as ( hard2@xmath22hard1)/(hard2@xmath23hard1 ) ( hard1 and hard2 being the net counts in the hard1 ( channels 52@xmath2290 ) and hard2 ( channels 91@xmath22201 ) bands , respectively ) .",
    "the corresponding errors are also given ( note that where a source is not formally detected in one of the four bands , an upper or lower limit to the hardness ratio has been calculated using a 2@xmath20 upper limit to the counts ) .",
    "hr1 is most sensitive to variations in the absorbing column , while hr2 traces more the power law index or temperature .",
    "hardness ratios can be used to give very crude estimates of the spectral parameters that best describe the source photons , and it may be worth comparing the tabulated values with plots in the literature which show the variation of hr1 and hr2 for simple spectral models ( see e.g.  pietsch et al .",
    "@xcite ) . the final column ( col.11 ) of table  [ table_srclist ] gives the nearest bright optical counterpart from the apm finding charts of irwin et al.(@xcite ) ; type ( s@xmath22stellar , g@xmath22galaxy , f@xmath22faint ) , b magnitude , and offset in arcseconds .",
    "note that further correlations with several catalogues were performed , notably with the simbad database operated at cds , strasbourg .",
    "finally , the only source flagged as extended ( and then , only at a likelihood of 8.4 ) is source p27 .    in an effort to improve the accuracy of the pspc source positions ,",
    "the ra and dec of five bright point sources ( p3 , p4 , p12 , p19 and p21 ) were compared with the apm finding charts of irwin et al .",
    "( @xcite ) .",
    "sources apparently associated with the central galaxy , although they appeared to be very coincident , were not used in the correction process , because of the confused and apparently extended nature of both their optical and x - ray emission .",
    "a very small offset of 004 in right ascension and 05 in declination is observed ( the coordinates given in table  [ table_srclist ] have been corrected for this ) .",

    "again , as in the case of p6 , p7 s spectrum is consistent with it being due to a background qso ( though the photon index is a little on the low side ) .",
    "interestingly , a feature quite close to source p7 is visible in the _ einstein _  ipc image ( fabbiano et al.@xcite ) ( it actually lies north of p7 and east of p6 ) , though only a handful of counts were received .",
    "again , like p6 , p7 may be unrelated to ngc  7793 , and instead is likely due to a background object .",
    "source p8 is very interesting , as it appears coincident ( to within 3 ) of a very bright h@xmath52 and siii  complex , identified in blair & long ( @xcite ) as being associated with a supernova remnant ( their s26 ) , one of the largest and brightest in their ngc  7793 sample .",
    "the fact that the x - ray spectrum of p8 is best fit by a low - temperature thermal model is very encouraging , and adds credence to the idea that s8 is associated with the supernova remnant s26 .",

    "source p9 , though quite bright , appears coincident with nothing whatsoever .",
    "situated at the very north - eastern edge of a filament of material from ngc  7793 , it may well be associated with the host galaxy , though no bright hii  regions or plausible sites of significant supernova activity lie anywhere within 1 .",
    "also , no enhancement at all in the radio emission is seen at this position ( see fig.3 ) , and the nearest optical counterpart , over 7  distant , is very faint ( below 21st magnitude ) .",
    "the x - ray spectrum of p9 , though very unconstrained , is very strange also , being very steep , but very absorbed .",
    "one other interesting facet of p9 s x - ray emission can be gleaned from fig.4 and the discussion within section  [ timing ] @xmath22 it is most definitely variable .",
    "there is a very significant difference between the x - ray strength of p9 during the first observation ( dec.92 ) , where some evidence for a gradual rise in brightness is seen , and the strength of the emission during the second observation ( may 93 ) , where very little emission is seen ( see table  [ table_halfyear ] ) .",
    "this change in the flux level of source p9 is very apparent in fig.5 , where contours of hard band ( channels 52@xmath22201 ) x - ray emission are shown for each of the two separate observations , the december 1992 observations and the may 1993 observation . in the _ einstein _",

    "the best fit to the p13 spectrum ( tabulated in table  [ table_fits_sources ] , and shown in fig.7 ) is a power - law model with a photon index of 1.76@xmath300.45 ( see above discussion regarding p6 ) .",
    "p13 does appear to be significantly variable . while the fitting of the p13 lightcurve ( see fig.4 ) to a constant flux level results in a @xmath48 of 40.85 ( suggesting a variability at the 3.9@xmath20 ( @xmath78=9.21 ) significance level ) , the difference in count rates obtained during the december 1992 and may 1993 observations ( see table  [ table_halfyear ] ) confirm that p13 is most definitely variable .",
    "given the lack of any obvious counterpart ( as is evident both in fig.6 and in blair & long ( @xcite ) ) , and the evidence presented here , the true nature of p13 still remains a mystery .",
    "the variability is strongly suggestive of the emission being due to a single object , and not , for instance , to a collection of x - ray binaries , say .",
    "it could be due a background qso , though the emission spectrum is a little flat when compared with typical qsos , and it would have to be a radio quiet system , as no significant enhancement in radio emission is seen ( fig.3 ) .",
    "p13 could be a young supernova , as these can attain x - ray luminosities equal to or greater than that of p13 .",

    "furthermore , even though p13 s emission is hard , its hardness ratio ( calculated as in the case of p8 ) being positive ( @xmath79 + 0.14 ) , supernovae are seen to show a large range in spectral hardness ( schlegel @xcite ; bregman & pildis ( @xcite ) .",
    "the fact , however , that nothing significant is seen in the radio ( fig.3 ) , and that the putative supernova was never actually observed in outburst , suggest strongly against the supernova argument . if p13 is contained within ngc  7793 , then it is certainly a superluminous source .",
    "it is unlikely to be an x - ray nova , unless we have caught it in outburst in both the december 1992 and the may 1993 observations .",
    "instead it is most likely ( if it is contained within ngc  7793 ) to be due to an accreting binary .",
    "bearing in mind however , that the eddington limit for a @xmath80 compact object is @xmath81erg  s@xmath2 , then p13 s x - ray emission suggests the prescence of a massive ( @xmath82 ) black hole x - ray binary .",
    "finally , nothing more conclusive can be said regarding the nature of p13 , when one considers its @xmath83 ratio .",
    "one can estimate a limiting optical magnitude at the position of p13 from the u.k.schmidt digitised sky survey optical image ( shown in figs.2 , 5 and 6 ) .",
    "this limit ( @xmath84 ) , when used in conjunction with the method of maccacaro et al.(@xcite ) , gives rise to a @xmath83 ratio of around 5 , rather high , but consistent with that of agns and x - ray binaries .",

    "the identity of p4 is more uncertain , as two very faint sources lie within 3  of the x - ray position .",
    "a bright star ( @xmath8=15.5 ) , lying nearly 17  distant , is unlikely to be the source , given the error in the x - ray source position ( 54 ; see table  [ table_srclist ] ) .",

    "p27 is almost certainly associated with a @xmath8=18.8 star - like object , nearly 4away .",
    "a small error in the x - ray position , together with a constant x - ray flux level , and a lack of any other optical features within more than 20  of the x - ray position , makes this statement quite secure .",

    "the rs absorption column value is entirely consistent with the column out of our own galaxy in the direction of ngc  7793 , 1.14@xmath50cm@xmath14 ( dickey & lockman @xcite ) , and when the column is frozen at this value , an equally good fit is obtained with no change in the other parameters .",
    "this is indicative of the emission having no intrinsic absorption , i.e. lying , in some sense , above the host galaxy ngc  7793 .",
    "this is good evidence for the majority of this unresolved emission being truly diffuse gas .",

    "this is rather on the high side when compared with other galaxies , where the temperature of the diffuse emission has been estimated to be more like 0.5kev or lower ( e.g.  bregman & pildis @xcite ; wang et al.@xcite ; ehle et al .",
    "@xcite ; snowden & pietsch @xcite ; read et al.@xcite ; pietsch & vogler @xcite ) , and may indicate that some fraction of the unresolved emission associated with ngc  7793 may be due to unresolved point sources .",
    "it is here we must proceed with some caution .",
    "there are several threads of evidence indicating that the unresolved emission is not truly diffuse , and is contaminated to some degree with unresolved point source emission .",
    "firstly , as discussed above , the temperature is high .",
    "secondly , as can be seen in fig.5 , even in the hard band , where the unresolved emission contributes only a little , variations in the unresolved emission structure can be seen between the december 1992 and the may 1993 observations ( note the changes in the ` plumes ' to the north - east and north - west of the bright southern p13 source ) .",
    "whether these changes are significant is very difficult to say , as the features in question lie at the 2 or 3@xmath20 level .",
    "nevertheless , point - source contamination appears very possible .",
    "comparison of equivalent soft band images to those in fig.5 , where the unresolved emission ( or at least the diffuse component of the unresolved emission ) contributes most , is fraught with difficulties , on account of the large increase in the entire field - of - view background ( mentioned earlier in sect .",
    "[ sec_obs_data ] ) during the second half of the december 1992 observation .",
    "nothing very conclusive can be said regarding the variation in the unresolved emission via this method .    in a further effort to establish whether there is any variation in the unresolved emission , a similar procedure to that performed on the point sources",
    "was performed here .",
    "both the unresolved ( the sources having been again removed to radii of 075 ( 10 for p13 ) ) and the background emission were binned ( using the same spatial regions as used in the extraction of the equivalent spectra ) into the two separate december 1992 and may 1993 observations , and also into the 14 individual observation blocks .",
    "the unresolved emission was then corrected for background , vignetting effects and exposure time , leading to unresolved emission count rates of 3.23@xmath301.07 cts s@xmath2 arcmin@xmath14 ( december 1992 ) and 3.77@xmath300.54 cts s@xmath2 arcmin@xmath14 ( may 1993 ) ( note the larger error in the december observation due to the increased background contamination ) .",
    "this gives rise to a probability of variability of 55.1% ( significant at only the 0.76@xmath20 level ) .",
    "furthermore , fitting of the 14-block lightcurve to a constant count rate results in a good fit ( with a @xmath48 of 14.15 ) , suggesting that the unresolved emission is only variable at a significance level of 0.91@xmath20 ( @xmath881.01 ) .",
    "the unresolved emission therefore appears to be non - variable in terms of flux level , though this of course , does not exclude the possibilty of the emission being contaminated with unresolved point sources .",
    "another way to search for contamination within the unresolved emission from unresolved point sources , is to search for these sources spectrally .",
    "several two - component models were fitted to the unresolved emission spectrum .",
    "these models had the general form of a cool ( @xmath150.5kev , more typical of spiral halos ) , unabsorbed thermal component , representing the true diffuse gaseous emission , and a hot ( @xmath1510kev ) component , representing any unresolved point source component .",
    "though all avenues were explored in terms of variation of models and freezing and freeing of parameters , no significant improvement on the one - component rs model was obtained .",
    "assuming at first then , that this unresolved emission is due entirely to hot gas , then mean physical properties of this gas can be inferred from the above results if we make some assumptions about the geometry of the emission .",
    "here we have assumed the simple geometry of the emission being hemispherical with a radius of 35 ( in actuality , only a rough approximation to the gas properties can be calculated here and assumption of a slightly different radius gives rise to very similar results ) .    using the volume derived for this hemispherical ` bubble ' model ,",
    "the fitted emission measure @xmath89 ( where @xmath90 is the ` filling factor '  the fraction of the total volume @xmath91 which is occupied by the emitting gas ) can be used to infer the mean electron density , @xmath92 , and hence the total mass @xmath93 , thermal energy @xmath94 and cooling time @xmath95 of the gas .    performing these calculations , after first accounting for the extra emission lost in the ` holes ' left after the source - subtraction procedure , one arrives at approximate values to the physical properties of the gaseous emission as follows ; x - ray luminosity @xmath96 ( 0.1@xmath222.4kev ) 4.1@xmath97erg s@xmath2 ; @xmath92 , 4.6@xmath98@xmath99 ; @xmath93 , @xmath100 @xmath101 ; @xmath94 , 5.4@xmath102erg ; @xmath95 , 4.2gyr .",
    "if , as seems likely however , some contamination from unresolved point sources exists , then the above results should only be taken as upper limits .",
    "in comparing the x - ray properties of ngc  7793 with other galaxies , it is useful to compare its properties with those of its group neighbours .",
    "the sculptor group is possibly the nearest small group of galaxies to our own local group , and as such , much is known about the individual members .",
    "kinematical studies ( e.g. puche & carignan @xcite ) have established the group to be made up of five major members ( ngc  55 , ngc  247 , ngc  253 , ngc  300 and ngc  7793 ) .",

    "it appears , in spite of its small size , to be the second most active galaxy in the group , at least in terms of its far - infrared properties , the most active being of course the famous large starburst , ngc  253 .",
    "disregarding ngc  253 for the moment , ngc  7793 , although small , is as optically bright or brighter than the remaining three , and has the highest @xmath110 value of the four non - starbursts .    in terms of ngc",
    "7793 s x - ray emission , the situation is complicated by the fact that p13 may or may not belong to the galaxy .",
    "if it does , then ngc  7793 appears to lie midway between the very quiescent ngc  55 , ngc  247 and ngc  300 , and the starburst ngc  253 , lying directly on the @xmath111 correlation of read & ponman ( @xcite ) , and slightly above their @xmath112 correlation .",
    "if p13 does not belong , then ngc  7793 lies under the @xmath111 correlation , appearing almost identical to m33 ( read et al .",
    "@xcite ) , and directly on the @xmath112 correlation , almost coincident with ngc  55 .    why ngc  7793 is relatively rather bright ( in all wavebands , possibly including the x - ray ) for its size",
    "may be due to that fact ; its size , or rather , the size of its dark halo . in an effort to explain why , when the average value of @xmath113 , for the individual sculptor galaxies ( the value for ngc  7793 itself being the smallest , at around 5 ) , the value for the group as a whole is ten times higher , puche & carignan , in a series of papers ( @xcite and the references therein ) , produced hi  rotation curves and mass models for each of the five individual systems .",
    "ngc  7793 is seen to possess the only truly declining rotation curve , and as such , is very rare within the local universe ( carignan & puche @xcite ) .",
    "in fact , a model comprising the luminous components and ` no dark matter ' can be adequately fit to the ngc  7793 hi  data . its halo is found to be very small ( @xmath114kpc , approximately the size of the diffuse x - ray emission region ) , and its central density is found to be a factor 10@xmath2215 higher than is seen in other late type spirals .",
    "an interesting aspect of the x - ray emission from ngc  7793 is the unresolved emission , and more specifically , its temperature .",
    "as mentioned earlier , the temperature obtained in the spectral fitting of the unresolved spectrum , @xmath791kev , is high , typical normal and starburst galaxies containing diffuse emission at temperatures more like 0.5kev or lower .",
    "note ( from table  [ table_sculptor ] ) that the estimated temperature of the ` diffuse ' emission in ngc  55 , is also around 1kev ( schlegel et al .",
    "@xcite ) . as we shall see here , comparing these two systems unresolved emission properties",
    "is particularly useful .",
    "it is very possible , as discussed earlier , that the unresolved emission is due in part to unresolved sources .",
    "we have discussed earlier our unsuccessful search for this unresolved component , but perhaps it is worth some further discussion on more theoretical grounds . following similar arguments to those of primini et al .",
    "( @xcite ) , and to those of schlegel et al .",
    "( @xcite ) ( who analysed the ngc  55 unresolved emission ) , one can arrive at some interesting conclusions as regards the integrated emission of the unresolved point sources ( i.e.  stars , supernova remnants , cataclysmic variables and low- and high - mass x - ray binaries ) within ngc  7793 .    because of their very similar unresolved x - ray emission properties , both in terms of luminosity ( 3.0@xmath97erg s@xmath2 for ngc  55 , compared to 4.1@xmath97erg s@xmath2 in the present case ) and temperature , many of the conclusions reached as regards ngc  55 by schlegel et al .",
    "( @xcite ) , can be applied here to ngc  7793 .",
    "ngc  7793 s smaller size however , means that the constraints placed are even more severe .",
    "for instance , both cataclysmic variables ( with typical @xmath96 s of @xmath115erg s@xmath2 ; cordova ( @xcite ) ) and active stars ( @xmath116erg s@xmath2 ) fail , by well over two orders of magnitude , to account for the unresolved x - ray emission within ngc  7793 .",
    "supernova remnants ( @xmath96 , typically being @xmath117erg s@xmath2 ) could account for the emission , though a few hundred would be needed ( compared to the 28 detected by blair & long ( @xcite ) .",
    "a further problem related to snrs accounting for the unresolved emission , is that , as ngc  7793 is rather face - on , the snr spectra would be relatively unabsorbed , and therefore too soft , when compared with the rather hard unresolved spectrum observed .",
    "x - ray binaries however , may well be able to explain the unresolved emission within ngc  7793 .",
    "only a hundred or so low - luminosity ( @xmath118erg s@xmath2 ) systems , or just a handful of high luminosity ( @xmath119erg s@xmath2 ) systems are required to account for the flux seen .",
    "furthermore , the unresolved emission appears to be rather uniform ( see fig.2 ) , and follows the disc quite well , as would a population of evolved stars .",
    "one must be careful however as , for instance , if there were a largish collection of xrbs within ngc  7793 , we might expect to detect some , especially within the disc .",
    "all of the discrete sources detected , with the exception of source p10 ( which is likely a snr or superbubble ) , appear around the edge of the galaxy .",
    "no plausible xrb candidates are detected within the ngc  7793 disc .",
    "source p13 may possibly be a high - mass xrb , though its luminosity is several times the eddington limit for a @xmath80 compact object ( @xmath81erg  s@xmath2 ) .",
    "furthermore , though the temperature obtained for the unresolved emission is somewhat hotter than is generally seen in spiral galaxies , it is not very hot , and is constrained , at least at the 1@xmath20 confidence level to be less than @xmath120kev .",
    "this may be too cool for the emission to be explained in terms of a large proportion of it being due to evolved stars ( note the @xmath44 confidence limit to the unresolved emission temperature is rather much high , however ) .",
    "we have observed the _ rosat _  pspc data from a field centred on the nearby sculptor galaxy ngc  7793 .",
    "27 sources are detected within the central 25@xmath2125area , several appearing to be variable , and the brightest being situated to the south of ngc  7793 . in addition to point source emission , unresolved residual emission is detected within and around ngc  7793 .",
    "our findings with regard to the observed point - source and unresolved emission can be summarized as follows :    \\1 .",
    "seven point sources are detected within the optical confines of ngc  7793 , two of which appear to be unrelated to the host galaxy .",
    "four of the others appear to be associated with x - ray binaries , supernova remnants or superbubbles within the galaxy .",
    "interestingly , no significant enhancement is seen at the galactic nucleus .",
    "the remaining source , the brightest point source in the field , lies on the southern rim of ngc  7793 , and is now seen not to be associated with a @xmath3 redshift qso , as was previously thought .",
    "it may be associated with ngc  7793 ( with a ( 0.1@xmath222.4kev ) @xmath96 of 8.7@xmath97erg s@xmath2 ) , though no obvious counterpart is seen .",
    "it is seen to be significantly time variable , and may be a high - mass , possibly black hole x - ray binary .",
    "unresolved residual emission is also observed , quite uniformly distributed over the galaxy , extending to a radius of perhaps 4kpc .",
    "spectral fitting of this emission indicates that it is intrinsically , rather unabsorbed , suggesting that a large component of the emission may be diffuse hot gas surrounding the system .",
    "the fitted temperature however ( @xmath121kev ) implies that a significant contribution from unresolved point sources ( here thought to be x - ray binaries ) is likely .",
    "comparison of ngc  7793 s x - ray properties with its sculptor group neighbours ( and with other galaxies in general ) depends largely on whether the bright source p13 is associated with ngc  7793 or not .",
    "if it is , then ngc  7793 , in terms of its activity , lies somewhere between the very quiescent sculptor galaxies ngc  55 , ngc  247 and ngc  300 , and the well - known starburst ngc  253 .",

    "<S> we report here the results of spectral imaging observations with the _ rosat _  pspc of the field surrounding the very nearby ( @xmath0mpc ) sculptor galaxy , ngc  7793 . </S>",
    "<S> many point sources are detected within the field , several of them showing evidence for variability . </S>",
    "<S> seven sources are seen to lie within the optical confines of the system , the brightest ( @xmath1erg s@xmath2 ) , lying to the southern edge of ngc  7793 . </S>",
    "<S> this source , also observed to be variable , is seen now , not to be associated with a @xmath3 redshift qso , as was previously thought . </S>",
    "<S> a number of the other sources within the ngc  7793 disc are likely to be due to x - ray binaries , supernova remnants or superbubbles within the galaxy itself . </S>",
    "<S> other sources may be associated with background agn . </S>",
    "<S> in addition to the point source emission , rather uniform unresolved emission is detected in and around ngc  7793 extending to a radius of perhaps 4kpc . </S>",
    "<S> this emission is likely to be contaminated to some degree by unresolved point sources , as its temperature ( @xmath4kev ) is rather hotter than is seen for the diffuse gas components in other nearby spiral galaxies . comparing the x - ray properties of ngc  7793 with those of the remaining sculptor group members , </S>",
    "<S> suggests that it may , in terms of activity , lie somewhere between its quiescent and starburst neighbours . </S>"
