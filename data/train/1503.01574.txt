    "3(b ) ) results from the average of two broad excitations ( @xmath107 and @xmath108 ) leads us to @xmath109  mev and hence @xmath110  mev .",
    "this value of @xmath17 is comparable to the theoretical expectation for ru  @xcite and what has been extracted from spin resolved arpes  @xcite .",
    "notice that the @xmath111  mev splitting  possibly accessible through indirect rixs processes  is expected near the elastic line but not resolved in this experiment .",
    "as @xmath112 for ca@xmath1ruo@xmath2 , it implies that @xmath113 and hence @xmath114 and @xmath115 .",

    "3(a ) , exhibit a pronounced excitation at @xmath116  mev .",
    "if this is a result of an average of two excitations , once again @xmath109  mev is found .",
    "thus , by including a spin - orbit coupling of 200 mev , a consistent description of the orbital hole occupation extracted from xas and the excitations of the rixs spectra on both sr@xmath1ruo@xmath2  and ca@xmath1ruo@xmath2  is obtained .",
    "implications of spin - orbit coupling @xmath117 in @xmath3-transition oxide materials have already been evaluated in a number of papers  @xcite .",
    "the magnon bandwidth in ca@xmath1ruo@xmath2  is , for example , predicted  @xcite to be controlled by @xmath118 .",
    "neutron experiments should be performed to test this prediction .",
    "magnetic moments are also influenced but not uniquely defined by @xmath119  @xcite . as the experiments on ca@xmath1ruo@xmath2  suggest that @xmath89  is dominated by @xmath120 orbitals , it is possible to approximate @xmath89@xmath121@xmath83@xmath84@xmath85 .",
    "then , both @xmath87  and @xmath89  are more elegantly expressed in spherical harmonic notation :  @xmath87=@xmath122 and @xmath89@xmath123 . in this simplistic limit ,",
    "the role of spin - orbit interaction is to split the four - fold degeneracy of @xmath75  and @xmath74  into two - fold degenerated @xmath124 and @xmath125 states ",
    "see fig .",
    "it has been argued that even modest coulomb interaction @xmath126 is sufficient to split these @xmath124 and @xmath125 states and hence drive the mott insulating transition  @xcite .",
    "therefore , as in layered iridates , a combination of spin - orbit interaction and electron correlations may be sufficient to drive the mott insulating ground state .",
    "another interesting question is how spin - orbit interaction impacts the superconducting ground state in sr@xmath1ruo@xmath2 .",
    "it has been suggested theoretically that ferromagnetic interactions would result in a chiral @xmath4-wave superconducting state  @xcite driven by the @xmath46-dominated @xmath127-band . by contrast , if superconductivity is driven by the @xmath120-dominated @xmath128- and @xmath129-bands  @xcite , then spin - orbit coupling lifts the ground state degeneracy in favor of a helical @xmath4-wave symmetry  @xcite .",
    "these considerations were , however , based on the assumption that spin - orbit interaction is weak compared to the fermi energy @xmath130",
    "it is hence useful to compare the energy scales of superconductivity , spin - orbit coupling and the fermi energy @xmath130 . as @xmath131k",
    ", the superconducting gap amplitude is expected in the @xmath132  mev range  @xcite .",
    "the fermi energy @xmath133 ( a_k / m^*)$ ]  @xcite can be estimated from the fermi surface area @xmath134 and the quasiparticle mass @xmath135 . for the @xmath127-band , quantum oscillation experiments  @xcite yield oscillation frequency @xmath136  kt and @xmath137 , where @xmath138 is the free electron mass .",
    "these values imply that @xmath139  mev , and as expected @xmath140 .",
    "similar values of @xmath130 are found for the @xmath128- and @xmath129- bands .",
    "strong electron correlations therefore drive even the @xmath127-electrons into the regime @xmath141 , where spin @xmath142 and orbital @xmath143 are no longer good quantum numbers .",
    "cooper pairs in sr@xmath1ruo@xmath2   therefore have to be composed of electronic pseudo - spins .",
    "if realized , the same would likely be true for superconductivity in layered iridates .",
    "in summary , we have performed a combined light absorption and oxygen @xmath0-edge resonant inelastic x - ray spectroscopy study of the ruthenates ( ca , sr)@xmath6ruo@xmath2 .",
    "special attention was given to the ru @xmath13 states , probed through their hybridization with oxygen @xmath4-orbitals .",
