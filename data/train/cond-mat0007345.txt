    "the influence of crystal lattice disorder on superconducting properties is one of the important problems of superconductivity .",
    "theoretical insights into this field have been initiated by seminal anderson s work@xcite . in low-@xmath6 superconductors ( ltscs )",
    "the disorder influence on critical temperature @xmath6 is believed to be mainly due to dependences of density of states at the fermi level @xmath13 , constant of electron - phonon interaction @xmath14 or coulomb interaction on disorder ( see reviews in refs .   ) .",
    "many aspects of this problem are still not understood clearly .",
    "things get much worse in the case of high-@xmath6 superconductors ( htscs ) which are layered cuprates with perovskite - related structure .",
    "really , it is hardly possible to consider the crystal - disorder effects in htscs quite properly in circumstances where the nature of superconducting pairing in these compounds is still controversial @xcite .",
    "notwithstanding this handicap , the crystal - lattice disorder effects in htscs have become topic of a large body of experimental and theoretical research@xcite .",
    "the necessity of such type of studies is quite obvious from technological and fundamental points of view .    in htscs as well as in ltscs",
    "the superconductivity involves pairs of electrons .",
    "therefore , although the nature of superconducting paired state in the htscs is still obscure , it can be assumed that some features of the disorder influence should be common for both types of superconductors . this can be seen from the following consideration .",
    "the order parameter in the ginzburg - landau theory is written as @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the amplitude and @xmath17 the phase of this parameter .",
    "the disorder can destroy the superconductivity either by reducing the amplitude of the order parameter or by destroying the phase coherence of superconducting electrons .",
    "the relative contribution of each of these mechanisms depends on the degree of inhomogeneity of the superconducting system@xcite .",
    "the role of inhomogeneity can be judged by comparing the two characteristic lengths @xmath18 and @xmath19 , the first of which is characteristic scale of inhomogeneity associated with disorder and the second is the ginzburg - landau coherence length for dirty superconductors @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the coherence length at @xmath22 , @xmath23 is the electron diffusion coefficient ( @xmath24 is fermi velocity , @xmath25 is electron elastic scattering length ) , @xmath26 ) .",
    "when @xmath27 ( as for instance , in the case of the impurity or point defects of crystal lattice ) , the system behaves as homogeneous one , and disorder affects mainly the order parameter . in the opposite case , when @xmath28 , the system is inhomogeneous .",
    "an example of such system is granular metal consisting of metal grains separated by dielectric interlayer ( @xmath18 is grain size in this case ) .",
    "the reduction in the critical temperature @xmath6 in inhomogeneous systems is largely due to the suppression of phase coherence between weakly coupled superconducting regions",
    ". both mechanisms of the @xmath6 reduction under disorder ( reducing the amplitude of the order parameter and destroying the phase coherence of superconducting electrons ) can operate simultaneously in real systems .",
    "the htscs are usually characterized by low values of @xmath24 and @xmath29 as compared with that of ltscs .",
    "together with high @xmath6 values , this should lead , according eq .",
    "( 1 ) , to exceptionally short superconducting coherence length .",
    "indeed , it was found , for example , in yba@xmath30cu@xmath31o@xmath2 that @xmath32 is about @xmath33  nm and @xmath34  nm , parallel and perpendicular to the cuo@xmath0layer@xcite . from this",
    "it follows that the influence of structure inhomogeneity and thus the suppression of phase coherence should be in general far more important in htscs than in ltscs .",
    "actually the htsc films or bulk samples are always disordered and inhomogeneous to some extent .",
    "for example , in polycrystalline samples the regions of grain boundaries are highly disordered",
    ". these regions can be not only non - superconductive , but dielectric as well@xcite .",
    "in fact , polycrystalline samples are granular metals in which superconducting coherence between the grains can be established by josephson coupling . beside the granularity ,",
    "chemical - composition inhomogeneity is quite common in htscs .",
    "the influence of this type of inhomogeneity on superconductivity can be rather strong since charge carrier density of htscs depends strongly on chemical composition@xcite .",
    "the composition disorder can contribute to destroying of superconducting phase coherence in the same fashion as the granularity .",
    "in most cases the inhomogeneous distribution of oxygen leads to this type of disorder .",
    "two main sources for oxygen inhomogeneity can be distinguished : extrinsic and intrinsic .",
    "extrinsic source is due to various technological factors of sample preparation .",
    "the intrinsic one is connected with phase separation of htscs on two phases with different oxygen and hence charge carrier concentration@xcite .",
    "it is clear from the aforesaid that to a good approximation the two main types of disorder , which are essential for superconductivity , can be distinguished .",
    "the first of them is disorder associated with perturbations of crystal lattice on the atomic scale ( impurities , vacancies , and the like ) .",
    "this type of disorder is often called microscopic .",
    "it can be responsible for electron localization and other phenomena@xcite which affect the superconducting order parameter .",
    "the second type of disorder is associated with structural inhomogeneity of superconductor ( granular structure , phase separation , inhomogeneity due to technological reasons ) .",
    "the disorder scale in this case is much more than interatomic distances ( at least , more than , say , 10 - 100 nm ) and hence , this disorder can be called macroscopic .",
    "the macroscopic disorder affects mainly the superconducting phase coherence . in experimental studies",
    "it is desirable to separate the effects of microscopic and macroscopic disorder or , at least , to be aware of the possible joint action of them in the case where such separation is difficult .",
    "ignoring this point could lead to serious errors in interpretation of experimental results or to total their misunderstanding .    in study of disorder effects in htscs",
    "it is important to use reliable methods of controllable disordering .",
    "ideally , it is desirable to `` tune '' disorder while keeping other parameters fixed . at present",
    ", the main method which is expected to be somewhat close to such ideal is irradiation of superconductor with fast ( charged or uncharged ) particles or with high - energy photons ( @xmath4-rays ) . by appropriate choice of particles and their energy the irradiation would be expected to produce only the microscopic disorder ( vacancies and interstitials ) , although in the htscs a possibility of inducing of compositional disorder must be always taken into account .    in this communication",
    "we present some new results of investigation of influence of @xmath4-irradiation on the critical temperature of bulk polycrystalline yba@xmath30cu@xmath31o@xmath2 ( ybco ) .",
    "the disordering of htscs with @xmath4-rays was used rather often in previous experiments , especially in the first years after discovery of htscs@xcite .",
    "such type of investigations could have an applied importance in the case of possible use of htscs in environments of nuclear reactors or space stations .",
    "the fundamental importance of experiments of this sort is also beyond question .",
    "it is known that @xmath4-rays produce ionization in solids@xcite . in metals ,",
    "ionization produced by radiation is very rapidly neutralized by the conduction electrons@xcite . beside this , @xmath4-rays produce displaced atoms in solid , namely , vacancy - interstitial pairs ( frenkel defects ) of small separation , randomly distributed through the lattice .",
    "interaction of @xmath4-rays with matter , which leads to atomic displacements , occurs principally by means of three mechanisms : the photoelectric effect , the compton effect , and pair production@xcite . in all three processes electrons",
    "are ejected with energy comparable with the original @xmath4-ray energy , and thus @xmath4-ray irradiation inevitably causes a substance to be internally bombarded by fairly energetic electrons@xcite . at @xmath4-ray energy of a few mev ,",
    "the dominant contribution to displacement production comes from compton effect .",
    "when compared with other irradiation sources , @xmath4-rays have one unquestionable advantage .",
    "attenuation distances of @xmath4-rays with energies of few mev are order of a few centimeters .",
    "this enables one to investigate bulk samples of htscs .",
    "by contrast , penetration distances for irradiation with particles or ions are small . in this case",
    "it is possible to study the disorder effects quite properly only in rather thin films of htscs .",
    "otherwise , it can not be excluded the implantation and doping effects as well as inhomogeneity of damage that plagues the interpretation of the experimental results .",
    "a disadvantage of @xmath4-rays is that the available monoenergetic radiactive sources give low @xmath4-ray fluxes .",
    "taking into account the effective cross section for atomic displacement through the compton mechanism@xcite one would not expect any significant changes in the conductivity of typical metals , like copper .",
    "indeed , a typical dose of @xmath4-ray irradiation is about @xmath35  photons/@xmath36 . for this dose ,",
    "the number of displacements per atom ( dpa ) for copper is about @xmath37@xcite .",
    "the calculated increase in resistivity of copper due to 1% of point defects ( that is for 0.01 dpa ) is about 1  @xmath38  cm@xcite . from this",
    "it is apparent that the fraction of displaced atoms , which can be produced through the compton mechanism in a convenient irradiation time , should not induce any noticeable resistance variations in good metals .",
    "however , in poor conductors with low charge density , such as semiconductors , @xmath4-rays can strongly influence the conductivity through the carrier removal@xcite .",
    "charge - carrier density in optimally doped htscs ( such as ybco ) is usually about @xmath39  @xmath40@xcite , that is well below that of good metals .",
    "this density is not however low enough to expect some significant influence of @xmath4-ray irradiation on conductivity and order parameter of htscs , and hence , on their @xmath6 . in spite of this , in some known experiments a quite appreciable effect of @xmath4-irradiation on @xmath6 and resitivity of ybco was revealed .",
    "the maximal decrease in @xmath6 was found to be about 2k by high doses @xmath41  mr@xcite . in general , the published experimental results@xcite about the effect of @xmath4-irradiation on ybco are quite contradictory ( all of them concern the optimally doped ybco with @xmath6 above 90 k ) .",
    "for example , in contrast to ref .",
    ", in some other investigations no change in @xmath6 was found at all up to doses about 1000 mr@xcite , or found to be much less than 1 k@xcite .",
    "the results about @xmath4-ray effect in resistivity are even more conflicting .",
    "it is possible to find among them such extremal cases : a ) no influence at all up to dose @xmath42",
    "mr@xcite ; b ) a nearly tenfold increase in resistivity at @xmath43  mr@xcite .",
    "the above - mentioned relevant @xmath4-ray papers@xcite just present experimental results without much ( or any ) consideration of possible mechanisms of @xmath4-ray influence on conductivity and @xmath6 of htscs , or presentation of general view on such influence . in none of them",
    "the degree of radiation damage ( the value of dpa ) has been estimated that severely hinders the understanding and interpretation of the results .",
    "it may be inferred , therefore , that the undestanding of @xmath4-ray influence on htscs is far from completion and that further experimental and theoretical investigations of this matter are necessary .    in this paper , we report investigation of the effect of @xmath4-rays on @xmath6 and resistive transition to superconducting state in bulk polycrystalline sample of optimally doped ybco . we have observed non - monotonic behavior of @xmath6 with increasing irradiation dose @xmath7 ( up to about 220 mr ) : @xmath6 decreases at low doses ( @xmath8  mr ) approximately by 2 k and then rises , forming a minimum .",
    "quite unexpected , at highest doses ( @xmath10  mr ) @xmath6 value goes clearly down again .",
    "the temperature width , @xmath11 , of resistive superconducting transition increases rather sharp with dose in the range @xmath44  mr and somewhat drops at higher dose .",
    "we believe that this interesting effect is revealed for the first time . unlike previous works@xcite ,",
    "we have calculated cross sections for the displacement of different kinds of lattice atoms in ybco by @xmath4-rays due to the compton process . to our knowledge",
    ", nobody has done it before for htscs .",
    "this enables us to estimate the possible dpa value and has facilitated the interpretation of results .    on the strength of the obtained results and those of previous investigations , together with the results of radiation damage calculation",
    ", we come to conclusion that for commonly used doses ( up to @xmath45  1000 mr ) @xmath4-rays should not produce any substantial influence on superconducting properties and conductivity of single - crystal htscs . in polycrystalline samples",
    "however this influence can be fairly strong .",
    "these samples , as was mentioned above , are in fact granular metals which consist of metallic grains separated by dielectric interlayers . in the htscs the regions of grain boundaries , and near environtments of them , are strongly depleted with charge carriers@xcite and thus should be very sensitive to @xmath4-rays and radiation of any other kind . for this reason the conductivity and @xmath6 in polycrystalline htscs can be markedly affected by @xmath4-rays even at commonly used not very high doses .",
    "this is the main conclusion of our paper .",
    "based on this it is possible to understand , at least qualitatively , the sharp dictinction between the known published results about @xmath4-ray influence on ybco . in this paper ,",
    "the possible mechanisms of impact of radiation - damage in grain boundary regions upon the conductivity and @xmath6 in ybco are considered . beside the atomic displacements ,",
    "the probable effects of atom ionization in grain boundary regions by @xmath4-rays are speculatively discussed .",
    "for sample preparing the conventional solid - state reaction method was used .",
    "fine powders of y@xmath0o@xmath1 , bao and cuo were mixed in alumina mortar in the composition of yba@xmath30cu@xmath31o@xmath2 .",
    "then the mixture was pressed to pellet at pressure about 100 mpa .",
    "this pellet was heated at @xmath46@xmath47c in air and then slowly cooled down . from the pellet",
    "a 3.1@xmath486.3@xmath4822  mm@xmath49 bar was cut . the oxygen content in sample",
    "was estimated to be about 6.9 ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "the sample was polycrystalline with rather large grain size ( about 12 @xmath50 m ) .",
    "density of sample was 5.2 g / cm@xmath49 , that comprises about 80% of the expected density for this compound .",
    "the 20% difference can be attributed to an occurence of small voids and pores that is quite usual for polycrystalline samples .",
    "irradiation was carried out using @xmath5co @xmath4-ray source at room temperature in air at different doses up to @xmath52  mr .",
    "this isotope emitts the equal amounts of photons with energies 1.17 mev and 1.33 mev .",
    "the dose rate of used source was @xmath53  r / h .",
    "the temperature dependences of resistance @xmath54 were measured by standard four - probe method with a direct measuring current 10 ma .",
    "the accuracy of temperature measurements was estimated to be about 0.1 k.",
    "in experimental investigations of radiation effects in solids it is imperative to realize the degree of disorder produced by irradiation in objects studied . without such knowledge , adequate understanding and interpretation of results obtained is impossible . in many cases such ignorance can lead to wrong conclusions . for this reason , calculations of possible radiation damage , primarilly the dpa values , become nowadays an integral part of the most of radiation - effect investigations .",
    "for example , at ion irradiation studies the well - known trim simulation program@xcite is widely used .",
    "the surprising thing is that one can not find even rough estimates of dpa in the known studies of @xmath4-ray effect in ybco@xcite .",
    "this type of calculations is rather cumbersome and may be for this reason they had not been done in the above - mentioned studies .",
    "the principal concepts of such calculations are however quite established@xcite and therefore the estimation of dpa or concentration of point defects induced by @xmath4-rays can be done without principal difficulties .    in this work",
    "we have calculated the cross sections for atomic displacements in ybco by @xmath4-rays due to the compton process which is a main producer of energetic electrons at photon energy about 1 mev@xcite .",
    "somewhat different versions of this type of calculation are presented in ref .  .",
    "in this study the version of ref .   @xcite was used .",
    "the number of atoms displaced in unit volume ( cm@xmath49 ) per second is expressed in ref .   by @xmath55 where @xmath56 is number of atoms per unit volume ;",
    "@xmath57 is cross section for an atom to be displaced by an electron of energy @xmath58 ; @xmath59 is flux density of ejected compton electrons per @xmath36/sec , at energy @xmath58 , per unit range of energy ; @xmath60 is maximal energy of compton electron , which is given by @xmath61 with @xmath62 being photon energy in monoenergetic @xmath4-ray flux .",

    "it is assumed@xcite that an atom is always displaced from its lattice site when it receives energy greater then @xmath79 and is never displaced at lower energy .",
    "therefore , it should be put down @xmath80 in eq .",
    "( 3 ) if @xmath81 . for the greater values of @xmath58",
    "we have used the known mckinley - feshbach formula@xcite to calculate @xmath57 : @xmath82 - \\ln\\frac{t_m}{e_d } \\right \\ }   \\right ]   \\eqno(6)\\ ] ] where @xmath83 ; @xmath84 that is the ratio of electron and light velocities for which the relation @xmath85 is true if @xmath58 is taken in the units of @xmath86 ; @xmath87 , and @xmath88 is the maximum energy which can be transferred in a collision by an electron of kinetic energy @xmath58 : @xmath89 where @xmath90 is the target atomic mass .",
    "some additional comments about the mckinley - feshbach formula are necessary .",
    "it is assumed that it is accurate to one percent for @xmath74 up to 40@xcite .",
    "atomic numbers of elements in ybco are 8(o ) , 29 ( cu ) , 39 ( y ) , and 56 ( ba ) . therefore , an error more than one percent should be expected only for ba atoms . but displacement cross section for heavy atoms is usually much less than for light ones , and thus , contribution from heavy atoms to total dpa should be rather small . for this reason we did not expect a significant error with the mckinley - feshbach formula .",
    "this was justified by our calculations which are presented below .",
    "if the struck atom has large enough energy it can cause secondary displacements@xcite which can also be taken into account at calculation of numbers of the displaced atoms due to @xmath4-rays@xcite .",
    "it is easy to see however that at electron energy about 1 mev the values of @xmath88 given by eq .",
    "( 7 ) are quite small and therefore this effect can be neglected .",
    "nontheless , we have done cascade calculations following the recommendations of refs .   and have found that primary displacement cross sections differ from these of total displacement cross sections only by few percents . although we will present below the total displacement cross sections , it should be kept in mind that they differ very slightly from those of obtained using eqs .",
    "( 4)(7 ) .",
    "the calculated values of the effective cross section for atomic displacement by @xmath4-rays from @xmath5co source through the compton effect , @xmath91 ) , at different values of threshold energy @xmath79 for ions in ybco are given in table  [ table1 ] .",
    "the values of @xmath92 presented in this table are the weighted averages for photons with energies 1.17 mev and 1.33 mev which are emitted by @xmath5co source .",
    "the values of @xmath56 for different ions at calculation of @xmath92 were just partial ion densities for compound yba@xmath0cu@xmath1o@xmath2 deduced taking into account the compact ybco mass density which is about 6.4  g / cm@xmath49 .",
    "it can be seen from table  [ table1 ] that the @xmath92 values depend crucially on threshold energy @xmath79 .",
    "it is worth noting also that the @xmath92 values for heavy ba ions are the least as compared with other ions , as expected .",
    "the data of table  [ table1 ] will be used below for estimation of possible dpa values in studied ybco after @xmath4-irradiation .",
    "the temperature dependence of sample resistivity @xmath93 before @xmath4-irradiation is presented in fig .  1 .",
    "the dependence is quite common for optimally doped ybco : it is linear above the superconducting resistive transition up to room temperature , @xmath6 value is about 93  k. we have defined experimental @xmath6 to be the temperature at which normal resistance @xmath94 is halved . the dependences @xmath95 in the range of resistive transition have been obtained by extrapolation of linear @xmath54 dependence to this region .",
    "we have used the temperature @xmath96 at which resistance goes to zero as a second characteristic of resistive transition .",
    "in fact , @xmath96 is the end point of resistive transition to superconducting state , and is an essential characteristic which should be taken into account for granular or inhomogeneous superconductors .",
    "the difference in @xmath6 and @xmath96 , @xmath97 , is some quite definite measure of the width of resistive transition .    in early days of htsc investigations",
    "( and quite often up to date ) the experimental @xmath6 was defined as the temperature @xmath98 at the onset of the superconducting transition . although this is also quite essential characteristic of resistive transition , it can be evaluated with much less precision than @xmath6 or @xmath96 . for this reason only the observed changes in @xmath6 and @xmath96 with @xmath4-ray dose will be considered below .",
    "the @xmath99 curves for different @xmath4-ray doses @xmath7 in the temperature range of superconducting transition are presented in fig .",
    "it can be seen that @xmath6 depends on @xmath7 in a non - monotonic way .",
    "more clearly this is seen in fig .  3 where the changes in @xmath6 and @xmath96 with @xmath4-ray dose are shown .",
    "it follows from the figure that @xmath6 decreases at low dose ( @xmath8  mr ) by @xmath100  k and then rises , forming a minimum . at higher dose ( @xmath10  mr ) @xmath6 value goes clearly down again .",
    "the zero - resistance temperature @xmath96 has been changing with @xmath4-ray dose in the nearly same way as @xmath6 , but with greater amplitude : the initial decrease in @xmath96 is about 4 k. the magnitude of @xmath11 ( which characterizes the width of resistive transition and , hence , the sample inhomogeneity ) increases with dose in the range @xmath44  mr and somewhat drops at higher doses ( fig .  4 ) .    the observed initial @xmath6 decrease with @xmath4-ray dose ( fig .",
    "3 ) corresponds to some of previous studies@xcite , but the general picture of non - monotonic dependence of @xmath6 on radiation dose looks like a surprising thing . to our knowledge such behavior of @xmath6 in htsc with @xmath4-ray dose",
    "is found for the first time .",
    "a somewhat ( or partially ) similar non - monotonic behavior has been seen previously @xcite in @xmath4-irradiated ybco - related compound y@xmath101sm@xmath102ba@xmath0cu@xmath1o@xmath2 , but for the onset temperature @xmath98 only . as this took place",
    ", the zero - resistance temperature @xmath96 had not manifested any marked influence of @xmath4-irradiation@xcite .",
    "the resistive - transition curves shown in ref .",
    "are rather steep ( no large difference between the @xmath6 and @xmath96 values ) . at the same time",
    "the reported values of the onset temperature @xmath98 ( about 140  k ) appear to be too high for ybco - related compounds ( compare , for example , with the data of ref .   ) . in our opinion in evaluating the onset temperature @xmath98 from @xmath54 curves",
    "the significant error is possible . since an employed procedure for evaluating of the @xmath98 values has not been outlined in ref .",
    "one should take the @xmath98 values in it and the described non - monotonic behavior @xmath98 with @xmath4-ray dose with some precaution .",
    "the effect of @xmath4-rays in the resistivity of sample studied was found to be appreciable only in the temperature range of rather broad resistive superconducting transition ( fig .  2 ) . with increasing temperature away from @xmath6 the @xmath4-ray effect in resistivity falls off quickly .",
    "in particular , at @xmath103  k a mere 4% increase in resistivity by @xmath4-rays was found , whereas above 200 k hardly any radiation effect in resistivity can be detected .",
    "this suggests that @xmath4-rays affect primarily the superconducting properties of the sample studied while electron transport in normal state remains actually not affected .    in the course of explaining of the results obtained , it should be taken into account , first of all , that the sample studied is polycrystalline or , better to say , granular .",
    "indeed , its resistivity in normal state just above the superconducting transition ( about 2.5 m@xmath104  cm , as can be seen in figs . 1 and 2 ) is by a factor of 50 larger than that of the best quality optimally doped ybco single - crystals ( about 50 @xmath105  cm@xcite ) .",
    "the increased resistivity comes from grain boundaries , since regions of grain boundaries in htscs can be poor conductive and even dielectric@xcite .",
    "the conductivity of granular metals in normal state is determined by tunneling of single - particle excitations ( unpaired electrons ) through the boundaries . in superconducting state the superconducting coherence between grains",
    "can be established by josephson coupling . although the sample studied is inhomogeneous ( granular ) its critical temperature @xmath106  k corresponds to the highest @xmath6 values in the good - quality ybco single crystals@xcite",
    "such situation is quite possible and understandable for inhomogeneous systems@xcite .",
    "granular metals usually have a spatial distribution of thicknesses of the poor - conductive or dielectric grain boundaries .",
    "this spread in the boundary thickness may be very important for transpor properties , especially for dielectric grain boundaries because in this case the probability of tunneling is an exponential function of dielectric separation distance .",
    "from this follows that granular metals are actually percolating systems@xcite . in such systems conductivity can be determined by the presence of optimal `` chains '' of grains with maximal probability of tunneling for adjacent pairs of grains forming the chain .",
    "the same type of percolation picture is true for a system of metallic grains with josephson coupling between them ( when grains become superconducting at low enough temperature)@xcite .",
    "the sample studied consists of rather large ( 12 @xmath50 m ) grains with critical temperature @xmath6 as high as that of in high - quality crystals .",
    "the global critical temperature of whole sample can be very close to this maximal value in the presence of good conducting optimal chains of grains with strong josephson coupling ( in utmost case , theoretically , even one such path will be enough to arrive to zero resistance ) .",
    "since conductivity of the granular metal is determined by both intragrain and intergrain transport properties , the influence of radiation damage in it should be considered separately for materials of grains and regions of grain boundaries .",
    "let us consider at first a question : is the radiation damage induced by @xmath4-ray in this study high enough to cause quite significant variations in resistivity and superconducting properties of material of grains .",
    "for this purpose , we have estimated the possible values of dpa in sample studied using the calculated in sec .",
    "[ sect1 ] effective cross sections for atomic displacement by @xmath4-rays from @xmath5co source through the compton effect ( table  [ table1 ] ) .",
    "it is easy to see that for the stardard value of @xmath107  ev the total dpa comprises very small value about @xmath108 .",
    "there is experimental evidence that the displacement energy , @xmath79 , for oxygen in cuo@xmath0 planes in ybco is close to 10 ev@xcite . in this case",
    "the dpa will be about @xmath109 . from the general point of view",
    "( taking into account the rather high charge - carrier density in optimally doped ybco ) it should not be expected any significant variations in normal state resistivity and @xmath6 in grains at such small radiation damage .",
    "indeed , the known experimental studies of single - crystal htscs irradiated with electrons or ions show that an appreciable influence of disorder on resistivity and @xmath6 can be detected only at dpa greater than @xmath110@xcite .",
    "it follows from the above consideration that with commonly used @xmath4-ray doses ( @xmath111  mr ) one should not expect any detectable variations in resistivity and @xmath6 in fairly homogeneous single - crystal htsc as well as in metallic grains of polycrystalline htsc .",
    "for this reason we will not consider here the numerous theoretical models of disorder influence on superconducting properties of htscs ( see refs .   and references therein ) which were developed for homogeneous superconductors . in this study",
    "we have not seen any marked changes even in the normal state resistivity of the polycrystalline sample .",
    "but we observed the pronounced effect of @xmath4-rays on @xmath6 and the width of resistive transition ( figs . 2 - 4 ) .",
    "this is undoubtedly connected with influence of @xmath4-rays on poor conductive or dielectic regions of grain boundaries and , therefore , on the superconducting phase coherence between the grains .",
    "one of the first impressive demonstration of radiation - induced destruction of phase coherence of the superconducting wave functions between grains in polycrystalline htsc was demonstrated in ref .",
    "for optimally doped ybco .",
    "they found that zero - resistance temperature @xmath96 was very sensitive to even low doses of irradiation with 500 kev oxygen . at the same time , the onset temperature @xmath98 declined much slowly .",
    "for doses , where @xmath96 was already close to zero , and furthermore , even , when insulating behavior of @xmath54 was evident below 40 k , @xmath98 was close to 80 k ( before irradiation @xmath98 was 97 k , and @xmath96 was 87 k ) .",
    "the authors of ref .   have assumed that @xmath98 in this case reflects the behavior of intrinsic critical temperature of grains , which is not as sensitive to irradiation as that of the whole granular system .    in the years , following ref .",
    ", the quality of htscs becomes much higher and the most of subsequent radiation studies were devoted to single - crystal ( or , at least , nearly single crystal ) htscs , which are usually far more homogeneous than polycrystalline samples , and for which , therefore , the phase coherence is not of decisive importance .",
    "it is certain , however , that not only single crystal htsc products may be ( or will be ) used in advanced technology .",
    "therefore inhomogeneity effect in superconductivity of these compound are still of fundamental and tecnological importance .",
    "it can be said with confidence that the observed decrease in @xmath6 and zero - resistance temperature @xmath96 combined with simultaneous increase in width of resistive transition @xmath11 in sample studied at low dose ( @xmath112  mr ) ( figs . 3 and 4 ) is quite expected for percolating granular system .",
    "optimal current paths , which have ensured the measured @xmath6 value about 93 k before irradiation , have sure some `` weak '' links .",
    "these are the grain boundaries , which are strongly enough depleted with charge carriers and , therefore , are sensitive even to such small mean radiation damage as in this study ( maximum @xmath113 dpa ) .",
    "this leads to the observed decrease in the `` global '' @xmath6 and increase in @xmath11 ( figs . 3 and 4 ) .",
    "the initial @xmath114 drop ( which appears to be explicable ) is followed by an increase in @xmath114 at higher dose @xmath115  mr ( fig .",
    "3 ) , and this is fairly surprising .",
    "this means that some concurrent mechanism , which causes an increase in @xmath114 , comes into play .",
    "this mechanism shows itself only in the limited range of doses , since @xmath114 decreases again in the range above @xmath116  mr ( fig .",
    "somehow this mechanism should be also associated with an impact of @xmath4-rays on intergrain josephson coupling .",
    "there are known some cases of superconductivity enhancement in polycrystalline htscs under irradiation .",
    "for example , an increase in @xmath114 after low - dose irradiation with si ions was observed in polycrystalline ybco@xcite .",
    "explanations of the effect in ref . was not however connected with granular structure of sample . in ref .",
    "it was reported that @xmath4-irradiation of granular tl@xmath0ba@xmath0ca@xmath0cu@xmath1o@xmath117 at room temperature causes the increase of critical current .",
    "this is believed to be an indication of strengthening of the intergrain josephson coupling under @xmath4-ray influence .",
    "the known features of interaction of @xmath4-rays with solids@xcite make it possible to suggest some mechanisms of @xmath114 increasing in granular htscs at low enough @xmath4-ray doses . in doing so",
    "two main points should be considered : ( i ) the nature of grain boundaries in htscs , ( ii ) the ionizing influence of @xmath4-rays . from the literature data ( see refs . and refs . therein ) it can be concluded that grain boundaries in htscs are disordered and oxygen deficient regions .",
    "a typical grain - boundary width in ybco is about 2  nm@xcite ( what encompasses about 10 atomic distances ) .",
    "it is known that @xmath114 of oxygen deficient ybco compounds increases considerably with illumination of visible light .",
    "it was found that light leads to a change in doping ( increasing in charge carrier density ) .",
    "this photoexcited state is persistent up to 250 - 270 k@xcite .",
    "the photodoping effect is negligible for optimally doped ybco .",
    "all existing models of the effect are based on the suggestion that sample illumination generates electron - hole pairs in the cuo@xmath30 planes .",
    "electrons are transferred to the cuo chains and trapped there , while holes remain mobile in the cuo@xmath30 planes .",
    "the most important effect of @xmath4-rays in solids is ionization . in primary collision of @xmath4-quantum with an atom of solid",
    "the compton electron and photon with lesser energy are produced .",
    "the energy of secondary photon is dissipated in causing further ionization .",
    "the same is true for the most of the energy of compton electrons ( only occasionally they displace atoms by elastic collision ) .",
    "therefore , the number of ionized atoms at @xmath4-irradiation is by several orders of magnitude larger than the number of displaced atoms . in this connection",
    "it must not be ruled out that effects like the above - mentioned photodoping by visible light@xcite take place in @xmath4-irradiated bulk samples as well .",
    "of course , there is a significant difference in the energy of @xmath4-ray and visible light photons .",
    "the visible light can eject only electrons from outer orbitals .",
    "these low energy electrons are trapped in nearby sites like cuo chains . by contrast",
    ", @xmath4-quantum can struck out any electron from an atom .",
    "but in this case the ejected elecrons have much higher energy and , therefore , can be brought far away from initial place .",
    "if electrons are ejected from cuo@xmath30 planes in oxygen depleted grain boundary regions , this should increase the charge carrier density in the planes and , therefore , enhance the josephson coupling between adjacent grains .",
    "if this takes place in some of `` weak '' links in optimal current path , this will result in increasing of measured @xmath114 .",
    "of course , the recombination of the electrons with excess holes should bring the charge carrier density in grain boundaries to an initial level .",
    "but some of these electrons should be sure trapped in remote defect places of crystal lattice like impurities , lattice distortions regions , including grain boundaries as well .",
    "if room temperature is not high enough for the electron - hole recombination of trapped electrons , this can lead to the observed effect of @xmath114 enhancement in some intermediate dose range . at higher doses , however , influence of radiation defects ( displaced atoms ) in grain boundaries overpowers the ionizing effect of @xmath4-rays that results in @xmath114 decreasing .",
    "needless to say that our explanation should not be considered as a conclusive .",
    "it needs an independent theoretical and experimental confirmation .",
    "we have found non - monotonic behavior of @xmath114 in optimally doped polycrystalline ybco with increasing @xmath4-ray irradiation dose .",
    "this result can be explained primarily by the influence of @xmath4-rays on intergrain josephson coupling .",
    "the two kinds of such influence are discussed .",
    "the first is the producing of displaced atoms , and the second is the ionizing influence of @xmath4-rays .    corresponding author , e - mail : belevtsev@ilt.kharkov.ua p. w. anderson , j. phys .",
