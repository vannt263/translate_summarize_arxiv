    "( 2001 ) and axenides & perivolaropoulos ( 2002 ) had already suggested on the basis of simple dynamical arguments that dark energy could appear as a cooler of peculiar motions in the local group environment . what is the expected trend as the constant @xmath16 in the equation of state of dark energy changes ?    a first fundamental difference between the quintessence and the @xmath1 ( @xmath26 ) models is the epoch at which dark energy dominates over the gravitational attraction of the matter .",
    "the expansion of a flat universe with dark energy is governed by the friedmann equation @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the scale factor .",
    "the dark energy term dominates over the gravitational attraction of the matter at redshifts lower than @xmath29 : @xmath30 for @xmath26 , this gives @xmath31 and for @xmath2 @xmath32 .",
    "it has been argued from linear perturbation theory that dark energy has little effect on the local dynamics ( lahav et al .",
    "1991 , wang & steinhardt 1998 ) . in linear perturbation theory ,",
    "the peculiar velocity field associated with a spherical mass concentration with density contrast @xmath33 averaged over proper radius @xmath23 is @xmath34 , where @xmath35 ; @xmath36 with @xmath37 ( peebles 1980 ) .",
    "wang & steinhardt ( 1998 ) have provided an approximation to @xmath38 in quintessence models , which showed that the difference between the linear peculiar velocities in models with different @xmath16 is negligible , as the growth factor depends mainly on @xmath39 and dark energy dominates only at late times .",
    "however , it has been later recognized that peculiar velocities can be cooled locally for galaxies located in a `` dark energy dominated zone '' ( baryshev et al .",
    "2001 ) . considering a shell enclosing a mass @xmath40 evolving in an expanding background",
    ", one can calculate a  zero - mass \" radius beyond which the dark energy dominates over the gravitational attraction of the matter ( @xmath41 ) .",
    "the equation of motion of the shell is : @xmath42 baryshev et al .",
    "( 2001 ) have argued that peculiar velocities are cooled adiabatically for galaxies situated beyond the zero - mass surface , where dark energy dominates the dynamics . for @xmath26 ,",
    "the zero - mass radius is independent of the redshift : @xmath43 using @xmath44  m@xmath45 for the local group ( van den bergh 1999 ) and our adopted cosmological parameters . for @xmath46",
    ", we have @xmath47    for @xmath48 ( which is equivalent to an open model with the same matter energy content ) , @xmath49 . for @xmath2 , @xmath50 .",
    "this gives @xmath51  mpc .",
    "note that the relative importance of dark energy on the dynamics of galaxies around a mass concentration varies in time , depending on the local density contrast .",
    "the zero - mass radius is larger around high - density regions , and for a given region it increases with cosmic time .",
    "so a galaxy which is now close to the local group and within the matter dominated zone could have been in the dark energy dominated zone in the past ( even if the dynamics of the universe as a whole was not dark energy dominated ) and have had its peculiar velocity cooled during a period of time .",
    "numerical simulations make it possible to see the integrated effect of the dynamical evolution of galaxies around concentrations of mass , which can not be calculated easily analytically as galaxies could move in and out of dark energy dominated zones .",
    "if a galaxy has been in the dark energy dominated zone at @xmath52 from redshift @xmath29 until now , then its peculiar velocity will have cooled adiabatically : @xmath53 as an upper limit for the peculiar velocity , one can take the hubble expansion velocity @xmath54 : @xmath55 for @xmath26 , one obtains @xmath56 for @xmath2 one has @xmath57 this upper limit on the peculiar velocity is lower by about 9% in the quintessence model with @xmath2 than in the cosmological constant case .    as pointed out by baryshev et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , when @xmath58 both linear modes are decaying ( the second , usually growing mode , decays as @xmath59 for @xmath60 ) . both density perturbations and peculiar velocities decay .",
    "the lower the value of @xmath16 the faster is the decay , so we would expect to have a colder hubble flow in the @xmath1cdm model than in the qcdm one , compensating for the earlier dominance of de that we have in models with @xmath61 .",
    "these two contrary effects make hard to predict which dark energy model will present a colder hubble flow in a given environment .",
    "the only way to test this scenario is via numerical simulations , that we will present in the next section .    in cosmologies with no dark energy component like the open cdm model ( equivalent to @xmath48 ) , the zero - mass surface",
    "is pushed to infinity and there are no decaying modes so peculiar velocities ca nt be cooled , which is consistent with the high peculiar velocities seen in simulation of the ocdm model by governato et al .",
    "( 1997 ) .",
    "finally , axenides & perivolaropoulos ( 2002 ) have calculated the growth suppression factor of velocity fluctuations in a dark energy model compared to the einstein - de sitter model and concluded that the presence of dark energy is not sufficient to explain the coldness of the local flow .",
    "however , this holds true for cosmological models with different @xmath16 _ and _ the same high redshift normalization of the density field perturbations",
    ". however , realistic models must be normalized to match the observed value of @xmath62 at @xmath63 .    from the above analysis it seems plausible that cosmologies with a dark energy component would present colder flows around cosmic haloes .",
    "however the magnitude of this effect , the dependence on @xmath16 and on the local properties of the density field remain poorly constrained by simple analytical arguments based on linear extrapolations .",

    "nevertheless we have used this value for @xmath16 in order to try to maximize the influence of dark energy on @xmath3 ( so it will be used as a limiting case ) . according to theoretical expectation ( baryshev et al .",
    "( 2001 ) and section [ sec : theo ] ) the strength of this effect depends on the epoch when the de becomes the dominant component of the universe : the earlier the de period begins , the stronger the cooling . in our qcdm model",

    "hence , as a cure to the above mentioned problem a wdm rather than cdm component reduces the amount of density fluctuation and subgalactic scale and may prove useful in cooling the hubble flow around the local group . to boost its possible effects we used for the mass of the wdm a value of 2  kev ,",

    "( 2003a ) obtained a cold hubble flow around a simulated region that replicated the mass distribution inferred from a redshift survey of the local universe .",
    "their simulation assumed a @xmath1cdm cosmology .",
    "their work was based on one constrained simulation of our local environment , our lg samples were selected using some simple selection environment criteria like the absence of nearby massive groups or the presence of a rich cluster within 512  mpc .",
    "however , no substantial difference was found between the typical @xmath3 in the different subsamples depending on the presence of nearby clusters .    to further test the hypothesis that a special local mass distribution is necessary for a cold hubble flow",
    ", we repeated our analysis for a much larger sample of milky way ( mw ) sized field haloes , with no special selection criteria .",
    "results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : all ] .",
    "a generic sample of mw - sized field haloes shows values of @xmath3 in the correct range if the local environment density is around average .",
    "this shows that the local group environment and details of its mass distribution are not special in any significant way and that in de - dominated cosmologies a small @xmath3 is a general characteristic of the environment around field galaxies .",
    "observational evidence at large and intermediate scale points to a flat , @xmath1-dominated cdm universe .",
    "the coldness of the hubble flow provides another , independent test at intermediate scales , where different kinds of dark matter and energy could play a significant role in shaping the local dynamics .    in this paper",
    "we have tested the predictions from cosmological models now strongly supported by observational evidence against a new , robust estimate of the local group @xmath3 in spheres of increasing radius up to 10  mpc based on a sample of nearby galaxies .",
    "we have shown that simulations are able to successfully reproduce the observed cold hubble flow around field galaxies only in a flat , de ( @xmath99 ) dominated cosmology and only in environments where the local density measured on a scale of a few mpc is close to the average one .",
    "the inclusion of a warm dark matter component does not change this result significantly , as removal of small - scale power does not play a major role .",
    "we have also shown that @xmath61 ( quintessence models ) where the era dominated by dark energy begins earlier , produce an hubble flow marginally colder than @xmath1cdm .",
    "this is in agreement with the theoretical expectation ( see section [ sec : theo ] and also baryshev et al .",
    "2001 , chernin et al . 2004 ) that the coldness of the local hubble flow follows from the fact that a galaxy s peculiar velocity decreases via adiabatic cooling if it spends a sufficient time in the dark energy dominated region where linear perturbations decay .",
    "the presence of a dark energy field is then the key ingredient to explain the observed coldness of the local hubble flow .    while the right cosmology and environmental density are crucial , the local dynamical criteria do not single out the lg from the generic population of field galaxies .",
    "a cold hubble flow around milky way sized galaxies is equally common as in our lg subsample .",
    "this implies that the details of the mass distribution in our local environment , like the vicinity to larger clusters and/or voids and filamentary structures , do not play a major role in shaping its velocity field .",
    "the environment of our local group provides a new , independent evidence for the existence of dark energy on scales of just few mpcs , corroborating the evidence gathered from observations of distant objects and the early universe .",
    "the authors thank jeff gardner for the use of his so halo finder and anatoly klypin for the use of the art code for the qcdm run .",
    "we also thank tom quinn , ben moore , joachim stadel , james wadsley and vandana desai for useful discussions .",
