    "precision spectroscopy of hyperfine structure in the @xmath3 lines of alkali atoms has been facilitated by the advent of tunable diode lasers and atomic vapor cells with high density @xcite .",
    "in particular , rb has been used for pioneering experiments in laser cooling and bose - einstein condensation @xcite , using diode lasers .",
    "many experiments in quantum optics have also been made possible because of the same advantages @xcite . in all these kinds of experiments ,",
    "the laser needs to be locked to a particular hyperfine transition .",
    "rb has two isotopes : @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "there are precise measurements of hyperfine structure in the d lines of the two isotopes reported in the literature",
    ". while the different measurements in the @xmath6 lines are consistent with each other , the one in the @xmath0 lines are discrepant .",
    "the two discrepant values are from refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite , respectively ; this suggests the need for further precise measurements . in an effort to resolve this discrepancy ,",
    "a group in australia has used a frequency comb and laser cooling for spectroscopy on the @xmath0 line of rb @xcite .",
    "the use of laser - cooled atoms avoids errors due to saturated absorption spectroscopy used in the other two measurements .",
    "they find results consistent with that in ref .",
    "@xcite and inconsistent with our work .    in this work ,",
    "we have repeated measurements of hyperfine structure using a different technique  one that does not involve locking the laser but rather scanning around a particular transition .",
    "this is advantageous because the lock point of the laser is not always at the peak center : due to electronics noise , acoustic noise , thermal fluctuations , and other sources of noise in the experiment .",
    "the scan axis of the diode laser for spectroscopy is calibrated using an acousto - optic modulator ( aom ) .",
    "the value of @xmath2 mhz in @xmath7 is again consistent with the value of @xmath8 mhz in ref .",
    "@xcite , showing that our earlier measurements had unaccounted systematic errors .",
    "the experimental setup is shown schematically in fig .  [",
    "fig : rb_schematic ] . the basic idea is to have two saturated absorption spectrometers ( sas ) , one of which is up - shifted using an acousto - optic modulator ( aom ) .",
    "the aom shift is close to the hyperfine interval to be measured .",
    "the laser is scanned over a wide - enough range to cover the peaks of interest .",
    "both sas spectra are made doppler free by subtracting the signal from a second identical probe beam whose absorption is not saturated by a pump beam .      half wave retardation plate ; pbs  polarizing beam splitter cube ; l  lens ; aom  acousto - optic modulator ; m  mirror ; bs  beam splitter ; pd  photodiode . ]",
    "the laser is a home - built grating - stabilized diode laser , as described in ref .",
    ". the free running wavelength of the diode is close to 795 nm , and its total power before feedback is 150 mw .",
    "the grating used for feedback has 1800 lines / mm , and is mounted on a piezo electric transducer ( pzt ) so that the laser frequency can be scanned electronically .",
    "the beam coming out of the laser is elliptic with @xmath9 diameter of @xmath10 mm .",
    "the probe power in each sas spectrometer is about 100 w , while the pump power is @xmath11 higher .",
    "thus , the maximum intensity at the center of the probe beam is 1.82 @xmath12 , which is roughly equal to the saturation intensity of 1.64 @xmath12 .",
    "the rf frequency of the aom driver is set by an external frequency generator ( hp 8656b ) with a timebase accuracy of @xmath13 .",
    "typical spectra from the two sas spectrometers for @xmath14 transitions are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : rb_spectra ] .",
    "the linewidth of each peak is 1820 mhz , which is larger than the 6 mhz natural linewidth , but is typical in sas spectra and arises due to power broadening by the pump beam and a small misalignment angle between the pump / probe beams .",
    "the spectra are shown for an aom shift of 400 mhz .",
    "since the interval to be measured is the one between the @xmath15 peak and the @xmath16 crossover resonance ( around 408 mhz ) , the aom shift is varied from 350 to 450 mhz in steps of 10 mhz .",
    "the experimental method consists of measuring the interval between the @xmath15 peak and the @xmath17 shifted crossover resonance as a function of aom frequency .",
    "the measured values are then fitted to a polynomial of order 2 or more , in order to account for any nonlinearities in the laser scan axis .",
    "the interval is the aom frequency at which the separation becomes zero .",
    "note that any error in the scaling of the scan axis will not show up as an error in the measurement of the interval , because it will only cause a rescaling of the peak separation .",
    "transitions in @xmath18 .",
    "each peak is labeled with the corresponding value of @xmath19 , and the crossover resonance in between with both values .",
    "the upper spectrum is obtained with an aom shift of 400 mhz . ]",
    "the results of measurements on the @xmath20 state of @xmath21 are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : hyp87rb ] .",
    "as explained before , errors in scaling the laser scan axis will change the @xmath22 axis of the figure but not the zero crossing .",
    "the error bar for each point is the addition of the errors in the two peaks whose separation is being determined .",
    "each peak is fitted to a lorentzian , and the error gives an idea of the signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) .",
    "we have also verified that the zero crossing of the fit remains unchanged ( within its error bar ) when we use higher polynomial orders than the second order shown in the figure  first order or linear is not correct because the scan axis is nonlinear , varying as the sin of the grating angle .",
    "peak and @xmath17 shifted crossover resonance , plotted as a function of aom shift .",
    "the solid line is a weighted 2nd order polynomial fit , weighed by the error bar for each point .",
    "the error bar is smaller than the symbol , and is hence not seen . ]",
    "the zero crossing of the polynomial fit along with its error yields a value of @xmath23 mhz .",
    "the different sources of error in the measurement , and our estimated value for each , are listed below .    1",
    ".   statistical error in the curve fit  250 khz .",
    "2 .   ac stark shift  10 khz .",
    "3 .   optical pumping into magnetic sublevels in the presence of stray magnetic fields ( zeeman shift )  10 khz .",
    "velocity redistribution of the atoms in the vapor cell due to radiation presence  5 khz .",
    "collisional shifts  5 khz . 6 .",
    "aom frequency timebase error  0.5 khz",
    "servo - loop errors in locking the laser  0 .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , the last source of error is 0 because we do not lock the laser .",
    "adding all the other sources of error in quadrature yields the final error in the measurement as 250.5 khz , showing that it is dominated by the error in the curve fit .",
    "thus , the value of the hyperfine constant measured in this work is @xmath24      previous measurements of this hyperfine constant are compared in fig .",
    "[ fig : a87rb ] .     in the @xmath25 state of @xmath26 measured in this work compared to earlier values .",
    "]    as seen , our present measurement is consistent with those in refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite , but completely inconsistent with that in ref .",
    "this suggests that the measurement in @xcite had unaccounted systematic errors .",
    "in summary , we have measured the hyperfine constant in the @xmath27 state ( @xmath28 line ) of @xmath1 , in an effort to resolve conflicting high - precision values reported in the literature .",
    "we use a different technique from the previous measurements  one in which the laser is not locked to a particular peak but scanned around it . the scan axis ( which is inherently nonlinear ) is calibrated using an aom . the final error is dominated by errors in the fit of the peak separation , and is not as small as the other two measurements .",
    "however , our present value is inconsistent with the earlier one from our group @xcite , showing that it had unaccounted systematic errors .",
    "we have also done measurements on the other isotope of rb , namely @xmath29 . here ,",
    "the values from refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite are not so discrepant ( difference of only @xmath30 ) . but",
    "the error in our present technique is so large that it can not resolve between the two .",
