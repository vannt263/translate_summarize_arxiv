    "ly@xmath0 absorption on the short wavelength side of ly@xmath0 emission in qso spectra with high redshift indicates the presence of neutral hydrogen ( hi ) along the line of sight . the low column density ( @xmath2 to @xmath3 @xmath4 )",
    "hi absorption is believed to be due to diffusely distributed intergalactic medium ( igm ) .",
    "the igm mass field is passive with respect to the dark matter present in the sense that its gravitational clustering is dominated by the gravity of dark matter .",
    "the igm is assumed to be a good tracer of the underlying mass density distribution on scales larger than the thermal diffusion or jeans length in the linear or even the nonlinear regime ( bi , 1993 ; fang et al .",
    "1993 ; hui , & gnedin 1997 ; nusser , & haehnelt 1999 ) .",
    "the statistical features of the qso ly@xmath0 transmitted flux can be used to estimate the corresponding features of the underlying mass field .",
    "consequently , the power spectrum of the transmitted flux fluctuations of high redshift qsos ly@xmath0 absorption spectrum has been extensively used for reconstructing the initially linear perturbations of the cosmic mass and velocity fields and discriminating among models of structure formation ( bi , ge , & fang 1995 ; bi , & davidsen 1997 ; croft et al . 1999 , 2002 ;",
    "feng , & fang 2000 ; mcdonald et al 2000 ; pando , feng & fang 2001 ; zhan , & fang 2002 ) .",
    "therefore , it is necessary to study the effects of the non - gaussian features of the flux field upon the detection of the power spectrum of this field , and its error estimation . in this paper",
    ", we will focus on the effects of intermittency of the qso ly@xmath0 transmitted flux on the power spectrum estimation .",
    "the first indication of intermittency arises from the success of the lognormal model in explaining the qso ly@xmath0 forests ( bi 1993 ; bi , & davidsen 1997 ) as a lognormal field typically is intermittent . to approximately describe the evolution of the igm by a stochastic burgers equation , the igm mass and velocity fields are found to be lognormal or intermittent ( jones , 1999 ; matarrese , & mohayaee 2002 ) .",
    "intermittency has been detected with high resolution , high signal to noise ratio ( s / n ) samples of qso ly@xmath0 absorption spectra ( jamkhedkar , zhan , & fang 2000 ; feng , pando , & fang 2001 ; zhan , jamkhedkar , & fang 2001 ; jamkhedkar 2002 ) .",
    "recently , the intermittent features have been further examined by measuring the structure function and intermittent exponent of 28 keck hires qso spectra ( pando et al .",
    "this work shows that the intermittent behaviour is significant on scales @xmath5 s / km .",
    "a basic characteristic of an intermittent field is that the power of the fluctuations of the flux field is concentrated in rare spikes which are randomly and widely scattered in space , with low power between the spikes . in this case , the power spectrum of an intermittent field is dominated by rare and improbable events ( spikes ) . in other words ,",
    "only a small fraction of the total modes contribute to the power while most are inactive .",
    "although an intermittent field is statistically homogeneous , the rare events lead to significant differences among samples from different parts of the universe when the spatial size of the region is not large enough to contain numerous spikes .",
    "mathematically , this makes the central limit theorem less effective .",
    "all these imply that the uncertainty in the power spectrum is directly related to the intermittency of the field .    using the same samples studied by pando et al .",
    "( 2002 ) , we will investigate the uncertainty of the power spectrum of qso ly@xmath0 transmitted flux fluctuations .",
    "the paper is organised as follows .",
    " 2 briefly introduces the basic properties of an intermittent field .  3 presents our algorithm for calculating the power spectra with the discrete wavelet transform ( dwt ) . ",
    "4 describes the samples used for analysis .",
    " 5 discusses the basic properties of the dwt power spectrum of the samples .  6 addresses the effect of the intermittent behaviour upon the power spectrum . finally ,  7 summarises the results and conclusions .",
    "most of this section has been presented in our previous work ( pando et al 2002 ) .",
    "for the paper to be self - contained , we repeat these results very briefly . the principal characteristic of an intermittent random field , like ly@xmath0 transmitted flux @xmath6 , is measured by the asymptotic behaviour of the ratio between the high- and low - order moments of the field defined as @xmath7^{2n}\\rangle } { [ \\langle [ f ( { x + r})- f ( { x})]^2\\rangle]^n } \\asymp\\left \\langle \\frac{r}{l } \\right \\rangle^{\\zeta},\\ ] ] where @xmath8 is the average over the ensemble of fields , and @xmath9 is the size of the sample .",
    "( 1 ) can be rewritten as @xmath10^n } \\propto     \\left(\\frac{r}{l } \\right ) ^{\\zeta},\\ ] ] where @xmath11 is the structure function defined by @xmath12 here @xmath13 .",
    "@xmath11 is the @xmath14 moment of the fluctuations of the field .",
    "therefore , the ratio in eq .",
    "( 2 ) is the @xmath14 moment @xmath15 normalised by the @xmath16 power of the @xmath17 moment , or power , @xmath18 .",
    "a field is intermittent if the exponent @xmath19 is negative on small scales @xmath20 ( grtner , & molchanov , 1990 ; zeldovich , ruzmaikin , & sokoloff , 1990 ) .",
    "intermittency is measured by the @xmath21- and @xmath20-dependencies of @xmath19 . for a gaussian field ,",
    "@xmath10^n } = ( 2n-1)!!.\\ ] ] this ratio is independent of the scale @xmath20 , and therefore , the intermittent exponent @xmath22 .",
    "thus , a gaussian field is not intermittent .",
    "moreover , not all non - gaussian fields are intermittent . only fields , for which the ratio in eq .",
    "( 1 ) diverges as @xmath23 , are intermittent .    for a lognormal field ,",
    "the probability distribution function ( pdf ) of @xmath24 is @xmath25 = \\frac{1}{2^{1/2}\\pi^{1/2}\\delta^2_r(x)\\sigma(r ) }   \\exp\\left \\ { -\\frac{1}{2 } \\left ( \\frac { \\ln\\delta^2_r(x)-\\ln \\delta^2_r(x)_m } { \\sigma(r)}\\right)^2   \\right \\},\\ ] ] where @xmath26 is the _",
    "median _ of @xmath24 ( vanmarcke 1983 ) .",
    "the variance @xmath27 of @xmath28 may be a function of the scale @xmath20 .",
    "using eq .",
    "( 5 ) , we have @xmath10^n } = e^{(n^2-n)\\sigma^2(r)/2}.\\ ] ] the intermittent exponent of a lognormal field is then @xmath29 because @xmath30 , @xmath19 is negative .",
    "therefore , a lognormal field is intermittent .    in comparison with the gaussian result ( eq .  ( 4 ) ) , the ratio of eq .  ( 6 ) increases faster with @xmath21",
    "this is due to the fact that a lognormal pdf is long - tailed .",
    "long - tailed pdf is a common property of intermittent fields .",
    "the property of @xmath31^n$ ] on small scales indicates that the field contains `` abnormal '' events of large density fluctuations @xmath32 .",
    "the events of big @xmath33 correspond to a sharp increase or decrease of the field , and constitute the long - tail of the pdf of @xmath33 .",
    "the transmitted flux of a qso absorption spectrum is given by @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is the continuum , @xmath36 the transmission , and @xmath37 the opacity . since the observed data (  4 )",
    "is already reduced by a continuum fitting , we have @xmath38 where the term @xmath39 describes the stochastic noise including the poisson noise of photon count .",
    "it satisfies the statistical properties @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the kronecker delta function .",
    "the ensemble average is over the density fluctuations .",
    "therefore , we have @xmath42 . generally speaking ,",
    "@xmath43 is still position - dependent , as it depends on the photoionization rate of hi , and the temperature of the igm .",
    "moreover , for a given scale @xmath20 , all fluctuations on scales larger than @xmath20 around the position @xmath44 act as a background for this fluctuation .",
    "this leads to a position dependent background .",
    "if one can assume that @xmath43 is a constant , then we have @xmath45 , which is the mean transmission .    the field of ly@xmath0 transmitted flux fluctuations",
    "are defined by @xmath46 or @xmath47 @xmath48 and @xmath49 are different by a normalisation factor @xmath43 . if @xmath43 is @xmath44-independent , the unnormalised and normalised fields @xmath48 and @xmath49 differ only by a constant .",
    "if @xmath50 does nt contain small scale fluctuations , then one still can treat @xmath50 as a constant when studying the fields on small scales .      in order to easily illustrate the effect of intermittency on the power spectrum , we calculate the power spectrum of ly@xmath0 transmitted flux with the discrete wavelet transform ( dwt ) .",
    "we use @xmath51 and @xmath52 to denote the spatial range of a flux field corresponding to the wavelength range from @xmath53 and @xmath54 . to implement a dwt scale - space decomposition of a flux field @xmath55 , we first chop the spatial range @xmath56 of the 1-d sample into @xmath57 subintervals labelled with @xmath58 .",
    "each subinterval spans a spatial range @xmath59 .",
    "the subinterval @xmath60 is from @xmath61 to @xmath62 .",
    "the index @xmath63 can be an integer .",
    "thus , we decompose the space @xmath9 into cells @xmath64 , where @xmath63 denotes the scale @xmath59 , and @xmath60 the spatial range @xmath65 $ ] .    corresponding to each cell ( or mode ) @xmath64",
    ", there is a scaling function @xmath66 , and a wavelet function @xmath67 , which are the orthogonal and complete basis for the scale - space decomposition .",
    "the most important property of the dwt basis is its locality in both scale and physical ( or redshift ) spaces .",
    "the scaling function @xmath66 is a window function on scale @xmath63 and at the position @xmath60 .",
    "the wavelet function @xmath67 is admissible ( daubechies 1992 ) , i.e. , @xmath68 .",
    "therefore , it measures the fluctuation on scale @xmath63 and at position @xmath60 .",
    "all wavelets with compactly supported bases will produce similar results .",
    "we will use daubechies 4 ( d4 ) basis below , for its ease in numerical calculations among the compactly supported orthogonal bases .",
    "the d4 scaling function @xmath66 , wavelet @xmath67 and their fourier transforms @xmath69 , @xmath70 are shown in yang et al ( 2001b ) .    subjecting a transmitted flux @xmath55 to the dwt , we have ( daubechies 1992 ; fang , & thews 1998 ) @xmath71 where @xmath72 is given by the finest scale ( pixel resolution ) of the sample , i.e. , @xmath73 and @xmath63 is the scale we want to study .",
    "the field now is described by dwt variables @xmath74 and @xmath75 , which are called scaling function coefficient ( sfc ) and wavelet function coefficient ( wfc ) , respectively .",
    "the sfc is given by projecting @xmath55 onto @xmath66 @xmath76 the sfc @xmath74 is proportional to the mean field at the mode @xmath64 .",
    "the wfc is obtained by projecting @xmath55 onto @xmath67 @xmath77 the wfc @xmath78 is basically the difference between @xmath55 and @xmath79 , where @xmath80 and @xmath81 .",
    "thus , the wfc can be used to replace the variable @xmath82 .",
    "( 3 ) can then be rewritten as @xmath83 if the `` fair sample hypothesis '' ( peebles 1980 ) holds , one can replace the ensemble average in eq .  (",
    "15 ) by a spatial average .",
    "we then have @xmath84      for a transmitted flux fluctuation field @xmath85 , the two point correlation function is defined by @xmath86 where @xmath87 .",
    "similarly , one can define a two point correlation function of the unnormalised field @xmath88 as @xmath89 the fourier counterparts of @xmath90 and @xmath91 are , respectively , the normalised and unnormalised power spectra , @xmath92 and @xmath93 .",
    "the algorithm of the power spectrum for both @xmath92 or @xmath93 in the dwt representation has been developed ( pando & fang 1998 ; fang , & feng 2000 ; yang et al .",
    "2001a , 2001b and jamkhedkar , bi , & fang 2001 ) .",
    "we will study only the unnormalised power spectrum @xmath93 below .",
    "if @xmath43 is constant , the normalised and unnormalised power spectra @xmath92 and @xmath93 differ only by a constant factor @xmath50 . in this case , all the results for @xmath93 also hold for @xmath92 .",
    "problems with @xmath92 caused by a non - constant @xmath43 will be discussed in the conclusions .",
    "the power spectrum in the dwt variables is given by @xmath94 the first term on the r.h.s .",
    "( 19 ) is the power of @xmath88 on scale @xmath63 . the second term on the r.h.s . of eq .",
    "( 19 ) is due to the noise given by @xmath95 comparing eq .",
    "( 19 ) with eq .",
    "( 16 ) , we have @xmath96 .",
    "therefore , the power spectrum actually is the second moment of the pdf of @xmath75 .",
    "it has been shown in general that the dwt power spectrum @xmath97 of a random field @xmath88 is related to the fourier power spectrum @xmath98 of the field as @xmath99 where @xmath21 is related to the wavenumber by @xmath100 .",
    "therefore , the dwt power @xmath97 is a banded fourier power spectrum . since for d4 wavelet @xmath101 has peak at @xmath102 , the band @xmath63 is around the wavenumber @xmath103 .",
    "the difference between the dwt mode @xmath64 and the fourier mode @xmath104 should be emphasised . for a given @xmath63 , the size of a cell ( mode )",
    "is @xmath59 , which corresponds to wavenumber @xmath105 .",
    "however , the wavelet function @xmath67 is localised within @xmath59 , and , therefore , the uncertainty relation @xmath106 gives @xmath107 .",
    "that is , a dwt mode with @xmath63 actually corresponds to a band of fourier modes @xmath108 , i.e. , the relevant band is @xmath109 .",
    "this banding is optimised in the sense that to detect small scale fluctuations ( larger wavenumber @xmath104 ) , the size of the pieces @xmath110 is chosen to be smaller , while to detect large scale fluctuations ( smaller wavenumber ) , the size of the pieces @xmath110 is chosen to be larger .",
    "we sometimes characterise a dwt scale @xmath63 by the fourier mode @xmath104 . in this case , the @xmath104 is given by the maximum @xmath111 of the fourier transform @xmath112 .",
    "the observational data used in our study consists of 28 keck hires qso spectra ( kirkman , & tytler 1997 ) .",
    "the qso emission redshifts cover a redshift range from 2.19 to 4.11 . for each of the 28 qsos ,",
    "the data are given in form of pixels ( @xmath113 ) with wavelength @xmath114 , flux @xmath115 and noise @xmath116 .",
    "the noise accounts for the poisson fluctuations in the photon count , the noise due to the background and the instrumentation .",
    "the continuum of each spectrum is given by iraf continuum fitting .",
    "for our purpose , the useful wavelength region is from the ly@xmath117 emission to the ly@xmath0 emission , excluding a region of about 0.06 in redshift close to the quasar to avoid any proximity effects . in this wavelength range ,",
    "the number of pixels of the data is about @xmath118 for each spectrum .",
    "1 shows the wavelength range for 30 qsos .",
    "since the data of q0241 - 0146 has about 44% and , q1330 + 0108 has about 27% pixels with s / n @xmath119 3 , we will not use these qsos in our analysis .",
    "we use only the 28 qso forest samples .    for each bin in this data set ,",
    "the ratio @xmath120 is constant , i.e. , @xmath121 , or @xmath122  km / s , and , therefore , the resolution is about 8 km / s . the distance between @xmath123 pixels in the units of the local velocity scale is given by @xmath124})$ ]  km / s , or wavenumber @xmath125 s / km . we use only @xmath126 pixels of each spectrum .",
    "thus , each cell on the dwt scale @xmath63 corresponds to @xmath127 pixels .",
    "this data set has been used for the fourier power spectrum analysis ( croft et al 1999 , 2002 ) .",
    "they concluded that on scales @xmath128  s / km the contamination of noise is small . in order to easily compare our results with the fourier analysis , we concentrate mainly on the dwt scales @xmath129 , or bin number @xmath130 , @xmath131  s / km , or @xmath132 .",
    "the samples are contaminated by metal lines .",
    "it is generally believed that metal lines are narrow with a doppler parameter @xmath133  km / s ( rauch , et al 1997 ; hu et al 1995 ) .",
    "we identified the big spikes on the scale @xmath134  s / km for the ten qsos ( q0014 + 8118 , q0054 - 2824 , q0636 + 6801 , q0642 + 4454 , q0940 - 1050 , q1017 + 1055 , q1103 + 6416 , q1422 + 2309 , q1425 + 6039 , q1759 + 7529 ) and checked if these are related to metal lines . to estimate the effect of metal lines , we compare the statistical results of metal - line - removed samples with those without removing metal lines .    in our analysis",
    ", we sometimes use the 28 qso transmissions individually , i.e.  calculate the statistics of the transmission over each qso separately , and sometimes all the transmissions are treated together . in the latter case , we divide the data into 12 redshift ranges from @xmath135 to 1.6 + @xmath136 0.20 where @xmath137 .",
    "all the transmission flux in a given redshift range forms an ensemble .",
    "note that the number of data points in each redshift range is different .",
    "the mean flux @xmath138 of these samples at @xmath139 is @xmath140 , and decreases to @xmath141 at @xmath142 . in each redshift range ,",
    "the dispersions of @xmath138 are about 10 - 15% .      before calculating the dwt power spectrum of observed data ,",
    "we discuss our method of treating unwanted data , including the pixels without data , contamination of metal lines , etc . on an average",
    "the s / n ratio of the keck spectra is high .",
    "the mean 1@xmath143 uncertainty in the flux values @xmath144 relative to the continuum @xmath145 in the ly@xmath0 forest region is 4% on an average ( croft et al 2002 ) . however , for some pixels , the @xmath146 is as low as about 1 , such as pixels with negative flux .",
    "most of these regions are saturated absorption regions .",
    "although the percentage of pixels within these regions is not large , they may introduce large uncertainties in the analysis .",
    "we must reduce the uncertainty given by low s / n pixels .    the conventional technique of reducing these uncertainties is eliminating the unwanted bins and smoothly rejoining the rest of the forest spectra .",
    "however , by taking advantage of the localisation of wavelets we can use the algorithm of dwt denoising by thresholding ( donoho 1995 ) as follows    1 .",
    "calculate the sfcs of both transmission @xmath55 and noise @xmath147 , i.e. @xmath148 2 .",
    "identify an unwanted mode @xmath64 using the threshold condition @xmath149 where @xmath150 is a constant .",
    "this condition flags all modes with s / n less than @xmath150 .",
    "we can also flag modes dominated by metal lines .",
    "since all the statistical quantities in the dwt representation are based on an average over the modes @xmath64 , we will skip all the flagged modes while computing these averages .",
    "therefore no rejoining and smoothing of the data are needed .",
    "we call this algorithm the conditional - counting method",
    ". it should be pointed out that condition eq .",
    "( 23 ) is applied on each scale @xmath63 , and therefore the unwanted modes are flagged on a scale - by - scale basis .",
    "if the size of an unwanted data segment is @xmath151 , condition eq .",
    "( 23 ) only flags modes @xmath64 on scales less than or comparable to @xmath151 .",
    "we also flag two modes around each unwanted mode to reduce any boundary effects of the unwanted chunks .",
    "since the dwt calculation assumes that the sample is periodized , this may cause uncertainty at the boundary of the sample . to reduce this effect , we drop five modes neighbouring the boundary of the sample . with this method",
    ", we can still calculate the power spectrum by the estimators of eq .",
    "( 19 ) , but the average is not over all modes @xmath60 , but over the un - flagged modes only .",
    "at the first glance , the conditional - counting condition eq .",
    "( 23 ) seems to preferentially drop modes in the low transmission regions , and may lead to an @xmath150-dependence of power spectrum . to test this problem",
    ", we calculate the power spectrum @xmath97 of q1700 + 6419 .",
    "the conditional - counting parameter @xmath150 is taken to be @xmath152 and 5 .",
    "the results of @xmath97 vs @xmath63 are shown in fig .  2 .",
    "2 shows that the power spectrum @xmath97 is independent of the parameter @xmath150 .",
    "for other samples , the results are also the same .",
    "the reason can be seen from eq .",
    "( 19 ) , which shows that the contribution to the power @xmath97 given by mode @xmath64 is @xmath153 .",
    "the noise subtraction term @xmath154 guarantees that the contribution of modes with small @xmath146 to @xmath97 is always small . for instance , the modes with negative flux , i.e. , the modes with flux having the same order of magnitude as noise , the two terms @xmath155 and @xmath154 cancel each other statistically .",
    "thus , in the range of @xmath156 , all the flagged modes always have very small or negligible contributions to @xmath97 . denoising by thresholding is reliable .",
    "the thresholding method checks variables mode by mode , and therefore , can only be effectively applied for a space - scale decomposed field .",
    "eq .  ( 19 ) can be rewritten as @xmath157 and @xmath158 where @xmath159 is the number of modes remaining after applying the denoising condition of eq .",
    "( 24 ) shows that the power spectrum @xmath97 is the average of local power @xmath160 . for a given @xmath60 ,",
    "the @xmath63-distribution of @xmath161 is the local power spectrum , i.e. , the power spectra in the spatial range of @xmath60 . for a given @xmath63 ,",
    "the @xmath60-distribution of @xmath161 is the spatial distribution of local power .",
    "the spatial distribution of local powers is very intuitive for the demonstration of intermittency .",
    "3 shows a typical spatial distribution of the local power of the transmitted flux .",
    "the left panels of fig .",
    "3 are @xmath162 for @xmath163 and 10 ( @xmath164 64 km / s and 32 km / s , respectively ) .",
    "the right panels represent the corresponding distribution of the phase - randomised ( pr ) data .",
    "the pr data are obtained by taking the inverse transform of the fourier coefficients of the original data after randomising their phases uniformly over @xmath165 $ ] without changing the amplitudes .",
    "this gives rise to a pr field with the same unnormalised power spectrum as the original field .",
    "the mean unnormalised powers of the left and the right panels of fig",
    ".  3 are actually the same .",
    "note that , in fig .",
    "3 large spikes corresponding to metal lines have been removed .",
    "two main features can be observed in fig .",
    "3 . first , the local power distributions of @xmath162 on @xmath163 and 10 ( left panels ) are significantly different from their counterparts of the pr sample ( right panels ) .",
    "the former show spiky structures , while the latter are noisy distributions .",
    "therefore , the spikiness arises completely from the phase correlation of the fourier modes .",
    "second , the spiky structures are more significant on smaller scales , or larger @xmath63 . that is , the ratio between the amplitudes of the spikes and the mean power is higher on smaller scales .",
    "although spikes correspond to a large difference in the flux @xmath166 , they are not always related to ly@xmath0 absorption lines or sharp edges of saturated regions .",
    "this is because the strength of spikes is measured by the ratio @xmath162 .",
    "2 shows that the mean power of transmission flux fluctuations on @xmath167 is about @xmath168 .",
    "thus , even for a spike as high as @xmath169 at @xmath167 , the flux difference is only @xmath170 , which is less than @xmath171 and does not require either @xmath172 or @xmath55 to equal zero .",
    "therefore , spikes are different from the ly@xmath0 absorption lines which correspond to valleys identified by a voigt profile fitting .    the difference between the spikes and ly@xmath0 absorption lines can also be seen from fig .  4 , which shows the local power @xmath160 on scale @xmath167 against the corresponding @xmath173 on scales @xmath167 and @xmath174 at the same physical position @xmath60 .",
    "since @xmath173 is the flux smoothed on scale @xmath63 , absorption lines having a width of the order of @xmath63 corresponds to @xmath175 .",
    "4 shows the modes with top 1 @xmath176 power among all modes of the 28 qsos combined .",
    "all these local powers @xmath160 are larger than 10@xmath97 , and therefore , they are spikes .",
    "one can see from fig",
    ".  4 that most spikes are not related to saturated regions with @xmath177 or @xmath178 .      by definition , spikes correspond to structures of large @xmath166 .",
    "a spiky field indicates the excess of large transmission fluctuations compared to a gaussian distribution .",
    "thus , the non - gaussianity of a spiky field can be described by the pdf or the one - point distribution of local power @xmath160 .    to calculate the pdf , we use the 12 redshift ranges of the samples mentioned in  4.1 . for each redshift range",
    ", we construct an ensemble consisting of all @xmath160 from the 28 qsos , for which the position @xmath60 is in the redshift ranges .",
    "5 plots the pdfs of @xmath179 on the scale @xmath167 in the 12 redshift ranges .    if the field @xmath88 is gaussian , the pdf of @xmath78 is also gaussian .",
    "thus , the pdf of @xmath180 should be a @xmath181 distribution , which is also plotted in fig .  5 ( solid line ) .",
    "comparing to the @xmath182-distribution , the pdfs of the keck data are generally higher at @xmath183 , lower at @xmath184 , and again higher at @xmath185 .",
    "that is , for most modes the local powers are low or close to zero , while rare modes have high power ( long - tail ) .    in fig .  5 , five of the 12 pdfs",
    "have tails as long as @xmath186 , and six have @xmath187 .",
    "the number of long - tails can not directly be used to measure the degree of the spikiness , as different pdfs of fig .  5 are given by different number of independent modes .",
    "nevertheless , it is clear that all the long - tail events have a much larger probability than a gaussian .",
    "6 shows the pdf of the local power @xmath179 in the redshift range @xmath188 on scales @xmath189 , 9 and 10 , with the parameter in eq .",
    "( 23 ) , f = 1 ( top ) , f = 3 ( middle ) and f = 5 ( bottom ) .",
    "we see from fig . 6",
    "that the observed pdf is independent of the parameter @xmath150 .",
    "the observed pdf of @xmath179 at @xmath189 is consistent with the @xmath190 distributions , but it is long - tailed for @xmath191 and 10 . at @xmath167 ,",
    "the long - tail is given by @xmath192 .",
    "a spike with @xmath193 corresponds to an event @xmath164 5.6@xmath143 . in fig .  6 , we use 2100 @xmath194 data points ( modes ) for the statistics on @xmath167 and @xmath195 , and",
    "therefore the observed probability of the 5.6@xmath143 event is about 4@xmath196 10@xmath197 .",
    "this is much larger than the gaussian probability of an 5.6@xmath143 event .",
    "in contrast to figs .  5 and 6 , fig .",
    "7 shows the pdf of @xmath179 for a pr sample .",
    "as expected the pr field follows the @xmath182-distribution on small scales ( @xmath198 ) .    some errors in figs .",
    "5 and 6 might be caused by the 10% dispersion of the mean flux (  4.1 ) . as each ensemble in a given redshift range",
    "contains local power modes @xmath160 from different qsos , which have different mean flux @xmath199 .",
    "however , this error will not change the intermittent features .",
    "this can be seen from fig .",
    "8 , which gives the pdf of @xmath200 for _ one _ sample q0014 + 8118 at @xmath167 .",
    "8 actually shows exactly the same features as in figs .  5 and 6 .",
    "moreover , fig .",
    "8 gives the distribution @xmath200 for the sample q0014 + 8118 with and without removing high spikes located in the regions contaminated by metal lines .",
    "the figure shows the existence of a long - tail regardless of whether the metal lines and metal line suspects are removed or not .",
    "other quasars searched for metal lines show similar results .",
    "therefore , the long - tail seems to be a permanent feature of the pdf of local power .",
    "it is not caused by noise or other contamination .",
    "to measure the long - tail we add a lognormal pdf in fig . 8 given by @xmath201 for this pdf , the mean of @xmath202 is always equal to 1 , i.e. , @xmath203 .",
    "the parameter @xmath204 measures the long tail .",
    "larger the @xmath204 , longer the tail .",
    "the best fitting to the observed long - tail is @xmath205 . the observed long - tail is longer than lognormal pdfs .",
    "the pdf of the flux field @xmath88 has a more prominent long - tail than a lognormal field .",
    "as shown by eq .  ( 24 ) , the power spectra , @xmath97 , are given by the mean of local powers over independent modes @xmath206 .",
    "when the spiky features are pronounced , the power of the transmission fluctuations is concentrated in the spikes , and therefore , a big fraction of the power in eq .",
    "( 24 ) actually is dominated by the spikes .    to demonstrate the spikiness",
    ", we calculate the power spectrum by averaging local power @xmath161 in the 12 redshift ranges .",
    "we also calculate the averages over 12 local power ensembles , but dropping the top 1% , 3% and 5% of the local power modes .",
    "we plot the ratio of power after dropping the highest modes to the power without dropping any modes .",
    "the result is shown in fig .",
    "one can see from fig .",
    "9 that for most cases , dropping the top 5% modes leads to a decrease in @xmath97 by a factor equal to or larger than 2 .",
    "that is , 50% or even more of the power is given by the top 5% modes .",
    "on scale @xmath167 , dropping the top 1% modes leads to a 20% or more decrease in @xmath97 .",
    "if the field were gaussian , a top 1% elimination of data would lead to a decrease in @xmath97 of no more than 3% , and a top 5% elimination would lead to a decrease of no more than 8% . therefore , fig .",
    "9 shows that the power spectrum is substantially dependent on the rare events  high spikes .",
    "the power is concentrated in the spikes . as a consequence ,",
    "the number of effective modes of the random field is significantly reduced , i.e. , only the rare modes contribute to the measurement of the power spectrum , while other modes are inactive .",
    "this will leads to uncertainty in the power spectrum .",
    "generally , the uncertainty in the power spectrum can be effectively reduced by increasing the number of independent modes of measurement . using the `` fair sample hypothesis '' ( peebles 1980 ) ,",
    "we first construct an ensemble of samples by dividing the observed sample into a set of @xmath123 subsamples .",
    "we then calculate the mean and variance over the ensemble .",
    "the precision of the power measurement would then be improved if the number @xmath123 is large , as the error is @xmath207 .",
    "if this is always true , then we should divide the sample into as many independent subsamples as possible .    to detect the power of ly@xmath0 transmitted flux fluctuations on the scale @xmath104 , the largest possible number @xmath123",
    "is given by the uncertainty relation @xmath208 .",
    "therefore , we should divide the 1-d flux field @xmath209 into segments with size @xmath210 . in this case ,",
    "the segment gives valuable information of the power in the band @xmath212 .",
    "this is just what the dwt does . the local power @xmath160 , given by dwt , provides the largest possible number of modes for detecting power in the band corresponding to @xmath104 .",
    "however the precision improvement factor @xmath213 is largely based on the central limit theorem .",
    "let us consider eq .",
    "( 24 ) to be a definition of the stochastic variables @xmath97 constructed from the stochastic variables @xmath160 .",
    "according to the central limit theorem if all @xmath160 are independent variables , having identical pdfs , then @xmath97 will approach a gaussian pdf when @xmath159 is large , regardless of the pdf of @xmath160 .",
    "actually , the convergence of @xmath97 to a gaussian variable is fast as @xmath159 increases .",
    "this result ensures that the error of power spectrum @xmath97 is basically proportional to the gaussian factor @xmath214 , even when the field is nonlinear and non - gaussian .",
    "yet , the central limit theorem does not work well with fields having a divergent ratio between its moments [ eqs.(1 ) or ( 2 ) ] .",
    "principally , a superposition of intermittent fields will also converge to a gaussian limit .",
    "the error will decrease as @xmath214 as required by the central limit theorem .",
    "however , this needs a large number @xmath159 .",
    "this is because the central limit theorem relies on the existence of a unique relationship between the pdf and moments ( vanmarcke 1983 ) .",
    "the pdf of a lognormal field is not uniquely determined by its moments ( crow , & shimizu 1988 ) .",
    "this leads to a very slow convergence of the pdf of @xmath215 to the limiting gaussian pdf as @xmath159 increases .",
    "the pdf of @xmath97 is still long tailed if the pdf of @xmath160 is long - tailed , like a lognormal field .",
    "the number @xmath159 needed for the convergence to a gaussian @xmath97 can be estimated by ( barakat , 1976 ) as , @xmath216 where @xmath217 is the skewness of the pdf eq .",
    "thus , for @xmath205 (  5.2 ) , we have @xmath218 .",
    "therefore , the central limit theorem is less effective for an intermittent field .",
    "for the pdf shown in fig .",
    "8 , the precision improvement factor @xmath213 would not work until @xmath159 is not large enough as required by eq .",
    "( 27 ) .    to demonstrate this property",
    ", we calculate the mean power and its 1-@xmath143 of q0014 + 8118 on the scale @xmath219 .",
    "the power is calculated by eq .",
    "( 24 ) , and the 1-@xmath143 by @xmath220^{1/2}\\ ] ] in the redshift range 2.7 - 3.12 , there are 397 local power modes @xmath160 available .",
    "these powers are independent in the sense that the cross correlations @xmath221 if @xmath222 ( pando , feng , & fang 2001 ) . however , the pdf of these @xmath160 are close to eq .",
    "the results are given in table 1 . here",
    "@xmath159 means that we use only the first @xmath159 local power modes @xmath160 out of the total 397 modes .",
    "table 1 shows that @xmath223 does not show the @xmath214-dependence .",
    "it is almost independent of @xmath159 . on the other hand",
    ", we find the pr samples do show a decrease in the error by factor @xmath224 .",
    "table 1    [ cols=\"<,<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     as a final result , we show in fig .",
    "11 the mean power @xmath97 and their error bars on scales @xmath189 , 9 and 10 given by the estimator of the bootstrap resampling developed above .",
    "the powers in fig .",
    "11 are shown in each redshift bin of the keck data .",
    "as the field is highly non - gaussian , we use confidence level to describe the uncertainty range .",
    "the error bars are the 99% confidence range of the bootstrap resampling .",
    "the error bars are independent of the parameter @xmath150 , which is taken to be 1 ( circle ) , 3 ( triangle ) and 5 ( pentagon ) .    fig .",
    "11 shows clearly the effect of intermittency .",
    "the error bars at @xmath225 and 1.9 are much larger than others , because these samples are not large enough . for redshift bins , for which the number of independent modes matches the condition of the clt convergence , this bootstrap resampling method effectively reduces the uncertainty in the power spectrum without introducing extra parameters .",
    "the most popular statistical measure in large scale structure study is the power spectrum . for gaussian fields ,",
    "there are many effective and successful algorithms of calculating the power spectrum and estimating their errors .",
    "the power spectrum in the nonlinear regime is also important not only for constraining cosmological parameters , but determining the initial conditions for the simulations of galaxy formation .",
    "however , the effects of non - gaussianity upon the power spectrum have not been fully studied yet .",
    "we studied the effect of the non - gaussianity of the field of qso ly@xmath0 transmitted flux fluctuations on the estimation of their power spectrum and errors .",
    "the flux field is intermittent . generally speaking",
    ", intermittency poses problems in the detection of power spectrum , as a large fraction of the power of the transmission fluctuations is concentrated in rare and improbable events : high spikes .",
    "thus , the power spectrum is sensitive to small probability events",
    ". therefore , the dispersion among the different spatial regions is large .",
    "this property directly challenges the application of the `` fair sample hypothesis '' ( peebles 1980 ) which assumes that a part of the universe is a fair sample of the whole and ensemble averages can be calculated by spatial averages .",
    "that is , the spatial average will not converge to the ensemble averages if the dispersion among the different spatial regions is large .",
    "mathematically , this is shown by the slow convergence of @xmath97 to the gaussian limit required by the central limit theorem , if the pdf of the field is long - tailed due to intermittency .    to reasonably estimate the uncertainty of the power spectrum ,",
    "we should carefully analyse the convergence of the data set considered , to the clt . with this result",
    ", we show that some conventional methods essentially estimate the errors by the dispersion of the powers among subsamples , ignoring the dispersion among all the independent modes of the data .",
    "they do not measure the error of the non - gaussian or intermittent field , but a gaussian field .",
    "the error given by this method is parameter - dependent .    with analysis of the clt convergence",
    ", we proposed an error estimator for the power spectrum .",
    "it is based on a bootstrap resampling among the local powers of all the modes .",
    "this estimation does nt need any extra parameter like the size of subsamples , and does nt ignore the intermittency of the fields .",
    "the powers and errors for 28 transmitted flux samples are calculated with this method .",
    "this result shows the effect of intermittency on power spectrum , and gives a more effective estimation of errors than the  optimal \" size method , especially when the number of independent modes matches the condition of the clt convergence .",
    "we studied in this paper only the unnormalised power spectrum eq .  ( 18 ) , but not the normalised power spectrum eq .",
    "( 17 ) . if the normalisation is given by a constant @xmath50 , all the results for unnormalised power spectrum hold for the normalised power spectrum .",
    "if the background @xmath50 is not constant but position dependent , the local fluctuations will couple with the background when the field is non - gaussian ( jamkhedkar , bi , & fang , 2001 ) .",
