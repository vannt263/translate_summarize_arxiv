    "this statement can be generalized to the higher dimensional euclidean spaces .",
    "the notion of the _ solid angle _ is well known and widely studied in the literatur ( see @xcite ) .",
    "we recall this definition concerning the @xmath7-dimensional euclidean space @xmath15 and we will apply it in the following .",
    "the solid angle @xmath16 subtended by a surface @xmath17 is defined as the surface area of a unit sphere covered by the surface s projection onto the sphere around @xmath18 .",
    "solid angle is measured in _ steradians _ , e.g. the solid angle corresponding to all of space being subtended is @xmath19 steradians . moreover",

    "we apply this algorithm for the regular platonic solids and some semi - regular archimedean solids as well .",
    "this generalization of the isoptic curves to the @xmath7-dimensional space provide several new way to extend the notion of isoptic surfaces to the `` smooth surfaces '' and for applications .",
    "in this section we discuss the algorithm developed to determine the isoptic surface of a given polyhedron .    1 .",
    "we assume that an arbitrary polyhedron @xmath8 is given by the usual data structure .",
    "this consists of the list of facets @xmath26 with the set of vertices @xmath27 in clockwise order .",
    "each facet can be embedded into a plane .",
    "it is well known , that if @xmath28 and @xmath29 then @xmath30 is a plane and @xmath31 define a halfspace .",
    "every polyhedron is the intersection of finitely many halfspaces .",
    "therefore an arbitrary polyhedron can also be given by a system of inequality @xmath32 where @xmath33 ( @xmath34 ) , @xmath35 and @xmath36 . the solution set of the above equation system provide the polyhedron .",
    "2 .   we have to decide for an arbitrary point @xmath37 , that which faces of @xmath8 `` can be seen '' from it .",
    "let us denote the @xmath38 facet of @xmath8 with @xmath39 @xmath40 and @xmath41 is the vector derived by @xmath38 row of the matrix @xmath14 which characterize the face @xmath39 .",
    "+ since the polyhedron @xmath8 is given by the inequality system @xmath42 , where all inequality @xmath43 ( @xmath44 ) is assigned to a certain face , therefore the facet @xmath39 is visible from @xmath24 iff the inequality @xmath45 holds .",
    "+ now , we define the characteristic function @xmath46 for each face @xmath39 : @xmath47 3 .   using the definition 1.1 , let @xmath48 be the solid angle of the facet @xmath39 regarding the point @xmath18 .",
    "+ to determine @xmath49 , we use the machinery of the spherical geometry .",
    "let us suppose that @xmath39 contains @xmath50 vertices , @xmath51 , @xmath52 where the vertices are given in clockwise order .",
    "projecting these vertexes onto the unit sphere around @xmath18 we get a spherical @xmath50-gon ( see fig  2 ) +    to unit sphere in @xmath21,width=302 ] + whose area can be calculated by the usual formula @xmath53 here @xmath54 is the sum of the angles @xmath55 of the spherical polygon @xmath39 where the angles are measured in radians .",
    "4 .   to obtain these @xmath55 angles , we need to determine the angles of the planes that contain the neigbouring edges @xmath56 where @xmath57 and @xmath58 : @xmath59 finally , we get the solid angle function @xmath60 of the facet @xmath39 for any @xmath61 @xmath62 5 .   we can summarize our results in the following + let us given a solid angle @xmath12 ( @xmath63 ) and a convex polyhedron @xmath8 by its data structure and its set of inequality",
    ". then its isoptic surface can be determined by the equation @xmath64      1 .",
    "the algorithm can be easily extended for non - closed directed surfaces _",
    "e. g. _ for subdivision surfaces",
    "if we have a * convex * polyhedron , than projecting its whole surface to the unit sphere , we obtain a double coverage ( double solid angle ) of the given polyhedron , therefore the algorithm can be changed _",
    "i.e. _ it is not necessary to determine the visible faces . in this case",
