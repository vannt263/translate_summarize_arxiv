    "since the first successful realization of the atomic bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) , the experiments , as well as theoretical works on this unique quantum state has advanced greatly by exploring different intriguing domains and expanding new horizons . by now",
    "we have obtained great controllability and tunability in the magneto - optic setup to cool , preserve and tune the atomic gases .",
    "this unique controllability has enabled multi facet research in ultra - cold atomic gases . among them",
    "the quasi one dimensional ( cigar shaped ) condensate and associated soliton solutions of the mean - field gross - pitaevskii  equation , are quite well studied till date @xcite .    nevertheless , the scope to study these non - linear systems are never ending @xcite which has been substantiated through several investigations during the last few years . among them , we note the study of a trapped bec , under the influence of an oscillating gaussian potential , where both vortex pairs and solitons can be created by suitable amplitude modulations @xcite . in another work , splitting of the ground state of an attractively interacting bec into two bright solitons with controlled relative phase and velocity has been explored @xcite .",
    "the nonlinearity of gross - pitaevskii ( gp ) equation , describing bec at the mean - field level , leads to these excitations @xcite .",
    "one may also recall that in 1963 , lieb discovered a collective excitation of the condensed bosons in a second quantized formulation , which exhibited a periodic dispersion , very different from the well - known bogoliubov mode @xcite . the same was later identified with a complex grey soliton at the mean field level @xcite , which mimics a hole - like excitation of the condensate .",
    "laboratory confirmation of this mode had been difficult due to the fact that , in the experimentally accessible low momenta regime , lieb mode dispersion lies below that of the bogoliubov excitations @xcite .",
    "the instability of bec for higher momentum values , where these two modes differ significantly , excluded this domain from observation , for quite some time .",
    "recent observation of oscillations between stable localized grey solitons in a cigar shaped bec and vortex rings has led to significant interest in the lieb mode , having complex envelope profile @xcite .",
    "these solitons have been produced through collision of two becs @xcite , when the collisional energy is reduced to a level , where it is comparable with the interaction energy .",
    "the wavelength of the laser , responsible for density modulation , is larger than the healing length . in this domain",
    ", nonlinearity plays a stronger role than dispersion and the interference effect leads to the formation of an array of grey solitons . at the lowest collisional energy ,",
    "the interference pattern produces a single pair of grey solitons .",
    "these coherent structures may have relevance for atom interferometry @xcite .",
    "the presence of a harmonic trap and the time dependent coupling parameters , can non - trivially affect the soliton dynamics .",
    "in single component bec , soliton and soliton trains in a trap with time varying scattering length and loss / gain have been analyzed @xcite .",
    "a number of recent studies have explored the dark and bright solitons in the cigar - shaped bec , revealing the nontrivial coupling between trap and soliton dynamics @xcite .",
    "hence , it is natural to inquire about the nature of the coupling between the trap and soliton geometry .",
    "the key question that arises here is about the possibility of accessing the regime of lieb - mode excitations , associated with a quantum grey soliton through the coupling between trap geometry and their excitations .",
    "the aim of this letter is to address the above question and how the confining potential under certain circumstances affects the hole - like lieb mode excitation . to start with ,",
    "we show exact grey soliton solutions for one and two component bec subject to a harmonic confinement .",
    "it is interesting to observe the dramatic collapse and revival of the atomic condensate by appropriate tailoring of the loss / gain term .",
    "further investigations reveal that these chirped grey solitons can even be accelerated , compressed or brought to rest , when the effects of the harmonic trap on the width and amplitude of the solutions are explored .",
    "we then study the solitonic lieb - mode dispersion and compare it with the usual sound ( bogoliubov ) mode dispersion .",
    "it is interesting to observe that the temporal modulation of the chirping is found to be important to resolve the lieb mode experimentally .",
    "the time modulated chirping enables us to find a small window where the hole - like excitation mode dominates over the sound mode before destabilizing the system .",
    "when the time dependency is overlooked , we extract the usual dispersion profile as shown in @xcite .",
    "one must note that , our formalism also elaborates on the control mechanism of chirping by means of external magnetic field .",
    "thus the current formulation paves the way for their coherent control and manipulation at low energy , through the temporal modulation of the scattering length , as well as the trap @xcite .",
    "the two component becs ( tbecs ) show a rich variety of solutions ( dark - dark , dark - bright and bright - bright ) , though in this paper , we restrict ourselves to the dark - bright pair .",
    "the effects of the inter - species interaction and harmonic trap on the dispersion of these hole - like excitations are investigated . in case of attractive interactions",
    ", the energy shows an upward shift with respect to the single component case . as we move from attractive regime towards repulsive , their energy decreases and exactly matches with the single component case , when inter - species interaction becomes zero . in the repulsive domain ,",
    "the energy goes down further , entering into the negative regime , which leads to the formation of a bound state for these hole - like excitations .",
    "we argued that this bound state formation can manifest in the low energy mean - field theory .",
    "the letter is organized in the following way , in sec .",
    "2 we present the exact analytical solutions for both one and two component case .",
    "these solutions lead to hole - like excitations or quantum grey soliton .",

    "information storage and retrieval in nonlinear media , particularly in active atomic media has already been demonstrated in @xcite .",
    "in this article , we study inhomogeneous multi component bec with special attention to the dispersion mechanism .",
    "we present an analytical model to tackle the inhomogeneity and relating them to he homogeneous case .",
    "later , we show that our model is general enough to replicate well known dispersion diagram while we model the interaction in a certain way @xcite .",
    "the specific control on the external magnetic field ( effectively controlling the interaction ) automatically modifies the chirping .",
    "interestingly a generic chirping ( with which we started ) can enable us to view the hole - like excitation mode experimentally in a small momentum window before getting destroyed .",
    "our study affirms the recent description of the finite lifetime soliton in a trap @xcite in a situation when we employ coherent control on the chirping .",
    "the modulated chirping enforces instability for the soliton but it also provides a scope to experimentally observe the lieb mode in a tiny momentum window .",
    "further , we note that , through our formalism , it is also possible to get back the usual dispersion diagrams akin to the general understanding by means of chirp - engineering .",
    "this opens up the possibility for the coherent control and manipulation of these hole - like excitations at low energy , through the temporal modulation of the scattering length , as well as the trap .",
    "additionally , we have shown a wide class of exact solutions for the coupled quasi - one dimensional gp equations in a trap , describing the dynamics of binary condensates .",
    "we concentrated on the case where one component possesses a hole - like excitations and the other being a bright soliton .",
    "the formation of bound state in repulsive inter - species interaction is shown and discussed that it is manifested from the low energy scattering theory .",
