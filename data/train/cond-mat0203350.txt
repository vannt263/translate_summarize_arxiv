    "recently the question of how interatomic interactions affect the particle number fluctuations has also been the object of several theoretical investigations @xcite .",
    "recall that becs can not occur in one - dimensional ( 1d ) and two - dimensional ( 2d ) uniform bose gases at finite temperature , because in that case thermal fluctuations would destabilize the condensate .",

    "the mean ground state occupation number and particle number fluctuations for the 3d have been considered for interacting gas trapped in a box @xcite and a harmonic potential @xcite .",
    "the role of dimensionality @xcite on the statistical properties of the ideal gas was also discussed recently through the calculations of the probability distribution for different spatial dimensions and various confining potentials .",
    "the purpose of the present work is an attempt to investigate the probability distribution of quasi-2d ( and purely 2d ) ideal and interacting gases confined in a harmonic trap . using the probability distribution function obtained ,",

    "<S> the statistical properties such as the mean occupation number and particle number fluctuations of the condensate are calculated . </S>",
    "<S> researches show that there is a continuous crossover of the statistical properties from a quasi-2d to a purely 2d ideal or interacting gases . different from the case of a 3d bose gas , the interaction between atoms changes in a deep way the nature of the particle number fluctuations . </S>",
