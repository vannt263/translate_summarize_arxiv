    "a persisting question of quantum theory is whether `` measurement '' is a unitary process , essentially determined by a schrdinger equation with coulomb interactions of electrons and nuclei , or whether completely different physical or even non - physical structure is involved .",
    "any unitary scenario of measurement will have to provide a mechanism for the stochasticity inherent in a quantum measurement , and will have to explain what happens to the discarded components of a wavefunction after collapse .",
    "in @xcite a scenario was proposed in which a wavefunction does not collapse but only part of it enters the consciousness of observers .",
    "it was assumed that consciousness requires the firing of a neuron , and hence @xcite the transition of a channel - pore molecule from a closed to an open state .",
    "such a transition as the basis of quantum measurement was extensively discussed already by donald @xcite . in @xcite , however , the switching of pore molecules was assumed to be an irreducible stochastic process , whereas in @xcite it was hypothesized that the transition involves molecular tunneling , assisted by a thermal environment . in this latter scenario ,",
    "the microstates of neuronal heat baths , of all observers involved , _ determine _ the collective perception of the `` measured '' result .",
    "some potential problems of the scenario were listed in @xcite .",
    "one of them , which is the subject of the present paper , is apparently due to an oversimplified model of an `` observer''assumed in @xcite to consist of only two neurons plus heat baths .",
    "in such a model , the probability for obtaining the result @xmath0 or @xmath1 from a superposition @xmath2 is not proportional to @xmath3 or @xmath4 , respectively , but rather to something like @xmath5 or @xmath6 .",
    "this is in violation of born s rule , except in case of equal amplitudes @xmath7 .",
    "the latter exception suggested an approach analogous to a derivation of born s rule @xcite from equal - amplitude superpositions of an extended system with many auxilliary states .",
    "obviously , in the nervous system of a realistic observer there are many candidates for auxilliary states .",
    "what remains to be provided for a complete picture of the measurement process is an argument as to _ why _ auxilliary states should systematically be superposed with equal amplitudes .",
    "the reason proposed here ( section [ statdom ] ) is the following .",
    "a sufficiently complex observer , when engaged in an act of measurement , has a large number of nerval states available ( ready to fire ) which are irrelevant for the result of the measurement but are nevertheless affected by the process .",
    "unitary evolution , restricted to those available states , will be determined by some effective hamiltonian .",
    "because the states are `` irrelevant '' , there is no reason for the measurement process to prefer any of them , so the process is likely to end up with a superposition belonging to a class with a large number of representatives . whether for a given class",
    "that number is large or small , relatively , is uniquely determined since an invariant ( basis - independent ) measure on the unit sphere is unique up to a proportionality factor .",
    "an essential part of the scenario is that the response of an observer s nervous system is not only determined by the object observed , but also by thermal agitation of neuronal channel pore molecules .",
    "thus , when the observer s system has interacted with the object , some neurons must be thermally induced to `` actually '' fire to produce a `` conscious '' result .",
    "this part of the measurement process has been explicated in @xcite .",
    "it was tested there numerically for an `` observer '' consisting of two neurons plus heat baths , so it remains to be generalized to an observer with many more neurons in ready - to - fire states .",
    "this is discussed in section [ uniqueness ] .",
    "conclusions are given in section [ concl ] .",
    "an alternative , more intuitive way of counting representatives of classes of superpositions is given in the appendix .",
    "we wish to assign a statistical weight to certain classes of pure quantum states .",
    "this requires a measure on the unit sphere in hilbert space which is independent of the basis in which the states are represented .",
    "such a measure is unique up to a multiplicative constant under very general conditions @xcite .",
    "let @xmath8 be the dimension of the hilbert space , and consider a general state vector represented as @xmath9 the invariant measure is proportional to @xmath10 using polar coordinates so that @xmath11 , the measure takes the form @xmath12      let us define @xmath13 to be _ phase - equivalent _ to @xmath14 if there exist phase rotations of its coefficients such that @xmath15 .",
    "calculationally , this reduces to a condition on the absolute values of the coefficients : @xmath16 the reason for not requiring exact coincidence of absolute values here is that phase - equivalent sets would then all be of measure zero , so their sizes could not be compared . an alternative argument , based on discretization instead of a normalization margin ,",
    "is given in appendix [ intuitivenumber ] .",
    "the calculation below will simplify if we , consistently , replace the delta function of equation ( [ invariantmeasure ] ) by the step function @xmath17 .",
    "the ensuing constraint is automatically satisfied for the primed radii if @xmath18 ( because of triangle inequalities ) .",
    "we now calculate @xmath19 , the volume on the unit sphere covered by superpositions phase - equivalent to of @xmath14 . using the integral measure ( [ invariantmeasure ] )",
    ", we first obtain a factor of @xmath20 by integrating over the phase angles . in the radial integrations , we substitute @xmath21 by @xmath22 and , using @xmath23 , replace the factors @xmath24 by @xmath25 .",
    "the remaining integral equals the volume of an @xmath8-dimensional ball of radius @xmath26 .",
    "thus we obtain @xmath27      the maximum of @xmath19 given in ( [ vphe ] ) , under the constraint of unit normalization , is determined by the equation @xmath28 since all @xmath29 enter the same way , the obvious result is @xmath30      let us anticipate that root - mean - square deviations from a uniform amplitude configuration are small so that we need to take into account only first and second orders .",
    "define relative deviations @xmath31 by @xmath32 the constraint of unit normalization implies @xmath33 hence , taking the logarithm of the number of phase - equivalent superpositions and expanding in @xmath31 , we obtain @xmath34 thus , the probability of relative rms deviation @xmath35 is a gaussian of width @xmath36 , @xmath37      let us assume that the observer s nervous system , when engaged in an act of measurement , has @xmath8 basis states available for reaction .",
    "unitary evolution , restricted to those states , will be determined by some effective hamiltonian .",
    "let us assume the properties of those states to be `` irrelevant '' in the sense that the result of the measurement is solely contained in a tensorial factor @xmath38 or @xmath39 associated with each of the @xmath8 nerval states .",
    "thus , prior to thermal agitation of the channel pore molecules , the entangled state is of the form @xmath40 where nerval states associated with @xmath38 have been relabeled so as to appear as the first @xmath41 summands .",
    "measurement should not change the value of the measured quantity .",
    "hence , let us assume that the unitary operator of the process commutes with the observable .",
    "if the original state of the quantum system is @xmath42 we must impose on the coefficients of ( [ superpositionlr ] ) the constraints @xmath43 we already know from sections [ ml ] and [ mlfluc ] that amplitude configurations with maximum likelihood under the constaints ( [ normconstraint ] ) are characterized by @xmath44 thus , by equation ( [ vphe ] ) , the number of phase - equivalent configurations is proportional to @xmath45 the logarithmic derivative of this expression with respect to @xmath41 ist @xmath46 which is zero for @xmath47 hence , by ( [ clcr ] ) , all @xmath48 are equal .",
    "we have thus shown that the equal - amplitude superpositions considered by deutsch @xcite and zurek @xcite are distinguished by their statistical dominance in a sufficiently complex unitary scenario .",
    "deviations from equal amplitudes have the probability determined in section [ mlfluc ] .",
    "the probability tends to zero with @xmath49 .",
    "the analytical and numerical study of @xcite showed that thermally assisted neural tunneling ( modeled with a hypothetical choice of parameters ) is capable of selecting a single term from a superposition of two terms  the firing amplitude of one neuron highly exceeds the firing amplitude of the other neuron in the majority of cases .    in the present ,",
    "more complex scenario a single term would have to be selected from a superposition of @xmath8 quantum states of the observer s nervous system .",
    "peculiar to extreme - value statistics ( gumbel distribution ) , this does not imply a dramatic decline in selectivity even with @xmath49 .",
    "let us recall that in @xcite the distribution function for extremal values @xmath50 of elongations of the pore molecule was approximated by the gumbel form @xcite @xmath51 with @xmath52 parameterizing the thermal fluctuations induced by the neuronal heat bath of a harmonically oscillating phononic heat bath can be regarded as statistically independent at sampling times @xmath53 , the gumbel form is the exact limit distribution of the maxima for @xmath54 .",
    "we are assuming @xmath55 here . ] .",
    "the maximum of the tunnel amplitude was proportional to @xmath56 with @xmath57 deriving from the parameters of the internal molecular tunnel barrier .    in the approximation ( [ f(phi ) ] )",
    "we can easily obtain the probability for the largest elongation in an ensemble of @xmath8 draws of @xmath50 to differ from the second - largest elongation by an amount greater than @xmath58 ( some chosen margin of selectivity ) .",
    "we have to sum the probabilities for @xmath59 ( @xmath60 ) taking some value while all other elongations are smaller than @xmath61 .",
    "this gives @xmath62 using @xmath63 and integrating over the variable @xmath64 from @xmath65 to @xmath66 .",
    "in particular , we recover the result @xmath67 of section 3.2 of @xcite .",
    "aiming at the selection by an outstanding tunnel amplitude of a term in a superposition , we are interested in cases where the probability ( [ p(n , a ) ] ) is close to unity , so that @xmath68 . to first order in @xmath69",
    "we have @xmath70 hence , for arbitrary @xmath8 the probability for insufficient selectivity , @xmath71 , can not be more than twice that fault probability with @xmath72 ( which case was illustrated in figure 3 of @xcite ) .",
    "in continuation of @xcite , the present approach aims to recover the dynamical pattern of quantum measurement in the `` conscious '' parts of some unitary , schrdinger - type dynamics of a suitably constituted `` observer '' .",
    "one of the potential problems listed in @xcite has been eliminated  born s rule is satisfied if an `` observer '' consists of many more than two neurons .",
    "the solution of the problem , utilizing the large number of `` auxilliary '' states of such a nervous system , was suggested by an elementary derivation of born s rule in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "two points were to be demonstrated in the present paper :    * the _ most likely superpositions _ of auxilliary states have equal amplitudes .",
    "* thermally assisted tunneling of neuronal pore molecules leads to _ dominance of one summand _ in a superposition of many neuronal states with the same efficiency as with only two states .",
    "this was shown on the basis of fairly standard results : uniqueness of the unitarily invariant measure on the unit sphere , and the gumbel distribution for extreme values of gaussian fluctuations .",
    "the unitary structure of hilbert space was taken for granted here .",
    "in particular , state vectors were assumed to be normalized in the usual way .",
    "it should be noted that this does not imply a problem of circularity in the present context .",
    "we did not undertake to derive born s rule but to show that it is consistent with _",
    "unitary _ quantum - mechanical time evolution of a system which has some relevant physical structure in common with a conscious observer engaged in a measurement .",
    "( 55mm,80mm)(0mm,55mm)[r ]   let us divide the plane of complex probability amplitudes into squares of length @xmath73 in the real and imaginary direction .",
    "the number of squares traced by a circle of radius @xmath25 is , in average over a small range of radii , @xmath74 .",
    "hence the total number of @xmath75-dimensional cells representing phase - equivalent superpositions , @xmath76^n \\prod_{k=1}^n |c_k|\\ ] ] equation ( [ vphe ] ) is thus recovered ( with a very large proportionality factor ) ."
