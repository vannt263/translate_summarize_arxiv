    "as far as the unitarity problem is concerned , one has to integrate over rapidity and stretch the pomeron loops as large as possible in rapidity space in order to obtain the maximum leading order loop amplitudes .",
    "meanwhile , the anomalous dimensions of pomeron loops are determined by the lower and upper pomerons with infinitesimal rapidity length .",
    "assuming that only one pomeron can interact with the target or projectile onia , these two pomerons then connect the target onium and projectile onium , respectively . in spite of having the same characteristic function as other large rapidity pomeron , these two pomeron , however , give rise to different value of anomalous dimensions to the loop amplitudes@xcite .    as building blocks of pomeron loops , @xmath17 amplitude as well as",

    "one can easily obtain the anomalous dimension of one loop amplitudes by calculating the @xmath17 amplitude @xmath18 since the one loop diagram is just nothing but square of @xmath17 by hooking them in the middle of the rapidity .",
    "following the same reason , the @xmath19 amplitude indicates the anomalous dimension of two loop amplitudes .",
    "the objective of this paper is then to investigate the @xmath17 and @xmath20 amplitudes explicitly after integrating the rapidity from 0 to the maximum rapidity of the system @xmath21 , and then generalize the results to @xmath2 amplitudes .    in this paper , in the way described above , we explicitly calculate the anomalous dimensions of the single , double pomeron and triple pomeron exchange amplitudes in qcd dipole model in the leading logarithmic approximation .",
    "in addition to the usual pomeron anomalous dimension @xmath22 , we find that @xmath23 and @xmath24 for double and triple pomeron exchange amplitude , respectively",
    ". the anomalous dimension @xmath23 of one loop amplitude is not new , and it has been obtained in ref .",
    "mueller:1994jq , mueller:1994gb , navelet:2002zz",
    ". the anomalous dimension of the triple pomeron exchange amplitude @xmath25 is new and is given by eqs .",
    "( [ n3f ] ) and  ( [ f3 ] ) . based on the calculation",
    ", the general formula @xmath26 which governs anomalous dimensions of @xmath27 amplitude is conjectured in the region @xmath28 and @xmath29 , where @xmath30 stands for all dipole sizes and @xmath31 represents all momentum scales .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : we start with the computation on single pomeron exchange amplitude in onium - onium scattering and discussion on the dglap evolution in double logarithmic limit , then calculate the double and triple pomeron exchange amplitudes , which are then followed by the generalization to @xmath2 amplitude and a comparison with the reggeon field theory , as well as conclusions .",
    "in order to be intuitive and complete , let us first sketch the well - known single pomeron exchange amplitude in onium - onium scattering .",
    "following mueller:1994jq , navelet:1997tx , peschanski:1997yx , the distribution of dipoles in an onium state in coordinate space reads , @xmath32where all the coordinates @xmath30 are complex coordinates in the two dimensional transverse space , @xmath33@xmath34 is the eigenfunction of the @xmath35 group , and @xmath36with @xmath37 , @xmath38 and @xmath39we define @xmath40 , \\]]where @xmath41 is the digamma function . for fixed values of @xmath42 , one can easily find that @xmath43 is always larger than @xmath44 with nonzero values of @xmath45 .",
    "thus , as one can find in later discussions , the @xmath46 contribution corresponds to the dominant pomeron trajectory with a positive intercept , and @xmath47 parts correspond to sub - dominant reggeon trajectories with intercepts being equal to or less than @xmath48 . for convenience ,",
    "we also define @xmath49 , where @xmath50 is a real function of @xmath51 which is analytic in the strip @xmath52 . for real value of @xmath51 , @xmath50 is symmetrical with respect to @xmath53 , and it has a global maximum value at @xmath53 .    according to the fourier transform of @xmath54 , @xmath55with @xmath56 , @xmath57 as an abbreviation of above definition for @xmath58 . ] and @xmath59one can get rid of the impact parameter dependence and define @xmath60 in momentum space,@xmath61where @xmath62 and @xmath63 . at very large rapidity @xmath21 ,",
    "the term corresponding to @xmath46 dominates the exponent since @xmath64 is greater than other @xmath65 .",

    "furthermore , employing saddle point approximation , it is easy to find a general formula for the intercepts of all reggeon trajectories(for all values of @xmath45 ) : @xmath77 . for reader s convenience",
    ", we list the first three sets of intercepts in the following : @xmath78 , @xmath79 and @xmath80 .",
    "the @xmath46 contribution gives to the dominant pomeron trajectory with a positive intercept , and @xmath47 parts correspond to sub - dominant reggeon trajectories with intercepts being less than or equal to @xmath48 .",
    "in addition , the single pomeron exchange amplitude between two onia with sizes @xmath30 and @xmath81 then scales as @xmath82 } { \\left ( 7\\alpha \\zeta \\left ( 3\\right ) c_{f}y\\right ) ^{3/2}}% \\right\\ } .\\ ] ]      in comparison , we would like to discuss another interesting limit of the one dipole amplitude .",
    "other than the extremely large @xmath21 rapidity limit , we now focus on the limit where @xmath83 and @xmath84 while @xmath21 is relatively small .",
    "this calculation is useful to understand the new anomalous dimensions of dipole pair and triplet densities found in later discussions .",
    "therefore , one can cast the one dipole amplitude ( eq.([n1q ] ) ) into the form , @xmath85 , \\\\ & \\simeq & \\int d\\nu \\frac{1}{2\\pi ^{2}}\\left [ \\left ( \\frac{\\rho ^{2}}{\\rho _ { a}^{2}}\\right ) ^{\\gamma } + \\left ( \\frac{\\rho ^{2}}{\\rho _ { a}^{2}}\\right ) ^{1-\\gamma } \\right ] \\exp \\left [ \\omega \\left ( 0,\\nu \\right ) y\\right ] , \\\\ & \\simeq & \\frac{1}{\\pi ^{2}}\\frac{\\rho ^{2}}{\\rho _ { a}^{2}}\\sqrt{\\frac{\\pi \\sqrt{\\frac{4\\alpha c_{f}}{\\pi } y}}{2\\ln \\left ( \\frac{\\rho _ { a}^{2}}{\\rho ^{2}}\\right ) \\sqrt{\\ln \\left ( \\frac{\\rho _ { a}^{2}}{\\rho ^{2}}\\right ) } } } \\exp % \\left [ 2\\sqrt{\\frac{4\\alpha c_{f}}{\\pi } y\\ln \\left ( \\frac{\\rho _ { a}^{2}}{% \\rho ^{2}}\\right ) } \\right]\\end{aligned}\\]]where one has used @xmath86 and the expansion @xcite @xmath87as well as saddle point approximation in the vicinity of @xmath88 or @xmath48 .",
    "thus the cross section scales as , @xmath89 .\\]]in this collinear limit ( @xmath90 ) , we retrieve the well - known result of the dglap evolution@xcite when the strong coupling is fixed .",
    "the dglap evolution is featured by the exponent being @xmath91 since it involves evolutions both in rapidity and virtuality ( the reciprocal of the dipole sizes ) in the so - called double leading logarithmic limit .",
    "furthermore , as a result of being proportional to @xmath92 when the logarithmic dependence of @xmath92 is neglected , the anomalous dimension in this situation is zero , as opposed to the anomalous dimension of the bfkl pomeron being @xmath93(for a pedagogical introduction of bfkl and dglap evolutions , see @xcite ) .",
    "in addition , in small @xmath94 limit , this coincides with the perturbative qcd calculation of the dipole - dipole cross section@xcite @xmath95with @xmath96 being the greater one of @xmath6 and @xmath7 and @xmath97 being the lesser .",
    "therefore , one expects that the anomalous dimension should approach zero when rapidity is small or dglap limit ( here we mean double leading logarithmic limit which includes both evolutions in virtuality and rapidity ) is valid .",

    "<S> single , double and triple bfkl pomeron exchange amplitudes are computed explicitly within the dipole model . </S>",
    "<S> based on the calculation , the general formula @xmath1 which governs the anomalous dimension of @xmath2 amplitude is conjectured . as far as the unitarity problem is concerned , we find that the anomalous dimension @xmath3 varies from graph to graph due to the dglap evolution . in the end , a comparison between this computation and reggeon field theory is provided . </S>"
