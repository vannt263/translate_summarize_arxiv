    "dwarf irregular ( dirr ) galaxies in the nearby universe are laboratories for studying the most fundamental properties of gas evolution and star formation .",
    "large , multi - wavelength studies of these systems are only just beginning .",
    "however , recent , high resolution surveys of large , spiral galaxies in the ultraviolet ( e.g. , ngs - @xcite ) , optical ( e.g. , nfgs - @xcite ; angst - @xcite ) , infrared ( e.g. , sings - @xcite ) , and radio ( e.g. , things - @xcite ; heracles - @xcite ) have given us insight into where and when stars form in a galaxy .",
    "they have also provided clues to the gas conditions surrounding sites of current star formation ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the conclusion is that stars form in regions rich in cold , dense , molecular material @xcite .",
    "these studies mainly focus on high metallicity systems , however . how these results translate to low metallicity environments",
    "has not been fully explored , mainly due to the fact the most commonly observed tracer of molecular material , co , is notoriously difficult to observe at low metallicity ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "nearby dirr galaxies offer the opportunity to study the star formation process in low metallicity systems at high spatial resolution .",
    "studies of the star formation rates in dirr galaxies defined from uv , 24@xmath5 m , and/or h@xmath6 emission ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) have found a non - linear correlation with the local atomic hydrogen ( ) distributions .",
    "however , the dependence of star formation on molecular gas content is apparent in the large spiral galaxies observed in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the star formation rate surface density is shown to correlate linearly with the molecular gas surface density in these galaxies .",
    "these results can be understood if one assumes that efficient star formation requires molecular hydrogen ( e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "based on theoretical studies , the very character of the interstellar medium ( ism ) is likely to change at low metallicity ( e.g. , @xcite ) . @xcite",
    "modeled the so called x - factor which measures the relationship between amount of detected co emission and the abundance of molecular hydrogen .",
    "they found that the amount of co drops substantially at low metallicities , consistent with prior predictions ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "this deficit of co at low metallicities is supported by observations showing relatively low or no detections of co emission in nearby dirr galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "consequently , this lack of metals also results in lower amounts of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon ( pah ) emission ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the pahs are important to the formation of the cold ism since they are critical in the shielding of uv and soft x - ray photons .",
    "the long standing problem of studying the molecular component in the low metallicity dwarfs continues .",
    "we expect dirr galaxies to contain molecular hydrogen since they _ are _ forming stars .",
    "however , since direct observations of the molecular gas responsible for forming stars in large samples of dirr galaxies via co are currently not feasible , we must find a different tracer of star - forming gas .",
    "one intriguing idea is to find the immediate precursors of the molecular gas .",
    "the assembly of star forming molecular clouds is generally believed to require cold  ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) . in our galaxy ,",
    "cold  clouds have been observed to surround and even intermix with molecular clouds ( e.g. , @xcite ) through studies of  narrow self absorption ( hinsa ; @xcite ) .",
    "one promising technique to find cold  gas was pioneered by @xcite in a sample of nearby , star forming dirr galaxies .",
    "these authors used high angular and spectral resolution  data of two nearby dirr galaxies to decompose line - of - sight spectra into narrow and broad gaussian components .",
    "the narrow - lined gas ( @xmath7 @xmath4 4.5 km s@xmath1 ) was found only in specific regions within the  disk while the broad - lined gas ( @xmath7 @xmath4 10 km s@xmath1 ) was found along every line - of - sight observed .",
    "the narrow gaussian component was attributed to cold ( t@xmath01000 k )  gas while the broad lined gas was assumed to be warm , neutral hydrogen ( t@xmath85000 k ) .",
    "@xcite studied three more dirr galaxies , finding that they , too , contained evidence for cold  gas .",
    "other authors have used this technique to discover cold  in a small number of other galaxies .",
    "@xcite investigated the  distribution in ngc 6822 and also found regions rich with cold  gas .",
    "recent work by @xcite found evidence of cold  gas in six dirr galaxies from the faint irregular galaxies gmrt survey ( figgs ; @xcite ) . to date , cold  in emission has been discovered in 10 nearby dirr galaxies .    within the limited data available",
    ", different measurements of the cold  do appear to give comparable results .",
    "two galaxies , ddo 210 and gr8 , from the sample of @xcite overlapped with that of @xcite .",
    "@xcite used the very large array ( vla ) at a linear scale of @xmath4200 pc beam@xmath1 with a velocity resolution of 1.3 km s@xmath1 while @xcite used the giant metrewave radio telescope ( gmrt ) at a linear resolution of @xmath4300 pc beam@xmath1 with a velocity resolution of 1.65 km s@xmath1 . despite the use of different facilities and different spatial / spectral resolutions , both studies find similar results for both the spatial distributions and velocity dispersions of the narrow component",
    "this agreement between the two studies suggests that the measurement of cold  is generally robust , and not extremely sensitive to the exact observing parameters .",
    "the technique of identifying a cold neutral medium has also been used in nearby , high metallicity spiral galaxies .",
    "@xcite isolated cold  gas using relatively low spectral resolution ( 6 km s@xmath1 ) imaging from the vla for 11 of the closest spiral galaxies .",
    "he combined spectra from discrete radial bins and found that these combined spectra all had a narrow gaussian core ( fwhm @xmath0 6 km s@xmath1 ) superposed onto broad ( fwhm @xmath4 30 km s@xmath1 ) lorentzian wings .",
    "he also found that the cold  gas is filamentary and is found in clumps , preferentially in the spiral arms . since the majority of star formation in spiral galaxies occurs in molecular clouds within the spiral arms ( e.g. , @xcite ) , it is not surprising to find the bulk of the cold  associated with these features .",
    "the purpose of our study is to build upon the previous results of @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite in order to provide limits to the locations and amount of cold  gas in a large sample of 31 nearby , low - mass galaxies using a common spatial resolution .",
    "we describe our galaxy sample in  [ obs ] and our methods of signal extraction in  [ idents ] .",
    "our results are described in  [ results ] and we end with a summary of our conclusions in  [ conclusions ] .",
    "galaxies for this work were taken from two major  surveys of nearby galaxies : the  nearby galaxy survey ( things ; aw0605 ; @xcite ) and the very large array - advanced camera for surveys nearby galaxy survey treasury ( vla - angst ; ao0215 ; ott et al . _ in preparation _ ) .",
    "our sample consists of 24 galaxies from vla - angst and 7 dwarf galaxies in the m81 group from things .",
    "the vla - angst observations all have a high spectral resolution of 0.65 - 2.6 km s@xmath1 .",
    "the 7 galaxies from the things sample have velocity resolutions of 1.3 - 2.6 km s@xmath1 .",
    "the high velocity resolution is crucial for detecting narrow velocity components .",
    "other galaxies from the things sample were not used because they had velocity resolutions of 5 km s@xmath1 , too coarse for this type of analysis .",
    "our final sample contains 31 galaxies with distances ranging from 1.3 - 5.3 mpc ( average 2.9 mpc ) and  masses between 4@xmath910@xmath10 - 1@xmath910@xmath11 @xmath12 .",
    "all observations were made using the very large array ( vla ) observatory .",
    "we briefly outline the basic reduction procedure here , but note that both surveys followed similar recipes , described fully in @xcite and ott et al .",
    "( _ in preparation _ ) .",
    "standard aips processing of spectral line data was followed .",
    "phase , bandpass , and flux corrections were made using typical vla calibrators .",
    "two sets of data cubes were produced : a natural weighted cube with a typical beam size of @xmath410@xmath13 and a robust weighted cube with a beam size of @xmath47@xmath13 .",
    "both sets of data have rms noise values of @xmath41 mjy beam@xmath1 in a single line - free channel .",
    "we use the robust weighted cubes in this work , which allows us to use the smallest possible uniform linear scale .",
    "further , robust weighting produces minimal side - lobes allowing for a clean - beam which better approximates the dirty beam structure than that of the more complex structure seen in the dirty - beam of natural weighting @xcite .",
    "the better dirty - beam approximation of the robust weighting is ideal for the extended emission observed in  data .",
    "the main difference between the data for the two surveys is due to the inclusion of updated expanded vla ( evla ) antennas into the array for the vla - angst survey ( the evla has since been renamed the ",
    "karl g. janksy very large array \" ) .",
    "unfortunately , the conversion of the digital evla signal to an analog signal ( to be compatible with the vla signal ) aliased power into the first 0.5 mhz of the baseband .",
    "this only affected the evla - evla baselines and they were subsequently removed from the data ( see ott et al . _ in preparation _ for full details ) .",
    "aliasing did not correlate into the mixed vla - evla baselines and the vla - vla baselines were unaffected . to compensate for the loss of the evla - evla baselines , additional observation time",
    "was spent on each source .",
    "table [ galprop ] gives an overview of the major observational properties of our galaxy sample .",
    "the table columns are : 1 ) galaxy name , 2,3 ) ra and dec , 4 ) distance in mpc ( from trgb measurements in @xcite unless otherwise noted ) , 5 ) total  mass , 6 ) absolute @xmath14-band magnitude , 7 ) the major - axis length in arcminutes at the @xmath425 mag arcsec@xmath15 level ( except for kkh 98 and kk 230 , which use the holmberg system of @xmath426.5 mag arcsec@xmath15 ; @xcite ) , 8) inclination @xcite , 9 ) the 200 pc beam size ( see  [ methods ] ) , 10 ) the spectral resolution , and 11 ) the rms of the noise in the line - free channels of the data cube . while some metallicity estimates exist for the most massive galaxies in our sample , most do not have measured abundances . using the relation in @xcite which relates m@xmath2 to the oxygen abundance",
    "( see also @xcite ) , we expect a range of 7.0@xmath012+log(o / h)@xmath08.2 with a median value of 7.7 for the low mass galaxies in our sample .",
    "we analyze line - of - sight spectra following methods similar to those outlined in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "first , we smoothed each image cube with a gaussian kernel to a common linear scale of 200 pc beam@xmath1 . to do this we computed the angular size equivalent of 200 pc for each galaxy using the distances given in table [ galprop ] .",
    "we then used the convl task in aips which incorporates the initial beam size , beam position angle , and requested output beam size to compute the required convolving kernel .",
    "we note that our circular beam sizes can sample slightly larger linear scales depending on galaxy inclination .",
    "spectra were then extracted through every 1@xmath165 pixel ( 1@xmath13 pixels for ngc  247 and ngc  3109 ) .",
    "extracting spectra from every pixel over - samples the beam , but for our purposes , does not influence the results .",
    "also , the beam sizes reported in table [ galprop ] and the typical galaxy rotation speeds of 10 - 20 km s@xmath1 are small enough that kinematic broadening is minimal , regardless of galaxy inclination . note that spectral broadening would work to hide a narrow component , not create one .",
    "each extracted spectrum was successively fitted using our own routines with two different functional forms : a single gaussian and a double gaussian .",
    "we also attempted to fit the spectra with a fourth order gauss - hermite polynomial of the form @xmath17\\ ] ] where @xmath18 @xcite , @xmath19 and @xmath20 measure the amplitudes of an asymmetric and a symmetric deviation from an underlying gaussian profile with amplitude @xmath21 , central velocity @xmath22 , and standard deviation @xmath23 .",
    "gauss - hermite polynomials offer useful characterizations of non - gaussian line profiles , but as @xcite point out , the direct relationship between the gauss - hermite variables and the physical conditions of the gas is not obvious . in general , the results of the double gaussian and gauss - hermite polynomial fits were in excellent agreement , although the detection efficiency of the gauss - hermite polynomials is much lower .",
    "however , we expect the observed spectra to have a gaussian profile if the gas has an isothermal density distribution @xcite .",
    "since the relationship between the gauss - hermite polynomial parameters and the physical nature of the gas is not obvious , we only report the results of the single and double gaussian fits .",
    "a spectrum was identified as containing narrow - line  only if multiple criteria were fulfilled .",
    "first , we only fit extracted spectra with a s / n greater than 10 ( see  [ sims ] ) .",
    "we define s / n in the same manner as @xcite , that is , the peak in the spectrum divided by the rms noise in the line free channels of the data cube .",
    "we also required each individual component of the double gaussian fit to have a minimum s / n of 3.1 .",
    "this minimum s / n requirement was also used by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite and is motivated by our desire to obtain significant detections . also , each spectrum ( single or multiple component ) was required to have a velocity dispersion greater than the velocity resolution of the data ( 0.65 , 1.3 , or 2.6 km s@xmath1 ) beyond the 1@xmath7 errors in the fits . requiring the velocity dispersion plus error to be greater than the velocity resolution ensures we are not fitting noise spikes in the data .",
    "fortunately , none of the fitted spectra were affected by this criterion .",
    "typical errors in the velocity dispersion of each single and double gaussian component are roughly 0.7 km s@xmath1 .",
    "we also do not enforce any restrictions on the central velocity offsets between individual components , leaving this as a free parameter .    to quantify which function best fitted each spectrum , we first computed the variance of the residuals for each fit .",
    "the ratio of the variances between the single and double gaussian fits were then compared statistically via a single - tailed f - test .",
    "a double gaussian fit was determined to be statistically significant if the probability of improvement over a single gaussian fit was 95% or greater .",
    "we were as conservative with our approach as possible in order to provide secure lower limits to the total amount of narrow - line  in each galaxy .",
    "@xcite , @xcite , and @xcite were less conservative in their approach , requiring only a 90% significance of improvement over a single gaussian profile .",
    "because of our relatively high s / n cut - off , the results of our fitting are relatively independent of the f - test criterion that we use , as long as it is above roughly 70% . since the number of detections of double gaussian profiles increases very slowly as the cut - off is reduced from 95% down to 70% , we chose 95% confidence to establish a very firm lower limit on the total cold  content .",
    "establishing a realistic upper limit is more problematic and is highly dependent upon assumptions .",
    "we further adopt the criteria of @xcite that cold  has a velocity dispersion of less than 6 km s@xmath1 .",
    "a velocity dispersion of 6 km s@xmath1 results in an upper limit to the gas temperature of @xmath41400 k ( assuming ( 3/2)kt = ( 1/2)@xmath24@xmath7@xmath25 ) .",
    "thus , we did not ascribe a second component as cold  when the fits detected multiple components with similar velocity dispersions between 6 - 10 km s@xmath1 or one component with a velocity dispersion of 6 - 10 km s@xmath1 and another component with a much higher dispersion . the vast majority of spectra that were best fit by double gaussian profiles with both velocity dispersions greater than 6 km s@xmath1 were double peaked ( in both low and high inclination galaxies ) which is normally associated with expanding structures ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "furthermore , these higher velocity dispersions are not typical for the cold  described in the literature with velocity dispersions of 2 - 6 km s@xmath1 ( @xcite ) ; we therefore rejected these locations as having narrow line emission .",
    "@xcite also noted that the bulk of the spectra within this category for ngc  6822 were double - peaked , leading them to make a cut at 6 km s@xmath1 .",
    "thus , having a cut at 6 km s@xmath1 ensures that we are both reporting cold gas and eliminating a large fraction of the double peaked spectra .",
    "the double - peaked spectra eliminated by this criteria represent less than 1% of the total spectra and are not included in any of the following analyses .",
    "we also identify spectra that were sufficiently fit by a single gaussian profile with a velocity dispersion of less than 6 km s@xmath1 as cold . limiting our cold  identifications to gas with velocity dispersions",
    "less than 6 km s@xmath1 ensures we are not misidentifying warm  as cold .",
    "one possible scenario is that the broad component is the combination of multiple cold gas ( narrow gaussian ) clouds . given that the typical line - of - sight spectrum is best fit by a single gaussian profile ( see  [ results ] ) , the multiple cold  clouds would have to conspire in such a way to maintain this gaussianity . while this scenario is physically possible",
    ", it requires a large number of cold hi clouds with distributions in velocities and amplitudes that would systematically combine to maintain a total gaussian velocity dispersion equal to the observed velocity dispersion for the warm hi phase .",
    "high resolution absorption line studies would be required to distinguish whether the broad component is truly broad or a composite of many narrow components . however",
    ", if we assume that the galaxies can be approximated by a thin disk we would expect that the line centroid of the cold  to be at or very near the line centroid of the warm .",
    "warm  gas scale heights in dwarf galaxies tend to be a few hundred pc ( e.g. , @xcite ) compared to their few kpc diameters , so this is not a bad assumption . offset velocity gas due to inclination effects would then contribute to the broadening of the warm ( broad gaussian ) component and less so to the cold ( narrow ) component gas .",
    "not surprisingly , the average central velocity offset between the components of the best fit double gaussian profiles in our sample is 0.35 km s@xmath1 , which is less than the velocity resolution of our data .",
    "thus , the observations are most simply interpreted as a combination of cold gas near the central velocity ( when observed ) and nearly ubiquitous warm gas .",
    "we find it highly unlikely that the broad component is a combination of multiple narrow components .",
    "this leads us to the conclusion that the  is dominated by the warm phase and that the cold phase represents a much smaller fraction of the ism in our sample of dwarf galaxies .",
    "the top panel of figure [ spectrum ] shows an extracted spectrum ( black ) from the vla - angst observations of sextans a with single gaussian profile ( blue dashed ) , double gaussian profile ( solid red ) , and gauss - hermite polynomial fits ( dotted magenta ) .",
    "the bottom panel shows the residual to the fit .",
    "this spectrum has a clear narrow peak that is not fit well by the single gaussian profile . both the double gaussian profile and the gauss - hermite polynomial fit the spectrum statistically better than the single gaussian profile at the 99.9% confidence level .",
    "although the gauss - hermite polynomial is a better fit than the single gaussian profile , the residuals clearly show that the double gaussian profile is even better .    in summary",
    ", we identify cold  by the following process : 1 ) only spectra with a s / n greater than 10 were fit , 2 ) each spectrum was successively fitted with a single and double gaussian function , 3 ) each individual component of the double gaussian fit was required to have a minimum s / n of 3.1 , 4 ) the velocity dispersion plus error had to be greater than the velocity resolution of the data , 5 ) double gaussian fits were accepted if they improved the fit over a single gaussian profile at the 95% or greater confidence level in a single tailed f - test , and 6 ) cold  can be described by single or double gaussian profiles with velocity dispersions less than 6 km s@xmath1 .",
    "there are two factors which could lead to non - detections of existing cold .",
    "cold  could be missed simply because the column density is too low to reach our s / n requirement , or it could be missed because a higher s / n is required to deblend the cold  from the warm . as a test of our ability to extract multiple components from a given spectrum",
    ", we produced three sets of 50,000 uniformly distributed synthetic spectra that spanned the s / n of our sample ( 10 @xmath26 s / n @xmath26 60 ; one set each at 0.65 , 1.3 , and 2.6 km s@xmath1 velocity resolution ) .",
    "each spectrum contained two gaussian profiles that are representative of the warm and cold  gas ; a  broad \" gaussian with @xmath27 between 8 and 12 km s@xmath1 and a  narrow \" gaussian with @xmath28 between 3 and 6 km s@xmath1 .",
    "we allowed for an offset of @xmath292.5 km s@xmath1 between the line centroids .",
    "velocity offsets larger than 2.5 km s@xmath1 allow for much higher detection fractions since the spectra become more asymmetric .",
    "the observed cold  line centroids are also very similar to the warm  line centroids ( as discussed in  [ methods ] ) . for each s /",
    "n , we randomized the amplitude of the cold  gaussian .",
    "we then chose the warm  gaussian such that the s / n was conserved .",
    "as for the analysis with our observations , each individual component was required to have a s / n @xmath30 3.1 .",
    "a new set of gaussians was produced if each component did not have a s / n @xmath30 3.1 .",
    "we next added random noise to each spectrum and then passed each randomly generated spectrum through our fitting routine to gauge our recovery rate .",
    "the top row of figure [ mcarlo ] shows histograms of the total number of synthetic spectra ( solid black line ) and the total number identified as requiring multiple components by a double gaussian fit ( solid red line ) as a function of s / n .",
    "the red histograms also include the locations best fit by a single gaussian with a velocity dispersion of less than 6 km s@xmath1 .",
    "the bottom row shows the detection efficiency as a function of s / n for the double gaussian fits ( including the best fit single gaussians with a velocity dispersion of less than 6 km s@xmath1 ) .",
    "figure [ mcarlo ] shows that we never identify all double gaussian profiles within the range of s / n values scrutinized and our recovery efficiency worsens as the velocity resolution decreases .",
    "the differences in recovery efficiency between the 0.65 and 1.3 km s@xmath1 simulations are less pronounced than from 1.3 to 2.6 km s@xmath1 .",
    "table [ simtab ] shows the results of the simulations for each velocity resolution for the double gaussian profiles that were identified .",

    "as is shown in figure [ mcarlo ] , the recovery efficiency is dependent upon the s / n .",
    "the best fit single gaussians are predominately in a regime where the narrow component dominates the spectra ( amplitude ratios less than 1 and velocity dispersion ratios less than 2.5 ) .",

    "each of their total  masses , m@xmath2 values , distances , stellar disk sizes , and star formation rates ( see  [ h2sfr ] ) are similar to other galaxies in our sample that do show cold  detections .",
    "fortunately , our sample of 27 galaxies had some overlap with previous studies using similar methods to detect cold .",
    "@xcite detected cold  in ugca 292 and gr8 using the vla while @xcite detected it in ddo  53 , mcg09 - 20 - 131 , gr8 and m81  dwarf  a using the gmrt .",
    "these five galaxies are amongst the faintest and smallest galaxies in our sample and as a result , we detected cold  in only 3 of these 5 galaxies : ddo  53 , gr8 , and m81  dwarf  a. our selection criteria failed to produce a cold  signature in ugca  292 or mcg09 - 20 - 131 .",
    "the three galaxies in which we did detect cold  are included in figure [ 2plots ] .",
    "for gr8 , @xcite and @xcite each found cold  in both the northern and south - western portions of the galaxy while @xcite also found some evidence in the eastern portion of the galaxy . in contrast , we only found cold  in the northern region of gr8 . for m81",
    "dwarf  a we detect cold  only in the eastern side of the galaxy while @xcite find a hint of cold  in the western side of the galaxy as well .",
    "for ddo  53 we found good overall agreement with the previous study , although our total detection area is smaller .",
    "the data quality between each survey is similar , yet they provide minor differences in their results .",
    "our simulations suggest velocity resolution differences may play a role in the detection differences between the studies .",
    "the velocity resolutions in our sample for these galaxies are 0.65 , 1.3 , and 2.6 km s@xmath1 for gr8 , m81  dwarf  a , and ddo  53 , respectively .",
    "the literature velocity resolutions are 1.3 and 1.65 km s@xmath1 for gr8 , 1.65 km s@xmath1 for m81  dwarf  a , and 1.65 km s@xmath1 for ddo  53 .",
    "the galaxy with the most similar cold  distribution , ddo  53 , has the worst velocity resolution in our sample , 0.85 km s@xmath1 worse than the literature value .",
    "gr8 has been analyzed with three different velocity resolutions and each study finds slightly different results .",
    "we reduced our velocity resolution to 1.3 km s@xmath1 for gr8 to compare to the other studies and obtained no difference in our results .",
    "dwarf  a was analyzed with similar velocity resolutions , yet there still exists slight differences . despite analyzing data from different observatories with different velocity resolutions , the general results are all similar .",
    "it seems likely that the differences in each galaxy arise from small differences in the selection criteria and beam shape .",
    "for example , both @xcite and @xcite used naturally weighted data cubes which , on average , produce higher s / n spectra .",
    "however , as noted in  [ obs ] , the robust weighting for combined array data is ideal for studying extended emission due to the better clean beam approximation of the dirty beam in the clean algorithm .",
    "the previous studies also used a cutoff of 90% in the f - test statistic and also allow the narrow gaussian component to be larger than 6 km s@xmath1 , finding values up to @xmath48 km s@xmath1 .",
    "if each spectrum consisted of both a broad and narrow component and were not inherently a single gaussian profile , we would expect to find far more locations with a narrow line signature than we actually do .",
    "the top panel of figure [ expected ] shows a histogram for every independent line - of - sight ( black line ) , the expected number of identified narrow line detections ( blue ) ( based upon our detection efficiency as calculated in  [ sims ] and the assumption that a narrow component exists at each location ) , and the actual number of narrow line detections ( red ) as a function of s / n .",
    "the bottom panel shows the detection fraction as a function of s / n .",
    "figure [ expected ] demonstrates the large gap between the number of spectra for which we are sensitive to the presence of narrow  and the number of spectra for which there are detections .",
    "our expected recovery fraction is insensitive to small changes in the reasonable ranges used for the parameters .",
    "the lower s / n spectra have fewer fractional detections .",
    "as discussed in  [ sims ] , the lower fractional detections at lower s / n values are due , in part , to our recovery efficiency but may also be due to a minimum total  column density required for the appearance of cold .",
    "@xcite recently observed  in the milky way and determined a minimum column density threshold of 2@xmath910@xmath54 cm@xmath15 for the formation of a cold phase of , which is just at the column density limit of where our sample begins .",
    "the top row of figure [ cdplot ] shows histograms of all of the observed column densities in our galaxy sample ( black ) , and the column densities where we detect cold  ( red ) . the bottom row shows our detection fraction as a function of column density .",
    "the small fraction of narrow line detections at high s / n compared to what would be expected clearly shows that the cold  that can be identified with this technique is inconsistent with a ubiquitous distribution .",
    "it should also be noted that there could exist cold  at every line - of - sight below a s / n of 3.1 that we would be insensitive to .",
    "however , it would be unphysical for the presence of gas to be related to our s / n criterion and not to the  column density .",
    "furthermore , absorption line studies in the milky way indicate that cold  gas is not ubiquitous ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the typical velocity dispersion for the cold  is @xmath44.5 km s@xmath1 .",
    "the broad components and best - fit single gaussian profiles vary by galaxy , but they generally have similar values .",
    "we expect the broad and best fit single components to be similar if they are both tracing the same warm .",
    "figure [ veldisp ] shows histograms of the narrow ( red ) , broad ( blue ) , and single ( black ) velocity dispersions for each galaxy .",
    "the dotted vertical line denotes our cold  cutoff limit of 6 km s@xmath1 .",
    "the single component histograms have been scaled in order to show the narrow and broad component histograms more clearly .",
    "generally , the velocity dispersions of the broad components overlap with those of the single components .",
    "however , the peak in the broad component is offset from the peak in the single component towards higher values .",
    "this behavior is also seen for the majority of the cases in the literature , and is probably due to the fact that it is easier to identify a narrow component when the broad component has a much larger value .    in figure [ disprad ] ,",
    "we plot the average velocity dispersion , @xmath3@xmath7@xmath30 , of the warm ( black ) and cold ( red )  gas as a function of radius for each of our different velocity resolutions .",
    "we have omitted the locations best fit by a single gaussian with a velocity dispersion of less than 6 km s@xmath1 .",
    "the average warm  velocity dispersion declines with radius .",
    "this trend is similar to the total  velocity dispersion versus radius seen by @xcite .",
    "the decrease in the velocity dispersion with increasing radius may indicate a decrease in turbulent energy supplied by the underlying stellar population as the radius increases away from the center of the stellar disk .",
    "recent work on galaxy simulations of spiral disks have put limits on the predicted volume filling factor of the different gas phases in the ism ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the cold ( t @xmath3 1000 k ) ism occupies @xmath020% of a galaxy s volume , depending upon the star formation ( supernova ) rate .",
    "the cold neutral medium , however , may occupy only a few percent of the volume @xcite .",
    "the actual value will vary by galaxy and must also be sensitive to the available ism coolants ( e.g. , c@xmath57 , co , dust , etc . ) and the global gravitational potential .    without knowing the exact 3-dimensional structure of the galaxies in our sample",
    ", we can not calculate the volume filling fractions .",
    "instead , we calculate the areal filling fractions ( @xmath48 ) , i.e. , the ratio of the number of lines - of - sight with detected cold  and the total number of lines - of - sight with s / n @xmath30 10 ( see table [ indres ] , column 3 ) .",
    "we derive an average @xmath48 value of 9% .",
    "the true volume filling fractions based upon our detections are most likely even lower than these values since the scale height of the warm  will be larger than that of the cold .",
    "the low filling fractions we compute are consistent with the ism model of @xcite .    we also computed a lower limit to the total mass ( flux ) contribution of the cold  for each galaxy using the narrow component of the gaussian fits ( @xmath49 ; see table [ indres ] , column 4 ) . @xcite and @xcite found that roughly 20% of the total  mass is in the cold , which is significantly higher than the @xmath43% typical for our values of @xmath58 .",
    "it is unclear as to the reason for this large discrepancy since the data are of similar quality .",
    "the biggest differences may lie in the higher s / n resulting from the natural weighting these other studies use as compared to the robust weighting we employ . also , @xcite use a different statistical test in defining the acceptance of cold  detections .",
    "these authors accept a double gaussian fit as statistically better than a single gaussian fit if the @xmath59@xmath25 value is improved by 10% .",
    "furthermore , our values are lower limits given our selection criteria and sensitivities .",
    "figure [ fracs ] plots @xmath48 and @xmath49 as a function of m@xmath2 ( left ) and @xmath60 ( right ) .",
    "no obvious trends arise between the areal filling fraction and mass fraction with absolute @xmath14-band magnitude or total  mass .    if we assume ( as noted in  [ nodets ] ) that each line of sight has cold  just below our detection limits , we can estimate an upper limit to the amount of cold  in each galaxy . to do this",
    "we have used a representative cold  gaussian of amplitude 3.1@xmath7 and velocity dispersion of 4.5 km s@xmath1 at each location where we do not detect cold .",
    "we then add this  extra \" mass to our detected cold  mass to produce an upper limit to the cold  mass fraction ( @xmath50 ; see column 5 in table [ indres ] ) .",
    "these values of @xmath61 can range up to 50% .",
    "however , since the cold  is most frequently associated with higher values of n@xmath46 ( see  [ colddets ] ) , it is unlikely that the true values of cold  mass get as high as these upper limits .",
    "another , perhaps more reasonable way to calculate an upper limit to the cold - to - total  mass fraction is to find the typical fractional flux contributed to the cold component along each line - of - sight and assume this fraction holds throughout the sample . for locations where we find both warm and cold  components ,",
    "the cold  typically is not the dominant phase in the ism .",
    "the top row of figure [ histrat ] shows a normalized histogram of the flux ratio of cold and total  defined as the ratio of the column density of the narrow gaussian profile and the total column density along the line - of - sight .",
    "the cold  constitutes @xmath420% of the total line flux for any given line - of - sight .",
    "the bottom panels of figure [ histrat ] show this same ratio as a function of s / n for each velocity resolution .",
    "if we assume that _ every _ line - of - sight contains cold , then an upper limit to the cold - to - total mass ratio for each galaxy is @xmath420% .",
    "this value is what is reported by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "however , this value is also likely too high since it requires the entire galaxy to contain cold  gas .",
    "@xcite observed the small magellanic cloud in 21 cm absorption and found that the mass fraction of cold  to be less than 15% of the total  content .",
    "it seems likely that the true value of the cold  mass fractions of the low mass galaxies in our sample are between our lower limits and @xmath415% .",
    "@xcite observed 21-cm milky way absorption towards 12 background radio continuum sources .",
    "they were able to determine the flux contribution of the cold  along many of these sight lines .",
    "they find that the cold  contributes from a low of @xmath42% to as high as @xmath469% , of the total flux determined in the same manner , with a median of @xmath430% .",
    "while a direct comparison between the optically thick cold  observed by @xcite and our optically thin emission is not obvious , we would not expect the fraction of cold  in emission to be drastically different .",
    "our result of @xmath420% is slightly lower than their median value , but does not appear to be at odds with their result .      as discussed in  [ methods ] , some lines - of - sight were best fit by a single gaussian profile with a velocity dispersion of less than 6 km s@xmath1 .",
    "these best fit single gaussian profiles were found in 6 of the 23 galaxies with cold  detections .",
    "most of these six galaxies have a large fraction of their  at galactocentric radii beyond the @xmath425 mag arcsec@xmath15 optical level , and the majority of these single gaussian fits are also located at larger radii .",
    "figure [ muchoblooshto ] shows the radial distribution of the cold  locations that lack a warm component .",
    "the galaxies have been ordered from low ( m81  dwarf  a ) to high ( ngc  247 ) absolute @xmath14-band luminosity",
    ". two of these galaxies , m81  dwarf  a and holmberg  i , have large central holes in their  distributions ( see @xcite and references therein ) where much of their gas is pushed beyond the optical radius .",
    "only ngc  247 has a majority of these locations within the optical radius .",
    "figure [ n42142plot ] shows an example of the difference between those areas that contain a warm component and those that lack one for ngc  4214 .",
    "the left panel shows only those locations that contain both a warm and cold  component while the right panel also includes the locations that lack a warm component .",
    "the contours correspond to the 10@xmath54 and 10@xmath55 cm@xmath15 total  column densities and the blue circle approximates the 25 mag arcsec@xmath15 level ( uncorrected for inclination and position angle ) .",
    "it is immediately apparent that the majority of the best fit single gaussian profiles fall well beyond the bulk of the stellar population and far from any heat sources .",
    "@xcite provides evidence that the warm  velocity dispersions inside the optical radius of disk galaxies is driven by stellar processes , while areas beyond the optical radius may be driven by thermal broadening and/or magneto - rotational instabilities .",
    "these authors also point out that the velocity dispersions decline as a function of radius , falling below the typical 10 km s@xmath1 beyond the optical radius .",
    "we also see this declining trend in the velocity dispersion with radius ( see figure [ disprad ] ) .",
    "these results are suggestive that cold  can be the dominant constituent of the ism only in the lower uv radiation field beyond the @xmath425 mag arcsec@xmath15 optical level .",
    "we next compare the cold  gas masses to the molecular gas masses and star formation rates ( sfrs ) in each galaxy . to make these comparisons we compute the sfrs and estimate the amount of molecular hydrogen each galaxy contains .",
    "the relationship between the sfr and molecular hydrogen is discussed in detail in  [ intro ] .",
    "we used the sfrs given by both fuv and h@xmath6 luminosities to estimate the amount of molecular hydrogen .",
    "table [ sfrs ] lists the sfrs derived from fuv and h@xmath6 luminosities taken from the literature for each galaxy with a detected cold  signature .",
    "the columns are : ( 1 ) galaxy name , ( 2 ) mass of the cold  ( @xmath62 ) computed using the lower limit mass fraction from table [ indres ] multiplied by the total  mass given in table [ galprop ] , ( 3 ) apparent fuv magnitude ( m@xmath63 ; @xcite ) , ( 4 ) the logarithm of the fuv luminosity ( l@xmath63 ) , ( 5 ) the fuv sfr ( sfr@xmath63 ) computed using the relation given in @xcite , ( 6 ) the h@xmath64 gas mass ( @xmath65 ) computed from sfr@xmath63 assuming a 100 myr timescale and a star formation efficiency of 10% ( @xmath65 = sfr@xmath63 @xmath9 100 myr / 0.1 ) ,",
    "( 7 ) the approximate fraction of the cold ism attributed to the cold  ( @xmath66 ) defined as @xmath62/(@xmath62 + @xmath65 ) , ( 8) the logarithm of the h@xmath6 luminosity ( l@xmath67 ; @xcite ) , ( 9 ) the sfr derived from l@xmath67 using the relation in @xcite , ( 10 ) the h@xmath64 gas mass ( @xmath68 ) computed from sfr@xmath67 assuming a 5 myr timescale and a star formation efficiency of 10% ( @xmath68 = sfr@xmath63 @xmath9 5 myr / 0.1 ) , and ( 11 ) the approximate fraction of the cold ism attributed to the cold  ( @xmath69 ) defined as @xmath62/(@xmath62 + @xmath68 ) . using our lower limit mass fraction from the spectra above s / n of 10 and extrapolating it over the entire galaxy provides a lower limit to the total cold  mass .    the expected relationship between the currently observed cold  and the computed molecular gas masses is not immediately clear .",
    "the mass fractions of the cold ism attributed to the cold  is lower for h@xmath64 masses computed from the longer timescale sfr@xmath63 ( table [ sfrs ] , column 7 ) than they are for those computed from sfr@xmath67 ( table [ sfrs ] , column 11 ) .",
    "the time scale to convert the cold  into molecular hydrogen is likely dependent upon the metallicity of the environment ( a longer time scale is expected for lower metallicities ) and local uv radiation field ( a shorter time scale is expected for lower uv radiation ) . since dwarf galaxies have both low metallicities and different ranges of uv radiation strengths , it is not obvious which molecular gas mass estimate provides the best comparison . unfortunately , our current data do not allow us to investigate these timescales further .",
    "the top and bottom panels of figure [ sfrfig ] show plots of the sfr@xmath63 ( filled circles ) and sfr@xmath67 ( open squares ) as a function of the cold  mass and total  mass , respectively .",
    "if the cold  is related to the star formation in any direct way , we would expect to find a trend in this relation .",
    "indeed , the higher the cold  gas mass , the higher the sfr , although this same trend is seen with the total  gas mass and may just be a consequence of the more  gas available , the higher the sfr .",
    "the middle panel shows the sfr efficiency ( sfe@xmath70 ) defined as the sfr divided by the total  gas mass as a function of the cold  gas mass .",
    "the sfe@xmath70 is roughly constant over our range of cold  masses .",
    "the differences between the derived fuv and h@xmath6 star formation rates has been previously reported in @xcite and is due at least in part to the fact that the sfrs are averaged over different timescales .",
    "environmental conditions may also influence sfr@xmath67 by leakage of the ionizing photons from the star forming regions ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "we can compare our molecular gas mass estimates derived from the sfrs to a direct observational estimate of the molecular gas in ngc  4214 @xcite to see if our values are reasonable .",
    "these authors observed co emission in the inner @xmath41@xmath716@xmath91@xmath716 of the star forming disk of ngc  4214 ( an area much smaller than the  disk , see  [ nowarm ] ) and derived a molecular gas mass of 5.1@xmath910@xmath72 @xmath12 .",
    "this value is similar to the molecular gas mass estimate we get from sfr@xmath67 of 6.1@xmath910@xmath72 @xmath12 .",
    "the molecular gas mass value computed by @xcite was based on an assumed co to h@xmath64 conversion factor ( the so called x - factor ) derived from observations of galactic environments ( i.e. , high metallicity ) .",
    "recent work on the x - factor has shown that the relation changes with decreasing mean visual extinction ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the lower metallicity environment of dirr galaxies results in lower visual extinction values and thus a different x - factor value .",
    "depending upon the true mean visual extinction value of ngc  4214 , the actual molecular gas mass could be higher by a factor of a few to an order of magnitude or more . @xcite",
    "derive an x - factor value roughly 40 times higher than the galactic value for ngc  4214 . using this value , the @xcite molecular gas mass increases to @xmath42@xmath910@xmath73 @xmath12 , closer to our derived h@xmath64 mass using sfr@xmath63 of 1@xmath910@xmath73 @xmath12 .",
    "@xcite also derive a molecular gas mass of @xmath42@xmath910@xmath73 @xmath12 for ngc  4214 .",
    "the factor of 2 difference between the values most likely arise from our basic assumptions of a timescale of 100 myr for the fuv emission and/or the star formation efficiency of 10% .",
    "unfortunately , the lack of co detections for the few galaxies in our sample that have been observed for co prohibit us from repeating this exercise for other galaxies in our sample ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . nevertheless , our estimates of molecular gas masses , although uncertain , are not unreasonable . direct comparisons between the co detections in ngc  4214 and our cold  detections is the focus of future work .",
    "we have observed line - of - sight  emission spectra in 31 nearby , low metallicity dirr galaxies in order to search for cold  defined by a velocity dispersion of less than 6 km s@xmath1 .",
    "we have detected it in 23 of 27 galaxies after quality control cuts were applied .",
    "the cold  may be the future sites of molecular cloud and star formation and to date , are the only way to potentially trace star forming gas at low metallicity . based upon our observations , we find :    * the cold  gas is found in localized regions and usually at total  column densities above the canonical threshold of star formation of 10@xmath55 cm@xmath15 @xcite .",
