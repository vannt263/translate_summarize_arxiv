    "the anti - correlation between the equivalent widths of broad emission lines and agn luminosity ( the `` baldwin effect '' ; hereinafter be ) was first discovered by baldwin ( 1977 ) for the civ @xmath01549  broad emission line in high redshift agns .",
    "it was initially hoped to be able to use the effect to calibrate the agn luminosity to be able to use agns as cosmological standard candles ( baldwin et al .",
    "1978 ) , but the large dispersion of this relationship rendered this impossible ( baldwin et al .",
    "1989 ; zamorani et al . 1992 ) .",
    "the be is now well established for nearly all broad emission lines and the slope of the be steepens with increasing ionization potential ( zheng & malkan 1993 ; dietrich et al .",
    "several mechanisms have been proposed to explain this effect ( see shields 2007 for a review ) . among these",
    "perhaps the most widely accepted one is that the ionizing continuum softens with increasing luminosity so there are relatively fewer ionizing photons for broad emission line formation in high - luminosity agns .",

    "be slope relationship is nv @xmath01240 , which has an ionization energy of 97.7ev but shows no be at all ( dietrich et al .",
    "it has been proposed that this can be explained by a dependence of metallicity on agn luminosity , which in turn is a combination of eddington ratio ( @xmath2 ) and black hole mass ( korista et al .",

    "possible reasons for this are discussed in section 4.1 .",
    "it is well known that the nlr is stratified that the high - ionization lines rise from the inner part of the nlr while low - ionization lines rise further away ( see , for example , veilleux et al .",

    "the central electron temperature , density , and ionization parameter are , in general , higher in seyfert 1s than in seyfert 2s ( gaskell 1984 ; schmitt 1998 ; bennert et al .",
    "the lines of lower critical density are not as strong near the nuclei as the higher critical density lines .",
    "a possible explanation of this is that the change in critical density marks a transition between difference types of clouds . to see",
    "if this is a factor in the nlr be we therefore plot the ews against critical density in the right panel of fig .",
    "2 using the same symbols of panel ( a ) . we again fail to find any correlation in this plot ( @xmath45 using a spearman rank correlation analysis ) .",
    "using our sample of 3677 radio - quiet agns from sdss dr4 that have little contamination by host galaxy , we find that , in contrast with the be of broad emission lines , the narrow lines show a nearly constant be slope irrespective of ionization potential or critical density .",
    "the [ oii ] @xmath03727 , [ nii ] @xmath06583  and h@xmath19  lines show significantly different be slopes from other lines .",
    "although the slope of different lines cluster around -0.2 , we do find some lines that show large deviations .",
    "firstly , [ nii ] @xmath06583  show a much flatter slope ( @xmath42 ) than other lines ( @xmath46 5% in two - sided ks test , meaning if the two samples are drawn from the same distribution , we expect to see a difference as large or larger than we see here only 5 in 100 times . ) . this flattening was also found for nv @xmath01240 , which has an ionization potential of 77.7 ev but no be .",
    "one plausible explanation of a weaker or absent be for the nitrogen lines is that the increase of metallicity in brighter agn will enhance nitrogen abundance relative to carbon , oxygen etc .",
    ", because nitrogen is a secondary element whose abundance scale as @xmath47 .",
    "this trend could compensate for the decrease of ew in higher - luminosity sources thus making the be slope flatter .",
    "this explanation is supported by a number of recent studies .",
    "the metallicities of the blr ( hamann & ferland 1993 ; nagao et al . 2006a ; juarez et al .",
    "2009 ) and nlr ( e.g. , nagao et al . 2006b",
    "; matsuoka et al . 2009 ) are both found to correlate with the luminosity of the agn .",

    "slope relationship for the same reason , lie on it ( dietrich et al .",
    "2002 ) . despite this serious problem to be resolved , occam s razor suggests that an enhanced abundance in high - luminosity agns is the simplest and most plausible explanation of the flatter be slope of [ nii ] @xmath06583 .",
    "the second significant deviation from a be slope of -0.2 is the steep slopes of h@xmath19  and [ oii ] @xmath03727 . both of these are star formation ( sf ) indicators in star - forming galaxies ( kenicutt et al .",
    "1998 , ho 2005 ) and their ew may reach several hundred   in starburst galaxies .",
    "so even though the agns we selected show no absorption feature in the continuum , the emission lines are still possible subject to sf contamination because of their large ew . in low - luminosity sources",
    "whose continuum is low , the emission line from sf may contribute significantly to the total line flux , and thus enhance the ew . in type-2 agns , the sf contribution of h@xmath19  is estimated to be more than 60% ( brinchmann et al .",
    "the h@xmath1  emitting region of type-1 agns , however , may have a higher fraction of the emission originating with the agn ( zhang et al .",
    "2008 ) but still be heavily influenced by sf .",
    "furthermore , a variety of studies have established a correlation between the strength of agn activity and star formation in the local universe ( e.g. , rowan - robinson 1995 ; croom et al . 2002 ; netzer et al .",
    "2007 , 2009 ; shao et al . 2010 ) .",
    "the steepest correlation is @xmath49 ( netzer 2009 ) meaning @xmath50 , a be slope steeper than -0.2 .",
    "so it makes sense that the sf in host galaxies would steepen the be slopes of h@xmath19  and [ oii ] @xmath03727 .",
    "however , the [ oii ] @xmath03727  and h@xmath19  bes can not be attributed entirely to sf  agn relationship . for a plausible range of ionization parameters , densities , and ionizing spectra ,",
    "the intensity of [ oii ] @xmath03727  is proportional to that of [ oiii ] @xmath05007  ( 10% - 30% , ferland & osterbrock 1986 ; ho et al .",
    "1993a , 1993b ) . since [ oiii ]",
    "@xmath05007shows a significant be , [ oii ] @xmath03727  is unlikely to show a radically different trend .",
    "so it is safe to conclude that the [ oii ] @xmath03727  and h@xmath19  be could be partly ( but not totally ) produced by sf contamination .    a third effect we can see in fig .",
    "1 is the optical continuum getting bluer towards higher luminosity .",
    "this would leverage the continuum and lower the ew if the line flux remains unchanged .",
    "this could arise if the nlr sees a filtered spectral - energy distribution ( sed ) ( kraemer et al .",
    "1998 ; groves et al .",
    "2004a , b ) so that a change in the ionizing spectrum of an agn would not change the sed the nlr sees much .",
    "the [ nev ] @xmath03425 , [ oii ] @xmath03727  and [ neiii ] @xmath03870  lines are most likely to be influenced by a continuum shape difference effect because of their shorter wavelength .",
    "a possible explanation of the bluer color of the uv - optical sed is the anisotropy of the continuum emission . because the accretion disc is optically thick , we will see a dimmer continuum when viewing it edge - on .",
    "( this is the combined result of the @xmath51 projection effect and the disk equivalent of `` limb darkening '' . )",
    "we could also preferentially be seeing the inner , high - temperature part of the disc when viewing face - on .",
    "these effects will combine to give a higher observed luminosity with a face - on viewing angle .",
    "the reddening of spectrum depends on viewing angle too ( keel 1980 ; de zotti & gaskell 1985 ; zhang et al . 2008 ) .",
    "gaskell et al .",
    "( 2004 ) used radio orientations to get agn reddening curves and found the continuum shape is profoundly affected by reddening for all but the bluest agns . because of these effects sources with small inclination would both show large luminosity and have low reddening .",
    "an alternative explanation of continuum shape difference is host galaxy contamination .",
    "shen et al . (",
    "2011 ) made composite spectra of different @xmath15  luminosity bins and found that the uv part of all the composite spectra are similar while the optical part flatten with decreasing luminosity .",
    "they interpreted this trend as due to host galaxy contamination in the optical region of the spectrum in low - luminosity agns .",
    "similar argument is given by stern & laor et al .",
    "( 2012a ) .",
    "even though we have rejected objects with significant stellar light contributions , weak absorption lines can be spotted on the final composite spectrum of the lowest luminosity bin because of its extremely high signal to noise ratio .",
    "our data can not distinguish different mechanisms that give rise to the continuum shape difference , and this is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "after correcting the deviations listed above , our conclusion that the slopes of be for different narrow lines are nearly constant is further strengthened .",
    "it has been argued on both observational and theoretical grounds that there is a softening of the ionizing continuum with increasing luminosity ( see , for example , binette et al . 1989 ; netzer , laor , & gondhalekar 1992 ; zheng & malkan 1993 ; wang & lu 1998 ; korista et al .",
    "if this is indeed the case , an important prediction of this is the ionization potential  be slope relationship ( korista et al .",
    "it is successful in explaining the broad line be , but a major failing is that it fails to explain the constant be slope of narrow lines .",

    "( 2004a , b ) proposed a nlr model where dust regulates the incident ionizing spectrum so as to keep the ionization parameter in the nlr constant . in this model ,",
    "variation of the sed is filtered by dust in the nlr and thus the continuum shape seen by the nlr is dominated by the effect of the dust rather than by intrinsic changes in the sed .",
    "this leads to more stable conditions in the nlr .",
    "this could be the cause of the lack of a dependence of the slope of the be on the ionization energy .",
    "a luminosity - dependent covering factor is a natural explanation of both a blr and nlr be .",
    "however , to explain the ionization dependence , the variation in covering factor must have a different dependence for lines of different ionizations .",
    "this would not be a surprise for the blr since there is strong radial ionization stratification and the highest ionization lines are an order of magnitude closer to the black hole than the lowest ionization lines ( see gaskell 2009 for a review ) .",
    "shields , ferland , & peterson ( 1995 ) suggested that the broad - line be could be caused by a luminosity - dependent covering factor for clouds that are optically - thin to photons with wavelength less than 912 . the optically - thin clouds which have small column densities , preferentially emit high - ionization lines .",
    "however , comparison of line profiles shows that the blr be is due to changes in the _ low velocity _ blr gas ( francis et al .",
    "1992 ) rather than changes in the very broad component .",
    "furthermore , snedden & gaskell ( 2007 ) argued that optically - thin gas does _ not _ make a substantial contribution to the blr .",
    "nevertheless , given the strong radial ionization stratification of the blr , and the decreasing covering factor with ionization ( e.g. , francis et al . 1992 ) , an additional luminosity - dependence of the covering factor could explain the be and why the high - ionization lines should show a steeper slope than low - ionization lines . while this could be consistent with the blr , it is not obvious how such an explanation can be reconciled with the lack of an ionization - dependence we find here for the be .",
    "the nlr size is correlated with the luminosity of an agn as @xmath52 ( bennert et al .",
    "2002 ; schmitt et al . 2003b ; bennert et al .",
    "2006a , b ; greene et al . 2011 ) .",
    "so in high - luminosity agns , the nlr may possibly turn from ionization - bounded to matter - bounded , and the luminosity of narrow lines would cease increasing with agn luminosity .",
    "this model could in principle explain part of the be of nlr ( croom et al .",
    "2002 ) but it would be too rash a conclusion that it is the origin of the be because the bulk of the nlr emission originates from within the central few tens or hundreds of pc ( schmitt et al .",
    "2003a ) so is unlikely to exceed the scale of the galactic bulge .",
    "besides , the nlr has no natural size because it has no definite edge , so some cut in surface brightness or line - ratio is needed to define the size ( schmitt et al .",
    "2003b ; bennert et al .",
    "2006a , b ; greene et al . 2011 ) .",
    "this makes the interpretation of size complicated .",
    "netzer et al .",
    "( 2004 ) argue that that @xmath52 is theoretically sound yet this relationship must break down for @xmath53 exceeding a few kpc .",
    "they found that high-@xmath36 agns have nlr sizes no larger than 10kpc .",
    "it is also well known that the the nlr is stratified so that the high - ionization lines rise from the inner part of nlr while low - ionization lines from further away ( veilleux et al .",
    "1995 ; bennert et al .",
    "2006a , b ) .",
    "so the `` disappearing nlr effect '' , if exists , could preferentially influence low - ionization and low - critical density lines .",
    "this again stands against the constant slope we find .",
    "because different lines all seem to share a similar be slope , it is natural to think that it might be the continuum , rather than the emission lines , which is the cause .",
    "jiang et al . ( 2006 ) proposed that the continuum variation can produce a weak be ( @xmath54 ) if the light - crossing time for the region emitting narrow @xmath55 exceeds the variability timescale for the x - ray continuum and the amplitude of variability anti - correlates with the luminosity .",
    "shu et al . ( 2012 ) found a strong anti - correlation between the ew of the narrow @xmath55 line and @xmath56 ( @xmath57 ( where @xmath58 means time - averaged values ) consistent with the x - ray be expected in an individual agn if the narrow - line flux remains constant while the continuum varies . for a nlr",
    "whose light - crossing time is about @xmath59 yr , the narrow - line luminosity can safely be assumed to be constant .",
    "the amplitude of variability of the ionizing continuum can be obtained from the monitoring of agns after correction for the constant host galaxy light contribution .",
    "as is well known , the amplitude of variability of an agn increases with time .",
    "this can be most readily seen from the structure functions of agns ( the variance as a function of time interval between observations ) .",
    "we are interested in variability on the longest timescales ( timescales similar to the nlr light - crossing time ) .",
    "we do not , of course , have monitoring on such long timescales , but we can estimate the amplitude from structure functions .",
    "cid fernandez et al .",
    "( 2000 ) have presented structure functions for bright agns .",
    "these are all consistent with the amplitude of variability rising as the time interval increases to a characteristic time of a year or a few years and then remaining constant .",
    "collier & peterson ( 2001 ) got a similar result for lower - luminosity agns ( but with a shorter characteristic time ) and also find that the forms of the uv structure functions are similar to the optical ones .",
    "there are indications that the structure function increases gradually on much longer timescales , but data on this part of the structure function are limited . observed variability thus gives a lower limit to variability on the light - crossing timescale of the nlr .    in order to minimize the host galaxy light contribution one needs to go to as short a wavelength as possible",
    "this means using @xmath60-band observations or space ultraviolet observations .",
    "for example , for ngc  4151 merkulova ( 2006 ) found an _ observed _ peak - to - peak @xmath60-band amplitude of a factor of 7.5 .",
    "uv variability can be a lot larger .",
    "for example , the peak - to - peak amplitude at 1300  for fairall 9 is a factor of 25 ( koratkar & gaskell 1989 ) .",
    "inspection of the results of long - term uv monitoring of a number of agns with the _ iue _ satellite ( koratkar & gaskell 1989 , koratkar & gaskell 1991a , b , clavel et al .",
    "1991 , and obrien et al .",
    "1998 ) give a median uv peak - to - peak variability of a factor of 7 , but the upper quartile is a factor of 13 . after correction for host - galaxy light , the amplitudes of optical variability are similarly large .",
    "for example , the ngc 4151 photometry of lyuty & doroshenko ( 1999 ) gives a peak - to - peak amplitude of a factor of about 25 to 30 .",
    "continuum anisotropy ( wang & lu 1999 ) can produce an effect similar to that caused by the actual variability of the continuum .",
    "it was recently found by risaliti et al .",
    "( 2011 ) that the optically - thick disc emission responsible for the continuum and isotropic [ oiii]emission will produce the ew([oiii ] ) distribution very well .",
    "variability and continuum anisotropy are , in practice , indistinguishable , so we can consider them together .",
    "we made monte - carlo simulations to explore whether continuum variability can explain the be slope . in a flux - limited survey",
    ", the luminosity will show an approximately log - normal distribution .",
    "we generated an artificial sample of sources with a similar distribution of @xmath15  as the observed agn sample ( 0.35  dex here ) .",
    "we set the ew of the artificial - sources to be the mean ew of the whole sample , and we add a gaussian of 0.22  dex to the ew to account for the intrinsic dispersion .",
    "uv and optical agn variability is approximately log - normal ",
    "i.e. , it looks normal when plotted in magnitudes ( see gaskell 2004 for a discussion of log - normal variation of agns ) .",
    "the continuum variation was simulated by adding a gaussian with @xmath61 ( 0.18  dex ) to the continuum while the emission line flux was kept unchanged .",
    "this is an over - simplification , but it can help us to gain some insight into the effect that continuum variability brings .",
    "we generated 4000 sources in each round and measured the slope of be using the 4000 sources .",
    "an example of the simulation is shown in fig .",
    "4 . with a peak - to - peak continuum variation of a factor of three",
    ", the simulation can produce a be slope of @xmath62 while a factor of six variation produces a be slope of @xmath63 .",
    "the simulated distribution of ew-@xmath15  can be seen to be very similar to what is observed .",
    "obviously , this model will produce a similar slope for every narrow line if the continuum change with similar amplitude in the wavelength range we concern .",
    "it should be noted that due to variation in continuum slope , not all lines show the same be slope , but depends on wavelength .",
    "we assume a constant narrow line flux during the continuum variability .",
    "this is an approximation for the continuum variations on time scales of much shorter than the light travel time over the nlr because at such short time scale , the nlr has little response to the continuum variations . for variations on",
    "longer time scales , one needs to properly convolve the continuum variations with the response of emission lines ( transfer function ) . by considering the latter response",
    ", the variations of equivalent width will be somewhat smaller , but this is equivalent to requiring a somewhat larger continuum variability amplitude .",
    "conversely , since continuum variability or the equivalent of continuum variability will inevitably produce a be , the be slope we observe could give an upper - limit on the few @xmath64yrs to @xmath59yrs variability of agn optical continuum .",
    "if the variability amplitudes exceed the factor of three a steeper be will emerge .",
    "this might seem at first sight to be at variance with the amplitudes of uv variability and structure functions observed , but it must be remembered that the equivalent width is the ratio of the line flux to the _ observed _ optical continuum and the observed continuum has a substantial starlight contamination .",
    "an example of how the apparent continuum variability is substantially less than the real variability is shown in fig .  4 of gaskell et al ( 2008 ) .",
    "host galaxy light limits the apparent peak - to - peak continuum variability to about a factor of three ( i.e. , a rms variability of a few tenths of a magnitude ) .",
    "this is just what is observed for the pg agns studied by cid fernandez et al .",
    "since the structure functions are relatively flat after a year or so ( cid fernandez et al . 2000 ) , the variability effect on the be should be apparent in a few years .",
    "an obvious test of this is to reobserve agns after a few years .      in summary",
    ", the combination of a 50% variation of @xmath15and a log - normal distribution of luminosity will naturally produce a -0.20 slope of be for every narrow line , as we observe .",
    "the model we employ is obviously an oversimplification . to make a more realistic model , we need a dedicated treatment of sample selection effects and to make a more realistic assumption of the variability including amplitude , variation form , and their dependence on wavelength etc , about the light curve . despite these simplifications , our results do show that continuum variation will inevitably produce a similar be for each narrow line .",
    "meanwhile , while the model predicts the same be slope for each narrow line , the differences in slope are still significant due to the small error bars .",
    "there must therefore be some additional factor at work .",
    "it has been shown in fig .  3 that the differences do not correlate with the ionization potential or critical density , so there must be other factors taking effect . a deeper exploration of other factors like ionization slope",
    ", nlr geometry and a more realistic model are needed to make progress , but these are beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "we have constructed a sample of 3677 @xmath65 radio - quiet agns from sloan digital survey data release 4 that span three orders of magnitude in luminosity to explore the relationship between equivalent width of narrow lines and @xmath15 .",
    "we have computed composite spectra for each @xmath15  bin to enhance the s / n ratio .",
    "h@xmath17 and h@xmath66  as well as feiiwere subtracted to get an accurate measurement of narrow emission lines and continuum .",
    "we find that most narrow lines show a similar be slope of about -0.2 while the large deviation of [ nii ] @xmath06583 , [ oii ] @xmath03727 , h@xmath19  and [ nev ] @xmath03425  might be explained by a metallicity effect , sf contamination , or the uv - optical continuum difference .",
    "the slope does not show any correlation with ionization energy and critical density .",
    "we propose that the combination of a 50% variation of the continuum near 5100  and a log - normal distribution of observed luminosity distribution will naturally produce a -0.2 slope of be for every narrow line .",
