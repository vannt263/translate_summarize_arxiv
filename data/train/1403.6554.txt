    "the cantor ternary set is the best example of a _ perfect nowhere - dense _ set in the real line .",
    "it was constructed by george cantor in 1883 , see @xcite , nevertheless it was not the first perfect nowhere - dense set in the real line to be constructed .",
    "the first construction was done by the a british mathematician henry j. s. smith in 1875 , and vito volterra , still a graduate student in italy , also showed how to construct such a set in 1881 . due to cantor s prestige , the cantor ternary set was ( and still is ) the typical example of a perfect nowhere - dense set .",
    "following d. bresoud @xcite we will refer as the smith - volterra - cantor sets or @xmath0 sets to the family of examples of perfect , nowhere - dense sets exemplified by the work of smith , voterra and cantor . in the present paper we will discuss construction of several perfect nowhere - dense set in the real line .",
    "most of them variations in one way or the other of the construction of the cantor ternary set .",
    "thus , it is important to review in detail the construction of the cantor ternary set @xmath1 .",
    "+      @xmath1 is obtained from the closed interval @xmath2 $ ] by a sequence of deletions of open intervals known as  middle thirds \" .",
    "we begin with the interval @xmath2 $ ] , let us call it @xmath3 , and remove the middle third , leaving us with leaving us with the union of two closed intervals of length @xmath4 @xmath5   \\cup \\left[\\frac{2}{3 } , 1\\right ] .\\ ] ] now we remove the middle third from each of these intervals , leaving us with the union of four closed intervals of length @xmath6 @xmath7 \\cup \\left[\\frac{2}{9},\\frac{1}{3}\\right ] \\cup\\left[\\frac{2}{3},\\frac{7}{9}\\right ] \\cup\\left[\\frac{8}{9},1\\right ] .\\ ] ] then we remove the middle third of each of these intervals leaving us with eight intervals of length @xmath8 .",
    "we continue this process inductively , then for each @xmath9 we get a set @xmath10 which is the union of @xmath11 closed intervals of length @xmath12 . this iterative construction is illustrated in the following figure , for the first four steps :        finally , we define the _ cantor ternary set _ @xmath1 as the intersection @xmath13    clearly @xmath14 , since trivially @xmath15 .",
    "moreover @xmath1 is a a closed set , being the countable intersection of close sets , and trivially bounded , since it is a subset of @xmath2 $ ] .",
    "therefore @xmath1 is a compact set .",
    "moreover , observe by the construction that if @xmath16 is the end point of some closed subinterval of a given @xmath10 then it is also the end point of some of the subintervals of @xmath17 .",
    "because at each stage , endpoints are never removed , it follows that @xmath18 for all @xmath19 .",
    "thus @xmath1 contains all the end points of all the intervals that make up each of the sets @xmath10 ( or alternatively , the endpoints to the intervals removed ) all of which are rational ternary numbers in @xmath2 $ ] , i.e. numbers of the form @xmath20 . but",
    "@xmath1 contains much more than that ; actually it is an uncountable set since it is a _",
    "perfect set_. to prove that simply observe that every point of @xmath1 is approachable arbitrarily closely by the endpoints of the intervals removed ( thus for any @xmath21 and for each @xmath22 there is an endpoint , let us call it @xmath23 , such that @xmath24 ) .",
    "@xmath1 is a _ nowhere - dense _ set , that is , there are no intervals included in @xmath1 . the easiest way to prove that is using an alternative characterization of @xmath1",
    "consider the ternary representation for @xmath25,$ ] there are two possible ternary expansions , since @xmath26 similarly , for the dyadic rational numbers @xmath27 there are two possible dyadic expansions as @xmath28 thus for the uniqueness of the dyadic and the ternary representations we will take the infinite expansions representations for the dyadic and ternary rational numbers . ]    @xmath29    observe that removing the elements where at least one of the @xmath30 is equal to one is the same as removing the middle third in the iterative construction , thus the cantor ternary set is the set of numbers in @xmath2 $ ] that can be written in base 3 without using the digit 1 , i.e. @xmath31 : x = \\sum_{k=1}^\\infty \\frac{\\varepsilon_k(x)}{3^k } , \\quad \\varepsilon_k(x)=0 , 2 \\quad \\mbox{for all } \\ ; k = 1 , 2 , \\cdots   \\right\\}.\\ ] ]    taking two arbitrary points in @xmath1 we can always find a number between them that requires the digit 1 in its ternary representation , and therefore there are no intervals included in @xmath1 . surprisingly , it can be proved that , except for @xmath32 , every point in @xmath2 $ ] can be obtained as a midpoint of two point in @xmath1 , see @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , observe that for each @xmath33 the set @xmath34 : t= \\sum_{k=1}^n \\frac{\\varepsilon_k}{3^k } ,   \\quad \\mbox{with } \\ ; \\varepsilon_k=0 , 2 \\quad",
    "\\mbox{for all } \\ ; k = 1 , 2 , \\cdots , n   \\right\\}\\ ] ] are precisely the left endpoints of the subintervals of @xmath35 , and therefore @xmath35 can be represented as , @xmath36.\\ ] ]    also using this characterization of @xmath1 we can get a direct proof that it is uncountable . define the mapping @xmath37 $ ] for @xmath38 , as @xmath39    it is clear that @xmath40 is one - to - one correspondence from @xmath1 to @xmath2 $ ] ( observe that as @xmath41 then @xmath42 ) .    finally , @xmath1 has measure zero , since @xmath43 ) - m(c^c ) = 1 - \\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \\frac{2^{n-1}}{3^n } = 1 -\\frac{1}{3 }   \\sum_{n=0}^\\infty ( \\frac{2}{3})^{n } = 1 -   \\frac{1/3}{1- 2/3}=1 - 1=0.\\ ] ]    observe that @xmath1 can then be obtained by removing a fixed proportion ( one third ) of each subinterval in each of the iterative steps , by removing the length @xmath44 from each subinterval in the @xmath45step , or removing the digit one of the ternary expansion .",
    "of course these three constructions are equivalent .",
    "nevertheless , the first construction , removing a fixed proportion of each subinterval in each of the iterative steps , give us another important property of the cantor set , its self - similarity across scales , this is illustrated in the following figure :          we can extend the function defined in ( [ cantorfun ] ) to a function defined on @xmath2 $ ] . for @xmath25 $ ] written in",

    "also h. lebesgue considered it in his work on integration in 1904 , and for that reason it is sometimes refers as _ lebesgue singular function_. finally , it is also known with a more descriptive name as the _ devil s",
    "staircase_.    moreover , if @xmath51 is the left endpoint of the subinterval of @xmath52 containing @xmath53 , then @xmath54    observe also that if @xmath55 @xmath56 thus @xmath49 is constant on the open subintervals @xmath57 which are those that are removed on the @xmath58-step .",
    "also , from this construction it is easy to see that @xmath40 is monotone non - decreasing .",
    "+ there is also an iterative construction for the cantor function , that allows us to get the properties of @xmath49 easily .",
    "@xmath59 and for @xmath60 @xmath61 observe that , similar to removing middle thirds in the construction of @xmath1 , the cantor ternary set , the middle thirds are made constant in the iterative construction of the cantor function .",
    "also @xmath62 is a monotone non - decreasing continuous function for all @xmath60 .",
    "it can be proved that , if @xmath63    @xmath64.\\ ] ] by the cauchy criterion for uniform convergence , we conclude that @xmath65 converges uniformly .",
    "then @xmath49 is a monotone non - decreasing continuous function on @xmath2 $ ] . finally observe that @xmath49 is constant in all the intervals that are removed in the construction of @xmath1 , @xmath66 and @xmath67 so increases only in the cantor set , thus @xmath49 is a _ singular function _",
    "i.e. @xmath68 a.e .",
    "it can be proved that @xmath49 is the unique uniformly real - valued function on @xmath2 $ ] such that @xmath69 for the proof of this result and several other interesting results about the cantor function , see an extensive study on it at @xcite .",
    "also , the cantor function can be characterized as the only monotone increasing function on @xmath2 $ ] such that @xmath70 and @xmath71 see @xcite .",
    "illustration of some iteration of the construction of the cantor function @xmath49 is given in the following figure ,",
    "in this section we are going to consider several variations and generalizations of the cantor set , of course all of them are bounded , perfect , nowhere - dense sets . but first , it is interesting to observe that all the nowhere - dense perfect sets are constructed in a similar form as the cantor sets as the following result shows , see @xcite . for completeness the proof of it is included .",
    "if @xmath72 is a bounded , perfect , nowhere - dense , non - empty set , a = @xmath73 , b = @xmath74 , then there is a countable collection of open intervals contained in @xmath75 $ ] such that @xmath72 is the derived set ( i.e. the set of all accumulation points ) of the set of the endpoints of these intervals .",
    "since @xmath72 is perfect , it is closed thus @xmath76 . then @xmath77 $ ] , its complement in @xmath78 $ ] , is relative open , and therefore it is a countable union of open intervals . since each point of @xmath72",
    "is an accumulation point of @xmath72 , @xmath79 can not be a left endpoint of one of these open intervals nor can @xmath80 be a right endpoint of one of these open intervals .",
    "if @xmath77 $ ] consisted of only finitely many intervals , then @xmath72 would contain a closed interval of positive length .",
    "since @xmath72 is nowhere - dense , the number of intervals in @xmath77 $ ] must be countably infinite .",
    "now we will show that @xmath72 is the set of all accumulation points of the set of the endpoints of the disjoint open intervals whose union is @xmath77 $ ] .",
    "let @xmath81 be an enumeration of these disjoint open intervals .",
    "for the intervals @xmath82 , let @xmath83 and @xmath84 be the left and right endpoints , respectively .",
    "the set of endpoints is contained in @xmath72 , and , since @xmath72 is perfect , its derived set it is also in @xmath72 . since @xmath72 is a nowhere - dense set , we know that is closure @xmath85 does not contain any open interval .",
    "thus if @xmath86 every neighborhood of @xmath87 has a nonempty intersection with at least one of the intervals @xmath82 and therefore an endpoint of this interval is in the neighborhood of @xmath87 .",
    "it follows that @xmath87 is an accumulation point for the set of endpoints , and , therefore , @xmath72 is the derived set of endpoints .",
    "let us start discussing generalizations of the cantor set .",
    "observe that due to the previous theorem since all these constructions are obtained by removing a countable number of open intervals from the interval @xmath2 $ ] they are bounded , perfect , nowhere - dense , non - empty sets .",
    "+ in @xcite , d. bresoud considers the following family of examples of perfect , nowhere - dense sets .",
    "the set @xmath72 is said to be a _",
    "smith - volterra - cantor _ set or simply an @xmath0 set , if it is constructed by starting with a closed interval and removing an open subinterval .",
    "one then removes an open interval from each of the remaining subintervals and continue through an infinite sequences of such removals , choosing the subintervals that are removed such that every open subinterval of the original set overlaps with at least one of the subintervals that are removed .",
    "the @xmath0 set @xmath72 is the intersection of the countably infinite collection of sets that remain after each iteration .",
    "observe that , by construction , @xmath72 is a perfect and nowhere - dense set . + a particular family of @xmath0 sets is defined , for each @xmath88 , as the @xmath89 set .",
    "they are constructed by removing , in the @xmath90 step of the iteration , an open interval of length @xmath91 from the center of each of the remaining closed intervals .",
    "observe that @xmath92 is precisely the cantor ternary set .",
    "another important case is @xmath93 , which was considered by volterra as he constructed his famous counter - example of a function with bounded derivative that exists everywhere but the derivative is not riemann integrable in any closed and bounded interval , see @xcite chapter 4 .",
    "the @xmath89 sets are also perfect sets and the measure of each is @xmath94)-m(svc(n)^{c } ) = 1- \\frac{1}{n } - \\frac{2}{n^2 } - \\frac{4}{n^3 } - \\cdots = 1- \\frac{1}{n } \\frac{1}{1 - 2/n } = \\frac{n-3}{n-2}.\\ ] ]    thus the @xmath89 sets have positive measure , and moreover they can have measure very close to one , but nevertheless they are nowhere - dense .",
    "for this reason they are called _ fat cantor sets_. +      another type of fat cantor set can be found in the literature , see @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "take @xmath96 and repeat the construction of @xmath1 with the following modification . at the @xmath90 step , instead of taking out an open interval of length @xmath44 from the center of each of the @xmath97 intervals of equal length , take out an open interval of length @xmath98 to obtain @xmath99 ( @xmath100 in @xcite ) .",

    "+ finally , one of the most important results in @xcite is the computation of hausdorff dimension of cantor - like sets determined by two sequences , see collorary 4 , page 202 in this paper , see also @xcite . using this result we can compute the hausdorff dimension of several of the cantor - like sets considered above :    * for the ternary cantor set , since @xmath215 @xmath216 and @xmath217 , for all @xmath230 then as @xmath231 and therefore , @xmath232 * for the @xmath95fat cantor sets , since @xmath215 @xmath216 and @xmath233 for all @xmath230 then as @xmath234 and therefore , we get the well known value , @xmath235 * for the middle@xmath107 cantor sets , since @xmath215 @xmath216 and @xmath223 for all @xmath230 then as @xmath236 and therefore , @xmath237 * for the generalized middle@xmath118 cantor sets , since @xmath215 @xmath216 and @xmath225 for all @xmath230 then as @xmath238 and therefore , @xmath239 * for the generalized @xmath227 sets , since @xmath215 @xmath216 and @xmath228 , \\ ] ] for all @xmath230 then as @xmath240 } { \\frac{1}{2^{n-1 } } ( 1-\\beta ) -\\frac{\\alpha \\beta}{2^{n-2}}\\left[\\frac{1-(2\\alpha)^{n-2}}{1 - 2\\alpha}\\right ] } =    \\lim_{n\\rightarrow \\infty } \\frac { ( 1-\\beta ) -2\\alpha \\beta \\left[\\frac{1-(2\\alpha)^{n-1}}{1 - 2\\alpha}\\right ] } { 2 ( 1-\\beta ) -4\\alpha \\beta\\left[\\frac{1-(2\\alpha)^{n-2}}{1 - 2\\alpha}\\right ] } \\\\ & = & \\frac { ( 1-\\beta ) - \\left[\\frac{2\\alpha \\beta}{1 - 2\\alpha}\\right ] } { 2 ( 1-\\beta ) -\\left[\\frac{4\\alpha \\beta}{1 - 2\\alpha}\\right ] } = \\frac{1}{2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and therefore , @xmath241    observe , from the examples above , that when the cantor - like sets have positive measure their hausdorff dimensions are one .",
    "observe that for each of the cantor - like sets considered in the previous section we can construct iteratively a _ cantor - like function _ , such that for the @xmath58-step @xmath62 is a continuous , monotone , non - decreasing function , @xmath242 and such that @xmath62 is constant in the in the @xmath243 open subintervals removed in that step .",
