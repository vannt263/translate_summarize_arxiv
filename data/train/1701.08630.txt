    "recently , the understanding of many - body quantum systems has dramatically progressed .",
    "nowadays we are achieving an amazing degree of control over larger and larger systems  @xcite .",
    "therefore , verification during each stage of experimental procedures is of utmost importance ; quantum tomography is the appropriate tool for that purpose .",
    "the goal of quantum tomography is to reconstruct the state of a system by performing multiple measurements on identically prepared copies of the system .",
    "once the experimental data are extracted , a numerical procedure determines which density matrix fits best the measurements .",
    "this estimation can be performed using different approaches , such as maximum likelihood estimation  @xcite , or bayesian methods  @xcite .",
    "however , tomography becomes harder as we explore more intricate systems .",
    "if we look at the simple , yet illustrative case of @xmath0 qubits , which will serve as the consistent thread in this paper , one has to make at least @xmath1 measurements in different bases before one can claim to know everything about an _ a priori _ unknown system .",
    "with such an exponential scaling in the number of qubits , it is clear that current methods rapidly become intractable for present state - of - the - art experiments .    as a result , more sophisticated tomographical techniques are called for .",
    "new protocols try to simplify the process by making an educated guess about the nature of the state .",
    "among other assumptions , this includes rank deficiency  @xcite , extra symmetries  @xcite , or gaussianity  @xcite .",
    "while all these approaches are extremely efficient , their pitfall is that when the starting guess is inaccurate , they produce significant systematic errors .    here , we pursue a different approach , inspired by a notion from statistical mechanics : coarse graining  @xcite .",
    "this operation transforms a probability density in phase space into a `` coarse - grained '' density that is a piecewise constant function , a result of density averaging in cells .",
    "this is the chief idea behind the renormalization group  @xcite , which allows a systematic investigation of the changes of a physical system as viewed at different scales .    in our case",
    ", we consider a system of qubits and look at the associated phase space , which turns out to be a discrete grid of @xmath2 points .",
    "we assign to each suitably defined line in phase space a specific rank - one projection operator representing a pure quantum state . for each point of the grid ,",
    "a suitable quasi - probability as the wigner function can be directly computed from the measurement of the states associated with the lines passing through that point .",
    "we coarse grain by combining groups of these lines into thick lines , which we will show to be lines in the phase space of an effectively smaller system .",
    "our coarse - grained phase spaces are endowed with many nice properties .",
    "most notably , our procedure systematically and naturally reveals a subset of measurements which one could use to perform incomplete tomography .",
    "in addition , using the coarse - grained points and lines , we show that one can define a discrete wigner function in largely the same way as it is defined in the original space . when plotted , the coarse functions resemble smoothed out versions of the originals , preserving many of their prominent visual features .",
    "a qubit is a two - dimensional quantum system , with hilbert space isomorphic to @xmath3 .",
    "it is customary to choose two normalized orthogonal states , say @xmath4 , as a computational basis .",
    "the unitary matrices @xmath5 generate the pauli group @xmath6 , which consists of all the pauli matrices plus the identity , with multiplicative factors @xmath7  @xcite .    for @xmath0 qubits ,",
    "the corresponding hilbert space is the tensor product @xmath8 .",
    "a compact way of labeling both states and elements of the corresponding pauli group @xmath9 is by using the finite field @xmath10 . in appendix",
    "[ sec : galois ] we briefly summarize the basic notions of finite fields needed to proceed .",
    "let @xmath11 , @xmath12 , be an orthonormal basis in the hilbert space @xmath13 ( henceforth , field elements will be denoted by greek letters ) .",
    "the elements of the basis can be labeled by powers of a primitive element @xmath14 ( i.e. , a root of an irreducible primitive polynomial ) : @xmath15 .",
    "now the equivalent version of ( [ eq : sigmas ] ) is  @xcite @xmath16 so that @xmath17 which is the discrete counterpart of the weyl - heisenberg algebra for continuous variables  @xcite . here",
    ", the additive character @xmath18 is defined as @xmath19 $ ] and the trace of a field element ( we distinguish it from the trace of an operator by the lower case `` tr '' ) is defined in appendix  [ sec : galois ] .",
    "moreover , @xmath20 and @xmath21 are related through the finite fourier transform  @xcite @xmath22 so that @xmath23 .",
    "the operators ( [ xzgf ] ) generate the pauli group @xmath9 of @xmath0 qubits and , with a suitable choice of basis , they can be factorized into a tensor product of single - qubit pauli operators . to this end , it is convenient to consider @xmath10 as an @xmath0-dimensional linear space over @xmath24 .",
    "it is spanned by an abstract basis @xmath25 , so that given a field element @xmath26 the expansion @xmath27 allows us the identification @xmath28 .",
    "the basis @xmath29 can be chosen to be orthonormal with respect to the trace operation ; i.e. , @xmath30 .",
    "this is a self - dual basis , which always exist for the case of qubits . in this way",
    ", we associate each qubit with a particular element of the self - dual basis : qubit@xmath31 . using this basis , we have the factorization @xmath32 where @xmath33 and @xmath34 are the corresponding expansion coefficients for @xmath35 and @xmath36 in the self - dual basis .",
    "we next recall  @xcite that the grid defining the phase space for @xmath0 qubits can be appropriately labeled by the discrete points @xmath37 , which are precisely the indices of the operators @xmath20 and @xmath21 : @xmath35 is the `` horizontal '' axis and @xmath36 the `` vertical '' one . in this grid",
    "we can introduce the set of displacements @xmath38 where @xmath39 is a phase required to avoid plugging extra factors when acting with @xmath40 .",
    "a sensible choice for the case of qubits is @xmath41 , which ensures the hermiticity of the displacement operators .",
    "in addition , we impose @xmath42 and @xmath43 , which means that the displacements along the `` position '' axis @xmath26 and the `` momentum '' axis @xmath44 are not associated with any phase . these displacement operators shift phase space points , so the action of @xmath45 maps @xmath46 , justifying their designation .",
    "note that we still have to fix the sign of the phase @xmath47 .",
    "we choose the phase as @xmath48 where @xmath49 , which ensures that the operators defined in eq .   below are rank - one projections .    on the phase space grid",
    "one can introduce a variety of geometrical structures with much the same properties as in the continuous case  @xcite .",
    "the simplest are the straight lines passing through the origin ( also called rays ) , with equations @xmath50 the rays have a very remarkable property : the monomials @xmath51 belonging to the same ray commute , and thus , have a common system of eigenvectors @xmath52 , @xmath53 where @xmath54 is fixed and @xmath55 is the corresponding eigenvalue , so @xmath56 are eigenstates of @xmath20 ( displacement operators labeled by the ray @xmath57 , which we take as the horizontal axis ) . the projection operators associated with the lines of equal slope are the projections onto these eigenvactors . indeed ,",
    "we have that @xmath58 and , in consequence , they are mutually unbiased bases ( mubs )  @xcite .",
    "now suppose for each ray we disregard the origin @xmath59 , whose monomial is the identity operator .",
    "this leaves us with @xmath60 commuting operators .",
    "if we then consider the whole bundle of @xmath1 rays ( which are obtained by varying the `` slope '' @xmath61 over all of @xmath62 ) , we can construct a complete set of mub operators arranged in a @xmath63 table  @xcite .    to round up the scenario , we need to represent states in phase space .",
    "the discrete wigner function  @xcite is the appropriate tool .",
    "it can be considered as an invertible mapping @xmath64 \\ , ,      \\label{eq : wigdn}\\ ] ] so that @xmath65 the operational kernel is defined as @xmath66 which , in view of equation  ( [ ftcomp ] ) , can be interpreted as a double fourier transform of @xmath67 .",
    "one can check that this kernel has all the good properties  @xcite : it is hermitian , normalized and covariant under the pauli group . as a result , for each point on the grid , the corresponding value of the wigner function can be computed from the probabilities of measuring the pure states associated with the lines passing through that point .",
    "as heralded in the introduction , our goal is to tailor a procedure that allows us to coarse grain the phase space of a multiqubit system ; i.e. , to break it down into simpler sub - components .    to this end",
    ", we consider the number @xmath0 of qubits to be composite , i.e. @xmath68 . let @xmath69 be a basis of @xmath70 with respect to @xmath71 .",
    "we define @xmath72 i.e. , the subspace made of linear combinations of basis elements @xmath73 with coefficients in the base field @xmath74 .",
    "we can use this set @xmath75 , which we henceforth refer to as the initial coset , to decompose the field @xmath70 into cosets : @xmath76 the coarse - grained space will be labeled according to these cosets .",
    "we can imagine the process of coarse graining as partitioning the grid @xmath77 in such a way that we superimpose a grid of size @xmath78 on top , with each superimposed point indexed by cosets rather than field elements in the original grid .",
    "each point in the coarse grid then contains a sub - grid the same size as @xmath79 . to provide some intuition for this ,",
    "we show a visual example of this process in action in fig .",
    "[ colourfulpanels ] .",
    "our procedure for coarse - graining the grid arises naturally from consideration of the line structure of phase space .",
    "we will use the _ thin _ lines in @xmath70 to create _",
    "thick _ lines in the coarse phase space , by grouping together lines having the same slope , and with intercepts in the same coset .",
    "we write thin lines in the big field @xmath70 as @xmath80 , where @xmath61 is the slope , and @xmath81 is the intercept . a large , coarse - grained line is denoted as @xmath82 , where now the intercept is a whole coset .    to each line in the fine - grained phase space we can assign a projector @xmath83 , constructed as a linear combination of the displacement operators .",
    "we choose as our convention for the rays @xmath84 the all - positive sum @xmath85 these lines are eigenstates with eigenvalue @xmath86 for all displacement operators in the sum .",
    "projectors with nonzero intercepts are obtained by conjugating that of the ray with an appropriate displacement operator .",
    "the coarse lines are produced by grouping together lines with intercepts in the same coset : @xmath87 the possible choices of slope for these lines will be limited to elements of the subfield @xmath74 , as these have natural analogues between the two fields .    as discussed in more detail in appendix  [ sec : lineop ] , the coarse rays of eq .",
    "( [ coarse_untransformed ] ) can be simplified and rewritten as the sum of displacement operators @xmath88 d(\\alpha , \\lambda \\alpha )   \\ , .",
    "\\label{master_eq}\\ ] ]    one can check here that the inner sum over the elements of @xmath75 will cause some of the displacement operators to vanish .",
    "the sum in brackets in eq .",
    "is either zero or a positive constant .",
    "hence , the projection associated to the thick lines are a sum over a subset of the displacement operators associated with the thin lines .",
    "this leads us to the key idea of our work : rather than measuring all the displacement operators , we measure only those which are present in the rays of the coarse - grained space .",
    "we note here that the choice of @xmath75 is not unique , and will ultimately determine the resultant set of displacement operators .",
    "for example , a special case occurs when the dimension of the system is square . in this case",
    ", we can consider the relationship between the fields as a quadratic field extension , i.e. when @xmath89 . in this case",
    "we can partition @xmath90 into @xmath91 .",
    "we can then choose the initial coset as the copy of the subfield @xmath92 : @xmath93 where @xmath14 is a primitive element of @xmath70 and we use the notation @xmath94 for 0 .",
    "the subsequent cosets are obtained additively from this subfield using the representatives @xmath95 .",
    "finally , the coarse - grained phase space inherits a coarse - grained wigner function .",
    "a coarse kernel can be constructed by grouping together kernel operators from the same coset , i.e. @xmath96 desired properties of a wigner function all follow from the original kernel .",
    "as was the case with the displacement operators , differing choices of the subset @xmath75 will lead to differing wigner functions .",
    "colours are indicative of particular coarse rays . the left image coarse grains by taking @xmath97 , whereas the lower image uses the subfield @xmath98 . ]",
    "we illustrate the previous ideas with some relevant examples .",
    "we have written a python software package capable of generating all the following results , which we make available online  @xcite    the first nontrivial instance we can have is the case of two qubits , so dimension @xmath99 . using the irreducible primitive polynomial @xmath100",

    "the resulting set @xmath108 constitutes the appropriate measurements to be performed to determine which coarse - grained line they are in .",
    "they are essentially pauli measurements on one of the two qubits in the system .",

    "hence , the probabilities in these wigner functions become distributed over the cosets which contain the constituent basis states of our target state . as a result ,",
    "the coarse wigner functions resemble ` smoother ' versions of the original one to varying degrees .",
    "compared to the continuous wigner function , the discrete wigner function is an adolescent formulation , slowly developing into adult maturity .",
    "discrete phase space imposes several new challenges , which leads to an intricate mapping of the wigner function .",
    "our coarse graining procedure shows a way to facilitate our understanding when the number of qubits is high .",
    "while it is always possible to ignore part of the system and to determine the full wigner function of the resulting reduced density matrix , our approach allows more choices regarding which information of the whole system is measured . in another extremal case , the coarse - grained wigner function is completely determined by a set of commuting operators that can be measured simultaneously",
    ".    however , several open questions remain",
    ". an obvious next step would be to extend the coarse graining procedure to multi - qudit systems .",
    "furthermore , knowing the coarse - grained function , does there exist another subset of measurements which will allow us to zoom in on specific areas of it and gain more information ?",
    "a logical first choice would be to extend the set of measurements such that they include all operators that correspond to slopes in the subfield .",
    "for example , in the dimension @xmath134 case , we would measure all operators for the rays @xmath158 and @xmath159 , rather than just three from each .",
