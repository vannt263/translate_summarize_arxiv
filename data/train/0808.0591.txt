    "the existence of a large sample of bursts at @xmath45 in the _ swift _ 3-year data imply that grbs have experienced some kind of evolution , being more luminous or more common in the past ( salvaterra & chincarini 2007 ) .    in order to discriminate between luminosity and density evolution models , we compute the number of luminous grbs , i.e. bursts with isotropic peak luminosity @xmath46 erg s@xmath47 in the 1 - 10000 kev band ( salvaterra et al .",
    "we compare model predictions with the number of bright bursts detected by _",
    "swift_. conservatively , our data sample contains only bursts with a good redshift measurement and whose peak energy was well constrained by _ swift _ itself or other satellites ( such as hete-2 or konus - wind ) .",
    "we stress here that this number represents a lower limit on the real number of bright grbs detected , since some luminous bursts without @xmath4 and/or @xmath13 can be present in the _ swift _ catalog .",
    "results for the pure luminosity ( density ) evolution models are plotted in the panel c ( d ) of fig .",
    "1 . data are shown with the histogram where the shaded area takes into account errors on the determination of @xmath15 .",
    "we find that models involving pure luminosity evolution requires @xmath48 to reproduce the number of known bright grbs . on the other hand , models in which grb formation is confined in low ",
    "metallicity environments fall short to account for the observed bright grbs for @xmath49 . assuming @xmath34 , the model reproduces the observed number of bright grbs , taking also into account the errors in the determination of @xmath15 .",
    "this means that essentially all bright bursts present in the 3-year _ swift _ catalog have a measured redshift and well constrained peak energy .",
    "so , although this model can not be discarded with high confidence , the available data indicate the need of some evolution in the grb lf even for such a low value of @xmath30 . for @xmath39 , as required by collapsar models ( macfadyen & woosley 1999 ) , only @xmath50 bursts with @xmath46 erg s@xmath47 should have been detected in three year , largely underpredicting the number of _ swift _ sure identifications .",
    "thus , pure density evolution models , where the grb lf is constant with redshift , are ruled out by the number of bright grbs . in conclusion",

    "these numbers double by lowering the _ swift _ trigger threshold by a factor of two ( salvaterra et al .",

    "grbs are a useful and unique tool to study the universe near and beyond the reionization epoch .",
    "gallerani et al .",
    "( 2008 ) have studied the possibility to constrain the reionization history using the statistics of the dark portions ( gaps ) produced by intervening neutral hydrogen along the line of sight ( los ) in the afterglow spectra of grb at @xmath0 .",
    "two reionization models , both consistent with available observations of the high-@xmath4 universe , are considered : _ ( i ) early reionization model _ ( erm ) where @xmath59 and _ ( ii ) late reionization model _ ( lrm )",
    "where @xmath60 .",
    "suppose now that a grb at redshift @xmath51 is observed at a given flux level in the j band , @xmath61 .",
    "we can then ask what is the probability that the largest of the dark gaps in its afterglow spectrum is found within a given width range .",
    "the results are shown in fig .  2 for two different width ranges ; the left ( right ) panels refer to the erm ( lrm ) case .",
    "the isocontours correspond to a probability of 15% , 30% , 45% , and 60% .",
    "we find that the two models populate the @xmath52 plane in a very different way .",
    "in particular , for largest gaps in the 4080   range , the highest probability is obtained for fainter afterglows in the erm than for the lrm .",
    "for largest gaps in the range 80120  , the probability is in general higher in the lrm with respect to the erm .",
    "note that , in the erm , only a few spectra should contain the largest gap in this range for @xmath62 @xmath63jy .",
    "2 allows a straightforward comparison between data and model results .",
    "it is then natural to apply this procedure to grb  050904 ( black filled circle in fig .  2 ) .",
    "the probability to find the largest gap of 65    is @xmath64% in the erm , i.e. almost half of the los contains the largest gap in the range 4080   for a burst with the redshift and flux of grb  050904 .",
    "such probability drops for the lrm to @xmath65% clearly indicating that in this case the grb  050904 observation represents a much rarer event .",
    "although a large sample of high-@xmath4 grbs is required before we conclude that a model in which reionization was complete at @xmath66 is favored by the data , the discriminating power of the proposed method is already apparent .",
    "this kind of analysis requires high signal - to - noise , high resolution spectra of grb afterglow spectra at @xmath0 obtained with the largest ground telescopes soon after the burst detection . to avoid wasting observing time",

    "the selection criteria adopted are : long burst observed durations ( @xmath67 s ) , faint @xmath68-ray photon fluxes ( @xmath69 ph s@xmath47 @xmath54 ) , and no optical counterpart in the @xmath70 and bluer filters of uvot ( @xmath71 ) .",
    "we tested our selection procedure against the last @xmath72 years of _ swift _ data showing that our method is very efficient and clean ( i.e. no low-@xmath4 interloper is present in the sample ) .",
