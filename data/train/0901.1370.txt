    "the bond - percolation model can be described by means of the partition sum @xmath1=1 \\label{zb}\\ ] ] where the bond variables @xmath2 are located on the edges of a lattice , and labeled with the site numbers at both ends .",
    "the ` bonds ' , i.e. , the nonzero bond variables , form a network of which one may study the percolation properties .",
    "similarly , the site percolation problem is described by @xmath3=1 \\label{zs}\\ ] ] in this case , the percolation problem is formed by adding ` bonds ' between all pairs @xmath4 of neighboring sites that are both occupied ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "( [ zb ] ) and ( [ zs ] ) specify that the bonds or sites are occupied with independent probabilities @xmath6 .",
    "the values of these partition sums are trivial , but the percolation properties contained in these models are not .",
    "these properties , in particular for two - dimensional models , have been investigated by a considerable number of different approaches , see @xcite and references therein . according to the universality hypothesis ,",
    "some of these properties , such as the critical exponents , are the same for different two - dimensional lattices .",
    "other properties , such as the percolation threshold , are naturally dependent on the type of the lattice , as well as on the number of neighbors to which a given site can form a bond .",
    "if not mentioned explicitly , we consider models with bonds between nearest - neighbor sites only",
    ".    the present work reports some new findings , obtained by means of monte carlo simulation and transfer - matrix methods .",
    "monte carlo simulation was used in the cases of site percolation on the diced lattice , and of bond percolation on the square lattice with nearest- and next - nearest - neighbor bonds .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "[ secnum ] we sketch our transfer - matrix and monte carlo methods .",
    "section [ secres ] describes the analyses and lists our results .",
    "the conclusions are summarized and discussed in sec .",
    "[ seccon ] .",
    "our numerical analyses employ both transfer - matrix and monte carlo techniques .",
    "both approaches have their advantages .",
    "transfer - matrix calculation yield finite - size results of a high precision , typically with error margins of the order of @xmath7 , which therefore allow the application of sensitive fitting procedures .",
    "however , the transfer - matrix results are restricted to rather small values of the finite - size parameter .",
    "in contrast , the monte carlo results can be applied to much larger finite sizes , but they are also subject to significant statistical errors . which of the two techniques was applied to specific models depended on considerations of effectiveness and complexity .",
    "the site percolation problem on the diced lattice was investigated by the monte carlo method , in view of the expected amount of work involved in writing the various sparse - matrix multiplication subprograms in a transfer - matrix algorithm for the diced lattice , which has inequivalent sites .",
    "while the transfer - matrix method usually yields relatively accurate results , this appeared not to be the case for the bond - percolation problem on the square lattice with crossing bonds .",
    "for this reason we also investigated this problem using the monte carlo method .",
    "the present transfer - matrix calculations apply to models wrapped on an infinitely long cylinder , with a finite circumference @xmath8 . for the bond - percolation model , which can be considered as the special case @xmath9 of the random - cluster representation of the @xmath10-state potts model @xcite",
    ", we may conveniently use the numerical methods developed earlier for the random - cluster model .",
    "our basic approach @xcite is close in spirit to that of derrida and vannimenus @xcite for the percolation model .",
    "describes in detail how the state of connectivity of the sites on the end row of the cylinder can be coded by means of an integer ( 1 , 2 , 3 , @xmath11 ) that serves as a transfer - matrix index . that work also describes the sparse - matrix decomposition of the transfer matrix",
    "however , the various lattice structures investigated here require modifications of the sparse - matrix methods described there .",
    "in addition , the model with nearest- and next - nearest - neighbor bonds violates the condition of ` well - nestedness ' described in ref .",
    ", so that new coding and decoding algorithms had to be devised .",
    "the transfer matrices for the site - percolation models require different modifications that , again , depend on the lattice structure .",
    "it is , in general , necessary to store the occupation number ( 0 or 1 ) of the sites on the end - most row of the lattice , as well as the state of connectivity of the occupied sites .",
    "this combined information can also be coded as an integer that plays the role of a transfer - matrix index , using the methods described in ref .  .",
    "however , the state of connectedness of the occupied sites on the last row may , depending on the lattice geometry , be subject to an additional condition .",
    "if the sites on this row are nearest neighbors , such as for the square lattice with the transfer direction along one set of lattice edges , then two adjacent , occupied sites must belong to the same cluster .",
    "this reduces the number of possible connectivities . to take advantage of this reduction ,",
    "the coding - decoding algorithms for the square - lattice model were modified . for the square - lattice site - percolation model with transfer in the diagonal direction ,",
    "the situation is different , and the algorithms of ref .",
    "had to be used . to save memory and computer time ,",
    "sparse matrix decompositions were applied in all cases .",
    "a full description of all these algorithms is beyond the scope of this paper ; we trust that it is sufficient to mention that all further relevant details are contained in or follow from the explanations given here and in refs .  .",
    "the connectivities used here include those of the ` magnetic ' type , i.e. , they carry the information which of the sites of the end row are connected by a percolating path to a far - away site , say on the first row of the lattice .    using a computer with 8 gigabyte of fast memory",
    ", our algorithms can perform transfer matrix calculations in connectivity spaces of linear dimensions up to the order @xmath12 . some details concerning the largest system sizes that could thus be handled , and the corresponding transfer - matrix sizes , appear in tab .",
    "[ tab : tmdat ] .",
    ".some details about the transfer - matrix calculations on the various models .",
    "transfer directions are given with respect to a set of lattice edges .",
    "included are the largest system sizes and the linear size of the transfer matrix for that system , as well as the corresponding size of the largest sparse matrix .",
    "the entry ` 8-nb square ' refers to the square lattice with nearest- and next - nearest - neighbor bonds . [",
    "cols=\"<,^,<,^,>,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     the difference between the two entries for the amplitude @xmath13 for the square lattice is , at least approximately , equal to 2 .",
    "this factor may be attributed to the difference of a factor @xmath14 in the length units of the finite size @xmath8 for the two cases ( an edge or a diagonal of the square lattice ) .",
    "this would suggest that the amplitude @xmath13 of the logarithmic term is , unlike the amplitude @xmath15 , independent on the orientation of the finite direction of the square lattice in the cylindrical geometry .",
    "we obtained new results for the percolation thresholds of several two - dimensional models .",
    "the results are , as far as they overlap with the literature , generally consistent with existing results , and the error margins are somewhat reduced .",
    "although our result for the bond - percolation threshold of the kagome lattice model lies remarkably close to an approximate result given by scullard and ziff @xcite , the difference is quite significant , in agreement with the conclusions of these authors @xcite .    in our numerical analysis of the transfer - matrix data",
    ", we made use of the universality hypothesis , i.e. , in all cases we assumed the validity of the exact results for the scaling dimensions of the percolation models in two dimensions @xcite .",
    "however , we are able to support this assumption considerably .",
    "in addition to eq .",
    "( [ xsc ] ) , we may use ` phenomenological renormalization ' @xcite to determine the critical points , so that we no longer make use of prior knowledge @xmath16 .",
    "this approach yields the same critical points , within error margins that are a few times larger than those listed in tab .",
    "[ tab : tmres ] .",
    "the estimates of the scaled gaps produced by the phenomenological renormalization approach match the value 5/48 up to several decimal places , and give no sign of deviations from universality .",
    "the analysis of the corrections to scaling is in agreement with the irrelevant scaling dimension @xmath0 , but showed the existence of a contribution with a logarithmic factor in the transfer - matrix data for the scaled magnetic gap .",
    "the amplitude of this contribution is strongly model - dependent , and possibly vanishes for the triangular site - percolation model .",
    "this raises the question in what sense the latter model could be special .",
    "it may be argued that it is the model with the highest symmetry investigated here ; it has a @xmath17 rotational symmetry as well as a form of self - dual symmetry because of the matching - lattice argument @xcite .",
    "a corresponding logarithmic term could possibly also be present in the quantity @xmath18 , but we were unable to confirm its existence from our monte carlo data .",
    "furthermore , we recall that the bond - percolation model with crossing bonds ( 8 neighbors ) lives in an extended space of connectivities because the condition of well - nestedness @xcite no longer applies .",
    "accordingly one may postulate that these non - well - nested connectivities introduce another irrelevant field , and that additional corrections described by a new scaling dimension would appear .",
    "however , we did not find any clear sign of such new corrections .",
    "finally we remark that the present logarithmic terms are unrelated to those reported by adler and privman @xcite , which apply to some leading singularities .",
    "logarithmic factors naturally appear in quantities involving the mean cluster size .",
    "the free energy of the random cluster model also serves as the generating function of percolation properties .",
    "the mean cluster size can be obtained by differentiation of the random - cluster partition sum or the free energy to the number of potts states @xmath10 .",
    "the @xmath10-dependence of the critical exponents then provides a mechanism that introduces such logarithmic factors in some critical singularities .",
