    "the majority of the @xmath2 collisions are due to interactions of the proton with the hadronic structure of the photon , a process that has been successfully described by the vector meson dominance model ( vdm)@xcite . here , the photon is pictured to fluctuate into a virtual vector meson that subsequently collides with the proton .",
    "such collisions exhibit the phenomenological characteristics of hadron  hadron interactions .",
    "in particular they can proceed via diffractive or non  diffractive channels .",
    "the diffractive interactions are characterized by very small four momentum transfers and no colour exchange between the colliding particles leading to final states where the colliding particles appear either intact or as more massive dissociated states .",
    "however , it has been previously demonstrated that photoproduction collisions at high transverse momentum can not be described solely in terms of the fluctuation of the photon into a hadron  like state @xcite .",
    "the deviations come from contributions of two additional processes called direct and anomalous . in the former process the photon couples directly to the charged partons inside the proton .",
    "the anomalous component corresponds to the process where the photon couples to a _",
    "pair without forming a bound state . the interactions of the photon via the hadron  like state and the anomalous component are referred to as resolved photoproduction , since both of them can be described in terms of the partonic structure of the photon @xcite .",

    "the hadronization of diffractively dissociated photons has not yet been systematically studied . in this analysis we present the measurement of inclusive @xmath4 spectra in two intervals of the dissociated photon mass with mean values of @xmath76 and @xmath77 .",

    "the events used in the following analysis were collected using a trigger requiring a coincidence of the signals in the lumi electron calorimeter and in the central calorimeter .",
    "the small angular acceptance of the lumi electron calorimeter implied that in all the triggered events the virtuality of the exchanged photon was between @xmath102 .",

    ", we estimated that the efficiency of the charged track reconstruction convoluted with the acceptance of the selection cuts is about @xmath140 and is uniform in @xmath4 . the contamination of the final sample from secondary interaction tracks , products of decays of short lived particles , and from spurious tracks ( artifacts of the reconstruction algorithm ) ranges from @xmath141 at @xmath142 to @xmath143 for @xmath144 .",

    ", the qed radiation effects result in @xmath155 change in the number of measured events so that the effect on the results of this analysis are negligible .",
    "the generated events were processed through the detector and trigger simulation programs and run through the standard zeus reconstruction chain .",
    "the acceptance corrected transverse momentum spectrum was derived from the reconstructed spectrum of charged tracks , by means of a multiplicative correction factor , calculated using monte carlo techniques : @xmath156 @xmath157 denotes the number of primary charged particles generated with a transverse momentum @xmath158 in the considered pseudorapidity interval and @xmath159 is the number of generated events . only the events corresponding to the appropriate type of interaction were included , e.g. for the lower invariant mass interval of the diffractive sample only the monte carlo events corresponding to diffractive photon dissociation with the generated invariant mass @xmath160 were used .",
    "@xmath161 is the number of reconstructed tracks passing the experimental cuts with a reconstructed transverse momentum of @xmath162 , while @xmath163 denotes the number of events used .",
    "only the events passing the trigger simulation and the experimental event selection criteria were included in the calculation . to account for the contribution of all the subprocesses , the combination of the mc samples described in section  [ s : mc ] was used .",
    "this method corrects for the following effects in the data :    * the limited trigger acceptance ; * the inefficiencies of the event selection cuts , in particular the contamination of the diffractive spectra from non  diffractive processes and the events with a dissociated mass that was incorrectly reconstructed .",
    "also the non - diffractive sample is corrected for the contamination from diffractive events with high dissociated mass ; * limited track finding efficiency and acceptance of the track selection cuts , as well as the limited resolution in momentum and angle ; * loss of tracks due to secondary interactions and contamination from secondary tracks ; * decays of charged pions and kaons , photon conversions and decays of lambdas and neutral kaons .",
    "thus , in the final spectra the charged kaons appear , while the decay products of neutral kaons and lambdas do not .",
    "for all the other strange and charmed states , the decay products were included .",
    "the validity of our acceptance correction method relies on the correct simulation of the described effects in the monte carlo program .",
    "the possible discrepancies between reality and monte carlo simulation were analyzed and the estimation of the effect on the final distributions was included in the systematic uncertainty , as described in the following section .",
    "one of the potential sources of systematic inaccuracy is the tracking system and its simulation in the monte carlo events used for the acceptance correction . using an alternative simulation code with artificially degraded tracking performance we verified that the efficiency to find a track which fulfills all the selection cuts is known with an accuracy of about @xmath164 .",
    "the error due to an imprecise description of the momentum resolution at high @xmath4 is negligible compared to the statistical precision of the data .",
    "we also verified that the final spectra would not change significantly if the tracking resolution at high @xmath4 had non ",
    "gaussian tails at the level of @xmath164 or if the measured momentum was systematically shifted from the true value by the momentum resolution .",
    "another source of systematic uncertainty is the monte carlo simulation of the trigger response .",
    "we verified that even a very large ( @xmath165 ) inaccuracy of the bcal energy threshold would not produce a statistically significant effect .",
    "an incorrect rcal trigger simulation would change the number of events observed , but would not affect the final @xmath4 spectra since it is normalized to the number of events .",
    "the correlation between the rcal energy and the @xmath4 of tracks is very small .    to evaluate the model dependence we repeated the calculation of the correction factors using an alternative set of monte carlo programs ( see section [ s : mc ] ) and compared the results with the original ones .",
    "the differences between the obtained factors varied between @xmath141 for the high mass diffractive sample and @xmath151 for the non  diffractive one .",
    "the sensitivity of the result to the assumed relative cross sections of the physics processes was checked by varying the subprocess ratios within the error limits given in @xcite .",
    "the effect was at most @xmath143 .",
