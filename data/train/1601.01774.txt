    "as a quantum analog of the well - known classical random walk , quantum random walk serves as a fascinating framework for various quantum information processes , such as basic search @xcite , universal quantum computation @xcite , quantum measurement @xcite etc .",
    "apart from its numerous applications , quantum random walk itself also displays new traits different from its classical counterpart , such as the fast spreading of the wave function compared to a classical random walk @xcite , which was used for explaining the high efficiency photosynthetic energy transfer assisted by environment @xcite .",
    "@xcite considered an one - dimensional ( 1d ) quantum random walk on a bipartite lattice , where a topological transition was found and experimental implementation in quantum dots or cavity qed ( cqed ) was briefly discussed . in it , the environment effect was included by using a non - hermitian hamiltonian , as done in @xcite .",
    "later , the same model was extended to multi - dimensional systems @xcite .     or @xmath0 depending on whether that hop crosses unit boundaries .",
    "when the particle is on the blue sites , it would decay with rate @xmath1.,scaledwidth=40.0% ]    as in fig .",
    "[ figtheory ] , the quantum walk could be realized on an 1d bipartite indexed lattice where decay sites ( blue ) and non - decay sites ( white ) appear in turn .",
    "the strengths of hopping between sites are characterized by @xmath2 ( within the same unit ) and @xmath0 ( between neighboring units ) , and due to that , a random walker  starting from a non - decay site of unit @xmath3 may end up decaying from the system from another unit @xmath4 with probability @xmath5 . given the relative strengths of @xmath2 and @xmath0 , the average displacement of a walker  @xmath6 before it decays is quantized as an integer ( @xmath7 for @xmath8 and @xmath9 for @xmath10 ) no matter what the decay co - efficient @xmath11 is . as shown in ref . @xcite",
    ", such system displayed parity - time symmetry @xcite .",
    "these different displacements correspond to unbroken and broken parity - time symmetry regimes and consist of a topological transition . in this work",
    "we will show that such transition is robust even in the presence of qubit dephase .",
    "note that this idea can be experimentally realized in a cqed setting , where a qubit is coupled to one resonator mode @xcite .",
    "specifically , the two states of the qubit ( @xmath12 ) represent two sites of the same unit , where the higher - energy qubit state ( @xmath13 ) has decay rate @xmath14 .",
    "the cavity photon number state @xmath15 represents the @xmath16-th unit .",
    "here we suppose that the cavity decay @xmath17 is much less than qubit decay @xmath18 and is thus negligible .",
    "such a system could be an atom in a cavity coupled to one cavity mode or similarly , as cqed systems where a superconducting josephson junction which acts as a qubit , is coupled to a lumped lc oscillator in an superconducting electric circuit .",
    "recently , circuit qed system attracts a lot of attention , as it could be easily scaled up and controlled @xcite .",
    "we will stick to the circuit qed system setup from now on .",
    "on the other hand , there were experiments realizing bipartite non - hermitian quantum random walk in optical waveguide @xcite with satisfying results , which in essence is a classical simulation of a quantum effect .",
    "however , the non - hermitian quantum walk in circuit qed is a fully quantum experiment .",
    "another merit of circuit qed system is that extension to higher dimension quantum walk is relatively easy , as a high - dimensional quantum walk can be implemented by coupling the qubit to more than one resonator mode .",
    "we will show that novel features of a quantum walk emerges with the growth of dimensionality .    in this paper",
    ", we first extend the analytical theory in @xcite to accommodate the existence of dephase , and show that the qubit dephase , one major source of decoherence in normal circuit qed systems , wo nt affect the topological structure experimentally observed .",
    "numerical calculations are carried out for different parameters of the system , and different factors affecting the results are considered and discussed , including the preparation of the system , the decay rate of the qubit , the detuning of the system and the effect of dephasing .",
    "we will show that such quantum walk realization is feasible in circuit qed setting , and good topological transition can be observed with modest requirement on the system parameters afore - mentioned .",
    "we consider a system where a two - level qubit is coupled to a resonator field , with external microwave driving . such a system can be expressed in standard circuit qed hamiltonian @xmath19 where @xmath20 are pauli operators for the qubit",
    ", @xmath21 characterizes the coupling strength , and @xmath22 are lowering ( rising ) operators on the resonator mode in a rotating frame , @xmath23 is ( real ) detuning of the system , consists of the energy differences between the two states of the qubit minus the minimum energy gap for the resonator , @xmath24 is the strength of external drive on the atom .",
    "furthermore , we consider decay of the excited state of the qubit , together with qubit dephase .",
    "we use @xmath18 to characterize qubit decay strength , and @xmath25 as the dephase factor of the qubit .",
    "the effects of such two terms on the system can be added as lindblad operators as @xmath26 + d \\left[\\sigma^z \\rho(t ) \\sigma^z - \\rho(t)\\right ] \\\\ & + \\gamma\\left[\\sigma^- \\rho(t ) \\sigma^+   + \\sigma^+ \\sigma^-",
    "\\rho(t ) + \\sigma^- \\sigma^+ \\rho(t)\\right ] , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    in usual experimental setup @xcite , the strength of cavity decay is at the magnitude of @xmath27 khz or less , which is significantly smaller than other parameters in the system , such as the coupling strength @xmath21 which could reach @xmath28hz and qubit decay @xmath18 is in the order of mhz .",
    "therefore , we ignore the cavity decay effects . besides , the external drive @xmath24 is easily tunable to fulfill the topological transition conditions .    since we are only interested in the state of the system when the qubit first decays , we followed the quantum jump approach in @xcite and put the qubit decay term into the hamiltonian , which yields an effective non - hermitian hamiltonian @xmath29 we put subscript `` org '' to distinguish the original hamiltonian @xmath30 from this hamiltonian that we will work with from now on .",
    "ideally , if the system is initialized at photon number state @xmath31 ( which means the `` walker '' starts at exact site @xmath32 ) , and stays close to @xmath32 during the whole evolution process , then we can use the approximation @xmath33 to simplify the operators .",
    "the conditions on which this approximation holds will be discussed later .",
    "then , assuming @xmath34 , we have @xmath35 thus , when @xmath36 ( @xmath37 ) the average photon number upon measurement should be @xmath32 ( no change ) , and when @xmath38 ( @xmath39 ) the average photon number upon measurement should be @xmath40 ( change of @xmath9 ) .    due to the existence of decay term @xmath41",
    "the hamiltonian is not hermitian .",
    "however , it satisfies the condition of parity - time symmetry , that is , after undergoing parity ( @xmath42 ) and time reversal ( @xmath43 ) transformation , the new hamiltonian @xmath44 is only a constant away from the old hamiltonian ( @xmath45 ) . and",
    "recent work @xcite has proven that when we have @xmath37 the eigenvalues of the hamiltonian are totally real , while @xmath39 there s a pair of complex energy eigenvalues , which correspond to unbroken and broken pt symmetries respectively .",
    "the analytical theory for this topological transition has been explained in detail before @xcite . here , we will improve their analytical theory to include the qubit dephase .",
    "the lindblad master equation of the system is @xcite @xmath46 + d \\left[\\sigma^z \\rho(t ) \\sigma^z - \\rho(t)\\right ] , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath25 characterizes dephase rate for qubit .",
    "if the system is pure , one could use @xmath47 to denote the amplitude at @xmath48 and @xmath49 at @xmath50 . in the presence of dephase",
    "the density matrix of the system is mixed .",
    "we can similarly use density matrix as @xmath51 , @xmath52 , where @xmath53 is the matrix entry corresponding to @xmath54 and so can be interpreted for @xmath55 , @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "we have @xmath58    then we translate this to momentum space by having @xmath59 where @xmath60 , the hamiltonian becomes separable as for a @xmath61 subspace of @xmath62 we have @xmath63 with @xmath64 and @xmath65 .",
    "using integration by part , we have that @xmath66 summing over @xmath16 and integrate over time , we have @xmath67 where we use @xmath68 as a shorthand of @xmath69 .",
    "now , one can define @xmath70 as the probability that the subsystem of momentum @xmath71 hasnt decay till time @xmath72 , with @xmath73 .",
    "also , one can use polar decomposition as @xmath74 . with that , one can write @xmath75 considering the fact that @xmath76 as the diagonal terms of a density matrix are real , and @xmath77 , one can find that the first term @xmath78 induces an integration of a closed contour , and is thus zero . we can reach @xmath79    defining @xmath80 we have through integration by part @xmath81 given the way we conduct fourier transfer , we have @xmath82 , which means @xmath83 .",
    "thus we have @xmath84 here we also use the fact that @xmath85 is even function in @xmath71 .",
    "given the fact that @xmath86 , that integration yields zero , and we have @xmath87 .",
    "given that the system eventually decays completely , @xmath88 , we have @xmath89    since @xmath90 is pure and diagonal in the basis of @xmath91 , for @xmath92 consider up to the first order of @xmath93 , one could find that the dephase term @xmath94 does nt affect @xmath92 to the first order .",
    "thus , by treating @xmath92 as a pure state ( which is similar to the case in ref .",
    "@xcite ) , we have @xmath95 the topological structure is that , if @xmath96 , then the integration of @xmath97 does nt contain the axis origin and @xmath98 ; if @xmath99 , then the integration of @xmath97 is an anti - clockwise contour of a circle centered at @xmath100 and with radius @xmath101 , which contains the axis origin , thus @xmath102 .",
    "we use a simple numerical integration technique to do the simulation . a @xmath103@xcite ( which is the total dimension of the hilbert space under consideration ) dimensional complex vector @xmath104 ( matrix , if dephase is in consideration )",
    "is used to store the state of the system . in the absence of dephase ,",
    "a matrix @xmath105 is computed and @xmath106 simply yields the new state vector @xmath104 . in the presence of qubit dephase we use lindblad master equation ( [ eq : master ] ) .",
    "integration is carried out along the way until the amplitude of @xmath104 converges @xcite .",
    "the time interval @xmath72 shrinks by half each time and richardson extrapolation is carried out until the final result converges .    a first glimpse of the results are provided in fig . [ fign100 ] with @xmath107 ( which is large , as proposed in @xcite to meet the assumption of ( [ eq : approx ] ) )",
    ".     captures the relative strengths of inter and intra unit hopping in the quantum random walk , and @xmath108 is the average resonator energy upon qubit decay .",
    "the other parameters are @xmath109 ( set as a benchmark ) , @xmath110 while @xmath24 varies.,scaledwidth=40.0% ]    good topological transition is observed if the system is initialized in a fock state ( black ) .",
    "since large number fock states are usually hard to prepare , we considered an alternative : coherent state ( poisson distribution ) , which the authors of @xcite have also chosen by a classical driving .",
    "however , the simulation ( red line in fig . [ fign100 ] ) turns out to be quite similar in the case of non - coherent hopping ( classical walker ) despite large initial @xmath32 .",
    "this shows that , contrary to the ref .",
    "@xcite , the fock states are indeed necessary for testing topological transition .    considering the fact that high energy fock states are hard to come by , we relax the condition of @xmath111 and examine some cases with small fock numbers .",
    "an extreme case of @xmath112 is displayed in fig .",
    "[ fign1 ] which still preserves the basic traits of a topological transition despite the small initial fock number .    further investigation into the problem yields fig .",
    "[ figoverlap ] , which shows that the curve for different @xmath32 s overlap .      in this section",
    "we consider the effect of qubit decay factors @xmath18 and detuning @xmath23 on this experiment . in theory",
    "@xcite , qubit decay factor @xmath18 only affects the ( expected ) evolution time , not the topological transition , so the expected result should be the same for different @xmath18 s .",
    "we run a simulation for different initial @xmath32 s with identical parameters like @xmath21 and @xmath23 for different decay factors @xmath18 s , with result in fig .",
    "[ figgamma ] .",
    "we observe that the qubit decay factor @xmath18 can not be too small ( at least @xmath113 should be satisfied ) , otherwise the photon number upon measurement would be too large .",
    "this is necessary for both small and large @xmath32 s .",
    "we found that @xmath114 ( 4 times the coupling strength ) is roughly where qubit decay factor starts to negatively affect the observed topological transition , we will stick to this value from now on .",
    "the discrepancy between analytical theory and numerical results lies in the assumption of equation ( [ eq : approx ] ) , which is only valid if the system stays close to photon number @xmath32 throughout the whole evolution .",
    "if decay factor @xmath18 is small , the quantum walker can walk far away from the initial site , overturning that assumption . specifically , since we have @xmath115 the strengths of inter - site hoppings grow stronger as the site number ( or energy level in our simulation ) increases , which explains why for small @xmath18 s the curves deviate significantly to higher energy levels .",
    "luckily , big @xmath18 s does not present an experimental difficulty in reality , as big qubit decays are usually easy to generate .",

    "simulation shows that as long as the detuning of the system is kept small ( fig .",
    "[ figenergygap ] shows that@xmath122 suffices ) , it wo nt have a tangible effect on the result of this experiment .",
    "it s worthwhile to notice that in theory , neither @xmath23 nor @xmath18 should affect the experimental results . yet in fig .",
    "[ figenergygap ] , one can observe that for a fixed @xmath123 , increasing qubit decay @xmath18 yields better topological transition .",
    "we believe approximation ( [ eq : approx ] ) plays a major role here , just like in fig .",
    "[ figgamma ] , as small qubit decay @xmath18 yields wilder amplitude span to overturn approximation ( [ eq : approx ] ) .",
    "dephasing characterizes one major effect of noise on circuit qed systems , making a quantum system less `` quantum '' but more `` classical '' . here , we consider dephase of the qubit due to external field fluctuation , which is the major source of dephase in a circuit qed system , and can be written in lindblad master equation ( [ eq : master ] ) , where @xmath25 characterizes the strength of such dephase .",
    "such dephase keeps the diagonal elements of @xmath124 , but in addition to other standard evolution the non - diagonal elements of it shrinks exponentially by @xmath125 .",
    "here , we run a numerical simulation where qubit decay rate @xmath18 and other parameters like @xmath21 , @xmath23 are kept identical for different qubit dephase factor @xmath25 s .",

    "yet even when the dephase of the qubit is very large ( @xmath127 ) compared with the other elements of the system @xmath128 , good topological transition can still be observed , as compared to the classical incoherent hopping .",
    "this numerical results agree with analytical theory we put forward earlier in this paper , that this topological structure is protected from the effect of dephase .",
    "no matter how much dephase we have in the system , as long as such dephase comes from external field fluctuation , and can be treated as markovian in the timescale of other operations in the system , it wo nt affect experimental results .",
    "as an extension to what s previous discussed , we have also investigated 2-dimensional quantum walk . in this case",
    "each unit still consists of a decaying site and a non - decaying site , however , a `` walker '' could make inter - unit hopping in two dimensions , with their strengths characterized by @xmath129 and @xmath130 each .",

    "the dashed lines are used to indicate the boundaries of each site.,scaledwidth=40.0% ]    the benefits of a circuit qed system is that it s relatively easy to accommodate this change by adding a second resonator mode coupled to the qubit .",
    "like before , if one uses @xmath131 to identify the state of the system , then the hamiltonian of the system is @xmath132 where @xmath133 s are still pauli operators on the qubit , and @xmath134 s are lowering / rising operators on the first or second resonator field in a rotating frame , @xmath23 is ( real ) detuning of the system , and @xmath18 characterizes the decay strength of the excited qubit state .      the theory for higher dimensional case without dephase has been explained in @xcite , which is a simple extension of the one - dimensional case , and so is the following section considering dephase .",
    "suppose the dimension is @xmath25 .",
    "as in the one - dimensional case , one can still use @xmath135 to denote the state of the system , where @xmath136 and @xmath137 are @xmath25-dimensional vectors and @xmath138 . the same fourier translation into momentum space yields that for subspace @xmath139 , @xmath140 with @xmath141 .",
    "defining @xmath142 in the same way as @xmath143 and with @xmath144 and integrate by part , one can reach @xmath145 while the shorthand @xmath146 means taking partial derivative only on the @xmath147-th component of @xmath139 , and only on the first @xmath139 in the density matrix .",
    "it s not hard to see that the expression inside the brace is exactly as equation ( [ basice1 ] ) and thus is either @xmath7 or @xmath148 , no matter what dephasing factors we have .",
    "now , if one come back to the definition of @xmath141 , one way to understand equation ( [ basice2 ] ) is to first fix @xmath149 angles @xmath150 , then see whether the integration of @xmath151 from @xmath7 to @xmath152 would case the angle of @xmath153 to also shift @xmath152 , and integration over those @xmath149 angles . during the integration of the other @xmath149 angles",
