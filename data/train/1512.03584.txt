    "rogue ( freak ) waves are the waves with a height more than 2 - 2.2 times the significant wave height in the ocean wave field",
    ". they present a danger to the safety of marine operations and life and their result can be catastrophic and costly ( kharif and pelinovsky , 2003 ; bayindir , 2015 ) .",
    "the understanding of chaotic rogue wave dynamics is a must for the safety of the marine travel and the offshore operations in stormy conditions .",
    "there are few known mechanisms in ocean which cause rogue waves formation .",
    "these are focusing of the nonlinear wave interactions such as collusion of breathers , frequency modulated wave groups due to geometrical and dispersion effects , atmospheric forcing and wave - current interactions in strong currents .",
    "in this paper we consider the generation of the rogue waves in the strong wave - current interactions regions such as the agulhas current of the southwest indian ocean or the gulf stream current in the atlantic ocean ( kharif and pelinovsky , 2003 ) .",
    "with this motivation , we use a simple governing equation first proposed by smith ( 1976 ) which is a nonlinear schrdinger equation ( nlse ) .",
    "the extended nlse of smith accounts for the effects of current gradient on the dynamics of the ocean surface . implementing a split - step numerical scheme",
    "we show that the extended nlse of smith is unstable against random chaotic perturbation in the current profile .",
    "therefore the initial monochromatic wave field turns into a chaotic sea state with many apparent peaks at later times .",
    "we show that those rogue waves can be described by the rational rogue wave solutions of the nlse .",
    "additionally we discuss the effects of magnitude of the chaotic current profile perturbations on the statistics of the rogue wave generation .",
    "we show that extension term in smith s extended nlse introduces phase shifts to the solutions and it does not alter the total energy of the wave field . using the methodology discussed in this paper ,",
    "the dynamics of rogue wave on the ocean surface due to blocking effect of currents can be analyzed which can be used for enhancing the safety of the maritime operations and ocean travel .",
    "nlse is widely used in many branches of the applied sciences and engineering .",
    "it describes various phenomena including but not limited to pulse propagation in optical fibers , bose - einstein condensation , quantum state of a physical system and quantum control just to name a few .",
    "it is also possible to model the dynamics of weakly nonlinear deep water ocean waves by the nlse ( zakharov , 1968 ) . in order to study various dispersion , focusing , nonlinearity and other effects , many modified and extended versions of the nlse",
    "are proposed . in order to examine the effects of the ocean current gradient on the nonlinear wave field dynamics in the vicinity of the blocking point , smith derived the extended nlse equation ( smith , 1976 ; kharif and pelinovsky , 2003 ) in the form @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the spatial and temporal variables",

    "a chaotic sea state involves a full range of the wave spectrum with many spectral components .",
    "therefore for the practical purposes it is important to investigate how the chaotic wave - current field dynamics can be modeled by the extended nlse of smith . in order to investigate this behavior we generate a chaotic wave - current field using a similar but different technique to the ones discussed by akhmediev et.al .",

    "the time integration is performed by time stepping of the exponential function for the governing equation with a first order time derivative ( bayindir , 2015 ) .",
    "for the extended nlse of smith we implement a split - step fourier scheme .",
    "we take first part of the extended nlse of smith for @xmath23 as @xmath24 which can be solved as @xmath25 where @xmath26 denoted the time step .",

    "this form of the ssfm requires two fast fourier transform operations per time step .",
    "the number of spectral components are taken as @xmath32 for using the fast fourier transforms efficiently .",
    "the time step is selected as @xmath33 which does not cause any stability problems .",
    "initialization of the chaotic wave field *    we start simulations using a wave with constant amplitude of 1 and using a chaotic perturbation in the ocean current profile .",
    "such a sea state becomes unstable and it evolves into a full - scale chaotic wave field . for this purpose",
    "we introduce the initial conditions @xmath34 and @xmath35 \\label{eq19}\\ ] ] where @xmath2 is the imaginary number , @xmath36 and @xmath37 are some constants which determine the magnitude of chaotic perturbations and @xmath38 and @xmath39 are uniformly distributed random number vectors with values in the interval of [ -1,1 ] .",
    "it is known that chaotic perturbations in the current profile imposes chaotic perturbations in the ocean surface wave field and vice versa .",
    "therefore we use the expression in ( [ eq19 ] ) not only as an initial condition but also impose it in time to model this phenomena .",
    "the chaotic wave field with these initial conditions evolves into a wave field which exhibits many amplitude peaks , with some of them becoming rogue waves , similar to the results presented by akhmediev et.al .",
    "( 2009a , 2011 ) and bayindir ( 2015 ) .",
    "it is possible to add perturbations to the current profile with a characteristic current length scale @xmath40 , by multiplying the second term in the ( [ eq19 ] ) by a factor of @xmath41 . or one can add perturbations with different current length scale using fourier analysis .",

    "the actual spatial domain of the numerical simulations is as long as @xmath48 $ ] .",
    "the peak amplitude for the appearing rogue wave in this simulation is 4.54 hence it can not be described by the first order rational soliton solution ( akhmediev et.al . , 2009a ) .",
    "therefore we compare it with the second order rational soliton solution of nlse .        in order to analyze the shape of the rogue wave , in the fig.[fig2 ] we present a comparison of the rogue wave obtained in numerical simulations with the second order rational soliton solution defined by eq.([eq05 ] ) . in this plot , the continuous blue line represents the numerical simulations .",
    "the exact second order rational soliton solution is shown by the dashed red line .",
    "the peak value for the analytical second order rational rogue wave is 5.00 .",
    "therefore we use a scaling factor of @xmath49 in the scaling law defined by eq.([eq09 ] ) and perform comparisons accordingly .",
    "the central part of the rogue wave accurately follows the exact profile .",
    "the discrepancy in the tails of the peak are due to random smaller amplitude waves of the chaotic field that are in the vicinity of the peak .",
    "it is possible to conclude that the profile around the peak closely follows the second - order rational solution .",
    "the rogue waves in the form the second order rational soliton can also be described by the collision of akhmediev breathers ( akhmediev et.al .",
    ", 2009a ) .",
    "thus the rogue wave solutions of the extended nlse of smith can be described by collusions of such breathers as well .        in order to quantify the probabilities of occurrence for different values of the maxima ,",
    "two different initial conditions are considered . in the first case",
    "we take @xmath50 and @xmath51 or @xmath52 . in the second case",
    "we take @xmath53 and @xmath50 or @xmath54 .",
    "the histograms for this first case are depicted in fig.[fig3 ] and the histograms for the second case are depicted in fig.[fig4 ] .",
    "for these two cases , we plotted the number of maxima appearing in each simulation within small fixed intervals of amplitude .",
    "this intervals are selected as @xmath55 .",
    "we only count maxima above a lower limit of 0.5 .",
    "the total number of maxima in each case is equal to 6.4 million .",
    "this massive runs are performed in wide temporal intervals as well as with long propagation distance @xmath12 to ensure statistical convergence .",
    "each simulation was repeated 50 times with new initial conditions with same values of @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "these massive simulations allowed us to obtain several thousands of maxima within each small amplitude segment .",
    "we observe only a few maxima bigger than 4.5 .    ,",

    "this was expected because the last term in the extended nlse of smith given in eq.([eq01 ] ) accounts for the phase shifts due to wave - current interaction . it does not amplify the chaotic wave field of the cubic nlse .",
    "the average energy for both of the cases are @xmath56=1.25 $ ] , to the second digit accuracy in decimal points .",
    "this result , together with the histograms confirm that the last term in the extended nlse of smith does not change the total energy of the chaotic wave field .",
    "it rather behaves like a phase lag term , altering the location of occurrence of rogue waves .",
    "this can also be verified analytically ; the transformation given in eq.([eq02 ] ) only introduces a shift to the solutions of the cubic nlse .",
    "in this study we have developed a numerical framework to study how the chaotic perturbations in the ocean current profile lead to the development of the rogue waves on the ocean surface .",
