    "feedback is widely used in engineering to control certain properties of a system .",

    "many applications of feedback have been proposed for single quantum systems , such as , besides single - mode cavity fields , also for single atoms or generic harmonic oscillators .",
    "moreover , extensions to time - delayed non - markovian feedback have been derived  @xcite and coherent feedback  @xcite and feedback using weak measurements  @xcite have been studied .",
    "furthermore , alternative approaches to feedback have been presented in the context of quantum - state estimation and quantum control  @xcite .    besides laser cooling  @xcite",

    "einstein condensation of dilute gases of alkali species  @xcite and atomic hydrogen  @xcite , the experimental realization of atom lasers  @xcite and the implementation of micro- and nanostructured atom - optical devices  @xcite .",
    "this experimental progress draws attention to the investigation of many - atom systems and their condensate features from a quantum - optical viewpoint . in view of the experimental capabilities up to date , it is quite promising to engage in developing methods for controlling complex many - atom systems , such as produced nowadays in the laboratory .",
    "the use of feedback methods acting on accessible macroscopic observables of the system appears particularly desirable .",
    "an experimental implementation of it would not require the active intervention of the experimenter , but would act as a self - automated basic technological tool , such as it is now in engineering .",
    "unfortunately , for the case of feedback acting on a multi - mode many - atom system , the existing descriptions of feedback are in general not applicable : when trying to access arbitrary properties of the system , these methods become intractable , due to the required vast number of degrees of freedom .",
    "typically employed mean - field approximations , could be used to factorize or truncate higher - order many - atom correlations , in order to simplify the problem . in the considered case",
    ", however , the feedback operation contains the measurement of a macrostate observable of the many - atom system , to which all atoms contribute . the collective access to the atoms in such a measurement induces strong correlations between them .",
    "these correlations represent a main ingredient of the feedback and should be taken care of in a non - approximate way .",
    "the formation of correlations becomes clear when considering that an observed measurement outcome of a macrostate observable can be produced by a vast number of different microstates , that all enter the feedback operation in a coherent superposition .",
    "such superposition states may contain strong correlations between the atoms and one may therefore expect that in general many - atom quantum correlations play a dominant role in the dynamics of the feedbacked system .",
    "correlations of this type are usually generated by interactions between atoms , such as for example two - body collisions . in the case",
    "considered here , such explicit interactions will not be taken into account .",
    "the many - atom correlations will solely be generated by the measurement process .",
    "an interaction between the atoms can in fact be identified in the measurement .",
    "the measurement process can be thought of as a probe field interacting with all the atoms with a subsequent projection of the probe by the final readout of the measurement result .",
    "thus we may imagine an effective interaction between the atoms being mediated via the probe field .    in the following an exact method",
    "is presented for describing the reduced single - atom dynamics under the influence of feedback operations acting on macroscopic observables of a bosonic multi - mode many - atom system .",
    "the feedback loop consists of a measurement with predefined measurement uncertainty @xmath0 and a subsequent unitary operation that again acts on all atoms of the system .",
    "the feedback loop is assumed to act instantaneously without time delay between measurement and operation .",
    "as will be shown , the many - atom correlations , that are generated by the measurement , can be formally incorporated into the single - atom dynamics by introducing a dynamically evolving additional degree of freedom .",
    "thus the free evolution intermitted by feedback operations can be formulated in terms of a quasi single - atom dynamics , revealing modifications to the feedback dynamics of a true single - atom system .",
    "the paper is structured as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec:2 ] the macroscopic observables needed for the feedback are introduced .",
    "furthermore , the effect of the feedback on the many - atom quantum state is described and a first indication of the importance of atom - atom correlations is given .",
    "section  [ sec:3 ] proceeds by introducing a specially designed correlation function that is shown to allow for a closed description of the feedback . besides the dynamical evolution during the free evolution between feedback operations , also",
    "an interpretation of this correlation function is presented .",
    "an application of the developed method to the case of a condensed bosonic gas is given in sec .",

    "[ sec:5 ] .",
    "the feedback loop shall be considered as a measurement of a macroscopic observable @xmath1 of the system and the use of the so obtained information , i.e. , the measured value @xmath2 , for applying a unitary operation , @xmath3 , on the system .",
    "information is therefore gained by measurements and used to manipulate the system , cf .",
    "[ fig : scheme ] .    for the macroscopic observable we may think of any extensive quantity of the system , i.e. , a quantity that has additive contributions from each atom in the system . thus measurements are not performed on single atoms but on large numbers of atoms .",

    "( [ eq : sp - comm ] ) .    however , due to the appearance of the atom - number operator @xmath22 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : mp - proper - b ] ) , the operator @xmath25 is not bidiagonal in the atom - field operators .",
    "it is an intensive quantity and not an extensive one and thus is not a simple sum of contributions of the individual atoms .",
    "thus it can not be experimentally realized by application of an external field ( e.g. laser field ) that interacts with each individual atom . in other words ,",
    "the problem is , that the total number of atoms is in principle unknown without its particular measurement . for the feedback action we need to know",
    "how many atoms have contributed to the previously measured quantity @xmath2 .",
    "the lack of this knowledge is a potential source of imperfection of the overall feedback action .",
    "this problem can be overcome in two ways : either in each feedback loop not only @xmath1 but also the atom number @xmath22 is measured , or the atom number is estimated .",
    "we will here concentrate on the latter approach , where the estimated number of atoms @xmath26 may be derived from a priori knowledge about the system , without additional measurements .",
    "it is worth noting , that neglecting this issue by replacing @xmath22 by its average @xmath27 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : mp - proper - b ] ) , but still assuming the commutator relation  ( [ eq : mp - proper - comm ] ) , results in the neglect of atom - number fluctuations .",
    "such an approach is only valid when the atom number is exact . considering the case where only part of the system is subject to the feedback , say only atoms being located in a predefined spatial region , an exact atom number in this region is rather doubtful even when the total number is precisely known .",
    "such an approximation can be avoided by consistently defining the operator @xmath25 by use of the estimated atom number @xmath26 , @xmath28 and using the resulting commutator relations @xmath29 = i \\hat{n } / n_{\\rm e } , \\qquad [ \\hat{a } ,     \\hat{n } ] = [ \\hat{b } , \\hat{n } ] = 0 .\\ ] ] the measurement outcome is then a pure addition of all single - atom contributions .",
    "and the subsequent unitary operation will feed back the appropriately estimated part to each atom .",
    "let us now consider the action of the feedback loop on the quantum state of the many - atom system .",
    "let @xmath30 be times infinitesimally before and after the time @xmath31 when the feedback is applied .",
    "the action of the feedback on the many - atom density operator @xmath32 then reads @xmath33 it expresses the relation between the many - atom density operators @xmath34 and @xmath35 before and after the feedback , respectively .",

    "conceptual differences from the behavior of a true single - atom system are revealed when regarding the variances of these properties .",
    "the variance of @xmath53 reflects the expected increase of noise due to the back - action of the measurement : @xmath54 however , the variance of @xmath50 , i.e. , of the single - atom version of the measured observable , does not correspond to that expected for the feedback acting on a single - atom system : @xmath55    for @xmath56 atom in the system we have @xmath57 and therefore the first two terms on the r.h.s .",

    "equation ( [ eq : a - var ] ) can be interpreted as follows : the uncertainty of the single - atom observable @xmath50 is reduced by the gain of knowledge on the macroscopic observable @xmath2 .",

    "( [ eq : a - var ] ) contains atom - atom correlations of the type @xmath59 , as can be seen from the definition ( [ eq : ops - mp ] ) .",
    "therefore , the amount of compensation of noise in the single - atom properties due to the feedback depends on many - atom quantum correlations .",
    "the determination of these correlations requires a hierarchy of equations for higher - order atom correlations . to incorporate all these correlations in a consistent way",

    "the vector @xmath76 could be formally interpreted as being an additional degree of freedom of the single atom , so that we may view the complete feedback dynamics as a quasi single - atom problem .",

    "figure  [ fig : example ] shows the variance of the single - atom momentum in dependence on the atom number for three different measurement uncertainties @xmath0 .",
    "one observes that for larger numbers of atoms , the momentum variance converges to the initial ground - state variance @xmath139 , which establishes the regime of weak measurements where the single atom is only weakly affected by the measurement of the feedback loop . for only a few atoms the dependence on the chosen measurement resolution indicates an increasing amount of atom - atom correlations with decreasing measurement uncertainty . for larger measurement uncertainties a @xmath146 behavior will appear in the single - atom momentum variance , as would be expected classically when the measurement uncertainty is equally distributed among all atoms [ cf .",

    "the introduced unique correlation function obeys closed equations of motion for the feedback operation and the free - evolution dynamics .",
