    "@xmath0-(bedt - ttf)@xmath1cu(scn)@xmath1 is one of the best characterized organic superconductors  @xcite .",
    "it is a highly anisotropic material with a quasi - two dimensional band structure , whose fermi - surface topology has been determined by magnetotransport experiments  @xcite . at ambient pressure",
    "@xmath0-(bedt - ttf)@xmath1cu(scn)@xmath1 is a superconductor with a transition temperature of @xmath4  k. @xmath5 decreases upon the application of pressure until , at pressures @xmath6 exceeding 0.5  gpa , superconductivity is fully suppressed  @xcite .",
    "the quasiparticle effective mass , @xmath7 , derived from magnetic quantum oscillation measurements , decreases linearly with pressure up to 0.5  gpa ; above this pressure the magnitude of d@xmath7/d@xmath6 is strongly reduced  @xcite .",
    "the effective mass measured in this fashion includes contributions from both electron - phonon and electron - electron interactions  @xcite .",
    "in contrast , the optical mass , @xmath8 , extracted from a sum over the optical conductivity , decreases approximately linearly throughout the above pressure range  @xcite .",
    "this mass is thought to be dominated by intraband electronic processes , reflecting the band mass without renormalization by electron - electron and electron - phonon interactions  @xcite .",
    "the coincidence of a ` kink ' in the pressure dependence of @xmath7 with the pressure above which superconductivity is suppressed and the absence of a ` kink ' in the pressure dependence of @xmath8 , suggests that the interactions parameterized by @xmath7 maybe associated with the superconductivity .",
    "the key question to address is the effect of these interactions , _",
    "i.e. _ what is the dominant pairing mechanism for superconductivity in this material ? in this paper we compare infrared ( ir ) @xcite and raman scattering @xcite measurements under pressure to determine the role of the electron - phonon interaction .",
    "this is possible because the ir measurement probes the molecular vibrations dressed by the electron - phonon interaction @xcite , whereas non - resonant raman measurements probe the bare mode frequencies @xcite .",
    "the primary effect of the electron - phonon interaction is to soften the ir modes with respect to the raman modes , as illustrated in figure  [ irrfig1 ] .     molecular vibration , raman spectra ( solid lines ) and infrared spectra with polarization parallel to the crystallographic _ b_-axis ( dotted lines ) , for a selection of pressures at room temperature .",
    "the spectra are offset for clarity and the vertical lines are a guide to the eye .",
    "note the substantial softening effect of the increased electron - phonon interaction on the ir spectra with respect to the raman spectrum.,width=321 ]    there are two approaches to modelling the electron - molecular vibration coupling interaction and associated mode softening in organic charge transfer systems , the  phase - phonon \" theory and the  dimer charge - oscillation \" model .",
    "the phase - phonon theory approaches the problem from an electron band approximation where the charge carriers are naturally delocalized .",
    "the alternative dimer charge - oscillation theory is formulated in real space such that the electronic behaviour is implicitly localized . in reality",
    "the electronic properties of @xmath0-(bedt - ttf)@xmath1cu(scn)@xmath1 are somewhere between the extremes of a localized and itinerant system  @xcite .",
    "for this reason we apply both the dimer charge - oscillation and phase - phonon models to analyze the data .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section  [ modess ]",
    "we describe the vibrational spectra of @xmath0-(bedt - ttf)@xmath1cu(scn)@xmath1 as observed by both non - resonant raman scattering and polarized ir reflectivity .",
    "section  [ ssanalysis ] describes the methods of analysis , specifically how the pressure dependence of the electron - phonon coupling is extracted .",
    "the first subsection of the discussion , section  [ m * ] , contains a comparison of the quasiparticle masses that result from the different methods of analysis .",
    "subsequently , in section  [ tcss ] , in light of the pressure dependence of the electron - phonon coupling , the implications for the superconducting pairing mechanism are discussed .",
    "conclusions are summarized in section  [ conc ] .",
    "four modes are observed in both the high - pressure room - temperature raman and ir spectra ( see figures  [ ppfitb ] and [ ppfitc ] and table  [ wtable ] ) .",
    "they are labeled with subscripts indicating the atoms / bond predominantly involved in the vibration @xcite . in order of increasing frequency",
    "they are the c - s mode originating from the bedt - ttf 60b@xmath9 asymmetric vibration , the central c = c mode originating from the bedt - ttf 3a@xmath10 symmetric vibration and two cu(scn)@xmath1 anion modes . determining the pressure dependence of the central c = c mode in the ir spectrum is not straightforward due to the overlap of several modes with varying pressure dependences . in a recent publication @xcite , ir spectra from the deuterated salt",
    "have been used to model this fermi resonance and extract the linear pressure dependence of the overlapping modes ( the central c = c mode and two c - h modes ) .",
    "the ir and raman frequencies and the first order pressure dependence of all modes discussed here are given in table  [ wtable ] .",
    "the cu(scn)@xmath1 anion modes do not exhibit any evidence of electron - phonon coupling , _",
    "i.e. _ the difference between the infrared and raman frequencies for the anion modes is accounted for by purely vibrational coupling  @xcite .",
    "the zone center frequency separation , @xmath11 , between the symmetric ( raman active ) and antisymmetric ( infrared active ) combinations of the molecular vibrations is determined by the frequency of the optical branch of the lattice modes @xcite .",
    "the larger observed @xmath11 for the anion mode in the _ b_-axis response , for which the lattice mode is stiffer ( see table  [ wtable ] ) , is a further confirmation of the lattice mode assignment given in @xcite .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     to calculate @xmath12 for each mode the full diamond / sample ir reflectance spectrum  @xcite is fitted at each pressure - point .",
    "the model function for this fit consists of the phase - phonon model plus a high frequency contribution to the dielectric constant , @xmath13 , and a highly damped lorentzian oscillator to account for the anomalous electronic damping at room temperature  @xcite .",
    "the plasma frequency , electronic damping and perturbed and unperturbed interband transition frequencies are treated as free parameters . as with a simple drude response , the plasma frequency parameterizes the density of states and band curvature , but in this case the electronic damping controls the relative spectral weights of the inter- and intraband processes .",
    "four phase - phonon collective modes ( @xmath14 ) are used to model the spectrum , one for the c - s mode and three for the c = c mode and its fermi resonance with the c - h modes .",
    "it was found that the line shape of the fermi resonance could be reproduced in an analogous manner to the green s function model used in @xcite , _",
    "i.e. _ with one strongly coupled c = c mode and two c - h modes with negligible electron - phonon coupling ( see the inset of figures  [ ppfitb ] and [ ppfitc ] ) . the pressure dependence of the modes raman frequencies and the pressure dependence of the dips from the green s function model were used to fix the frequency of the collective modes .",
    "their damping and coupling strengths were left as free parameters , however .    in this model the degree of mode softening associated with the electron - phonon coupling is predominantly parameterized by the perturbation to the interband transition , _",
    "i.e. _ the difference between the perturbed and unperturbed transition frequencies . the coupling strength , @xmath12 , controls the mode softening to a lesser extent , mainly parameterizing the spectral weight associated with each mode .",
    "because of this , correctly determining @xmath15 relies on accurately modelling the background reflectance in the spectral region containing the modes . to this end",
    ", it was found that including the heavily damped lorentzian to help model this material s anomalous drude response drastically reduced the scatter in the @xmath15 data .",
    "the three parameters describing the lorentzian , @xmath16,@xmath17 and @xmath18 , were also free .",
    "the lineshape of the anion modes is most accurately reproduced using uncoupled lorentzian oscillators .",
    "owing to their lack of electron coupling and their limited contribution to the spectrum , parameters describing them were not included in this model .",
    "figures  [ ppfitb ] and [ ppfitc ] indicate the quality of the fits for a representative selection of pressures .",
    "manually fitting 31 spectra , each consisting of 3300 data points , with an expression containing 12 free parameters , for each polarization , is both immensely time consuming and subject to systematic human error . to avoid this a batch fitting procedure",
    "was employed .",
    "it consists of accurately fitting a limited number of data sets to determine approximate trends for the free parameters .",
    "these are then used as the the starting conditions for an automatic least - squares fitting procedure of all data sets .",
    "each fit is then checked visually for acceptance of its parameters .",
    "the value of the free parameters and their first order pressure shifts extracted from figures  [ pppargraph1 ] and [ pplambdagraph1 ] are contained in table  [ pptable1 ] .",
    "the difference in the values of the coupling constants , @xmath15 , obtained from the phase - phonon model ( table [ pptable1 ] ) and the dimer charge - oscillation model(table [ ltable ] ) are predominantly due to the different values for the interband transition used in each calculation .",
    "as well as vibrational features the room temperature ir spectrum of @xmath0-(bedt - ttf)@xmath1cu(scn)@xmath1 contains broad electronic features ; a heavly damped drude - like response in the far - infrared and a mid - infrared ( mir ) ` hump ' . regarding the mir ` hump '",
    "the literature only agrees to the extent that it originates from excitation across a gap in the electronic spectrum  @xcite .",
    "the simplest picture is to assign it to a gap in the single electron band structure @xcite .",
    "this model is improved by including electron - electron interaction effects @xcite . in this case",
    "the ` hump ' originates from a combination of the single electron band gap and the onsite correlation energy . which is considered dominant , and which the perturbation , depends upon how correlated the system is believed to be .",
    "analogously , inclusion of the electron - phonon interaction modifies the electronic spectrum .",
    "the phase - phonon model includes this explicitly as a relatively small perturbation to the band gap . in the limit of large electron - phonon coupling the strain - field",
    "is considered to localize the charge carrier @xcite , in which case the small polaron binding energy will be the band gap dressed by the electron - phonon interaction .",
    "all these theories share the common assumption that ir active interband electronic processes are subject to remormalization by many - body effects . in the following subsection",
    "we do not attempt to identify the origin of the renormalizations , but present evidence of their influence on the pressure dependence of the electronic contributions to the ir spectrum .",
    "this subsection focuses on the pressure dependence of the carrier effective mass extracted from modeling with the phase - phonon theory .",
    "the plasma frequency , @xmath19 , parameterizes the charge carrier density , @xmath20 , and effective mass , here denoted @xmath21 , @xmath22 for our actual pressure range the band filling is independent of pressure and the carrier density only has a small pressure dependence arising from the reduction in unit cell parameters @xcite .    for a plasma frequency dominated by intraband processes the pressure dependence of @xmath21 arises solely from the pressure dependence of the band parameters @xcite , _",
    "i.e. _ the increase in band width and curvature as the wave function overlap increases .",
    "we argue that if the plasma frequency also parameterizes the interband processes it will contain contributions from quasiparticle mass renormalization .",
    "the first point to note ( see section  [ ppmodel ] ) is that the plasma frequency in the phase phonon model not only describes screening ability of the free carriers ( the intraband response ) but also the density of states and band curvatures associated with intraband absorption .",
    "thus following the preceeding logic the mass @xmath21 will to some extent be renormalized by many - body effects  @xcite .",
    "the second point to note is that using the pressure dependence of the raman modes to constrain the mode frequencies for the phase - phonon model significantly reduces the parameter space encountered when modeling the ir response of this system .",
    "this is not only because it eliminates the mode frequencies as free parameters , but because the softening of the modes is dependent upon the perturbation to the band gap , @xmath23 . in this manner",
    "the mode frequencies provide further constraint to the parameters describing the electronic response .",
    "the parameters describing the electronic response are thus believed to have greater validity than those obtained from a simple drude - lorentz fit  @xcite .",
    "the pressure dependence of the effective masses @xmath21 obtained using the phase - phonon theory is shown in figures  [ mbstar1 ]  and  [ mcstar1 ] .     for light polarized parallel to the _ b_-axis , deduced from the phase - phonon fit to the optical data . for @xmath24 , @xmath25 and d@xmath26 .",
    "for @xmath27 , @xmath28 and d@xmath29 . , width=340 ]     for light polarized parallel to the _ c_-axis , deduced from the phase - phonon fit to the optical data . for @xmath24 , @xmath30 and d@xmath31 . for @xmath27 , @xmath32 and d@xmath33.,width=340 ]    for both polarization directions @xmath21 decreases with the application of pressure .",
    "for both polarizations this decrease is clearly nonlinear and this is highlighted by linear fits to the low ( @xmath34  gpa ) and high pressure regions ( @xmath35  gpa)(see fig .",
    "[ mbstar1 ]  and  [ mcstar1 ] ) .",
    "these pressure ranges were chosen because the _ b_-axis @xmath36 clearly exhibits a change of slope at @xmath37  gpa .",
    "the trend in @xmath38 for polarization parallel to the _ c_-axis is far less clear - cut .",
    "band structure calculations giving the pressure dependence of the bare band mass  @xcite indicate a sublinear behaviour for its pressure dependence .",
    "however this is a much smaller correction to linear behavior than observed here and fails to reproduce the change in slope at @xmath37  gpa .",
    "the coincidence of ` kinks ' in the pressure dependence of @xmath39 obtained here and @xmath7 from magnetic quantum oscillation data  @xcite is thus an indication that the phase - phonon fitting procedure is sensitive to many - body effects .",
    "it is these renormalizations which are known to strongly influence superconductivity in this material  @xcite .",
    "it has been shown previously @xcite that the usual electron - acoustic phonon interaction mechanism is unable to account for the magnitude of the electron - phonon coupling constant or the large pressure dependence of @xmath5 in the bedt - ttf superconductors .",
    "a further refinement @xcite includes the attractive interaction mediated by the a@xmath10 molecular modes , with the total electron - phonon coupling constant , @xmath40 , given by a yamaji sum over the individual a@xmath10 molecular modes .",
    "the energy scale for the interaction is set by the debye frequency , @xmath41 @xcite .",
    "_ @xcite have previously inferred @xmath42  40cm@xmath3 by fitting the effective mass dependence of @xmath5 with a linearised eliashberg equation using an einstein density of phonon states , @xmath44 .",
    "high and low temperature specific heat measurements @xcite yield values of @xmath41 ranging from 38cm@xmath3 to 140cm@xmath3 . calculations of @xmath40 @xcite give values ranging from 0.25 - 0.45 @xcite .    the weak - coupling bcs formula",
    "@xcite gives a satisfactory functional description of the ambient pressure @xmath5 @xcite and describes the effective mass dependence of the superconducting transition temperature @xcite.however , the fact that the weak - coupling bcs expression describes @xmath5 versus @xmath45 well @xcite should not be taken to imply that @xmath0-(bedt - ttf)@xmath1cu(scn)@xmath1 is a weak - coupling bcs superconductor .",
    "the formula is used here as a convenient parameterization which is known to describe earlier data well @xcite .",
    "the pressure derivative of the weak - coupling bcs formula provides a convenient parametrization of @xmath46 in terms of @xmath47 , @xmath48 .",

    "there is sufficient uncertainty in the calculations of @xmath56 that an accurate estimate for its pressure dependence can not be made @xcite .",
    "however , @xmath56 is known to scale with the density of states at the fermi energy  @xcite , which will decrease with the application of pressure  @xcite .",
    "thus if @xmath56 is positive  @xcite it will decrease with pressure and omitting @xmath57 from equation  [ presstc ] will result in an overestimate for the rate of suppression of @xmath5 with pressure .",
    "a negative value of @xmath56 indicates that direct ( non phonon - mediated ) electron - electron interactions are involved in the pairing  @xcite which are not measured by these experiments .",
    "consequently @xmath55 is ignored in equation  [ presstc ] .",
    "estimates for the pressure dependence of the electron - phonon coupling constant , based on the vibrations sampled and the two methods of calculation are used to calculate the right - hand side of equation  [ presstc ] .",
    "it should be emphasized that the two models we are employing to estimate the pressure dependence of the electron - phonon coupling constant lie at opposite limits of our sample s behaviour , the dimer charge - oscillation model being the limit of a localized electronic system and the phase - phonon model the limit of an itinerant system . a conclusion common to both methods of analysis should thus be a robust one .",
    "employing the dimer charge model , @xmath40 is assumed to have a pressure dependence similar to that of the strongly coupled c = c mode , _",
    "i.e. _ of the order of -17  @xmath2gpa@xmath3 , with an upper limit of -20@xmath2gpa@xmath3 used in this calculation .",
    "this gives @xmath59  -40@xmath60gpa@xmath3 , which is far from the experimentally observed value of @xmath59  -200  % gpa@xmath3 @xmath51@xmath52 $ ] .",
    "as can be seen from ( [ presstc2 ] ) , @xmath41 logarithmically scales with the dependence of the pressure derivative of @xmath61 on the pressure derivative of the coupling constant . thus to obtain the observed rapid fall of @xmath5 with pressure from only the decrease in the electron - phonon coupling constant requires @xmath41 to be of the order of the c = c mode frequency , @xmath53  1500  cm@xmath3 .",
    "such a value is inconsistent with the 10  k superconducting temperature and the unconventional isotope shift observed upon carbon substitution @xcite .",
    "thus , the electron - phonon coupling as extracted from the dimer - charge - oscillation model can not be the relevant parameter for superconductivity in our organic superconductor .",
    "the pressure dependence of the electron - phonon coupling constant derived from the phase - phonon model provides far less clear - cut results . in this case",
    "@xmath40 is assumed to have a pressure dependence of -40@xmath5020  @xmath2gpa@xmath3 , a value consistent with the phase - phonon calculation of @xmath15 for all observed modes .",
    "this gives @xmath59  -90  @xmath2gpa@xmath3 with the asymmetric error of + 150 and -77  @xmath2gpa@xmath3 . the upper bound of this estimate is close to the experimentally observed value of @xmath62  -200  % gpa@xmath3 @xmath51@xmath52 $ ] .",
    "thus , the upper estimate of all parameters would be required to explain the pressure dependence of @xmath58 as arising solely due to a reduction in the electron - phonon coupling constant .",
    "again , it should be stressed that the dimer charge - oscillation model represents the limit of localized electronic behaviour and the phase - phonon model represents the limit of itinerant electronic behaviour .",
    "the true properties of @xmath0-(bedt - ttf)@xmath1cu(scn)@xmath1 under these experimental conditions are believed to lie somewhere between these extremes .",
    "both models have similar conclusions , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath63 can not be reproduced within weak coupling bcs theory .",
    "the fact that the similar conclusions are drawn when employing either model suggests that they are robust .",
    "use of the dimer charge - oscillation model casts considerable doubt on whether this material is a simple bcs superconductor because the characteristic energy of the pairing interaction would have to be of the order of the highest frequency molecular modes , a value inconsistent with the 10  k superconducting transition temperature .",
    "however this conclusion must be treated with caution due to the numerous assumptions involved in applying this model of a localized system to the coupling between the molecular vibrations and delocalized conduction electrons .",
    "doubt on whether this material is a simple bcs superconductor is also cast by the application of the phase - phonon model , because the upper estimate of all parameters is required to explain the experimentally observed suppression of @xmath5 with pressure .",
    "this indicates that electron - electron interaction may be playing a significant role in this material s superconducting mechanism .",
    "it is worth noting that there is mounting evidence in support of this conclusion .",
    "both experimental @xcite and theoretical @xcite , studies predict that the superconducting order parameter in this material has an ` exotic ' d - wave symmetry , a property predicted for a superconducting state whose pairing is mediated by spin fluctuations @xcite , _ i.e. _ direct electron - electron interaction  @xcite .",
    "comparison of high - pressure raman scattering and infrared reflectivity data provides an alternative method for probing the quasiparticle contributions to effective mass enhancement known to be intimately connected to superconductivity in this material  @xcite .",
    "it also enables the pressure dependence of the electron - phonon coupling strength to be evaluated for modes observed in both spectra . using the weak coupling limit of bcs theory the pressure dependence of the electron - phonon coupling constant",
    "is compared to the pressure dependence of the superconducting transition temperature .",
    "this casts doubt on whether this material is a simple bcs superconductor , an indication that electron - electron interaction may be playing a significant role in this material s superconducting mechanism .",
