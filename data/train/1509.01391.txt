    "monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides , mx@xmath0 ( m = mo , w ; x = s , se ) , have aroused much interest recently due to their remarkable properties for applications in next - generation nanoelectronic and energy conversion devices @xcite .",
    "since all these applications are closely related to its thermal properties , it is necessary to investigate the lattice dynamics and thermodynamic properties of mx@xmath0 .",
    "for instance , high - performance electronic devices strongly depend on high thermal conductivity for highly efficient heat dissipation , while low thermal conductivity is preferred in thermoelectric application .    in semiconductors",
    ", heat is carried by the atomic vibrations that are quantized as phonons @xcite .",
    "theoretical predictions based on the phonon boltzmann transport equation have found that monolayer ws@xmath0 has the highest thermal conductivity ( 142 w / mk ) at room temperature , then followed by mos@xmath0 ( 103 w / mk ) and mose@xmath0 ( 54 w / mk ) @xcite . however , the measured thermal conductivity for monolayer mos@xmath0 and ws@xmath0 is @xmath1 w / mk @xcite and 32 w / mk @xcite , respectively , which is much lower than the theoretical predictions .",
    "furthermore , various phonon properties such as interatomic bonding and anharmonic vibrations still lack a unified understanding .",
    "the parameters that affect phonon transport include crystal structure , atomic mass , interatomic bonding , and anharmonicity @xcite .",
    "generally there are four rules for finding a nonmetallic crystal with higher thermal conductivity , including ( i ) lower average atomic mass , ( ii ) stronger interatomic bonding , ( iii ) simpler crystal structure , and ( iv ) lower anharmonicity @xcite .",
    "all monolayer mx@xmath0 compounds have similar crystal structures , while conditions ( i ) and ( ii ) imply a larger debye temperature , and condition ( iv ) means smaller grneisen parameter .",
    "recent theoretical investigation has provided a quantitative analysis of the roles of mass , structure , and bond strength in thermal expansion and thermomechanics of mx@xmath0 @xcite .",
    "however , the roles of mass , interatomic bonding , and anharmonic vibrations in phonon transport still remain uninvestigated .",
    "clear knowledge of the underlying physics will be helpful for understanding and modulating the thermal transport in mx@xmath0 , for example , through doping other m or x atoms @xcite .",
    "here we investigate fundamental vibrational properties to understand thermal transport in mos@xmath0 , mose@xmath0 , and ws@xmath0 .",
    "the measured phonon frequencies are well reproduced in our calculations .",
    "the thermodynamic properties are calculated within quasi - harmonic approximation , and the calculated thermal conductivities agree well with the measurements . combining first principles calculations and the slack model ,",
    "the roles of mass , interatomic bonding , and anharmonicity in thermal transport are clearly revealed .",
    "all calculations are implemented in the vienna _ ab initio _ simulation package ( vasp ) based on the density functional theory ( dft ) method @xcite .",
    "the perdew , burke , and ernzerhof ( pbe ) parametrization within the generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) is used for the exchange - correlation functional .",

    "is used during structural relaxation for the unit cell until the energy differences are converged within 10@xmath3 ev , with a hellman - feynman force convergence threshold of 10@xmath4 ev /  .",
    "we maintain the interlayer vacuum spacing larger than 12   to eliminate the interaction with periodic boundary condition .    in the calculation of phonon dispersion , the harmonic interatomic force constants ( ifcs )",
    "are obtained by density functional perturbation theory ( dfpt ) using the supercell approach , which calculates the dynamical matrix through the linear response of electron density @xcite . the 5@xmath25@xmath21 supercell with 5@xmath25@xmath21 * k*-mesh",

    "the total dos from -7 to 10 ev is mainly composed of m-@xmath13 and x-@xmath14 states , and the bands on each side of the band gap originate primarily from m-@xmath13 states , which is in agreement with previous work @xcite .",
    "due to a less localized dos of w atoms , the overlap between w-@xmath13 and s-@xmath14 state in the valence band of ws@xmath0 from -7 to 0 ev is larger than other two materials , indicating a strong covalent @xmath15 bonding .",

    "[ charge ] , the w - s bonding is the strongest , whereas the mo - se bonding is weaker than the mo - s bonding , which is consistent with the projected dos in fig .",
    "usually , strong interatomic bonding and low average atomic mass imply a large debye temperature , leading to a high thermal conductivity . from fig .",
    "[ dos ] , it is found that the @xmath13 state of transition metal m play an important role in determining the interatomic bonding , which will further affect the heat transport in these three materials .",

    "[ phonon ] presents the phonon spectra along several high symmetry directions , together with the corresponding projected phonon density of states ( pdos ) .",
    "the primitive cell of monolayer mx@xmath0 contains 3 atoms , corresponding to three acoustic and six optical phonon branches .",
    "the average acoustic debye temperature for monolayer mx@xmath0 is determined from @xcite    @xmath17    where @xmath18 for each acoustic branch @xmath19 ( @xmath20 la , ta ) is defined as    @xmath21    where @xmath22 is planck constant , @xmath23 is the phonon frequency at the zone boundary of the @xmath19-th acoustic mode , and @xmath24 is boltzmann constant .",
    "the calculated debye temperature @xmath25 for mos@xmath0 , mose@xmath0 , and ws@xmath0 are 262.3 k , 177.6 k , and 213.6 k , respectively , which is in good agreement with previous results , @xmath26 260 - 320 k for mos@xmath0 estimated from specific - heat measurement @xcite , 197.3@xmath276.6 k for mose@xmath0 estimated from photoconductivity measurements @xcite , 210 k for ws@xmath0 estimated from the lindemann formula @xcite .    concerning thermal vibrations and the bonding forces",
    ", the debye temperature is a measure of the temperature above which all modes begin to be excited and below which modes begin to be frozen out @xcite .",
    "we first investigate the relation between vibrational modes and the debye temperature by calculating the projected pdoss for the m(xy ) , m(z ) , x(xy ) , and x(z ) vibrations in mx@xmath0 stuctures as shown in fig .",
    "[ phonon ] .",
    "similar to the diatomic linear chain model , the scale of the acoustic ( optical ) phonon branch is dominated by atoms with larger ( smaller ) mass in three materials . as the mass ratio of all studied mx@xmath0 ( @xmath28 ) in table  [ debyemass ] show ,",
    "the acoustic phonon vibration in the pdos is governed by the larger mass .",
    "the mass ratio of mos@xmath0 is most close to 1 , while that of ws@xmath0 is much larger 1 .",
    "therefore the low - frequency acoustic phonon branches of mos@xmath0 up to 233.9 @xmath29 are mainly from the mo(xy ) , mo(z ) and s(xy ) vibrations due to similar mass , whereas those of ws@xmath0 up to 182.3 @xmath29 are mainly from the w(xy ) and w(z ) vibrations due to the much larger mass of w atoms .",
    "in contrast to other two materials , the mass of transition metal atoms in mose@xmath0 is smaller than the mass of chalcogenide atoms .",
    "thus , although all mo(xy ) , mo(z ) , se(xy ) , and se(z ) vibrations contribute significantly to the low - frequency branches of mose@xmath0 up to 157.5 @xmath29 , the pdos of the se(xy ) and se(z ) vibrations is higher than other two vibrations due to the relatively larger mass of se atoms .    furthermore , low average atomic mass @xmath30 , besides the strong interatomic bonding mentioned above , can lead to a large debye temperature as well .",
    "the mass differences in mos@xmath0 , mose@xmath0 , and ws@xmath0 are also shown in table  [ debyemass ] .",
    "for mos@xmath0 and mose@xmath0 which have similar bonding characteristics as shown in fig .",
    "[ charge ] , the @xmath30 of mos@xmath0 is approximately two thirds the @xmath30 of mose@xmath0 , and the calculated @xmath31 is about 1.5 times larger . for ws@xmath0 , although it has close mass to mose@xmath0 , the strong covalent w - s bonding as shown in fig .",
    "[ charge ] , can result in relatively larger debye temperature as implied in previous work @xcite .",
    "therefore , although the average atomic mass plays a key role in determining the debye temperature , the effect of interatomic bonding can not be neglected and should be taken into account when studying the thermal transport properties of monolayer mx@xmath0 .",
