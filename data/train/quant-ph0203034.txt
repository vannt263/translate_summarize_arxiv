    "this article is a brief introduction to an effort to compute the otherwise mathematical noncomputable .",
    "the new ingredients here for this effort are those supplied by physical principles , the quantum principles in particular , and situated outside the domain of mathematics where the limits of computability are set .    in the next section",
    "we will summarise the important concept of turing machines and their relationship to the mathematical recursive functions .",
    "they will set the scene for the notion of computability as delimited by the church - turing hypothesis .",
    "we then review the noncomputable results for the turing halting problem and the equivalent hilbert s tenth problem , which is directly accessible for some quantum - mechanical exploration in a later section .",
    "we also introduce some other noncomputable problems and the chaitin s @xmath0 numbers before moving on to a discussion of quantum mechanics and quantum computation in secs .",
    "[ sec : qm ] and  [ sec : qc ] .    in sec .",
    "[ sec : qm ] , we emphasise the concept of coherent states and the quantum adiabatic theorem in order to introduce the model of quantum computation by adiabatic processes in sec .  [",
    "sec : qc ] . with this computation model",
    "we then propose a quantum algorithm for hilbert s tenth problem in sec .",
    "[ sec:10 ] ( where the illustrating examples are done in collaboration with andrew rawlinson ) , and discuss some of its finer points in the following sec .",
    "[ sec : dis ] . to explore the limits of this quantum algorithm",
    "we also consider some generalisation for other noncomputables in sec .",
    "[ sec : qcothers ] .    before concluding with some remarks in the final section",
    ", we present a reformulation of hilbert s tenth problem , as inspired by our quantum algorithm , in terms of an infinitely coupled set of differential equations in sec .",
    "[ sec : reform ] .",
    "the concept of computation is at the heart of mathematics and hard sciences but it was only made precise by alan turing relatively recently , at the beginning of the twentieth century  @xcite . with the introduction of theoretical and mathematically well - defined machines ,",
    "turing was able to capture the essence of computation processes and algorithms .",
    "there are a few other models of computation  @xcite but they all , except possibly the quantum model to be considered later on , can be shown to be equivalent to that given by turing machines .",
    "turing machines are equipped with an infinite one - dimensional tape over which a head can move in discrete single steps backward and forward .",
    "what symbol is already on the tape directly beneath the head and what state the head is in will specify the new symbol ( including the blank symbol ) to be written , if at all , over the old one and the new state of the head and the direction in which the head moves next .",
    "there needs to be only a finite number of such symbols , similar to the finiteness of the number of letters in the english alphabet .",
    "the number of available states for the head is also finite .",
    "everything about the machine is actually finite despite the appearance of the infinite tape  of which only a finite , but unbounded , portion will ever be used .",
    "the infiniteness requirement for the tape is only there to enable the accommodation of unbounded but finite sequences of  words \" and  sentences \" which can be meaningfully made out from the symbol alphabets .",
    "initially , a finite portion of an otherwise blank tape is prepared with some suitably encoded input for the turing machine .",
    "each turing machine can do only one specific task as completely defined by the transition function @xmath1 : @xmath2 once the task is done , the machine goes into a special halt state and stops with the output written out on the tape ready to be inspected .",
    "transition functions are but representations for computer programs implementing algorithms in general ; so we will use interchangeably the names turing machines and programs .",
    "such deceptively simple machines are so powerful that they can in fact capture the notion of computation by algorithms as we intuitively know it .",
    "turing went further to introduce his universal machines , which are not restricted to do just a single computational task but can be  reprogrammed \" to do many different ones .",
    "the key conceptual leap that enables turing universal machines is the recognition that the descriptions of turing machines , given by the transition functions , are not at all different to and can be encoded in the same way as the machines very own inputs .",
    "the input to a turing machine and the description of the turing machine itself can be put together to form a new , single input to yet another machine , a turing universal machine .",
    "this latter machine only needs to emulate the encoded machine , which can be any well - formed turing machine , and thus acquires the status of being universal .",
    "universal machines are not unique and one can be encoded into the form of an input for another as well .",
    "the ability for a machine to act on its own kind enables us to investigate the capability and limitations of turing machines using no other instruments other than the machines themselves .",
    "it is precisely this self - referential property that gdel exploited to embed statements _ about _ arithmetics in statements _ of _ arithmetics in his famous incompleteness theorem  @xcite .",
    "the embedding in the theorem is the same as the encoding of turing machines into input forms acceptable for universal machines and is achieved by converting the finite description of a turing machine into a unique non - negative integer which can then be expressed in binary or decimal or any other convenient notation .",
    "the conversion is possible as we are only dealing here with machines having a finite number of states , a finite number of symbols in its alphabet , and only a finite number of movements for their heads .",
    "multi - tape turing machines have been introduced and can simplify certain computation ; so can non - deterministic turing machines whose next computation step at a given instant can be chosen , with certain probabilities , among a finite number of possibilities .",
    "nevertheless , these generalisations can not compute what a traditional turing machine can not do : all of the turing machines have the same power in terms of computability  @xcite .    viewed from this perspective , ( universal )",
    "turing machines are just functions from non - negative integers ( encoding the input ) to non - negative integers ( encoding the output ) .",
    "but simple arguments can show that the class of functions realised by turing machines can not be the same as the whole class of functions from the set of natural numbers to the same set .",
    "on the one hand , the number of turing machines is only countably infinite because each machine can be mapped into a unique integer . on the other hand , the whole class of functions from natural numbers to natural numbers",
    "can be shown by the cantor diagonal arguments  @xcite to be uncountably infinite ( in fact , this class of functions has the same cardinality as the set of reals ) . a pictorial and heuristic way to visualise",
    "this fact is where each mapping from natural numbers to themselves is represented by a real - valued angle between the two semi - infinite half - lines , one of which contains the domain of the function , the other the range .",
    "there are as  many \" functions as there are angles between the two lines .",
    "the set of functions that are captured by and identified with turing machines has been identified as that of so - called partial recursive functions and is briefly reviewed in the next section . from here on , we also call turing machines interchangeably with programs and partial recursive functions .",
    "we begin with the set of _ basic primitive recursive functions _ , where all the variables are in the set of non - negative integer @xmath3 ,    1 .",
    "the successor function : @xmath4 ; 2 .",
    "the zero function : @xmath5 ; 3 .",
    "the projections functions : @xmath6 @xmath7 .",
    "these are simple and intuitive functions .    from this basic set , other _ primitive recursive functions _ can be built using a finite number of the following operations    1 .",
    "composition : @xmath8 ; where @xmath9 is an @xmath10- variable function and the @xmath10 functions @xmath11 are @xmath12-variable .",
    "primitive recursion : let @xmath13 and @xmath9 be functions with @xmath10 and @xmath14 variables , respectively .",
    "the @xmath15-variable function @xmath16 can then be defined as @xmath17    it is easy to see that the primitive recursive functions so constructed are _ total _ in the sense that they are defined for _ all _ the non - negative integers .",
    "the set of primitive recursive functions is quite large but still inadequate and not large enough to encompass all the functions that are admissible and computable by the turing machines . for this",
    ", we have to introduce yet another necessary operation , in addition to the two above , the unbounded @xmath18-minimisation which is defined as : @xmath19;\\label{mu}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath20 is a total function for all the non - negative integral values of the variables . the general , mechanical method to find @xmath21 that is applicable to all total functions @xmath22 is to step @xmath21 through 0 , 1 , 2 , @xmath23 until @xmath24 is satisfied , if this can indeed be satisfied .",
    "( for a particular function @xmath22 one might be able to find @xmath21 in a different and quicker way , but the mechanical method is applicable in general without any privy knowledge about characteristics of @xmath22 , as long as it is total . )    all these operations acting , in a finite number of steps , on the basic functions define the set of _ partial recursive functions _ which contains the set of primitive recursive functions as a proper subset . the name _ partial recursive _ signifies the fact that there is no guarantee that a ( least ) @xmath21 can always be found to satisfy the condition @xmath25 for given @xmath26 in the ( unbounded ) @xmath18-minimisation .",
    "if such a @xmath21 can not be found , @xmath16 in  ( [ mu ] ) is undefined at that point . the problem to establish whether @xmath16 is defined or not at a general point @xmath27 in its arguments , i.e. whether such a @xmath21 can be found , is a decision problem which could have a binary answer , yes or no .",
    "however , this particular problem is a mathematically undecidable problem , in the sense that there exists no general algorithm that can always yield the required answer for any partial recursive function .",
    "we define the set of _ @xmath18-recursive functions _ being the subset of partial recursive functions where there always exists a decision procedure for the @xmath18-minimisation operation , if needed , that is , there always exists a value for @xmath21 .",
    "this set is bigger than the set of primitive recursive functions . and",
    "it can be proved that a function is @xmath18-recursive if and only if there exists a turing machine which can compute it and then halts , i.e. , if and only if it is turing computable .",
    "the church - turing thesis stipulates that all the functions that are _ effectively computable _ are in fact turing computable , and vice versa , thus restricting the intuitive and informal notion of computability to the well - defined mechanical operations of turing machines .",
    "this identification is a thesis and not a theorem , not even a conjecture , because it can never be proven right in the mathematical sense .",
    "nevertheless , it can be shown to be wrong if a counter - example can be found in which the computation steps are clearly and acceptably identified .",
    "since it is testable , the thesis does not have the status of an axiom in mathematics either .",
    "we dispute this thesis by showing in a later section that there exist computable functions , computable by executing well - defined quantum mechanical procedures in a finite manner , that are not turing computable .",
    "the evaluation of partial recursive functions , even though well defined ( through the three operations of composition , primitive recursion and @xmath18-minimisation upon basic functions and their resultants ) , may require an infinite number of steps  in contrast to the @xmath18-recursive functions whose evaluation requires only a finite number of steps .",
    "that is , partial recursive functions can be implemented on a turing machine with well - defined execution steps but the machine could never halt in some cases .",
    "one example of non - halting is the simplest program to find a number that is not the sum of four square numbers  @xcite .",
    "all that the program can do is to step through the natural numbers one - by - one and test each of these numbers by direct substitution of square numbers in increasing order of magnitudes .",
    "when a number can be found which is not the sum of four squares , the program prints out that number and halts .",
    "but this is a false hope . constructed in this way , such a program never halts because there exists lagrange s theorem which confirms that all numbers can in fact be expressed as the sum of four squares !",
    "another example can be seen through the famous but unproven goldbach s conjecture that every even number greater than 2 can be written as a sum of two primes .",
    "the simplest program would be one which steps through the even numbers one by one , and for each of these even numbers tests for all prime numbers ( less than the even numbers ) . if an even number is found which is not a sum of two primes , the program prints out that number and halts .",
    "in other words , the program halts if and only if the goldbach s conjecture is false .",
    "so far , no counter - example to goldbach s conjecture has been found this way .",
    "however , we can not rely on such a program simply because it may never halt .",
    "there are many other important conjectures and problems in mathematics which can be resolved if we somehow have a way to tell whether simple turing machines / programs , directly constructed similar to those above , will halt or not .",
    "thus is the all - important turing halting problem : given a turing machine , the question is whether there is a general algorithm which is able to determine if the machine would halt with a specified input .",
    "as is well - known in the framework of classical computability , this halting problem is as undecidable as the question whether a partial recursive function is defined at a given argument .",
    "the halting problem for turing machines is a manifestation of undecidability : a turing computation is equivalent to the evaluation of a partial recursive function , which is only defined for a subset of the integers . as this domain is classically undecidable , one can not always tell in advance whether the turing machine will halt ( that is , whether the input is in the domain of the partial recursive function ) or not ( when the input is not in the domain ) .    a version of the proof of the unsolvability of the halting problem based on the cantor diagonal argument goes as follows .",
    "the proof is by contradiction with the assumption of the existence of a computable halting function @xmath28 which has two integer arguments - @xmath22 is the gdel encoded integer number for the algorithm and @xmath29 is its ( encoded ) integer input : @xmath30 one can then construct a program @xmath31 having one integer argument @xmath10 in such a way that it calls the function @xmath32 as a subroutine and @xmath33 the application of the halting function @xmath9 on the program @xmath34 and input @xmath10 results in @xmath35 a contradiction is clearly manifest once we put @xmath36 in the last equation above .",
    "the construction of such a program @xmath34 is transparently possible , unless the existence of a computable @xmath9 is wrongly assumed .",
    "thus the contradiction discounts the assumption that there is a classically algorithmic way to determine whether any arbitrarily given program with arbitrary input will halt or not .",
    "however , this contradiction argument might be avoided if we distinguish and separate the two classes of quantum and classical algorithms .",
    "a _ quantum _",
    "function @xmath37 , similar to eq .",
    "( [ h ] ) , can conceivably exist to determine whether any classical program @xmath22 will halt on any classical input @xmath29 or not .",
    "the contradiction in eq .",
    "( [ contradiction ] ) would be avoided if the quantum halting @xmath38 can not take as an argument the modified program @xmath34 , which is now of _ quantum _ character because it now has quantum @xmath38 as a subroutine",
    ". this will be the case if @xmath38 can only accept integers while quantum algorithms , with proper definitions , can not in general be themselves encoded as integers .",
    "in fact , the no - cloning theorem  @xcite of quantum mechanics does restrict the type of operations available to quantum algorithms .",
    "in essence , the way we will break the self - referential reasoning here by the differentiation between quantum and classical algorithms is similar to the way bertrand russell resolved the set theory paradox ( to do with ",
    "the set of all sets which are not members of themselves \" ) by the introduction of classes as distinct from sets .",
    "( for other lines of arguments , see  @xcite for example . )    to investigate the decidability of the turing halting problem in the framework of quantum computability , we will need to isolate the point which causes the classical undecidability . with this aim we turn to the diophantine equations in the next section .",
    "identities between polynomials with integer coefficients in several unknowns over the natural numbers have been studied for some time in mathematics under the name of diophantine equations . at the turn of the last century",
    ", david hilbert listed , as challenges for the new century , 23 important problems among which the problem number ten is the only decision problem and could be rephrased as :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ given any polynomial equation with any number of unknowns and with integer coefficients ( that is , any diophantine equation ) : to devise a universal process according to which it can be determined by a finite number of operations whether the equation has integer solutions .",
    "_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _    there are many important and interesting mathematical conjectures which can be proved or disproved depending on whether some corresponding diophantine equations have an integer solution or not .",
    "these are , for instances , goldbach s conjecture which we already mentioned , the riemann hypothesis about the positions in the complex plane of the zeroes of the zeta function , the four - colour conjecture for planar maps , fermat s last theorem , etc ... thus , we can appreciate the importance of having a general method for all diophantine equations , instead of considering each of them individually on its own merits .    however , there are only few special cases of diophantine equations that are solvable .",
    "these include linear ( first - degree ) equations in the unknowns , of which the existence and absence of solutions can be inferred from the euclid s algorithm .",
    "also solvable are second - degree equations with only two unknowns , that is , in quadratic forms . but hilbert asked for a _ single _ general and finite decision procedure that is applicable for any diophantine equations .",
    "little was it known that this problem is ultimately connected to the seemingly unrelated notions of computation and turing machines which were to be introduced some 40 years later .",
    "see  @xcite for a general introduction to diophantine equations and hilbert tenth problem .",
    "eventually , the hilbert s tenth problem was finally shown to be undecidable in 1970 through a crucial step by matiyasevich  @xcite : the hilbert s tenth problem could be solved if and only if the turing halting problem could also be solved .",
    "the two are simply equivalent .",
    "consequently , as we have a proof in the last section that the turing s is not solvable , the hilbert s tenth problem is noncomputable / undecidable in the most general sense if one accepts , as almost everyone does , the church - turing thesis of computability .",
    "one would thus have to be content with the fact that individual diophantine equations need to be considered separately , and may or may not be solved with a different approach anew each time .    for a precise discussion and the history of the negative result , see  @xcite ; for a semi - popular account , see  @xcite .",
    "we briefly sketch below some key arguments leading to the undecidable result .",
    "it is recognised that turing machines as devices mapping inputs to outputs are equivalent to partial recursive functions , whose domain are restricted to proper subsets of @xmath3 . without loss of generality , we can always restrict the computation of turing machines to that of numeric partial recursive functions  because for non - numeric algorithms there always exist mappings into the computation of some corresponding partial recursive functions .",
    "the question whether a turing machine would halt or not upon some particular input is now equivalent to the question whether the corresponding argument value is in the domain of the corresponding function or not . when a machine can not halt with a given input is when the partial recursive function corresponding to that machine is not defined at that particular argument .",
    "now , there is a universal representation , known as the kleene normal form , for any partial recursive function @xmath16 @xmath39 ) , \\label{kleene}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath40 and @xmath41 are _ fixed _ primitive recursive functions , independent of the particular function @xmath16 on the left hand side .",
    "the information about @xmath16 on the right hand side of  ( [ kleene ] ) is encoded in the first argument of the function @xmath41 as the gdel number @xmath13 of @xmath16 .",
    "( we recall that the class of partial recursive functions is countably infinite and each function can be systematically given a unique identification number according to some gdel numbering scheme . )",
    "it is the @xmath18-minimisation operation in  ( [ kleene ] ) that could potentially turn a total primitive recursive function , which is defined everywhere , into a partial recursive function .",
    "thus , given @xmath42 if there exists a ( least ) @xmath21 that for some integer @xmath13 solves @xmath43 then the turing machine , which corresponds to @xmath13 , would halt upon the input corresponding to @xmath42 . if no such @xmath21 exists , the turing machine in question would not halt .",
    "gdel , as quoted in  @xcite , has shown that the @xmath18-minimising operation  ( [ mu ] ) can always be represented as some arithmetic statement with a set of identities between multi - variate polynomials over the integers , together with a finite number of the existential quantifiers , @xmath44 , and bounded versions of the universal quantifiers , @xmath45 .",
    "( the boundedness comes from the requirement of some _ least _ number that satisfies a @xmath18-minimisation as defined in  ( [ mu ] ) . )",
    "note that quantifiers hold a crucial role in arithmetic . restricted arithmetics with only the addition operation or the multiplication operation , but not both ,",
    "are in fact complete : any of their statements can be decided to be provable or not within the relevant frameworks . on the other hand , we have the famous gdel s incompleteness theorem for ` ordinary ' arithmetic which has both addition and multiplication operations .",
    "normally we would think that multiplication is just a compact way to express long and repeated additions , and might thus be puzzled over the difference in completeness .",
    "but it is the quantifiers that make such a huge difference .",
    "arithmetic statements for solutions of diophantine equations ( i.e. the hilbert s tenth problem ) can only involve existential quantifiers , but the elimination of bounded universal quantifiers in the @xmath18-minimisation necessitates the appearance of exponentiation of variables .",
    "a famous example of variable exponentiation is the equation of fermat s last theorem : @xmath46 which has no non - negative integer solutions for the unknowns @xmath47 , @xmath21 , @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "after various attempts by many people , it was finally shown that exponentiation is indeed diophantine  that is , variable exponents can be eliminated to result in only polynomial diophantine equations .",
    "this proves the equivalence between the two decision problems and implies that the hilbert s tenth is not computable in the turing scheme of computation .",
    "there are many other noncomputable problems , some are also equivalent to the turing halting problem , and others belong to altogether different non - computability classes .",
    "similarly based on the turing machines , many other problems can be shown to be equivalent to the turing halting problem , and thus noncomputable .",
    "we can name in this class  @xcite the tiling problem in a plane , post s correspondence problem , thue s word problem , wang s domino problem , etc ... for example , the tiling problem asks for a decision procedure to see if any given finite number of sets of tiles ( but each set has an infinite number of the same tiles available ) can tile the first quadrant of the plane or not , with a specified tile at the origin at the lower left corner and some adjacency rules for the tiling .",
    "one could also ask questions related to and generalising the hilbert s tenth problem such as  @xcite : is there a single algorithm for testing whether the number of solutions for any diophantine equation is finite , or is infinite , or equal to one , or is even ?    besides the above equivalent to the turing halting problem , there are yet others which belong to different classes in the non - computability hierarchy .",
    "the most famous of all must be the gdel s incompleteness theorem .",
    "it establishes that any finitely axiomatic , consistent mathematical system sufficiently complex to embrace arithmetic must be incomplete  that is , there exist some statements whose truth can not be confirmed or denied from within the system , resulting in undecidability .",
    "( interestingly , it is precisely the statement about consistency of the system that is neither provable nor deniable . )",
    "we can see that this undecidability is more than that of turing machines , whose applicable mathematical statements can only have bounded universal quantifiers as opposed to arbitrarily unbounded universal quantifiers of arithmetic at large .",
    "chaitin , approaching from the perspectives of algorithmic information theory  @xcite , has shown that there exist many unprovable statements in arithmetic simply because they have irreducible algorithmic contents , measurable in bits , that are more than the complexity , also measurable in bits , of the finite set of axioms and inference rules of the system .",
    "infinitely irreducible algorithmic complexity is randomness which exists even in pure mathematics . and",
    "more frustratingly , we can never prove randomness since we could only ever deal with finite axiomatic complexity .",
    "chaitin , to illustrate the point , has introduced the number @xmath0 as the halting probability for a random program , with some random input , being emulated by a particular turing machine .",
    "@xmath0 is an average measure over all programs run on the universal turing machine .",
    "this number has many interesting properties , and has been generalised to a quantum version  @xcite , but we only mention here the linkage between this number and polynomial diophantine equations . when expressed in binary ,",
    "the value of the @xmath12-th bit of @xmath0 is respectively 0 or 1 depending on whether some diophantine equation , corresponding to the turing machine in consideration , @xmath50 for a given @xmath51 , has solutions in non - negative integers @xmath52 for finitely or infinitely many values of the parameter @xmath53 .",
    "from this diophantine representation we can see that the noncomputability of @xmath0 is  more \" than the noncomputability of the turing halting problem .",
    "even if , somehow , we have an algorithm for the latter to decide the equations in  ( [ omeg ] ) for each @xmath54 respectively , we would still need to apply the algorithm for an infinite number of times just to get a single digit for @xmath0 !",
    "an infinite number of times can not be normally performed in a finite time , hence the different class of noncomputability from that of the turing halting problem .",
    "we will come back to the @xmath0 number with a hypothetical algorithm in quantum field theory later .",
    "we end our brief review of relevant mathematical concepts here with a discussion of computable numbers .",
    "if we had restricted such numbers to only those that can be output by some turing machine ( which then halts ) , then we would have had to effectively restrict ourselves to integers and to treat irrational numbers , like @xmath55 and @xmath56 , as noncomputable .",
    "this is clearly undesirable .",
    "a better and more practical definition of computable numbers are those which we can approximate to an arbitrary degree of accuracy with ( integer / rational ) outputs of some turing machines .",
    "this definition of computability of a number when it can be evaluated to any degree of accuracy is sufficient to interpret the number and to establish its relationship with other numbers . and that all we need in computing any number : its place in relation to other numbers",
    ".    note that , in this sense , the chaitin s @xmath0 is not computable because we can not estimate this number to an arbitrarily high accuracy , although it is bounded from above by unity ( being the maximum probability ) and can be approximated only from below by some very slowly converging process  @xcite whose convergence rate is indeterminable .",
    "quantum physics , including quantum mechanics and quantum field theory , is the most successful theory that we have in science for the description and prediction of phenomena in nature .",
    "and so far there is not a single discrepancy between the theory and experiments .    according to quantum mechanics , pure states of a physical system",
    "can capture the most that can be said about the system and are associated with vectors , unique up to phases , in some abstract linear vector hilbert space .",
    "when the system , particularly when it is a subsystem of a bigger entity , can not be described by a pure state but is in a mixed state , the language of density matrices would be necessary for its description . acting on the hilbert space are linear operators , of which hermitean and unitary operators are of particular interest .    in the schrdinger picture where the time dependency is explicitly carried by the states ,",
    "the time evolution of the system is governed by the schrdinger equation , in which the hermitean hamiltonian operators play a unique role . in general , each physical observable is associated with a hermitean operator ; the hamiltonian operator , for instance , is associated with the system s energy .",
    "the real - valued eigenvalues ( which can be continuous or discrete ) of these hermitean operators restrict the obtainable values under observation .",
    "each time when the associated observable is measured , only one single value , among the eigenvalues given , is obtained .",
    "repetitions of the measurement under identical conditions could yield different measured values each time . and",
    "the probability of getting a particular eigenvalue in a measurement is given by the square of the absolute value of the inner product between the corresponding eigenvector and the state describing the system at that instant .",
    "if the system is in a mixed state described by a density matrix , the probability is then given by the trace of the product between the density matrix and the corresponding projector associated with the eigenvector in question .",
    "after a measurement , the state of the system is a pure state whose representing vector is the same as the eigenvector , up to a phase , corresponding to the eigenvalue obtained .",
    "note that measurement thus is a non - unitary and irreversible operation in general , unless the system is already in the observable eigenstate .",
    "different observables can be measured simultaneously , with the same degree of statistical accuracy , only when the associated hermitean operators commute with each other .",
    "but already seeded in the summary of quantum mechanical postulates above is a fundamental problem of inconsistency .",
    "the act of measurement , on the one hand , is a process unfolded itself in time . on the other hand , why should it not be governed by the unitary schrdinger time - evolution operator ?",
    "even when we extend the system to a larger system consisting of the considered system and the measuring apparatus , we still face the same quantum measurement problem , under a slightly different guise . in setting up a measurement",
    "we effectively establish some correlation between the state of the measured system and the pointers of the measuring apparatus .",
    "this correlation is one - to - one for the eigenstates of the operator representing the measured observable : if the system is in the state @xmath57 , @xmath58 , then the pointer , initially in a neutral state @xmath59 , is subsequently in the state @xmath60 respectively , @xmath61 the problem is that we have never been able to observe the classical pointer in an entangled state as in the right hand side of the last expression . instead , we either get the pointer position @xmath62 with a probability proportional to @xmath63 or @xmath64 with a probability proportional to @xmath65 .    to resolve this problem one could postulate , as in the copenhagen interpretation , _ some _ undefined separation between the quantum and the classical worlds , or modify the theory to have elements of non - linearity admitted .",
    "( this second situation is unlike mathematics in the way that the postulates / axioms of a physical theory can themselves also be subjects of investigation . )",
    "but if we believe in quantum mechanics as the universal and fundamental theory then we have a difficult problem at hand .",
    "various resolution attempts ranging from the many - world interpretation to decoherence have not been deemed successful .",
    "we shall leave the measurement problem here , and only wish to emphasise that the power of all quantum algorithms in quantum computation relies crucially on such mysterious measurement processes .    also for later use",
    ", we now introduce the concept of _ measurable _ quantities  @xcite .",

    "the technician is analogous to the computer , the instructions analogous to the computer program , the  abundance of unprepared raw materials \" analogous to the infinite turing tape , initially blank .",
    "in particular , not only the ( stochastic ) outcomes of an observable are obviously measurable and of interest but so are the probability distributions for these outcomes . the probabilities can be obtained within any given accuracy by increasing the number of measurement repetitions .",
    "later , we make full use of this crucial fact that _ the quantum mechanical probabilities are and measurable in principle . _      one important , but",

    "even if we prepare the initial quantum states to be _ exactly _ the same in principle , we can still have different and random outcomes in subsequent measurements .",
    "such randomness is a fact of life in the quantum reality of our universe .    to reflect that intrinsic and inevitable randomness , the best that quantum mechanics , as a physical theory of nature , can do is to list , given the initial conditions , the possible values for measured quantities and the probability distributions for those values .",

    "that is how the computable numbers from quantum mechanics can be judged against the measurable numbers obtained from physical experiments .",

    "this dependency is particularly simplified when the rate of change of the external fields is very fast compared to some intrinsic time scale , whence we can apply the sudden approximation , or is very slow , whence we can appeal to the quantum adiabatic theorem .",

    "also implied in the discusions above is the fact that quantum mechanics _ is _ , as a theory , non - computable .",
    "this fact is not so widely recognised .    to understand quantum computability and its limits ,",
    "we have also considered , with mixed results , some problems generalised from the hilbert s tenth and the evaluation of chaitin s @xmath0 number .",
    "nevertheless , our study is an illustration of  information is physical \" .    inspired by quantum mechanics",
    ", we have also reformulated the question of solution existence of a diophantine equation into the question of certain properties contained in an infinitely coupled set of differential equations . in words ,",
    "we encode the answer of the former question into the smallest eigenvalue and corresponding eigenvector of a hermitean operator bounded from below . and to find these eigen - properties we next deform the operator continuously to another operator whose spectrum is known .",
    "once the deformation is also expressible in the form of a set of coupled differential equations , we could now start from the constructive knowns as a handle to study the desired unknowns .",
    "note that the reformulation is entirely based on mathematics .",
    "if a general mathematical method could be found to extract the required information from the differential equations for any given diophantine equation then one would have the solution to the hilbert s tenth problem itself .",
    "this may be unlikely but not be as contradictory as it seems because the unsolvability of the hilbert s tenth problem is only established in the framework of integer arithmetic and in turing computability , not necessarily in mathematics in general .",
    "tarski  @xcite has shown that the question about the existence of _ real _ solutions of polynomials over the reals is , in fact , _",
    "decidable_.    it seems appropriate to end here with a quotation from the man whose famous incompleteness result has often been misquoted as spelling the end for computability / provability in arithmetic . in gdel",
