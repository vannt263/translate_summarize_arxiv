    "a multi - input multi - output ( mimo ) channel , providing channel information at the transmitter can increase the achievable rate and simplify the coder and decoder .",
    "namely , this channel information can specify a precoding matrix , which aligns the transmitted signal along the strongest channel modes ( i.e. , singular vectors corresponding to the largest singular values ) . in practice",
    ", the precoding matrix must be quantized at the receiver , and relayed to the transmitter via a feedback channel .",
    "the corresponding achievable rate is therefore limited by the accuracy of the quantizer .",
    "the design and performance of quantized precoding matrices for multi - input single - output ( miso ) and mimo channels has been considered in numerous references , including @xcite . in those references , and in this paper",
    ", the channel is assumed to be stationary , known at the receiver , and the performance is evaluated as a function of the number of quantization bits @xmath0 .",
    "( this is in contrast with other work , which models estimation error at the receiver , but does not explicitly account for quantization error ( e.g. , @xcite ) , and which assumes a time - varying channel with feedback of second - order statistics @xcite . ) optimization of vector quantization codebooks is discussed in @xcite for beamforming , and in @xcite for mimo channels with precoding matrices that provide multiplexing gain ( i.e. , have rank larger than one ) .",
    "it is shown in @xcite that this optimization can be interpreted as maximizing the minimum distance between points in a grassmannian space .",
    "( see also @xcite . )",
    "the performance of this class of grassmannian codebooks is also studied in @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we evaluate the performance of a _ random vector quantization ( rvq ) _ scheme for the precoding matrix .",
    "namely , given @xmath0 feedback bits , the precoding matrix is selected from a random codebook containing @xmath1 matrices , which are independent and isotropically distributed .",
    "rvq has been analyzed in other source coding contexts ( e.g. , see @xcite and the related discussion in @xcite ) , and achieves the rate - distortion bound for ergodic gaussian sources .",
    "this work is motivated by prior work @xcite in which rvq is considered for signature quantization in code - division multiple access ( cdma ) . in that scenario ,",
    "limited feedback is used to select a signature for a particular user , which maximizes the received signal - to - interference - plus - noise - ratio ( sinr ) .",
    "rvq has the attractive properties of being tractable and asymptotically optimal .",
    "namely , in @xcite the received sinr with rvq is evaluated in the asymptotic ( large system ) limit as processing gain , number of users , and feedback bits all tend to infinity with fixed ratios .",
    "furthermore , it is shown that no other quantization scheme can achieve a larger asymptotic sinr .    here",
    "we assume an _ i.i.d .",
    "_ block rayleigh fading channel model with independent channel gains , and take ergodic capacity as the performance criterion .",
    "the receiver relays @xmath0 bits to the transmitter ( per codeword ) via a reliable feedback channel ( i.e. , no feedback errors ) with no delay .",
    "we start by evaluating the capacity of miso and mimo channels with a quantized _ beamformer _ , i.e. , rank - one precoding matrix .",
    "our results are asymptotic as the number of transmit antennas @xmath2 and feedback bits @xmath0 both tend to infinity with fixed @xmath3 ( feedback bits per degree of freedom ) . for the mimo channel",
    "the number of receive antennas @xmath4 also tends to infinity in proportion with @xmath2 and @xmath0 .",
    "the asymptotic expressions accurately predict the performance of finite - size systems of interest as a function of normalized feedback and background signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) . in analogy with the optimality result shown in @xcite ,",
    "rvq is also asymptotically optimal in this scenario , i.e. , no other quantization scheme can achieve a larger asymptotic rate .",
    "furthermore , numerical examples for small @xmath2 show that rvq performance averaged over codebooks is essentially the same as that obtained from codebooks optimized via the lloyd - max algorithm @xcite .",
    "( see also the numerical examples in @xcite , which compare rvq performance with the optimized ( grassmannian ) codebooks in @xcite . )",
    "we then consider quantization of a precoding matrix with arbitrary rank .",
    "namely , a rank @xmath5 precoding matrix multiplexes @xmath5 independent streams of transmitted information symbols onto the @xmath2 transmit antennas . in that case",
    ", the capacity with limited feedback is approximated in the limit as @xmath0 , @xmath2 , @xmath4 , and @xmath5 all tend to infinity with fixed ratios @xmath6 , @xmath7 , and @xmath8 .",
    "that is , the number of feedback bits again scales linearly with the number of degrees of freedom , which is proportional to @xmath9 .",
    "although our results for beamforming suggest that rvq is also asymptotically optimal in this scenario , this remains an open question .",
    "the asymptotic results for a precoder matrix with arbitrary rank @xmath5 can be used to determine the normalized rank , or multiplexing gain @xmath6 , which maximizes the capacity .",
    "this optimized rank in general depends on the normalized feedback , the ratio of antennas @xmath10 , and the snr .",
    "for example , if @xmath11 and the snr is sufficiently large , then as the feedback increases from zero to infinity , the optimized rank decreases from one to @xmath7 .",
    "numerical results are presented , which illustrate the effect of normalized rank on achievable rate , and also show that the asymptotic results accurately predict simulated results for finite - size systems of interest .",
    "we also evaluate the performance of rvq with linear receivers ( i.e. , the matched filter and linear minimum mean squared error ( mmse ) receivers ) , and compare their performance with the optimal ( capacity - achieving ) receiver . with the optimal precoding matrix ,",
    "corresponding to infinite feedback , both linear receivers are optimal . with limited feedback",
    "the two linear receivers are simpler than the optimal receiver , but require more feedback to achieve a target rate .",
    "numerical results show that this additional feedback required by the linear mmse receiver is quite small , whereas the additional feedback required by the matched filter can be significant ( e.g. , about one bit per precoding matrix element ) .",
    "in addition to quantizing the optimal precoding matrix , power for each data stream can also be optimized , quantized , and fed back to the transmitter ( e.g. , see @xcite ) .",
    "asymptotically , the amount of feedback required to specify the power is negligible compared to the feedback required for the precoding matrix .",
    "furthermore , uniform power over the set of activated channel typically performs close to the optimal ( water - filling ) performance @xcite .",
    "we therefore only consider quantization of the precoding matrix",
    ".    other related work on rvq for mimo channels has been presented in @xcite .",
    "namely , exact expressions for the ergodic capacity with beamforming and rvq for a finite - size miso channel are derived in @xcite .",
