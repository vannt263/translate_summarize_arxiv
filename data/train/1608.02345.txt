    "the kunlun infrared sky survey ( kiss ) will be conducted from china s kunlun station at dome a , at the summit of the antarctic plateau .",
    "the survey will be undertaken in the k  dark passband at 2.4@xmath2 m , a unique low background window in the infrared .",
    "it will be conducted with the third of the ast3 telescopes ( antarctic survey telescope ) deployed at dome a @xcite .",
    "the first two telescopes were designed for optical surveys .",
    "the third @xcite will conduct the first deep , wide - field survey in this band , as well as be pathfinder for a future large antarctic optical / ir telescope at the site ( kdust ) .",
    "this paper discusses the science objectives for the infrared surveys that will be conducted with kiss .",
    "sky surveys are an essential prerequisite to astrophysics . to understand the physics of the universe , you need to know what is there .",
    "that is why , for example , the uk schmidt telescope was built at australia s national siding spring observatory , ahead of the anglo australian telescope in the 1970s @xcite .",
    "kiss will be complementary to the anu s skymapper telescope @xcite in that it is infrared and complementary to nasa s 2mass survey in that it is time sensitive .",
    "the facility uniquely provides complete southern hemisphere sky coverage in the infrared with surveys with cadences that may range from hourly to monthly .",
    "the ast3nir project is a precursor for a kdust ir camera @xcite .",
    "just as kiss complements skymapper , kdust will complement the optical large synoptic survey telescope ( lsst ) , the top ranked ground based facility in the u.s . astro2010 decadal plan .",
    "kiss also allows chinese astronomers to acquire first hand near ",
    "ir data of the southern sky , as well as produce a range of astronomical sources which will stimulate further collaboration between chinese and australian scientists .",
    "kiss exploits three particular advantages that the antarctic plateau has for astronomical observations over other ground - based locations :    * the low sky background at 2.4@xmath2 m , two orders of magnitude lower than at the best temperate sites @xcite . * the high photometric precision achievable due to low scintillation and the exceptional seeing above narrow surface boundary layer @xcite . * the high time cadence that can be achieved through the 4-month darkness of a winter night @xcite .",
    "2.4@xmath2 m is the longest wavelength that truly deep imaging can be undertaken from the earth .",
    "it marks the outer limit for optical astronomy , beyond which thermal background fluxes dominate observations .    in this paper",
    "we describe the kiss instrument in  [ sec : instrument ] , calculate its sensitivity in ",
    "[ sec : sensitivity ] and describe its operation and automated data reduction pipeline in  [ sec : operations ] .",
    "we then discuss the survey capabilities in  [ sec : survey ] , before outlining a range of science programs in  [ sec : science ] that will be undertaken .",
    "these include exoplanet and brown dwarf searches , studies of the accretion process during star formation , of the terminal phases of stellar evolution and investigations of fast transients across multi - wavelengths .",
    "we also discuss searches for buried sn , reverberation mapping of agn nuclei and the measurement of the cosmic infrared background .",
    "the antarctic survey telescope ",
    "ast3 was originally designed to have three optical telescopes matched respectively with g , r and i band filters , and used principally in searches for supernovae and exosolar planets undertaken from dome a. each of the three ast3 telescopes is a modified schmidt type optical telescope with an entrance pupil diameter of 500 mm , an @xmath3-ratio of 3.7 and a field of view of @xmath4 .",
    "they consist of a transparent aspherical plate as the entrance pupil , an aspherical primary mirror with a diameter of 680 mm , and a spherical refractive corrector with a filter before the focal plane @xcite .",
    "the first two telescopes were installed at dome a in january 2012 and 2015 , respectively @xcite .    due to the great advantages of dome a for near ",
    "ir observations , the third ast3 telescope ( ast3nir @xmath5 kiss ) has been re - optimized for diffraction limited imaging in the k band @xcite , based on the same entrance pupil and primary mirror as that of the first two ast3 telescopes , since they have already been manufactured at the niaot .",
    "this results in a primary mirror which is oversized for the entrance pupil for the camera .",
    "there will be a single filter centred at @xmath6 m with bandwidth @xmath7 m ; i.e.  @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "the kiss camera is located outside the main optical tube by adding in a fold mirror .",
    "the telescope is being built at the niaot and the infrared camera at the aao .",
    "the telescope and camera specifications are listed in table  [ tab : specs ] .",
    "the optical design is described in more detail in a separate paper @xcite .    [ cols=\"<,^,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     cadence is the time between return visits to each field .",
    "camera fields is the number of fields that would be surveyed in one winter season , with the corresponding areal coverage listed given the camera fov .",
    "the range in @xmath8 sensitivity reflects the extrema in observing conditions at dome a , as discussed in  [ sec : sensitivity ] .",
    "each survey is assumed to use 10% of the available observing time over the antarctic winter .",
    "an integration time of @xmath9s per frame is taken .",
    "sensitivities if @xmath10s were taken instead would be reduced by 0.41.0 mags . [",
    "tab : surveys ]    in this section we take the sensitivities presented in  [ sec : sensitivity ] and discuss possible surveys that could be undertaken , in particular for exploring time variable phenomena .",
    "there are approximately 4 months of darkness each winter at dome a , and this suggests a range of cadences for such programs , ranging from hours to monthly . naturally , the more frequently a field is re - observed , the greater the number of samples that will be obtained , but the smaller the total area of sky that can be surveyed .",
    "in addition , if high sensitivity is required then the survey area will be further limited .",
    "we consider here surveys for cadences ranging from 1 hour to 1 month , and with integration times of 1 minute , 9 minutes ( i.e.  @xmath11 frames ) and 1 hour , as summarised in table  [ tab : surveys ] .",
    "we have also assumed that each survey will be conducted for approximately 10% of the available observing time over the winter . in combination with the camera field of view ( taken as @xmath12 ) and the integration time per field , this then determines the total areal coverage of a survey .",
    "the integration time also determines the sensitivity .",
    "for example , if a daily cadence is required a survey could cover 85 sq .",
    "deg .  to a point source sensitivity limit of 17.9 mags with a 1 minute exposure .",
    "however , only 1.4 sq .  deg .  could be covered if 1 hour exposures were used in order to reach down to 20.2 mags . in both these cases @xmath13 samples",
    "would be expected over the course of a season .",
    "furthermore , if the intention is to increase dynamic range across the field , or to include the brightest possible sources in a survey , then an integration time per frame of @xmath10s can be used , instead of @xmath9s .",
    "this raises the brightest source measurable from 10.7 to 7.0 magnitudes , but results in a decrease in the detection limit of 1 mag .",
    "the science mission of kiss is the widest field survey of the time varying universe in the infrared .",
    "the vista variables in the via lactea @xcite survey has mapped a @xmath14 area containing @xmath15 point sources with multi - epoch near - infrared photometry .",
    "their surveyed area includes the milky way bulge and an adjacent section of the mid plane .",
    "kiss will venture outside the galactic plane and bulge with a wide range of scientific objectives described below .",
    "the motivation for studying star formation in the ir from antarctica with kiss stems from three principal facets that improve the effectiveness of an observational program :    * the unique environmental conditions on the summit of the antarctic plateau greatly improves capability .",
    "the extreme cold results in low sky backgrounds in the @xmath16 window , @xmath13 times better than from good temperate sites . coupled with the long winter night and stable atmosphere ,",
    "this facilitates sensitive , high cadence observations with precision photometry . in turn , this allows comprehensive searches for variability and transient phenomena to be undertaken over extensive areas of obscured regions .",
    "* a small telescope with a large - array has a wide field of view .",
    "young star clusters are typically spread over tens of arcminutes of the sky , so this allows for them to be efficiently studied . in particular , there are many clusters in the galactic plane that can be selected to well fit into a single pointing of the telescope .",
    "* extinction is one - tenth that of the optical at 2.4@xmath2 m , hence providing the ability to peer inside obscured molecular clouds where star formation takes place . at shorter wavelengths ,",
    "the interiors of star forming clouds remain hidden from view .",
    "@xmath1 is the longest wavelength for which high spatial resolution , high sensitivity observations can be undertaken from a ground - based site .",
    "kiss thus opens a new regime for the time exploration of stellar variability associated with star formation in the infrared .",
    "we now discuss some illustrative science programs that could be tackled with such a capability :      dynamical interactions and the decay of non - hierarchical multiple systems in the cores of star forming clusters might be found .",
    "such events may often be accompanied by stellar ejections , together with the formation of a tight binary , as suggested by the @xmath17% of o stars that are runaways and the higher binary fraction in massive than in low mass systems @xcite .",
    "the runaways are presumed to have been ejected from their birthplaces at high velocities . in omc1 a three - body encounter @xmath18 years ago has been hypothesised to have resulted in the formation of the `` bullets of orion '' as well as the high proper motions of the three stars concerned @xcite .",
    "proper motions studies of the bullets for over a decade clearly reveal their explosive origin @xcite .",
    "the hypothesis to be investigated is that ejection , plus the formation of a tight binary , may be common in multiple - systems . in this scenario",
    "massive stars form dense sub - clusters inside more sparsely populated clusters of lower - mass objects .",
    "they might form non - hierarchical systems , whereby dynamical interactions between the members leads to the ejection of one at high velocity , with the simultaneous formation of tight binaries between other members . while it would be fortuitous",
    "if such an ejection was to be caught in action , more likely would be the possibility of catching transits from the close passage of such stars in front of each another .",
    "these must often occur as the orbital periods are short and the stellar photospheres can be extended .",
    "such events will only be observable in the infrared , however , since dust extinction renders these stars invisible in the optical .",
    "wide - field time domain studies , therefore , can search for such transiting events and so yield statistics on the existence of embedded massive , multiple systems during star cluster formation .",
    "variability in the infrared fluxes from forming star clusters has been found to be surprisingly common .",
    "for instance , in the nearby rho ophiuchi cloud 40% of the embedded population exhibits such behaviour on timescales ranging from days to weeks @xcite .",
    "such variability is hypothesised to be associated with episodic accretion from a circumstellar disk , for instance outbursts ( flares ) might result from sudden accretion events . as an example , in cygnus ob7 variability was modelled as the accretion rate falling by 30 times , while the central hole in the disk doubled in size , over a 1 year period @xcite .",
    "there are two recognised classes of eruptive variables undergoing accretion : long duration outbursts over many years termed fuors ( after fu orionis ) , and shorter duration events ( weeks to months ) known as exors ( after ex lupi ) .",
    "these have been defined via their optical variability and only a few examples are known @xcite .",
    "searches for such events , in particular shorter period variability , has been hampered by a lack of capability in the ir for time - dependent surveys .",
    "two epochs in the near  ir were obtained during the ukidds galactic plane survey ( the ugps ) @xcite , but only finding an additional 4 examples arising from embedded sources .",
    "the first results focusing on ir variability from the much more extensive vista variables in the via lactea ( vvv ) survey @xcite have recently been reported @xcite , however .",
    "they open up a much larger discovery space .",
    "around 7 large amplitude variables ( @xmath19mag ) per square degree were found over a @xmath20 survey region , about half of which can be associated with embedded young stellar objects . after allowance for incompleteness , the actual source density for",
    "such variable may in fact be a factor of three higher .",
    "over 100 sources with variability characteristics of fuors and exors have been identified , an increase by @xmath21 times over the number previously known .",
    "this provides a rich source list for more detailed study using a higher and more consistent cadence .",
    "interestingly , the most eruptive light curves , on the longest timescales , tend to be associated with the spectrally reddest objects ; i.e.  associated with the earliest stages of pre - ms evolution .",
    "however , for shorter time intervals ( less than a month ) the greatest variability is associated with the more evolved class ii yso stage , rather than the class i stage found to be associated preferentially with longer period variables .",
    "monitoring of variability provides a tool to probe the accretion process itself , and the cycles of outburst that accompany it , so as to test between models for the process @xcite .",
    "these can depend sensitively on the stellar structure and geometry in the accreting region .",
    "these observations might be accompanied by alma imaging in the sub - millimetre of the disks around forming stars , in order to build a picture of the accretion process(es ) in action .      while fluctuations in the light curve may result from obscuration caused by other objects",
    ", it may also arise from variability of the young star itself .",
    "on timescales of a few years wolk et al . , for instance , conclude that most of the young stellar population will be found to be variable in the near - infrared @xcite .",
    "the causes of such variation are many , including those above ( accretion , obscuration , transits ) .",
    "however , it might also result from intrinsic variability  perhaps from star spots changing",
    "the level of the emitted stellar flux , essentially changes in the level of magnetic activity @xcite .",
    "the nature of the variability can be used to probe the kind of star spot .",
    "periodic variability is thought to originate from cool magnetic spots that rotate with the star , whereas aperiodic variability is likely to be associated with flaring , irregular accretion or variations in circumstellar extinction .",
    "young stars are intrinsically more variable than main sequence stars like the sun ; however infrared observations are needed to study their variability when they are still obscured by the dust within their natal clouds .    variability might also be used to determine cluster membership from the background stellar population , in particular when the infrared excess that would arise from a warm disk that surrounds the young star is not seen .",
    "variability can therefore be used to help build a complete population census of a star cluster , beyond that provided by just the measurement of infrared excesses from disks .      a suitable survey program for kiss would be to concentrate on observing star forming clusters along the southern galactic plane . based on the results of the vvv survey about half the ir variable sources",
    "will be found in such regions .",
    "these sources will not be evident in optical surveys , so this provides a new parameter space to study .",
    "young clusters will generally fit within the @xmath22 fov , so a 9-point jitter pattern would be used . thus in 9 minutes a @xmath8 sensitivity of @xmath23 mags .",
    "would be achieved for the dome a extrema . with daily cadence and a 10% observing fraction ,",
    "16 clusters could be studied . with a weekly cadence",
    ", this would increase to @xmath13 .",
    "a suitable program would encompass both these cadences , concentrating on daily monitoring of the most interesting embedded clusters found in the vvv , including those with sources found to be continuously variable .",
    "source confusion in the heart of the galactic plane will limit the sensitivity , so this monitoring would best be done in regions like carina and ngc  3603 which are less crowded , being at longitudes @xmath24 from the galactic centre .",
    "this would be accompanied by a weekly monitoring of a larger sample of young clusters spread along the southern galactic plane .",
    "based on the results of the vvv survey about 4 large amplitude ( @xmath25  mag ) variables would be found per field brighter than @xmath26  mag .",
    "incompleteness in the vvv might raise this number to @xmath27 . since kiss will extend 2 mags .",
    "fainter , in fact considerably more large amplitude variables can be expected to be found .",
    "furthermore , kiss will also extend to brighter stars , with the saturation limit being @xmath28  mag .",
    "brighter than the vvv .",
    "the @xmath1 window is where the spectrum of objects around 1,0001,500k peak  too cool for stars , but too hot for most planets .",
    "this is the regime of brown dwarfs and hot jupiters .",
    "the latter are jupiter - sized or larger planets .",
    "they are in close orbit around their host stars and so heated by them .",
    "while from comparison of their masses brown dwarfs look like the big brothers of giant planets , their origins may be very different .",
    "brown dwarfs are failed stars and are believed to be formed through the collapse of gaseous clouds , in the same manner as low mass stars . in contrast , the formation of giant planets more likely follows a core accretion model @xcite , in which the planet grows from a solid planetary core by accreting gas and dust from a surrounding circumstellar disk .",
    "a simple observational result seems to confirm their differences .",
    "giant planets are relatively more common than brown dwarfs . it is estimated that 12% of all stars may contain hot jupiters with orbital periods of less than 50 days @xcite .",
    "this rate increases to 14% for orbital periods of up to 10 years @xcite . the occurrence rate of brown dwarfs is lower than for both giant planets and low mass stars .",
    "a possible dip occurs in the stellar companion mass histogram at around 40 jupiter masses , known as the `` brown dwarf desert '' .",
    "however , brown dwarfs are not readily distinguishable from giant planets if we only consider their masses or radii .",
    "there are planets which are smaller or larger , and lighter or heavier , than objects believed to be brown dwarfs .",
    "the brown dwarf desert may in fact be an observational bias since they are much fainter than low mass stars and easily confused with giant planets .",
    "in fact , a debate about what is a planet began soon after the first brown dwarf was discovered and is still ongoing @xcite . to contribute to resolving it",
    ", surveys are needed that are able to determine the true occurrence rate of brown dwarfs , especially in binary systems .",
    "this will not only benefit planet formation theory but also address some key issues in star formation research , such as the initial mass function for stellar mass objects @xcite .",
    "stellar clusters are good targets for brown dwarf searches , since their occurrence rate may be strongly associated with the star formation rate .",
    "the youngest brown dwarfs and giant planets have dusty atmospheres @xcite , which makes them bright in the k@xmath29 filter .",
    "( 2.1@xmath2 m ) should be one of the most sensitive measurements of the dustiness of their atmospheres , with similar sensitivity to the methane filters in the h  band ( 1.6@xmath2 m ) .",
    "targetting multiple clusters is then one of the most efficient ways of detecting brown dwarfs and hot jupiters .",
    "when they transit in front of their host star a @xmath28% drop in flux of the host , over a period of a few hours , will be seen . to detect these tiny dips buried in the light curve , photometric measurements at the milli - magnitude accuracy level",
    "are required .",
    "such a precision has been demonstrated to be achievable from antarctica @xcite .",
    "observations of transiting brown dwarfs and hot jupiters in the k  band have additional scientific value .",
    "orbital inclination and physical radius can be determined more precisely , since stellar limb - darkening is significantly less pronounced at longer wavelengths .",
    "most interestingly , the k  band is also open to secondary eclipse observations . the spectrum of a hot jupiter at 2.4@xmath2 m will be much brighter than inferred from its black body temperature .",
    "so , when transiting a solar - type star , a secondary eclipse in the k  band of depth @xmath31% is anticipated @xcite . in addition , the secondary eclipse is even more pronounced for a transiting brown dwarf .",
    "such measurements would provide a key part of the spectrum , and can be used to model the effective temperatures , bond albedos and atmospheric physics .",
    "this would help us to distinguish brown dwarfs from giant planets and interpret their inner structure and formation processes .",
    "related work has been reported , e.g.  hd209458b @xcite and ogle - tr-113 @xcite , indicating the feasibility of this kind of observation . the sensitive @xmath1 window at dome a and the long polar night will make kiss one of the best ground - based facilities for performing secondary eclipse observations of brown dwarfs and hot jupiters .",
    "the fov of kiss is @xmath12 with a relatively small pixel scale @xmath32 .",
    "this is very suitable for searching for transiting brown dwarfs and hot jupiters in open clusters along the southern galactic plane .",
    "multiple stellar clusters would be pre - selected depending on their stellar densities and distances .",
    "a trade off between total number of target clusters and sampling cadence needs to be made .",
    "the optimal balance is determined by ensuring enough exposure time to achieve at least 1% photometric precision for each target and an overall cadence of less than 20 minutes .",
    "since the typical transit duration of a hot jupiter is around 23 hours , a longer cadence would drop the detectability significantly given a fixed total observation period .",
    "secondary eclipse observations would only be performed on very bright , high - value targets during their predicted transit windows .",
    "a target would be monitored for 46 hours to cover the whole transit event with a high sample cadence of 2 minutes . in a one minute observation 0.2% photometry ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : snvsmag ] ) can be achieved for sources brighter than @xmath33 magnitude at k  band ( for the extrema in conditions expected at dome a , as discussed in[sec : sensitivity ] ) .",
    "ten one - minute images would be coadded together to achieve higher precision @xmath34 .",
    "in addition to finding individual objects in order to study their characteristic features , understanding of the statistical properties of the exoplanet population is essential for building a uniform and self - consistent picture of planet formation and evolution . to date , most confirmed exoplanets have been found around solar - type stars ( g dwarfs ) .",
    "this could be an observational bias , however , since g dwarfs are bright , quiet and slowly rotating , hence they are suitable for radial velocity follow - up measurements .",
    "in fact , main - sequence stars with spectral types later than m0 ( @xmath35 ) outnumber g dwarfs by an order of magnitude in the solar neighbourhood @xcite .",
    "results from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) indicate that the galaxy s stellar mass function peaks at @xmath36 @xcite , which corresponds roughly to m4 in spectral type .",
    "40% of stars fall below @xmath37 .",
    "we thus need to know how planets populate these smallest of stars before we can obtain a complete understanding of the exoplanet population in the galaxy .",
    "furthermore , statistical studies on kepler candidates and their host stars , which suffer less observational bias , indicate that smaller stars tend to have a higher probability of hosting small planets .",
    "the occurrence of earth to neptune - sized planets ( @xmath38 ) is higher towards later spectral types at all orbital periods .",
    "planets around m dwarfs occur twice as frequently as around g stars , and three times as frequently as around f stars @xcite .",
    "the correlation between planet occurrence and host mass reveals details of planet formation .",
    "for example , according to the core accretion paradigm @xcite , jupiter mass planets should be rare around m dwarfs , since their less massive protostellar disks @xcite are insufficient to feed giant planets .",
    "this hypothesis was supported by a deficit of jupiters detected in radial velocity surveys @xcite .",
    "however , hot jupiters were then found around m dwarfs a few years later by the kepler satellite @xcite . to date , only @xmath13 exoplanets around m dwarfs have been found , mostly by kepler .",
    "we need more samples to complete the story of the stellar - mass - dependent occurrence rate of planets . by spanning a wide range of stellar masses",
    ", we may be able to draw an overall picture of how a planet s birth , growth and survival depends on its various environmental factors @xcite .",
    "compared to gas giant planets , smaller rocky planets with moderate surface temperatures are particularly attractive for study as these are potential habitable worlds .",
    "an earth - like planet usually has a physical radius no more than @xmath39 , which generates only a @xmath40% flux drop when it transits its solar - type host . a photometric precision of @xmath41% is required to reveal such planets in a transit survey .",
    "furthermore , the typical orbit period of a habitable planet travelling around its g dwarf host is about 1 year , which leads to a geometric transit probability close to zero . given a system that is exactly coplanar to the observer",
    ", one needs to maintain this ultra - high precision for several years to ensure the coverage of multiple transit events .",
    "this is impossible for ground - based surveys that suffer strong red noise from the atmosphere and sidereal aliasing .",
    "such issues are alleviated , but not removed , for observations from antarctica .",
    "instead , m dwarfs are preferred targets when searching for transiting earth and super - earth exoplanets in habitable zones @xcite .",
    "the very low luminosities of m dwarfs makes their habitable zones reside at much smaller orbital distances .",
    "for example , for an m5 dwarf the habitable zone lies at around 0.08  au , corresponding to an orbital period of 15 days .",
    "the geometric transit probability for a super - earth exoplanet ( @xmath42 ) inside its habitable zone is also raised from @xmath43% ( for the earth - sun system ) to @xmath44% .",
    "their small radii also significantly amplifies the transit depth from @xmath40% to @xmath43% @xcite .",
    "m dwarfs are also much brighter at k  band than they are in the optical . for targets of",
    "later than m5 or later spectral type and beyond the @xmath45 magnitude limit of tess @xcite , kiss has the potential to provide a unique survey for close in transiting terrestrial planets .",
    "a photometric precision better than 0.5% is necessary for detecting a super - earth ( @xmath46 ) transiting a late m dwarf ( @xmath47 ) .",
    "the feasibility of detecting habitable earth- and super - earth planets has recently been demonstrated by mearth ( * ? ? ?",
    "* gj1132b ) and trappist ( * ? ? ?",
    "* trappist-1b , c , d ) .",
    "m dwarfs are supposed to be more abundant than massive stars .",
    "however , the nearby late m dwarfs that are known are especially rare .",
    "these are the best targets for exo - earth searches and their distribution on the sky is rather sparse . for kiss ,",
    "whose fov is @xmath48 , we expect less than one target per fov . thus , a blind survey is not a suitable search mode . instead",
    ", a list of m dwarfs will be chosen from the conch  shell catalogue @xcite , selected with radii @xmath49 and metallicity [ fe / h ] @xmath50 .",
    "additional criteria are needed to ensure high photometric precision , e.g.  bright k  band magnitude @xmath51 and declination @xmath52 to be observable at high elevation .    in a one minute exposure",
    "the photometric precision is better 0.5% ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : snvsmag ] ) for stars with @xmath53 . for bright targets , multiple short exposures ( e.g.  @xmath10s ) would be used to minimise saturation , with minor effect on the precision obtained ( fig .",
    "[ fig : snvsmag ] ) .",
    "the typical transit duration of an earth ",
    "m - dwarf system is about 1 hour .",
    "this sets the maximum cadence to be 10 minutes .",
    "taking account of the slew time between targets ( 1030 seconds ) , 68 targets could be monitored simultaneously .",
    "the terminal phase for intermediate mass stars is the mira variable .",
    "heavy mass loss surrounds a @xmath54 star , producing optically thick dust which obscures the process from view .",
    "the precursor optically thin stage is well studied , e.g.  in the magellanic clouds @xcite .",
    "encoded in the time- and wavelength - dependent properties of these pulsating asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) stars are the underlying fundamental parameters of mass , composition and evolutionary state @xcite . with @xmath55mags kiss can measure bolometric light curves for such stars in the lmc & smc , complementing the shorter wavelength work @xcite .",
    "other complementary surveys to observe the agb population of the magellanic clouds are the deep near infrared survey of the southern sky ( denis ) @xcite , the surveying the agents of a galaxy s evolution surveys with the spitzer telescope for the lmc ( sage  lmc ) @xcite and the smc ( sage  smc ) @xcite ; see fig .  [",
    "fig : sage ] @xcite for the corresponding colour - magnitude diagram for agb stars .",
    "mira period luminosity relationships have typically used v or i band periods combined with single epoch k band photometry .",
    "this is critical , because it is the mean luminosity of the variable that relates to the period , not the luminosity at single epochs . when infrared filter data are available , it has been difficult to collect sufficient data with a single instrument to uniquely identify pulsation modes .",
    "kiss will enable a greater number of infrared photometric points for key nearby galaxies , including the magellanic clouds and ngc 5128 ( centaurus a ) . when combined with optical photometry from surveys such as skymapper and lsst , the degeneracy between initial mass and evolutionary state @xcite has the potential to be broken , enabling much more accurate distances and evolutionary states for individual objects .",
    "the area of the magellanic clouds is 100 square degrees .",
    "these fields should be observed at least twice a year for appropriate coverage of long period variables .",
    "mira variables are all brighter than the tip of the red giant branch , which has an absolute k magnitude of about @xmath56 ( it is metallicity dependent ) . at the distance of the lmc / smc , their magnitudes are brighter than 13 , so that 1 minute exposures are easily sufficient .    for a study of the stellar populations of centaurus",
    "a , several epochs are desirable targeting 0.1 mag precision at @xmath57 , extending the work of rejkuba .",
    "this would require 6 hours of integration . a minimum of two visits to the target per season would be needed .",
    "recent wide - area transient surveys have identified thousands of events ( e.g. , the various classifications of novae and supernovae ) that completely fill the luminosity vs.  characteristic timescale parameter space from @xmath28day to @xmath28yr @xcite . however",
    ", there exists a large number of theorised , and a handful of serendipitously observed , faster evolving events occurring on millisecond - to - hour timescales ( figure  [ fasttransients ] ) .",
    "examples include fast radio bursts ( frbs ) that are millisecond bursts in the radio that are likely of cosmological origin @xcite , supernova shock break - outs @xcite , electromagnetic counterparts to gravitational waves @xcite such as kilonovae @xcite , gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) , including ` dark ' and ` bursty ' events @xcite , flare stars @xcite , type .ia",
    "supernovae @xcite ( supernovae with roughly one - tenth the timescale and luminosity as type ia supernovae ) , and tidal disruption events @xcite .",
    "the millisecond - to - hours time domain has previously been little explored largely as a result of technological and observational challenges necessary for fast , real - time detection and study .",
    "the deeper , wider , faster ( dwf ) program @xcite has overcome these challenges by :    * coordinating _ simultaneous _ observations using multiple , major ( and , thus , sensitive ) observatories at wavelengths from the radio to gamma - ray , * performing real - time supercomputer data reduction , calibration and analysis in seconds to minutes , * executing real - time computational and state - of - the - art visualisation technologies for real - time candidate identification , * initiating rapid response ( minutes ) deep spectroscopic follow - up programs using 8m - class telescopes , and * coordinating a global network of telescopes for short - to - long duration follow - up imaging .",
    "dwf organises and coordinates observations by a worldwide network of small to large telescopes to detect and study transients on millisecond - to - hours timescales . as dwf is a ` living ' program , some facilities are added or changed over time as the program evolves and grows . at its core , dwf performs simultaneous , deep , wide - field , fast - cadenced observations using the ctio dark energy camera ( decam ) on the 4 m blanco telescope ( optical ) , the nasa swift satellite bat ( gamma - ray ) , xrt ( x - ray ) and uvot ( ultraviolet / optical ) instruments , the 64 m parkes observatory ( radio ) , the 1 km molonglo observatory synthesis telescope ( radio ) and the jansky very large array ( vla ) 25 m ( radio ) telescopes .",
    "recently added to the simultaneous observations is the 0.68 m antarctic ast3 - 2 telescope ( optical ) .",
    "dwf also performs rapid response ( within minutes ) target of opportunity spectroscopic observations of fast transient candidates with the 8 m gemini - south telescope ( optical / infrared ) , 0.3 m nasa swift uvot ( ultraviolet / optical ) and proposed 8 m vlt telescope ( optical / infrared ) .",
    "furthermore , dwf performs conventional ( same night ) target of opportunity spectroscopic observations with the 11 m south african large telescope ( salt ) and the 4 m anglo - australian telescope .",
    "finally , dwf coordinates a combination of interleaved and long - duration ( weeks ) photometry using the 1.3 m skymapper , 1 m zadko , 1 m mount laguna observatory and 0.68 m antarctica ast3 - 2 telescopes ( all optical ) .",
    "one of the primary goals of dwf is to provide simultaneous multi - wavelength coverage of frb detections to search for shorter wavelength counterparts , localise the sources , confirm / refute their cosmological nature , study their host galaxies and help understand the mechanism(s ) behind their energy . as a result ,",
    "simultaneous data are acquired at radio , optical , uv , x - ray and gamma - ray wavelengths .",
    "in addition , dwf has a memorandum of understanding ( mou ) with the ligo - virgo consortium and is notified of gravitational wave ( gw ) events . upon notification , dwf converts into a tiling mode and moves the core telescopes to cover the positional error ellipse of the gw event ( depending on the ellipse location ) .",
    "dwf obtains temporal coverage of the event location at multiple wavelengths and to deeper magnitudes compared to other follow - up programs .",
    "however , there is an important gap in wavelength coverage in the dwf network of telescopes at infrared wavelengths which kiss can fulfil .",
    "observations for dwf are classically proposed and scheduled , with coordinated runs currently occurring @xmath58 times a year at @xmath28 week each . to enable simultaneous visibility for radio observations in australia and optical observations in chile , and to maximise time on source ( @xmath59hrs ) ,",
    "the physical limits of the telescopes require dwf target fields to reside between dec @xmath60 . as a result , the dwf fields are necessarily observable with kiss .",
    "dwf receives immediate ( seconds ) frb identifications from parkes and/or molonglo , bursts from swift , and gw alerts from ligo .",
    "apart from these rare , but high priority targets , the analysis of decam optical images ( candidates in minutes ) dominate the transient detections . the rapid ( 20s ) decam images are most sensitive to transients with m @xmath61 mags .",
    "fainter , slower evolving events can be detected in the stacked nightly , or semi - nightly images .",
    "although dwf performs real - time , fast data analysis and candidate identification , the program also conducts a comprehensive search for fast transients in the data after the observing runs . finally , some fast transients ( e.g. , supernova shock breakout , very early supernova detections , type .ia supernovae ) require long term ( days / weeks ) follow - up to identify and classify the events and to study their evolution .",
    "the geographical location , sensitivity , wavelength and temporal coverage of kiss make it an ideal observatory to complete the needs of dwf .",
    "kiss observations can be coordinated with the dwf runs and can provide continuous , 24-hour photometric coverage during the observations .",
    "the simultaneous and continuous coverage is crucial to obtain the light curves of events on minutes - to - hours timescales .",
    "the ability of kiss to acquire complete , unbroken light curves of these events is extremely important and makes kiss unique .",
    "light curves for events with hours to @xmath28 day durations can not be obtained by any higher latitude facility .",
    "fragmented photometry of such events would rarely provide sufficient data for confirmation and would not enable study and classification .    the infrared regime is vital for many fast transients detected by dwf .",
    "kiss is ideal for the detection and study of fast transients in fields near the galactic plane , such as frb fields , and are , thus , subject to heavy galactic extinction at shorter wavelengths . in addition , kiss will be highly effective in identifying and rapidly confirming flare stars , as the variation can result in negative flux in the infrared to account for the flare energy at other wavelengths @xcite .",
    "dwf detects early outbursts of supernovae and kiss will be key to obtaining their light curves over days for classification .",
    "finally , kiss will be a powerful facility to detect and confirm kilonovae ( one aftermath scenario of the merger of two neutron stars ) , that are strong gw candidate sources , as they have hours - to - days timescales and are modelled to peak in the infrared @xcite .",
    "kiss is projected to transmit source catalogues relatively quickly , which can be utilised in real - time during the dwf observation runs .",
    "in addition , archived kiss data will be highly useful for all transient detections and for the full analysis of dwf data performed after the runs . finally , all candidate gw source transients detected by dwf and kiss will be ` reversed ' searched in the ligo / virgo databases .",
    "information of the time and location of the events enable higher sensitivity searches in the gw data .",
    "sne ia , after empirical calibrations of their luminosities @xcite , are now the best standard candles to measure distances across the universe . using sne ia , it was discovered in the late twentieth century that the expansion of the universe is accelerating @xcite .",
    "it is not yet known what causes this acceleration and this unknown energy is termed dark energy .",
    "current observations supports the vacuum energy interpretation as the force behind the observed acceleration , yet other explanations are possible . if the vacuum energy interpretation is correct , and is constant over time , it violates fundamental physics and a new physical explanation is needed . on the other hand ,",
    "the time varying nature of dark energy is hard to detect due to several systematic uncertainties in cosmological measurements .",
    "one way to minimise the systematics , which originated from the intrinsic luminosity scatter in sne ia , is to measure these objects in the ir .",
    "it has been shown that sne ia in the ir have the least scatter in the hubble diagram @xcite , hence they provide better standard candles .",
    "therefore , one important science goal of kiss is to discover sne ia in the ir .",
    "kiss will be able to discover hundreds of sne ia in the local universe and these will act as the low redshift anchor of the hubble diagram . the high redshift part of the ir hubble diagram can be filled with the sne ia from other future ir facilities , such as wfirst .",
    "sn ia peak at k = 17.5 mag at 200 mpc .",
    "there should be @xmath62/yr sne ia detectable from dome a with k @xmath6317.5 mag based on sdss statistics @xcite .",
    "kiss will also be able to undertake ir follow - up of optical sne ia that will be discovered from skymapper @xcite .",
    "although sne rates in starburst galaxies are higher , with current image subtraction technique in the optical , their discoveries are often hindered by their proximities to bright nuclei of host galaxies . in the ir , it is possible to see though to the central dusty obscuration of hosts and discover sne .",
    "however , even with precision photometry , agn variability ( reverberation ) , if present in starburst galaxies , may affect positive sne discoveries .",
    "therefore , an essential component of a project targeting sne in the highly extinguished nuclei of star forming galaxies harbouring agns is a parallel survey program in the optical to a comparable depth as in the near - infrared .",
    "such a parallel survey can be carried out on a small telescope , such as ast31 and ast32 at dome a. supernovae that are buried deeply inside the nuclei of agns have light curves that are fairly well understood .",
    "optical light curves define the light curves of the agn variability and so help to separate the supernova signal in the k  band from the variability associated with agn activity .      for the kiss sne survey",
    "the aim is to make early sne discoveries , i.e.  soon after the explosion and before the peak in the light curve .",
    "this requires a high cadence for the search , @xmath28 sample per day .",
    "supposing 10% of the winter observing time were devoted to such a search , then , based on the sample surveys in table  [ tab : surveys ] , in 60 seconds of integration we can cover @xmath64 with @xmath65 camera fields , and providing @xmath13 samples per winter season .",
    "the @xmath66 sensitivity achieved ranges from 16.5 - 17.9 mags .  for the extrema in observing conditions experienced at dome a , sufficient to make detections of sne based on the sdss statistics discussed above .",
    "optical imaging follow - up will be carried out by ast32 , skymapper and la silla quest , and spectroscopic follow - up with the wifes instrument on the anu 2.3 m .",
    "the region very close to the central supermassive black hole echoes its activity . in ir the dust morphology of the agn is probed .",
    "the goal of infrared reverberation mapping is to characterise dust in the central disk or torus as a function of black hole mass and galaxy dynamics .",
    "monthly measurements of ngc 4151 have been modelled @xcite by a static distribution of central ( @xmath31pc ) hot dust .",
    "acquisition of similar time domain data on a significant sample of nearby seyfert galaxies is proposed as part of kiss .",
    "a suitable very nearby target is ngc1566 @xcite .",
    "the associated stars have central velocity dispersion measurable with the anu s wifes and eso s sinfoni instruments @xcite .",
    "together with the radius , this yields the mass of the black hole .",
    "the technique is as follows :    1 .",
    "monitor time variability of agn at k@xmath67 ( and at other wavelengths from siding spring observatory ) .",
    "2 .   undertake a two - component decomposition of the sed , into a power law + black body .",
    "3 .   determine the temporal evolution of temperature + solid angle for the reverberating hot dust .",
    "we plan to monitor the ten closest seyferts in the southern hemisphere on a monthly basis .",
    "grbs are the most violent stellar explosions in the universe . at ultra - high redshifts ( e.g.  @xmath68 ) they require the infrared to be found .",
    "models for wfirst @xcite of the time evolution of grbs from 1.5 to 4.4@xmath2 m indicate that those at @xmath69 will be accessible in @xmath70 from antarctica .",
    "currently , fewer than 10 grbs have been found with redshift @xmath71 .",
    "high-@xmath72 grbs are potential probes for the early universe , exploring the first generation of stars ( pop iii stars ) and early cosmic star formation .",
    "with infrared spectroscopic observations , high-@xmath72 grbs will provide opportunities to probe the re - ionization as well as cosmic metallicity evolution .",
    "intrinsic grb and afterglow spectra are usually power - laws .",
    "thus , combining @xmath70 observations with simultaneous optical ( e.g.  @xmath73-band ) measurements would easily identify whether the grb is highly absorbed in the optical or not .",
    "if the optical emission from the grb is heavily absorbed , then it may have been born in a dusty star - forming region .",
    "alternatively , its redshift is high .",
    "dust obscuration and high - redshift are two possible origins of the so - called dark grbs @xcite .",
    "in fact , the dust extinction in @xmath74 of grb optical afterglows is @xmath75 mags , while @xmath76 of grb afterglows suffer more dust absorption @xcite .",
    "early follow - up observations after the grb trigger in the @xmath70-band will not only explore the properties of the infrared emission of their afterglows and hence the underlying physics related to the grb outflows and circum - burst environments , but also initiate further spectroscopic observations with much larger telescopes if the joint @xmath70 and @xmath73 band spectrum is unusual .",
    "the latter may lead to the discovery of high - redshift grbs .",
    "compared with other wavelengths , such as gamma - ray , x - ray , optical , and even radio , the infrared follow - up is the most lacked band in grb observations . over the past two decades",
    ", many new features have been discovered , such as optical flashes during the prompt grb phase , x - ray flares and plateaus in the early afterglow phase .",
    "as the infrared emission suffers no or little dust absorption , it is expected that the infrared observations will bring new information .",
    "one successful but rare example is the discovery of an infrared flash that accompanied the gamma - ray prompt emission of grb 041219a @xcite , which advanced our understanding of the physics of prompt grbs .",
    "infrared emission is not only expected during the prompt grbs , but also in the afterglows , including the flaring stage and the plateau phase .",
    "as grbs and afterglows are fast - fading transients , it would be better to do early ( e.g. , within 1 hour of the grb trigger ) follow - up observations with kiss . with contemporaneous observations at optical bands , real - time spectral analysis should be carried out to judge whether the grb possibly originated at high - redshift . if so further target of opportunity ( too ) spectroscopic observations would then be carried out with 10 m class telescopes .",
    "@xmath1 is a choice wavelength for observing the first stars in the epoch of re - ionization ( eor ) , as the rest frame is the ultraviolet at @xmath77 .",
    "simulations @xcite show complementarity with observation of neutral hydrogen .",
    "the expectation is that the large - scale structure ( lss ) in kiss will be anti - correlated with the lss in mwa , for example .",
    "the large scale power in the infrared background is not caused by the zodiacal light @xcite .",
    "on smaller scales we have made a toy model for a @xmath78 square at @xmath79/pixel with no background noise ; the calculation stops at @xmath80 .",
    "the assumptions of the toy model are :    1 .",
    "galaxies aggregate according to abramson et al .",
    "the cosmic sfh is that of gladders et al .",
    "3 .   galaxy seds and m / l from bressan et al .",
    "standard cosmology with no extinction .",
    "the mean value of @xmath81 is @xmath82 .    the fluctuation spectrum for the toy model is shown in figure  [ fig : cib ] .",
    "the normalization value of @xmath83 was chosen from the dirbe observations @xcite .",
    "the nicmos deep field fluctuation spectrum for shorter wavelengths is discussed by thompson et al .",
    "the thermal background in low earth orbit prohibited a k  band filter in nicmos .",
    "more elaborate models for the kiss fluctuation spectrum will constrain star formation at high redshift .",
    "a high signal to noise deep field will be required to detect the fluctuation spectrum as the kunlun station winter background at @xmath1 is 100 @xmath2jy per arcsec@xmath84 , which is 240 times the dirbe cib .",
    "we plan to evolve a strategy to obtain the deepest possible field to probe the cosmic infrared background , in combination with high cadence measurements obtained from other survey programs .",
    "kiss will provide the first comprehensive exploration of the time varying universe in the infrared at the longest wavelength where deep , high resolution observations can be conducted from the ground , @xmath85 m .",
