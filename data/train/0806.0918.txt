    "quantization has become an important field of information theory since the early @xmath10 s .",
    "nowadays , it plays an important rule in digital signal processing ( dsp ) , the basis of many areas of technology , from mobile phones to modems and multimedia pcs . in dsp",
    ", quantization is the process of approximating a continuous range of values or a very large set of discrete values by a relatively small set of discrete values .",
    "a common use of quantization is the conversion of a continuous signal into a digital signal .",
    "this is performed in analog - to - digital converters with a given quantization level . beside these fields",
    ", quantization has recently become a domain of interest in numerical probability specially in numerical pricing of financial derivatives when their prices read as an expectation ( or involve conditional expectations ) of some random processes ( see e.g. @xmath11 ) .    from a mathematical point of view , the @xmath12-optimal quantization problem at level @xmath5 for a @xmath1-valued random vector @xmath13 lying in @xmath14 consists in finding the best approximation of @xmath13 by @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is a borel function taking at most @xmath5 values .",
    "this reads as the following minimization problem : @xmath17 note that in fact @xmath18 only depends on the distribution @xmath19 of @xmath13 so that we will also use the notation @xmath20 .",
    "however , for any borel function @xmath21 we have @xmath22 so that the quantization problem reduces to @xmath23 where @xmath24 and @xmath25 corresponds to a voronoi partition of @xmath1 ( with respect to a norm @xmath26 on @xmath1 ) , that is , a borel partition of @xmath1 satisfying for every @xmath27 , @xmath28    for every @xmath6 , the infimum in @xmath29 holds as a finite minimum reached ( at least ) at one grid @xmath30 . in this case",
    "@xmath30 is called an * @xmath4-optimal * ( or @xmath12-optimal for @xmath13 ) and a sequence of @xmath5-quantizers @xmath31 is @xmath4-optimal if for every @xmath6 , @xmath32 is @xmath4-optimal .",
    "a sequence @xmath31 is said * asymptotically @xmath4-optimal * if @xmath33    moreover the @xmath12-quantization error @xmath18 decreases to @xmath34 as @xmath5 goes to infinity and if there is an @xmath35-moment of @xmath13 , for @xmath36 , the so - called zador s theorem recalled below rules its rate of convergence to @xmath34 .",

    "very little is known about the geometric properties of optimal quantizers . in this paper",
    "we address a first problem in this direction : we study the asymptotic behavior of the radii of a sequence @xmath3 of @xmath12-optimal quantizers . the maximal radius ( or simply radius ) @xmath51 of a quantizer @xmath52",
    "is defined by @xmath53 in our framework , @xmath26 will be an euclidean norm on @xmath1 .",
    "for the sake of simplicity , we will denote from now on by @xmath54 the sequence @xmath55 of radii of a sequence @xmath3 of optimal quantizers ( although it may be not unique ) .",
    "we will show that , as soon as @xmath56 is unbounded , @xmath57 besides , our key inequalities to get the upper and lower estimates of the maximal radius sequence are provided in theorem @xmath58 and theorem @xmath59 .",
    "the first theorem yields amount others the maximal rate of convergence of @xmath60 ( when @xmath61 ) to @xmath34 , for every @xmath62 , with @xmath63 if @xmath64 and @xmath65 otherwise .",
    "it claims that this rate is at most equals to @xmath66 .",
    "theorem @xmath59 maintains in particular that for every @xmath67 , @xmath68 goes to @xmath34 , as @xmath5 goes to infinity , at a rate at less equals to @xmath69 , where @xmath70 is such that the random vector @xmath13 has an @xmath71-distribution ( see definition @xmath72 ) .",
    "we will see later on that the index @xmath73 ensuring that @xmath13 has an @xmath71-distribution for every @xmath74 will play a crucial role in the lower limit estimates of the maximal radius sequence .",
    "then we will emphasize how knowing the asymptotic behavior of the function @xmath75 allow to derive the asymptotic estimates of @xmath76 ( or @xmath77 ) . as an important example we can already mention distributions with density function @xmath78 satisfying @xmath79 for which the optimal rate of convergence of @xmath77 is computed and given by @xmath80 of course , this result is less accurate as giving the rate of convergence of the sequence @xmath81 itself for which the exact limit can not be computed with our approach because the upper and lower limits make appear no identified constants .",
    "another example concerns distributions with exponential tail for which the upper and lower rates of convergence of the sequence @xmath81 are provided .",
    "this is the case for the normally distributed random vector on @xmath1 for which we have @xmath82 our general conjecture for such distributions , which is proved when @xmath83 and @xmath84 , is that the liminf bound is sharp , that is , @xmath85 moreover , an alternative approach is given for the lower limit estimates .",

    "estimates of the maximal radius sequence are given and the exact limit is provided when the cardinal of the support of @xmath0 is infinite .",
    "this limit corresponds to @xmath87 and section 3 is entirely devoted to the convergence rate of the sequence of radii to this limit value .",
