    "global warming and limited energy issues have increased the interest in the energy management and in particular heat losses . indeed , heat wasted in energy production processes and thermal machines could in principle be better used in many applications if it could be guided or transport in a similar way as electricity . however",
    ", if heat pipes have been proved to be good candidates for thermal guiding , there exists few devices at the moment that can switch or amplify heat as is the case for electricity .    in electricity ,",
    "the development of diodes @xcite and transistors @xcite have led to its control at the scale of the electron , leading to the emergence of electronics .",
    "one can therefore wonder whether heat could be managed in the same way , if the thermal equivalent of these two objects would exist . in the last decade ,",
    "several works have focused on the development of thermal rectifiers , i.e devices for which the thermal fluxes flowing through them is different in magnitude when the temperatures are inverted at their ends .",
    "thus , phononic @xcite and electronic @xcite thermal diodes or rectifiers have been developed , that have later led to the proposition of thermal transistors @xcite .",
    "later , these concepts have been extended to the case of thermal radiation both in the near field @xcite and far field @xcite .",
    "the most interesting results have been found through the use of phase change thermochrome materials @xcite , such as vo@xmath0@xcite .",
    "recently , thermal transistors have been designed using similar properties @xcite .    in the last years , individual quantum systems , such as classical atoms @xcite or artificial ones , as is the case of quantum dots @xcite , have been proposed to develop photon rectifiers @xcite , transistors @xcite or even electrically controlled phonon transistors @xcite . moreover , as quantum systems are always coupled to the environment , the question of how heat is transferred through a set of quantum systems in interaction naturally has arisen @xcite and led to several works on thermal rectification @xcite .    the goal of this article is to use elementary quantum objects , such as two - level systems ( tls ) related to thermal baths , for developing thermal diodes and thermal transistors .",
    "to do so , we will use the classical quantum thermodynamics formalism proposed by lindblad that is based on the resolution of a master equation for the density matrix .",
    "we show , following the work of werlang et al .",
    "@xcite , that 2 tls can easily make a thermal diode and that 3 tls can make a thermal transistor .",
    "these three tls related to thermal reservoirs are equivalent to the three entries of a bipolar electronic transistor .",
    "it is shown that a thermal current imposed at the base can drive the currents at the two other entries of the system .",
    "we consider in the following , that tls are connected to a thermal bath and that can be coupled one to each other .",
    "two configurations are studied in this article : 2 tls coupled to each other make a thermal diode , whereas 3 coupled tls make a thermal transistor .",
    "the system under consideration consists of two coupled tls , each of them related to a thermal bath , as depicted in fig.[systemdiode ] .",
    "the two tls are labeled with the letters @xmath1 ( left ) and @xmath2 ( right ) , which is also the case of the temperature of the thermal baths related to tls .",
    "we use the strong - coupling formalism developed by werlang _",
    "each of the tls is caracterized by an angular frequency @xmath3 or @xmath4 .",
    "the coupling between the two tls has the typical angular frequency @xmath5 .",
    "the hamiltionian of the system is ( in @xmath6 units ) @xmath7 where @xmath8 ( @xmath9 ) is the pauli matrix @xmath10 , whose eigenstates for the system @xmath11 are the states @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "@xmath14 eigenstates are given by the tensorial product of the individual tls states , so that we have 4 eigenstates labeled as @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 .",
    "the coupling between the tls and the thermal bath @xmath11 constituted of harmonic oscillators @xcite , is based on the spin - boson model in the @xmath19 component @xmath20 .",
    "the two reservoirs @xmath11 have their hamiltonians equal to @xmath21 .",
    "this modeling implies that baths can only flip one spin at a time .",

    "now imagine that @xmath55 is of the order of the transition energies , whereas @xmath56 is much lower .",
    "then , energy will easily flow from reservoir @xmath1 to reservoir @xmath2 according to the process described above .",
    "on the contrary , if @xmath56 is much lower than the transition energies and @xmath49 then the energy transfer is poor since excitation by reservoir @xmath2 through transition @xmath57 and @xmath58 is low .",
    "hence , if we study the flux @xmath59 with @xmath56 fixed at a value lower than the transition energies ( for example @xmath60 , fig . [ flux1001 ] )",
    ", we see that the flux is close to 0 when @xmath49 .     in the case",
    "@xmath45 , @xmath46 and @xmath47 with @xmath61,width=302 ]    when @xmath55 is increased to values larger than @xmath56 , the current inceases until saturation at high temperatures .",
    "the calculation of @xmath62 , which gives the current , can be achieved by solving the system of equations on the populations ( @xmath63 ) .",
    "note that the system of equations are not totally independent since the fourth equation is actually the sum of the three others .",
    "one has to use the fact that the trace of the density matrix is equal to 1 ( tr[@xmath28]=1 ) .",
    "the exact expression of @xmath62 can be found in @xcite . in the case",
    "studied here , this expression can be simplified and the current reads @xmath65 where the transition from low current values , at low @xmath55 , to high current values , at higher @xmath55 , can be seen .",
    "let us note that the system proposed here constitutes a passive thermal switch at low temperature .",
    "as long as @xmath55 is larger than @xmath56 , the current in the structure is important and the thermal contact is good between the reservoirs @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "however , when the temperature @xmath55 reduces to values below @xmath56 , the thermal current is drastically lowered , so that it can be seen as switched off .",
    "this system could therefore be used to isolate objects from a cold environment while it would be thermally linked to a hot environment . in a case of an environment with temperatures oscillating between high and low values , this simple quantum system can be seen as a passive heater and a thermal rectifier , i.e that heat flow through it depends on the direction of the heat flux .",
    "there is actually another way to quantify the rectification of a system .",
    "this is the ratio between the sum of the fluxes through the system when the temperatures are reversed and the maximum of these 2 fluxes @xmath66 the rectification ratio @xmath67 variations with @xmath55 for different @xmath56 are represented in fig .",

    "when @xmath56 is larger , rectification is smaller , even for @xmath55 values that are greatly different from @xmath56 .",
    "we note in particular , that rectification is low for high @xmath56 temperature . in this later case",
    ", there is no rectification , because heat transfer can occur with both reservoir with help of the energy transitions presented above .",
    "however , when @xmath56 is fixed , and @xmath55 goes to 0 , then @xmath71 tends to 0 . as well",
    ", rectification rises to 1 .",
    "this kind of device can thus be seen as a thermal diode , since the heat current through the system is nonzero when the heat flux is in a given direction and 0 when it is in the opposite one .",
    "this type of system paves the way to develop more complicated ones .",
    "for example , it is well known that electronic transistors as the bipolar ones , can be made up npn et pnp junctions whereas it well known that the pn junction constitutes a diode .",
    "one can therefore wonder if it is also possible to conceive a transistor with the elementary quantum system that constitutes the thermal diode that we have just studied in this section .",
    "this is the subject of the next section .",
    "the system studied in this part is constituted of three tls coupled with each other , each of them being connected to a thermal bath ( fig .",
    "[ system ] ) .",
    "this system is therefore similar to the previous one with one supplementary tls and reservoir .",
    "the three tls are now labeled with the letters @xmath1 ( left ) , @xmath72 ( medium ) , and @xmath2 ( right ) , as well as the temperature of the thermal baths involved . as in the previous part ,",

    "there are now 12 authorized transitions .",
    "the left bath ( @xmath1 ) induces the transitions @xmath85 , @xmath86 , @xmath87 , and @xmath88 , the middle one ( @xmath72 ) drives the transitions @xmath22 , @xmath89 , @xmath90 , and @xmath91 .",
    "the right bath ( @xmath2 ) triggers the transitions @xmath24 , @xmath92 , @xmath93 , and @xmath94 .",
    "all other transitions flipping more than one spin are forbidden .",
    "the master equation fulfilling the density matrix , in the born - markov approximation , reads @xmath29+{\\cal{l}}_l[\\rho]+{\\cal{l}}_m[\\rho]+{\\cal{l}}_r[\\rho].\\ ] ] we now go to the steady state situation .",
    "averaging the master equation , we find @xmath95 , in accordance with the energy conservation .    the master equation is a system of eight equations on the diagonal elements @xmath36 .",
    "introducing the net decaying rate from state @xmath37 to the state @xmath38 due to the coupling with bath @xmath11 , the master equation becomes @xmath96 these eight equations are not independent since their sum is 0 . in order to solve the system for @xmath36 ,",
    "one adds the condition @xmath97=1 $ ] whose resolution provides all state occupation probabilities as well as the currents @xmath98 .",
    "we are now going to show that such a system is able to make a thermal transistor analogous to an electronic one .",
    "let us recall that in an electronic bipolar transistor , such as a pnp or a npn transistor , a current imposed at the base can modulate , switch or amplify the collector and emitter currents .",
    "switching , modulation , and amplification are therefore the caracteristics that must be present in order to have a transistor .",
    "we are going to show here that it is possible to control @xmath99 or @xmath100 by slightly changing @xmath101 .",
    "the situation is the following : the left and right tls are both connected to thermal baths , whose respective temperatures @xmath55 and @xmath56 are fixed .",
    "the third bath at temperature @xmath102 controls the fluxes @xmath99 and @xmath100 with the help of the current @xmath101 injected into the system .",
    "the dynamical amplification factor @xmath103 , defined as @xmath104 measures the transistor ability to amplify a small heat flux variation at the base ( m ) .",
    "if a small change in @xmath101 induces a large one in @xmath99 or @xmath100 , i.e. @xmath105 , then the thermal transistor effect exists . the system presented here exhibit many parameters : the frequencies @xmath74 , @xmath75 and the temperatures @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "the last temperature @xmath102 , that is taken here between @xmath55 and @xmath56 , controls the transistor properties and is related to the current @xmath101 .",
    "the number of parameters involved can be reduced by choosing a situation that will not change the physics of the system but will allow a good understanding of the physical phenomena involved .",
    "we therefore restrict our analysis to a case for which @xmath106 , whereas @xmath107 and the three tls energies are equal to 0 .",
    "as shown below , this configuration provides a good transistor effect , easy to handle with simple calculations .",
    "the transistor effect disappears when the three couplings are equal ( symmetric configuration ) , but it still occurs and can even be optimized if the three tls energies are nonzero @xcite . the operating temperature @xmath55 is taken so that @xmath108 ( @xmath109 ) , whereas @xmath110 ( @xmath111 ) .    under these conditions ,",
