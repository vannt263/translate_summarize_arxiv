    "since their introduction almost a decade ago,@xcite methods for carrying out first - principles electronic - structure calculations under conditions of fixed electric field @xmath0 have found wide application in the study of the dielectric , piezoelectric , and ferroelectric behavior of materials.@xcite more recently , variants of this approach , in which the electric polarization@xcite or the electric displacement field @xcite is taken as the fundamental variable instead , have been introduced . fixing the displacement field @xmath1",
    "has the intuitive interpretation of imposing open - circuit electrical boundary conditions , which is often especially useful for studying layered geometries such as metal - oxide interfaces@xcite and ferroelectric capacitors@xcite and superlattices.@xcite    there are several reasons why the fixed-@xmath1 approach is advantageous for such applications . in a superlattice structure , the local polarization @xmath2 and electric field @xmath0 can vary from one layer to another , so their overall spatial average is not a fundamental quantity . in contrast , @xmath1 is constant throughout the system , since free charge is assumed to be absent .",
    "( here , @xmath0 , @xmath2 and @xmath1 refer to the field components in the stacking direction . )",
    "therefore , choosing @xmath1 as the fundamental electrical variable is especially practical because it makes it possible to decompose the equation of state of a layered structure into the sum of contributions from the individual building blocks,@xcite with each of these contributions depending only on the local environment .",
    "moreover , long- and short - range electrostatic interactions are separated efficiently .",
    "such an approach facilitates the design of superlattice structures of desired functionality by appropriate choice of the stacking sequence.@xcite    even for bulk crystals , it turns out that working at fixed @xmath3 is more convenient than working at fixed @xmath4 when considering materials that have ferroelectric instabilities .",
    "( we now refer to three - dimensional field vectors . )",
    "the reason is that , in the region of the energy landscape near the unstable paraelectric configuration , the system is unstable to transformation into one of the ferroelectric domain states when working at fixed @xmath4 .",
    "the unstable paraelectric region of the @xmath5 energy landscape is thus inaccessible using this approach .",
    "when working at fixed @xmath3 , on the other hand , the internal energy @xmath6 is typically found to be a single - valued function of @xmath3,@xcite thus allowing access to the entire electric equation of state.@xcite moreover , the second derivative of @xmath7 with respect to @xmath3 is directly related to the inverse capacitance of the material.@xcite when this quantity goes negative , it is a signature of the appearance of a ferroelectric instability , and indeed the magnitude of its negative value has been shown to be an insightful indicator of the strength of the ferroelectric instability.@xcite for example , it can play an important role in determining the critical thickness for ferroelectricity in capacitor nanostructures,@xcite and its dependence on material structure and composition can be helpful in understanding the origin of the ferroelectric instability .    up to now",
    ", applications of the fixed - displacement - field approach have been carried out using the private lautrec code package,@xcite in which the fixed-@xmath1 constraint can be applied in only one cartesian direction . in the present work ,",
    "we have implemented the multidimensional fixed-@xmath3 method in the context of the open - source abinit code package@xcite and demonstrates that it can be used to calculate the energy surface throughout the region of instability associated with the ferroelectric behavior , using  as our prototypical material . by mapping the internal - energy landscape in the full three - dimensional @xmath3 space",
    ", we can easily compare the energies of the competing ferroelectric states , trace the paths connecting these states , and compute the energy barriers along these paths .",
    "this approach therefore gives us a powerful tool for characterizing the ferroelectric behavior of a given material in all of its three - dimensional complexity in @xmath3 ( or @xmath4 or @xmath8 ) space .",

    ", we have modified the open - source abinit code package , in which the fixed-@xmath15 calculation is already available .",
    "@xcite the key step is to update the electric field @xmath15 after each scf iteration according to @xmath16 where @xmath17 and @xmath18 are polarization and electric field after the @xmath19th scf iteration and @xmath20 is a damping parameter used to control the convergence speed .",
    "the iteration continues until the normal scf convergence criterion is reached , and in addition , @xmath21 becomes less than a given tolerance .",
    "our calculations were performed within density - functional theory in the local - density approximation@xcite using norm - conserving pseudopotentials @xcite and a plane - wave cutoff of 60 ha .",
    "the pseudopotentials were the same as those of ref  .",

    "in order to test our implementation and compare the results with the previous calculation of ref .  , we have computed the internal energy @xmath7 and the electric field @xmath0 as a function of @xmath1 for the case that @xmath3 lies along the [ 001 ] axis .",

    "this is a highly unrealistic picture of real ferroelectric switching , which usually proceeds by the motion of a domain wall between domains of different orientation of the polarization .",
    "@xcite our intrinsic coercive field of 2.5mv / cm for the [ 001 ] case , which can be obtained from @xmath0 at state 2 in panel ( a ) or ( c ) , is sure to be very much larger than the experimental one , which is most likely determined by pinning of domain walls to defects or by nucleation phenomena .",
    "it is also instructive to see how the energy functionals behave as one traverses the trajectories shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : variables ] .",
    "recall that the energy functionals that are naturally associated with field variables @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath0 are @xmath64 , @xmath65 , and @xmath66 ; these are plotted in panels ( a - c ) of fig .",

    "each plot again shows the behavior for fields constrained along either [ 001 ] , [ 110 ] , or [ 111 ] , and the special states 1 - 5 are again marked for the [ 001 ] case .",
    "the @xmath64 and @xmath65 plots in panels",
    "( a - b ) look remarkably similar after a rescaling of the horizontal axis by a factor of @xmath67 .",
    "this is not surprising , since states 1 , 3 , and 5 have @xmath68 , and are thus guaranteed to be extrema and to appear in exactly the same place in both panels ( after @xmath67 rescaling ) .",
    "the inflection points corresponding to states 2 and 4 are not located in quite the same place in both diagrams , but it is difficult to tell this by eye . both panels clearly show a qualitatively similar double - well potential .",
