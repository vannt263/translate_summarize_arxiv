    "among many different data hiding techniques proposed to embed secret message within images , the lsb data hiding technique is one of the simplest methods for inserting data into digital signals in noise free environments , which merely embeds secret message - bits in a subset of the lsb planes of the image .",
    "( lsb is the least significant bit or the 0th bit , the second lsb is the 1st bit , and so on ) . despite being simple ,",
    "this technique is more predictable and hence less secure , also psnr ( peak signal to noise ratio ) decreases very rapidly as we use the higher bit planes for data hiding .",
    "as soon as we go from lsb ( least significant bit ) to msb ( most significant bit ) for selection of bit - planes for our message embedding , the distortion in stego - image is likely to increase exponentially , so it becomes impossible ( without noticeable distortion and with exponentially increasing distance from cover - image and stego - image ) to use higher bit - planes for embedding without any further processing",
    ". the workarounds may be : through the random lsb replacement ( in stead of sequential ) , secret messages can be randomly scattered in stego - images , so the security can be improved . also , using the approaches given by variable depth lsb algorithm @xcite , or by the optimal substitution process based on genetic algorithm and local pixel adjustment @xcite , one is able to hide data to some extent in higher bit - planes as well .",
    "+ battisti _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , @xcite proposed a novel data hiding technique from a totally different perspective , it uses a different bit - planes decomposition altogether , based on the generalized fibonacci - p - sequences , that not only increases the number of embeddable bit - planes but also decreases psnr in the stego image considerably , thereby improving the lsb technique . in this paper , we first prove some theoretical upper and lower bounds for generalized fibonacci - p - sequence and give a theoretical proof for the better performance of the data hiding technique using generalized fibonacci decomposition , i.e. , why the data hiding technique using this decomposition not only gives larger number of bit planes for hiding secret bits , but also gives a far better psnr than that in classical lsb technique .",
    "+    the generalized fibonacci - p - sequence ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) is given by ,    @xmath1    for @xmath2 , we have , @xmath3    we get the classical fibonacci sequence @xmath4 .",
    "we already have some results for this classical fibonacci sequence , e.g. , we know the ratio of two consecutive terms in fibonacci sequence converge to golden ratio , @xmath5 . in this paper , we show that @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the positive root of @xmath8 .",
    "the ratio of two consecutive terms in fibonacci - p - sequence converges to this @xmath7 .",
    "in this section we prove the upper and lower bounds for the generalized fibonacci - p - sequence .",
    "first , we show that the ratio of consecutive terms of generalized fibonacci - p - sequence converges to the positive root of the polynomial @xmath9 .",
    "next we use this root to prove a bound on the generalized fibonacci - p - sequence .",
    "the ratio of two consecutive numbers in generalized fibonacci p - sequence converges to the positive root of the degree-@xmath0 polynomial @xmath10 .",
    "[ [ sec : proof ] ] proof : + + + + + +      let us first define the ratio of two consecutive terms of fibonacci - p - sequence as a sequence @xmath11 .",
    "+ now , by definition of fibonacci - p - sequence , we have @xmath12    we observe that the sequence @xmath13 is bounded and hence by monotone convergence theorem must have a convergent subsequence .",
    "for instance , for @xmath2 ( classical fibonacci sequence ) , we have two convergent subsequences @xmath14 ( increasing ) and @xmath15 ( decreasing ) , @xmath16 ( natural number ) and they both converge to the same limit @xmath17 @xcite , as shown in figure 2 .",
    "now , let s analyze the polynomial function @xmath19 . by descartes rule",
    ", the polynomial can have at most one positive real root , since it has exactly one change in sign .",
    "+ first we observe that the function @xmath20 is continuous and differentiable everywhere .",
    "we also notice that the function has exactly one positive root @xmath7 ( and @xmath7 is also strictly larger than 1 ) .",
    "this is a consequence of elementary calculus . by successive differentiation",

    "* @xmath25 .",
    "* by 2nd order sufficient condition for local minima , @xmath20 has a ( local ) minima at @xmath24 .",
    "* at @xmath23 , the function will have a maxima or a point of inflection depending on whether @xmath0 is odd or even , explained in the next section .",
    "when @xmath26 , we have ,    @xmath27 + hence the function is decreasing in @xmath28 and increasing in @xmath29 . also , @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 . at @xmath33 , @xmath20 has a minima ( gradient changes from @xmath34 to @xmath35 ) but at @xmath23 ( no sign change in gradient ) we have a point of inflection .",
    "again , @xmath20 being a continuous function assumes all possible values within an interval . combining all these , we can easily see that the graph of the function has exactly two real zeroes , one positive and the other negative ( the remaining roots are complex conjugate pairs ) .",
    "+ when @xmath36 , we have ,    @xmath37 + hence the function is increasing in @xmath38 , then decreasing in @xmath39 and again increasing in @xmath40 . also , @xmath41 and @xmath42 . at @xmath43",

    "data hiding is a new kind of secret communication technology , where message is hidden inside an image or any other medium , so that it can not be observed .",
    "one of the simplest data hiding technique is lsb data hiding technique , which merely embeds secret message - bits in a subset of the lsb planes of the image .",
    "one of the drawbacks of this technique is : as soon as we go from lsb to msb for selection of bit - planes for our message embedding , the distortion in stego - image is likely to increase exponentially , so it becomes impossible ( without noticeable distortion and with exponentially increasing distance from cover - image and stego - image ) to use higher bit - planes for embedding without any further processing .",
    "this particular problem was addressed by battisti _",
    ", @xcite , who proposed to use generalized fibonacci - p - sequence decomposition technique instead of classical binary decomposition and shows by empirical results that this technique outperforms the classical lsb technique when thought in terms of embedding in the higher bit plane as well with less distortion .",
    "this technique basically increases the number of bit - planes ( by generating a new larger set of bit - planes that we call virtual bit - planes ) by using fibonacci - p - sequence decomposition .",
    "it can be further improved using prime and natural number decomposition techniques as shown in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "also , @xcite @xcite illustrates fibonacci sequence can be used in various applications .    in this paper",
    "we give a formal proof of fibonacci - p - sequence bounds and show how this can be used to theoretically prove that fibonacci - p - sequence decomposition gives better result in hiding data . from ( [ bounds : ] ) it is clear ( from the upper bound ) that the same value will require more numbers of bits to be represented than the number of bits required in classical binary decomposition ( since @xmath111 ) , if it s expressed using fibonacci - p - sequence decomposition ( where the radix is fibonacci - p - sequence numbers instead of powers of @xmath112 ) . + as illustrated in @xcite , in order to measure the distortion in the stego - image",
    ", we use mean square error ( mse ) , worst case mean square error ( wmse ) and peak signal to noise ratio ( psnr ) , which are defined by @xmath113 @xcite . if the secret data - bit is embedded in the @xmath114 bit - plane of a pixel , the worst - case error - square - per - pixel will be @xmath115 ( here @xmath116 represents the corresponding weight in the number system for the @xmath114 bit , e.g. , for classical decomposition @xmath117 , for generalized fibonacci decomposition @xmath118 ) , corresponding to the case when the corresponding bit in cover - image toggles in stego - image , after embedding the secret data - bit . for example , worst - case error - square - per - pixel for embedding a secret data - bit in the ith bit plane in case of a pixel in classical binary decomposition is @xmath119 , where @xmath120 . if the original @xmath121-bit grayscale cover - image has size @xmath122 , we define , @xmath123 @xcite .",
    "hence ,    wmse after embedding secret message bit only in the @xmath124 ( virtual ) bit - plane of each pixel in case of classical ( traditional ) binary ( lsb ) data hiding technique is given by , @xmath125    wmse after embedding secret message bit in the @xmath124 ( virtual ) bit - plane of each pixel in case of generalized fibonacci decomposition is given by ,    @xmath126    hence , we have , @xmath127    thus , we have first proved bounds on the generalized fibonacci sequence and then by using our bounds , we have given a formal proof for better performance ( in terms of psnr ) for lsb data hiding technique using generalized fibonacci - p - sequence decomposition than that using classical binary decomposition . also , we have , @xmath128 ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite )",
    "the above implies that if the same number is represented using prime decomposition ( @xmath129 prime number as weightage to @xmath129 bit ) , it will give still more numbers of virtual bit planes @xcite .",
    "we have similar results for lsb data hiding using natural number decomposition technique , and combining the results ( from @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) we have the following , @xmath130    hence , data hiding using natural number decomposition gives the best performance among the above mentioned techniques .",
    "in data hiding , we hide data in different bit - planes of a pixel . in classical lsb data - hiding technique",
    "the pixel is represented as binary value , hence it has less numbers of bit - planes as we have in case of fibonacci - p - sequence decomposition , the later having still less number of bit - planes than in case of prime decomposition technique .",
    "it is shown in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite by calculation of wmse and psnr measures that embedding data even in higher bit - planes of pixel using these techniques results in less visible distortion of the cover image , since the distortion as measured by wmse is proportional to the square of the weights to the bits in the corresponding decomposition , hence it decreases as the weights go on decreasing from classical binary to generalized fibonacci and from that to prime and natural number decomposition @xcite .",
    "in this paper , we have established the bounds for generalized fibonacci - sequence @xmath131 .",
    "empirical results obtained vindicates our theoretically - proven bounds",
    ". then we used the result @xmath132 , where @xmath7 is the positive root of @xmath8 , to prove that data hiding technique using generalized fibonacci - p - sequence gives more embeddable bit - planes along with better psnr than that in case of classical lsb technique @xcite , and the same using prime decomposition technique increases virtual bit - planes and psnr further @xcite .",
