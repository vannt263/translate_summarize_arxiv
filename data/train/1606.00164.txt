    "almgren proposed varifold as a generalized manifold in @xcite and allard established a number of fundamental properties of varifold such as rectifiability , compactness and regularity theorems in @xcite .",
    "one of the key tools to analyze the local properties of varifold is the monotonicity formula ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 5 ) , which gives a good control of measure whenever the first variation is well - behaved .",
    "when a varifold has a `` boundary '' in a suitable sense , one expects to have a modified monotonicity formula under a suitable set of assumptions . loosely speaking , with prescribed @xmath1 boundary ( which one may regard as `` dirichlet boundary condtion '' ) ,",
    "allard obtained a monotonicity formula at the boundary @xcite as well as the regularity theorem up to the boundary .",
    "the result is improved recently by bourni to @xmath2 boundary @xcite .",
    "for neumann boundary condition , which corresponds roughly to the prescribed right angle condition , grter and jost @xcite derived a monotonicity formula by using a reflection technique and obtained the regularity theorem up to the boundary .",
    "as a further inquiry , it is natural to extend the neumann boundary condition to more general fixed contact angle condition .",
    "the condition arises naturally in various capillarity and free boundary problems , where the boundary of domain under consideration has non - trivial amount of surface energy . for such problem , taylor @xcite established the boundary regularity for area minimizing surfaces .",
    "more recently , de philippis and maggi @xcite proved the boundary regularity for minimizers of anisotropic surface energy . for minimizing problems , one does not necessarily need a monotonicity type formula since one can obtain upper and lower energy density ratio bounds by some energy comparison argument .",
    "here , motivated by the dynamical problem such as the mean curvature flow , we would like to investigate the notion of fixed contact angle condition for general varifolds which do not necessarily correspond to energy minimizing case .",
    "as far as we know , this aspect has not been studied in a general setting of varifold so far .    in this paper , we introduce a notion of contact angle condition for general varifolds . our condition is satisfied for smooth hypersurface having a fixed contact angle with the boundary of domain under consideration .",
    "it is stated in terms of the first variation of varifolds and generalized mean curvature vectors , and such condition is satisfied for a limit of diffused interface problem ( @xcite ) . with a natural integrability condition on the generalized mean curvature vector , we prove that a modified monotonicity formula holds .",
    "the results are natural generalizations of those for the neumann boundary condition considered by grter - jost @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section [ sec : not ] lists notation and recalls some well - known results from geometric measure theory . in section [ sec : as ] , we state the definition of fixed contact angle condition and discuss the implications such as the monotonicity formula . in section [ sec :",
