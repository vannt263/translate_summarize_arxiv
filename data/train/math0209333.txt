    "this note is a write - up of talks given at the workshop `` vertex operator algebras in mathematics and physics '' at the fields institute in toronto in october 2000 and at some other occasions before .",
    "its purpose is to explain how results in low dimensional quantum field theory obtained from different perspectives and with different motivations can be put into a uniform picture by generalizing the notions of discriminant forms and genera from integral quadratic forms to vertex operator algebras , indicating a rich underlying arithmetical theory .",
    "the relation between two - dimensional conformal field theory and three - dimensional topological quantum field theory has been quite known from the beginning .",
    "for example , witten relates in his well - known paper  @xcite the wess - zumino - witten models with chern - simons theories and the jones polynomial of knots .",
    "the basic idea is to use the monodromy properties of correlation functions on surfaces to obtain invariants for knots and three - dimensional manifolds .",
    "being not overly precise , one can say that a quantum field theory is a functor from some bordism category of oriented manifolds to some category of linear spaces satisfying some basic gluing axioms .",
    "@xmath0    @xmath1      @xmath2    @xmath3    @xmath4    for two - dimensional conformal field theories , one takes two - dimensional surfaces with a conformal structure on it and one is forced to take infinite dimensional linear spaces .",
    "using instead riemannian surfaces ( which have a naturally defined conformal structure ) , one reaches the more restricted but essential notion of chiral algebras . for three - dimensional topological quantum field theories ( 3d - tqfts ) ,",
    "one takes three - dimensional topological manifolds ( together with extra structures like framed links ) and only finite dimensional linear spaces .",
    "it took some time before precise and efficient mathematical formulations for both structures , originating partly from physics , emerged .",
    "chiral algebras have been axiomatized by the algebraic structure of _ vertex algebras _ ; see  @xcite for some approaches .",
    "3d - tqfts can be constructed from _",
    "modular braided tensor categories _ ; see  @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we will restrict ourselves mainly to vertex operator algebras ( voas ) ; these are vertex algebras which have a virasoro element and we assume that they are non - negatively graded ; we consider only simple and rational voas and we make some further strong assumptions .",
    "there are many different kinds of examples of voas known , but it is quite unclear yet how a general structure theory for them may look like .    an important class of voas can be constructed from positive definite even integral lattices . for integral lattices ,",
    "there is a deeply developed structure theory available leading to invariants like rational equivalence , the genus , or the spinor genus .",
    "the first purpose of this paper is to explain how the notion of the _ genus _ can be generalized in a natural way from lattices to voas by using modular braided tensor categories so that the definition is compatible with the notion of the genus for lattices .",
    "secondly , we show that new voas can be constructed from given ones only by using the associated modular braided tensor category , generalizing thereby the well - known discriminant technique of quadratic form theory ; cf .",
    "@xcite .",
    "it should be mentioned that there are papers , which do not distinguish between voas and the associated modular braided tensor category . usually , the authors make assumption  [ hauptvermutung ] given below and work in the setting of 3d - tqfts .",
    "the example of the lattice voas associated to the two positive definite even unimodular lattices @xmath5 and @xmath6 in dimension @xmath7  @xcite shows that there are different voas which can lead to the same 3d - tqft and which have the same central charge .    the paper is organized as follows . in the second section ,",
    "some basic definitions and results from the theory of integral quadratic forms are recalled . in section three",
    ", we define the genus of a vertex operator algebra and try to formulate theorems or at least conjectures analogous to the ones known for quadratic forms . in the final section ,",
    "we reformulate the extension problem for vertex operator algebras in terms of the associated modular braided tensor category as already outlined in my paper  @xcite .",
    "this extension problem can be considered as a kind of problem in coding theory over 3d - tqfts .",
    "the solution for voas defining an abelian intertwining algebra is given .",
    "also , complete results for self - dual framed voas or , equivalently , self - dual codes over the 3d - tqft associated to the ising model , are presented .",
    "there are many open problems about the structure of vertex algebras compared to what is known for quadratic forms .",
    "but the theory of quadratic forms is more than two hundred years old .",
    "it seems to me that from the fifteen years old theory of vertex algebras we can see only the tip of the iceberg of such a structure theory .",
    "i like to thank the organizers of the conference for inviting me to the fields institute and for the possibility to present these ideas .",
    "i am grateful to markus rosellen for his comments on an early version of the paper and for discussions about abelian intertwining algebras as well as to geoffrey mason for reminding me of some references .",
    "i also like to thank jim lepowsky and the referee for their many valuable suggestions .",
    "finally , my thanks goes to supun koranasophonpun for proofreading the manuscript .",
    "we collect some results from the arithmetic of integral quadratic forms .",
    "the theory of genera for binary forms was developed by gau  in  @xcite . instead of the more classical notion of quadratic forms in coordinates ,",
    "we use the language of lattices .    we denote in this section by @xmath8 the additive group of the integers modulo  @xmath9 and by @xmath10 the ring of @xmath11-adic integers .",
    "recall that a map @xmath12 from an abelian group @xmath13 into an additively written group @xmath14 is called a quadratic form if the expression @xmath15 is additive in @xmath16 and in @xmath17 , i.e. , bilinear .     a _ finite quadratic space _",

    "furthermore , one can deduce that two lattices @xmath47 and @xmath87 are in the same genus if and only if @xmath94 and @xmath95 are isomorphic .",
