    "with advancements in digital electronics , the principles of holography @xcite continue to be utilized for new approaches to imaging and diffractive control of optical fields . in digital holography ( dh ) , an imaging sensor and computer record the hologram and image reconstruction is accomplished via digital processing techniques to present high resolution digital images.@xcite in computer - generated holography ( cgh ) , a hologram function can be generated computationally and then displayed via digital printing , photolithography or display - based technologies.@xcite a 2006 special issue of _ applied optics _ presents an overview of recent advances in dh and cgh as applied to microscopy , optical trapping and tweezing , interferometry , data recording , beam shaping , and metrology.@xcite    there has been considerable interest recently in the generation of azimuthal phase functions associated with photon orbital angular momentum ( oam ) for high - dimensional quantum key distribution ( qkd).@xcite the complex fields associated with these functions are of the form @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the azimuthal coordinate .",
    "the integer @xmath3 denotes the photon orbital angular momentum in units of planck s constant over the range @xmath4 .",
    "while the conventional bb84 protocol for qkd @xcite is based upon photon spin angular momentum and utilizes two polarization bases ( e.g. the horizontal and diagonal bases ) , extensions of this protocol to higher dimensions is possible.@xcite whether in two dimensions or higher dimensions , secure transmission of quantum keys is ensured by the use of mutually unbiased bases ( mubs).@xcite the states associated with each mub are equally weighted superpositions of the states associated with the other bases .",
    "the measurement of a single photon s state with an incorrect choice of basis results in an unbiased , or meaningless , probabilistic outcome . preserving this essential feature of the bb84 protocol while implementing qkd with higher dimensional oam hilbert spaces , requires one to generate and discriminate each state in each of the mubs associated with oam .",
    "these oam mub states correspond to optical fields that are modulated in both phase and amplitude .",
    "recent demonstrations5 of the generation of photon oam have utilized high - resolution programmable optical path modulators to impart the azimuthal phase dependence of the pure states onto optical wavefronts . for values of @xmath5 , the limited range of these spatial light modulators ( slms )",
    "requires that the optical phase function be introduced modulo @xmath0 .",
    "assuming monochromatic conditions and adhering to the sign conventions of goodman @xcite wherein a positive optical phase delay introduces a negative phase error , the complex transmittance associated with an optical phase delay function @xmath6 introduced modulo @xmath0 can be shown to be @xcite-@xcite @xmath7 where @xmath8 is an integer and the sinc function is used according to the convention @xmath9 .",
    "the amplitude diffraction efficiency , given by the sinc function , is spatially uniform and unity for @xmath10 and zero otherwise .",
    "while modulo @xmath0 optical phase control is well suited to creating the azimuthal phases associated with the pure states with high diffraction efficiency , the diffractive optics function is calculated without the benefit of a reference wave to encode amplitude information .",
    "methods for computing hologram functions that give rise to complex field modulation include both analytic and numerical techniques .",
    "historically , the simplicity of fabricating binary holograms motivated the development of numerical techniques for calculating and optimizing the binary hologram function.@xcite recent developments in slm technologies allow analytic hologram functions to be displayed in real time with megapixel spatial resolution and @xmath11-bit phase resolution .",

    "@xcite defines a useful approach to cgh with slm technologies providing both phase and amplitude modulation of the diffracted field and allowing separation of the diffracted orders .",
    "this approach also allows the hologram transmittance and the complex fields associated with the diffracted orders to be expressed analytically for purpose of analysis .    while photon polarization supports qkd in a @xmath12-dimensional hilbert space , in this paper we present a description of oam mubs for a three - dimensional hilbert space and consider the implications of generating these quantum states via cgh with slm technology . while our analysis is valid for higher dimensional qkd , we present this next - higher dimensional generalization for clarity . toward this end ,",
    "the complex transmittance associated with the leith - upatnieks approach to recording thin phase holograms is reviewed and evaluated for the case of holographic generation of a mub state .",
    "artifacts in the holographically generated complex field are discussed and their effects on a qkd system quantified by calculating the weighted inner product of the holographically generated field with the theoretical mub field . through preconditioning the cgh function ,",
    "these artifacts are eliminated .",
    "finally , a demonstration is presented in which an extended graphics array ( xga ) format liquid - crystal - on - silicon ( lcos ) slm is utilized to holographically generate an optical field associated with a three - dimensional oam mub state .",
    "a 3-dimensional hilbert space admits a maximum of four mubs .",
    "each of these bases is , by definition , orthonormal and contains three basis vectors .",
    "we may freely choose as one of these bases , designated @xmath13 , the three pure oam states corresponding to an angular momentum , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , and @xmath16 , where @xmath17 . to further reinforce the vector nature of these states ,",
    "we utilize dirac s ket notation @xcite to provide an abstract description of each of these three basis vectors in this mub . @xmath18 these three ket vectors are orthogonal , providing @xmath19 , and span the @xmath20-dimensional hilbert space .",

    "<S> there has been considerable interest recently in the generation of azimuthal phase functions associated with photon orbital angular momentum ( oam ) for high - dimensional quantum key distribution ( qkd ) . </S>",
    "<S> the generation of secure quantum keys requires not only this pure phase basis , but also additional bases comprised of orthonormal superposition states formed from the pure states . </S>",
    "<S> these bases are also known as mutually unbiased bases ( mubs ) and include quantum states whose wave functions are modulated in both phase and amplitude . while modulo @xmath0 optical path control with high - resolution spatial light modulators ( slms ) is well suited to creating the azimuthal phases associated with the pure states , it does not introduce the amplitude modulation associated with the mub superposition states . using computer - generated holography ( cgh ) with the leith - upatnieks approach to hologram recording </S>",
    "<S> however , both phase and amplitude modulation can be achieved . </S>",
    "<S> this paper presents a description of the oam states of a 3-dimensional mub system and analyzes the construction of these states via cgh with a phase modulating slm . </S>",
    "<S> the effects of phase holography artifacts on quantum - state generation are quantified and a prescription for avoiding these artifacts by preconditioning the hologram function is presented . </S>",
    "<S> practical effects associated with spatially isolating the first - order diffracted field are also quantified and a demonstration utilizing a liquid crystal slm is presented . </S>"
