    "as a consequence of photon number conservation , the cross - kerr interaction offers an ideal playground for quantum state engineering , and a number of applications have been studied , such as quantum non - demolition measurement , quantum state preparation and detection , quantum teleportation , and the implementation of quantum logic gates .",
    "the following examples reflect this variety of fields touched upon .",
    "a theoretical study of quantum non - demolition measurement of the photon number of two optical modes based on cross - kerr couplers in combination with a mach - zehnder - interferometer is carried out in @xcite . in @xcite , an experimental review with emphasis on back - action evading measurements on optical soliton pulses propagating in fibers",
    "the preparation of schrdinger cat - like states by employing the cross - kerr interaction in conditional measurement is discussed in @xcite , including a study of the effect of damping . in @xcite ,",
    "the use of a ring cavity equipped with a cross - kerr element and an on / off - detector with arbitrary efficiency is proposed to project a desired fock state out of a coherent state , and in @xcite a chain of such ring cavities is used to measure the photon number statistics of a signal . in @xcite , a realization of a bell state measurement based on the cross - kerr interaction is suggested and its application to teleporting the polarization state of a photon investigated . in @xcite , a fibre - optic non - linear sagnac interferometer working as an optical switch is analysed and its application as an optical regenerator examined .",
    "the implementation of a quantum phase gate operating on two polarization qubits is considered in @xcite .",
    "entanglement purification generating maximally entangled states from gaussian continuous entangled states by applying cross - kerr interactions in conditional measurement is studied in @xcite .    within classical optics ,",
    "the cross - kerr interaction is described as a third - order deviation from linearity of the polarization induced in a medium by an electric field , so that strong fields are expected to be required for its observation . in contrast , setups discussed within quantum optics and quantum information processing often operate with superpositions of low - excited fock states .",
    "an enhancement of the `` classical '' nonlinearity is therefore required for its applicability in the domain of weak fields .",
    "quantum effects such as electromagnetically induced transparency could offer a way to realize this enhancement @xcite-@xcite .",
    "an alternative are proposals entirely based on the nonlinearity hidden in the quantum measurement process @xcite .    in the present article",
    "we assume an interaction of the form @xmath1 with and show that it can be used , in combination with beam splitter arrays and on / off - detectors , to convert @xmath0-photon truncated single - mode quantum states into ( @xmath0 + 1)-mode single - photon states and vice versa .",
    "such a converter offers novel possibilities of arbitrary single - mode quantum state engineering . as potential applications",
    ", we consider the realization of unitary and non - unitary operators , overlap measurements with orthogonal and non - orthogonal sets of states @xcite , and quantum telemanipulation . in general",
    ", it should be noted that finite dimensional quantum systems play an important role in the study of basic quantum state engineering and detection techniques @xcite-@xcite .",
    "an on / off - detector is a photodetector able to distinguish between presence and absence of photons and may be realized by an avalanche - triggering photodiode .",
    "since the total photon number of single - photon states is one , the detection of presence of photons can be done with any ( non - zero ) quantum detection efficiency . placing emphasis on the main principle",
    ", we will however assume unit detection efficiency throughout the work .",
    "the article is organized as follows . after introducing quantum state conversion in section  [ sec2 ] ,",
    "a proposal of its practical implementation is made in section  [ sec3 ] .",
    "application to quantum - state engineering is considered in section  [ sec4 ] .",
    "sections [ sec5 ] and [ sec6 ] are devoted to applications to quantum - state measurement and quantum telemanipulation respectively .",
    "finally , a summary and some concluding remarks are given in section  [ sec7 ] .",
    "let @xmath2 be an arbitrary quantum state in a source hilbert space and @xmath3 the operator that , as a result of a measurement with outcome @xmath4 , converts @xmath2 into a state in an isomorphic target hilbert space according to @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the corresponding success probability , and the operators @xmath7 must resolve the identity in the source space , .    in what follows we restrict our attention to the source space @xmath8 spanned by the @xmath9-photon single - mode states , where , and the target space @xmath10 spanned by the ( @xmath0 + 1)-mode single - photon states defined by .",
    "isomorphic mapping can be realized if @xmath11 each state @xmath12 in @xmath8 and each operator @xmath13 acting on a state in @xmath8 can then be related to their counterparts @xmath14 and @xmath15 in @xmath10 , respectively , according to @xmath16 @xmath17 and vice versa .",
    "it is well known @xcite that by combining u(2)-beam splitters to an array one can construct a 2(@xmath0 + 1)-port which may be described by a transformation operator @xmath18 obeying @xmath19 where the @xmath20 @xmath21 @xmath22 can form any u(@xmath0 + 1)-group matrix . in @xmath10 ,",
    "@xmath18 acts therefore as an arbitrary unitary operator @xmath23 moreover , measurement - assisted state preparation in @xmath10 only requires on / off - detectors , which suggests that quantum - state engineering may be easier in @xmath10 than in @xmath8 . in order to subject a state in @xmath8 to a desired transformation",

    "bob is left with `` white noise '' if alice refuses to communicate with him .      until now",
    ", we have assumed that alice sends a classical trigger bit to bob in case she has detected photon presence in channel @xmath57 as well as a given value of the phase @xmath88 defined by the construction of the entangled state source and bob then opens the shutter s. consider now an alternative situation in which , after detection of photon presence in some channel @xmath76 , alice uses the classical channel to tell bob the respective channel number @xmath9 and phase value @xmath70 measured .",
    "( [ ytelaa ] ) is then generalized to @xmath222 where @xmath223 @xmath21 @xmath224 depends on the values @xmath9 and @xmath70 detected . on bob s side , the shutter s is replaced with state converters described in section ( [ sec3.2 ] ) .",
    "bob uses these to convert his respective output state @xmath85 into its multi - mode counterpart , to which a unitary transformation @xmath225 is applied by means of a beam splitter array , and eventually the transformed state is converted back into its single - mode counterpart . in order to describe the transformation of alice s state @xmath2 into bob s modified state @xmath226 according to ( [ yomega ] ) , we use in place of ( [ ytelaak ] ) an effective transformation operator @xmath227 which depends on @xmath9 and @xmath70 if @xmath228 $ ] @xmath78 @xmath229 .",
    "in particular , if the beam splitters in dashed parentheses in figure  [ fig4 ] are removed , @xmath127 , then at each trial , one of the on / off - detectors d clicks , @xmath128 . a well known example is the unconditional teleportation , which is achieved by removing also the beam splitter array @xmath18 , so that ( [ yteleffaa ] ) reduces to @xmath230 @xmath21 @xmath231 .",
    "we have suggested a cross - kerr interaction based device allowing conversion between single - mode states truncated at some photon number @xmath0 and ( @xmath0 + 1)-mode states whose total photon number is one . as possible applications with regard to single - mode states , we have considered the implementation of unitary and non - unitary transformations , overlap measurements with orthogonal and non - orthogonal sets of states , and telemanipulation .    throughout the work we have distinguished between a conditional and an unconditional mode of operation . whereas the unconditional mode is based on detection and preparation of pegg  barnett phase states",
    ", the conditional mode may apply arbitrary states with non - zero fock expansion coefficients .",
    "for example , if the outgoing @xmath47-mode of device @xmath41 in figure  [ fig2](a ) passes a separate ( highly transmittive ) beam splitter , whose second input port is prepared in a ( strong ) coherent state , then detection of photon absence in the first output port of this beam splitter by means of an on / off - detector approximates the detection of a truncated coherent state , since the incoming @xmath47-mode of device @xmath41 is by definition prepared in a photon number truncated state . within our work ,",
    "attention has however been limited to pegg  barnett states ( as well as lossless devices and perfect mode - matching ) , thus allowing a unified depiction of the principle .",
