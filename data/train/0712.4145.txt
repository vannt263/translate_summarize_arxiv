    "low - redshift quasars are often surrounded by massive ionized nebulae showing filamentary structures on scales of a few tens of kpcs . more specifically , about 40% of the quasars at @xmath6 that are also steep - spectrum ( i.e. ,  usually frii type ) radio sources show such extended emission - line regions ( eelrs ) with an [ oiii]@xmath7 luminosity greater than @xmath8 erg s@xmath9 . here",
    "we will focus our discussion on these steep - radio - spectrum quasars , because ( 1 ) they are possibly the counterparts of frii radio galaxies like 3c79 , and ( 2 ) the presence of a powerful radio jet seems to be a necessary ( though not sufficient ) condition for producing a luminous eelr , as implied by the correlation between radio spectral index and extended optical emission @xcite .",
    "an eelr typically has a mass of @xmath10 @xmath4 , displays globally disordered kinematics , and shows a complex morphology that bears no obvious relationships ether with the host galaxy or with the extended radio structure ( @xcite ; see @xcite for a review ) . in terms of quasar luminosity , host galaxy luminosity , and black hole mass ,",
    "the quasars that show eelrs ( hereafter the  eelr quasars \" ) do not differ significantly from non - eelr quasars .",
    "but the former are all low - metallicity quasars .",
    "the gas metallicity in their broad - line regions ( blrs ) is significantly lower ( @xmath11 0.6 @xmath2 ) than that of non - eelr quasars ( @xmath12 @xmath2 ) @xcite .",
    "although this gas - phase metallicity is unexpectedly low for galaxies with the masses found for these quasar hosts , it is consistent with that in their eelrs . combining all of the pieces together ,",
    "the most likely scenario for the origin of an eelr is that it comprises gas that is native to a gas - rich galaxy that merged with the quasar host and triggered the quasar activity , after which a large fraction of the gas was impulsively swept out by a large - solid - angle blast wave ( i.e. ,  a superwind ) , in a manner similar to that envisioned for quasar - mode feedback in the early universe ( e.g.,@xcite ) .",

    "we first binned the data cubes along the wavelength direction to increase the s / n ratio of the host galaxy ; then the centroid of the galaxy was measured for each bin , and a polynomial was fit to the ( x , y ) coordinates , restricted by the fact that dar only causes the centroids to vary along a straight line in ( x , y ) plane ( at the parallactic angle ) ; finally we shifted the image slices at each wavelength using the solution from the polynomial fit .",
    "the three data cubes were then combined and binned to 02 pixels , the original spatial sampling of the ifu fiber - lenslet system , to form the final data cube .",

    "background sky was removed by fitting low - order cubic splines to the regions on each side of the object along the slit direction using background .",
    "one - dimensional spectra of 3c79 were first extracted with a wide ( 11 ) aperture , and they were flux - calibrated and corrected for atmospheric absorption using the spectrophotometric standard wolf1346 ( taken 5 min after the nautical twilight earlier in the night ) .",
    "the calibrated spectra from the two arms agree perfectly in their overlapping region .",
    "then , one - dimensional spectra of high s / n ratio were obtained by using a 2  extraction aperture .",
    "these spectra were multiplied by appropriate smooth curves so that their continua match those of the wide - aperture spectra . finally , the blue and the red sides , after flux calibration and atmospheric absorption correction , were joined and binned to a common linear dispersion ( 1.86   per pixel ) using scombine .",

    "uncertainties of the line fluxes from this fit tend to be low as the wavelengths are no longer free parameters . lifting this wavelength constraint",

    "now we re - emphasize this point by comparing strong line ratios of the eelrs of the radio galaxy 3c79 and the quasars 3c249.1 and 4c37.43 with emission - line galaxies at a similar redshift range .",
    "the sloan digital sky survey data release 4 ( sdss dr4 ) provides high - quality optical spectra for a large number of galaxies .",
    "the emission - line fluxes after correcting for stellar absorption and foreground extinction are publicly available .",

    ", we can now estimate the metallicity of the gas using photoionization models . in the following",
    "we will compare our data with the dusty radiation - pressure dominated photoionization models of @xcite with a density of 1000 @xmath73 .",
    "since the diagnostic line ratios we will use are almost entirely dependent on the abundances , models adopting a different density will not change our results .    as the metallicity of a photoionized nebula increases , the temperature of the nebula decreases ( as a result of the increased metal cooling ) , and the relative strengths between hydrogen lines and lines from other heavier elements also decreases ( due to the increased abundance of the heavy elements relative to hydrogen ) .",
    "the latter effect is especially strong for nitrogen lines since the element is dominated by  secondary \" production at @xmath90 0.2 @xmath2 .",
    "hence , n abundance increases at a much faster rate with metallicity , i.e. ,  n / h @xmath91 . in figure  [ fig : z]_a _ we use the temperature sensitive [ oiii]@xmath92 ratio to demonstrate the dependance of nebula temperature on metallicity .",
    "the stratification among the grids of different metallicities is further improved by the fact that helium increases linearly with metallicity relative to hydrogen @xcite . in fig .  [",

    ", we show models spanning a range of ionization parameters ( @xmath94 log(@xmath95 ) @xmath45 0 ) and four power - law indices from @xmath96 to @xmath97 , representing the quasar ionizing continuum ( @xmath98 ) .",
    "we have converted the modeled total metallicities to gas - phase metallicities using the solar abundances defined by @xcite ( 12+log(o / h)@xmath99 = 8.93 and @xmath2  = 0.02 ) , in order to be consistent with both previous studies on the metallicity of quasar blrs and metallicity results from stellar populations (   [ sec : spop ] ) .",
    "one solar metallicity in @xcite corresponds to 1/3 @xmath2  in our figures , since approximately half of the metals are assumed to be depleted onto dust in the models , and their assumed solar metallicity is about 0.2 dex0.2 dex lower than those in @xcite .",
    "hence , the mass fraction of metals ( i.e. @xmath46 ) is about 1.5 times lower  @xmath2  = 0.013  than that of @xcite . ] lower than that of @xcite .    as can be seen in figs .",
    "[ fig : z ] & [ fig : n2 ] , the line - ratios of the eelr as well as the nlr of 3c79 , like those quasar eelrs and their blrs , are most consistent with a low - metallicity at about 1/3 to 2/3 solar .",
    "[ fig : n2 ] illustrates the peculiarity of 3c79 more clearly by comparing it directly with sdss agn on the same line - ratio diagnostic .",
    "the nuclear nlr along with the two other regions where we have [ nii ]  measurements all lie on the lower metallicity side of the main seyfert branch , overlapping with quasar eelrs .",
    "this result supports the orientation - based unification schemes of frii radio galaxies and radio - loud quasars @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", 3c79 offers yet another example strengthening ( 1 ) the correlation between the presence of eelrs and the metallicity of the nuclear gas ( blrs and/or nlrs ) , and ( 2 ) the similar metallicity in eelrs and the gas in the nuclear region .",
    "both correlations were initially discovered only among steep - spectrum radio - loud quasars @xcite .",
    "the great majority of quasars show super - solar metallicities in their nuclear regions ( see * ? ? ? * for a recent review ) ; yet , as we have previously shown @xcite , quasars with luminous eelrs are drawn exclusively from the subset of steep - radio - spectrum quasars that have blrs with sub - solar metallicities .",
    "the fact that the quasar host galaxies are almost always very massive and thus expected to have high metallicities suggests an external source for the low - metallicity gas .",
    "furthermore , the apparent link between the metallicity of the gas in the blrs and the metallicity of the gas in the eelrs , which have minimum masses of @xmath100 @xmath4 , means that the external source of the gas must itself have been moderately massive .    in 3c79",
    ", we have an frii radio galaxy that shows the same pattern .",
    "although we of course can not obtain a broad - line - region metallicity in this case , we have used the unresolved nuclear narrow - line region metallicity as a surrogate . aside from providing a consistency check on unified models for frii radio galaxies and quasars , the main question of interest is whether the clearer view of the inner region of the host galaxy gives us any insight into the origin of the low - metallicity gas and the mechanism that produced the eelr .",
    "the host galaxy of 3c79 appears to be a fairly normal elliptical morphologically .",
    "the most intriguing feature in the inner region is the extremely compact galaxy 08 from the center of the host galaxy .",
    "the nearly exponential profile of this galaxy suggests that it could be a tidally stripped `` pseudobulge '' of a late - type galaxy ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; the interstellar medium of such a galaxy would be quite plausible as a source for the low - metallicity gas in 3c79 .",
    "we have suggested elsewhere @xcite that luminous eelrs may result from nearly spherical blast waves connected with the initiation of frii radio jets .",
    "the connection with low - metallicity gas is less clear , although we can speculate that it may have something to do with the lower radiative coupling such gas would have to the quasar radiation field , allowing more efficient accretion .",
    "it is interesting to note that related considerations have been invoked recently to explain the link between low metallicity and long - duration gamma - ray bursts @xcite on the scale of massive stars , although the physical mechanisms involved are certainly different .",
    "armed with the latest photoionization models , @xcite identified @xmath2240 ( out of @xmath101 ) candidates of low - metallicity seyfert2s in sdss . a caveat to note",
    "is that the authors restricted the sample to galaxies with stellar masses lower than @xmath102 @xmath4   while selecting their candidates , as guided by the mass - metallicity correlation ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "although the eelr quasars are excluded from the sdss emission - line galaxy sample , 3c79 represents a population of low - metallicity agn that were missed by @xcite these agn are hosted by massive evolved galaxies with @xmath103 @xmath4  of stars and harbor @xmath104 @xmath4  black holes at their hearts , and they are likely to be more powerful than the seyfert2s .    by cross - correlating the texas radio galaxies @xcite with sdss dr4 agn , we have identified a sample of low - metallicity radio galaxies . like that of 3c79 ,",
    "the spectra of their host galaxies show red slopes and absorption features that are indicative of an old stellar population .",
    "follow - up high - resolution imaging and spatially resolved spectroscopy of these galaxies and a comparable control sample are needed to finally nail down the source of the low - metallicity gas and the triggering mechanism for quasar superwinds .",
    "in addition , detecting eelrs around these objects would provide a new test for the unification schemes .",
    "based on extensive ground - based spectroscopy and archival _ hst _",
    "wfpc2 images of the radio galaxy 3c79 , we have conducted a detailed analysis of its host galaxy and the eelr .",
    "the host galaxy of 3c79 is a massive elliptical with @xmath105 .",
    "the uv / optical spectral energy distribution of the host galaxy is best described by a combination of an intermediate - age stellar population ( 1.3 gyr ) , an old stellar population ( 10 gyr ) , a power law , and a nebular thermal continuum .",
    "both stellar populations are metal rich ( 2.5 @xmath2 ) .",
    "this best fit model indicates a total stellar mass within one effective radius of approximately @xmath106 @xmath4 , consistent with the virial mass derived from stellar kinematics ( @xmath107 @xmath4 ) .",
    "the eelr of 3c79 is remarkably similar to the most luminous quasar eelrs . the velocity field , although only available in a small area , is locally ordered but globally disordered .",
    "the eelr is almost certainly photoionized by the hidden quasar , and it shows densities of @xmath108 @xmath73  in the [ oii]emitting regions and temperatures around 13,000 k. most interestingly , the metallicity of the gas in both the eelr and the nlr is about 1/3@xmath212/3 solar , matching perfectly the metallicity in both the eelrs and the nuclear blrs of the eelr quasars .",
    "there is a very compact close companion galaxy 3.3 kpc from and 4 magnitudes fainter than the host galaxy .",
    "this companion galaxy shows an exponential profile , and is presumably a tidally stripped  pseudobulge \" of a late - type galaxy that might be the source for the low - metallicity gas as well as the starforming regions in 3c79 .",
    "the exact correspondence between this eelr and the eelrs around quasars joins the already overwhelming evidence in support of the unification schemes for frii radio galaxies and radio - loud quasars .",
    "the definitive trait of sub - solar metallicity in the nlr of 3c79 also provides an efficient tool for selecting frii radio galaxies that likely host luminous eelrs .",
