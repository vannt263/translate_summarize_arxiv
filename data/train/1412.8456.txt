    "most groups and clusters of galaxies ( galaxy aggregates ; henceforth gas ) show a central dense , cool core ( cc ) in which the radiative cooling time of the intergalactic medium ( _ i.e. , _ intragroup or intracluster ; henceforth igm ) is shorter than the age of the ga .",

    "the spiral pattern of cfs and the fast flow below them , when combined , indicate the presence of a spiral flow .",
    "note that by spiral flow we refer to a plasma distribution giving rise to spiral features ; lagrangian fluid elements do not necessarily follow spiral trajectories @xcite .",
    "the ubiquity of spiral patterns and cfs suggests that such spiral flows constitute an inherent part of the ga itself .",
    "indeed , a simple spiral flow model reproduces the main thermal features of ccs , such as the density cusp , while avoiding the local thermal instability by advecting heat across and beyond the core .",
    "the model is also consistent with the nearly logarithmic spiral pattern , the properties of the projected cfs , and the fast flow along them ( * ? ? ?",
    "* henceforth ) .",
    "however , the recent evidence for extended , mpc scale spiral patterns suggests that spiral flows are , in fact , a ga - wide phenomenon .",
    "we study the two universal properties of gas discussed above in conjunction , namely a universal power - law entropy , or entropy - like , profile ( henceforth : universal profile ) and an underlying , extended spiral flow , reaching beyond the core .",
    "after evaluating the universal profile and arguing that it is likely to arise from a dynamical mechanism , we point out that a ga - wide spiral flow can naturally explain it , thus linking the two phenomena .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : scaling ] we analyze the entropy profiles of deprojected gas found in the literature .",
    "we also study a different , but nearly indistinguishable measure of the thermal profile , namely the ratio between the cooling and free - fall times . in section [ sec : dynamic ] we argue for a dynamical origin of the universal profile .",
    "we show how it naturally arises in a spiral flow , using two different arguments , in section [ sec : spiral origin ] . in section [ sec : spiral ] we demonstrate this using a third , more rigorous argument . here",

    "the simple power - law function @xmath167 that we find , as shown in equation .   and figure [ fig : universal scaling ] , differs from the results of @xcite in two ways .",
    "first , we find that @xmath4 monotonically decreases toward small radii rather than showing a minimum , probably because we use only deprojected data , adopt a more robust definition of @xmath131 , and avoid a parametric model fit .",
    "this is consistent with the absence of an ` entropy floor ' in our data , in accordance with @xcite .",
    "second , we find a universal behavior for all the gas examined , regardless of the presence of h@xmath168 filaments .",
    "the universality of the thermal profile discussed in section [ sec : scaling ] , its extensive radial span , and its applicability over a wide mass range , place strong constraints on its origin .",
    "as we show , the static models proposed so far seem unable to reproduce the profile without fine tuning .",
    "the entropy seeded by primordial gas crossing the virial shock @xcite would not naturally maintain the same power - law profile down to and beyond the core radius , where cooling plays a significant role on timescales shorter than the age of the ga .",
    "rather , one would expect some break in the profile , unless some additional mechanism compensates for the radiative entropy loss .",
    "whether or not such a mechanism exists , the primordial entropy should scale with the ga mass as @xmath169 , but we find no such correlation ( see figure [ fig : k100 by cluster ] ) .",
    "rather , the power - law index of the @xmath170 correlation has a slightly negative best - fit , is consistent with zero ( @xmath171 ) , and is inconsistent with the predicted self similar value by @xmath172 ( this applies to both sph- and amr - based fits of ; henceforth ) . this result does not change much if the representative entropy is chosen well outside of the core ( _ e.g. , _",
    "@xmath173 at @xmath174 , and @xmath175 at @xmath176 ) . moreover , as noticed previously ( _ e.g. , _ * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the measured value of the entropy lies well above the prediction of the self - similar model , over the entire mass range ( see figure [ fig : k100 by cluster ] ) .",
    "this deviation ranges between @xmath177 and @xmath178 for individual clusters , and is @xmath179 for their mean .",
    "finally , the entropy profile we find is significantly flatter ( by @xmath172 ) than the self - similar @xmath19 , which can be ruled out in our sample . even by using a much smaller radial extent for the fit ( @xmath114{r}_{500}$ ] , similar to ) , the self - similar prediction is still rejected by @xmath180 .",
    "these arguments reject self - similar primordial accretion alone as the origin of the universal profile , and indicate a pervasive baryonic influence reaching out to the virial radius .",
    "another previous suggestion is that the entropy profile is governed by radial heat conduction @xcite .",
    "this mechanism is unlikely to operate in exactly the same fashion on both sides of the temperature peak , where the radial direction of the heat flow is reversed , so again the thermal profile would naturally be broken .",
    "moreover , @xcite showed that in order for conduction to thus explain the ga thermal profile , the heat conductivity should have a fine - tuned , unnatural functional form .",
    "more generally , the igm is a dynamical environment , undergoing merger activity ( _ e.g. , _ * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , susceptible to the significant energy output of the agn ( _ e.g. , _ * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and harboring ongoing shocks ( _ e.g. , _ * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , fast bulk flows @xcite , and turbulence ( _ e.g. , _ * ? ? ?",
    "static models are unlikely to robustly explain the universal profile in such surroundings .",
    "in contrast , a dynamical mechanism , involving gas motions , could have the inertia to resist the turmoil of the igm and stabilize the universal profile .",
    "such a mechanism would have to operate throughout the ga , out to the virial radius , in order to modify the ( mass - correlated ) entropy injected by the virial shock , and to maintain the universal profile .",
    "it would also need to be insensitive to the sign of the radial temperature gradient in order to produce the same profile both inside and outside the core .",
    "if the universal quantity turns out to be @xmath154 , rather than @xmath181 , this would provide a direct indication that the process is dynamic , and is , at least on small scales , driven by gravity .",
    "the length scale @xmath153 emerging from this quantity when applied to gas ( equation  ) would suggest a non - local effect , such as an extended bulk flow emanating from this radius .",
    "as demonstrated by , spiral flows can explain the thermal structure of cores .",
    "it is natural to ask , in light of the spiral features found to extend out nearly to the virial radius , if a spiral flow reaching beyond the core can give rise to the universal profile .",
    "this is crudely examined here , and examined in more detail in the specific context of a two - phase spiral flow model in section [ sec : spiral ] .",
    "consider a two - dimensional spiral flow .",
    "the more complicated , 3d case can be approximated under some assumptions as a superposition of spiral flow planes ( see and section  [ sec : spiral ] below ) .",
    "the spiral flow necessarily involves azimuthal density and temperature gradients , as evidenced by the jumps in @xmath6 and @xmath7 across the spiral cfs . as we show , the universal profile can be recovered by making simple , although ad hoc , assumptions regarding these gradients .",
    "first note that in order to sustain a spiral flow , mild azimuthal pressure gradients are also necessary ( ) .",
    "these can be seen , for example , in figure [ fig : perseuspressure ] , which shows the fractional deviation of the pseudo - pressure @xmath182 from its azimuthal average , in perseus @xcite . in spite of the projection and noise , a spiral structure",
    "is clearly seen .",
    "it is highlighted by the overplotted spiral cf pattern , derived based on thresholding the @xmath106 gradients .",
    "indications for azimuthal pressure gradients are also seen in deprojected pressure profiles of cc gas @xcite .",
    "= 8.4 cm      next , consider the normalized azimuthal derivative @xmath183 of some thermal quantity @xmath184 , and in particular its radial dependence . in general ,",

    "next , consider the spiral structure .",

[ cols=\"<,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     in addition to the more realistic thermal profiles of the generalized model , it also gives a more feasible dynamical structure .",
    "first , the radial decline in the shear and in the velocity of the fast phase , and the rise in the cf contrast are more gradual here , allowing for a more extended structure .",
    "the spiral pattern now scales as the temperature of the slow component , which dominates the flow , @xmath269 .",
    "this corresponds to a purely logarithmic spiral at the edge of the core , becoming slightly archimedean ( hyperbolic ) outside ( inside ) the core .",
    "the perpendicular structure @xmath270 is unchanged by our generalization , giving a prolate ( closer to cylindrical ) structure inside the core . at the larger radii considered here ,",
    "the 3d structure becomes nearly spherical at the edge of the core , and oblate near the virial radius .",
    "although the contrast and shear change more slowly in the generalized model , they do vary significantly over the larger radial span considered .",
    "this may lead to large shear and contrast , in excess of observational constraints , if a spiral pattern is assumed to continuously extend all the way from the inner core ( @xmath271 ) to the ga periphery ( @xmath272 ) , as even a modest ( @xmath273 , say ) cf at @xmath274 would imply an unrealistic , @xmath275 beyond @xmath276 .",
    "this would contradict the @xmath277 contrasts observed at large radii @xcite .",
    "an alternative is that instead of one continuous spiral , the cf is actually intermittent , composed of a series of spiral sections separated by small gaps .",
    "this possibility may be supported by the intermittent spiral patterns and cf gaps , often observed on both small ( _ e.g. , _ * ? ? ? * ) and large scales @xcite .",
    "we study two apparently independent , universal properties of gas : a simple power - law entropy profile extending out to the virial radius , and a ubiquitous underlying spiral pattern , apparently reaching out to the virial radius as well .",
    "we show that the former is mass - independent over a wide mass range , and argue that it reflects a robust dynamical mechanism , regulating the thermal structure of the ga ; models have been unable to naturally reproduce it until now .",
    "the latter reflects a long - lived , extended spiral flow , present in many , if not all , gas .",
    "furthermore , speculating that the two phenomena are related , we demonstrate that an extended spiral flow can naturally explain the universal thermal profile , under simple ( yet somewhat ad hoc ) assumptions regarding its structure .",
    "interestingly , three independent physical arguments lead to approximately the same thermal profile , supporting these assumptions .    to quantify the thermal profile , we analyze 16 deprojected clusters and 12 deprojected groups from the literature ( see table [ table : my data table ] ) , and find a good , nearly linear entropy @xmath0 fit ( see equations  , and figures [ fig : entropy scaling][fig : k100 by cluster ] )",
    "the power - law index , @xmath278 , is consistent with the mean @xmath89 of previous studies , which used slightly different methods ( see table [ table : entropy fits ] ) .",
    "our tight fit is due to the wide mass range , the minimization of projection effects , and an @xmath117 selection of fit data .",
    "a different parameterization , suggested by @xcite , involves the ratio @xmath4 between the cooling and free - fall times .",
    "our data is similarly well - fit by the above @xmath10 , and by the relation ( see equation  [ eq : simple fit ] and figure [ fig : universal scaling ] ) @xmath3 .",
    "we are unable to determine which of these two profiles is more realistic , as they differ only by a @xmath158 factor , whereas the temperature range spanned by our data is narrow and the uncertainties are substantial .",
    "both profiles slightly flatten for @xmath279 .",
    "this is where @xmath280 , suggesting that @xmath4 may play a more fundamental role than @xmath26 in defining the thermal profile .",
    "previous suggestions to scale the radius by @xmath105 , the entropy by @xmath281 , or both , only diminish the correlation ; the @xmath105 scaling effectively splits the gas by mass .",
    "we find no difference between gas with versus those without h@xmath168 filaments , nor any @xmath167 profiles showing a minimum ; this differs from previous reports , but is consistent with the absence of an ` entropy floor ' ( _ e.g. , _ * ? ? ?",
    "we find that the giant elliptical galaxy m49 , which resides in the outskirts of the virgo cluster and harbors an agn , approximately follows the same universal thermal profile ( see figures [ fig : entropy scaling ] and [ fig : universal scaling ] ) .",
    "it would be interesting to see if the universal profile characterizes all agn harboring systems , and thus more generally applies not only for gas .",
    "the universal thermal profile may seem surprising , as it appears to be oblivious to the temperature peak at the edge of the core and to the virial shock at the edge of the ga , and is robust to the presence of the ongoing cooling , merger , and agn activity .",
    "furthermore , the profile ( in either of the two idealized forms we derive , equations   or ) is not naturally obtained from the flow equations without introducing some large number or a dimensional constant , even if conduction and cooling are taken into account .",
    "this suggests some non - local mechanism .",
    "the entropy profile is usually attributed to the self - similar evolution of primordial gas crossing the virial shock .",
    "however , we find that this model , without baryonic effects , does not provide a good description to the data , for the following reasons : _ ( i ) _ the observed profile shows no break as one crosses into the core , where radiative cooling becomes significant and the self - similarity is expected to break ; _ ( ii ) _ the self - similar model predicts a @xmath125 correlation between the entropy and the ga mass , which is inconsistent with our results ( see figure  [ fig : k100 by cluster ] ) by more than @xmath282 ; _ ( iii ) _ the normalization of the entropy in the self - similar model is inconsistent with our results ( at significance levels ranging between @xmath177 and @xmath178 for different clusters , and @xmath179 on average ; see figure  [ fig : k100 by cluster ] ) ; _ ( iv ) _ the self - similar model predicts a radial power law @xmath283 , which is inconsistent with our results at @xmath172 for the full @xmath117 sample , or @xmath180 when limited to radii outside the core ( @xmath284 ; see figure  [ fig : entropy scaling ] ) .",
    "alternative mechanisms , such as non - standard heat conduction or turbulent heating , require fine tuning .",
    "we therefore argue that a robust , dynamical , non - local mechanism is needed to sustain the universal profile .",
    "a natural candidate for such a dynamical mechanism involves the spiral flow , as it too is ubiquitous , spans the same radial range , and similarly overlaps the cc where radiative cooling plays an important role .",
    "this suggests that the universal profile and the spiral flow can both be regarded as manifestations of the cooling problem . to examine",
    "if a spiral flow can regulate the structure of the ga and enforce the universal thermal profile , some assumption must be made regarding the azimuthal gradients , in particular those of pressure ( _ e.g. , _ figure [ fig : perseuspressure ] ) or temperature .",
    "the simplest assumption involving a new length scale , motivated by the slight archimedean nature of cc spirals and by the necessary presence of a convective layer ( appendix [ sec : schwarzschild ] ) , is that in some part of the flow , azimuthal gradients diminish with @xmath27 as @xmath285 , where @xmath201 is an a priori unknown length scale .",
    "a balance between cooling and azimuthal heat conduction thus recovers the @xmath286 profile ( see equations   and ) , while independently requiring a balance between cooling and radial heat advection reproduces the @xmath287 relation ( see equations   and ) .",
    "interestingly , although these two arguments are of a very different physical nature , both give similar @xmath288 scales .",
    "moreover , this range of @xmath201 turns out to be quite natural , signaling the regime where @xmath4 approaches unity and the thermal profile flattens , so no artificial scale is introduced .",
    "indeed , this is also the typical radius at the base of the spiral , where radial and azimuthal gradients are expected to become comparable .",
    "these conclusions confirm the dynamical origin of the universal profile , support the ad hoc azimuthal gradient assumption , and provide hints for more sophisticated spiral flow modeling .",
    "the universal thermal profile , in particular its normalization , shows no correlation with ga mass , as demonstrated in figures .",
    "[ fig : entropy by cluster ] and [ fig : k100 by cluster ] .",
    "this strongly constrains the mechanism behind the thermal profile . in the simple spiral flow modeling of section [ sec : spiral origin ] , this corresponds to the length scale @xmath201 being a universal , mass - independent constant .    a third independent way to see how a spiral flow could regulate",
    "the universal profile is to analyze the flow along the cfs .",
    "to do so we generalize the core spiral flow model of to the entire ga . here , the flow is approximated as a combination of fast and slow components , interacting through the azimuthal pressure gradients in the cf vicinity . to extend the model over a large radial span",
    ", we incorporate the cf contrast @xmath93 to obtain @xmath289 .",
    "this expression yields more realistic thermal profiles within the core , and a more feasible dynamical structure than found in .",
    "surprisingly , it also reproduces an approximately linear @xmath0 profile throughout the ga ( see equation [ eq : spiralmodel_k ] ) , consistent with observations , and independent of the ( non - power - law ) radial pressure profile .",
    "consequently , all the observed thermal profiles are reproduced , regardless of the underlying mass distribution , both in and beyond the core , out to the virial radius .",
    "a spiral flow may alleviate the cooling problem ( ) , because it can ( i ) advect heat inward from the periphery or outward from the agn ; ( ii ) distribute energy evenly in space and time ; ( iii ) provide a feedback loop by regulating the flow rate ; and ( iv ) operate with little to no mass accretion .",
    "we strengthen this model by showing how a careful balance between cooling , radial heat advection , and azimuthal heat conduction consistently yields the universal profile under plausible assumptions .",
    "the generalized two - component spiral model provides additional information regarding the thermal and dynamical structure of gas ( see table [ table : value ] ) .",
    "most importantly , such models yield a mild temperature drop toward the ga center , avoiding the cooling problem ( ) . with increasing @xmath27 , the cf manifold is predicted to gradually transition from mildly prolate to oblate , and from a slightly hyperbolic to a mildly archimedean spiral .",
    "the cfs in the model show an increasing @xmath290 contrast , and a decreasing @xmath291 shear .",
    "although this allows for more extended cfs than in , such cfs can not continuously extend from the ga center out to its outskirts , suggesting some pattern intermittency , in accord with observations ( _ e.g. , _ * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "a central open question is the mechanism driving the spiral flow and depositing the necessary angular momentum ; see discussion in .",
    "our results do not distinguish between the two previous suggestions for the mechanism driving the spiral - either mergers or strong agn activity .",
    "our assumptions regarding the azimuthal gradients are somewhat ad hoc , as one could have conjectured more complicated azimuthal profiles such as @xmath292 with some @xmath293 , or @xmath294 . in general , however , these would have led to non - power - law scalings , or to inconsistencies .",
    "a more sophisticated and in part numerical modeling of spiral flows is needed in order to quantify these gradients and resolve the 3d structure of the flow .",
    "spiral flows stabilized by shear - amplified magnetic fields , featuring a fast flow under the cf , are already found in magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) simulations of single clusters undergoing a merger @xcite .",
    "spiral flows were also produced in simulations incorporating radiative cooling ( severely limiting their lifetime ; * ? ? ? * ) and different forms of viscosity @xcite and heat conduction @xcite . to produce a physically viable model for large - scale spiral flows , simulations would need to combine the above elements in a self - consistent fashion .",
    "such simulations would need to resolve the spiral structure both at its base ( @xmath295 ) scale , and its outer ( virial ) scale . the observational evidence outlined above suggests that additional physical processes , notably the virial shock and agn feedback , _",
    "e.g. , _ in the form of radio bubbles , are important ingredients of the spiral flow and should be incorporated into simulations .",
    "a successful simulation should show a long - lived core , and reproduce the observed radial scalings , in particular the universal profile and the structure of the 3d cf surface gradually uncovered by observations .",
    "such simulations , as well as future observations , will directly test our results .",
    "in particular , they could either refine or rule out our spiral flow suggestion for the dynamical mechanism regulating the universal profile .",
    "for example , the presence of a fast flow below the cf , which is based on present observations and simulations , is a key assumption of the spiral flow model ; it will be critically tested with far greater accuracy by future observations and simulations .",
    "a realistic spiral flow simulation , incorporating the physical processes outlined above , would directly test our approximation of two - phases composing the spiral , and gauge the simplified power - law scalings we derive .",
    "simulations and observations would also test additional predictions of the model , such as the presence of a convective zone , a cf intermittency , and entrained radio bubbles @xcite .",
    "the role of the spiral flow in regulating the universal profile will be ruled out if this profile is observed in the clear absence of any underlying spiral pattern , or if simulations conclusively show that spiral flows are non - universal , _",
    "e.g. , _ greatly depending upon initial conditions .",
    "future deprojected profiles of gas , in particular at the low and high temperature ends , should distinguish between the two forms of the universal profile ( equations  [ eq : k fit ] versus [ eq : simple fit ] ) .",
    "deep observations of gas can place strong constraints on the spiral pattern , on the structure of the cf surface , and on the flow itself through , for example , line - of - sight velocity measurements .",
    "these constraints would allow for a better modeling of the underlying spiral flow , and would directly test the azimuthal gradients postulated above , as well as the flow and cf properties they imply .",
    "our results suggest that the diffuse gas survives down to scales where @xmath280 , smaller than thought so far , where the strong competition between gravity and cooling is likely to have interesting consequences .",
    "the identification of spiral structures in galaxy clusters is challenging even at small radii , due to its subtlety and to resolution and projection effects . identifying spiral structures at large radii",
    "is even more difficult , due to the lower @xmath106 .",
    "therefore , the recently identified large - scale spiral structures in three clusters  perseus @xcite , a2142 @xcite , and rxj2014 @xcite  and observational hints of such structures in several more deep observations ( _ e.g. , _ a496 , a3558 , a85 , a2052 , and a2199 ; see * ? ? ?",

    "to further test any possible flattening of the entropy in the outskirts of clusters ( _ e.g. , _ the _ suzaku _ analysis in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , figure [ fig : flat ] shows the entropy in our sample using the method of @xcite ; namely , scaling the entropy to its value at @xmath296 and to a linear radial profile , and scaling the radius to @xmath105 . unlike @xcite",
    ", we see no significant flattening in the entropy at cluster outskirts , in accordance with stacked _ rosat _ @xcite and _ chandra _ @xcite observations .",
    "this has been discussed , based on the data used here , in @xcite .",
    "we extend the schwarzschild criterion @xcite for convective stability , @xmath297 , to an anisotropic medium harboring a spiral flow , implying that a mixing layer must form in a realistic spiral flow .",
    "such flows show cfs with an entropy contrast @xmath298 , where subscript @xmath299 ( @xmath300 ) represents the region just inside ( outside ) the cf .",
    "therefore , the azimuthal entropy derivative must at least somewhere satisfy @xmath301 . at that point ,",

    "<S> the entropy profile is usually attributed to self - similar shock accretion ( shown to be inconsistent with the data ) , to non - standard heat conduction , or to turbulent heating . </S>",
    "<S> we argue that a dynamical mechanism is needed to sustain such a universal profile , oblivious to the temperature peak at the edge of the core and to the virial shock at the outskirts , and robust to the presence of ongoing cooling , merger , and active galactic nucleus activity . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we show that such a profile can be naturally obtained in a spiral flow , which is likely to underlie most galaxy aggregates according to the ubiquitous spiral patterns and cold fronts observed . generalizing a two - phase spiral flow model out to the virial radius </S>",

    "<S> a generalized schwarzschild criterion indicates that observed spiral patterns must involve a convective layer , which may regulate the thermal profile . </S>"
