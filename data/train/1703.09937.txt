    "finally , section  6 brings two binary orbits obtained with the new eshel , demonstrating the capability of the system .",
    "section  7 briefly summaries the presentation of the system .",
    "the eshel is an off - the - shelf , fiber - fed echelle spectrograph manufactured by the french company shelyak instruments .",
    "the system was acquired on 2013 and installed on the wide - field 1 m boller and chivens telescope , an f/7 ritchey - chretien reflector on an off - axis equatorial mount at the wise observatory ( 34@xmath44548e , 30@xmath43545  n , 875 m ) in israel .",
    "the wise observatory site provides @xmath5270 available nights per year with average seeing of 2.5 arcsec .",
    "the spectrograph is fed by a @xmath6 fiber ( fig .",
    "[ eshel ] ) .",
    "the light from the fiber is collimated by f/5 optics on a 50@xmath725 mm r2 blazed grating ( blaze angle of @xmath8 ) with 79 lines / mm , illuminated in quasi littrow configuration .",
    "the light dispersed by the grating is reflected towards a prism cross disperser .",

    "in fiber - fed spectrographs , the photons collected by the telescope aperture are focused on the fiber tip that acts as a limiting aperture ( `` slit '' ) of the spectrometer .",
    "the size of the stellar disk image at the focal plane should be comparable to the size of the limiting aperture  the fiber - tip diameter .",
    "the coupling efficiency between the telescope and the spectrograph is defined as the fraction of the photons reaching the focal plane that enter the fiber . to achieve optimal coupling efficiency with the telescope",
    "a 0.63@xmath7 focal reducer was introduced between the telescope and the figu ( fiber injection and guider unit ) to match the f/7 focal ratio of the telescope to the f/5 spectrograph . with this focal reducer , the @xmath11 entrance aperture of the eshel is equivalent to 2.3 arcsec . with the average 2.5 arcsec seeing at the wise observatory site ,",
    "about half of the photons reaching the focal plane are transmitted into the fiber .",
    "further reduction of the focal length to reduce the stellar image would result in losses at the f/5 optics of the spectrograph that will cancel the gain in the input end of the fiber .",
    "the overall throughput of the eshel setup was measured from the ratio of the guiding ccd counts at the entrance of the spectrograph fiber to the total counts obtained in the spectra , summed over all the orders .",
    "this yielded an average value of @xmath12 over a sample of exposures of f , g , k stars taken in a time span of about 3 months with different seeing conditions .",
    "the eshel reduction pipeline is based on the eshel module ver .",

    "the reduction follows standard procedures of fiber - fed echelle spectrograph data processing ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the pipeline uses reference images of dark , bias , continuum exposures of a tungsten lamp and flat images of tungsten lamp with added blue led illumination to allow better tracing of the blue orders .",
    "the tracing of the orders is done on bias - dark processed flat images .",
    "the flat processing routine identifies the orders , fits a 5th - order polynomial to trace the arc image of the order on the ccd image and extracts the blaze profile for each order ( fig .",

    "the wavelength calibration is based on exposures of low - pressure thar lamp , whose light is injected into the spectrograph input fiber and goes through the same optical path as the stellar light . before each science exposure , two 10-sec exposures of the thar lamp are taken and their sum is used for wavelength calibration .",

    "as described in the previous section , the blaze function for each order is extracted from flat reference images .",

    "as described above , wavelength calibration is based on thar exposures , where the positions of known spectral lines are used to generate wavelength calibration .",
    "position changes of the thar lines during the night due to instrumental variations cause systematic errors which show as rv drifts .",
    "the main cause for such variations are temperature gradients in the immediate environment of the spectrogtraph . to minimize these effects",

    "the scatter of line positions in consecutive calibrations is of the order of @xmath17 m / s , equivalent to a scatter of @xmath18 pixel on the ccd .",
    "this scatter sets a lower limit to the spectrograph precision .",
    "the span of the nightly drift , which can be as high as 12 km / s , may add a drift of the order of 300 m / s for 1 hr exposures .",
    "this drift , however , can be compensated by monitoring rv standard stars and telluric lines .      to conclude this section we show in figure [ hip116085_hd58728_spectra ] one order of the eshel spectra of two stars , hd 221354a standard star ( see below ) and hd 58728a double - lined spectroscopic binary @xcite that we are following ( see section 6 ) .",
    "the unicor algorithm extracts rvs from single - lined multi - order stellar spectra by cross correlating the observed stellar spectra against a given template @xcite . in most cases unicor templates",

    "the maximum value of the cross - correlation function ( ccf ) serves as a goodness - of - fit measure , thus the template with highest median ccf peak ( over all orders and observations ) is chosen .",
    "the unicor algorithm derives rvs for each exposure by locating the peak of the cross correlation of each order as a function of the template shift , and then averaging over the shifts of the different orders to get the rv of that exposure .",
    "the heart of the algorithm is to identify and then remove systematic effects found in some of the orders .",
    "let us denote by @xmath24 the rv obtained per order @xmath25 for each exposure @xmath26 .",

    "the error matrix includes noise , and may also contain systematic errors of unknown nature .",
    "some orders might be contaminated by telluric lines or suffer from wavelength calibration errors .",
    "the unicor algorithm we developed aims to improve the derivation of the rvs and their errors by identifying and correcting the systematic errors at different orders . as we do not know the true values of the stellar rvs , @xmath29 , the algorithm is iterative",
    ".    denote @xmath30 in the zero ( initial ) iteration .",
    "the derivation starts with a subset of orders , @xmath31 , selected for the analysis by eliminating orders governed by telluric lines and orders with low signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "an initial estimate of the stellar velocity and its uncertainty is obtained for each exposure by taking the median and median absolute deviation of this subset respectively .",
    "hence @xmath32 where the medians are taken over all orders in @xmath33 .",
    "the zero - iteration error matrix is @xmath34 with no systematic errors , we expect each row @xmath25 in the @xmath28 matrix , which corresponds to the @xmath25-th order , to be scattered evenly around zero .",
    "an initial estimate of the systematic shift of an order @xmath25 is therefore given by @xmath35 the scatter of order @xmath25 , at the current iteration , is derived from the median absolute deviation of the corrected error matrix , @xmath36 significant systematic shifts , denoted @xmath37 , are defined by the criterion @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is the number of observations and @xmath40 is a shift significance parameter . if the criterion is met , we consider the shift to be significant and @xmath41 , otherwise @xmath42 .",
