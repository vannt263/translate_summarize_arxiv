    "early algorithms based on coined qws with advantage over the classical counterparts were obtained for the element distinctness problem  @xcite and for searching a marked node in a hypercube  @xcite .",
    "many important results were obtained about their asymptotic limit  @xcite , localization  @xcite , universality  @xcite , and many others as described in reviews  @xcite .",
    "many experimental proposals were described  @xcite , and experimental implementations were performed  @xcite .    using a different quantization procedure ,",
    "szegedy  @xcite proposed a new coinless discrete - time qw model on bipartite graphs and was able to provide us with a natural definition of quantum hitting time .",
    "szegedy also developed qw - based search algorithms , which can detect the presence of a marked vertex at a hitting time that is quadratically smaller than the classical average hitting time on ergodic markov chains .",
    "szegedy s model was also used for the spatial search problem , that is , for finding the location of a marked vertex in a graph  @xcite , and for searching triangles  @xcite .",

    "@xcite analyzed a version of quantum cellular automata that can be converted into a one - dimensional staggered qw , which is equivalent to a generalized version of the coined qw on the line as shown in refs .",

    "we characterize which coined qws can be cast into szegedy s framework , and which szegedy s qws can be converted into the standard coined qw formalism . in the first direction , the shift operator of the coined qw must be hermitian and the coin must be an orthogonal reflection , which is a unitary and hermitian operator with special properties in terms of orthogonality of the @xmath0-eigenvectors .",
    "the class of orthogonal reflections includes the grover and the hadamard coins . in the other direction ,",
    "the bipartite graph on which szegedy s qw takes place must have a special kind of regularity : the degree of the vertices in one of the disjoint sets of vertices must be 2 , and the weights associated with the edges incident on those vertices must be equal .",
