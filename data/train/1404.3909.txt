    "the role of dark matter ( dm ) in the history of the universe , in particular from 400 thousand years up to one billion years after the big bang , is well known . as",
    "the universe cools down , protons and electrons combine to form neutral atoms of hydrogen and helium . as a result ,",
    "the universe becomes opaque to most of the radiation and enters into a period known as the dark ages . during this time ,",
    "dm and baryons form the first gravitationally bound structures ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , including the first stars , also called population iii stars  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "within a billion years after the big bang , these stars light up , most likely re - heating and re - ionizing the intergalactic medium , and the universe becomes dominated by an ionized plasma once again  @xcite .",
    "these massive stars collapse , leading to the formation of supernovae and black holes , @xcite , enriching the interstellar medium with metals , and triggering the formation of the first generation of population ii stars with low metallicity  @xcite . among them are rare low - mass stars that can possibly be observed today .",
    "although the contribution of the dm to the gravitational field when these first generation stars are formed is relatively well understood , the interaction of dm particles with baryons is not well known , mainly due to the uncertainties in the basic properties of such fundamental particles",
    ".    stars of low mass and low metallicity are among the best known relics of the first generation of stars  @xcite , therefore , they can be used to test the impact of annihilating dm from the formation and evolution of such stars .",
    "although , low - mass stars form quite rarely , due to their long life span they are among the first stars and are the best candidates to probe population iii . a star with a mass of @xmath1 , formed in the early universe , would still shine today , and would be easily recognized by its electromagnetic spectrum , because it would show evidence of hydrogen , helium and lithium lines , as well as a few very weak metal lines  .",
    "this is a consequence of these stars being formed from material that has a composition very close to that composition of the universe as it emerged from the big bang .",
    "the experiments dedicated to direct dm searches have been quite successful at restraining the parameter space of dm particles . in particular , by putting strong constraints on the masses of the dm particle candidates , as well as on the scattering cross section of dm particles with baryons .",
    "nevertheless , quite recently , several international collaborations  ( e.g. dama , cogent , cresst : * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) have reported experimental hints of the existence of a dm particle of low mass , with a mass value in the range of 5 gev  10 gev .",
    "this evidence is reinforced by recent results obtained by the cdms - ii collaboration that suggests the most likely mass of the weakly interacting massive particle ( wimp ) is on the order of 8.6 gev  @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , these results are still controversial , given that other experiments , such as the xenon100 collaboration  @xcite , do not confirm such positive results .",
    "most recently , the lux collaboration have published their first results  @xcite : for dm particles .",
    "they provide upper limits : at a mass of 33 gev , the upper limit on the spin - independent scattering cross section corresponding to the elastic collision of dm on nuclei is set at @xmath2 .",
    "one of the most exciting challenges in modern cosmology and particle physics is to identify the fundamental nature of dm particles . to discover how dm interacts with baryons  @xcite , and in particular , to explain how it may have contributed to the formation of the first stellar populations .",
    "the impact of dm on stars in the primordial universe  @xcite , and in the local universe  @xcite , including the center of our galaxy , has been addressed by several authors  @xcite . in particular ,",
    "some of these papers have helped to set important constraints on the parameters of symmetric and asymmetric dm .",
    "both the sun , by means of helioseismogy  @xcite and solar neutrinos  @xcite , as well as neutron stars  @xcite , are among the most useful stellar objects to constraining the properties of dm .    in this work",
    ", we study the impact of light dm particles in the evolution of low- and intermediate - mass stars .",
    "in particular , we choose to focus our study on a class of particles that have properties in common with recent hints of direct detection of dm candidates , but also belong to a theoretical class of dm particles , known as asymmetric @xmath3-dm particles  @xcite .",
    "these particles , like wimps , are neutral , cold , massive particles that interact with baryons through a mechanism identical to weak interactions . however , unlike classical wimps , these can be dirac particles , i.e. , particle ( @xmath4 ) and antiparticle ( @xmath5 ) are not the same .",
    "this type of @xmath3-dm particle , like baryons , also has an asymmetry parameter @xmath6 of identical value to the observed value of the baryon asymmetry parameter @xmath7 .",
    ".@xmath8dark matter particles [ cols= \" < , < , < , < , < , < , < \" , ]     [ tab:1 ]    current cosmological observations suggest that the matter in the universe is a mixture of dm particles and baryons",

    "furthermore , the observational baryon asymmetry @xmath7 is also known with relatively good accuracy  @xcite . in particular ,  @xcite estimate a proxy for @xmath7 , the baryon / photon ratio , to be of the order of @xmath13 .    in spite of the fact that the origin of dm in the primordial universe is not well - known , the nucleosynthesis mechanisms related to the production of light elements is well understood .",
    "recent calculations of standard big bang nucleosynthesis  @xcite , including a complete network of more than 400 nuclear reactions , predict an abundance of light elements in agreement with _",
    "wmap _ and _ planck _ data , and a negligible production of heavy elements .",
    "the ratio of carbon , nitrogen and oxygen relative to hydrogen is of the order of @xmath14 .",
    "in particular , the prediction of the abundances of light elements d , @xmath15he , @xmath16li and @xmath17he  ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is consistent with the observed values of the baryon relic density and baryon asymmetry . among the light elements ,",
    "the helium abundance is the most precisely observed primordial abundance . the current value for the helium mass fraction @xmath18 measured by the _ planck _",
    "mission is @xmath19  @xcite .",
    "this value is consistent with the helium abundance determined by observations of extragalactic hii regions  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , @xmath20 .",
    "the difference between the observed values is attributed to the initial enrichment of helium by the first population of massive stars .",
    "several authors have proposed that the dm observed today was produced in the early universe by a mechanism identical to baryogenesis  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "likewise , during this early phase of the universe , an asymmetry between particles and antiparticles of dm arises , which is similar to the asymmetry between baryons and antibaryons , resulting in a substantial excess of dm today . in this class of cosmological models ,",
    "the dm is composed of a mixture of particles ( @xmath4 ) and antiparticles ( @xmath5 ) of mass @xmath21  ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in particular the population of dm particles and antiparticles in the current universe is such that @xmath22 , where @xmath23 and @xmath24 are the relic density of dm particles and antiparticles . among other properties ,",
    "these particles are also characterized by @xmath25 , the number of internal degrees of freedom , and @xmath26 , the effective number of relativistic degrees of freedom .",
    "furthermore , the asymmetry between dm particles and antiparticles is defined by the asymmetric parameter @xmath6 which is the equivalent of @xmath7 for baryons  @xcite .",
    "we will restrict our study to the case of dm particles with the @xmath27 annihilation rate corresponding to the pure s - wave annihilation channel .",
    "the case of the p - wave annihilation channel leads to identical results .",
    "a detailed discussion can be found in  @xcite .    in this work ,",
    "we study the impact of this new dm particle candidate on the evolution of low - metallicity stars of low and intermediate masses .",
    "it is worth noticing that the results obtained here are relevant for a large number of dm particle types .",
    "figure  [ fig:1 ] shows the present @xmath28 of several cosmological models of dm particles with a mass of @xmath29 and different values of @xmath6 and @xmath27 .",
    "as shown , only a small set of models have a value of @xmath28 that is consistent with present day observations .",
    "we also indicate other sets of models corresponding to particles with a mass of @xmath30 and @xmath31 , which are also compatible with the observed value of @xmath28 .",
    "table  [ tab:1 ] presents the numerical values for a few of these sets of models .",
    "these results show that for models with very low values of @xmath6 , there is no distinction between models with particles of different masses , but for larger values of @xmath6 this differentiation is very clear .",
    "this means that in symmetric @xmath3-dm models ( low value of @xmath6 ) , the annihilation channels are independent of the particle s mass .",
    "however , this dependence becomes visible for strongly asymmetric @xmath3-dm models ( high value of @xmath6 ) .",
    "actually , the maximum value , @xmath6 , of a given set of models , consistent with @xmath7 ( _ wmap _ and _ planck _ observations ) , depends strongly on the mass of the dm particle . in the cases shown , these correspond to the values @xmath32 , @xmath33 , and @xmath34 for the cosmological models containing particles with masses of @xmath35 , @xmath36 , and @xmath37 @xmath38 , respectively .",
    "in fact , it is interesting to note that @xmath8models with @xmath39 and high @xmath6 ( strongly asymmetric dm particles ) are the ones for which the @xmath6 is closer to the observational value of @xmath7 ( see table  [ tab:1 ] ) .",
    "unfortunately , there are no reliable constraints on the annihilation rate @xmath27 .",
    "although , it is not directly comparable to this study , it is worth mentioning that , by using milky way satellites galaxies , the _ fermi _ collaboration  @xcite have put a constraint on the thermal - averaged annihilation rate to be less than @xmath40 , for @xmath41 in the @xmath42 channel , and for @xmath43 in the @xmath42 and @xmath44 channels .",
    "it is interesting to note that this value of the annihilation rate @xmath27 is two orders of magnitude below that of the dm model discussed in this work .",
    "we emphasize that the dm model with @xmath45 corresponds to symmetric ( majorana ) dm particles for which @xmath46 ( see  table  [ tab:1 ] ) .",
    "however , unlike in classical dm models , in this case the dm presents a certain degree of asymmetry , @xmath6 which can vary between @xmath47 to @xmath48 a few orders of magnitude smaller than the observed value of @xmath7 .",
    "finally , we note that symmetric dm , as found in most of the literature , corresponds to a very low value of @xmath49 and a very high annihilation rate @xmath27 .",
    "similarly , asymmetric dm corresponds to a very high @xmath6 and very low annihilation rate @xmath27 . in the following sections , we will study the impact on stellar evolution of a set of a few candidate dm particles , for which @xmath50 is consistent with the current observations ( see figure  [ fig:1 ] ) .",
    "current models of primordial stellar formation suggest that the first generation of stars formed in dm mini - halos at a redshift of @xmath51 20  70 , as part of binary or higher - order multiple stellar systems  @xcite .",
    "the very first of these stars would have formed at @xmath52 .",
    "they are expected to be massive or very massive stars with @xmath53 10  100 @xmath54  @xcite .",
    "numerical simulations at high - resolution on small scales suggest that these stars formed within high density dm halos with a total mass of @xmath55  @xcite .",
    "these massive stars have a very short lifetime , of just a few million years , and their very rapid evolution terminates as a collapsing black hole or an exploding supernova , enriching the interstellar medium with metals , at least in the latter case . just afterward , a second generation of stars forms within these molecular clouds , which are believed to be the birth place of the low - mass , low - metallicity stars observed today .    in the following",
    ", we will study the impact that @xmath3-dm will have on the evolution these stars , which are considered to be formed in primordial molecular clouds with a large amount of dm .",
    "the baryons will be mainly hydrogen and helium with a very small amount of heavy elements .",
    "we choose the initial abundance of helium to be @xmath56 and the metallicity to be @xmath57 .",
    "we noticed that the difference of 3.5% between the two observational determinations of @xmath18 ( as discussed in the previous section ) has a minor impact on the evolution of such low - metallicity stars .",
    "the relative abundance of particles and antiparticles in the molecular cloud is proportional to the relic density of particles and antiparticles in the local universe ( see figure  [ fig:1 ] and table  [ tab:1 ] ) .",
    "the capture of dm from the hosting halo by a star proceeds by two mechanisms : adiabatic contraction , a process by which protostars form in the center of dense dm halos , generating a local enhancement of the dm density in the core of the star caused by the increasing gravitational influence of the gas collapsed at the center of the halo  @xcite , and the gravitational accretion of dm by the star ( throughout its lifetime ) from the hosting halo @xcite , which is the leading process discussed in this paper .",
    "therefore , the amount of dm captured by the star depends explicitly , among other quantities , on the local density of dm where the star is formed @xmath58 , the mass of the dm particle @xmath21 , the annihilation rate @xmath27 , and the scattering cross section of dm with baryons .",
    "this cross section describes the collision of the dm particles with hydrogen and heavier elements , usually referred to as the spin - dependent or spin - independent scattering cross - section , @xmath59 and @xmath60  @xcite .",
    "it follows that the total number of particles , @xmath61 , and antiparticles @xmath62 , that accumulate inside the star at a certain epoch is computed by numerically solving the system of coupled equations .",
    "@xmath63 with @xmath64 being @xmath4 or @xmath5 .",
    "the constant @xmath65 gives the rate of the capture of particles ( antiparticles ) from the dm halo , @xmath66 gives the annihilation rate of particles with antiparticles , and @xmath67 gives the evaporation rate of dm particles from the star  @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , as we restrict our analysis to particles with a mass larger than @xmath68 , the evaporation rate is negligible  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , we also neglect the capture rate of dm particles scattering off other dm particles already accreted by the star @xcite .",
    "the capture rate of particles ( antiparticles ) by the star at each step of evolution is computed numerically from the expression obtained by  @xcite as implemented by  @xcite .",
    "the description of how this capture process is implemented in our code is discussed in  @xcite .    following the capture of dm by the star",
    ", its evolution is affected by two dm - related physical mechanisms : a new energy transport mechanism that removes energy from the core of the star , and an extra source of energy resulting from dm annihilations . in dm halos of high density",
    ", the latter mechanism always outperforms that of dm energy transport , making any effects of the latter process negligible .",
    "nevertheless , both physical mechanisms are included in our numerical computations .",
    "the annihilation of dm particles occurring inside the star injects several particle species into the stellar plasma , among others , energetic photons @xmath69 s , electron / positron pairs @xmath70 s , neutrinos @xmath71 s , muons @xmath72 s , pions @xmath73 s , nucleons and anti - nucleons , @xmath74 s and @xmath75 s , and gauge bosons @xmath76 s and @xmath77 s .",
    "the unstable particles , such as @xmath73 s , @xmath78 s , @xmath76 s and @xmath77 s will rapidly decay into more stable particles .",
    "we assume that most of these particles , except for neutrinos , interact either by electromagnetic or nuclear strong forces with the local baryons , as they have very short mean free paths .",
    "these particles rapidly reach thermal equilibrium with the rest of the plasma .",
    "overall , these @xmath3-annihilation channels provide the stellar core with an additional source of energy .",
    "the energy generation rate @xmath79 due to @xmath8 dm pair annihilation is given by @xmath80 in units of energy per mass per time ( @xmath81 ) , where @xmath82 and @xmath83 are the density number distribution of @xmath4 and @xmath5 dm particles , and @xmath84 is the radial profile of density inside the star .",
    "the coefficient , @xmath85 , corresponds to the fraction of annihilation channels that are absorbed by the stellar plasma , which we set equal to 2/3 .",
    "the remaining 1/3 corresponds to energy lost in the form of neutrinos .",
    "actually , more precise particle physics models suggest that the energy lost is of the order of 10%  @xcite .    in agreement with hints from present day direct dm search measurements  ( e.g. , dama , cogent , cresst , cdms - ii ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the fiducial dm particle in our simulations has a mass of @xmath86 , the scattering cross section of baryons is such that @xmath87 and @xmath88 .",
    "a detailed account of the sensitivity of the evolution of the star to @xmath59 and @xmath89 can be found in  @xcite .",
    "the values of @xmath6 and @xmath27 were chosen in agreement with the current observation of @xmath28 .",
    "we have also computed stellar models for dm particles with a mass of @xmath90 .",
    "other properties of the dm particles are shown in table  [ tab:1 ] .",
    "the results obtained are consistent with previous estimations done for the case of symmetric dm models  @xcite .    in this work ,",
    "we compute numerically for the first time the impact of dm particles and antiparticles for different values @xmath6 and @xmath27 ( see system of equation  ( [ eq - ni ] ) and table  [ tab:1 ] ) .",
    "figure  [ fig:2 ] shows the hertzsprung ",
    "russell ( h  r ) diagram of several stars ( @xmath91 ) evolving within different @xmath3-dm halos .",
    "the presence of dm in the stellar cores visibly affects the evolution of the star ( notably , luminosity , radius , and temperature ) at different phases of its evolution . the density of the dm halo , the relative proportion of dm particles and antiparticles and the dm annihilation rate are the most important factors affecting the evolution of the star . if the star forms in a dense dm halo , constituted by dm with identical proportions of particles and antiparticles ( i.e. , @xmath6 is small ) and a large annihilation rate , the extra source of energy provided by dm annihilations , @xmath79 , becomes competitive with other sources of energy ( see figure  [ fig:3 ] )",
    "otherwise , the energy produced by dm annihilations is negligible .",
    "these results show that stars formed in molecular clouds with this type of asymmetric dm have a modified evolution path in the h - r diagram .",
    "this is valid for low - mass stars , as pointed out previously for the case of symmetric dm  @xcite , but , as shown here , it is also very important for intermediate - mass stars . in general ,",
    "more massive stars require a large amount of dm to affect their luminosity ( see figure  [ fig:3 ] ) .",
    "we found that for low - mass stars ( with @xmath92 ) the luminosity changes for dm halos with @xmath93 and for intermediate - mass ( with mass @xmath9425@xmath95 ) .",
    "this effect is observed when @xmath96 .",
    "in general , the total luminosity of the low- and intermediate - mass stars is affected in a different way in the various phases of their evolution . as shown in figure  [ fig:1 ] , the luminosity of a low - mass star is reduced during the pre - main , main sequence , and red giant phases ( stars with @xmath97 blue lines ) .",
    "however , the luminosity of an intermediate - mass star is reduced during the pre - main and main sequence phases ( stars with 34 @xmath54 cyan lines ) , but increases during the red giant phase ( stars with 25 @xmath54 red and green lines ) . in the case of intermediate - mass stars in the red giant phase , the luminosity changes by a factor of several orders of magnitude ( stars with 2 @xmath54 and 5 @xmath54 red and green lines ) .",
    "this could present a very interesting target for future observational surveys .    in certain stellar evolution scenarios , the @xmath79 almost balances the gravitational contraction of the star .",
    "sstars in the pre - main sequence phase evolve very slowly toward the main sequence , and stars in the main sequence and the red giant phase follow a similar evolution pattern . as a consequence",
    "the life of low- and intermediate - mass stars is largely extended . in an extreme case scenario ,",
    "the star could stay in the same phase of evolution infinitely long ( see figure  [ fig:4 ] ) .",
    "typical examples are stars with a mass of @xmath98 and @xmath99 , in the first case , the star could extend its life in the red giant phase by a factor three due to its slow evolution during this phase ( see figure  [ fig:4 ] , star with @xmath100 red line ) , and in the second case , the star could live longer than the present age of the universe ( see figure  [ fig:4 ] , star with @xmath101 yellow line ) .    the diminution of the evolution time step due to the presence of dm inside a star affects its chemical composition .",
    "this process is particularly relevant during the red giant phase of an intermediate - mass star .    in a classical scenario of evolution ( without dm ) , as the star departs from the main sequence ( when the hydrogen burning has finished ) , the star experiences a gravitational contraction of its internal layers and an expansion of its external layers , which leads to a significant increase of its core temperature and surface luminosity .",
    "these temperature increases trigger @xmath102-nuclear reactions that , in turn , lead to the production of @xmath103c and @xmath104o in the stellar core . in the case of stars formed within an enriched dm environment , the evolution is identical to the previous case but with a difference : the gravitational contraction during the red giant phase",
    "is slowed down , leading to a much longer phase .",
    "the ignition of @xmath102-nuclear reactions and subsequent production of @xmath103c is retarded .",
    "figure  [ fig:5 ] shows the production of @xmath105 , @xmath106he and @xmath103c and the central temperature during the red giant phase of stars with mass 2  5 @xmath54 .",
    "for example , in the case of a star with a mass of 4 @xmath54 that has a red giant phase with a time span of 10 myr , if the star forms in a dm halo the time span is 100 myr ( see figure  [ fig:5 ] ) .",
    "therefore , the production of chemical elements like @xmath103c proceeds at a lower rate .",
    "this effect is contrary to the chemical anomalies observed in the first generation of stars .",
    "abundance anomalies have been observed in up to a third of extremely low metallicity stars  @xcite .",
    "the c - enhanced stars are also o - rich ( na , mg , and al are enhanced ) and the conventional explanation appeals to the mass accretion following supernovae explosion after nucleosynthesis and the selective fall - back of zero heavy element massive stars  @xcite .    therefore , these observational constraints set an upper limit to the density of the dm halo where these stars formed .",
    "for example , low - metallicity stars with a mass smaller than @xmath107 , can not form in dm halos with a density larger than @xmath108 , otherwise , contrary to observation , these stars will be deficient in metals .",
    "we have studied the impact of light asymmetric dm particles in the evolution of the first generation of low- and intermediate - mass stars formed in a low metallicity environment .",
    "we found that the most suitable candidate is a dm particle with a mass of 10100 gev with a dm asymmetry close to the baryon asymmetry .",
    "depending on the specific dm properties of the molecular cloud where these stars are formed , this type of dm could have a major impact on their evolution , by changing their luminosity , chemical composition , and lifetimes in the different stellar evolution phases .",
    "the most obvious impact of asymmetric dm in the evolution of a star is the extension of their lifetimes resulting from slower evolution through the different stellar phases , namely , the pre - main sequence , main sequence and red giant phases .",
    "furthermore , stars formed in dense dm halos will be at an earlier stage of evolution than stars formed in less dense halos .",
    "equally , a larger amount of dm is necessary to affect the evolution of more massive stars .",
    "in particular , we found that for intermediate - mass stars evolving in relatively mild dm halos , unlike low - mass stars , their luminosity decreases at the end of the main sequence phase , and increases at the beginning of the red giant phase ( see figure  [ fig:2 ] ) .",
    "one of the most interesting consequences that we have found is related to the change in of the chemical composition of intermediate - mass stars during the red giant phase .",
    "the annihilation of dm significantly increases the lifetime of the star in the red giant phase , reducing the time step of the temperature increase and consequently reducing the efficiency of @xmath102-nuclear to produce @xmath103c and @xmath104o .",
    "contrary to this evolution scenario is the fact that some of the low - mass stars known to be among the oldest stars in the universe present an excess of chemical elements such as carbon and oxygen , despite their very small metallicity .",
    "therefore , this provides a constraint on the density of the dm host halos .",
    "the possible discovery of primordial stars of intermediate mass and low metallicity is theoretically possible as dm can extend the lifetimes of these stars , which would constitute a strong indication of the influence of dm on the formation of these first generations of stars .",
    "otherwise , the proof of no - existence of such stars provides a strong constraint on the properties of the hypothesized dm particles .",
