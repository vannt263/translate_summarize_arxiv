    "a variety of systems in nature can be described by complex networks and the most important statistical features of complex networks are the small - world effect and scale - free property@xcite .",
    "networks that have small average distance as random networks and large clustering coefficient as regular ones are called small - world networks@xcite .",
    "and the scale - free property means the degree distribution of networks obeys the power - law form@xcite .",
    "one of the ultimate goals of researches on complex networks is to understand how the structure of complex networks affects the dynamical process taking place on them , such as traffic flow@xcite , epidemic spread@xcite , cascading behavior@xcite , and so on .",
    "the large networks of coupled dynamical systems that exhibit synchronized state are subjects of great interest .",
    "previous studies have demonstrated that scale - free and small - world networks are much easier to synchronize than regular lattice@xcite .",
    "then what makes complex networks synchronize",
    "so easily ?",
    "it is intuitively believed that shorter average distance predicts better synchronizability@xcite .",
    "however , it is found that to decrease average distance will make some complex networks synchronize even harder@xcite .",
    "more bewilderingly , a very recent work suggests that on some synchronization systems , the synchronizability is independent of the average distance@xcite .",
    "some authors also addressed that the homogeneous distribution of degree will lead to better synchronizability .",
    "_ et al.__@xcite investigate the relationship between network synchronizability and various topological ingredients , including average distance , heterogeneity , and betweenness of watts - strogatz ( ws ) networks@xcite .",
    "they suggest the maximal betweenness a right indicator for synchronizability . this tentative conclusion has been widely accepted now@xcite . recently",
    ", several researchers examine the effect of clustering coefficient on the synchronization by using kuramoto model@xcite or master stability function@xcite and find that increasing clustering coefficient will hinder the global synchronization .",
    "all the four topological ingredients , average distance , heterogeneity ( measured by the standard deviation of degree distribution ) , betweenness and clustering coefficient , may reflect the networks synchronizability to some extent , but which one or ones indicate the network synchronizability simply and exactly ?    there is another problem need to be mentioned . when investigating the relations between various topological ingredients and network synchronizability , some parameters , such as rewiring probability @xmath0 of ws networks@xcite or power - law exponent @xmath1 of the degree distribution in scale - free networks@xcite ,",
    "are adjusted to modulate other topological ingredients , like average distance or heterogeneity of degree distribution . however , in this process all the topological ingredients keep changing with the adjusting of these parameters .",
    "it is impossible to get clear relation between an ingredient and synchronizability when other ingredients are still varying , especially when we do not know the tracks of their motions . here in this paper",
    ", we try to discuss the relationship between these ingredients and the synchronization of complex networks precisely .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    ", we give a brief review on how to measure the network synchronizability .",
    "and then , in section 3 , the so - called random interchanging algorithm@xcite is introduced , which allows one to manipulate the clustering coefficient while keeping the network s degree distribution unchanged .",
    "the main simulations are shown in section 4 , and an interesting case is laid out and discussed in section 5 .",
    "finally , in section 6 , we sum up this paper and discuss the relevance of our work to the real world .",
    "in this section , we will introduce a generic model of coupled oscillators on networks and a useful measure@xcite , which is often used to test the stability of the global synchronized states .",
    "consider @xmath2 identical dynamical systems ( oscillators ) with the same output function , which are located on the vertices of a network and coupled linearly and symmetrically with neighbors .",
    "the coupling fashion ensures the synchronization manifold an invariant manifold , and the dynamics can be locally linearized near the synchronous state .",
    "the state of the @xmath3th oscillator is denoted by @xmath4 , we get the set of equations of motion governing the dynamics of the @xmath2 coupled oscillators : @xmath5 where @xmath6 governs the dynamics of individual oscillator , @xmath7 is the output function and @xmath8 the coupling strength .",
    "the @xmath9 laplacian @xmath10 is given by @xmath11 where @xmath12 denotes the neighbor set of node @xmath3 . because of the positive semidefinite of @xmath10 , all the eigenvalues of it are nonnegative reals and the smallest eigenvalue @xmath13 is always zero , for the rows of @xmath10 have zero sum .",
    "if all the nodes are connected , there is only one zero eigenvalue .",
    "thus , the eigenvalues can be ranked as @xmath14 .",
    "the ratio of the maximum eigenvalue @xmath15 to the smallest nonzero one @xmath16 is widely used to measure the synchronizability of the network@xcite , if the eigenratio @xmath17 satisfies @xmath18 we say the network is synchronizable .",
    "the right - hand side @xmath19 of this inequality depends on the dynamics of individual oscillator and the output function ( one can see ref .",
    "@xcite for details ) , while the eigenratio @xmath20 depends only on the laplacian @xmath10 .",
    "@xmath20 indicates the synchronizability of the network , the smaller it is the better synchronizability and vice versa . in this paper , for universality",
    ", we will not address a particular dynamical system , but concentrate on how the network topology affects the eigenratio @xmath20 .",
    "to investigate the structural effects on network synchronizability , we use random interchanging algorithm @xcite to adjust clustering coefficient while keeping degree distribution unchanged .",
    "the procedure is as follows :    \\(1 ) randomly pick two existing edges @xmath21 and @xmath22 , such that @xmath23 and there is no edge between @xmath24 and @xmath25 as well as @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "\\(2 ) interchange these two edges , that is , connect @xmath24 and @xmath25 as well as @xmath26 and @xmath27 , and remove the edges @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "\\(3 ) ensure the network is still connected and compute whether this interchange increases / decreases the network clustering coefficient .",
    "if it does , accept the new configuration , else recover the old one .",
    "\\(4 ) repeat step ( 1 ) unless the desired clustering coefficient is achieved .    since this algorithm only rewires connections and does not change the degree of any node , the degree distribution as well as the degree sequence is fixed .",
    "figure 1 provides a sketch maps of random interchanging algorithm , which may help us understanding the program flow .",
    "in the random interchanging process , operations that bring nonlocal couplings will reduce network average distance @xmath30 @xcite , and at the same time the clustering coefficient @xmath31 will be reduced@xcite .",
    "figure 2 and 3 exhibit the relationship between @xmath30 and @xmath31 . in figure 2 ,",
    "the original networks are the ws networks with size @xmath32 , average degree @xmath33 , and standard deviations of degree distributions @xmath34=0.2 , 0.5 , 0.6 and 0.87 , respectively . in figure 3 ,",
    "the original networks are the extensional ba networks@xcite with @xmath32 , average degree @xmath35 and standard deviations of degree distributions @xmath34=18.43 , 19.26 , 20.65 and 21.26 , respectively . here , the different standard deviations for ws networks and extensional ba networks are obtained by adjusting the rewiring probability @xmath0 and the power - law exponent @xmath1 , respectively . clearly , the trends of @xmath30 and @xmath31 are qualitatively the same .",
    "we have checked that the positive correlation between @xmath30 and @xmath31 is not sensitive to the network size , the average degree and the standard deviation of degree distribution . in this paper",
    ", we examine the relation between average distance and synchronizability , and the relation between clustering coefficient and synchronizability can be obtained easily .    [ 1.2 ] and clustering coefficient @xmath31 when the original networks are the ws networks .",
    "the black squares , red circles , green up - triangles and blue down - triangles represent the cases of @xmath360.20 , 0.50 , 0.60 and 0.87 , respectively .",
    "all the data are the average over 20 different realizations.,title=\"fig : \" ]    the eigenratios for ws and extensional ba model are obtained numerical and their behaviors with the average distance @xmath30 at different standard deviations of degree distributions are exhibited in figs . 4 and 5 respectively .",
    "from each curve in fig .",
    "4 it can be seen that with the increasing of average distance @xmath30 , the eigenratio @xmath20 grows , which means shorter average distance predicts better synchronizability .",
    "the similar result is obtained for extensional ba network shown in fig .",
    "the present result is consistent with the very recent result@xcite that the larger clustering coefficient will inhibit global synchronization in scale - free network .",
    "it can also be seen from figs . 4 and 5 , at equal average distance @xmath30 the larger the standard deviation of degree @xmath34 is ,",
    "the larger the eigenratio @xmath20 will be , indicating networks with a homogeneous distribution of connectivity are more synchronizable than heterogeneous ones when average distance @xmath30 keeps constant .",

    "all the data are the average over 20 different realizations.,title=\"fig : \" ]    average distance and heterogeneity of connections are topological ingredients for network synchronization . shortening average distance and making the connections more homogeneous",
    "solely will increase network synchronizability , however , only their combination could make the network have strong synchronizability .",
    "the average distance of star coupling network is very short , @xmath37 as @xmath38 , while the standard deviation of degree is very large , @xmath39 , and the eigenration @xmath40 , suggesting that it is hard to synchronize when the network size is large . in one - dimensional ring lattice ,",
    "all the nodes have equal degree , thus @xmath41 . however , the average distance @xmath42 is too large ( here @xmath43 denotes the coordination number@xcite ) , thus it is also very hard to synchronize with the increasing network size@xcite .    [ 1.2 ] vs average distance @xmath30 when the original networks are the ws networks .",
    "eigenratio @xmath20 shows positive correlation with average distance @xmath30 when standard deviation of degree @xmath34 is fixed , and at a fixed value of @xmath30 , @xmath20 will increase with the rising of @xmath34 . for a variety of chaotic oscillators ,",
    "@xmath19 ranges from 5 to 100@xcite , so we only investigate the situations with eigenratios less than about 100 .",
    "all the data are the average over 20 different realizations.,title=\"fig : \" ]    for many scale - free network models , heterogeneous distribution of connectivity tends to reduce the average network distance@xcite , ws small - world network obeys the same law@xcite .",
    "thus , in this two kind of networks , the increasing of heterogeneity will diminish the average distance .",
    "while , for ws small - world network the standard deviation of degree is very small , the network synchronizability is mainly determined by average distance , with @xmath30 s decreasing , although @xmath34 increases , @xmath20 will still be diminished , the network becomes more synchronizable .",
    "for some real - life scale - free networks , because of their ultra - small feature@xcite ( @xmath44 or even shorter ) and large degree deviation , @xmath20 strongly depends on heterogeneity , the more heterogeneous is the harder to synchronize .",
    "therefore , shortening average distance is an effective way to enhance small - world network synchronizability and diminishing the heterogeneity of connectivity can make scale - free network synchronize easier .    [",

    "eigenratio @xmath20 shows positive correlation with average distance @xmath30 when standard deviation of degree @xmath34 is fixed , and at a fixed value of @xmath30 , @xmath20 will increase with the rising of @xmath34 .",
    "all the data are the average over 20 different realizations.,title=\"fig : \" ]",
    "some previous studies suggest that the maximal betweenness centrality @xmath45 is a suitable indicator for predicting synchronizability on complex networks@xcite ; the larger @xmath45 is , the poorer the synchronizability",
    ". the betweenness centrality of node @xmath46 is defined as the probability that a randomly selected shortest path of a randomly picked pair of nodes contains the node @xmath46@xcite @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the number of shortest paths between nodes @xmath3 and @xmath49 , and @xmath50 is the number of those paths passing through node @xmath46 . from the definition of betweenness centrality , it is easy to get the relationship between the average betweenness centrality @xmath51 and the average distance @xmath30 @xmath52 previous studies indicate that there exists strongly positive correlation between degree and betweenness centrality@xcite , that is to say , the node with larger degree will statistically have higher betweenness centrality .",
    "therefore , betweenness centrality is approximately determined by average distance and degree heterogeneity : its average value is determined by the average distance , and its breadth by the heterogeneity of connectivity .",
    "therefore , @xmath45 can reflect the influences of both the average distance and degree heterogeneity , which may be the reason why some authors think that @xmath45 is a suitable quantity to estimate network synchronizability .    [",
    "1.2 ] vs maximal betweenness @xmath45 when the original network are the ws networks .",
    "the eigenratio @xmath20 is positive correlated with maximal betweenness @xmath45 when standard deviation of degree @xmath34 is fixed .",
    "all the data are the average over 20 different realizations.,title=\"fig : \" ]    the insets of figure 6 and 7 respectively show the changes of maximal betweenness with average distance at different standard deviation of degree . for ws network ,",
    "the increasing of average distance or degree deviation solely always induces the increasing of maximal betweenness .",
    "it is consistent with the former analysis .",
    "however , for extensional ba network , maximal betweenness is not sensitive to average distance but increases with the increasing of degree deviation clearly .",
    "[ 1.2 ] vs maximal betweenness @xmath45 when the original network the extensional ba networks .",
    "clearly , no positive correlation between @xmath20 and @xmath45 can be observed under this case .",
    "all the data are the average over 20 different realizations.,title=\"fig : \" ]    by running the random interchanging algorithm , we computing @xmath20 and @xmath45 for different configurations , figure 6 and 7 show the correlation between them at fixed @xmath34 for ws network and extensional ba network , respectively . when the original network is a ws network , there exist strongly positive correlation between @xmath20 and @xmath45 at fixed @xmath34 ( see figure 6 ) , which support the previous conclusion@xcite .",
    "but for different degree deviation , networks shows different @xmath20 at the same @xmath45 , although the number of nodes and edges are the same . when the original network is an extensional ba network at fixed @xmath34 , the positive correlation between @xmath20 and @xmath45 vanishes .",
    "the simulation results show that the single quantity , maximal betweenness @xmath45 , may not give a comprehensive description of network synchronizability .",
    "in conclusion , with the help of random interchanging algorithm we show that shorter average distance and homogeneity solely will lead to better synchronizability , but only their combination could make the network easy to synchronize .",
    "some numerical studies have been done to check if the maximal betweenness @xmath45 is a proper quantity to estimate network synchronizability .",

    "it is worthwhile to emphasize that this work is not only of theoretical interest , but also of practical value .",
