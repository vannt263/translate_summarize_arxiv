    "the doped manganites are interesting not only because of the potential applications of their colossal properties , but also because they are fascinating systems to study due to the delicate balance of interactions between charge , spin , and orbital degrees of freedom.@xcite    one of the successful theoretical approaches to the study of the manganites phase diagrams , is based on effective models that consider the competition between double - exchange ( de ) , superexchange ( se ) , and the electron - phonon interactions@xcite .",
    "these models and techniques have predicted interesting phenomena , like nanoscale phase - separation@xcite , influence of disorder in metal - insulator transitions@xcite , and the existence of non - trivial magnetic phases@xcite , among other phenomena .",
    "the ground states of such systems and the finite - temperature properties were obtained using simulations on clusters of spins using the monte carlo ( mc ) technique together with the calculation of the electronic energies by means of the exact diagonalization ( ed ) technique@xcite at each single mc step . in order to extract useful information from the simulations , one needs to analyze different sizes for the clusters , where the cpu ( central processing unit ) memory and time scale as the number of states @xmath0 in the hilbert space to the third- and fourth - power , respectively . in 1999 , the truncated polynomial expansion ( tpem)@xcite was devised in order to reduce the cpu time scaling with @xmath0 , but unfortunately at a cost of a large prefactor and a detailed comparison with exact case ( ed ) was not shown .    moreover , it is of fundamental importance to consider the mn-@xmath1 orbitals @xmath2 and @xmath3 at each site@xcite , which doubles the size of the matrices respect of the case of a single band .",
    "the ed operations have to be performed several thousands times in a typical simulation , practically limiting the spatial dimensions of the clusters considered to d=1 and 2 .",
    "the reduction in the dimensionality of the system artificially breaks the degeneracy of the orbitals @xmath2 and @xmath4 , modifying the electronic properties of the system .",
    "for all these reasons it is important to find an alternative way to calculate the electronic energy that avoids the natural limitations of the ed scheme , allowing to expand the size of the clusters and the spatial dimensionality .",
    "an efficient and fast way to calculate the time - dependent green s operator in an effective model conceived for manganites will be described in this work .",
    "this method uses the chebyshev expansion of the time evolution operator@xcite which is an extremely accurate and fast way to obtain the dynamics response of quantum many - body systems . for a system consisting of 10 spins s=1/2 with heisenberg - like interactions ,",
    "this expansion is three orders of magnitude faster than the ed method , and for a variety of considered cases , is one of the most efficient time - marching schemes to keep track of the time evolution of a quantum system , where cpu memory and time basically scale linearly with system size.@xcite    in this work we will focus our attention to non - trivial single - particle hamiltonians , where the hilbert space grows linearly with the size of the system .",
    "more generally speaking , the presently described method , which will be referred as the _ dyn _ method _ _ , _ _ provides an alternative way to calculate the local time - dependent green s operator for the time - dependent schrdinger equation ( tdse ) . the chebyshev expansion of the hermitian , time - independent , differential hamiltonian operator @xmath5 will be applied to a model related to manganites , which is more efficient than the ed technique for electronic clusters larger than 64 orbitals ( using full parallelization ) .",
    "the feasibility of the method will be tested proposing fixed spins configuration and comparing the densities of states with well known analytic results .",
    "then the ground states , electronic properties and phase diagram for d=3 will be determined by means of the _ dyn _ method together with the mc technique and a comparison with experimental results will be made .",
    "the text is organized as follows : in section ii the hamiltonian model is described , the formalism regarding the calculation of the time - dependent local green s operator is given in section iii and in section iv a benchmark test is used to compare the cpu time as a function of the lattice sites needed by the ed , tpem and _ dyn _ methods . in sections v and vi , the cases of one orbital per site are considered . for fixed configurations of the spins , the electronic density of states are calculated and compared with analytical results , and the relative error is discussed . in section vii",
    "the _ dyn _ method is used together with the monte carlo technique to obtain the ground state and reproduce the phase diagram in two spatial dimensions ( d=2 ) , and the results are compared with the mc+ed technique . in section viii the mc+__dyn _ _ technique is used to obtain the phase diagram for filling x=1/2 and d=3 on a 12x12x12 cluster , and the new results are discussed . finally , section ix contains a discussion of the the main results and general conclusions .",
    "we will consider throughout this work the cases of ( a ) one and ( b ) two orbitals per site , together with the spatial dimensions , d=1 , 2 and 3 .",
