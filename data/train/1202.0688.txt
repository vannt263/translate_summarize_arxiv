    "decoherence is one of the most important problem in quantum information processing @xcite .",
    "the description of this difficult problem usually involves various approximations . during the dynamic evolution ,",
    "the system and the bath are mixed , and a perturbative treatment is required such that we can trace out the degrees of freedom of the bath .",
    "this perturbation is known as the born approximation . moreover ,",
    "if the time scale of the bath is much shorter than that of the system , the markovian approximation is often applied .",
    "an effective method that avoids the above two approximations was developed by tanimura _",
    "et al_. @xcite , who established a set of hierarchical equations @xcite that includes all orders of system - bath interactions .",
    "the derivation of the hierarchy equations requires that the time - correlation function of the bath can be decomposed into a set of exponential functions @xcite . at finite temperature , this requirement is fulfilled if the system - bath coupling can be described by a drude spectrum . the hierarchy equation method is successfully used in describing quantum dynamics of chemical and biophysical systems @xcite , such as the light - harvesting complexes @xcite , of which the temperature of the environment is high enough , and the coupling between the system and the environment is too strong to enable a born approximation .",
    "however , the powerful hierarchy equation method was seldom used in studying decoherence effects in quantum information @xcite .",
    "firstly , the operating temperature of qubit devices is very low .",
    "if we use the drude spectrum , a numerical difficulty arises since the time - correlation function of the bath should be decomposed into a very large set of exponential functions @xcite .",
    "actually , the temperature of qubit devices is low enough that we can use a zero - temperature environment to model the decoherence .",
    "secondly , the drude spectrum is not quite general in qubit devices , especially when the qubit is placed in a cavity , and its environment is usually modeled by a lorentz - broadened cavity mode .    in this paper",
    "we find that the hierarchy equation can also be derived at zero - temperature if we employ a lorentz - type system - bath coupling spectrum .",
    "the set of hierarchy equations derived here provides an exact treatment of decoherence , and employs neither the rotating - wave , born , nor markovian approximations .",
    "system - bath correlations are here fully accounted during the entire time evolution , as compared to traditional master equation treatments , the correlations are truncated to second order .",
    "high - order correlations are shown @xcite to be very important , even producing a totally different physics .",
    "moreover , the hierarchy equation we derive here is found to be effective in the single - mode case , and is a promising method for studying strong- and ultrastrong- coupling physics @xcite .",
    "we use the hierarchy equation method to study a model of two qubits interacting with a common bosonic bath , which is widely considered in studying decoherence - free subspace @xcite and bipartite entanglement dynamics @xcite .",
    "this model was solved exactly @xcite under the rotating - wave approximation ( rwa ) .",
    "it is not surprising that entanglement can be generated for a separable initial state , since the bath induces an effective qubit - qubit interaction .",
    "another observation based on the rwa lies in the steady - state entanglement , which is determined only by the overlap between the initial state and the decoherence - free state , independent of the system - bath coupling @xcite .",
    "this is because the dynamics of the qubit is restricted to a single - excitation subspace .",
    "however , when the counter - rotating terms are accounted , double excitation occurs and the steady - state entanglement vanishes for certain system - bath couplings .",
    "we will demonstrate this observation below .",
    "here we first consider qubits interacting with a bosonic bath , also known as the spin - boson model : @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the free hamiltonian of the qubit and ( with @xmath2 ) @xmath3 where @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the creation and annihilation operators of the bath , @xmath6 is the operator of the qubit , while @xmath7 is the coupling strength between the qubit and the @xmath8th mode of the bath .",
    "the exact dynamics of the system in the interaction picture can be derived as @xcite    @xmath9\\right\\ } \\rho_{s}\\left(0\\right),\\label{eq : rhot_general}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    if the qubit and bath are initially in a separable state , i.e. @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the initial state of the bath , with @xmath12 ( with @xmath13 ) and @xmath14 is the partition function . in eq .",
    "( [ eq : rhot_general ] ) , @xmath15 is the chronological time - ordering operator , which orders the operators inside the integral such that the time arguments increase from right to left .",
    "two superoperators are introduced , @xmath16=ab - ba$ ] and @xmath17 .",
    "also , @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the real and imaginary parts of the bath time - correlation function @xmath20,\\ ] ] respectively , and @xmath21 equation ( [ eq : rhot_general ] ) is difficult to solve directly , due the time - ordered integral .",
    "an effective method for this problem was developed @xcite by solving a set of hierarchy equations , such as the form of eq .",
    "( [ eq : hier_eq ] ) .",
    "the hierarchy equations are obtained by repeatedly taking the derivative of the right - hand side when the system - bath coupling is described by the drude spectrum @xmath22 at finite temperatures , where @xmath23 is the reorganization energy , and @xmath24 is the decay rate of the bath correlation function .",
    "a key condition in deriving the hierarchy equation is that , with the drude spectrum , the correlation function ( [ eq : bath_corr ] ) can be decomposed into a sum of exponential functions of time as @xmath25 , where @xmath26 are the matsubara frequencies .",
    "the hierarchy equation method enables a rigorous study of decoherence - related effects in chemical physics and biophysics @xcite . in such systems ,",
    "the coupling strength between the system and bath is not always weak , and the temperature @xmath27 is so high that only a few matsubara terms could provide enough numerical precision @xcite .",
    "however , the number of matsubara terms in the expansion increases with decreasing temperature , which is difficult to handle numerically . this problem becomes serious when we consider qubit devices , which are generally prepared in nearly zero - temperature environments , and thus prevent the use of the original hierarchy equation method .",
    "fortunately , the exponential decay of bath correlation functions at zero temperature occurs in many quantum computing devices , such as cavity - qubit systems , where the coupling spectrum between the qubits and cavity modes is usually lorentz type , but not drude type , so in that case the hierarchy method can also be applied .",
    "now we consider qubits interacting with a single mode of the cavity , with frequency @xmath28 . due to the imperfection of the cavity ,",
    "the single mode is broadened and the qubit - cavity coupling spectrum becomes lorentz - type @xmath29 where @xmath30 reflects the system - bath coupling strength , @xmath31 is the broadening width of the cavity mode , and @xmath32 is the lifetime of the mode . at @xmath33 ,",
    "if the cavity is initially in a vacuum state @xmath34 , the time - correlation function ( [ eq : bath_corr ] ) becomes @xmath35,\\label{eq : lor_corr}\\ ] ] which is an exponential form that we need to use for the hierarchy equations . in the single - mode limit , @xmath36 and @xmath37 , and",
    "we see that @xmath30 is related to the square of the rabi oscillation frequency .    to derive the hierarchy equation in a convenient form , we further write the real and imaginary parts of the time - correlation function ( [ eq : lor_corr ] ) as @xmath38 where @xmath39 . then , following procedures shown in appendix a and ref .",

    "the vectors @xmath44 , @xmath45 , and @xmath46 .",
    "we emphasize that @xmath47 with @xmath48 are auxiliary operators introduced only for the sake of computing , they are not density matrices , and are all set to be zero at @xmath49 . the hierarchy equations are a set of linear differential equations , and can be solved by using the runge - kutta method .",
    "the contributions of the bath to the dynamics of the system , including both dissipation and lamb shift , are fully contained in the hierarchy equation ( [ eq : hier_eq ] ) .",
    "the lamb shift term @xcite , which is related to the imaginary part of the bath correlation function , can be written explicitly in the common non - markovian equations . since the real and imaginary parts of the bath correlation function",
    "are taken into considered here , the effects of the lamb shift exist in the hierarchy equations , although not in an explicit form .    for numerical computations , the hierarchy equation ( [ eq : hier_eq ] ) must be truncated for large enough @xmath50 .",
    "we can increase the hierarchy order @xmath50 until the results of @xmath51 converge .",

    "@xcite , the rwa was used , and the exact dynamics could only be found in a single - excitation subspace . without using the rwa ,",
    "the model was also studied @xcite in a perturbative way . however ,",

    "( [ eq : ham_b_int ] ) is set by @xmath57 , and for simplicity , we consider @xmath58 .",

    "the explicit forms of @xmath62 and @xmath63 are given in ref .",
    "the time evolution of the density matrix is @xmath64 which is obviously restricted to a single - excitation space , and thus the concurrence of the above density matrix is @xmath65    we first compare the above results with our hierarchy method for the initial state @xmath66 , shown in fig .",
    "the system - bath coupling is set by @xmath54 , which already enters the strong - coupling regime .",
    "such an initial state does not evolve under the rwa , and then no entanglement will be produced .",
    "however , from fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] we observe the generation of considerable entanglement , even with large @xmath31 .",
    "the rwa fails in predicting the real physics .",
    "since the coupling is strong , the oscillation for small @xmath31 case is drastic .",
    "the sudden vanishing and revival of entanglement were observed , and with increasing of @xmath31 , the oscillations of the concurrence were suppressed .",
    "it should be emphasized that , when @xmath36 , the results obtained by the hierarchy equations coincide with our exact numerical results obtained by solving the single - mode hamiltonian directly .",

    "the non - markovian oscillations disappear .",
    "it is interesting that the steady - state entanglement obviously depends on @xmath31 , which can not be predicted by using the rwa .",
    "the steady - state entanglement is shown in ( d ) , and it vanishes if @xmath31 is larger than a critical value .",

    "the dynamics is in the single - excitation subspace , only two states are independent , @xmath67 .",
    "the state @xmath68 is decoherence - free ; this means that if the initial state has non - vanishing overlap with @xmath68 , the steady state is entangled , and the concurrence becomes @xmath69 which is independent of the system - bath coupling strength @xmath30 and the bath - decay rate @xmath31 .",
    "however , if @xmath30 is not very small , although @xmath68 is also decoherence - free , eq .",
    "( [ eq : conc_steady ] ) should be reexamined by using a more rigorous treatment , since double excitations need to be accounted .",
    "actually , the reliability of the rwa was discussed in many literatures @xcite . as shown in refs .",
    "@xcite , counter - rotating - wave terms can induced a significant shift in the population of the steady state even in the bad - cavity case .    in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , we show the results given by the hierarchy method . the initial state there is @xmath70 . according to eq .",

    "we can see in fig .",
    "[ fig2](a)-(c ) that increasing @xmath31 the concurrence of the steady state decreases . in fig .",
    "[ fig2](d ) , we show that for a given @xmath72 , the steady - state entanglement vanishes when @xmath31 is larger than a critical value .",
    "this reflects the importance of the counter - rotating - wave terms , which break the single - excitation condition and give a totally different steady - state entanglement .",
    "similar results are obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the increase of the cavity decay rate is found to decrease the maximum of induced entanglement , and the steady state that computed without rwa has no entanglement but finite discord .",
    "this simple example indicates that some exact results previously obtained under the rwa need to be reexamined .",
    "in summary , we derive a set of hierarchy equations at zero temperature with a lorentz spectrum .",
    "this set of equations is very suitable for qubit - cavity systems , especially when the interaction is so strong that the rwa and perturbative methods break down .",
    "it even works well when the bath has only one single mode .",
    "moreover , this equation is very flexible .",
    "for example , if the qubits interact with several cavity modes , each broadened into a lorentz form , then the bath correlation functions can also be expanded as several exponential functions .",
    "thus the form of the hierarchy equations remains .",
    "the hierarchy equations are applied to reexamine the dynamics of two qubits interacting with a common bath .",
    "previous works usually employed the rwa , and the results were restricted to the single - excitation space .",
    "this is not the case in this paper , since we do not use the rwa , and the counter - rotating - wave terms will cause double - excitations .",
    "we found that the steady - state entanglement depends on the system - bath coupling spectrum .",
    "for a given coupling strength @xmath30 , there will be no steady state entanglement when @xmath31 is larger than a critical value .",
    "the exact dynamics exhibits a totally different physics , compared to the rwa model , which motivates the re - examination of many previous approximate studies .",
