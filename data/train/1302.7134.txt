    "double beta ( @xmath13 ) decay is a process of transformation of a nucleus @xmath29 either to @xmath30 with simultaneous emission of two electrons ( @xmath31 decay ) or to @xmath32 through one of the following ways : emission of two positrons ( @xmath33 ) , capture of electron and emission of positron ( @xmath34 ) or double electron capture ( @xmath35 ) .",
    "the two neutrino ( @xmath36 ) double @xmath0 decay , in which two ( anti)neutrinos are also emitted , is allowed in the standard model ( sm ) ; however , being a second order process in the weak interactions , it is characterized by very long half lives in the range of @xmath37 yr @xcite .",
    "there are 35 known nuclei candidates for @xmath31 and 34 candidates for @xmath6 decays @xcite . to - date ,",
    "two neutrino @xmath13 decays are observed for several @xmath31 decaying nuclei ( see reviews @xcite and recent original works @xcite ) , while indications on double electron capture have been obtained for @xmath38ba in geochemical experiments @xcite .    the neutrinoless ( @xmath39 ) mode of the @xmath13 decay is forbidden in the sm because it violates the lepton number by 2 units .",
    "it is , however , naturally expected in many sm extensions which describe the neutrino as a majorana particle with non - zero mass .",
    "the neutrino oscillation experiments indicate that the neutrinos are massive .",
    "nevertheless , since they are sensitive to the difference in @xmath40 masses , the absolute @xmath40 mass scale is unknown @xcite .",
    "the @xmath41 decay is considered a powerful tool to check lepton number conservation , to determine the absolute @xmath40 masses and their hierarchy , to establish the nature of the neutrino ( majorana or dirac particle ) , to find a possible contribution of right - handed admixtures to weak interaction and the existence of nambu - goldstone bosons ( majorons ) .",
    "a particular analysis of data on @xmath42ge provided an evidence for @xmath41 decay @xcite ; several experiments with the aim to test it and to explore the inverted hierarchy of the majorana neutrino mass region ( @xmath43 ev ) are now in progress or under development @xcite .",
    "studies of neutrinoless @xmath31 and @xmath6 decays are mutually complementary , helping to distinguish contributions from the neutrino mass and right - handed admixture mechanisms @xcite .",
    "@xmath1ru is one of the only six isotopes where the decay with emission of two positrons is allowed @xcite thanks to the high energy release : @xmath44 kev @xcite .",
    "it has also a quite big natural abundance : @xmath45% @xcite .",
    "moreover , in case of capture of two electrons from the @xmath46 and @xmath47 shells ( the binding energies are @xmath48 kev , @xmath49 kev @xcite ) or both from the @xmath47 shell , the decay energies @xmath50 kev and @xmath51 kev are close to the energy of the excited levels of @xmath1mo ( @xmath52 and 2712.68 kev @xcite )",
    ". such a situation could give rise to a resonant enhancement of the neutrinoless @xmath53 and @xmath54 capture to the corresponding level of the daughter nucleus as a result of the energy degeneracy @xcitein accordance with older atomic masses @xcite , the energy release @xmath55 kev gave the decay energies for @xmath53 and @xmath54 captures as @xmath56 kev and @xmath57 kev , respectively , compatible within uncertainties to the energies of the @xmath1mo excited levels ( 2700.2 and 2712.7 kev ) , and @xmath1ru was considered as a very promising candidate in looking for resonant @xmath58 captures .",

    "@xcite : @xmath1ru is no more considered a promising candidate to search for this process ..    in addition , another isotope of ruthenium , @xmath2ru , is potentially unstable with respect to the @xmath31 decay ( @xmath59 kev @xcite , @xmath60% ) .",
    "the decay schemes of @xmath1ru and @xmath2ru are shown in fig .  1 .",

    "the efforts were renewed only in 2009 , when a ru sample with a mass of 473 g was measured for 158 h with an hpge detector ( 468 @xmath63 ) in the underground conditions of the gran sasso national laboratories ( laboratori nazionali del gran sasso , lngs ) of the i.n.f.n . ( 3600 m w.e . )",
    "@xcite ( an updated statistics of 2162 h was then reported in @xcite ) .",
    "the achieved sensitivity for the @xmath6 decays was @xmath64 yr ; for several modes of @xmath13 decay of @xmath1ru ( and @xmath2ru ) @xmath14 limits were established for the first time .",
    "a search for @xmath13 decays of ru was also performed in the hades underground laboratory ( 500 m w.e . ) where a sample of ru with mass of 149 g was measured during 2592 h ; @xmath14 limits were obtained on the level of @xmath65 yr @xcite .",

    "the analysis of the data showed a high level of @xmath5k contamination in the ruthenium ( 3.4  bq / kg ) , and for further measurements the ru sample with an increased total mass of 946 g was purified by an electron beam melting method .",
    "the ruthenium was divided into five parts , each with a mass of almost 0.2 kg , which were slowly melted ( to avoid intensive sprinkling ) using an electron beam and kept in a liquid state under vacuum ( 0.01  0.05 pa ) for @xmath69 h. the purification occurs through the evaporation of the impurities from the melted ruthenium .",
    "more details about the purification process can be found in @xcite . as a result ,",
    "five ru samples in form of oval disks ( totally 719.5 g , density @xmath70 g/@xmath63 ) were obtained .",
    "the purified ruthenium samples were measured over 5479 h in the gemulti set - up ( made of four hpge detectors ; @xmath71 @xmath63 each one ) installed deep underground at the lngs .",

    "the energy spectra without samples were accumulated with the gemulti spectrometer over 7862 h. the results of the measurements are presented in fig .  2 , where the effect of the purification is clearly visible ( here and in the following , the spectra of the gemulti set - up are the sum of the spectra of the 4 individual hpge detectors ) . table  1 gives a summary of the measured radioactive contaminations in the used ru before and after the purification process .",
    "the purification allowed us to decrease the @xmath5k contamination of @xmath75 times ; the contamination by @xmath76ra was also suppressed by @xmath77 times , while the activity of @xmath78ru was decreased by @xmath72 times due to decay with the half life @xmath79 d @xcite .",

    "the excess is explained by the following contributions :    \\1 ) the 511.8 kev @xmath3 line from @xmath78rh which is the daughter radionuclide of the cosmogenic @xmath78ru ; this contribution is estimated to be @xmath90 counts using the supplementary @xmath78rh peak at 621.9 kev with an area @xmath91 counts , taking into account the different yields of these @xmath3 quanta per decay ( @xmath92 and @xmath93 @xcite ) and their detection efficiencies ( @xmath94 and @xmath95 ) ;    \\2 ) the 510.8 kev @xmath3 line from the @xmath96tl contamination in the ru sample ; this contribution is estimated in a similar way as before to be @xmath97 counts using the area of the 583.2 kev peak of @xmath96tl ( with subtraction of the contribution from the corresponding background peak ) ;    \\3 ) the @xmath98 pairs created by the 1460.8 kev @xmath3 quanta emitted in the @xmath5k decay ; this contribution is estimated to be @xmath99 counts using the area of the 1460.8 kev peak , @xmath100 counts ( after subtraction of the corresponding background peak ) , and results of simulation with the egs4 , which give a ratio of 1:31.9 between the 511.0 kev and 1460.8 kev peaks from @xmath5k in our measurements .    the difference between the measured number of events in the 511.0 kev peak and the estimated contributions from the known sources , @xmath101 ) counts , could eventually be ascribed to the effect searched for . obviously , there is no evidence of @xmath33 ( and @xmath34 ) decay of @xmath1ru to the ground state of @xmath1mo . in accordance with the feldman - cousins procedure @xcite , it results in a limit @xmath102 counts for the effect , which can be excluded at 90% c.l . taking into account the calculated efficiency for @xmath33 processes ( 10.36% for @xmath36 mode and 10.31% for @xmath39 ) and the number of the @xmath1ru nuclei ( @xmath103 ) ,",

    "cousins recommended @xcite to give , in addition to the upper limit , also the so - called sensitivity of the experiment defined as `` the average upper limit that would be obtained by an ensemble of experiments with the expected background and no true signal '' .",
    "using the total number of events in the range of @xmath108 kev as the background ( @xmath109 counts ) and extrapolating table xii of @xcite ( in terms of @xmath110 ) , we obtain @xmath111 counts at 90% c.l .",

    "in addition to the analysis of the usual 1-dimensional spectrum , the gemulti set - up with its 4 hpge detectors has the possibility to use coincidences between different detectors for @xmath3 quanta emitted simultaneously ( annihilation @xmath3 quanta in @xmath33 and @xmath34 decays , and @xmath3 s from cascades in the deexcitation of the excited @xmath1mo levels ) .",
    "the set - up , with and without ru sample , has been operated in coincidence mode over 5479 h and 2490 h , respectively .",
    "the procedure of the analysis is the same as described recently in @xcite , where a 2-dimensional spectrum was used to detect the @xmath117 transition of @xmath118mo to the first excited @xmath119 state of @xmath118ru .",
    "so , fixing the energy of one of the detectors to the expected @xmath120 kev ( in accordance with the energy resolution for the annihilation peak ) , we observe the coincidence peak at the corresponding energy @xmath120 kev .",
    "there are 18(4 ) counts in both the spectra .",
    "the monte carlo simulations give the efficiencies to get coincidences of two @xmath3 quanta with energy 511.0 kev : 0.30% for @xmath121 decay of @xmath1ru and @xmath122% for @xmath5k ( which gives the biggest contribution of 2 counts during 5479 h ) . the difference between the observed and the expected number of counts @xmath123 corresponds to @xmath86 = 3.3 counts at 90% c.l .",

    "@xmath124  yr .",
    "this value is comparable but slightly lower than that obtained above from the analysis of the 1-dimensional spectrum .",
    "this concerns also other limits obtained from the analysis of coincidences : while they are comparable with those derived from the 1-dimensional spectrum , in general they are lower due to a lower detection efficiency .      the limit obtained above for the @xmath33 decay considering the 511.0 kev peak ( @xmath102 counts at 90% c.l . ) can be used to estimate a half life limit on the @xmath34 decay to the ground state of @xmath1mo .",
    "taking into account the efficiencies for the @xmath34 decay of @xmath1ru ( 6.12% for @xmath36 mode and 5.89% for @xmath39 ) , we obtain :    @xmath125(g.s .",
