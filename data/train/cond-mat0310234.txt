    "network model builders are currently adopting one of the two complementary approaches : either a network is constructed step by step , by adding successive nodes and links . or else , what is constructed is a static statistical ensemble of networks .",
    "each of these two approaches has its merits and shortcomings : evolving network models shed light on the growth dynamics , while static ensembles are more appropriate for the study of structural traits .",
    "the classical model of erds and rnyi @xcite has been generalized so as to incorporate arbitrary degree distributions and even some correlations , but a serious shortcoming of the static models proposed so far is that they do not capture the common feature of most real networks : neighbors of a randomly chosen node are directly linked to each other much more frequently than by chance , so that many short loops appear .",
    "the networks tend to have locally a tree structure ( see the reviews @xcite ) . and , as pointed out in ref .",
    " for general networks we currently have no idea how to incorporate transitivity into random graph models _  . in this paper",
    "we fill this gap , at least partially .",
    "the attention of the reader should be called to the very recent refs .",
    "@xcite , where the clustering problem is also addressed , but following very different avenues .",
    "graphs are a mathematical representation of networks . for definiteness",
    "we consider in this paper undirected graphs only .",
    "let us denote by @xmath0 the number of nodes in a graph and by @xmath1 the symmetric incidence matrix , with @xmath2 on the diagonal and @xmath3 or @xmath4 depending on whether the nodes labeled @xmath5 and @xmath6 are connected or not .",
    "whole information about a graph is encoded in its adjacency matrix .",
    "a general random graph model can be defined by introducing the partition function ( see , for example , ref @xcite ) : @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the number of links and @xmath9 is a function which we will call the action .",
    "the sum is over all possible adjacency matrices @xmath10 .",
    "the simplest choice is @xmath11 .",
    "the corresponding graphs are those of the classical theory of erds and rnyi @xcite : the value of the ratio @xmath12 determines a variant of the model .",
    "probably the simplest extension of the classical theory consists in setting @xmath13 , directly proportional to the number of triangles .",
    "this has been attempted already many years ago by strauss @xcite .",
    "his results are summarized in the recent review @xcite : _ `` there is however , one unfortunate pathology ... if , for example , we include a term in the hamiltonian that is linear in the number of triangles in the graph , with an accompanying positive temperature favoring these triangles , then the model has the tendency to `` condense '' , forming regions of the graph that are essentially complete cliques - subset of vertices within which every possible link exists ... network in the real world however do not seem to have this sort of `` clumpy '' transitivity''_.    it appears to us that this negative conclusion , which faithfully reflects the content of ref .",
    "@xcite , is not quite right .",
    "there is nothing wrong in strauss s work .",
    "however , it is very incomplete and due to this incompleteness unvoluntarily misleading .",
    "one of the aim of our paper is to give a fresh and comprehensive discussion of strauss s model .",
    "the essence of strauss s argument is as follows : assuming that the ratio @xmath12 is kept constant , one can easily convince oneself that there exist pathological configurations for which @xmath14 .",
    "the contribution of such a configuration to the partition function is explosive in the large @xmath0 limit , since it can not be tamed by the entropy factor falling roughly speaking like the inverse of the number of graphs , _",
    "i.e. _ like @xmath15 .",
    "thus , whatever small the coupling @xmath16 is , the only stable states of the system are the pathological ones , provided the system is large enough .    as we will show later on , the pathological crumpled states - the strauss phase - are separated from a smooth phase by a barrier that grows with increasing @xmath0 .",
    "if the system is prepared in the smooth phase , it has a very tiny probability to roll out over the barrier to the strauss phase .",
    "this probability tends rapidly to zero in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "strauss has missed this point , because the systems he simulated were too small to signal the relative stability of the smooth phase .",
    "now , for all practical purposes one can work in the smooth phase , ignoring the instability .",
    "this is what one does on many occasions in physics , in particular in the context of matrix models , where the instability also goes away when the matrix size tends to infinity .",
    "we have mentioned matrix models on purpose .",
    "the theory of random matrices is an important branch of statistical physics , with applications ranging from nuclear physics to string theory .",
    "some of the techniques developed in this theory can be adapted to a study of the model defined by ( [ eq : pf ] ) .",
    "this is also a matrix model , albeit dealing with rather special matrices : in standard matrix models the matrix elements are continuous random variables .",
    "the form ( [ eq : pf ] ) of the partition function turns out to be very convenient for numerical simulations . in analytical calculations",
    "it will be convenient to use a slightly different formulation of the model , getting rid of the @xmath17-function and allowing small fluctuations of the number of links @xmath8 .",
    "the partition function @xmath18 will be , up to a factor , the average of @xmath19 in erds - rnyi theory .",
    "we first assume that a link is occupied with probability @xmath20 .",
    "hence , for given @xmath0 and @xmath8 the erds - rnyi weight is @xmath21 this primary weight is further multiplied by @xmath19 . inserting ( [ eq : w1 ] ) , integrating over @xmath8 and neglecting an irrelevant factor , we obtain the modified partition function @xmath22 in short , we have traded the @xmath17-function for a gaussian .    in most of this paper we set @xmath23 , as in ref .",
    "thus , formally and up to a rescaling of the dynamical variable the model looks like the much studied matrix model @xmath24 where one integrates over all possible symmetric @xmath25 matrices .",
    "the difference is in the integration measure , which is discrete in ( [ eq : pf2 ] ) and continuous @xmath26 in ( [ eq : ex2 ] ) .",
    "this difference is crucial , of course , but we would rather like to insist on the similarities between the two models . in any case , the example of the matrix model is for us a guide in our study .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows : in sect .",
    "ii we develop @xmath19 in powers of @xmath27 and discuss the features of the perturbation series obtained by integrating term by term . in sect .",
    "iia we recall how the behavior of the perturbation series reflects the existence of an instability of the theory , by considering two examples . in sect .",
    "iib we introduce a helpful diagrammatic representation of the perturbative contributions to the partition function .",
    "these diagrams are counted in sect .",
    "it is argued that at finite @xmath0 the perturbation series is pathological , indicating that nonperturbative phenomena are in action .",
    "however , keeping only the terms that are non - vanishing in the limit @xmath28 one gets , like in the matrix model ( [ eq : ex2 ] ) , a convergent series .",
    "this series is summed in sect .",
    "we obtain a simple analytic formula for the average number of triangles .",
    "we also show that the introduction of the interaction @xmath29 leaves the degree distribution unmodified .",
    "the nonperturbative dynamics is studied in detail in sect .",
    "iii , using the monte carlo technique of numerical simulation . in a range of model parameters",
    "we find a remarkable agreement between the data and the pertubative predictions , showing that the nonperturbative phenomena are negligible in this range .",
    "however , at large enough coupling strength the perturbation theory breaks down , as expected .",
    "the transition point has an interesting scaling with @xmath0 .",
    "this enables us to define the model so as to get a non - trivial behavior of the clustering coefficient . in sect .",
    "iv we discuss possible generalizations .",
    "this section contains also a summary of this work and a conclusion .",
    "before entering into the main discussion of our problem let us consider an elementary example , to help those readers who are not conversant with field theoretic arguments .",
    "consider the following integral @xmath30 where @xmath31 is infinitesimal and has been introduced only in order to satisfy purists : @xmath32 can be regarded as the partition function of a particle subject to the combined action of a potential and of a heat bath .",
    "formally , the integrand resembles the summand in ( [ eq : pf2 ] ) , except that the integration variable is here just a number .",
    "consider a random walk in the potential given by the exponent in ( [ eq : ex1 ] ) .",
    "assume that in some initial moment the particle is located at @xmath33 .",
    "this is a metastable state .",
    "the particle eventually rolls over the barrier and reaches the deep minimum of the free energy at @xmath34 .",
    "as is well known , the lifetime @xmath35 of the metastable state is given by the arrhenius formula  @xcite : @xmath36 the decay of the metastable configuration is a nonperturbative phenomenon .",
    "the escape time has an essential singularity as a function of the coupling @xmath16 .",
    "of course , this nonperturbative phenomenon only occurs at nonzero temperature .",
    "when @xmath37 the particle stays forever in its initial position .",
    "notice that the transition is more a cross - over than a genuine phase transition .",
    "it occurs when the exponent in ( [ eq : arh ] ) is of order unity , but the value of @xmath16 where the transition occurs may slightly depend on how the random walk is performed .    in more complicated models",
    "the arrhenius formula is not so readily derived .",
    "but nonperturbative dynamics shows up , if present , in the structure of the perturbation series in the coupling constant .",
    "let us expand the exponential in ( [ eq : ex1 ] ) with respect to terms other than the quadratic one : @xmath38 it is evident that the series coefficients grow factorially and that the series has zero radius of convergence .",
    "this is a characteristic signal .",
    "we will find a similar behavior , at finite @xmath0 , in the model defined by ( [ eq : pf2 ] ) .    to conclude this section",
    "let us mention what happens when the partition function instead of being a riemann integral , like in ( [ eq : ex1 ] ) , is a matrix integral , like in ( [ eq : ex2 ] ) : a perturbation expansion can again be defined and the terms in the expansion can be given a diagrammatic representation .",
    "a clever manner of cataloging these diagrams has been devised by t hooft @xcite .",
    "one first rescales @xmath39 .",
    "one then observes that these diagrams can be drawn on a two - dimensional surface .",
    "such a surface is always a sphere with a number of handles .",
    "classes of diagrams are characterized by the number @xmath40 of these handles and the contributions of all diagrams belonging to the same class have the same @xmath0 dependence : @xmath41 .",
    "summing over all @xmath40 one gets a badly divergent series .",
    "however , in the limit @xmath28 the spherical topology ( h=0 ) dominates and the corresponding series has a non - zero radius of convergence .",
    "we will seek a similar behavior in our model .",
    "the hint is that one should carefully examine the @xmath28 limit and that it may be wise to rescale the coupling constant in order to get a physically meaningful theory .      in this section",
    "we will introduce diagrams representing terms in the perturbative expansion of ( [ eq : pf2 ] ) . to avoid misunderstanding let us stress from the outset that the diagrams introduced in this section are _ not _ to be identified with the graphs belonging to the statistical ensemble we are working with .",
    "these diagrams are just a tool helping to catalogue contributions to the partition function .",
    "we start by setting @xmath42 .",
    "let us expand in ( [ eq : pf2 ] ) the factor @xmath43 : @xmath44^n\\right\\rangle_{er}\\ ] ] here @xmath45 is the partition function in the erds - rnyi ensemble of random graphs and the subscript er in @xmath46 indicates that the average is calculated in this ensemble . since @xmath45 does not depend on our dynamical coupling @xmath16 it is for us an irrelevant normalization constant .",
    "the problem now is to calculate the averages appearing in the sum in ( [ eq : exp2 ] ) .",
    "we use a method largely inspired by ref .",
    "@xcite , adopting also some of their notations , like @xmath47 which is the number of ways to choose @xmath48 among @xmath0 indices , the different permutations of the selected indices being considered as distinct .",
    "we have @xmath49 , which is up to the factor @xmath50 the number @xmath51 of triangles in the graph .",
    "we represent a matrix element @xmath52 by a line segment .",
    "indices @xmath53 are then associated with the ends of the segment .",
    "the product @xmath54 is represented by a triangle .",
    "notice , that @xmath54 is a random variable which can only take values @xmath4 or @xmath55 . since the diagonal elements of @xmath10 are by definition @xmath4 the probability that this product equals one is @xmath56 .",
    "there are @xmath57 configurations of indices which correspond to nonvanishing contributions to the sum .",
    "hence @xmath58 the power of @xmath20 is equal to the number of the sides of the triangle and the underlined power of @xmath0 is the number of indices one is summing over .",
    "the contribution to the perturbation series is , of course , @xmath59 .",
    "a complication arises as one goes to higher order of the perturbation theory .",
    "as one multiplies the traces one produces strings @xmath60 where some pairs of indices , possibly interchanged like @xmath61 and @xmath62 , repeat themselves referring to the same element of the adjacency matrix .",
    "the corresponding probability factor is then @xmath20 and not some power of @xmath20 .",
    "one has to identify such pairs of indices .",
    "it is also necessary to identify the independent summation indices and to count their number .",
    "one has also to count in how many distinct combinations the independent indices can appear in the string . all this may seem a bit confusing and is best explained with an example .",
    "consider the second order term in ( [ eq : exp2 ] ) , @xmath63 .",
    "one deals with the strings that have the following structure @xmath64 when one sums over indices there appear @xmath65 terms where the indices @xmath66 are all distinct",
    ". then , all the six index pairs are also distinct and the probability of individual strings is @xmath67 .",
    "we illustrate this situation by drawing two triangles ( because there are two traces ) that are non - overlapping , like in fig .",
    "1d . the corresponding contribution to",
    "the perturbation series is @xmath68    another possibility is that the indices @xmath69 are identical to @xmath70 but appear in a different order . for each choice of @xmath70",
    "there are @xmath71 such possibilities and there are @xmath57 such choices .",
    "the probability of the string taking value @xmath55 is @xmath56 .",
    "we illustrate this situation by drawing two overlapping triangles , as in fig .",
    "remember , that there are @xmath71 manners of putting one triangle on top of another .",
    "hence @xmath72 still another possibility is that two and only two indices are equal .",
    "they necessarily belong to two distinct traces .",
    "thus one of the indices @xmath69 equals either @xmath73 , or @xmath74 , or @xmath75 : there are three possible choices .",
    "let us take one of them , say @xmath73 .",
    "then there are three possible structures for the second trace in the product : @xmath76 , and @xmath77 .",
    "notice that @xmath78 and @xmath79 are dummy indices .",
    "we illustrate this situation by drawing two triangles with one common vertex .",
    "remember that there are @xmath80 manners of attaching a triangle to a vertex of another triangle , like in fig .",
    "1c . on the whole",
    "there are @xmath81 arrangements of the five independent indices and six distinct index pairs .",
    "thus @xmath82 finally , two indices among @xmath69 can be identical to two indices among @xmath70 .",
    "there are three choices , let us take @xmath61 .",
    "then there are six possible structures for the second trace in the product : @xmath83 , @xmath84 and @xmath85 .",
    "we illustrate this situation by drawing two triangles with one common edge , like in fig .",
    "remember that attaching a triangle to two vertices can be done is six manners .",
    "there are @xmath86 arrangements of the 4 independent indices and five distinct pairs : @xmath87 the game can be extended to higher order @xmath88 , although the number of diagrams increases very fast .",
    "the third order diagrams are listed in fig .",
    "the general rule is that the power of @xmath20 equals the number of triangle edges ,    .contributions to the partition function corresponding to the diagrams of fig .",
    "2 ; the common factor @xmath89 is omitted .",
    "[ tab1 ] [ cols= \" < , > , < , > , < , > , < , > \" , ]     the number of triangle vertices appears as the underlined power of @xmath0 and , in the n@xmath90 order , there is a factor @xmath91 .",
    "the determination of the number of independent index arrangements is rather tedious .",
    "the best way is to proceed recursively .    using the diagrams one can actually forget about indices .",
    "it is sufficient to construct the diagrams of order @xmath88 by adding one triangle to the diagrams of order @xmath92 in all possible manners .",
    "one has to multiply the number of arrangements factor in the target diagram of order @xmath92 by the number of ways the new triangle can be attached to it .",
    "these numerical factors should be added when a given diagram of order @xmath88 can be constructed from several diagram of order @xmath92 .",
    "we repeat again the rules :    - free triangle : factor 1    - triangle attached to one vertex : factor 3    - triangle attached to a pair of vertices : factor 6    - triangle attached to three vertices : factor 6    the general structure of the perturbation series is @xmath93 the summation over @xmath48 goes from @xmath80 to @xmath94 .",
    "the power @xmath95 is always @xmath96 and @xmath97 corresponds to diagrams where there is one or several groups of triangles lying one on top of another .",
    "clearly , these are the only diagrams that survive in the limit @xmath28 .",
    "the quantity @xmath98 appearing in ( [ eq : exp3 ] ) is the number of paths leading to a given diagram topology . in a sense",
    "it is the number of diagrams of that topology .",
    "we are able to determine it recursively , step by step , but we are unable to give a general formula for it .",
    "it is relatively easy to follow the evolution of the number of triangle vertices during the recursive process , it is much more tedious to keep track of the number of triangle edges @xcite . thus , one can write a recursion equation for the sum @xmath99 that is for the total number of diagrams of order @xmath88 , with @xmath48 triangle vertices .",
    "this recursion relation , in essence , summarizes the rules listed in the preceding section : @xmath100 the coefficients result from elementary combinatorics .",
    "the initial condition is @xmath101 .",
    "the first two iterations are listed below .",
    "one can check that the numbers match those given in figs . 1 and 2 , provided the weights of diagrams with the same number of vertices are summed .",
    "* @xmath63 * @xmath102 * @xmath103 * @xmath104 one can easily see that the numbers given above agree with those presented in table [ tab1 ] . for example , the multiplicity of the diagrams @xmath105 and @xmath106 is , respectively , @xmath107 and @xmath108 , which gives together @xmath109 as expected in the third order for the sum of diagrams occupying @xmath110 vertices .",
    "we can also estimate the number of diagrams @xmath111 in the large order of the expansion , that is for @xmath112 .",
    "as argued , this number is expected to grow faster than a factorial , reflecting the non - perturbative transition to strauss s phase . as we will show",
    "this is indeed the case .",

    "for @xmath135 it becomes convergent for arbitrary @xmath121 and @xmath136 .",
    "we conclude that @xmath111 grows faster than @xmath137 , but slower than @xmath138 for arbitrary small @xmath31 .",
    "such an explosive behavior of the number of perturbation theory diagrams is a signal that nonperturbative phenomena are present .",
    "indeed , it means that the coefficients of high powers of @xmath16 and @xmath139 are increasing dramatically with the order of perturbation theory : what was assumed to be just a perturbation is in fact huge @xcite",

    "only those diagrams contribute to the leading @xmath0-independent term for which the number of triangle edges is equal to the number of triangle vertices .",
    "one can easily see that in these diagrams the triangles can overlap , but otherwise do not touch . in the expansion in @xmath16 up to the third order , the following diagrams belong to this class : a single triangle in the first order , diagrams in figs . 1a , d in the second , and those in figs .",

    "one can write this expansion as follows : @xmath144 the coefficients @xmath145 can be interpreted as the number of all diagrams which consist of @xmath88 triangles located at @xmath48 isolated positions , with possible multi - occupation of a position .",

    "[ fig6 ] are @xmath236 it is very interesting , although not really surprising ( see sect .",

    "up to now we assumed that the interaction has a simple form @xmath241 .",
    "the question which immediately comes to mind is : what happens to the network transitivity when the action is more complicated ?",

    "our diagrammatic rules can easily be extended to include this case .",
    "@xmath244 is represented by a polygon with @xmath88 sides .",

    "iid can be generalized to interactions involving odd powers of @xmath10 .",
    "one can limit oneself to connected diagrams , those contributing to the free energy . in the @xmath28 limit the contribution of a diagram is proportional to @xmath0 to a power equal to # vertices - # edges ( because @xmath188 ) .",
    "we are interested in diagrams which overlap with a triangle . in this case",
    "# vertices - # edges @xmath246 . in all other cases",
    "this quantity is negative and the diagram does not contribute in the limit .",
    "it is easy to see that diagrams surviving in the @xmath28 limit are those where triangles and folded polygons are put on top of each other .",
    "the situation is more complicated for even powers of @xmath10 .",
    "the leading diagrams look like branched polymers , with # vertices = # edges + 1 , and their contribution diverges like @xmath0 . in order to avoid an unwanted renormalization of the quadratic term in the action one has to subtract from @xmath247 a counterterm @xmath248 with an appropriate coefficient in front .",
    "then the calculation is like for the odd power case .",
    "we have not pushed this calculation very far .",
    "as far as we can see one expects a certain degree of universality : the higher powers of @xmath10 should not change the qualitative picture very much , although they may be important for phenomenology , to fit the data .",
    "a comprehensive study of these more general interactions is certainly worth being done .",
    "this is , however , beyond the scope of the present paper .",
    "it is not quite clear what is the best way of extending the theory of this paper so as to obtain an arbitrary degree distribution .",
    "the field theoretical methods extensively used in this paper usually fail when the action becomes nonanalytic .",
    "the simplest , although perhaps not the most elegant , extension consists in using instead of the erds - rnyi model , a general model with uncorrelated nodes @xcite as the zeroth order approximation .",
    "preliminary numerical results look encouraging , although it is clear that much has to be done in order to get a fully satisfactory phenomenology .",
    "we hope to return to this problem elsewhere .",
    "let us now summarize what has been achieved in this work : in most of this paper we have discussed a model of random graphs where the classical erds - rnyi theory is generalized by the introduction into the action of an interaction term @xmath249 , @xmath10 being the @xmath250 adjacency matrix and @xmath51 the number of triangles , respectively .",
    "this model is our guinea pig .",
    "it is a matrix model , but of a special kind , because the dynamical variable is a random matrix whose elements equal either 0 or 1 .",
    "inspired by the analogy with more conventional matrix models we develop a diagrammatic technique , enabling us to calculate the perturbation series analytically .",
    "we count the diagrams and show that , at finite @xmath0 , their number grows so rapidly that the perturbation series becomes pathological .",
    "this also happens in conventional matrix models and , as is well known , indicates the presence of a nonperturbative phenomenon .",
    "the nature of this phenomenon is identified through numerical simulations .",
    "there is a `` potential barrier '' and the system can roll over it and fall into a pathological phase , where all triangles form a unique clan . this phase was first discovered long ago by strauss @xcite , who did not notice , however , that it is separated from a smooth phase by a barrier which becomes impenetrable at large @xmath0 .",
    "we propose to consider this smooth phase as the physical one .",
    "we show , that for large enough @xmath0 and in a range of values of the coupling constant @xmath174 the smooth phase can be considered , for all practical purposes , as stable . in this range of @xmath174",
    "it is meaningful to neglect the nonperturbative physics and to limit oneself to leading diagrams ( those obtained setting @xmath251 ) .",
    "we are able to sum all these diagrams up , obtaining simple analytic expressions for the free energy and for the average number of triangles .",
    "we also show analytically that in this regime the degree distribution is insensitive to the value of the coupling @xmath174 .",
    "a heuristic argument , confirmed by numerical simulations , indicates that the transition point @xmath202 , where the system jumps to the strauss s phase , scales with @xmath0 like @xmath237 .",
    "hence , the physical coupling is not so much @xmath174 but rather @xmath195 defined by the equation @xmath238 .",
    "our simulations indicate that at the transition point @xmath252 to @xmath253 , depending on the average degree , but this result should be taken with a grain of salt . anyhow , the clustering coefficient scales non - trivially , like @xmath239 and is larger by one to two orders of magnitude than in the unperturbed model .",
    "it appears that the analytic treatment can be extended to more complicated , but polynomial actions . in the present state of affairs",
    "the extension of our approach to more realistic , for example scale - free models can only be done numerically .",
    "clustering is a rather striking trait of many observed networks .",
    "the local tree - like structure characterizing most static models is clearly non - realistic .",
    "we have argued elsewhere that static models are an important ingredient of network theory .",
    "thus , we believe that it is important to be able to construct static models with non - trivial clustering .",
    "there was some confusion concerning the feasibility of such an enterprise .",
    "we hope having dissipated it . for the sake of clarity",
    "we have focused our attention on a model where much can be done analytically .",
    "it is a specific matrix model , where matrices are random , but their elements take values 0 and 1 only . in the zero - th order approximation",
    "it is equivalent to the classical erds - rnyi model of graphs .",
    "non - trivial clustering is generated by an appropriate interaction .",
