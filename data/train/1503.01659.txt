    "the importance of interstellar filaments for star formation has been highlighted for the first time by @xcite .",

    "the _ herschel _ observations have revealed the interesting result that filaments apparently have a characteristic width of about 0.1 pc and a density profile , which can be represented by a plummer - like profile .",
    "furthermore , line emission observations of e.g. c@xmath0o or n@xmath1h@xmath2 towards star forming filaments @xcite report non - thermal line broadening , which points to an additional trans- to supersonic turbulent velocity field .",
    "temperatures in filaments are typically in the range of @xmath3 10 to 15 k , which is particularly important for calculating the critical mass per unit length of a filament @xcite .",
    "this is the mass per length below which the filament can be stabilized against radial ( i.e. perpendicular to the major axis ) gravitational collapse .",
    "filaments with a mass per unit length above the critical value are gravitationally unstable along the radial direction and will start to fragment along their major axis ( e.g * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "indeed , observations have shown that filaments with observed star formation activity typically have a mass per unit length above the critical one , whereas filaments with a mass per unit length below this value are mainly devoid of any star formation @xcite .",
    "polarisation measurements towards star forming filaments have also revealed the presence of large - scale and rather well - ordered magnetic fields . in many of the observations the magnetic field",
    "appears to be roughly perpendicular to the filament ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , @xcite report a bimodal distribution of magnetic field directions ( parallel and perpendicular orientation ) with respect to the major axis of the filamentary structure ( see also * ? ? ?",

    "* ) . moreover , by combining numerical simulations of magnetised , molecular clouds and synthetic polarisation maps , @xcite",
    "show that the relative orientation of the magnetic field also depends on the initial magnetisation of the cloud in which the filaments are forming .",
    "the knowledge about the relative orientation would therefore allow to draw conclusions on the importance of magnetic fields during the formation of filaments : super - alfvnic turbulence would cause strong compression , which results in magnetic fields parallel to the elongated structure ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "in contrast , for a magnetic field guided gravitational contraction the field is preferentially perpendicular to the elongated structure ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "furthermore , magnetic fields will also influence the subsequent evolution of filaments , a point we are particularly interested in in this work .",
    "the stability and fragmentation properties of filaments with respect to various aspects like e.g. turbulent motions , external pressure confinement , or accretion onto the filament have been studied analytically in a number of papers ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "there are also a number of numerical studies on the evolution and stability of filamentary structures .",
    "one of the first 2d numerical simulations were performed by @xcite , which demonstrate some typical fragmentation properties of filaments .",
    "subsequently , more realistic 3d simulations showed the sensitivity of the fragmentation properties of filaments to the initial conditions like the mass per unit length , or the presence of global rotation or magnetic fields ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "more recently , @xcite report the formation of prominent clumps forming at the edge of elongated , collapsing structures ( see also * ? ? ? * ) . on molecular cloud scales , the formation of star forming filaments has been studied by means of turbulent box simulations and colliding flows ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "the grey - shaded rectangular gives the observational range found by @xcite . only the runs with a magnetic field parallel to the filament axis are within that range . ]",
    "overall , we find that whether or not the radial density profile of a filament fits the observed values partly depends on the considered time . at late times , all runs but those with a longitudinal magnetic field show a rather narrow filament width and a steep drop - off in disagreement with observational results",
    ".      in the following , we analyse the mean spacing @xmath23 between distinct regions of star formation , where _ distinct _ implies that we subsume close binary or multiple systems .",

    "the results are shown in figure  [ fig : spacing ] where , in addition to @xmath23 , the error bar shows the maximum and minimum distance between the distinct sites of star formation .     between the sink particles for the runs f3_nomag_l1 , f3_nomag_l2 , and f3_nomag_l3 ( left side ) , and f3_para_l1 , f3_para_l2 , and f3_para_l3 ( right side ) after 350 kyr .",
    "the error bars show the minimum and maximum separation found in each run , the different colours and symbols distinguish the different turbulent integral scales @xmath37 .",
    "the two black dashed lines denote the jeans length @xmath25 excluding ( lower line ) and including ( upper line ) the magnetic pressure ( see section  [ sec : frag ] ) .",
    "the black line shows the spacing @xmath36 derived for an isothermal , self - gravitating cylinder . since in run f3_para_l1 only two sink particles have formed , no minimum and maximum spacing is shown . ]    for run f3_nomag_l2 , we identify 18 distinct locations of ongoing star formation .",
    "given the fact that the distances shrink over time due to the global contraction of the filament along its major axis , we normalize the spacing between the fragments to the _ initial _ length of the filament of 1.6 pc . hence , for a given number of @xmath38 star forming sites , we obtain the mean spacing by @xmath39 for run f3_nomag_l2 this results in a mean spacing of @xmath40 pc . for run",
    "f3_perp_l2 ( not shown in figure  [ fig : spacing ] ) we find about 15 different sites of star formation , which results in a mean spacing of about 0.11 pc , which is similar to that of run f3_nomag_l2 despite the larger number of fragments . in both runs",
    "@xmath23 is in rough agreement with the initial jeans length of the filament of @xmath25 = 0.094 pc .",
    "we point out , however , that this comparison is only approximate since the density of the filament changes during its evolution .",
    "nevertheless , this again demonstrates that a magnetic field perpendicular to the major axis of the filament can not contribute to the stabilization of a supercritical filament .    for run",
    "f3_para_l2 the situation is somewhat different : taking into account the overdense regions around @xmath41 pc and 0.05 pc ( see middle panel in fig .  [",
    "fig : timeevol ] ) , which have not yet formed any sink particles , we obtain 8 regions of ( future ) star formation with a mean spacing @xmath23 of about 0.23 pc .",
    "considering only those regions which have actually formed sink particles , the mean distance @xmath23 is about 0.32 pc .",
    "this is about 2  3 times larger than the distance of the fragments expected from a simple jeans analysis , which gives @xmath42 and 0.13 pc when excluding / including the magnetic field pressure .",
    "the measured @xmath23 , however , is in good agreement with the spacing of the `` sausage - type '' instability of @xmath36 = 0.33 pc @xcite .",
    "as shown before , the spacing of fragments can be explained by a jeans analysis or the instabilities in an isothermal , self - gravitating cylinder @xcite .",
    "however , one could expect the turbulent motions within the filaments to also influence the fragmentation properties , in particular since the turbulent integral scale @xmath43 pc is comparable to the mean distance between the fragments of 0.1 - 0.3 pc reported in section  [ sec : frag ] . in order to test this ,",
    "we have performed additional runs with turbulent integral scales @xmath37 of 0.0375 pc and 0.3 pc both for no magnetic field and a longitudinal field ( runs f3_nomag_l1 , f3_nomag_l3 , f3_para_l1 , and f3_para_l3 )    we plot the mean spacing @xmath23 of these runs in figure  [ fig : spacing ] . for the unmagnetised runs",
    "there is a positive correlation between @xmath23 and @xmath37 , which indicates a strong impact of the turbulent integral scale on @xmath23 for unmagnetised , supercritical filaments .",
    "moreover , the poor agreement between @xmath23 and the jeans length for the runs f3_nomag_l1 and f3_nomag_l3 questions whether in the context of filament fragmentation the jeans analysis is always a useful method .",
    "when excluding run f3_para_l1 , where only two sink particles have formed , for the magnetized runs there is no correlation between @xmath37 and @xmath23 recognisable .",
    "the spacing is significantly larger than the jeans length but in excellent agreement with @xmath36 ( equation  [ eq : cylinder ] ) .",
    "moreover , all values of @xmath23 are larger than those in the unmagnetised runs , which again emphasizes the stabilizing effect of a longitudinal magnetic field .",
    "a particular interesting point is the large difference in @xmath23 for f3_nomag_l1 and f3_para_l1 , which we attribute to the same physical origin : the smaller @xmath37 , the larger is the fraction of turbulent energy on smaller scales and the faster it gets dissipated @xcite . for run f3_nomag_l1 this results in a quick decrease of the turbulent pressure counteracting gravity and in turn enhanced fragmentation . on the other hand , for run f3_para_l1",
    ", where the magnetic field already accounts for the stabilization of the filament , turbulence appears to decay too quickly to be able to create local overdensities which could lead to additional fragmentation .",
    "hence , the results of f3_nomag_l1 and run f3_para_l1 represent the two modes of turbulence in star formation , i.e. _ globally _ counteracting gravity by means of an additional turbulent pressure and _ locally _ promoting star formation by creating local overdensities @xcite .    to summarize , our simulations show a high sensitivity of the spacing between distinct sites of star formation on the turbulence field as well as the magnetic field orientation .",
    "the simple approach of a jeans analysis does not match our findings for every case and could even by partly coincidental .",
    "rather , the filaments with a longitudinal magnetic field show a fragmentation behaviour in good agreement with theoretical predictions for a self - gravitating , isothermal cylinder .",
    "next , we analyse the impact of the initial conditions on the global star formation properties .",
    "we show that our initial conditions have only a moderate impact on the global star formation rate although the previously discussed bimodal character of turbulence in star formation is recovered .    in a first step ,",
    "we consider the time averaged accretion rates @xmath44 of all sink particles and the formation times @xmath45 at which the first sink particles are formed ( table  [ tab : results ] ) .",
    "apart from run f1_perp_l2 the values for @xmath44 and @xmath45 in each simulation - subset , i.e. runs with the same initial central density , do not differ too much from each other . in fact",
    ", for each subset the total accretion rates lie within about half an order of magnitude and @xmath45 varies by less than a factor of two .    the bimodal effect of turbulence on the star formation process , i.e. locally promoting and globally hampering star formation ( see e.g. * ? ? ? * for an overview , but see also section  [ sec : intscale ] ) , is also recognisable when considering the time when star formation sets in at @xmath45 : for the runs with @xmath24 , @xmath45 seems to decrease with increasing @xmath37 ( see table  [ tab : results ] ) .",
    "we speculate that since for larger @xmath37 , turbulent velocity fluctuations occur also on larger scales , the turbulent energy does not dissipate as fast as in corresponding runs with smaller @xmath37 .",
    "the turbulent motions rather lead to strong local compressions of the gas which , in turn , results in a faster collapse and an earlier onset of star formation for larger @xmath37 . in contrast to that , when increasing the amount of initial turbulence from transonic to supersonic values ( f3_nomag_l2 and f3_nomag_l2_m2.5 ) , it seems that the onset of star formation is somewhat delayed ( @xmath46 kyr compared to @xmath47 kyr ) due to a higher turbulent pressure .",
    "however , the results also show that an enhanced amount of turbulence can by no means reduce the overall accretion rate @xmath44 once star formation has set in .",
    "rather , there is a slight increase of about 20% in @xmath44 with respect to @xmath44 of the fiducial run f3_nomag_l2 .",
    "however , since the difference is quite small , we can not draw reliable conclusions .",
    "in the previous section we showed that for the runs without any magnetic field as well as a magnetic field perpendicular to the major axis of the filament , the fits of a plummer - like profile at @xmath48 fail to reproduce values comparable to observations ( see table  [ tab : fits ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : width ] ) , since the filaments become to too narrow .",
    "only filaments with a longitudinal magnetic field reasonably fit the observations for all times .",
    "furthermore , @xcite showed that also a toroidal magnetic field could stabilize the filament against radial collapse .",
    "however , observations show that the magnetic field in filaments seems to be preferentially perpendicular to the major axis @xcite although also parallel configurations are observed @xcite . under the assumption that there is indeed a universal width for star forming filaments of the order of 0.1 pc as proposed by @xcite ( or even larger ,",
    "see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , our results raise the question what mechanism allows to retain this width .    as suggested by @xcite , the apparently universal filament width of about 0.1 pc could have its origin in the overlap of a number of parallel , rather narrow filaments , which are too close to each other to be resolved . by means of high - resolution , line emission observations",
    "the authors could show that filaments , which appear uniform in dust emission ( e.g. herschel observations by * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , can split up into a bundle of narrow filaments with widths comparable to those found in our work . such filamentary substructures were also seen in numerical simulations by @xcite and @xcite . however , these authors follow the entire formation of the filaments in a turbulent environment , which probably sets the stage for an enhanced fragmentation process . in contrast , in our simulations we start from a pre - existing filament , which is most likely the reason why we do not find these sub - filaments",
    ". however , our filaments could represent one of these sub - filaments , indicating that such sub - structures would become rather narrow  as indeed observed .",
    "@xcite argue that during the evolution of the filament the turbulent support increases or is at least replenished due to accretion driven turbulence @xcite , which could stabilize the filament over time .",
    "this picture was confirmed by @xcite by means of semi - analytical calculations .",
    "however , as demonstrated in section  [ sec : profiles ] , even for an initially supersonic turbulence field ( run f3_nomag_l2_m2.5 ) , the typical width of 0.1 pc can not be retained for a supercritical filament , even though we allow mass to be accreted onto the filaments .    in order to investigate this problem in more detail ,",
    "we analyse the replenishment of turbulent energy in the case of run f3_nomag_l2 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : accretion ] we plot the mass infall rate @xmath49 as a function of the cylindrical radius at the end of the simulation ( black line ) .",
    "we obtain @xmath50 m@xmath51 yr@xmath52 .    .",
    "]    furthermore , for the accretion driven turbulence model , the inflow rate of kinetic energy is a crucial quantity since it determines the amount of energy , which can  at least in parts  be converted into turbulent motions .",
    "the energy inflow rate is given by @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the radial inflow velocity .",
    "we plot @xmath55 as a function of the radius @xmath10 in fig  [ fig : accretion ] ( red line ) obtaining values of the order of 10@xmath56 erg s@xmath52 .",
    "as shown by e.g. @xcite and @xcite , the turbulent energy is roughly dissipated within one turbulent crossing time : @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the mean turbulent velocity dispersion , @xmath10 the radius which we set to 0.05 pc ( half of the filament width of 0.1 pc ) , @xmath59 m@xmath51 the _ gas _ mass in the filament up to this radius , and @xmath60 the turbulent crossing time .",
    "as stated in @xcite , only a small fraction @xmath61 of the infalling energy can be converted into turbulent motions .",
    "hence , in order to find out which amount of turbulence can be sustained by the observed infall rate , we have to solve the following equation for @xmath58 : @xmath62 inserting the numeric values given above , we obtain a turbulent velocity dispersion of @xmath63 assuming typical values for @xmath61 between 10@xmath64 and 10@xmath52 and using the values for @xmath55 from fig .  [ fig : accretion ] , we obtain values for @xmath58 of at most 0.5 km s@xmath52 , i.e. about 2.2 times the sound speed .",
    "hence , with the observed infall rates , at most mildly supersonic turbulent motions can be sustained .",
    "this seems to agree with the results of @xcite who show that ( sub-)filaments in general appear to be `` velocity - coherent '' structures .",
    "however , with respect to a filament that is supercritical , this turbulence level appears to be relative low and consequently in our simulations the filaments can not be stabilized against radial collapse .    a possibility to overcome",
    "this problem would be a more violent accretion flow , i.e. a larger @xmath65 than the @xmath66 to @xmath67 m@xmath51 yr@xmath52 in the simulations presented here .",
    "this could be obtained by modelling a denser and gravitationally more unstable molecular cloud environment as done by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the authors find filament widths of the order of 0.1 pc and above , although @xcite report narrow substructures inside the filaments itself .    to summarize , with the setup used here , supercritical filaments do not reveal a typical width of 0.1 pc at late stages unless a longitudinal magnetic field is present .",
    "an initial trans- to supersonic turbulent velocity field as well as the subsequent injection of turbulence by accretion @xcite are not sufficient to stabilize a filament at a width of 0.1 pc . to overcome this problem",
    ", turbulence would have to be replenished in a more efficient way , e.g. by higher inflow velocities than it is the case in our current simulations .",
    "alternatively , filaments could be composed of a bundle of even more narrow , observationally unresolved ( sub-)filaments or exhibit an additional longitudinal magnetic field component , which stabilizes the filament along its radial direction .",
    "recently , @xcite observed a filament which exhibits two major , star forming clumps at either side . on the other hand",
    ", observations also show protostellar sources uniformly distributed over the entire filament ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in this work we showed that this could have its origin in different masses per unit length compared to the critical value @xmath68 ( equation  [ eq : crit ] )",
    "however , there are also a number of observations which report the collapse of filaments towards a central massive clump @xcite , which we do not see in the simulations presented so far . a possible mechanism to obtain such a _ centralised _ collapse mode , is to impose different initial conditions in our simulations .",
    "as demonstrated by @xcite there seems to be an increase of the longitudinal , inwards directed velocity towards the common collapse centre .",
    "if there exists such an initially converging flow within the filament , this would explain both the velocity gradient as well as the mass accumulating at the convergence point of the flow .",
    "another explanation would be that the collapse centre , i.e. the massive clump in the centre of the filament was formed / present already during the formation process of the filament itself .",
    "such a density enhancement could naturally lead to a collapse towards a common centre . in order to test this hypothesis",
    ", we consider simulation f3_nomag_l2_condensed , where the density in the geometrical centre of the filament is enhanced by a factor of three ( see equation  [ eq : enhance ] ) . in fig .",
    "[ fig : f3_4 ] we show the column density of the filament at @xmath69 kyr . for this run",
    ", star formation already sets in at @xmath70 kyr , which is about three times earlier than in the corresponding run f3_nomag_l2 ( table  [ tab : results ] ) .        even for a moderate density enhancement of a factor of three ,",
    "a centralised collapse occurs .",
    "fragmentation in the outer parts occurs later , e.g. the sink particle at @xmath71 pc seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : f3_4 ] forms at @xmath72 kyr .",
    "this agrees with the findings of @xcite ( see their equation 24 ) who show that for a perturbation of size @xmath73 and magnitude @xmath61 in a cylinder of length 2@xmath74 , the collapse of the perturbation occurs faster than the collapse at the edge for @xmath75 inserting @xmath73 = 0.1 pc , @xmath76 , and @xmath77 pc as given in our simulation , the above condition is well met , in agreement with the observed centralized collapse mode . since filaments naturally form in a turbulent environment , it is very likely that density fluctuations will occur along the major axis during their formation .",
    "hence , a centralized collapse mode is easy to obtain for filaments which do not have a uniform density distribution along the major axis .      so far",
    "the initial strength of the longitudinal magnetic field in our simulations was constant along the radial direction . in order to account for the observed scaling relation between magnetic fields and the gas density ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) and to test the dependence of our results on the magnetic field configuration in more detail , we perform run f3_para_l2_brad where the magnetic field strength decreases along the radial direction ( see equation  [ eq : dropoff ] ) .",
    "compared to run f3_para_l2 , the total accretion rate @xmath44 on all sink particles is about a factor of 2 higher , which is caused by the reduced magnetic pressure .",
    "however , the creation time of the first sink particle as well as the number of sinks formed ( 7 in run f3_para_l2 and 8 in run f3_para_l2_brad ) are comparable , which leads to an overall similar fragmentation behaviour .    comparing the column density profile of f3_para_l2_brad to that of run f3_para_l2 at @xmath78 kyr shows that in run f3_para_l2_brad the filament is more centrally condensed with a somewhat sharper outer edge ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : f3_para_4 ] ) .",
    "this is also confirmed by fitting the plummer profile ( equation  [ eq : fil ] ) to the radial density profile of the filament , which results in @xmath79 g @xmath22 , @xmath12 = 0.014 pc , and @xmath13 = 2.07 .",
    "= 384 kyr .",
    "the initial radial decrease of the magnetic field in run f3_para_l2_brad results in a more condensed filament . ]    however , the values of @xmath12 and @xmath13 only differ by a few 10% from those of f3_para_l2 and by a factor of 2 for @xmath11 .",
    "since also the star formation properties agree reasonably well , the simplified assumption of a uniform longitudinal magnetic field seems sufficient .",
    "although the initial conditions considered are highly idealised , the simulations can serve as a valuable guide for future and more sophisticated simulations including a better treatment of processes like chemistry and radiative transfer .",
    "we also point out that , due to the large number of simulations we had to perform for this study , an additional degree of freedom ( some degree of disorder for example ) would have not been feasible .",
    "moreover , we emphasize that it is difficult to set up a more realistic filament , in particular when magnetic fields are included , which requires the divergence - free condition to be fulfilled . in future work we will therefore investigate the formation and evolution of filaments in molecular clouds in a self - similar fashion by using high resolution , zoom - in simulations of galactic discs @xcite .",
    "these simulations will also include a proper treatment of the thermodynamical properties of the gas , a fact we so far approximated by an isothermal equation of state .",
    "however , given the rather uniform temperatures found in interstellar filaments ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we consider this as a reasonable approximation .",
    "in this work we investigate the impact of turbulent motions and different magnetic field configurations on the evolution of interstellar filaments .",
    "we also vary the mass per unit length of the filaments ranging from one to three times the critical value .",
    "the simulations show a strong impact of turbulence and the magnetic field orientation on the evolution of interstellar filaments .",
    "they also provide a valuable guide for additional , more sophisticated simulations .",
    "we consider the radial density profiles of the filaments and compare them with recent observations , which suggest a universal filament width of about 0.1 pc . in general",
    "we find that our simulated filaments have a much smaller width and a significantly steeper drop - off of the density at large radii than filaments observed in dust emission ( see e.g. the review by * ? ? ?",
    "in particular , magnetic fields _ perpendicular _ to the major axis can not contribute to the stabilization of supercritical filaments ( @xmath80 ) .",
    "we note that most of our filaments have rather moderate initial turbulence strengths ( mach numbers around 1 ) , which are at the low side but still in agreement with the observational results .",
    "however , even in the presence of supersonic turbulent motions , the filaments quickly become more narrow than @xmath3 0.1 pc .",
    "we also show that accretion driven turbulence can only sustain at most mildly supersonic turbulent motions in our simulations .",
    "hence , this mechanism is not sufficient to support the filaments along their radial direction and to retain a constant width unless a more efficient way is found to convert accretion energy into turbulent motions . in general",
    ", these findings fit into the idea that filaments could be composed of bundles of narrow ( sub-)filaments @xcite .",
    "however , our simulations show that a typical width of 0.1 pc can be retained if the magnetic field is oriented along the major axis of the filament which stabilizes it along the radial direction .    furthermore , we find that filaments with a mass per unit length equal to the critical one follow an _ edge - on _ collapse mode with star formation taking place at the outer edges of the filaments in agreement with numerical and ( semi-)analytical results @xcite .",
    "no or only little fragmentation is found along the major axes of these filaments . towards higher masses per unit length ,",
    "more and more fragmentation is taking place along the entire filament ( _ uniform _ collapse mode ) . when considering the evolution of a filament with an initial , moderate density enhancement in its centre ( factor of three ) , we could show that it collapses towards this common gravitational centre ( _ centralized _ collapse mode ) .",
    "our results are thus in good agreement with actual observations of star forming filaments , which discover all three collapse modes , _ edge - on _ , _ uniform _ , and _ centralized _ ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    finally , we find that the distance between fragments along the major axis can only partly be explained by a simple jeans stability analysis , even when the stabilizing effect of a longitudinal magnetic field is taken into account . for unmagnetised supercritical filaments we could show that turbulent motions have a strong impact on the fragmentation spacing . hence , we tentatively suggest that the agreement between the fragmentation spacing and the jeans length could be partly coincidental and that a simple jeans analysis could be misleading . for filaments with a longitudinal magnetic field ,",
    "the fragmentation characteristics are reasonably well described by predictions for a self - gravitating cylinder @xcite .",
