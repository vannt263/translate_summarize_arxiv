    "a silicon pixel detector  @xcite is currently being developed for the cms experiment at the cern large hadron collider ( lhc ) .",
    "the detector will be a key component in the reconstruction of primary and secondary vertices in the particularly harsh lhc environment characterized by large track multiplicities and high radiation backgrounds .",
    "the innermost layer , located at only 4 cm from the beam line , is expected to be exposed to a 1 mev neutron equivalent fluence of @xmath7  n@xmath2/@xmath3 per year at full luminosity .",
    "the response of the silicon sensors during the detector operation is of great concern .",
    "it is well understood that the intra - diode electric fields in these detectors vary linearly in depth reaching a maximum value at the p - n junction .",
    "the linear behavior is a consequence of a uniform space charge density , @xmath8 , caused by thermally ionized impurities in the bulk material .",
    "it is well known that the detector characteristics are affected by radiation exposure , but it is generally assumed that the same picture is valid after irradiation .",
    "in fact , it is common to characterize the effects of irradiation in terms of a varying effective uniform charge density . in",
    "@xcite we have proved that this picture does not provide a good description of irradiated silicon pixel sensors .",
    "in addition , it was shown that it is possible to adequately describe the charge collection characteristics of a heavily irradiated silicon detector in terms of a tuned double junction model which produces a doubly peaked electric field profile across the sensor .",
    "the modeling is supported by the evidence of doubly peaked electric fields obtained directly from beam test measurements and presented in  @xcite .",
    "the dependence of the modeled trap concentrations upon fluence was presented in @xcite and the temperature dependence of the model was presented in @xcite .",
    "we summarize these results in this document .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : section  [ sec : technique ] describes the experimental details , section  [ sec : simulation ] describes the carrier transport simulation used to interpret the data .",
    "the tuning of the double junction model and its resulting predictions are discussed in section  [ sec : data_analysis ] .",
    "the temperature dependence of the data and model are summarized in section  [ sec : temperature ] .",
    "the conclusions are given in section  [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "the measurements were performed in the h2 beam line of the cern sps in 2003/04 using 150 - 225 gev pions .",
    "the beam test apparatus is described in  @xcite .",
    "a silicon beam telescope @xcite consisted of four modules each containing two 300  @xmath9 m thick single - sided silicon detectors with a strip pitch of 25 @xmath9 m and readout pitch of 50  @xmath9 m .",
    "the two detectors in each module were oriented to measure horizontal and vertical impact coordinates .",
    "a pixel hybrid detector was mounted between the second and third telescope modules on a cooled rotating stage .",
    "a trigger signal was generated by a silicon pin diode .",
    "the analog signals from all detectors were digitized in a vme - based readout system by two caen ( v550 ) adcs and one custom - built flash adc .",
    "the entire assembly was located in an open - geometry 3 t helmholtz magnet that produced a magnetic field either parallel or orthogonal to the beam .",
    "the temperature of the tested sensors was controlled with a peltier cooler that was capable of operating down to -30@xmath10c .",
    "the telescope information was used to reconstruct the trajectories of individual beam particles and to achieve a precise determination of the particle hit position in the pixel detector .",
    "the resulting intrinsic resolution of the beam telescope was about 1  @xmath9 m .",
    "the prototype pixel sensors are so - called `` n - in - n '' devices : they are designed to collect charge from n@xmath11 structures implanted into n ",
    "bulk silicon using p - spray isolation .",
    "all test devices were 22@xmath1232 arrays of 125@xmath12125  @xmath9m@xmath13 pixels that were fabricated by cis .",
    "the substrate , produced by wacker , was 285  @xmath9 m thick , n - doped , diffusively - oxygenated float zone silicon of orientation @xmath14 , resistivity 3.7  k@xmath15 cm and oxygen concentration in the order of @xmath16 @xmath17 .",
    "individual sensors were diced from fully processed wafers after the deposition of under - bump metalization and indium bumps .",
    "a number of sensors were irradiated at the cern ps with 24 gev protons .",
    "the irradiation was performed without cooling or bias .",
    "the delivered proton fluences scaled to 1 mev neutrons by the hardness factor 0.62  @xcite were @xmath010@xmath1  n@xmath2/@xmath3 , @xmath1810@xmath1",
    "n@xmath2/@xmath3 and @xmath410@xmath1  n@xmath2/@xmath3 . all samples were annealed for three days at 30@xmath10c . in order to avoid reverse annealing ,",
    "the sensors were stored at -20@xmath10c after irradiation and kept at room temperature only for transport and bump bonding .",
    "all sensors were bump bonded to psi30/ac30 readout chips @xcite which allow analog readout of all 704 pixel cells without zero suppression .",
    "the psi30 settings were adjusted to provide a linear response to input signals ranging from zero to more than 30,000 electrons .",
    "the interpretation of the test beam data relies upon a detailed sensor simulation that includes the modeling of irradiation effects in silicon .",
    "the simulation , pixelav  @xcite , incorporates the following elements : an accurate model of charge deposition by primary hadronic tracks ( in particular to model delta rays ) ; a realistic 3-d intra - pixel electric field map ; an established model of charge drift physics including mobilities , hall effect , and 3-d diffusion ; a simulation of charge trapping and the signal induced from trapped charge ; and a simulation of electronic noise , response , and threshold effects .",
    "the intra - pixel electric field map was generated using tcad 9.0 @xcite to simultaneously solve poisson s equation , the carrier continuity equations , and various charge transport models .",
    "a final simulation step reformatted the simulated data into test beam format so that it could be processed by the test beam analysis software .",
    "the simulation was checked by comparing simulated data with measured data from an unirradiated sensor . a plot of the charge measured in a single pixel as a function of the horizontal and vertical track impact position for normally incident tracks is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : sharing ] .",
    "the simulation is shown as the solid histogram and the test beam data are shown as solid points .",
    "note that the sensor simulation does not include the `` punch - through '' structure on the n@xmath11 implants which is used to provide a high resistance connection to ground and to provide the possibility of on - wafer iv measurements .",
    "there is reduced charge collection from this portion of the implant and the data shows reduced signal in both projections at the bias dot .",
    "another check , shown in table  [ tab : lorentz ] , is the comparison of the average lorentz angle measured at several bias voltages @xcite . in both cases ,",
    "reasonable agreement is observed between measured and simulated data .",
    ".measured and simulated values of average lorentz angle @xmath19 versus bias voltage for an unirradiated sensor .",

    "the field profile has a minimum near the midplane of the detector which shifts toward the p+ implant at lower fluences .",
    "the field has maxima at the detector implants as discussed in section  [ sec : simulation ] .",
    "figure  [ fig : e_z_profile](a ) shows that a doubly peaked electric field is necessary to describe the measured charge collection profiles even at the lowest measured fluence which is just beyond the `` type inversion point '' .",
    "the dependence of the space charge density upon the @xmath20 coordinate is shown in figures  [ fig : evl_sketch ] and [ fig : spacecharge ] . before irradiation",
    "the sensor is characterized by a constant and positive space charge density of @xmath25  @xmath17 across the sensor bulk . after a fluence of @xmath26  n@xmath2/@xmath3 the device shows a negative space charge density of about @xmath27  @xmath17 for about 70% of its thickness , a compensated region corresponding to the @xmath21 minimum and a positive space charge density close to the backplane . the space charge density and electric field near the p+ implant increase with fluence .",
    "the space charge density is not linear in @xmath20 due to the variation of the carrier drift velocities with the electric fields .",
    "the temperature dependence of the charge collection profiles was studied by accumulating data at @xmath28c .",
    "the pixelav simulation includes temperature dependent mobilities , diffusion , and trapping rates .",
    "the tcad calculation of the electric field map is also based upon temperature dependent quantities including the bandgap energy and srh lifetimes .",
    "the @xmath28c charge collection profiles for the @xmath29  n@xmath2/@xmath3 and @xmath22  n@xmath2/@xmath3 sensors are compared with the simulation in fig .",

    "[ fig : evst ] for bias voltages of 150v and 300v .",
    "it is clear that decreasing the temperature also decreases the fields on the p+ side of the sensor and increases them on the n+ side .",
    "in this paper we have shown that doubly peaked electric fields are necessary to describe grazing - angle charge collection measurements of irradiated silicon pixel sensors . a model of irradiated silicon based upon two defect levels with opposite charge states and the trapping of charge carriers can be tuned to produce a good description of the measured charge collection profiles in the fluence range from @xmath010@xmath1  n@xmath2/@xmath3 to @xmath410@xmath1  n@xmath2/@xmath3 .",
    "the model correctly predicts the variation in the profiles as the temperature is changed from @xmath5c to @xmath6c .",
    "the doubly peaked electric field profiles have maxima near the implants and minima near the detector midplane .",
    "this corresponds to negative space charge density near the n@xmath11 implant and and positive space charge density near the p@xmath11 backplane .",
    "we find that it is necessary to decrease the ratio of acceptor concentration to donor concentration as the fluence increases .",
    "this causes the electric field profile to become more symmetric as the fluence increases .",
    "the effect of decreasing the temperature has the opposite effect of suppressing the fields on the p+ side of the sensor and increasing them on the n+ side .",
    "the measured charge collection profiles of irradiated sensors are inconsistent with the linearly - varying electric fields predicted by the usual description based upon a uniform effective doping density .",
    "this suggests that the correctness and the physical significance of effective doping densities determined from capacitance - voltage measurements are quite unclear .",
    "in addition , we remark that the notion of partly depleted silicon sensors after irradiation is inconsistent with the measured charge collection profiles and with the observed doubly peaked electric fields .    the charge - sharing behavior and resolution functions of many detectors are sensitive to the details of the internal electric field .",
    "a known response function is a key element of an optimal reconstruction procedure .",
    "the effective model described in this paper is being used to calculate detailed response functions that are being incorporated into a new hit reconstruction algorithm for the cms pixel tracking system @xcite .",
    "this will permit the `` calibration '' of the reconstruction algorithm to be tracked as the pixels are irradiated during lhc operation .",
