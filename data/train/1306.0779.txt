    "dark energy is the name of the mysterious component which drives the current accelerated expansion of the universe @xcite . in its simplest form ,",
    "this can be described by a fluid with constant equation of state parameter @xmath1 , which corresponds to a cosmological constant , leading to the successful @xmath2cdm model ; the simplest model that fits a varied set of observational data .",
    "this model has several unnatural properties , that lead us look for models whose description is less forced .",
    "for example , the current value for @xmath3 and @xmath4 are of the same order of magnitude , a fact highly improbable , because the dark matter contribution decreases with @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the scale factor , meanwhile the cosmological constant contribution have had always the same value .",
    "this problem in particular is known as the cosmic coincidence problem .",
    "thus , it seems necessary to assume the existence of a dynamical cosmological constant , or a theoretical model with a dynamical equation of state parameter @xmath7 .",
    "the source of this dynamical _ dark energy _ could be either , a new field component filling the universe , as a quintessence scalar field @xcite , or it can be produced by modifying gravity @xcite , @xcite , @xcite . in @xcite the authors suggested the current observational data favor a scenario in which the acceleration of the expansion has past a maximum value and is now decelerating . the key point in deriving this conclusion is the use of the chevalier - polarski - linder ( cpl ) parametrization @xcite , @xcite for a dynamical equation of state parameter @xmath8 where @xmath9 and @xmath10 are constants to be fixed by observations , in that case the constitution data set @xcite . using the union 2 data set @xcite the authors in @xcite found similar conclusions , under the assumption of a flat universe . in @xcite",
    ", we revisit this problem using the union 2 data set and we extend the analysis to curved spacetimes .",
    "we found the three observational test , snia , bao and cmb , can all be accommodated in the same trend , assuming a very small value for the curvature parameter , @xmath11 .",
    "the best fit values found suggested the acceleration of the universe has already reached its maximum , and is currently moving towards a decelerating phase . in this paper we investigate the recent ( low redshift ) expansion history of the universe in light of recent data .",
    "we use the gas mass fraction in clusters - 42 measurements of @xmath0 extracted from @xcite - and the latest union 2.1 data set @xcite of supernovae type ia ( snia ) .",
    "we also consider the constraints from baryon acoustic oscillation ( bao ) @xcite through the distance scale , and also from cosmic background radiation ( cmb ) from the wmap 9 years distance posterior @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in the next section we re - study the flat universe case using both snia data sets @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "then we present the results using the @xmath0 data .",
    "after that , we discuss the result using the latest union 2.1 snia data .",
    "we end with a discussion of the results .",
    "in this section we describe the results obtained by @xcite and @xcite for the deceleration parameter at small redshift using the constitution @xcite and union 2 @xcite data sets .",
    "the analysis of this section is restricted to flat universes .",
    "the extension to curved spacetime was performed first in @xcite , and can be implemented directly .",
    "the first step is to define a cosmological model to test .",
    "the comoving distance from the observer to redshift @xmath13 is given by @xmath14 where @xmath15 where @xmath16 and in general @xmath17 in this case , the cosmological model is defined through a selection of the equation of state parameter @xmath18 . using the cpl parametrization ( [ cpl ] ) , @xmath19 , the function defined in ( [ fdez ] ) takes the form @xmath20 performing the analysis , we find the best values of the parameters that fit the observations ( the details of the statistical analysis is described in appendix a ) , which in turns give us the best hubble function @xmath21 as a function of redshift that agrees with the data . from it , we can compute the deceleration parameter as @xmath22 using the constitution sample consisting of @xmath23 snia data points , leads to the results shown in table [ tab : table0 ] , which are very similar to the ones informed in @xcite and @xcite .",
    ".[tab : table0 ] the best fit values for the free parameters using the constitution data set in the case of a flat universe model using only snia data ( 1 ) , snia+bao ( 2 ) and snia+bao+cmb ( 3 ) .",
    "see the related fig .",
    "[ fig0 ] . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]         clearly",
    ", the latest snia data does not shown any of the features at small redshift as the previous two data set did . as it is mentioned explicitly in @xcite , the analysis procedure used for the union 2 compilation is again used in the union 2.1 , with the following change : a correction for the host - mass snia luminosity relation . the fact that this low redshift effect has been detected in the previous snia data sets , and that from now on , after some correction ( from systematics ) it disappears completely , can at least be considered disturbing .",
    "this is even more intriguing considering the findings in this paper , which points toward independent evidence of such a low redshift behavior .",
    "a thorough study of this low redshift behavior of snia will be discussed elsewhere .",
    "in this paper , using @xmath0 data from clusters , we have found evidence for a low redshift transition of the deceleration parameter , indicating that the acceleration has passed a maximum around @xmath24 and now evolves towards a decelerating phase in the near future .",
    "this finding is in agreement with previous studies using the constitution @xcite and union 2 @xcite data sets for snia , but they are in intriguing disagreement with the latest union 2.1 set @xcite .",
    "our analysis then strongly suggest that low redshift measurements have reached the precision to scrutinize the local universe , this time not only with snia but also with galaxy clusters . regarding the intriguing disagreement mentioned , the only significant change in the analysis performed between the union 2.1 data set and the previous ones , was the correction for the host - mass snia luminosity relation .",
    "this is exactly the case of a probable related issue considered in the past ; the so called hubble bubble . in @xcite using around forty snia , they found evidence for a local void or hubble bubble as was named after . in @xcite , almost ten years after , the authors found new evidence pointing to similar conclusions .",
    "their existence has been related to the details of the treatment of extinction and reddening by dust @xcite .",
    "hicken et al . , demonstrated @xcite that no such a hubble bubble exist if a reduced value @xmath25 is used instead .",
    "the previous work cite @xcite used a mlcs2k2 fitting method with a reddening parameter @xmath26 .",
    "the constitution and union 2 samples were derived using a milky way extinction @xmath26 from @xcite , meanwhile the union 2.1 uses a lower value @xmath25 . as it was stressed also in @xcite",
    "there is a danger in considering the @xmath27 parameter as an adjustable parameter in the light curve reduction .",
    "actually , independent studies have found averages values of @xmath28 @xcite , @xcite using galaxies , see also @xcite , @xcite for a lens galaxy at @xmath29 , a very much the milky way value , so it is an important issue to take care of the treatment of the @xmath27 parameter in snia studies .",
    "our results suggest to perform a careful study at small redshift to elucidate the low redshift - apparently anomalously - behavior of @xmath12 .",
