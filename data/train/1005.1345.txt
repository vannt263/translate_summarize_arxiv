    "optical injection and detection of spin current have attracted a lot of interest recently in the context of non - magnetic semiconductor spintronics.@xcite exciting progress has been made in recent years , such as the injection of spin - polarized currents by using the spin galvanic effect@xcite and the circular photogalvanic effect,@xcite the observation of spin accumulations induced by the spin hall effect with the help of the kerr rotation@xcite and the _ p_-_n _ junction light - emitting diode,@xcite the inverse spin hall effect,@xcite and the detection of pure spin photocurrent by the second - harmonic effect.@xcite    generation and detection of the pure spin current where there is no net charge current is one of the challenging issues in spintronics .",
    "optically , the generation of pure spin photocurrent has been realized by injecting orthogonally polarized one- and two - photon linear lights,@xcite or by the incidence of unpolarized or linearly polarized lights into bulk iii - v semiconductors and quantum wells with spin - orbit couplings.@xcite in the latter case , a linearly polarized light can be decomposed into circularly polarized lights with opposite helicities . due to the conservation of angular momentum ,",
    "the circularly polarized lights with opposite helicities excite carriers with opposite spins , which are locked to opposite momenta owing to the spin - orbit coupling . as a result",
    ", the photo - injected carriers with opposite spins always have opposite velocities , leading to the pure spin photocurrent .",
    "one way to observed this underlying pure spin photocurrent is to apply an in - plane magnetic field , which will create an imbalance of spins .",
    "the spin imbalance leads to the asymmetry of electron velocities by the spin - orbit coupling and can extract an electric photocurrent from the pure spin photocurrent .",
    "the field - induced conversion from pure spin photocurrent to electric photocurrent ( also referred to as the magneto - gyrotropic photogalvanic effect , mpge ) was systematically studied via the intra - band@xcite and inter - subband@xcite electron heating by thz and microwave radiations , in which spin - dependent scatterings are necessary for the observed charge current .",
    "very recently , the magnetoelectric photocurrent has been observed via direct interband optical transitions.@xcite unlike the intra - band transition , in the direct interband transition the electron momentum is conserved , and the magnetoelectric photocurrent is a few orders of magnitude larger than that via the intraband transition .",
    "therefore , it appears to be promising as a simple and practical method to generate and detect the spin current .",
    "although symmetry analysis@xcite can justify the observed electric photocurrent as a function of magnetic fields and polarization of the light , a microscopic description is still needed .",
    "in particular , the current induced by a parallel field is against intuition , considering the form of the spin - orbit coupling derived from the symmetry argument . moreover",
    ", how to estimate the zero - field pure spin photocurrent from the magnetoelectric photocurrent is an interesting issue .    in this work ,",
    "we study theoretically the generation of photocurrent via direct interband transitions excited by shedding a linearly polarized light normally into a semiconductor quantum well .",
    "we find that the @xmath0-space anisotropy of the carrier density provides an intuitive microscopic picture for the magnetoelectric photocurrent and the zero - field pure spin photocurrent .",
    "the origin of the observed dependences of the photocurrent on the magnetic field and the polarization of the light can be illustrated within this picture .",
    "the photocurrent density calculated with the help of a minimal model with an anisotropic rashba model and the kohn - luttinger model is comparable with the experiment .",
    "moreover , we propose an approach to estimate the magnitude of the undetectable pure spin photocurrent , which is generated at zero magnetic field by the same linear light , from the observed magnetoelectric photocurrent .",
