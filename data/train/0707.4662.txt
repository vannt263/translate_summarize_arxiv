    "pre - planetary nebulae ( ppns ) , short - lived transition objects between the agb and planetary nebula ( pn ) phases , probably hold the key to understanding how the slowly expanding ( 515 ) , largely spherical , circumstellar envelopes ( cses ) of agb stars ( neri et al .",
    "1998 ) transform into highly aspherical pns with fast outflows ( @xmath0100 ) directed along one or more axes .",
    "we are carrying out a program of multiwavelength imaging and spectroscopic observations of generally young ppns , using a large ( @xmath1300 ) , morphologically unbiased sample ( sahai & snchez contreras 2002 , 2004 ) , mostly constructed from catalogs of oh / ir stars ( evolved , visually faint , mass - losing stars with dense circumstellar envelopes , showing , generally double - peaked , oh maser emission ) . interferometric maps of the oh emission in many of the objects of this class ( e.g. bowers et al . 1983 ) show that it typically arises in an extended circular shell of radius @xmath2 cm , indicating that substantial agb mass - loss has occurred through a spherical outflow .",
    "the iras spectral energy distributions ( seds ) of a large fraction of these objects indicate a lack of hot dust ( 25 to 12  flux ratio @xmath3 , implying a lack of dust hotter than about 450k ) , and therefore cessation of the dense agb mass - loss process less than a few hundred years ago .    here",
    "we report on our discoveries of objects with well - resolved geometrical structures from our imaging surveys of pre - planetary nebulae carried out using the hubble space telescope ( hst ) in its snapshot mode . a previous snapshot survey providing images of resolved nebulosities in 21 ppns",
    "was carried out by ueta , meixner & bobrowsky ( 2000 ) .",
    "we use the large sample ( @xmath450 ) of ppns now available ( which includes previously - imaged objects in this class ) to devise a new morphological classification system for this category of objects .",
    "we also derive post - agb and agb mass - loss time - scales , as well as dust masses , for our objects .",
    "the main focus of this paper is the morphology of ppns ; a more comprehensive statistical analysis which includes results on the unresolved and undetected objects in our surveys is deferred to a future paper .",
    "the images presented in this paper were obtained as part of two snapshot survey programs with hst .",
    "the target lists for these programs were generated by selecting sources from published catalogs of oh / ir stars ( te lintel hekkert et al 1988 , 1991 , 1992 , chengalur et al . 1993 , te lintel hekkert & chapman 1996 , hu et al .",

    "a small number of additional objects were selected from the compilation of evolved stars with low - resolution iras spectra by kwok , volk & bidelman ( 1997 ) , subject to the same iras color criterion as for the oh / ir stars .",
    "this subset included carbon - rich ( c - rich ) objects and class h objects ( showing a red continuum with either a 9.7  silicate absorption feature or a 11.3  pah emission feature in their lrs spectra ) .",
    "a 25  flux threshold of 25jy was then imposed in order to exclude relatively distant objects .",
    "this yielded a sample of about 200 objects . the digitized sky survey ( dss )",
    "optical images , available from the online databases maintained by the canadian astronomy data centre , were used to examine a @xmath7arcmin@xmath8 field - of - view around each object in order to check whether any bright field stars were present very close to our target which would make their imaging difficult .",
    "objects for which no visual detection could be made on the dss plates were excluded .",
    "the usno - b.1 and the guide star catalog ii ( gsc - ii ) were queried to determine r magnitudes ; when these were unavailable , a rough assessment of the r magnitude was made from the dss images .",
    "the remaining sample was divided into 3 magnitude bins ( bright : @xmath9 , medium : @xmath10 , and faint : @xmath11 ) , and roughly equal numbers of objects were randomly selected from each bin in order to meet the target limitation of 117 objects for the two survey programs , go9101 ( 17 objects ) and 9463 ( 100 objects ) , described below . a small number of targets which represent the evolutionary phases just preceding and following the ppn phase were also included in these two programs .",
    "both programs were carried out in the snapshot mode of hst in which objects are selected from the program source list to fill gaps in the general observational schedule , thus all objects in the list were not observed .",
    "the first survey program , go 9101 , was a pilot survey with wfpc2 in which 10/17 objects were imaged .",
    "the second , go 9463 , was a more extensive survey in which a total of 58/100 objects were imaged with acs . for go 9101",
    ", we obtained images using the f606w ( @xmath12 , @xmath13 ) & f814w ( @xmath14 , @xmath15 filters , with the 800@xmath16800-pixel planetary camera ( pc ) of wide - field & planetary camera 2 ( wfpc2 ) , which has a plate scale of 00456/pixel . for",
    "go 9463 , we used either the high resolution camera ( hrc ) or the wide - field camera ( wfc ) of the advanced camera for surveys ( acs ) , depending on the optical magnitude of the object .",
    "the hrc has a plate scale of 0025/pixel , and for objects imaged with this camera , we used a combination of the f606w filter ( @xmath12 , @xmath13 ) and the f814w filter ( @xmath14 , @xmath15 ) for the fainter objects , and the f435w ( @xmath17 , @xmath18 ) and f606w filter for the brighter ones .",
    "the wfc has a plate scale of 0050/pixel , and for objects imaged with this camera , we used a combination of the f606w filter and f814w filters .",
    "we also examined the hst archive for additional ppns which met our iras color and flux selection criteria ( and not published previously ) .",
    "we found one such object , iras15553 - 4230 ( go10627 , pi : m. meixner ) which was imaged with the acs / hrc  we have included it in this paper .",
    "some of the objects from go 9463 were also imaged as part of our go 9801 program  a third survey to image optically - faint ppn candidates with camera 1 or 2 of the near infrared camera and multi - object spectrometer ( nicmos ) using two or three of the f110w ( @xmath19 , @xmath20 ) , f160w ( @xmath21 , @xmath22 ) and f205w ( @xmath23 , @xmath24 ) filters .",
    "the complete results of this survey , which did not yield resolved images of any new ppn , will be discussed separately ; in this paper we utilise the nicmos images when available for providing additional details on the morphology .",
    "we have listed the sources in our survey in table[t1 ] , with their 2mass coordinates .",
    "the images of all resolved objects are shown in figs.[fig1aa]-[fig11 ] .",
    "optical spectroscopy , allowing spectral types of the central stars to be determined ( either from the direct starlight if the central star is visible , and/or from the starlight scattered by nebular dust ) , is not available for all of our objects .",
    "however , we have carried out spectroscopic surveys of partially - overlapping samples of candidate ppns selected in the same manner as for our imaging surveys , using the palomar 60-inch ( sahai & snchez contreras 2002 , 2004 ) and keck 10-m telescopes ( snchez contreras et al .",
    "2003 , snchez contreras et al .",
    "2007 , in preparation ) , and we find that the observed objects do not show the rich emission - line spectra characteristic of planetary nebulae .",
    "for those objects where spectral types have been determined , either by us or others , the spectral types obtained typically span the b , a , f , and g spectral types , which are the typical spectral types for post - agb central stars .",
    "the majority of our objects are oxygen - rich ( o - rich ) due to their selection from oh - maser catalogs .",
    "information about the source chemistry is provided in the descriptions of individual ppns in  [ srcs ] .",
    "the ppns in our survey show a variety of morphologies . we therefore describe a systematic method of classifying these . in this morphological classification system",
    ", we have taken care to avoid using criteria that are based on a 3-dimensional interpretation of the nebular structures whose 2-dimensional projection is observed in our images .",
    "the main structural components of ppns in order of importance are the lobes , the waist , and the halo .",
    "hence , we classify our objects into various morphological classes with the prime discriminant being the lobe structure . the presence or absence of a waist and halo",
    "are included as secondary descriptors .",
    "the classification system is described below , and the classification codes are summarised in table[t2 ] . in table[t3 ] , we apply these codes to the objects from our survey , and in table[t4 ] , to previously imaged ppns .    first , we divide the observed primary morphologies into 4 major classes  bipolar ( b ) , multipolar ( m ) , elongated ( e ) , and irregular ( i ) .",
    "there is no class referring to round shapes , because we have not found any object in which the central post - agb structure appears round .",
    "the  bipolar \" or b shape is defined by objects which show two primary , diametrically opposed lobes , centered on the central star ( or center of mass if a binary system ) or its expected location ( e.g. , iras13557 - 6442 , fig.[fig2a ] ; iras15452 - 5459 , fig.[fig3 ] ) .",
    "the pair of lobes must have apinched in \" shape in the region around the center from where they emanate , and/or the lobes should be visible on both sides of a minimum - light - intensity central region ( presumably due to an obscuring dust lane , see below ) .",
    "the  multipolar \" or m shape is defined by objects having more than one primary lobe on either side of the center ( iras19024 + 0044 , fig.[fig6ab ] ; iras19475 + 3119 , fig.[fig8a ] ) .",
    "the  elongated \" or e shape is simply one which is elongated along a specific axis , i.e. , is not round ( e.g. , iras17253 - 2831 , fig.[fig4a ] ; iras18420 - 0512 , fig.[fig6a ] ) .",
    "the  irregular \" or i shape is defined by objects in which extended circumstellar structure can be seen , but where no obvious lobe or shell - like structures can be identified , and which therefore do not fit in any of the previous categories ( e.g. , iras11385 - 5517 , fig.[fig1aa ] ) . as the name implies , objects in the i category usually do not display axial or point - reflection symmetry .",
    "secondary structural features are denoted with lower - case letters following the major class .",
    "first , we add subclassifications which are related to the lobes in the b , m , or e classes  these may be open ( i.e. , like a vase ) or closed ( i.e. , having a bubble - structure ) at their outer ends , and are denoted by @xmath25 or @xmath26 . for sources where",
    "the morphology is not sufficiently well - resolved or the images are too noisy to make the @xmath25 or @xmath26 determination , this subclassification is not mentioned . for multipolar ( i.e. , m ) objects , where it is possible in principle to have some lobes which are open and some which are closed , both @xmath25 and @xmath26 should be used .",
    "some ppns show bright , compact knots in diametrically - opposed pairs , normally referred to as ansae ( e.g. as in iras09371 + 1212 , the frosty leo nebula : morris & reipurth 1990 , sahai et al .",
    "2000a )  these are denoted by @xmath27 .",
    "sometimes minor lobes can be seen , at low or intermediate latitudes , as , e.g. in the egg nebula ( sahai et al .",
    "1998a ) , and the frosty leo nebula  these are denoted by @xmath28 .",
    "the presence of a skirt - like structure around the primary lobes ( as , e.g. , in hen3 - 401 , sahai , bujarrabal , & zijlstra 1999a ) is denoted by @xmath29 .",
    "this structure is an illuminated surface lying outside the primary bipolar lobes but with the same axis of symmetry ; the skirt has a larger opening angle than the primary lobes , and while it surrounds these lobes it does not have as large a radial extent .",
    "skirt structures are most easily discerned when the nebular axis is near the plane of the sky .",
    "but if the nebular axis is sufficiently inclined towards us , it may become difficult to distinguish between a waist with a sharp edge and a skirt .",
    "we discuss this issue in s[discus - hw ] .",
    "if there is a dark obscuring band that cuts across the center of the nebula ( i.e. a minimum in an intensity cut taken along the primary long axis of the nebula , and usually described as the  waist \" of the nebula ) , its presence is denoted by @xmath30 .",
    "the dusty waist may be due to ( i ) an opaque dust torus that blocks light that arises or is scattered from a central region , or ( ii ) a disk that never allows light from the central star to emerge in directions near the equatorial plane .",
    "however , our morphological classification does not distinguish between these possibilities .    for several ppns",
    ", the waist appears to have a sharp outer ( radial ) edge or boundary  we denote this by adding @xmath31 after @xmath30 .",
    "this outer boundary can show up in two different ways .",
    "the first , and more common , way is when the boundary is seen as a dark , convex ( relative to the center of the nebula ) edge cutting across one of the primary lobes ] .",
    "a prime example of a well - studied ppn with such a  dark - edged \" waist is the egg nebula ( sahai et al .",
    "1998a ) ; in our study we also find clear examples in , e.g. , iras19024 + 0044 ( fig.[fig6ab ] ) , iras19292 + 1806 ( fig.[fig7a ] ) , & iras22036 + 5306 ( fig.[fig8c ] ) .",
    "the second way is when the waist boundary smoothly transitions from a dark feature seen against the bright lobes to a brightness feature seen against the sky ( or faint nebular ) background in equatorial regions on either sides of the lobes .",
    "the best examples of this phenomenon are provided by iras17106 - 3046 ( kwok et al . 2000 ) and iras04296 + 3429 ( sahai 1999 , but see oppenheimer et al .",
    "2005 for a different interpretation ) .    if the central star can be observed ( in any of the optical filters commonly used with hst for imaging ppns ) , we add the symbol @xmath32 .",
    "next , if there is evidence for point - symmetry in the nebular structure , we denote it by @xmath33 .",
    "this classification is not applied to axially symmetric objects , even though axial symmetry is a special case of point - symmetry .",
    "the point - symmetry can be of three general types : ( i ) the presence of 2 or more pairs of diametrically - opposed lobes , denoted as @xmath34 ( e.g. iras19475 + 3119 , fig.[fig8a ] ) , ( ii ) the ansae are distributed point - symmetrically about the center ( e.g. as in frosty leo ) , denoted as @xmath27 , and ( iii ) the overall geometrical shape of the lobes is point - symmetric ( e.g. hen3 - 1475 ) , denoted as @xmath35 .",
    "these three types of point - symmetry are listed in parentheses after the @xmath33 symbol , e.g. , @xmath36 means a nebula which is point - symmetric by virtue of having 2 or more pairs of diametrically - opposed lobes .",
    "an object may possess more than one type of point symmetry : e.g. , iras19024 + 0044 s point - symmetry would be represented as @xmath37 since it shows both the presence of pairs of diametrically - opposed lobes , as well as ansae in one of the lobe pairs which are point - symmetric ( sahai et al . 2005 ) .",
    "the presence of a halo is denoted with @xmath38 , and an @xmath39 is added after it if it has a non - round , or elongated shape .",
    "if the halo shape can not be determined reasonably ( e.g. , if the halo is rather tenuous and the source lies in a field with bright nearby stars , as in the case of iras17543 - 3102 ) , we add @xmath40 meaning that the shape is indeterminate .",
    "thus the default halo shape is assumed to be round .",
    "the presence of arc - like structures in the halo , as for example seen in the egg nebula ( sahai et al .",
    "1998b ) , is denoted by @xmath41 .",
    "note that a halo may have a smaller visible radial extent than the nebular lobes in the images shown .",
    "however , this does not necessarily imply that the physical radius to which the halo can be detected is smaller than the lobes , it is a result of the more rapid radial decrease of the halo surface brightness compared to the lobes .",
    "with azimuthal averaging , the halo can be traced to radii beyond the radial extents of the lobes .    in a few bipolar ppns , searchlight - beams which appear to emanate from the center ,",
    "can be seen illuminating parts of the halo at high latitudes around the polar axis .",
    "although the best example of this phenomenon is provided by the egg nebula ( sahai et al .",
    "1998b ) , similar features have been seen in four other ppns  iras20028 + 3910 ( hrivnak et al .",
    "2001 ) , iras17150 - 3224 ( su et al . 2003 ) , iras17245 - 3951 ( hrivnak et al . 1999 ) and iras18276 - 1431 .",
    "note that in our system , the m or multipolar classification does not necessarily imply the point - symmetric sub - class , denoted by @xmath34 , even though for the two m objects in our survey , iras19024 + 0044 and iras19475 + 3119 , the lobes appear in diametrically - opposed ( i.e. point - symmetric ) pairs .",
    "the reason for this is that it may be possible for objects to have multiple lobes , all of which can not be unambiguously grouped into diametrically - opposed pairs .",
    "specific examples of such objects are the starfish twins ( he 2 - 47 and m1 - 37 ) , two young planetary nebulae with multiple lobes described by sahai ( 2000 ) .    similarly , the b or bipolar classification does not necessarily imply @xmath30 ( i.e. , the presence of a dusty waist ) , even though most b objects have dusty waists .",
    "specific examples of objects which are bipolar , but do nt show dusty waists in their images , are , iras17440 - 3310 ( fig.[fig5a ] ) and iras19306 + 1407 ( fig.[fig7b ] ) .",
    "it is possible that these objects do have a dusty waist , but the waist is sufficiently tilted away from an edge - on orientation , and hence does not appear as an intensity - minimum between the two lobes .",
    "we have applied the above system to some of the most well - resolved and best - studied ppns to ensure that it captures the important morphological characteristiscs of these objects .",
    "thus , the egg nebula has the classification bcw(b),ml , h(e , a , sb ) ; frosty leo is bcw(b ) * , an , ml , ps(m , an , s ) ; minkowski s footprint , m1 - 92 ( e.g. bujarrabal et al .",
    "1998 ) is bcw(b)*,an ; and hen3 - 401 is bow*,sk ( sahai , bujarrabal & zijlstra 1999a ) .",
    "the water - fountain ppn , iras16342 - 3814 ( sahai et al .",
    "1999b ) is classified as bcw , ps(s ) .",
    "we have estimated the distances to our survey sources ( d@xmath42 ) assuming a fixed luminosity of 6000  for each object , rather than using kinematic distances determined from radial velocities because these objects can quite often have large and peculiar motions relative to the general galactic rotation .",
    "both the above choices have been motivated by a vlba proper motion study of the young ppn , iras19134 + 2131 . for this object , imai , sahai & morris ( 2007 ) determine a trigonometric parallax distance of @xmath43kpc , giving a luminosity of 5500 , and a galactic rotation velocity of @xmath1125 , much slower than that given by the galactic rotation curve at iras19134 + 2131 s location .",
    "our choice of a fixed luminosity in our computations is not meant to imply that all ppns have this same value of the luminosity , but simply to provide a convenient normalisation factor for the ages and masses .",
    "the values of these parameters can then be conveniently scaled in future studies when better distance determinations of individual objects become available .",
    "the bolometric fluxes have been computed for each object by integrating the sed from the optical to far - infrared wavelengths , using published optical , jhk - band , msx and iras fluxes . for all objects where the central star is not visible",
    ", the total flux for wavelengths @xmath44  is quite small . in objects where the central star is visible",
    ", this short - wavelength flux can make a significant contribution to the bolometric flux , hence our luminosity determination is somewhat affected by the unknown amount of interstellar extinction . for each ppn",
    ", we have estimated the radial extent of the central aspherical structure ( in arcseconds ) , which presumably represents the post - agb mass - loss ( @xmath45 ) , and the radial extent of the halo ( in arcseconds ) surrounding this structure ( when it is present ) , which presumably represents the agb mass - loss(@xmath46 ) .",
    "for closed lobes , @xmath45 is measured radially outwards from the geometrical center of the nebula ( or the central star , when visible ) out to the most distant lobe structure along the lobe axis .",
    "if the lobes are  open \" at their ends , then @xmath45 is defined as the radial offset of the most distant point on the lobe . if several lobes are present , or if the lobes on either side of the center have different lengths , the longest one is selected . for objects classified as i , i.e. when",
    "lobe structures are not visible , @xmath45 is defined as the radius to the most distant non - spherical structure .",
    "we have used azimuthal averaging to measure radial extent of the halos where it reaches the background - subtracted sky level and starts showing large fluctuations ( either due to noise and/or the presence of many faint stars ) ] .",
    "the azimuthal averages are done carefully in order to avoid the angular regions which are occupied by the nebular lobes .",
    "if a halo can not be detected , we make the reasonable assumption that @xmath47 , motivated by the fact that the lobes result from the interaction of a fast agb wind with a surrounding agb envelope .",
    "a post - agb time - scale , @xmath48 , is derived by converting @xmath45 from angular units to linear units using the luminosity - based distances , and dividing it by a nominal outflow speed of 150(which is typical of the outflow speeds derived for the lobes of individual well - studied ppns ) , since individual outflow speeds for the material in the lobes of most objects have not been measured as yet , nor are the inclination angles of the lobe axes well known . in objects with a halo , an agb mass - ejection time - scale ( @xmath49 ) ] is computed by dividing the linear radius of the halo ( @xmath50 ) by the expansion velocity as derived from molecular line data ( either oh 18 cm maser line or co millimeter - wave line emission ) . since the outer radius of the halo is most likely determined by the steadily decreasing halo surface - brightness falling below the noise ( due to a decrease in density as well as central illumination ) , @xmath46 , and correspondingly , @xmath49 , should be understood as lower limits . by using azimuthal averaging , we can trace the halos out to significantly larger radial distances than possible with pencil - cuts of the intensity .",
    "the values of @xmath46 given in table[t3 ] thus found are typically much larger than can be seen in the displayed images , where the intensity scales and stretches are chosen in order to display the central aspherical structures most clearly .",
    "we have fitted the sed of each object from the near - infrared ( k - band ) to the far - infrared ( as defined by msx and iras fluxes ) using a multi - component model ( sahai et al .",
    "a power - law ( @xmath51 , with @xmath52=1.5 ) dust emissivity with a value of 150 cm@xmath8g@xmath54 ( per unit _ dust _ mass ) at 60 @xmath55 m ( jura 1986 ) is used to fit the sed with a ",
    "cool \" , a  warm \" , and a  hot \" component .",
    "the mass of the cool component , which is robustly fitted since the bulk of the emission comes from cool dust , is significantly larger than the other two components .",

    "comparison of the results of our simple models with those utilising radiative transfer codes to determine the temperature distribution in detail ( e.g. , for iras19475 + 3119 ) indicate that the simple model gives dust masses that are lower than the more accurate values , by a factor 0.6 - 0.8 .",

    "the cylindrical lobes are significantly more extended as seen in the 2mass images : e.g. , the k - band image ( fig.[fig1b ] ) shows that the brighter ( southern ) lobe extends to about 247 along the nebular axis , compared to about 157 in the hst f814w image .",
    "the dusty waist has a flared shape in the k - band image , compared to the f814w image , where its edge bordering the southwest lobe is quite straight .",

    "we find that the msx and 2mass sources identified with the iras source are located at the position of knot _ sa _ , indicating that it is associated with the stellar source powering an outflow that produces the knots _ k14_. a 1612 mhz oh maser source was discovered towards iras05506 with the arecibo dish ( chengalur et al .",
    "1993 )  the profile is not the typical double - peaked profile seen towards most dying stars .",
    "the main lines at 1665,67 mhz were detected by lewis ( 1997 ) with peak fluxes of 300 and 150 mjy using arecibo ; the emission covers about 15  in the 1612 mhz line and @xmath140 - 45  in the main lines .",
    "if iras05506 is not associated with an evolved star , but instead is a young stellar object ( yso ) , then the oh maser observations argue for it not being a low - mass yso , since there are no known oh masers toward low - mass ysos .",
    "so if it is a yso , it must be related to a high - mass star - formation region ( sfr ) , suggesting the presence of an ultra - compact hii region with detectable continuum emission .",
    "however , the nvss vla all sky survey at 20 cm shows no continuum source towards iras05506 down to an rms noise of @xmath1400 @xmath55jy / beam . could iras05506 then really be a ppn , but with a morphology which has never been seen before in ppns or pns ?",
    "while this an improbable hypothesis , it is not implausible , considering that not so long ago , sahai & nyman ( 2000 ) discovered a planetary nebula with a bipolar , knotty jet , bearing an uncanny resemblance to jets seen in low - mass ysos .",
    "a detailed discussion of the nature of iras05506 is outside the scope of this paper ; but will be presented , together with new optical , millimeter - wave and radio data in a forthcoming paper ( sahai et al .",
    "2007 , in preparation ) .",
    "the morphological scheme we have presented in this paper is based on the ppns in our survey and on additional well - studied ppns outside our sample .",
    "our ppn survey sample is a well - defined sample , but it is not a complete sample . we have listed in table 4 all ppns with high - resolution images in the literature outside our sample and we find that all of these can be accomodated within our classification scheme .",
    "thus , tables 3 and 4 list all known galactic ppns with existing high - resolution images  a total of 53 objects . many of the objects in table 4 are taken from the ppn survey by ueta et al .",
    "these authors classify ppns as either sole ( objects with bright central star embedded in a faint extended nebulosity ) or duplex ( objects with bipolar shapes with a completely or partially obscured central star ) , and suggest that the _ axisymmetry _ in ppns is created by an equatorially enhanced superwind at the end of the agb phase . in view of the many very strong departures from axisymmetry in a very significant fraction of the full sample of ppns",
    ", we do not think that the ueta et al .",
    "classification provides a sufficiently complete framework for classifying the morphologies of ppns .",
    "the wide variety of morphologies which we have found are qualitatively similar to those found for young planetary nebulae in a previous hst survey ( e.g. , sahai & trauger 1998 , sahai 2000 , sahai 2003 ) and other ground - based studies .",
    "in particular , we find multipolar objects like iras19024 + 0044 , which closely resemble the  starfish twins \"  two young pns with multiple lobes ( sahai 2000 ) .",
    "the quadrupolar object , iras19475 + 3119 , probably belongs to the class of quadrupolar planetary nebulae first identified by manchado , stanghellini & guerrero ( 1991 ) . in the",
    " bipolar \" class , the cylindrical lobe shape together with the associated very dense waist found in iras13428 - 6232 , is very similar to that of the well - studied pn ic4406 ( e.g. , sahai et al .",
    "the ( bipolar ) hourglass - shaped ppn , iras15452 - 5459 , resembles hourglass - shaped pn like mycn18 ( sahai et al .",
    "1999c ) and hb12 ( sahai & trauger 1998 ) .",
    "there are a few ppns which are best described as elongated ( class e ) .",
    "if the elongated morphology of these objects is because they have prolate ellipsoidal shapes , then we expect that they will evolve into the category of pns which have been classified as elliptical in morphological schemes for pns ( e.g. , corradi & schwarz 1995 ) .",
    "alternatively , these may be intrinsically bipolar but with ( i ) the polar axis sufficiently tilted towards us so that it is difficult to see the pinching - in of the lobes at their bases , or ( ii ) insufficiently resolved so that the pinching - in of the lobes at the base is not visible .",
    "a good example of possibility ( i ) is provided by iras18420 - 0512 ( fig.[fig6a ] ) , where the northwest lobe shows some evidence for being pinched - in on its northeastern periphery . as in the case of our surveys of young pns with hst ( sahai & trauger 1998 , sahai 2003 )",
    ", we found no round ppns .",
    "the similarity in morphologies between all ppns observed with high spatial resolution and young pns strongly indicates that ( i ) the former are the progenitors of aspherical planetary nebulae , and ( ii ) the onset of aspherical structure begins during the ppn phase ( or earlier ) .",
    "thus , the primary shaping of a pn clearly does not occur during the pn phase via the fast radiative wind of the hot central star , but significantly earlier in its evolution .",
    "the morphological system for ppns which we have presented can be adapted for young pns directly .",
    "the broad - band optical ( and near - infrared ) images of ppns show light scattered off dust grains in the circumstellar material .",
    "the interaction of the fast collimated wind from the central star of the ppn with the slowly - expanding , spherical , agb mass - loss envelope , produces lobes with dense walls which consist mostly of swept - up agb wind material .",
    "the walls are overdense with respect to both the interiors and the exteriors of the lobes .",
    "the shapes of the nebular lobes , which are the brightest regions of ppns , thus represent the shapes of the dense walls of the lobes , since the interiors of the lobes are tenuous as demonstrated by the frequent presence of limb - brightening in the lobes .",
    "this basic structure of the lobes in ppns is reproduced in numerical simulations by lee & sahai ( 2003 ) .",
    "when the central star becomes hot enough to substantially ionise the circumstellar material , the nebular walls then appear as bright features in h@xmath57 and forbidden - line emission ( e.g. [ nii]@xmath816548,6583 ) .",
    "note that because the optical - line emission is proportional to @xmath82 , and thus , @xmath83 ( where @xmath84 and @xmath85 are the electron and total density and @xmath86 is the path length ) , whereas scattered - light intensity is proportional to @xmath87 , generally the brightness contrast between the nebular walls and its surroundings is likely to be higher for pns than for ppns .",
    "the lobe morphology , both in the ppn and pn phase , is a direct indicator of the geometrical shapes of the dense lobe walls , and therefore of the wind - wind interaction process which created them .",
    "the only distinction which needs to be kept in mind when modifying the ppn classification scheme for pns is related to the appearance of the waist region . since most surveys of pns have been carried out in emission - line filters , the waist quite often ( but not always ) appears as a bright feature , rather than a dark feature .",
    "hence , unlike the case of ppns , in our classification of young pns , we will not define the waist in terms of a minimum in intensity along the long axis of the nebula .",
    "indeed , the waist is often the brightest structural component of a bipolar or multipolar planetary nebula , which is understandable if we assume that the waist region has much more mass than the lobes .",
    "note also that if the waist region is in expansion , then it will continue to flow radially outward from the star as a ppn evolves into a pn .",
    "the central regions of pns with waists are thus , in general , expected to be more exposed and visible than those of the ppns from which they evolve .",
    "of course , very young pns such as iras22568 + 6141 ( fig.[fig11 ] ) and k3 - 35 ( fig.[figk3 - 35 ] ) still have optically - thick waists fully or partially obscuring their central stars . a detailed morphological classification of the young pns from the hst surveys described in sahai & trauger ( 1998 ) and sahai ( 2003 ) , which are presumably most closely related to ppns in an evolutionary sense , will be presented in a future paper ( sahai & morris 2007 , in preparation ) .",
    "the  total \" sample of ppns with resolved morphologies listed in tables 3 & 4 ( our survey plus previously observed ones ) includes objects with both oxygen - rich and carbon - rich chemistries , as well as a few which display mixed chemistry ( i.e. , show features representative of both carbon - rich and oxygen - rich chemistry ) .",
    "although o - rich objects outnumber the c - rich ones , there is a substantial fraction of the latter ( about 25% ) . since the ratio of dusty o - rich stars to dusty c - rich stars , as estimated from a sample drawn from the iras psc , is about 9 ( thronson et al .",
    "1987 ) , and these objects are presumably the progenitors of dusty ppns , c - rich ppns are certainly not under - represented in our total sample of ppns relative to their parent population . within the total ppn sample , there does not appear to be any significant correlation of morphology with nebular chemistry .",
    "the variety of lobe shapes and structures seen in young pns led to a new model by sahai & trauger ( 1998 ) for pn shaping , in which fast collimated outflows , operating during the ppn or very late agb phase , are the primary agents in producing aspherical planetary nebulae . hence , our morphological classification system puts considerable emphasis on including descriptors which are related to the shapes , structures and symmetries of the lobes .",
    "an important example of this emphasis is the fairly detailed characterisation of point - symmetry in our classification scheme , based on the recognition that various sub - types of point - symmetry impose fairly strong constraints on specific formation mechanisms .",
    "this has been discussed in detail by sahai et al .",
    "( 2005 ) in a study of the ppn , iras19024 + 0044 .",
    "briefly , the m and ps(m ) classification of this object suggests a precessing _ bipolar _ jet , in which the fast outflow could be in the form of discrete blobs ejected in discontinuous episodes , or a high - velocity jet that discontinuously changes direction , leading to the sculpting of multiple lobes in different directions within the ambient agb envelope .",
    "the presence of point - symmetric ansae at the tips of one of the lobe pairs , represented by the ps(an ) descriptor , requires that the collimated outflow which produced these lobes must have changed its axis during its operation , although by much less than the angular separation between lobes .",
    "thus the physical mechanism(s ) which produces the collimated outflows must be able to accomodate two different time - scales , one associated with generating the point - symmetrical ansae within a lobe - pair , and one associated with generating the point - symmetrically distributed multiple lobes .",
    "the @xmath25 and @xmath26 secondary classifiers ( related to whether lobes are open or closed at their ends , respectively ) provide another example of descriptors that raise some important questions related to the dynamical interactions believed to shape ppns .",
    "generally , post - agb collimated winds or jets interacting with agb circumstellar envelopes ( e.g. , lee & sahai 2003 ) will produce closed lobes as the fast wind sweeps up the ambient cse material in front of it .",
    "if the density of the ambient material falls sufficiently rapidly with radius ( e.g. , as r@xmath88 or more steeply , perhaps even in a discontinous manner ) , and/or the fast wind turns off , reducing the ram pressure compressing the dense material at the tip of the lobe , the compressed layer will expand due to thermal pressure .",
    "secondly , fragmentation of the compresed layer due to hydrodynamic instabilities may also occur . as a result of the above two effects",
    ", the end of the lobe could dissipate and become undetectable , leading to the open - lobe appearance .",
    "the bipolar ppn hen3 - 401 , which shows lobes with tattered ends ( sahai et al .",
    "1999c ) , is a possible example of fragmentation of the lobe - ends due to instabilities .",
    "but hourglass - shaped bipolar ppns such as iras13557 ( fig.[fig2a ] ) and iras15452 ( fig.[fig3 ] ) which have wide - open ends , show no obvious evidence of fragmented clumpy material .",
    "furthermore , if @xmath26 lobes evolve into @xmath25 lobes over time then we would expect the former to have systematically smaller values of @xmath89 than the latter , but this does not seem to be the case from an inspection of our results in table 3 ( note , however , that our sample is still too small to make this a robust conclusion ) . perhaps magnetic fields stabilize the lobe walls against fragmentation in some objects and not others , depending on the field strength and configuration . to summarise , a theoretical investigation of issues related to the formation of open and closed lobes using , e.g. , numerical hydrodynamic simulations , is thus quite important for our general understanding of the formation of aspherical structure in ppns .      the prominent halos surrounding the central aspherical shapes seen in many of our objects are direct signatures of the undisturbed circumstellar envelopes of the progenitor agb stars .",
    "the halos generally have round or elongated shapes .",
    "it is quite plausible that objects with elongated haloes have agb envelopes which are intrinsically round , but appear elongated because they are either being indirectly illuminated by the lobes , or the light from the central source can not get out to the larger distances at low latitudes .",
    "the majority of these have surface - brightness distributions consistent with a constant mass - loss rate with a constant expansion velocity ( e.g. , iras17253 - 2831 , iras17440 - 3310 , iras18420 - 0512 , iras19024 + 0044 ) .",
    "but there are also examples of objects with varying mass - loss rates , with instances of both where the mass - loss rate was higher ( iras23304 + 6147 ) , and lower ( e.g. , iras19475 + 3119 ) , in the past .",
    "three objects ( iras20000 + 3239 , 22036 + 5306 & 23304 + 6147 ) show halos which require a 2-piece segmented power - law to describe the surface brightness .",
    "this implies somewhat discontinuous changes in the agb mass - loss rate , if we assume that the envelope expansion velocity has remained constant for the surface brightness in the outer region , because if radial extinction was important , it would have an even more dramatic effect on steepening the power - law in the inner region ] . comparing the three objects",
    ", we find the interesting result that in all of these , the power - law in the outer ( inner ) region is steeper ( shallower ) than that for a constant mass - loss rate .",
    "the implication is that for these objects , the mass - loss rate went through a maximum , first increasing over a period of @xmath13800 - 4800yr , and then decreasing .",
    "a significant fraction of preplanetary nebulae appear to have an optically thick concentration of dust in their equatorial plane , i.e. , a waist .",
    "we refer to this dust distribution as a disk , setting aside the question of whether it is a bound , orbiting disk , or an equatorial concentration of dust in an outflowing wind .",
    "we have noted in our classification scheme that , in quite a few ppns , the disk has a sharp radial edge , that is , a discontinuity in the extinction projected against the extended emission from the reflection nebula .",
    "the curvature of this discontinuity is typically convex relative to the nebula s center of symmetry , consistent with its being caused by radial structure in an axisymmetric disk .",
    "this result carries interesting implications about the geometry of the disk . for the simple case of a bipolar nebula , for example , a sharp edge projected against",
    "the far lobe is a strong indication that the disk is density bounded at its outside edge .",
    "the sharp edge to the waist in that case is most likely due to the abrupt radial termination of the disk .",
    "if the surface density of dust in the disk were to fall off monotonically without an abrupt falloff ( e.g. , as @xmath90 for a disk that is radially outflowing at constant velocity and constant mass loss rate ) , then the edge would be relatively diffuse .",
    "these remarks apply to a situation in which the disk scale height increases with radius as would be expected for an outflowing disk .",
    "examples of sharp edges are found in the well - studied ppns such as afgl 2688 ( sahai et al .",
    "1998a ) , and in our sample objects iras19292 + 1806 ( fig.[fig7a ] ) and iras22036 + 5306 ( fig.[fig8c ] ) .",
    "determination of which lobe of a bipolar nebula is the far lobe can be done by appeal to the kinematics ; the rear lobe is the redshifted lobe .",
    "it is usually , though not always , the dimmer or more absorbed lobe because of extinction by the disk , but this is not a reliable indicator because the lobes may be intrinsically asymmetric ( e.g. , oh231.8 + 4.2 ) .",
    "we note that it is possible to have a sharp edge against the near lobe of a bipolar ppn if several conditions are met : 1 ) the disk has a sharp surface boundary , 2 ) the scale height of the disk density distribution rises linearly or less rapidly than linearly with radius , and 3 ) the observer s line of sight is approximately tangent to that surface .",
    "the last condition implies that the observer be viewing the system from near the equatorial plane , which , in any case , is the best vantage point from which to be able to identify such a system as a bipolar or multipolar nebula .",
    "it is also possible for the disk geometry to be arranged so that it gives a sharp edge against the far lobe even if the disk does not have a sharp outer boundary .",
    "the conditions for that , however , are quite restrictive : 1 ) a sharp disk surface boundary , 2 ) a disk scale height that reaches a maximum at some radius at which the disk is still optically thick , and 3 ) the observer s line of sight be tangent to the disk at the point where the disk reaches its maximum scale height . while this is possible , it is not well motivated physically , so we regard any object that shows a sharp radial edge projected against the far lobe as a case in which the disk has a sharp outer boundary .",
    "the inferred sharp outer boundary to the disks in a number of systems can most easily be explained by an abrupt transition in mass loss geometry from spherically symmetric to an axisymmetric geometry having some combination of a latitude - dependent mass loss rate and a latitude - dependent outflow velocity .",
    "models for such a transition can be based on the presence of a close binary companion ( e.g. , morris 1987 , 1990 ) or on the emergence of a strong stellar magnetic field after mass loss has stripped away enough of the overlying stellar atmosphere ( blackman et al .",
    "2001a , b ) .",
    "these issues will be discussed in a separate paper .",
    "it is important to note that waists with sharp outer edges may not be distinguishable from skirt structures if the nebular axis is sufficiently inclined towards us .",
    "an example of this is provided by hen3 - 1475 ( fig.[he3 - 1475 ] ) .",
    "a color image combining images taken through the f555w and f814w filters with wfpc2 clearly demarcates the waist / skirt structure  most prominently defined by a relatively red , sharp - edged elliptical band ( feature labelled @xmath91 in inset , fig.[he3 - 1475 ] ) which cuts sharply across the south - east or far lobe . south - east of @xmath91 ,",
    "one can see a bluer structure whose outer edge is a partial ellipse ( @xmath92 in inset ) which joins @xmath91 near the equatorial plane .",
    "an apparent cusp can be seen on the south - west side of the nebula where @xmath91 and @xmath92 meet , suggesting a skirt structure for these features . however , since this cusp feature is not well - defined , and its counterpart on the north - east side is not apparent , we can not definitively argue for the presence of a skirt in hen3 - 1475 .    the central obscuring structure in oh231.8 + 4.2 ( fig.[oh231.8 ] ) is quite similar to that of hen3 - 1475 , with its near - side seen as an obscuring elliptical band , partially cutting across the south - west nebular lobe and partially seen as a bright structure projected against the sky background ( feature labelled @xmath93 ) .",
    "its far - side counterpart is seen most clearly as a bright structure against the sky background on the eastern and western flanks of the bright south - eastern nebular lobe ( @xmath94 ) .",
    "the skirt - shape can be inferred from the cusp resulting from the intersection of the projected edges of @xmath93 and @xmath94 on the north - western side of the nebula ; a similar cusp can be seen somewhat less clearly on the south - eastern side .",
    "a quantitative analysis of the colors in the central region of these objects may help in better elucidating the structural relationship between the waist and skirt features .",
    "using the hubble space telescope , we have carried out a survey of a well - defined set of candidate preplanetary nebulae .",
    "we present images of 22 new ppn and 1 nascent ppn with well - resolved geometrical structures . combining this sample of ppns with previously studied objects in this class ,",
    "we have devised a comprehensive new morphological classification system for this class of objects .",
    "we summarize our major findings below :    \\(1 ) we have found a wide variety of aspherical morphologies which include bipolar and multipolar shapes , many of which display point - symmetries by virtue of their shapes and/or structures .",
    "this variety of morphologies is qualitatively similar to those found for young planetary nebulae in previous surveys . as in the case of our surveys of young planetary nebulae ( pns )",
    ", we found no round ppns .",
    "\\(2 ) we also find prominent halos , surrounding the central aspherical shapes , in many of our objects ",
    "these are direct signatures of the undisturbed circumstellar envelopes of the progenitor agb stars .",
    "the majority of these have surface - brightness distributions consistent with a constant mass - loss rate at a constant outflow velocity .",
    "but 3 objects require a segmented power - law to describe the surface brightness indicating that in these objects , the agb mass - loss rate went through a maximum , first increasing over a period of @xmath13800 - 4800yr , and then decreasing .",
    "\\(3 ) we have estimated the physical sizes of the aspherical nebulae and the halos .",
    "distances have been derived by measuring the bolometric flux of each object from its sed , and using a fixed luminosity of 6000 . a time - scale for the duration of the post - agb mass - loss ( @xmath89 ) and a lower limit to the time - scale for agb mass - loss ( @xmath49 ) ,",
    "have been derived from the expansion ages of the aspherical nebulae and the haloes , respectively , by making simplifying assumptions about the expansion speeds of the nebular material .",
    "a rather wide range of time - scales is found in both cases : @xmath89 lies in the range ( 301660)yr , with a median age of 180yr , and @xmath49 lies in the range ( 30014700)yr , with a median age of 6650yr .",
    "\\(4 ) we have computed dust masses by fitting the sed of each object from the near - infrared ( k - band ) to the far - infrared ( as defined by msx and iras fluxes ) using a simple multi - component model .",
    "the mass of the coolest component dominates the mass budget for each object .",
    "the dust masses cover the range @xmath95 ; the corresponding total masses , assuming a typical gas - to - dust ratio of 200 , are @xmath96 .",
    "\\(6 ) the similarities in morphologies between our survey objects and young pns supports the view that the former are the progenitors of aspherical planetary nebulae , and the onset of aspherical structure begins during the ppn phase ( or earlier ) . thus ,",

    "<S> using the hubble space telescope ( hst ) , we have carried out a survey of candidate preplanetary nebulae ( ppns ) . </S>",
    "<S> we report here our discoveries of objects having well - resolved geometrical structures , and use the large sample of ppns now imaged with hst ( including previously studied objects in this class ) to devise a comprehensive morphological classification system for this category of objects . </S>",
    "<S> the wide variety of aspherical morphologies which we have found for ppns are qualitatively similar to those found for young planetary nebulae in previous surveys . </S>",
    "<S> we also find prominent halos surrounding the central aspherical shapes in many of our objects  these are direct signatures of the undisturbed circumstellar envelopes of the progenitor agb stars . </S>",
    "<S> although the majority of these have surface - brightness distributions consistent with a constant mass - loss rate with a constant expansion velocity , there are also examples of objects with varying mass - loss rates . as in our surveys of young planetary nebulae ( pns ) , we find no round ppns . the similarities in morphologies between our survey objects and young pns supports the view that the former are the progenitors of aspherical planetary nebulae , and that the onset of aspherical structure begins during the ppn phase ( or earlier ) . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the primary shaping of a pn clearly does not occur during the pn phase via the fast radiative wind of the hot central star , but significantly earlier in its evolution . </S>"
