    "observationally , agb stars show a clear signature of ongoing -nucleosynthesis . among",
    "the evidence is the detection of the radioactively unstable element tc ( merill 1952 ) .",
    "its longest living isotope , @xmath9tc , has a half - life of @xmath10 which clearly exceeds the life time of a thermally pulsing agb star .",
    "thus , any detected tc must have been produced _ in situ_. more evidence comes , e.g. , from the correlation of heavy element abundances ( like the index [ hs / ls ] ) with metallicity ( busso et al .  1999 ) or with the fluorine abundance ( jorissen et al .",
    "another source of information are pre - solar dust grains from meteorites .",
    "most of the silicon carbide and corundum grains formed in the winds of red giants and agb stars ( hoppe & zinner , 2000 ) .",
    "the grains allow a determination of the thermodynamic conditions of the @xmath11-process via precise measurements of the branching ratios of , e.g. , krypton , which supports agb stars as -site .",
    "the current scenario of the  in agb stars is closely connected to the alternating mixing and nuclear burning events which characterize the thermal pulse cycle . for any  in agb stars ,",
    "the third dredge - up is a necessary ingredient .",
    "it leads to a contact layer where the h - rich envelope and the carbon - rich intershell region can exchange some material and form a partially mixed zone .",
    "gallino et al .",
    "( 1998 ) have assumed that a proton - enriched layer forms at the bottom of the convective envelope at the end of the third dredge - up phase . in the further course of the tp cycle",
    ", this carbon - rich layer allows the formation of excess @xmath0 . due to the assumed low proton abundance , no @xmath2",
    "was produced and therefore the role of this isotope as a neutron poison could be neglected .",
    "this so - called @xmath0-pocket is the indispensable prerequisite for the radiative neutron - capture nucleosynthesis during the interpulse phase in agb stars ( straniero et al .",
    "1995 , gallino et al .",
    "this paper presents two physical candidate processes for the formation of such a @xmath0-pocket at the envelope - core interface of low - mass agb stars : rotation and overshoot .    in sect.[sec :",
    "ov ] we review the properties of the overshoot mechanism as originally proposed for agb stars by herwig et al .  (",
    "following sect.[sec : rot ] gives updated account of agb models with rotation .",
    "a comparison and discussion is presented in sect.[sec : con ]",
    "the relevance of overshoot in agb stars for the neutron source problem has been studied by herwig et al .",
    "( 1997 , 1999 ) .",
    "we assumed that the depth dependence of the mixing due to convective overshoot can be described by an exponentially decaying efficiency .",
    "this behavior is qualitatively suggested by many hydrodynamical simulations of convection under various conditions .",
    "freytag et al .",
    "( 1996 ) found that the particle spread due to successive convective downdrafts and plumes which reach beyond the convective boundary can be described by a diffusion - like process .",
    "moreover , the velocity field in the stable region declines exponentially .",
    "accordingly the material mixing in the overshoot region can be approximated by a diffusion coefficient which decreases exponentially from a mlt value inside the convective boundary .",
    "herwig ( 2000 ) presents the evolution of the abundance profiles of the core - envelope interface during an interpulse period and shows snapshots ( fig.4 ) after the ingestion of protons into the intershell layer , after the initial proton capture phase where the @xmath0-pocket is formed and after consumption of @xmath0 due to @xmath12-capture .",
    "the situation is sketched in fig.[fig : schematic ] . the main difference to the previously and in detail studied profile by gallino et al .",
    "( 1998 ) is the continuous variation of both the proton- and the @xmath1-abundance and thus the p/@xmath1 - ratio .",
    "this ratio determines the @xmath0/@xmath2 - ratio after consumption of hydrogen in the respective layer ( fig .",
    "a.1 in herwig 1998 ) . in the overshoot case we found that the partial mixing zone consists of two adjacent regions after the end of proton captures .",
    "further outward a region with @xmath2 as the most abundant element forms .",
    "all @xmath1 is transformed into @xmath2 which reaches a mass fraction of @xmath13 in models where overshoot has been applied to all convective boundaries . below this zone",
    "the actual @xmath0-pocket forms where the proton abundance is too low to continue p - captures after the production of @xmath0 . here , @xmath2 is only of very small abundance .",
    "preliminary  studies of this situation have shown that qualitatively the reproduction of a solar - like distribution of the main @xmath14-component is possible ( gallino & herwig , 1998 ) .",
    "however , it should be emphasized that the efficiency of overshoot , hence the velocity scale height is a free parameter .",
    "currently we can not constrain the velocity scale height at the bottom of the convective envelope of agb stars during the dredge - up . for most of the evolutionary phases we used a value of @xmath15 ( @xmath16 , @xmath17 pressure scale height ) which reproduces the width of the main - sequence of intermediate mass stars .",
    "however , this value produces only a pocket of integrated @xmath0 of @xmath18 .",
    "this small amount of @xmath0 leads to fairly small enhancement factors . with a larger overshoot efficiency ( @xmath19 ) we found enhancement factors of @xmath20 for the main component .",
    "another interesting property of the  in low - mass agb stars is now emerging from high precision measurements of pre - solar grains ( a.davis , this volume ) . apparently these new observational data require for a model sequence of given initial mass and metalicity a spread in neutron exposures in the range up to a factor of up to 10 .",
    "such a spread can not currently be reproduced by the overshoot scenario ( however , see ) .",
    "although the absolute amount of @xmath0 is likely to be dependent on mass and metallicity for a given velocity scale height of the overshoot , we can not assume that stars even of different mass and metallicities have so greatly different overshoot efficiencies at this convective boundary as to account for the spread required by the pre - solar dust grains .",
    "it does seem possible that the overshoot decay has a different rate at different convective boundaries and during different evolutionary phases .",
    "freytag et al .",
    "( 1996 ) found @xmath21 for the shallow surface convection zones of a - stars and white dwarfs .",
    "such a large value is certainly not appropriate in the adiabatic core regions and can in fact be excluded for the main - sequence convective core of intermediate mass stars .",
    "however , within the physical picture of overshoot the efficiency of this mechanism should be of the same order within a small range in similar evolutionary conditions .",
    "rotationally induced mixing is another physical process which might be responsible for the formation of the neutron donor @xmath0 at the envelope - core interface of low - mass agb stars . in particular",
    ", it may introduce a statistical signature on the  of otherwise identical stars due to a spread of initial rotational velocities . here",
    "we present more detailed properties of the agb models by langer et al .",
    "( 1999 ) with respect to the formation and destruction of @xmath0 .",
    "the input physics is the same as in heger et al .",
    "the 1d - hydrodynamic stellar evolution code contains angular momentum as an additional state variable , and the effect of centrifugal force on stellar structure .",
    "rotationally induced transport of angular momentum and chemical species are taken into account according to eddington - sweet circulations , the solberg - hoiland and the goldreich - schubert - fricke instability , as well as dynamical and secular shear instabilities .",
    "the @xmath22-gradient acts as barrier for rotationally induced mixing ( @xmath23 ) and convection ( ledoux - criterion , semi - convection ) .",
    "nucleosynthesis is treated by a network with pp - chain , cno- , nena- and mgal - cycles , he - burning including @xmath24 reactions and the inclusion of @xmath25 reactions . here",
    "we also discuss the additional effect of the @xmath6 reaction .",
    "the stellar model sequence had an initial mass of @xmath26 and initial equatorial rotation velocity of @xmath27 and was evolved to the agb with mass loss .",
    "contrary to the models with overshoot dredge - up sets in fairly late and remains week .",
    "the tp cycle described below is the 25@xmath28 ( m@xmath29 ) and the dredge - up just reaches into the carbon - rich intershell .",
    "sufficient carbon star formation can not be expected from these models .      in a very generalized sense",
    "rotationally induced mixing occurs where large angular velocity gradients develop .",
    "in addition , convective transport of angular momentum enforces close - to - ridged rotation .",
    "conservation of angular momentum leads to a decrease ( increase ) of angular velocity in expanding ( contracting ) layers .",
    "these mechanisms can be seen at work during a thermal pulse and the subsequent interpulse phase in fig.[fig : angular - vel ] . at the onset of the he - flash ( @xmath30 )",
    "the pulse - driven convection zone is developing but has not yet reached the interface region shown in fig.[fig : angular - vel ] . accordingly the angular velocity profile runs still smoothly in the interface region . at ( @xmath31 ) - shortly after the maximum extension of the he - flash convection zone into the interface layer - convection has lifted the angular velocity below the interface and left behind a prominent step - like edge . at the same time the descending envelope convection bottom decreases the angular velocity above the interface which leads to an even larger angular velocity gradient .",
    "about @xmath32 later the angular velocity in the upper core region decreases due to the expansion of that layer following the energy ingestion further below during the thermo - nuclear runaway of the he - shell .",
    "however , during this phase the maximum angular velocity gradient is reached and the velocity difference in the top layer of the core and the bottom layer of the envelope amounts to about five orders of magnitude .    during the further interpulse evolution the angular velocity generally increases because contraction resumes in between the thermal pulses .",
    "the angular velocity step , however , decreases only slowly . at @xmath33  half way from @xmath0-formation to -destruction ",
    "the angular velocity step at the interface still comprises almost four orders of magnitude .",
    "thus , rotationally induced mixing at the interface of core and envelope after a thermal pulse and during the interpulse is _",
    "ongoing_. this is an important difference to the overshoot picture where no mixing occurs during the interpulse phase in the interface layer and the interpulse nucleosynthesis is _ static_.",
    "although the physical principles of mixing in the overshoot and the rotational case are very different the abundance profiles at the time after the initial proton - capture phase in the partial mixing zone are quite similar .",
    "the case where partial mixing is caused by rotation is displayed in fig.[fig : formation ] .",
    "clearly visible are two neighboring zones where @xmath0 and @xmath2 respectively are dominating .",
    "another similarity to the overshoot case is the negative curvature of the proton profile in the overshoot region just before the onset of proton captures ( a few hundred years before the situation shown in fig.[fig : formation ] ) .",
    "a difference to the overshoot case is the larger extent of the partial mixing zone and the tail of @xmath2 which reaches deep into the intershell even below the @xmath0-pocket itself .",
    "this @xmath2 tail is due to the fact that the dredge - up is fairly weak and ( by coincidence ? ) just reaches the top of the intershell region which has been homogenized by the previous thermal pulse .",
    "a pronounced region of rotationally induced mixing which forms shadow - like in the upper part of the receding he - flash convection zone ( cf .",
    "fig.3 in ) causes exchange of material with the @xmath2-rich he - buffer zone , left over by h - shell burning during the previous intershell phase .    during the following phase the @xmath0 pocket is subject to continuous modification and the evolution is shown in fig.[fig : c13-select ] .",
    "it takes about @xmath34 from the end of @xmath0-formation ( at @xmath35 ) to the onset of neutron production ( @xmath36 ) .",
    "the abundance profile change during this phase shows a broadening and lowering of the peak @xmath0-abundance and is due only to rotationally induced mixing . even after the @xmath12-capture reactions on @xmath0 have started",
    ", mixing remains an important contribution to the abundance profile modification ( fig.[fig : c13-select ] , @xmath37 ) .",
    "the broadening of the @xmath0-profile and the lowering of the peak @xmath0-abundance ( which reaches @xmath38 in the overshoot case if the extra mixing is applied to all convective boundaries , herwig 2000 ) is a feature which at first glance is advantageous for the .",
    "the neutron density is reduced and the exposure of neutrons is distributed over a larger variety of seed material . however , the role of @xmath2 is of great importance if rotationally induced mixing is efficient .",
    "not only the @xmath0-pocket is broadening as shown in fig.[fig : c13-select ] but the prominent @xmath2-pocket shown in fig.[fig : formation ] shares this fate .",
    "the situation at about the peak neutron production is shown in fig.[fig : n14cover ] .",
    "the @xmath0-pocket is entirely wrapped into the broad @xmath2-pocket .",
    "this @xmath2 causes two problems for an efficient .",
    "the neutron - density is reduced because @xmath6 is efficiently _ competing _ with the n - capture of @xmath39 and other heavy elements .",
    "moreover , the released protons from the @xmath40 reaction _ destroy _ @xmath0 and thereby reduce the n - source .",
    "@xmath2 adds another efficient n - sink , reduces the available amount of @xmath0 and thereby weakens the n - source .",
    "it is beyond the purpose of this paper to present a full nuclear network analysis of the neutron - recycling initiated by the efficient @xmath40 reaction of @xmath2 .",
    "however , some qualitative considerations show that the  is not necessarily prohibited by rotationally induced mixing .",
    "typical conditions during n - production in the interpulse phase are given by t@xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 and @xmath47 ( mass fractions ) .",
    "a rough estimate of the effect of @xmath2 as a neutron sink competing with iron is given by @xmath48 which ignores other neutron poisons as well as other heavy elements , in particular iron peak elements .",
    "thus , under the given conditions of a partial mixing zone due to rotationally induced mixing , about 9 times more neutrons are captured by @xmath2 than compared to the number captured by @xmath39 .",
    "the effect of @xmath2 as a source of protons that destroy the neutron source @xmath0 can be estimated by the expression @xmath49 where small leakages of protons to @xmath50 ( @xmath51 ) and @xmath52 ( @xmath53 ) are neglected .",
    "the main reactions of the neutron recycling is shown in fig.[fig : recycle ] .",
    "the percentages given in the graph represent the ratios derived above .",
    "thus , they are specific to the case discussed here .",
    "the chances for the iron seeds to get hold on neutrons are better the higher the @xmath1 abundance and the lower the @xmath2 abundance .",
    "the larger the ratio of neutrons captured by @xmath39 to protons captured by @xmath0 the higher is the  efficiency because the relative loss of protons by @xmath54 smaller than fraction of neutrons captured by heavy elements .",
    "recycling occurs on timescale of @xmath12-capture of @xmath0 ( @xmath55 at beginning of n - production and decreasing to @xmath56 towards end of interpulse phase ) and it thus leads to a certain delayed neutron exposure .",
    "@xmath2 as a n - poison is less effective compared to the situation in the @xmath2 pocket of an overshoot partial mixing zone because the @xmath1 abundance is larger and the @xmath2 abundance smaller",
    ". finally , the @xmath57 reaction releases protons at high temperatures and thus agb models with rotation may be able to produce at the same time heavy elements and @xmath58 as shown in fig.[fig : f19 ] .",
    "in this paper we have discussed in some detail the evolution of the abundance of the neutron donor @xmath0 according to stellar models including overshoot and rotation .",
    "although both processes give promising results , neither of the two classes of models was found to be free of problems and unsolved aspects .",
    "rotation can produce a @xmath0-pocket , which , however , is mixed with a @xmath2-rich layer during the interpulse phase .",
    "this makes the consideration of @xmath2 as neutron poison important , although , as shown above , a larger @xmath2 than @xmath0 abundance does not automatically imply that the  is choked off . in any case , the models with diffusive overshoot are free of this complication as no mixing occurs in the @xmath0-pocket in between two thermal pulses .",
    "this situation has also the advantage that it can be accurately modelled by a series of one - zone nuclear network calculations for the conditions in various layers of the interface region of envelope and core . in order to model the @xmath11-process in rotating agb stars , nucleosynthesis calculations in many layers covering the interface region , must be alternated with time - dependent mixing according to the rotationally induced mixing efficiency .",
    "the most important next step will be to quantify the neutron recycling during the interpulse phase in rotating agb stars .",
    "with respect to overshoot , the main problem remains the unknown efficiency of this process .",
    "current models indicate that the  efficiency reaches acceptable levels within the lifetime of an agb star only if an overshoot efficiency above that obtained fitting the width of the main sequence band ( @xmath15 ; cf .",
    "herwig et al .",
    "1997 , herwig 1998 ) is chosen during the dredge - up phase at the bottom of the envelope convection .    at present",
    ", we can only conclude that both , rotation and overshoot , have the potential to play an important role in the  nucleosynthesis in agb stars , but we are unable to quantify the relative importance of these mechanisms for the production of the neutron donor @xmath0 yet .",
    "however , in view of the results presented above , it appears not unlikely that both processes act in fact simultaneously .",
    "a study of stellar model sequences including the combined consideration of these two processes will be done in a future investigation ."
