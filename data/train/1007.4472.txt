    "unresolved point sources_active star formation in the region of the hi cavity is at a low level , as indicated by the lack of h@xmath13 emission and weak pah emission @xcite . adopting the empirical measured @xmath48 erg s@xmath1 m@xmath49 ( revnivtsev et al .",
    "2008 ) and a bulge mass of @xmath50 for ngc 4151 @xcite , the expected combined contribution of the unresolved old stellar population ( low mass x - ray binaries and cataclysmic variables ) is @xmath51 erg s@xmath1 , two orders of magnitude lower than the detected soft emission ( @xmath52 erg s@xmath1 ) .",
    "moreover , the @xmath53-band starlight profile @xcite decreases faster than the x - ray emission profile ( figure  [ fig3 ] ) .",
    "thus we conclude that the contribution of stellar sources is negligible .",
    "electron scattered nuclear emission_the hot plasma around the nucleus could electron scatter a fraction of the nuclear flux at a larger radii ( e.g. , ngc 1068 , elvis et al .",
    "1990 ) . assuming a solid angle @xmath54 for a scattering medium ,",
    "the observed @xmath55 implies an electron scattering optical depth of @xmath56 and a mean column density of @xmath57 @xmath22 . adopting 200 pc for the depth , the typical galactic disk scale height ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , this corresponds to a volume density of @xmath58 @xmath59 .",
    "this is @xmath2100 times higher than @xmath60 inferred for the thermal plasma and so thermal emission ( which scales as @xmath61 ) will dominate the emission unless it is much cooler than @xmath62  k. the scattering medium must also be highly ionized , requiring @xmath63 k if this is achieved thermally . for the electron - scattering model to be self - consistent ,",
    "a photoionized medium ( eliminating @xmath64 discrepancy ) or a historic outburst ( @xmath47 yr ago ) during which the nucleus was 100 times brighter than currently observed ( eliminating @xmath60 discrepancy ) is needed .",
    "however , the poor fit with the nuclear power - law model (   [ char ] ) does not support this scenario .",
    "moreover , the required power - law component in either two - component fits ( @xmath65 erg s@xmath1 ) is comparable to the expected total contribution ( @xmath66 erg s@xmath1 ) from psf scattering and unresolved point sources , which allows little contribution from the electron scattered component .",
    "we conclude that an electron scattered component is not important for the extended emission .",
    "photoionized gas_the faint extended emission in ngc 4151 could be due to gas photoionized by a more luminous agn in the past .",
    "such a `` quasar - relic '' scenario was proposed for ngc 5252 , which has a spectacular ionization cone extending @xmath210 kpc from the nucleus ( dadina et al .",
    "observable signatures of such `` afterglow '' from an outburst in a radio quiet quasar ( @xmath67 erg s@xmath1 ) have been studied by @xcite . in this context , ngc 4151 belongs to the regime of the lower luminosity sources , for which @xcite suggest an x - ray spectrum dominated by ly@xmath13 and ly@xmath68 lines of nex and oviii . under this assumption ,",
    "the @xmath69 kev emission is dominated by line emission blended at acis spectral resolution , which in turn implies an ionization parameter of @xmath70@xcite consistent with @xmath71 measured in xstar . adopting an electron density @xmath72 @xmath59 ( equal to the hi density ) and @xmath73 kpc ,",
    "the required ionizing luminosity of the nucleus is @xmath74 erg s@xmath75 ( @xmath76 ; bentz et al .",
    "2006 ) . based on detailed photoionization modeling of the extended optical emission of ngc 4151 @xcite , the photoionizing continuum could be anisotropic and the ionizing flux towards the enlr may be @xmath210 times higher than that in the direction of the earth .",
    "this is still insufficient to power the more extended x - ray emission .",
    "therefore an eddington - limit outburst of ngc 4151 @xmath47 yr in the past is required .",
    "the same photoionized medium would produce [ oiii ] emission . if we adopt an observed [ oiii]/soft x - ray ratio of @xmath210 for @xmath77 photoionized gas ( bianchi et al .",
    "2006 ) , the expected [ oiii ] surface brightness is @xmath78 erg s@xmath1 @xmath22 arcsec@xmath79 , fainter than the sensitivity limit of existing [ oiii ] images ( e.g. , @xmath80 erg s@xmath1 @xmath22 arcsec@xmath79 ; * ? ? ?",

    "this model is often adopted in studies of the hot gas in early type galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the best - fit index is @xmath83 , implying a brightness profile that is decreasing slower than an adiabatically expanding wind ( @xmath84 ) , and confinement of the hot gas .",

    ", we derived the pressure radial profile of the hot gas based on the surface brightness profile , considering two cases for the volume in which the hot gas is contained : a cyclinder or a sphere .",
    "for the cylinder , we assumed a depth of 200 pc . to calculate the volume emission density of spherically symmetric gas",
    ", we account for the projection effect by successively subtracting outer shells to smaller radii @xcite .",
    "the electron density distribution is then derived from the emission per unit volume , adopting the simple approximation @xmath89 erg s@xmath1 @xmath59 @xcite for the emissivity of a @xmath90 kev thermal gas (   [ char ] ) .     model .",
    "the solid black line represents the k - band surface brightness profile from knapen et al .",

    "the pressure of the x - ray gas gradually decreases from @xmath91 to approximately @xmath92 dyne @xmath22 when reaching the hi gas lanes . without confinement ,",
    "the gas will inevitably expand , cooling too much to be observed in the x - rays .",
    "we estimate that the thermal pressure of co is @xmath93 dyne @xmath22 , using the mass measured in @xcite , thus the molecular gas present ( @xmath94  k ) can not provide the pressure balance .",

    "this is well matched to the pressure required to provide the confinement needed to prevent the hot gas from expanding in the disk plane where atomic gas is most dense .",
    "@xcite showed that the isovelocity contours of the hi emission deviate from a circularly rotating disk , and identified kinematic evidence for the presence of shocks in inflowing gas along the stellar bar . taking an average inflow velocity of v@xmath240 km s@xmath1 @xcite and a particle density of @xmath72 @xmath59 in the hi gas lanes ,",
    "the dynamic pressure as a result of the inflowing motion , is @xmath98 dyne @xmath22 , where @xmath99 is the density .",
    "this provides additional pressure for the neutral material to be in equilibrium with the hot gas .",
    "the presence of soft x - ray emission ( either thermal or photoionized ) on a @xmath52 kpc scale is interesting .",
    "if the x - ray emission originates from hot gas heated by the agn outflow , it would be strong evidence for agn feedback to the ism on galaxy - scales , resembling the larger scale agn feedback from radio bubbles interacting with the intracluster medium seen in the perseus cluster @xcite .    in the photoionized scenario , considering the light travel time from the nucleus to the hi gas lanes ( @xmath4 yr ) and the photoionization recombination timescale @xmath100 s ( @xmath101 yr under the above assumptions ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we can constrain the timescale when ngc 4151 was experiencing such an eddington - limit outburst phase to be @xmath102 yr ago .",
    "otherwise the x - ray gas would no longer emit recombination lines .",
    "if the soft diffuse emission is due to shock heating associated with a nuclear outflow instead , the current @xmath103 ( kaspi et al . 2005 ) indicates @xmath104 .",
    "assuming that @xmath105 of the power has gone to create the hi cavity ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , @xmath106 year of such agn heating is needed to produce the thermal energy content of the hot gas ( @xmath107 erg ) .",
    "this is much shorter than the current cooling time of the hot gas ( @xmath108 yr ) .",
    "the efficiency at which the agn outflow deposits its kinematic energy in the ism can be as low as @xmath109 , provided that the hot gas is confined and the duration of the strong nuclear outflow is @xmath110 .",
    "however , perpendicular to the plane , the gas could expand and cool efficiently via adiabatic expansion unless some other confinement exists .",
    "assuming an outflow velocity of v@xmath111 km s@xmath1 ( typical of the nlr clouds ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) for the free expansion perpendicular to the disk ( c.f . thermal velocity dispersion v@xmath112 km s@xmath1 ) , the relevant timescale is the time span in which the hot gas expands to the scale height above disk plane @xmath113 yr .",
    "this timescale again implies that the timescale to the last agn outflow heating must be @xmath114 yr , in order to replenish the x - ray gas expanding out of the plane that is cooling rapidly .",
    "compared to the estimated agn lifetime ( @xmath115 yrs ) , the fact that we observe the agn - host interaction is intriguing given the short timescale to the last episode of activity .",
    "such episodic outbursts must occur frequently @xcite , and our finding implies they may occupy @xmath51% of the agn lifetime .",
    "to summarize , we have discovered soft ( 0.31 kev ) diffuse x - ray emission ( @xmath52 erg s@xmath1 ) in the central @xmath22 kpc of ngc 4151 , which can not be attributed to psf scattering or electron scattering of the nuclear emission , or the integrated emission from unresolved faint point sources .    if the gas is of photoionized origin and represents the relic of past agn activities , the nucleus of ngc 4151 must have experienced an eddington - limited high luminosity phase .",
    "alternatively , agn outflows may have mechanically heated the gas to x - ray emitting temperature ( @xmath90 kev ) .",
    "this hot gas could be confined in the hi cavity by the thermal pressure of the hi gas and dynamic pressure of infalling gas along the large - scale stellar bar .    for both scenarios ,",
    "the agn - host interaction must have occured relatively recently .",
    "for the agn outflow heating to work , the deposit of mechanical energy must have happened @xmath116 yr ago to replenish the hot gas , which is expanding out of the plane unless prevented by other confining mechanism . whereas for photoionized gas from a past agn outburst , the timescale to the highly active phase must be @xmath117 yr ago .",
    "this short timescale to the last episode of high activity phase may imply such outbursts occupy @xmath51% of the agn lifetime .",
