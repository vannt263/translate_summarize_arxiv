    "quantum tunneling at finite energy and temperature , the so - called thermally assisted tunneling , has attracted considerable attention recently in the study of the crossover from the quantum tunneling domain to the thermal activation ( hopping ) region .",

    "the probability of tunneling at zero temperature can be obtained from a micro - cannonical ensemble and has a path integral representation@xcite . in the one loop approximation",
    "the probability is @xmath0 where the preexponential factor a arises from gaussian functional integration over small fluctuations around the instanton solution and s is the euclidean action of an instanton with zero energy .",
    "+ there are two kinds of tunneling , one of which is tunneling between degenerate vacua induced by instantons which are stable euclidean field solutions with nontrivial topological charge . the instanton can be viewed as an extended particle existing in the barrier interpolating between degenerate vacua@xcite .",
    "a ( vacuum ) bounce is , however , an unstable solution of a euclidean field equation with zero topological charge and was well known already decades ago@xcite .",
    "the initial and end points of a ( vacuum ) bounce both terminate on a metastable ground state or false vacuum .",
    "the tunneling induced by such a bounce results in the decay of the false vacuum@xcite . + quantum tunneling at finite temperature@xcite t is dominated by periodic instantons ( bounces ) which are periodic solutions of the euclidean equation of motion with finite energy e @xcite and in the semi - classical limit the path integral is expected to be saturated by a single periodic instanton . with exponential accuracy the tunneling probability p(e ) at a given energy e reduces to @xmath1 the period @xmath2 is related to the energy e in the standard way @xmath3 and @xmath4 is the action of the periodic instanton ( bounce ) per period .",
    "such periodic instantons ( bounces ) smoothly interpolate between the zero temperature instantons ( bounces ) and the static solution named sphaleron sitting at the top of the potential barrier .",
    "the sphaleron is responsible for thermal hopping .",
    "peculiarly the study of explicit periodic instantons and their stability began only about ten years ago@xcite . + with increasing temperature thermal hopping becomes more and more important and beyond some critical or crossover temperature @xmath5 becomes the decisive mechanism . in the context of quantum mechanics",
    "it has been demonstrated that the transition from the thermal to the quantum regime can be considered as a phase transition which is of second - order with certain assumptions about the shape of the potential@xcite .",
    "later it was shown that the situation is not generic and that the crossover from the thermal to the quantum regime can quite generally be like that of a first - order phase transition@xcite .",
    "the sharp first - order transition has been confirmed theoretically in several spin tunneling systems@xcite and triggered active reaserch in various fields in connection with tunneling . in the context of field theory",

    "recently there were interesting investigations to show that the crossover from the quantum to the thermal regime in the vacuum decay with @xmath6 models is essentially a first - order phase transition in the thin wall limit@xcite .",

    "the criterion for a first order transition can be obtained by studying the euclidean time period in the neighbourhood of the sphaleron as advocated in ref.[20 ] . if the period @xmath8 of the periodic instanton ( bounce ) close to the barrier peak can be found , a sufficiet condition to have the first order transition is seen to be @xmath9 or @xmath10 , where @xmath11 denotes the barrier height and @xmath12 is the period of small oscillation around the sphaleron . @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the corresponding frequencies .",
    "the frequency of the spaleron @xmath15 is nothing but the frequency of small oscillaton in the bottom of the inverted potential well .",
    "a practically useful formula for the criterion of the first order transition is given in ref.[21 ] and the winding number transition in @xmath16 model with and withoult skyrme term has been successfully analyzed with the crirerion@xcite . in the following the crossover behaviour in the minisuperspace model",
    "is investigated in terms of the general criterion and we also explain the physics underlying the crossover which may shed light on understanding the time evolution of the universe in the model . in sec .",
    "2 the quantum tunneling at zero energy is briefly reviewed .",
    "we emphasize that the bounce starts and ends on the metastable ground state which corresponds to a static solution of the field equation with zero radius and is therefore meaningful for the decay of the false vacuum . as a prototype model of the creation of the universe at finite temperature",
