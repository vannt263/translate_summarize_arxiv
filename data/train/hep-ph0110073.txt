    "<S> ( [ sp ] ) , the scales @xmath25 in the presence of heavy majorana neutrinos correspond to roughly their masses divided by squared of the neutrino yukawa couplings and hence can be larger than the reduced planck scale @xmath26 gev . since the leptogenesis works most effectively for the flat direction of the first family , we suppress the family index @xmath27 and consider only the flat direction @xmath28 . the flat direction @xmath29 obtains its potential from susy breaking effects and also from the non - renormalizable operator in eq .  </S>",

    "<S> this is because certain values of @xmath37 and @xmath38 can explain the desirable initial condition for the ad mechanism .    </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , @xmath29 receives an additional potential from the thermal effects of the surrounding plasma  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it should be noted that even in the period of the inflaton oscillation there is a dilute plasma as a result of scatterings with the thermalized decay products of the inflaton , which temperature is given by @xmath39  @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> ( [ vtot ] ) that there is an instability of @xmath29 at origin and @xmath29 is trapped at one of the minima of the potential @xmath51 this is because the curvature of the potential around the minimum along both radius and phase directions is of the order of @xmath49 , @xmath29 moves towards one of the above minima from any given initial value and settles there . </S>",

    "<S> note that the damping rate in all the above cases is faster than the rate before @xmath29 starts to oscillate .    </S>",
    "<S> now , we are at the point to estimate the lepton asymmetry produced in the considering ad leptogenesis . </S>",
    "<S> the lepton number density is given by @xmath71 and its evolution is described by the equation @xmath72 notice that inflation sets @xmath73 initially . </S>",
    "<S> the phase of @xmath29 is kicked by the relative phase between @xmath32 and @xmath38 and the rotational motion of @xmath29 generates the lepton asymmetry  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it was shown in refs .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite that , comparing two source terms of rhs in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ evonl ] ) , the first term ( i.e. , the original @xmath74-term in @xmath75 ( [ pot ] ) ) gives the dominant contribution in generating @xmath76 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , by integrating eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ evonl ] ) we obtain the produced lepton asymmetry at time @xmath77 as @xmath78(t )    & \\simeq & \\int^{t }    dt ' r^3 \\frac { m_{3/2 } } { 2 m } \\mbox{im }   \\left ( a_m \\phi^4 \\right ) \\nonumber    \\\\    & = &     \\int^{t_{\\rm osc } }    dt ' r^3 \\frac { m_{3/2 } } { 2 m } \\mbox{im }   \\left ( a_m \\phi^4 \\right )    ~+~    \\int^{t}_{t_{\\rm osc } }    dt ' r^3 \\frac { m_{3/2 } } { 2 m } \\mbox{im }   \\left ( a_m \\phi^4 \\right)~ ,    \\label{inl}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath79 is the scale factor of the universe . the second term of rhs in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ inl ] ) gives only a small contribution to the total lepton asymmetry , since @xmath80 changes its sign rapidly due to the @xmath29 oscillation and also the damping rate of @xmath81 is faster than the rate of @xmath82 . on the other hand , the integrand of the first term in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ inl ] ) is almost constant ( @xmath83 ) since @xmath84 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the resulting lepton asymmetry for @xmath85 is dominated by the contribution at @xmath86 and we have @xmath87 where @xmath88 denotes an effective cp - violating phase .    the lepton - to - entropy ratio when the reheating process of inflation completes at @xmath89 is estimated as @xmath90 this ratio takes a constant value as long as no dilution exists in the later epoch . </S>",
    "<S> the lepton asymmetry , since it is produced well before the electroweak phase transition ( at @xmath91 ) , is partially converted into the baryon asymmetry from the chemical equilibrium between lepton and baryon number through the sphaleron effects  @xcite .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . ] </S>",
    "<S> the baryon asymmetry in the present universe is  @xcite @xmath92 here we neglected the sign of the produced baryon asymmetry . </S>",
    "<S> one sees that the ad leptogenesis is most effective for the flat direction of the first family corresponding to the largest scale @xmath93 ( or the lightest neutrino mass @xmath94 ) . if @xmath95 due to the early oscillation by the thermal effects , the baryon asymmetry is suppressed . in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : ba ] we show the contour plot of @xmath7 by the dashed lines . </S>",
    "<S> it is found that the present baryon asymmetry is determined almost independently on the reheating temperature for a wide range of @xmath96@xmath97 and the observed value @xmath98 suggests an ultralight neutrino with a mass @xmath99  ev  @xcite .    in deriving eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ ba0 ] ) we made two assumptions on parameters of the inflation model . </S>",
    "<S> first , we assumed that the reheating temperature is sufficiently low and its process completes after the lepton asymmetry is fixed at @xmath86 . in the parameter space shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : ba ] this assumption is justified . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , such a low reheating temperature is preferred to avoid the cosmological gravitino problem ( see the discussion below ) .    </S>",
    "<S> the second assumption is that the scale @xmath100 of the inflation is sufficiently high and the ad field starts to oscillate well after the inflation ends , i.e. , @xmath101 . </S>",
    "<S> we show in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : hosc ] the contour plot of @xmath102 . </S>",
    "<S> it is seen that the scale of @xmath59 becomes higher in the heavier @xmath94 region due to the large thermal effects . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , for a model of low scale inflation with a fixed @xmath103 this assumption breaks down in some region of parameter space and the final expression of the present baryon asymmetry in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ ba0 ] ) should be modified .    </S>",
    "<S> thus , we discuss the ad leptogenesis for the case @xmath104 . </S>",
    "<S> as mentioned before , we consider only the models with @xmath105 to explain the initial condition for the ad mechanism . </S>",
    "<S> since the energy of the radiation after the reheating process completes is smaller than the inflaton vacuum energy @xmath106 , one has @xmath107 considering the evolution of the dilute plasma in the period of the inflaton oscillation , the maximum temperature @xmath108 after the inflation is achieved when @xmath109 and is given by  @xcite @xmath110 the temperature for @xmath111 is given by @xmath112 as long as @xmath113 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the previous discussion can be applied for @xmath114 . neglecting the small time difference between @xmath103 and @xmath115 </S>",
    "<S> , it is found that the ad field starts to oscillate and hence the produced lepton asymmetry is fixed just after the inflation ends at @xmath116 , since @xmath104 . the present baryon asymmetry in the considering case </S>",
    "<S> is obtained by replacing @xmath59 by @xmath103 in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ ba0 ] ) as @xmath117 in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : ba ] we also show the contour plot of @xmath7 by the solid lines for the case @xmath118 gev ( i.e. , @xmath119 ) . </S>",
    "<S> it is seen that the present baryon asymmetry is enhanced by the rate @xmath120 in the region @xmath104 . in this case , with relatively high reheating temperatures , the lightest neutrino mass @xmath121 ev ( @xmath122 ev ) is sufficient to explain the observed baryon asymmetry . notice that such low values of @xmath123 are available in a class of susy inflation models  @xcite . as a free parameter in the region ( [ trr ] ) . ] finally , we consider the extreme case that the hubble parameter is comparable to ( but slightly larger than ) the susy breaking mass of the ad field @xmath29 ( @xmath124 ) . in this case </S>",
    "<S> @xmath29 starts to oscillate just after the end of inflation at @xmath125 and hence the produced lepton asymmetry is determined independently on details of the additional potential ( [ thm ] ) induced by the thermal plasma . </S>",
    "<S> then , the resultant baryon asymmetry is enhanced since there is no suppression coming from the early oscillation by the thermal effects and its expression is given by dropping off the factor @xmath126 in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ ba0 ] ) , which is the one obtained without including the thermal effects in the earlier works .    </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , if the reheating process completes just after the end of the inflation , we expect to have a larger baryon asymmetry since the lepton asymmetry produced at @xmath127 does not receive the entropy dilution by the inflaton decay . in this sudden reheating case , </S>",
    "<S> the inflationary epoch is just followed by the radiation dominated universe and the reheating temperature is given by @xmath128 at this time the lepton asymmetry produced by @xmath29 is fixed as @xmath129 where we used the fact @xmath130 in the radiation dominated universe . </S>",
    "<S> we obtain , then , the present baryon asymmetry @xmath131 therefore , for models of low scale inflation with @xmath132 , if the reheating process is suddenly terminated , the lightest neutrino mass of @xmath133 ev is small enough to account for the observed baryon asymmetry in the present universe .    before closing this letter , we should mention the constraint on @xmath11 from the cosmological gravitino problem . </S>",
    "<S> recent analysis  @xcite , using the gravitino density given in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , depends on a gluino mass @xmath134 . </S>",
    "<S> we take @xmath135 tev . ] </S>",
    "<S> shows that the nucleosynthesis puts the the upper bound on @xmath11 as @xmath136 , @xmath137 and @xmath13 gev for the gravitino mass @xmath138 gev , 1 tev and 3 tev , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , a gravitino mass of a few tev is sufficient to have the relatively high reheating temperatures in the present analysis . </S>",
    "<S> further , considerably higher reheating temperatures are acceptable in some cases  @xcite . </S>"
