    "complex networks are ubiquitous in many real - world scenarios , ranging from the biomolecular  those representing gene transcription , protein interactions , and metabolic reactions  to the social and infrastructural organization of modern society @xcite .",
    "mathematically , these networks are represented by graphs , where the nodes represent the entities of the system and the edges represent the `` relations '' among those entities .",
    "the accumulation of a mountain of empirical evidence has left little doubt that in general real - world networks are very different from their random counterparts in many structural and functional aspects @xcite . in particular",
    ", it is well - documented that real - world networks are significantly more `` clustered '' than one would expect from a random wiring of nodes @xcite .",
    "the degree of `` clustering '' is usually quantified in network theory through the use of the _ clustering coefficient _ ( see @xcite ) .",
    "this accounts for the ratio of the number of triangles to the number of open triads , i.e. subgraphs of the type @xmath3 .",
    "the fact that triangles are abundant in real - world networks has long been appreciated  for example , in 1922 where simmel @xcite theorized that people with common friends are more likely to create friendships .",
    "this `` _ _ friendship transitivity _ _ '' definitively implies a social mechanism for triadic closure in social networks which may then be applied to explain the evolution of triangle closures @xcite .",
    "this simmelian principle of triadic closure due to friendship transitivity assumes that individuals can benefit from cooperative relations , and this may induce individuals to choose new acquaintances from among their friends friends .",
    "the high degree of transitivity is not a unique feature of social networks ; indeed , it is a common characteristic of many other types of networks such as biomolecular , cellular , ecological , infrastructural , and technological ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "it is natural to assume that analogous cooperative principles to the one proposed by simmel for social networks could be applied to find mechanisms that explain triadic closure in these other types of networks . although intuitive , this simple idea has some fundamental drawbacks .",
    "first , it is not always true that pairs of nodes benefit from cooperative relations , and therefore the simmelian principle is useless in such situations .",
    "secondly , it is evident that not every pair of nodes separated by two edges participates in a triangle in a real - world network .",
    "thus , some kind of selective process has been taking place , closing some of the triads in a network and leaving many others open .",
    "the goal of this paper is to propose a general mechanism to account for such selective process of triadic closure in networks .",
    "we propose a strategy for predicting triadic closure based on the idea that triadic closure is a communication - driven process .",
    "this paradigm is formulated on the basis of communicability distance functions that account for the quality of communication between pairs of nodes using a mechanism accounting for both local and long - range interactions .",
    "we start with an overview of related work .",
    "all the mathematical concepts we use are introduced in section [ sec : mp ] in order to make the paper self - contained .",
    "sections [ sec : cd ] and [ sec : pm ] are devoted to the introduction of the new method for predicting triadic closure .",
    "we finish with a presentation and discussion of the results .",
    "triadic closure , loosely defined as the process in which an edge is added to a triad to form a triangle , has long been considered as a fundamental mechanism of social networks evolution .",
    "the theoretical basis of this mechanism is due to simmel @xcite and one of the pioneering studies to use this principle to predict triadic closure in social networks was published by krackhardt and handcock @xcite .    when considering undirected networks , the main focus of triadic closure models has been to create simple mechanisms that provide insight into how ( social ) networks grow and generate their main topological characteristics .",
    "a simple model of network growth based on triadic closure has been proposed by bianconi et al .",
    "they show that the evolution of networks based on such simple mechanisms `` _ _ naturally leads to the emergence of community structure , together with fat - tailed distributions of node degree and high clustering coefficients _ _ '' .",
    "similar results by klimek and thurner @xcite suggest that triadic closure can be identified as one of the fundamental dynamical principles in social multiplex network formation .",
    "these two works use triadic closure mechanisms based on the random selection of the nodes which will be involved in the triangles .    in the case of directed graphs",
    "an exhaustive computational analysis was performed by leskovec et al .",
    "they consider several strategies to model how a node @xmath4 selects a node @xmath5 , two steps from it , to form a triangle .",
    "the basic strategy is for @xmath4 to select randomly a node @xmath5 from all the nodes at distance two .",
    "an alternative strategy is to assume that @xmath4 first selects a neighbor node @xmath6 according to some mechanism , and then @xmath6 selects a neighbor @xmath5 according to some ( possibly different ) mechanism .",
    "the edge @xmath7 is then formed and the triangle @xmath8 is closed .",
    "the selection of a neighbor @xmath6 for @xmath4 ( or @xmath5 for @xmath6 ) has been carried out using the following techniques : @xmath9 uniformly at random ; @xmath10 proportional to degree of @xmath6 raised to a power ; @xmath11 proportional to the number of friends that @xmath4 and @xmath6 have in common ; @xmath12 proportional to the time passed since @xmath6 last created an edge raised to a power ; @xmath13 proportional to the product of the number of common friends of @xmath4 and @xmath6 multiplied by the last activity time , all raised to a power .",
    "the quantitative predictions made by leskovec et al .",
    "are summarised in table 1 , where we report the percentage of correct prediction of triadic closure in four networks , using a random - random selection of the nodes , and the best percentage of improvement over the log - likelihood of picking a random node two hops away ( baseline ) reported by the authors .",
    "the network linkedin is the only one of the four which is undirected .",
