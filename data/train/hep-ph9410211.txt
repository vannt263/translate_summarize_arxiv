    "the existence of electroweak strings might be of relevance both for the explanation of cosmological problems and future accelerator results @xcite .",
    "however , when they are built exclusively with higgs and gauge fields of the standard model we obtain classically unstable configurations , or at most quantum metastable ones with significant life - time only for too small higgs boson mass @xcite and too large weinberg angle @xcite .    to give more stability to the electroweak string , an additional global abelian symmetry may be considered .",
    "when this symmetry is unbroken , its noether charge for particles lighter inside than outside the core may produce stable strings as occurs for non - topological solitons @xcite .",
    "alternatively , if the global symmetry is broken , there is a topological reason for the stability of a configuration where the electroweak component is added to an axionic string @xcite , though qcd effects may cause its decay .",
    "we propose a closed string , that partially combines both effects , with axions in its core which are lighter than outside and a quasitopological basis for stability due to the phase nature of the axion field that allows a variation of a multiple of @xmath2 along it .",
    "absolute stability is not obtained due both to the very small decay probability of axions and to the finiteness of the transverse region of this coherent configuration inside the core .    in section 2",
    "we describe the reasons of instability of electroweak strings and attempts to stabilize them .",
    "section 3 is devoted to the proposed string with axions in its core showing that the configurations might be macroscopic and with large life - time .",
    "brief conclusions are included in section 4 .",
    "we remind that the stability of vortices relies on the non - triviality of @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the vacuum manifold , and eventually on the conservation of the magnetic flux through the core in the gauge theories . in the case of a broken global @xmath5 symmetry ,",
    "the stability of the so called axionic string is assured by @xmath6 . for the nielsen - olesen vortex @xcite corresponding to the breaking of a local @xmath5 symmetry , if this @xmath5 was the remnant of a larger broken symmetry @xmath7 such that @xmath8 a quantum decay of the configuration to a broad one may occur@xcite .",
    "the limit @xmath9 of the electroweak string is the semilocal one @xcite which corresponds to the breaking @xmath10 with a complex higgs field @xmath11 where @xmath12 is electrically neutral , a potential    @xmath13    and a neutral gauge field @xmath14 with coupling @xmath15 .",
    "though in this case @xmath16 , the conservation of @xmath14-magnetic flux may produce stability of the vortex .",
    "in fact being the configuration such that for large @xmath17 in @xmath18    @xmath19    and for small @xmath20 , if we increase @xmath21 up to @xmath22 inside the core and then enlarge its size @xmath23 , the remaining energy is the additional scale invariant gradient contribution @xmath24",
    ". the vortex will be stable if its potential and magnetic energies @xmath25 are smaller than the previous gradient contribution , being this possible if the higgs mass is lighter than the vector boson one@xcite .",
    "if on the contrary @xmath26 the vortex becomes metastable tunneling to a broader configuration with the same energy . finally , for a sufficiently large",
    "@xmath27 the radius of the latter configuration becomes equal to the original vortex size , there is no barrier to surmount and the defect is unstable .",
    "a channel for decay of the @xmath28 string is its breaking by nucleation of a global monopole pair .",
    "again for large @xmath27 the string will become unstable when the energy balances for a pair separation of the order of the defect size so that there will be no barrier to surmount .    in the true electroweak case @xmath29 , @xmath30 ,",
    "the @xmath31-flux is not conserved and may transform into the electromagnetic @xmath32-flux @xcite . therefore the vortex can never be stable because one may change the configuration eliminating the phase of @xmath12 in eq.([e2 ] ) by a gauge transformation , then turning @xmath31-flux into @xmath32-flux which is decoupled from @xmath12 thus avoiding a divergent energy contribution when @xmath12 is subsequently increased to @xmath22 inside the core .",
    "no gradient contribution is introduced in this way and enlarging @xmath33 to eliminate the magnetic energy , one obtains a vacuum configuration of zero energy without having surmounted any infinite barrier . for @xmath28 one decay channel",
    "is given by the nucleation of magnetic monopoles with the probability @xmath34 given by the bounce action @xmath35",
    "@xcite    @xmath36    analogously to the semilocal case , the string energy per unit length is @xmath37 and the monopole energy for the realistic case @xmath38 can be estimated by the sum of the contribution of a global monopole for a small range @xmath39 and that of the magnetic energy emerging from it i.e. @xmath40 the energy balances for a separation of monopoles which is larger than their size , condition for metastability , for large @xmath41 and small @xmath42 excluding therefore the realistic region .",
    "the same conclusion is reached for @xmath43 analizing the monopole pair bounce configuration responsible for the decay of the @xmath14-string into a @xmath32-flux configuration .",
    "it is important to remark that the instability of @xmath14-strings is additionally increased by its possible decay into a @xmath44 condensate @xcite .",
    "this is due to the vacuum instability caused by the anomalous coupling of the spin of @xmath45 with @xmath46 and @xmath14 magnetic fields @xcite . in particular @xmath45s are produced with a zero energy expense for a strong @xmath14 magnetic field @xmath47 which , for the flux inside a @xmath14-string , is satisfied for @xmath48 .    to obtain a larger stability one may think of including an additional global symmetry @xmath49 .",
    "if this symmetry is unbroken there is no topological reason for stability since one still has @xmath16 but the conservation of its noether charge may stabilize the configuration as occurs in non - topological solitons .",
    "thus an example is to introduce a complex scalar field @xmath50 with the additional lagrangian @xcite @xmath51 with parameters such that the mass of the particle @xmath50 is smaller inside the vortex core , where there is an expectation value @xmath52 , than its mass @xmath53 outside .",
    "for @xmath18 we may pass from the vortex configuration in whose core @xmath54 to the vacuum @xmath55 everywhere by the same steps as in the electroweak case with the only difference that the vortex energy decreases from @xmath56 to @xmath57 , where @xmath58 corresponds to the depth of the local minimum of the potential caused by eq.(6 ) .",
    "the replacement of the higgs mass by @xmath59 in all the above considerations tends to increase the life - time of the metastable configurations and to allow them for more realistic values of @xmath60 .",
    "for @xmath28 it would be possible to obtain absolute stability if we consider @xmath61 dependent configurations inside the core corresponding to a noether charge @xmath62 per unit length .",
    "if the particles @xmath63 are so heavy outside the core that @xmath64 , where @xmath65 is the energy per unit string length including the @xmath62 particles inside it , the string can not decay .",
    "otherwise for the monopole nucleation channel the bounce action of eq.(@xmath66 ) is modified through the replacement of @xmath67 by @xmath68 with the possibility of increasing the life - time .",
    "it is interesting to consider the realistic case in which the fermions that acquire their mass through coupling with the higgs field may be trapped in the string core .",
    "it has been shown that in this way the electroweak string becomes superconducting @xcite with zero - mass fermions running along one direction of the string or the other according to their being an up or a down component of the elecroweak doublet @xcite .",
    "but the dirac sea of these quarks tends to destabilize the string @xcite because a small perturbation of the upper higgs component @xmath69 produces , via the yukawa coupling @xmath70 to the fermion , mixed states for each momentum @xmath71 with an energy shift @xmath72 it is therefore necessary that positive energy fermions with a proper density per unit string are present to overcome this shift and may have a chance to stabilize the configuration",
    ".    one may think to increase the stability to the elecroweak string introducing topological reasons for it . a possibility is to make the hypothetical axion field play a role due to its phase nature .",
    "a model is built adding the electroweak components to the axionic string @xcite which corresponds to a global @xmath49 symmetry spontaneously broken at a higher scale @xmath73 so that @xmath74 to have a coupling between the phase of the scalar field @xmath75 which breaks this peccei - quinn symmetry with the higgs sector one needs two complex higgs doublets @xmath76 and an effective potential @xmath77 \\end{array}\\ ] ] eq.(@xmath78 ) forces the difference of phases of the higgs doublets to be equal to that of @xmath79 outside the string core i.e. @xmath80 with @xmath81 a modification emerges from qcd corrections which give a small mass @xmath82 to the axion breaking intrinsically the symmetry @xmath83 , where in the invisible axion model @xmath84 is the number of quark flavours .",
    "therefore the string becomes attached to @xmath84 axionic walls which have too much energy for cosmology @xcite . if the attached wall is a single one it becomes surrounded by the string turning into a metastable configuration @xcite .",
    "when the electroweak components are included into the axionic string , the @xmath14-flux is conserved due to eq.([e9 ] ) adding stability to the configuration because its electroweak part returns to the situation of the semilocal case .",
    "we propose a different mechanism for the stabilization of the electroweak string , inspired in a previously discussed non topological configuration @xcite , which consists in including axions in the core combining the effects of being lighter there and of corresponding to a phase - like field . in the case analyzed above",
    "one thinks that the skeleton is an axionic string formed at the peccei - quinn scale @xmath85 , which attracts electroweak components at the @xmath86 breaking .",
    "we consider instead that the electroweak strings formed at the latter scale trap axions .",
    "while outside the core the real scalar axion field must be around zero in correspondence to the vacuum , it takes an average value @xmath87 inside the core where the electroweak symmetry is unbroken .",
    "this follows from the absence of the contribution @xmath88 of the mass matrix @xcite so that it must not be compensated by the axion field .",
    "to explain this feature we remind that the vacuum energy @xmath89 of qcd in a phase where the quarks have mass @xmath90 depends on the @xmath91-vacuum parameter as @xcite @xmath92 with @xmath93 gluon fields .",
    "since @xmath94 the factor @xmath95 can only decrease the integral so that @xmath96 . in case",
    "that the axion field is included , all what said above applies to @xmath97 which is defined as @xmath98 . to be precise",
    ", @xmath99 contains not only the qcd parameter @xmath100 but also @xmath88 coming from the ew breaking .",
    "if we are in the symmetric ew phase and @xmath101 is still positive @xmath102 must compensate only @xmath100 and the redefined @xmath103 will be of order @xmath73 .",
    "if the axion mass in this phase is vanishing in correspondence to zero modes of @xmath104 there will not be a preferred value of @xmath103 but the average of the phase @xmath105 will be of order @xmath106 .",
    "what said above may be simulated in the simplest way by an effective potential @xmath107 \\left ( 1-\\cos \\frac a{f_{pq}}\\right)\\ ] ] with @xmath108 . in the stable phase @xmath109 eq.([e10 ] ) gives the normal axion potential with mass @xmath82 which forces the field to its minimum @xmath110 .",
    "outside the string we expect this phase and inside it , where @xmath111 , the axion mass will be @xmath112 which may be adjusted to the desired extremely small value by the additional parameter @xmath113 .",
    "we will now show that both decay channels of monopole nucleation and @xmath45 condensate may be considerably suppressed by this mechanism .    for @xmath28 ,",
    "if we make @xmath103 vary along the axis of the string particles are excited and being @xmath114 , we obtain an effect equivalent to that of the noether charge because of the very long life - time of axions .",
    "but more important than that , due to the fact that @xmath105 is a phase , if we take a closed string the variation along it must be @xmath115 with integer @xmath116 , and there is a quasi - topological reason for an increase of the stability as it occurs in the superconducting strings @xcite .",
    "this follows from the fact that when the string is cut an additional energy corresponding to a jump of @xmath103 in the wall width @xmath117 must be supplied .",
    "the decay of the string must be accompanied by an alignment of the phase @xmath103 of the field @xmath79 inside the defect with its value @xmath110 outside in order to minimize the gradient energy .",
    "this alignment may be done smoothly in all the points along the string axis except for a small region where an abrupt change of phase will appear which will require to cut the string ( see fig.1 ) with a gradient energy of order @xmath118 that is not infinite because of the finiteness of the transverse radius @xmath119 .",
    "it is important to note that the pure ew string has an energy per unit length which comes from minimizing essentially the contribution of the difference of vacua and that of the flux @xmath120 , i.e. @xmath121 which leads to a field @xmath122 that is independent of @xmath119 and exceeds the critical value eq.([e5 ] ) for @xmath26 producing the instability of the configuration .",
    "now , the addition of axions inside the core gives a large surface contribution which together with the flux term determines the energy per unit length @xmath123 minimizing eq.([z3 ] ) @xmath124 , taking the wall width @xmath125 and being @xmath126 , it is necessary that @xmath127 to ensure @xmath128 . even though this flux is a large number",
    ", if the radius is not too small @xmath122 may go below the critical value eq.([e5 ] ) .",
    "in fact with @xmath129 , @xmath31 turns out to be @xmath130 .",
    "therefore the string radius must be larger than @xmath131 to avoid the instability due to @xmath45 condensation .    regarding the energy balance for the monopole pair nucleation which may break the string and including its cut contribution @xmath132 the bounce action is now @xmath133 if we adopt the above parameters and taking the energy of the monopole as the magnetic contribution due to @xmath120 outside a core of the size @xmath119 , @xmath134 which is of the same order of @xmath135 coming from eq.([e12 ] ) , whereas @xmath136 eq.([z3 ] ) is of order @xmath137 .",
    "therefore @xmath138 to be compared with the bounce action for a normal ew string @xmath139 for @xmath140 , , much more stable .",
    "we have seen that at variance from other modifications a closed ew string with the inclusion of axion field in its core which increases continuously along it may exhibit a very long life - time , even though it is not completely stable .",
    "the high value of the energy of the string is exaggerated by the estimation of a common wall width for the higgs and axion fields which gives a very large surface term for the latter .",
    "therefore for quantitative applications a more accurate description of the configuration should be performed .",
    "it is clear that one should also study the mechanism for the production of such heavy and macroscopical objects which might play a role in cosmological aspects as the baryogenesis during the electroweak phase transition if this was weakly of first order or of second order @xcite @xcite .",
    "they might also influence astrophysical observations as a rotation of the polarization plane of the radiation from distant radiosources due to the parity - violating coupling with electromagnetic fields @xcite .",
    "this effect caused by coherent axionic configurations may be more important than that due to the previously considered background of quasi - goldstone boson fields @xcite .",
    "we are deeply indebted to sandra savaglio for her collaboration in the early stage of this work and to f. klinkhamer for an illuminating correspondence .",
