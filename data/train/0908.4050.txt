    "alternative tableaux are certain fillings of ferrers diagrams introduced by xavier viennot @xcite , in simple bijection with permutation tableaux introduced by postnikov @xcite in his study of the totally positive part of the grassmannian .",
    "these permutation tableaux have then been considered by several authors .",
    "alternative tableaux are related to the stationary distribution of a certain markov process from statistical physics , the asymmetric simple exclusion process ( asep ) .",
    "they are more precisely connected to a _",
    "matrix ansatz _ describing a general solution for this stationary distribution ( see proposition [ prop : connection ] ) .",
    "formulas for this distribution have been first computed by sasamoto , uchiyama and wadati @xcite , and involve the famous askey - wilson orthogonal polynomials .",
    "an understanding of alternative tableaux thus seem to be a key in order to get a better grasp of these polynomials , for which no combinatorial interpretation is known .",
    "the articles @xcite develop such connections between tableaux and some special cases of the asep model .",
    "another line of research is related to permutations ; the starting point here is that permutation tableaux of size @xmath0 are counted simply by @xmath1 .",
    "they were first studied from a combinatorial point of view in @xcite , in which a bijection between these tableaux and permutations of @xmath2 was studied in detail . since then , other bijections have been described @xcite .",
    "these tableaux also showed up in the work of lam and williams @xcite where permutation tableaux were shown to fit naturally into the _ type a _ case of the classification of coxeter systems .    in this article , we show that alternative tableaux admit a natural recursive structure , which is best expressed when considering alternative tableaux as labeled combinatorial objects .",
    "the central part of this work is thus section  [ sect : struct ] , in which we exhibit this recursive decomposition .",
    "these structural results are then applied in the following sections , first by giving enumerative results in a very straightforward manner , and then by encoding the recursive decomposition by certain classes of labeled trees , which are then themselves in bijection with permutations .",
    "let us give a more precise outline of the paper .",
    "we introduce some elementary definitions and properties concerning alternative and permutation tableaux in section  [ sect : first ] .",
    "we then give our main results relative to the structure of alternative tableaux in section  [ sect : struct ] , the recursive structure being a consequence of proposition  [ prop : cut ] and theorem  [ th : decomp ] in particular . using this decomposition",
    ", we prove several enumeration results in section  [ sect : enum ] : this gives in particular elementary proofs of certain results of @xcite , as well as some new results .",
    "we then describe how the recursive decomposition is naturally associated with certain labeled trees in section  [ sect : alttrees ]",
    ". finally we exhibit in section  [ sect : perm ] a bijection from alternative tableaux to permutations , and stress its connection to bijections which have already appeared in the literature .",
    "we call _ shape _ a staircase diagram ( also called ferrers shape ) with possible empty rows or columns , cf . figure  [ fig : shape ] .",
    "the _ length _ of a shape is the number of rows plus the number of columns of the shape .",
    "note that a shape is determined by its south east border , which is the path from the top right corner of the shape to its bottom left corner ; it is the path labeled by the integers @xmath3 on the left of figure  [ fig : shape ] .",
    "there are thus @xmath4 shapes of length @xmath0 , since one can choose to go down or left at each step",
    ".    , height=151 ]    rows and columns of shapes will be labeled by integers in the following manner : let @xmath5 be a shape of length @xmath0 , and @xmath6 a set of integers .",
    "then @xmath5 is _ labeled by @xmath7 _ if the numbers @xmath8 are attached to the rows and columns , in increasing order following the south east border of @xmath5 from top right to bottom left .",
    "if @xmath9 , then we say that @xmath5 has the _ standard labeling _ ; this is the case of the shape of figure  [ fig : shape ] .",
    "note that although the labeling is always defined with respect to the south east border , we will actually write the labels on the top and left side for an improved readability , as shown on the right of figure  [ fig : shape ] .    given a labeled shape , we will sometimes say row @xmath10 or column @xmath11 when we actually refer to the row with the label @xmath10 or the column with the label @xmath11 .",
    "then the cell lying at the intersection of row @xmath10 and column @xmath11 is denoted by @xmath12 , where we have @xmath13 necessarily by definition of the labelings .",
    "we now define two possible ways to fill these shapes , called permutation tableaux and alternative tableaux : the two are in bijection by viennot s theorem  [ th : permalt ] .",
    "what we will show in this paper is that it is better to study alternative tableaux when it comes to discover the intrinsic structure of these combinatorial objects .    a _ permutation tableau _",
    "@xmath14 is a shape with a filling of each of its cells by @xmath15 or @xmath16 such that the following properties hold : ( i ) each column contains at least one @xmath16 , and ( ii ) there is no cell filled by a @xmath15 which has simultaneously a @xmath16 above it in the same column and a @xmath16 to its left in the same row .",
    "note that permutation tableaux can not have any empty columns because of the first condition .",
    "a @xmath15 in a permutation tableau is _ restricted _ if there is a @xmath16 above it in the same column ; it is _ rightmost restricted _ if it is the rightmost such @xmath15 in its row .",
    "a row is _ unrestricted _ if it does not contain a restricted @xmath15 .",
    "a @xmath16 is _ superfluous _ if , somewhere above it in the same column , there is another cell containing a @xmath16 .",
    "a permutation tableau is represented on the left of figure  [ fig : permtabaltab ] ; lines @xmath17 and @xmath18 are unrestricted , the cells in the top row filled by @xmath16 appear in columns @xmath19 and @xmath20 , and there are four superfluous ones in cells @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "[ def : altab ] an _ alternative tableau _ is a shape with a partial filling of the cells with left arrows @xmath23 and up arrows @xmath24 , such that all cells left of a left arrow , or above an up arrow are empty . in other words ,",
    "all cells pointed by an arrow must be empty .    in an alternative tableau ,",
    "free row _ is a row with no left arrow , and a _ free column _ is a column with no up arrow .",
    "thus rows ( respectively columns ) that are not free are in bijection with left ( resp .",
    "up ) arrows . a _",
    "free cell _ is a cell which is not filled , and such that there exists no left arrow to its right and no up arrow under it ; in other words , the cell is empty and no arrow points toward it .",
    "we will let @xmath25 and @xmath26 denote the number of free rows , free columns and free cells of a given tableau .",
    "for the tableau @xmath27 which is represented on the right of figure  [ fig : permtabaltab ] , the free rows are @xmath28 and @xmath18 while the free columns are @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "there are four free cells , namely @xmath29 and @xmath22 .",
    "thus we have @xmath30 and @xmath31 .    we can now state the fundamental result of xavier viennot , showing that alternative tableaux are actually a new simple encoding of permutation tableaux :    [ th : permalt ] there is a bijection @xmath32 between permutation tableaux of length @xmath33 and alternative tableaux of length @xmath0 . if @xmath34 is labeled by @xmath7 , and @xmath35",
    "is the set @xmath7 minus its smallest element , then we label @xmath36 by @xmath35 , and we have :    * columns of @xmath34 with a @xmath16 in their top row correspond to free columns of @xmath36 ; * unrestricted rows of @xmath34 ( the top one excepted ) correspond to free rows of @xmath36 , * and cells of @xmath34 filled with superfluous @xmath16 correspond to free cells of @xmath36 .    *",
    "proof : * we just give a description of the bijection and its inverse , and refer to @xcite for more details about the proof . given a permutation tableau @xmath34 , transform all non superfluous @xmath16 to up arrows , and all rightmost restricted @xmath15 to left arrows ; then erase all the remaining @xmath15 and @xmath16 , and finally remove the first row from @xmath34 ; the result is @xmath36 . an illustration is given on figure  [ fig : permtabaltab ] .",
    "for the inverse bijection , given an alternative tableau @xmath14 , add a new top row on top of it , and fill by @xmath16 all cells of this row that lie above a free column of @xmath14 ; then change all up arrows and free cells to @xmath16 , and all remaining cells to @xmath15 .",
    "the resulting tableau is @xmath37 .",
    "@xmath38    , height=188 ]      an important application of permutation tableaux , due to corteel and williams in a series of papers @xcite , is related to a certain model of statistical mechanics , the asep : we will briefly talk about some of the connections .",
    "the asep model(asymmetric simple exclusion process ) is a model that can be described as the following markov chain ( see @xcite ) .",
    "let @xmath39 be real numbers in @xmath40 $ ] , and @xmath0 a nonnegative integer .",
    "the states of the markov chain are the @xmath4 words of length @xmath0 on the symbols @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "positions in the words represent sites , which can be either empty ( @xmath41 ) or occupied by a particle ( @xmath42 ) .",
    "the transition probabilities @xmath43 between two states @xmath44 and @xmath45 model the way particles can jump from site to site , enter or exit the system :    * if @xmath46 and @xmath47 , then @xmath48 and @xmath49 . * if @xmath50 and @xmath51 , then @xmath52 and @xmath53 . * if @xmath54 and @xmath55 , then @xmath56 and @xmath57 . *",
    "if @xmath58 do not correspond to any of these cases , then we set @xmath59 . * finally , we have naturally @xmath60 .",
    "the model is _ simple _ because there can be at most one particle in each site .",
    "we illustrate schematically this model in figure  [ fig : asep ] .",
    "illustration of the asep model ]    it was shown by derrida _",
    "_ et al.__@xcite that this model has a unique stationary distribution , and that moreover this distribution could be computed through the following _ matrix ansatz _ : suppose that we can find two matrices @xmath61 , a column vector @xmath62 and a row vector @xmath63 such that the following relations hold : @xmath64    now let @xmath65 be a state of the asep , and let @xmath66 be the word of length @xmath0 in @xmath67 and @xmath68 obtained through the substitutions @xmath69 , @xmath70 : for instance , the state @xmath71 is associated to the word @xmath72 . then derrida _ et al _ show :    [ prop : proba ] if @xmath73 satisfy the relations  , and words in @xmath61 are interpreted as matrix products , the probability @xmath74 to be in state @xmath65 in is given by @xmath75    if we have a word @xmath76 in the letters @xmath68 and @xmath67 , we can create a shape by reading the word from left to right and interpreting each @xmath67 as a south step and each e as an east step , thus defining the south east boundary of a shape @xmath77 ; for instance the shape of figure  [ fig : shape ] is associated to the word @xmath78 ; if @xmath65 is a state of the asep , we will write simply @xmath79 for the shape @xmath80",
    ". now we can state the connection with alternative tableaux , first noticed by corteel and williams in a series of papers @xcite and expressed in terms of permutation tableaux , and later reformulated by viennot @xcite in the following way :    [ prop : connection ] if @xmath61 are matrices that verify the first relation in  , and @xmath81 is any word in @xmath82 , then we have the following identity :    @xmath83    where the sum is over all alternative tableaux of shape @xmath77 .",
    "in @xcite it was in fact shown that in the case @xmath84 there exists matrices @xmath61 verifying  .",
    "but note that in this particular case , the vectors @xmath63 and @xmath62 become respectively left and right eigenvectors for @xmath67 and @xmath68 .",
    "so from propositions  [ prop : proba ] and  [ prop : connection ] we obtain the following :",
    "when @xmath84 we have : @xmath85    in the asep model where @xmath86 are general but @xmath87 , corteel and williams found a similar expression for the stationary probabilities in terms of certain enriched alternative tableaux , see corollary 4.2 in @xcite , by slightly generalizing the matrix ansatz .",
    "we define different operations on tableaux , and use them to exhibit a natural recursive structure on alternative tableaux .",
    "we denote by @xmath88 the set of alternative tableaux of length @xmath0 , and @xmath89 those with @xmath10 free rows and @xmath11 free columns .",
    "we also denote by @xmath90 and @xmath91 the tableaux having @xmath10 free rows and @xmath11 free columns respectively .",
    "we let @xmath92 be the operation of transposing a tableau , which is the reflection across the _ main diagonal _",
    ", i.e. the line going south east from the top left corner ; in this reflection , we naturally exchange up and left arrows .",
    "we have the following immediate result , which we state as a proposition for future reference :    [ prop : transp ] transposition is an involution on alternative tableaux . for all @xmath93,it exchanges @xmath89 and @xmath94 .",
    "in fact it is easily checked that the transposition operation coincides with the involution @xmath95 defined in section 7 of @xcite for permutation tableaux : more precisely , if @xmath34 is a permutation tableau , then we have @xmath96 , where @xmath32 is the bijection between permutation tableaux and alternative tableaux of theorem  [ th : permalt ] .",
    "note then that the trivial result on alternative tableaux from proposition  [ prop : transp ] demanded a much greater effort in @xcite where the authors worked with permutation tableaux .",
    "as already noticed , the arrows of a tableau are in bijection with its non free rows and columns .",
    "this implies immediately that the tableaux in @xmath89 have exactly @xmath97 arrows",
    ". the maximum of @xmath0 arrows , i.e. the case @xmath98 , can not actually be attained if @xmath99 : indeed , if for instance a tableau has no free row , then the leftmost column of this tableau can not contain any up arrow and thus is free",
    ". a total of @xmath100 arrows in a tableau can actually be reached , and in fact constitutes a fundamental class of tableaux as we will see :    [ def : packed ] a _ packed tableau _ of length @xmath99 is a tableau with @xmath100 arrows .",
    "equivalently , it is a member of either @xmath101 or @xmath102 .",
    "in fact , the following proposition shows that the unique free column of a tableau in @xmath101 is necessarily the leftmost one :    [ prop : packed ] if @xmath103 and @xmath14 is a tableau in @xmath101 , the top left cell @xmath104 of @xmath14 contains a left arrow .",
    "* proof : * first note that the tableau @xmath14 has at least one cell ( so that @xmath104 is well defined ) since tableaux with no cells have at least one free row or two free columns ( note that we chose @xmath103 ) .",
    "@xmath14 has no free rows , so there is a left arrow in the top row in particular .",
    "the column where this arrow lies is necessary free , because any up arrow in it would violate the alternative tableau property .",
    "but the leftmost column of @xmath14 is also free , because the presence of any up arrow in it would force the row where this arrow lies to be free , which is excluded .",
    "as @xmath14 has just one free column , this implies that @xmath104 contains indeed a left arrow .",
    "@xmath38    by transposition , the top left cell of tableaux in @xmath105 is filled by an up arrow .",
    "but there is a simpler way to go bijectively from @xmath101 to @xmath102 when @xmath103 : simply _ change the filling of the cell in the top left corner from @xmath23 to @xmath24_. this also explains why we decided to call these two sets of tableaux with the same name : up to this arrow and the case @xmath106 , they are identical .      for a nonempty alternative tableau with at least one column and no empty rows , we let @xmath107 be the operation of deleting its leftmost column ( so that all row lengths decrease by one ) ;",
    "we define @xmath108 similarly for deleting the topmost row .",
    "when the tableau from which we start is labeled , we obtain naturally a labeled tableau as a result by simply keeping the labels of the remaining rows and columns in each case .",
    "this is illustrated on figure  [ fig : cutr ] .",

    "we define @xmath111 symmetrically .",
    "then we have the following properties :    [ prop : cut ] for all @xmath112 , the operation @xmath108 is a bijection between @xmath113 and @xmath90 ; its inverse is @xmath110 . for all @xmath114 , the operation",
    "@xmath107 is a bijection between @xmath115 and @xmath91 ; its inverse is @xmath111 .",
    "* proof : * we just prove the claim concerning @xmath108 , the one for @xmath107 being equivalent after transposition . tableaux in @xmath113 have no empty columns ( because such columns are free ) , and their first row is free , since a left arrow in a cell from this row would force the corresponding column to be free .",
    "this shows that the restrictions of @xmath108 and @xmath110 are well defined .",
    "it is immediate that @xmath116 is the identity on @xmath90 .",
    "now given a tableau @xmath14 in @xmath113 , we noticed that it has no left arrows in its top row , and that the up arrows in this row occur exactly in columns that are free in @xmath117 .",
    "this implies that @xmath118 is the identity on @xmath113 , and the proposition is proved .",
    "@xmath38    if we do the union of the sets above for all @xmath10 and for all @xmath11 respectively , we get bijections between @xmath119 and @xmath88 , and between @xmath120 and @xmath88",
    ". the special cases @xmath121 and @xmath122 are also of interest , and we get the following corollary :    [ cor : relations ] for all @xmath123 , the operation @xmath108 is a bijection between @xmath119 and @xmath88 , and between @xmath124 and @xmath125 ; @xmath107 is a bijection between @xmath120 and @xmath88 , and between @xmath126 and @xmath127 . therefore for all @xmath123 , we have @xmath128      now we exhibit a more complicated decomposition , which can be traced back to the last part of burstein s work @xcite .",
    "nevertheless in his work burstein did not exhibit a complete recursive decomposition , mainly because he was working with permutation tableaux which are less easy to manipulate than alternative tableaux .",
    "let @xmath14 be an alternative tableau of size @xmath0 , labeled by @xmath7 , and @xmath129 be the label of one of its free rows ( we suppose there is such a row ) .",
    "we compute iteratively a set of labels @xmath130 in the following way : first we set @xmath131 .",
    "then we add to @xmath132 all columns @xmath11 such that there is an arrow in the cell @xmath133 .",
    "afterwards , we add to @xmath132 all rows @xmath10 such that there is an arrow in @xmath12 for one of the columns @xmath11 in @xmath132 added at a previous stage . and so on , we keep adding row and column labels alternatively until there are no new rows or columns to add . the procedure is finite since the set @xmath7 is finite , and in the end we set @xmath134 .",
    "* example : * consider the free row labeled @xmath135 in the alternative tableau @xmath27 on the right of figure  [ fig : permtabaltab ] ; so @xmath136 contains @xmath135 .",
