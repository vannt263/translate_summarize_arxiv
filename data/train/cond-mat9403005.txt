    "in a previous publication , @xcite two of us ( m.k . and k .- h.m . ) have studied the structure factor @xmath2 in the groundstate of the antiferromagnetic heisenberg ( afh)-model on finite rings with @xmath3 sites .",
    "we found that finite size effects die out with @xmath4 and with a coefficient @xmath5 increasing with momentum @xmath6 .",
    "the `` gross''-structure of @xmath2 is well described by @xmath7 for all values @xmath8 .",
    "therefore indications for a critical behavior in the limit @xmath9 can be seen already for all values of @xmath6 .",
    "for this reason the structure factor appears to be more suited then the spin - spin correlators to extract the critical behavior from finite systems .    in the present paper we are going to extend this analysis to the xxz - model with hamiltonian : @xmath10,\\ ] ] which coincides with the afh - hamiltonian in the isotropic limit @xmath11 .",
    "the groundstate properties of the spin - spin correlators at large distances @xmath12 and in the critical regime @xmath13 have been found by luther and peschel@xcite @xmath14 with crititcal exponents : @xmath15 the critical exponent @xmath16 were derived also from the quantum inverse scattering method.@xcite both exponents @xmath17 and @xmath16 are also predicted by conformal invariance.@xcite    the structure factors are defined as the fourier transforms of the longitudinal and transverse spin - spin correlators : @xmath18 the large distance properties of the spin - spin correlators ( [ ce ] ) induce a specific behavior of the corresponding structure factors for momenta @xmath9 : @xmath19 where the critical exponents @xmath20 are given by ( [ sc ] ) .",
    "note that the longitudinal structure factor stays finite for @xmath21 and @xmath22 , whereas the transverse structure factor diverges .",
    "the questions we adress here are the following :    * is it possible to see the specific behavior ( [ sptopig ] ) already on finite systems ? * is rotation invariance in spin space restored in the isotropic limit @xmath23 ? * what is the leading singularity of @xmath24 for @xmath25 ? * what is the leading large @xmath26 behavior of the structure factors @xmath27 in the isotropic limit @xmath28 ?",
    "the answer to the second question is of special interest in view of the results of singh , fisher and shankar.@xcite following ref . , the transverse and longitudinal structure factors @xmath29 behave differently if we approach the isotropic limit from the noncritical regime @xmath30 : @xmath31 where @xmath32 it is well known @xcite that in the noncritical regime @xmath33 the large distance behavior of the correlators is governed by a finite correlation length : @xmath34 which diverges exponentially for @xmath35 . therefore ,",
    "both longitudinal and transverse structure factors stay finite at @xmath36 . in order to see the effect of the divergencies ( [ sjppiginf ] ) and ( [ l1l2 ] ) on finite rings",
    ", one could think of a finite size scaling ansatz of the structure factors : @xmath37 in the combined limit @xmath38 note , however , that the correlation length increases exponentially in the limit @xmath39 .",
    "therefore , extremely large systems are needed , to extract the structure factors @xmath40 close to the isotropic limit . having this in mind",
    ", we did not make an attempt , to see the effect of the divergencies ( [ sjppiginf ] ) on our rings with @xmath41 sites .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we demonstrate , that the longitudinal and transverse structure factors obey approximate scaling laws for all momentum values @xmath42 and @xmath43-values @xmath44 . in sec .",
    "iii , we perform a finite size analysis of the structure factors for noncritical momenta @xmath45 . in sec .",
    "iv we study how the transverse and longitudinal structure factors at @xmath21 , converge to each other in the limit @xmath46 .",
    "finally , we propose in sec . v a finite size scaling ansatz with an appropriate scaling variable , which accounts for all finite size effects at noncritical momenta @xmath47 and at the critical momentum @xmath21 .",
    "in fig . 1 we have plotted the longitudinal structure factor @xmath48 on finite rings with @xmath49 sites and @xmath50 as function of the `` scaling variable '' : @xmath51.\\ ] ]",
    "the normalization in the scaling variable ( [ l3pg ] ) has been chosen such that the limit to the isotropic case @xmath52 can be performed : @xmath53 indeed ( [ l3pg0 ] ) has been found in ref . as the adequate variable in the isotropic case .",
    "looking at fig . 1",
    ", we observe that all data points follow approximately a single straight line with slope one as long as @xmath8 .",
    "for these momentum values finite size effects appear to be small in contrast to the `` critical '' point @xmath21 , where finite size effects are large .",
    "deviations from the straight line in fig . 1 and finite size effects become visible in fig . 2 where we have plotted the difference : @xmath54 versus the scaling variable ( [ l3pg ] ) .",
    "note the surprising behavior of the longitudinal structure factor of the xx - model : @xmath55 it is free of any finite size effect",
    "! this is proven in appendix a using the rigorous results of lieb , schultz and mattis . @xcite for decreasing values of @xmath43 we observe in the differences ( [ d3pgn ] ) a `` fine '' structure with a minimum for larger @xmath6-values .",
    "moreover , there seems to be a maximum for small @xmath6 and @xmath56 values .",
    "let us now turn to the transverse structure factor @xmath57 which we present in fig .",

    "2 and 4 reveals two important differences in the finite size effects of the longitudinal and transverse structure factors @xmath61 and @xmath62 :    * they are zero in @xmath63 , but nonzero in @xmath64 .",

    "6 we have included as well the momenta : @xmath73 which occur on two systems . here",
    "we have assumed that the finite size dependence is described correctly by ( [ djpgn ] ) .",

    "the scaling function at this value can be taken from : @xmath80 and is shown as function of @xmath43 in fig .",
