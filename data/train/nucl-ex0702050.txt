    "during these two decades , unstable nuclear physics has become one of the most interesting fields of nuclear physics .",
    "nuclear fragmentation of heavy - ion beams is utilized for producing secondary beams of unstable nuclei far from @xmath1-stability . for designing experiments with the secondary beams ,",
    "a good knowledge of production cross sections is essential . to deduce the production cross sections relevantly , an empirical parametrization of fragmentation cross sections  ( epax )",
    "is widely used in simulation programs for projectile - fragment separators  @xcite . for consideration of reaction mechanism , fragmentation models based on abrasion - ablation scheme  ( aa models )",
    "are often applied to estimate the production cross sections .    with the recent development of heavy - ion accelerators ,",
    "the number of accessible nuclei lying far from @xmath1-stability line has been increasing .",
    "an example has been shown by the experimental findings of particle stability of @xmath2f  @xcite , @xmath3ne  @xcite , @xmath4na  @xcite , @xmath5 mg  @xcite , @xmath6al  @xcite , and @xmath7si  @xcite , as the most neutron - rich nuclei so far identified for the @xmath8=9@xmath914 elements .",
    "for the new isotope - search experiment , the accuracy to predict the production cross section of neutron - rich nuclei near the drip line is very important to discuss the particle stability of them .",
    "however , the predictive power of the epax parametrization and aa models is not strong enough for specific very neutron - rich nuclei  @xcite .",
    "for instance , although tantalum is often experimentially used as a production target in order to earn the better yield of these nuclei , the target dependence of production cross sections is not taken into account in these models .",
    "instead , we first determined the production cross sections for the observed isotopes , which were then used to estimate the production cross sections and the expected yields for the non - observed isotopes . therefore , to enhance predictive powers for production cross sections , deeply understanding reaction mechanism as well as observing systematic behaviors of production cross sections are necessary .    the validity of the epax parametrization and aa models has been mainly verified for medium and heavy mass fragments via multi - gev high - energy fragmentation reactions .",
    "the epax formula has been also used for the intermediate - energy experiments  ( several tens @xmath10 mev ) since the formula can reproduce reasonably well even at intermediate enegies the production cross sections of stable and unstable nuclei near the @xmath1-stability line . a target dependence of fragment - production cross sections in relativistic heavy - ion collisions is limited only by taking account of the nuclear - size effect  @xcite .",
    "however , the recent experiments show that the production yields of nuclei far from stability line are quite different from the prediction of epax formula , and strongly dependent on the @xmath11/@xmath8 ratio of the target  @xcite .",
    "it is of great interest whether the cross sections measured with different targets factorize in projectile fragmentation at intermediate energies .    in order to confirm the validity of factorization ,",
    "a careful measurement of fragment momentum distribution is necessary for precise determination of the production cross sections . at relativistic energies ,",
    "the shape of momentum distribution for an isotope was found to be a gaussian function  @xcite and the width was well understood with a statistical model  @xcite . on the other hand , the momentum distribution of fragments produced at intermediate energies has an asymmetric shape with a tail at low momentum side .",
    "a theoretical attempt was made to reproduce the asymmetric shape , by taking into account nucleon flows between projectile and target in the collision time  @xcite . in this model ,",
    "stochastic nucleon transfers using a monte carlo method and sequential evaporation were taken into account .",
    "this model can reproduce the low - momentum - side tails , however , due to a large friction force , the whole of predicted distributions are shifted toward the low momentum side much larger than the observed .",
    "this discrepancy of momentum distributions affords a large ambiguity to evaluate the production cross section from the measured yield of fragments .",
    "in addition , the measurement for very neutron - rich nuclei has been performed using very thick targets to earn the yields , so far . as distortions of momentum distributions due to target thickness",
    ", the momentum distributions of fragments can not be obtained from these data clearly .",
    "therefore , the measurement of momentum distribution of very neutron - rich nuclei has become important .    in the present work ,",
    "we focus on the target dependence of momentum distribution of projectile - like fragment  ( plf ) produced by nuclear fragmentation reactions at an intermediate energy .",
    "to investigate the target dependence of the production cross sections systematically , we used two production targets of be and ta . to avoid distortions of momentum distributions due to the target thickness , we prepared relatively thin targets .",
    "we performed the experiment with the riken - rips to eliminate the primary beam and to collect the projectile - like fragments .",
    "the data of this experiment were taken in a wide range for fragment mass including very neutron - rich side  ( @xmath12 @xmath13 3 ) toward the neutron drip - line and light mass  ( @xmath14 @xmath15 3 ) , with a good statistics for momentum - distribution tails . in the following ,",

    "based on the results , we discuss the prefragment production mechanism in projectile fragmentation reactions .",
    "the projectile fragmentation experiment using a @xmath0ar beam was performed at the riken accelerator research facility .",
    "the measurement of momentum distributions of projectile - like fragments was carried out with the projectile fragment separator , rips  @xcite . the @xmath0ar@xmath16 beam accelerated by the ring cyclotron with energies up to 90@xmath10 mev and",

    "the detectors of two 0.5-mm thick surface - barrier - type silicon counters ( ssd1 , ssd2 ) and a 0.5-mm thick plastic scintillation counter ( pl ) were installed for the @xmath31 and tof measurement at f2 . to use two silicon detectors allowed us to deduce @xmath8 number of the fragment independently , and to take correlations between them to achieve good @xmath35/@xmath11 ratio .",
    "both ssd1 and ssd2 have 48 mm@xmath2048 mm sensitive area which is wide enough to accept all particles reaching to f2 where fwhm of the beam profile is 6 mm .",
    "two photomultiplier tubes  ( pmts ) were mounted on both sides of pl ( left and right ) .",
    "a timing of pl was determined with an average of the signals from the left and right .",
    "the tof of each fragment over 21.3-m flight path between the production target and the f2 was determined from the difference of timing signals between rf signal of the cyclotron and the pl timing .",

    ", a part of the kinetic energy of projectile is converted into excitation energies of fragments , and the projectile velocity is decreased . this energy loss in projectile fragmentation reaction",

    "the values of the most probable energies of fragments were also corrected with energy losses in the targets .",
    "the negative shift of data from the solid line of the projectile energy indicates the energy loss by nuclear fragmentation process .",

    "the very light fragments are accelerated in the reaction process .",
    "we note that the acceleration phenomena was also observed in collisions of @xmath95u at 1 a gev with lead , reported by enqvist  @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "no acceleration phenomenon for all fragments @xmath908 was observed in the ta - target data .    except the acceleration phenomenon , no significant difference between both targets was observed in the momentum peak shift for the projectile - like fragments @xmath9020 .",

    "first , the maximum of momentum peak shift is observed for the fragments around @xmath9620 in fig .",
    "[ fig : mps ] for both targets .",
    "secondly , the acceleration phenomenon was observed in light fragments only for the be target .",
    "namely , the most probable velocities of light fragments are beyond the projectile velocity . in the following ,",
    "we discuss the features observed in the momentum peak shift .",
    "the momentum peak shift has been investigated for long time .",
    "many of the reports have shown a linear mass dependence of the peak shift for fragments with @xmath97 .",
    "several formulae are proposed so far to reproduce the momentum peak shift for the heavy fragments produced in peripheral collisions .",
    "we compare our experimental results for the wide fragment mass range with the formulae and make an attempt to introduce a new picture to reproduce the parabolic mass dependence .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : mps ] , four formulae are shown with dashed curves and the labels as greiner75 , kaufman82 , borrel85 and morrissey89  @xcite . for every formula , the momentum shift becomes large when the number of removed nucleons @xmath98@xmath10 is increased up .",
    "this tendency conflicts the present result in the region of @xmath9920 . to compensate for the deviation , j.a.winger et al .",
    "@xcite obtained a formula symmetrized mathematically with respect to @xmath100/2  ( dotted line ) .",
    "however , it still overestimates the momentum shift around @xmath101 .",
    "after all , all of formulae above can not predict the parabolic mass dependence .",
    "the previous investigations were mainly performed in the region of fragments close to the projectile mass .",
    "for whole fragment mass region observed in this work , a parabolic dependence , where the symmetric point is at the half mass of projectile , is observed . as borrel commented first in ref .",
    "@xcite , the symmetric behavior of the velocity shift implies another mechanism less costly , compared with the removal of individual nucleons",
    ". the mechanism may be a process that the projectile splits into two pieces .",
    "then we make a new formula which calculates the momentum shift based on the splitting picture .",
    "first , we assumed that the projectile splits in two fragments which are not exited state . by means of the empirical mass formula of weizscker - bethe @xmath102(@xmath11,@xmath8 ) , where ( @xmath11,@xmath8 ) is the neutron and charge number of nuclei  @xcite , the energy loss in the splitting process is described as @xmath103 @xmath104 @xmath105 .",
    "the change of binding energy shows the parabolic mass dependence of peak shift .",
    "however , the energy loss by the splitting process gives only several tens percent of the value measured as momentum peak shift , quantitatively .",
    "next , we deduce a semi - empirical formula in consideration of the excitation energy of fragments .",
    "the splitting process consumes the kinetic energy of projectile due to the excitation .",
    "here we assume that the energy consumption is proportional to the number of pairs of nucleons destroyed in the reaction , where the nucleons are acting mutually by long range force .",
    "in this picture , the number of pairs of nucleons in projectile is counted with @xmath106=@xmath100(@xmath100@xmath9 1)/2 , where the mark of @xmath107 is the combinatorial which gives the number of ways of choosing m out of n. when the projectile splits into the spectator @xmath14 and the participant  ( @xmath108 ) , the number of pairs of nucleons which decreased by reaction serves as @xmath14(@xmath109 ) .",
    "when one nucleon is removed  ( @xmath14=@xmath1101 ) , the number of pairs which decreased is @xmath1101 , and the total energy loss can be defined as @xmath111  mev .",
    "the energy loss per a nucleon pair is @xmath111/(@xmath1101 )  mev on average .",
    "thus , the kinetic - energy loss in the splitting process can be written as , @xmath112 in the case of non - relativistic beam energy , the energy conservation between projectile and two pieces gives a new formula as follows : @xmath113 if we select the energy loss parameter of @xmath111=8 mev , this formula corresponds to borrel s for the case of one - nucleon removal",
    ". however , the value of @xmath111 may not be 8 mev . in fig .",
    "[ fig : mps ] , the @xmath75 values predicted by the formula were compared with the present data .",
    "the solid curve  ( this work ) was drawn with @xmath111=12 mev to fit the data .",
    "the experimental data may support that @xmath111=12 mev is better than 8 mev .",
    "the acceleration effect can not be explained by a fragmentation model based on the abrasion - ablation picture , in which the projectile always loses the kinetic energy in the laboratory system for abrasion process of nucleons .",
    "the acceleration phenomenon may be peculiar to the @xmath18be(@xmath0ar , x ) reaction , namely inverse kinematics .",
    "no acceleration effect was found in the ta target data . by comparison between both targets , we found two particular features of momentum distributions for light fragments produced in the ar+be reaction .",
    "one feature is the acceleration phenomenon .",
    "the other feature is the existence of le - component .",
    "both phenomena coincide in our data .",
    "therefore , the acceleration phenomenon may be related to the le - component .",

    "@xcite have suggested that the light fragments originate in division of a composite system . in their experiment of @xmath114kr+c and @xmath114kr+al collisions ,",
    "the energy of the kr beam was 35@xmath10 mev , and relatively lower than our experiment .",
    "as a result of their experiment , two components of fission - like fragments were found in the velocity distribution of fragments with each mass number .",
    "the two components may be generated from a highly excited compound system since the average speed of them was equal to the center - of - mass  ( cm ) speed of the incident system . in short ,",
    "it is possible that the le - component and the he - component come from one source .    as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : accel ] , the velocities of the le - component observed in this work are not below but just on the cm velocity .",
    "in addition , the mean energy of he- and le- component is around 80@xmath10 mev .",
    "thus , the observed phenomenon is different from the work of f.  auger et al .",
    "then , we suggest two source model that the le - component and the accelerated he - component come from two sources produced in different reactions , respectively .",
    "one source is an excited compound system from projectile and target nuclei running on the cm velocity .",
    "the source emits light particles homogeneously in angular space and becomes a fragment in the le - component . on the other hand ,",
    "the other source is a hot projectile .",
    "the hot projectile is formed by a strong impact of target nucleus to convert the kinetic energy of projectile nucleus to the internal energy for the excitation of projectile nucleus .",
    "the hot projectile decays to two components again , which consists of a faster component and a slower component than the projectile velocity , like the one - source model .",
    "this two - source model predicts a third component in the momentum distribution of light fragments .",
    "such third component was not observed in our data .",
    "after all , the origin of the acceleration phenomenon has not been understood so far .",
    "neither the acceleration effect nor the le - component were found in the ta target data .",
    "the different situation from the be target comes from the large impact parameter . for a fragment mass ,",
    "the impact parameter in the ar+ta reaction is larger than in the ar+be reaction when the fragment is formed by the geometrical cut .",

    "the experimental results  ( @xmath76 ) and the fitting lines are located far from a prediction of the goldhaber model .    what is the origin of the large width of low momentum side ?",
    "the large width is indeed produced by an energy - loss process in the nuclear reaction .",
    "the energy - loss process for @xmath76 may be different from the `` pure '' fragmentation process , because the width of low momentum side strongly depends on the beam energy . at relativistic energies ,",
    "the momentum distribution becomes symmetric with @xmath76 = @xmath77 . for a low energy beam at 30@xmath10 mev",
    ", the large tail of low momentum side appears obviously  @xcite .",
    "macroscopic friction process of nuclear dissipation is not the satisfactory mechanism for @xmath76 because the momentum peak @xmath75 , which has no significant energy dependence , may also be changed at the same time .",
    "the energy - loss process to produce the width of low momentum side may be explained by nucleon exchange reaction between target and projectile  @xcite .",
    "for instance , transfer mechanism adds one nucleon to the projectile or fragment , the energy per nucleon  @xmath124 may be changed as @xmath125 , where @xmath10 is the mass number before transfer reaction .",
    "since the velocity of projectile is reduced by the nucleon exchange reaction , the nucleon transfer may contribute the low momentum tail .",
    "when the projectile gives a nucleon to the target nuclei , the velocity of the remained nucleons in the projectile does not change significantly . like the effect of momentum peak shift , the change of potential energy in projectile affects slightly the velocity of projectile nucleus . on the other hand , when the projectile picks up a nucleon from the target nuclei , the projectile velocity should be deduced because nucleons in target nuclei are much slow on average at the laboratory system .",
    "thus , we suppose the nucleon exchange reaction as an origin of the low momentum tail .    assumed that the probability of nucleon exchange is described as the poisson distribution and the average of number of transfer nucleons in a reaction is quite small , the transfer process does not contribute the peak shift of fragment - momentum distribution but the large width of low momentum tail .",
    "if the probability of transfer process is small on average , the peak shift of fragment - momentum distribution , which is related to the case of no nucleon transfer , does not suffer from the transfer process to be independent of the beam energy . on the other hand ,",
    "the low momentum width is sensitive to the transfer probability .",
    "we next discuss the linear dependence of @xmath76 as a function of @xmath98@xmath10 .",

    "if the transfer probability is proportional to area of the surface , the probability may be described as a symmetric function with respect to the half of projectile mass . however , the observed behavior has a linear dependence .",
    "so , the abraded surface may not be directly related to the transfer process .",
    "secondly , we think about the overlap volume of projectile and target nuclei , i.e. , total number of nucleons in the participant region .",
    "the region has almost linear dependence as a function of @xmath14 .",

    "one is the nucleon exchange process during the fragmentation process , and another is the effect from the difference of nucleon - nucleon total cross sections  ( @xmath159,@xmath160 and @xmath161 ) .",

    "@xmath76 has a linear dependence as a function of fragment mass .",
    "the linear dependence may be connected from both projectile and target nuclei .",
    "so , the source of transferred nucleons can be assumed to be the participant region .",
    "since the ta target nucleus is more neutron - rich than the be , the probability of neutron transfer should be large .",
    "the nucleon exchange reaction between projectile and target nuclei during the abrasion process may break the factorization of fragment production cross sections .",
    "the difference of the total cross sections between proton - to - proton  ( @xmath159 ) and proton - to - neutron  ( @xmath161 ) may bring the fluctuation of prefragment charge distributions . as a fact known well , the @xmath162 is larger than the @xmath160 and @xmath159 when the nucleon energy is less than 500 mev . in projectile fragmentation process ,",
    "a neutron - rich target nucleus easily knocks out protons in the projectile nucleus , so that the production of neutron - rich prefragments is promoted .",
    "the discussions so far are qualitative .",
    "however , they gives several predictions .",
    "first , if the nucleon exchange process is just the reason of bof , the probability of nucleon exchange reaction becomes large at low energies . the nuclear fragmentation experiments with lower incident beam energies than at our experiment may reveal the large bof effect for very neutron - rich nuclei . secondly ,",
    "if the difference of n - n reaction cross sections causes the bof , the nuclear fragmentation experiment with 100 - 800@xmath10 mev beams should be carried out to confirm the bof for very neutron - rich nuclei .",
    "since the cross section curves of @xmath159 and @xmath161 cross at 500@xmath10 mev , the difference of u - parameter between the be and ta targets might change to be reversed .",
    "the further investigations of fragmentation cross sections at around 500@xmath10 mev are of great interest .",
    "the projectile fragmentation reactions at intermediate energies have been investigated using a 90 - 94@xmath10 mev @xmath0ar beam at riken - rips .",
    "we paid our attention to the target dependence .",
    "measurement of longitudinal momentum distributions of projectile - like fragments within a wide range for fragment mass and its charge including very neutron - rich nuclei has been performed with @xmath18be and @xmath29ta targets . from the momentum distribution of fragments , a parabolic mass dependence of momentum peak shift",
    "was observed in the data of both targets , and a phenomenon of fragment acceleration was observed only in the be - target data .",
    "a linear dependence of the low momentum tail as a function of removed nucleons was found for both targets . as a possible origin of the low momentum tail",
    ", we suppose the nucleon exchange reaction .",
    "we observed large target dependence of the cross sections to produce very neutron - rich nuclei with ( @xmath130)@xmath152 . the deviation shows that the production cross sections of very neutron - rich nuclei far from the stability line do not factorize .",
    "the reaction mechanism was discussed , however the discussions so far are qualitative .",
    "it is much interesting to investigate the target dependence of the cross sections at higher energies .",
