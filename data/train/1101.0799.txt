    "extending some previous work @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite on the rationality of the exponential transform we here go on to consider what we believe is the most general type of domains for which the exponential transform , in an extended sense , can be expected to have a `` core '' consisting of a rational function . around this core",
    "there will then be `` satellites '' of some rather trivial factors , depending on the regimes at the locations of the independent variables .",
    "the `` domains '' we consider will actually be covering surfaces over the riemann sphere .",
    "the terminology `` quadrature riemann surface '' has already been introduced by m.  sakai @xcite for the type of domains in question .",
    "an alternative name could be `` multi - sheeted algebraic domain '' , to extend a terminology used by a.  varchenko and p.  etingof @xcite . in the present work we shall mostly use the latter terminology because we will not emphasize so much the quadrature properties , but rather take as a starting point the way the domains are generated , namely by a pair of meromorphic function on a compact riemann surface .    given a bounded domain @xmath0 , the traditional exponential transform @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite of @xmath1 is the function of two complex variables defined by @xmath2 \\quad ( z , w\\in \\c).\\ ] ] for the unit disk @xmath3 it is ( see @xcite ) : @xmath4 using the schwarz function @xcite , @xcite for @xmath5 , @xmath6 ( [ et3 ] ) can be written @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the rational function @xmath9 and @xmath10 is the characteristic function of @xmath11 . the expression ( [ expelimd ] )",
    "reveals the general structure of the exponential transform of any algebraic domain .",
    "the function @xmath8 is an instance of the elimination function , which can be defined by means of the meromorphic resultant @xmath12 of two meromorphic functions @xmath13 and @xmath14 . the resultant is defined as the multiplicative action of @xmath14 on the divisor @xmath15 of @xmath13 , namely @xmath16 , and the elimination function is @xmath17 . in the case of the unit disk , or any quadrature domain , the relevant elimination function which enters into the exponential transform is the one with @xmath18 , @xmath19 .",
    "this means that we in the present example get @xmath20 @xmath21 as desired .",
    "the aim of the present paper is to generalize the formula ( [ expelimd ] ) as far as possible .",
    "this will involve an extended exponential transform in four complex variables and an analogous extended elimination function in four variables , defined in terms of a conjugate pair of meromorphic functions on a fairly general compact symmetric riemann surface .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "sections  [ sec : cauchy ] and [ sec : resultant ] contain general preliminary material . in section  [ sec : multi ] we introduce the concepts of multi - sheeted algebraic domains and quadrature riemann surfaces and prove that they are equivalent . the main result is stated in section  [ sec : main ] and proved in section  [ sec : proof ] .",
    "section  [ sec : example ] , finally , is devoted to examples , namely the ellipse and neumann s oval .",
    "the cauchy transform of a bounded density function @xmath22 in @xmath23 is @xmath24 typically the functions @xmath22 which will appear in this paper will be like the characteristic function of a domain , or the corresponding integer valued counting function for a multi - sheeted domain . from @xmath25 , the density @xmath22 can be recovered by @xmath26 to be interpreted in the sense of distributions .",
    "if one writes the definition of the cauchy transform as @xmath27 one realizes that it suffers from a certain lack of symmetry .",
    "a more balanced object would be the `` double cauchy transform '' , @xmath28 in fact , this double transform is much richer than the original transform , and after exponentiation it gives the by now quite well studied @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ( etc ) exponential transform : @xmath29 the original cauchy transform can be recovered as @xmath30 at least if @xmath22 vanishes in a neighborhood of infinity .",
    "one disadvantage with the double cauchy transform is that the formula ( [ dbarcauchy ] ) turns into the more complicated @xmath31 on the other hand we have the somewhat nicer looking @xmath32 where @xmath33 denotes the dirac distribution .",
    "now , even the double cauchy transform is not entirely complete .",
    "it contains the cauchy kernel @xmath34 , which is a meromorphic differential on the riemann sphere with a pole at @xmath35 , but it has also a pole at @xmath36 .",
    "it is natural to make the latter pole visible and movable .",
    "that would have the additional advantage that one can avoid the two cauchy kernels which appear in the definitions of the double cauchy transform and the exponential transform to have coinciding poles ( namely at infinity ) .",
    "thus we arrive naturally at the extended cauchy and exponential transforms : @xmath37 @xmath38 if the points @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 are taken to be all distinct , then both transforms are well defined and finite for any bounded density function @xmath22 on the riemann sphere .",
    "for example , with @xmath43 , @xmath44 turns out to be the modulus squared of the cross - ratio .",
    "see @xcite for further details .",
    "here we shall briefly review the definitions of the meromorphic resultant and the elimination function , as introduced in @xcite , referring to that paper for any details . if @xmath13 is a meromorphic function on any compact riemann surface @xmath45 we denote by @xmath15 its divisor of zeros and poles , symbolically @xmath46 .",
    "if @xmath47 is any divisor and @xmath14 is a meromorphic function we denote by @xmath48 the multiplicative action of @xmath14 on @xmath47 .",
    "for example , if @xmath49 , @xmath50 , then @xmath51 .",
    "now the meromorphic resultant between @xmath13 and @xmath14 is , by definition , @xmath52 whenever this makes sense .",
    "the elimination function is @xmath53 where @xmath54 are parameters .",
    "it is always a rational function in @xmath39 and @xmath40 , more precisely of the form @xmath55 where @xmath56 , @xmath57 and @xmath58 are polynomials , and it embodies the necessary ( since @xmath45 is compact ) polynomial relationship between @xmath13 and @xmath14 : @xmath59 we also have the extended elimination function , defined by @xmath60    to relate the elimination function to the exponential transform one needs integral formulas for the elimination function .",
    "if @xmath13 is meromorphic on @xmath45 with divisor @xmath15 , let @xmath61 be a @xmath62-chain such that @xmath63 and such that @xmath64 has a single - valued branch , which we denote @xmath65 , in @xmath66 .",
    "then @xmath65 can be viewed as a distribution on @xmath45 , and its exterior differential in the sense of distributions ( or currents ) is @xmath67 here @xmath68 is the @xmath62-form current supported by @xmath61 and defined locally , away from @xmath69 , as the differential ( in the sense of currents ) of that function @xmath70 which is @xmath71 on the right - hand side of @xmath61 , zero on the left - hand side .",
    "globally @xmath68 is not exact ( despite the notation ) , not even closed . to be precise , @xmath72 where @xmath73 denotes the finite distribution of point masses ( or charges ) corresponding to @xmath15 .",
    "we shall also need the fact that @xmath68 has the period reproducing property @xmath74 holding for any smooth @xmath62-form @xmath75 .",
    "now we have ( essentially theorem  2 in ) @xmath76.\\ ] ] the integrand is a @xmath77-form current with support on the @xmath62-chains @xmath78 and @xmath79 ( because away from these curves the integrand contains @xmath80 ) , so the integral is rather a line integral than an area integral .",
    "in fact , the above can also be written @xmath81,\\ ] ] which perhaps clarifies the connection to the definition of the elimination function .",
    "the boundary of a quadrature domain ( algebraic domain ) is an algebraic curve , but by no means every algebraic curve arises in this way .",
    "however , the gap between the two classes of objects can be reduced considerably by extending the notion of a quadrature domain , allowing it to have several sheets and to be branched over the riemann sphere .",
    "this will take essentially one half of all algebraic curves into the framework of quadrature domains and exponential transforms .",
    "one step in this direction was taken in sakai , where a notion of quadrature riemann surface was introduced in a special case .",
    "below we shall take some further steps .",
    "let @xmath45 be any symmetric compact ( closed ) riemann surface .",
    "slightly more generally , we shall allow @xmath45 to be disconnected , namely to be a finite disjoint union of riemann surfaces .",
    "the symmetry means that @xmath45 is provided with an anticonformal involution @xmath82 , @xmath83 .",
    "if @xmath45 is disconnected then @xmath84 is allowed to map one component of @xmath45 onto another .",
    "let @xmath85 denote the set of fixed points of @xmath84 .",
    "simple examples of symmetric riemann surfaces are @xmath86 ( the riemann sphere ) with the involution being either @xmath87 or @xmath88 . in the first case",
    "@xmath89 and @xmath90 has two components , in the second case @xmath85 is empty and hence @xmath90 has only one component .",
    "one can also think of identifying the points @xmath91 and @xmath92 .",
    "the identification spaces become , in the first case ( @xmath93 ) the unit disk together with its boundary , and in the second case ( @xmath94 ) the projective plane , thus a nonorientable surface .    in general , the orbit space @xmath95 , obtained by identifying @xmath91 and @xmath92 for any @xmath96 , is a klein surface , possibly with boundary . a klein surface @xcite",
    "is defined in the same way as a riemann surface except that it is allowed to be nonorientable and that both holomorphic and antiholomorphic transition functions between coordinates are allowed .",
    "the possible boundary points of @xmath97 are those coming from @xmath85 under the identification . from the klein surface @xmath97 , @xmath45 can be recovered by a natural doubling procedure , described in section  2.2 of @xcite and in @xcite , for example .",
    "the latter reference actually describes several types of doubles ( the complex double , the orienting double and the schottky double ) , but the description in @xcite will be enough for our purposes . in case",
    "@xmath97 is orientable and has a boundary the doubling procedure gives what is usually called the schottky double , named after the inventor of the idea , f.  schottky @xcite .",
    "the idea was later extended to more general surfaces by f. klein @xcite .    continuing the discussion of @xmath45 , @xmath84 and @xmath97 ,",
    "if @xmath45 is connected but @xmath98 disconnected , then @xmath98 has exactly two components , say @xmath99 and @xmath100 , and @xmath84 maps each of them onto the other .",
    "it then follows that @xmath101 can be identified with @xmath99 ( or @xmath100 ) , and in particular that @xmath97 is orientable , hence is ( after choice of orientation ) an ordinary riemann surface with boundary .",
    "if @xmath98 is connected then @xmath97 necessarily is nonorientable .",
    "it is relevant to allow @xmath45 to have several components .",
    "for example , in section  [ sec : example ] we will encounter the double of the riemann sphere , which simply is two riemann spheres with the opposite conformal structure and with @xmath84 mapping one onto the other .",
    "now to the definition of `` multi - sheeted algebraic domain '' .",
    "there are two ingredients .",
    "the first is a compact symmetric riemann surface @xmath102 such that @xmath45 is connected and such that @xmath90 has two components , one of which , call it @xmath99 , is to be selected .",
    "we could equally well have started with @xmath99 , to be any riemann surface with boundary ( bordered riemann surface ) , and then let @xmath45 be the double of @xmath99 .",
    "the second ingredient is a nonconstant meromorphic function @xmath13 on @xmath45 .",
    "[ def : multi ] a _ multi - sheeted algebraic domain _ is ( represented by ) a pair @xmath103 , where @xmath99 is a bordered riemann surface and @xmath13 is a nonconstant meromorphic function on the double @xmath45 of @xmath99 .",
    "two pairs , @xmath103 and @xmath104 are considered the same if there is a biholomorphic mapping @xmath105 such that @xmath106 and @xmath107 .",
    "the equivalence simply means that it is the image @xmath108 , with appropriate multplicities , which counts .",
    "note that also @xmath109 is a multi - sheeted algebraic domain , if @xmath103 is .",
    "trivial examples of a multi - sheeted algebraic domain are obtained by taking @xmath110 and @xmath111 .",
    "then with @xmath13 any nonconstant rational function @xmath112 will be a multi - sheeted algebraic domain , as well as @xmath113 .",
    "some further examples will be discussed in section  [ sec : example ] .",
    "along with @xmath13 , meromorphic on @xmath45 , the symmetry @xmath84 provides one more meromorphic function on @xmath45 , namely @xmath114 with @xmath115 the polynomial in ( [ qpr ] ) for @xmath116 , the map @xmath117 parametrizes the curve @xmath118 ( or , better , its projective counterpart ) .",
    "this parametrization is one - to - one ( except for finitely many points ) if and only if @xmath13 and @xmath119 generate the field of meromorphic functions on @xmath45 ( form a primitive pair in the terminology of @xcite )",
    ". this will generically be the case if @xmath13 is chosen `` at random '' , but there are certainly many counterexamples .",
    "for example , @xmath13 may be already symmetric in itself , i.e. , @xmath120 , and then @xmath13 and @xmath119 is a primitive pair only if @xmath45 is the riemann sphere and @xmath13 is a mbius transformation",
    ". if @xmath13 and @xmath119 are not a primitive pair , then the polynomial @xmath115 in ( [ qpr ] ) is reducible .    in case",
    "@xmath99 is planar ( i.e. , is topologically equivalent to a planar domain ) and @xmath13 is univalent on @xmath99 without poles on @xmath121 , then @xmath122 is an ordinary algebraic domain , in other words a classical quadrature domain . in this case @xmath13 and @xmath119 do form a primitive pair ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the reference to `` quadrature '' can be explained in terms of a residue calculation . in the present generality",
    "it is natural to use the spherical metric on the riemann sphere in place of the customary euclidean metric .",
    "this will remove some integrability problems , and the point of infinity can be treated on the same footing as other points .",
    "quadrature domains for the spherical measure have been previously discussed , at least in fluid dynamic contexts , for example in @xcite ( hele - shaw flow ) , @xcite ( vortex patches ) .",
    "let @xmath123 be a function holomorphic in a neighborhood of @xmath121 and assume , for simplicity , that @xmath13 has no poles on @xmath124 ( such poles will actually cause no problems anyway ) . at least away from poles of @xmath13 we have , by exterior differentiation , @xmath125 therefore , if @xmath13 has poles of orders @xmath126 at @xmath127 then @xmath128 @xmath129 @xmath130 here it turns out that the terms @xmath131 cancel with corresponding terms ( with negative sign ) in the residue contribution unless @xmath119 happens to have zeros at the points @xmath132 . in any case , with or without cancellations , the right member above is of the form @xmath133 i.e. , equals the action on @xmath123 by a distribution with support in finitely many points .",
    "the quadrature nodes @xmath134 are the poles of @xmath135 .",
    "if @xmath13 is univalent the above identity becomes an ordinary quadrature identity ( although for the spherical measure ) of the form @xmath136 holding for all integrable analytic functions @xmath14 in @xmath122 . here the right member is given by @xmath137 , which still is the action of a distribution with finite support .",
    "when @xmath13 is not univalent one should still think of the quadrature identity in the same way as in ( [ quadratureidentity ] ) , just with the difference that @xmath1 is a region with several sheets over the riemann sphere .",
    "the test functions should be allowed to take different values at points lying above one and the same point , but on different sheets .",
    "thus those of the form @xmath138 ( i.e. , those which would become @xmath139 in a formulation like ( [ quadratureidentity ] ) ) are too special .",
    "this is most easily expressed by pulling everything back to @xmath99 , in which case we simply have the originally obtained identity @xmath140 for @xmath123 holomorphic in a neighborhood of @xmath121 , and by approximation for functions @xmath123 holomorphic and integrable ( with respect to @xmath141 ) in @xmath99 .",
    "an equivalent formulation is that there exists a positive divisor @xmath47 in @xmath99 such that @xmath142 holds for every holomorphic and integrable function @xmath123 in @xmath99 with @xmath143 .    a _ quadrature riemann surface ( for the spherical metric )",
    "_ is a pair @xmath103 , where @xmath99 is a bordered riemann surface and @xmath13 is a nonconstant meromorphic function on @xmath99 such that @xmath144 and such that ( [ qi ] ) ( or ( [ qid ] ) ) holds for some @xmath145 ( respectively @xmath47 ) and the indicated classes of functions @xmath123 .",
    "the notion of equivalence between pairs is the same as in definition  [ def : multi ] .",
    "if @xmath13 is meromorphic on @xmath45 then we have @xmath146 where @xmath147 is the order of @xmath13 .",
    "thus we have proved one direction of the following .",
    "a pair @xmath103 is a multi - sheeted algebraic domain if and only if it is a quadrature riemann surface .",
    "it remains to prove that a quadrature riemann surface is a multi - sheeted algebraic domain .",
    "in many special cases this has already been done ( for the euclidean metric ) , see for example @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "we shall discuss here the general case under the simplifying assumption that @xmath13 is meromorphic in a neighborhood of @xmath148",
    ".    it will be convenient to introduce some further notation . with @xmath149 any subset and @xmath47 any divisor on @xmath45",
    "we denote by @xmath150 the set of functions @xmath123 meromorphic in a neighborhood of @xmath151 and with @xmath143 .",
    "similarly , @xmath152 denotes the set of @xmath62-forms @xmath153 , meromorphic in a neighborhood of @xmath151 and satisfying @xmath154 .",
    "we shall also use standard notations for cohomology groups .",
    "now , returning to the previous residue calculation one realizes that what needs to be proven is that if @xmath155 holds for all @xmath156 , for some sufficiently large divisor @xmath47 , then @xmath13 extends to a meromorphic function on @xmath45 .",
    "on @xmath85 we have @xmath157 where the right member is holomorphic in a neighborhood of @xmath85 and can be viewed as representing an element in the cohomology group @xmath158 .",
    "when @xmath47 is strictly positive this group is trivial since , by serre duality @xcite , @xcite , @xmath159 ( here star @xmath160 denotes dual space ) , hence there exist @xmath161 such that @xmath162 in a neighborhood of @xmath85 .",
    "clearly @xmath163 for @xmath156 since the integrand is holomorphic in @xmath99 , hence ( [ qibdryd ] ) reduces to the statement that @xmath164 for @xmath156 . at this point",
    "we may use a general duality theorem ( also related to serre duality ) going back to the work of j.  silva @xcite and g.  kthe @xcite , extended by a.  grothendieck @xcite and , in the form we need it , c.  auderset @xcite .",
    "it states that the bilinear form in @xmath123 and @xmath165 defined by the left member of ( [ duality ] ) induces ( with the path of integration moved slightly into @xmath100 ) a non - degenerate pairing @xmath166 which exhibits each of the quotient spaces as the dual space of the other .    in view of this ( [ duality ] )",
    "implies that @xmath167 , in particular that @xmath168 since @xmath13 is meromorphic in a neighborhood of @xmath121 , ( [ omega ] ) implies that also @xmath119 is meromorphic there , hence that @xmath13 actually is meromorphic on all @xmath45 , as was to be proved .    the usage of the general duality theorems above can be replaced by more direct arguments , like applying ( [ qi ] ) to suitable cauchy kernels .",
    "specifically we may choose , with @xmath169 , @xmath170 where the right member is a kernel which in the case of the riemann sphere is the usual cauchy kernel @xmath171 and which has counterparts with good enough properties on all compact riemann surfaces ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the point @xmath172 is needed in higher genus .",
    "actually the duality theorem discussed above can be proved using this kernel .",
    "let @xmath45 , @xmath99 , @xmath173 , @xmath13 be as in section  [ sec : multi ] , more precisely such that @xmath103 is a multi - sheeted algebraic domain . to account for the multiplicities of @xmath108 as a covering of the riemann sphere we introduce the integer - valued counting function , or mapping degree , @xmath174 pointwise well - defined for @xmath175 .",
    "it is understood that points @xmath91 are counted with the appropriate multiplicities .",
    "set also @xmath176 this is a multi - valued algebraic function in the complex plane which contains all local schwarz functions of @xmath177 , because for @xmath178 one of the values of @xmath179 is @xmath180 .",
    "we will have to make expressions like @xmath181 well - defined , i.e. , single - valued , despite @xmath179 itself being multi - valued .",
    "the natural definition is the following : @xmath182 here @xmath183 denotes the restriction of the divisor @xmath184 to @xmath99 and the right member then is the multiplicative action of @xmath185 on @xmath183 . to spell it out ,",
    "let @xmath186 with repetitions according to multiplicities .",
    "then @xmath187 which is a natural definition in view of ( [ schwarz ] ) .",
    "clearly @xmath188 is an analytic function of @xmath39 in regions where @xmath189 is constant .",
    "now , for the main result , we have two functions which we want to relate to each other : one is the weighted exponential transform @xmath190,\\ ] ] @xmath191,\\ ] ] which can be viewed as a kind of potential of @xmath22 , and the other is the elimination function , which is defined by algebraic means and always is a rational function , namely of the form @xmath192 the latter expression comes form ( [ qpr ] ) together with the observation that the one variable polynomials cancel in the four variable case .",
    "the nature of @xmath193 depends on the locations of the points @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 , more precisely on the the values of @xmath22 at these points .",
    "the main result is the following .",
    "[ thm : emathcale ] let @xmath103 be a multi - sheeted algebraic domain .",
    "then , in the above notations , @xmath194 @xmath195 @xmath196",
    "extending ( [ dbarcauchy1 ] ) to four variables gives @xmath197 which tells that the function @xmath198 is analytic in @xmath39 in regions where @xmath189 is constant , namely in each component of @xmath199 .",
    "hence so is the exponential of it , namely @xmath200    augmenting this we have that also the function @xmath201 is analytic in @xmath199 , away from poles caused by the presence of @xmath179 .",
    "now we claim that it is even better than that : @xmath202 is meromorphic everywhere , hence is a rational function . to prove this it is enough to prove that @xmath202 is continuous across @xmath177 .",
    "it is well - known that @xmath203 is continuous in @xmath39 ( see for example @xcite ) , so we only have to bother about the other factor .",
    "but it is easy to realize that also this is continuous : spelling out as in ( [ schwarzrho ] ) and assuming for example that @xmath189 increases by one unit as @xmath177 is crossed at a certain place we find that the factor @xmath204 changes from @xmath205 to @xmath206 which clearly is a continuous change since the new point @xmath207 starts up on @xmath85 .",
    "similarly for the factor @xmath208    repeating the above argument for @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 it follows that the function @xmath209 @xmath210 is rational in the variables @xmath39 @xmath211 , @xmath41 , @xmath212 .",
    "thus , since also @xmath213 is rational in these variables , it is enough to prove that the formula in the statement of the theorem holds just locally , somewhere .",
    "we may then choose @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 close to each other , so that in particular @xmath214 .",
    "in addition we may assume that this value is the smallest value of @xmath22 occurring on @xmath215 .",
    "the case that it is zero can be treated exactly as in the proof of theorem  6 in @xcite , which concerns the special case @xmath216 .",
    "so let us for example assume that @xmath217 ( the general case will be similar ) .",
    "thus @xmath13 attains the values @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 exactly once in @xmath99 , and these four points on the riemann sphere are close to each other .",
    "let @xmath218 be an arc in @xmath215 from @xmath42 to @xmath40 ( e.g. , the geodesic arc ) .",
    "then the function @xmath219 has a single - valued branch , call it @xmath220 , in @xmath221 , hence @xmath222 is single - valued in @xmath223 .",
    "we may consider @xmath224 as a @xmath62-chain , and as such it has the same role for @xmath225 as @xmath61 has for @xmath65 in ( [ dlogf ] ) , so that @xmath226    if @xmath13 has degree @xmath147 , then @xmath224 consists of @xmath147 small arcs , one of which is located on @xmath99 .",
    "let @xmath227 be that arc and let @xmath228 be the reflected arc in @xmath100 . in the sequel we shall use @xmath229 in the restricted sense @xmath230 .",
    "thus @xmath231 @xmath232    using ( [ elimint ] ) , ( [ dlogf ] ) and ( [ inttau ] ) we now get @xmath233\\ ] ] @xmath234\\cdot\\exp[\\int_{\\tilde{\\sigma}}(\\frac{df}{f - z}-\\frac{df}{f - a})].\\ ] ] here we start by rewriting the last factor according to @xmath235_{\\widetilde{f^{-1}(b)}}^{\\widetilde{f^{-1}(w)}}\\ ] ] @xmath236 note that functions like @xmath237 are single - valued in the present case ( cf .",

    "let @xmath47 denote the domain inside the ellipse @xmath252 with semiaxes @xmath253 and foci @xmath254 .",
    "the exterior domain @xmath255 is known to be a null quadrature domain @xcite for the euclidean metric . for the spherical metric",
    "it is a two point quadrature domain .",
    "indeed , the schwarz function for the ellipse is @xmath256 and for @xmath123 holomorphic in @xmath257 and smooth up to the boundary we have @xmath258 the residues come from the zeros of @xmath259 in the exterior of the ellipse , and straight - forward computations show that there are exactly two such zeros , located on the imaginary axis and more precisely given by @xmath260 thus we have a quadrature identity of the form @xmath261 @xmath262 being the residue of @xmath263 at @xmath264 .    the exterior of the ellipse is the conformal image of the unit disk under the joukowski map @xmath265 thus @xmath266 , or simply @xmath267 with @xmath39 denoting the identity function , is a ( single - sheeted ) algebraic domain .",
    "the same function @xmath13 maps the exterior of the unit disk onto a multi - sheeted algebraic domain , i.e. , @xmath113 is ( or represents ) such a domain .",
    "it covers @xmath47 twice and @xmath255 once , in other words the counting function is @xmath268 since there are several sheets the associated quadrature identity is best expressed in a form pulled - back to @xmath269 , i.e. , on the form ( [ qi ] ) . a slightly weaker form is @xmath270 where @xmath271 and @xmath272 is the residue of @xmath263 at @xmath273 .",
    "this form is weaker because it only uses test functions @xmath274 that take the same values on the two sheets over @xmath47 .      by inversion in the unit circle and a rotation by @xmath275 degrees ( for convenience )",
    "the ellipse transforms into a curve known as neumann s oval @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite with equation @xmath276 the exterior of the ellipse transforms into a bounded domain @xmath1 , and since inversions and rotations are rigid transformations with respect to the spherical measure , also @xmath1 will be a two point quadrature domain for the spherical measure .",
    "the formula is immediately obtained by inversion and rotation of ( [ qiellipse ] ) .",
    "the domain @xmath1 also satisfies a quadrature identity for the euclidean measure ( indeed , both types of quadrature identities are equivalent to @xmath179 being meromorphic in @xmath1 ) .",
    "the latter quadrature identity is somewhat simpler , namely @xmath277    it turns out to be a quite rewarding task to investigate the algebraic curves corresponding to the level curves of the left member in ( [ neumann ] ) , and in particular to determine which of them correspond to multi - sheeted algebraic domains .",
    "most types of phenomena which could possibly show up really do show up among these curves .",
    "this task is what we are going to undertake for the remainder of this section .    in order to simplify a little we first scale so that the quadrature nodes above become @xmath278 .",
    "this means that @xmath279",
    ". then we need only one parameter ( in place of the two , @xmath41 and @xmath42 ) , which we take to be @xmath280 the quadrature identity now becomes @xmath281 holding for all integrable analytic functions @xmath123 in @xmath1 .",
    "set @xmath282 which is the polarized version ( @xmath283 polarizes into @xmath284 ) of the left member in ( [ neumann ] ) .",
    "there are exactly two open sets for which the quadrature identity ( [ twopointqi ] ) holds , namely @xmath285 and @xmath286 = \\{z\\in \\c : q(z,\\bar z)<0\\}\\cup \\{0\\}.\\ ] ] the latter is just the completion of the former with respect to one missing point .",
    "the domain @xmath1 ( or @xmath287 $ ] ) can be viewed as two disks glued together , or `` smashed '' , or `` added '' , and has been studied by many authors , for example @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .    to analyse the level curves of @xmath288 we set , for any @xmath289 , @xmath290 let @xmath291 be the corresponding homogenous polynomial .",
    "we shall keep @xmath292 fixed and just vary @xmath293 .",
    "the real locus of @xmath294 in @xmath295 is @xmath296 it represents the intersection with @xmath297 ( `` the real '' ) of the complex locus in @xmath298 , @xmath299 which has a natural completion in the projective space @xmath300 as @xmath301 here @xmath298 is embedded in @xmath300 so that @xmath284 corresponds to @xmath302 . by real points in @xmath298",
    "we mean points @xmath284 satisfying @xmath303 , and these are the fixed points of the involution @xmath304 . in projective coordinates the involution is @xmath305 .",
    "in addition to the anticonformal involution @xmath84 , the curve @xmath306 has the conformal symmetries @xmath307 and @xmath308 .",
    "let @xmath309 be the compact symmetric riemann surface corresponding to @xmath310 .",
    "as point sets they are identical except for a few singular points on @xmath311 , which are resolved on @xmath312 .",
    "the real locus of @xmath294 corresponds to the fixed point set @xmath313 of @xmath314 .",
    "a first observation is that the function @xmath315 has five stationary points in the complex plane .",
    "there are two global minima , on the level @xmath316 , there are two saddle points on the level @xmath317 and there is one local maximum ( at the origin ) , on the level @xmath318 .",
    "these three values of @xmath293 will correspond to changes of regime for the algebraic curve @xmath319 .    solving the equation @xmath319 for @xmath40 as a function of @xmath39 gives the schwarz functions for the curves in the real locus .",
    "the result is @xmath320 we see that @xmath321 in general has four branch points .",
    "the levels @xmath293 at which @xmath288 has stationary points are exactly those values of @xmath293 for which some or all of these branch points resolve : for @xmath322 the square root resolve completely into second order polynomials , and for @xmath318 one pair of branch points resolves .",
    "let @xmath323 denote the genus of @xmath312 , or equivalently of @xmath324 .",
    "the degree of @xmath294 is four , hence the genus formula in algebraic geometry @xcite , @xcite tells that @xmath325 where @xmath326 is a certain number related to the singular points .",
    "an analysis , carried out in detail in @xcite , shows that @xmath311 passes through the points @xmath327 and @xmath328 and that it at each of these points has two simple cusps of multiplicity one with distinct tangent directions .",
    "in particular , the points @xmath327 and @xmath328 are singular , and it turns out that each of them gives the contribution @xmath71 to @xmath329 .",
    "except for the above two points of infinity , @xmath311 stays in @xmath298 .",
    "thus , what remains of the genus formula is @xmath330 where @xmath331 denotes the contribution to @xmath329 which comes from finite singular points . by ( [ genusformula ] ) , @xmath332 , so there is at most one finite singular point , and this must be visible in the real because nonreal singular points necessarily come in pairs .",
    "@xmath333 for @xmath317 , @xmath294 factors as @xmath334 each factor defines its own algebraic curve and riemann surface .",
    "these have genus zero and are moreover symmetric : the zero locus of each factor is preserved under the involution @xmath335 .",
    "the real locus @xmath336 is the union of two intersecting circles , those of radius @xmath337 and centers @xmath278 .",
    "the intersection points , @xmath338 are saddle points for the function @xmath315 .",
    "@xmath339 for @xmath316 , @xmath294 factors as @xmath340 where again each factor defines its own algebraic curve and riemann surface of genus zero .",
    "however , in the present case they are not symmetric , instead the involution maps each of these riemann surfaces onto the other . the real locus consists only of the two points @xmath341 .",
    "this can easily be understood by observing that the value @xmath316 is the global infimum of @xmath288 .    in both of the reducible cases bezout",
    "s theorem says that there should be four points of intersection between the two curves ( since these have degree two ) .",
    "these intersection points are the two points of infinity @xmath327 and @xmath328 plus , in the first case the intersection points of the two circles ( in the real ) , and in the second case the two points @xmath341 .",
    "besides the above two special values of @xmath293 , also the quadrature value @xmath318 is exceptional .",
    "this is a local maximum value for @xmath288 .",
    "the local maximum is attained at @xmath342 , and the corresponding point @xmath343 on the algebraic curve is a singular point ( since both partial derivatives of @xmath56 vanish there ) .",
    "thus @xmath344 in the genus formula ( [ genusformula ] ) , hence @xmath345 .      * for @xmath349",
    ", @xmath313 has one component and there are no singular points visible in the real .",
    "therefore , by ( [ genusformula ] ) and the remark following it @xmath312 has genus one .",
    "this means that the symmetry line @xmath313 is not able to separate @xmath312 into two halves ( see more precisely discussions in section  2.2 in @xcite ) .",
    "thus @xmath350 has only one component , and it will not generate any algebraic domain ( even multi - sheeted ) , despite the nice picture in the real , with a smooth algebraic curve bounding a simply connected region ( figure  [ picture1 ] , left ) .",
    "@xmath312 can be viewed as the double of a mbius band .",
    "* at @xmath318 the genus of @xmath312 collapses to zero , @xmath313 has still only one component even though @xmath336 has gotten an additional point , @xmath343 , which is a singular point of @xmath311 ( resolved on @xmath312 ) .",
    "it follows that @xmath350 has two components , one of which , say @xmath99 , is mapped conformally onto the quadrature domain @xmath287 $ ] by the analytic function @xmath13 which corresponds to the projection @xmath351 on @xmath311 . * for @xmath352",
    "the genus of @xmath312 is again one , and the singular point @xmath343 in the previous case has now grown up to a curve , hence @xmath313 has two components .",
    "also @xmath350 has two components , say @xmath353 , and @xmath312 can be viewed as the double of @xmath99 ( or @xmath100 ) , which topologically is an annulus .",
    "+ the meromorphic function @xmath354 which corresponds to @xmath351 on @xmath311 is however no longer univalent ( not even locally univalent ) on what corresponds to @xmath99 in the previous case .",
    "therefore this gives a now only multi - sheeted algebraic domain , with @xmath108 consisting of a main piece which contains the points @xmath278 and the origin ( the dashed area in figure  [ picture1 ] , right ) plus a smaller piece around the origin ( the bounded undashed region ) .",
    "the latter piece thus is covered twice , and the two sheets are connected via two branch points of the schwarz function . * for @xmath317 the curve is reducible , hence @xmath312 is the union of two independent riemann surfaces , both of genus zero and symmetric under @xmath314 . in the real locus @xmath355 we simply have two intersecting circles , those centered at @xmath278 and having radius @xmath337 ( figure  [ picture2 ] , left ) . explicitly : @xmath356 @xmath312 is the union of two riemann spheres and can be viewed as the double of two disks . *",
    "for @xmath357 we are back to the case of genus one with @xmath313 and @xmath350 both having two components .",
    "however , the situation has changed in the sense that the involution goes the other way ( like @xmath358 in place of @xmath359 in a right - angled period parallelogram ) , it may be more natural in this case to think of @xmath312 as the double of a cylinder than as the double of an annulus ( even though these two types of domains are topologically equivalent ) .",
    "the real locus consists of two closed curves , one enclosing two branch points close to @xmath360 , the other enclosing two branch points close to @xmath361 , and with @xmath354 as before , @xmath13 maps @xmath99 ( say ) onto the dashed region to the right in figure  [ picture2 ] ( right ) covered twice and the ( unbounded ) undashed region covered once .",
    "* when @xmath316 the two closed curves in the real locus of the previous case have shrunk to two points , the minimum points @xmath362 of @xmath288 .",
    "the curve is reducible and @xmath312 hence is the disjoint union of two riemann surfaces ( of genus zero ) , but these are not symmetric under @xmath84 . instead the involution @xmath84 maps each of them onto the other .",
    "the algebraic curve @xmath336 consists of two pieces , which meet each other in two points of tangency .",
    "this is what is seen in the real locus .",
    "thus @xmath312 can be viewed as the double of the riemann sphere , and @xmath314 has no fixed points . *",
    "when @xmath363 finally , there is no real locus at all .",
    "the genus is one , but now @xmath84 has no fixed points at all ( @xmath313 is empty ) . therefore no algebraic domain ( even multisheeted )",
