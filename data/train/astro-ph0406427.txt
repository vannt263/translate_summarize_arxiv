    "with a redshift of @xmath11 , arp 220 ( ic 4553/4 ) is the nearest and one of the best studied ultraluminous infrared galaxies ( ulirgs ) . the tails observed in the optical , together with the double highly - obscured and compact ( @xmath12 ) nuclei observed in the near and mid - infrared , as well as in the millimeter , strongly suggest that the enormous luminosity of arp 220 , @xmath13 , is the result of galactic merging . nevertheless , the concrete physical process responsible is still a matter of debate : the proposed sources are hidden active nuclei and/or bursts of star formation .",
    "molecular observations of arp 220 provide unique clues to the physical and chemical processes ocurring in the nuclei and their surroundings . in the millimeter region , co observations have been carried out with increasingly high angular resolution @xcite . in particular they have shown that , on the one hand , co emission arises from a region significantly more extended than the nuclei ( @xmath14 ) , and on the other hand that the co(2 - 1 ) to co(1 - 0 ) intensity ratio is lower than 1 , thus suggesting that co mainly traces low density regions ( @xmath15 ) .",
    "observations of molecules with high dipole moment , like cs and hcn , have revealed that the fraction of molecular gas contained in dense clouds ( @xmath16 ) is much larger than in normal galaxies , yielding @xmath17  of dense gas @xcite .",
    "@xcite found that hcn(1 - 0 ) and hco@xmath18(1 - 0 ) peak strongly toward the nuclei , but also show low - level extended emission .",
    "more recently , @xcite have detected emission from the high density tracers hnc and cn , and the relatively low hcn / cn and hcn / hnc intensity ratios were attributed to widespread pdr chemistry .",
    "the launch of the infrared space observatory ( iso ) opened a new window for the study of the physical and chemical properties of ultraluminous infrared galaxies . despite the lack of angular and spectral resolution , the observations of arp 220 s far - infrared spectrum from 40 to 200 @xmath2 m @xcite and of a number of individual lines in the sws range @xcite provided new insights in our understanding of the ionic , atomic and molecular content of the galaxy .",
    "these wavelength regions are of great interest , because the bulk of the enormous luminosity is emitted in the far - infrared , and also because they contain lines of important molecular , ionic , and atomic species .",
    "@xcite reported the detection of the 35 @xmath2 m oh line in arp 220 .",
    "@xcite found that the far - infrared molecular absorption lines of oh , , ch , and  are significantly stronger in arp 220 than in less luminous infrared - bright galaxies while the fine structure lines from ionic species are , to the contrary , extremely weak .",
    "@xcite found that , like in the ulirg arp 220 , the [ c ii ] to the far - infrared luminosity ratio is typically nearly an order of magnitude weaker than in lower luminosity infrared - bright galaxies .",
    "@xcite reported the detection of two ortho - h@xmath0 pure rotational lines , indicating that high masses of gas are subject to pdr conditions and/or shock activity .",
    "although the few other ulirgs for which either full lws spectra or partial scans in the vicinity of the oh lines were obtained also show far - infrared molecular absorption @xcite , the rich molecular lws spectrum of arp 220 is unique for its high signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "the physical and chemical processes that account for the rich molecular far - infrared spectrum of arp 220 can be better understood if quantitative values of the column densities of the above species , as well as their excitation conditions , are estimated .",
    "the presence of oh and , to some extent , of , may be indicative of pdr and/or diffuse interstellar cloud chemistry , and their column densities potentially give an estimate of the uv field in the source .",
    "on the other hand , large amounts of  are produced in non - dissociative shocks ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , where the oh abundance is also enhanced @xcite .",
    "the oh abundance is expected to be generally higher than that of  in fast dissociative shocks @xcite .",
    "ice in grain mantles may also efficiently return to the gas phase through sublimation of mantles in `` hot core '' regions .",
    "but whatever the characteristics of the regions producing the observed molecular features , the lines under study lie at wavelengths where the enormous infrared continuum flux approaches its maximum , and the molecular excitation of high - dipole species should be strongly affected by absorption of continuum radiation .",
    "hence any reliable estimation of molecular column densities require accurate models for the dust emission .",
    "unfortunately iso s lack of angular resolution forces us to rely on plausibility arguments in our assumptions about the regions where the different lines are formed ; some of these are based on general requirements of excitation , and others on conclusions from observations of galactic sources .",
    "the main goal of this work is thus to shed light on the physical and chemical processes in arp 220 , based on detailed model fits of its continuum and far - infrared molecular / atomic line absorption and emission spectrum .",
    "we adopt a distance to arp 220 of 72 mpc ( projected linear scale of 350 pc / arcsec , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in section",
    "[ sec : obs ] we present the iso / lws observations ; in section [ sec : generalresults ] we discuss the line identifications ; section [ sec : cont ] is a discussion of the models for the continuum emission ; section [ sec : modelmol ] presents the models for the molecular and atomic species ; in section [ sec : discussion ] we discuss the implications of the radiative transfer models , and section [ sec : summary ] summarizes our main results .",
    "the full 43 - 197 @xmath2 m spectrum of arp 220 , obtained with the lws spectrometer @xcite on board iso @xcite ( tdt number 27800202 ) , was presented by @xcite .",
    "the grating spectral resolution is @xmath190.3 @xmath2 m in the 4393 @xmath2 m interval ( detectors sw1sw5 ) , and of @xmath190.6 in the 80197 @xmath2 m interval ( detectors lw1lw5 ) , corresponding to @xmath20 .",
    "the lines are thus not resolved in velocity .",
    "the beam size of @xmath21 ensures that all the continuum and line emission / absorption from arp 220 ( co size @xmath22 , * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter syb97 ) lie within the iso aperture .",
    "the data we present here ( coadded tdt numbers 27800202 , 64000916 , and 64000801 ) were reduced using version 9.1 of the off line processing ( olp ) pipeline system which we found to produce a higher signal - to - noise spectrum than olp 10.1 . however ,",
    "we adopted the continuum correction given by olp version 10.1 , which typically gives absolute responsivity corrections with uncertainty factors @xmath23 times lower than are produced by version 9 ( tim grundy , private communication ) .",
    "we performed subsequent data processing , including further de - glitching , co - addition , and scaling , using the iso spectral analysis package ( isap ; * ? ? ? * ) . in order to obtain a smooth spectrum throughout the whole lws range ,",
    "the flux densities given by each detector were corrected by multiplicative scale factors .",
    "corrections were lower than 10% except for detector sw1 ( 4364 @xmath2 m ) , for which the correction was of 15% . thus we attribute a conservative uncertainty of 15% to the overall continuum level .    the lws spectrum of arp 220 is presented in fig .  [ fig : arp220 ] together with identifications of the most prominent lines .",
    "owing to transient effects , the fluxes of weak lines as observed in the forward and reverse scans were found to differ significantly in some wavelength ranges . in these cases , if a line appeared close to the upper or lower end of a detector , the reverse or forward scan was selected for that line , respectively , as has been found to minimize the transient effects ( tim grundy , private communication ) .",
    "nevertheless , the average of both scans was used throughout most of the spectrum . in wavelength regions where two",
    "detectors responses overlap , line fluxes were generally found to be consistent .",
    "the only exception was the   @xmath24 line at 90 @xmath2 m , which showed in lw1 a flux 60% weaker than in sw5 .",
    "we adopted here the sw5 spectrum , but the flux of the above  line should be considered highly uncertain .",
    "the subtraction of a baseline ( see fig . [",
    "fig : arp220 ] ) added additional uncertainty to the line fluxes , particularly in cases of broad features presumably composed of several lines . with the exception of the  @xmath24 line",
    ", we estimate a line flux uncertainty generally lower than 35% .",
    "we note for reference , that for the lws spectral resolution @xmath25 , a line that is optically thick at line center with a line width of 300  and negligible line or continuum re - emission , would show aborption at line center of @xmath26% in fig .",

    "_ oh and : _ the fir spectrum of arp 220 is dominated by unresolved oh doublets ( hereafter simply referred to as lines ) and  lines in absorption , with the exception of the oh @xmath27 emission line at 163.3 @xmath2 m .",
    "figure [ fig : levels ] shows the level diagram of oh , ortho-  and para- , and indicates the lines detected in arp 220 .",
    "lines with very different excitation requirements are observed throughout the spectrum .",
    "the oh lines @xmath28 at 65 @xmath2 m and @xmath29 at 71 @xmath2 m have lower levels at 290 k and 415 k above the ground state , respectively , whereas the  lines @xmath30 ( 59 @xmath2 m ) and @xmath31 ( 58 @xmath2 m ) have lower levels at 305 k and 205 k. strong absorption is also observed in the oh ground state lines at 53 , 79 , and 119 @xmath2 m , as well as in the  lowest - lying line at 179 @xmath2 m .",
    "this wide range of excitation suggests that several regions with different physical conditions are contributing to the observed features @xcite , and one of the goals of this work is to provide a reasonable estimate of the nature of these regions and their relative contributions to the spectrum . on the other hand , several of the lines have complex shapes , with evidence of shoulders suggestive of weaker secondary lines .",
    "in particular , the ground state oh 119 @xmath2 m line shows a redshifted `` shoulder '' , which is detected in both the forward and reverse scans , although with somewhat different strengths .",
    "it could be attributed to the @xmath32oh @xmath33 line at 120.1 @xmath2 m , although contamination by other species such as ch@xmath18 can not be ruled out . also , the redshifted `` wing '' of the  @xmath34 line at 179 @xmath2 m , attributed in fig .",

    "evidence for the latter identifications is strengthened because of the presence of weak line - like features at 155.74 @xmath2 m , and marginally at 151.53 @xmath2 m , which would correspond to the nh @xmath37 and @xmath38 lines , respectively ( see also fig .",

    "c@xmath1 has a strong transition at 153.3 @xmath2 m , but its contribution is expected to be minimal due to the lack of detection of other adjacent c@xmath1 lines ( in particular at 154.86 @xmath2 m ) .",
    "the absorption at 102 @xmath2 m may be contaminated by the h@xmath36o @xmath39 line ( just at 102.0 @xmath2 m ) , but since the h@xmath36o should not be as strong as the corresponding adjacent line of the main isotope h@xmath40o , we regard this identification as also unlikely",
    ". some contribution of nh@xmath1 lines to the 102 @xmath2 m feature might be expected , but they are somewhat shifted in wavelength ( they lie between 101.5 and 101.7 @xmath2 m ) .",

    "* hereafter s99 ) have shown that the two nuclei also account for essentially all the continuum at 25 @xmath2 m . combining both observations , s99 proposed two alternative scenarios to explain the continuum emission of arp 220 from far - infrared to millimeter wavelengths .",
    "our models of the continuum emission are entirely based on these scenarios , which we have examined and refined quantitatively on the basis of our iso 45 - 200 @xmath2 m spectrum .",
    "_ model s@xmath52 : _ in the first scenario ( hereafter s@xmath52 ) , it is assumed that the emission from the nuclei is not significantly attenuated at 25 @xmath2 m by foreground material .",
    "we have simulated the emission from the nuclei as arising from a single nucleus with effective size of @xmath53 . with an effective dust temperature of 85 k , and optically thick emission in the submillimeter , the requirement that the fluxes at 25 and 1300 @xmath2 m arise from the nuclei is fulfilled .",
    "however , the emission at 60 - 100 @xmath2 m , as well as the total luminosity from the galaxy , are then underestimated and a more extended region ( hereafter er ) must be invoked to account for the remaining flux .",
    "we identify this surrounding environment with the extended emission observed in co , hcn , and hco@xmath18 . in this first scenario , then , most of the arp 220 luminosity is produced in the er , which has been modeled as a thin disk by syb97 , and as a warped disk by @xcite .",
    "significantly , if this model is correct , a spatially extended starburst , responsible for the bulk of the far - infrared luminosity is inferred .",

    "the dust mass has been derived by assuming a mass - opacity coefficient of 12 @xmath59/gr at 200 @xmath2 m @xcite .",
    "the parameters that have been allowed to vary in our models of the er are the dust temperature @xmath60 , the diameter @xmath61 ( within the range 500800 pc ) , and the dust opacity ; @xmath56 is fixed to 2 to ensure negligible emission at millimeter wavelengths ( see s99 ) .",
    "_ model s@xmath0 : _ in the second scenario ( hereafter s@xmath0 ) , the emission from the nuclei at 25 @xmath2 m is assumed to be attenuated by foreground dust with @xmath62 , a value which was chosen to be compatible with the silicate absorption observed in s99 .",
    "the nuclei account for the required flux at 24.5 and 1300 @xmath2 m with @xmath63 k , significantly warmer than the @xmath64 k temperature in s@xmath52 and , as before , the emission in the submillimeter is optically thick ( see table [ tab : cont ] ) . in this scenario",
    "as well , however , the flux at 60100 @xmath2 m is again underestimated , and an emitting er must also be involved to account for it .",
    "nevertheless , the luminosity from the warm nuclei in s@xmath0 is enough to account for the observed total luminosity from arp 220 , so that the er merely re - radiates the emission from the nuclei and no extended starburst is then needed to provide the bulk of the luminosity .    figure [ fig : cont]b shows our best fit for s@xmath0 .",
    "the unique parameters that have been allowed to vary in our models of the er are the diameter @xmath61 and the dust opacity ; @xmath56 is again fixed to 2 , and the dust temperature @xmath60 ( shown in the insert panel of figure [ fig : cont]b ) has been computed from the requirement that the heating balance the cooling throughout the source .",
    "the calculation of @xmath60 is carried out by assuming spherical symmetry , with the nucleus , the primary heating source , located at the center of the er . the er is divided into a set of spherical shells to account for the variation of @xmath60 with the distance to the nucleus .",
    "once the @xmath60 profile is calculated , the flux contributions of the attenuated nucleus and the er are computed separately , and added up to give the total flux . despite the good fit to the continuum in fig .",
    "[ fig : cont]b , s@xmath0 implicitly supposes a lack of spherical symmetry ( e.g. the nuclear disk by syb97 ) or some clumpiness , because the derived radial opacity of the er at 24.5 @xmath2 m is 11.3 , whereas the adopted opacity of the absorbing shell in front of the nuclei is @xmath62 . furthermore , we do not rule out the possibility that the er is only partially responsible for the foreground dust absorption of the nuclear emission by foreground dust .",
    "if the er were concentrated in a thin disk as proposed by syb97 , little dust in the er would be expected to lie in front of the nuclei and significant dust absorption would be attributed to another component , `` the halo '' ( see section [ sec : sgrb2 ] ) . therefore our results for s@xmath0 , which assume that the nucleus and the er are spherically symmetric , should be considered only approximate , but suggestive . the intrinsic geometry that underlies s@xmath0 departs from spherical symmetry and implies that the total luminosity , which coincides with the luminosity of the nuclei , is lower than the value inferred in s@xmath52 , where spherical symmetry and uniformity is assumed for each component ( table [ tab : cont ] ) .",
    "table [ tab : cont ] shows that @xmath58 yields a dust mass of @xmath65  for the nucleus , and that s@xmath52 gives a mass 1.4 times higher than s@xmath0 .",
    "since syb97 infer a dynamical mass of @xmath66  enclosed in the inner 250 pc radius , and this region contains the nuclei and most of the inner disk ( the er ) , s@xmath0 with @xmath57 is favoured in our models provided that the gas - to - dust mass ratio is not lower than the standard value of @xmath19100 .",
    "the consistency between the dynamical mass and the mass derived from the dust emission indicates that the ism dominates the dynamics in these inner regions of arp 220 .",
    "it is worth noting that these models may be applied to the source as a whole , as implicitly assumed above , or alternatively to each one of an ensemble of @xmath67 smaller clouds of radius @xmath68 that do not spatially overlap along the line of sight .",
    "the value of @xmath69 determines the absolute scale , and the radial opacity and temperature distribution of each cloud as a function of the normalized radial coordinate , @xmath68 , determine the continuum shape .",
    "identical results are found as long as the above parameters remain constant .",
    "furthermore , both alternatives give identical total masses , but differ in the inferred mean density , which scales as @xmath70 .",
    "@xmath71 gives the lowest mean density @xmath72 , which is listed in table [ tab : cont ] .",
    "typical values of a few@xmath73  are derived for the nuclei , accounting for the emission from molecules with high dipole moment such as hcn , hco@xmath18 , hc@xmath1n and cn ( see also syb97 ) .",
    "for the er we obtain @xmath74 ; since hcn and hco@xmath18 appear to show extended low - level emission @xcite , it is suggested that the actual density is higher than this lower limit or that the gas is clumpy . the low density derived for the",
    "er may also be a consequence of the spherical shape attributed to the er : if the mass we derive for the er were concentrated in a thin disk with full thickness of 32 pc ( syb97 ) , the mean h@xmath0 density would be @xmath75 .",
    "we will adopt the density given in table  [ tab : cont ] , @xmath76 , in the models for molecules and atoms , but will also explore the results obtained with a density one order of magnitude higher than the quoted value .    although both scenarios s@xmath52 and s@xmath0 reproduce the continuum emission from arp 220 over the 25 - 1300 @xmath2 m interval and support the constraints on the nuclear sizes derived from the available high angular resolution continuum measurements , the dynamical masses inferred from co millimeter line observations favour s@xmath0 with @xmath57 for the nuclei .",
    "moreover , as we discuss in sections [ sec : oh ] and [ sec : discussion : er ] , the observed line absorption / emission also favours model s@xmath0 .",
    "we thus adopt scenario s@xmath0 for the detailed modeling and analysis of the line emission and absorption .      in both scenarios , the high brightness and compactness of the nuclei",
    "imply extreme continuum optical depth , corresponding to @xmath77 mag .",
    "this conclusion is in strong contrast with the much more moderate values derived from infrared and radio hydrogen recombination lines @xcite .",
    "the high extinction derived here is the direct result of the measured 1.3 mm continuum flux from the nuclei , 210 mjy @xcite , and the observed upper limit of the corresponding source size , @xmath50 @xcite .",
    "these values imply @xmath78 , which shows that even assuming unexpectedly high average dust temperatures ( e.g. @xmath79 k ) and @xmath80 the dust emission is still optically thick even at 200 @xmath2 m . on the other hand ,",
    "the radio recombination lines observed by @xcite are not affected by dust obscuration , although their predicted fluxes and the derived extinction may be somewhat model dependent",
    ". these very different extinction values may be understood if we assume that the observed h recombination lines , tracing primarily star formation , are formed in the outermost regions of the nuclei , while a buried central energy source , responsible for the heating of dust in the innermost regions of the nuclei and a significant fraction of the galactic luminosity , is weak in recombination lines .",
    "if weak in recombination lines , the buried energy source is presumably weak in pah features and pdr lines as well , consistent with the strong [ c ii ] deficit in arp 220 ( see also section [ sec : modelmol ] ) .",
    "dust - bounded ionized regions , in which most of the lyman continuum from nuclear starbursts or agn is absorbed by dust rather than by gas , may explain these properties of arp 220 , as was proposed by @xcite .",
    "we further argue that the lyman continuum luminosities derived from recombination lines do not empirically rule out the possibility that an agn accounts for more than @xmath81% of the bolometric luminosity of arp 220 , because of the high dispersion of @xmath82 values shown by both starburst galaxies and agn , the range of @xmath83 values derived from different tracers in arp 220 , and the uncertainties in the assumed extinction law and the derived extinction @xcite .",
    "our derived @xmath84(h@xmath0)@xmath85  is high enough to obscure a source of high 510 kev luminosity from one or both nuclei in arp 220 , so that a hidden agn is allowed despite the relatively weak x - ray luminosity observed in arp 220 @xcite . @xcite",
    "have also argued that a hidden agn powers much of the luminosity of arp 220 on the basis of the observed submillimeter continuum excess relative to the 7.7 @xmath2 m pah flux .",
    "the comparison of the spectrum of arp 220 with that of some well - studied galactic sources provides important clues about the regions where the observed lines are formed , while emphasizing the unique features that characterize the extragalactic source . in this sense , sgr b2 ( component m ) is an ideal comparison source , because it shares common observational properties with arp 220 despite the obvious differences in spatial scale ( and indeed possibly in nature ) .",

    "sgr b2 harbors newly born ob stars , ultracompact h ii regions , and hot cores , enshrined in a dusty envelope which is heated by shocks and by radiation , and which radiates a high ir luminosity ( see grc04 and references therein ) .",

    "we will refer to this diffuse component of arp 220 as `` the halo '' .",
    "the dust models described in section [ sec : cont ] set up the basis for the molecular calculations .",
    "these are carried out with the method described in @xcite , which computes the statistical equilibrium populations of a given molecule by assuming spherical symmetry and line broadening caused by microturbulence and/or radial velocity gradients . in the present calculations we have assumed , for simplicity , pure microturbulent line broadening , but some tests showed that the inclusion of a radial velocity gradient hardly modified the results .",

    "we have modeled the nucleus and the er separately .",
    "this is required , in s@xmath0 , by the relatively low dust opacities of the er toward the nucleus as compared with the radial opacity of the er ( see section  [ sec : cont ] ) , and involves inevitably an additional uncertainty .",
    "since the dust in the nucleus is very optically thick throughout the iso wavelength range , model results are only sensitive to the molecular column densities in the outer parts of the nucleus .",
    "it is therefore assumed that only in the outer regions of the nucleus , where the infrared lines are formed , the molecular abundances are different from zero ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for the case of sgr b2 ) .",
    "since dust and molecules are assumed to be coexistent , extinction effects within the nucleus are implicitly taken into account ; they place important constraints on the molecular abundances .",

    ", we have assumed that dust and molecules have uniform abundance ratio throughout the whole region .",
    "the presence of the central nucleus is included in the calculation of the statistical equilibrium populations , but ignored in the calculation of the emergent fluxes to avoid accounting for it twice .    toward the nucleus , absorption of continuum radiation determines the excitation of oh and ; the radiative rates are much higher than the collisional ones even for very high pressure molecular gas , such as is found in molecular shocks ( @xmath97  and @xmath98 k ; hereafter we refer to these values as `` shock conditions '' for brevity ) .",
    "the rate coefficients of @xcite and @xcite were used to check the collisional excitation of oh and , respectively . if widespread shock conditions were present , only the absorption of the lowest - lying lines would be significantly affected .",

    "concerning the er , widespread shock conditions are not applicable because they would involve strong emission in the  @xmath34 and @xmath99 lines and in most oh lines ( hard to cancel by any halo )",
    ". our molecular data are therefore only sensitive to the radial molecular column density @xmath84 and the microturbulent velocity dispersion @xmath100 , so that only these two computational parameters are required to define a model of a given component .",
    "similar to the dust models , models for molecules may be applied to the source as a whole , or alternatively to each one of an ensemble of smaller clouds that do not spatially overlap along the line of sight . besides the scaling relationships pointed out above",

    "variations in @xmath84 and @xmath100 have different effects on the line absorptions .",

    "the next sections are devoted to explaining the details of these calculations and results .",
    "our best model fits for the high excitation lines of oh and  come from model s@xmath0 , and the results presented here will focus on this scenario .",
    "the main difference between s@xmath52 and s@xmath0 consists in the higher column densities and/or broader line widths required by s@xmath52 to reproduce the lines , owing to the fact that @xmath60 is significantly lower in s@xmath52 .",
    "models for the nucleus with broad line widths ( @xmath105 , see below ) , however , predict strong absorptions in some oh and  lines , such as the oh @xmath106 98 @xmath2 m and the  @xmath107 138 @xmath2 m lines , which are not observed . therefore s@xmath0 , which still requires high column densities , is a better fit to the data .",

    "the model for the nucleus reproduces nearly the whole absorption in the oh @xmath109 and @xmath110 lines , most of the oh @xmath111 , and significant absorption in the other lines but by far too weak in the ground - state lines .",
    "it also reproduces the full absorptions in the  @xmath31 , @xmath30 , @xmath112 , @xmath113 , and @xmath114 lines , and significant absorption in the @xmath115 and others . the somewhat low value derived for @xmath100 is required to keep the absorptions weak in some low excitation lines which are marginally or not detected . since low @xmath100 implies low velocity coverage for absorption of the continuum , the column densities that are needed to explain the absolute values of the absorptions in high excitation lines are relatively high .",
    "we stress that this value of @xmath100 must be interpreted as a strong lower limit on the linewidths that would be observed with high enough spectral resolution , because rotation and cloud - to - cloud velocity dispersion would broaden the observed lines .",
    "the co kinematic models of arp 220 by syb97 found a generic value of @xmath116 ; as the authors discuss this value should be considered the joint effect of the local linewidth and the cloud - to - cloud velocity dispersion over a scale of @xmath49100 pc .",
    "our @xmath100 is the local linewidth involved in the calculation of opacities and directly related to the molecular excitation , and thus the kinematic value of syb97 must be considered here an upper limit .",
    "it is worth noting that the above column densities are derived by forcing the oh and  high excitation lines to arise in the same region .",
    "a slight improvement to the fit of the  lines is obtained with even lower @xmath100 , 25 , and @xmath84()@xmath117 .",
    "this may indicate that  and oh toward the nucleus do not arise in the same regions .",

    "we have also explored the most plausible situation that the oh lines are formed within the c@xmath18 region of pdrs ( see section [ sec : cii ] ) : assuming @xmath121 k ( the maximum allowed by the collisional rates of @xcite ) and @xmath119 , radiative rates still dominate over collisional rates , and results are found indistinguishable from those obtained with lower @xmath122 values . only densities above @xmath123  with @xmath121 k would give results significantly different for the ground - state transitions of oh .    the er mainly accounts for the oh @xmath124 163 @xmath2 m line , which is uniquely observed in emission ( but predicted in absorption in the nuclei ) , for more than half of the absorption observed in the oh @xmath125 line , for reemission in the @xmath126 , and for significant absorption in the three ground - state oh lines .",

    ". the expected line flux from the nucleus could be lower if absorption of the underlying continuum by low - excitation c@xmath18 in the halo , ignored in this model , occurs as observed in sgr b2 ( m ) ( grc04 ) .",
    "the bulk of the line emission arises from the er . if the density of the er were one order of magnitude higher than assumed ( section  [ sec : cont ] ) , the modeled [ c ii ] emission would be a factor of @xmath165 stronger than in fig .  [",
    "fig : arp220model ] .",
    "the situation in arp 220 resembles what is found in sgr b2 ( grc04 ) , where the line is emitted mainly from an extended region around condensations n and m , while the strong fir source itself is not associated with corresponding observable [ c ii ] line emission .",
    "the [ o i ] 63.3 @xmath2 m line has been modeled by assuming @xmath84(o i)/@xmath84(oh)=250 ( table [ tab : arp220model ] ) ; although the oxygen abundance is expected to be twice that of c@xmath18 in the atomic region , it is expected that further atomic oxygen exists deeper into the clouds @xcite .",
    "for this reason , a wide range of excitation temperatures is expected for the [ o i ] line .",
    "we have just fitted a single `` effective '' kinetic temperature and assumed also collisions with atomic h. the same densities as assumed above for c@xmath18 excitation are used for o i , and the collisional rates are taken from @xcite .",
    "our calculations show that absorption in the [ o i ] 63.3 @xmath2 m line is obtained , both toward the nucleus and the er , with an effective @xmath166 k , but the line is still too weak to account for the observed feature . given the high o i abundances that are expected in diffuse clouds @xcite , we have added to the model a halo component with @xmath84(o i)@xmath167  ( table [ tab : arp220model ] ) .",
    "this model accounts for the observed absorption at 63.3 @xmath2 m ( fig .",
    "[ fig : arp220model ] ) .    on the basis of the low extinction derived from infrared and radio h recombination lines and the high optical depth derived from our dust models ( section [ sec : extinction ] ) , and the assumption that [ c ii ] emission is expected to suffer extinction similar to that of the recombination line emission , we favor the explanation proposed by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see also section [ sec : sgrb2 ] ) that non - pdr far - infrared emission is responsible for the [ c ii ] deficit in arp 220 .",
    "nevertheless , our continuum models by themselves ( section [ sec : cont ] ) can not rule out the possible role of far - infrared extinction on the measured line fluxes : the derived high nuclear far - infrared opacities indicate that only the outer regions of the nuclei , where the oh and  lines are formed , and the er , are able to contribute to the [ c ii ] line emission .",
    "our model fits can not discern whether the _ intrinsic _ nuclear [ c ii ] emission is negligible or rather is obscured by dust . in either case",
    ", we have shown that the [ c ii ] line is well reproduced by assuming that c@xmath18 and oh are coexistent .",
    "our models support the widespread presence of pdrs in the er . both the high oh and c ii column densities indicate that the uv field from newly formed stars have a profound effect on the chemistry in the er . significant contributions from shocks can be neglected , as was pointed out in section [ sec : outline ] .",
    "the -to - oh abundance ratio is significantly lower than 1 , probably indicating enhanced photodissociation . as pointed out in section  [ sec : cont ] , the density is uncertain , but thought to be in the range @xmath168 .    our models also indicate that the bulk of the [ c ii ] line emission arises in the er . it is therefore likely that star formation is responsible for this emission .",
    "this result is strongly supported by the observations of @xcite , who found that the pah emission is also spatially extended . assuming a `` normal '' [ c ii]/fir ratio , i.e. @xmath169}}/f_{{\\rm fir}}=5\\times10^{-3}$ ] @xcite , the expected _ intrinsic _ fir emission from the er is @xmath170 , i.e. @xmath493% of the total galactic luminosity .",
    "this estimate supports the scenario s@xmath0 that has been used to model the line emission . according to our models , the total fir luminosity ( due to absorption and re - emission of nuclear infrared radiation ) from the er is much higher than the intrinsic ( pdr ) emission .",
    "our estimate of the intrinsic er luminosity is somewhat lower than that derived by @xcite and @xcite , who found a lower limit of @xmath171 , but confirms qualitatively their results .",
    "the starburst luminosity in the er seems to be similar to that of moderately bright infrared galaxies , like ngc 253 @xcite .",
    "the warm mass in the er derived from our oh models is @xmath172 , assuming @xmath158(oh)=@xmath173 relative to h nuclei and the warm h@xmath0 arising from the same volume as the oh . this estimate of mass may be considered an upper limit . from the h@xmath0 rotational lines detected by iso , @xcite estimated @xmath174  of warm gas .",
    "given the uncertain correction by extinction , it is likely that an important fraction of the h@xmath0 emission arises in the er .      the models also indicate the presence of a halo . despite the uncertainties in the column densities of this component , they are typical of those found toward our galactic nucleus : @xmath84 ( , oh)@xmath129  have been also derived in the diffuse medium toward sgr b2 @xcite , and the derived @xmath84(ch)@xmath141  is also similar to that found toward sgr b2 by grc04 and @xcite .",
    "the column densities in the halo derived for nh and are uncertain because they are based on single lines , but they could also exist in a population of molecular clouds located far away from the nuclear region .",
    "assuming @xmath158()@xmath175 in the halo @xcite , @xmath176  is obtained and the associated continuum opacity is @xmath177 .",
    "if we further assume a spectral index @xmath58 , the derived dust opacity at 25 @xmath2 m is @xmath178 , comparable to the value of 1.2 in scenario s@xmath0 ( section  [ sec : cont ] ) . therefore , significant absorption of the nuclear continuum emission is attributable to the halo .",
    "the similarity of the oh column densities in the er and the nucleus may suggest that , at least to some extent , we are observing the same widespread oh component , and that oh is more excited toward the nucleus because of the underlying stronger infrared continuum in that direction . on this ground a pdr origin of the observed oh would be favoured",
    ". however , the inferred high  column density would be difficult to explain in this context .",
    "although  is expected to form efficiently in uv - shielded regions of dense pdrs @xcite , with total column densities similar to those of oh , there seems to be no clear correlation between @xmath84(oh ) and @xmath84 ( ) . in fact , the  column density in the er is significantly lower than that of oh . also , detection of  and , above all , of nh , seem to indicate an additional nuclear component .",
    "oh could also arise in c - shocks @xcite , but it is unlikely that they dominate the oh absorptions because @xmath84 ( ) would then be at least one order of magnitude higher than @xmath84(oh ) . however , an interesting possibility is that those c - shocks , or alternatively hot core regions , are combined with pdrs , i.e. ,  produced there is subject to a strong uv field and thus to photodissociation",
    ". this process may be enhanced if there is hot gas emitting x - rays , like in supernova remnants where the oh abundance is expected to be @xmath179 @xcite , or from a nuclear agn . in the nuclei of arp 220 ,",
    "several compact 18 cm continuum sources indicate the presence of high luminous supernovae @xcite ; however , the extended and external oh required to explain the infrared data suggests a more widespread component .",
    "the diffuse oh megamaser emission found in arp 220 should be related to it @xcite .",
    "soft - extended and hard - compact x - ray emission , detected around and from the nuclei @xcite , could be responsible for photodissociation of  produced in shocks and hot cores , thus enhancing the oh abundance .",
    "in particular , hot cores are expected to exist widely in the nuclei , given the high dust temperatures and densities found there .",
    "the presence of j - shocks , where @xmath84(oh ) is expected to be higher than @xmath84 ( ) except for high enough preshock densities @xcite , can not be disregarded .",
    "the high column densities obtained for nh and  seem to indicate that standard gas - phase pdr chemistry alone is not able to explain the full molecular data in arp 220 .",
    "@xcite predicted for a pdr an nh column density more than two orders of magnitude lower than that of oh , whereas we estimate @xmath84(oh)/@xmath84(nh)@xmath4920 in arp 220 .",
    "the enhancement of nh relative to oh may be more than one order of magnitude . in sgr b2",
    ", grc04 also found a somewhat high @xmath84(nh ) relative to oh , i.e. @xmath84(oh)/@xmath84(nh)@xmath4930100 .",
    "it is interesting that the high nh abundance in diffuse clouds is a factor of @xmath180 higher than predicted by gas - phase chemical models @xcite .",
    "the latter has been used by @xcite and @xcite to argue for grain - surface production of nh . in principle , this process could also help to enhance the nh abundance in arp 220 , because the dust in the nuclei has been found to be warm so that grain mantles could efficiently evaporate , and also because in an enviroment with enhanced cosmic rays , as expected from a starburst and the consequent high rates of supernovae , or an agn , the release of grain mantles to the gas phase by means of sputtering should be also enhanced .",
    "however , hydrogenation of nh should in principle continue until saturation , because indeed we observe  with a column density twice of nh .",
    "the issue that now arises is that , if hydrogenation generally completes , then a very low nh - to-  abundance ratio would be expected , and if it does not complete like in the models of @xcite , the scenario fails because of the low relative abundance found for . in sgr b2 , for example , nh::=1:10:100 ( grc04 ) , and  is found to be fairly abundant @xcite .",
    "one possible solution for the low  abundance is that the already invoked enhancement of cosmic rays deeply affects the ion - molecule gas - phase chemistry . @xcite",
    "have shown that the high nh abundance found in some diffuse galactic enviroments could be explained through cosmic ray ionization of atomic nitrogen , followed by hydrogen abstraction reactions that form nh@xmath181 and dissociative recombination that yields nh .",
    "the slight endothermicity of n@xmath18+h@xmath0@xmath182nh@xmath18+h @xcite is not a problem here , given the high dust temperatures in the nuclei .",
    "if in arp 220 the cosmic - ray ionization of n is enhanced , the above scheme could give rise to high nh abundances .",
    "furthermore , both  and  would be much less abundant if photodissociation is important in those regions .",
    "would be formed primarily in grain mantles through nearly complete hydrogenation , thus again keeping the  abundance low , and released to the gas phase in widespread hot core regions relatively shielded from uv fields .",
    "could also follow this last process .",
    "a chemistry deeply influenced by ion - neutral reactions have been also invoked by @xcite to explain the high emission from hnc relative to hcn in arp 220 and other luminous infrared galaxies .",
    "furthermore , @xcite also found strong subthermal cn emission , indicative of gas at moderate densities and irradiated by uv fields @xcite . in the simplest scenario , the molecular content of arp 220 may thus be interpreted in terms of hot cores submitted to strong uv and x - ray fields , where enhanced evaporation of grain mantles and ion - molecule chemistry induced by cosmic ray ionization are also deeply affecting the relative molecular abundances .",
    "due to its high signal - to - noise , the rich far - infrared spectrum of arp 220 provides a template for understanding the dusty interstellar medium of ulirgs .",
    "we have analyzed the iso / lws spectrum of arp 220 using radiative transfer models applied to both the continuum and line emission .",
    "our main results are : + 1 .",
    "the continuum emission from 25 to 1300 @xmath2 m is well reproduced with a two - component model : ( a ) the nuclei , with effective size of @xmath183 and dust temperature of 106 k , which accounts for essentially the whole flux at 25 @xmath2 m and at millimeter and submillimeter wavelengths , and ( b ) an extended region ( er ) , whose effective size is @xmath184 and which dominates the continuum emission from 60 to 250 @xmath2 m .",
    "the extinction toward the nuclei is very high ( @xmath77 mag ) ; the dust in the er is heated through absorption of radiation emanating from the nuclei .",
    "the spectrum of arp 220 shows molecular lines of oh , , ch , nh , and nh@xmath1 , as well as the atomic [ o i ] 63 @xmath2 m line in absorption and the [ c ii ] 158 @xmath2 m line in emission .",
    "the outermost regions of the nuclei , along with the er , are traced by the lines observed in the far - infrared .",
    "the high excitation lines of oh and  are pumped through absorption of photons emitted by dust .",
    "column densities of @xmath84(oh)@xmath185  and @xmath84()@xmath186  are derived toward the nuclei . in the er , @xmath84(oh)@xmath6  and @xmath84()@xmath9 .",
    "we found it necessary to invoke a third component , or halo , to match the low - lying lines of oh and ; this halo has column densities that are similar to those found toward the galactic center ( @xmath84(oh , ) @xmath8 ) .",
    "the ch line detected in the far - infrared spectrum of arp 220 is assumed to arise from the halo , and the inferred column density is @xmath84(ch)@xmath10 .",
    "this value is also similar to that found toward the galactic center .",
    "models for nh and  indicate high column densities toward the nuclei , @xmath84(nh)@xmath8  and @xmath84()@xmath9 .",
    "the upper limit found for the column density of nh@xmath0 is much lower , @xmath84(nh@xmath0)@xmath152 .",
    "the [ c ii ] 158 @xmath2 m line strength is approximately reproduced by assuming that c@xmath18 is 100 times more abundant than oh . our models predict that the line arises mainly from the er , and that non - pdr far - infrared emission , with possible extinction effects , is mostly responsible for the observed [ c ii ] deficit in arp 220 .",
    "the [ o i ] 63 @xmath2 m line is also matched with an abundance of 250 relative to oh and absorption toward the nuclei , the er , and the halo .",
    "pdr molecular chemistry plays a key role in the er and contributes to the elevated oh abundance at the expense of . toward the nuclei , however , important contributions from hot cores , and possibly from shocks , is most plausible .",
    "the nitrogen chemistry , and in particular the high nh abundance , seems to be strongly influenced by ion - neutral reactions triggered by cosmic ray ionization .",

    "<S> iso / lws grating observations of the ultraluminous infrared galaxy arp 220 shows absorption in molecular lines of oh , h@xmath0o , ch , nh , and nh@xmath1 , as well as in the [ o i ] 63 @xmath2 m line and emission in the [ c ii ] 158 @xmath2 m line . </S>",
    "<S> we have modeled the continuum and the emission / absorption of all observed features by means of a non - local radiative transfer code . </S>",
    "<S> the continuum from 25 to 1300 @xmath2 m is modeled as a warm ( 106 k ) nuclear region that is optically thick in the far - infrared , attenuated by an extended region ( size 2@xmath3 ) that is heated mainly through absorption of nuclear infrared radiation . </S>",
    "<S> the molecular absorption in the nuclear region is characterized by high excitation due to the high infrared radiation density . </S>",
    "<S> the oh column densities are high toward the nucleus ( @xmath4 @xmath5 ) and the extended region ( @xmath6 @xmath5 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the h@xmath0o column density is also high toward the nucleus ( @xmath7 @xmath5 ) and lower in the extended region . </S>",
    "<S> the column densities in a halo that accounts for the absorption by the lowest lying levels are similar to what are found in the diffuse clouds toward the star forming regions in the sgr b2 molecular cloud complex near the galactic center . </S>",
    "<S> most notable are the high column densities found for nh and nh@xmath1 toward the nucleus , with values of @xmath8 @xmath5 and @xmath9 @xmath5 , respectively , whereas the nh@xmath0 column density is lower than @xmath10 @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> a combination of pdrs in the extended region and hot cores with enhanced  photodissociation and a possible shock contribution in the nuclei may explain the relative column densities of oh and , whereas the nitrogen chemistry may be strongly affected by cosmic ray ionization . </S>",
    "<S> the [ c ii ] 158 @xmath2 m line is well reproduced by our models and its `` deficit '' relative to the cii / fir ratio in normal and starburst galaxies is suggested to be mainly a consequence of the dominant non - pdr component of far - infrared radiation , although our models alone can not rule out extinction effects in the nuclei . </S>"
