    "nonlinear discrete systems support discrete breathers ( dbs ) .",
    "these time - periodic and spatially localized solutions are the result of the interplay between nonlinearity and discreteness @xcite .",
    "many studies of dbs have been successfully launched , on such topics as rigorous existence proofs , dynamical and structural stability and computational methods of obtaining dbs in classical models as well as their quantum aspects .",
    "in addition dbs have been detected and studied experimentally in such different systems as interacting josephson junction systems @xcite , coupled nonlinear optical waveguides @xcite , lattice vibrations in crystals @xcite , antiferromagnetic structures @xcite , micromechanical cantilever arrays @xcite , bose - einstein condensates loaded on optical lattices @xcite , layered high-@xmath0 superconductors @xcite .",
    "their existence is also predicted to exist in the dynamics of dusty plasma crystals @xcite .    among several intriguing unresolved questions concerning dbs ,",
    "a central issue is the contribution of dbs to the dynamics of systems at thermal equilibrium .",
    "indeed breather - like excitations have been observed in a variety of different models at finite temperatures @xcite .",
    "for some special models with additional conservation laws semianalytical statements about the contribution of dbs to thermal equilibrium have been derived @xcite .",
    "the question is then whether we can identify the contribution of dbs to various equilibrium and relaxation properties ( like e.g. the charge trapping in dna @xcite ) .",
    "since dbs are dynamical excitations , their contribution will be observable mainly in time - dependent ( or frequency - dependent ) correlation functions , while static correlation functions , e.g. specific heat , only probe the available energy landscape , and are not suitable for detecting dynamical correlations . a good way to proceed",
    "is to use a specific property of dbs and trace its contribution to correlation functions .",
    "another question is whether we can design computational methods to separate the breather excitations at a given time from the rest of the excitations in the lattice .",
    "this would allow us to perform systematic studies of distribution properties of dbs in a given lattice at a given temperature .",
    "concerning the first point from above , we know that in general nonlinear systems in two and three dimensions support breather solutions that have a positive lower energy threshold @xcite .",
    "this is a very important property that can be of help in the detection of dbs in experiments .",
    "in fact for specific one - dimensional lattices this property holds as well .",
    "however the search for traces of these thresholds in correlation functions for one - dimensional lattices at thermal equilibrium turned out to be very complicated @xcite .",
    "there are two reasons for that .",
    "first , dbs in one - dimensional lattices act as strong scatterers of plane waves @xcite .",
    "consequently radiation can be efficiently trapped between dbs , and contribute to a strong interaction between dbs .",
    "it is also hard to find a way for letting the radiation out of the system ( see @xcite ) . secondly frequency - dependent correlation functions probe gaps in frequency space .",
    "although the existence of energy thresholds for breathers leads also to frequency thresholds , the values of these frequency thresholds may become too small to be easily detected @xcite .    in this work",
    "we examine a two - dimensional lattice .",
    "first fingerprints of the db energy threshold in two - dimensional lattices have been reported in @xcite and also in @xcite .",
    "a comprehensive study of dbs in thermal equilibrium and their influence on various relaxation mechanisms was provided by ivanchenko et al @xcite .",
    "we attempt to go sufficiently beyond these studies . here",
    "we present not only the frequency dependence of correlation functions , but also their temperature ( or energy ) dependence .",
    "we then proceed to apply a cooling technique at the boundaries of our system to efficiently get rid of extended excitations in the lattice .",
    "the remaining localized breather - like excitations can then be easily analyzed .",
    "we observe the existence of energy thresholds and provide with novel distribution functions for db energies .",
    "we study a two - dimensional quadratic lattice with one degree of freedom per site .",
    "the equation of motion for the particle at site @xmath1 in a lattice of size @xmath2 with free ends is given by @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the displacement of the particle at site @xmath5 .",
    "the masses of the particles are equal to unity and the interaction between them is harmonic with strength @xmath6 while the on - site potential is of hard-@xmath7 type .",
    "the corresponding hamiltonian from which ( [ 2 - 1 ] ) is derived , is given by @xmath8 here @xmath9 is the discrete on - site energy density which will be used later , and @xmath10 stands for nearest neighbors and implies @xmath11 . for small amplitudes the linearized equation ( [ 2 - 1 ] ) yields plane waves @xmath12 with the phonon dispersion relation @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the wave vector of the reciprocal lattice .    we obtain the energy threshold for breathers using the newton algorithm and the anticontinuous limit @xcite .",
    "we compute breather solutions for different frequencies for coupling @xmath15 .",
    "the phonon band of small amplitude plane waves is located between the frequencies @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "we use a lattice of @xmath18 sites . in fig .",

    "[ fig0 ] that the curve of the total energy of the breather as a function of frequency consists of two branches , separated by a minimum at frequency @xmath20 . in the left branch ( dashed line )",

    ", scaledwidth=100.0% ]    in terms of energy the threshold value @xmath31 provides with a rigorous lower bound - no breathers exist with energies less than @xmath31",
    ". consequently we may expect this feature to be detectable in the temperature dependence of equilibrium correlation functions .",
    "the corresponding order of magnitude of the average energy per site is expected to be in the region of values @xmath32 . while the upper value is simply close to @xmath31 , the lower one",
    "can be obtained by observing that essentially one central cite and four neighboring sites are important for the dynamics of stable breathers , providing with a lower estimated value of @xmath33 . at the same time the frequency gap @xmath22 provides with",
    "a less rigorous bound .",
    "we can only speculate that breathers with frequencies belonging to this gap region are less probable to be excited , because they are linearly unstable .",
    "nevertheless they do exist , and in thermal equilibrium the system may be excited close to these solutions for short times .",
    "we thermalize the lattice using as a first method langevin equations of motion .",
    "we add to the right hand side of equations ( [ 2 - 1 ] ) damping terms @xmath34 and a gaussian white noise force @xmath35 .",

    "for low temperature values the power spectrum shows that the modes with frequencies inside the phonon band are excited . as the temperature increases the power spectrum",
    "is shifted to larger frequencies due to the hard anharmonicity .",
    "additionally we observe that for temperatures @xmath60 and higher the spectrum exhibits a different behavior in the frequency gap region , viz .",
    "shows a decrement near the gap .     as a function of temperature for @xmath61 different frequencies . from top to the bottom : frequency inside the phonon band , @xmath62 ; frequency inside the frequency gap where breathers are unstable @xmath63 ; frequency lies outside the two previous regions @xmath64 ; largest frequency value @xmath65.,scaledwidth=100.0% ]    let us examine the power spectra in detail . in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] we plot the value of the power spectrum @xmath66 as a function of temperature for four specific frequencies .",
    "the top panel of fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] is plotted for a frequency inside the phonon band , the second panel is plotted for a frequency that belongs to the breather frequency gap , while the lower two panels are plotted for frequencies that are located outside the phonon band and the frequency gap region . in the top panel of the fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] we observe a maximum as the temperature increases due to the shift of the peak of the phonon spectrum with temperature in fig.[fig1 ] .",
    "this peak is located at @xmath62 for low temperatures .",
    "with increasing temperature the peak passes through the specific frequency that we chose in the top panel of fig.[fig3 ] .",
    "the characteristic temperature value of this peak will depend on the chosen value of the probe frequency inside the phonon band .    in the second panel in fig.[fig3 ] , where the chosen frequency belongs to the breather frequency gap ,",
    "a crossover is observed at @xmath67 .",
    "this crossover is even more evident in the third panel . in this case",
    "the frequency lies outside the gap region but , at the same time , is very close to it .",
    "a crossover is observed again at @xmath67 , a value that has the same order of magnitude as the energy threshold value @xmath31 that we found in section 2 .",
    "finally in the bottom panel in fig.[fig3 ] a trace of this threshold is still observed , although the probe frequency is located far from the phonon band and breather frequency gap values , and the power spectrum @xmath59 has only small tails there .",
    "thus we do observe a characteristic crossover feature in the power spectra , but not as initially expected upon varying the frequency at a fixed temperature .",
    "instead we observe the crossover for a fixed probe frequency by varying the temperature .",
    "the absence of a clearly observable frequency gap may be due to the fact that the frequency gap itself is rather narrow , that unstable breathers may still be excited and persist for some time with some probability , and that anharmonic extended waves contribute as well .",
    "an interesting question is why the observed crossover upon varying the temperature is showing a maximum or similar cusp for frequencies close to the frequency gap , and an ( although bearly visible ) opposite behavior at larger probe frequencies ( as seen in the bottom panel in fig.[fig3 ] ) .",
    "a possible answer is that for low temperatures only occasionally breathers are excited , and the shift of frequency contributions to higher values with increasing temperature is as well caused by simple hard anharmonicity effects .",
    "however once the temperature reaches the threshold value for breathers , breathers with larger energies are easily excited as well .",
    "this will cause a depletion of the power spectra at lower frequencies , at the expense of the increase at higher frequencies , just as observed in fig.[fig3 ] .",
    "still the above argumentation shows that it is hard to separate the contribution of anharmonic phonons from that of breathers .",
    "we clearly are in need of a technique which does this separation",
    ". the next chapter will provide with a solution to this problem .",
    "as already discussed in the introduction , dbs act as strong point - like scatterers of plane waves @xcite . in one - dimensional lattices",
    "this circumstance makes it hard to let the delocalized radiative part of excitations out of the system @xcite .",
    "however in two - dimensional ( and even more efficiently in three - dimensional ) systems point - like scatterers will not hinder plane waves from moving around such an obstacle . consequently we may attach dissipative boundaries to our lattice , and expect the radiation to disappear from the system during a reasonable short time , leaving the immobile localized excitations behind .",
    "such cooling techniques have been used for studying breather relaxations @xcite,@xcite,@xcite .",
    "here we are only interested in letting the radiation out and being left with dbs .",
    "we study an ensemble of @xmath68 different realizations that correspond to the same initial energy per site @xmath69 .",
    "we thermalize the system in another way here .",
    "we start the system with a given initial energy @xmath69 , i.e. we integrate the system for 1000 time units using initially random displacements for the particles .",
    "after that dissipative boundaries are switched on for a given transient of time .",
    "this is done here by adding a friction term to the boundary sites of a @xmath70 lattice with friction constant @xmath71 for some cooling time @xmath72 .",
    "while much more sophisticated ways of reflectionless dissipative boundaries can be implemented @xcite , this simple method suffices for the results presented below .",
    "the effect of the dissipative boundary is shown in figs.[figdiss1],[figdiss2 ] where the energy per site remaining in the lattice is plotted as a function of time , both in normal and in logarithmic units .",

    "but in logarithmic units .",
    ", scaledwidth=100.0% ]    we clearly observe that after some transient behavior the lattice energy density changes rather slowly , indicating the expected outcome - delocalized excitations left the system , leaving the localized ones behind . both fig.[figdiss1 ] and especially fig.[figdiss2 ]",
    "show that the characteristic waiting time increases with increasing initial energy density from roughly @xmath73 up to @xmath74 .",
    "this can be observed from the shift of the inflection points in fig.[figdiss2 ] . in the following",
    "we will use a cooling time @xmath75 , but we will also compare with shorter cooling times .    in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] we plot the total energy that remains in the lattice ( excluding the sites that belong to the boundaries ) per site and per number of realizations @xmath76 as a function of initial energy @xmath69 .",

    "for clarity the inset is for the same data but with linear axis scaling .",
    "we observe a crossover for @xmath77 .",
    "we fit the curve of @xmath78 first using @xmath79 with parameters a and @xmath80 .",
    "this holds assuming that only breathers with @xmath80 will be excited .",

    "while the low energy region of the numerical data is well reproduced , the high energy data are underestimated with ( [ fit1 ] ) and overestimated with ( [ fit2 ] ) .",

    "the db energy threshold is visible in all the subgraphs except the first two subgraphs where the initial energy @xmath69 is very low and dbs can not be formed .",
    "we also clearly see that already for energies @xmath102 a whole distribution of breather energies is obtained , with maximum breather energies being twice larger compared to the minimum db energy .",
    "note that the observed energy gaps are very close to the value 0.17 .",

    ", scaledwidth=100.0% ]    the observed increase of @xmath99 for small @xmath76 and large temperatures may be due to the fact that at these large temperatures the cooling time @xmath72 was too short , leaving delocalized excitations inside the system .",
    "we will provide with further evidence for the correctness of this conclusion .",
    "the above analysis suggested that to some accuracy the excitations in the lattice at thermal equilibrium can be considered as a sum of localized and delocalized excitations .",

    "moerover , we observe very clearly that the frequency gap @xmath22 is depleted here , indicating that unstable dbs decay during the cooling time and radiate their energy into the dissipative boundary , even if they were present to some extent in thermal equilibrium .",
    "thus the presented way of separating localized from delocalized excitations in thermal equilibrium allows also to quantitatively determine the contribution of dbs to correlation functions .",
    "finally we observe that at the largest temperatures considered , some nonzero statistical weight is observed in the frequency region of the phonon band and even below it .",
    "this confirms our previous expectation , that at these large temperatures the cooling times are probably not long enough to let the extended excitations out of the system .",
    "a possible reason may be that at these large temperatures many dbs are coexisting in the system .",
    "extended waves will spend more time to diffuse around these scattering centers .",
    "dbs could even form temporary percolation networks which would hinder the escape of waves even more efficiently .",
    "our results show that discrete breathers ( dbs ) leave clear and detectable fingerprints in the thermal equilibrium properties of nonlinear lattices . using the case of a two - dimensional lattice",
    ", we demonstrated the persistence of an energy threshold for the existence of dbs in time - dependent correlation functions by observing weak crossover features .",
    "moreover , we used the technique of boundary cooling to separate the localized excitation part at thermal equilibrium from the delocalized ones .",
    "this allows us to study statistical properties of db excitations in thermal equilibrium , e.g. their contribution to the abovementioned correlation functions .",
    "this simple step allowed us to unambiguously confirm the presence of the energy threshold for dbs in thermal equilibrium .",
    "we furthermore confirm that the frequency gap ( which corresponds to the excitation of unstable dbs ) is depleted after the separation procedure .",
    "thus we conclude that unstable dbs are not contributing to dynamical correlations at thermal equilibrium . by comparing the spectra of the system at thermal equilibrium with the spectra of the db part only",
    ", we can provide with reliable statistical weights of both the delocalized and localized excitation parts of the system at thermal equilibrium at one and the same frequency .",
    "it seems to be very difficult to provide with a similar cooling and separation procedure in any realistic experimental setup , despite the fact that dbs have been observed in a variety of different systems . that makes computational studies of db properties at thermal equilibrium a unique way of gaining further understanding of the relaxation and excitation properties of complex lattices .    with this simple technique , which certainly needs more refinement , we are now able to reliably compute various statistical contributions of dbs , including also correlation effects between dbs and delocalized excitations . the door is thus open for starting serious analytical work on dbs in thermal equilibrium , since the presented new numerical tools will allow for a much more refined testing of various theories as compared to simulations of thermal equilibrium only .",
