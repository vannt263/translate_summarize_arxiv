    "several great successes in geometric analysis continue to be achieved through _ ricci flow _ , a technique introduced by hamilton  @xcite around @xmath1 years ago .",
    "this is a way of evolving riemannian metrics @xmath2 on a manifold @xmath3 via the geometric pde @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the ricci tensor of @xmath2 .",
    "the underlying theme in applications of this technique is that the ricci flow of riemannian metrics , similarly to the heat flow of temperature distributions and other diffusion processes , should have regularizing properties that eventually evolve a metric to some _ canonical _ or _",
    "best _ metric on @xmath3 , whose existence allows to draw topological conclusions about @xmath3 .",
    "a fundamental step to carry out geometric applications is understanding the behavior of curvature conditions along the flow . in his seminal paper  @xcite",
    ", hamilton proved that preserves nonnegative ricci curvature @xmath6 and nonnegative sectional curvature @xmath7 on closed @xmath8-manifolds , as well as nonnegative scalar curvature in closed manifolds of all dimensions .",
    "hamilton also proved that positive - semidefiniteness of the curvature operator is preserved in closed manifolds of all dimensions  @xcite , and nonnegative isotropic curvature is preserved on closed @xmath0-manifolds  @xcite . independently",
    ", brendle and schoen  @xcite and nguyen  @xcite generalized the latter to closed manifolds of all dimensions .",
    "an elegant and unified approach to proving invariance of all the above curvature nonnegativity conditions under the ricci flow was developed by wilking  @xcite .    on the opposite side ,",
    "several curvature conditions have been shown not to be preserved by .",
    "for instance , mximo  @xcite constructed khler metrics on @xmath0-manifolds with @xmath9 or @xmath10 ( but without @xmath11 ) that evolve to metrics with mixed ricci curvature .",
    "bhm and wilking  @xcite exhibited homogeneous metrics with @xmath12 that develop mixed ricci curvature in dimension @xmath13 , and mixed sectional curvature in dimension @xmath14 .",
    "the latter behavior was shown to be generic among homogeneous metrics on these manifolds by abiev and nikonorov  @xcite . finally , _",
    "noncompact _ examples of complete manifolds with @xmath11 that develop mixed sectional curvature in all dimensions @xmath15 were found by ni  @xcite . nevertheless , the existence of closed manifolds exhibiting such behavior in dimensions @xmath0 and @xmath16 remained unsettled .",
    "the main result of this paper is that many such examples exist :    there exist metrics with @xmath11 on @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , and @xmath20 that immediately lose this property when evolved via ricci  flow .    by taking products of the above manifolds with spheres ,",
    "one easily concludes :    ricci flow does not preserve @xmath11 on closed manifolds of any dimension  @xmath15 .",
    "we remark that the @xmath0-manifolds listed in the theorem , together with @xmath21 , are the only closed simply - connected @xmath0-manifolds currently known to admit metrics with @xmath11 .",
    "conjecturally , this list is complete . furthermore , the manifolds in the theorem are the only closed simply - connected @xmath0-manifolds that carry a _",
    "cohomogeneity one _ action , i.e. , an isometric action whose orbit space is @xmath22-dimensional .",
    "the metrics with @xmath11 used as initial data were introduced by grove and ziller  @xcite and are invariant under these large isometry groups , hence so are their ricci flow evolution . exploiting the fact that isometries are preserved , one may translate the ricci flow equation into a more accessible system of coupled pdes in only @xmath23 variables ( one for time and one for space ) , see proposition  [ prop : rfequations ] .",
    "this allows us to explicitly compute the first variation of the sectional curvature of certain initially flat planes and determine it is negative , hence the manifold immediately acquires some negatively curved planes under the flow .",
    "similar cohomogeneity one frameworks were previously employed by bhm  @xcite and dancer and wang  @xcite to construct einstein metrics and ricci solitons , by pulemotov  @xcite to study ricci flow on manifolds with boundary , and implicitly in several other recent works including @xcite .",
    "it is our hope that this unifying viewpoint of _ cohomogeneity one ricci flow _ will be more systematically studied in the future , mirroring the ongoing study of _ homogeneous ricci flow _ pioneered by lauret  @xcite , bhm  @xcite , bhm and lafuente  @xcite , and others , in which the ricci flow equations reduce to an ode . in some sense , this is the next step in a symmetry program approach to understanding ricci flow .",
    "there are several general issues to be addressed , e.g. , determining under which conditions the more restrictive _ diagonal _ cohomogeneity one ansatz is preserved ( see proposition  [ prop : diagonalpreserved ] for the particular case at hand in this paper , and remark  [ rem : diagonalpreservation ] ) .",
    "similar issues were confronted by lauret and will  @xcite in the case of ricci flow on lie groups , and by dammerman  @xcite for cohomogeneity one einstein manifolds .",
    "other natural future directions include investigating the long - term behavior of cohomogeneity one ricci flow and the types of singularities that it may develop .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "a recollection of facts about cohomogeneity one manifolds is given in section  [ sec : cohom1 ] .",
    "section  [ sec : examples ] has a detailed account of the @xmath0-dimensional examples .",

    "conversely , given a group diagram @xmath64 , where @xmath65 are spheres , there exists a cohomogeneity one manifold @xmath3 given as the union of the above disk bundles .",
    "the full isometry group of a cohomogeneity one manifold @xmath25 is often strictly larger than the group @xmath24 that acts with cohomogeneity one , and we make frequent use of this fact in what follows .      since @xmath24 acts on @xmath25 by isometries , the metric @xmath2 is completely determined by its restriction to the geodesic @xmath36 , which meets all orbits orthogonally .",

    "conversely , in order to define a cohomogeneity one metric @xmath2 by means of the above equation , certain _ smoothness conditions _ must be fulfilled at the endpoints @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "we henceforth only consider cohomogeneity one metrics that are _ diagonal _ , in a sense slightly stronger than in @xcite .",

    "in this situation , the smoothness conditions translate into conditions on the taylor series of @xmath77 at @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",

    "not all cohomogeneity one manifolds admit diagonal metrics in the above sense . a sufficient condition for the existence of such metrics is for the isotropy representation of @xmath43 to split as a sum of pairwise inequivalent representations .",
    "the only closed simply - connected @xmath0-manifolds that admit cohomogeneity one structures are @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , and @xmath20 , see @xcite .",

    "note that the only groups @xmath24 above are @xmath86 and @xmath88 , which have the same lie algebra @xmath89 .",
    "moreover , the groups @xmath41 consist of finitely many copies of @xmath90 , and the principal isotropy group @xmath43 is finite , so its lie algebra is trivial . in particular , on the regular part @xmath66 , there are @xmath8 linearly independent killing vector fields @xmath91 , @xmath92 , and @xmath93 , which are action fields corresponding to a basis of  @xmath94 .",

    "these features are key in the proof of the theorem .",
