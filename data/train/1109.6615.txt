    "i refer the reader to @xcite for a detailed account of this circle of ideas .",

    "well known mirror symmetry heuristics suggest that the mirror of @xmath0 should be a symplectic torus with @xmath1 punctures , which i shall denote @xmath2 . in the paper @xcite ,",

    "recall that the mapping class group of an oriented surface @xmath12 can be described as the group of symplectic automorphisms of @xmath12 , modulo isotopy .",
    "the existence of an action of the mapping class group of @xmath2 on @xmath3 does not follow directly from @xcite , as the model of the fukaya category considered there is not acted upon , in any obvious way , by symplectomorphisms of @xmath2 .",
    ", rather than the full derived category of @xmath0 .",
    "however , @xmath3 has the same group of auto - equivalences of @xmath9 .",

    ", i plan to establish that this action is faithful .",
    "it is worth pointing out that the action i will define is , in an appropriate sense , a categorification of the symplectic representation of the mapping class group , which can be recovered by considering the induced action on the _ numerical _ grothendieck group of @xmath9 ( see remark [ symplectic ] below . for a definition of the symplectic representation , the reader can refer to @xcite , chapter 6 ) .",

    "equivalences of @xmath3 were also investigated in @xcite .",

    "lemma [ punct - bd ] assures us that the only extra relation needed to obtain @xmath31 from the presentation in proposition [ bd ] is precisely @xmath84 .",
    "what is left to do is finding an expression for @xmath83 as a product of humphrey generators . to achieve this , i need to introduce two more ingredients .",

    "the names attached to the maps above follow the conventions of chapter 4 in @xcite , to which i refer the reader for further details on the birman exact sequence .",

    "figure [ fig 2 ] describes the geometry of two classes of simple closed curves in @xmath2 , called respectively @xmath95 , and @xmath85 , @xmath96",
    ". it immediately follows from the definition of @xmath94 that , in @xmath31 , @xmath97    it is not hard to express @xmath98 in terms of humphrey generators .",
    "in fact , by simply applying the definition of dehn twist , one can verify that @xmath99 , and @xmath100 .",
    "now recall that , if @xmath58 and @xmath101 are two simple closed curves in an oriented surface @xmath12 , then @xmath102 ( this is fact 3.7 in @xcite ) .",

    "note that the @xmath72-relation of proposition [ punct ] depends on the degenerate star identity for @xmath111 .",
    "however , because of the evident cyclic symmetry of the problem , in @xmath13 one would have more generally , for any @xmath65 , the identity @xmath117 as a consequence , the following chain of equalities holds in @xmath13 , @xmath118 lemma [ g ] asserts that , in fact , the first of these two equalities can be lifted to @xmath62 .",

    "since the map @xmath130 is induced by the inclusion @xmath131 , and all the @xmath48-s have identical isotopy class as subsets of @xmath132 , we have that for all @xmath133 , @xmath134 applying @xmath130 to both sides of equation ( [ eq g g ] ) , yields therefore the identity @xmath135 in @xmath136 .",
    "as explained by corollary 7.3 in @xcite , there are no torsion elements in the mapping class group of a surface @xmath12 , provided that its boundary set is non - empty .",
    "this is indeed the case of @xmath132 , and thus @xmath137 must equal @xmath8 , as desired .",

    "let @xmath157 be ( closed ) smooth points , such that @xmath158 lies on the @xmath159-th irreducible component of @xmath0 .",
    "it is easy to see that the sheaves @xmath160 , @xmath161 @xmath46 in @xmath3 are 1-spherical , and therefore determine twist functors @xmath162 .",

    "note that @xmath0 is projective , as @xmath170 is isomorphic to a nodal cubic curve in @xmath14 , @xmath171 can be embedded as the union of a line and a quadric in @xmath14 , and , if @xmath172 , @xmath0 can be embedded as a union of @xmath1 linear subspaces in @xmath173 .",

    "@xmath181 is therefore isomorphic to the ( co-)cone of the map @xmath182 where @xmath183 must be surjective .",

    "analogous arguments can be made for all the tensor powers of @xmath175 .    from here , in order to prove the claim , is sufficient to mimic the proof of theorem 3.1 of @xcite ( see also proposition 6.18 in @xcite , in which the argument from @xcite is applied , as here , in the context of singular algebraic varieties ) .",
    "a brief summary of the argument goes as follows .",
    "note first that the functor @xmath168 induces a graded automorphism of the homogeneous coordinate algebra @xmath188 , which , up to rescaling , must be given by the pull - back along an automorphism @xmath167 . call @xmath153 the full linear sub - category of @xmath3 having as objects @xmath189 . as explained in @xcite , one can define a natural equivalence between the restrictions to @xmath153 of @xmath168 and @xmath190 .",
    "further , since @xmath0 is projective , and @xmath175 is ample , @xmath191 form an ample sequence in the sense of @xcite ( for a proof of this , see proposition 3.18 of @xcite ) .",

    "however it is immediate to see that @xmath194 is an involution , i.e. @xmath196 .                  following @xcite , by weak action i mean that this assignment defines a homorphism between @xmath138 , and the group of autoequivalences of @xmath3 modulo natural isomorphism of functors .",
    "the action defined in theorem [ main ] depends on the choice of @xmath206 . however , the action is unique up to conjugation .",
