    "giordano , putnam and skau @xcite showed that a number of interesting consequences would follow from these conjectures , including the existence of a free , minimal @xmath6 action that is not orbit - equivalent to any @xmath3 action .    in this paper",

    "[ nogo ] there exists a free , minimal and uniquely ergodic @xmath3 subshift that does not admit any small cocycles , for which the image of @xmath1 under the ruelle - sullivan map is merely the natural @xmath3 that comes from constant cochains .",
    "in fact , @xmath1 of this @xmath3 subshift is itself equal to @xmath3 ( theorem [ icing - on - the - cake ] ) .    before developing this counterexample",
    ", we consider the significance of the image of the ruelle - sullivan map .",
    "here we work in the setting of @xmath2 actions on tiling spaces .",
    "@xmath0 actions on cantor sets , subshifts , and tilings with finite local complexity ( flc ) are closely related .",
    "every expansive @xmath0 action can be realized as a subshift , the suspension of the @xmath0 action on a subshift is a tiling space with flc , and every tiling space with flc is homeomorphic to the suspension of a subshift @xcite . as a result ,",
    "topological theorems about each of these categories can give important insights into the other two .",
    "we then relate the first cohomology of a tiling space to spectral theory , and to realizations of that tiling space as a cantor bundle over a torus .    if @xmath7 is an aperiodic tiling space with flc , and if @xmath8 , we say that @xmath9 is a * virtual eigenvalue * of the natural @xmath2 action if there exist arbitrarily small changes to the shapes and sizes of the tiles ( aka arbitrarily small time changes ) such that @xmath9 is a topological eigenvalue of the resulting @xmath2 actions .",
    "shape changes can also be used to make the translation dynamics topologically conjugate to the natural translation action on a cantor bundle over a torus .",
    "( henceforth , all cantor bundles over tori will be assumed to carry this action . ) indeed , this is how the authors of @xcite showed that all flc tiling spaces are homeomorphic to suspensions of subshifts . in this paper",
    "we consider which tori can be bases of such bundles after arbitrarily small shape changes . for uniquely ergodic tiling spaces ,",
    "the answer is especially simple :    [ bigtori ] let @xmath7 be a uniquely ergodic flc tiling space whose natural @xmath2 action is minimal and free , and let @xmath10",
    ". then the following conditions are equivalent :    1 .",
    "@xmath9 is in the closure of the image of @xmath11 under the ruelle - sullivan map .",

    "all of the @xmath18 s are virtual eigenvalues .",
    "2 .   there exist arbitrarily small shape changes that convert @xmath7 to a cantor bundle over @xmath20 .",

    "the image of @xmath11 is dense if and only if , for arbitrary length @xmath21 , we can apply an arbitrarily small shape change to convert @xmath7 into a cantor bundle over @xmath22 .",
    "it is worth contrasting theorem [ bigtori ] with theorem 3.9 of @xcite .",
    "the latter theorem states that the existence of small positive cocycles implies that , for arbitrary length @xmath21 , one can break up each tiling into locally defined regions such that each region contains a cube of side @xmath21 .",
    "this in turn gives an easy orbit equivalence between the original @xmath0 action on a cantor set and a @xmath6 action .",
    "however , the converse is not true .",
    "the counterexample we construct to the conjectures of giordano , kellendonk , putnam and skau does not admit small positive cocycles .",

    "by contrast to theorem 3.9 of @xcite , theorems [ bigtori ] and [ morebigtori ] and [ bigsquares ] are `` if and only if '' statements .",
    "since our counterexample does not have elements of @xmath11 whose images under ruelle - sullivan are small , it does not admit large torus fibrations , and does not have any virtual eigenvalues beyond @xmath3 .    for a @xmath3-subshift @xmath23 ,",

    "a particularly nice example , natalie frank s non - pisot direct product variation ( dpv ) tiling , was developed in @xcite and further explored in @xcite .",
    "in fact , we are able to use the shear properties of the frank dpv to prove that @xmath39 .",
    "this proves theorem [ nogo ] directly , without relying on conjecture [ shears ] .",
    "indeed , the methods of this proof generalize to a wide class of dpv tilings , providing evidence for conjecture [ shears ] .    in a related vein",
    ", we consider bundle structures and the return dynamics induced by them , and how this depends on the ( non)existence of small cocycles .",
    "these results are more technical , and we leave a precise statement of the theorems to sections [ finest ] and [ return ] .    in section [ finest ] we consider the question of when tiling spaces ( or subshifts ) admit optimal `` finest '' torus fibrations .",
    "the results depend on whether we define `` finest '' in terms of the volume of the torus or the diameter of the fiber .",
    "in one case the answer depends on the structure of @xmath1 ; in the other case on the image of @xmath1 under the ruelle - sullivan map . in section [ return ] we investigate the implications of the existence of small cocycles for return equivalence in tiling spaces .",
    "two tiling spaces are return equivalent if given any two initial transversals ( one in each space ) there exist clopen subsets of these transversals so that the return dynamics of the translation action induced on these clopen subsets are conjugate .",
    "this study is especially well - suited to tiling spaces for which there exist arbitrarily small cocycles , for then we can find arbitrarily small clopen subsets of a transversal with induced @xmath0 return actions , and the original space is homeomorphic to the suspension of these induced actions . in the presence of arbitrarily small cocycles , this allows us to show that return equivalence is the same as being homeomorphic for flc tiling spaces as indicated in theorem [ returnequiv ] .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows . in section [ subshifts ]",
    "we review the definitions of group cohomology and the ruelle - sullivan map in the context of @xmath0 actions on cantor sets , and review some of the results of @xcite . in section [ tilings ]",
    "we review the connections between minimal @xmath0 actions , subshifts , and flc tiling spaces , and a formulation of tiling cohomology involving differential forms . in section",
    "[ deform ] we show how to implement small shape changes , and prove theorems [ bigtori ] and [ morebigtori ] , leading to theorem [ bigsquares ] . section [ finest ] concerns the existence of `` finest '' torus fibrations , and section [ return ] relates return equivalence to homeomorphisms . in section [ sec - shears ] we investigate the role of shears and discuss conjecture [ shears ] .",
    "finally , in section [ dpv ] we exhibit frank s dpv tiling and show that it has the necessary cohomological properties as a consequence of its shear properties .",

    "all of the @xmath31-supertiles on the top row are aligned , all of the supertiles on the right column are aligned , and the nine - remaining supertiles are aligned .",
    "since the upper right @xmath31-supertile is aligned with both the right column and the top row , and since the upper left supertile is aligned with both the top row and some of the elements of the lower left @xmath407 block , it is possible to get from any @xmath31-supertile to any other within the @xmath303-supertile by following aligned edges .",
    "that @xmath303-supertile sits inside of an @xmath409-supertile .",
    "once at the boundary of the @xmath303-supertile , one can get to any other @xmath303 supertile in the same @xmath409-supertile by following edges of @xmath303-supertiles . by induction , if an @xmath31-supertile sits inside of an @xmath410-supertile , for any @xmath411 , it is possible to go from the given @xmath31-supertile to the boundary of the @xmath410-supertile by following aligned @xmath31-supertiles .",
    "if the two occurrences of @xmath114 lie in the same @xmath410 supertile of some order , it is thus possible to go from either one to a common boundary point , and hence to go from one to the other , only following aligned @xmath31-supertiles . on a generic tiling ,",
    "this is always the case , in that the only infinite - order supertile is the entire plane . since equation ( [ integer - integral ] ) applies for every pair of patches in a generic tiling , and since minimality implies that the pattern - equivariant cohomology of every tiling is the same , equation ( [ integer - integral ] ) applies to all pairs of patches in all tilings .",
    "it is worth noting three key features of frank s dpv tiling that make the proofs of theorems [ mainthm ] and [ icing - on - the - cake ] work .",
    "these features , or features that work just as well , are to be expected from a large class of flc tilings of @xmath413 with shears in both directions .",
    "in fact , there are no known examples of tilings with shears that do _ not _ have these properties , giving support for conjecture [ shears ] .    1 .",
    "in frank s dpv tiling , the 1-dimensional tiling space along the lower boundary of supertiles had no asymptotically negligible ( an ) classes .",
    "this was very convenient , but in cases where an classes do exist , we can fall back on the following argument : + it is impossible for an integral class to be asymptotically negligible without being trivial , since asymptotically negligible means that integrals are determined locally up to @xmath69 , while integrality leaves no room for small uncertainty . thus it is impossible to have an integral class that is a rational multiple of length plus something asymptotically negligible . + next , we must show that an integral class can not be an _ irrational _ multiple of length plus an an class .",
    "equivalently , we must show that we can not have two integral classes whose images in the so - called mixed cohomology ( that is , @xmath1 mod an ) are irrational multiples of one another .",
    "+ this depends on number - theoretic properties of the stretching factor , specifically on the size of the galois group of its splitting field .",
    "we do not know whether our desired property is always true , but it is certainly true whenever the characteristic polynomial has more eigenvalues of magnitude 1 or bigger than of magnitude less than 1 , and in particular is true whenever the stretching factor is a non - pisot quadratic or cubic . note that having a non - pisot stretching factor was needed to get shears in the first place @xcite , and that all constructions to date of tilings with shears have involved quadratic or cubic stretching factors .",
    "the lengths of the supertiles have no common factor .",
    "again , this is a necessary condition for having shears .",
    "if the lengths of all @xmath31-supertiles had a common factor , then the offsets between adjacent @xmath31-supertiles would have to be multiples of that common factor .",
    "it was possible to find a path from any @xmath31-supertile to any other along aligned @xmath31-supertiles .",
    "this is a general feature of dpv tilings , which are set up to be products of 1-dimensional fusions , only with a block ( in this case the lower left @xmath407 block of @xmath408 ) rotated or reflected .",
    "the block remains aligned , the rest of the supertile remains aligned , and it is possible to go from the block to the rest at a corner of the block .    in summary ,",
    "the frank dpv tiling is exceptionally simple to work with , and allows us to prove theorem [ nogo ] directly .",
    "other tilings with shears , constructed from dpv s with non - pisot stretching factors of degree 2 or 3 , are likewise counterexamples to the conjectures of giordano , putnam and skau .",
    "the question of whether _ all _ subshifts with shears are counterexamples ( c.f . conjecture [ shears ] ) remains open .",
    "our main counterexample had shears in both directions and @xmath414 .",
    "the following example , taken from @xcite , is a tiling space with shears in only one direction .",
    "it admits small cocycles , but the image of the ruelle - sullivan map is not dense .",
    "consider a 2-dimensional tiling with two tile types , @xmath291 and @xmath292 , both of which are unit squares .",
    "these form the basis of a fusion tiling with the rule @xmath415 , \\quad p_{n+1}(b ) = \\left [ \\begin{matrix } p_n(a ) & p_n(a ) & p_n ( a ) \\cr      p_n(a ) & p_n(a ) & p_n(a ) \\end{matrix } \\right ] .\\ ] ] as with the previous example , there is a horizontal shear .    restricting to a single row , the substitution @xmath416 ( or @xmath417 ) , @xmath418 has eigenvalues @xmath337 , both of which are bigger than 1 .",
    "the second eigenvalue controls the discrepancy in how many @xmath384-supertiles of type @xmath291 ( versus @xmath292 ) appear on either side of a horizontal boundary between @xmath31-supertiles , where @xmath419 .",
    "this discrepancy is unbounded , growing as @xmath420 , and the lengths of @xmath421 and @xmath422 are relatively prime , so @xmath384-supertiles meet with arbitrary offsets . taking a limit as @xmath423 proves",
    "that this tiling admits horizontal shears .",
    "also exactly as before , the horizontal part of a closed pe cochain @xmath103 has to be an integer multiple of length , plus something exact .",
    "this is because the first cohomology of the 1-dimensional tiling space with substitution @xmath424 , @xmath425 has no asymptotically negligible classes , insofar as the eigenvalues of @xmath426 are both larger than 1 .",
    "thus , if @xmath427 is in the image of the ruelle - sullivan map , @xmath289 must be an integer .",
    "however , @xmath428 can be arbitrarily small . for each @xmath31",
    ", we can construct a class that essentially counts @xmath31-supertiles in the vertical direction .",
    "this class can be represented by a 1-cochain @xmath103 that evaluates to 0 on all horizontal edges , to 1 on the vertical edges of the bottom row of each @xmath31-supertile , and to 0 on all other horizontal edges .",
    "since there are no vertical shears , these bottom rows can be identified in a strongly pe manner .",
    "the ruelle - sullivan map sends this class to @xmath429 .",
    "the corresponding subshift does not admit small , positive cocycles with respect to the obvious coordinates , since @xmath430 is not a positive vector on the first quadrant .",
    "however , if we rotate our axes by 45 degrees ( i.e. , restrict our @xmath3 action to combinations of @xmath431 and @xmath432 ) , we obtain a @xmath3 action that does admit small , positive cocycles .",
    "this implies the existence of small equivalence relations .",
    "however , those relations were already manifest from the hierarchical structure of the tiling ."
