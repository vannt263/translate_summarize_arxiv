    "the metals are important contributors to the opacity and consequently influence a variety of solar properties .",
    "traditionally the analysis of photospheric absorption lines was done with a 1d model that did not explicitly take into account surface stratification , velocities , and inhomogeneities @xcite .",
    "more recently 3d parameter - free methods have been introduced , improving the consistency of line analyses @xcite .",
    "this approach led to a significant reduction in z@xmath0 , from @xmath5 0.0169 to @xmath5 0.0122 , a change that makes the sun more consistent with similar stars in the local neighborhood . however the agreement between the ssm and various helioseismic properties , such as the sound speed profile and the location of the convective zone boundary , deteriorated with the reduced z@xmath0 ( see fig .",
    "the high - energy @xmath6b neutrino flux is also affected , with the high - metallicity gs98-sfii ssm flux being @xmath5 22% higher than low - metallicity agss09-sfii ssm flux @xcite .",
    "the solar abundance problem can be summarized as follows : there is a significant discrepancy between a ssm tuned to our best description of the solar surface ( a 3d treatment of photoabsorption lines ) and one tuned to reproduce properties of the solar interior ( helioseismic observables ) .",
    "the two models have very different z@xmath0s .",
    "this problem is potentially related to two others illustrated in fig .",
    "the first is the anomalous composition @xcite of the gaseous giant planets , jupiter , saturn , uranus , and neptune .",
    "jupiter and saturn are enriched in c and n by factors of 4 - 7 , relative to the sun .",
    "the process of planetary formation , which is thought to have occurred late in the evolution of the solar system when only @xmath5 5% of the nebular gas remained in a thin disk , appears to have scoured approximately 40 - 90 earth masses ( m@xmath7 ) of metal from the disk @xcite .",
    "the second comes from comparing the sun s composition with that of solar twins @xcite , where systematic differences in metal abundances track condensation temperatures , with the solar ratio of volatiles to refractories being 0.05 to 0.10 dex higher than the average twin ratio .",
    "these three problems could have a common origin , planetary disk processes that concentrate ice , dust , and other metal - rich material in the planets .",
    "if the depleted gas from which the metals were scrubbed were deposited onto the sun after the sun had developed its radiative core ( so that the convective envelope at the time resembled the modern one , which contains less than 3% of the sun s mass ) , then significant dilution of the convective zone could have occurred .",
    "this could produce a sun with a higher metallicity radiative core and lower metallicity convective surface , invalidating the ssm s assumption of zero - age homogeneity .",
    "( indeed , the excess metal in the planets is similar to the net difference in gs98-sfii and agss09-sfii ssm convective - zone metal , about 40 m@xmath7 . )",
    "there has been a significant amount of recent work focused on this conjecture .",
    "the nuclear physics connections include :    1 .",
    "neutrino flux measurements that are sensitive to changes in solar core temperature @xmath8 of 1% , and thus to metallicity differences comparable to those being debated .",
    "2 .   the development of accreting nonstandard solar models ( nssms ) , and the demonstration that such models are sharply constrained by solar neutrino and helioseismic measurements . 3 .",
    "the possibility that future solar neutrino flux measurements could provide a direct measurement of the c+n content of the solar core .    in the case of the neutrino fluxes ,",
    "the most sensitivity to @xmath8 is exhibited by the @xmath6b neutrinos . however , despite current measurements that determine this flux to @xmath5 3% and despite ssm model uncertainties of @xmath5 14% in this flux that exceed the nominal discrepancy of nearly 22% between the competing models @xcite , little can be concluded : the agss09-sfii and gs98-sfii ssm global fits to the solar neutrino data have identical @xmath9s .",
    "a metallicity intermediate between the two models would optimize the fit .",
    "the impact of accretion on both neutrino fluxes and helioseismic variables has been evaluated in nssms .",
    "the work to date @xcite varied the time , mass , and composition of the accreted material , but has not allowed the composition to vary in time ",

    "[ fig2:twins ] .",
    "the results are summarized in figs .",
    "10 and 11 of @xcite .",
    "helioseismic and neutrino observables tightly constrain such nssms . the envisioned candidate solution to the solar abundance problem  a low - z surface consistent with agss09 abundances and a high - z interior consistent with gs98 abundances  can be achieved with metal - free or metal - poor accretion and modest accreted masses m@xmath10m@xmath11 .",
    "such models can bring the surface helium abundance into agreement with the data and produce some improvement in the sound - speed figure - of - merit @xmath12 and in the comparison of model and measured neutrino fluxes .",
    "however the lower surface metallicity that accompanies such models forces the convective - zone boundary @xmath13 to move outward , contradicting results from helioseismology .",
    "the third point above  checking interior solar abundances by using solar neutrinos as a probe  is possible because of the cn neutrinos .",
    "while the sun produces 99% of its energy through the pp chain , proton burning also takes place through the cn i cycle , which produces significant fluxes of @xmath14n ( @xmath15/@xmath16/s ) and @xmath17o ( @xmath18/@xmath16/s ) neutrinos .",
    "these fluxes , like the @xmath6b neutrino flux , are very sensitive to @xmath8 , which can be changed by varying any of the approximately 19 ssm input parameters , according to their assigned uncertainties .",
    "these uncertainties include the abundances of key metals .",
    "but in addition to the response in @xmath8 due to changes in metallicity , the cn cycle has an additional linear dependence on the c+n abundance because these elements catalyze the proton burning .    in @xcite",
    "a strategy for using the neutrino flux to measure the core c+n content was developed in which a weighted ratio of @xmath17o and @xmath6b fluxes is formed that is nearly independent of @xmath8 , isolating this linear dependence on c+n .",
    "the result ( including recent improvements in the analysis ) is @xmath19^{0.729 } x_{\\mathrm{c+n } } \\left[1 \\pm 0.006(\\mathrm{ssm } ) \\pm 0.027(\\mathrm{d } ) \\pm 0.099(\\mathrm{nucl } ) \\pm 0.032 ( \\theta_{12 } ) \\right ] .",

    "but there is sensitivity to the 19th parameter , the diffusion coefficient d : eq .",
    "( [ eq : hs ] ) relates a contemporary neutrino flux measurement to the primordial c+n abundance .",
    "the composition of the modern sun s core is altered by the gravitational settling of c+n over 4.6 gyr , an effect that the ssm predicts is uncertain to 2.7% .",
    "the dominant uncertainty in eq . ( [ eq : hs ] ) of 9.9% comes from nuclear physics , particularly the s - factors for @xmath20be(p,@xmath21 ) and @xmath22n(p,@xmath21 ) .",
    "these s - factor uncertainties can be reduced @xcite : with a factor - of - two improvement , nuclear physics would no longer dominate the error analysis .",
    "finally there is a 3.2% uncertainty due to weak interaction parameters .",
    "on the left appears a flux that is currently not measured , but could be determined to a precision of about 7% in the upcoming solar neutrino experiment sno+ @xcite , a larger and significantly deeper version of borexino .",
    "the depth  the experiment is under construction in the former sno cavity at snolab  is important , potentially reducing backgrounds due to cosmogenic @xmath23c by a factor of @xmath5 70 , relative to borexino .",
    "when all errors are combined in quadrature , one finds that the solar core abundance of c+n could be determined to @xmath5 13% , which can be compared to the current debate over differences in z@xmath0 of @xmath24 30% .",
    "sno+ could allow , for the first time in stellar astrophysics , a direct experimental comparison between core and surface compositions , thereby testing the ssm assumption of initial homogeneity . if it were shown that planetary formation affects host - star surface metallicity in a characteristic way ",
    "e.g. , producing an elevated ratio of volatiles to refractories  this could be important in identifying stars that are more likely to host planets .",

    "dm particles could in principle scatter off any scalar , vector , or tensor static nuclear moment .",

    "the search for the site or sites of the r - process , the rapid - neutron - capture process thought to be responsible for synthesizing about half the heavy elements , has been a long and frustrating one .",
    "for the past two decades the leading candidate site @xcite has been the neutrino - driven wind that blows off the proto - neutron star surface in a core - collapse supernova . as the slightly neutron - rich",

    "it is unlikely that this mechanism can account for the r - process patterns we see in certain old , metal - poor halo stars ( left panel , fig .",
    "[ fig5:rprocess ] ) .",
    "few neutron - star mergers are expected at low metallicity because it takes time for the progenitor stars to evolve , as the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig5:rprocess ] shows .",
    "furthermore , because metal - poor stars sample the r - process locally at a time when the galaxy is chemically inhomogeneous , one can estimate the rate of r - process events in the early galaxy from the fluctuations in observed abundances .",
    "one finds @xmath5 @xmath92/y . while the uncertainty in this estimate is large , the rate is typical of core - collapse supernovae and much higher than would be expected for neutron star mergers , even today .",
    "studies of metal - poor stars have been the main source of new information on the r - process .",
    "the metals on the surfaces of such stars are thought to have arisen from a single , or perhaps a few , nearby r - process sites .",
    "the correspondence between the abundances in such stars and the scaled r - process distribution of our sun ( left panel , fig .",
    "[ fig5:rprocess ] ) suggests that the r - process distribution produced in a single event is similar to that averaged over many events .",
    "because of the difficulty of finding a robust r - process that naturally accounts for both the metal - poor - star data and integrated r - process yields , my collaborators and i recently explored another scenario :    * one r - process component that operates at early times , is associated with supernovae , and depends on the low - metallicity environments found in early massive stars . this early r - process would need to account for the metal - poor - star r - process abundance pattern and the observed local enrichments .",
    "it would need to operate until a metallicity of -2.5 to -2.0 , the time a more robust r - process would then take over .",
    "* the second process , unconstrained by the metal - poor star data but possibly responsible for the bulk of r - process synthesis , would then need to turn on in a manner consistent with r - process chemical evolution studies .",
    "neutron - star mergers would be the natural candidate for this second r - process .",
    "there is also a candidate mechanism for the first r - process , neutrons produced by neutrino reactions in the he shell of a type ii supernova @xcite .",
    "this mechanism was originally suggested as  the r - process , \" studied in high - metallicity stars , and found to fail there because the neutron / seed ratio was about a factor of 20 too low @xcite .",
    "this failure reflected both the relatively weak neutron source and the high abundance of neutron poisons such as @xmath22n in the he shells of the progenitor stars that were studied .",
    "the mechanism exploits the fact that neutrons scatter off he without capturing , and thus have an enhanced probability of capture on fe and other heavy seeds .",
    "we re - examined this r - process in the context of metal - poor stars , using a library of progenitors generated with the kepler code , and constructing more complete reaction networks .",
    "the details are given in @xcite .",
    "many of the conclusions of earlier studies were altered : the nuclear physics operated differently ( for example , neutral - current production of neutrons was found to be unimportant ) , and the effects of neutron poisons were found to be less severe .",
    "most important , the study included the effects of neutrino oscillations . with the assumption of an inverted hierarchy and a relatively hard heavy - flavor neutrino spectrum , neutron abundances of @xmath93/@xmath94were produced and maintained for long times in a variety of stars .",
    "right : the resulting number fractions @xmath95 at times of 7 , 10 , 15 , and 20 s , compared to the solar r - process pattern ( squares).,width=604 ]    the mechanism is unusual : it is a cold r - process , with equilibrium established by neutron capture @xmath96 @xmath97 decay , and with a path farther from the neutron - drip line than in hot r - processes like the @xmath98-driven wind .",
    "this has consequences for the abundance pattern and for the time - development of the r - process ( see fig .",
    "[ fig6:neutrino ] ) .",
    "the time scales are exceptionally long , with the third peak forming only after @xmath5 20 seconds .",
    "furthermore , synthesis continues after passage of the shock wave , augmented by the compression of the he shell and extending to times @xmath5 60 seconds ( not shown in the figure ) .",

    "it naturally accounts for some of the features seen in metal - poor stars , such as a highly variable yield in eu / fe .",
