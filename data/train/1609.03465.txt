    "recently , opinion dynamics has attracted much attention of researchers from various disciplines , such as applied mathematics , economics , social psychology , control theory , etc . , due to its broad applications in modeling and explaining complex phenomena in social and artificial networks",
    "@xcite-@xcite . in a social network ,",
    "agents form opinions on various political , economic and social issues according to the information they received from neighbors determined by the network topology @xcite-@xcite or the confidence / influence bound @xcite-@xcite .",
    "a fundamental question in opinion dynamics is : how do the network structure and opinions initial distribution influence the diffusion and aggregation of scattered opinions in the process of opinion formation ? in the work of degroot @xcite , a model is presented to characterize the process of a group of agents reaching opinion consensus on a common issue by pooling their subjective opinions , which is known as the degroot model .",
    "the interactions between agents are described by a stochastic matrix which can be regarded as the one - step transition probability matrix of a markov chain and some sufficient conditions for achieving opinion consensus are provided . to further investigate how the interpersonal influence contributes to the opinion formation , friedkin and johnsen @xcite extend the degroot model by introducing a diagonal matrix which represents agents susceptibilities to interpersonal influence . in the degroot model and the friedkin - johnsen ( f - j ) model ,",
    "interactions between agents are specified by given networks .",
    "different from these linear models , hegselmann and krause @xcite present a nonlinear model in which agents have bounded confidence for others . in the hegselmann - krause ( h - k ) model , two agents are said to be connected if and only if the difference between their opinions is smaller than a given confidence bound , this means that the network topology of the h - k model is state - dependent .",
    "as the research in multi - agent systems continues , the tools that are available within opinion dynamics have been enriched considerably .",
    "the degroot model is further investigated both on continuous - time dynamics and switched topologies @xcite-@xcite .",
    "in addition , many complex scenarios are also considered , including asynchronous consensus @xcite , time delays @xcite , finite - time consensus @xcite , leader - following framework @xcite , heterogeneous model @xcite and antagonistic interactions @xcite , to name but a few .",
    "based on the gossip algorithm @xcite , randomized opinion dynamics is investigated by acemoglu et al .",
    "@xcite , frasca et al .",
    "@xcite and li et al .",
    "@xcite , respectively .",
    "ghaderi et al .",
    "@xcite investigate the equilibrium and convergence rate of the f - j model . under the assumption that the adjacent matrix of the interpersonal influence network is an irreducible sub - stochastic matrix with the row sum of at least one row strictly smaller than one ,",
    "the authors transform the f - j model to a random walk , and the form of equilibrium is proposed based on the first hitting probabilities of the random walk .",
    "bindel et al .",
    "@xcite interpret the f - j model as a best - response game , and the ratio between the optimal solution and the nash equilibrium solution which is defined as the price of anarchy is discussed under both undirected and directed networks .",
    "most of the available literature on the f - j model focuses on opinion evolving over single issue .",
    "yet the f - j model does not in general converge to consensus over single issue due to the presence of stubborn agents .",
    "actually , the empirical evidence shows that consensus might be reached over a sequence of issues @xcite . in practice , associations of individuals ( such as small groups within firms , deliberative bodies of government , etc . )",
    "are usually constituted to deal with issues within particular issue domains , especially a sequence of related issues . in this scenario ,",
    "individuals opinions for successive issues are always related .",
    "thus , extending the existing theories of opinion dynamics to issue sequences is necessary and may uncover the underlying mechanism of opinion formation in the practice .",
    "bullo et al .",
    "@xcite , @xcite modify the f - j model and the degroot model to investigate the evolution of agents self - appraisals over an issue sequence , respectively .",
    "different from the works in @xcite and @xcite which focus on agents self - appraisal dynamics , in this paper we consider opinion consensus of the f - j model over a sequence of issues .",
    "firstly , convergence of the f - j model is studied over single issue .",
    "the existing results about convergence of the f - j model over single issue usually require that the interpersonal influence network is strongly connected or its adjacent matrix is irreducible @xcite , @xcite .",
    "we propose some milder sufficient and necessary conditions both in terms of network topology and its adjacent matrix to guarantee opinions of agents converge to constant values .",
    "several properties of agents ultimate opinions for single issue are also provided .",
    "secondly , different from the assumption of fixed initial opinions in @xcite , we assume that each agent forms its initial opinion for the next issue according to its ultimate opinion for the last issue .",
    "this assumption naturally follows from the fact that individuals opinions for successive connected issues are always interrelated .",
    "the connections between the interpersonal influence network and the network which characterizes the relationship of agents initial opinions for successive issues are established and the sufficient and necessary condition for the f - j model to achieve opinion consensus over issue sequences is proposed . finally , we consider the more general case in which each agent maintains a confidence bound in forming its initial opinion for each issue .",
    "connectivity preservation of the modified f - j model is analyzed .",
    "then we derive the conditions for achieving opinion consensus .",
    "the main difficulties for our analysis are twofold . on one hand ,",
    "the evolution of agents initial opinions over issue sequences is not directly determined by the interpersonal influence network and agents stubborn extent . on the other hand , due to the fact that the evolution of agents initial opinions over issue sequences is influenced by the evolution of their opinions over time sequences , connectivity preservation of",
    "the modified f - j model is more complex compared with connectivity preservation of the h - k model .",
    "as has been widely reported @xcite , @xcite , a social network with stubborn agents does not generally achieve consensus over single issue .",
    "our investigation shows that the f - j model can achieve opinion consensus over an issue sequence even if agents are stubborn to their initial opinions .",
    "moreover , the evolution of opinion over issue sequences enhances the connectivity of the social network . as long as one of the partially stubborn agent s opinion can scatter to all the rest partially stubborn agents through partially stubborn or non - stubborn agents",
    ", opinion consensus can be reached , and all the partially stubborn agents form a star subgraph in the network which characterizes the relationship of agents initial opinions for successive issues .",
    "the differences between opinion dynamics over issue sequences and single issue give us a deeper understanding of opinion formation in social networks .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in section [ s - preliminary ] ,",
    "we introduce some notions on graph theory and the f - j model . in section [ s - convergence ] , convergence of the f - j model is studied over single issue , and some properties of ultimate opinions are proposed . in section",
    "[ s - fjs ] , opinion consensus of the f - j model over issue sequences is investigated . in section [ s - fjh ] , we consider opinion consensus of the f - j model over issue sequences with bounded confidence . in section [ s - simulations ] , numerical simulations are given to illustrate the effectiveness of theoretical results . finally , some conclusions are drawn in section [ s - conclusion ] .",

    "in this section , some basic concepts on graph theory are introduced .",
    "then , a brief introduction of the f - j model is presented .      a weighted directed graph ( digraph ) @xmath19 of order @xmath0 is a triple @xmath20 which consists of a vertex set @xmath21 , an edge set @xmath22 and a weighted adjacency matrix @xmath23_{n\\times n}$ ] with entries @xmath24 .",

    "@xcite sheds light on the relationship between interpersonal influence and opinion change in social networks .",
    "the f - j model is a generalization of the degroot model @xcite .",
    "it introduces a positive diagonal matrix to quantify the extent of each member of the group open to the interpersonal influence .",
    "consider @xmath0 agents forming opinions on a certain issue in a network formulated by a weighted digraph @xmath20 .",
    "each agent holds an initial opinion @xmath38 .",
    "the classic f - j model is : @xmath39 where @xmath40 is a vector representing the stack of opinions with @xmath41 being the scale of time , @xmath42 is a stochastic weighted adjacency matrix characterizing the structure of the interpersonal influence network , @xmath43 is the diagonal matrix mentioned above with @xmath44 satisfying @xmath45 $ ] .",

    "note that if @xmath48 , the f - j model collapses to the degroot model .",
    "however , different from the degroot model in which disagreement is mainly the consequence of lack of communication , it is more likely the result of the presence of stubborn agents anchored to their own initial opinions in the f - j model .",
    "this is coincident with the empirical evidence that failing in reaching agreement usually owes to the stubbornness of individuals in practice , rather than the insufficiency of persistent contracts and interactions @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "a fundamental problem with respect to the f - j model is its limiting behavior when the time scale @xmath49 tends to infinity . in this subsection ,",
    "convergence of the f - j model is considered over single issue .",
    "different from the results in @xcite , @xcite and @xcite , we propose some milder conditions which ensure that @xmath50 converges to a constant vector as @xmath51 .",

    "<S> paper , opinion consensus in social networks with stubborn agents is considered over issue sequences . the social network with stubborn agents is described by the friedkin - johnsen ( f - j ) model where agents are stubborn to their initial opinions . </S>",
    "<S> firstly , we propose some sufficient and necessary conditions both in terms of network topology and system matrix for convergence of the f - j model over single issue . </S>",
    "<S> secondly , opinion consensus of the f - j model is investigated over issue sequences . </S>",
    "<S> our analysis establishes connections between the interpersonal influence network and the network describing the relationship of agents initial opinions for successive issues . taking advantage of these connections </S>",
    "<S> , we derive the sufficient and necessary condition for the f - j model to achieve opinion consensus over issue sequences . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we consider a more general scenario where each agent has bounded confidence in forming its initial opinion for every issue . by analyzing the evolution of agents ultimate opinions for each issue over issue sequences , we prove that the connectivity of the state - dependent network is preserved in this setting </S>",
