    "we start with the one - dimensional schrdinger equation for a particle of mass @xmath4 subject to potential @xmath5 @xmath6 where @xmath7 is a self - adjoint operator@xmath8 a solution to this equation can generally be presented as@xmath9 where @xmath10 is the propagator ( green s function ) for equation ( [ 0 ] ) in operator form and @xmath11 is its matrix element in @xmath12-representation .",
    "thus , the knowledge of the propagator provides the complete solution to the equation ( [ 0 ] ) at the given initial value @xmath13 .",
    "if the initial value is of the form @xmath14 , the solution ( [ 0b ] ) reduces to the green function matrix element @xmath15    equation ( [ 0 ] ) with an imaginary time variable is also relevant to other physical situations . if we make the substitutions @xmath16 ( @xmath17 ) and @xmath18 , eq .

    "if we make the substitutions @xmath2 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 , eq . ( [ 0 ] ) represents the inhomogeneous diffusion - like equation ( with the diffusion coefficient @xmath27 ) @xmath28 the solution to eq .",
    "( [ 0e ] ) at the initial condition @xmath29 is given by ( [ 0c])@xmath30 where @xmath7 is defined by ( [ 0a ] ) with @xmath24 .",
    "we see that , in any case , the problem is to find a propagator of the type @xmath31 with different @xmath32 for the considered parabolic differential equations .",
    "a rectangular potential is the simplest one allowing for the study of some striking quantum mechanical effects , such as particle reflection from a potential step / well and transmission through a potential barrier .",
    "these phenomena are less surprising when we think of a wave being , e.g. , reflected from a downward potential step , though they are more surprising from the particle point of view .",
    "they easily follow from the standard textbook stationary analysis , which reduces to substituting a plane wave of energy @xmath33 for the wave packet and solving the stationary schrdinger equation .",
    "however , in this case , there are no real transport phenomena , i.e. in the absence of the energy dispersion ( @xmath34 ) the transmission time through or the time of arrival ( toa ) to the potential jumps is indefinite ( @xmath35 ) .",
    "it is interesting to verify the mentioned non - classical phenomena by considering the time - dependent picture of these processes in a realistic situation , when a particle , originally localized outside the potential well / barrier , moves towards the potential and experiences scattering at the potential jumps . in order to do this",
    ", the corresponding time - dependent schrdinger equation needs to be solved .",
    "this problem is much more involved even in the one - dimensional case in comparison to the conventional stationary case .    in particular",
    ", there is one striking and classically forbidden counterintuitive ( and often overlooked ) effect even in the process of the simplest 1d time - dependent scattering by the mentioned potentials .",
    "a wave packet representing an ensemble of particles , confined initially ( at @xmath36 ) , say , somewhere to the region @xmath37 , consists of both positive and negative momentum components due to the fact that a particle can not be completely localized at @xmath37 if the wave packet contains only @xmath38 components .",
    "one would then expect that only particles with positive momenta @xmath39 may arrive at positive positions @xmath40 at @xmath41 . however , the wave packet s negative momentum components ( restricted to a half line in momentum space ) are necessarily different from zero in the whole @xmath12 space ( @xmath42 ) , representing the particles presence at @xmath40 at initial moment of time @xmath43 , and , therefore , may contribute , for example , to the distribution of the particles time of arrival ( toa ) to @xmath40 @xcite .",
    "it is worth noting that the contribution of the backward - moving ( negative momentum ) components in the initial - value problem is in some sense equivalent to the contribution of the negative energy ( evanescent ) components in the source solution @xcite .",
    "thus , the correct treatment of some aspects of the kinetics of the wave packet ( even in the 1d case and even for a `` free '' motion ) becomes a nontrivial problem and is closely related to the fundamental problem of measuring time in quantum mechanics , such as toa , the dwell time , and tunneling time .",
    "in addition , the time - dependent aspects of reflection from and transmission through the potential step / barrier / well have recently acquired relevance not only in view of renewed interest in the fundamental problems of measuring time in quantum mechanics ( see @xcite ) , but also due to important practical applications in the newly emerged fields of nanoscience and nanotechnology .",
    "rectangular ( asymmetric spin - dependent ) potential barriers / wells may often satisfactorily approximate the one - dimensional potential profiles in layered magnetic nanostructures ( with sharp interfaces ) .",
    "in such nanostructures , the giant magnetoresistance ( gmr ) @xcite and tunneling magnetoresistance ( tmr ) @xcite effects occur .",
    "the calculation of the propagator @xmath31 is conveniently related to the path - integral method ( see , e.g. @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "the list of the exact solutions for this propagator is very short .",
    "for example , there is an exact solution for the spacetime propagator @xmath44 of the schrdinger equation in the one - dimensional square barrier case obtained in @xcite , but this solution is very complicated , implicit and not easy to analyze ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "recently , we have suggested a simple method for the calculation of the spacetime propagator @xcite , which exactly resolves the time - dependent schrdinger equation with a rectangular potential in terms of integrals of elementary functions .",
    "this method is an alternative to the commonly used path - integral approach to the mentioned problems and based on the energy integration of the spectral density matrix ( discontinuity of the energy - dependent green function across the real energy axis ) .",
    "the energy - dependent green function is then easily obtained for the step / barrier / well potentials with multiple - scattering theory ( mst ) using the effective energy - dependent potentials found in @xcite , which are responsible for reflection from and transmission through the potential step .",
    "these potentials , which are defined via the different particle velocities from both sides of the potential steps making up the step / barrier / well potentials , allow for the consideration of the reflection and transmission processes as particle scattering at the potential jumps in contrast to the conventional wave - like picture .",
    "an important advantage of our approach is that the negative energy ( evanescent states ) contribution to the propagator cancels out due to the natural decomposition of the propagator into forward- and backward - moving components .",
    "this is an essential result because accounting for both of these components ( which should generally be done ) often leads to a rather complicated consideration of the evanescent states with @xmath45 ( see @xcite ) .    in this paper",
    ", we provide an exact solution to eq .",
    "( [ 0 ] ) for real and imaginary times using our approach @xcite to the calculation of the spacetime propagator for a general asymmetric rectangular potential . in sec .",
    "2 , we outline our mst  approach to the calculation of the propagator for the time - dependent schrdinger equation and present its explicit form . in sec . 3",
    ", we consider a system in a heat bath , as is the case , e.g. , for electrons in nanostructures .",
    "the equilibrium system s characteristics can then be calculated knowing its density matrix @xmath19 .",
    "we present in this section an exact solution for the density matrix of a particle in an asymmetric ( spin - dependent ) one - dimensional rectangular potential and discuss its properties with the help of numerical evaluation of the corresponding integrals of elementary functions . in accordance with the above discussion of eq .",

    "note , that in this case one would not need rely on the standard ( often cumbersome ) matching procedure characteristic of the picture when a wave ( representing a particle ) is reflected from and transmitted through the potential ( [ 1 ] ) . on the other hand",
    ", the introduction of the scattering potential @xmath76 corresponds to the natural picture of the particle scattering at the potential jumps at @xmath77 and @xmath58 .",
    "we showed in @xcite that the hamiltonian corresponding to the energy - conserving processes of scattering at potential steps can be presented as @xmath78 here , @xmath79 describes the perturbation of the `` free '' particle motion ( defined by @xmath80 ) localized at the potential steps with coordinates @xmath81 ( in the case of the potential ( [ 1 ] ) , there are two potential steps at @xmath82 and @xmath83)@xmath84,\\nonumber\\\\ h_{i<}(e ) &   = \\frac{i\\hbar}{2}[v_{<}^{s}(e)-v_{>}^{s}(e)],\\nonumber\\\\ h_{i><}(e ) &   = \\frac{2i\\hbar v_{>}^{s}(e)v_{<}^{s}(e)}{[\\sqrt{v_{>}^{s}(e)}+\\sqrt{v_{<}^{s}(e)}]^{2}},\\label{8}\\ ] ] where @xmath85 is the reflection ( from the potential step at @xmath86 ) potential amplitude , the index @xmath87 indicates the side on which the particle approaches the interface at @xmath86 : right ( @xmath59 ) or left ( @xmath60 ) ; @xmath88 is the transmission potential amplitude , and the velocities @xmath89 ( @xmath90 are given by ( [ 2 ] ) ) .",

    "further application of these results to the calculation of the toa and dwell time as well as of the probability density of finding a particle in different spatial areas as a function of time with account of the forward- and backward - moving components of the wave function and their interference can be found in our earlier papers @xcite .",

    "we have obtained the exact propagator @xmath31 ( @xmath7 is the hamiltonian for a particle moving in the presence of the asymmetric rectangular potential ) resolving the parabolic - type partial differential equation .",
    "having obtained the spacetime propagator for the one - dimensional time - dependent schrdinger equation ( @xmath231 ) with a rectangular well / barrier potential , we at the same time succeeded in finding a propagator for the bloch equation ( @xmath232 , @xmath233 ) for the particle density matrix and for the diffusion - like equation ( @xmath234 ) by shifting from real to imaginary time ( @xmath16 and @xmath2 , correspondingly ) .",
    "as an alternative to the conventional path integral approach to calculating the propagators , we use the multiple - scattering theory for the calculation of the energy - dependent green function ( a resolvent operator in ( [ 3b ] ) ) .",
    "the suggested approach is based on the possibility of introducing the effective potentials ( see ( [ 7 ] ) and ( [ 8 ] ) ) which are responsible for reflection from and transmission through the potential jumps making up the rectangular potential ( [ 1 ] ) .",

    "the solution for the time - dependent schrdinger equation describes the reflection from and transmission through the asymmetric rectangular potential as a function of time and thus allows for considering the non - classical counter - intuitive effects of particle reflection from a potential well and transmission through a potential barrier in a real situation when a particle is moving towards the potential ( [ 1 ] ) and then experiencing a scattering at the potential .",
    "these results are also relevant to the fundamental issues of measuring time in quantum mechanics such as the time - of - arrival ( toa ) , dwell time and tunneling time .",
    "the obtained density matrix @xmath158 for a particle in a heat bath and under the influence of the potential ( [ 1 ] ) gives the probability density ( diagonal matrix element ) to find a particle in some spatial point and the quantum correlations ( coherences ) of different spatial states @xmath165 and @xmath166 provided by the nondiagonal matrix elements .",
    "the results for the density matrix are numerically visualized , which is enabled by the fact that they are expressed in terms of integrals of elementary functions .",
    "the results of the solution of the diffusion - like equation , which can be interpreted ( for the case of a potential barrier , @xmath137 ) as a diffusion with the negative sources distributed according to potential ( [ 1 ] ) , also have been numerically evaluated .",
    "the corresponding figures demonstrate the difference between this `` diffusion with the holes '' and `` free '' diffusion in the absence of the potential ( [ 1 ] ) .",
    "it is also worth mentioning that all obtained results are also relevant to the properties of electrons in nanostructures important for spintronics devices because the potential ( [ 1 ] ) can be used for modeling potential profiles in such materials ."
