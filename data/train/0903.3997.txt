    "in the last few years , complex networks have attracted a growing interest from a wide circle of researchers  @xcite .",
    "the reason for this boom is that complex networks describe various systems in nature and society , such as the world wide web ( www ) , the internet , collaboration networks , and sexual network , and so on .",
    "extensive empirical studies have revealed that real - life systems have in common at least two striking statistical properties : power - law degree distribution  @xcite , small - world effect  @xcite including small average path length ( apl ) and high clustering coefficient . in order to mimic real - word systems with above mentioned common characteristics , a wide variety of models have been proposed  @xcite . at present , it is still an active direction to construct models reproducing the structure and statistical characteristics of real systems .    in our previous papers , on the basis of the well - known sierpinski fractal ( or sierpinski gasket ) , we have proposed a deterministic network called deterministic sierpinski network ( dsn )  @xcite , and a stochastic network named random sierpinski network ( rsn )  @xcite , respectively .",
    "both the dsn and rsn possess good topological properties observed in some real systems . in this paper",
    ", we suggest a general scenario for constructing evolutionary sierpinski networks ( esns ) controlled by a parameter @xmath0 .",
    "the esns can also result from sierpinski gasket and unify the dsn and rsn to the same framework , i.e. , the dsn and rsn are special cases of rsns .",
    "the esns have a power - law degree distribution , a very large clustering coefficient , and a small intervertex separation .",
    "the degree exponent of esns is changeable between @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "moreover , we introduce a generating algorithm for the esns which can realize the construction of our networks . in the end , the cooperation behavior of the evolutionary prisoner s dilemma game on two limiting cases ( i.e. , dsn and rsn ) of the esns is discussed .",

    "we first introduce sierpinski gasket , which is also known as sierpinski triangle .",
    "the classical sierpinski gasket denoted as @xmath3 after @xmath4 generations , is constructed as follows  @xcite : start with an equilateral triangle , and denote this initial configuration as @xmath5 .",
    "perform a bisection of the sides forming four small copies of the original triangle , and remove the interior triangles to get @xmath6 .",

    "the proposed unified model is derived from this esg : nodes represent the sides of the removed triangles and edges correspond to contact relationship . as in the construction of the deterministic and random sierpinski networks  @xcite ,",
    "the three sides of the initial equilateral triangle ( at step 0 ) of the esg are also mapped to three different nodes .    in the construction process of the esg , for each equilateral triangle at arbitrary generation , once we perform a bisection of its sides and remove the central down pointing triangle , three copies of it are formed . when building the unifying network model , it is equivalent that for each group of three newly - added nodes , three new triangles are generated , which may create new nodes in the subsequent generations . according to this , we can introduce an iterative algorithm to create the esns . using the proposed algorithm",
    "one can write a computer program conveniently to simulate the networks and study their properties .",

    "after simple calculations , one can obtain that at step @xmath27 @xmath28 the number of newly - born nodes and edges is @xmath29 and @xmath30 , respectively .",
    "thus the average number of total nodes @xmath31 and edges @xmath32 present at step @xmath4 is @xmath33 and @xmath34 respectively .",
    "so for large @xmath4 , the average degree @xmath35 is approximately @xmath36 .",
    "obviously , we have @xmath37 . moreover , according to the connection rule , arbitrary two edges in the esns never cross each other .",
    "thus , the class of networks under consideration are maximal planar networks ( or graphs )  @xcite .",
    "in the following we will study the topology properties of @xmath11 , in terms of degree distribution , clustering coefficient , and average path length .",

    "for a degree @xmath52 , there are @xmath53 nodes with this exact degree , all of which were born at step @xmath54 .",
    "all nodes born at time @xmath54 or earlier have this or a higher degree .",

    "i.e. , @xmath8 and @xmath65 ( but @xmath66 ) , the evolutionary sierpinski networks reduce to the deterministic sierpinski network  @xcite and its stochastic variant  @xcite , respectively .",
    "figure [ cumulatedegree ] shows , on a logarithmic scale , the scaling behavior of the cumulative degree distribution @xmath67 for different values of @xmath0 .",
    "numerical simulation agrees well with the analytical result .",
    "( color online ) the cumulative degree distribution @xmath67 at various @xmath0 values .",

    "the clustering coefficient of the whole network is the average of @xmath79s over all nodes in the network .    for the esns ,",
    "the analytical expression of clustering coefficient @xmath80 for a single node with degree @xmath81 can be derived exactly .",

    ", one knows that the existing model shows both the scale - free nature and the high clustering at the same time .",
    "in fact , our model also possesses small - world property .",
    "next , we will show that our networks have at most a logarithmic average path length ( apl ) with the number of nodes , where apl means the minimum number of edges connecting a pair of nodes , averaged over all couples of nodes .    using a mean - field approach similar to that presented in refs .",
    "@xcite , one can predict the apl of our networks analytically . by construction",
    ", at each time step , the number of newly - created nodes is different . in order to distinguish different nodes ,",
    "we construct a node sequence in the following way : when @xmath93 nodes are added at a given time step , we label them as @xmath94 , where @xmath95 is the total number of the pre - existing nodes .",
    "eventually , every node is labeled by a unique integer , and the total number of nodes is @xmath96 at time @xmath4 .",
    "we denote @xmath97 as the apl of the esns with order @xmath98 .",
    "it follows that @xmath99 , where @xmath100 is the total distance , and where @xmath101 is the smallest distance between node @xmath38 and node @xmath102 .",
    "note that the distances between existing node pairs are not affected by the addition of new nodes .",
    "as in the analysis of  @xcite , we can easily derive that @xmath103 in the infinite limit of @xmath98 .",
    "then , @xmath104 .",
    "thus , there is a slow growth of the apl with the network order @xmath98 .",
    "this logarithmic scaling of @xmath97 with network order @xmath98 , together with the large clustering coefficient obtained in the preceding subsection , shows that the considered graphs have a small - world effect .    in particular , in the case of @xmath8",
    ", we can exactly compute the average path length .",
    "a previously reported analytical result has shown that the apl for this special case grows logarithmically with the order of the network  @xcite . in fig .",

    "semilogarithmic graph of the apl versus the network order @xmath98 . ]",
    "the ultimate goal of study of network structure is to study and understand the workings of systems built upon those networks  @xcite . recently ,",
    "some researchers have focused on the analysis of functional or dynamical aspects of processes occurring on networks .",
    "one particular issue attracting much attention is using evolutionary game theory to analyze the evolution of cooperation on different types of networks  @xcite .",
    "cooperation is ubiquitous in the real - life systems , ranging from biological systems to economic and social systems  @xcite .",
    "understanding the emergence and survival of cooperative behavior in these systems has become a fundamental and central issue .    after studying the relevant characteristics of network structure , which is described in the previous section , we will study the evolutionary game behavior on the networks , with focus on the game of prisoner s dilemma ( pd ) . in the simple , one - shot pd game , both receive @xmath105 under mutual cooperation and @xmath106 under mutual defection , while a defector exploiting a cooperator gets amount @xmath107 and the exploited cooperator receives @xmath108 , such that @xmath109 . as a result , it is better to defect regardless of the opponent s decision , which in turns makes cooperators unable to resist invasion by defectors , and the defection is the only evolutionary stable strategy in fully mixed populations .",
    "we now investigate the evolutionary pd game on our networks to reveal the influences of topological properties on cooperation behavior .",
    "here we only study two limiting cases : @xmath110 and @xmath111 ( but @xmath112 ) . as usual in the studies  @xcite , we choose the payoffs as @xmath113 , @xmath114 , and @xmath115 , and implement the finite population analogue of replicator dynamics . during each generation , each individual @xmath38 plays the single given game with all its neighbors , and their accumulated payoff being stored in @xmath116 .",
    "after each round of the game , the individual @xmath38 is allowed to update its strategy by selecting at random a neighbor among all its neighbors , @xmath102 , and comparing their respective payoffs @xmath116 and @xmath117 .",
    "if @xmath118 , the individual @xmath38 will keep the same strategy for the next generation . on the contrary , the individual @xmath38 will adopt the strategy of its neighbor @xmath102 with a probability dependent on the payoff difference ( @xmath119 ) as @xmath120 .",
    "all individuals update its strategies synchronously during the evolution process .",
    "frequency of cooperators as a function of the temptation to defect @xmath121 . ]    in fig .",
    "[ game ] , we report the simulated results ( i.e. the dependence of the equilibrium frequency of cooperators on the temptation to defect @xmath121 ) for both dsn and rsn .",
    "simulations are performed for both networks with order @xmath122 .",
    "each data point is obtained by averaging over 100 simulations for each of ten different network realizations . from fig .",
    "[ game ] , one can see that for @xmath123 the cooperators in the deterministic sierpinski network is dominant over defectors . and similar phenomenon",
    "is also observed for its corresponding random version .",
    "thus , both of the network structures are in favor of cooperation upon defection for a wide range of @xmath121 .",
    "figure  [ game ] also shows that in both networks the frequency of cooperators makes a steady decrease when the temptation changes from @xmath124 to @xmath125 , and then drops dramatically when the temptation increases to @xmath1 . on the other hand , for large @xmath121 ( such as @xmath126 ) , the equilibrium frequency of dsn is higher than that in rsn , and this phenomenon is more obvious when the temptation is larger and goes up to @xmath1 .    the observed phenomena in fig .",
    "[ game ] can be explained according to the underlying network structures . since both dsn and rsn are scale - free networks , this heterogeneous network architecture makes cooperation become the dominating trait over a wide range of temptation to defect @xmath121  @xcite .",
    "although both networks have scale - free property , dsn is more heterogeneous than rsn since the former has a smaller exponent of power - law degree distribution than the latter ; at the same time , the average clustering coefficient of dsn is larger than that of rsn .",
    "these two different characteristics between dsn and rsn can account for the dissimilar cooperation behavior in both networks  @xcite : a higher value of average clustering coefficient , together with a smaller exponent of power - law degree distribution , produces an overall improvement of cooperation in dsn , even for a very large temptation to defect , which is compared to that in rsn .",
    "in summary , on the basis of sierpinski gasket , we have proposed and studied one kind of evolving network : evolutionary sierpinski networks ( esns ) . according to the network construction process",
    "we have presented an algorithm to generate the networks , based on which we have obtained the analytical and numerical results for degree distribution , clustering coefficient , as well as average path length , which agree well with a large amount of real observations .",
    "the degree exponent can be adjusted continuously between @xmath64 and 3 , and the clustering coefficient is very large .",
    "moreover , we have studied the evolutionary pd game on two limiting cases of the esn .",
    "it should be stressed that the network representation introduced here is convenient for studying the complexity of some real systems and may have wider applicability .",
    "for instance , a similar recipe has been recently adopted for investigating the navigational complexity of cities  @xcite ; on the other hand , it is frequently used in rna folding research  @xcite ; moreover , earlier links associating this network representation with polymers have proven useful to the study of polymer physics  @xcite .",
    "thus , our study provides a paradigm of representation for the complexity of many real - life systems , making it possible to study the complexity of these systems within the framework of network theory .",
    "because of its three important properties : power - law degree distribution , small intervertex separation , and large clustering coefficient , the proposed networks possess good structural features in accordance with a variety of real - life networks .",
    "additionally , our networks are maximal planar graphs , which may be helpful for designing printed circuits  @xcite .",
    "finally , it should be mentioned that although our model can reproduce a few topological characteristics of real - life systems , it remains unknown whether the model can capture a true underlying mechanism responsible for those properties observed in real networks .",
    "this belongs to the issue of model evaluation , which is beyond the scope of the present paper but deserves further study in future  @xcite .",
