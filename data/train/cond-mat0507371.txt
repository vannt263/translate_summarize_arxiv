    "a simple theoretical model giving an insight into this phenomenon is the asakura - oosawa - vrij ( aov ) model of colloid - polymer mixtures in which the polymers ( modeled as spheres ) are ideal and can overlap freely , but the polymer - colloid and colloid - colloid interactions are of the hard sphere type @xcite .",
    "effective attractive interactions in such systems arise due to a tendency to decrease the volume excluded to the polymer coils @xcite .    the aov model has attracted much attention due to its simplicity @xcite , however when comparing to experiments the agreement is only qualitative .",

    "the colloid profile ( cf .",
    "[ fig:4]b , dashed line ) also exhibits oscillations but the structure is much more pronounced and the profile exhibits a sharp and high first peak with a large contact value .",

    "as in simple fluids the prewetting line tangentially meets the binodal in the wetting transition point ( marked by the filled circle ) and ends at the surface critical point ( marked by the triangle ) . in the polymer segment mole fraction - total density representation",
    "the prewetting line is located very close to the binodal and the surface critical point is well removed from the bulk critical point ( marked by the open circle ) . however , when the colloid - polymer packing fraction ( cf .",
    "the inset to fig .",
    "[ fig:5 ] ) or the polymer segment mole fraction - pressure representation is chosen ( cf .",
    "the inset to fig .",
    "[ fig:6 ] ) , the prewetting line is more distant from the binodal .",
    "we note that for all chain lengths considered the surface critical point pressure is lower than the pressure of the bulk demixing transition .",

    "however in the present paper we do not find the lower wetting points and , despite considerable effort , we do not find any hints for the layering transitions in the partial wetting regime .",
    "a likely explanation to the last observation is that forsman and woodward @xcite considered a mixture of polymers and solvent molecules with diameter ratio @xmath56 .",
    "consequently , the individual polymer segments were effectively attracted to the wall due to the depletion forces induced by the overlap of the excluded volumes of the polymer segments and the wall . in the present study this effect does not come into play .",

    ", width=302 ]    in a recent study of wettability of solid surfaces by short - chain fluids @xcite it was suggested that the wetting temperature for a given surface , when divided by the critical temperature , is almost independent on @xmath4 for longer chains .",
    "although in the athermal systems considered in the present paper the temperature does not have any significant role ( is a simple scaling parameter ) , other parameters like the reciprocal pressure play the role similar to the temperature in thermal systems . therefore the wetting point pressure rescaled by the critical pressure @xmath57 should barely depend on the chain length .",
    "the estimated wetting point pressure @xmath58 for systems @xmath36 , 100 , 120 , and 200 is 9.75 , 7.76 , 6.51 , and 4.25 , respectively .",
    "the corresponding @xmath59 thus are 0.814 , 0.818 , 0.824 , and 0.835 .",
    "this agrees nicely with the prediction @xcite .",
    "that the rescaled @xmath59 barely depends on @xmath4 has a simple explanation . as demonstrated in refs .",
    "@xcite , in the limit of an infinite chain length @xmath60 , and for fixed @xmath61 , the bulk critical pressure ( and also the colloid critical packing fraction ) tend to a finite , nonzero value with the leading order correction @xmath62 .",
    "this is the so - called `` protein limit '' of colloid - polymer mixtures @xcite .",
    "but then the wetting point pressure also should tend to a constant in that limit .",
    "therefore the rescaled wetting point pressure should barely depend on m for longer chains .",
    "we also note that the systematic deviations of @xmath59 from a constant suggest that the leading order chain - length dependent correction to @xmath63 is of different order than that for the bulk critical point .",
    "however the precise form of these corrections is rather difficult to estimate and we leave this problem for future work .",
    "wetting in the aov model for @xmath41 can be readily explained by invoking depletion interactions .",
    "the overlap of excluded volumes of a colloid and a wall is larger than the overlap between two colloidal particles and this gives rise to net colloid - wall attraction .",
    "consequently the colloid - rich phase favors the hard wall .",
    "our results are in opposition to the aov model results and show some features that are characteristic of wetting in athermal polymer solutions .",
    "the suggestion that the polymer - rich phase should wet the hard wall seems reasonable when @xmath42 .",
    "however , we find this behavior also for @xmath41 i.e. for @xmath7 , @xmath36 ( in order to be completely assured that our calculations are representative of the tpt1 description and are not a result of e.g. an artifact connected with the incorrect scaling of the polymer gyration radius , we checked that even for colloid - to - polymer - segment size ratios as large as @xmath64 and for chains as short as @xmath65 the polymer - rich phase wets completely the hard wall ) .",
    "this is at variance with experimental results .",
    "we connect this discrepancy with the inaccurate description of the bulk phase behavior resulting from the tpt1 theory , and identify two possible sources of errors .",
    "the first issue is connected with the incorrect scaling of the gyration radius and of the polymer second virial coefficient with @xmath4 .",
    "the consequence is that the dilute and semidilute regimes of long chains are not described accurately .",
    "this problem has already been recognized in the literature .",
    "proposed a simple correction that significantly improves the accuracy of the tpt1 description in the low density limit @xcite .",
    "a similar treatment , which combines the field - theoretic approach with liquid - state theory , was proposed by lue @xcite . however ,",
    "at present it is not clear how these ideas can be extended to mixtures . to explain the second deficiency in the tpt1 description of colloid - polymer mixtures we recall that the wertheim approach , as any other perturbation theory , relies on the good description of the reference system . in this case",
    "it is a mixture of big and small hard spheres and we used the usual boublik - mansoori - carnahan - starling - leland ( bmcsl ) equation of state @xcite .",
    "however , it was argued @xcite that for highly asymmetric hard sphere mixtures a fluid - fluid phase separation occurs , which is metastable to a broad fluid - solid phase transition .",
    "consequently the bmcsl equation of state is not very accurate .",
    "the reference system in the tpt1 approach to colloid - polymer mixtures consists of a very low packing fraction of small spheres , therefore the potential impact of this problem seems to be moderate .",
    "we have used a microscopic density functional theory based on wertheim s first order thermodynamic perturbation theory to study the wetting behavior of athermal mixtures of colloids and excluded - volume polymers . in opposition to the wetting behavior in the aov model",
