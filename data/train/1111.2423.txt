    "the quantumness of the correlation contained in a bipartite quantum state olliver and zurek [ 3 ] proposed a measure for quantum correlation known as quantum discord ( qd ) and based on a distinction between quantum information theory and classical information theory .",
    "a recent result that almost all quantum states have a nonvanishing qd [ 6 ] shows up the relavance of studying such correlation .",
    "+ besides the quantification of quantum correlations , another important problem is the behavior of these correlations under the action of decoherence .",
    "the phenomenon , caused by the injection of noise into the system and arising from its inevitable interaction with the surrounding environment , is responsible for the loss of quantum coherence initially present in the system .",
    "recently it was noted that the dynamical behaviors of qd in the presence of the markovian [ 7,8 ] decoherence decay exponentially in time and vanish only asymptotically [ 9,10 ] , contrary to the entanglement dynamics where sudden death may occur [ 11 - 18 ] . in these above studies , the quantumness of correlation is more robust to the action of the environment than the entanglement itself . in particular , refs .",
    "[ 19,20 ] have discovered that the qd can be completely unaffected by markovian depolarizing channels or non - markovian depolarizing channels for long intervals of time , and this phenomenon has been observed experimentally [ 21 ] . as refs . [ 19 - 21 ] , it is of interest to find a certain environmental model that the quantum correlation can be unaffected by decoherence as much as possible .",
    "+ in this article , we will concentrate on the question : what kind of local environmental model can make the initial quantum correlation more robust in the dynamics process ?",
    "we consider a noninteracting two - qubit system under the influence of two independent environments .",
    "the most common environmental models ( the single - lorentzian model , the squared - lorentzian model , the two - lorentzian model and band - gap model ) are studied . by analytical and numerical analysis",
    "we find that , for the weak coupling regime , the monotonous decay speed of the two - qubit qd is mainly determined by the spectral density functions of these different environments .",
    "the two - qubit qd in the single - lorentzian ( band - gap ) environment is more robust than in the squared - lorentzian ( two - lorentzian ) environment under the resonant and near resonant conditions . while for the far off - resonant condition the two - qubit qd in the single - lorentzian ( band - gap ) environment decreases much more faster than in the squared - lorentzian ( two - lorentzian ) environment .",
    "however , by considering the strong coupling regime we find that , the two - qubit qd is more robust in the squared - lorentzian ( two - lorentzian ) environment than in the single - lorentzian ( band - gap ) environment , either under the near resonant or far off - resonant condition . in this case , the dynamics of qd mainly depends on the non - markovianity of the environmental models , and is independent of the environmental spectrum density functions .",
    "considering a model consisting of two qubits @xmath0 and @xmath1 , each interacting with a zero - temperature bosonic environment , denoted @xmath2 and @xmath3 , respectively , we assume that each qubit - environment system is isolated and the environments are initially in the vacuum state while two qubits are initially in an quantum correlated state .",
    "a specific system which consists of two independent two - level atoms interacting with an multi - mode environment respectively has been chosen in this paper .",
    "since each atom evolves independently , we can learn how to characterize the evolution of the overall system from the atom - environment dynamics .",
    "the interaction between an atom and an n - mode environment in the rotating - wave approximation is given by @xmath4 , which , in the basis @xmath5 , reads @xmath6 here @xmath7 , @xmath8 are the creation and annihilation operators of quanta of the environment ( @xmath2 or @xmath3 ) , @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the inversion operators and transition frequency of the @xmath12-th atom ( j=@xmath0 , @xmath1 and here @xmath13 ) ; @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the frequency of the mode @xmath16 of the environment and its coupling strength with the atom .",
    "to illustrate the roles of the different environmental models on quantum correlation dynamics of two atoms , we assume that two atoms interact off - resonantly with their structured environment , whose spectral density function @xmath17 provides a complete characterization of the evolution for single - lorentzian , two - lorentzian , band - gap and squared - lorentzian environments . + in order to find the atom - environment dynamics , we solve the master equation by using the pseudomode approach [ 22,23 ] .",
    "this exact master equation describes the coherent interaction between the atom and the pseudomodes in the presence of the decay of the pseudomodes due to the interaction with a markovian reservoir [ 24 ] .",
    "the number of the pseudomodes relies on the shape of the environmemt spectral density function .",
    "@xmath18 for the single - lorentzian environmental model @xmath19 , there has only one pole in the lower half complex plane , the atom interacts with one pseudomode which leaks into a markovian environment .",
    "so the exact dynamics of the atom interacting with a single - lorentzian structured environment is contained in the following pseudomode master equation @xmath20-\\frac{\\gamma}{2}[a^{\\dag}a\\rho-2a{\\rho}a^{\\dag}+{\\rho}a^{\\dag}a],\\label{02}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath21 with @xmath22 is the density operator for the @xmath12-th atom and the pseudomode of the structured reservoir , @xmath2 and @xmath23 are the annihilation and creation operators of the pseudomode .",
    "the constants @xmath24 and @xmath25 are , respectively , the oscillation frequency and the decay rate of the pseudomode and they depend on the position of the pole @xmath26 .",
    "the @xmath12-th atom interacts coherently with the pseudomode ( the strength of the coupling @xmath27 ) .",
    "+ @xmath28 according to the two - lorentzian environmental model , the environment spectral density function is simply a sum of two lorentzian functions @xmath29 , where the weights of the two lorentzians are such that @xmath30 .",

    "different from the band - gap model , only the first pseudomode will show any decay to the markovian environment with decay rate @xmath25 , the second pseudomode which is directly coupled to the @xmath12-th atom does not decay in this model . so the dynamics of the @xmath12-th atom and two pseudomodes obey the following master equation @xmath20-\\gamma[a^{\\dag}_{1}a_{1}\\rho-2a_{1}{\\rho}a^{\\dag}_{1}+{\\rho}a^{\\dag}_{1}a_{1}],\\label{08}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with the hamiltonian @xmath52 in order to analyze the roles of the different environmental models on quantum correlation dynamics of two atoms , we consider the above four environmental models , respectively , @xmath53 the single - lorentzian model , two - lorentzian model , band - gap model and squared - lorentzian model . according to the above analysis ,",

    "so in this paper we will mainly compare the difference in quantum correlation dynamics of two atoms between the single - lorentzian model and squared - lorentzian model , as well as bewteen the two - lorentzian model and band - gap model . for an initial state of the total system @xmath56 , with @xmath57 , and here @xmath58 $ ] , @xmath59 and @xmath60 are the excited state and ground state of atoms , @xmath61 is the vacuum state of the environment @xmath62 .",

    "however , according to the previous works [ 26 - 28 ] , we know that there exists the non - markovianity of environment in the strong coupling regime , and the non - markovian effect of environment can play an important role on the dynamics of the qubits system .",

    "@xmath96 : the atomic qd in the strong coupling regime is determined by the different degree of environmental non - markovianity , and is independent of the spectrum density function @xmath17 .",
