    "<S> several discussions of the implications of class ( iii ) models for lep phenomenology have already appeared @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> our purpose here is to propose a general analysis strategy for these models which is adapted from those already used for the other classes of models , and might be suitable for adoption in experimental analyses . </S>",

    "<S> auxiliary parameters in a @xmath3 analysis are the ratio tan@xmath16 of higgs v.e.v.s , and the masses of the sleptons @xmath17 and @xmath18 , which affect the cross sections at lep for associated production of pairs of neutralinos @xmath19 and pair production of the lighter chargino @xmath20 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath3 plane is well suited for exposing the domain of parameter space in which the cdf event  @xcite is interpreted as chargino pair production , followed by @xmath21 decay into a pair of @xmath22 final states .    </S>",
    "<S> it is also usual to analyze lep constraints on slepton production in class ( ii ) models using the plane of the parameters @xmath23 , which are related simply to underlying supergravity parameters @xmath24  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this plane can also usefully be analyzed in class ( iii ) models , taking into account the @xmath3 analysis proposed above  . </S>",

    "<S> the process which gives the most stringent constraints in this plane is @xmath34 ( see also  @xcite ) , which depends on the selectron mass @xmath35 ( assumed here to be degenerate : @xmath36 ) , followed by @xmath37 decay . </S>",
    "<S> the associated production of @xmath11 and @xmath38 , followed by @xmath39 and @xmath40 decays , may also contribute to @xmath28 @xcite , so it is conservative to retain just the @xmath41 production process . </S>",

    "<S> as an example of the case of non - degenerate masses , for @xmath44 and @xmath45 we obtain a line between the two solid lines in figs .  </S>",

    "<S> the @xmath48 is larger than that to the @xmath49 , so the common mass we use here would be closer to @xmath50 in a model with non - degenerate masses .    </S>",

    "<S> they represent , respectively , the kinematic limit of lep 2w   process for most values of @xmath54 up to this limit . </S>",

    "<S> the dotted region is that in which the chargino interpretation may be valid , with the constraint @xmath57 also applied @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> most models capable of fitting the cdf event in fact have @xmath58 : applying this constraint would bound the dotted region further away from the @xmath59 line , reducing the scope for a model to lie above the @xmath52 gev solid line .    </S>",
    "<S> it is immediately apparent from figs .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : m2mu2 ] ,  [ fig : m2mu8 ] that the lep 2w bounds in the class ( iii ) radiative decay framework discussed here are much stronger than those in the conventional stable - neutralino scenario of class ( ii ) , at least in the region of the @xmath3 plane where the lightest neutralino has a predominant gaugino component . in the limit @xmath46 , where the lightest neutralino is almost a pure @xmath60 gaugino @xmath61 , </S>",
    "<S> the lep 2w lower limit on @xmath2 may be almost a factor two higher in class ( iii ) models than in class ( ii ) models . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , the direct lower limit @xmath62 gev may be improved to @xmath63 gev for small @xmath35 .    </S>",
    "<S> this observation implies that a significant fraction of the range of @xmath56 in which the chargino interpretation of the cdf event is tenable may be excluded by the preliminary lep 2w data , if @xmath64 is not very large . looking in more detail at figs .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : m2mu2 ] ,  [ fig : m2mu8 ] , we see that the lep 2w bounds may be least restrictive for models in which @xmath65 is close to the upper limit of @xmath66 or for selectron masses that are not too small . </S>",
    "<S> it so happens that the specific no - scale supergravity model studied in @xcite appears just in this particular region , for tan@xmath67 , as indicated by the dot - dashed line in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : m2mu8 ] . for reference , in this model the selectron masses when entering ( leaving ) the chargino region ( _ i.e. _ , for @xmath68 ) are @xmath69 and @xmath70 . taking these selectron mass variations into account , one may conclude that @xmath71 is required , which corresponds to excluding approximately the first half of the portion of the dot - dashed curve that intercepts the dotted region .    </S>",
    "<S> we now turn to the analysis of the @xmath72 plane . to simplify this analysis initially , we consider the limit of large @xmath73 , where @xmath11 is asymptotically a pure @xmath61 state , and @xmath74 becomes an irrelevant parameter . in this limiting case , we find the contour shown as a solid line in fig .  [ fig : selchi ] , where @xmath75 pb , the upper limit on @xmath28 that we infer from the preliminary lep 2w data . </S>",
    "<S> the large-@xmath73 asymptotic limits of the solid lines for the values @xmath43 gev in figs .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : m2mu2 ] ,  [ fig : m2mu8 ] may be read from this plot .    </S>",
    "<S> the region of the @xmath76 plane that is consistent with the kinematics of the selectron interpretation of the cdf event @xcite is delineated by the dotted lines in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : selchi ] . </S>",
    "<S> we see that a significant fraction of this region is excluded by our interpretation of the preliminary lep 2w data , if one is in the @xmath61 limit : @xmath77 . to assess the significance of the inferred lep 2w limit for the selectron interpretation away from this limit , we have generated a set of @xmath78 models with @xmath79 gev ( so as to be accessible at lep 2w ) and @xmath80 gev ( so that the dominant source of events for cdf is selectron - pair production ) , but no other _ a priori _ selection of @xmath0 or @xmath2 . for each of these models </S>",
    "<S> , we have then found the value of @xmath35 that yields @xmath81 pb . these models are shown as dots in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : selchi ] . </S>",
    "<S> we see that they cluster relatively close to the @xmath61 line . </S>",
    "<S> thus , a non - negligible fraction of the parameter space for the selectron interpretation of the cdf event is also explored by lep 2w , even away from the @xmath61 limit .    </S>",
    "<S> the selectron interpretation is therefore significantly constrained by the preliminary lep 2w data , as we already showed to be the case for the chargino interpretation . </S>",
    "<S> models compatible with both the preliminary lep 2w data and the selectron interpretation of the cdf event are required to have @xmath82 gev , beyond the reach of future lep 2 upgrades . in the case of the specific model in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , the correlation between the ( right - handed ) selectron and neutralino masses is indicated by the dot - dashed line , most of which lies within the region consistent with the kinematics of the cdf event in the selectron interpretation . </S>",
    "<S> the lep 2w constraints in this model require @xmath71 and @xmath83 gev , bounded from below by a point which lies very close to the pure @xmath61 line .    over the next couple of years , the lep beam energy will be increased in steps up to about @xmath84 gev . </S>",
    "<S> this will enable the sensitivity in @xmath65 to be extended to about @xmath85 gev . as can be seen in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : selchi ] , this should be sufficient to explore essentially all the domain of the @xmath86 region compatible with the selectron interpretation of the cdf event , at least in the large-@xmath73 limit ( and certainly in the model of ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) . turning back to figs .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : m2mu2 ] ,  [ fig : m2mu8 ] , we see that this is not necessarily the case for the chargino interpretation . if @xmath35 is large ( _ i.e. _ , @xmath87 ) , and/or if @xmath88 , there are regions of parameter space that will not be accessible to lep 2 , even at its maximum energy .    </S>",
    "<S> the main purpose of this paper has not been to consider the possible implications of the present preliminary lep 2w data , or possible future lep 2 data , for any specific light - gravitino model , whether or not it is motivated by the cdf event . </S>",
    "<S> our objective has rather been to indicate how one may analyze experimental constraints on such models , using an approach adapted from previous analyses of models in which the lightest neutralino is stable . </S>",
    "<S> as we have emphasized , the lep constraints on the unstable - neutralino models may be even stronger than those on stable - neutralino models , because the presence of a pair of energetic photons provides an additional signature that enables , in particular , the process @xmath89  which has the lowest threshold of any supersymmetric process  to be observed . </S>",
    "<S> we believe that future analyses by the lep collaborations will enable a large fraction of the parameter space of such models to be explored . </S>"
