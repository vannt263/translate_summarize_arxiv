    "active galactic nuclei ( agn ) are not only witnesses of the phases of galaxy formation and/or assembly , but are most likely among leading actors .",
    "indeed , three seminal discoveries indicate tight links and feedbacks between super - massive black holes ( smbh ) , nuclear activity and galaxy evolution .",
    "the first is the discovery of smbh in the center of most nearby bulge dominated galaxies , and the tight correlation between their masses and galaxy bulge properties ( gebhardt et al .",
    "2000 , ferrarese & merritt 2000 , marconi & hunt 2003 and references therein ) .",
    "the second is that the growth of smbh is mostly due to accretion of matter during their active phases , and therefore that most bulge galaxies passed a phase of strong nuclear activity ( soltan 1982 , marconi et al .",
    "the third is that the evolution of agn is luminosity dependent , with lower luminosity agn peaking at a redshift lower than luminous qsos ( hasinger 2003 , 2005 , fiore et al .",

    "all three discoveries imply that obtaining a complete census of accreting smbh through the cosmic epochs and constraining accretion efficiency and feedbacks are crucial steps toward the understanding of galaxy formation and evolution .",
    "first attempts to constrain models for the formation and evolution of structure in the universe using the evolving optical and x - ray agn luminosity functions have been presented by granato et al .",

    "in particular , the menci et al .",
    "model links the evolution of the galaxies in the hierarchical clustering scenarios with the changing accretion rates of cold gas onto the central smbh that powers the qso ( cavaliere & vittorini 2000 ) .",
    "the results of this model were encouraging , in the sense that it predicts a trend of lower luminosity agn to peak at increasingly lower redshift , as observed .",
    "however , from a quantitative point of view , the model over - predicts by a factor of about 2 the space density of low - to - intermediate luminosity ( seyfert like ) agns at z=1.5 - 2.5 with respect to present x - ray observations .",
    "furthermore , marconi et .",
    "al . ( 2004 , 2007 in preparation ) derived a smbh mass function from the x - ray selected agn luminosity functions ( e.g. la franca et al . 2005 ) that falls short by a factor of about 2 to the `` relic '' smbh mass function , evaluated using the m@xmath5 / m@xmath6m@xmath7 relationships and the local bulge s luminosity function .",
    "the most likely explanation for both discrepancies is that present x - ray surveys , although very efficient to probe unobscured and moderately obscured agn ( with column densities up to a few @xmath8 @xmath9 , the so - called compton thin agns ) , miss most of the very highly obscured , but still strongly accreting objects , the so called compton thick agns , with a column density n@xmath10 @xmath9 ( see comastri 2004 ) .",
    "indeed , only a handful of the faintest sources in the chandra deep fields may be compton thick ( see la franca et al . 2005 and tozzi et al . 2006 ) .",
    "so we still may be viewing just the tip of the iceberg of the highly obscured agn population .",
    "compton thick objects may well be more common at high redshift , as suggested on theoretical ground by silk & rees ( 1998 ) and fabian ( 1999 ) and on observational ground by e.g. gilli et al .",

    "furthermore , many obscured agn may still be anyway missed by this technique .",

    "we do not pretend to select _ all _ agn through optical and infrared photometry . as explained before x - rays are much more efficient in selecting unobscured ( i.e. broad line agns ) and moderately obscured agns .",
    "we concentrate our effort on highly obscured agn only and we limit our analysis to the high infrared luminosity agn population .",
    "the driving consideration is that differences between nuclear and star - formation emission are emphasized comparing the observed seds with galaxy templates over a range as broad as possible ( also see martinez - sansigre et al .",

    "four of these sources have a spectroscopic redshift , 99 have photometric redshift in the goods - music catalog . for four sources",
    "we could only compute a lower limit to the redshift . in conclusion , we have redshifts or limits for 107 sources . both median redshift and infrared luminosity are similar to those of the 22 sources with a direct x - ray detection .",
    "the redshift and infrared luminosities distributions of the f(24@xmath0m)/f(r)@xmath15 and r - k@xmath16 sources are compared in figure [ zdist ] to those of the full goods - music 24@xmath0 m and x - ray selected samples .",
    "the f(24@xmath0m)/f(r)@xmath15 and r - k@xmath16 sources have a redshift distribution with median redshift 1.91 ( 0.30 ) .",
    "excluding the lower limits @xmath17z@xmath18=1.9 ( 0.28 ) .",
    "this distribution is shifted toward higher redshifts than both the full goods - music 24@xmath0 m source sample and the x - ray selected agn sample ( figure [ zdist ] left panel ) .",
    "the right panel of figure [ zdist ] shows that moderately obscured , x - ray selected sources are concentrated below z=1.5 and span a range of infrared luminosities log@xmath19 their median 2 - 10 kev and infrared luminosities are 43.16 ( 0.56 ) and 43.84 ( 0.57 ) respectively .",
    "on the other hand , the f(24@xmath0m)/f(r)@xmath15 and r - k@xmath16 sources are concentrated between z=1.2 and z=2.6 and have infrared luminosities from log@xmath20 to log@xmath21 , with a median 44.34 ( 0.30 ) , luminosities similar to that of the x - ray selected agns at the same redshift .",
    "table 1 gives the results of the template fits to the observed seds of the 107 sources with a redshift . in 65% of the cases",
    "agn templates provide the best fit .",
    "the majority of these seds are best fitted by one of the templates in figure [ seds ] , the others are best fitted by one of the agn templates of polletta et al .",
    "only one sed is best fitted by the template of a type 1 agn .",
    "36 seds are best fitted by star - forming galaxy templates ( in 30 cases the best fit is obtained using powerful star - forming galaxy templates , like those of arp220 and ngc6090 ) . in conclusion ,",
    "the results of the sed fitting analysis confirm that the majority of the sources with f(24@xmath0m)/f(r)@xmath15 and r - k@xmath16 may be highly obscured agns .",
    "however , we remark that the results of the template fitting should not be always considered a quantitative determination of the nature of each single source , since in many cases different templates can produce fits with similar @xmath22 in the observed optical to 24@xmath0 m band , producing a degeneracy difficult to account for .",
    "therefore , the results of the template fittings should only be taken as a qualitative indication of the population properties of the samples .      to validate our highly obscured agn selection sample and assess quantitatively the fraction of bona - fide agns in the f(24@xmath0m)/f(r)@xmath15 and r - k@xmath16 sample",
    ", we performed a detailed `` stacking '' analysis of the x - ray data of the 24@xmath0 m selected sources .",
    "indeed , thanks to the low chandra background , it is possible to increase the effective exposure time and derive average properties of undetected objects , using these stacking techniques : counts at the positions of known sources are co - added in order to probe x - ray emission substantially below the single source sensitivity limit .",
    "we performed a stacking analysis of the 111 sources not directly detected in the chandra 1 msec x - ray image .",
    "as control samples we used the 22 sources with f(24@xmath0m)/f(r)@xmath15 and r - k@xmath16 and an x - ray counterpart , a sample of sources with f(24@xmath0m)/f(r)@xmath15 and r - k@xmath23 ( 51 sources after the exclusion of the sources directly detected in the x - ray image ) and a sample of sources with f(24@xmath0m)/f(r)@xmath24 and r - k@xmath184.5 ( 73 sources after the exclusion of the sources directly detected in the x - ray image ) .",
    "the total exposure times for the four source samples are 94 msec , 19.5msec , 43 msec and 61 msec respectively .",
    "the top panels of figure [ hrstack]a ) show the x - ray stack of the 111 24@xmath0 m sources with f(24@xmath0m)/f(r)@xmath15 and r - k@xmath16 in two energy bands .",
    "this is compared to the stack of 73 sources with f(24@xmath0m)/f(r)@xmath24 and r - k@xmath16 and no direct x - ray detections ( lower panels ) .",
    "we choose the bands 0.3 - 1.5 kev ( soft band , s ) and 1.5 - 4 kev ( hard band , h ) to keep the level of the internal background as low as possible and similar in the two bands . at a typical redshift of 2 these bands",
    "correspond to rest frame energies of 0.9 - 4.5 kev and 4.5 - 12 kev respectively .",
    "the stack of the high f(24@xmath0m)/f(r ) and high r - k sources produces a detection in both soft and hard bands , with count rates @xmath25 counts / s and @xmath26 counts / s in the two bands respectively ( using a 2 arcsec radius extraction region ) .",
    "the hardness ratio h - s / h+s measured for this sample is therefore 0.12@xmath270.15 .",
    "conversely , no detection in either bands is obtained for the stack of 51 sources with high f(24@xmath0m)/f(r ) and low r - k , with 1@xmath28 upper limits of @xmath29 counts / s .",
    "the stack of the low f(24@xmath0m)/f(r ) and high r - k sources produces a significant detection only in the soft band , with count rate @xmath30 counts / s .",
    "the count rate measured in the hard band is significant at less than 3 @xmath28 and corresponds to @xmath31 counts / s .",
    "the corresponding hardness ratio is h - s / h+s=-0.58@xmath270.18 .",
    "the stack of the 22 sources with f(24@xmath0m)/f(r)@xmath15 and r - k@xmath16 and an x - ray counterpart produces a hardness ratio h - s / h+s@xmath320.01 . in conclusion , the stack of the 111 sources with f(24@xmath0m)/f(r)@xmath15 and r - k@xmath16 and without a direct x - ray detection produces a significant signal in both soft and hard x - ray bands .",
    "it is interesting to note that its hardness ratio suggests an average spectrum harder than even the average spectrum of the 22 sources with similar ir and optical colors but with a direct x - ray detection .",
    "we used the observed flux in the stacked images , together with the hardness ratio h - s / h+s , to constrain the fraction of highly obscured agn in the samples . to this purpose",
    ", we generated simulated x - ray count rates and hardness ratios as a function of the fraction of the agn , assuming that the f(24@xmath0m)/f(r)@xmath15 and r - k@xmath16 source sample is made by obscured agns and star - forming galaxies .",
    "we started from the observed redshift and infrared luminosities , and for the obscured agn we assumed a log(@xmath33m)/l(2 - 10 kev ) ) luminosity ratio chosen randomly in the range 0.4 - 1.2 .",
    "the lower value is the typical ratio found by silva et al .",
    "( 2003 ) for low luminosity seyfert 2 galaxies with column density log@xmath34 .",
    "it is also similar to the ratio found for the two hellas2xmm sources a2690_75 and bpm16274_69 .",
    "the upper value is the ratio found for the powerful obscured qso iras09104 + 4109 ( piconcelli et al .",
    "2007 ) .    for the star - forming galaxies we used a log(@xmath33m)/l(2 - 10 kev ) ) luminosity ratio between 2 and 2.8 .",
    "these two values are obtained assuming a total infrared to 2 - 10 kev logarithmic luminosity ratio of 3.6 ( ranalli et al .",
    "2003 ) and correcting this for the ratio between the total infrared luminosity and the 5.8@xmath0 m luminosity of powerful star - forming galaxies and spirals templates .",
    "we further assumed that the star - forming galaxies are not obscured in x - rays , while the agns are highly obscured .",
    "for the latter objects , we adopted a flat logn@xmath35 distribution from 23 to 26 @xmath9 .    for a given fraction of agn in the sample ,",
    "we first decide , using a random generator , whether each source is an agn or a star - forming galaxy .",
    "then , if the source turned out to be an agn , we choose an absorbing column density using again a random generator and the assumed logn@xmath35 distribution .",
    "we computed unobscured 2 - 10 kev luminosities from infrared luminosities , and then x - ray fluxes by folding a power law spectrum with spectral energy index of 0.8 reduced at low energy by photoelectric absorption with a chandra response matrix . for column densities",
    "@xmath36 @xmath9 we assumed that the direct emission is completely blocked by photoelectric absorption and compton scattering . for these sources we assumed a reflection component with normalization 1/100 of the direct component and same spectral index .",
    "a small fraction of the simulated count rates ( 20 - 30% ) is higher than the chandra detection limit .",
    "this was expected , given the fact that 22 out of 135 sources with f(24@xmath0m)/f(r)@xmath15 and r - k@xmath16 do have x - ray counterparts .",
    "since we are interested in the fraction of agn in the sources not directly detected in the chandra images , these count rates have been excluded from the following analysis .    the result of the simulations is shown in figure [ hrstack ] , right panel . according to our simulations ,",
    "the average hardness ratio of the f(24@xmath0m)/f(r)@xmath15 and r - k@xmath16 source sample without x - ray detection is reproduced if 80@xmath2715% of the sources in the sample are highly obscured agns .",
    "the hardness ratio of the sources with f(24@xmath0m)/f(r)@xmath24 and r - k@xmath16 is reproduced if the fraction of the obscured agn is in the range 0 - 20% .",
    "changing the assumptions made to produce the simulations within reasonable ranges changes only slightly this result .",
    "the result of the simulations concerning the f(24@xmath0m)/f(r)@xmath15 and r - k@xmath16 source sample is well consistent with the indication coming from the 1 - 24@xmath0 m sed fitting with galaxy and agn templates presented in the previous section .",
    "we selected a source sample with extreme mid - infrared to optical flux ratio ( f(24@xmath0m)/f(r)@xmath181000 ) and red optical colors ( r - k@xmath184.5 ) in the goods cdfs area .",
    "these sources are among the most luminous sources in the goods 24@xmath0 m sample , because of the correlation of f(24@xmath0m)/f(r ) with the infrared luminosity ( see figures [ mirolir ] and [ zdist ] , right panel ) . the fraction of these sources not directly detected in the chandra images produces a significant stacked signal in both chandra soft and hard x - rays bands .",
    "a detailed analysis based on montecarlo simulation shows that the stacked count rates and hardness ratios can be reproduced if this source population is dominated by highly obscured ( n@xmath37 @xmath9 ) agns .",
    "this conclusion is further confirmed by the following consideration .",
    "if we assume that this source population is dominated by star - forming galaxies , we can use the observed infrared luminosity and the dust - corrected uv luminosities to derive two different estimates of star - formation rates . on one hand total infrared luminosities",
    "have been converted to a star - formation rate using the following formula : @xmath38 , ( kennicutt 1998 ) . on the other hand",
    "the uv star - formation rate is an output of the fits of the observed seds with synthetic models .",
    "these models have been obtained using the bruzual & charlot ( 2003 ) models , parametrizing the star - formation histories with a variety of exponentially declining laws ( with timescales ranging from 0.1 to 15 gyrs ) and metallicities ( from @xmath39 to @xmath40 , see grazian et al .",
    "2006 and references therein for further detail ) .",
    "dust extinction is added to all star - forming models , with @xmath41 and a calzetti attenuation curve . given the very red colors of our objects in the optical bands ,",
    "they are typically fit with star - forming templates with a large dust extinction ( @xmath42 ) , resulting in a star - formation rate much larger than what derived by a simple , dust free uv - to - sfr conversion .",
    "the median logarithmic star - formation rate from infrared luminosity is 2.31 ( 0.59 ) @xmath43yr .",
    "the median logarithmic uv star - formation rate is 0.83 ( 0.80)@xmath43yr , a factor 30 lower .",
    "the large mismatch between these two estimates strongly suggests that the infrared luminosity of this source sample is not dominated by star - formation but rather by accretion . as a comparison ,",
    "the median infrared and uv star - formation rates of the sources with f(24@xmath0m)/f(r)@xmath24 and r - k@xmath184.5 in our control sample are 1.26 ( 0.38 ) and 1.10 ( 0.30 ) , consistent with each other , suggesting that the infrared luminosity of these sources is not dominated by nuclear accretion ( in agreement with their x - ray hardness ratio , see previous section ) .",
    "we can now compare the number of highly obscured agns selected at 24@xmath0 m and not detected in x - rays , with the number of unobscured and moderately obscured agns directly seen in the x - ray images . to reduce the importance of complex selection effects we limit this analysis to the sources in the redshift bin 1.2 - 2.6 . at z=2.6",
    "the 5.8@xmath0 m luminosity corresponding to the limit of 40@xmath0jy at 24@xmath0 m is log(@xmath44m))=44.3 - 44.2 for seyfert 2,1.8 galaxy seds , and 44.4 - 44.5 for the four seds in figure [ seds ] . assuming a log(@xmath45m)/l(2 - 10 kev ) )",
    "luminosity ratio in the range 0.4 - 1.2 implies unobscured 2 - 10 kev luminosities in the range 43.3 - 43.9 .",
    "this suggests to limit the comparison to the sources with logl(2 - 10 kev)@xmath46 and log(@xmath44m))@xmath1144.2 .    in the 1.2 - 2.6 redshift bin",
    "there are at least 46@xmath2710 sources with f(24@xmath0m)/f(r)@xmath181000 , r - k@xmath16 , log(@xmath47m))@xmath1144.2 and no direct x - ray detection ( 80@xmath1 of 57 sources ) , which are probably highly obscured agns , and 44 x - ray selected agns , 7 of which with broad lines in their optical spectra .",
    "the number of 24@xmath0 m selected , presumably highly obscured agns , missed by the cdfs x - ray survey is therefore similar to the number of x - ray selected agns .",

    "these luminosities translate to x - ray fluxes between a few times @xmath48 and @xmath49 , meaning that these sources would have been easily detected if they were not highly obscured .",

    "( 2007 ) agn synthesis model for the cosmic x - ray background predicts about 40 compton thick agns with the same limits for redshift and luminosity .",

    "( 2004 , 2007 in preparation ) derived a smbh mass function from the x - ray selected agn luminosity functions that falls short by a factor of about 2 to the `` relic '' smbh mass function .",
    "this difference can be greatly alleviated adding the population of infrared selected , highly obscured agns to the agn selected in the x - ray band below 10 kev .",
    "finally , we note that the population of infrared selected , highly obscured agns , can help in reconciling the predictions of models of galaxy evolution with the observed agn number densities at z@xmath51 .",
    "indeed , the menci et al ( 2004 ) model predicts a number of low - to - intermediate luminosity agns at z=1.5 - 2.5 about twice with respect to that measured through x - ray 2 - 10 kev surveys ( la franca et al .",
    "2005 , fiore 2006 ) .",
    "we found above that in the redshift bin 1.2 - 2.6 the number of x - ray selected agn with logl(2 - 10kev)@xmath46 is comparable to that of the infrared selected , highly obscured agns .",
    "therefore , adding together the two populations would give a total number density of agns similar to that predicted by the menci et al .",
    "( 2004 ) model .",
    "more detailed , quantitative , agn number density calculations , spanning wider redshift and luminosity ranges , are beyond the purpose of this paper and will be presented elsewhere ( fiore et al . in preparation ) .",
    "most of the goods - music 24@xmath0 m selected sources with high f(24@xmath0m)/f(r ) , high r - k and no x - ray detection have a very faint optical and near infrared counterpart , only 14% of the sample having r@xmath52 .",
    "furthermore , only a handful of objects have a mid infrared flux high enough ( f(24@xmath0m@xmath53mjy ) to allow spitzer irs spectroscopy .",
    "the spectroscopic identification of @xmath5490% of the sample must therefore await the advent of elts or the launch of jwst .",
    "our analysis is limited to agns of intermediate luminosity at z@xmath55 . to extend the coverage of the luminosity - redshift plane",
    "requires a complementary observation strategy .",
    "particularly useful to this purpose is the swire survey , which has both spitzer and optical medium - deep coverage on @xmath56 deg@xmath57 of sky . as an example , the swire survey contains hundreds of sources with extreme f(24@xmath0m)/f(r ) flux ratios and red optical - near infrared colors .",
    "interestingly , several dozens of these extreme sources have 24@xmath0 m flux higher than @xmath58 mjy , allowing spitzer irs spectroscopy , and/or optical magnitude brighter than r@xmath59 , allowing spectroscopy with 8 m class telescopes . furthermore , all these sources are well within the reach of herschel instruments between 75 and 500 @xmath0 m .",
    "such long wavelengths observations can greatly help in separating nuclear activity from star formation when the two components have comparable integrated luminosities , e.g. in low luminosity , seyfert like , agns .",
