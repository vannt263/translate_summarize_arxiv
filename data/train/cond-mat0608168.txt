    "the field of spintronics is concerned with search for highly spin - polarized materials .",
    "one aim is to enhance tunnelling magnetoresistance ( tmr ) of magnetic tunnel junctions ( mtjs ) which are active members of magnetic random access memory ( mram ) elements .",
    "also , the highly spin - polarized materials are of paramount importance for increasing spin - polarization of currents injected into semiconductors , required for an optimal operation of spintronics devices.@xcite there appears to be a number of ways to achieve high spin - polarization , most notably by employing fully spin - polarized ferromagnetic metals , namely half - metals ( hm ) .",
    "@xcite another possibility is to exploit features of the band structure of such tunnel barrier materials as e.g. mgo , and filtering electronic wave functions according to their symmetry in order to select the most highly spin - polarized ones.@xcite the least explored possibility is exploiting the spin - filtering effect , based on ferromagnetic or ferrimagnetic insulating barriers .",
    "it was introduced by moodera et al.@xcite , using eus tunnel barriers .",
    "spin filtering effect has been demonstrated in gd / eus / al junctions @xcite , which exhibit high magnetoresistance , but show no great prospects for technological applications , on account of the low curie temperature , t@xmath3 , of eus .",
    "spinel ferrites  @xcite have been studied for many years both regarding their magnetic behaviour and correlated nature in conjunction with their structural properties to increase their performance in high - frequency devices .",
    "some of them can probably be used as spin filters .",
    "spin - dependent gap should result in spin - dependent barrier for tunnelling of electrons through the insulator , giving rise to spin filtering .",
    "since the tunnelling probability depends exponentially on the barrier height , the spin filtering efficiency can be very high .",
    "candidates for spin filters include such spinel ferrites as nife@xmath0o@xmath1 , cofe@xmath0o@xmath1 and mnfe@xmath0o@xmath1  @xcite .",
    "in particular , recently a spin filtering efficiency of up to 22% by the nife@xmath0o@xmath1 barrier has been reported by lders et al .",
    "@xcite in addition , lders et al .",
    "@xcite have demonstrated tmr of 120% in la@xmath4sr@xmath5mno@xmath2/srtio@xmath2/nife@xmath0o@xmath1 junctions , which corresponds to 45% spin polarization for the conductive nife@xmath0o@xmath1 film , which stays constant up to about 300 k.    these spinel ferrites belong to the same family as magnetite ( fe@xmath2o@xmath1 ) which has been most thoroughly studied both for its hm character and the famous charge order  @xcite .",
    "many theoretical studies have been dedicated to magnetite , and in particular its charge order ( which will not be discussed in the present paper ) using various approximations to density functional theory ( dft ) such as local spin density ( lsd ) approximation or generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) , as well as going beyond , for example by invoking the hubbard u through the lda+u ( local density approximation + u ) approach , or using the self - interaction corrected ( sic)-lsd method .",
    "@xcite for the other spinel ferrites most theoretical studies have been done with lsd , gga  @xcite or hybrid density functionals.@xcite the former two approaches usually describe these materials to be half - metallic and not insulating , if no distortions are included .",
    "the reason is that the transition metal ( tm ) @xmath6 electrons in oxides ( as well as @xmath7 electrons in rare earth compounds ) are strongly correlated and can not be adequately described within the standard band theory framework with such approximations as lsd or gga , placing them too high in energy around the fermi level .",
    "the sic - lsd method  @xcite , on the other hand , provides better description of correlations than lsd , and was successfully applied to a variety of @xmath8 and @xmath9electron materials @xcite . in this paper",
    "we apply the self - interaction corrected local spin density ( sic - lsd ) approximation to study the electronic structure of spinel transition metal oxides mnfe@xmath0o@xmath1 , fe@xmath2o@xmath1 , cofe@xmath0o@xmath1 , and nife@xmath0o@xmath1 .",
    "we concentrate on the nominal valence of the tm elements and electronic and magnetic properties of these systems in both normal and inverse spinel structures .",
    "the reason being that in most cases these materials appear to exist as some mixture of those structures .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "an overview of the basic features of the sic - lsd formalism is presented in the next section .",
    "section iii gives some computational details , whilst the results of the application of the sic - lsd method to the spinel ferrites tmfe@xmath0o@xmath1 ( with tm = mn , fe , co and ni ) , are presented and discussed in section iv .",
    "the paper is concluded in section v.",
    "the basis of the sic - lsd formalism is a self - interaction free total energy functional , @xmath10 , obtained by subtracting from the lsd total energy functional , @xmath11 , a spurious self - interaction of each occupied electron state @xmath12@xcite , namely @xmath13 here @xmath14 numbers the occupied states and the self - interaction correction for the state @xmath14 is @xmath15+e_{xc}^{lsd}[\\bar{n}_{\\alpha } ] , \\ ] ] with @xmath16 $ ] being the hartree energy and @xmath17 $ ] the lsd exchange - correlation energy for the corresponding charge density @xmath18 and spin density @xmath19 .",
    "it is the lsd approximation to the exact exchange - correlation energy functional which gives rise to the spurious self - interaction .",
    "the exact exchange - correlation energy @xmath20 has the property that for any single electron spin density , @xmath19 , it cancels exactly the hartree energy , thus @xmath21+e_{xc}[\\bar{n}_{\\alpha } ] = 0.\\label{can}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in the lsd approximation this cancellation does not take place , and for well localized states the above sum can be substantially different than zero . for extended states in periodic solids the self - interaction vanishes .",
    "the sic - lsd approach can be viewed as an extension of lsd in the sense that the self - interaction correction is only finite for spatially localized states , while for bloch - like single - particle states @xmath10 is equal to @xmath11 .",
    "thus , the lsd minimum is also a local minimum of @xmath10 .",
    "a question now arises , whether there exist other competitive minima , corresponding to a finite number of localized states , which could benefit from the self - interaction term without loosing too much of the energy associated with band formation .",
    "this is often the case for rather well localized electrons like the 3@xmath6 electrons in transition metal oxides or the 4@xmath22 electrons in rare earth compounds .",
    "it follows from minimization of eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) that within the sic - lsd approach such localized electrons move in a different potential than the delocalized valence electrons which respond to the effective lsd potential .",
    "thus , by including an explicit energy contribution for an electron to localize , the _ ab initio _ sic - lsd describes both localized and delocalized electrons on an equal footing , leading to a greatly improved description of correlation effects over the lsd approximation , as well as , to determination of valence .    in order to make the connection between valence and localization more explicit , it is useful to define the nominal valence @xcite as @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the atomic number ( 26 for fe ) , @xmath25 is the number of core ( and semi - core ) electrons ( 18 for fe ) , and @xmath26 is the number of localized , i.e. , self - interaction corrected , states ( either five or six , respectively for fe@xmath27 and fe@xmath28 ) .",
    "thus , in this formulation the valence is equal to the integer number of electrons available for band formation .",
    "the localized electrons do not participate in bonding . to find the nominal valence we assume various atomic configurations , consisting of different numbers of localized states , and minimize the sic - lsd energy functional of eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) with respect to the number of localized electrons .",
    "the sic - lsd formalism is governed by the energetics due to the fact that for each orbital the sic differentiates between the energy gain due to hybridization of the orbital with the valence bands and the energy gain upon localization of the orbital . whichever wins determines if the orbital is part of the valence band or not , and in this manner also leads to the evaluation of the valence of elements involved .",
    "the sic depends on the choice of orbitals and its value can differ substantially as a result of this . therefore , one has to be guided by the energetics in defining the most optimally localized orbitals to determine the absolute energy minimum of the sic - lsd energy functional .",
    "the advantage of the sic - lsd formalism is that for such systems as transition metal oxides or rare earth compounds the lowest energy solution will describe the situation where some single - electron states may not be of bloch - like form .",
    "specifically , in oxides , mn- , co- , ni- , and fe-3@xmath6 states may be assumed to be localized , but not the o 2@xmath29 states , because treating them as localized is energetically unfavourable .",
    "the sic - lsd approach has been implemented @xcite within the linear muffin - tin - orbital ( lmto ) atomic sphere approximation ( asa ) band structure method  @xcite , in the tight - binding representation  @xcite . in this method",
    "the polyhedral wigner seitz cell is approximated by slightly overlapping atom centered spheres , with a total volume equal to the actual crystal volume , while the electron wave functions are expanded in terms of the screened muffin - tin orbitals , and the minimization of @xmath10 becomes non - linear in the expansion coefficients .",
    "the so - called combined correction term  @xcite has been implemented and consistently applied to improve on the asa .",
    "the spinel ferrites of interest to the present study have a general chemical formula of the form @xmath30@xmath0@xmath31@xmath1 and crystallize in the face - centred cubic structure . in the normal spinel structure @xmath32 is a divalent element atom , occupying tetrahedral a sites , while @xmath33 is a trivalent element , sitting on the octahedral b sites .",
    "when @xmath32 is a trivalent element , and @xmath33 consists of equal numbers of divalent and trivalent elements , distributed over crystalographically equivalent b1 and b2 octahedral sites , then the spinel structure is referred to as the inverse kind . in tm",
    "ferrites substantial off - stoichiometry and intersite disorder are often present in samples , but are not considered in this paper .",
    "the high temperature phase of magnetite is known to have the inverse spinel structure , where @xmath32 atoms are fe@xmath27 ions , and b sites are equally populated by fe@xmath28 and fe@xmath27 ions .",
    "similarly , the nife@xmath0o@xmath1 system has been established experimentally to crystallize in the inverse spinel structure , with the a sites being fe@xmath27 ions , while b sites equally populated by ni@xmath28 and fe@xmath27 ions .",
    "the mnfe@xmath0o@xmath1 , on the other hand , is considered to be predominantly of the normal spinel kind , as about 80% of a sites are populated by mn@xmath28 ions .",
    "@xcite the cofe@xmath0o@xmath1 material is considered to be mostly an inverse spinel compound with about 80% of divalent co ions occupying octahedral sites .",
    "@xcite as the experimental situation with respect to the observed structures and tm valences is not fully established , and the computer simulation of the exact physical conditions is very difficult , in this paper we study both extremes , namely the normal and inverse spinel structures for all the systems .",
    "in addition , we investigate a number of different valence scenarios , defined in the following sections , to find the most energetically favourable solutions , be it only at zero temperature , for all the studied systems .",
    "regarding the magnetic structure of the ferrites , we assume that of magnetite , with the spins of the tm atoms on the tetrahedral sublattice being antiparallel to those of the octahedral sublattice . within a given sublattice",
    "the spins of all the tm atoms are arranged in parallel to one another .",
    ".the lattice constants ( a ) and corresponding asa radii ( r@xmath34 ) for the transition metal elements occupying tetrahedral ( @xmath35 ) and octahedral ( @xmath36 ) sites , and for oxygen ions ( in atomic units ) for all the studied spinel ferrites .",
    "the radii of the empty spheres used in the calculations are not given , although typically four to five different types were used , all of the order of 1.65 - 1.95 atomic units , depending on the system , however , never exceeding the size of the oxygen spheres . [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ table6 ]    to understand details of the dos of the i3+ scenario of nife@xmath0o@xmath1 , it is helpful to follow the discussion of the same scenario for cofe@xmath0o@xmath1 , keeping in mind that a ni@xmath27 ion has two minority @xmath6 electrons in addition to the five majority ones , localized by sic . obviously , as already mentioned when discussing mnfe@xmath0o@xmath1 , the positions of the localized @xmath6 peaks calculated in the sic - lsd should not be directly compared with photoemission experiments.@xcite    the changes in the electronic structure of nife@xmath0o@xmath1 when moving from the ground state inverse spinel structure to the normal spinel scenario are immediately obvious from comparing the bottom and top panels of fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] . in the normal spinel case",
    "the ni@xmath28 ions occupy the tetrahedral sites , while the octahedral sites are solely taken by the fe@xmath27 ions . as a result",
    ", the total spin magnetic moment is increased from 2 @xmath37 per formula unit to 8 @xmath37 per formula unit , as seen in table [ table1 ] , in agreement with experimental findings of refs . .",
    "however , as seen in the top panel of fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , the density of states is still just insulating in both spin channels .",
    "also , unlike in the case of the inverse spinel structure , the valence band is strongly spin - polarized , and the polarization is negative .",
    "the oxygen spin magnetic moment is 0.35 @xmath37 , aligned in parallel to the fe spin moment ( see table [ table6 ] ) , and three times the value it has in the inverse spinel structure .",
    "also , the ni spin moment is slightly increased in magnitude to -1.65 @xmath37 . moreover , the exchange splitting of the conduction band is more than twice increased in the normal spinel , in comparison with the inverse spinel structure , from 1.21 ev to 2.93 ev . as in the case of the other spinel ferrites in realizing ni@xmath28 ions , the e@xmath38 states are populated first , i. e. , are lying lower in energy than the t@xmath39 states , which is opposite to the inverse spinel structure .",
    "however , energetically , the normal spinel structure for nife@xmath0o@xmath1 is very unfavourable with respect to the inverse spinel structure ( table [ table1 ] ) . including the spin - orbit coupling for the ground state inverse spinel scenario gives rise to the total orbital moment of 0.67 @xmath37 per formula unit , and is mostly due to ni ions , with some minor contributions from fe atoms .",
    "this calculated value is over two times larger than calculated from lsd in ref . .",
    "also , in the earlier sic - lsd calculations for tm oxides svane and gunnarsson  @xcite obtained the orbital moment for nio of 0.27 @xmath37 , which is substantially smaller than in the present calculations . since the total spin moment",
    "is slightly reduced to 1.9997 @xmath37 per formula unit , when soc is taken into account , hence the ratio of the total orbital and spin moments is calculated to be about 0.34 .",
    "the latter is in good agreement with the experimental estimates of 0.27@xmath400.07  @xcite and 0.34 ( within error bars of up to @xmath400.11 ) for ni in nife@xmath0o@xmath1 and nio .",
    "@xcite note that the orbital moment due to the ni@xmath28 ion alone is about 0.7 @xmath37 , while its spin moment is 1.58 @xmath37 , both per formula unit , giving rise to the orbital to spin moment ratio of 0.44 for this ion .",
    "the total orbital moment is mostly due to the ni@xmath28 ion , as the contributions of other tm ions are smaller by an order of magnitude or so .",
    "we have shown that , owing to a better treatment of correlations , sic - lsd can provide useful insights to the nature of a number of spinel ferromagnetic insulators .",
    "we have been able to address the issues of the normal versus inverse spinel arrangements in these systems , their electronic and magnetic properties and the valence of the transition metal atoms .",
    "we find all the studied ferrites to be insulating for both the inverse and normal spinel scenarios , with the calculated energy gaps being smaller in the normal spinel environment , however showing an increasing trend when moving from mnfe@xmath0o@xmath1 to nife@xmath0o@xmath1 .",
    "we have observed dramatic increase of the calculated spin magnetic moments , as well as the exchange splitting of the conduction bands , when moving from the inverse to normal spinel scenarios , some of which have been observed in experiments .",
    "@xcite    the total energy considerations seem to favour the inverse spinel arrangement of tm ions as the ground state configurations for all the studied ferrites , with the possible exception of mnfe@xmath0o@xmath1 where the normal spinel environment may be preferred , with mn@xmath28 ions on the tetrahedral sites and the fe@xmath27 ions on the octahedral sublattice . also , based on the total energy arguments",
    ", we find a partial delocalization of the minority spin states to be favourable in fe@xmath2o@xmath1 and cofe@xmath0o@xmath1 , leading to the half - metallic ground states with all tm ions in the trivalent configuration and in the inverse spinel arrangement . the fully inverse spinel scenario , with the fe@xmath27 ions on the tetrahedral sites and the octahedral sites occupied both by ni@xmath28 ions and fe@xmath27 ions , is found to be the ground state only in nife@xmath0o@xmath1 .",
    "finally , these findings constitute a good starting point for further studies , incorporating alloying of the normal and inverse spinel structures .",
