    "understanding correlation effects remains the central problem in theoretical quantum chemistry and physics , and the main goal of most of the new theories and models in this research area @xcite . in order to gain some insight into electron correlation",
    ", two - electron model systems have always played a key role by shedding new light on the relative motion of electrons .",
    "two such models are the hooke s law atom ( or harmonium , or hookium ) @xcite and the spherium model @xcite . in hookium ,",
    "the two electrons are bound to the nucleus by a harmonic potential , while in spherium , the position of the electrons are restricted to remain on the surface of a sphere . in both cases ,",
    "the electrons repel coulombically . for these systems ,",
    "the exact solution of the schrdinger equation can be obtained for some discrete values of the confinement parameter ( the force constant for hookium and the radius of the sphere for spherium ) @xcite .",
    "consequently , these model systems ( and others @xcite ) have been extensively used to test various approximations within density functional theory ( dft ) @xcite .",
    "however , the hartree - fock ( hf ) solution is not always available in closed - form ; in hookium for example , although accurate solutions have been found @xcite , no closed - form expression of the ground state hf orbital has been obtained yet .    according to lwdin @xcite ,",
    "the correlation energy ( @xmath0 ) is defined as the error @xmath4 which pertains to the hf approximation @xcite .",
    "@xmath0 is a function of the external potential @xmath5 , the dimensionality of the space where the electrons are moving ( @xmath1 ) , and the interelectronic potential @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the distance between the two electrons .",
    "we define the coulombic and the hooke s law correlation energies as the correlation energies when the two electrons interact _ via _ a repulsive coulomb potential [ @xmath8 or an attractive harmonic potential [ @xmath9 , respectively .",
    "we have recently shown that the coulombic correlation energy is rather insensitive to @xmath5 ( at least in the high - density limit @xcite ) , but strongly dependent on the number of degrees of freedom of the electron pair ( @xmath1 ) .",
    "however , the question of how the interelectronic potential @xmath6 influences the correlation energy has not yet been addressed , and this is indeed the purpose of this article .    in the following , we will consider the @xmath2 ground state of the hooke s law analog of @xmath1-hookium ( known as the moshinsky atom @xcite ) , and @xmath1-spherium ( labeled as @xmath1-hl - spherium in the following ) .",
    "we adopt the convention that a @xmath1-sphere is the surface of a ( @xmath10)-dimensional ball .",
    "thus , in 2-spherium , for example , this is the surface of a three - dimensional ball . for @xmath11 ,",
    "both the exact and hf solutions of the moshinsky atom are known @xcite .",
    "we will generalize these results for any value of @xmath1 in section [ sec : moshinsky ] , and derive the two - electron probability distributions in both the position and momentum space . in section [ sec : teoas ] , we analyze the energy behavior of @xmath1-hl - spherium in both the weakly and strongly correlated regime .",
    "moreover , we demonstrate that the exact solution of the schrdinger equation can be found for two values of the dimensionality ( @xmath12 and @xmath11 ) .",
    "atomic units are used throughout .",

    "the hamiltonian can be separated into the extracule and intracule coordinates , which reads respectively @xmath17 yielding @xmath18                   + \\frac{1}{2 } \\left [ - \\nabla_{\\bm{\\lambda}}^2 + ( 2\\omega^2 + 1 ) \\lambda^2 \\right].\\ ] ] for @xmath19 states in a @xmath1-dimensional space , the laplace operator is given by @xcite @xmath20 this leads to the exact wave function @xmath21 and energy @xmath22 eq .",
    "reveals that the exact energy is linear with respect to the dimensionality @xmath1 , due to the separability of the hamiltonian .      according to the hartree - fock ( hf ) approximation @xcite ,",
    "the total hf wave function of the singlet state is defined as @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the hf orbital , eigenfunction of the fock operator @xmath25 associated with the eigenvalue @xmath26 it can be shown that @xmath27 then , is easily recast as @xmath28 the total hf energy , which also behaves linearly with @xmath1 , is @xmath29      according to , the explicit expression of the correlation energy of the moshinsky atom reads @xmath30 which obviously decreases linearly with @xmath1 .",

    ", the correlation energy of @xmath1-hookium in the weakly correlated limit tends to a constant @xcite .    in the strongly correlated regime ( @xmath33 )",
    ", the exact and hf wave functions of the moshinsky atom become @xmath34 associated with the energies @xmath35 in , the second term ( @xmath36 ) is related with the motion of the center of mass , while the first term ( @xmath37 ) is associated with the zero - point oscillations of the electrons . indeed , in the strongly correlated regime ,",
    "the electrons oscillate with an angular frequency @xmath38 .",
    "such phenomena are ubiquitous in strongly correlated systems , as demonstrated by gori - giorgi , seidl and their coworkers @xcite.    as one can see , the hf solution does not describe properly these oscillations , and thus exhibits a wrong behavior in the large-@xmath14 limit .",
    "@xmath39 ( solid ) , @xmath40 ( dashed ) and @xmath41 ( dotted ) in the moshinsky atom as a function of @xmath42 for the unit force constant and @xmath43,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    to study further the correlation effects in hooke s law systems , we have determined the position intracule @xmath44 of the moshinsky atom ( @xmath45 ) .",
    "@xmath44 gives the probability of finding two electrons separated by a distance @xmath42 @xcite , and is defined by @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the angular component of @xmath48 , and @xmath49 the dirac delta function @xcite . from and , it follows @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the gamma function @xcite .",
    "surprisingly , we have the relation @xmath52 which means the hf intracule is related to the exact one by a scaling of the confinement strength",
    ". this kind of relation could be useful in the future development of intracule functional theory @xcite .    in analogy with the coulomb hole @xcite",
    ", we define the hooke hole as the difference between the position intracule obtained from the exact wavefunction and the corresponding hf one : @xmath53    contrary to the coulomb correlation @xcite , in the moshinsky atom the correlation increases the likelihood of finding the two electrons close together and decreases the probability of larger values of @xmath42 .",
    "it implies that the hooke hole is positive for small @xmath42 and negative for larger @xmath42 .",
    "this behavior is due to the attractive nature of the harmonic potential between the electrons .",
    "it is illustrated in figure [ fig : p ] , where we have reported the position intracules and the hooke hole of the moshinsky atom for @xmath54 and @xmath43 .",
    "@xmath55 ( solid ) , @xmath56 ( dashed ) and @xmath57 ( dotted ) in the moshinsky atom as a function of @xmath58 for the unit force constant and @xmath43.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    the momentum intracule @xcite , which gives the probability of finding the two electrons moving with a relative momenta @xmath58 , has been computed to get some insight into the relative momenta of the electrons : @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the momentum wave function , @xmath61 and @xmath62 are the momenta of electrons 1 and 2 , and @xmath63 is the angular component of @xmath64 .",
    "@xmath60 is obtained from the position wave function by a fourier transform :    @xmath65    where @xmath66 are the extracule and intracule coordinates in momentum space . using and , the exact and hf momentum intracules are given by @xmath67 from and , we show that the property related to the position intracule is still valid for the momentum intracule : @xmath68 the results are gathered in figure [ fig : m ] , where we have represented the momentum intracules and the hooke hole in momentum space @xmath69 the exact and hf momentum intracules exhibit a similar shape to the position intracules , but the hooke hole in momentum space is drastically different from its position space counterpart .",
    "indeed , the correlation in momentum space favors electrons moving with high relative momentum , while correlation in position space evidences a decrease of the probability of finding electrons further apart . once again , this behavior is different in hookium , in which correlation favors both lower and higher relative momenta @xcite .",
    "this is also due to the attractive nature of the interelectronic potential .",
    "in terms of the interelectronic angle ( @xmath70 ) , the hamiltonian of two electrons on a @xmath1-sphere of radius @xmath71 , and interacting with a force constant @xmath72 is @xcite @xmath73                   + \\omega^2 r^2 \\left(1 - \\cos \\theta \\right).\\ ] ] after the energy scaling @xmath74 , and the definition of the dimensionless variable @xmath75 , the hamiltonian reduces to @xmath76                   + \\omega^2 \\left(1 - \\cos \\theta \\right).\\ ] ]    then , perturbation theory @xcite can be applied , and expanding @xmath77 up to the second - order in @xmath16 , it is straightforward to show that @xmath78 which is valid for the small-@xmath14 regime ( weakly correlated limit ) .    for large @xmath14 ( strongly correlated limit ) , the potential dominates the kinetic energy and the electrons tend to localize on the same side of the sphere , and oscillate around their equilibrium position ( zero - point oscillations ) .",
    "however , in coulombic systems , the localization takes place on opposite sides of the sphere ( formation of a wigner molecule @xcite ) , because of the repulsive nature of the coulombic interaction .    in this limit ,",
    "the hamiltonian becomes , for small oscillations ( @xmath79 ) : @xmath80               +    \\frac{\\omega^2}{2 } \\theta^2,\\ ] ] where we have used the taylor expansions : @xmath81 the corresponding ground state eigenfunction and eigenvalue of are @xmath82 the electrons are localized on the same side of the sphere , and oscillate around their equilibrium position with an angular frequency of @xmath38 .",
    "one notes that the electrons oscillate with the same angular frequency in both the moshinsky atom and @xmath1-hl - spherium ( see above ) .",
    "the first - order correction of the kinetic energy @xmath83 and the zeroth - order wave function yield the asymptotic expansion @xcite @xmath84 which shows that the next term of this expansion is different in the moshinsky atom and @xmath1-hl - spherium than their coulombic analogues .    for comparison , in @xmath1-spherium ( the coulombic analog of @xmath1-hl - spherium )",
    ", one can eventually show that the angular frequency is equal to @xmath85 , and the asymptotic expansion reads @xcite @xmath86 where the first term in represents the classical mechanical energy of two electrons sitting on opposite sides of a sphere of radius @xmath71 , and the third term is the first anharmonic correction .      using the ansatz @xmath88 eq . is recast as @xmath89 \\chi ( \\theta )         - \\omega^2 \\left(1 - \\cos \\theta \\right )",
