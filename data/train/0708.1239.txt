    "selfsimilarity is a very popular research topics since a few years , and it has been approached from many different standpoints producing an unavoidable level of confusion  @xcite . the present paper is devoted to a short summary of the properties of some important and well known families of laws : infinitely divisible , selfdecomposable and stable ( for details see for example  @xcite ) .",
    "first of all we will recall their role in the formulation and in the solutions of the central limit problem : as we will see in the next section this amounts to a quest for all the limit laws of sums of independent random variables .",
    "our families of distributions will then be analyzed by means of both their possible decompositions in other laws , and the explicit form of their characteristic functions : the celebrated lvy ",
    "khintchin formula .",
    "in particular it will be discussed the intermediate role played by the selfdecomposable laws between the more popular stable , and infinitely divisible distributions .",
    "we will then explore these laws in connection with the additive and the lvy processes , looking for their importance with respect to both the properties of stationarity and selfsimilarity .",
    "in particular it will be recalled how from selfdecomposable distributions it is always possible to define both stationary and selfsimilar additive processes which  with the exception of important particular cases  will in general be different .",
    "a few remarks are also added to show the differences between this selfsimilarity and that of the well known fractional brownian motion .",
    "we will also analyze the ornstein  uhlenbeck processes driven by these lvy noises , and their stationary distributions which are always selfdecomposable .",
    "we will finally elaborate a few examples to illustrate these results , and to compare the behavior of our processes .    in what follows",
    "we will adopt the following notations ( for details see for example  @xcite ) : @xmath0 will denote the random variables , namely the measurable functions @xmath1 defined on a probability space @xmath2 where @xmath3 is a sample space , @xmath4 is a @xmath5algebra of events and @xmath6 a probability measure .",
    "we will then respectively write @xmath7 for their cumulative distribution functions @xmath8 and @xmath9 for their characteristic functions @xmath10 where the symbol @xmath11 denotes the expectation value of a random variable  according to the probability @xmath6 , namely for example @xmath12 when they exist , @xmath13 will be the probability density functions , and in that event we will have @xmath14 a law will be indifferently specified either by its cumulative distribution function  ( or density function ) , or by its characteristic function .",
    "to say that a random variable  @xmath15 is distributed according to a given law we will also write either @xmath16 or @xmath17 ; if a family of laws is denoted by a specific symbol , say @xmath18 , then we also write @xmath19 to say that @xmath15 is distributed according to one of these laws .",
    "when two random variables @xmath15 and @xmath20 are identically distributed we will adopt the notation @xmath21 if a property is true with probability 1 we will also say that it is true @xmath6_almost surely _ and we will adopt the notation @xmath22  a _ type of laws _ ( see  @xcite section 14 ) is a family of laws that only differ by a centering and a rescaling : in other words , if @xmath23 is the characteristic function  of a law , all the laws of the same type have characteristic functions @xmath24 with a centering parameter @xmath25 , and a scaling parameter @xmath26 ( we exclude here the sign inversions ) . in terms of random variables",
    "this means that the laws of @xmath15 and @xmath27 ( for @xmath26 , and @xmath25 ) always are of the same type , and on the other hand that @xmath15 and @xmath20 belong to the same type if it is possible to find @xmath26 , and @xmath25 such that @xmath28 .",
    "we will also say that a random variable  @xmath17 and its law are _ composed _ of @xmath29 and @xmath30 when @xmath31 and @xmath32 are independent and @xmath33 , or equivalently when @xmath34 ; then @xmath31 and @xmath32 are also called _",
    "components _ of @xmath15 . of course",
    ", in terms of distributions , a composition amounts to a _",
    "convolution _ ; then , for example , if @xmath35 denotes a normal law with expectation @xmath36 and variance @xmath37 , the composition of two normal laws will also be indicated as @xmath38 . for the stochastic processes @xmath39 we will say that @xmath40 and @xmath41 are _ identical in law _ when the systems of their finite  dimensional distributions are identical , and in this case we will write @xmath42",
    "a process @xmath40 is said to be _ stochastically continuous _ if for every @xmath43 @xmath44 where @xmath45 denotes the probability for the increment @xmath46 of being larger that @xmath43 . in this paper",
    "all our random variables and processes will be one dimensional .",
    "in this exposition we do not pretend neither rigor , nor completeness : we just list the results and the properties that are important to compare , and we refer to the existing literature for proofs and details , and for a few hints about possible recent applications .",
    "in fact the aim of this paper is just to draw an outline showing  without embarrassing the reader with excessive technical details  the deep , but otherwise simple ideas which are behind the properties of our families of laws and the simplest procedures to build from them the most important classes of processes .",
    "we hope that this , with the aid of some telling examples , will be helpful to approach this field of research by clarifying the roles , the differences and the subtleties of these laws and processes .",
    "it is well known that there are three kinds of _ classical limit theorems _ ( all along this paper wherever we speak of convergence it is understood that we speak of _ convergence in law _ ) which are characterized by the form of the respective limit laws :    * the _ law of large numbers _ with limit laws of the degenerate type @xmath47 with characteristic function @xmath48 * the _ normal central limit theorem _ whose limit laws are of the gaussian type @xmath35 with @xmath49 * and the _ poisson theorem _ whose limit laws are of the poisson types @xmath50 with @xmath51    the exact statements of these theorems in their traditional formulations are reprinted in every handbook of probability ( see for example  @xcite p.  323 and",
    "following ) , and we will not reproduce them once more .",
    "remark however that in our list , while speaking of _ the type _ for the degenerate and the gaussian laws , we also referred to _ the types _ for the poisson laws .",
    "in fact all the normal laws @xmath35 with expectation @xmath25 and variance @xmath52 constitute a unique type , and the same is true for the family of all the degenerate laws . on the other hand the standard poisson laws @xmath53 with different parameters",
    "@xmath54 belong to different types : indeed we can not recover a law @xmath55 from another @xmath56 ( with @xmath57 ) just by means of a centering and a rescaling .",
    "in other words we could say that every poisson law @xmath55 with a given @xmath54 generates  by centering and rescaling  a distinct type @xmath50 with characteristic functions  ( [ poisschf ] ) .",
    "the particularities of the poisson laws with respect to the other two families of limit laws are also apparent from their properties of _ composition and decomposition_. for a family of laws ( not necessarily a type ) to be closed under composition means that the composition ( convolution ) of two laws of that family still belongs to the same family . on the other hand closure under decomposition",
    "means that if a law of the family is decomposed in two laws , these two components necessarily belong to the same family .",
    "the types of limit laws appearing in the classical limit theorems show an important form of closure under composition and decomposition summarized in the following result ( see  @xcite p.  283 ) : _ the degenerate and normal types are closed under compositions and under decompositions ; the same is true for every family of poisson laws @xmath50 with the same @xmath58 . _",
    "the closure under composition is in fact an elementary property ; not so for the closure under decomposition : the proofs for the normal and the poisson case were given in 1935 - 37 by h.  cramr and d.a.raikov respectively .",
    "the normal and poisson composition and decomposition properties can then be stated by saying that @xmath59 hence it is also apparent that a type of poisson laws never is closed under composition and decomposition : we are always obliged to switch from a poisson type to another while composing and decomposing them .",
    "it is important to remark , however , that the classical limit theorems are not the embodiment of these composition and decomposition properties only , but they are more far  reaching and profound statements .",
    "in fact not only these theorems deal with limits of sums of independent random variables of a type which in general is different from that of the eventual limit laws  the poisson law is the limit of sums of bernoulli 01 random variables , while the normal and degenerate laws are limits of sums of still more general random variables  but also the distribution of the sum of the @xmath60 random variables does not coincide with the limit law at every step @xmath60 of the limiting process , as happens instead in a simple decomposition .      to formulate the central limit problem ( _ clp _ )",
    "let us look at it first of all in terms of sequences of random variables : usually we take a sequence @xmath61 of random variables , and then the sequence of their sums @xmath62 . in this case",
    "when we go from @xmath63 to @xmath64 we just add another random variable  @xmath65 without changing the previous sum @xmath63 .",
    "however this is not the more general way to produce sequences of sums of random variables .",
    "consider indeed a triangular array of random variables @xmath66 @xmath67 with @xmath68 and @xmath69 , and suppose that    1 .   in every row",
    "@xmath70 the random variables @xmath71 are independent , 2 .",
    "the @xmath66 are _ uniformly , asymptotically negligible _ , namely that @xmath72    define now the _ consecutive sums _ @xmath73 then the central limit problem _ for consecutive sums of independent random variables _",
    "( _ clp_@xmath74 ) reads : _ _ find the family of all the limit laws of the consecutive sums _ _  ( [ consecsum ] ) _ and the corresponding convergence conditions _ ( see  @xcite p.301 - 2 ) .",
    "three remarks are in order here :    * for a given @xmath70 the random variables @xmath71 are independent , but in general they are neither identically distributed , nor of the same type ; * going from the row @xmath60 to the row @xmath75 the random variables and their laws change : in general @xmath66 and @xmath76 are neither identically distributed , nor of the same type ; as a consequence going from @xmath63 to @xmath64 we not only add the @xmath75-th random variable , but we also are obliged to adjourn the law of @xmath63 ; * the uniformly , asymptotically negligible  condition is an important technical requirement added to avoid trivial answers to the _ clp_@xmath74 ( see for example  @xcite p. 302 ) ; in fact without this condition it is easy to show that any law @xmath77 would be limit law of the consecutive sums  ( [ consecsum ] ) : it would be enough for every @xmath60 to take @xmath78 , and @xmath79 for @xmath80 .",
    "the uniformly , asymptotically negligible  condition will tacitly be assumed all along this paper .",
    "important particular cases of the _ clp_@xmath74 are then selected when we specialize the sequence @xmath66 in the following way ( see  @xcite p.  331 ) : let us suppose that there is a sequence @xmath61 , @xmath81 , of independent ( but in general not identically distributed ) random variables , and two sequences of numbers @xmath82 and @xmath83 , @xmath68 , such that for every @xmath84 and @xmath60 @xmath85 it is apparent that now going from @xmath60 to @xmath86 we just get a centering and a rescaling of every @xmath61 , so that @xmath66 and @xmath87 always are of the same type .",
    "then the consecutive sums take the form of _ normed sums _",
    "( namely centered and rescaled sums ) of independent random variables @xmath88 where we adopt the notation @xmath89 then the central limit problem  _ for normed sums of independent random variables _ ( _ clp_@xmath90 ) reads : _ _ find the family of all the limit laws of the normed sums _ _",
    "( [ normsum ] ) _ and the corresponding convergence conditions_. finally there is a still more specialized formulation of the central limit problem  when we add the hypothesis that the random variables @xmath61 are not only independent , but also identically distributed ( see  @xcite p.  338 ) : in this case we speak of a central limit problem  _ for normed sums of independent and identically distributed  random variables _ ( _ clp_@xmath91 ) .",
    "the answers to the different formulations of the central limit problem  need the definition of several important families of laws that are much more general than the gaussian type , and that can be defined by means of the properties of their characteristic functions .",
    "suppose that @xmath23 is the characteristic function  of a law : we will say that this law is _ infinitely divisible _",
    "( see  @xcite p.  308 ) if for every @xmath70 we can always find another characteristic function  @xmath92 such that @xmath93^n.\\ ] ] apparently the name comes from the fact that our law can always be decomposed in an arbitrary number of identical laws ; remark however that for different values of @xmath60 we get in general laws @xmath92 of different types . in terms of random variables",
    "if @xmath17 is infinitely divisible , then for every @xmath70 we can find @xmath60 independent and identically distributed  random variables @xmath94 all distributed as @xmath92 and such that @xmath95 namely @xmath15 is always decomposable ( in distribution ) in the sum of an arbitrary , finite number of independent and identically distributed  random variables . let us call @xmath96 the family of all the infinitely divisible  laws .",
    "many important distributions are infinitely divisible : degenerate , gaussian , poisson , compound poisson , geometric , student , gamma , exponential and laplace are infinitely divisible . on the other hand",
    "the uniform , beta and binomial laws are not infinitely divisible : in fact no distribution ( other than the degenerate ) with bounded support can be infinitely divisible(see  @xcite p.  31 ) .",
    "remark that if @xmath23 is an infinitely divisiblecharacteristic function , then also @xmath97 is an infinitely divisible  characteristic function  for every @xmath98 ( see  @xcite p.  35 ) : we will see that this is instrumental to connect the infinitely divisible  laws to the lvy processes .",
    "a second important family of laws selected by their decomposition properties is that of the _ selfdecomposable _ laws ( see  @xcite p.  334 ) : a law @xmath23 is selfdecomposable  when for every @xmath99 we can always find another characteristic function  @xmath100 such that @xmath101 in terms of random variables this means that if @xmath17 is selfdecomposable , then for every @xmath99 we can always find two independent random variables , @xmath102 and @xmath103 , such that @xmath104 in other words for every @xmath99 @xmath15 can always be decomposed into two independent random variables such that one of them is of the same type of @xmath15 . it can be shown that every selfdecomposable  law , along with all its components , is also infinitely divisible  ( see  @xcite p.  335 ) , so that if we call @xmath105 the family of all the selfdecomposable  laws , then @xmath106 .",
    "the gaussian , student , gamma , exponential and laplace laws are examples of selfdecomposable  laws ( see  @xcite p.  98 ) . on the other hand the poisson laws are not selfdecomposable : they only are infinitely divisible .",
    "finally we will say that a law @xmath23 is _ stable _ ( see  @xcite p.  338 ) if for every @xmath107 and @xmath108 we can find @xmath26 and @xmath25 such that @xmath109 this means now that if @xmath17 is stable , then for every @xmath107 and @xmath108 we can find two independent random variables @xmath110 and @xmath111 , and two number @xmath26 and @xmath36 such that @xmath112 in other words we can always decompose a stable  law in other laws which are of the same type as the initial one . our definition can also be reformulated in a slightly different way ( see  @xcite p.  69 ) : for every @xmath113 we can always find @xmath26 and @xmath25 such that @xmath114^c,\\ ] ] and this apparently means that for every @xmath113 the law @xmath115^c$ ] is of the same type as @xmath23 .",
    "a law is also said _ strictly stable _ if for every @xmath113 always exists @xmath26 such that @xmath116^c.\\ ] ] all the stable  laws are selfdecomposable , and hence if @xmath117 is the family of all the stable  laws we will have @xmath118 . in fact",
    "our classification of laws in only three families ( infinitely divisible , selfdecomposable  and stable ) is an oversimplification of a much richer structure explored for example in  @xcite , chapter 3 . among the classical laws",
    "only the gaussian and the cauchy laws are stable",
    ".    remark that if a law @xmath77 belongs to one of our families , then also all its type belongs to the same family .",
    "hence it would be more suitable to say that @xmath96 , @xmath105 and @xmath117 are families of types of laws ; however in the following , for the sake of simplicity , this will be understood without saying .",
    "the relevance of our three families of laws lies in the fact that they represent the answers to the three formulations of the central limit problem  discussed in the previous section .",
    "in fact it can be shown that @xmath119 _ and _ @xmath117 _ exactly coincide with the families of the limit laws sought for respectively in _ _",
    "clp_@xmath74 , _ clp_@xmath90_and _ _ clp_@xmath91 ( see for example  @xcite p.  321 , p.  335 and",
    "for the three statements ) . to summarize these results  a few examples will be shown in the section  [ exampleclt ]  we can then say that :    * the laws of the normed sums  ( [ normsum ] ) of sequences @xmath61 of independent and identically distributed random variables converge toward stable  laws ; in particular : when the @xmath61 have finite variance their normed sums converge  according to the classical theorem  to normal laws , while the non gaussian , stable distributions are limit laws only for sums of random variables with infinite variance ; a well known example of the non gaussian limit laws is the cauchy distribution ; * the laws of the normed sums  ( [ normsum ] ) of sequences @xmath61 of independent , but not necessarily identically distributed , random variables converge toward selfdecomposable laws ; the special case of the stable laws is recovered when the @xmath61 are also identically distributed ; in other words when a selfdecomposable  law is not stable  it can not be the limit law of normed sums of independent and identically distributed  random variables ; * finally the laws of the consecutive sums  ( [ consecsum ] ) of triangular arrays @xmath66 converge to infinitely divisible  laws : a classical example of non selfdecomposable  convergence is represented by the poisson limit theorem recalled in the section  [ classicalth ] ; of course the selfdecomposable  case is obtained when the triangular array has the form  ( [ specialseq ] ) and the consecutive sums become normed sums  ( [ normsum ] ) ; however infinitely divisible laws which are not selfdecomposable  ( as the poisson law ) can not be limit laws of normed sums of independent random variables .",
    "nothing forbids , of course , that in this scheme a gaussian law be also the limit law for consecutive sums of triangular arrays that do not reduces to normed sums . to complete the picture we will hence just recall here that there are also necessary and sufficient conditions for the convergence to normal laws of triangular arrays of independent , but not necessarily identically distributed , random variables with finite variances ( see  @xcite p.  326 ) .    since the stable  distributions are limit laws of normed sums  ( [ normsum ] ) of independent and identically distributed  random variables we can also introduce the notion of _ domain of attraction of a _",
    "stable  _ law _ @xmath120 : we will say that a law @xmath77 belongs to the domain of attraction of @xmath121 when we can find two sequences of numbers , @xmath82 and @xmath122 , such that the normed sums  ( [ normsum ] ) of a sequence @xmath61 of random variables _ all distributed as _",
    "@xmath77 , converge to @xmath121 .",
    "remark that this definition can not be immediately extended to the non stable  distributions which are not limit laws of normed sums of independent and identically distributed  random variables , so that we can not speak of a _ unique _",
    "distribution @xmath77 being attracted by the limit law .",
    "every law with finite variance belongs to the domain of attraction of the normal law ( see  @xcite p.  363 ) .",
    "it is also important to stress here that , while all stable  laws are attracted by themselves ( see  @xcite p.  363 ) , a non stable , infinitely divisible  law @xmath77  which always is in itself the limit law of a suitable consecutive sum  ( [ consecsum ] ) of some triangular array of random variables  also belongs to the domain of attraction of some stable law @xmath121 : normed sums  ( [ normsum ] ) of random variables _ all distributed as _",
    "@xmath77 will converge toward some stable law @xmath121 .",
    "for instance the poisson law  which is an infinitely divisible  limit law , as the poisson theorem shows ",
    "apparently also is in the domain of attraction of the normal law since it has a finite variance : a normed sum of random variables all distributed according to the same poisson law will converge to the gauss law .",
    "finally we recall , without going into more detail , that for a given law @xmath77 it is always possible to find if it belongs to some domain of attraction , and then it is also possible to find both the stable  limit law @xmath121 , and the admissible numerical sequences @xmath82 and @xmath122 entering in the normed sums  ( [ normsum ] ) converging to @xmath121 ( see  @xcite p.  364 ) .",
    "it is not easy to find out if a given law @xmath23 belongs to one of the families defined in the previous section just by looking at the definitions introduced up to now .",
    "it is important then to recall the explicit form of the characteristic functions of our families of laws given by the _ lvy ",
    "khintchin formula_. it can be proved ( see  @xcite p.  343 ) indeed that the _ logarithmic characteristic _ @xmath123 of an infinitely divisible  law is uniquely associated , through the formula @xmath124 to a _ generating triplet _",
    "@xmath125 where @xmath126 , and the _ lvy function _",
    "@xmath127 is defined on @xmath128 , is non decreasing on @xmath129 and @xmath130 , with @xmath131 and @xmath132 for @xmath133 finite .",
    "in other words a law will be infinitely divisible  if and only if its logarithmic characteristic  satisfies the relation  ( [ lkformula ] ) for a suitable choice of @xmath125 .",
    "the lvy function @xmath127 also defines the _ lvy measure _ ( for details see  @xcite section 8) @xmath134 for every measurable set @xmath135 of @xmath136 and @xmath137 , so that often we will refer to @xmath138 as the generating triplet .",
    "when the lvy measure @xmath139 is absolutely continuous we will also denote by @xmath140 its density .",
    "remark that the lvy  khintchin formula  ( [ lkformula ] ) can be given in a variety of equivalent versions ( see  @xcite p.  37 ) by suitably choosing the integrand functions , but we will not go into such details .    for a given law even the verification of the formula  ( [ lkformula ] ) is not in general an easy task . in the case of stable  laws , however , the lvy ",
    "khintchin formula is considerably simpler since it no longer explicitely involves integrals on the lvy measure .",
    "a stable  law is characterized by a parameter @xmath141 ( see  @xcite p.  76 ) and it is then also said @xmath142stable  ( @xmath142-stable ) : the case @xmath143 corresponds to the gaussian laws , and to a vanishing lvy measure . in the non gaussian @xmath142stable  cases ( @xmath144 ) on the other hand the lvy measure is not zero , it is absolutely continuous and we have ( see  @xcite p.  80 ) @xmath145 with @xmath146 and @xmath147 . finally in both cases",
    " gaussian and non gaussian  the logarithmic characteristic  must satisfy the following relation ( see  @xcite p.  86 ) @xmath148 where @xmath149 $ ] , @xmath150 , @xmath151 and @xmath152 .",
    "the gaussian case simply corresponds to @xmath143 .",
    "when the law is also symmetric the characteristic function  is real and the formula reduces itself to the quite elementary expression @xmath153    the form of the lvy  khintchin formula , or equivalently of the triplet @xmath125 , of the selfdecomposable  laws , on the other hand , is not so simple .",
    "they in fact play in some sense a sort of intermediate role between the generality of the infinitely divisible  laws and the special properties of the stable  laws .",
    "it can be proved indeed ( see  @xcite p.  95 ) that a law is selfdecomposable  if and only if its lvy measure is absolutely continuous and its density is @xmath154 where the function @xmath155 is non negative , is increasing on @xmath129 and is decreasing on @xmath130 . by the way this",
    "also show why a poisson law ( whose lvy measure is not absolutely continuous ) can not be selfdecomposable . as a consequence the lvy ",
    "khintchin formula  ( [ lkformula ] ) of the selfdecomposable  laws is more specialized than that of the general infinitely divisible  laws , but it still contains a non elementary integral part .",
    "an _ additive process _ @xmath40 is a stochastically continuous process with independent increments and @xmath156 ( namely the probability of not being zero vanishes ) ; on the other hand a _ lvy process _ is an additive process with the further requirement that the increments must be stationary ( for further details see  @xcite section 1 ) .",
    "the _ stationarity of the increments _ means that the law of @xmath157 does not depend on @xmath158 .",
    "processes with independent increments are also markov processes , and hence the entire family of their joint laws at an arbitrary , finite number of times can be deduced just from the one and the two  times distributions . in other words",
    "it is enough to know the laws of the increments to have the complete law of the process .",
    "this of course is a very good reason to be interested in markov , and in particular in additive processes , but it must be recalled here that there are also non markovian processes which can still be defined by means of very simple tools .",
    "an important example that will be briefly mentioned later is the _ fractional brownian motion _ which takes advantage of being a gaussian process to make up for its lack of markovianity .",
    "it is also important to recall here that  with the exception of gaussian processes ",
    "the additive processes trajectories can make jumps . this does not contradict their stochastic continuity because the jumping times are random , and hence , for every @xmath159 , the probability of a jump occurring exactly at @xmath159 is zero .      in the following the law of the process increment @xmath160",
    "will be given by means of its characteristic function  @xmath161 , so that the stationarity of the lvy processes simply entails that @xmath161 only depends on the difference @xmath162 : in this case we will use the shorthand , one  time notation @xmath163 . as for every markov process",
    "the laws of the increments of an additive process must satisfy the chapman ",
    "kolmogorov equations which for the characteristic functions are @xmath164 for lvy ( stationary ) processes these equations take the form @xmath165    there is now a very simple and intuitive procedure to build a lvy process : take the characteristic function  @xmath23 of a law and define @xmath166^{t / t}.\\ ] ] it is immediate to see that @xmath167 satisfies  ( [ chkstat ] ) , so that it can surely be taken as the characteristic function  of the stationary increments of a lvy process . here",
    "@xmath168 plays the role of a dimensional time constant ( a _ time scale _ ) introduced to have a dimensionless exponent . to have a consistent procedure ,",
    "however , we must be sure that when @xmath23 is a characteristic function , also @xmath167 in  ( [ stchf ] ) is a characteristic function  for every @xmath169 , but unfortunately this is simply not true for every characteristic function  @xmath23 .",
    "we are led hence to ask for what kind of characteristic functions  ( [ stchf ] ) is again a characteristic function . we know , on the other hand , that if @xmath77 is an infinitely divisible  characteristic function , then also @xmath170 with @xmath98 is a characteristic function , and an infinitely divisible  one too . in fact it is possible to show that  ( [ stchf ] ) is a characteristic function  if and only if @xmath23 is infinitely divisible . in other words",
    "there is a one - to - one relation between the class @xmath96 of the infinitely divisible  laws and that of the lvy processes ( see  @xcite section 7 ) .",
    "remark however that in general for a lvy process defined by  ( [ stchf ] ) the infinitely divisible  law of the increments at a generic time @xmath159 is neither @xmath23 , nor of the same type of @xmath23 . only at @xmath171",
    "the law is necessarily @xmath23 , while for @xmath172 it can be rather different and ",
    "but for few well known cases  its explicit cumulative distribution function  ( or density function ) could be quite difficult to find .",
    "on the other hand when @xmath23 is a stable  law it is easy to see from the very definition  ( [ stable ] ) of stability that at every time @xmath159 the law of the increments  ( [ stchf ] ) will always belong to the same type ( this is famously what happens for the gauss and cauchy laws ) . in this case",
    "we speak of a stable  process , and its evolution can be summarized just in the time dependence of the law parameters which will produce a trajectory inside a unique type . a different situation arises instead when @xmath23 only belongs to a family of infinitely divisible  laws closed under composition and decomposition . as we have already remarked",
    "these families do not in general constitute a type ( as the family of the poisson laws @xmath55 ) : if however they are closed under composition ( as are both the poisson and the compound poisson processes ) the law  ( [ stchf ] ) of the increment of the lvy process stays in the same family of laws all along an evolution which is described by the time dependence of the law parameters ; this however does not amount to the stability of the process since our family is not a single type .    since every lvy process is associated to an infinitely divisible  law @xmath173 , and since every infinitely divisible  law is associated to a generating triplet @xmath138 we will also speak of the logarithmic characteristic  @xmath174 and of the generating triplet @xmath138 of a lvy process . in this case",
    "however the lvy measure @xmath139 has also an important probabilistic meaning w.r.t .",
    "the lvy process ( see for example  @xcite pp.75 - 85 ) : _ for every borel set @xmath175 of @xmath176 , @xmath177 represents the expected number , per unit time , of ( non - zero ) jumps with size belonging to @xmath175_. it can also be proved that for every compact set a such that @xmath178 we have @xmath179 , namely the number of jumps per unit time of finite ( neither infinite , nor infinitesimal ) size is finite .",
    "remark however that this does not mean that @xmath139 is a finite measure on @xmath136 : in fact the function @xmath127 associated to @xmath139 can diverge in @xmath180 so that the process can have an infinite number of infinitesimal jumps in every compact @xmath181 $ ] . in this case , when @xmath182 , we speak of an _ infinite activity _ process , and the set of the jump times of every trajectory will be countably infinite and dense in @xmath183 $ ] . for the sake of simplicity we will not introduce here the important _ lvy  it decomposition _ of a lvy process into its continuous ( gaussian ) and jumping ( poisson ) parts :",
    "the readers are referred to  @xcite , section 3.4 for a synthetic treatment .      a process @xmath40 ( possibly neither additive , nor stationary ) is said to be _ selfsimilar _ when for every given @xmath26 we can find @xmath151 such that @xmath184 namely when every change @xmath58 in the time scale can be compensated _ in distribution _ by a corresponding change @xmath36 in the space scale . in terms of the increment characteristic functions",
    "this means that for every @xmath26 we must have a @xmath151 such that @xmath185 in fact it can be proved more about the form of this space  time compensation : given a selfsimilar process we can always find @xmath186 such that @xmath187 ( see  @xcite p.  73 ) .",
    "this number @xmath188 is called the _ exponent of the process _ or _",
    "hurst index _ , and we will also speak of @xmath188__selfsimilar _ _ processes . for further details about selfsimilar",
    ", additive processes see also  @xcite .",
    "since a lvy process is completely specified by  ( [ stchf ] ) as characteristic function  of its increments , then in this case the selfsimilarity means that for every @xmath26 it exists @xmath151 such that @xmath189^{at / t}=[\\varphi(bu)]^{t / t}.\\ ] ] from the definition  ( [ stable ] ) of the strictly stable  laws and from  ( [ statssim ] ) it is easy to understand then that the unique selfsimilar lvy processes must be strictly stable .",

    "this means that , insofar as the coefficient @xmath194 remains the same , we can change the space and time scales @xmath5 and @xmath168 ( namely we can change the units of measure ) without changing the wiener process distribution . more precisely than these simple remarks",
    ", it can be proved that _ a lvy process @xmath40 is selfsimilar if and only if it is strictly stable _  ( see  @xcite p.  71 ) .",
    "things are rather different , however , when we consider only additive ( not necessarily lvy ) processes , namely when we can also live without stationarity .",
    "now we must stick to the general selfsimilarity equation  ( [ ssim ] ) , and we must remark again that there is another simple , intuitive procedure producing additive ( but not necessarily stationary ) , selfsimilar processes : simply consider a characteristic function  @xmath23 , a real number @xmath186 and take @xmath195 it is now apparent that the characteristic functions of this family satisfy the equation  ( [ chk ] ) and are also selfsimilar according to the definition  ( [ ssim ] ) with the space  time scale compensation produced by @xmath196 .",
    "namely  ( [ ssimchf ] ) produces an @xmath188selfsimilar process .",
    "of course we must ask here the same question surfaced w.r.t .",
    "equation  ( [ stchf ] ) in the case of stationary processes : when can we be sure that the function defined by the ratio  ( [ ssimchf ] ) of two characteristic function  still is the bona fide characteristic function  of a law ? even in this case , however , the answer can be hinted to by looking at the definition  ( [ sdlaw ] ) of a selfdecomposable  characteristic function@xmath197 more precisely it can be proved that  ( [ ssimchf ] ) is a characteristic function  if and only if @xmath23 is selfdecomposable  ( see  @xcite p.  99 ) : this ultimately brings out the intimate relation connecting selfsimilarity and selfdecomposability .    since",
    "selfdecomposable  laws are also infinitely divisible  the previous remarks show that from a given selfdecomposable  @xmath23 we can always produce two different kinds of processes : a lvy process whose stationary increments follow the law  ( [ stchf ] ) ; and a family of additive , selfsimilar process ",
    "one for every value of @xmath186  whose ( possibly non stationary ) increments follow the law  ( [ ssimchf ] ) .",
    "all these processes generated from the same @xmath23 are in general different with one exception : when @xmath23 is an @xmath142stable  law the associated lvy process coincide with the @xmath188selfsimilar one with hurst index @xmath198 . in this last case indeed the characteristic functions  ( [ stchf ] ) and  ( [ ssimchf ] ) are identical ( to see it take for example the symmetric form  ( [ symmstable ] ) of a stable  characteristic function ) .",
    "remark also that the index of an @xmath142stable  law always satisfies @xmath141 ( @xmath143 for the gaussian law ) , and that this is coherent with the limitation @xmath199 for the hurst index of the stable , selfsimilar processes ( see  @xcite p.  75 ) . on the other hand , in every other case ( either non  stable , or @xmath142stable  with @xmath200 ) , from a selfdecomposable  law @xmath23",
    "we can always build a lvy , non selfsimilar process from  ( [ stchf ] ) , and a family of additive , selfsimilar processes with non stationary increments from  ( [ ssimchf ] ) .",
    "finally from a infinitely divisible , but not selfdecomposable  law we can only get a lvy process from  ( [ stchf ] ) , but no selfsimilarity is allowed . for more details about present interest of the selfdecomposabledistributions and selfsimilar processes in the applications",
    "see for instance  @xcite and  @xcite .",
    "remark that selfsimilarity is not tied to the dependence or independence of the increments : we have seen here that among independent increment processes we find both selfsimilar and non selfsimilar processes ; and on the other hand a process can be selfsimilar without showing independence of the increments .",
    "a celebrated example of this second case is the so called _ fractional brownian motion _ : this is a centered , gaussian , @xmath188selfsimilar ( for @xmath201 $ ] ) process @xmath202 with stationary increments , and covariance function @xmath203}=\\frac{|t|^{2h}+|s|^{2h}-|t - s|^{2h}}{2}\\,,\\qquad\\quad t , s>0.\\ ] ] it is apparent that this is nothing else than a generalization of the well known covariance function of the usual brownian motion @xmath204}=\\min(t , s)$ ] that is recovered when @xmath193 .",
    "since @xmath202 is centered and gaussian , this covariance function is all that is needed to define the process also if it is not markovian .",
    "in fact a fractional brownian motion coincides with the usual brownian motion ( and hence is markovian with independent increments ) only for @xmath193 , while for @xmath205 it is non  markovian , has correlated increments and for @xmath206 shows long  range dependence . in other words",
    "an @xmath188selfsimilar fractional brownian motion with @xmath205 is neither additive , nor markovian : in fact it is not even a semimartingale , and hence few results of stochastic calculus can be used . from another standpoint ( see  @xcite p.  230 ) we can say that the selfsimilarity can have different origins : it can stem either from the length of the distribution tails of independent increments , or from the correlation between short  tailed , gaussian increments , and the two effects can also be mixed . for more information about the fractional brownian motion see  @xcite and  @xcite      selfdecomposable laws appear also in another important context : they are the most general class of stationary distributions of _ processes of the ornstein  uhlenbeck type_. take a lvy process @xmath207 with generating triplet @xmath208 and logarithmic characteristic@xmath209 , and for @xmath151 consider the stochastic differential equation ( for simplicity we take @xmath210 ) @xmath211 whose exact meaning is rather in its integral form @xmath212 when @xmath207 is a wiener process the equation  ( [ ousde ] ) coincides with the stochastic differential equation  of an ordinary , gaussian ornstein  uhlenbeck  process",
    "; but the equation  ( [ ousde ] ) keeps the meaning of a well behaved stochastic differential equation  even if @xmath207 is a generic , non gaussian lvy process , and its solution @xmath213 will be called a process of the ornstein  uhlenbeck  type . of course to give a rigorous sense to this solution",
    "we should define our stochastic integrals for a generic lvy process @xmath207 : since all lvy processes are semimartingales ( see  @xcite p.  255 ) , this can certainly be done , but we will skip this point referring the reader to the existing literature ( see  @xcite and  @xcite , or  @xcite for an extensive treatment ) . we will rather shift our attention to the possible existence of _ stationary distributions _ for a process of the ornstein  uhlenbecktype .",
    "in fact it is possible to show ( see  @xcite p.  108 , and  @xcite",
    "p.  485 ) that if @xmath214 then the ornstein  uhlenbeck  process @xmath40 solution of  ( [ ousde ] ) has a stationary distribution @xmath173 which is selfdecomposable  with logarithmic characteristic@xmath215 and generating triplet @xmath216 where @xmath217 , @xmath218 , and ",

    "remark also that by the simple change of variable @xmath220 the relation  ( [ oulch1 ] ) takes the form @xmath221 which is well suited to the inverse problem of finding the lvy noise of an ornstein  uhlenbeck  process for a prescribed selfdecomposable  stationary distribution .",
    "we will consider now several families of distributions ( for further details see for example  @xcite and references quoted therein ) , all absolutely continuous , centered and symmetric , with a space scale parameter @xmath26 which will of course span the types since the centering parameters always vanish :    * the type of the normal laws @xmath222 with density function  and characteristic function@xmath223 and with variance @xmath37 ; * the types ( one for every @xmath98 ) of the variance  gamma laws @xmath224 with @xmath225 where @xmath226 are the modified bessel functions and @xmath227 is the euler gamma function  @xcite ; their variance @xmath228 is always finite ; * the types ( one for every @xmath98 ) of the student laws @xmath229 with density function  and characteristic function@xmath230 where @xmath231 is the euler beta function  @xcite .",

    "all the laws of our families are selfdecomposable  ( and hence infinitely divisible ) , but only @xmath222 and @xmath241 are types of @xmath142stabledistributions : more precisely @xmath222 laws are 2stable , and @xmath241 are 1stable .",
    "on the other hand the family @xmath224 is closed under convolution , while @xmath229 is not .",
    "of course this does not mean that the variance - gamma laws are stable  since @xmath224 is not a unique type , and a convolution will mix different types with different @xmath54 values .",

    "since the curves are exactly symmetric on the negative axis.,width=340 ]    examples of these three densities are plotted in figure  [ fig01 ] .      to give examples of consecutive sums converging to our laws let us first of all recall what happens in the case of the poisson laws @xmath55 .",
    "let @xmath254 represent the binomial laws for @xmath60 independent trials of verification of an event occurring with probability @xmath255 , and take the triangular array of bernoulli 01 random variables @xmath256 with @xmath257 and @xmath258 apparently they are uniformly , asymptotically negligible  because for @xmath259 we have @xmath260 it is very well known that the consecutive sums are binomial random variables , namely @xmath261 and that , according to the classical poisson theorem , the limit law of these @xmath63 is @xmath55 .",
    "remark that , since in passing from @xmath60 to @xmath86 the random variables @xmath66 change type , it will not be possible to put @xmath63 in the form of a normed sum as  ( [ normsum ] ) . the poisson laws , however , are also limit laws in a still legitimate , but rather trivial sense due to the composition properties of the family @xmath55 : take for instance a triangular array of poisson random variables @xmath262 with @xmath257 and @xmath258 which are again uniformly , asymptotically negligible  because for @xmath259 we have @xmath263 now  at variance with the previous example of the bernoulli triangular array  at every step @xmath60 we exactly have @xmath264 and hence , albeit in a trivial sense , the limit law again is @xmath55 .",

    "to see in what sense they are limit laws take an arbitrary sequence @xmath61 of centered , independent and identically distributed  random variables with finite variance @xmath265 and define the triangular array @xmath266 which always turns out to be uniformly , asymptotically negligible  because of the chebyshev inequality : @xmath267 the consecutive sums are now also normed sums of independent and identically distributed  random variables since @xmath268 and according to the classical , normal central limit theorem their limit law is @xmath269 .",
    "also in this case , however , it is possible to exploit the composition properties of the normal type to find another , more trivial form of the consecutive sums : take the sequence of normal independent and identically distributed  random variables @xmath270 and define the triangular array @xmath271 which again apparently is uniformly , asymptotically negligible .",
    "now the consecutive sums are also normed sums which  at variance with the previous example  are all normally distributed @xmath272 and hence , in a trivial sense , the limit law is @xmath269 . finally let us remark that , since the normal laws are infinitely divisible , nothing will forbid them to be also limit laws of consecutive sums of triangular arrays that _ do not _ reduce to normed sums of independent and identically distributedrandom variables .",
    "however we will not elaborate here examples in this sense .",
    "we have introduced the trivial forms of the consecutive sums in the case of the poisson and normal laws ( see also the remarks at the end of the section  [ classicalth ] ) only because in our other subsequent examples this will be the unique explicit form available for our @xmath63 .",
    "remark also that these trivial forms essentially derive from the fact that our laws are all infinitely divisible .",
    "in fact if @xmath77 is infinitely divisible , then also @xmath273 is a characteristic function , and of course @xmath274 for every @xmath60 . in general",

    "what is less trivial , however , is to give an explicit form to the cumulative distribution function  or density function  of the component laws @xmath275 : as the subsequent examples will show this can be easily done only when we deal with families of laws closed under composition and decomposition .",
    "let us consider first the cauchy laws introduced in the previous section  [ examplelaws ] : they are 1stable  and , by taking advantage of the fact that the family @xmath241 is closed under composition and decomposition , it will be easy to show how they are limit laws of suitable sums of random variables .",
    "take for instance a sequence of independent and identically distributed  cauchy random variables @xmath276 and define the triangular array @xmath277 . since now there is no variance to speak about , to show that this sequence is uniformly , asymptotically negligible  we can not use the chebyshev inequality .",

    "what forbids here the convergence to the normal law is the fact that the variance is not finite , so that the normal central limit theorem does not apply . at variance with the poisson and gaussian previous examples , however , we do not know non trivial forms of a cauchy limit theorem embodying the stability of the cauchy law . in other words we have neither explicit examples , nor general theorems characterizing the form of the normed sums of independent and identically distributed  random variables whose laws converge to @xmath241 , without being coincident with @xmath241 at every step @xmath60 of the limiting process .",
    "this last remark holds also in the case of the laplace selfdecomposable , but not stable  laws @xmath242 .",
    "in fact , since the @xmath224 family is closed under composition and decomposition , we can always take a triangular array @xmath281 for @xmath257 and @xmath68 , and remark first that they are uniformly , asymptotically negligible  by virtue of the chebyshev inequality ( the @xmath66 have finite variance @xmath282 ) , and then that for every @xmath60 @xmath283 so that the limit law trivially is @xmath242 .",
    "it must also be said that in this example the random variables of the triangular array change type with @xmath60 so that the corresponding consecutive sums @xmath63 can not be recast in the form of normed sums of independent random variables . since however the laplace laws are not only infinitely divisible , but also selfdecomposable  we would expect to find normed sums of independent ( albeit not identically distributed , because the laplace laws are not stable ) random variables whose laws converge to @xmath242 .",
    "unfortunately we do not have general theorems characterizing the needed sequences of independent random variables , and we can just show an example slightly more general than the previous one . take for instance the triangular array @xmath66 with laws @xmath284 and variances @xmath285 .",
    "they are uniformly , asymptotically negligible  because from the chebyshev inequality we have @xmath286 while , for a known property of the harmonic numbers , the consecutive sums are @xmath287 now the sums @xmath63 are not trivially distributed according to @xmath242 at every @xmath60 , but again they can not be put in the form of normed sums as they should since @xmath242 is selfdecomposable .",
    "finally similar remarks can be done for the selfdecomposable , but not stablestudent laws @xmath243 introduced in the section  [ examplelaws ] , but in this last case it is not even possible to give a simple form to the trivial consecutive sums because the student family @xmath288 is not closed under composition and decomposition . in other words",
    "if @xmath77 is the characteristic function  of a law @xmath243 we are sure that @xmath273 again is the characteristic function  of a infinitely divisible  law such that @xmath274 for every @xmath60 , but these component laws @xmath275 no longer belong to the @xmath288 family as happens for the variance  gamma family , and in fact the form for their density functionis rather complicated  @xcite .      since all the laws of our examples are infinitely divisible  we can use all of them to generate the corresponding lvy processes by using  ( [ stchf ] ) to give the law of the increments on a time interval of width @xmath159 . in particular we will explicitly do that for the laws @xmath222 , @xmath242 , @xmath241 and @xmath243 .",
    "we then get as stationary increment characteristic functions @xmath167 respectively @xmath289 it is then apparent that the laws of the increments for the @xmath142stable  wiener and cauchy processes are simply @xmath290 and @xmath291 , while for the laplace process the law of the increments is actually a laplace law only for @xmath171 , while in general it is a @xmath292 at other values of @xmath159 . for our student process , on the other hand , the situation is less simple because the student family is not closed under convolution , and the increment law no longer is in @xmath288 for @xmath172 . in this case",
    "it is not easy to find the actual distribution from its fourier transform @xmath167 , and only recently it has been suggested that the increments are distributed according to a mixture of other student laws ( for further details see  @xcite ) .",
    "the wiener and the cauchy processes are @xmath188selfsimilar with @xmath193 and @xmath293 respectively .",
    "this can also be seen by looking at the interplay between the two  spatial and temporal  scale parameters @xmath58 and @xmath168 .",
    "in fact in the wiener and cauchy processes these two scale parameters appear in two combinations  respectively @xmath294 and @xmath295  such that a change in the time units can always be compensated by a corresponding , suitable change in the space units ; as a consequence the distribution of the process is left unchanged by these twin scale changes .",
    "this , on the other hand , would not be possible in the laplace and student processes since @xmath58 and @xmath168 no longer appear in such combinations .    that notwithstanding we can achieve selfsimilarity in additive , non stationary processes produced by all our selfdecomposable  laws . from  ( [ ssimchf ] ) in fact we can give the characteristic function  @xmath161 of the increments in the interval @xmath296 $ ] for our four types of law .",
    "first of all from the normal type @xmath222 we get @xmath297 namely @xmath298 these laws define processes which coincide with the usual wiener process if and only if @xmath193 .",
    "for @xmath205 , on the other hand , our process is additive , @xmath188selfsimilar , and gaussian with non stationary increments , and hence does not even coincide with a fractional brownian motion which has stationary and correlated increments . in a similar way from the laws of the cauchy type @xmath241 we get @xmath299 and",
    "the process will coincide with the stationary ( lvy ) cauchy process when @xmath293 , while for @xmath300 we have an additive , @xmath188selfsimilar process with non stationary increments . from the laplace type @xmath242 on the other hand we obtain an @xmath188selfsimilar ( with @xmath186 ) , additive process when we take @xmath301                           \\frac{1}{1+a^2\\left(\\frac{t}{t}\\right)^{2h}u^2}\\,;\\ ] ] so",

    "uhlenbeck  lvy noises ( laplace and student ) an important role is played by the so called _ dilogarithm _ function  @xcite @xmath310 in fact a direct calculation of the integrals  ( [ oulch ] ) gives for the logarithmic characteristics @xmath174 @xmath311 from the characteristic functions @xmath173 we can also calculate the stationary variances as @xmath312 and we get @xmath313 and @xmath309 respectively in the laplace and in the student case .",
    "remark that  when they exist finite  the variances of the stationary distributions always are in the same relation with the variance of the law generating the noise : the stationary variance is the generating law variance divided by @xmath314 .",
    "the form of the corresponding density functions is not known analytically , but it can be assessed by numerically calculating the inverse fourier transforms of the characteristic functions : the results of these calculations for a couple of particular cases are shown in the figures  [ fig04 ] and  [ fig05 ] .    finally , since the types of laws analyzed in this section are all selfdecomposable , by reversing the previous procedure we can also add a few remarks about the ornstein  uhlenbeck  driving noises required to have @xmath222 , @xmath242 , @xmath241 and @xmath243 as stationary distributions . in fact we have already said that for our two @xmath142stable cases the stationary distributions are of the same type of the laws generating the driving noise , so that there is essentially nothing to add for the @xmath222 and @xmath241 stationary distributions . as for the other two cases on the other hand we will use the second equation  ( [ oulch ] ) to calculate the noise logarithmic characteristics @xmath209 :     generating the driving noise ( red lines ) . here @xmath315 so that both the variances ( that of the stationary distribution , and that of @xmath243 ) are equal to 1.,width=491 ]     generating the driving noise ( red lines ) . here @xmath315 so that both the variances ( that of the stationary distribution , and that of @xmath243 ) are equal to 1.,width=491 ]    @xmath316    in both cases however the characteristic functions can not be elementarily inverted so that we do not have an explicit expression for the increment density functions of the the lvy noises that produce these two stationary ornstein  uhlenbeckdistributions",
    ". we can only add a few remarks about the laplace case : here the characteristic function  @xmath173 does not vanish at the infinity since @xmath317 . as a consequence",
    "the lvy noise increment characteristic function  can be better written as @xmath191^t = e^{-2bta^2u^2/(1+a^2u^2)}=e^{-2bt}+(1-e^{-2bt})\\,\\frac{e^{2bt/(1+a^2u^2)}-1}{e^{2bt}-1}\\ ] ] so that the independent increments of an ornstein  uhlenbeck  process with the laplace type @xmath242 as stationary law are distributed according to a time ",
    "dependent mixture of two laws , one of which is degenerate in @xmath180 . as for the second law of this mixture",
    ", it has a density function  given by @xmath318 but this integration can not be analytically performed .",
    "since many years selfsimilarity is a fashionable subject of investigation , in areas ranging from fractals to long  range interactions in complex systems : to have an idea just ask for the papers with the word `` self similarity '' either in their title or in their abstract present on ` arxiv.org ` and you will find @xmath319 articles , and almost 200 of them only in the first six months of 2007 . on the other hand this is a subject that has been approached from many different standpoints producing an unavoidable level of confusion  @xcite , while in fact it would be better discussed by placing the reader in the perspective of the general theory of the infinitely divisible ( even non stable ) processes . in the field of mathematical finance",
    "the use of non stable lvy processes is widespread , and several families of selfdecomposable laws and processes have been intensively studied in recent years : see for example the case of the generalized hyperbolic family  @xcite , of the student family  @xcite , and of the variance gamma family  @xcite .",
    "considerable interest has also been elicited by the use of selfdecomposable laws in connection with the ornstein  uhlenbeck  processes  @xcite , in particular for the stochastic volatility modelling . however , while in econophysics some non stable lvy laws are recognized as possible candidates for a consistent modelling of the underlying processes  @xcite , they remain less popular in the field of statistical mechanics and only recently their use has been proposed in connection with applications to the technology of accelerator beams  @xcite    in this paper we have tried to elucidate just a few points in the framework of the theory of stochastic processes . in particular",
    "we focused our attention on the relation between on the one hand the selfsimilarity , and on the other the independence and the stationarity of the increments .",
    "this has led our inquiry toward the analysis of the laws of the process increments , and we have stressed the connection between the selfsimilarity of the process and the selfdecomposability of the increment laws .",
    "selfdecomposable laws naturally arise in the study of the central limit problem and of its solutions : in fact they are an intermediate ( and more elusive ) class of distributions between the more general infinitely divisible , and the more particular ( and more popular ) stable distributions .",
    "we found then that , in the case of selfdecomposable generating laws , both the stationarity of the increments and the selfsimilarity are always possible , but are not always present in the same process . on the other hand selfsimilarity can also be a property of ( non markovian ) processes with non independent increments as in the case of the fractional brownian motion .",
    "we finally stressed the connection between the selfdecomposability and the stationary laws of generalized ornstein ",
    "uhlenbeck  processes with non gaussian , lvy noises .",
    "all that has also be elucidated by means of a few particular examples , and some kind of application from physics to finance has also been pointed out .",
