    "heavy ion collisions is a very active field in particle physics . at present",
    "the maximal energy is reached at cern where lead ions are accelerated to an energy of 160 gev / c per nucleon .",
    "the next machine will be the rhic collider , expected to operate in 1999 , in which gold or lead ions will reach a c. of m. energy of @xmath0 200 gev .",
    "one decade later an energy of @xmath0 5.5 tev will be reached at cern - lhc .",
    "the aim of these programs it to produce and detect a new state of matter called quark matter ( qm ) or quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) . since ordinary matter",
    "is composed of quark and gluons it is natural to think that by heating and/or compressing it , a new phase of deconfined quarks and gluons can be reached .",
    "this idea is quite old and was first explored in the framework of the bag model .",
    "however , it only gained full credibility when lattice calculations showed that such a phase transition does occur in statistical qcd .",
    "5 truemm      in the case of a pure yang - mills theory ( i.e. qcd without quarks ) the phase transition is of first order and takes place at a critical temperature @xmath1 150 mev . in the big bang theory the same transition occurred , in the opposite direction ( i.e. from qgp to ordinary nuclear matter ) , when the universe was only a few microseconds old .",
    "schematically , the situation is as follows . for @xmath2",
    "one heats the system and the temperature increases whereas the ratio @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the energy density , remains constant . at @xmath5",
    "one can heat the system but the temperature does not increase ( only the latent heat does ) .",
    "finally , for @xmath6 the temperature increases again and @xmath7 remains constant .",
    "this new constant is much larger than the corresponding one for @xmath2 .",
    "this is due to the larger number of degrees of freedom of a qgp as compared to a pion gas . using the value of the new constant and the value of @xmath8 one finds that the phase transition takes place when the density of the system is an order of magnitude larger than that of ordinary nuclear matter .",
    "it is also found that there exists a restoration of chiral symmetry which takes place at the same temperature @xmath8 .",
    "when quarks are introduced , the calculations are more complicated and the order of the phase transition depends on the number of light quark flavors",
    ".    5 truemm      although qgp could be produced in the case of neutron stars we are interested here in its production in heavy ion collisions .",
    "the first remark is that , in this case , we are a priori very far from the conditions of thermodynamical equilibrium assumed in the lattice calculations in statistical qcd . however , as far as the energy density is concerned , it is plausible that values of the order required by theory ( i.e. 1 gev/@xmath9 ) can be reached in central @xmath10-@xmath10 collisions at present cern energies . in the bjorken scenario ,",
    "the energy density is given by    = [ dn / dy]_y^ * ~0 < e_t >  r_p_b^2  _ 0  , [ 1e ]    where @xmath11 is the number of secondaries per unit rapidity , @xmath12 is the average transverse energy per particle , and @xmath13 is the plasma formation time .",
    "this time is very poorly known and there is no clear consensus among experts in the field . using @xmath14 1 fm together with the experimental values of the other quantities in ( [ 1e ] ) ,",
    "one gets @xmath15 gev/@xmath9 .",
    "5 truemm      even if qgp is produced , the phenomenon is a transient one , and one has to find experimental signals of its formation .",
    "although some signals regarding the bulk properties of the production have been proposed in the past ( i.e. behavior of @xmath16 versus @xmath17 ) , it seems at present that the best signals correspond to rear events or to electromagnetic processes .",
    "i will only discuss here two of these signals  : strangeness enhancement , and @xmath18 suppression .",
    "due to chiral symmetry restoration it is expected that the ratio of strange over non - strange particles will increase due to a reduction of the production threshold in dense hadronic matter .    the suppression of @xmath18 production , proposed by matsui and satz , is a consequence of color screening in a plasma ( debye screening ) - similar to the screening of electric charge in an ordinary plasma .",
    "this screening produces a modification of the potential of the type    v(r ) = v_0(r ) ( - r / r_d(t ) ) [ 2e ]    where @xmath19 is the debye radius - which decreases when @xmath20 increases .",
    "when @xmath21 is smaller than the binding radius , the corresponding bound state can not exist .",
    "of course , at sufficiently high @xmath20 , there will be a transient melting of all hadrons .",
    "the interest of the @xmath18 ( as well as other charmonium and bottonium states ) is twofold .",
    "first , lattice qcd calculations show that the melting of @xmath18 occurs at temperatures @xmath22 only slightly above the critical temperature and , second , @xmath23 and @xmath24 being very rear will combine with light quarks to produce open charmed mesons and therefore , once melted , the @xmath18 will not be formed again .",
    "the two phenomena described above have been observed experimentally in a very clear way .",
    "indeed it has been found that the values of the ratios , , , , [ 3ea ] increase between @xmath25 or @xmath26 and central @xmath27 collisions .",
    "the na35 collaboration claims that there is no increase between @xmath25 and @xmath26 , but errors are still large .",
    "@xmath18 suppression has been observed by measuring the ratio @xmath18 over drell - yan ( dy ) .",
    "it is found that this ratio decreases continuously from @xmath25 to @xmath26 to @xmath27 collisions .",
    "furthermore , for a given @xmath27 system , the ratio decreases with increasing centrality .",
    "this effect is very strong in @xmath10-@xmath10 collisions ( see section 2.6 and fig . 8) .",
    "5 truemm      there are claims in the literature that strangeness enhancement and particularly the enhancement of multi - strange antibaryons indicates the formation of qgp .",
    "nevertheless , it has also been possible to explain these data in the framework of string models - at the cost of introducing some new ingredients such as string fusion and final state rescattering of secondaries ( see section 2.5 ) . likewise ,",
    "alternative explanations of the observed @xmath18 suppression have been proposed ( see 2.6 ) .    in the following",
    "i will briefly review an independent string model  : the dual parton model ( dpm ) and will discuss to what extent the above signals can be understood in this framework , what are the required modifications of the model and what these heavy ion experiments teach us regarding the mechanism of multiparticle production .    5 truemm",
    "the dual parton model ( dpm ) is a dynamical model aimed at describing the mechanism of multiparticle production in hadronic and nuclear collisions .",
    "a very similar model , the quark gluon string model ( qgsm ) has been introduced by the itep group .",
    "these models are based on the large-@xmath28 expansion of non - perturbative qcd .",
    "a comprehensive review can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite . a short description of the physical basis of the model and some of its applications to hadronic collisions can be found in @xcite . here",
    "i will concentrate on the generalization of the model to nuclear collisions , and , in particular , on the eventual modifications of the model required to explain the cern heavy ion data .      in @xmath25 collisions",
    "the main contribution consists in a color exchange producing two strings of type diquark quark ( see fig .",
    "the hadronic spectra of each string is obtained by a convolution of the momentum distribution and fragmentation functions of the constituents at the string ends . due to energy - momentum conservation ,",
    "the longitudinal momentum fractions of the constituents at the string ends in each hemisphere add up to unity .",
    "there are also more complicated configurations , corresponding to higher order terms in the large-@xmath28 expansion , involving 4 , 6 , @xmath29 etc strings , with sea quarks and antiquarks at their ends .",
    "these configurations correspond to multiple inelastic scattering in an @xmath30-matrix approach . in @xmath25 collisions , these higher order configurations give small contributions at moderate energies , but their contribution becomes increasingly important with increasing energy . in proton - nucleus and nucleus - nucleus collisions , these higher - order contributions are enhanced by trivial combinatorial factors ( proportional to @xmath31 in @xmath26 collisions ) .",
    "more precisely , in @xmath26 collisions the dominant graph , involving only one struck nucleon of @xmath32 and @xmath33 spectator nucleons , is the same two string diagram of fig .",
    "1 . a double inelastic collision , involving two struck nucleons of @xmath32 and @xmath34 spectators , corresponds to a four string graph as shown in fig . 2 , and so on .",
    "the weights of these contributions can not be computed in qcd and are taken from the glauber - gribov approach .",
    "one assumption of dpm , which is not motivated by the large-@xmath28 expansion , is that strings are independent and particles emitted in different strings are uncorrelated .",
    "this assumption works well in @xmath25 , @xmath26 and peripheral @xmath27 collisions .",
    "however , we shall see that for central @xmath27 collisions the cern data require the introduction of final state interaction of secondaries .",
    "apart from this assumption the model has a sound theoretical basis and has great predictive power .",
    "the latter is due to the fact that strings are universal . the momentum distribution and fragmentation functions , allowing to compute the properties of each individual string , are the same in all hadronic and nuclear collisions .",
    "moreover , the momentum distribution functions are determined from regge intercepts .",
    "for instance , that of a valence quark in a pion is given by    _",
    "q_v^(x_q_v ) x_q_v^-1/2  ( 1 - x_q_v ) ^-1/2   .",
    "[ 4ea ]    the behaviour for @xmath35 is the well known @xmath36 behaviour associated to an ordinary regge trajectory of intercept 1/2 .",
    "since @xmath37 , the behaviour for @xmath38 is the same as for @xmath39 , and therefore one has the symmetric behaviour ( [ 4ea ] ) . in this way",
    "the end point behaviour is under control .",
    "of course , we can multiply ( [ 4ea ] ) by a smooth function of @xmath40 .",
    "however , in view of the singular behaviour at the end points , this will have little influence on the numerical results .    for a valence quark in a proton , one has instead    _",
    "q_v^p(x ) x^-1/2 ( 1 - x)^1.5  .",
    "[ 3e ]    here the behaviour at @xmath41 is obtained by taking the diquark momentum fraction to zero .",
    "this behaviour is controlled by an exotic @xmath42 regge trajectory of intercept close to - 3/2 . as a consequence of ( [ 3e ] )",
    "the valence quark in a proton is slow in average whereas the diquark is fast @xmath43 .",
    "its fragmentation into a leading baryon accounts , in this way , for the leading particle effect ( see section 2.3 ) .    in the first applications of dpm",
    "there was no attempt to compute the fragmentation functions . only their universality was used .",
    "for instance in studying @xmath26 collisions , one can obtain the fragmentation function from a fit to @xmath25 data ( or the @xmath26 data for a given @xmath32 ) .",
    "the model then predicts both the @xmath32 dependence and the energy dependence .",
    "an important progress in the model happened when kaidalov showed @xcite that the fragmentation functions can also be determined to a large extent from regge arguments . in this way",
    "the model becomes very predictive and the spectra of different hadrons can be computed basically without free parameters - except absolute normalizations .    in order to illustrate this point ,",
    "i show in figs .",
    "3 and 4 the leading proton and leading @xmath44 @xmath45 distribution in @xmath25 collisions @xcite .",
    "the shape of the leading proton spectrum is practically fixed theoretically ( here we show only the non - diffractive part but the diffractive one can also be computed in a similar way @xcite ) . moreover ,",
    "the different shapes of the proton and @xmath44 distributions is entirely due to the difference between @xmath46 , which appears in the power of @xmath47 for the leading proton , and @xmath48 , which controls the @xmath49 behaviour of the @xmath44-distribution .",
    "likewise , the sharp decrease of @xmath50 and @xmath51 distributions , also shown in figs .",
    "3 and 4 , is entirely controlled by known regge intercepts @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the generalization of the model to nucleus - nucleus collisions is rather straightforward . for simplicity",
    "i consider here @xmath52 collisions . in the approximation of only two strings per nucleon - nucleon collision , the rapidity distribution of secondaries",
    "is given by    @xmath53\\ ] ] + 2 ( |n - |n_a )  n^q_s-|q_s(y )  .",
    "[ 4e ]    here @xmath54 are the rapidity distributions of the individual strings , @xmath55 is the average number of wounded nucleons of @xmath32 and @xmath56 is the average number of nucleon - nucleon collisions .",
    "both @xmath55 and @xmath56 can be computed in the glauber model .",
    "for instance for an average collision ( i.e. integrated over impact parameter ) , one has        note that the total number of strings is @xmath57 , i.e. two strings per inelastic nucleon - nucleon collision .",
    "the interpretation of ( [ 4e ] ) is obvious . with",
    "@xmath55 struck nucleons , we have at our disposal @xmath55 diquarks of projectile and target ( @xmath58 and @xmath59 , respectively ) and as many valence quarks .",
    "this accounts for the first term of ( [ 4e ] ) .",
    "the remaining strings  : @xmath60 have to be stretched by sea quarks and antiquarks , because the available valence constituents are all included in the first term  ; this accounts for the second term of ( [ 4e ] ) .",
    "of course we should combine the valence and sea constituents of the projectile with those of the target in all possible ways .",
    "however , for linear quantities such as multiplicities , each ordering gives practically the same result .",
    "we can see from ( [ 4e ] ) and ( [ 5e ] ) that , if all strings would have the same plateau height ( i.e. the same value of @xmath61 ) , the plateau height in an average @xmath52 collision would increase like @xmath62 . however , at present energies , the plateau height of the @xmath63-@xmath64 , strings is smaller than that of @xmath65-@xmath66 ones , and the first term of ( [ 4e ] ) dominates . at higher energies",
    "the contribution of the sea strings becomes increasingly important .",
    "therefore , in order to make predictions for rhic and lhc we have to introduce the multistring configurations in each nucleon - nucleon collision .",
    "if their average number is @xmath67 ( this number can be computed in a generalized eikonal model  ; one gets @xmath68 at @xmath69 and @xmath70 at @xmath71 tev ) the total number of strings is @xmath72 , and eq .",
    "( [ 4e ] ) is changed into    @xmath73 . + ( 2 |k - 2 )",
    "n^q_s-|q_s ] + ( |n - |n_a ) 2|k n^q_s-|q_s  .",
    "[ 6e ]    the predictions @xcite for average and central ( @xmath74 ) @xmath75 and @xmath10-@xmath10 collisions at rhic and lhc energies are given in table 1 .",
    ".the number of charged secondaries per unit rapidity at @xmath76 for average ( @xmath77 ) and central collision ( @xmath78 ) at rhic and lhc [ 6 ] .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      we turn next to @xmath18 suppression @xcite . for all @xmath26 and @xmath27 data @xcite",
    "involving a light projectile ( up to @xmath30 ) there is an alternative explanation to debye color screening proposed in @xcite .",
    "this explanation is based on the following mechanism @xcite . in the present experimental conditions the @xmath18",
    "is produced outside ( behind ) the nucleus .",
    "however , the @xmath80 pair is produced inside the nucleus and can interact with nucleons in its path through the nucleus .",
    "this interaction can modify its wave function in such a way that it has a vanishing projection into the @xmath18 bound state .",
    "a single absorptive cross - section , @xmath81 6.2 mb , allows to describe all data except the @xmath10 @xmath10 ones .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "the data @xcite for @xmath10 @xmath10 , also displayed in this figure , show clearly that nuclear absorption alone does not work .",
    "another `` conventional '' mechanism is the final state interaction of the @xmath18 bound state with other secondaries produced at comparable velocity ( co - movers ) producing open charm  :    + j / d + |d + [ 14e ]    this idea was introduced in the literature a long time ago @xcite .",
    "however , recent theoretical calculations have shown that the @xmath82 and @xmath83 cross - sections increase very slowly from threshold ( in contrast to @xmath84 which has a very rapid increase ) @xcite . therefore in the case of the @xmath18 the co - mover cross - section",
    "is expected to be very small ( not larger than 0.5 mb ) . because of that the idea of @xmath18 suppression via interaction with co - movers has been progressively abandoned .    in a recent paper @xcite we have shown that introducing the final state interaction ( [ 14e ] ) with a cross - section of 0.4 mb",
    ", one can explain the recent @xmath10 @xmath10 data .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "a similar result has been obtained independently in @xcite .",
    "one should note , however , that when introducing the interaction with co - movers one has to reduce the value of the cross - section for nuclear absorption . in this way",
    "the @xmath18 yield in @xmath26 collisions does not fall with increasing @xmath32 as steeply as the data seem to indicate ( the `` effective '' absorptive cross - section resulting from the combined effect of nuclear absorption and interaction with co - movers is 5 mb while experimental data require 6.2 @xmath85 0.7 mb ) .",
    "moreover the @xmath18 yield in @xmath86 falls somewhat faster than indicated by experiment . at present , however , the data are not precise enough to rule out such an explanation and further study is needed to distinguish it from a qgp scenario @xcite and/or other collective effects such as string percolation @xcite .",
    "there are , of course , many other interesting results obtained at cern which i have not mentioned . in particular bose - einstein correlation measurements ( interferometry ) indicate that the size of the interaction region is larger than the geometrical size of the colliding system . again , this requires the existence of final state interaction of secondaries .      as discussed in section 2.5 ,",
    "there are hints in the data in favor of string fusion , although there is no compelling evidence yet . nevertheless , it is interesting to examine its possible consequences in cosmic ray physics . in a recent paper",
    "the santiago group @xcite discusses two such consequences  : the rise of the average shower depth of maximum for cosmic rays in the energy range @xmath87 to @xmath88 ev and the possibility that string fusion acts as a hadronic accelerator .    when the energy increases , string fusion becomes more important and produces a decrease of the average multiplicity .",
    "taking a fixed chemical composition ( i.e. independent of energy ) , consisting of 90  @xmath89 of iron and 10  @xmath89 of protons , one gets an average multiplicity , which , in the range @xmath90 to @xmath88  ev , is identical to the one obtained without string fusion and a chemical composition of primaries changing with energy ( from 75  @xmath89 fe and 25  @xmath89 p at @xmath87 ev to 50  @xmath89 fe and 50  @xmath89 p at @xmath88 ev ) .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    ".    another interesting consequence of string fusion is that it produces secondaries outside the kinematical range of a nucleon - nucleon interaction .",
    "the authors can explain in this way the so - called cumulative effect .",
    "moreover , they claim that these two effects can change the profile of extensive air showers and in this way alter conclusions on the primary composition and energy . for example , provided their composition could be determined by an independent method , cosmic ray events with energies around 3.10@xmath91 ev would contain , in the presence of string fusion , particles with @xmath92 or 3 ( or more in the presence of string percolation @xcite ) , and would thus correspond to an energy for the primary upto @xmath93 times smaller than the one without string fusion .",
    "such a reduction in energy could make these events compatible with the cut - off due to the scattering of cosmic rays with the microwave background .",
    "the qgp search has gained full credibility with the lattice qcd results .",
    "experimental data are of very high quality but give only some hints of qgp formation . future data and especially future machines will be decisive in this search .    in the mean time",
    ", we have gained new insight in the dynamics of multiparticle production allowing to improve current models ( strong baryon stopping hinting at diquark breaking , string fusion with interesting consequences for cosmic ray physics and final state interaction of secondaries ) .",
