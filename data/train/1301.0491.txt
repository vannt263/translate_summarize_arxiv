    ", the torus must have a very large optical depth ( tens of magnitudes ) , thus serving as a natural reservoir of molecular gas .",
    "for example , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see their fig .",
    "4 ) propose that the torus is the source of the 2  emission - lines observed in ngc1068 .",
    "however , integral field unit ( ifu ) spectroscopy of this source shows that the molecular gas is distributed along the galaxy and is spatially correlated with a young stellar population ( 30 myr old , * ? ? ?",
    "observational evidence has confirmed that circumnuclear / nuclear starbursts can coexist in objects harbouring agns ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "thus , if star formation is taking place or occurred recently , the presence of molecular clouds associated with the star forming regions should leave spectral signatures that may contaminate the agn spectrum .",
    "therefore , whether the h@xmath2 lines observed in agns are directly associated with either the molecular dusty torus or the circumnuclear gas remains an open question .",
    "alternatively , the molecular gas may be directly associated with the agn , but distributed within the circumnuclear region .",
    "this later scenario is supported by the fact that the 2  gas is most probably arranged in a disc surrounding the nucleus @xcite . in this picture ,",
    "shocks by radio jets and x - ray heating are plausible excitation mechanisms for the 2  molecule @xcite .",
    "as shown by @xcite and @xcite in the study of 51 objects , mostly agns , molecular hydrogen is detected in almost all seyfert  2 ( sy  2 ) and in about 80% of the seyfert  1 ( sy  1 ) sources .",
    "interestingly , the four starburst galaxies in @xcite also show the presence of molecular hydrogen emission .",
    "however , these previous works have not included a statistically significant number of low - ionisation nuclear emission - line region ( liner ) and star forming galaxies ( sfgs ) .",
    "in fact , up to now , only a few investigations have included these type of sources ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "these classes deserve separate analyses , as it is expected that the active nucleus has very little influence on their emission - line spectrum .",
    "the 2  infrared emission lines may be produced by the radiative de - excitation following collisional excitation ( thermal process ) or uv ( 6 - 18 ev ) photon absorption ( non - thermal process ) .",
    "2  may also be formed in an excited state , after which de - excitation also leads to emission of ir lines .",
    "this mechanism is , however , not very important in a hot or strongly uv / x - ray irradiated gas ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) as agns",
    ". 2  ir emission can be significant in regions illuminated by uv photons @xcite or x - rays @xcite , as well as in shocks @xcite . in each case , a different emission - line spectrum is expected and , therefore , the relative intensities among the 2  emission - lines may be used to discriminate between the powering mechanisms ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , keeping in mind that multiple emitting regions and multiple mechanisms may simultaneously be present @xcite .",
    "@xcite carried out a pioneering study of the 2  excitation mechanisms in a sample of seyfert galaxies .",
    "the innovation of these investigations compared to previous ones @xcite is that their integrated spectra cover the inner 300  pc in most of the sample , minimizing the host galaxy contamination and maximizing the number of diagnostic lines observed .",
    "in addition , 2  and 2  emission - lines are usually suggested to form in the same region , and the evidence accumulated shows that forbidden iron emission in agns can have different sources , but very likely , all directly related to the central engine ( * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",

    "[ fluxflux]a ) , indicating that the x - ray heating is an important mechanism in the molecular gas excitation . for a more objective assessment of the x - ray heating in our data , we included model predictions to fig .",
    "[ fluxflux]a .",
    "it is clear that the explored parameter space overlaps the observed line ratios .",
    "in addition , the agns are better explained by @xmath15=1 and @xmath42=0.1 .",
    "it is also interesting that sy  1s require higher hydrogen gas densities than the other activity types , indicating that the molecular gas in sy  1s is denser .",
    "no correlation is observed for f@xmath86/pa@xmath1 , and , 2/pa@xmath1 and as for the diagram invloving 2/br@xmath0 no separation is observed between liners and seyferts ( fig .",
    "[ fluxflux ] ) .",
    "this result suggests that x - ray heating alone is not responsible for the observed sequence in fig .",
    "as shown by @xcite , high values of 2/pa@xmath1 line ratios can be explained by the dependence on the fe / o abundance .",
    "thus , the observed sequence in fig .",
    "[ diag ] may be a consequence of the amount of x - ray photons together with abundance effect ( i.e. in the case of liners powered by star - formation , sn explosions would eject enriched material to the interstellar medium ) .",
    "a detailed interpretation of the variation of these line ratios , from pure - starburst driven emission to liner nuclei , is non - trivial .",
    "a possible scenario is that the different line ratios reflect different excitation mechanisms , in the sense that they are able to describe a transition from an ionizing radiation powered by star formation to pure shock excitation driven by snrs @xcite . in such a case",
    ", the emission - line ratios observed in our liner sample would be a combination of processes , from x - ray heating to star - formation / evolution .",
    "since most liners have strong star formation ( tab .",
    "[ log ] ) , the stars could provide the required electromagnetic or mechanical power to produce the observed line strengths .",
    "however , to clearly investigate this issue , a 3d simulation of the emitting gas would be needed ( i.e. agn in the center + star - formation in a volume ) .",
    "it is also worth mentioning that , in the case of star formation , the underlying stellar population would significantly affect the atomic hydrogen emission - lines , thus affecting the observed line ratios @xcite .",

    "sfgs typically have lower 1 - 0 s(1)/br@xmath0 ratios than agns .",
    "this may indicate that the region that produces the 2  emission in agns is larger than in sbs , if we consider that agn spectra are harder than sfg s .",
    "harder ionisation spectra may produce a more extended semi - ionised region ( aleman & gruenwald 2004 , 2007 ) , which favours the formation and emission of 2 . in our models ,",

    "furthermore , denser and/or dustier models typically have higher ratios .",
    "a more detailed discussion on these models will be made in a forthcoming work ( aleman et al .",
    ", in preparation ) .",
    "we present nir spectroscopy ( 0.8   2.4 ) of seven sfgs and nine liners to discuss the distribution and excitation of the emitting 2  and 2  gas in emission - line galaxies .",
    "these data were analysed together with similar agn data of two previous publications @xcite .",
    "the whole data set constitutes the most complete and homogeneous sample of such kind of objects observed in the nir to date .",
    "our main conclusions are :    * 2  is common within the inner few hundred parsecs of emission - line galaxies , regardless of type .",
    "however , the molecular gas follows different kinematics than that of the ionised gas , suggesting that the two emissions are not co - spatial .",
    "for example , it is clear that the 2  lines are narrower than the forbidden lines , especially for [ s iii ] .",
    "this could be interpreted as if the latter is broadened by the gravitational influence of the smbh in the agns .",
    "furthermore , liners tend to have [ s iii ] significantly broader than 2  and 2  compared to sfgs .",
    "the fact that 2  fwhm is unresolved in almost all objects implies that the molecular gas is probably not gravitationally bound to the smbh but to the gravitational potential of the galaxy following a different kinematics than that of the classical nlr gas .",
    "in addition , ifu data and rotation curves derived for 2  and published by other authors for objects in common with our sample support this hypothesis and point to a scenario where 2  may be arranged in a disc - like structure on the galaxy plane .",
    "* we have computed new photoionisation models for clouds ionised by agn and stars , which provided fluxes of the 2 lines .",
    "we use a diagnostic diagram with 2  ir line ratios to study the excitation mechanisms of 2 .",
    "the thermal excitation plays an important role not only in agns , but also in sfg galaxies .",
    "this hypothesis is further supported by the similarity between the vibrational and rotational temperatures of 2  in some objects , and the tendency of @xmath72 to be higher than @xmath73 in others . in sfgs",
    ", the importance of the thermal excitation may be associated with the presence of snrs close to the region emitting 2  lines . * with our extended sample , of 65 objects ,",
    "we have confirmed that the diagram involving the line ratios 2  2.121/br@xmath0 and 2  1.257/pa@xmath1 is an efficient tool for separating emission - line objects according to their dominant degree of activity and should be useful for classifying objects with hidden agns or highly reddened objects .",
    "we also provide improved limits to the line ratio intervals for each activity type , as follows : ( i ) sfgs 2  1.257@xmath8m / pa@xmath82 0.6 and 2  2.121@xmath8m / br@xmath83 0.4 , ( ii ) agns 0.6 @xmath18 2  1.257@xmath8m / pa@xmath82 2 and 0.4 @xmath18 2  2.121@xmath8m / br@xmath83 6 , and ( iii ) liners 2  1.257@xmath8m / pa@xmath84 2 and 2  2.121@xmath8m / br@xmath85 6 , * a positive correlation is found in the diagnostic diagram involving the above ratios , interpreted as being a more likely an apparent correlation , since different mechanisms drive the production of either 2  or 2  according to the level of nuclear activity .",
    "it is not discarded that a combination of x - ray heating from the central source ( in agns ) plus shock heating ( radio jet and nlr gas interaction ) and/or snrs can simultaneously drive the emission of 2 , supporting this correlation in liners and sfgs .",
