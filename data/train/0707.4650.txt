    "the existence of trojan planets in extrasolar planetary systems ( eps ) is an interesting possibility .",
    "some related problems have been recently studied in several papers . in the solar system , more than 2000",
    "trojan asteroids have already been discovered .",
    "they move close to the orbit of jupiter , near the stable lagrangian points @xmath0 and @xmath1 , and are in 1:1 mean motion resonance with the giant planet .",
    "mars and neptun also have co - orbital asteroidal companions , and there are co - orbital moons around saturn as well .",
    "it can be expected that trojan - type objects also exist in epss .",
    "so far there have been discussions on trojan exoplanets .",
    "according to @xcite , two planets around a solar - mass star , with masses comparable to the mass of jupiter or saturn , can perform stable tadpole - type librations around the lagrangian points .",
    "pairs of saturn - mass planets can also execute horseshoe orbits around a solar - mass star , but this is not possible for jupiter - mass pairs .",
    "@xcite determined numerically the non - linear stability domain of the triangular lagrangian solutions in the general three - body problem as a function of the eccentricity of the orbits and the routh s mass parameter .",
    "this study indicates that there is a wide range of jupiter - size planetary masses and eccentricities for which such solutions could exist in epss .    as to the formation of trojan planets ,",
    "several mechanisms have been proposed , including accretion from protoplanetary disk @xcite and capture into 1:1 resonance due to rapid mass growth of the planet @xcite , or convergent migration of multiple protoplanets @xcite .",
    "@xcite studied the formation of terrestrial - like trojan planets from a swarm of planetesimals around the lagrangian point @xmath0 of a giant planet . for the formation of the trojan asteroids of jupiter and neptune ,",
    "see @xcite .",
    "trojan exoplanets could be detected in several ways , like radial velocity ( rv ) , astrometric , or transit photometry measurements .",
    "@xcite pointed out that a pair of comparable mass planets , both in tadpole and horseshoe orbits , would induce a characteristic pattern in the rv component of the central star that could be detected . reanalysing the rv measurements of the systems hd 128311 and hd 82943 , where two jupiter - like planets are beleived to be in a 2:1 resonance , @xcite demonstrated that it is possible to explain the variations of the rv of the hosting stars by a pair of trojan planets in 1:1 resonance . according to @xcite ,",
    "this is also possible for the system hd 73526 .",
    "however , in this case @xcite and @xcite found only a 2:1 resonance .",
    "@xcite developed a method for detecting trojan companions to extrasolar planets by combining rv and photometric observations of transiting exoplanets .",
    "this method offers the potential to detect even terrestrial - mass trojan planets using ground - based observations .",
    "most of the known exoplanets are gaseous giants orbiting quite close to their hosting stars .",
    "the search for terrestrial - like planets is the ambitious aim of several ongoing and future ground - based and space projects ( corot has been in orbit since 2006 december , kepler will be launched in 2008 , others are planned for the next decade ) .",
    "it is a question of considerable interest , whether earth - like planets exist in the habitable zone ( hz ) of some exoplanetary systems .",
    "if there is a giant planet in the hz of a system , the existence of another planet there is unprobable . however , as @xcite noted , terrestrial planets could exist near the stable lagrangian points @xmath0 or @xmath1 of a giant planet moving in the hz .",
    "@xcite studied this possibility in detail , investigating five exoplanetary systems ( hd 17051 , hd 28185 , hd 108874 , hd 177830 , and hd 27442 ) in which the only known giant planet moves in the hz . by using the model of the elliptic restricted three - body problem ( ertbp ) , they numerically determined the region around @xmath0 of each system where stable tadpole - type librations are possible .",
    "four other systems ( hd 150706 , hd 114783 , hd 20367 , and hd 23079 ) were also studied in which the orbit of the giant planet is partly outside the hz due to its large eccentricity .",
    "it has been shown that in all studied systems there is an extended stability region around @xmath0 , whose size depends on the mass ratio of the planet and the star and the orbital eccentricity of the giant planet .",
    "it is possible that trojan exoplanets of negligible mass exist in these systems .",
    "other dynamical studies @xcite also confirmed the possibility that small trojan planets can exist in stable orbits with moderate eccentricities in these systems .",
    "@xcite reconsidered the system hd 108874 , where a second giant planet was discovered @xcite outside the hz , perturbing strongly the inner planet .",
    "they showed by numerical integrations for @xmath2 yr that for most combinations of the orbital parameters , motions around @xmath0 are unstable .",
    "however , in some cases , terrestrial - like trojan planets can exist in a small domain of stability .",
    "hypothetical trojan planets in other multiple epss were also considered .",
    "@xcite showed that trojan planets with 0.1  10 earth - mass and with low eccentricities and inclinations could stay for @xmath2 yr at the triangular equilibrium points of the two massive planets of 47 uma . according to @xcite , trojan planets with 0.01  1 earth - mass",
    "can also exist at least for @xmath3 yr in the triple planetary system hd 69830 in 1:1 mean motion resonance with the outer massive planet d.    in this paper , we investigate how the size of the stability region around @xmath0 depends on the parameters of the problem .",
    "since in more than 90% of the epss discovered so far only one ( giant ) planet is known , we use a model of the three - body problem corresponding to a gravitational system of a star , a giant planet and a trojan planet .",
    "we study cases where the trojan planet has negligible mass and the orbit of the giant planet is elliptic ( ertbp ) , and also the trojan planet can have finite mass and then we assume that the orbit of the giant planet is a perturbed ellipse .",
    "we determine the size of the stability region around @xmath0 depending on the mass of the giant planet ( with respect to the mass of the star ) or the masses of both planets and on the ( initial ) orbital eccentricity of the giant planet . for the sake of simplicity , here we only study coplanar orbits of the planets .",
    "to determine the size of the stability region around @xmath0 , we have to establish the dynamical character of orbits in the neighbourhood of this point . in the model of the ertbp , for this we used the lyapunov characteristic indicators ( lci ) @xcite , computed for @xmath4 periods of the giant planet . during the numerical integration",
    ", we also checked the maximum eccentricity of the trojan planet as another tool of dynamical characterization of orbits @xcite .",
    "we used dimensionless quantities with properly selected units .",
    "the sum of the masses of the star ( @xmath5 ) and the giant planet ( @xmath6 ) was taken as unit mass .",
    "then the mass of the star and the giant planet is @xmath7 and @xmath8 , respectively , where @xmath9 is the mass parameter .",
    "the semi - major axis @xmath10 of the orbit of the giant planet was taken as unit distance .",
    "we computed maps of dynamical stability depending on two parameters , @xmath8 and the eccentricity @xmath11 of the orbit of the giant planet , that were changed in specific intervals .",
    "we changed @xmath8 between @xmath12 and @xmath13 in steps of @xmath14 .",
    "( with a one solar - mass star this corresponds to a giant planet with about 0.5  15 jupiter - mass . )",
    "the eccentricity @xmath11 was changed between 0 and 0.6 in steps of @xmath15 . for each possible pair of @xmath8 and @xmath11 , we computed a stability map showing the stable and unstable regions aroud @xmath0 in the parameter plane ( @xmath16 ) , where @xmath17 is the semi - major axis of the orbit of the trojan planet and @xmath18 is the synodic longitude , @xmath19 and @xmath20 being the mean orbital longitude of the trojan and the giant planet , respectively .     and @xmath1 for @xmath21 and @xmath22",
    ". there can be temporary stable horseshoe orbits outside the main stability regions where orbits have librational character . ]    to obtain a stability map , we changed @xmath17 between 0.9 and 1.1 in steps of @xmath23 , and @xmath19 between @xmath24 and @xmath25 in steps of @xmath26 , taking the direction of the pericenter of the giant planet as starting point .",
    "the other initial conditions were : @xmath27 , @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is the eccentricity of the orbit of the trojan planet .",
    "at each point of the ( @xmath30 ) plane , with the given initial data we computed the value of the lci for the resulting orbit and represented its logarithm on a colour - coded scale . in what follows we discuss the main characteristics of the computed maps .",
    "some representatives of them are shown in figs 13 .",
    "light regions correspond to stable orbits ( at least for the investigated time interval ) .",
    "the dark background corresponds to escape or collision orbits with the giant planet .",
    "computations of the maximum eccentricity show that in such cases the eccentricity of the trojan planet grows above 0.3 .",
    "1 shows the stability regions around @xmath0 and @xmath1 for @xmath21 ( circular restricted three - body problem ) and @xmath22 . to compute this figure , we additionally changed @xmath19 between @xmath25 and @xmath31 . in the two main stability regions orbits have librational character . outside the main stability regions",
    "there can be temporary stable horseshoe orbits .",
    "increasing the mass of the giant planet , the stability region becomes shorter in the synodic longitude and wider in the semi - major axis . in the bottom panel of fig .",
    "2 , obtained for @xmath21 , @xmath32 , a ring structure appears near the edge of the stability region , corresponding to a high order resonance between the short and long period components of librational motions around @xmath0 . outside the main stability region ,",
    "a chain of small islands can be seen , originating from the disruption of a former ring , due to the increase of the mass and increasing perturbations of the giant planet .     for @xmath21 and @xmath32 ( bottom panel ) , @xmath33 ( middle panel ) , and @xmath34 ( top panel ) .",

    "however , the comparison of the middle and top panels of fig .",
    "2 shows the opposite . in the former case ( @xmath21 , @xmath33 ) , the stability region is smaller than in the latter for larger @xmath8 ( @xmath21 , @xmath34 )",
    "this is one result of our computations : with the increase of the mass of the giant planet , the size of the stability region around @xmath0 does not decrease uniformly , smaller and larger regions alternate along the overall decreasing tendency .",
    "this phenomenon can be also seen in the ertbp .",
    "3 shows for @xmath35 the stability region for increasing values of @xmath8 .",
    "its size is decreasing as @xmath8 takes increasing values ( bottom and middle panels ) , and it is larger again for a higher value of @xmath8 .     for @xmath35 and @xmath32 ( bottom panel ) , @xmath34 ( middle panel ) , and @xmath36 ( top panel).,title=\"fig : \" ]   for @xmath35 and @xmath32 ( bottom panel ) , @xmath34 ( middle panel ) , and @xmath36 ( top panel).,title=\"fig : \" ]   for @xmath35 and @xmath32 ( bottom panel ) , @xmath34 ( middle panel ) , and @xmath36 ( top panel).,title=\"fig : \" ]    studying the computed stability maps ( not shown here )",
    ", we can arrive at a similar conclusion : when we fix @xmath8 and change @xmath11 , with the increase of the eccentricity the decrease of the size of the stability region is not uniform .",
    "we also studied cases when the trojan planet had non - negligible mass . because of the larger complexity of the problem , in such cases we used the efficient method of the relative lyapunov indicators ( rli ) @xcite to determine the dynamical character of orbits around @xmath0 .",
    "we computed stability maps on the ( @xmath17 , @xmath18 ) plane by considering several values for the mass of the trojan planet , corresponding to @xmath37 , 10 , and 100 earth - mass ( @xmath38 ) and 1  jupiter - mass ( @xmath39 ) , and for the mass of the giant planet , corresponding to @xmath40 , assuming that the planets move around a solar - mass star . for the initial eccentricity of the giant planet",
    ", values were taken from the interval @xmath41 in steps of 0.05 .",
    "the other initial conditions were as before .",
    "the results of our computations show that the extension of the stability region do not change much under the effect of the mass of the trojan planet . even for @xmath42 , the stability regions look like in fig .",
    "3 ( for the corresponding values of @xmath6 and initial @xmath11 ) .    we determined the stability regions around @xmath0 for the posssible combinations of the values of @xmath43 , @xmath6 and @xmath11 taken from the previously mentioned sets .",
    "the results show that for a given pair of @xmath6 and @xmath11 , the size of the stability region does not change much with the increase of @xmath43 .",
    "the changes are larger when @xmath43 is fixed , and either @xmath6 or @xmath11 is changed while the other is kept constant .",
    "the non - uniform decrease of the size of the stability region is observed in such cases as well .",
    "the computations confirm the existence of a stability region around @xmath0 even for @xmath44 , when the giant planet is of several jupiter - masses and its orbit is very eccentric . as an example , fig .",
    "4 shows the stability region for @xmath45 , @xmath46 , and @xmath47 .",
    "increasing @xmath6 at this value of @xmath43 and @xmath11 , the size of the stability region decreases reaching a minimum at @xmath48 , after which it is larger again for @xmath49 , as the computations show .",

    "an explanation for the second property needs a more thorough study , since though we considered many values of @xmath8 and @xmath11 , however , the applied resolution is not enough to get a satisfactory description of how the size of the stability region depends on these parameters .",
    "in the next section , therefore , we determine the distribution of the size of the stability region in a simplified model with high resolution as the function of @xmath8 and @xmath11 .",
    "this will enable us to study the fine structure of the size distribution of the stability region .",
    "the extension of the stability region around the lagrangian points @xmath0 and @xmath1 is an old problem of celestial mechanics that was studied in different contexts by many authors .",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    in the model of the ertbp ,",
    "the stability of the point @xmath0 depends on the mass parameter @xmath8 and the orbital eccentricity of the primaries which from now on we denote by @xmath29 .",
    "the stability of orbits around @xmath0 also depends on these parameters .",
    "non - linear stability of orbits around @xmath0 was studied by @xcite for the mass parameter of the earth  moon system and for a few values of the eccentricity .",
    "@xcite investigated the size of the stability region around @xmath0 by computing the number of stable orbits for a wide range of the values of @xmath8 and @xmath29 .",
    "the most detailed survey on the size distribution of the stability region around @xmath0 depending on @xmath8 and @xmath29 was given by @xcite .",
    "here we reconsider the problem by using a much higher resolution in @xmath8 and @xmath29 than in previous works .",
    "5(a ) shows the size distribution of the stability region around @xmath0 in the ertbp depending on the mass parameter @xmath8 and eccentricity @xmath29 .",
    "note , that here and from now on @xmath8 has slightly different meaning than in section 2 . in order that we could compare our results with earlier works",
    ", we changed the system so that now the larger primary ( the star ) has a mass 1 and the smaller primary ( the giant planet ) has mass @xmath8 ( thus their total mass is @xmath53 , instead of 1 ) .",
    "the test planet ( the trojan planet ) has negligible mass .",
    "5(a ) was obtained as follows . for a given pair of the values of @xmath8 and @xmath29",
    ", we placed the test planet in the point @xmath0 , and moving it outwards along the line connecting @xmath0 and the larger primary , we checked by numerical integration for @xmath54 periods of the primaries the stability of the orbits , originating from consequtive points of this line with zero initial velocity with respect to the primaries .",
    "we defined stability in the simplest way : an orbit around @xmath0 was considered stable if it did not cross the line of the primaries .",
    "the reason for this definition was that when a crossing happens the orbit loses its librational character and we were interested in tadpole - type librations as possible orbits for trojan planets .",
    "for any pair of @xmath8 and @xmath29 , we determined the largest distance from @xmath0 , denoted by @xmath55 , along the line of @xmath0 and the larger primary , until the orbit of the test planet starting from points of this line remains stable in the above sense .",
    "certainly , the time interval in stability investigations is crucial .",
    "we know that the extension of the stability region around @xmath0 shrink with time @xcite .",
    "we took @xmath54 periods of the primaries for our stability investigations as a compromise .",
    "the general features of the size distribution of the stability region around @xmath0 as the function of @xmath8 and @xmath29 appear reliably during this time . on the other hand ,",
    "the high resolution computations could be performed in a reasonable time .",
    "changing @xmath8 and @xmath29 on a fine grid ( @xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath58 , @xmath59 ) , we determined for each pair of @xmath8 and @xmath29 the limit value @xmath55 ( in the fraction of the initial distance of the primaries ) corresponding to the largest stable librational orbit .",
    "the distance @xmath55 can be thought as the approximate half thickness of the stability region described by the largest stable librational orbit .",
    "5(a ) shows the distribution of @xmath55 as the function of @xmath8 and @xmath29 , that is the size distribution of the stability region around @xmath0 as the function of the parameters . for the sake of better visualization , instead of @xmath55 the values of 1/log(@xmath55 )",
    "are plotted in fig .",
    "the light region above the v - shaped boundary curve and on the right of the figure corresponds to instability , even the point @xmath0 is unstable for such values of @xmath8 and @xmath29 .",
    "this boundary curve is well known from stability investigations of the point @xmath0 in the ertbp @xcite .",
    "the point @xmath0 is stable and libration around @xmath0 is possible only below this curve . the novelty of fig .",
    "5(a ) is , that in the region where @xmath0 can be stable , it indicates the size of the stable librational region around @xmath0 . according to the colour code , darker domains",
    "correspond to more extended stability regions .    as can be seen from fig .",
    "5(a ) , the size distribution of the stability region has a very complex structure .",
    "the size of the stability region is the largest when both @xmath8 and @xmath29 are small ( @xmath60 , @xmath61 ) .",
    "the fine structure of the figure confirms our previous finding that the size of the stability region changes non - uniformly either fixing @xmath29 and varying @xmath8 , or vice versa .",
    "it can be seen that there is also an extended stability region for small values of the eccentricity @xmath62 between @xmath63 .",
    "the dominant features of fig .",
    "5(a ) are the dark and light stripes , forming up finger - like structures on the left of the figure .",
    "one might suspect that the light stripes , indicating less extended stability regions , are related to resonances between the frequencies of librational motions . in the next section",
    ", we consider this possibility and see how resonances of librational motions around @xmath0 in the ertbp can be determined .",
    "we also computed the size distribution of the stability region around @xmath0 by giving masses to the trojan planet and we found that the structure shown in fig .",
    "5(a ) remains even for a trojan planet as large as 1 jupiter - mass .",
    "the only difference is that with the increase of the mass of the trojan planet , the stripes of the figure are slightly shifted toward the direction of lower mass parameters .",
    "also , there is only a slight difference in the size distributions corresponding to pericentric or apocentric ( as in fig .",
    "5a ) initial positions of the primaries .",
    "thus the structure of fig .",
    "5(a ) seems to be quite general .",
    "in the circular restricted three - body problem , motions around @xmath0 has two frequencies , @xmath64 and @xmath65 , corresponding to the short and long period components of libration . in the ertbp , however , the point @xmath0 has an elliptic motion itself , similar to the elliptic motion of the primaries , and a corresponding mean motion @xmath66 .",
    "this frequency combines with the frequencies of the short and long period librations , and thus motions around @xmath0 have four frequencies ( and linear combinations of them ) which for @xmath67 approach the limit values @xmath64 , @xmath68 , @xmath65 , and @xmath69 .",
    "taking @xmath66 as unit frequency , the normalized frequencies @xmath64 and @xmath65 are given by @xcite : @xmath70 where @xmath71 the frequencies @xmath64 and @xmath65 are real until @xmath72 , and when the equality is held , @xmath73 is a double root .",
    "( note that values of @xmath8 of this section can be simply transformed to the system , where the primaries have masses @xmath7 and @xmath8 , dividing them by @xmath53 .",
    "this results in the familiar @xmath74 value for the critical mass parameter . )    the normalized frequencies @xmath64 , @xmath75 , @xmath65 , and @xmath76 are given as the function of the mass parameter @xmath8 in fig .",

    "noting , that the frequencies change along a resonant curve , it is convenient to denote by @xmath104 the frequency whose limit frequency is @xmath75 .",
    "then the three frequencies at the crossing point of the three resonant curves are : @xmath105 , @xmath106 , @xmath107 .",
    "indeed , @xmath108 , @xmath109 , and @xmath110 .",
    "there is also a laplace - type relation between the three frequencies : @xmath111 .",
    "computations show that the size of the stability region around @xmath0 for the @xmath112 and @xmath113 value of the cross point is very reduced , it is less than @xmath114 in synodic longitude .",
    "the starting points of the b31 and b21 resonant curves are at @xmath115 and @xmath116 , corresponding to 0.013516016 and 0.024293897 in the usual mass parameter system .",
    "these are the values for which @xcite showed the non - linear instability of @xmath0 in the circular restriced three - body problem .",
    "interestingly , as can be seen from fig .",
    "5 , along the a21 resonant curve the size of the stability region around @xmath0 seems less extended than along the nearby b 3:1 resonance , though @xmath0 is non - linearly stable at its @xmath28 starting point .    on the right of the figure ,",
    "the most prominent minimum zone is connected with the b 4:3 resonance .",
    "interestingly , this zone begins at @xmath117 and not at @xmath28 .",
    "it is worth to compare fig .",
    "5(a ) with the results described in section 2 concerning the maps of dynamical stability . for each pair of the mass parameter and the giant planet s eccentricity , we computed the lci for about @xmath118 orbits by changing the semi - major axis and the orbital longitude of the trojan planet . from this",
    "we can calculate the ratio of the number of stable orbits with respect to all the investigated orbits .",
    "this ratio can be assigned to each pair of @xmath8 and @xmath29 , and in this way a map can be obtained showing the ratio of stable orbits .",
    "the results are shown in fig . 7",
    "( note that we extended the computations of section 2 up to @xmath119 ) . though the resolution of this figure is much less than in fig .",
    "5(a ) ( and the mass parameters are slightly different ) , still the basic structure is similar .",
    "the minimum zones , identified in fig .",
    "5(b ) as the a 2:1 , a 3:1 and a 4:1 resonances , appear also in fig .",
    "the zone of the a 2:1 resonance at @xmath120 indicates an especially sharp minimum .",
    "7 also comfirms the more probable occurance of stable orbits around @xmath0 for small values of the mass parameter and the eccentricity .",
    "we note that fig .",
    "7 is in good agreement with fig .",
    "6 of @xcite obtained by the method of the rli .",
    "in studying the possibility of trojan exoplanets , the size of the stability region around the lagrangian points @xmath0 and @xmath1 is crucial .",
    "we determined the size distribution of the stability region around @xmath0 in the elliptic restricted three - body problem depending on the mass parameter and the eccentricity .",
    "the size distribution has a fine structure with several minimum zones .",
    "we have shown that these minimum zones are connected with resonances between the frequencies of librational motions around @xmath0 .",
    "the situation is analogous to the kirkwood gaps at mean motion resonances in the distribution of the main belt asteroids of the solar system .    one main minimum zone ,",
    "the region of the a 2:1 resonance is situated around @xmath121 , which corresponds to a celestial body of about 15 jupiter - mass around a solar - mass star .",
    "this could be called brown dwarf limit in the sense that it is not probable that brown dwarfs of this size can possess trojan companions due to the reduded size of the stability region . however , the stable region above the brown dwarf limit in fig .",
    "5 suggests the possibility of trojan planets accompanied to larger objects .",
    "the regions of the higher order a 5:1 , a 4:1 , and a 3:1 resonances also indicate mass parameter values ( 0.004 , 0.006 , 0.009 ) and correspondig eccentricities for which single planet exoplanetary systems hardly can have trojan planets .",
    "circumstances are most favorable for trojan planets to exist , when both the mass parameter and the giant s planet eccentricity are small .",
    "however , higher order resonances may also affect this region .",
