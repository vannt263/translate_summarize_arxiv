    "in a recent paper , the author has developed a first - principles multiband envelope - function theory for semiconductor heterostructures .",
    "@xcite this theory can in principle provide accurate numerical predictions of envelope - function hamiltonian parameters , but only if a reliable quasiparticle self - energy is used as input . on the other hand ,",
    "if the input potential is taken from a simple density - functional calculation , @xcite the numerical values are less accurate , but the theory can still provide deep insight into the basic physics of the interface and clarify various limitations of commonly used envelope - function models .",
    "the purpose of the present article is to explore these topics using numerical examples taken from density - functional calculations of the valence subband structure in semiconductor superlattices .    in order to obtain the most direct comparison with envelope - function theory as it is commonly used ,",
    "the hamiltonian was derived in ref . in the form of a matrix containing differential operators and energy - independent functions of position . using a differential equation of low order to describe",
    "an abrupt heterojunction might seem at first glance to be a gross theoretical blunder , since it is well known that bulk effective - mass theory @xcite is valid only for slowly varying perturbing potentials . yet",
    "effective - mass theory is widely accepted as a valid lowest - order approximation for the shallow impurity problem , @xcite even though the atomic impurity potential is not slowly varying .",
    "its validity in this context is established by the existence of rigorous methods for extending effective - mass theory to include higher - order perturbations , @xcite including the rapidly varying part of the impurity potential .",
    "@xcite these produce short - range and long - range corrections to the effective hamiltonian ( each with its own independent parameters ) , which lead to the well known chemical shift and splitting of effective - mass degeneracies , @xcite thereby bringing the rough estimates of effective - mass theory into much closer agreement with experiment .",
    "a heterostructure is nothing but an assembly of atoms .",
    "it is therefore difficult to imagine a valid argument for accepting the use of generalized effective - mass differential equations in the shallow impurity problem , yet categorically rejecting them for small atomic perturbations in heterostructures .",
    "according to linear response theory , the perturbation generated by a collection of small atomic perturbations is to leading order just the superposition of the individual perturbations .",
    "the rapidly varying part of the heterostructure potential @xcite can thus be handled by the same techniques used in the impurity problem .",
    "@xcite the validity of low - order differential equations for shallow heterostructures  as for shallow impurities  consequently rests on two fundamental assumptions : @xcite that the envelope functions satisfying these equations are slowly varying @xcite ( i.e. , have a fourier transform limited to small wave vectors ) within the energy range of experimental interest , and that the atomic perturbations are truly `` shallow '' in real heterostructures .    the first assumption is confirmed by numerical examples in later sections of this paper , in agreement with prior empirical pseudopotential studies .",
    "@xcite for the second assumption , the definition of `` shallow '' is a relative one that depends on the energy separation between the states included explicitly in the envelope - function model and the remote states treated as perturbations [ see , e.g. , eq .  ( ii.33 ) of ref . ] .",
    "consider the case of a gaas / alas heterostructure , where the valence - band offset is about 0.5 ev and the energy gap is about 1.5 ev . treating gaas / alas as a shallow perturbation of the virtual crystal al@xmath4ga@xmath4as would be expected to yield marginal results ( at best ) in a single - band effective - mass model for the degenerate @xmath5 valence states .",
    "such a model would be expected to give good results only for weaker perturbations , such as those in a gaas / al@xmath0ga@xmath1as heterostructure ( within the virtual - crystal approximation ) . on the other hand , treating gaas / alas as a shallow perturbation would be expected to produce good results in a multiband envelope - function model that includes a few of the nearest conduction - band states explicitly , since the remote bands are then more than 5 ev away from the valence - band maximum .",
    "( this method of making moderately `` deep '' perturbations `` shallow '' by including more bands in the hamiltonian was proposed by keldysh for the deep impurity problem in bulk semiconductors.@xcite ) all of the above expectations are confirmed below by numerical examples for gaas / al@xmath0ga@xmath1as , gaas / alas , and in@xmath2ga@xmath3as / inp .    to be more specific , the multiband envelope - function hamiltonian of ref .   was derived by treating the heterostructure as a perturbation ( within the pseudopotential approximation ) of a virtual bulk reference crystal .",
    "the self - consistent potential energy of the heterostructure was approximated using the linear and quadratic terms of nonlinear response theory ( see the preceding paper @xcite for further details ) .",
    "a finite - order envelope - function hamiltonian was constructed by using luttinger ",
    "kohn perturbation theory @xcite to eliminate the @xmath6  and potential - energy coupling to remote bands , working to order @xmath7 in the bulk reference hamiltonian , @xcite to order @xmath8 in the linear response terms , @xcite and to order @xmath9 in the quadratic response .",
    "@xcite this theory is shown here to work well in a 3-state model for the @xmath10 valence states ( i.e. , neglecting spin - orbit coupling ) of a gaas / al@xmath0ga@xmath1as superlattice and in a 7-state @xmath11 model for gaas / alas and in@xmath2ga@xmath3as / inp superlattices .",
    "examples illustrating the success of a 4-state @xmath12 model for in@xmath2ga@xmath3as / inp superlattices have been given elsewhere .",
    "@xcite    to test the limits of the single - band ( @xmath10 ) model , this paper also extends the theory of ref .   to include terms of order @xmath13 and @xmath14 , where @xmath15 denotes the heterostructure perturbation",
    "this is shown to yield much better predictions of the position - dependent effective masses of both gaas / alas and in@xmath2ga@xmath3as / inp than the @xmath16 theory of ref .  .",
    "the resulting superlattice band structures are also of reasonably good accuracy , but over a more limited energy range than the multiband models . the principal limitation of the single - band theory seems to be the presence of spurious solutions generated by @xmath17 terms in the bulk reference hamiltonian .",
    "the extended @xmath18 theory also yields some interesting conclusions regarding operator ordering in the effective kinetic - energy operator @xmath19 in effective - mass theory .",
    "much previous work has examined various possible ways of choosing the exponents @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 in the von roos parametrization @xcite @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the momentum operator ( in one dimension ) , @xmath25 is the effective mass , and @xmath26 .",
    "morrow and brownstein @xcite have argued that only exponents satisfying @xmath27 are physically permissible in abrupt heterostructures , which would rule out seemingly reasonable possibilities such as @xcite @xmath28 .",
    "the present theory is not consistent with any single operator ordering of this type . instead",
    ", the terms of order @xmath29 derived here take the form of a _ linear combination _ of terms containing position - dependent functions having _ all possible _ operator orderings with respect to @xmath24 .",

    "some technical ingredients of the calculations and the justification for choosing this particular model are discussed further in ref .  .",
    "as shown there , the model system predicts valence - band offsets in reasonably good agreement with experiment , but ( as usual for lda calculations@xcite ) does not predict accurate conduction bands .",
    "the envelope - function hamiltonian in this paper is not calculated directly from the `` exact '' superlattice pseudopotential ( since that would require a separate self - consistent calculation for each new structure ) , but is instead obtained from the linear and quadratic response to virtual - crystal perturbations of a bulk reference crystal . @xcite the reference crystal is defined as the virtual - crystal average of the bulk constituents ( e.g. , al@xmath4ga@xmath4as for gaas / alas and in@xmath30ga@xmath31as@xmath4p@xmath4 for in@xmath2ga@xmath3as / inp ) .",
    "the perturbation of the heterostructure relative to the reference crystal is defined by the change in pseudopotential @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the ionic pseudopotential of atom @xmath20 , @xmath34 is the position of atom @xmath20 in unit cell @xmath35 , and @xmath36 is the change in fractional weight of atom @xmath20 in cell @xmath35 of the heterostructure relative to the reference crystal .",
    "the fundamental assumption of nonlinear response theory is that the valence electron density @xmath37 and the self - consistent pseudopotential can be expressed as power series in the perturbation @xmath36 ; e.g. ,    [ eq : nonlinear ] @xmath38    here @xmath39 is the density of the reference crystal , @xmath40 is the total linear response , and @xmath41 is the total quadratic response .",
