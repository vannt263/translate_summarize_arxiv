    "plasma ions are generally assumed to be stationary in the theory of ultra - relativistic non - linear plasma electron waves excited as wakefields of a laser or particle beam @xcite-@xcite .",
    "important exceptions to this occur when the drive beam ( or a witness beam being accelerated ) in a plasma wakefield accelerator becomes denser than the background plasma density by a factor larger than the ion to electron mass ratio @xcite@xcite .",
    "such is the case for the parameters of ultra - low emittance future collider designs at the tev energy scale .",
    "ion motion also becomes important in the wake train behind the initial wake oscillation or bubble .",
    "understanding the long - term ion behavior @xcite@xcite is important to determine the state of the plasma for succeeding pulses in a future plasma collider of high repetition rate @xcite@xcite .",
    "we also show that the resulting ion - wake channel formed is of interest for positron wakefield acceleration .     driven by a matched laser pulse ( vector potential @xmath0 and frequency @xmath1 ) with @xmath2 .",
    "( b ) non - linear ion - wake in the form of a cylindrical ion - soliton of radius @xmath3 excited behind the bubble electron wake in a proton plasma .",
    "( c ) transverse ion - density profile at @xmath4 .",
    "notice that the ion density perturbation in this excitation phase is still building up and is a fraction of the background ion density , @xmath5 . ]    in this paper , we model the excitation of a nonlinear ion - wake in the trail of an electron plasma wake in the bubble regime , driven by either relativistically intense laser or particle beam energy sources . the ion - wake is shown to be a non - linear ion - acoustic wave in the form of a cylindrical ion - acoustic soliton .",
    "its characteristics are similar to the solutions of the cylindrical korteweg - de vries equation ( ckdv ) @xcite-@xcite .",
    "however , the ion - wake shown here is different from a cylindrical - kdv soliton due to several reasons : the bubble wake electron oscillations do not thermalize into an isothermal plasma ; the ion - wake soliton breaks up into n - solitons as it evolves and there is an ion - density spike on the axis .",
    "the soliton propagates radially outwards leaving behind a flat residue resulting in a partially filled ion - wake channel .",
    "the dynamics of the ion wake is shown to have two distinct phases .",
    "the excitation phase where the time asymmetry of the radial electric fields of the bubble excite the ions into a soliton - like structure . at later times , the propagation phase where the soliton is driven outwards by the pressure of thermalized electrons after the electron oscillations undergo phase mixing @xcite .",
    "representative pic simulation results in fig.[fig1:ion - wake - laser ] and fig.[fig2:ion - wake - beam ] illustrate the salient features of the non - linear ion - wake .",
    "figure[fig1:ion - wake - laser ] shows the excitation phase at an early time when the bubble wake train is executing ordered oscillations and its fields have begun to excite the ion - wake structure seen in fig.[fig1:ion - wake - laser](b),(c ) .",
    "the radial oscillations later phase mix and the electrons thermalize , their thermal pressure then drives the ion - soliton outwards as shown in fig.[fig2:ion - wake - beam ] . as we show below , it is the longitudinal or time asymmetry of the radial electron wakefields that excites the ion soliton which propagates leaving behind a partially - filled channel shown in the pic simulations in fig.[fig1:ion - wake - laser ] and fig.[fig2:ion - wake - beam ] .    , @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , these beam - plasma parameters are quite similar to @xcite .",
    "( b ) corresponding ion density in cylindrical coordinates ( fixed - box ) .",
    "note the n - soliton formation in the ion - density .",
    "this is seen as the ion - wake evolves further , for instance at @xmath9 .",
    "( c ) radial electron and ion density profile at @xmath10 . ]    in section [ ion - wake - model - considerations ] we present considerations and assumptions made to derive the ion - wake model . in section [ radial - ion - wave ] using the fluid equations for ion dynamics we model the non - linear ion - acoustic waves as a driven cylindrical ion soliton .",
    "the driven wave models are shown to have two distinct phases : the excitation phase and the propagation phase .",
    "we present a model for the excitation of the ion - soliton by the electron bubble radial fields in section [ ion - soliton - excitation - phase ] and verify it using simulation results . in section [ ion - soliton - propagation - phase ] we present simulation results showing the dynamics of propagation of the ion - soliton driven by a radial temperature gradient .",
    "finally , in section [ ion - soliton - positron - wake ] we analyze the properties of a positron beam driven wakefield in an ion - wake channel .",
    "we recognize that to study the time evolution of a wake - excited plasma in order to establish the duration over which it relaxes to thermal equilibrium both collisional and collision - less dynamics have to be considered along with the physics of recombination modes such as electron - ion recombination .",
    "however , in this work the dynamics of plasma is modeled under the collision - less approximation .",
    "thus , diffusion is not important during the timescales over which the ion - wake is studied .",
    "we do not discuss recombination except mentioning that the  afterglow \" is dominated by volume recombination while localized effects can not be ruled out .    in order to formally establish the difference between the density wave processes that occur over collision - less timescale in contrast to the ones that start dominating under collisions , we show the assumptions made to arrive at the dynamics of diffusion .",
    "the process of diffusion is modeled with a parabolic partial differential equation which is deduced from the ion - fluid equations under the assumption that the inertial response of the ions is much faster than the collisional timescales .",
    "the effect of collisions is introduced as a drag force , @xmath11 .",
    "the collisional drag force modifies the ion - fluid equation of motion as , @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the average electron - ion collision frequency and is obtained from the mean free path .",
    "diffusion of plasma is thus driven by the charge - separation field , @xmath14 and the thermal pressure , @xmath15 while being impeded by the collisional drag . upon ignoring the inertia of the ions , @xmath16 , the equation for the ion velocity by diffusion in an isothermal plasma is , @xmath17 .",
    "the characteristic parameter of diffusion is the diffusion coefficient or diffusivity @xmath18 and mobility @xmath19 which depend upon the collision frequency . using the gradient of the velocity in the continuity equation and ignoring the mobility @xmath20 , leads to a fick s law diffusion equation , @xmath21 ; characteristic of a parabolic equation .    when the mobility is retained , the fluid equation is a moment of the fokker - planck equation which is the kinetic model of the collision - driven drift and diffusion .",
    "the diffusion equation thus can not support wave - like solution because such solutions are characteristic of a hyperbolic partial differential equation .",
    "the solutions of linear and non - linear diffusion equations show the evolution of density profile by diffusion and can be obtained using the self - similar formulation .",
    "the self - similar solutions show the spatial and temporal evolution of the density to be exponentially decaying . in the non - linear case",
    ", the density can have a sharp - front as it decays .",
    "however , a soliton - like propagating solution can not be described with diffusion equation .",
    "hence , the cylindrical ion - soliton presented here is not diffusion but a wave phenomenon .",
    "the electron bubble wake is excited by a sub - wavelength impulse of an ultra - short driver .",
    "in contrast , the ion - wake is excited as the ions undergo sustained interactions with the bubble fields within the spatial extent of the wake over several plasma electron oscillations .",
    "this happens because the electron wake - plasmon oscillations @xcite have a near speed - of - light phase - velocity ( @xmath22 ) but negligible group - velocity @xcite @xmath23 ( in the 1-d limit ) , where , @xmath24 is the mean electron thermal velocity of the background plasma",
    ". therefore a slowly - propagating train of coupled electron plasmons is excited in a cold collision - less plasma @xcite .",
    "a large difference between phase - velocity and the group velocity of the electron oscillations allows sustained field - ion interactions .",
    "it should be noted that high phase - velocity plasma electron waves are possible only in a cold plasma with appropriate density , @xmath25 that allows near speed - of - light propagation of the energy sources , @xmath26 .",
    "ion - soliton modeled here is assuming a significant difference between the phase - velocity and the group velocity of the plasma - electron waves .    a time symmetric electron wakefield would excite time symmetric ion oscillations where the ion velocities average to zero .",
    "however , the bubble wake is asymmetric in time as the back of the bubble electron compression is a small fraction of the length of electron cavitation .",
    "the electron oscillations become non - linear at high driver intensities as all the interacting electrons are displaced radially , @xmath27 , forming a non - linear bubble - shaped electron spatial structure enclosing ions in its cavity .",
    "the wakefields excited in the bubble are useful for accelerating electrons @xcite@xcite@xcite .",
    "high intensities also lead to fields that can directly drive the plasma electrons to velocities near the speed - of - light .",
    "this occurs when for a laser pulse @xmath28 and an electron beam @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the peak normalized laser vector potential , @xmath31 the peak beam density and radius .",
    "the radially expelled electrons oscillate radially under the force of the plasma ions .",
    "these oscillations are excited over plasma electron oscillation timescales , @xmath32 ( @xmath33 ) where @xmath34 is the temporally anharmonic relativistic electron quiver momentum .",
    "the normalized quiver momentum of the electrons in the bubble - oscillations is relativistic @xmath35 and the quiver frequency is @xmath36 @xcite .",
    "we show that non - linear ultra - relativistic electron wakefields interacting with the plasma ions lead to the excitation of a non - linear ion - wake .",
    "the non - linear ion - wake @xmath37 in fig.[fig1:ion - wake - laser ] and fig.[fig2:ion - wake - beam ] is excited over timescales @xmath38 in the trail of a bubble - wake train . by shaping the energy source",
    "it can be matched or guided to excite a long train of nearly identical plasmons , fig.[fig3:bubble - train ] . since it is the electric field @xmath39 of a nearly stationary bubble plasmon that excite collective ion - motion we model the ion dynamics in a single bubble . using the single bubble ion dynamics , fig.[fig5:bubble - ion - dynamics ] we model the ion - wake over the whole bubble - train spanning several hundred plasma skin - depths ( @xmath40 ) .",
    "the wake - plasmon energy density ( @xmath41 , where @xmath42 is the wakefield amplitude ) is continually partitioned between the field energy and the coherent electron quiver kinetic energy . in our model",
    "we do not include heavy beam - loading of the bubble electron wake . under heavy",
    "beam - loading the bubble field energy is efficiently coupled to the kinetic energy of the accelerated beam . in this scenario",
    "the bubble collapses and the magnitude of the ion - wake is smaller .",
    "the decoherence of the ordered electron quiver to random thermal energy , @xmath43 due to the phase - mixing @xcite of individual electron trajectories caused by the non - linearities and inhomogeneities is further stimulated by the ion motion .",
    "the details of the thermalization of the wake electrons under ion motion is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "it is over these timescales upon thermalization that the steepened ion - density expands outwards radially as a non - linear ion - acoustic wave driven by the electron thermal pressure .",
    "the energy transfer process observed here is a coupling from the non - linear plasma electron - mode to a non - linear ion - acoustic mode @xcite .",
    "we also observe energy coupling to the bow - shock which is formed behind the bubble , fig.[fig5:bubble - ion - dynamics ] .",
    "the ion - wake is a partially - filled channel with sub - skin - depth density - spikes on - axis and at the bubble - edge located at the bubble - radius , @xmath44 @xcite@xcite of several @xmath40 .",
    "the ion accumulation in both the density - spikes is many times the background density as shown in fig.[fig1:ion - wake - laser](c ) and fig.[fig2:ion - wake - beam](c ) .",
    "the wake energy is coupled to the ions and to the thermal energy @xcite of the de - cohering wake electrons .",
    "the interplay between the electron thermal energy and ion kinetic energy then form a cylindrically symmetric non - linear ion - acoustic wave which further empties the near - void region of the ion - wake channel .    the time - scale of dissipation of the ion - wake and relaxation of the plasma distribution to @xmath45 sets an upper limit on the repetition - rate @xcite of the future plasma colliders .",
    "it is well known that the ion acoustic wave is damped by collisions and ion - wave landau damping .",
    "the ion dynamics also opens important questions on the design the plasma container walls in a future high - repetition rate accelerator because if a significant flux of ions strikes the wall it can cause significant damage .",
    "it was suggested that the wakefield energy in the plasma wave could be replenished and sustained @xcite by a train of energy source in order to achieve high repetition rate .",
    "however , as shown in this paper due to ion motion this is not possible .",
    "we explore the use of the ion - wake channel for positron - beam driven positron acceleration in a novel and relevant `` suck - in '' regime @xcite where the positron beam radius @xmath46 .",
    "such channels are also promising @xcite@xcite@xcite for exciting electron - wakefields with independent transverse and longitudinal field spatial structures .",
    "the formation of plasma channels which are vaguely similar to the cylindrical soliton shown here but are excited by significantly different processes have been shown previously .",
    "these processes are : using a collimated laser with annular profile @xcite@xcite , by an electrical discharge @xcite , by linear wakes in the self - modulated regime @xcite@xcite and by the ponderomotive force of a short - pulse laser - driven linear wake @xcite . in the linear electron wake regime",
    "the wakefields are symmetric so they average out over the electron oscillation period and only the second - order ponderomotive force ( @xmath47 ) drives the ion - motion ( @xmath48 ) @xcite .",
    "spatially , in the linear - wake regimes the radial ion excitation is limited to around @xmath40 and the ion - density perturbation is linear in the background plasma density , @xmath25 @xcite@xcite .",
    "additionally , in the earlier studies no ion acoustic - waves have been examined .",
    "to develop insight into the ion wake physics , we consider the 1-d simplified dispersion relation of the ion - acoustic plane waves ,    @xmath49    where , @xmath50 and @xmath51 under the collision - less condition , @xmath52 and @xmath53 is the adiabatic index with @xmath54 being the degrees of freedom of the ions . during the initial phase of the interaction between the bubble fields and the ions",
    ", the ion inertia dominates their motion . at times when the fields of the bubble interact with the ions , the inertia of ions leads to very small spatial displacement scales and so @xmath55 so the term @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the debye wavelength .",
    "thus in this phase @xmath58 and the ion - soliton spike at @xmath59 grows over the plasma frequency timescale , @xmath60 . at initial times",
    "the plasma is also cold so @xmath61 .    when the ions gain significant momentum and start oscillating over larger spatial scales in response to the electron dynamics then @xmath62 .",
    "in this phase the acoustic wave propagation becomes dispersion - less with @xmath63 .",
    "however , when the ion density perturbation undergoes steepening in a large amplitude acoustic wave forming a spike over much smaller spatial scales , @xmath64 becomes large and dispersion becomes important .",
    "the ion - acoustic dispersion relation as @xmath64 increases has higher - order corrections in @xmath64 , @xmath65 .",
    "also , as the ions are heated at later time @xmath66 increases and modifies the sound speed to @xmath67 .",
    "thus when the ions are heated the sound speed lies between @xmath68 and @xmath69 .      during the time when the oscillations in the electron plasma - wave wake are undergoing phase - mixing the wakefields still persist and the ion motion is driven by the fields as well as the thermal pressure .",
    "we show under the linear approximation how an ion - wake differs from a freely propagating ion - acoustic wave .",
    "it should be noted that as the wake electrons phase - mix , the plasma is not isothermal in this case .",
    "the linear ion - acoustic wave can be obtained by perturbative expansion of ion density , @xmath70 and ion fluid velocity @xmath71 in the zeroth - order ion fluid continuity equation , @xmath72 . taking a partial derivative with time , @xmath73 .",
    "the ion - fluid equation of motion where the electron temperature has a spatial gradient is , @xmath74 . upon substituting the equation of motion in the time - derivative of the linearized continuity equation , @xmath75 .",
    "thus , a driven ion - acoustic wave linearized to the first - order in density perturbation has the form ,    @xmath76     ( easily inferred from the radial electric field ) .",
    "( a ) electron density in 2d cylindrical real - space , ( b ) corresponding longitudinal electric field profile and ( c ) corresponding radial - field profile .",
    "the beam - plasma parameters are the same as in fig.[fig2:ion - wake - beam ] but the electron - wake is shown at an earlier time @xmath77 . ]    in this first - order approximation the right - hand side of the eq.[ion - wave - equation - first - order ] shows two separate timescales of the ion - wake . at earlier times , the first term on the right - hand side dominates .",
    "this is the _ formation _ phase of the ion - wake where the bubble electron oscillations undergo ordered radial motion and the bubble radial electric field excites the inertial response of the ions .",
    "this leads to the formation of the on - axis and @xmath59 ion density spikes . at later times after the phase - mixing between radial oscillators the electrons thermalize and @xmath78 .",
    "this is the _ propagation _ phase where the electron thermal pressure gradient drives the cylindrical soliton at @xmath59 radially outwards .",
    "the pic simulations show the two phases of the electron dynamics .",
    "the coherent and phase - mixing phases of the electron oscillations are evident in fig.[fig3:bubble - train](a ) .",
    "the electron motion in the first oscillation bucket is coherent whereas several oscillations behind the driver , the electron begin to de - cohere .",
    "this is also evident in the time - evolution of the ion soliton in fig.[fig6:ion - motion - lineouts](b ) where the radial electric field goes to zero around 200@xmath79 and the ion - soliton is seen moving outwards radially in [ fig6:ion - motion - lineouts](a ) .",
    "the linearized ion - acoustic wave equation is however inadequate to describe the propagating solitary density spike at the ion - wake edge , with ion density accumulation many times the background density . in the linear regime",
    "the homogenous ion - acoustic wave equation predicts sinusoidal radial ion oscillations that support the wave .    when the density in the ion perturbation begins to rise to the order of the background density , the electrostatic potential due to charge - separation between the ions and the thermal electrons correspondingly rises .",
    "this leads to _ wave - steepening _ due to the preferential acceleration of ions in the direction of the ion - acoustic wave velocity .",
    "when the potential of the wave is large enough the ions get trapped and co - propagate with the ion - acoustic wave phase velocity , this non - linearity is the basis of the soliton .",
    "it should be noted that the linearized kinetic theory does not formally incorporate the trapping of particles at the wave phase - velocity . in this limit",
    "the density perturbation shape is therefore not sinusoidal as the co - propagating background ions accumulate and their density perturbation takes the form of an ion - soliton .",
    "the co - propagating ion velocity in the soliton can therefore exceed the ion - acoustic phase velocity , @xmath80 and @xmath81 where @xmath82 is the mach number .",
    "therefore , non - linear acoustic waves are in the form of a soliton and propagate faster than the ion - acoustic velocity .    in the second - order ,",
    "the non - linear ion - density spike @xmath83 propagation is governed by the korteweg - de vries ( kdv ) equation @xcite which has propagating solutions of the form @xmath84 @xcite where @xmath85 is the ion - acoustic waveform , a soliton solution and @xmath86 is the mach number of the propagating solution .",
    "higher - order contributions to the kdv equation have also been considered .",
    "however , the standard form of the kdv equation assumes an isothermal plasma whereas the bubble - wake phase - mixes into a plasma with radial temperature gradient . in a non - isothermal plasma",
    "the effect of trapped electrons in the ion - soliton have been considered using the bernstein - greene - kruskal model at the ion - acoustic velocity @xcite .",
    "it is also known that a single ion - soliton under the appropriate conditions can break - up into multiple solitons leading to a n - soliton solution .",
    "this is also a phenomenon we observe in the simulations shown in the ion density of the beam - driven case at @xmath87 in fig.[fig2:ion - wake - beam ] .",
    "we consider a description of the non - linear cylindrical ion - acoustic waves with a radial temperature gradient by retaining the second - order of perturbation in ion - density and fluid velocity .",
    "we also assume that the background electron trapping does not significantly modify the distribution function .",
    "we assume that the temperature does not change by several orders of magnitude in vicinity of the ion soliton .",
    "this assumption is also validated by the pic simulations in fig.[fig4:elec - temperature - profile ] .",

    "this represents the square - root of the electron temperature , @xmath88 .",
    "the radial gradient of the temperature , @xmath89 is thus computed at the peak of the soliton ( red ) and in its vicinity ( green ) .",
    "it is interesting to note that @xmath90 . ]    to obtain the kdv equation in cylindrical coordinates with radial temperature gradient we normalize with respect to the local electron temperature , the radius : @xmath91 , time : @xmath92 , electric field : @xmath93 , potential : @xmath94 , ion - density perturbation : @xmath95 , electron - density perturbation : @xmath96 , ion - fluid velocity : @xmath97 . under this normalization",

    "the electric field @xmath102 is both due to the thermal pressure and the radial fields of the wake , @xmath103 .",
    "but , in the following analysis the propagation of a non - linear ion - acoustic wave is considered , so we assume that the electron oscillations are thermalized and thus the effect of the fields of the wake is negligible , @xmath104 .",
    "we look for a propagating disturbance of @xmath105 , @xmath106 , @xmath107 and @xmath102 in a stationary background plasma with uniform background density @xmath25 .",
    "we consider weakly non - linear ion - acoustic wave and expand all the wave quantities in the powers of @xmath108 .",
    "we expand the ion - density : @xmath109 , electron density : @xmath110 , electric - field : @xmath111 , electrostatic potential : @xmath112 , electron temperature : @xmath113 and ion - fluid velocity : @xmath114 .",

    "the cartesian kdv equation can be analytically solved to obtain two classes of solutions : ( a ) self - similar solutions which are shown in @xcite to be airy functions and ( b ) soliton solutions .",
    "a `` soliton '' is a single isolated pulse which retains its shape as it propagates at some velocity , @xmath142 .",
    "this means that for a soliton - like solution the @xmath85 only depends upon the soliton - frame variable , @xmath143 and not on space - like @xmath144 and time - like @xmath145 variables separately .",
    "the solution of the cartesian kdv equation in this co - moving frame is @xmath146 @xcite .",
    "the ckdv equation and the driven ckdv equation obtained here can not be solved analytically .",
    "however , the numerical analysis and experimental verification @xcite of the cylindrical - kdv ( ckdv ) equation show that it supports functions of the form @xmath147 in the form of a cylindrical ion - soliton .",
    "but , the amplitude of the cylindrical soliton changes as it propagates . the velocity of the soliton in the cylindrical case is higher than in cartesian case @xcite .",
    "since the ion - wake is excited in a non isothermal plasma its velocity changes as it is driven .",
    "the mean electron temperature reduces because the volume of the ion - wake expands as the soliton moves radially outwards .",
    "it is also known to support n - soliton solution .",
    "we computationally seek the dependence of the non - linear ion - density spike on @xmath148-coordinate .",
    "it should be noted that such soliton solutions are supported under certain limiting condition on the mach number , @xmath86 .",
    "the strict condition on the existence and stability of an ion - soliton arises from the requirements on the magnitude of the potential required for trapping the background ions for a given velocity of the soliton .",
    "here we find that the speed of ion soliton is approximately equal to the ion - acoustic speed using the mean temperature .",
    "as this is not an isothermal plasma there is no well - defined ion - acoustic speed .",
    "so , the ion - acoustic wave is phase - mixed as its phase - velocity is spatially varying .",
    "however , we confirm from the simulations that this condition is strongly satisfied as @xmath149 . in this scenario",
    "the mean electron temperature provides an estimate of the sound - speed .",
    "the local electron temperature of the ion soliton as shown in fig.[fig4:elec - temperature - profile ] , is used to calculate mach number , @xmath86 and thus a stability criteria can be derived .",
    "this problem is represented using the condition on the sagdeev psuedo - potential , @xmath150 that it has to be a real number .",
    "this condition is satisfied when @xmath151 therefore , @xmath152 and @xmath153 . using this we find the well - known condition ,    @xmath154",
    "as will be shown later , we find from simulations that the mach number calculated using the mean temperature is well within these bounds and thus the soliton is stable .",
    "since the characteristic time of ion - motion is much longer than the electron oscillations , the longitudinal field @xmath155 averages out over the full bubble electron oscillation .",
    "so , the ions do not gain any net longitudinal momentum .",
    "however , atypical radial ion - dynamics arise because the radial fields , @xmath156 are asymmetric in time as shown in fig.[fig5:bubble - ion - dynamics ] and do not average to zero , driving an average radial ion - momentum .",
    "the first stage of the ion - wake formation is controlled by the different time - asymmetric phases in fig.[fig5:bubble - ion - dynamics ] of the bubble radial impulses namely , ",
    "suck - in \" due to the electron compression in the back of the bubble @xmath157 during @xmath158 shown in fig.[fig5:bubble - ion - dynamics](c ) , and the  push - out \" due to the mutual - ion space - charge coulomb repulsion force @xmath159 during @xmath160 shown in fig.[fig5:bubble - ion - dynamics](d ) .",
    "the suck - in force is spatially - periodic at non - linear plasma wavelength , @xmath161 with a duty - cycle @xmath162 .",
    "in addition to the plasma wake , the propagating energy sources themselves impart impulses such as the laser ponderomotive force @xmath163 where @xmath164 and the radial force of the drive beam @xmath165 where @xmath166 .",
    "we neglect the driver impulses ( below threshold intensity for direct non - linear ion excitation @xcite@xcite ) ) because they act on the ions over their sub - wavelength short duration .",
    "this is unlike the slowly - propagating wake - plasmon bubbles that undergo continual interaction over many plasma periods .",
    "the validity of this assumption is evident from the laser ion - wake in fig.[fig1:ion - wake - laser ] .",
    "since the ponderomotive force of a laser driver is an outward force for both the electrons and ions , the on - axis density - spike can not be from this force .",
