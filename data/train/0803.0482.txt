    "in @xcite , penrose developed his argument that , in the correct theory of space - time , initial singularities and final singularities would be different in character , with the weyl tensor finite or even zero at initial singularities but no such constraint on final singularities . as a test case",
    ", he discussed the space - time singularities associated with hawking s picture of an evaporating black hole ( see also @xcite ) . in this picture , there is a final singularity formed in the collapse which led to the black hole . at the endpoint of the evaporation of this black hole",
    ", this singularity vanishes but not before , at the last instant , being visible in the exterior and therefore being briefly an initial singularity .",
    "argument then suggests that the singularity as seen from the past should be different in character , with respect to conformal properties , from the singularity as seen from the future .    to test this suggestion",
    ", we need a convincing model of the metric for an evaporating black hole and we shall use the model of hiscock @xcite , @xcite . essentially , this consists of matching vaidya metrics to the schwarzschild metric of the black hole and to flat space , with an ingoing flux of negative energy density which reduces the schwarzschild mass to zero , and an outgoing flux of positive energy density which radiates the mass to infinity , leaving flat space to the future of an outgoing null hypersurface .",
    "details will be given below , but note that the model is spherically - symmetric .",
    "once we have the model , we test its conformal properties using a method developed in @xcite .",
    "null geodesics are conformally - invariant as point sets , in the sense of being unchanged under conformal rescalings of the metric , and as a point set a null geodesic is also a null conformal geodesic ( see e.g. @xcite for the general definition of conformal geodesic ) . by regarding a null metric geodesic ,",
    "say @xmath0 , as a null conformal geodesic , one can give a conformally - invariant definition of propagation of frames along @xmath0 and can then give conformally - invariant definitions of boundedness of conformal curvature and its derivatives along @xmath0 , namely by requiring components of the ( conformally - invariant ) conformal curvature in these conformally - invariant frames to be bounded . in general , it is more natural to work with the calculus of tractors and tractor curvature ( see @xcite ) . for our purposes in this article this technology",
    "is nt needed , but we recall that the _ tractor curvature _ , which is the curvature of the tractor connection , has as nonzero components the weyl tensor @xmath1 and the cotton tensor , which is the derivative @xmath2}^{\\;\\;d}$ ] of the schouten tensor ( defined below ) .",
    "now suppose that @xmath0 is incomplete as a metric null geodesic but that there is a conformal rescaling of the metric which allows an extension of the space - time so that @xmath0 can be extended as a null geodesic of the rescaled metric .",
    "then necessarily the conformal curvature ( and the tractor curvature ) will be bounded in the rescaled metric , so that the conformally - invariant conditions of boundedness will hold .",
    "( it is a recent result of one of us @xcite that these necessary conditions are sufficient : given bounded derivatives up to order @xmath3 of the tractor curvature , a @xmath4 local extension of the conformal structure will exist . )",
    "this method was used in @xcite in a variety of particular cases : on radial null and space - like geodesics in the schwarzschild metric , to find , as expected , that no conformal extension is possible through the singularities at @xmath5 or through space - like infinity @xmath6 ; on radial null geodesics of the _ conical spherical _ metric : @xmath7 ( so - called because it has a singularity at the origin due to a deficit in the solid angle , analogous to the deficit in the plane angle at the familiar conical singularity ) to show that no conformal extension is possible through the singularity at @xmath5 ; and along the matter flow - lines of the lemaitre - tolman - bondi dust cosmologies to find conditions for conformal extendibility through the singularity .    in this article , we use the method to analyse the singularity which is formed in the collapse and then evaporates with the black hole .",
    "this singularity has , in the penrose diagram ( see figure 1 ) , an interior and a final point before it vanishes .",
    "our findings may be summarised as follows :    * along radial in or outgoing null geodesics meeting the singularity at an interior point , the physical affine parameter distance to the singularity is finite , and the weyl spinor can never be made finite by rescaling ; no conformal extension is possible ( note that this includes regions of the schwarzschild singularity , so in particular , as one would expect , no conformal extension is possible through there ) ; * along radial ingoing null geodesics from the past to the final point of the singularity , the physical affine parameter distance is finite ; the weyl spinor vanishes by continuity ; the tractor curvature vanishes if one imposes hiscock s condition ( @xcite , @xcite ) of finite rates of particle creation ; by imposing more conditions on the mass function of the vaidya interior metric , one may make more derivatives of the tractor curvature zero ( and if all derivatives up to order @xmath3 are bounded then there is a local @xmath4-extension of the conformal structure , @xcite ) ; if one imposes the decay rate on the mass function which follows naively from the hawking mass - loss formula , then the tractor curvature is singular ( and no local extension of the conformal structure is possible ) ; * along radial outgoing null geodesics from the past to the final point of the singularity , the situation is similar to that with the conical spherical metric : there are choices of conformal factor which lead to a bounded weyl spinor , but then the singularity is infinitely far off in the rescaled metric ; all other choices lead to an unbounded weyl tensor ; either way no conformal extension is possible ( it is also worth noting that the affine parameter distance to the singularity in the physical , unrescaled metric is infinite in this case ) ; * along past - directed , radial ingoing null geodesics from the future to the final point of the singularity the physical affine parameter distance is finite , and of course the tractor curvature and its derivatives are zero ; local conformal extension is possible .    in summary ,",
    "the conclusions accord with penrose s hypothesis : a conformal extension is possible from the future but not from the past , with the exception that local extensions of low differentiability may be possible along ingoing null geodesics to the final point , given extra conditions on the rate at which the mass - function vanishes .",
    "a global extension from the past , through the whole singularity , is never possible .",
    "the plan of the article is as follows .",
    "we begin in the next section by giving more details of the evaporating black hole ( ebh ) models , introducing a newman - penrose null tetrad and calculating what we need from the spin - coefficient formalism ( for which see e.g. @xcite or @xcite ) . in section 3 ,",
    "we give the details of the method of testing for the possibility of a conformal extension , in terms of null conformal geodesics and the conformally - invariant propagation of spinors along them . in section 4",
    ", we collect the results of applying this test along radial in and outgoing null geodesics .",
    "as noted above , hiscock s evaporating black hole ( ebh ) models @xcite , @xcite are constructed by matching vaidya metrics to the schwarzschild metric of the black hole and to flat space .",
    "start with a schwarzschild metric , formed in collapse , and given to the future of a constant @xmath8 surface @xmath9 , say @xmath10 , in the usual coordinates ( so @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the mass of the initial schwarzschild metric ) .",
    "the details of the collapse are assumed to lie to the past of @xmath9 .",
    "pick a sphere @xmath13 on @xmath14 and a spherically - symmetric time - like surface @xmath15 with past boundary at @xmath16 . in the space - time region to the future of @xmath17 bounded by @xmath15 , take the metric to be the ingoing vaidya metric ( [ v1 ] ) below , with mass @xmath18 , where @xmath19 and @xmath20 decreases to zero at @xmath21 ( so @xmath22 ) as negative mass flows into the hole . in the space - time region to the future of @xmath23 bounded by @xmath15 , take the metric to be the outgoing vaidya metric ( [ v2 ] ) below , with mass @xmath24 , where @xmath25 and @xmath26 decreases to zero at @xmath27 ( so @xmath28 ) as positive mass flows out to future - null - infinity @xmath29 .",
    "@xmath15 has future boundary at the 2-sphere @xmath30 . in the union of the regions to the past of @xmath17 and to the past of @xmath31 , retain the schwarzschild metric .",
    "there will necessarily be distributional curvature along @xmath15 , and the choices of @xmath18 , @xmath24 , this distributional curvature and the history of @xmath15 are tied together by the einstein equations . however , for our purposes , we do nt need the details of this as long as there is a sphere @xmath32 on @xmath15 as a future boundary at which @xmath33 .",
    "assume so , and then match to flat space across @xmath34 and across @xmath35 .",
    "the penrose diagram for this metric is given in figure 1 .",
    "note in particular that @xmath15 must stop before the singularity is reached .",
    "this is because at the singularity @xmath36 vanishes , while in the outgoing vaidya metric the singularity at @xmath5 is in the past , corresponding to the past singularity of schwarzschild , not the future one .",
    "our interest is in the future singularity of the schwarzschild metric at @xmath5 ( the past one is in a part of schwarzschild not relevant in collapse ) .",
    "points of the future one with @xmath37 are just as in schwarzschild , while points with @xmath38 are as in vaidya .",
    "our main interest is in points with @xmath34 , and the approach to them along different radial null directions .",
    "when approached from the past like this , the last part of the approach is solely through the part of the metric which is ingoing vaidya ; approach from the future is through flat space ; therefore we do nt need to calculate with the part of the metric which is outgoing vaidya , and so the details of @xmath15 do nt affect our calculation .    the ingoing vaidya metric is [ v1 ] ds^2=(1-)dv^2 - 2dvdr - r^2(d^2+^2d^2 ) and , although we sha nt need it , the outgoing vaidya metric is [ v2 ] ds^2=(1-)du^2 + 2dudr - r^2(d^2+^2d^2 ) we choose the following newman - penrose ( np ) tetrad for the ingoing vaidya metric : [ np1 ] d=_v+12(1-)_r,=-_r , @xmath39 so that @xmath40 is outgoing into the future and @xmath41 is ingoing . now calculate , using the np formalism [ np3 ] d^a=2^a , dn^a=-2n^a , and [ np4 ] ^a=0,n^a=0 , where [ np33 ] = .",
