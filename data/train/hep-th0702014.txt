    "the subcritical and supercritical phases describe 2d isotropic ordinary and exotic oscillators , whose spectra are characterized , respectively , by additional so(3 ) rotational and so(2,1 ) lorentz symmetry .",
    "these two phases are separated by the critical phase corresponding to a one - mode oscillator , and are related by a duality transformation .",
    "we demonstrate that in the flat limit the system transforms into a free galilean exotic particle on the noncommutative plane . for the obtained system we construct wave equations carrying projective representations of the exotic newton - hooke symmetry .",
    "we find the projective phase related to the nontrivial cohomology of the exotic nh symmetry , which , being associated with quasi invariance of the lagrangian under finite nh transformations , guarantees invariance of the wave equations .",

    "indeed , the ads@xmath3 structure underlies the btz black hole @xcite , which also reveals different phases in dependence on the values of its mass and angular momentum .",

    "if such a relation really exists , it would be interesting to clarify , in particular , what in btz black hole physics should correspond to the duality of the exotic newton - hooke particle system .",
