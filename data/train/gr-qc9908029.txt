    "the equations of general relativity relate the geometry of a spacetime manifold to its matter content . given a geometry one can find the distribution of mass - energy and momenta that support it . unless there are restrictions on the features that the matter content can possess",
    ", general relativity allows the existence of spacetime geometries in which apparently distant regions of space are close to each other through wormhole connections .",
    "the existence or not of traversable wormhole geometries has many implications that could change our way of looking at the structure of spacetime ( see @xcite for a survey and bibliography on the subject ) .",
    "the analysis of m.  morris and k.  thorne @xcite regarding traversable wormhole geometries showed that , in order for the flaring out of geodesics characteristic of a lorentzian wormhole throat to happen , it is necessary that the matter that supports the wormhole throat be peculiar : it has to violate the null energy condition ( nec ) @xcite .",
    "that is to say , even a null geodesic observer would see negative energy densities on passing the throat .",
    "this analysis was originally done with static spherically symmetric configurations , but the nec violation is a generic property of an arbitrary wormhole throat @xcite .",
    "it is often ( mistakenly ) thought that classical matter always satisfies nec .",
    "by contrast , in the quantum regime there are well - known situations in which nec violations can easily be obtained @xcite .",
    "for this reason , most investigations regarding wormhole physics are developed within the realm of semiclassical gravity , where the expectation value of the quantum energy - momentum tensor is used as the source for the gravitational field @xcite .",
    "however , one can easily see that the energy - momentum tensor of a scalar field conformally coupled to gravity can violate nec even at the classical level @xcite .",
    "we would like to highlight that this energy - momentum tensor is the most natural one for a scalar field at low energies ( energies well below the planck scale , or any other scale below which a scalar field theory might become non - renormalizable ) , because its matrix elements are finite in every order of renormalized perturbation theory @xcite .",
    "in flat spacetime , this energy - momentum tensor defines the same four - momentum and lorentz generators as that associated with a minimally coupled scalar field and , in fact , it was first constructed as an improvement of the latter @xcite .",
    "thus , we wish to focus attention on the so - called `` new improved energy - momentum tensor '' of particle physics . at higher energies , still well below the planck scale ,",
    "there may also be other forms of classical violations of the nec , such as higher derivative theories @xcite , brans  dicke theory @xcite , or even more exotic possibilities . in this paper",
    ", we will concentrate on the massless conformally coupled scalar field",
    ". we will explicitly show that it can provide us with the flaring out condition characteristic of traversable wormholes .",
    "we have analytically solved the einstein equations for static and spherically symmetric geometries .",
    "we find a three - parameter class of exact solutions .",
    "these solutions include the schwarzschild geometry , certain naked singularities , and a collection of traversable wormholes .",
    "however , in all these wormhole geometries the effective newton s constant has a different sign in the two asymptotic regions .",
    "at the end of the paper we will briefly discuss some ways of escaping from this somewhat disconcerting conclusion .",
    "in this section , we will describe the exact solutions to the combined system of equations for einstein gravity and a massless conformally coupled scalar field , in the simple case of static and spherically symmetric configurations .",
    "the einstein equations can be written as @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the einstein tensor , with @xmath2 the ricci tensor and @xmath3 the scalar curvature .",
    "@xmath4 is the energy - momentum tensor of the matter field , and @xmath5 , with @xmath6 denoting newton s constant . for a massless conformal scalar field @xmath7 , the energy - momentum tensor acquires the form @xcite @xmath8,\\ ] ] with the field satisfying the equation @xmath9",
    "this is the generalization to curved spacetime of the `` new improved energy - momentum tensor '' more usually invoked in a particle physics context @xcite .",
    "the key feature of the energy - momentum tensor for a conformal field is that it is traceless , @xmath10 , and therefore @xmath11 .",
    "for this reason , we can write the coupled einstein plus _ conformal _ scalar field equations as @xmath12 we are interested in static and spherically symmetric solutions of these equations . in order to find these solutions , we will start by looking for metrics conformally related to the janis",
    "winicour  wyman ( jnww ) @xcite static spherically symmetric solutions of the einstein _ minimally coupled _",
    "massless scalar field equations : @xmath13 the jnww solutions can be expressed @xcite as @xmath14 the jnww solutions possess obvious symmetries under @xmath15 , ( with @xmath16 ) .",
    "less obvious is that by making a coordinate transformation @xmath17 , one uncovers an additional symmetry under @xmath18 , ( with @xmath19 ) . in view of these symmetries",
    "one can without loss of generality take @xmath20 and @xmath21 $ ] .",
    "similar symmetries will be encountered for conformally coupled scalars . ] ] the requirement that a metric conformal to the jnww metric , @xmath22 with @xmath23 the conformal factor , have a zero scalar curvature [ necessary if it has to be solution of the system of equations ( [ 00 ] ) ] , easily provides a second - order differential equation for the conformal factor as a function of @xmath24 : @xmath25 its solutions can be parametrized in the form @xmath26 with @xmath27 and @xmath28 two real constants .",
    "the equation @xmath29 can now be integrated yielding @xmath30 + b,\\ ] ] where @xmath31 and @xmath32 are two additional integration constants .    in order that the metric and conformal scalar field just found",
    "be solutions of the whole set of equations ( [ 00 ] ) , the four integration constants , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath31 , and @xmath32 , must be inter - related in a specific way .",
    "after a little algebra the equation for the @xmath33 component in ( [ 00 ] ) implies the following relations and the @xmath33 component @xmath34 to guarantee a solution of the entire tensor equation . ]",
    "@xmath35 therefore , we have two options :    _ case i _ ) @xmath36 , @xmath37 ; + @xmath38.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    _ case ii _ ) @xmath39 , @xmath40 ; @xmath41 notice that these two branches of solutions intersect when either @xmath27 or @xmath28 are equal to zero .",
    "the set of solutions we have found is a generalization of the solutions found by froyland @xcite , and some time later by agnese and la camera @xcite .",
    "indeed , in the case @xmath42 the conformal factor becomes @xmath43 , ( we drop a unimportant constant factor ) , and the field @xmath44 , in agreement with the expression given by agnese and la camera .",
    "the froyland solution is in fact identical to that of agnese  la camera though this is not obvious because froyland chose to work in schwarzschild coordinates .",
    "because of this , froyland could only provide an implicit ( rather than explicit ) solution . , which in schwarzschild coordinates is not analytically invertible to provide @xmath45 .",
    "the coordinate system chosen by agnese and la camera is much better behaved in this regard and @xmath46 can be explicitly calculated as we have seen above .",
    "the trade - off is that whereas @xmath47 can be written down explicitly , there is no way of analytically inverting this function to get @xmath48 . ]",
    "let us now analyze the different behaviours of these solutions .",
    "for this task , it is convenient to look at the conformal factor as a function of @xmath49 , @xmath50 in the same way , as a function of @xmath49 , the schwarzschild radial coordinate @xmath51 has the form @xmath52    if we define an angle @xmath53 by @xmath54 , then the domain @xmath55 $ ] exhausts all possible metric configurations , as a constant overall factor in the metric can be absorbed in the definition of coordinates .",
    "we have a three - parameter family of solutions depending on @xmath56 , the angle @xmath53 , and the angle @xmath57 $ ] . in fig .",
    "1 we have drawn the parameter space as a square . indeed , parallel edges are identified , so the parameter space is an orbifold ( a two - torus subjected to symmetry identifications ) . in fact , the solution space is invariant if we change @xmath58 to @xmath59 .",
    "furthermore , the coordinate transformation @xmath60 can now be used to deduce an invariance under @xmath61 .",
    "combining the two symmetries , we deduce an invariance under @xmath62 . thus without loss of generality",
    "we only have to deal with the region @xmath63 with @xmath64 $ ] . also , we need only consider the geometries in which @xmath65 because , for that value , the geometries do not have an asymptotic flat region when @xmath49 approaches infinity . \\ ; { \\sin\\chi\\over\\sqrt{3 } } \\right).\\ ] ] we note that this scale length is invariant under all the symmetries mentioned above ( as it must be ) .",
    "the effective newton constant is @xmath66 thus @xmath67 , @xmath68 , and @xmath69 are separately invariants of the symmetries discussed above . for the objectional value @xmath70 , the lack of an asymptotically flat region is reflected in an infinite physical mass . ]    for the rest of parameter space , an analysis when @xmath49 approaches @xmath71 of the behaviour of the @xmath33 component of the ricci tensor ( @xmath72 in an orthonormal coordinate basis ) shows that it diverges for every point in parameter space except when @xmath73 , @xmath74 , @xmath75 , or @xmath76 .",
    "thus , except for these parameter values , we have geometries with a naked curvature singularity at @xmath77 .    among these singular geometries ,",
    "those with @xmath78 and @xmath79 deserve additional attention . for them , the schwarzschild radial coordinate blows up when approaching @xmath77 .",
    "they are geometries with wormhole shape , but with something `` strange '' in the other `` asymptotic '' region .",
    "we can easily check that the proper radial distance between every point @xmath80 and @xmath77 is finite .",
    "also the proper volume beyond every sphere at finite @xmath80 is itself finite , even though the proper area of the spherical sections diverges as one approaches @xmath77 .",
    "therefore , although one certainly encounters a flare - out ( a wormhole throat ) before reaching @xmath77 , we can not speak properly of another asymptotic region .",
    "the first non singular case is @xmath73 . in this case",
    "we recover the schwarzschild black hole geometry .",
    "this geometry , of course , does not have a curvature singularity at @xmath77 , just a coordinate singularity .",
    "it is instead singular at @xmath81 .",
    "for the special cases @xmath82 there exist situations in which the schwarzschild radial coordinate @xmath51 and the gravitational potential @xmath83 go to non - zero constants when approaching @xmath77 .",
    "this suggests that we might be able to extend the geometry beyond @xmath77 .",
    "we leave for the next section the analysis of how this extension can be done , showing that there exist genuine wormhole solutions .    in the case",
    "@xmath84 we can write the metric as @xmath85 writing @xmath86 , so that @xmath87 a brief calculation shows that this geometry is also singular at @xmath88 , @xmath77 , even though @xmath72 remains finite there .",
    "( the other ricci components , @xmath89 and @xmath90 , diverge as @xmath91 . )",
    "finally , the case @xmath76 corresponds to a negative mass schwarzschild geometry .",
    "it has a naked curvature singularity at @xmath77 , but after the coordinate change @xmath92 , the naked curvature singularity moves to @xmath88 , and the character of the geometry becomes obvious .",
    "this section is devoted to the analysis of the case @xmath93 . for this task ,",
    "it is convenient to change to isotropic coordinates @xmath94 with the new radial coordinate running from @xmath95 to @xmath96 we cover the same portion of the metric manifold that @xmath97 did before .",
    "however , can the manifold be analytically extended beyond @xmath95 ?",
    "the answer is yes . we can write the metric in isotropic coordinates as @xmath98 ^ 2 \\left [ - dt^2 + \\left ( 1+{\\eta \\over 2   \\bar r }    \\right)^4 [ d{\\bar r}^2 + { \\bar r}^2 ( d\\theta^2+\\sin^2\\theta \\ ; d\\phi^2 ) ]       \\right ] , \\label{wormholes}\\ ] ] noticing that it is perfectly well behaved at @xmath99 .",
    "we want to point out that for @xmath100 the conformal factor @xmath101 is real and negative , while the jnww solution is ill - behaved in the sense that the metric @xmath102 has opposite signature to the usual .",
    "nevertheless , the metric @xmath103 is perfectly well behaved .",
    "thus , strictly speaking , only the region @xmath104 is conformally related with its corresponding jnww solution .    among these solutions , in those with @xmath105 the schwarzschild radial coordinate @xmath106 reaches a minimum value at @xmath107 , and comes back to infinity at @xmath108 , showing up as another asymptotically flat region . as well as this",
    ", the @xmath33 component of the metric is everywhere non - zero .",
    "therefore , the region in parameter space @xmath109 represents genuine traversable wormhole solutions , with the throat of the wormhole being located at @xmath107 . for completeness , in the solution with @xmath110 , @xmath106 reaches a minimum at @xmath108 , but this sphere is at a infinite proper distance from every other @xmath111 so we can conclude that this geometry is a `` cornucopia '' ( tube without end ) .",
    "( @xmath112 represents the reversed cornucopia with no asymptotic region at @xmath113 ) . for the remaining values of @xmath114 the geometry pinches off ( the conformal prefactor in equation ( [ wormholes ] ) goes to zero ) at finite positive radius @xmath115 .",
    "we have seen that a scalar field coupled conformally to gravity can support wormhole geometries . on these wormhole configurations",
    "the conformal scalar field takes the following form @xmath116 it is a monotonically increasing or decreasing function ( depending on the overall sign ) between one asymptotic region and the other , taking the values @xmath117 this monotonic behaviour for the scalar field causes an asymmetry between the asymptotic regions .",
    "in fact , we can realize of the real importance of this asymmetry by looking at the effective newton s constant , @xmath118 , that can be defined on these systems .",
    "it not only reaches a different value on each asymptotic region , @xmath119 it also reaches a different _ sign_. from the point of view of the asymptotic region with a positive effective newton s constant , the wormhole throat is located in the region in which @xmath120 has already changed its sign .",
    "this asymmetry is reflected also in the values of the asymptotic masses measured on the two sides of the wormhole throat .",
    "the scale lengths are @xmath121 the observers in the asymptotic region with a positive @xmath120 see a positive asymptotic mass , while those in the other asymptotic region see a negative @xmath120 and a positive asymptotic mass .",
    "the case @xmath122 corresponds to @xmath123 , so @xmath124 ,   \\label{symwh } \\\\ & & \\hspace{3cm}\\phi_c=\\pm \\sqrt{6 \\kappa}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this describes a limiting symmetric wormhole with an everywhere zero effective newton s constant and both asymptotic masses equal to zero .",
    "these asymmetric features are disappointing because we would like to have wormholes connecting equivalent regions of space . at this point",
    "we have to say that while a conformal scalar field can provide us with the `` flaring out '' condition for geodesics , it has the drawback of reversing the sign of the effective newton s constant in the other asymptotic region .",
    "we have found that , among the classical solutions of general relativity coupled to a massless conformal scalar field there exist genuine lorentzian traversable wormhole geometries .",
    "although perfectly well behaved from a geometrical point of view , they are asymmetric in the sense that the effective newton s constant has a different sign in each asymptotic region .    inspecting the expression for the laplacian of a scalar field in a static and spherically symmetric geometry @xmath125,\\ ] ]",
    "we see that in order for the scalar field to be able to change its monotonic behaviour in a non - singular geometry , there must be some points at which @xmath126 .",
    "this suggests that in more general situations that those analyzed in this paper we could find traversable wormhole solutions with no asymmetry between the asymptotic regions .",
    "for example , if we add to our system a quantity of normal matter with a positive trace for the energy - momentum tensor ( @xmath127 ) , and we place this normal matter in two thin spherical shells ( see fig .",
    "2 ) , we can join smoothly an inner region with the geometry of the symmetric wormhole solution ( [ symwh ] ) to two outer asymptotic geometries , both with positive effective newton s constants .",
    "the requirement that @xmath127 in the shells translates into a localized negative scalar curvature , @xmath128 , necessary for bringing down the value of the scalar field from that in the inner region .    finally , we conclude by emphasising that it is not so much the occurrence of classical wormholes in and of themselves that is the main surprise of this paper .",
    "rather , what is truly surprising here is that such an inoffensive and physically well - motivated classical source , the `` new improved stress - energy tensor '' , leads to classical traversable wormholes .",
