    "in the last few years many efforts have been made to understand the origin of the cosmic x - ray background ( cxb ) , discovered more than 35 years ago by giacconi et al .",
    "one of the competing hypotheses - the truly diffuse emission origin ( see e.g. guilbert and fabian , 1986 ) - has been rejected by the small deviation of the cosmic microwave background spectrum from a blackbody shape ( mather et al . , 1994 ) .",
    "therefore only the alternative interpretation - the discrete sources origin - is left .",
    "indeed , rosat deep surveys , reaching a source density of @xmath14 deg@xmath15 at a limiting flux of @xmath16 ( hasinger et al . , 1998 ; mchardy et al . ,",
    "1998 ) , have already resolved the majority ( 70@xmath1780 % ) of the soft ( @xmath18 kev ) cxb into discrete sources .",
    "spectroscopic observations ( shanks et al . , 1991 ; boyle et al . , 1993 , 1994 ; mchardy et al . , 1998 ; schmidt et al",
    ". , 1998 ) of the sources with fluxes greater than @xmath19",
    "have shown that the majority ( @xmath20 % ) of these objects are broad line agn at @xmath21 .",
    "an important minority ( @xmath22 % ) of rosat sources are spectroscopically identified with x - ray luminous narrow emission line galaxies ( griffiths et al . , 1995 , 1996 ; mchardy et al . , 1998 ) ,",
    "whose real physical nature ( obscured agn , starburst ) is at the moment debated in the literature ( see e.g. schmidt et al . , 1998 ) . since their average x - ray spectrum is harder than that of the broad line agns ( almaini et al .",
    ", 1996 ; romero - colmenero et al . ,",
    "1996 ) and similar to that of the remaining unresolved cxb , these objects could also be substantial contributors to the cxb at higher energies .",
    "about 10% of the rosat sources are identified with clusters of galaxies ( see e.g. rosati et al.,1998 ) .",
    "thus , it is clear that the rosat satellite has been successful in resolving almost all the soft cxb into discrete sources .",
    "furthermore , optical observations of the faint rosat sources has lead to the understanding of the physical nature of the objects contributing to it .    on the contrary , at harder energies , closer to where the bulk of the cxb resides ,",
    "the origin of the cxb is still matter of debate . before the asca and beppo - sax satellites , which carry the first long lived imaging instruments in the 2 - 10 kev energy band",
    ", surveys in this energy range were made using passively collimated x - ray detectors that , because of their limited spatial resolution , allowed the identification of the brightest x - ray sources only , which represent a very small fraction ( @xmath23 ) of the cxb ( piccinotti et al . , 1982 ) .",
    "the so called  spectral paradox \" further complicates the situation : none of the single classes of x - ray emitters in the piccinotti et al . , ( 1982 ) sample is characterized by an energy spectral distribution similar to that of the cxb . due to the lack of faint ,",
    "large and complete samples of x - ray sources selected in this energy range , the contribution of the different classes of sources to the hard cxb was evaluated through population synthesis models and different classes of x - ray sources were proposed as the major contributors by a number of authors ( e.g. starburst galaxies , absorbed agn , reflection dominated agn , see e.g. griffiths and padovani , 1990 ; madau , ghisellini and fabian , 1994 ; comastri et al . , 1995 ; zdziarski et al . , 1993 ) .",
    "recent results from asca and beppo - sax observations of individual objects and/or medium - deep survey programs ( bassani et al .",

    "; boyle et al . , 1998a ; 1998b ; akiyama et al . , 1998 ) seem to favor the strongly absorbed agn hypothesis but deeper investigations are still needed to confirm this scenario .    at the _ osservatorio astronomico di brera _ , a serendipitous search for hard ( 2 - 10 kev band ) x - ray sources using data from the gis2 instrument onboard the asca satellite is in progress ( cagnoni , della ceca and maccacaro 1998 , hereafter paper i ; della ceca et al .",
    "1999 , in preparation ) with the aim of extending to faint fluxes the census of the x - ray sources shining in the hard x - ray sky .",
    "the strategy of the survey , the images and sources selection criteria and the definition of the sky coverage are discussed in cagnoni , della ceca and maccacaro ( 1998 ) .    in paper i , a first sample of 60 serendipitous x - ray sources , detected in 87 gis2 images at high galactic latitude ( @xmath24 ) covering @xmath25 square deg . was presented .",
    "this sample has allowed the authors to extend the description of the number - counts relationship down to a flux limit of @xmath26 ( the faintest detectable flux ) , resolving * directly * about 27% of the ( 2 - 10 kev ) cxb .    here",
    "we study the spectral properties of the 60 asca sources listed in paper i , combining gis2 and gis3 data .",
    "we have carried out both an analysis of the  stacked \" spectra of the sources in order to investigate the variation of the source s average spectral properties as a function of the flux , and a  hardness - ratio \" ( hr ) analysis of the single sources .",
    "this latter method , which is equivalent to the  color - color \" analysis largely used at optical wavelengths , is particularly appropriate when dealing with sources detected at a low signal - to - noise ratio ( e.g. maccacaro et al .",
    ", 1988 ; netzer , turner and george , 1994 ) .",
    "we have defined two independent hr and we have compared the position of the sources in the hr diagram with a grid of theoretical spectral models which are found to describe the x - ray properties of known classes of x - ray emitters .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we present the sample and we define the `` faint '' and the `` bright '' subsamples . in section 3",
    "we present the data , we discuss the data analysis and we define the two hr used . in section 4",
    "we report the results of the stacked spectra and of the hr analysis and we compare them with those expected from simple spectral models and with the cxb spectra .",
    "summary and conclusions are presented in section 5 .",
    "the basic data on the 60 x - ray sources used in this paper are reported in table 2 of paper i.    to investigate if the spectral properties of the sources depend on their brightness we have defined two subsamples according to the `` corrected '' 2 - 10 kev count rate ( hereafter ccr ) .",
    "this value is appropriate for a power law model with energy spectral index of 0.7 , filtered by a galactic absorbing column density of @xmath27 cm@xmath15 . ] .",
    "the 20 brightest sources ( ccr @xmath29 ) define the  bright \" subsample , while the remaining 40 sources define the  faint \" subsample .",
    "the dividing line of @xmath7 corrisponds to an unabsorbed 2 - 10 kev flux of @xmath30 or @xmath9 for a source described by a power law model with energy spectral index of 0.0 and 2.0 , respectively absorbed by a galactic column density of @xmath27 cm@xmath15 .",
    "we note that the numbers reported above are a very weak function of the galactic absorbing column density along the line of sight ( which ranges from @xmath31 cm@xmath15 to @xmath32 cm@xmath15 for the present sample ) .",
    "we prefer to use the ccr instead of the flux because the ccr is ( once the corrections due to the vignetting and the psf have been applied ) an _ observed _ quantity and it is independent on the spectral properties of the source ; on the contrary the flux is model dependent . in first approximation fainter",
    "ccr corresponds to fainter sources .",
    "all the asca images used in paper i are now in  rev 2 \" processing status ( see http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/asca/ascarev2.html ) , thus in this paper we have used this new revision of the data .",
    "furthermore , in order to improve the statistics , we have combined data from the gis2 and gis3 instruments as explained below .",
    "data preparation has been done using version 1.3 of the xselect software package and version 4.0 of ftools ( supplied by the heasarc at the goddard space flight center ) .",
    "good time intervals were selected applying the  standard rev 2 screening \" criteria ( as reported in chapter 5 of the asca data reduction guide , rev 2.0 ) , with the only exception of having used a magnetic cutoff rigidity threshold of 6 gev c@xmath33 ( as done in paper i ) .",
    "high , medium and low bit rate data were combined together .",
    "spectral analysis ( see below ) has been performed using version 9.0 of the xspec software package .",
    "we use the detector redistribution matrix files ( rmf ) gis2v4_0.rmf and gis3v4_0.rmf .      for each source and for the gis2 and gis3 data sets ,",
    "total counts ( source + background ) were extracted from a circular extraction region of 2 arcmin radius around the source centroid .",
    "background counts were taken from two circular uncontaminated regions of 3.5 arcmin radius , close to the source , or symmetrically located with respect of the center of the image .",
    "source and background data were extracted in the  pulse invariant \" ( pi ) energy channels , which have been corrected for spatial and temporal variations of the detector gain .",
    "the ancillary response file ( arf ) relative to each source was created with version 2.72 of the ftools task ascaarf at the location of the individual sources in the detectors .    for each source",
    "we have then produced a combined gis spectrum ( adding gis2 and gis3 data ) and the corresponding background and response matrix files , following the recipe given in the asca data reduction ( rev 2.0 ) guide ( see section 8.9.2 and 8.9.3 and reference therein ) . finally , we have produced the combined spectrum of a ) the 20 sources belonging to the bright sample and b ) the 40 sources of the faint sample .",
    "we note that each object contributes to the stacked counts at most for 6% in the case of the faint sample and at most for 25% in the case of the bright sample .    in the spectral analysis , being interested in comparing these stacked spectra with that of the hard cxb , we have considered only the counts in the 2.0 - 10.0 kev energy range .",
    "the total net counts in the bright and faint sample are about 3400 and 2900 respectively .",
    "the stacked spectra were rebinned to give at least 50 total counts per bin .      for each source and for the gis2 and gis3 data set ,",
    "source plus background counts were extracted in three energy bands : 0.7 - 2.0 kev ( s band ) , 2.0 - 4.0 kev ( m band ) and 4.0 - 10.0 kev ( h band ) .",
    "the s , m and h spectral regions were selected so as to have similar statistics in each band for the majority of the sources .",
    "the background counts have been evaluated by using the two background regions considered above ; first , we have normalized the background counts to the source extraction region and then we have averaged them .",
    "net counts in s , m and h have been then obtained for each source by subtracting the corresponding s , m and h normalized background counts from the total ones .    to combine the gis2 and gis3 data for each source and to compare our results with those expected from simple models ,",
    "the net counts obtained must be corrected for the position dependent sensitivity of the gis detectors ( see the discussion in section 2.3 of paper i ) .",
    "in particular we must : a ) define a source extraction region and a reference position in the gis2 or gis3 field ; b ) re - normalize the s , m , h net counts from each source to this region ( since sources are detected in different locations of the gis2 or gis3 field of view ) ; c ) perform the simulations for simple models by using the effective area of this region .",
    "we will now discuss these points in turn .    as reference region",
    "we have used a source extraction region of 2 arcmin radius at the position x=137 , y=116 for the ( xrt + gis2 ) combination .",
    "using ascaarf we have produced the effective area values at the position of each source detected in the gis2 ( gis3 ) detector . using these effective area values and through spectral simulations with xspec",
    "we have derived the correction factors to be applied to each source in the s , m and h band . for each source",
    "we have then applied these correction factors to the net counts of gis2 and gis3 separately .",
    "finally , we have combined the gis2 and gis3 corrected net counts for each source . in summary , using this procedure we have first re - normalized the gis2 and gis3 data for each source to the reference region separately and then combined them .",
    "we note that the applied method is very similar to the ",
    "flat field \" procedure normally used in the analysis of optical imaging and spectroscopic data .    using the corrected net counts in the s , m and h band we",
    "have then computed for each source two  hardness ratios \" defined in the following way : @xmath34    the 68% error bars on hr1 and hr2 have been obtained via monte carlo simulations using the total counts , the background counts and the correction factors relative to each source .",
    "similarly , hr1 and hr2 values expected from simple spectral models ( see section 4 ) have been obtained with xspec using the effective area of the reference region .",
    "in this section we discuss the hard ( 2 - 10 kev ) x - ray average spectrum of the present sample and we compare it with that of the cxb ; to this end we use the hr2 values and the  stacked \" spectra introduced in section 3 .    in figure 1 , for all sources , we plot the hr2 value versus the gis2 ccr ; the filled squares represent the sources detected with a signal to noise ratio greater than 4.0 while the open squares represent the sources detected with a signal to noise ratio between 3.5 and 4.0 .",
    "the hr2 values are then compared with those expected from a non absorbed power - law model with energy spectral index @xmath35 ( @xmath36 ) ranging from @xmath171.0 to 2.0 .",
    "figure 1 clearly shows a broadening of the hr2 distribution going to fainter ccr ; furthermore a flattening of the mean spectrum with decreasing fluxes is evident . a similar broadening and flattening of the hr2 distribution",
    "is still detected if only the 40 sources ( 18 bright and 22 faint ) detected with a signal to noise ratio greater than 4.0 are used , showing that this result is not due to the sources near the detection threshold limit .",
    "it is worth noting the presence of many sources which seem to be characterized by a very flat 2 - 10 kev spectrum with @xmath37 and of a number of sources with  inverted \" spectra ( i.e. @xmath38 ) .",
    "this is particularly evident in the faint sample where about half of the sources seem to be described by @xmath37 and about 30% by  inverted \" spectra .",
    "these latter objects could represent a new population of very hard serendipitous sources or , alternatively , a population of very absorbed sources as expected from the cxb synthesis models based on the agn unification scheme .",
    "we have checked whether the observed hardening of the mean spectral index can be attributed to a spectral bias in the source s selection . since sources with the same flux but",
    "different spectrum will deposit a different number of counts in the detector , it is evident that , as one approaches the flux limit of a survey , sources with a _",
    "favourable _ spectrum will be detected ( and thus included in the sample ) , while sources with an _ unfavourable _ spectrum will become increasingly under - represented ( see zamorani et al . , 1988 for a discussion of this effect ) .",
    "however , in the case of the asca / gis , this selection effect favours the detection of steep sources , thus giving further support to the reality of our findings",
    ". characterized by an absorbed power - law spectrum with @xmath39 and @xmath40 will deposit ( at the reference position and inside a region of 2 arcmin radius ) @xmath41 ( 2 - 10 ) kev counts while a source with the same flux but power - law spectrum with @xmath42 and same @xmath43 will deposit @xmath44 counts . ]",
    "we note that a population of very hard x - ray sources has been recently suggested also by giommi et al . ,",
    "1998 in order to explain the spectral properties of the faint bepposax sources and to reconcile the 2 - 10 kev logn(@xmath2s)logs with the 5 - 10 kev logn(@xmath2s)logs obtained from bepposax data .    to further investigate the flattening of the source s mean spectral index we have used the",
    " stacked \" spectra introduced in section 3.1 .    in table 1",
    "we report the results of the power - law fits to the stacked spectra of the faint and the bright sample ; the unfolded spectra of the two samples are shown in figure 2 ( bright sample : open squares ; faint sample : filled squares ) .",
    "as can be seen from the @xmath45 values reported in table 1 and from the spectra shown in figure 2 , a simple power - law spectral model represents a good description of the stacked spectra of the two samples in the 2 - 10 kev energy range .",
    "the @xmath43 values corresponding to the mean line of sight galactic absorption for the two independent samples have been used in the fits .",
    "however , given the energy range of interest ( 2.0 - 10.0 kev ) , the spectra are not significantly affected by the galactic @xmath43 value .",
    "consistent results are obtained if we use either the lowest or highest ( @xmath46 cm@xmath15 or @xmath47 cm@xmath15 respectively ) galactic @xmath43 value sampled in the present survey .    it is worth noting that the unfolded spectra of the faint and the bright sample reported in figure 2 does not show any compelling evidence of emission lines .",
    "a strong emission line should be expected if , for example , sources with a strong iron emission line at 6.4 kev , contributing in a substantial way to the cxb , were strongly clustered at some particular redshift .",
    "this subject has been already discussed by gilli et al . , 1999 , reaching the conclusion that the maximum contribution of the iron line to the cxb is less than few percent .",
    "the unfolded spectra shown in figure 2 confirm their results .    in figure 3",
    "the results obtained here are compared with those obtained using data from other satellites or from other asca medium - deep survey programs .",
    "the best - fit energy index of the bright sample ( @xmath48 ) is in good agreement with the mean spectral properties of the objects in the ginga and heao1 a-2 sample and with the mean spectral properties of the broad line agns detected by rosat ( almaini et al . , 1996 ; romero - colmenero et al . ,",
    "the faint sample is best described by @xmath6 ; this is consistent with other asca results ( ueda et al .",
    ", 1998 ) and with the spectra of the cxb in the 2 - 10 kev energy range ( marshall et al . , 1980 ; gendreau et al . ,",
    "for the purpose of figure 3 we have used a count rate to flux conversion factor adeguate for a power law spectral model with @xmath49 ( faint sample ) or @xmath50 ( bright sample ) .",
    "we have evaluated the influence that the sources with the hardest energy distribution have on the combined spectra .",
    "if we exclude the 6 sources with hr2@xmath20.2 ( 5 from the faint sample and 1 from the bright sample ) we find that the combined spectra are still significantly different , being described by a power - law model with @xmath51 and @xmath52 respectively .",
    "finally , in the case of the bright sample two sources contribute about 35% of the total counts ; if we exclude these two objects the remaining stacked spectrum is described by a power - law model with @xmath53 , showing that the inclusion or the exclusion of these two objects do not change any af our results .",
    "note that in the case of the faint sample each object contributes to the stacked counts at most for 6% or less .",
    "these results clearly show that : a ) we have detected a flattening of the source s mean spectral properties toward fainter fluxes and b ) we are beginning to detect those x - ray sources having a combined x - ray spectra , consistent with that of the 2 - 10 kev cxb .      in this section",
    "we do not intend to derive specific spectral properties and/or parameters for each source ; the limited statistics and the complexity of agns broad band x - ray spectra ( see mushotzky , done and pounds , 1993 for a review of the subject ) prevent us from doing so .",
    "rather we regard this sample as representative of the hard x - ray sky and we try to investigate if the currently popular cxb synthesis models based on the agns unification scheme can describe the overall spectral properties of the asca sample as inferred from the hardness ratios . according to the agns unification model for the synthesis of the cxb , a population of unabsorbed ( type 1 : @xmath54 cm@xmath15 ) and absorbed ( type 2 : @xmath55 cm@xmath15 ) agns can reproduce the shape and intensity of the cxb from several kev to @xmath11 100 kev ( see madau , ghisellini and fabian , 1994 ; comastri et al . , 1995 ; maiolino et al . , 1998b ) .",
    "because @xmath56 of the asca sources in this sample are expected to be agns ( see paper i ) , in the following we will consider this sample as being well approximated by a population of ( type 1 + type 2 ) agns with flux above @xmath0 .    in figure 4",
    "we show ( open squares ) the position of the sources in the  hardness ratio \" diagram for the faint ( panel a ) and bright ( panel b ) sample ; in figure 4c we have reported the 12 sources spectroscopically identified so far ( see footnote 8) . also reported in figure 4a , b , c ( solid lines ) are the loci expected from x - ray spectra described by an absorbed power law model .",
    "the energy index of the power law ranges from @xmath171.0 up to 2.0 , while the absorbing column densities ranges from @xmath31 cm@xmath15 up to @xmath57 cm@xmath15 ( see figure 4d ) ; the absorption has been assumed to be at zero redshift ( i.e. the sources are supposed to be in the local universe ) .",
    "figure 4 clearly shows how the  hardness ratio \" diagram , combined with spectral simulations , can be used to obtain information on the sources x - ray spectral properties , as well as the power of using two hardness ratios to investigate the broad band spectral properties of the sources .",
    "if only one ratio is known , say hr2 for example , a source with hr2 @xmath58 could be described by an absorbed power law with either energy index of 0.0 and @xmath43 = 10@xmath59 cm@xmath15 or energy index of @xmath60 2.0 and @xmath43 = 10@xmath61 cm@xmath15 .",
    "the use of both hr1 and hr2 allows the ambiguity to be solved .",
    "we note that the hardness ratios computed as described in section 3.2 have not be corrected for the different galactic absorbing column density along the line of sight of each source . for the present sample this ranges from @xmath31 cm@xmath15 to @xmath32 cm@xmath15 ;",
    "figure 4 clearly show that this correction is insignificant .",
    "one of the most striking features of figure 4 is the large spread in hr1 and hr2 displayed by the asca sources and the departure from the loci of absorbed , single power law spectra .",
    "this implies that the broad band ( 0.7 - 10 kev ) spectrum of the sources is more complex than the simple model of an absorbed power law .",
    "in particular the asca sources located on the left side of the line representing power laws with @xmath62 10@xmath59 cm@xmath15 ( see figure 4d ) are not explained within the absorbed power - law model .",
    "a similar result is obtained even if the absorbing material is assumed to be at higher redshift e.g. z = 1 or 2 .",
    "we note that the object in figure 4b ( or 4c ) characterized by hr1 @xmath11 0.0 and hr2 @xmath63 ( a1800 + 6638 ; its x - ray flux is @xmath64 ) is spectroscopically identified with the seyfert 2 galaxy ngc 6552 .",
    "the x - ray spectrum of this object ( reynolds et al . , 1994 and fukazawa et al . , 1994 )",
    "is consistent with a model composed of a narrow gaussian line plus an empirical  leaky - absorber \" continuum ; the latter is composed by an absorbed power - law and a non absorbed power law having a common photon index .",
    "fukazawa et al .",
    "( 1994 ) found that the ngc 6552 spectrum requires a photon index of @xmath65 , an absorbing column density of @xmath66 cm@xmath15 , an uncovered fraction of @xmath67 and a narrow gaussian line ( consistent with the @xmath68 iron emission line at 6.4 kev ) having an equivalent width of @xmath60 0.9 kev .",
    "that the simple absorbed power law model is unable to explain the scatter in the hardness ratios is not surprising given the observational evidence that the broad band x - ray spectra of type 1 and , even more , of type 2 agn are complex and affected by several parameters like , for instance , the viewing angle and the torus thickness ( see e.g. turner et al . , 1997 ; turner et al . , 1998 ; maiolino et al .",
    ", 1998a ; bassani et al . , 1999 ) .",
    "in particular , for type 2 agns we could have , as a function of the absorbing column density , one of the following three cases :    \\1 ) @xmath69 cm@xmath15 .",
    "the hard x - ray continuum above a few kev is dominated by the directly - viewed component making the source nucleus visible to the observer and the column density measurable ; the reflected / scattered component is starting to become relevant in the soft energy range . in this case",
    "the observed spectrum is that of an absorbed type 1 agns with some extra flux at low energies ;    \\2 ) @xmath70 cm@xmath15 . in this case both the directly - viewed component and the reflected / scattered component are observed and the resulting spectrum becomes very complex .",
    "\\3 ) @xmath71 cm@xmath15 .",
    "the torus is very thick .",
    "the continuum source is blocked from direct view up to several tens of kev and the observed spectrum is dominated by the scattered / reflected component . in this case the observed continuum is that of a type 1 agns ( in the case of scattering by warm material near the nucleus ) or that of a compton reflected spectrum ( in the case of cold reflection from the torus ) .    given this spectral complexity we have tested the hardness ratios plot against the following simplified agns spectral model composed of :    \\a ) an absorbed power - law spectrum .",
    "this component represents the continuum source , i.e. for an absorbing column density of about @xmath31 cm@xmath15 this represents the  zero \" order continua of a type 1 object ;    \\b ) a non absorbed power - law component , characterized by the same energy spectral index of the absorbed power - law and by a normalization in the range 1 - 10% of that of the absorbed power - law component .",
    "this component represents the scattered fraction ( by warm material ) of the nuclear emission along the line of sight ; theoretical and observational evidence ( see turner et al",
    ". , 1997 and reference therein ) suggest that this scattered fraction is in the range 1 - 10% ;    \\c ) a narrow emission line at 6.4 kev , having an equivalent width of 230 ev for low values of @xmath43 ( @xmath72 cm@xmath15 ) .",
    "this component represents the mean equivalent width of the fe k@xmath73 emission line in seyfert 1 galaxies as determined by nandra et al . ,",
    "1997 using asca data .    in summary ,",
    "the agn spectral model used is : @xmath74 where e is the photon energy , @xmath75 is the energy spectral index , @xmath76 is the energy dependent absorbing cross - section , @xmath77 is the absorbing column density along the line of sight to the nucleus , k is the scattered fraction and @xmath78 is the iron narrow emission line at 6.4 kev .",
    "the above simplified agns spectral model is equivalent to the model used , by fukazawa et al .",
    ", 1994 in the case of ngc 6552 and , by several authors to describe the  first order \" x - ray spectra of seyfert 2 galaxies ( see e.g. turner et al . , 1997 ) .",
    "we have tested this model as a function of @xmath75 , the absorbing column density @xmath77 and the scattered fraction k. figure 5 shows , as an example , the results of the spectral simulations in the case of local sources ( @xmath79 ) with @xmath80 and k = 0.01 ( filled triangles ) or k = 0.1 ( filled circles ) .",
    "the input spectral models for the case k = 0.01 and log@xmath43 = 20 , 22 , 23 , 24 and 24.5 are also shown .",
    "we would like to stress that using this simplified agns spectral model we can go , in a continuous way , from a ",
    "first order \" type 1 spectra to a ",
    "first order \" type 2 spectra only by changing the @xmath43 parameter . in this respect",
    "we note that the equivalent width of the iron narrow emission line at 6.4 kev ( which , as we said , is fixed to 230 ev for @xmath81 cm@xmath15 ) is @xmath82 kev when @xmath83 cm@xmath15 ; this latter value is very similar to that measured in many seyfert 2 galaxies characterized by a similar value of the absorbing column density ( bassani et al . , 1999 ) .",
    "as anticipated at the beginning of this section some qualitative conclusions can be drawn from the results reported in figure 5 .",
    "first of all it appears that in the context of this simplified agn spectral model , and for very high @xmath43 values , we are able to explain the hardness ratios of the objects located on the left side of the dashed line representing unabsorbed power laws .",
    "second , the results reported in figure 5 seem to indicate that many of the latter objects could be characterized by a very high absorbing column density ; if this indication is confirmed by deeper investigation with xmm and axaf , then the number of compton  thick \" systems could be significantly higher than previously estimated . in the meantime",
    "we note that this result is consistent with recent findings obtained by maiolino et al .",
    ", 1998a , bassani et al . , 1999 and risaliti , maiolino and salvati , 1999 by studying the fraction of compton  thick \" systems in a sample of seyfert 2 galaxies observed with bepposax and/or with asca .    finally , to investigate the hardness ratio plot _ in a model independent way",
    ", we have used a comparison sample of nearby ( z@xmath841 ) seyfert 1 and seyfert 2 galaxies pointed at with asca .",
    "this sample was selected from a data set of about 300 asca pointings that were treated in the same manner ( see section 2 ) and that are used to extend the survey presented in cagnoni , della ceca and maccacaro ( 1998 ) . amongst this restricted asca data set we have considered those observations pointed on nearby seyfert 1 and seyfert 2 galaxies ; furthermore , we have considered only the seyfert 2 galaxies also reported in table 1 of bassani et al.,1999 in order to have an uniform data set on their compton thickness .",
    "the comparison sample is composed of 13 seyfert 1 , 15 compton thin seyfert 2 and 7 compton thick seyfert 2 .",
    "the targets were analyzed in the same way as the serendipitous sources , combining the gis2 and gis3 data ( see section 3.2 ) .",
    "the results are shown in figure 6 .",
    "the seyfert 1 galaxies are strongly clustered around the locii representing low @xmath43 values ; on the contrary the seyfert 2 galaxies are characterized by a very large spread in their hr1 , hr2 values . in particular many of the seyfert 2 are located on the left side of the line representing power laws with @xmath81 cm@xmath15 ; about a half of these sources have been classified as compton thick system from bassani et al . , 1999 .",
    "we are tempted to suggest that also the other half are compton thick objects , whose nature is still unrevealed because of the presently poor data quality .",
    "xmm and/or axaf observations are needed to confirm this suggestion . however , whatever their properties ( compton thin or thick ) are , the comparison of figures 6 and figures 4a , b strongly suggest that at least some of the serendipitous asca sources located on the left side of the dashed line connecting the @xmath85 values could be type 2 agns .",
    "in this paper we have used asca gis2 and gis3 data for a complete and well defined sample of 60 hard ( 2 - 10 kev ) selected sources to study the spectral properties of x - ray sources down to a flux limit of @xmath86 . to investigate",
    "if the spectral properties of the sources depend on their brightness we have defined two subsamples according to the `` corrected '' 2 - 10 kev count rate ; the bright sample is defined by the 20 sources with ccr @xmath5 , while the faint sample is defined by the 40 fainter sources .",
    "the dividing line of @xmath7 corrispond to unabsorbed 2 - 10 kev fluxes in the range @xmath8 to @xmath9 for a source described by a power law model with energy spectral index between 0.0 and 2.0 , respectively .",
    "the main results of this investigation are the following :    \\a ) the average ( 2 - 10 kev ) source s spectrum hardens towards fainter fluxes .",
    "the  stacked \" spectra of the sources in the bright sample is well described by a power - law model with an energy spectral index of @xmath87 , while the  stacked \" spectra of the sources in the faint sample require @xmath6 ; this means that we are beginning to detect those sources having a combined x - ray spectrum consistent with that of the 2 - 10 kev cxb .",
    "\\b ) the hardness ratios analysis shows that this flattening is due to the appearance of sources with very hard spectra in the faint sample . about a half of the sources in the latter sample",
    "require @xmath10 while only 10% of the brighter sources are consistent with an energy spectral index so flat . furthermore about 30% of the sources in the faint sample seem to be characterized by `` inverted '' ( @xmath88 ) 2 - 10 kev x - ray spectra .",
    "these latter objects could represent a new population of very hard serendipitous sources or , alternatively , a population of very absorbed sources as expected from the cxb synthesis models based on the agn unification scheme ( see below ) .",
    "\\c ) a simple absorbed power - law model is unable to explain the broad band ( 0.7 - 10 kev ) spectral properties of the sources , as inferred from the hardness ratios diagram .",
    "x - ray spectral models based on the agns unification scheme seem to be able to explain the overall spectral properties of this sample .",
    "this seems also suggested by the comparison of our results with those obtained using a sample of nearby and well known seyfert 1 and seyfert 2 galaxies observed with asca .",
