    "there exist many unresolved fundamental problems in molecular biology and biochemistry and one from them is the problem of long  distance energy transport in biological macromolecules .",
    "it is believed that the energy released by the hydrolysis of adenosine triphosphate ( atp ) appears by an universal energy source allowing many biological processes .",
    "mentioned energy released by the atp hydrolysis may be captured by the protein molecules and excite the high  frequency amide ",
    "i vibration of a peptide group . due to the dipole",
    " dipole coupling between the neighbouring peptide groups the excited amide ",
    "i vibration is delocalized causing formation of the vibron state which , in turn , can move along the polypeptide chain .",
    "however , it is yet not clearly understood how this energy can be transported along macromolecule at long distances , without being dissipated or dispersed .",
    "an earlier explanation of this process is based on the soliton theory @xcite , @xcite , @xcite . according to those models",
    ", a soliton arises due to the self  trapping ( st ) of the amide ",
    "i quanta .",
    "according to the general theory of st phenomena @xcite , st problem exhibits two asymptotic solutions depending on the values of three basic energy parameters of the system : the vibron bandwidth @xmath0 , the phonon characteristic frequency @xmath1 and the sp bending energy @xmath2 ( which is proportional to the strength of the vibron  phonon coupling ) .",
    "thus , in the adiabatic limit ( @xmath3 ) lattice distortion with large inertia can not follow the exciton motion and it forms an essentially static potential well where that particle may be trapped . depending on the value of the mutual ratio of @xmath2 and @xmath4 , the spatial extent of an entity created in this way ( polaron ) may vary from being concentrated around one site only ( @xmath5 ) i.e. adiabatic sp ( asp ) , while in the case when @xmath6 it is spread over the large number of lattice sites and we have adiabatic large polaron ( alp ) or soliton .",
    "by contrast , in non  adiabatic limit ( @xmath7 ) the quantum nature of the phonons plays a crucial role . in such case a vibron is dressed by a virtual cloud of phonons which yields a lattice distortion essentially located on a single site and instantaneously follows the vibron motion .",
    "the vibron dressed by the virtual phonon cloud forms a small polaron ( sp ) whose properties are well described by performing the so  called lang  firsov ( lf ) unitary transformation @xcite . as a consequence ,",
    "conventional sp theories are applicable in the strong  coupling , non  adiabatic limit .",
    "unfortunately , the values of the basic energy parameters in biological macromolecular chains belong to non  adiabatic limit .",
    "for that reason , it has been suggested by some authors @xcite,@xcite , @xcite that vibron self  trapping in hydrogen ",
    "bonded macromolecular chains might result in the formation of a small  polaron , rather than a soliton . from the other side ,",
    "the values of the energy parameters indicate that the strength of vibron  phonon coupling in hydrogen ",
    "bonded macromolecules falls in the weak to intermediate limits @xcite .",
    "in addition , some recent numerical @xcite studies of the st phenomena in hydrogen  bonded macromolecular chains indicate that its proper theoretical description requires an approach that goes beyond the conventional strong  coupling sp theories .",
    "namely , according to results from @xcite it seems that depending on the temperature and the values of the system parameters the abrupt transition from partially dressed ( light and mobile ) to self  trapped ( practically immobile quasi particle ) may occur .",
    "this situation can not be described in the framework of the standard sp approach ( based on using of the lang ",
    "firsov unitary transformation ) and as a consequence its theoretical investigations require the means which involve the concept of partial dressing . this concept is based on modified lang ",
    "firsov ( mlf ) unitary transformation and is applicable in a wide part of system parameter space .",
    "such an approach is considered in a close correspondence with the supplementary variational treatment of the problem by means of the toyozawa ansatz @xcite . in our recent paper @xcite",
    "we used slightly more flexible method in order to investigate the temperature dependence of the sp states character .    in this paper",
    "we consider two variational formalisms based on using of the modified lang ",
    "firsov approach and compare obtained results with ones predicted by the standard sp theory . the variational parameter(s ) introduced here characterizes the degree in which the vibron distorts the lattice and the lattice feedback on the vibron , i.e. vibron dressing .",
    "the first variational approach ( so called `` @xmath8approach '' ) is based on the model used in @xcite , while the second one ( `` @xmath9approach '' ) exploits the method introduced by brown and ivi in @xcite , @xcite in the form used in @xcite .",
    "the last approach intermediates between non - adiabatic and adiabatic limit with use of only one variational parameter . we calculate and",
    "compare the system ground state energies for various basic system parameter values in the case when vibron interacts with both optical and acoustical phonon subsystems .",
    "our attention was restricted to the single ",
    "vibron case .",
    "the system under consideration consists of single vibron excited on @xmath10th structural element of the macromolecule which , in turn , interacts with thermal oscillations of the chain through the linear short  ranged deformation potential interaction .",
    "we suppose that vibron excitation can move along the chain from @xmath10th to its nearest  neighbouring structural element .",
    "the corresponding hamiltonian can be written in the following form @xcite , @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the vibron excitation energy , @xmath13 describes the presence ( absence ) of the vibron quanta on the structural element , which is positioned on @xmath10th lattice site , @xmath14 creates ( annihilates ) phonon quanta , and @xmath15 is the phonon frequency .",
    "the inter ",
    "site overlap integral @xmath16 characterize the vibron transfer between neighbouring structural elements in the chain . finally , @xmath17 is the vibron ",
    "phonon coupling parameter which governs the character of st states .",
    "in order to investigate the vibron self  trapping in macromolecular chains , we shall consider the following quasi particle ",
    "phonon interaction :    1 .",
    "interaction with dispersionless optical phonon modes @xcite,@xcite , @xcite @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the vibron ",
    "phonon coupling constant , which accounts the influence of the external motion of the vibron on the @xmath20th structural elements and on the modulation of the vibron frequency in the @xmath10th structural element , @xmath21 is phonon dispersion law , @xmath22 , @xmath23 appears by the stiffness of the chain , @xmath24 is the molecular group mass ; 2 .",
    "interaction with acoustic phonon modes through the short  ranged deformation potential ( acoustic deformation potential , adp ) @xcite , @xcite @xmath25 with @xmath26 being by phonon dispersion law , and @xmath27 is a lattice constant .    in order to examine the degree of the vibron dressing , we pass to the small  polaron picture using unitary transformation operator , @xmath28 here @xmath29 are variational parameters , while operators @xmath13 represent ( partially ) dressed vibrons . in the case of the passing to the standard small  polaron picture",
    ", parameter @xmath8 has standard lang ",
    "firsov form : @xmath30 .",
    "operators @xmath13 that appear in the transformed hamiltonian , represent the ( fully ) dressed quasi particle . in all cases the operators",
    "@xmath14 describe the new phonons in the lattice with shifted equilibrium positions of molecular groups .",
    "partially dressed vibron states represent the dynamically stable eigen - states of the system provided that these variational parameters correspond to the minimum energy state .",
    "thus , we search for their optimized values minimizing the system ground  state energy . according to the method described in @xcite",
    ", optimization procedure will be performed in a mean  field manner , which gives better upper bound of the system free energy and consequently the better upper bound of the system ground state energy .",
    "in particular , we define ( in wave number representation ) an effective , mean  field hamiltonian @xmath31 in the following way , @xmath32 where @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "the symbol @xmath36 denotes the average over the new  phonon ensemble , which is considered in the thermal equilibrium state at the temperature @xmath37 .",
    "in such a way we derive , @xmath38 where @xmath39 , and @xmath40 denotes the variational energy of the small  polaron band states , while @xmath41 denotes the vibron  band narrowing factor , which characterizes the degree of the reduction of the corresponding overlap integral or equivalently the enhancement of the polaron effective mass . for obvious reasons ,",
    "they are sometimes called the \" ` dressing fractions `` or the ' ' ` dressing parameters ' \" . at last , the quantity @xmath42 , @xmath43 , denotes the phonon average number .    the polaron ",
    "phonon interaction term may be neglected provided that dressed vibrons represent sufficiently well eigen states of system .",
    "in such a way it can not affect sp equilibrium properties substantially and at @xmath44 k the further procedure simply reduces to minimization of the sp ground state energy .",
    "we note the ground ",
    "state vector of the effective hamiltonian @xmath31 reads , @xmath45 , where @xmath46 is the phonon vacuum vector so that the ground  state energy corresponds to the lowest level of sp energy , i.e.,@xmath47 .",
    "thus , from the requirement , @xmath48 , we get , @xmath49 from the eq.([fq ] ) it follows that for each value of @xmath50 there is the corresponding value of the variational parameter @xmath8 .",
    "for that reason , the optimization procedure for this approach becomes extremely difficult problem , even numerically .",
    "note , however , that only @xmath51 ( when @xmath52 ) , or @xmath53 ( when @xmath54 ) , should be considered since it will correspond to the polaron ground state only .",
    "this case is also the most relevant for the optical spectroscopy since vibron bandwidths in these media are very narrow and its dispersion in all practical examination of optical spectra can be neglected @xcite , @xcite , @xcite @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the expressions for vibron ground state energy ( normalized on the characteristic phonon energy @xmath4 and measured from the energy level @xmath12 ) and vibron dressing factor are obtained by the substitution of the variational parameters into ( [ esp ] ) .",
    "performing the summation over the phonon quasi momenta @xmath50 by virtue of the rule @xmath55 and by introducing two dimensionless parameters ( that determine the system parameter space ) @xmath56 and @xmath57 , we obtain , @xmath58 and @xmath59 in the case when vibron interact with optical phonon mode , and @xmath60 when the vibron interacts with acoustic phonon modes",
    ". the quantities @xmath61 that appear in the above relations have the integral representation , @xmath62    in the case of simple `` @xmath9approach '' we choose @xmath8 in the form : @xmath63 , where @xmath64 is variational parameter . in that case",
    ", we have more simple variational technique in which we should determine only one variational parameter ( @xmath9 ) . on the other hand",
    ", this assumption implies the equal dressing for all phonon modes . at the first sight , it looks like a very strong assumption since the whole set of variational parameters ( one for each mode ) is substituted by a single one .",
    "however , here we showed that predictions obtained by this approach are very close with ones , obtained by more rigorous `` @xmath8 approach '' .",
    "repeating above described procedure we obtained condition which determines parameter @xmath9 , @xmath65 where @xmath66 is small  polaron binding energy , while @xmath67 is sp band narrowing factor calculated in the non ",
    "adiabatic , strong coupling limit ( standard lf approach ) .",
    "then , performing summation over phonon quasimomenta , we derive the relation for the ground state energy ( in @xmath68 parameter space ) in the form , @xmath69 in the case when vibron interact with optical phonon , and @xmath70 when vibron interact with acoustical phonons .",
    "according to the available literature data , the hopping constant in @xmath71helix proteins is typically equal to , @xmath72 ( in the case of the hydrogen bonds between peptide units ) and @xmath73 ( between different spines of hydrogen  bonded peptide units , i.e. in the case of the covalent bonds between peptide unit ) @xcite .",
    "the mass of the peptide unit ranges between @xmath74 kg and @xmath75 kg @xcite .",
    "the above mentioned values of the system parameters in macromolecular chains indicate that adiabatic parameter in these structures ranges between @xmath76 and @xmath77 . in the same time , coupling constant ranges between @xmath78 and @xmath79 .",
    "the last fact indicates that these structures belong to the non - adiabatic coupling limit from weak to intermediate one",
    ".    obtained numerical results are presented on the figs .",
    "the calculations obtained by `` @xmath9approach '' are presented by full lines , the ones obtained by the `` @xmath8approach '' are presented by dashed lines , and the calculations obtained by the standard lf approach are presented by dotted lines .",
    "as one can remark , the results obtained by both variational approaches are strongly different compared with ones obtained by standard lf approach , for small values of coupling constant @xmath80 .",
    "this difference disappears on large values of @xmath80 for all values of @xmath81 . for small and intermediate values of @xmath80 ,",
    "the difference between two variational approaches increases with increasing of @xmath81 .",
    "these results are expectable , since standard lf approach is not applicable in weak coupling limit . on the other side ,",
    "results obtained by both variational approaches are very similar in the whole range of @xmath80 , for small values of @xmath81 ( non - adiabatic limit ) .",
    "there are significant difference only for @xmath82 ( adiabatic limit ) , for small and intermediate values of @xmath80 .",
    "one should be noted in addition , it is evident that both variational approaches predict a multivalued dependence of @xmath83 and @xmath84 on @xmath80 , in certain region of @xmath80 , only in the adiabatic limit . according to the variational principle , the only lowest energy value is physically meaningful .",
    "consequently , only lower values of @xmath83 ( and its corresponding values of @xmath84 ) have physical significance and truly variational energy is presented by one line which is not smooth ( at certain value of @xmath80 it have the point of cusp ) . in the same time",
    ", @xmath84 undergoes an abrupt change .",
    "that means that vibron st state have abrupt transition from weakly dressed to heavy dressed polaron state .",
    "obtained results may look as a consequence of the applied variational approach .",
    "however , it seems that these results are in good agreement with some recent numerical investigations @xcite , where authors interpreted similar results as a coexistence of two types of sp states instead of abrupt transition from one to another quasiparticle type .     the dependence of the @xmath84 on the @xmath80 , for different values of the @xmath81 .",
    "the case of vibron that interaction with optical phonon modes . ]     +     the dependence of the @xmath84 on the @xmath80 , for different values of the @xmath81 .",

    "the case of vibron that interaction with acoustic phonon modes . ]",
    "in accordance to the obtained results , one may note that both variational approaches give very similar qualitative and quantitative predictions , especially in non - adiabatic region . with the rise of the adiabatic parameter , the difference between variational approaches , as well as between variational approaches and standard small  polaron approach vanishes . in the case of the vibron interacting with the optical phonon modes ,",
    "ground state energies predicted by the `` @xmath8approach '' are something lower than ground state energies predicted by the `` @xmath9approach '' .",
    "but , in the non  adiabatic region of the parameter space this difference may be practically neglected , and `` @xmath9approach '' is quite good method for the investigation of the vibron self  trapping states .",
    "similar results are obtained in the case when vibron interacts with acoustic phonon modes . in the adiabatic region of the system parameter space",
    "the difference between two variational approaches is significant .    due to the fact that practically all biological macromolecular structures belongs to the non - adiabatic , weak or intermediate coupling limit",
    ", it seems that simple `` @xmath9approach '' may be by the hopeful method for investigations of the self ",
