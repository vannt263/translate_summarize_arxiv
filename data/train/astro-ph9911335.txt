    "recent observations with _ bepposax _ have detected hard x - ray ( hxr ) tails in the x - ray spectra of the coma cluster ( fusco - femiano et al .",
    "1999 ) and abell  2199 ( kaastra , bleeker , & mewe 1998 ; kaastra et al .",
    "these tails , which have been fit by power - law spectra , are an excess to the thermal x - ray emission from the hot intracluster medium ( icm ) . in coma , which has a diffuse radio halo ( e.g. , deiss et al .",
    "1997 ) , there have been many previous attempts to detect nonthermal hxr emission produced by inverse compton ( ic ) scattering of cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) photons by the radio - emitting relativistic electrons ( e.g. , rephaeli et al .  1994 ) .",
    "comparison of the radio synchrotron and ic hxr emission allow one to determine the magnetic field in the icm ( e.g. , rephaeli 1979 ) ; in coma , fusco - femiano et al .",
    "( 1999 ) find @xmath9 @xmath7 g .",
    "all in all , ic scattering is probably the most attractive model for the hxr emission in clusters , but it is not without problems .",
    "first , the magnetic field in coma is smaller than that determined from faraday rotation toward individual radio galaxies ( @xmath06 @xmath7 g ; feretti et al .",
    "1995 ) or equipartition in the diffuse radio halo ( @xmath00.4 @xmath7 g ; giovannini et al .  1993 ; enlin & biermann 1998 ) .",
    "one way of describing this discrepancy would be to say that the observed hxr emission is stronger than expected for models of the radio source with the larger magnetic fields .",
    "the situation in abell  2199 is more extreme .",
    "this cluster lacks any extended diffuse radio emission ( kempner & sarazin 1999 ) , and thus no ic hxr emission was expected .",
    "the detection of this hxr emission implies a very weak icm magnetic field of @xmath10 @xmath7 g if the hxr emission is ic ( kempner & sarazin 1999 ) .    the weak icm magnetic field in coma and very restrictive limit in abell  2199 could be increased if some other mechanism contributed to the hxr emission in clusters .",
    "one suggestion is that all or part of this emission might be nonthermal bremsstrahlung ( ntb ) from suprathermal electrons with energies of @xmath0 10  200 kev ( kaastra et al .",
    "1998 ; enlin et al .  1999 ) .",
    "these nonthermal electrons would form a population in excess of the normal thermal gas which is the bulk of the icm .",
    "perhaps the most natural explanation of this suprathermal population would be that they are particles which are currently being accelerating to higher energies , either by shocks or turbulence in the icm .",
    "nonthermal bremsstrahlung has also been invoked as a possible explanation for hard x - ray tails in the spectra of supernova remnants ( skibo , ramaty , & purcell 1996 ; baring et al .",

    "first , we assume that the electrons result from ongoing first - order fermi shock acceleration .",
    "if the accelerating particles are treated as test particles , kinetic theory indicates that the particle spectrum is a power - law in the momentum ( axford , leer , & skadron 1977 ; bell 1978a , b ; blandford & ostriker 1978 ) : @xmath50 we will refer to these models as `` power - law '' ( pl ) models . in this and the other models below , the parameter @xmath26 gives the population at @xmath51 . for shock acceleration , the exponent @xmath52 , where @xmath53 is the shock compression . in supernova remnants in our galaxy ,",
    "the radio spectra suggest that the acceleration produces electrons with @xmath542.6 .",
    "thus , we will consider models with values of @xmath54 , 2.3 , and 2.6 ( table  [ tab : models ] ) .",
    "more complicated shock geometries ( non - plane parallel shocks or non - normal magnetic field orientations ) can result in more complicated particle spectra ( e.g. , jokipii 1987 ) .",
    "there are a number of arguments that suggest that steeper power - law spectra might occur in cluster of galaxies .",
    "first , if the acceleration occurs in intracluster shocks due to cluster mergers , the compression can be lower than in supernova remnants .",
    "the gas in the merging subclusters is already quite hot , and the typical mach numbers of the shocks are only several , rather than being very large . for example , markevitch , sarazin , & vikhlinin ( 1999 ) recently analyzed the temperature structure in three clusters which are currently undergoing fairly major mergers . in the cygnus a cluster , which had the simplest geometry and analysis , the compression associated with the shock was @xmath55 . in abell 3667 ,",
    "the compression was @xmath56 .",
    "these shock compressions would imply @xmath573.5 .",
    "second , it is also possible that turbulent acceleration plays a significant role in clusters of galaxies ( e.g. , eilek & weatherall 1999 ) .",
    "for example , the centrally located , diffuse `` radio halos '' in clusters might be due to synchrotron emission from electrons produced by turbulent acceleration , while the more localized `` radio relics '' were associated with shock acceleration .",
    "turbulent acceleration , which is generally a second - order fermi process , might produce a steeper particle acceleration than shock acceleration .",
    "thus , we have also calculated models with power - law electron momentum distributions and with steeper spectra ( @xmath58 , 3.5 and 4 in table  [ tab : models ] ) .",
    "the energy associated with the acceleration of relativistic particles in shocks can have significant effects on the shock structure ( e.g. , ellison , jones , & reynolds 1990 ) .",
    "the pressure of the accelerating particles affects the upstream plasma , and a precursor shock may form . at same time , energy losses to escaping accelerating particles increase the overall shock compression ( eichler 1984 ) . although most of the energy may be associated with accelerating ions , the changes to the shock structure can affect the acceleration of electrons as well .",
    "the result is to steepen the electron spectrum at low momenta ( baring et al .",
    "for typical nonlinear shock structure , the electron spectrum steepens from being proportional to @xmath59 at high energies to being proportional to @xmath60 at low energies . as our second model",
    ", we adopt a simple parameterized electron spectrum based on these nonlinear shock models , with @xmath61 } { \\left ( 1 +   p_c^2 \\right ) } \\ , \\qquad p \\ge p_l \\ , .\\ ] ] the value of @xmath62 should depend on the diffusion of electrons in the shocks and on the details of the shock structure",
    ". the appropriate averages of these properties are unknown in clusters .",
    "instead , we will adopt values of @xmath63 , 0.5 , and 1 , which imply that the electron spectrum steepens at the low energy end of the range of interest in clusters .",
    "for much lower values of @xmath62 , equation  ( [ eq : nonlinear ] ) reduces to equation  ( [ eq : powerlaw ] ) for electron momenta of interest for nonthermal bremsstrahlung",
    ". we will refer to these models as `` nonlinear '' ( nl ) models .      as an alternative to models in which the nonthermal particles are currently being accelerated",
    ", we will also consider a model in which these particles arise from an older population of relativistic electrons ( e.g. , kardashev 1962 ) .",
    "recently , euv / soft x - ray emission has been detected from clusters which might be due to inverse compton ( ic ) emission from a populations of relativistic electrons with energies of @xmath0150 mev ( sarazin & lieu 1998 ) .",
    "these particles have lifetimes in clusters which are @xmath39@xmath64 yr , and should persist long after the process which accelerated the relativistic particles has ceased",
    ". the lower energy nonthermal particles will lose energy more rapidly due mainly to coulomb losses to the thermal plasma .",
    "these energy losses could provide a supply of low energy nonthermal particles for nonthermal bremsstrahlung .",
    "we will refer to these models as `` cooling electron '' models .",
    "the timescales for coulomb losses are short for the low energy nonthermal particles we consider here . as a result",
    ", the cooling electrons are expected to be in steady - state ( sarazin 1999 , ",
    "the rate of energy loss due to coulomb interactions is given by ( e.g. , rephaeli 1979 ) @xmath65 \\ , , \\ ] ] where @xmath66 and @xmath67 are the velocity and lorentz factor of the nonthermal electron , @xmath68 is the thermal electron number density , and @xmath69 is the plasma frequency in the thermal gas .",
    "the coulomb logarithm term used here is approximate ; it applies in either the subrelativistic quantum limit ( @xmath70 ) or in the ultrarelativistic limit .",
    "however , the argument of the logarithm is generally very large , and the variations due to @xmath66 and @xmath67 are quite slow .",
    "the only major variation of the loss rate with energy in momentum comes from the factor @xmath71 outside of the logarithm . for the purpose of constructing this simple model",
    ", we will ignore the variation in the coulomb logarithm , which only affects the solution at the level of a few percent .",
    "then , if one follows the same steady - state argument for the low energy population given in sarazin ( 1999 ,   3.1.6 ) , the momentum distribution of the cooling electrons is found to be @xmath72 the maximum in the loss time of electrons in a cluster occurs for @xmath73 mev or @xmath74 . at energies which are higher than this , electrons lose energy rapidly due to ic and synchrotron radiation .",
    "thus , we will assume an upper limit of @xmath75 for this cooling electron distribution .",

    "the dashed curve is for a purely thermal distribution .",
    "as discussed above , the nonthermal electron population was normalized by comparing the number of electrons to the corresponding number in the thermal population .",
    "the flux of electrons through the subrelativistic , nonthermal population is also of interest .",
    "let @xmath27 be the number of electrons passing through this population per unit time , with a positive sign implying the electrons are moving to higher energies .",
    "for the cooling electron population , this number flux is a constant and is determined by the rate of coulomb energy losses ( eq .  [ [ eq : coulomb ] ] ) . for accelerating electrons , the flux depends on the time scale for electron acceleration , which is uncertain in clusters .",
    "however , efficient acceleration probably requires that the rate of acceleration exceed the rate of energy losses . based on this argument , the lower limit to the number flux of accelerating particles",

    "<S> the ntb models require a nonthermal electron population which contains about 3% of the number of electrons in the thermal icm . </S>",
    "<S> if the suprathermal electron population is cut - off at some energy above 100 kev , then the models can easily fit the observed hxr fluxes and spectral indices in both clusters . for accelerating electron models without a cutoff </S>",
    "<S> , the electron spectrum must be rather steep @xmath8 to avoid producing too much ic hxr emission . </S>",
    "<S> the model hxr spectra are then rather steep , but marginally consistent with observations of the hxr spectrum in abell  2199 and coma or the radio spectrum in coma . </S>",
    "<S> these models can account for the hxr and radio properties of these two clusters , but do not produce enough euv emission . </S>"
