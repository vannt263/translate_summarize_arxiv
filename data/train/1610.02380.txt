    "this is essentially a counting function of where the particles are present .",
    "the bbgky hierarchy for this arbitrary distribution function @xmath33 in phase space is defined through the following set of equations : @xmath34 the reduced distribution function , @xmath35 taken up to the @xmath36-particle interactions hence it takes into account only the distribution functions of the @xmath36-particle and the @xmath37-particle.the first term , @xmath38 corresponds to the free part of the hamiltonian , the second term , @xmath39 describes the external field for eample , noise .",
    "the final two terms associated with @xmath40 correspond to the perturbation contribution of the hamiltonian as result of interactions @xcite .",

    "starting from @xmath52 we obtain that @xmath53 the associated chain is :    @xmath54    in the same manner , the chain has been explicitly built up for @xmath55 with @xmath56 for @xmath55 we obtain :    @xmath57    the above construction clearly demonstrates the relationship between the associated distribution functions of the @xmath36-particles to @xmath37 interacting particles .",
    "these equations extend the bbgky hierarchy to non - equilibrium adiabatically evolving systems , using the pechukas model .",
    "the coupled differential equations determine the kinetics of the distribution functions associated to the level dynamics of the pechukas gas .",
    "we go further to make the approximation that the distribution functions of the system can be expressed as a product of @xmath58 distributions .    taking into account the chain for @xmath52",
    "we introduce a factorisation approximation based on the independence of the the set of coordinates @xmath59 and the set of relative angular momenta terms @xmath60 such that we can construct probability distribution functions of @xmath11 and @xmath12 that are independent of the probability distribution functions of @xmath13 . as a consequence",

    "in this section , we estimate the accuracy of the factorisation approximation as this is important to know the validity of the effective mean field approximation .    taking the definition for @xmath69 as in appendix a and evaluating the integral in ( 9 ) we obtain the distribution for @xmath62 expressed as the product of @xmath70 functions .",
    "similarly the product of the distributions @xmath71 and @xmath64 obtained from evaluating ( 9 ) specifically with these distribution functions takes the same form with the only difference being the normalisation constants .",
    "whether the factorisation approximation holds , it depends solely on the normalisation constants used in the averaging procedure as defined in eq .",
    "( 9 ) such that ( 12 ) holds .",
    "the normalisation constant relating to @xmath13 is the same in both equations .",
    "this is a consequence of the fact that the @xmath13 term from @xmath72 comes from a system associated to the @xmath62 distribution function .",
    "we determine the @xmath5 from the difference of these normalisations given by the following expression :    @xmath73    using this expression , we obtain the following : @xmath74    taking a large limit of the number @xmath22 of particles , it is possible to determine exactly the ground state and to encode solutions into through brute force . for the limit that @xmath75 we find that @xmath5 decays asymptotically .    we extend this further to consider the factorisation approximation for a general @xmath36-particle distribution function @xmath45 such that it can be factorised as @xmath36 one particle distributions and @xmath76 number of @xmath77 distributions . using the same idea as the case for @xmath78 we consider the way the normalisations constants will differ and the @xmath5 between them . taking the same approach , for the generalised factorisation for an @xmath22-particle distribution function composed as the product of @xmath22 one - particle distributions functions .",
    "then @xmath5 reads :    @xmath79    from these results it can be inferred that to solve the bbgky chain for the pechukas equations at the first link , only distributions functions for @xmath80 and @xmath64 are required . the same rationale can be extended for higher order interactions in writing these distribution functions as products of one - particle distribution functions .",
    "we further illustrate this model on a two - qubit system .",
    "we consider a two qubit system described by the ising model , in order to test the bbgky hierarchy for the pechukas equations .",
    "we take the tfih as the hamiltonian that governs the two qubit system : @xmath81    for the case that @xmath82 the interaction favors antiferromagnetism whereas for @xmath83 it favors ferromagnetism , we take random values for j , gaussian distributied with mean 0 and standard deviation 1 , reflecting the different initial conditions . when @xmath84 the system is in the ground state .",

    "we bound @xmath5 from above and below to examine the applicability of the factorisation approximation .",
    "the bounds have been calculated in appendix b.we obtain :    @xmath112    using these bounds , we find that the factorisation approximation does not hold , this is expected because to approximate well a probability distribution function as a product of one - particle distribution functions , the system must be essentially uncorrelated . in the specific case of the two qubit system the qubits are not independent as they strongly interact through the term proportional to @xmath101 . in order to explore this error",
    "further we test the system numerically using cloud dynamics and determine the distribution functions associated to the interactions .",
    "we draw 100 trial of @xmath113 terms , diagonalising the system to determine its eigenvalues , as demonstrated in fig .",
    "1 . choosing a large bias such that @xmath114 , we take @xmath115 as 0.01 and @xmath116 as 0.02 , keeping these values small so as to reduce their impact on @xmath5 . however , to explore the dynamics of these values we diagonalise the hamiltonian for @xmath115 as 0.1 and @xmath116 as 0.2 such that the perturbation is of the same order of the values of @xmath101 associated to the unperturbed hamiltonian as in eq .",
    "the results are shown in fig . 1 .",

    "the outcome is that the factorisation approximation does not hold for a two qubit system due to the interaction term .",

    "<S> equilibrium statistical mechanics of this pechukas gas allows to reproduce the random matrix theory of energy levels . </S>",
    "<S> here we develop nonequilibrium statistical mechanics of the pechukas gas , starting with the derivation of the bogoliubov - born - green - kirkwood - yvon ( bbgky ) chain of equations for the appropriate generalized distribution functions . </S>",
    "<S> sets of approximate kinetic equations can be consistently obtained by breaking this chain at a particular point ( i.e. approximating all higher - order distribution functions by the products of the lower - order ones ) . </S>",
    "<S> when complemented by the equations for the level occupation numbers and interlevel transition amplitudes , they allow to describe the nonequilibrium evolution of the quantum state of the system , which may be better fit for the case of a large quantum coherent system than the currently used approaches . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we find that corrections to the factorized approximation of the distribution function scale as 1/n , where n is the number of the `` pechukas gas particles '' ( i.e. , energy levels in the system ) . </S>"
