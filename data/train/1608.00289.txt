    "[ sec : intro ] particle acceleration in the relativistic shock is contributed to the first order fermi acceleration ( fermi - i ) at a shock front and the second order fermi acceleration ( fermi - ii ) in a downstream region of the shock(fermi 1949 ; 1954 ) .",
    "fermi - type acceleration should occur when particles are reflected many times from a distribution of moving magnetic inhomogeneities . in the fermi - i process",
    ", the charged particles crossing the shock front gain the energy . due to the magnetic inhomogeneities , the particles may be subsequently scattering many times on different sides of the shock front and each time gain the energy . the fermi - ii process in",
    "now is identified as an arche - typical form of stochastic acceleration , and the fermi acceleration term is used in a generic sense to describe stochastic acceleration . during this process , assumes agent of this acceleration is plasma wave turbulence which is expected to be present in non - equilibrium conditions of highly magnetized plasmas .",
    "charged particles , spiraling along magnetic field lines , are then accelerated through resonant interactions with plasma waves .",
    "the particles gain or lose energy attributing to the target particles is approaching or receding(blandford @xmath0 eichler 1987 ; gaisser 1990).this problem is often treated in the quasi - linear approximation and leads to fokker - planck equation with a diffusion coefficient that magnitude and form depends on the power spectrum and other characteristics of the plasma turbulence(schlickeiser 1989 ) . *",
    "either fermi - i mechanism or stochastic acceleration mechanism in a steady state is well known to induce a power law particle energy spectrum with @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the spectral index .",
    "a different spectral index with @xmath3 can only be achieved if the acceleration process competes with an escape process of particles . *",
    "mostly because second order fermi acceleration process makes the particles gain or lose energy much longer timescales than the instantaneous first order mechanism(campeanu @xmath0 schlickeiser 1992 ; vainio @xmath0 schlickeiser 1998 ) , it has been neglected for most of the cases .",
    "however , in the high velocity turbulent modes , such as @xmath4 , the efficiency of the second order fermi acceleration comparable to the first order fermi acceleration ( virtanen @xmath0 vaino 2005 ) .",
    "furthermore , for the extragalactic jet non - thermal radiation , in which the bulk of radiation is emitted by the particles that have already left the shock discontinuity towards the downstream , we can not neglect its effect on the particle spectrum evolution .",
    "following above issues , stawarz & petrosian ( 2008 ) investigate stochastic acceleration of ultrarelativistic electrons by magnetic turbulence .",
    "they suggest that the curvature of the high energy segments of the energy spectra , even though they are produced by the same population of electrons , may be substantially different between the synchrotron and inverse compton components .",
    "blazars are a special class of active galactic nuclei ( agns ) characterized by a highly variable nonthermal continuum emission extending from radio to @xmath5-ray bands .",
    "the variability on timescales ranging from hours to minutes has been commonly observed at various wavelengths of the electromagnetic spectrum ( e.g. b@xmath6ttcher 2007 ) . in the most extreme cases",
    ", the timescales of @xmath5-rays variability can be as short as a few minutes at very high energy .",
    "such variability has now been observed from several blazars , including mrk 421 ( gaidos et al .",
    "1996 ) , mrk 501 ( albert et al . 2007 ) , pks 2155 - 304 ( aharonian et al .",
    "2007),1es 1218 - 304 ( acciari et al 2009a ) , 3c 66a ( acciari et al 2009b ) , 3c 273 ( abdo et al . 2010 ) , pks 1222 + 21 ( alsksic et al . 2011 ) , and the prototype object of the class bl lac ( arlen et al .",
    "the fast flaring pose several challenges to the theoretical model for the @xmath5-rays emission in blazars .",
    "on the one hand , the observed minutes timescale @xmath7-rays variability implies that the flares are more likely to originate from compact emitting regions that can be most naturally associated with the immediate vicinity of the central engine ( begelman et al .",
    "2008 ; giannios et al . 2009 ; narayan & piran 2012 ) .",
    "on the other hand , the @xmath7-rays emission regions must located at scales @xmath80.5 pc that @xmath7-rays can escape attenuation due to external radiation fields ( tavecchio et al .",
    "2011 , nalewajko et al .",
    "furthermore , for the tev photons to escape the source , the emitting blob with a doppler boosting of @xmath950 towards the observer must be expected .",
    "this is much larger that the lorentz factor @xmath1010 - 20 that is typically inferred for blazar jet from superluminal motions ( e.g. savolainen et al .",
    "2010 ) .    as an open issue",
    ", a large number of emission mechanisms responsible for these tev flares have been put forward to explain the fast flares in individual source , such as , * the relativistic pick - up model ( e.g. gerbig & schlickeiser 2007 ) * , a coherent instability in a compact emission region ( e.g. begelman et al .",
    "2008 ) , reconnection - driven minijets ( e.g. giannios et al . 2009 ; giannios 2013 ) , jet deceleration ( e.g. georganoupolos & kazanas 2003 ; levinson 2007 ) to wiggles in an anisotropic electron beam directed along the jet ( ghisellini et al .",
    "2009 ) , a magnetized cloud induced stochastic acceleration ( zheng & zhang 2011a ; zheng et al .",
    "2011 , zheng et al .",
    "2013 ) , rarefaction waves in magnetized shells ( e.g. lyutikov & lister 2010 ) , relativistic turbulence in the jet ( e.g. narayan & piran 2012 ) , the interaction of the jet with a red giant star ( e.g. barkov et al .",
    "2012 ) , the firehose instability ( e.g. subramanian et al . 2012 ) .    in general , both plasma mechanisms ( e.g. krishan & wiita 1994 ) and beamed radiation ( e.g. crusius - w@xmath11tzel & lesch 1998 )",
    "are proposed responsible for variability in jets .",
    "steady - state tev emissions , especially , tev variability originate from the blazar jet , pose significant challenge . in the lepton model frame , where the electron radiate photons via the synchrotron self - compton process or the external inverse compton process , both these mechanisms expect high energy electrons with lorentz factor @xmath12 .",
    "this induced electron acceleration and radiation problems .",
    "motivated by the above issue , in this paper , base on our previous work , we considered an ordinary case in the momentum diffusion equation for the electron spectrum evolution .",
    "our goal is to determin whether an ordinary case in the momentum diffusion equation for the electron spectrum evolution can reproduce the energy spectra and time dependent properties of flare . in ",
    "2 , various physical processes involved in the time dependent particle energy distribution and the nonthermal photon emission are briefly given , including kinetic equations , particle acceleration in turbulent magnetic fields and photon production mechanisms involved in this paper . in  3 , we apply this model to the variability and the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of bl lacertae object mrk 421 , and conclusions and discussion are given in  4 . throughout the paper ,",
    "we assume the hubble constant @xmath13 , the matter energy density @xmath14 , the radiation energy density @xmath15 and the dimensionless cosmological constant @xmath16 .",
    "we introduce and solve the kinetic equation describing the pile - up mechanism for relativistic electron spectra in a zone within the jet . in the model , as two possible particle acceleration mechanisms are able to produce high energy electrons , fermi - i and fermi - ii are self - consistent treated in the radiation processes .",
    "the description of fermi type acceleration is in term of isotropic diffusion in momentum space .",
    "schlickeiser ( 2002 ) showed that the evolution of the energetic particle distribution can be described by the one dimensional diffusion approximation of the relativistic vlasov equation : @xmath17+s(p , t),\\ ] ] where @xmath18 is the isotropic , homogeneous phase space density with the dimensionless particle momentum @xmath19 , the function @xmath20 describes the acceleration processes , and @xmath21 describes the catastrophic particle gains and losses .",

    "the particles are still accelerated by turbulent plasma waves .",

    "these indicate that the emission processes in the all of observation bands are dominated by particles acceleration in the emission region . in order to explore the time lag intensively",
    ", we interesting to consider a simple scenario in which the rise time of burst is primarily controlled by the acceleration time of the electrons corresponding to observed photon energies ( e.g. sato et al .",
    "2008 ) . in this scenario ,",

    "we compare expected time lag with the observed time lag .",
    "it can be seen from figure 6 , a hard lag would be reproduced while the variability origin of the particles acceleration , through there is large error with the results .    as is easily seen by our results , in the case of bohm diffusion",
    ", we adopt a very low magnetic field , so the ic peak become too high . in this artificial parameter set ,",
    "the model spectra seem to deviate from the data points apparently , only x - ray spectra seem consistent with the observations .",
    "the light curves for various energy bands also seem deviate from the data points especially for 15 - 50 kev and gamma - ray bands ( see fig.1 , fig.2 ) .",
    "because that the cooling timescale becomes longer in this parameter set , only the acceleration timescale can be seen by observers .",
    "the acceleration timescale causes the specious lag of the hard x - ray . in the case of hard sphere approximation ,",
    "the model results are better than the bohm case ( see fig.3 , fig.4 ) . due to the acceleration timescale",

    "however , we can clue on the time lag through the model peak time , @xmath184 , that is listed in table 2 . as can be seen that hard lag was shown even in this special case .",
    "we argue that the fresh particles with lower energy ( @xmath185 ) are injected into the acceleration region and then are accelerated gradually to the radiation windows by stochastic acceleration .",

    "in this paper , we try to reproduce the energy spectra and time dependent properties of flare in blazars , in the context of the time - dependent one - zone ssc model which includes stochastic acceleration of ultra - relativistic particles by strong magnetic turbulence . in this model , particles with low energy",
    "are assumed to be injected and then are accelerated to higher energies by stochastic particle - wave interaction , the most important photon targets for ic scattering by relativistic electrons are the synchrotron photons .",
    "we study time - dependent properties of flares by reproducing the pre - burst spectrum of the source and varying the injection rate in the bohm diffusion ( q=1 ) and the hard sphere approximation ( q=2 ) case , respectively .",
    "our results show that bohm diffusion case leads to hard photon spectra , and hard sphere case approximation seems to reproduce the energy spectra and the time dependent properties of flare still better .",
    "the calculations assumed a constant escape timescale , @xmath187 , to substitute for the energy dependent escape timescale .",
    "it can be seen that , in the range of whole lorentz factor , the energy dependent escape timescale is more than the constant escape timescale .",
    "that is , the constant escape timescale leads to higher escape efficiency and softer spectra .",
    "now that we account for the stochastic acceleration , the spectra became too hard ( e.g. see lefa , aharonian & rieger 2011 ; asano et al .",
    "2014 ) , especially , we obtain stronger ic scatter in the bohm case . even though , adopting same weak magnetic field , abdo et al . ( 2011 ) deduced a lower ic peak with the steady spectrum . it is considered that higher acceleration efficiency in the bohm case make the more low energy particles to pile - up near the radiation windows , the stronger ic scattering can be expected . with the acceleration efficiency decreasing ( hard sphere case ) , the observed spectra can be fitted by the soften model spectrum .",
    "there are two scenarios for explaining the intrinsic variability .",
    "one assumes that the observed variations originate from the geometry of emitting sources ( e.g. , camenzind & krockenberger 1992 ; gopal - krishna & wiita 1992 ) .",
    "the other assumes that the variability is generated by the change of the emission condition .",
    "a typical example is that fresh particles are injected into the acceleration region and then are accelerated ( e.g. , blandford & konigl 1979 ; marscher & gear 1985 ; celotti et al . 1991 ; kirk et al .",
    "chen et al . ( 2011 ) investigate a set of simple scenarios where the variability is produced by injection of relativistic electrons as a shock front crosses the emission region , and suggest that different phases of activity may occur in the same region . in order to reproduce",
    "the multi - wavelength spectra and variability , the model changed only the injection rate for outburst state .",
    "this implies that the outbursts are triggered by a magnetized cloud in same region , in which there is a magnetic field and bulk factor in consonance with the pre - burst state .",
    "it should be noted that when the magnetized cloud comes into being in the jet in which the local plasma density is enhanced , the number of particles increase as an avalanche occurs in the jet , and the injection rate can be expected to change . in this scenario ,",
    "abundance of energy particles are accelerated to higher energy , the hard photon spectra should be expected .    as can be seen that the radio and optical portion of the sed is not well fit by this single zone model . although the multi - wavelength observed results indicate that the radio and optical variability of mrk 421 are accompanied by strong x - rays and @xmath5-rays variability ( shukla et al . 2012 ) .",
    "it is likely that a different population of particles is responsible for the synchrotron emission at these energies ( e.g. blazejowski et al .",
    "2005 ; horan et al .",
    "since the observed energy bands by fermi - lat and hagar far from the equilibrium energy @xmath158 , the high acceleration efficiency makes the electron energy reach to the radiation window rapidly .",
    "so , in the bohm diffusion case , we can expect a quasi - monochromatic light curves in the fermi - lat and hagar band , respectively .",
    "it should be noted that if the variability timescale is faster than the cooling timescale , the radiation from accelerated particles would show a hard lag ( albert et al .",
    "in this view , mastichiadis & moraitis ( 2008 ) argue that the observed hard lag features can be explained with a physically modification , that is , allowing the particles to accelerate gradually . in the bohm diffusion scenario , assuming low energy electron injection and stochastic acceleration by the turbulent magnetic field , our calculations predicted a energy dependent hard lag flaring activity .",
    "actually , the hard lag was seen even in the hard sphere approximation case ( zheng & zhang 2011a ) .",
    "similar result was also predicted by simulations of stochastic acceleration in relativistic shocks ( e.g. virtanen & vainio 2005 ) . as a result",
    ", hard lag would be more expected in lower energy band , now that the photons energy is less than the equilibrium energy .",
    "however , the observational results show an opposite sense .",
    "it has been suggested that a hard lag is observed at energies closer to the equilibrium energy ( kirk et al .",
    "the fact that a hard lag is actually observed in some blazars , such as mrk 421 ( e.g. zhang 2002 ; ravasio et al .",
    "2004 ) , mrk 501 ( albert et al . 2007 ) and 1es 1218 + 304 ( sato et al . 2008 ) .",
    "we argue that the observational time bins are longer than the acceleration time - scales probably means that , in practice , there is a loss of radiative lifetime .",
    "it is clear that the power spectrum index @xmath188 plays an important part in determining a electron spectra shape and evolution ( e.g. zheng & zhang 2011b ) . in our results ,",
    "the behaviours of the multi - wavelength spectra between in the bohm diffusion and in the hard sphere approximation case are a little different .",
    "the energy spectra shows steeper shape and stronger ic scattering in the bohm diffusion case and the opposite behaviours in the hard sphere approximation case .",
    "it is considered that the higher particles acceleration efficiency leads to steeper photon spectra and stronger ic scattering in the bohm diffusion case than in the hard sphere approximation case . as an open issue",
    ", other power spectra case , such as the kreichnan turbulence ( @xmath189 ) and kolmogorov turbulence ( @xmath190 ) should be investigated .    in the model",
    ", we must note that as the acceleration particles need electromagnetic turbulence for scattering and energy gain ( e.g. see , tammi & duffy 2009 ) .",
    "it is obvious that suitable turbulence either has to exist in the pre - shock plasma or be generated at the shock by the particles themselves ( bell 2004 ) .",
    "the numerical results show that sufficient turbulence for fast acceleration could be provided by nonlinear turbulence ( reville et al .",
    "generally , stochastic acceleration occurs wherever there are turbulent magnetic fields and can spread to an extended region ; the size is determined by the turbulence generation and decay rates ( campeanu & schlickeiser 1992 ) .",
    "some recent observations suggests that the stochastic acceleration is seen in the observations ( katarzynski et al .",
    "2006 ; tramacere et al . 2007 ;",
    "b@xmath191ttcher et al . 2008 ; tramacere et al .",
    "the model presented here contains the stochastic acceleration process . in order to reproduce the multi - wavelength energy spectra and variability , we assume shorter acceleration and escape timescales in the hard sphere approximation case than that are adopted by other investigators ( see , e.g. , kirk et al . 1998 ; mastichiadis & moraitis 2008 ) . above assumptions",
    "can lead to stronger turbulence with alfven velocity @xmath192 , and longer waves with @xmath193 .",
    "these imply that there is a higher acceleration rate and a lower escape rate , and make more particles accelerate to high energy rapidly . assuming suitable parameters",
    ", we obtain excellent fits to the observed spectra , variability and energy dependent time lag of bl lac object mrk 421 .",
    "this indicates that the variable characteristic can be explained by stochastic acceleration energy particles .",
    "given the complexity of the flaring activity in blazars , this requires more detailed observations and that the issue remains open .",
