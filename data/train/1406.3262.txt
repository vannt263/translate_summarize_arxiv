    "the charge asymmetry in @xmath5 production at @xmath6 colliders is defined by the quantity : @xmath7 where @xmath8 . quantum chromodynamics ( qcd )",
    "predicts that radiative corrections to the leading - order ( lo ) @xmath9 production process induce a non - vanishing @xmath10 , implying that top quarks are produced with a rapidity distribution wider than anti - top quarks . at next - to - leading order ( nlo ) , this effect was first calculated in refs .",
    "the interest in this asymmetry stems from measurements of the corresponding forward - backward asymmetry ( @xmath11 ) performed in @xmath12 collisions at the tevatron by the cdf and d@xmath13 collaborations  @xcite .",
    "these measurements point to a departure from the sm predictions  @xcite , giving rise to a large literature of possible interpretations based on physics beyond the standard model ( bsm ) ( for a recent review , see  @xcite ) .",
    "unfortunately , the charge asymmetry predicted by the standard model ( sm ) at the lhc is much smaller than @xmath11 at the tevatron .",
    "the main reason is that both @xmath11 and @xmath14 are induced only by the fraction of @xmath15 final states generated by @xmath16 collisions , which at the lhc represent only @xmath17 of the total rate , compared to @xmath18 at the tevatron .",
    "the smallness of the effect makes it difficult at the lhc to reach the sensitivity required to measure @xmath10 , and to probe the possible existence of bsm contributions , unless the bsm departures from the sm prediction were rather large .",
    "the measurements of top charge asymmetry performed so far by the atlas and cms collaborations  @xcite , have reached uncertainties at the level of @xmath19 , which is of the order of the sm value of @xmath10 .",
    "for example , in their latest publications relative to data taken at @xmath20  tev , atlas  @xcite and cms  @xcite report the following results  , and we shall refer to these asymmetries as @xmath21 .",
    "charge asymmetries based on rapidity differ by about 10 - 20% from those based on pseudorapidity , but have otherwise the same features . here the leptonic asymmetries @xmath22 are defined by replacing in eq .",
    "( [ eq : a_c ] ) @xmath23 with @xmath24 . in the following",
    "we shall also consider @xmath25 , defined by @xmath26 . ] : @xmath27 a combination of the atlas and cms results has also been performed by the top lhc working group  @xcite @xmath28 the sm result used as a comparison in the experimental papers , including both qcd and electroweak ( ew ) radiative corrections at the one - loop level , is obtained from ref .",
    "@xcite : @xmath29 these values and @xmath30 . ]",
    "result from using the lo total cross sections in the denominator of eq .",
    "( [ eq : a_c ] ) .",
    "this is justified by the fact that , at the one - loop level , the asymmetry is a lo effect . using the nlo total cross section , which is @xmath31 larger than the lo one , the calculated asymmetries would be reduced to @xmath32 of the above values .",
    "we believe that , in absence of a complete nlo calculation of @xmath10 , the difference between the use of lo and nlo cross sections in the denominator of eq .",
    "( [ eq : a_c ] ) should be included in the estimate of the overall theoretical uncertainty .",
    "should the true sm value of @xmath10 end up being closer to the smaller values obtained using the nlo cross sections ( e.g. @xmath33 at @xmath34  tev ) , a robust and accurate measurement will be a hard experimental challenge .",
    "alternative observables are known to enhance the size of the asymmetry .",
    "for example , ref .",
    "@xcite estimates that the asymmetry can increase by a factor of 2 - 3 placing proper cuts on the invariant mass of the @xmath9 system .",
    "the smaller rates due to the extra cuts will be compensated by the much larger statistics to become avilable at 13 - 14  tev .",
    "but the theoretical systematics will , by and large , remain correlated with those of the predictions for the underlying fully inclusive @xmath10 .    in this work ,",
    "we therefore consider an alternative production mechanism for top quark pairs , which can provide a complementary handle for the determination of the sm charge asymmetry , as well as an independent probe of possible bsm sources of a deviation from the sm result .",
    "the mechanism we propose is the production of a @xmath5 pair in association with a @xmath2 boson ( fig .",
    "[ fig : ttxw ] ) .",
    "this production process is indeed quite peculiar . at the lo in qcd",
    "it can only occur via a @xmath4 annihilation , and no contribution from gluons in the initial states is possible .",
    "this is at variance with respect to @xmath35 or @xmath36 , where the vector boson can also couple to the top quark in the subprocess @xmath37 . as it can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig : ttxw ] , @xmath38 can be simply thought of as the standard @xmath39 lo diagram , with the @xmath40 emitted from the initial state . at the nlo",
    ", the @xmath41 channels can open up , yet the gluon - gluon fusion production is not accessible until nnlo . as in @xmath42 the top and the anti - top",
    "are produced symmetrically at lo and an asymmetry arises only starting at nlo due to interference effects . as we will show in the following , the absence of the symmetric gluon - gluon channel makes the resulting asymmetry significantly larger than in @xmath9 production .",
    "the second key feature of @xmath38 is that the emission of the @xmath2 boson from the initial state acts as a polarizer for quark and anti - quarks , effectively leading to the production of polarized top and anti - top quarks .",
    "in other words , the @xmath2-boson emission makes the production of a @xmath5 pair similar to that in polarized @xmath43 collisions @xcite . as a result , the decay products of the top and anti - top display very asymmetrical distributions in rapidity already at the leading order .",
    "we shall call this the ew component of the asymmetry . in new physics scenarios ,",
    "the emission of a @xmath2 boson might also act as a discriminator of the chirality structure of new interactions , such as that of an axigluon with light quarks , as already advocated in different studies  @xcite .",
    "results at the nlo and nlo+ps for the processes @xmath44 have appeared in the literature  @xcite yet no special attention has been given to asymmetries , whether ew or qcd .",
    "the effect on the asymmetry due to the emission of a photon has been recently studied in ref .",
    "measurements of total rates are also becoming available from the lhc experiments  @xcite .",
    "the plan of this article is as follows . in section  [ sec : nlo ]",
    "we present the predictions , at nlo in qcd , ( with and without including parton shower and hadronization effects ) for @xmath10 in both @xmath5 and @xmath45 production , and , in the latter case , for the asymmetries of the decay products @xmath46 and @xmath47 . in section  [ sec : bsm ] , we compare the sm predictions to a simple benchmark model featuring an axigluon compatible with the tevatron @xmath11 measurements , along the lines of what done in ref .",
    "@xcite , to illustrate the peculiar discriminating power of @xmath38 . in the final section",
    "we discuss the prospects at present and future colliders and present our conclusions . in [ sec : basics ] , we review the main features of the polarized @xmath4 annihilation into @xmath5 , highlighting the close similarity of angular distributions with those predicted in @xmath48 .",
    ".total cross sections and the asymmetry @xmath49 for @xmath50 , calculated at nlo fixed order , lo+ps , and nlo+ps at @xmath51 .",
    "the quoted uncertainties are estimated with scale variations , except for lo+ps @xmath49 where they are from mc statistics . for the nlo ( + ps ) @xmath49 mc uncertainties are less than 0.1 ( absolute value in % ) . [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^ \" , ]     to derive a quantitative estimate of the statistical precision that could be optimistically reached under various energies and luminosity scenarios , we assume leptonic ( @xmath52 ) decays for the top quarks @xmath53 and neglect acceptance and reconstruction efficiencies . using the results collected in tab .  [",
    "table : xsec ] we find :    * 8 tev ( @xmath54 ) : + @xmath55 * 14 tev ( @xmath56 ) : + @xmath57 * 14 tev ( @xmath58 ) : + @xmath59 * 100 tev ( @xmath58 ) : + @xmath60    where @xmath61 is the relative precision on the asymmetries .",
    "while a realistic experimental analysis will certainly degrade this optimal precision , these numbers show the great potential of this observable .",
    "we remark that the larger sensitivity of @xmath62 compared to @xmath49 follows from the larger value of the former compared to the latter .",
    "the sensitivity to the purely qcd component of @xmath62 , however , is comparable to the sensitivity of @xmath49 .",
    "for example , at 100  tev @xmath63 implies @xmath64 , which is about 3% of its qcd component , a precision consistent with what we quote for @xmath10 .    in conclusion",
    ", the main motivation of our work has been the observation that the top quark charge asymmetry in @xmath65 at the lhc is larger than that of inclusive @xmath66 , being of a few percents .",
    "in addition , the lepton and @xmath67 asymmetries are very large and already present at the leading order due to the polarization of the initial fermionic line by the @xmath68 emission . as a simple application ,",
    "we have shown how the existence of an axigluon that could describe the tevatron measurements of the forward - backward asymmetry would impact @xmath69 and discussed the prospects in lhc run ii , hl - lhc and at future colliders .",
    "the @xmath70 final state will not replace the use of the @xmath9 asymmetry , particularly while the total integrated luminosity of the lhc is still below the o(100  fb@xmath71 ) . in the long term , however , it will provide a powerful probe , complementary to the @xmath9 asymmetry , and uniquely sensitive to the chiral nature of possible new physics that were to manifest itself in these measurements .",
    "we are thankful to josh mcfayden , tamara vazquez schroeder and elizaveta shabalina for drawing our attention to features in @xmath72 mc simulations that inspired this investigation .",

    "this basis is useful both at threshold , ( @xmath82 ) , where it is clear that only one amplitude , @xmath83 is non - zero , meaning that the top quarks are completely polarized , and at high energy , ( @xmath84 ) , where it is manifest that the top anti - top polarizations are opposite , @xmath85 a result which is also valid in the helicity basis  @xcite .",
    "( [ beta1 ] ) predicts the total number of events with opposite top anti - top polarization to be the same far from threshold .",
    "the polarization information is transferred to the decay products angular distributions , and in particular to the leptons that are 100% correlated with the top - quark spins .",
    "we have explicitly checked the expressions eq .",
    "( [ beamline ] ) and the analytic computation of the tree - level @xmath87 amplitude numerically to those obtained via madgraph5_amc@nlo .",
    "apart from more complicated analytic formulas the case of @xmath88 is totally analogous , as the only non - trivial effect of the @xmath2-boson emission is that of selecting a @xmath89 in the initial state .",
    "this is clearly shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : costhetaplots ] and [ fig : pseudoplots ] . in the first set of plots we show the lepton distributions from the top - quarks decay for both @xmath73 and @xmath90 in the beam - axis frame at three values of @xmath91 , one close to threshold ( 400 gev for @xmath15 and 500 gev for @xmath92 ) and increasingly far from threshold ( 1 and 8 tev ) .",
    "the two processes lead to very similar distributions .",
    "we have then considered the pseudorapidity distributions in the @xmath5 rest frame .",
    "we find that the @xmath0 and the @xmath1 pseudorapidity distributions are equal and symmetric at lo and we do not show them .",
    "the lepton distributions , however , see fig .",
    "[ fig : pseudoplots ] , display an opposite and equal forward - backward asymmetry whose shapes in the centre - of - mass frame of the @xmath15 pair are again extremely similar in @xmath73 and @xmath93 .",
    "the fact that the asymmetry is larger at threshold is a direct consequence of the fact that there the top quarks are fully polarized .",
