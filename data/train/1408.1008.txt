    "our results for the concurrence , in particular its constancy , are to some extent expected .",

    "section1 , we have : @xmath105 @xmath106 these matrices have to be inserted in between a generic state of the two - q - bit system and its adjoint , in order to obtain the corresponding contribution to the hybrid hamiltonian , cf . section1 .",
    "then , incorporating the oscillator expansion for the chosen basis , we may calculate the poisson bracket between this perturbation and the concurrence ( for pure initial states , as before in section3 ) : @xmath107 we note that this result is independent of @xmath104 , which implies that even with this kind of perturbation the entanglement of the q - bits does not evolve .",
    "thus , our results about the evolution of entanglement hold also for _ inhomogeneous q - bits_.    this is obviously true for any perturbation of the classical sector as well , because the concurrence determined by @xmath88 depends explicitly only on the quantum canonical variables @xmath29 .",
    "a different situation arises for perturbations acting on both q - bits : @xmath108 in the chosen basis , we obtain the corresponding matrix representation : @xmath109 @xmath110 calculating the poisson bracket between this kind of perturbation and the concurrence , we find : @xmath111 this implies that the entanglement evolves in time as , for example , shown in figure[concurrencepert ] .",
    "furthermore , this result is independent of @xmath112 , which means that perturbations of the form @xmath113 have no effect on the entanglement , in the chosen basis .",
    "however , looking at the figure , we see that  independently of whether the initial state is entangled or not  in general , the two - q - bit perturbations affect the entanglement .",

    "we have : @xmath117 which is zero for @xmath118 and , in particular , if only @xmath112 is nonzero . in these cases ,",
    "the dynamics of the quantum sector , especially of the entanglement , may change ; however , the force exerted by the q - bits on the classical oscillator retains its form .",
    "nevertheless , since its time dependence changes , the classical oscillator generally will be sensitive to the presence of perturbations acting only on the q - bits .",
    "in this section , we would like to point out an interesting practical aspect of the quantum - classical hybrid coupling .",
    "following hybrid theory , as we have described , it could be employed to transfer energy from the quantum to the classical sector ( _ `` hybrid cooling '' _ ) , or vice versa .",
    "while the total energy of the hybrid system is a constant of motion , the energy of the classical and quantum sectors separately changes in time , due to the coupling .",
    "furthermore , we have seen in section[concost ] that the concurrence is conserved .",
    "this means that we can cool ( or heat ) a sector of the system without changing the entanglement of the two - q - bit states .    for illustration , we have selected states that show a strong back reaction on the classical harmonic oscillator .",

    " we randomly select @xmath132 configurations , @xmath133 , for the initial conditions of the classical sector , which are distributed , however , with bias according to eqs.([gaussianinitial ] ) . then",
    ", we solve the whole set of hybrid equations of motion @xmath132 times , once for each configuration @xmath134 ; this concerns the differential equations ( [ xclmoto])([pqmmoto ] ) . with the help of these solutions ,",
    "we correspondingly obtain @xmath132 density matrices representing the two - q - bit subsystem , as before .",
    "the average of these matrices ( for @xmath132 sufficiently large ) provides an estimate of the limiting density matrix incorporating the distributed oscillator initial conditions : @xmath135 in accordance with the central limit theorem .",
    "we have performed numerical simulations for @xmath136 and observed that the results stabilize for @xmath137 .",
    "therefore , in figure[distrclas1 ] , only results for @xmath138 are presented .",
    "following ref.@xcite , an error analysis could be performed .",
    "we leave this for future work , including the development of a more powerful numerical scheme .",
    "having performed a series of simulations of this kind , we find that the time in which a maximally entangled state passes from the initially maximal to zero concurrence , is quite sensitive to the width of the gaussian initial state distribution . indeed , choosing @xmath129 , we have assumed a rather narrow initial distribution corresponding roughly to a phase space cell of size @xmath139 ( in physical units ) . to complement the present study",
    ", it will be interesting to carry out more extensive ( and computationally more demanding ) numerical simulations with wider initial phase space distributions for the classical oscillator , e.g. , of nanometer to micrometer size and momenta corresponding to small thermal energies relevant for optomechanical experiments .",
    "we have studied in this work the _ quantum - classical hybrid _ version of the versatile _ all - quantum model _ of one oscillator coupled to two q - bits @xcite . in the present case ,",
    "the oscillator is considered as classical , while the q - bits retain their full quantum features .",
    "the coupling between quantum and classical sectors has been constructed following the hybrid theory developed in refs.@xcite , a topic that has found increasing attention recently , see , for example , refs.@xcite .",
    "we haven chosen the hybrid theory developed in refs.@xcite for the present work , since earlier proposals have been beset with problems , such as , for example , violation of energy conservation or of unitarity , which has led to various `` no - go '' theorems",
    ". an extensive list of such issues has been discussed and overcome @xcite .",
    "the only other consistent formulation , as far as we know , is the theory developed by buric and collaborators @xcite , the formal results of which are , however , equivalent to the hybrid theory used here .  the configuration space theory of hall and reginatto @xcite might provide an alternative consistent framework for the description of quantum - classical hybrids under certain circumstances .",
    "however , it has been shown recently that it leads to nonlocal signaling @xcite and nonseparability of degrees of freedom that are classically and quantum mechanically separable @xcite , due to the intrisically nonlinear formulation .",
    "since these features can interfere with entanglement , we have not consulted this theory here .",
    "the present hybrid model may be adapted to experiments , in order to test the basic tenet of hybrid dynamics , namely that the direct coupling of quantum mechanical to classical degrees of freedom can be consistently formulated  be it with orientation towards approximation schemes for fully quantum mechanical yet complex systems or because of considerations of foundational issues .",
    "one may speculate that a quantum - classical hybrid coupling could be of fundamental character , when microscopic quantum degrees of freedom interact directly with macroscopic classical degrees of freedom , e.g. elementary particles , atoms , or molecules interacting with a gravitational field ( if it is and remains classical ) or quantum mechanical systems undergoing a measurement by a classical apparatus ( copenhagen interpretation ) .    by evaluating the concurrence ,",
    "we have found that entanglement present in the two - q - bit system is invariant under evolution according to the hybrid dynamics .",
    "this result may have been expected but has not been studied in a consistent dynamical theory before , except ref.@xcite .",
    "a possible application could be in quantum information protocols transferring information coherently between q - bits , yet under the controlling influence of distinct classical degrees of freedom embedded in the environment .",
    "furthermore , we have shown that the model suggests a hybrid cooling scheme , such that the energy ( temperature ) of the q - bit subsystem can be selectively lowered without affecting the quantum correlations between its components .",
    "an important question that remains to be studied further is whether other interesting aspects of a quantum object can be addressed by monitoring classical degrees of freedom coupled directly to it .",
    "the extension of our study allowing for mixed quantum states should be carried out and , more generally , incorporating decoherence and dissipation due to the environment .    on the other hand ,",
    "we have seen that if ( for example , the initial conditions of ) such classical degrees of freedom are distributed statistically , correspondingly averaged density ( sub)matrices for the q - bits show impurity and disentanglement increasing with time .",
    "this appears much like in the all - quantum version of the model and might mask desperately searched for quantum effects such as collapse or ( gravitationally induced ) spontaneous localization of the wave function , see , for example , refs.@xcite and further references therein .",
    "certainly , the study of quantum - classical hybrid systems has only begun and much more can be envisaged , be it for technologically interesting situations or be it as far - reaching as to wonder about the role of hybrids under biologically relevant circumstances .",
