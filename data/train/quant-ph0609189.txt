    "modern development of quantum information , communication and especially quantum cryptography requires the new methods and approaches in quantum information processing .",
    "a significant progress on this way can be achieved with the help of novel devices for quantum storage , memory and transmission of information embodied in optical continuous variables , i.e. in hermitian quadratures@xcite .",
    "typically , the memory devices proposed now for those purposes explore various methods of entanglement and mapping of quantum state of light onto the atomic ensembles@xcite@xmath0@xcite .",
    "one practically important and interesting possibility to store optical information is connected with the usage of effect of electromagnetically induced transparency ( eit ) taking place in three level atomic systems with @xmath1-configuration of the energy levels - see fig.1 . in this case",

    "the eit effect is accompanied with significant reduction of observable group velocity of signal pulse , as well . in ref .",
    "the authors propose to use such a `` stopped '' light for coherent ( classical ) storage of information in ultracold ( @xmath3   nk ) sodium atoms near the transition to the bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) state . in fact , the phenomenon is displayed by switching of signal pulse with delay time @xmath4 and more .",
    "the doppler effect , being limitation for the process , can be suppressed for the case .",
    "physically , quantum properties of the coupling system , i.e. signal optical pulse and atomic system under the eit condition , can be described in terms of `` bright '' and `` dark '' polaritons for atom - field excitations - see refs .  ,   for more details . the experiment has been carried out in ref .   for hot ( @xmath5  k ) atomic rb vapor cell , and quantum state transfers from the light to atomic excitations .",
    "another approach to store and transmit quantum information by memory devices has been established in ref .  .",
    "in particular , the fidelity up to @xmath6 and memory lifetime of up to @xmath7 has been achieved experimentally for gaussian light pulses using complex ( three step passing ) scheme for light - atom interaction and subsequent measurements by feedback introduced onto the atoms .    in present paper",
    "we consider also the problem of storage of quantum state of optical field by using the quantum cloning procedure for continuous variables for the light - atom interaction@xcite .",
    "it is shown@xcite@xmath2@xcite that although perfect cloning is forbidden in quantum theory the fidelity of such a process can be high enough and equal @xmath8 .    in section 2",
    "we propose quantum non - demolition ( qnd ) method to store the quantum state of light what is very closed to qnd measurement procedure in quantum and atomic optics@xcite@xmath9  @xcite . in this case",
    "the specific properties of quantum state of storage device become important .",
    "necessary criteria are formulated for estimation of efficiency of optical field storage and transmission . in section 3",
    "we consider a new scheme for optimal quantum cloning of optical field in the eit - like system . in the case",
    "a preliminary linear amplification of the signal optical pulse is absolutely necessary . in conclusion",
    "we briefly discuss appropriate application of the schemes proposed in the paper for the problem of quantum cryptography with continuous variables . in appendix",

    "another possibility , what is important for us in the paper , is based on achieving of eit regime for atom - field interaction@xcite .",
    "thus , we will describe the bright ( light ) and dark ( matter ) polaritons in eit - like medium ( being the result of excitation of quantum coupled state for optical field and matter ) by unitary linear transformation for two annihilation operators @xmath15 and @xmath16 , respectively , in the form :    @xmath17    where @xmath18 is the annihilation operator for signal ( probe ) field at the input of atomic medium . in the schwinger bosons representation@xcite spin operator",

    "the physical schemes proposed by us can be useful in problem of quantum cryptography for the first time .",
    "recently , various quantum key distribution ( qkd ) protocols have been proposed for continuous variables@xcite@xmath9@xcite@xmath9@xcite@xmath9@xcite .",
    "in particular , it have been shown ( see e.g. ref .  ) that for individual eavesdropping by beam splitter or cloning machines ( when we have less than 3  db total losses in the channel ) these protocols are secure whenever @xmath136 ( @xmath137 is information rate between alice and bob ( eve ) ) with the usage of special reconciliation and privacy amplification procedure . however , in some cases it is possible to create secure key beyond the 3  db limit when @xmath138 ( or @xmath139 ) with the help of appropriate postselection procedure@xcite@xmath9@xcite .",
    "in general the information rates for gaussian channels depends on signal - to - noise ratio and , more precisely , on the variance of quadrature components measured by eve . from our point of view the schemes proposed by us in fig.2 and fig.4 can be used by eve for individual attacks on the communication channel . in this case",

    "here we analyze the process of stimulated raman two - photon photoassociation in the presence of the eit effect .",
    "the approach to the problem is based on the stimulated raman adiabatic passage ( stirap ) procedure resulting in coherent coupling of the long life time levels in free atoms and as a result , in establishment of molecular states .",
    "the process can be described in formalism of the @xmath1-scheme in fig.1 .",
