    "as large agglomerations of macroscopic particles , granular materials are ubiquitous in nature , industries and our daily lives  @xcite . due to the energy dissipation through particle - particle interactions , continuous energy injection is necessary to keep a granular material in a stationary state which is typically far from thermodynamic equilibrium .",
    "thus , an important key to understand the dynamics of granular materials is to analyze the balance between energy injection and dissipation . for binary impacts , the coefficient of restitution , which was introduced by newton  @xcite as the ratio between the relative rebound and impact velocities , provides a convenient way of characterizing the energy dissipation in fluidized granular systems  @xcite . over centuries , continuous investigations have led to substantial progresses in understanding how the energy is dissipated ( e.g. , through viscoelastic or plastic deformations  @xcite ) . moreover ,",
    "the adhesive interactions arising from the surface energy of the deformed particles have also been considered in predicting the cor  @xcite , using the well established johnson - kendall - roberts ( jkr ) model  @xcite .    here , we focus on the case of a liquid film covering the solid bodies under impact , in order to shed light on the collective behavior of wet granular matter at a particle level .",
    "recent investigations have revealed that clustering  @xcite , phase transitions  @xcite as well as pattern formation  @xcite of wet granular matter are often related to the ` microscopic ' particle - particle interactions , among which the wetting liquid plays an important role . because the presence of a liquid film as thin as a few nanometers can be sufficient to influence the rigidity of granular matter substantially  @xcite , it is essential to consider such an influence in the omnipresent applications .",
    "for example , it is associated with the modeling of natural disasters such as debris flow and volcano eruptions  @xcite , and the granulation process in chemical engineering and pharmaceutics industries  @xcite .    in the past decades",
    ", there has been a growing interest in understanding the energy dissipation associated with wet impacts in order to predict the wet cor  @xcite . in the low reynolds number regime where the viscosity of the wetting liquid dominates",
    ", the stokes number was found to be the relevant parameter determining the influence of the size and density of the particles , as well as the viscosity of the liquid on the cor of binary as well as three - body collisions  @xcite .",
    "the stokes number is defined as @xmath4 with particle density @xmath5 , particle diameter @xmath1 , impact velocity @xmath6 , and the dynamic viscosity of the liquid @xmath7 . in the case of relatively high reynolds number where the inertia of the liquid can not be ignored",
    ", a former investigation  @xcite revealed that the dimensionless liquid film thickness @xmath8 ( film thickness over particle diameter ) starts to play an additional role .",
    "for @xmath9 , the dependency of the wet cor on various particle and liquid properties was characterized with the stokes number  @xcite . despite of this progress",
    ", it is still unclear how the dimensionless film thickness influences the wet cor quantitatively . in this work ,",
    "we explore this influence through a systematic tuning of @xmath10 in the experiments and compare the results with a model considering the liquid mediated energy loss during the impact .",
    "as illustrated in fig.[fig : setup ] , we perform free - fall experiments to measure the normal cor of a wet spherical particle bouncing on the bottom of a rectangular glass container covered with a liquid film . the bottom plate is leveled within @xmath11degrees to ensure a homogeneous film thickness , which is measured optically from the deflection of an oblique laser beam shined from below the container .",
    "a more detailed description of this method can be found in ref .",
    "two types of silicone oil ( wacker ak10 and carl roth m50 , see table[tab : liq ] for the specifications ) are used as wetting liquids .",
    "two types of particles ( spherotech , g2 ) , polytetrafluorethylen ( ptfe ) with a density of @xmath12g@xmath13@xmath14 and polyethylene ( pe ) with a density of @xmath15g@xmath13@xmath14 , are used . for each combination of particle type and wetting liquid , we vary systematically @xmath0 such that @xmath10 grows stepwise from @xmath16 to @xmath17 .",
    "the diameters of the spherical particles are @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 mm for pe particles , and @xmath21 , @xmath19 and @xmath22 mm for ptfe particles .",

    "the impact velocity is tuned via adjusting the initial falling height from @xmath25 cm to @xmath26 cm .",
    "after the wetting liquid is poured into the container , we wait for at least @xmath27 minutes for the liquid film thickness to become stable .",
    "the free fall motion of an initially wet particle is triggered by tuning the air pressure in the nozzle .",
    "when the free - falling particle enters the field of interest , a computer controlled high speed camera ( lumenera lt225 ) starts to take images .",
    "subsequently , the images [ see the inset of fig .  [",

    "before characterizing the wet cor and the associated energy dissipation from the wetting liquid , we measure the dry cor as a reference . as shown in the upper panels of fig.[fig : envi ] , the dry cor decreases with the @xmath6 for both ptfe and pe particles , in agreement with former experiments and theories  @xcite . qualitatively speaking",
    ", the maximum normal strain of the solid bodies reduces with growing impact velocity , therefore the smaller the @xmath6 , the closer the deformation is to an elastic one with @xmath32 . following the nonlinear viscoelastic model  @xcite and taking the first order approximation",
    ", we fit the measured data with @xmath33 [ dashed lines in fig.[fig : envi](a ) and ( c ) ] and obtain @xmath34 and @xmath35 for ptfe and pe particles , respectively .",
    "the cor measured with larger @xmath1 yields a slightly smaller @xmath36 . however , the difference is small in comparison with the experimental uncertainty .    figure  [ fig : envi](a ) shows the wet cor as a function of @xmath6 for ptfe particles . for most cases , @xmath36 grows monotonically with the impact velocity .",
    "the solid lines correspond to the fits of the data sets with @xmath37 .",
    "see the following sec .",
    "[ sec : theo ] for a justification of the fit . for the case of @xmath38 m and less viscous ak10 wetting",
    ", @xmath36 decays with the increase of @xmath6 .",
    "this exception is presumably due to the influence of the dry cor , because the energy loss from the wetting liquid decreases as the liquid film thickness or viscosity decreases .",
    "indeed the decay shows the same trend as that of the dry cor ( gray dashed curve ) , but with a shift of @xmath39 .",
    "as the focus of this investigation is on the influence of the wetting liquid , we keep @xmath40 m in the following analysis .",
    "the error bars , which represent the standard error arising from various runs of experiments , are within the size of the symbols for most of the parameters .",
    "such a good reproducibility suggests that the initial condition of the particle ( e.g. , its degree of wetting ) plays a minor role .    as shown in fig.2(c ) , @xmath36 obtained with pe particles and less viscous wetting liquid also grows monotonically with @xmath6 and decreases with growing film thickness @xmath0 . in agreement with the results obtained with ptfe particles , increasing the liquid viscosity or",
    "the film thickness yields smaller @xmath36 , since the energy dissipation through the viscous drag force increases . for the more viscous wetting liquid m50 , less",
    "data points are obtained within the explored range of @xmath6 , because the particles hardly rebound , owing to the relatively small ratio of the particle inertia to the viscous force .    in the lower panels of fig.[fig : envi ] , we show the scaling of the wet cor with the stokes number at a fixed @xmath41 . for both types of particles ,",
    "@xmath36 obtained for various @xmath7 , @xmath1 , and @xmath6 is found to decay linearly with @xmath42 .",
    "such a scaling reveals that the influences of liquid viscosity , particle size , and impact velocity are coupled with each other through the stokes number .",
    "the linear fit gives rise to two critical values : a critical wet cor @xmath43 at @xmath44 and a critical stokes number @xmath45 below which no rebound occurs .",
    "note that @xmath43 is smaller than @xmath46 for both ptfe and pe particles .",
    "therefore we can not estimate the saturated value of the wet cor at infinitely large @xmath6 with @xmath46 if the liquid inertia does play a role ( i.e. , the reynolds number is not sufficiently small ) . here , the reynolds number @xmath47 ranges from @xmath48 to @xmath49 at the beginning of impact . during the impact",
    ", @xmath50 decreases with @xmath6 , suggesting that the viscous drag force plays a more and more prominent role in comparison to the inertia of the liquid .",
    "note that the reynolds number and the stokes number are coupled to each other with @xmath51 , where @xmath52 is the density ratio between the liquid and the particle .",
    "+    since the scaling of @xmath36 with st suggests a convenient way of predicting the wet cor with @xmath43 and @xmath45 , it is intuitive to step further and explore what determines the two fit parameters as well as possible ways to predict them . motivated by this question",
    ", we vary systematically @xmath10 and check its influence on the scaling .",
    "figure  [ fig : varfilm ] shows the dependency of @xmath36 with st@xmath2 for various dimensionless film thicknesses .",
    "for both ptfe ( a ) and pe ( b ) particles , the linear decay of @xmath36 with st@xmath2 is prominent for all @xmath10 .",
    "moreover , the data obtained with various @xmath10 tend to collapse into a line . for pe particles ,",
    "the upper limit of @xmath10 is smaller than that of ptfe particles , owing to the lack of rebound with thick liquid films .",
    "note that in the lowest st@xmath2 region , @xmath36 may grow with st@xmath2 , particularly for the smallest @xmath10 .",
    "this feature could be attributed to the influence from the dry cor , because , as we learned from the discussion of fig.[fig : envi](a ) , the dependency of the dry cor on @xmath6 dominates for a relatively thin and less viscous liquid film .",
    "a closer analysis of the data reveals the influence of @xmath10 : data obtained with small @xmath10 lie above the fitted line , while data obtained with large @xmath10 do the opposite . in order to have a more quantitative analysis of such a dependency",
    ", we fit the data individually for each @xmath10 .",
    "figure  [ fig : par ] shows the fit parameters @xmath43 and @xmath45 as a function of @xmath10 . as shown in ( a ) , the critical wet cor decays monotonically with @xmath10 until it saturates at @xmath53 for ptfe particles . for the case of pe particles , the range of @xmath10 is limited due to the reason described above .",
    "within the limited range , the dependency of @xmath43 on @xmath10 agrees with the results obtained with ptfe particles within the error . as shown in ( b ) , the critical stokes number , @xmath45 , grows monotonically with @xmath10 for both ptfe and pe particles . within the common range of @xmath10",
    ", we also find a good agreement between the results obtained with ptfe and pe particles .",
    "such an agreement suggests that the wetting liquid plays a dominant role in determining both fit parameters . at the limit of @xmath54 ( i.e. , dry impact ) ,",
    "we expect @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "as the dimensionless film thickness grows , the amount of energy taken by the inertia as well as viscosity of the liquid increases correspondingly .",
    "therefore , we can qualitatively understand the trend of @xmath43 and @xmath45 as an indication of the enhanced energy loss from the liquid phase . in the following section",
    ", a more quantitative description of the influence will be presented .",
    "following the above analysis , we present a model to explain the scaling with the stokes number and discuss the possibility of predicting @xmath43 and @xmath45 .    according to its definition",
    ", the coefficient of restitution can be written as    @xmath57    where @xmath58 with particle volume @xmath59 is the kinetic energy of the particle before the impact and @xmath60 is the total amount of energy loss during the impact .",
    "@xmath60 includes the energy dissipation associated with inelastic solid body interactions  @xmath61 and the additional contribution from the wetting liquid @xmath62 .",
    "assuming that the two sources of kinetic energy loss are not coupled with each other , we have    @xmath63    where @xmath64 is the cor for dry impact .",
    "the energy loss from the wetting liquid @xmath62 has three main contributions : surface energy due to the distorted liquid surface in both penetrating and rebouncing regimes , kinetic energy of the wetting liquid being mobilized @xmath65 , and the energy dissipation from the viscous drag force @xmath66 . following a former investigation  @xcite , the rupture energy of a liquid bridge formed as a particle rebounds can be estimated with @xmath67 with the liquid surface tension @xmath68 and the volume of the liquid bridge @xmath69 .",
    "for the range of particle size explored here , this energy dissipation is ignorable because it is at least one order of magnitude smaller than @xmath62 , even for the lowest @xmath6  @xcite .",
    "note that @xmath70 is independent on @xmath6 , while both of the other two contributions grow with @xmath6 .",
    "taking the other two terms into account , eq .",
    "[ eq : enedis ] can be rewritten as    @xmath71    as the velocity of the liquid being pushed sidewards @xmath72 arises from the penetration of the particle into the liquid film , we consider @xmath73 ( see below for a more quantitative analysis ) .",
    "consequently , we have @xmath74 . as the viscous drag force @xmath75",
    ", we consider the corresponding energy dissipation term @xmath76 .",
    "thus , eq.[eq : enedis2 ] can be rewritten as    @xmath77    where @xmath78 and @xmath79 are @xmath6 independent parameters .",
    "it indicates that the inertia of the wetting liquid contributes to a constant offset to @xmath80 , while its combination with the viscous damping determines the factors of higher order terms . since @xmath81 , the linear decay of @xmath36 with",
    "@xmath42 observed above can be treated as a first order approximation of eq.[eq : envi ] .",
    "moreover , eq.[eq : envi ] can be used to predict the two fit parameters . on one hand , @xmath43 , the wet cor at st@xmath82 ,",
    "can be estimated with    @xmath83    it shows that the saturated value of the wet cor is always smaller than @xmath46 , in agreement with the experimental results shown in fig.[fig : envi ] .",
    "moreover , eq.[eq : ec ] indicates that the difference between @xmath46 and @xmath43 arises from the energy taken by the inertia of the wetting liquid .",
    "on the other hand , a former analysis based on the lubrication theory  @xcite shows that    @xmath84    where @xmath85 and @xmath86 are the rupture distance of the liquid bridge and the roughness of the particle , respectively .",
    "the two length scales arise from the limits of the separation distance within which the viscous force takes effect . in this estimation",
    ", it was assumed that the lubrication force applies during the whole impact period .",
    "this assumption becomes violated if the liquid film thickness is much larger than the critical separation distance @xmath87 , below which the lubrication theory applies  @xcite . since the lubrication theory predicts a diverging viscous force as the separation distance approaches @xmath88 , we may consider that most of the energy loss due to the viscous force takes place within @xmath87 and estimate the viscous damping term with    @xmath89    inserting it into the definition of @xmath90 , we have    @xmath91    note the essential role of the stokes number here .",
    "inserting eqs.[eq : ec ] and [ eq : beta ] into eq.[eq : envi ] and taking the first order approximation , we have    @xmath92    with the critical stokes number    @xmath93    thus , the scaling of @xmath36 with the stokes number observed in the experiments is captured by the model .    as the next step",
    ", we discuss the dependency of the fit parameters on @xmath10 . starting from a former analysis  @xcite",
    ", we characterize the relative energy loss from the inertial effect with    @xmath94    where @xmath95 is the volume of the liquid being expelled .",
    "the factor @xmath96 arises from the existence of inertial effects in both penetrating ( liquid being repelled from the gap ) and rebouncing ( liquid being sucked into the gap ) regimes . here",
    ", the horizontal velocity of the liquid @xmath72 is estimated with the base radius of the spherical cap over the penetrating time @xmath97 , where the particle is assumed to penetrate through the liquid film with the impact velocity @xmath6 . as sketched in the inset of fig.[fig : eint](a ) , the air liquid interface is assumed to be flat for the sake of simplicity .",
    "the additional influence from surface waves or the meniscus of a liquid bridge , which can lead to a modification of the kinetic energy being transferred from the particle to the liquid , will be a focus of further investigations .",
    "stepping further , we propose a more detailed model for @xmath72 , considering the stepwise approaching and receding of the particle . as illustrated in the inset of fig.[fig : eint](a ) , we consider the case of a spherical particle penetrating into a liquid film from a depth of @xmath98 ( solid circle ) to @xmath99 ( long dashed circle ) . assuming the immersed part to be a spherical cap , we can estimate the volume of liquid being pushed sidewards with @xmath100 and the radius of the three phase contact line with the base radius @xmath101 . as the dimension of the container is much larger than that of the particle , we consider the film thickness @xmath0 to be constant during the impact .",
    "consequently , we have @xmath102 and a corresponding horizontal movement of    @xmath103    due to momentum transfer , the liquid surrounding the particle is accelerated in the direction normal to the contact surface .",
    "however , the presence of the horizontal plane effectively guides the streamline to the horizontal direction .",
    "suppose the change of flow direction is extremely efficient , we can estimate the velocity of the liquid being pushed sidewards with    @xmath104    where @xmath105 is the dimensionless penetration depth . as @xmath73 , the relative energy loss due to inertia of the liquid at each penetration step is independent of @xmath6 .",
    "thus , an integration of @xmath106 over the whole traveling distance leads to    @xmath107    note that in the receding regime , the flow of the liquid is reverted .",
    "again , the factor @xmath96 arises from the assumption that the kinetic energy gained by the liquid in both approaching and receding regimes is the same .    according to eq .",
    "[ eq : ec ] , @xmath108 can be obtained experimentally with @xmath109 . as eq .",
    "[ eq : eint1 ] and [ eq : eint2 ] both suggest that @xmath110 contributes only a constant factor in @xmath65 , it is intuitive to compare the wet cor obtained with different types of particles using @xmath111 . here",
    ", we obtain @xmath46 from the fits of dry cor shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : envi ] . instead of the unrealistic value of @xmath112 at @xmath113",
    ", we choose the one at @xmath114 m/s , which corresponds to the upper limit of the impact velocity used in the dry cor measurements .    as shown in fig.[fig : eint](a ) , such a comparison reveals a similar trend for both types of particles : a monotonic growth with @xmath10 followed by a saturated value of @xmath115 .",
    "the results from both ptfe and pe particles agree with each other within the error .",
    "such an agreement supports the outcome of the above analysis , i.e. , the energy loss due to the inertia of the wetting liquid accounts for the difference between @xmath46 and @xmath43 . as",
    "@xmath110 for ptfe and pe particles differs by a factor of @xmath116 , the agreement also supports the scaling of the relative energy dissipation @xmath108 with @xmath110 .",
    "moreover , a comparison with the predictions of the two models reveals that the simplified model originally introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite overestimates the influence from inertia , particularly for @xmath117 .",
    "the new model considering stepwise penetrations shown in eq .",
    "[ eq : eint2 ] provides a better approximation , but it still can not capture the saturation of @xmath43 at larger @xmath10 .",
    "this is presumably due to the assumption that all the momentum transfer to the liquid ends up in the horizontal direction . in the future ,",
    "more detailed investigations on the flow field inside the liquid film at impact are necessary to have a better prediction of @xmath43 .",
    "concerning the critical stokes number , eq.[eq : stc ] suggests that it depends on @xmath10 through its inverse proportionality with @xmath118 , as well as on the ratio @xmath119 .",
    "because of the logarithmic scale , the latter influence is relatively weak",
    ". therefore , one could consider st@xmath120 .",
    "as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : eint](b ) , this argument is supported by the experimental results , because @xmath121 stays roughly constant at @xmath122 for the common range of @xmath10 explored for both types of particles . following eq .",
    "[ eq : stc ] , this value corresponds to a critical separation distance of @xmath123 m .",
    "it is a reasonable value because , for all @xmath0 used in the experiments , the length scale associated with the wet region of the particle ( i.e. , base radius of the spherical cap immersed in the liquid @xmath124 ) is at least one order of magnitude larger than @xmath87 . in the range of @xmath125",
    ", @xmath121 obtained with ptfe particles tends to grow slightly with @xmath10 .",
    "this can be attributed to the dependency of @xmath87 on the film thickness  @xcite .",
    "finally , the above analysis leads to an analytical prediction of the wet coefficient of restitution as a function of @xmath126 :    @xmath127    where @xmath128 can be treated as a constant factor for @xmath129 , and @xmath43 can be estimated with    @xmath130    such a prediction will be helpful in large scale computer simulations of wet granular flow , and hence shed light on the widespread applications such as granulation process in chemical engineering , debris flow or volcano eruption in geophysics as well as multiphase flow in civil engineering  @xcite .",
    "to summarize , this investigation shows that the linear dependency of the cor for wet particle impacts with st@xmath2 is robust against a variation of the dimensionless liquid film thickness @xmath10 , and such a dependency can be rationalized with a model considering the kinetic energy loss from the inertia as well as viscous force of the liquid .",
    "it suggests the possibility of predicting the wet cor with two fit parameters : the critical wet cor @xmath43 as st@xmath82 and the critical stokes number @xmath45 for a rebound to occur .",
    "based on a systematic variation of both film thickness and particle size , we discuss how @xmath10 influences the fit parameters .",
    "we find that @xmath43 is predominately determined by the inertia of the liquid .",
    "considering the stepwise kinetic energy gain of the wetting liquid at impact , we present an analytical estimation of @xmath43",
    ". moreover , the model predicts st@xmath120 with a factor related to the ratio between two length scales ; i.e. , the critical separation distance for the lubrication theory to apply and the roughness of the particle .",
    "therefore , st@xmath131 can also be predicted analytically .    in the future ,",
    "a more detailed analysis of the flow field as well as surface waves caused by the impact is necessary to clarify the discrepancy between the experiments and the model in order to have a more accurate determination of the wet coefficient of restitution .",
    "in addition , the influence from the cavitation dynamics  @xcite should also be addressed .",

    "<S> the normal coefficient of restitution ( cor ) for a spherical particle bouncing on a wet plane is investigated experimentally and compared with a model characterizing the energy loss at impact . for fixed ratios of liquid film thickness @xmath0 to particle diameter @xmath1 , the wet cor </S>",

    "<S> such a dependency suggests a convenient way of predicting the wet cor with two fit parameters : a critical cor at infinitely large st and a critical st at zero cor . </S>",
