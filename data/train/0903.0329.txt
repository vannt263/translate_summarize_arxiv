    "anomalous x - ray pulsars ( axps ) and soft gamma repeaters ( sgrs ) are part of a new class of neutron stars ( nss ) , whose emission mechanisms commute with neither accreting x - ray pulsars nor radio pulsars ( psrs ) . their periods are clustered between 2 - 12 s and",
    "they are characterized by their rapid spin down ( @xmath2 ) and high quiescent luminosities ( @xmath3 ) that can not be explained by spin down mechanisms .",
    "they also show wide range of variability ; including flux and pulse profile variations ( dib , kaspi & gavriil 2007a ; tam et al .",
    "2008 ) , glitches ( dib , kaspi & gavriil 2007b ) , bursts ( gavriil , kaspi & woods 2002 ) and strong timing noise ( baykal et al .",
    "2000 ; kaspi , gavriil & chakrabarty et al .",
    "three sgrs are known to exhibit giant bursts ( sgr 0526 - 66 , sgr 1900 + 14 , sgr 1806 - 20 ) , which in two of these objects rapid quasi - periodic oscillations ( qpos ) are detected after the onset of their flares ( sgr 1900 + 14 ; strohmayer & watts 2005 , sgr 1806 - 20 ; israel et al .",
    "2005 ) .",
    "sgrs and axps are widely accepted as being magnetars , neutron stars ( nss ) with magnetic fields strengths  greater than the quantum critical level ( @xmath4 gauss ) , whose main source of energy is the  dissipation of these fields ( duncan & thompson 1992 ; thompson & duncan 1995 ) . the magnetar model for these objects explains the sgr bursts and the large flares , and it predicted the axp bursts which occurred in 1e 1048.1 - 5937 ( gavriil , kaspi & woods 2002 ) and 1e 2259 + 586 ( gavriil & kaspi 2002 ) .",
    "thompson & duncan ( 1995 ) argue that the bursts are due to crustal cracking as a result of magnetic diffusion , and that the large flares are due to major reconfigurations of the  global magnetic field ( thompson & duncan 1995 ) .",
    "magnetar strength magnetic fields can also account for  the rapid spin down of these objects and the qpos observed during large flares ( e.g , israel et al .",
    "2005 ; strohmayer & watts 2005 ) .",
    "the existence of a fossil disk , and accretion from it , has also been proposed to explain the persistent properties of these sources ( van paradijs et al .",
    "1995 ; chatterjee et al .",
    "2000 ; alpar 2001 ) . however , this model  has difficulty explaining the giant flares , repeat bursts and the pulsed optical emission that exists in this class of objects .     in this paper , we investigated the properties of the broad - band noise in selected axps and sgrs , and present plausible origins for it within the context of the above two models .",
    "for example , if  axps and sgrs have fall - back disks that they accrete from , as has been suggested by  ertan et al .",
    "( 2007 ) , then we can compare this noise to that of other accreting sources .",
    "for instance , the broad - band noise in x - ray binaries spans a very broad range and  is due to variable x - ray flux from the accretion disk . in corona hosting x - ray binaries , a contribution of the noise in the high frequency range is due to photon delays in compton up scattered radiation ( van der klis 2006 and references therein ) .",
    "this is important given that axps and sgrs show hard power law like tails in their energy spectra that are also most likely due to photons being up - scattered in energy .  in the context of the magnetar model , these hard - tails in axps and sgrs",
    "have been successfully modeled by resonant cyclotron scattering ( lyutikov & gavriil 2006 ; rea et al .",
    "we argue that resonant cyclotron scattering  can also introduce broad band noise in the frequency range observed for these sources .",
    "thus , in order to discriminate between the two models it becomes of great interest to study the broad - band noise in axps and sgrs .",

    "_ on the other hand , we caution that given the sparsity of this event , and the possibility that similar bursts went unnoticed , this start for the rise in noise is not as clear as in 1e 2259 + 586 .",
    "we also note that this increase in red noise is not very correlated with a large increase in persistent and pulsed flux in the early stages until the outburst - like flux increase . prior to its burst at 53185 mjd and the broad - band noise increase ,",
    "there was a slight decrease of red noise during which two sgr - like short bursts ( 52211 mjd and 52227 mjd ) and two flares ( 52218 mjd and 52444 mjd ) appeared ( gavriil , kaspi & woods 2002 ; gavriil & kaspi 2004 ) .",

    "the drop of the broad - band noise showed a brief increase in the second flare ( maximum at 52444.4 mjd , see fig .",

    "the broad - band noise of axps and sgrs can be compared with the other isolated pulsars or x - ray binaries on the basis of their origin ( e.g. , accretion process , coronal activity , rotational variation ) .",
    "broad - band noise in x - ray binaries is a result of aperiodic x - ray flux variability in the form of continuum noise and qpos with frequencies ranging from several mhz to more than thousand hz ( hasinger @xmath24 van der klis , 1989 , van der klis 2000,2006 ) .",
    "the flattening in the lower frequencies resemble psd in disk - fed x - ray binaries , specifically the low hard state ( ls ) noise of black hole candidates and the very low frequency noise ( vlfn ) of low - magnetic field neutron star lmxbs ( van der klis , 2006 and references therein ) .",
    "a flat topped noise arises in black hole candidates with large integrated rms noise level ( @xmath25 ) in the low frequencies ( van der klis 2006 ) .",
    "the vlfn of lmxbs show the flat topped noise with a few percent integrated rms and the continuum power law component shows indices between ( -)1.5 - 2 , in general a range which holds for all the x - ray binaries ( van der klis 2006 ) .",
    "the vlfn of the x - ray binaries is correlated with @xmath26 variations associated with an accretion disk and plausibly related to unsteady nuclear burning ( van der klis 2006 ) .",
    "the structure of the flattening in the psd sample of axps and sgrs resembles the vlfn of accreting x - ray binaries .    if one assumes that the variable x - ray flux originates from an accretion disk with a size between 1@xmath2710@xmath28 cm to 1@xmath2710@xmath29 cm , ( values obtained from ertan et al .",
    "2007 ) the range of keplerian frequencies ( r@xmath30 = gm@xmath31/4@xmath32 ) that should appear in the continuum noise is then from 0.058 hz to 2@xmath2710@xmath33 hz .",
    "this range overlaps with the detected range of broad - band noise in our work which supports that we could be detecting noise from the fall - back accretion disks suggested to exist in these systems ( ertan et al .",
    "however , the variations of this noise does not resemble the case for x - ray binary sources ( see figure 5 ) . in x - ray binaries",
    "outburst effects last for a few days to a week ( where one detects a change in the broad - band noise level , as well ) . the persistent level of emission changes with accretion rate from high states to low states of x - ray binary sources while one also detects reallocation of broad - band noise from high frequencies into low frequencies .",
    "on the other hand , in our entire data set we did not detect any reallocation of noise , the noise we detected always appeared in the 0.05 - 0.005 hz range and our timescale for increased noise or high level of broad - band noise lasted for over a year or two which is not a detected phenomenon in x - ray binaries .                as discussed in the above paragraphs we favor that the changes in the band limited low frequency noise in magnetars are related most likely to the burst characteristics .",
    "glitches seem to be the least effective of all in the broad - band noise changes from these sources .",
    "as discussed in the above paragraph , one origin for the detected broad - band noise in axp and sgrs could be the suggested fall - back disks around these objects with the aforementioned caveats .",
    "the origin of this noise could also be partially related to the frequency fluctuations of the neutron stars as in isolated pulsars and also to the variability that arises from the up - scattered radiation in their magnetospheres , particularly enhanced in the presence of a magnetar corona ( beloborodov & thompson 2005 , beloborodov & thompson 2007 ) .",
    "the plasma coronae in magnetars are a result of the starquakes and twisting of the magnetosphere that injects an electric current ( i.e. , plasma ) into the stellar magnetosphere ( beloborodov & thompson 2005 , beloborodov & thompson 2007 ) .",
    "emerging currents are maintained during the x - ray outburst and a dense thermalized plasma is present in the magnetosphere ( lasting from 1 - 10 years ) .",
    "broad - band noise due to processes such as photon delays between soft and hard x - ray photons are well studied in x - ray binary sources , however such timescales are much shorter like a few milliseconds as a result of compton - up scattering ( in the presence of thompson optical depth ) from disk coronae ( e.g. , vaughan et al . 1994 , schulz & wijers 1993 ) which yields a continuum noise in very high frequencies in comparison with the frequency range we detect here ( within 256 sec ) .",
    "however , the processes in the magnetosphere of axps and sgrs are more complicated .",
    "lyutikov & gavriil ( 2006 ) shows that magnetospheric plasma can distort the thermal x - ray emission emerging from the star surface by repeated scatterings at the cyclotron resonance ( e.g. , resonant cyclotron scattering ) .",
    "recently , rea et al . (",
    "2008 ) showed that an x - ray spectral model that involves resonant cyclotron scattering ( together with a blackbody model ) successfully fits the soft x - ray emission ( 1 - 10 kev data ) of ten magnetars . if the dominant scattering process is the resonant scattering rather than thompson scattering ( as shown by rea et al .",
    "2008 ) , then since the thompson optical depth to scattering is different than resonant scattering optical depth , the escape times of photons from the magnetosphere or an existing magnetar corona will be different in comparison with a simple disk corona where thompson scattering optical depth dominates ( as photons are compton up - scattered in the corona ) .",
    "once escape times differ , so will the time delays between soft and hard photons will be different in a resonant scattering dominated plasma .",
    "rea et al . ( 2008 ) calculates the ratio of optical depths as @xmath34/@xmath35 = 10@xmath36 which strongly suggests that given similar geometries the high level of resonant optical depth to scattering should cause more delays in the emerging photons .",
    "if one assumes that scattering optical depth is directly proportional to number of scatterings , a millisecond delay then should become about 100 sec delay , that could yield noise around 0.01 hz .",
    "we suggest that especially for 1e 2259 + 586 this scattering can produce or contribute to the band - limited red noise we detect in the 0.005 - 0.05 hz band and its changes .",
    "this is , also , supported by the commensurability of 2 years rise in noise we detect in two axps and the magnetar coronal time scale of 1 - 10 years ( time scale the magnetar corona exists ) . moreover ,",
    "the increase in the photon indices of power - law tails in the x - ray spectra : for 1e 2259 + 586 , @xmath37 increases from -4.3 to -2.8 after the outburst ( woods et al .",

    "characteristic of the activity is important for inducing such a process , e.g. a long burst or an outburst like characteristics are necessary to produce such effects of highly increased broad - band noise levels . glitches or flares show no effect or slight variations in noise levels .",
    "this supported by nearly stable band limited noise levels of 1rxs j1708 - 40 and 1e 1841 - 045 which show only glitches and no bursts .",
    "pulsar / magnetar / main.html ] moreover , isolated pulsars that show glitches do not show such long term significant rises in red noise levels in the low frequency band .",
    "other models explaining the magnetar timing variabilities are ruled out mostly because of their time scales . for example , seismic vibrations that are used to explain qpos are very rapid and connected to giant bursts , and thus is not a satisfactory explanation for broad - band noise .",
    "one modifying principle for the seismic models is the propagation of alfvn waves towards the core .",
    "levin ( 2006 ) noted that these oscillations are a continuum , but they decay rapidly thus effectively they can not correspond to our persistent rms noise observations .",
    "we observed broad - band noise ( bln ) in the four axps ( 1e 1048.1 - 5937 , 1rxs 1708 - 40 , 1e 1841 - 045 and 1e 2259 + 586 ) and an sgr ( sgr 1806 - 20 ) mainly over the 0.005 - 0.05 hz frequency band .",
    "the integrated rms values were in a range 2.5 - 15@xmath0 for four sources and 0@xmath0 rms for 1e 2259 + 586 before bursts .",
    "after bursts ( our data do not include burst / outburst epochs ) 20 - 70@xmath0 integrated rms noise was observed in two cases ; 1e 2259 + 586 and 1e 1048.1 - 5937 , respectively .",
    "the broad - band noise characteristics do not resemble either the accreting x - ray binaries or the isolated pulsars completely .    in general , we found that the four sources indicate a persistent level of integrated rms in time over a long base line of 3.55.5 years which may be affected by noise from frequency fluctuations , and most likely as a result of variability due to resonant cyclotron scattering in a magnetar coronae and/or variability from existing fall - back disks around these objects .",
    "we also detected large scale changes of the broad - band noise particularly due to long burst / outbursts .",
    "sgr - like bursts did not produce these type of variations in broad - band red noise , however we believe that this is limited with the sensitivity of rxte ( also its background ) and statistical quality of rxte light curves .",
    "we calculate that 1e 2259 + 586 displays high level of broad - band noise lasting for a timescale of 2 years following its outburst and glitch .",
    "in addition , we observed significant rise of the rms broad - band noise level in 1e 1048.1 - 5937 for about 1.95 years , after the burst epoch at 53185 mjd .",
    "we believe that this noise can relate to the existence of remnant disks suggested to exist around these objects , but the timescale of changes after burst / outbursts are inconsistent with the observations in x - ray binaries .",
    "we stress that the changes in the broad - band noise levels are related to resonant cyclotron up - scattered radiation in axp and sgr spectra .",
    "correlation with long bursts and outbursts indicates an origin in the variability associated with the magnetar coronae .",
    "the typical timescales of existence of magnetar coronae of 1 - 10 years is consistent with the long term variation of bln detected in our work .",
