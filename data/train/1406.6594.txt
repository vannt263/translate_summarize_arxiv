    "is everything known about anderson localization@xcite ?",
    "the answer is , surprisingly , negative . since in real devices",
    "we can not completely get rid of disorder , the subject , although over 56 years old , still remains an active part of condensed matter physics and from time to time holds surprises ( see recent activity in topological insulators and superconductors).@xcite    anderson localization is a phenomenon of complex quantum interference of electron waves in a disordered medium and also occurs for classical waves in disordered media . the extended states ( ballistic or diffusive ) of a metal turn into the exponentially localized states of an insulator which are restricted to a finite region of a disordered system .",
    "the extension of states is measured by their localization length @xmath8 , which is infinite for extended states and finite for localized states .",
    "the states cease to be extended when the disorder @xmath9 exceeds some critical value @xmath10 .",
    "the main result of the so - called scaling theory of localization @xcite is that in the absence of symmetry breaking mechanisms ( e.g.  of time - reversal symmetry due to a magnetic field @xmath11 or of spin rotation symmetry due to spin - orbit coupling soc ) a non - zero critical disorder ( @xmath12 ) exists for the localization of all states in @xmath13 , while the states become localized ( have non - infinite @xmath8 s ) even for infinitesimally small disorder ( @xmath14 ) in @xmath0 and @xmath15.@xcite    the subject is still active both experimentally and theoretically for at least three reasons : first , there is a large variety of situations that depend on the kinds of disorder and the symmetry of the hamiltonian , e.g. the 10 symmetry classes of localization , @xcite and the crossover behavior between them .",
    "those symmetry classes are the three basic , orthogonal , unitary ( in the presence of magnetic field @xmath11 ) , and symplectic ( systems with spin - orbit - coupling ( soc ) ) , the 3 chiral , and the 4 bogolyubov - de gennes classes for superconducting systems .",
    "a second reason is the emergence of topological structures @xcite in which some states are immune to anderson localization , at least for weak disorder .",
    "they occur via spectral gaps which support protected states ( e.g. in @xmath15 , conductance quantization in the presence of @xmath11 for the quantum hall effect and in the presence of soc for the quantum spin hall effect ) . for example , off - diagonal disorder with random hopping belongs to one of the 3 chiral classes and an even - odd effect was observed at zero energy for @xmath1 coupled chains , with a diverging density of states @xmath16 and a localization length that depends on the parity of @xmath1.@xcite a final reason for the subject being active today is that wave phenomena in disordered media can also be investigated for electromagnetic waves in complex structures , such as waveguide arrays which resemble a finite lattice .",
    "a wealth of recent experimental results @xcite combine disorder with non - linearity , and it is possible to test various theories ( e.g. of topological effects , the critical exponents at the anderson transition , etc . ) , including regimes that are difficult to access in disordered electronic systems .     the quasi-1d system of @xmath1 disordered chains , with on - site disorder of strength @xmath9 , longitudinal hopping @xmath4 ( black solid lines ) and inter - chain hopping @xmath2 ( blue dashed lines ) . ]",

    "the present work focuses on an assembly of @xmath1 coupled @xmath0 chains ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : sketch ] ) , which is a quasi-@xmath0 disordered system of increasing width ( @xmath1 is the number of its rows ) , that is expected to tend to a @xmath15 lattice as @xmath1 increases .",
    "the crossover from @xmath0 to @xmath15 is studied in the presence of diagonal disorder ( @xmath9 ) and as a function of the inter - chain coupling of strength @xmath2 ( the longitudinal hopping is @xmath4 ) .",
    "our main result , from a study for a wide range of values of the ratio @xmath18 and various @xmath1 , is an unexpected @xmath2-dependence for special @xmath1 s , where localization for the quasi-@xmath0 system remains weak in the strong - coupling limit @xmath5 ( even weaker than at @xmath3 ) , and rather insensitive to @xmath2 . for certain @xmath1 s anderson localization",
    "is more pronounced as @xmath2 increases and not for other @xmath1 s where there is  immunity \" to strong localization .",
    "this  immunity \" occurs when @xmath1 is odd for open lateral boundary conditions ( bc ) and when @xmath1 is a multiple of four for periodic lateral bc .",

    "a key to our understanding is the evolution of the energy - dependence of @xmath37 with increasing @xmath2 . at small @xmath2",
    "all studied systems show similar behavior .",
    "the lyapunov exponents are small ( dark color ) when the energy @xmath138 lies inside the one - dimensional band @xmath139 $ ] given by the longitudinal hopping @xmath4 .",

    "no electronic states are available , the propagation is evanescent and characterized by large lyapunov exponents ( bright color ) that increase with increasing @xmath142 .    in a clean system ( @xmath143 )",
    "the hamiltonian is separable in a longitudinal and a transverse part with the available total energies being sums of the longitudinal one - dimensional band energy and the transverse energy .",
    "the inter - chain coupling @xmath2 leads to a discrete spectrum of @xmath1 transverse energies with spacings @xmath144 between them that become wider with increasing @xmath2 .",
    "one can represent the system of @xmath1 coupled chains in the basis of the eigenstates of the clean transverse slices ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : perturbation ] ) and gets @xmath1 uncoupled channels with energy offsets given by the discrete transverse energies .",
    "this scenario is qualitatively robust against not too strong disorder , when the transverse mean free path remains much larger than the width @xmath1 of the quasi-1d strip . in the strong coupling limit one has @xmath145 , and this condition",
    "is always fulfilled , at least close to the center of the 1d band , and the basis of the transverse channels is the appropriate one for discussing and understanding the properties of the quasi-@xmath0 strip .",
    "moreover , the effective disorder strength of the channels is given by averages of the on - site energies as discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : perturbation ] . at finite @xmath2 ,",
    "the disorder breaks the separability of the clean system and couples the @xmath1 channels .",
    "while this coupling can be neglected when the channel energies are very far from each other , it plays a role at moderate values of @xmath2 when the bands corresponding to neighboring channels overlap , and also in the case of periodic bc where two degenerate channels exist independent of @xmath2 .",
    "the spacing of the transverse energies increases beyond the width of the longitudinal band ( roughly , this happens when @xmath146 ) and the spectrum splits in @xmath1 subbands that are separated by gaps whose width increases linearly with increasing @xmath2 . for periodic bc ,",
    "the number of gaps ( @xmath60 gaps ) is reduced with respect to the case of open bc since some of the transverse states are doubly degenerate . for energies situated in one of the subbands ,",
    "the smallest lyapunov exponent is small , similar to the @xmath0 case .",
    "in contrast , the gaps of the spectrum are characterized by very large lyapunov exponents , very much like for the energies outside the @xmath0 spectrum at small @xmath2 .    in order to understand the zero - energy behavior at strong coupling",
    ", the crucial question is whether @xmath34 lies in a subband or in a gap .",
    "the only cases where @xmath34 is inside a subband for all values of the coupling strength @xmath2 are the ones in which the clean transverse problem has a zero eigenenergy . as discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : perturbation ] , this is the case with odd @xmath1 at open bc and @xmath1 a multiple of four for periodic bc .",
    "examples for open bc ( @xmath32 and @xmath147 ) are displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : gamma_t_e ] ( a ) , and for periodic bc ( @xmath35 and @xmath148 ) in fig .",
    "[ fig : gamma_t_e ] ( b ) . in all other cases",
    "shown , all of the subbands increase or decrease in energy proportional to @xmath2 , and tend to @xmath112 in the strong coupling limit such that @xmath34 lies in a gap of the spectrum . since the size of the energy gap increases with @xmath2 , the large values of @xmath55 observed in these cases further increase with increasing @xmath2 ( see the maxima of the @xmath1-dependent oscillations in fig .",
    "[ fig : gamma_n ] ) .",

    "[ fig : gamma_n ] ( a ) and the period - of - four oscillations in fig .",
    "[ fig : gamma_n ] ( b ) are related to @xmath1-dependent oscillations between finite and vanishing density of states at @xmath34 .",

    "while these @xmath15 systems exhibit long range order , for even @xmath1 only short - range magnetic order occurs , accompanied by a finite energy gap to magnetic excitations .",
    "@xcite also , coupled @xmath150-wave superconducting quantum wires with open bc and half filling have been found to exhibit a parity effect .",
    "the density of states at @xmath34 is found to be vanishing for even @xmath1 and finite if @xmath1 is odd .",
    "@xcite we could also mention carbon nanotubes which depending on geometry are armchair with an @xmath34 mode ( metallic ) or zigzag without the @xmath34 mode ( semiconducting).@xcite    in fig .",
    "[ fig : gamma_t_e ] the subband edges are visible at moderate inter - chain coupling @xmath151 in the form of lines with enhanced @xmath55 , even though the subbands are overlapping .",
    "in this situation , the system corresponds to coupled effective chains ( one for each subband ) , one of them being close to the band edge where localization is stronger .",
    "this is reminiscent of the case of a two - leg ladder composed of two coupled chains having different localization length studied in ref .  , where a similar enhancement of the localization strength was found for energies close to the band edge of the strongly localized chain .",
    "the crossings of the band edges as a function of @xmath2 with @xmath34 ( a horizontal line in fig .",

    "we find no smooth crossover from @xmath0 to @xmath15 as a function of @xmath1 , but parity - dependent anderson localization in the presence of disorder @xmath9 and strong inter - chain coupling @xmath2 .",

    "the weaker anderson localization for large @xmath2 for some @xmath1 s and the gaps in the spectrum which lead to stronger localization for other @xmath1 s are quantitatively explained via a perturbative treatment in the strong inter - chain coupling limit @xmath152 , where the system can be mapped onto an effective model of one ( two ) weakly disordered chain(s ) arising from the one ( two ) zero - energy states in the spectrum of clean transverse slices with open ( periodic ) bc .",

    "@xcite in these works light propagates along the waveguides in @xmath154-direction and anderson localization in the transverse @xmath155@xmath156 plane is studied experimentally and theoretically by investigating the spreading of a local excitation to neighboring waveguides .",
