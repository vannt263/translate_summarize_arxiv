    "diffraction is centuries - old understanding of the single - beam - in multi - beam - out phenomenon in optics , acoustics , quantum mechanics , and all wave equation governed scattering processes , when the middle media has some property periodically varying in space .",
    "naturally we should know that as a simple case transmission of the electron through a sinusoidal - height quantum potential barrier or sinusoidal - depth well demonstrates diffraction effect .",
    "although in vast numerical treatments such as the plane - wave expansion method for metamaterials , this problem is just a building block within , we think it is important to particularly treat the quantum grating effect by developing a general scattering method and provide the detailed physical picture _ ab initio _ from the schrdinger equation , which to our knowledge is not covered in literature .",
    "also , the sinusoidal - height quantum potential barrier itself can be the model of a real material and a real transport device based on it .",
    "the recent widely - focused material , helimagnet ( hm ) , lends a very appropriate platform .    the hm is a kind of magnetic state@xcite with its spin spiraling in two or three dimensions characterized by a single spiral wavevector @xmath4 , which is different from conventional spatially uniform ferromagnet and antiferromagnet . when a single electron passes through the hm structure , spin - dependent diffraction occurs .",
    "recently the transport properties of the hm - embedded devices are targeted from different view angles in literature .",
    "_ et al.__@xcite and us@xcite observed the spin - dependent diffraction effect in the transmission at the ferromagnet / hm interface and through the thin - layer hm junction , respectively .",
    "some functional devices were proposed based on the hm such as the persistent spin currents@xcite , spin - field - effect transistor@xcite , tunneling anisotropic magnetoresistance@xcite , and spin resonance@xcite .",
    "conductance characteristic of the hm spin configuration and spiral period was found in the fano resonance spectrum of a quasi - one - dimensional wg containing a thin conducting hm layer as a donor impurity@xcite .",
    "ac gate potential driven quantum pumping behavior was also investigated recently@xcite . although some works were done to investigate the hm - related transport properties , there lacks an overall description of the diffraction scenario .",
    "as far as a good transport approach can go , beyond the conductance , we also considered the diffraction governed shot noise properties . as a consequence of the quantization of charge and defined by quantum contribution in the current fluctuations , shot noise is useful to obtain information on a system which is not available through conductance measurements@xcite .",
    "two of the most significant shot noise experiments are carrier charge confirmations of the cooper pair@xcite and laughlin quasiparticle@xcite . in most cases , the properties of quantum correlation",
    "are reflected in the fano factor @xmath5 , which is defined by proportion of the real shot noise @xmath6 to poisson noise @xmath7 ( @xmath8 is the average current ) , the latter of which corresponds to single quasiparticle transmission without correlation .",
