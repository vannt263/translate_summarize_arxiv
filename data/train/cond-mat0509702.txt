    "an electric current passing through a semiconductor can induce spin polarization near lateral edges of the sample , with opposite sign at opposite edges .",
    "such an effect , commonly referred to as the _ spin hall effect _ , had been predicted more than 30 years ago  @xcite and was observed recently.@xcite this effect results from the coupling between spin and momentum of an itinerant electron .",
    "two specific mechanisms have been considered for the spin - hall effect . the `` extrinsic '' mechanism couples spin to momentum during events of impurity scattering in the mott skew scattering channel  @xcite . as a result ,",
    "scattered electrons of different spin polarizations propagate towards opposite boundaries of the system . as opposed to the extrinsic , the `` intrinsic '' effect originates from a spin - split band structure  @xcite rather than from impurity scattering .",
    "experiments have been performed on both electron - doped  @xcite and hole - doped  @xcite gaas - based semiconductor structures of different dimensionalities . a spin hall effect in three - dimensional @xmath5-doped gaas films @xcite has been explained in terms of extrinsic skew and side - jump impurity scattering  @xcite while the intrinsic mechanism was estimated  @xcite to yield spin accumulation smaller by an order of magnitude than actually observed in the experiment .",
    "the two - dimensional electron gas on a ( 110 ) surface of gaas , studied in [ ] , was also in the dirty limit , and the spin hall effect observed there was attributed to extrinsic effects . on the other hand , @xmath6-doped two - dimensional ( 2d ) samples used in the experiments of ref .",
    "[ ] were estimated to contain very few impurities and it was suggested that the observations reflect a spin - hall effect of the intrinsic type .    while experiments directly measure spin accumulation along the sample edges , theoretical contributions to the field of spin - hall effect",
    "are mostly concerned with a different quantity which is easier to calculate , namely , the spin current .",
    "the latter is conventionally defined as the expectation value of the operator @xmath7 , where @xmath8 and @xmath9 are , respectively , the operators of the carrier spin and velocity ( which is , in general , also spin - dependent ) , and the normalization constant @xmath10 has been chosen differently by different authors .",
    "( in the present paper , we define @xmath11 to have eigenvalues @xmath12 , and we choose @xmath13 , so that the spin current is equal to @xmath14 times the difference in the particle currents for carriers with opposite spins . ) apart from the normalization , the definition of spin current is largely a matter of convenience since it _ is not _",
    "rigorously related to spin polarization ( accumulation ) by a conservation law , as opposed to _",
    "e.g. _ the electric charge conservation , namely , @xmath15 .",
    "non - conservation of spin - current ( due to spin precession ) makes the problem of its conversion into polarization highly non - trivial .",
    "moreover , since spin current is even with respect to time inversion , it is not necessarily absent even in equilibrium @xcite . in the present paper we concentrate on the 2d electron and hole systems . in this case",
    "the components of spin current @xmath16 polarized along the direction ( @xmath17 ) perpendicular to the 2d plane appear due to non - equilibrium conditions only .",
    "the paper [ ] predicted a universal value for the intrinsic spin - hall current in a 2d electron gas , with spin - orbit coupling of the rashba form , which , using the normalization of the present paper is given by @xmath18 independent of the strength of spin - orbit interaction .",
    "( the prediction of ref .",
    "[ ] for _ three - dimensional _ hole systems , though dependent on the electron density , was also independent of the strength of so coupling ) .",
    "these results immediately posed a question of how impurities would affect the spin - hall conductivity .",
    "the derivation of formula ( [ sin ] ) neglected scattering , but also assumed a steady state .",
    "the latter , however , is impossible in an infinite system if momentum relaxation is absent .",
    "soon a number of papers appeared about the role of impurity scattering , which , initially , reached differing conclusions .",
    "some studies encountered decreasing of the magnitude of the effect with increasing scattering  @xcite , while others found a universal value ( [ sin ] ) even in the presence of scattering .",
    "however , it is now generally agreed that in the simplest model of a 2deg , with a spin - orbit coupling that is linear in the wavevector @xmath19 , the dc spin hall conductivity will vanish , even in the case of arbitrarily small impurity concentration .",
    "inoue et al.@xcite first reached this conclusion in the clean limit , @xmath20 , where the spin orbit splitting @xmath1 exceeds the transport scattering rate @xmath3 , while entertaining the possibility of a finite effect for finite values of @xmath21 .",
    "the present authors  @xcite developed a theory based on a quantum kinetic equation to describe spin - polarized transport in the two - dimensional electron systems for _ arbitrary _ ratio of spin - orbit splitting and scattering rate , as long as they are both small compared to the fermi energy ( @xmath22 ) .",
    "applying this theory to the spin - hall effect in a 2deg with ( @xmath23-linear ) rashba coupling and isotropic impurity scattering , we established the vanishing of spin hall conductivity for arbitrary value of the product @xmath21",
    ". however , the cancellation is complete only in the bulk . near the contacts which inject unpolarized electrons , spin - currents are non - zero and , hence , a spin - polarization normal to plane can accumulate near the corners of a sample .",
    "the models used in refs .",
    "[ ] and  [ ] assumed short - range impurity potentials , with isotropic scattering .",
    "the result of vanishing spin hall conductivity in a 2deg with rashba coupling was subsequently confirmed by several studies @xcite , and were shown to hold for arbitrary angular dependence of the impurity scattering .",
    "early numerical calculations @xcite seemed to contradict the theoretical work but later ones supported the vanishing of spin - hall current @xcite .",
    "results for a 2deg with rashba coupling can also be applied directly to a model for a 2deg on an ( 001 ) surface with pure @xmath23-linear dresselhaus coupling , as the two problems are related by a rotation in spin space .    as was pointed out by dimitrova@xcite , the vanishing of _ dc _ spin currents @xmath16 in an _ infinite _",
    "2d system with @xmath19-linear spin - orbit coupling has a simple explanation in terms of the following operator argument .",
    "consider a system with the spin - independent disorder and the `` rashba''-type spin - orbit coupling @xcite @xmath24 , where @xmath25 represents the set of three pauli spin matrices , and @xmath19 is the canonical momentum .",
    "the equation of motion for the operator of spin polarization yields ( @xmath26 ) : @xmath27/\\hbar=-4\\alpha m j^z_l/\\hbar^3 $ ] , where @xmath28 is the electron effective mass .",
    "it follows from this identity that a nonzero expectation value of the spin current @xmath29 would result in a time - dependent spin polarization along the corresponding direction @xmath30 , which is impossible in a steady state .",
    "this operator argument applies also to a model with a combination of rashba and @xmath19-linear dresselhaus coupling . in agreement with this argument",
    ", analytical calculations confirm the vanishing of weak - localization ( of the first order in @xmath31 corrections to the spin hall conductivity  @xcite .",
    "it should be emphasized that this vanishing of the spin hall conductivity is characteristic of the 2d electron system with so coupling _ linear _ in momentum .",
    "cubic dresselhaus terms in the spin - orbit hamiltonian , which are @xmath32 for a 2d electron system on a ( 001 ) surface , should result in a finite spin hall conductivity  @xcite . for a 2d _ hole _ system in an asymmetric confining well",
    ", the rashba effect gives rise to a spin orbit field @xmath33 whose direction winds three times around a circle in the x - y plane as @xmath19 moves once around the fermi circle .",
    "it turns out , in this case , that for short - range impurities there is no cancellation in the clean limit , and one then obtains the full value of the intrinsic spin hall effect , at least in a simplified model which neglects cubic anisotropy.@xcite curiously , in contrast to the 2deg , it is the vertex corrections that vanish in this case , analogous to the absence of the vertex corrections to the electrical conductivity for short - range impurities  @xcite .",
    "vertex corrections are also absent in an @xmath5-doped 3d system with dresselhaus interaction , @xmath34 , and short - range impurity scattering , in this case due to the cubic crystal symmetry . in the absence of vertex corrections ,",
    "the impurities lead to a smooth relaxational suppression of the spin - hall conductivity due to the broadening of the spectral function of carriers . in principle",
    ", one should obtain the full intrinsic value of the spin - hall conductivity in the clean limit , but 3d systems are always in the dirty limit , where the intrinsic spin hall conductivity is reduced by a factor @xmath35 . as mentioned above , the spin hall effect observed in 3d @xmath5-type gaas",
    "is most probably due to extrinsic scattering effects , omitted from the model discussed here.@xcite    it is natural to ask whether the absence of vertex corrections for the 2d hole system is special to the assumption of short range impurities , or whether it applies equally well to a model with arbitrary angular dependence of the impurity scattering . in the present paper ,",
    "we develop equations to calculate the spin hall conductivity for arbitrary form of the impurity potential , and for arbitrary form of the spin - orbit field @xmath33 in a 2d system .",
    "solution of these equations is simple in models which have an overall circular symmetry , and we obtain analytic results in the limit of small angle scattering , resulting from smooth disorder . this type of disorder is a good assumption for many 2d systems in which the impurity centers ( dopants ) reside relatively far from the heterostructure interface .",
    "the result of our analysis is that the spin - hall conductivity , in general , does depend on the form of the impurity scattering , and except for the case of isotropic scattering , depends also on the energy - dependence of the spin - orbit coupling and on the deviation from parabolicity of the energy dispersion for the carriers . in our circularly symmetric model ,",
    "the magnitude of the spin - orbit field @xmath33 is independent of the direction of @xmath19 , while its direction winds @xmath36 times around the unit circle in the @xmath37-@xmath38 plane , at a uniform rate , as @xmath19 moves around the fermi circle .",
    "( @xmath36 must be an odd integer . ) the energy - dependence of @xmath1 and deviations of the energy dispersion @xmath39 from a parabolic form near the fermi energy , are then characterized by two parameters @xmath40 and @xmath41 , defined in eq .",

    "ii , below , we define precisely the models we are considering and the relevant parameters . in section iii , the transport quantities are expressed in terms of the wigner distribution function , for which boltzmann - like equations of motion are presented in section iv . in section",

    "vi , we obtain explicit formulas , eqs .",
    "( [ c8 ] ) and ( [ c9 ] ) , for the two limiting cases of isotropic scattering and small angle scattering by the impurities .",
    "the relation of our results to previous theoretical results and to recent experiments is discussed in section vii .",
    "some details of the derivations are presented in appendix a , and an alternate derivation of the kinetic equations of motion , using green s function methods , is presented in appendix b.",
    "we consider a two - dimensional system of non - interacting electrons or holes , described by a one - body hamiltonian of the form : @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the potential due to impurities , and @xmath19 is the kinetic momentum operator . in the presence of a vector potential @xmath44 , we have @xmath45 , where @xmath46 . throughout this paper , @xmath47 is the charge of the carriers , and we set @xmath48 except where explicitly noted .",
    "we may include a uniform electric field @xmath49 by letting @xmath50 depend on time .    by time reversal symmetry , the spin - orbit field @xmath51 must satisfy @xmath52 . note that vectors such as @xmath19 and @xmath53 , which refer to spatial coordinates , have two cartesian components , while vectors in spin space , such as @xmath51 have three components .",
    "we have assumed for simplicity that @xmath39 , the energy dispersion in the absence of spin orbit coupling , is isotropic and a monotonic function of @xmath54 .",
    "the formulas derived below can be extended in a straightforward manner to more complicated band structures , but the formulas would then be much less transparent , and the resulting integral equations are more difficult to solve ,    as a further simplification , we shall later specialize to models where @xmath51 has a simple rotational symmetry ; i.e. , we assume @xmath55 where @xmath56 is a complex number , whose magnitude may vary with the magnitude of @xmath54 , but whose phase is independent of @xmath19 .",
    "this will allow us to obtain analytic solutions to the equations .",
    "the final results will , of course , depend crucially on the winding number @xmath36 .",
    "we shall see that results can also be affected by the energy dependence of @xmath1 and by deviations of the energy dispersion @xmath39 from a parabolic form near the fermi energy .",

    "the case @xmath62 arises in a circularly symmetric model of a 2d hole system , which ignores warping due to the tetragonal symmetry . in the limit of small hole doping ,",
    "the band structure is parabolic and @xmath63 ; hence @xmath64 and @xmath65 . at larger values of the doping , when the fermi - energy becomes comparable to the splitting between the light and heavy hole bands , the values of @xmath40",
    "is reduced , and the value of @xmath41 will be negative . at still higher doping ,",
    "both light and heavy hole bands become occupied , and the situation is more complicated .",
    "the hamiltonian ( [ b1 ] ) assumes that there is no direct spin - orbit coupling associated with the impurity potential or with applied electric field .",
    "for example , it omits terms of the form @xmath66 , which are generally present in systems with spin orbit coupling .",
    "this term leads to skew - scattering by the impurities , giving an extrinsic contribution to the spin hall conductivity .",
    "since there is no direct general relation between the coupling constant @xmath67 and the magnitude of the intrinsic spin - orbit splitting @xmath1 , it is at least logically consistent to consider a model with @xmath68 .",
    "moreover , the skew scattering cross - section is higher order in the impurity potential @xmath43 than the ordinary transport scattering cross - section , so it is normally dominated by places where the carrier enters a region of strong potential gradients , close to the impurity . in a remotely doped 2d hole system one might expect that the skew scattering contribution to the spin hall conductivity should be relatively small , at least if one can ignore scattering by residual impurities close to the 2d system .",
    "we concentrate on systems which are large compared to the mean free path .",
