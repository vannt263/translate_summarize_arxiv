    "the deformation of liquid - liquid interfaces by the optical radiation pressure has received increasing attention in the past few years as many practical applications of laser - induced surface deformation are now under development . among others",
    ", we can cite interfacial characteristics measurements such as viscosity @xcite or surface tension @xcite , as well as fluid membranes manipulation with optical tweezers @xcite .",
    "effects of the radiation pressure have been also recognized as an appealing non - intrusive tool for local manipulation of liquid or soft materials giving birth to many applications in biotechnologies @xcite .",
    "historically , the deformation of fluid - fluid interfaces resulting from the radiation pressure induced by an impinging focused laser beam was first identified in the early 70 s by ashkin and dziedzic @xcite .",
    "later , zhang @xmath0 chang @xcite illuminated a @xmath1 m radius water drop with a @xmath2  mj laser pulse and showed strong distortion of the droplet surface at its front and rear regions . at low pulse energy ,",
    "the droplet interface exhibited oscillations that damped out on time scales of tens of microseconds , whereas at high energy a disruption generating a jet of micro - droplets was observed at the rear part of the drop .",
    "the drop distortion was theoretically studied by lai et al .",
    "@xcite and later by brevik et al .",
    "@xcite . based on a linear wave theory adapted to low energy pulses ,",
    "their analysis predicted drop oscillations very similar to those observed in the experiments .",
    "however , drop deformations under higher energy pulses were not modelled as their linear model can no longer be used to describe the droplet shapes in the regime close to disruption .",
    "thus , current existing theoretical descriptions of optically induced flow and surface deformations are restricted to small amplitude deformations . however , recent experiments on very soft interfaces have evidenced several regimes , ranging from the so - called classical _ linear regime _ for small beam intensity , in which the height of the deformation linearly depends on the radiation to laplace pressure ratio referred to in the following as @xmath3 @xcite , to _ nonlinear regimes _ @xcite with a possible interface breakup for even larger beam intensities @xcite .  in these recent experiments ,",
    "a continuous ar@xmath4 laser wave ( wavelength in vacuum @xmath5  nm ) of waist @xmath6 to @xmath7 m was used to bend the interface between two liquid phases in coexistence close to their liquid - liquid critical point .",
    "two reasons motivated this choice . as the separated phases of these near - critical mixtures have very low surface tension ( @xmath8",
    "n / m ) , a laser beam of moderate power @xmath9  w becomes sufficient to induce large interface deformations of typical size @xmath10  @xmath11 m .",
    "moreover , near - criticality raises universality concepts demonstrating the generality of the purpose .",
    "as predicted from the photon momentum balance at the interface , in the linear regime the radiation pressure induces the same deformations for upward or downward laser propagation @xcite .",
    "however , in the nonlinear regime the invariance of the interface deformation with respect to the direction of propagation of the wave breaks down .",
    "stable nipple - like deformations were observed in the case of a propagation from the less refractive fluid ( marked as ( 1 ) ) to the more refractive one ( marked as ( 2 ) ) ( _ upward propagation _ ) @xcite , while in the other case where the laser wave propagates from the more refractive fluid to the less refractive one ( _ downward propagation _ ) , the interface becomes unstable , leading to the formation of a needle - like deformation emitting micro - droplets @xcite ( see fig .",

    "p= 124 , 248 and 372 @xmath13 from top to bottom ; the bottommost picture ( 405 @xmath13 ) shows the destabilization of the interface leading to the formation of a stationary jet similar to that illustrated in ( c ) . ]",
    "the aim of the present work is to investigate whether the differences in interface deformation with respect to the direction of propagation of the wave ( called hereafter _ invariance breakdown _ ) is numerically predictable and if the predicted interface shapes and heights agree with experiments .",
    "our paper is structured as follows . in section 2 ,",
    "we briefly describe the experimental setup , sample properties , and the physical model for laser - induced interface deformations .",
    "this model assumes an axisymmetric stokes flow in each liquid and a boundary condition at the interface describing the competition between viscosity , optical radiation pressure , capillarity and gravity effects .",
    "a brief description of the boundary integral element method ( biem ) is presented in section 3 , emphasizing the advantages of its application to interfacial flows . in section 4",
    ", comparisons between numerical and experimental results are shown and discussed for both the linear / nonlinear regimes of deformation and both directions of propagation , illustrating by the way the efficiency of our approach to investigate the subtle coupling between the effects of light and flow .",
    "exhaustive experimental details on the configuration and protocol used here were reported earlier @xcite .      in figure 2",
    "we have represented a picture of a typical liquid - liquid interface deformation induced by a laser beam propagating upward , together with the notations used throughout this work .",
    "cylindrical coordinates ( @xmath14 with their origin @xmath15 located at the intersection of the beam axis with the initial flat interface are chosen for this study and are shown in fig .",
    "a point @xmath16 is thus marked by the space coordinates @xmath17 .    ;",

    "incidence and transmission angles of light are respectively denoted by @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "the two - phase liquid sample is enclosed in a fused - quartz cell of optical path length @xmath22  mm .",
    "the bending of the liquid - liquid meniscus is driven by a linearly polarized continuous @xmath23 laser ( wavelength in vacuum @xmath5  nm ) in the tem@xmath24 gaussian mode .",
    "the beam is weakly focused on the interface by a @xmath25 microscope objective to ensure a cylindrical distribution of the intensity near the meniscus .",
    "thus , in the vicinity of the liquid - liquid interface , the laser beam intensity @xmath26 has the following distribution : @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the laser beam power .",
    "the beam waist @xmath29 can be adjusted from 3 to @xmath7 m .",
    "depending on the setup configuration , the laser beam propagates vertically either upward from fluid @xmath30 to fluid @xmath31 or downward from fluid @xmath31 to fluid @xmath30 .",
    "the investigated fluid - fluid interface is obtained according to the following procedure . using a quaternary liquid mixture made of toluene , sodium dodecyl sulfate , n - butanol and water",
    ", we prepare a water - in - oil micellar phase of microemulsion whose composition is such that at room temperature it is close to a critical consolute line .",
    "close to the liquid - liquid critical temperature , @xmath32  k , the critical thermodynamic behavior of the mixture belongs to the universality class ( d=3 n=1 ) of the ising model @xcite . for a temperature @xmath33",
    "it separates in two micellar phases of different concentrations @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "the use of a near - critical two - phase fluid is motivated by the fact that significant interface deformations by electromagnetic radiation , without nonlinear propagation effects @xcite or disturbing thermal coupling , require weak interfacial tension and buoyancy . with our fluids ,",
    "both effects are fulfilled since they vanish when the critical point is neared .",
    "moreover , the interfacial tension @xmath36 of phase - separated near - critical supra molecular fluids is intrinsically smaller than that of near - critical pure fluids , thus enhancing even more interface deformations .",
    "the mixture is thermally controlled at a temperature @xmath37 above @xmath38 .",
    "since the density ( index of refraction ) of water is larger ( smaller ) than that of toluene , the micellar phase of largest concentration @xmath34 , density @xmath39 and smallest refractive index @xmath40 is located below that of lower micellar concentration @xmath35 , density @xmath41 and of refractive index @xmath42 .",
    "given the temperature range investigated in the reported experiments @xmath43  to  @xmath44  k , thermophysical properties of the two - phase sample can be satisfactorily evaluated using usual asymptotic scaling laws of near - critical phenomena . for interfacial tension : @xmath45 with @xmath46  n / m and @xmath47 . assuming that ( i ) a scaling law accurately describes the variations of @xmath48 in the investigated broad temperature domain @xmath49 and that ( ii ) the coexistence curve is symmetric versus the critical concentration @xmath50 , the micellar concentration in each phase can be estimated by : @xmath51 with @xmath52 and : @xmath53 with @xmath54 .",
    "the value of the critical amplitude @xmath55 , can be estimated theoretically for this system with the main assumption that our mixture is binary @xmath56 @xcite .",
    "@xmath57 being a universal ratio in microemulsions @xcite .",
    "as micellar phases are in fact quaternary components fluids , their phase diagram presents some asymmetry in @xmath58 leading either to over or underestimate the critical amplitude @xmath55 depending on which side of the coexistence curve is chosen .",
    "the theoretical value of @xmath55 leads to an overestimation of the optical index contrast @xmath59 .",
    "consequently a modified value for @xmath55 , @xmath60 , has been adopted in this study , based on a quantitative comparison between numerical and experimental interface steady hump heights in the linear regime of deformations .",
    "this modified value gives acceptable predictions for the concentrations @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "in fact , @xmath61 should be understood as a free parameter in the estimation of phases properties .",
    "the density of each phase @xmath62 , @xmath63 can be written as a function of @xmath64 : @xmath65 where @xmath66  kg.m@xmath67 and @xmath68  kg.m@xmath67 are the densities of the micelles and continuous phases respectively . at @xmath69",
    "the estimated density contrast is @xmath70 .",
    "as the average distance between two micelles is small compared to the wavelength of the laser wave , the mixture can be regarded as homogeneous from the electromagnetic point of view .",
    "thus , the mean - field model for the relative dielectric permittivity @xmath71 of the mixture predicts @xcite : @xmath72 this relation is used to estimate @xmath73 taking into account the fact that : @xmath74 along with @xmath75 and @xmath76 , @xmath77 and @xmath78 being the relative permittivity of the micelles and continuous phases respectively .    at @xmath69 ,",
    "the optical indices are @xmath79 and @xmath80 .",
    "in addition , since concentrations are weak , we use einstein s relation to estimate the dynamic viscosity @xmath81 of each phase : @xmath82 with @xmath83  pa.s .",
    "nevertheless , these values could be shifted by possible laser heating of the fluids . in order to estimate the resulting change in the physical properties such as interfacial tension @xmath36 or viscosity @xmath81 due to temperature increase",
    ", we consider the steady diffusion equation in cylindrical coordinate with the absorbed laser intensity as a source term : @xmath84 we assume stationary conditions since the thermal diffusion time scale is much smaller than the viscous one .",

    "is given by : @xmath98 + \\frac{\\epsilon_i-1}{c^2}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}({\\bf e_i } \\times { \\bf h_i } ) .",

    "+ the first term , whose jump across the liquid interface results in the usually called optical radiation pressure , is due to the change in photon momentum from one fluid to the other .",
    "this momentum change is due to the discontinuity of permittivities across the interface .",
    "as both fluids are assumed to be homogeneous , the optical radiation term cancels within each phase and only acts on the interface .",
    "the second term , referred to as the electrostrictive force , also undergoes a jump at the interface due to the difference in both the optical properties and the electric fields * e * between the two liquids in contact .",
    "however , this force also acts as a bulk force within each phase because of the radial dependence of the electric field * e*. we will demonstrate , in adequation with previous theoretical investigations @xcite , that the electrostriction does not contribute to the motion and shape of the interface as its bulk contribution is compensated by its surface one .",
    "the quantity @xmath101 , which depends on the density of each phase through a nonlinear relationship can be deduced from equations ( [ densite composite ] ) and ( [ permittivite composite ] ) .    finally ,",
    "in equation ( [ fem ] ) , the third term is called the abraham term , and is undetectable at optical frequencies @xcite and thus cancels out for our purpose .    in the following ,",
    "we denote @xmath102 the quadratic value of the electric field averaged over an optical period .",
    "assuming incompressible fluids ( @xmath62 is homogeneous throughout each phase @xmath103 , @xmath63 ) , we can include contributions of the bulk forces ( gravity and electrostriction ) in the pressure field and define a pseudo - pressure @xmath104 given by : @xmath105 where @xmath106 , @xmath63 , is the pressure in each phase and @xmath107  m.s@xmath108 is the acceleration of gravity .",

    "( [ saut ] ) in terms of pseudo - pressures leads to : @xmath114.{\\bf n}=\\gamma\\kappa(r ) .",
    "\\label{sautbis}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] therefore , the bulk contribution of the electrostriction is balanced by its surface contribution and the interface shape does not depend on electrostriction .",
    "+ consequently , the equilibrium equation of the interface can be written as : @xmath115 at final equilibrium , only normal stress act on the interface , consequently there is no flow within the phases and this equilibrium in each phase is characterized by : + @xmath116 in the experiments , the laser wave was linearly polarized so that the electric field @xmath117 was perpendicular to the plane of observation of azimuthal coordinate @xmath118 . therefore @xmath119 is continuous across the interface in this plane .",
    "conversely , in the plane defined by @xmath120 , the electric field is within the plane of propagation ( parallel polarization ) and thus is no longer continuous across the interface .",
    "however , as shown in @xcite , the first term of the electromagnetic force , which is responsible for the optical radiation pressure acting on the interface , is quasi - independent of beam polarization as long as refractive indices are sufficiently close to each others ( @xmath121 ) .",
    "we can then assume as in a previous investigation @xcite a circular polarization of the electric field @xmath119 .",
    "therefore , using the definition of the irradiance @xmath122 in the case of a beam propagating upward , the radiation pressure can be written as : @xmath123 while in the case of a downward beam propagation it is given by : @xmath124 here , @xmath125 and @xmath126 are the fresnel transmission coefficients in energy . in the case of a circular polarization , they are expressed as : @xmath127 as a final remark , note that the expression of the electromagnetic pressure in the case of a downward propagation is valid until achieving the condition of total reflection @xmath20<@xmath128 .",
    "what occurs when light is totally reflected by a highly deformed interface is out of the scope of the present numerical study .",
    "we consider a cylindrical domain of radius @xmath129 and height @xmath130 as depicted in figure 3 .",
    "we choose to treat all the governing equations in a dimensionless form by using the laser waist @xmath29 as the characteristic length scale and the viscous relaxation velocity @xmath131 as the reference velocity associated to the characteristic timescale @xmath132 .",
    "the reference pressure is taken as @xmath133  ,  @xmath63 .",
    "since the weak absorption of light at laser frequency ensures negligible thermal effects , we consider all liquid properties ( @xmath36 , @xmath62 , @xmath81 , @xmath63 ) constant in adequation with our estimation of the change in interfacial tension and viscosity due to a local increase in temperature .",
    "moreover , given the value of the reynolds number of the flow @xmath134 , inertia is negligible compared to viscous forces , allowing a quasi - steady creeping flow assumption .",
    "thus , flow in each liquid is governed by stokes and mass conservation equations respectively given by : @xmath135 @xmath136 is the dimensionless velocity in fluid i and @xmath104 is the dimensionless value of the pseudo - pressure defined in eq.([pression ] ) .",

    "instability of the interface is numerically predicted to occur when the wave undergoes total reflection and is _ a priori _ focused toward the hump tip , i.e. when @xmath20 reaches @xmath199 at the inflection point of the interface . as a matter of fact , since total reflection and focusing of the incident wave by the interface is assumed to be responsible for the jetting instability @xcite , we assume that beyond @xmath171 the interface will actually become unstable .",
    "moreover , beyond @xmath171 the physical model used in the numerical model fails , in particular due to eq .",
    "( [ raddown ] ) because the numerical simulation of the jet formation and stability should include the description of the complex interplay between wave propagation and interface deformation acting as a wave guide , which is beyond the scope of the present investigation .",
    "+ still , the discrepancy between the values of @xmath171 at which total reflection occurs along the interface ( @xmath200 in fig .",
    "4 ) and @xmath170 just beyond which the bell - shaped interface actually loses its stability ( @xmath201 in fig .",
    "4 ) calls for a study of the interface shape .         and @xmath168 ( @xmath169 ) .",
    "]    figure 5b shows that there is also a noticeable discrepancy between the experimental and numerically predicted interface shapes for the case of the downward propagation in the nonlinear regime .",
    "more precisely , the experimental hump is wider than the numerically predicted one , and the experimental slope of the interface shape is smaller than the numerically predicted one all along the interface , even when the experimental hump height is well predicted numerically , as it is the case for @xmath202 and shown in fig .",
    "this observation can explain the discrepancy observed on @xmath174 obtained experimentally and predicted numerically . as a matter of fact , since the actual slope of the interface shape is all along the interface smaller than numerically predicted , the actual incidence angle @xmath20 is also smaller than that numerically predicted .",
    "consequently , the total reflection of the wave by the interface reaching a slope equal to @xmath199 and the associated jetting instability are expected to experimentally occur at a value of @xmath3 larger than that numerically predicted .",
    "nevertheless , the reason for this discrepancy between the actual interface shape and its numerical prediction in the case of a downward propagation is still unexplained . in ref .",
    "@xcite several possible causes were discussed and discarded . among them",
    "are the effect of thermocapillary flows due to light absorption , the role of optical nonlinearities , and the additional electromagnetic pressure applied on the hump tip due to the partial reflection of light by the interface below the instability threshold",
    ". a more probable cause may be the viscous stress applied on the interface by the flow induced by the scattering of light as a result of refractive index inhomogeneities occurring in the bulk of each phase @xcite . indeed , the resulting scattering force is known ( i ) to be oriented in the direction of propagation and ( ii ) of radial extension much larger than the beam diameter .",
    "however , the exact effect of such a flow on finite size humps , in particular the interplay between viscous effects on the deformed interface and the feed back of the hump shape on the flow field in its vicinity , remains misunderstood and calls for further study .",
    "previous work has recently shown that in the linear regime the interface dynamics is accurately described by a linear theory of overdamped interfacial circular waves @xcite , and that the interface dynamics is independent of the direction of propagation .",
    "+ however , in the nonlinear regime , the interface dynamics actually depends on the wave propagation . +     , @xmath203 ( @xmath169 ) and @xmath202 .",
    "time t is dimensional .",
    "the inset shows the variation of the radiation pressure normalized by its value at normal incidence , versus the incidence angle for both propagations .",
    "the dashed line ( inset ) shows the total reflection threshold @xmath199 . ]    in fig .",
    "6 , the time evolution of the hump height @xmath204 is plotted for both the upward ( dot - dashed line ) and downward propagations ( solid line ) for @xmath202 , a value belonging to the nonlinear regime .",
    "we note that ( i ) both curves coincide during the first @xmath205  ms of the dynamics and eventually separates , ( ii ) the transient is significantly shorter in the case of upward propagation and the equilibrium state is reached much faster . the first observation can be explained by noting that for @xmath206  ms both interface deformations are small enough to be described by a linear theory which is precisely independent of the beam propagation .",
    "the second observation can be qualitatively explained by considering the increase of the electromagnetic pressure with the incidence angle @xmath20 in the case of downward propagation ( as shown in the inset of fig .",
    "6 ) . as @xmath20 increases along the interface the associated overpressure applying on the growing hump increases its final height and thus increases the delay for the hump to reach equilibrium .",
    "on the contrary , the fact that the electromagnetic pressure decreases when @xmath20 increases in the case of an upward propagation leads to the opposite conclusion .",
    "consequently , the analysis of the dynamics shows that , beyond the regime of linear deformations , our numerical approach becomes predictive for the complex nonlinear regime , thus calling for new experimental investigation and providing indications on how to perform these experiments .",
    "a boundary integral element method has been used to simulate the deformation of a fluid - fluid interface induced by a focused laser beam . since interface deformations with azimuthal invariance",
    "were expected , an axisymmetric model has been developed .",
    "comparisons between numerical predictions and experimental data showed two main results .",
    "first , our model can satisfactorily reproduce the variations of interface equilibrium hump height @xmath172 with respect to the ratio of electromagnetic to capillary pressure @xmath3 in regimes of small as well as of large deformations . in the case of an upward propagation",
    ", nipple - like interface shapes were not reproduced , while in the case of a downward propagation , instability threshold was overestimated probably because actual interface shapes are wider than numerically predicted .",
    "this could be due to bulk steady flows induced by light scattering as a result of liquid index inhomogeneitiy which deserves further experimental characterization before numerical implementation .",
    "a study of the dynamics of the interface for both directions of propagation was also performed showing a shorter characteristic time for the interface reaching its steady state in the case of an upward propagation .",
    "future work should take into account the total reflection and focusing of light by the deformed interface in order to potentially predict hydrodynamic instability leading to jet formation and micro - droplet emission at the tip .",
    "another interesting investigation would be to study the effect of light scattering induced flow @xcite on jetting instability .",
    "our first results are thus very encouraging since they illustrate the accuracy of our numerical model to describe and predict intriguing properties of nonlinear behaviors of the coupling between light and liquid interfaces , a subject of increasing interest due to its wide range of applications in soft matter physics on the one hand and scarce theoretical results on the other hand .",
