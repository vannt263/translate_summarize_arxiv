    "<S> we report on our first results from a mid - infrared spectroscopic study of ism features in a sample of deeply obscured ulirg nuclei using the infrared spectrograph ( irs ) on the spitzer space telescope . </S>",
    "<S> the spectra are extremely rich and complex , revealing absorption features of both amorphous and crystalline silicates , aliphatic hydrocarbons , water ice and gas phase bands of hot co and warm c@xmath0h@xmath0 , hcn and co@xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> pah emission bands were found to be generally weak and in some cases absent . </S>",
    "<S> the features are probing a dense and warm environment in which crystalline silicates and water ice are able to survive but volatile ices , commonly detected in galactic dense molecular clouds , can not . </S>",
    "<S> if powered largely by star formation , the stellar density and conditions of the gas and dust have to be extreme not to give rise to the commonly detected emission features associated with starburst . </S>"
