    "@xmath25  , yields to the estimate @xmath162 where @xmath163 is the first hypergeometric function .",
    "we derive that in the diffusion dominated regime the average velocity is obtained as the product of the zeroth - order fick - jacobs result and the correction term @xmath163 including the corrugation of the tube structure . referring to the sutherland - einstein relation , cf .",
    "@xmath25  , if the average current @xmath164 ( or the effective diffusion coefficient @xmath165 ) is known in the zeroth order , the higher order corrections to both quantities can be obtained according to @xmath25  .",
    "we have to emphasize that considering only the first derivative of the boundary function @xmath166 results in an additional term proportional to @xmath167 .",
    "taking further the second derivative @xmath168 into accounts indicates that this second term is negligible compared to @xmath169 for arbitrarily value of @xmath31 .     in units of the maximum channel width @xmath32 .",
    "the latter is varied @xmath170 ( from top to bottom ) while the external bias is kept fixed @xmath171 ( corresponding to the diffusion dominated regime ) .",
    "the symbols correspond to the numerical obtained mobility ( triangles ) and the effective diffusion coefficient ( circles ) .",
    "the solid lines correspond to analytic higher order result , cf .",
    "@xmath25  .",
    "the zeroth order - fick - jacobs results given by @xmath25   collapse to a single curve hidden by the solid line for @xmath172 .",
    "in addition the numerical evaluation of @xmath25   is represented by the dash - dotted lines . ]    in @xmath5  [ fig : mobdeffperi_eps ] , we present the dependence of the @xmath111 ( triangles ) and @xmath112 ( circles ) on the slope parameter @xmath31 for @xmath171 .",
    "one observes that the numerical results for the effective diffusion coefficient @xmath173 and the mobility @xmath111 coincide for all values of @xmath31 , thus corroborating the sutherland - einstein relation .",
    "in addition , the fick - jacobs result , given by @xmath25  , the higher order result ( solid lines ) , see @xmath25  , and the numerical evaluation of the lifson - jackson formula using @xmath161 ( dash - dotted lines ) , cf . @xmath25  ,",

    "for the case of smoothly varying tube geometry , i.e. @xmath136 , all analytic expressions are in excellent agreement with the numerics , indicating the applicability of the fick - jacobs approach . in virtue of @xmath25  ,",
    "the geometric parameter is defined by @xmath174 and hence the maximal value of @xmath31 equals @xmath175 .",
    "consequently the influence of the higher expansion orders @xmath176 on the average velocity @xmath25   and on the mobility , respectively , becomes negligible if the maximum tube s width @xmath175 is small .    with increasing maximum width the difference between the fj - result @xmath25   and the numerics",
    "is growing .",
    "specifically , the fj - approximation overestimates the mobility @xmath177 and the effective diffusion coefficient @xmath178 .",
    "consequently the corrugation of the tube geometry needs to be included . the consideration of @xmath161 , cf .",
    "@xmath25   provides a good agreement for a wide range of @xmath31-values as long as the maximum width @xmath175 is on the scale to the period length of the tube , i.e. @xmath179 . upon further increasing the maximum width @xmath175 diminishes the range of applicability of the presented concept . in detail",
    "the expression @xmath25   drastically underestimate the numerical results due to the neglect of the higher derivatives of the boundary function @xmath113 . put differently , the higher derivatives of @xmath113 become significant for @xmath180 .",
    "in contrast , one notices that the result for the mobility and the diffusion coefficient , respectively , based on the higher order corrections to the stationary probability density @xmath25   is in very good agreement with the numerics . for tube geometries where the maximum width @xmath175 is on the scale to the period length ,",
    "i.e. @xmath179 , the correction estimate matches perfectly with the numerical results .",
    "further increase of the tube width results in a small deviation from the simulation results .",
    "in summary , we have considered the transport of point - sized brownian particles under the action of a constant and uniform force field through a @xmath1d tube .",
    "the cross - section , respectively , the radius of the tube varies periodically .",
    "we have presented a systematic treatment of particle transport by using a perturbation series expansion of the stationary probability density in terms of a smallness parameter which specifies the corrugation of the tube walls . in particular",
    ", it turns out that the leading order term of the series expansion is equivalent to the well - established _ fick - jacobs approach _ @xcite .",
    "the higher order corrections to the probability density become significant for extreme bending of the tube s side - walls .",
    "analytic results for each order of the perturbation series have been derived .",
    "similar to biased brownian motion in a @xmath1d planar channel all higher order corrections to the stationary probability density scale with the average particle current obtained from the fick - jacobs formalism .",
    "moreover , for the diffusion dominated regime , i.e. for small forcing @xmath125 , we calculate the correction to the mean particle velocity originated by the tube s corrugation using the series expansion for the stationary probability density . according to the sutherland - einstein relation ,",
    "the obtained relation is also valid for the effective diffusion coefficient . in addition , by using the higher order corrections we present an alternative derivation for the spatially dependent diffusion coefficient @xmath0 which substitutes the constant diffusion coefficient present in the common fick - jacobs equation based on similar assumptions as those suggested by kalinay and percus as well as by rubi and reguera .",
    "finally , we have applied our analytic results to a specific example , namely , the particle transport through a tube with sinusoidally varying radius @xmath3 .",
    "we corroborate our theoretical predictions for the mobility and the effective diffusion coefficient with precise numerical results of a finite element calculation of the stationary smoluchowski - equation .    in conclusion",
    ", the consideration of the higher order corrections leads to a substantial improvement of the fick - jacobs - approach , which corresponds to the zeroth order in our perturbation analysis , towards more winding boundaries of the tube .",
    "notably , we have shown that the common approach using the the spatially dependent diffusion coefficient @xmath0 fails for extreme corrugated tube geometries .",
