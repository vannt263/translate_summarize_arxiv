    "the casimir effect @xcite is now universally known as one of the most extensively studied manifestations of zero - point oscillations .",
    "it attracts considerable attention in quantum field theory , gravitation and cosmology , atomic physics and optics , condensed matter physics , and in applications to nanotechnology ( see monographs @xcite ) .",
    "the fundamental theory describing both the van der waals and casimir forces between two semispaces with planar boundaries was developed by lifshitz @xcite . at present",
    "the lifshitz theory is generalized for material bodies with curved boundary surfaces ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite ) . over a long period of years",
    "only a very limited experimental information about the casimir force was available .",
    "recently , however , a significant advance has been made in the experimental study of this phenomenon reflected in review @xcite . in principle , the theoretical and experimental progress taken together allows computation and measurement of casimir forces between bodies of complicated geometrical shape made of different materials . in order for such computation to be made , one should know the reflection amplitudes on the boundary surfaces at all matsubara frequencies . at first sight this should present no problems because the reflection amplitudes can be either measured directly or calculated using measured material properties , such as frequency - dependent dielectric permittivities . at this point , however , difficulties emerge unexpectedly which are connected with the role of relaxation properties of charge carriers in the casimir effect .    beginning in 2000 ,",
    "the influence of relaxation on the thermal casimir force was hotly debated .",
    "bostrm and sernelius @xcite have noticed that the substitution of the dielectric permittivity of the drude model with nonzero relaxation parameter into the lifshitz formula results in a decreasing magnitude of the casimir free energy and force as a function of temperature over a wide region of separations .",
    "this is in contradiction with the case of ideal metal plates or plate materials described by the nondissipative plasma model , where the magnitudes of the casimir free energy and force are monotonously increasing functions of the temperature @xcite . at large separations ( or in high temperature limit ) the magnitudes of the casimir free energy and force between metal plates calculated using the drude model are by a factor of 2 less then the same quantities calculated for ideal metals or metals described by the plasma model .",
    "it was also shown that for metals with perfect crystal lattices the lifshitz theory combined with the drude model violates the nernst heat theorem @xcite . for metals with impurities leading to a nonzero relaxation at zero temperature nernst s theorem",
    "was shown to be followed @xcite .",
    "this , however , does not solve the problem because perfect crystal metal is an idealized model of a truly equilibrium system with nondegenerate ground state for which the laws of thermodynamics must be satisfied .    a large thermal effect in the casimir force between metals at separations of a few hundred nanometers predicted by the lifshitz theory combined with the drude model",
    "was experimentally excluded @xcite by indirect dynamic measurements of the casimir pressure in the configuration of a sphere above a plate of a micromachined oscillator .",
    "later this experiment was repeated for two more times with increased precision .",
    "the exclusion of the thermal effect predicted by the drude model was confirmed at a 95% confidence level @xcite and at a 99.9% confidence level @xcite .",
    "the same measurement data were found to be consistent with the lifshitz theory combined with the plasma model .",
    "it is important to keep in mind that the comparison of experiment with theory in refs .",
    "@xcite was based on the use of an approximate method , the so - called _ proximity force approximation _ ( pfa )",
    "@xcite because at that time for sphere - plate configuration an exact theory was not available .",
    "at the moment there is a conceptual possibility to compute the thermal casimir force between a sphere and a plate made of real metals with no use of the pfa @xcite , but the region of experimental parameters is not yet achieved due to computational difficulties .    when it is considered that the drude model correctly describes the relaxation of conduction electrons at low frequencies , the contradiction with basic laws of thermodynamics and disagreement with the experimental data outlined above are puzzling .",
    "these problems were dramatized by the demonstration that the inclusion of dc conductivity of dielectric ( or dielectric - type semiconductor ) materials into the model of dielectric response in the lifshitz theory also results in a violation of the nernst theorem @xcite . from the experimental side , it was shown that the measurement data of the experiment on optical modulation of the casimir force between au sphere and si plate with light @xcite excludes the lifshitz theory taking into account the dc conductivity of dielectrics at a 95% confidence level .",
    "a similar result was obtained from the measurement of the casimir - polder force between the bose - einstein condensate of @xmath0rb atoms and sio@xmath1 plate @xcite . here , the lifshitz theory taking dc conductivity of sio@xmath1 into account was experimentally excluded at a 70% confidence level @xcite .",
    "it is pertinent to note that while the comparison of the optical modulation experiment with theory uses the pfa , the measurement results for the casimir - polder force were compared with the exact lifshitz formula for atom - wall interaction .",
    "one can summarize that experiments with metals , semiconductors and dielectrics exclude the influence of dissipation of conduction electrons on the casimir force ( the statement on the opposite in the introduction to ref .",
    "@xcite is a typo ) .",
    "the conflict between such a fundamental theory , as the lifshitz theory , thermodynamics and the experimental data of several experiments is a problem of great concern .",
    "because of this , a lot of attempts to resolve this problem has been undertaken .",
    "specifically , it was even suggested @xcite to modify the lifshitz theory by including into consideration screening effects and diffusion currents .",
    "it was noted , however , that the modifications proposed do not alleviate contradictions with thermodynamics and the experimental data ( discussion on this subject can be found in refs .",
    "@xcite ) . on the other hand ,",
    "it was suggested @xcite to modify the planck distribution law by taking into account `` saturation effects '' .",
    "there were also attempts to soften contradictions with thermodynamics by reformulating the problem @xcite and by finding additional statistical arguments in favor of the drude model @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , in addition to the usually used exponential screening , the so - called _ algebraic screening _ in atom - wall interaction was considered . as a result ,",
    "linear in temperature thermal correction to the casimir - polder force at short separations was predicted similar to that predicted by the drude model .",
    "note that the algebraic screening is connected with nonanalytic terms in the small wavenumber expansion of the dielectric permittivity .",
    "it was finally suggested @xcite that for the resolution of the problem some concepts of statistical physics related to the theoretical description of the interaction of classical and quantum fluctuating fields with matter might need a reconsideration .",
    "the prospects for a pure theoretical resolution of the above problems seem dim at the moment .",
    "in this situation any additional experimental evidence could be very useful . in this paper",
    "we analyze the possibility to measure thermal effects in the casimir force on the basis of already created and used experimental setups . we stress that in the experiments @xcite mentioned above the large thermal correction to the casimir force , as predicted by the drude model ,",
    "was excluded .",
    "however , these experiments were not of sufficient precision to measure the thermal effect for metals predicted by the plasma model or for dielectrics with dc conductivity omitted ( till the moment the thermal effect was measured in the casimir - polder force alone @xcite ) .",
    "keeping in mind that there is some confusion in the literature concerning the use of the pfa , we present two ( not equivalent ) formulations of the pfa and clarify which of them was really used in the comparison between experiment and theory .",
    "we especially analyze the calculation results for the thermal correction to the casimir force in sphere - plate configuration found using the pfa and explain when they are meaningful .",
    "the obtained conclusions are confirmed by the comparison with exact results for the thermal contribution to the casimir force between a sphere and a plate .",
    "we show that at the moment it is not possible to measure small thermal effects in the casimir force ( or its gradient ) in sphere - plate geometry , as predicted by the lifshitz formula combined with the plasma model .",
    "we also discuss the configuration of two parallel plates in both dynamic and static regimes . according to our results , small thermal corrections to the gradient of the casimir pressure in the dynamic regime",
    "is suppressed .",
    "the only way to measure small thermal effects in the casimir pressure is suggested by the configuration of two parallel plates in the static regime .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii two different formulations of the pfa are considered and applied to the casimir force in sphere - plate configuration .",
    "section  iii discusses the same subject with respect to the gradient of the casimir force between a sphere and a plate . in sec .",
    "iv the relationship between the pfa and the exact results is presented for a sphere and a plate made of ideal metal .",
    "the applicability of the pfa to describe thermal corrections to the casimir force between a sphere and a plate made of real metals and the possibility to measure the thermal effect are considered in sec .",
    "v. in sec .",
    "vi we show that the static casimir configuration of two parallel plates is preferential for the observation of a small thermal effect in the casimir pressure .",
    "section  vii contains our conclusions and discussion .",
    "different authors vary somewhat in the meaning of the term `` pfa '' .",
    "in fact the term `` proximity force theorem '' ( later changed for pfa ) was introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite where the so - called _ derjaguin method _",
    "@xcite was applied in order to calculate the force acting between curved surfaces by using the known force per unit area of plane parallel plates . in the derjaguin method ,",

    "the absence of power - type thermal corrections in the gradient of the casimir pressure for ideal metals explains why the thermal effect in this case is so small .    at low temperatures , the analytical representation for the gradient of the casimir pressure",
    "can be obtained for real metals as well .",
    "thus , for metals described by the generalized plasma - like model at separations above @xmath244 m considered here the influence of interband transitions can be neglected .",
    "then the thermal correction in the gradient of the casimir pressure is obtained as the negative second derivative of eq .",
    "( [ eq46 ] ) leading to @xmath245 , \\label{eq54}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the exponentially small terms are omitted . here",
    ", the leading thermal correction is of power - type , but it contains the first and third power of small parameters . equation ( [ eq54 ] ) provides a better than 1% approximation for the exactly computed @xmath246 over the range of separations below @xmath247 m .",
    "similar low - temperature results for metals described by the drude model can be obtained by calculating the negative second derivative of eq .",
    "( [ eq47 ] ) @xmath248 this approximate expression reproduces the values of @xmath249 with an error less than 1% at separations below @xmath159 m .    to conclude this section , for the configuration of two parallel plates in the dynamic regime the relative thermal correction to the gradient of the casimir pressure computed using the plasma model approach achieves 20% only at @xmath91 m ( see fig .",
    "the same relative size of the thermal correction computed using the plasma model but to the casimir pressure is achieved at a shorter separation @xmath250 m [ see the solid line 2 fig .",
    "thus , the static experiment with two parallel plates of sufficiently large area might be preferable for the registration of small thermal corrections at relatively large separations . although at the same separation the relative thermal correction to the casimir force in a sphere - plate configuration is larger [ 43% in accordance with the solid line 1 in fig .",
    "8(a ) at @xmath250 m ] , small values of forces for spheres of relatively small radii make its measurement impossible .",
    "as was discussed above , the use of centimeter - size spheres meets difficulties due to unavoidable deviations from sphericity . in this respect",
    "the increase of plate area and , thus , the increase of the casimir force , may make possible to decrease the experimental error at separations of a few micrometers to about 10% , i.e. , below the characteristic size of small thermal effect predicted by the plasma model approach .",
    "in the foregoing we have analyzed the possibility to measure thermal effects in the casimir force between metals in the configurations of a sphere above a plate and two parallel plates . in connection with the sphere - plate configuration ,",
    "a detailed study of the reliability of the pfa to describe the thermal casimir force was performed .",
    "we have considered the two formulations of the pfa , the most general , derjaguin , formulation @xcite and the simplified formulation of ref .",
    "@xcite which was used for the comparison of many experiments on the measuring of the casimir force with theory .",
    "we show in sec .",
    "ii that for a large sphere , i.e. , under the condition @xmath41 , the magnitude of the relative difference between thermal casimir forces @xmath44 computed for real metals by using the two formulations of the pfa is less than @xmath42 .",
    "this holds regardless of what approach to the description of charge carriers ( drude or plasma model ) is employed .",
    "a similar result is obtained in sec .",
    "iii for the gradient of the thermal casimir force in sphere - plate configuration , @xmath181 . here",
    "again the relative difference computed using the two formulations is less than @xmath42 .",
    "the obtained results are compared with the experimental data of ref .",
    "@xcite demonstrating that for large spheres of different radii at @xmath57k the relative differences of the measured @xmath251 , @xmath181 and those computed using the simplified formulation of the pfa are also less than @xmath42 . from this",
    "we can conclude that the simplified formulation of the pfa is a good approximation for the calculation of thermal casimir forces in sphere - plate configuration for spheres of large radii .    in sec .",
    "iv special attention is paid to the case of an ideal metal sphere above an ideal metal plate . in this case a simple analytic expression for the difference between the two formulations of the pfa is obtained . the thermal correction to the casimir force computed using the pfa is considered both in the limiting case of very low temperatures , @xmath145 , and in the case @xmath133 .",
    "the latter includes the region of parameters where all measurements of the casimir force in sphere - plate configuration have been performed .",
    "the results for the thermal correction obtained using the pfa are compared with available exact results .",
    "it is emphasized that in the experimental region @xmath133 the exact results of ref .",
    "@xcite in the zeroth order of @xmath42 coincide with the simplified formulation of the pfa .",
    "this provides a theoretical basis for the application of the pfa in the measurements of the thermal casimir force for the comparison between experiment and theory .",
    "the applicability of the pfa and the possibility to observe the thermal correction to the casimir force in the configuration of a sphere above a plate made of real metals are discussed in sec .",
    "v. here , the relative thermal corrections to the casimir force and to the casimir pressure are computed in the framework of both the drude model and the plasma model approaches .",
    "the obtained results are compared with the error introduced from the use of the pfa and with typical experimental errors of force and pressure measurements .",
    "new evidence is provided that some unaccounted systematic errors in the experiment of refs .",
    "@xcite can not bring the measurement results in agreement with the prediction of the drude model approach .",
    "it is argued that the configuration of a sphere above a plate is well suited to exclude the large thermal correction derived within the drude model approach but scarcely can be used for the experimental observation of small thermal effects , as predicted from the plasma model approach .",
    "the reason is that the respective thermal correction @xmath252 is several times larger than the error of pfa , @xmath42 , only at sufficiently large separations , where the error of force or equivalent pressure measurements exceeds @xmath252 .",
    "the exact computational results for the thermal correction to the casimir force between real metals described by the drude and plasma models are compared with the pfa results .",
    "it is shown that the region of parameters where the exact results are available is outside the area of application of the pfa .",
    "we demonstrate that at relatively large separations the ratio @xmath214 can go to different limiting values ( 2 , 3/2 or 1 ) depending on the relationship between the parameters @xmath7 , @xmath2 , @xmath253 and @xmath10 .",
    "this generalizes the results of refs .",
    "the performed comparison enables us to conclude that the available exact results for real metals converge to the pfa results when @xmath254 . for the experimental values of @xmath42 varying from 0.00063 to 0.005 the errors due to the use of the pfa instead of the exact methods are much less than the experimental error of force and pressure measurements in all experiments performed to the present day .    in the configuration of two parallel plates ,",
    "we have calculated the relative thermal correction to the gradient of the casimir pressure which is measured in the dynamic regime ( sec .",
    "vi ) . we show that a small thermal effect , as predicted in the plasma model approach , is additionally suppressed in the gradient of the casimir pressure .",
    "because of this , the original casimir configuration of two parallel plates of sufficiently large area used in the static regime remains the most prospective for measurement of small thermal effect in the casimir force .",
