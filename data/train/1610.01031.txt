    "@xmath0the answer to that question is no , not really . here are some of the pending issues regarding extinction laws :    * in the mid - infrared ( mir ) : how do the water , aliphates , and silicates features vary among sightlines ? * in the near - infrared ( nir ) : what is the slope of the power law that is commonly used to characterize the extinction law ?",
    "is it universal ? * in the optical range : what is the functional form of the extinction law ? how do you include the diffuse interstellar bands ( dibs ) ?",
    "can we find sightlines to measure the extinction law from 3000    to 30  @xmath1 m continuously ? * are the ir / optical and the ultraviolet ( uv ) extinction laws correlated or not ?    some of the problems above are related to the lack of data e.g. very few uv sightlines have been measured at low metallicity .",
    "others are due to the existence of published works with calibration issues or with outdated methods . once we solve those questions we can attack with confidence more profound ones such as how the extinction law varies as a function of the type of environment . considering that extinction affects a large number of astronomical measurements , it is important we undersatnd how to correct for it .",
