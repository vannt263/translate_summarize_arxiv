    "m82 is the closest galaxy experiencing a massive star formation episode @xcite .",
    "its nuclear starburst , located in the central 1kpc , has been the subject of continuum and line observations made in virtually all wavelengths from x - rays to the radio domain .",
    "these studies indicate that the high rate of supernova explosions and the strong uv radiation fields have heavily influenced the physical properties and kinematics of the interstellar medium in m82 .",
    "the high supernova rate has created a biconical outflow of hot gas ( bregman , schulman , & tomisaka 1995 ; shopbell & bland - hawthorn 1998 ) also observed in the cold gas and dust ( alton , davis , & bianchi 1999 ; seaquist & clark 2001 ) .",
    "the discovery of a @xmath0500pc molecular gas chimney and a giant supershell in m82 , detected in sio , indicates the occurrence of large - scale shocks in the disk - halo interface of the starburst @xcite .",
    "furthermore , there are evidences that the strong uv - fields have created a particular physical environment in the molecular gas reservoir of m82 @xcite .",
    "the common picture emerging from these studies is that the bulk of co emission in the nuclear disk of m82 comes from moderately dense ( with n(h@xmath3)@xmath010@xmath4 - 10@xmath5@xmath6 ) photon dominated regions ( pdr ) .",
    "however , these conclusions are model - dependent and not free from internal inconsistencies @xcite .",
    "observational evidence supports that the emission of the formyl radical ( hco ) mainly arises from pdr at the interfaces between the ionized and the molecular gas in our galaxy .",
    "after the first detection of hco by snyder , hollis , & ulich ( 1976 ) ulterior searches have confirmed that this radical is associated with regions where chemistry is driven by an enhanced uv radiation field ( hollis & churchwell 1983 ; snyder , schenewerk , & hollis 1985 ; schenewerk et al.1988 ; schilke et al .",
    "2001 ) . on the theoretical side ,",
    "several chemical models have been put forward to account for the observed abundances of hco in pdr ( de jong , boland , & dalgarno 1980 ; leung , herbst , & huebner 1984 ; schilke et al .",
    "2001 ) .",
    "we have chosen hco , a privileged tracer of pdr chemistry , to investigate the influence of the m82 starburst on its molecular gas reservoir .",
    "@xcite tentatively detected the emission of hco at 3 mm in m82 , using single - dish observations .",
    "however , the hco lines appear blended with sio and h@xmath7co@xmath8 lines in their spectrum .",
    "furthermore , the low spatial resolution ( 50  ) of their single - pointed map did not allow to infer the spatial distribution of hco . in this letter we present a high - resolution ( @xmath05  ) image of the emission of hco in the nucleus of m82 .",
    "the interferometer hco map of m82 , the first obtained in an external galaxy , shows unambiguous evidence that the whole nuclear disk has become a _ giant _ pdr of @xmath0650pc size with a total hco abundance of @xmath0410@xmath1 .",
    "the enhancement of hco presents spatial variations which depend on the distance to the most prominent hii regions of the m82 s starburst .",
    "the hco observations of m82 were carried out with the iram array at plateau de bure ( france ) during 1999 june , using the 4-antennas cd set of configurations .",
    "we observed four of the strongest n@xmath9=1@xmath10 - 0@xmath11 hyperfine lines of hco .",
    "these transitions form a 3 mm quartet : j=3/21/2 , f=21(86.671ghz ) and f=10(86.708ghz ) ; j=1/21/2 , f=11(86.777ghz ) and f=01(86.806ghz ) .",
    "we observed simultaneously the j=21 line of sio(86.847ghz ) , and the j=10 line of h@xmath7co@xmath12(86.754ghz ) .",
    "the one - field observations are made centering the 55@xmath13 primary beam of the array at @xmath14=@xmath15 and @xmath16=@xmath17 , which corresponds to the 2.2@xmath18 peak ( joy , lester , & harvey 1987 ) .",
    "calibration of visibilities was performed as explained in @xcite .",
    "the synthesized beam is almost circular ( @xmath19 , pa=105@xmath20 ) .",
    "the rms noise level in 2.5mhz wide channel maps , derived after subtraction of the continuum emission , is 1mjy / beam ( 5mk ) .",
    "we assume a distance to m82 of d=3.9mpc @xcite ; the latter implies 1@xmath020pc .",
    "we define the @xmath21 and @xmath22 axes to run parallel to the galaxy major and minor axes , respectively , where @xmath230 eastward and @xmath240 northward .",
    "the major axis has pa=70@xmath20 ; ( x , y ) offsets are referred to the 2.2@xmath18 peak .",
    "all through the paper , line intensities are not corrected from primary beam attenuation .",
    "note however that the bulk of the discussion is based on the study of the ratios of lines which are equally affected by this bias .",
    "if they were to be corrected , hco and h@xmath7co@xmath12 intensities should be both multiplied by a factor @xmath01.3 at the edge of the m82 s nuclear disk ( at a@xmath017  radius ) .",
    "figure 1a represents the velocity - integrated intensity map obtained for the strongest hyperfine component ( f=21 ) of the j=3/21/2 line of hco .",
    "this image shows that the emission of hco is widespread in the nuclear starburst of m82 .",
    "the bulk of the emission comes from a highly - structured disk of @xmath0650pc full diameter and barely resolved vertical thickness .",
    "the hco distribution in the plane mimics the ring morphology displayed by other molecular gas tracers in m82 @xcite .",
    "two emission peaks at ( x , y)=(+16,-2  ) and ( -15,0  ) locate the eastern and western lobes of the hco ring viewed edge - on .",
    "a central clump at ( + 2,0  ) is close to the 2.2@xmath18 peak identified as the dynamical center @xcite . with lower statistical significance , we detect out - of - the plane emission in a clump at ( -9,8  ) . however , the full - size of this structure is smaller than the beam , and therefore its reality is doubtful .",
    "figure 1b shows the spectra of hco , sio and h@xmath7co@xmath8 integrated in the regions of the two ring maxima ( see figure 1a ) .",
    "gaussian profiles are fitted for the identified lines .",
    "together with the strongest f=21 line , emission of the f=10 component is detected at 4@xmath25 level in the two ring lobes .",
    "we have also detected the f=11 and f=01 transitions in the western and eastern lobes , respectively .",
    "we estimate an average f=21/f=10 line ratio of @xmath03@xmath261 ( @xmath01.5@xmath260.5 ) for the western ( eastern ) lobe . within the errors ,",
    "these ratios are close to the theoretical line ratio of @xmath01.7 , expected for optically thin emission .    figures 2a - b show the hco(f=21 ) integrated intensity contours overlaid with the zero moment maps of h@xmath7co@xmath8 ( 10 ) @xcite and @xmath27co(21 ) @xcite .",
    "although all images reveal a ring - like distribution of molecular gas in the nucleus of m82 , the separation between the e / w lobes differ significantly between hco ( @xmath032  ) and both @xmath27co and h@xmath7co@xmath8 ( @xmath025  ) .",
    "the hco emission extends farther out in the disk , especially in the eastern lobe .",
    "the hco torus encircles the molecular torus traced by h@xmath7co@xmath8 and co. most remarkably , the ring of hii regions ( of 10-15  size ) identified by br@xmath28 @xcite , neii @xcite , and radio - recombination lines ( e.g. the h41@xmath29 map of seaquist et al .",
    "1996 ) lies just inside the co molecular ring .",
    "the hco , co and hii rings are nested with hco lying in the outer edge of the disk .",
    "the central hco maximum is also displaced from the @xmath27co / h@xmath7co@xmath8 hot spot at ( -3,0  ) . at smaller scales also , the peaks of hco appear to avoid the brightest hii regions ( see section 4 ) . to interpret the described morphology we will first estimate the spatial distribution of the abundance of hco in m82 and discuss different scenarios accounting for it .",
    "kinematics of hco gas in m82 s disk show no significant departures from the general rotation pattern typically displayed by other molecular gas tracers in this galaxy .",
    "figure 3 represents in gray scale the hco(f=21)/h@xmath7co@xmath8(10 ) intensity ratio map in the nucleus of m82 , derived using a 6@xmath25 ( 4@xmath25 ) clipping for h@xmath7co@xmath8(10 ) ( hco(f=21 ) ) .",
    "the inferred ratio , accurate to 30@xmath30 varies between @xmath00.50@xmath260.15 ( at the outer edges of the ring , and in the central peak ) to @xmath00.15@xmath260.04 ( in the region between the hco maxima ) , with an average ratio of @xmath00.25@xmath260.07 for the whole disk . in order to derive the hco",
    "to h@xmath7co@xmath8 column density ratio we need to make several assumptions about both the optical thickness and excitation temperature of the lines . based on studies of hco emission in galactic pdr @xcite it is plausible to suppose that the hco lines should be optically thin also in m82 .",
    "the hyperfine line ratios measured in m82 seem to confirm these expectations .",
    "as excitation temperature for hco we will assume @xmath31=10@xmath32 ; this value was derived from a multitransition analysis made by @xcite on ngc2024 .    for h@xmath7co@xmath8 we will also consider optically thin emission @xcite and the same excitation temperature as assumed for hco .",
    "these are reasonable guesses , especially for @xmath31 , as the two molecules have similar critical densities for the examined transitions . in this case",
    "the calculation of hco to h@xmath7co@xmath8 column density ratio is straightforward using the expression @xcite :    @xmath33    where @xmath34 is the total column density , @xmath35 is the degeneracy of the upper hyperfine level ( @xmath35=5 for @xmath36=2 ) , @xmath37 is the integrated intensity , and @xmath38 is the einstein coefficient of the transition .",
    "we derive values for @xmath39 that range from 2 to 8 , with an average value of 3.6 for the whole disk . adopting an average fractional abundance for h@xmath7co@xmath8 of @xmath010@xmath1 @xcite",
    ", we derive x(hco)@xmath0410@xmath1 in m82 .",
    "@xcite measured a value of @xmath409.7 in the hii region ngc2024 . on the contrary ,",
    "values of @xmath39 significantly lower than 1 , i.e. an order magnitude below those found in ngc2024 , have been reported by @xcite in galactic clouds without developed hii regions or having no indication of star formation .",
    "more recently , @xcite have searched for hco in a reduced sample of prototypical pdr .",
    "the estimated @xmath39 abundance ratios range from @xmath030 ( in the orion bar ) to @xmath03 ( in ngc7023 ) .",
    "the largest hco abundances are found in the orion bar : the paradigm of interaction between an hii region ( m42 ) and its parent molecular cloud .",
    "comparing our global estimates of @xmath403.6 in m82 with the values measured for the prototypical pdr in our galaxy , we conclude that the nuclear disk of m82 can be viewed as a _ giant _ pdr .",
    "further analysis of the spatial variation of the @xmath39 ratio shows that the chemistry driven by the strong uv fields has produced the highest hco enhancement in the outer edges of the starburst ring ; the central clump also shows a similar hco enrichment ( @xmath4078 ) .",
    "these regions , with hco abundances approaching those of ngc2024 , lie close to the loci of hii regions in m82 but do not quite coincide spatially with them .",
    "a mere inspection of figure 3 indicates that the hco - enriched molecular clouds surround the ionized gas as shown by the strongest [ neii ] emission : x(hco)/[neii ] peaks avoid each other and are shifted by offsets of @xmath050 - 150pc .",
    "this might seem paradoxical as a close correlation between hii regions and pdr could be expected at these scales . as discussed below , this distribution could be explained however as the final result of _ propagation _ of pdr chemistry in m82 .",
    "the enhancement of hco in pdr is mostly an observational fact , reproduced with uneven success by models .",
    "pdr models published so far have tried to account for the derived abundance of hco using either gas - phase schemes @xcite or incorporating dust grains to the chemistry @xcite . according to @xcite , the c@xmath12 ion , highly abundant in uv - processed cloud envelopes ,",
    "would start the chain of reactions leading to ch@xmath3 and finally , to hco . confirming these expectations",
    ", @xcite found an empirical correlation between hco and c@xmath12 radio recombination line emission in two galactic clouds .",
    "@xcite have proposed a model where hco is the final by - product of the photodesorption or evaporation of solid formaldehyde on dust grain mantles @xcite .",
    "although the values of x(hco ) predicted by @xcite are still one order of magnitude below what is typically found in pdr , these results are encouraging .",
    "based on a 1-dimensional model made for the orion molecular cloud , @xcite predict that the large photodissociation rate of hco @xcite could be counterbalanced only for extinctions a@xmath415 - 6 . for a population of clouds uniformly bathed in the pervasive uv field of a starburst galaxy",
    ", the a@xmath42 limit should be risen by a factor of @xmath0a few , making the equivalent condition on column density close to n(h@xmath3)@xmath4310@xmath44@xmath45 .",
    "the hco map of m82 provides direct evidence that the starburst event has heavily processed the bulk of molecular gas in this galaxy . the global fractional abundance of hco ( @xmath0410@xmath1 , averaged over @xmath0650pc )",
    "can be accounted within a pdr scenario .",
    "paradoxically , the spatial correlation between hco - enriched clouds and hii regions is poor however .",
    "this is noticeable both at large scales ( hco / co / hii nested ring morphology ) but also at small scales ( peaks of hco / hii emission avoid each other ) .",
    "the poor correlation suggests that uv fields coming from the strongest hii regions of m82 , lying in the inner @xmath0400pc , have photodissociated the bulk of hco in nearby molecular cloud envelopes .",
    "previous observational evidence pointed out to a disrupted physical environment for the dense ism in m82 .",
    "observations of the atomic carbon [ ci]@xmath4p@xmath46p@xmath47 and @xmath4p@xmath48p@xmath49 lines @xcite confirmed that the m82 [ ci]/co abundance ratio ( @xmath00.5 ) is higher than observed in non - starburst disks ( it is @xmath0.15 in our galaxy ) .",
    "moreover , the measured j=21/10 ratio can only be reconciled with clouds being small ( with sizes @xmath01pc ) , only moderately dense ( with densities @xmath010@xmath4 - 10@xmath5@xmath6 ) , and hot ( with temperatures @xmath050 - 100k ) @xcite .",
    "similar conclusions , based on large velocity gradient ( lvg ) and pdr modelling of @xmath27co , @xmath7co , and c@xmath50o line ratios have been reported by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the bulk of molecular clouds in the inner @xmath0400pc of m82 might have low densities ( at some places in the disk as low as @xmath010@xmath4@xmath6 ) and small sizes ( @xmath01pc ) . assuming this scenario ,",
    "the survival of hco against photodissociation , requiring column densities n(h@xmath3)@xmath4310@xmath44@xmath45 might be difficult .",
    "most remarkably , the location of hco - enriched clouds in our map , identified by their largest @xmath39 ratio ( the outer ring and the central clump ) , coincides with weiss et al.s model predictions on where individual molecular clouds may have the largest column densities ( where volume densities reach a few @xmath010@xmath5@xmath6 ) .",
    "furthermore , the intensity of uv fields is there comparatively lower ( see figure 3 ) .",
    "the reported differences between hco and h@xmath7co@xmath8 maps in m82 can not be easily explained with the present pdr models however , as both species are expected to be closely associated in pdr .",
    "other unexplored scenarios can not be excluded as plausible explanations for the enhancement of hco : x - ray or cosmic ray dominated regions chemistries might account for it in the case of m82 ( suchkov , allen , & heckman 1993 ) . moreover , we can not exclude the presence of dense molecular gas ( with n(h@xmath3)@xmath4310@xmath51@xmath6 ) in the central 1kpc of m82 as already pointed out by @xcite and @xcite , or shown by the detection of tracers of dense molecular gas ( see hcn map of brouillet & schilke 1993 ) .",
    "however , our results suggest that evaporation / destruction of molecular clouds by uv fields is highly efficient in the inner @xmath0400pc of the galaxy .",
    "this efficiency shows spatial trends within the m82 s disk but the reasons behind these variations remain to be understood .",
    "m82 is the only galaxy where emission of hco has been detected so far .",
    "hco emission was also searched for in the starburst galaxy ngc253 by @xcite . their data , giving no detection , allowed to set a 3-@xmath25 upper limit for the hco / h@xmath7co@xmath8 ratio of @xmath52 0.12 , i.e. a factor of 4 - 5 smaller than the value measured in the m82 s ring .",
    "hco is the only _ complex _ molecule showing a larger fractional abundance in m82 than in ngc253 @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the remarkably different abundances and spatial distributions of sio gas in ngc253 and m82 are suggestive of an evolutionary link between these starbursts @xcite .",
    "the large hco abundance in m82 may fit within this scenario , which considers the m82 starburst episode as more evolved than in ngc253 .",
    "the chemistry of molecular gas in ngc253 is heavily influenced by the large - scale shocks and heating induced by a burst of pre - main sequence massive stars .",
    "this explains the high abundance of sio and the significantly low abundance of hco .",
    "the chemistry of molecular gas in m82 is dominated by the action of uv fields produced by more evolved massive stars giving rise to hii regions .",
    "the remnant of the starburst presents a pdr - like chemistry favoring the presence of hco , but forcing a low abundance for other complex molecules .",
    "this work received support from the spanish dges under grant number aya , 2000 - 0927 and cicyt - pnie under grant esp2001 - 4519-pe .",
