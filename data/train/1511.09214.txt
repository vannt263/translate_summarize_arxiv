    "atoms in high - lying rydberg states strongly interact with each other via the long - range dipole - dipole or van der waals potentials @xcite .",
    "these interactions can suppress multiple rydberg excitations of atoms within a certain blockade distance from each other @xcite , and are being explored for obtaining ordered phases of interacting many - body systems and simulating quantum phase transitions @xcite .",
    "several conceptually different approaches have been suggested for the preparation of crystalline order of rydberg excitations in spatially - extended ensembles of cold atoms .",
    "these include direct ( near-)resonant laser excitation of strongly - interacting rydberg states in continuous or lattice gases @xcite , and the deceleration and storage in one - dimensional ( 1d ) atomic medium of propagating light pulses forming the so - called rydberg polaritons under the conditions of electromagnetically induced transparency @xcite .",
    "a common feature of all these schemes is that the resulting spatially - periodic structure of rydberg excitations has finite density - density correlation length , while their number exhibits highly sub - poissonian statistics characterized by negative mandel parameter @xmath0 .",

    "an experimental realization involving a few rydberg excitations in a 1d lattice of several tens of sites was recently reported in ref .",
    "our aim here is to critically re - examine this protocol , taking into account realistic relaxation processes affecting the atoms .",
    "we find that , under typical experimental conditions , it is not feasible to attain the perfectly - ordered ground state of the hamiltonian even for three or four rydberg excitations in a finite 1d lattice gas .",
    "this is because the atomic decay and dephasing during the exceedingly long preparation time required for the adiabatic evolution of the system spoil the adiabaticity and significantly reduce the overlap of the final state of the system with the target ground state of the hamiltonian .",
    "this overlap , or fidelity , is largest at some intermediate value of the preparation time , and maximizing the probability of the ordered state of rydberg excitations requires therefore a compromise between the adiabatic following and decoherence . even though the perfectly - ordered state can not be obtained with high fidelity , good spatial ordering of rydberg excitations is still achieved .",
    "we consider a system of @xmath1 atoms trapped in a 1d optical lattice potential , with one atom per lattice site , assuming no site - occupation defects . a spatially - uniform time - dependent laser field couples the ground state @xmath2 of each atom to the rydberg state @xmath3 with the rabi frequency @xmath4 and detuning @xmath5 . in",

    "the smaller preparation fidelity of the longer @xmath179 crystal is to be expected , as the system has to adiabatically follow more ( avoided ) level crossings , the last of which in the vicinity of @xmath180 has very small level repulsion @xmath181 . what is more surprising , however , is that , for the same duration @xmath139 of the process , the final population of the target double excitation state @xmath90 in the shorter lattice is smaller than the final population of the target triple - excitation state @xmath81 in an appropriately longer lattice ( cf .",
    "[ fig : n19fw ] ) . this counter - intuitive behavior can be understood from the following consideration : due to the small effective coupling @xmath182 between states @xmath54 and @xmath62 , and the resulting small level repulsion in the vicinity of @xmath183 , only a fraction of population of state @xmath184 is adiabatically converted into the population of the @xmath177 ground state @xmath90 . on the other hand ,",
    "the @xmath137 crystalline ground state @xmath70 can be populated not only from state @xmath62 , but also from other higher - energy double - excitation states @xmath185 ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : n19dyn ] ) .",
    "thus , much of the population remaining in @xmath184 after its ( avoided ) level crossing with @xmath62 is transferred to the other double - excitation states @xmath185 , two of which , @xmath186 and @xmath187 , can later be converted into @xmath81 . interestingly",
    ", this partial return of population from the higher energy states to the adiabatic ground state of the system leads to its final population which is larger than would follow from a nave use of the independent , or sequential , level crossing approximation @xcite .",
    "to summarize , we have shown that preparing small crystals of merely two to four rydberg excitations in a lattice gas of several tens of atoms using the adiabatic protocol @xcite requires exceedingly long times to effect a slow - enough change of detuning of the laser field irradiating the atoms . then , under typical experimental conditions @xcite , the relaxation processes affecting the atoms during such long preparation times cause multiple transitions between the diabatic energy levels and deplete the adiabatic crystalline ground state of the system .",
    "the resulting mixed final state is then essentially a steady - state of the dissipative system @xcite subject to a uniform driving laser with the same final detuning .    in an experiment ,",
    "the fidelity of preparation of a target crystalline state of @xmath21 excitations of atoms in a one - dimensional lattice is the probability of simultaneously detecting @xmath21 rydberg atoms at equidistant positions , which is obtained from many repetitions of the preparation and site - resolved measurement cycles . in our somewhat idealized treatment",
    ", we assumed a perfect lattice of atoms with unity filling of each site , and neglected the motion of rydberg - excited atoms and their detection errors .",
    "clearly , the initial site - occupation defects of the trapped ground - state atoms , the motion and loss of the untrapped rydberg - excited atoms , as well as finite detection efficiency will result in further reduction of the measured preparation fidelities of crystalline phases of rydberg excitations .    while these results may appear discouraging for the prospects of attaining sizable crystals of rydberg excitations in laser - driven atomic media , our simulations of dissipative dynamics of the system still reveal spatial ordering of rydberg excitations and highly sub - poissonian probability distribution of the excitation number , which should not be very sensitive to site - occupation defects .",
    "we note that similar and even larger structures can be obtained , or `` grown '' , perhaps more efficiently if , instead of slowly changing the detuning of the laser uniformly irradiating a chain of atoms initially in the ground state , one sweeps the laser beam with a fixed frequency form the one end of the chain to the other @xcite .",
    "we hope that our analysis and result are both stimulating and important for the general field of simulating interacting , dissipative many - body systems and imitating their various phases with rydberg atoms .",
