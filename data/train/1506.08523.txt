    "in the last years great attention has been drawn to the time dependent quantum harmonic oscillator .",
    "this problem has been thoroughly studied both from mechanical @xcite and electromagnetic @xcite points of view , showing squeezing effects .",
    "the approach most used in the tackle of this sort of problems is the use of quantum mechanical invariant operators , in particular the lewis - ermakov invariant @xcite .    in the field of",
    "guided propagation of light , the analogous problem is the study of longitudinally inhomogeneous ( @xmath0 ) media .",
    "an invariant approach was extensively used in @xcite and more recently in @xcite in the study of graded index media but , in both cases , they studied classical problems by means of a quantum - theoretical approach .",
    "quantum propagation problems have been dealt with in homogeneous media , as shown in @xcite and references therein .",
    "these studies provided the background of the quantum theory of light propagation showing that the operator which describes correctly the quantum spatial propagation along an arbitrary direction @xmath1 is the momentum operator @xmath2 , since the hamiltonian approach fails for problems like dispersive media , counterpropagation and @xmath0 media as well @xcite .",
    "a first approximation to @xmath0 media were carried out by abram @xcite and glauber and lewenstein @xcite , where single optical discontinuities between homogeneous media were analyzed . in these studies",
    "they showed the different physical behaviour the fields experience from the analogous mathematical problem of the time dependent quantum harmonic oscillator , proving that the field quadrature noise does not exhibit real squeezing , in agreement with experiments .",
    "as far as we know , there is not any work dealing with quantum states of light propagating in @xmath0 media in such a way that field quadratures do not exhibit real squeezing .",
    "so , our purpose is to give a phenomenological approach to this problem in waveguides .",
    "to this end , we will start obtaining the classical solutions which help us to find a reference frame which continuously performs a physical variable change in @xmath0 media and eliminates the virtual squeezing , leading us to a proper propagation generator , a quantum lewis - ermakov type momentum operator @xmath2 . from this operator",
    "we will obtain fock states in the optical - field strength ( ofs ) representation @xmath3 and derive the propagator , proving the lack of squeezing in this representation and the arising of a quantum gouy s phase .",
    "furthermore , we will present the particular case of propagation of a gaussian quantum state in a cosine - type @xmath0 medium , where will be shown that the net effect of this kind of media on quantum states is the generation of a quantum guoy s phase dependent on features of both the media and the input quantum state .",
    "our aim is to study the propagation of waveguided modes of quantum light in dispersion - free and non - magnetic media with separable inhomogeneous refractive index in an arbitrary direction of propagation @xmath1 , given by @xcite : @xmath4 where the longitudinal @xmath5 and transversal @xmath6 parts of the index are completely independent and @xmath7 and @xmath8 are constants .",
    "we focus on the separable index problem as it does not show coupling and therefore radiation modes ( losses ) .    from maxwell equations ,",
    "it is easy to show that the electric field @xmath9 obeys the vectorial wave equation @xcite : @xmath10 with @xmath11 .",
    "let us consider monochromatic guided @xmath12 vector modes with frequency @xmath13 represented by vector field solutions with the following factorable complex amplitudes : @xmath14 where we have used @xmath15 for simplicity standing for the modal numbers @xmath16 , @xmath17 in each transverse direction , z - dependent complex coefficients @xmath18 fulfilling @xmath19 , and electric normalized transverse complex amplitudes @xmath20 corresponding to quasi - te ( or quasi - tm ) modes fulfilling a _ quasi_-complete orthonormalization condition @xcite , which belong to the homogeneous part of the refractive index and satisfy : @xmath21 with @xmath22 the transverse propagation constant .",
    "solutions of this equation give us the invariant transverse modal structure of the field . applying equations , ( [ modese ] ) and ( [ transwaveeq ] ) into ( [ vwe ] ) , we obtain : @xmath23 , @xmath24 is the local propagation constant of the @xmath15-mode this propagation equation clearly suggests a local spatial harmonic oscillator and therefore it can be directly derived from spatial - type hamilton equations where the hamilonian is substituted by the momentum , since it is the generator of spatial translations given by : @xmath25,\\ ] ] with @xmath26 and prime stands for @xmath1-derivative .",
    "this result is analogous to that obtained in @xcite where time - dependent linear media was studied .",
    "the classical momentum ( [ momentooh ] ) is equivalent to the hamiltonian of a time - dependent harmonic oscillator , with @xmath27 playing the role of @xmath28 @xcite .",
    "likewise , the solution of equation ( [ waveeq ] ) is easily obtained via the use of the complex electric field @xmath29 in the following way : @xmath30 where @xmath31 and @xmath32 are real functions obtained by solving : @xmath33 with @xmath34 .",
    "equation ( [ el ] ) is an ermakov - pinney equation with solutions given by @xcite : @xmath35^{1/2},\\\\ \\label{rho0 } \\rho_{\\sigma}(0)=1 , \\quad \\rho_{\\sigma}'(0)=0,\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] and where @xmath36 and @xmath37 are linearly independent functions that satisfy equation ( [ waveeq ] ) and have the following initial conditions and wronskian : @xmath38 so , the classical wave amplitude changes continously during propagation by a factor @xmath31 , whereas the modal propagation constant is given by @xmath39 via equation ( [ eltheta ] ) where @xmath32 represents the total phase accumulated in the propagation .",
    "the next step is to quantize the classical momentum ( [ momentooh ] ) . but before carrying out this step , some considerations have to be taken into account .",
    "direct quantization of the classsical fields @xmath40 and",
    "@xmath41 would lead to a quantized @xmath1-dependent momentum analogous to the hamiltonian for a time - dependent harmonic oscillator and , therefore , following the usual steps , we would have propagation equations leading to quadrature noise squeezing @xcite .",
    "but in the sudy of propagation in @xmath42 dielectric media , this approach does not provide consistent results . as was pointed out by abram in his seminal paper about quantization of light in dielectric media @xcite , when quantum states propagating in a dielectric are represented in the basis of free - space photons ,",
    "they seem to be squeezed , but inside a dielectric there is no experiment that can detect free - space photons .",
    "this happens because if we wish to detect photons inside the medium the fields would experiment an effective refractive index equivalent to the squeezing parameter and , therefore , a scale change is necessary . in the same spirit an interesting discussion about quantization in a dielectric",
    "was carried out by glauber and lewestein in @xcite . in this study",
    "is stressed that the measurement of quantum states of light is based on photoabsorption processes carried out in the basis which diagonalizes the hamiltonian in every medium .",
    "this is so because the photocount distribution is given by a normal ordered correlation product in the local basis , result of the physical property of the photoabsorption process that the energy of the field decreases when a photon is absorbed .",
    "but in any other basis this is not true , because of the mixing of absorption and emission operators , and therefore of frequencies , lacking the normal ordering in the correlation product .",
    "thereby the state in these bases can not be measured and the photons are so - called virtual and , accordingly , the squeezing is virtual as well .",
    "this statement is closely related with abram s idea and has to be applied to @xmath42 media as it is the continuous limit of single discontinuities .",
    "hence , we look for some transformation which takes the classical momentum ( [ momentooh ] ) to be a constant of motion suitable to be quantized and simultaneously get rid of the virtual squeezing in a continuous way . since carrying out the usual approach @xcite squeezing proportional to the function @xmath43 would appear , following the idea of a scale change in the discontinuity @xcite we propose the following generalized canonical transformations from a generating function @xmath44 and @xmath1 transformation @xcite : @xmath45 and the next gauge transformations related to the new @xmath46-frame : @xmath47 with the dot standing for an @xmath46-derivative . applying these relations into ( [ momentooh ] ) ,",
    "we directly obtain the following momentum : @xmath48,\\ ] ] where we have used the auxiliar equation ( [ el ] ) .",
    "it is remarkable that these new phase space and longitudinal coordinates ( @xmath49 ) are analogous to the comoving coordinates and the conformal ( or arc - parameter ) time used in cosmology and , likewise , the canonical momentum transformation ( [ gct2 ] ) is related to the hubble s law @xcite .",
    "after these transformations , the continuous change in the value of the harmonic potential appears as constant in the new comoving frame of reference @xcite .",
    "so , in this frame , there are not scale changes differentially and the medium seems to be homogeneous .",
    "the generalized canonical transformations eliminate the squeezing at each plane @xmath1 and none signature of it is obtained .",
    "these insights lead us to consider the comoving frame as the physical one and therefore the proper one for quantization .",
    "furthermore , interestingly , if we rewrite this momentum in the original phase space , we obtain : @xmath50.\\ ] ] this is the space - analog of an ermakov - lewis invariant @xcite .",
    "so , it can be said that the momentum ( [ momentogct ] ) is a spatial ermakov - lewis invariant in a comoving frame and that this invariant is the generator of spatial propagation in this kind of media .",
    "now , following the principle of quantization of quantum mechanics @xmath51 , where @xmath52=i\\hbar\\delta_{\\sigma , \\sigma'}$ ] , we obtain the momentum operator : @xmath53.\\ ] ] in order to obtain the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of this operator , we define the following annihilation and creation operators : @xmath54 ,   \\\\",
    "\\label{creat } \\hat{a}^{\\dag}_{\\sigma}(s)=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\hbar\\beta_{0\\sigma}}}[\\beta_{0\\sigma}\\hat{q}_{\\sigma}-i\\hat{p}_{\\sigma } ] .",
    "\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] therefore , equation ( [ qmomento ] ) in terms of ( [ creat ] ) can be rewritten as : @xmath55.\\ ] ] the eigenstates of this momentum are the same as those of the number operator @xmath56 , which fulfills the next eigenvalue equation : @xmath57 where @xmath58 and @xmath59 are eigenvalues and eigenstates for the number operator , respectively . in terms of quantum - optical units",
    "@xcite , we can redefine the quantum comoving scaled position @xmath60 as the ofs operator @xmath61 , whose eigenstates are those measured in homodyne experiments @xcite and central to generalized quantum polarization @xcite , that is @xmath62 .",
    "the eigenstates @xmath59 in the optical field - strength @xmath3 basis are given in terms of hermite - gauss functions as : @xmath63 and their quantum propagation is given by a spatial schrdinger equation : @xmath64 \\ , \\psi_{n } = \\hbar\\beta_{0\\sigma}\\,\\psi_{n}.\\ ] ] the solution of this equation yields the following propagated eigenstates @xmath59 : @xmath65 with @xmath66 the total accumulated phase , in the same way as a quantum state propagating in a homogeneous medium , but in this case in a comoving frame , which is the physical one for this kind of problems as shown above .",
    "because of the similarity of this phase with the classical gouy s phase @xcite , we call it spatial quantum gouy s phase .",
    "now , in order to gain insight into the behaviour of the longitudinally inhomogeneous waveguide , we study the spatial propagation of gaussian states , like the coherent and squeezed quantum states of light , in the ofs representation . from the wavefunction ( [ number ] ) and",
    "mehler s formula @xcite , we easily obtain the propagator of the system for every mode @xcite : @xmath67 @xmath68     } , \\ ] ] and the wavefunction of any pure state at the end of the medium can be worked out by means of : @xmath69 where @xmath70 and @xmath71 stand for the @xmath72-mode field - strength at the beginning and any point of the @xmath1-dependent medium , respectively .    ,",

    "\\label{phasesq } \\theta = arctan[\\frac{\\tan\\theta}{\\delta\\mathcal{e}_{0}^{2}}].\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] therefore , a coherent state keeps its quantum noise constant through propagation , @xmath83 , and gets a gouy s phase equal to the classical accumulated phase given by ( [ eltheta ] ) , @xmath84 , as expected , unlike what we would obtain via the usual approach . on the other hand ,",
    "an input squeezed state is both amplitude and phase modulated by the inhomogeneous medium , leading to different squeezing oscillations from those corresponding to an homogeneous medium , and with a squeezing factor given by ( @xmath85 ) .",
    "it is important to outline that the phase acquired by a squeezed state ( @xmath86 ) is not predicted by the classical theory .    , scaledwidth=46.0% ]    next , we show a specific example of the effects this kind of medium produce over a single - mode gaussian quantum state like the above introduced",
    ". we present a longitudinally inhomogeneous cosine - type medium with @xmath87 and length @xmath88 , as that depicted in figure 1 .",
    "the solution of equation ( [ el ] ) is given in terms of linearly independent mathieu functions @xmath89 and @xmath90 @xcite .",
    "applying these solutions into equations ( [ eltheta ] ) and ( [ rhoz ] ) , we can obtain numerically the value of @xmath91 and , therefore , the squeezing factor ( [ sq ] ) and the gouy s phase ( [ phasesq ] ) , which characterize the output quantum state after propagation in this medium . in figures 2 and 3",
    "we show the behaviour of the gouy s phase @xmath92 and the quantum noise @xmath93 , respectively , for three different input quantum states : the solid line stands for the propagation of a coherent state where @xmath94 and the dash and dash - dot lines for squeezed states with @xmath95 and @xmath96 , respectively . as can be checked in figure 2 ,",
    "the planes where maximum or minimum squeezing of the quantum noise are produced depend on the accumulated phase @xmath91 , being different from those corresponding to an homogeneous medium , and the value of the input quantum noise @xmath97 . likewise , as was outlined above , the classical equations do not predict the behaviour of states far from the classical , since squeezed and coherent states get different amounts of guoy s phase @xmath92 , as is sketched in figure 3 .",
    "the classical phase @xmath91 is recovered at the planes of maximum and minimum squeezing .",
    "finally , we stress the interest this phase may have in quantum interferometry , since with an appropriate @xmath42 medium in one arm of an interferometer , quantum interference can be adjusted controlling the strength of the quantum noise in a squeezed input state via equation ( [ phasesq ] ) .    ,",
    "we have studied the propagation of quantum states of light in separable longitudinally inhomogeneous media .",
    "we have proposed canonical transformations in a comoving frame and derived the generator of propagation , the classical momentum , realizing that it is a spatial lewis - ermakov invariant .",
    "we have quantized it and obtained the propagator in the ofs representation which is physically consistent .",
    "furthermore , we have presented the propagation of a gaussian quantum state of light in a cosine - type refractive index medium and shown the net effect produced by this family of media : a quantum gouy s phase dependent on the input quantum state with application in quantum interferometry .",
