    "<S> we consider theoretically phase locking in a simple two - dimensional josephson junction array consisting of two loops coupled via a joint line transverse to the bias current . </S>",
    "<S> ring inductances are supposed to be small , and special emphasis is taken on the influence of external flux . </S>",
    "<S> is is shown , that in the stable oscillation regime both cells oscillate with a phase shift equal to @xmath0 ( i.e. anti - phase ) . </S>",
    "<S> this result may explain the low radiation output obtained so far in two - dimensional josephson junction arrays experimentally .    </S>",

    "<S> _    2ex    josephson junction arrays are currently under consideration as tunable microwave radiation sources . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . after clarifying the basic principles of ( 1d ) arrays@xcite , there is a growing interest in two - dimensional ( 2d ) arrays since the pioneering work by benz and booi@xcite . according to basic estimates@xcite radiation output generated by this type of arrays </S>",
    "<S> is expected to be much larger than that from 1d arrays . however , experimental results point just in the opposite direction . while linear arrays delivered output powers up to @xmath1w , </S>",
    "<S> the maximum output power reported for two - dimensional arrays is around 100nw , @xcite and usually much smaller . while the general estimates referred to above </S>",
    "<S> are surely true , this should be caused by the fact , that actually very few junctions are locked in - phase .    </S>",
    "<S> there can be several reasons responsible for poor radiation output . </S>",
    "<S> besides technological problems this can as well result from the fact , that the basic mechanisms of phase locking in 2d arrays , despite some interesting results on several aspects @xcite , have not yet been fully worked out theoretically . </S>",
    "<S> it is well known though , that there is no phase locking in unshunted 2d arrays in the absence of external flux . </S>",
    "<S> a theoretical study of the influence of flux with a  master - slave - mechanism  by filatrella and wiesenfeld@xcite led to the conclusion that external flux can indeed lead to a certain phase locking ; however the definite value of the phase difference could not be determined by their method , and stability was not considered at all .    here , we start with a very simple model 2d array , consisting of two loops coupled via a line transverse to the bias current ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1 ) . despite its simplicity </S>",
    "<S> this model is difficult enough to show the essential features of larger arrays : it is truly two - dimensional with a possible external flux entering the loops and a inductance in the transverse line , as it is typical in the nowadays favored hybrid arrays . </S>",
    "<S> our propositions are as follows : ( i ) both junctions are considered to be identical . </S>",
    "<S> ( ii ) self - inductance is taken into account while mutual inductances are neglected . </S>",
    "<S> ( iii ) junctions are overdamped with @xmath2 . ( iv ) </S>",
    "<S> there is no external load . </S>",
    "<S> ( v ) instead of working within the framework of the widely used first harmonic approximation we exploit a phase slip technique which has proven successful in 1d arrays before@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> its applicabiliy crucially depends on the proposition that the normalized ring inductance @xmath3 ( @xmath4 critical current of the junctions , @xmath5 ring inductance , @xmath6 flux quantum ) is sufficiantly small ( @xmath7 ) .    </S>",
    "<S> josephson junctions are described by the rsj equations for the josephson phases @xmath8 , @xmath9 where the dot denotes differentiation w.r.t . </S>",
    "<S> the normalized time variable @xmath10 ( @xmath11 : junction normal resistance ; all currents are normalized to @xmath4 ) . </S>",
    "<S> normalizing the external magnetic flux @xmath12 according to @xmath13 we have to respect two flux quantization conditions , @xmath14 in the following the transverse current playing a crucial role in the coupling will be denoted by @xmath15 ( cf . </S>",
    "<S> fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1 ) . in strong coupling problems of this type </S>",
    "<S> it has proven useful to introduce sum and difference variables according to@xcite @xmath16 in addition , we introduce the circular currents @xmath17 with the help of these variables the problem can be reformulated as @xmath18 this indicates , that the voltage sums of both loops are driven by the bias current @xmath19 , while the circular currents drive voltage differences . </S>",
    "<S> further , eq . ( [ sumquantis ] ) is the flux quantization for the whole array , while eq . </S>",
    "<S> [ diffquantis ] shows that differences in the circular currents spread the flux differences of the loops . </S>",
    "<S> the transverse current @xmath15 can be obtained from @xmath20 according to eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ diffquantis ] ) it is just the combination @xmath21 which causes the coupling between the cells .    </S>",
    "<S> the system ( [ sigma0])-([diffquantis ] ) is treated perturbatively assuming the ring inductance @xmath22 to be sufficiently small . </S>",
    "<S> to lowest order , the flux quantization conditions gives ( the second index indicating the order of evaluation ) @xmath23 i.e. , junctions within both loops oscillate exactly in - phase . </S>",
    "<S> the josephson oscillations itself can be evaluated from ( [ sigma0 ] ) as @xmath24 where we introduced the flux - dependent autonomous oscillation frequency @xmath25 this already completes the lowest order solution for our problem ; eqs . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ delta0 ] ) are not required for evaluating the josephson phases within this order , but determine the circular currents @xmath26 with @xmath27 to summarize , in lowest order the junctions within each cell oscillate in phase independently of the value of the external flux , while the relative oscillation phase between the cells remains undetermined .    </S>",
    "<S> changing to the next order @xmath28 we start again from the josephson phase differences ( [ sumquantis ] ) and ( [ diffquantis ] ) , inserting the lowest order result ( [ circ0 ] ) on the r.h.s . of eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ diffquantis ] ) . from the two algebraic equations arising the correction terms @xmath29 can be easily evaluated , and the josephson phase differences of the two loops up to the first order in @xmath22 are given by @xmath30 from this result , one can read off the transverse current @xmath31 with the basic harmonic @xmath32 we point out , that although @xmath15 is proportional to @xmath33 this factor cancels out because of @xmath34 being proportional to @xmath22 itself . accordingly , the amplitude of the transverse current is the same independently of the inductance @xmath22 .    </S>",
    "<S> the most remarkable property of this type of  internal shunt current  is its vanishing for @xmath35 and growing with the external flux @xmath36 . </S>",
    "<S> one should notice , that this behavior is just opposite to that of an external shunt current , which usually turns out to be proportional to @xmath37 . </S>",
    "<S> the absence of any transverse rf current for @xmath35 is however obvious : in this case the array is completely symmetric .    for evaluating the josephson phase sums of the cells we exploit the method of  slowly varying phase </S>",
    "<S>  which has proven useful in the study of phase locking in one - dimensional arrays before@xcite . according to this method corrections </S>",
    "<S> are put into the phases @xmath38 , @xmath39 which are supposed to change adiabatically only ( in comparison to the rf josephson oscillations ) in time . in addition </S>",
    "<S> , we will allow for the possibility that the joint oscillation frequency @xmath40 be ( slightly ) different from the autonomous frequency @xmath41 . with these assumptions </S>",
    "<S> the voltage sums can be written as @xmath42 inserting ( [ sigma1 ] ) into ( [ sigma0 ] ) and neglecting higher orders in @xmath22 after some algebra we arrive at @xmath43 here , all the interaction terms proportional to @xmath22 arising on the l.h.s . </S>",
    "<S> of eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ sigma0 ] ) were transferred to the r.h.s . in this way </S>",
    "<S> , the combination @xmath21 plays a similar role as a synchronizing alternating external or shunt current@xcite .    to proceed , we average over one oscillation period , considering @xmath38 as roughly constant over this time interval . </S>",
    "<S> it can be shown , that only the lowest harmonic ( [ transharm ] ) of @xmath15 contributes . </S>",
    "<S> evaluation of the mean values results in the evolution equations @xmath44 where @xmath45 denotes the one - period average over @xmath38 . </S>",
    "<S> subtraction gives the reduced equation for the phase difference @xmath46 , @xmath47 having formally the same structure as the rsj equation describing an unbiased autonomous junction . </S>",
    "<S> it admits two phase locking solutions , @xmath48 describing in - phase resp . </S>",
    "<S> anti - phase oscillations of the cells . </S>",
    "<S> investigation of the stability leads to the liapunov coefficient @xmath49 as a result , only anti - phase oscillations are stable against small perturbations . by substituting ( [ sol ] ) into ( [ delta1 ] ) </S>",
    "<S> one easily recovers that the oscillation frequency remains equal to that of an autonomous junction , i.e. @xmath50    to summarize , the following picture arises : from earlier results @xcite we know , that the two junctions within each strongly coupled cell are generally ( except for @xmath51 ) aligned in - phase . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , according to ( [ sol ] ) both junctions from cell one oscillate anti - phase relative to those from cell 2 . </S>",
    "<S> synchronization of the cells in this state is provided by the alternating current ( [ i1 ] ) , flowing through the joint transverse connection . </S>",
    "<S> it is obvious , that such a state will be non - radiating . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , our findings justify earlier results on missing phase locking in the absence of external flux , which within our framework can be explained by the marginal stability observed in ( [ ljapunov ] ) for @xmath35 .    </S>",
    "<S> all results described in this paper are in complete agreement with corresponding numerical simulations performed in parallel . </S>",
    "<S> these simulations show , that the observed anti - phase locking is not bounded to the case of small inductances treated analytically here , but is a general feature of this type of array . </S>",
    "<S> if this remains true for larger arrays , which is under investigation now , this might well explain the low radiation output obtained with two - dimensional arrays up to now . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , investigations are on the way on the interplay with an external shunt current . </S>"
