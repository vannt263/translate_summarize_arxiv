    "standard model ( sm ) is a framework that describes our present understanding of fundamental constituents of matter and their interactions .",
    "the sm predictions are found to be well compatible with the experimental data up to the scale a few tev . while already the information which have come out of the lhc and tevatron experiments show consistency with the sm expectations with good precisions , the lhc future runs provide the possibility to achieve more precise determination of the sm particle properties .",
    "although no significant indication for new physics beyond the sm has been found up to now , more precise measurements of sm predictions can reveal tracks of the effects of new physics beyond the sm .",
    "a systematic and powerful way to parametrize the new physics effects is to utilize the effective lagrangian approach which is a model independent tenchique in the probe of new physics effects . in this approach ,",
    "the effective lagrangian follows the same symmetries as the sm and is constructed from the existing sm fields .",
    "the leading terms in @xmath5 are the sm terms and the effects of new physics is parametrized by the coefficients of higher dimension operators .",
    "the effective lagrangian for exploring the new interactions has been provided in @xcite .",
    "the lowest order couplings between gluon and a quark are dimension four and five operators with the following form : @xmath6q,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath7 denotes the gluon field , @xmath8 and @xmath9 are corresponding to chromomagnetic ( cmdm ) and chromoelectric ( cedm ) dipole moments of a quark .",
    "it should be noted that within the sm these couplings are zero at tree level and are induced at loop level .",
    "the chromoelectric and chromomagnetic dipole moments @xmath1 and @xmath2 can be considerable since they appear as dimension five operators and are only suppressed by one power of @xmath10 ( a new physics scale ) . in the denominator",
    "the mass factors are taken conventionally to be the quark mass @xmath11 to express these terms as quark dipole moments .",
    "the effective lagrangian @xmath5 is valid for all quark flavors within the vast range of quarks masses .",
    "there is much interest to measure cedm since a nonzero value of cedm indicates a new source of cp violation . in the sm ,",
    "the amount of quarks chromoelectric moment ( cedm ) are very small .",
    "for example , the cedm of the heaviest quark i.e. top quark is at the order of @xmath12 @xmath13 cm @xcite .",
    "several extensions of the sm such as minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) , gut theories , two higgs doublet model , higgs triplet model , left - right symmetric model and extra dimensions can generate sizeable ( chromo ) electric and ( chromo ) magnetic dipole moments @xcite .    so far , there are several studies on constrainig the top quark cedm and cmdm in the litrature using different methods . in @xcite , we have used single top in @xmath14 channel to probe the dipole moments . in @xcite , the total and the differential cross sections of top pair production at the lhc and tevatron have been used to constrain the dipole moments .    in hadron colliders , direct photon production ( @xmath15 ) provides very useful information to search for new physics beyond the sm as well as increasing our knowledge of sm .",
    "for example , within the sm the total and differential @xmath16 cross sections are used to understand the proton parton distribution functions ( pdfs ) and even are used for testing the perturbative qcd @xcite . from the experimental point of view @xmath16 events are clean and are well measured with the electromagnetic calorimeters which are used in improving photon energy resolution .",
    "more importantly , @xmath16 is the final state of many new physics signatures such as quantum black holes ( qbhs ) @xcite , excited quarks @xcite , quirks @xcite and regge excitations of string theory @xcite .",
    "indeed , this is not the complete list of new physics models that can be explored with photons at hadron colliders however this shows the ability of photon final state which covers a broad range of theoretical models beyond the sm .",
    "the results of the experimental searches based on @xmath16 final state at the lhc and tevatron can be found in @xcite .    in @xcite ,",
    "the authors have studied the influence of anomalous cmdm ( @xmath1 ) and cedm @xmath17 of light quarks on the direct photon production at the tevatron .",
    "it has been shown that the @xmath16 rate is sensitive to anomalous interactions of quarks to gluons in particular the differential cross section @xmath18 .",
    "the transverse momentum spectrum has been found to be sensitive to cedm and cmdm .",
    "nonzero values of cedm or cmdm enhances the cross section in the photon high transverse momentum region .",
    "the upper bound of 0.0027 has been set on @xmath1 using 0.1 fb@xmath19 of cdf and d0 data .    in this paper , we show that the presence of anomalous cedm or cmdm of quarks increases the rate of photon production in the tail of @xmath16 invariant mass distribution at the lhc . then using the recent @xmath16 spectrum measurement at the center - of - mass energy of 8 tev with 19.7 fb@xmath19 of data , upper bounds are set on cedm and cmdm at @xmath20 confidence level . in limit",
    "setting process , a special attention is paid to the uncertainties .",
    "we calculate the uncertainty originating from variation of renormalization / factorization scales and the uncertainty coming from the limited knowledge of proton parton density functions ( pdfs ) as functions of the @xmath16 invariant mass .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section 2 is dedicated to theoretical calculations of the cross section of @xmath16 .",
    "section 3 describes the sensitivity estimate using the measured mass spectrum of photon - jet and presents the results .",
    "the results are compared with the ones obtained with the previous works and the future expected bounds .",
    "finally , section 4 concludes the paper .",
    "in this section we present the theoretical calculation of the @xmath16 production cross section at the lhc in the presence of chromoelectric and chromomagnetic dipole moments of the quarks . the main contribution to @xmath21 final state in proton - proton collisions",
    "comes when a hadronic jet and a photon is produced in a hard scattering .",
    "this can be achieved by the compton scattering of the quark gluon @xmath22 and quark - antiquark annihilation @xmath23 at leading order . in fig.[feynman ] , the representative feynman diagrams for production of @xmath16 are depicted .",
    "as mentioned previously , the effective interaction of @xmath24 which is absent in the sm appears in the effective lagrangian to ensure the gauge invariant @xcite .",
    "this new four - point interaction does not affect the @xmath16 production .     at leading order in proton - proton collisions at the lhc.,width=377,height=264 ]    based on the effective lagrangian introduced in eq.[eff ] ,",
    "the new feynman rule describing the interaction of a quark with gluon has the following form : @xmath25 q_i\\ ; g^{a}_\\mu \\;,\\ ] ] where @xmath26 and @xmath27 are the quark spinors and @xmath28 is the four - momentum of the gluon .",
    "it is notable that in general the anomalous couplings could be dependent on the gluon momentum transfer .",
    "however , the transfer momentum is much smaller than the new physics scale therefore the dependency is neglected .",
    "the color and spin averaged amplitude for @xmath29 is found as : @xmath30\\ ] ] where @xmath31 are the mandelstam variables defined as @xmath32 and @xmath33 is the electric charge of the quark @xmath34 in units of the proton charge .",
    "the color and spin averaged amplitude for @xmath35 has the following form : @xmath36 \\;.\\ ] ] all calculations are consistent with @xcite .",
    "now , the hadronic cross section is obtained by convoluting the parton level cross section with the proton parton density functions : @xmath37 where @xmath38 denotes the parton distribution functions ( pdfs ) .",
    "we use an almost recently released ct10 @xcite set as for pdfs to calculate the cross section . in this analysis ,",
    "the nominal renormalization and factorization scales have been set to the photon transverse momentum @xmath39 .",
    "it should be mentioned here that there are higher order processes contributing to the total cross section like @xmath40 .",
    "the theoretical prediction for the higher order corrections leads to a k - factor of 1.3 @xcite .",
    "this is applied to include the next - to - leading order effects for @xmath16 cross section .",
    "we emphsize here that in reality k - factor varies in different bins of the photon - jet invariant mass and is not fixed . in @xcite ,",
    "the authors have calculated k - factor as a function of photon @xmath41 for tevatron and for the lhc at the center - of - mass energy of 14 tev . since , the k - factor as a function of @xmath42 at the center - of - mass energy of 8 tev is not available we use the fixed value similar to other analyzes @xcite .",
    "the dependence of the cross section to @xmath1 and @xmath2 is similar as the amplitudes of two subprocesses are proportional to @xmath43 .",
    "therefore , the effects because of nonzero cedm is quite similar to nonzero cmdm in the total cross section .",
    "if the @xmath16 total cross section will be measured at the lhc8 ( lhc14 ) compatible with the sm prediction with a relative uncertainty of @xmath44 , an upper bound of @xmath45 ( @xmath46 ) on @xmath1 or @xmath2 will be obtained . however , in the next section we will show that the @xmath16 mass spectrum ( @xmath47 ) is more sensitive to cedm and cmdm and gives stringent limits .",
    "in this section , we concentrate on the measured @xmath16 mass spectrum to probe the chromoelectric and chromomagnetic dipole moments of the quarks . in @xcite , it has been shown that the prompt photon transverse momentum spectrum is sensitive to cedm and cmdm in proton - antiproton collisions at the tevatron . then using the cdf and d0 data ,",
    "any value of @xmath1 or @xmath2 above 0.0027 has been excluded .",
    "recently , the cms experiment has measured the @xmath16 mass spectrum in proton - proton collisions at the center - of - mass energy of 8 tev with an integrated luminosity of 19.7 fb@xmath19 of data @xcite .",
    "then the invariant mass spectrum has been used to look for signature of new physics ( excited quarks ) after implementing the fiducial requirements on both photon and jet .",
    "the mass spectrum is well fitted to a parameterization which describes the sm prediction and no significant excess over the sm expectation has been observed . in fig.[mass ] , the measured and sm expected distributions of the invariant mass of @xmath16 is shown after applying similar kinematic requirements as the cms experiment .",
    "the transverse momenta of photon and jet are required to be greater than 170 gev .",
    "photon is restricted to be in the pseudorapidity range of @xmath48 and jet is required to be in @xmath49 .",
    "the angular separation of jet and photon is required to be larger than 1.5 while the differences of pseudorapidities are required to be less than 2.0 .",
    "the effects of the presence of @xmath1 or @xmath2 is also shown in the plot .",
    "as it can be seen , the photon - jet mass spectrum is affected by the presence of @xmath1 or @xmath2 .",
    "nonzero values of @xmath1 or @xmath2 leads to a significant increase in the cross section in particular in the high mass region . in this analysis ,",
    "all quark flavors except for top quark are included in the calculations .",
    "we have assumed that the cedm and cmdm of these quarks are the same .     at the lhc with the center - of - mass energy of 8 tev .",
    "the spectrum is weighted to the integrated luminosity of 19.7 fb@xmath19 .",
    "the expectation of the new effective lagrangian for two values of @xmath1 is also presented .",
    ", width=453,height=302 ]    now , in order to constrain the quark cedm and cmdm , we combine the information of all bins of photon - jet mass spectrum as shown in fig.[mass ] into a global @xmath50 fit .",
    "the @xmath50 is defined as : @xmath51 where the sum is over the bins of photon - jet invariant mass , @xmath52 is the number of expected events in a given theory , defined by the values of @xmath1 and @xmath2 in each mass bin , and @xmath53 is the observed number of events in each bin . the uncertainty of the expectation in each bin is denoted by @xmath54 that covers both theoretical and experimental uncertainties .",
    "we have included 40 bins of the photon - jet invariant mass in @xmath50 . in order to have a realistic estimation of the upper limits on the anomalous couplings @xmath1 and @xmath2 all sources of uncertaities",
    "must be taken into account . in the denominator of @xmath50",
    ", @xmath54 contains all the uncertainties .",
    "there are several sources of uncertainties : statistical , systematic and theoretical uncertainties .",
    "the main sources of theoretical uncertainties are the uncertainty due to variation of factorization / renormalization scales , the uncertainty originating from our limited knowledge of parton distribution functions , and the uncertainty on the value of strong coupling constant @xmath55 . to estimate the uncertainty from variation of factorization / renormalization scales ,",
    "the scales are varied by a factor of 0.5 and 2 .",
    "the aboslute value of the resulting differences with the nominal scale are shown in fig.[pdf ] ( left ) . according to fig.[pdf ] , the uncertainty increases with the photon - jet invariant mass . at the invariant mass around 3 tev , the uncertainty varies between @xmath56 . in each bin",
    ", we take the average of uncertainty from @xmath57 and @xmath58 variations . the uncertainty originating from the choice of parton distribution functions",
    "is calculated in bins of photon - jet invariant mass according to the pdf4lhc recommendations @xcite .",
    "the results are shown in the right side of fig.[pdf ] .",
    "the uncertainty varies from @xmath59 to @xmath60 when the photon - jet invariant mass varies from 600 gev to 3000 gev . for the sake of considering the uncertainty on the value of strong coupling constant @xmath55 , we vary the value of @xmath55 around the nominal value @xmath61 by @xmath62 .",
    "the small dependence of strong coupling constant on @xmath42 is neglected .",
    "there are several sources of instrumental uncertainties coming from jet energy and photon energy resolutions .",
    "conservatively , an overall value of @xmath44 in each bin of invariant mass is considered .",
    "all uncertainties are considered as quadratic sum of each uncertainty in each bin of the photon - jet invariant mass : @xmath63 .",
    "now , we set upper limits on @xmath1 or @xmath2 at @xmath20 confidence level .",
    "similar to @xcite , the results are also presented in terms of @xmath64 . including only statistical uncertainties , the upper limit of @xmath65",
    "is obtained .",
    "this upper limits gets looser and reaches to @xmath66 after considering all systematic and theoretical uncertainties .",
    "this is an improvement on the previous direct limits on cedm or cmdm ( @xmath67 ) with two order of magnitudes .",
    "we have put @xmath68 and obtained upper limit on @xmath1 .",
    "since the cross section is proportional to @xmath69 , the same upper bound is obtained on @xmath2 . in table",
    "[ tab ] , the results are presented in terms of @xmath64 as well as @xmath1 .",

    "the analysis of @xcite is based on the effect of cedm and cmdm on the photon transverse momentum .",
    "we have shown that the photon - jet invariant mass distribution in proton - proton collisions at the lhc receives significant contributions from the quarks chromoelectric ( @xmath1 ) and chromomagnetic ( @xmath2 ) dipole moments in particular at large values of @xmath0jet invariant mass .",
