    "the most convincing evidence for a phase transition in thermal yang - mills theories is provided by direct lattice simulation of the partition function , @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the inverse temperature . over the years the lattice data for @xmath0 theory , the purely gluonic sector of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) , has become incresingly accurate , with various systematic errors brought under control @xcite .",
    "figure ( 1 ) shows the normalized free - energy density , @xmath4 , of @xmath0 gauge theory taken from the first of ref.@xcite .",
    "plots such as this have supported a picture of a low - temperature phase of glueballs melting above some critical temperature to produce a deconfined phase of weakly interacting gluons : as the gluons are liberated the number of degrees of freedom increases causing the free - energy density to rise , while asymptotic freedom guarantees the gluons are weakly interacting at sufficiently high temperature .",
    "though the numerical data for qcd is less accurate , due to technical difficulties in simulating fermions , the accumulated data continues to support a phase transition .",
    "it is generally believed that this is a transition from a low - temperature hadronic phase to a high - temperature phase of quarks and gluons .",
    "this `` quark - gluon plasma '' is the new phase of matter which experiments at brookhaven and cern hope to detect in the near future .",
    "for the most part of this paper the focus will be on pure @xmath0 theory , since the accurate lattice data allows a direct comparison with theory . referring to fig.(1 ) , there is one feature which is ignored by some , commented on by many and which has bothered a few . while there is little doubt that at infinite temperature a description in terms of gluons is tenable , this is less clear at temperatures a few times the critical temperature , @xmath5 .",
    "for example , at @xmath6 , the curve lies @xmath7 below that of an ideal gas of gluons .",
    "what is the origin of this large deviation ? is it due to ( i ) perturbative corrections to the ideal gas value , ( ii ) non - perturbative effects in the plasma , ( iii ) an equally important combination of ( i ) and ( ii ) or , ( iv ) is this an irrelevant question arising from an improper insistence of describing the high - temperature phase in terms of weakly coupled quasi - particles ?",
    "several viewpoints have been expressed in the literature .",
    "some believe that the deviation is mainly a non - perturbative correction to a gas of weakly coupled gluons and parametrize it in terms of a phenomenological `` bag constant '' .",
    "others have attempted a phenomenological description of the high - temperature phase in terms of generalized quasi - particles . for a discussion and detailed references to these phenomenological approaches",
    "see , for example , @xcite . on the other hand , a few have suggested that the best consistent description of the high - temperature phase might be in terms of novel structures @xcite .    in order to help discern among the various possibilities ,",
    "this paper will focus on estimating the total perturbative contribution to the free - energy .",
    "it is important to first agree on some terminology so as to avoid confusion due to an overuse of some phrases in the literature .",
    "the partition function depends on the yang - mills coupling @xmath8 , and has a natural representation as an euclidean path - integral @xcite @xmath9 where @xmath10 collectively denotes the gauge and ghost fields , and @xmath11 the gauge - fixed lagrangian density of @xmath0 gauge theory .",
    "an expansion of this path - integral , and hence the free - energy density , around @xmath12 leads to the usual feynman perturbation theory and contributions of the form @xmath13 , with infrared effects occasionally generating logarithms multiplying the power terms , @xmath14 .",
    "these terms will be called perturbative . what is invisible in a diagramatic expansion about @xmath12 are terms like @xmath15 , associated for example with instantons @xcite",
    ". such terms , which are exponentially suppressed as @xmath16 , will be called non - perturbative",
    ".    note that at non - zero temperature , odd powers of the coupling , such as @xmath17 , appear @xcite .",
    "these are perfectly natural and represent collective effects in the plasma .",
    "though they sample interesting long - distance physics , mathematically they fall into our definition of perturbative corrections .",
    "similarly , linde @xcite had shown that at order @xmath18 the free energy receives contributions from an infinite number of topologically distinct feynman diagrams . though the calculation of that contribution is difficult , it is possible in principle @xcite , and anyway does not qualify as a non - perturbative contribution according to the definition above .    following the heroic work of arnold and zhai , a completely analytical calculation of the free - energy of thermal gauge theory to order @xmath19 has been obtained @xcite . for @xmath0 gauge theory the result",
    "can be summarized as follows , @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the contribution of non - interacting gluons , @xmath22 , and @xmath23 is the renormalization scale in the @xmath24 scheme .",
    "unfortunately ( [ ym ] ) is an oscillatory , non - convergent , series even for @xmath25 as small as @xmath26 , which is close to the value of physical interest .",
    "a plot of ( [ ym ] ) at different orders , at the scale @xmath27 is shown in fig.(2 ) .",
    "the poor convergence of ( [ ym ] ) does not allow a direct comparison of the perturbative results with lattice data .",
    "furthermore , the result ( [ ym ] ) is actually strongly dependent on the arbitrary value of @xmath23 .",
    "inspired by the relative success of pade resummation in other areas of physics , hatsuda @xcite and kastening @xcite studied the pade improvement of the divergent series ( [ ym ] ) .",
    "their conclusion was that the convergence could be improved , and the dependence on the scale @xmath23 reduced .",
    "however they did not attempt a direct comparison of their improved results with the lattice data , though hatsuda did conclude that for the case of four fermion flavours , the deviation of the fifth - order pade improved perturbative results from the ideal gas value was less than @xmath28 .",
    "not all seem to agree that a resummation of perturbative results as in @xcite sheds sufficient light on the lattice data .",
    "for example , andersen , _ et.al .",
    "_ @xcite and blaizot , _ et.al .",
    "_ @xcite have abandoned the expansion of the free - energy in terms of any formal parameter , but use instead gauge - invariance as the main guiding principle to sum select classes of diagrams .",
    "their low order results seem to be close to the lattice data , but unfortunately because of the complexity of the calculations and the absence of an expansion parameter , it is not at all obvious what the magnitude of higher order corrections is .",
    "a completely different approach has been taken by kajantie , _",
    "et.al_. in @xcite an attempt has been made to numerically estimate the net contribution of long - distance effects , summarized in a dimensionally reduced effective theory , to the free - energy density . as will be discussed later",
    ", the calculation of @xcite probably contains some of the non - perturbative effects defined above but might miss out on some others .",
    "this author believes that the declared demise of information content in perturbative results such as ( [ ym ] ) is premature . in ref.@xcite",
    "a resummation scheme was introduced to obtain an estimate of the total perturbative contribution to the free - energy density of @xmath0 theory .",
    "the methodology of ref.@xcite has been further developed and applied to other problems in @xcite . in secs.(2 - 5 ) , an explicit and improved discussion of the results in @xcite is given , leading to the conclusion that the _ total _ perturbative contribution to the free - energy density lies significantly above the full lattice data . in sec.(6 ) i discuss the consequent magnitude of non - perturbative contributions , and speculate on their possible origin .",
    "sec.(7 ) contains an analysis of the perturbative free - energy of generalized qcd , with @xmath29 fermions , and a brief comparison with the available lattice data which is less precise .",
    "@xmath1 gauge theory is discussed in sec.(8 ) , and an apparently universal relation noted .",
    "sec.(9 ) considers quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) and some speculations about its high - temperature phase . a summary and the conclusion is in sec.(9 ) .",
    "the truncated perturbative expansion of the normalized free - energy density can be written as @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the coupling constant , and where following @xcite , possible logarithms of the coupling constant are absorbed into the coefficients @xmath32 .",
    "the poor convergence of ( [ ser ] ) is obviously due to the large coefficients at high order .",
    "indeed such divergence of perturbative expansions is generic in quantum field theory and one expects the coefficients @xmath32 to grow as @xmath33 for large @xmath34 @xcite .",
    "this leads to the introduction of the borel transform @xmath35 which has better convergence properties than ( [ ser ] ) .",
    "the series ( [ ser ] ) may then be recovered using the borel integral @xmath36 the logic of borel resummation is to define the total sum @xmath37 of the perturbation expansion as the @xmath38 limit of ( [ lap ] ) .",
    "this of course requires knowledge of @xmath39 and the existence of the borel integral .",
    "lacking knowledge of the exact @xmath40 , one therefore attempts to reconstruct an approximation to @xmath41 by replacing the partial series @xmath42 in ( [ lap ] ) by a possible analytical continuation thereof . a simple and popular method to achieve",
    "this is to use pade approximants , leading therefore to a borel - pade resummation of the series ( [ ser ] ) .",
    "this method will be briefly discussed in sec.(5 ) . here",
    "instead i will proceed as suggested by loeffel @xcite and change variables in ( [ lap ] ) through a conformal map . for a positive parameter @xmath43 ,",
    "define @xmath44 which maps the complex z - plane ( borel plane ) to a unit circle in the @xmath45-plane .",
    "the inverse of ( [ con ] ) is given by    @xmath46    the idea @xcite is to rewrite ( [ lap ] ) in terms of the variable @xmath45 .",
    "therefore , using ( [ inv ] ) , @xmath47 is expanded to order @xmath48 in @xmath45 and substituted into ( [ borel],[lap ] ) .",
    "the result is @xmath49 where @xmath50 is given by ( [ con ] ) .",
    "equation ( [ rser ] ) represents a highly nontrivial resummation of the original series ( [ ser ] ) @xcite . in the pioneering application of the borel - conformal - map technique in condensed matter physics by le - guillou and zinn - justin @xcite ,",
    "the paramter @xmath43 was a fixed constant which determined the precise location of the instanton singularity at @xmath51 .",
    "in some more recent qcd applications @xcite , the fixed constant @xmath43 determines the ultraviolet renormalon singularity closest to the origin in the borel plane @xcite .    the novelty introduced in ref.@xcite and futher developed in @xcite was to consider @xmath43 as a variational parameter determined according to the condition @xmath52 where @xmath53 is a convenient reference value . for the problem at hand , because @xmath54 is negative , the solutions @xmath55 to ( [ ext ] ) will be postions of minima @xcite .",
    "denote the value of ( [ rser ] ) at @xmath56 by @xmath57 .",
    "notice that although @xmath55 is determined at the reference value @xmath53 , @xmath57 is defined for all @xmath58 .",
    "the reason why this is sufficient has been explained in @xcite and will be discussed further in the next section .",
    "it must be stressed that , in general ( see @xcite ) , the variational parameter @xmath55 is not related to possible singularities of @xmath40 .",
    "rather , it is determined according to the extremum condition ( [ ext ] ) .",
    "thus the presentation here is a slight departure from that in @xcite and represents the developments in ref.@xcite .",
    "sufficient information is now available to construct the resummed approximants @xmath59 from @xmath60 up to @xmath61 in the next section .",
    "the approximant @xmath62 of course does not exist since @xmath63 , while @xmath64 can not be constructed because no solution exists to equations such as ( [ ext ] ) at the first nontrivial order .",
    "for @xmath65 , the solutions @xmath55 will be positions of global ( local ) minima if the sign of @xmath66 is positive ( negative ) @xcite .",
    "in order to make contact with lattice data which show a temperature dependent curve , one must use in ( [ ser ] ) a temperature dependent coupling . let us begin by using the one - loop running coupling defined by @xcite , @xmath67 where @xmath68 , @xmath69 and @xmath70 , with @xmath5 the critical temperature which separates the low and high temperature phases @xcite .",
    "fixing first the reference values @xmath71 , which fixes the reference value of @xmath72 , the results of ( [ ext ] ) are : @xmath73 .",
    "the curves for @xmath57 are shown in fig.(3a ) at the renormalization scale @xmath74 .",
    "notice the behaviour @xmath75 and how these all lie significantly above the lattice curve in fig.(1 ) .",
    "the results do depend on the renormalization scale , denoted here by the dimensionless parameter @xmath76 .",
    "it has been suggested @xcite that a suitable choice for such a parameter is @xmath77 , corresponding to @xmath78 .",
    "certainly this is the natural energy range for the high - temperature phase .",
    "figure ( 3b ) shows the mild dependence of @xmath79 on the renormalization scale .",
    "the results above were obtained by solving ( [ ext ] ) at the point @xmath80 .",
    "now consider changing the reference values to @xmath81 , that is , a more central value for the temperature .",
    "the solutions are : @xmath82",
    ". these values are hardly different from those above .",
    "this is firstly due to the fact that ( [ rser ] ) is a much slower varying function of the coupling than the original divergent series .",
    "furthermore , for the present problem , the coupling itself varies slower than logarithmically with @xmath76 and @xmath83 ( the @xmath76 and @xmath83 dependence of the coefficients @xmath84 and @xmath85 is also only logarithmic ) .",
    "the curves for the re - optimized @xmath59 are essentially identical to those shown in fig.(3a , b ) , the difference being only at the fifth decimal point .",
    "for example , the value of @xmath79 in fig.(3a ) at @xmath86 is @xmath87 , while that for @xmath79 optimized at @xmath88 ( and hence evaluated at p(5)=13.4 ) , is @xmath89 at @xmath86 .",
    "this confirms the assertion in @xcite that the results are quite insensitive to the exact reference values chosen to solve ( [ ext ] ) .",
    "we now proceed to test the sensitivity of the results to the approximation used for the running coupling ( [ oneloop ] ) .",
    "the approximate two - loop running coupling is given by @xcite @xmath90 with the symbols having the same meaning as before . in fig.(4 ) , the one - loop running coupling ( [ oneloop ] ) and the approximate two - loop running coupling ( [ twoloop ] ) are plotted at @xmath74 to show their difference . at @xmath86 , the value for the approximate two - loop coupling is about @xmath91 lower than the one - loop result .",
    "nevertheless , because of the above - mentioned property of the resummed series , we shall see that the final results to do not shift dramatically . using ( [ twoloop ] ) , the solution of ( [ ext ] ) at the reference point @xmath92 are : @xmath93 .",
    "the corresponding curves shown in fig.(5a ) have moved up slightly compared to those in fig.(3a ) .",
    "the `` two - loop '' value of @xmath94 should be compared to the `` one - loop '' value @xmath95 obtained above .",
    "the mild renormalization scale dependence of the new @xmath79 is shown in fig.(5b ) .    in summary , it has been demonstrated that the resummed approximants @xmath96 all lie significantly above the lattice data and satisfy the monotonicity condition @xmath75 .",
    "the result is insensitive to the reference value used to solve ( [ ext ] ) , for the range of interest @xmath97 . the result is also insensitive to the approximation used for the running coupling constant and in fact better approximations for the coupling seem to move the values of @xmath59 further away from the lattice data . finally it should be noted that the values @xmath59 also appear to converge as @xmath48 increases .",
    "the only way to force the values of @xmath59 down closer to the lattice data is to choose very low values for the renormalization scale , @xmath98 .",
    "of course this is not only unnatural but increases the effective value of the coupling contant beyond what one would believe is physically reasonable for a perturbative treatment .",
    "that is by making an artificially low choice for the renormalization scale , one can not escape the conclusion stated in the abstract of large non - perturbative corrections !",
    "due to technical complications the sixth order contribution , @xmath99 , to the free - energy density has not been calculated although an algorithm for it exists @xcite .",
    "there is a misconception that because that contribution is due to an infinite number of topologically distinct diagrams , its value must be very large .",
    "a counter - example is provided by the magnetic screening mass @xcite , which suffers from the same disease but whose approximate calculations in the literature show it to be of ordinary magnitude @xcite .",
    "having said that , let us see what is the worst that can happen .",
    "it has been suggested @xcite that pade approximants can be used to estimate the next term of a truncated perturbation series .",
    "that is , after approximating the truncated series by the ratio of two polynomials , the pade approximant is re - expanded as a power series to estimate the next term in the series .",
    "well , why not also use borel - pade approximants for the same purpose ? using the fifth order result ( [ ym ] ) together with the two - loop running coupling ( [ twoloop ] ) , and choosing the central values @xmath100 , all fifth order pade and borel - pade approximants were constructed and then re - expanded to give an estimate of the coefficient @xmath101 .",
    "the largest value obtained was @xmath102 and the smallest @xmath103 .",
    "note that the fifth order coefficient at @xmath74 is @xmath104 , so the estimated magnitude of @xmath101 is about @xmath105 times larger .",
    "since the coupling @xmath58 is about @xmath26 at @xmath106 , the total value of the sixth order contribution to ( [ ym ] ) is therefore estimated to be almost @xmath107 times in magnitude compared to the fifth order contribution .",
    "these are big numbers and should be expected to cause some damage .",
    "using ( [ rser ] ) with @xmath108 , the two - loop coupling ( [ twoloop ] ) , and solving ( [ ext ] ) at the reference point @xmath81 gives @xmath109 and @xmath110 .",
    "repeating for @xmath111 gives @xmath112 and @xmath113 .",
    "notice the negligible change in the value of @xmath114 even when wildly differing values have been used for @xmath101 .",
    "those values should be compared with the fifth order approximant of fig.(3a ) , which gives @xmath115 .",
    "the large estimated sixth order corrections to the divergent perturbation expansion ( [ ser ] ) cause a change of only @xmath116 to the values of the resummed series , and more importantly the shift is upwards , @xmath117 , preserving the lower order monotonicity , regardless of the sign of @xmath101 .",
    "kajantie , _ et.al . _ @xcite have suggested that the sixth order contribution , @xmath118 be of order @xmath119 . for a coupling @xmath120 ,",
    "this translates into the astronomical value @xmath121 for @xmath101 . solving ( [ ext ] ) at @xmath122=3 gives @xmath123 and @xmath124 for the positive @xmath101 , and @xmath125 and @xmath113 for the negative @xmath101 . despite the anomalously large value of the sixth order contribution proposed in @xcite ,",
    "the conclusion here is still @xmath117 , and an increment of only @xmath116 .    to highlight the above result in a more dramatic way ,",
    "suppose the sixth order coefficient vanishes , @xmath126 .",
    "then because of the non - trivial way the resummation is done in ( [ rser ] ) , the solution to ( [ ext ] ) for @xmath127 will still be different from that of @xmath61 .",
    "at @xmath128 i find @xmath112 and then @xmath113 at four decimal places , which is almost identical to the values obtained above for various large values of @xmath101 .",
    "this sounds incredible but is actually not once one remembers that large corrections to the divergent series ( [ ser ] ) do not translate into large corrections to the resummed series ( [ rser ] ) .",
    "in fact those large values are suppressed in various ways .",
    "firstly , in the re - organization of the series in ( [ rser ] ) , less weight is given to higher order corrections .",
    "secondly , the variational procedure chooses values of @xmath55 which in this example increase with @xmath48 , and so suppress further the value of @xmath59 .",
    "more understanding of the above results can be obtained through a large @xmath48 analysis carried out for the general eqs.([rser],[ext ] ) in @xcite .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that if @xmath55 increases for the first few values of @xmath48 , then that trend will continue .",
    "let @xmath129 . in the large @xmath48 and large @xmath55 limit one can show that @xcite @xmath130 one consequence of this is that @xmath131 and @xmath132 as @xmath38 .",
    "this is indeed observed for the present problem already at low @xmath48 .",
    "numerically , ( [ cn ] ) too is not a bad approximation at small @xmath48 .",
    "in fact using the values found for @xmath55 in the last section , one has @xmath133 . with this as input for @xmath134 , ( [ cn ] ) gives the estimate @xmath135 , to be compared with the actual value @xmath136 .",
    "next using @xmath137 as the exact input , ( [ cn ] ) gives @xmath138 and thus an estimate of @xmath139 . on the other hand , using @xmath140 , as determined by various estimates above , gives @xmath141 and then through ( [ cn ] ) the estimate @xmath142 and hence @xmath143 .",
    "the eq.([cn ] ) was derived in @xcite for the case @xmath144 . for",
    "the present case where @xmath63 one will actually obtain the slightly more accurate equation @xmath145 but in the large @xmath48 limit where @xmath146 this is clearly equivalent to ( [ cn ] ) .",
    "note that the recursion relations ( [ cn ] , [ cnn ] ) make no explicit reference to the values of the @xmath32 which in the derivation in @xcite were assumed to be generic , that is , diverging at most factorially with @xmath147 .",
    "indeed that fact that various different assumptions about the value of @xmath101 earlier in this section led to essentially the same value for @xmath140 supports the @xmath32 independence of ( [ cn ] ) already at @xmath148 .    from the general analysis in @xcite ,",
    "one also deduces that for large @xmath48 and large @xmath55 , the monotonicity @xmath149 is guaranteed by the fact @xmath150 , and that @xmath151 as @xmath38 . since the explicit @xmath152 calculations and the estimated @xmath127 result already support @xmath153 and large values of @xmath55 at low @xmath48",
    ", this suggests that the continued monotonicity and rapid convergence of the @xmath59 is assured by the large @xmath48 analysis .",
    "from the explicit low @xmath48 calculations , and the large @xmath48 analysis , one concludes that for @xmath154 , @xmath155 for all @xmath48 , and furthermore , the difference @xmath156 decreases as @xmath48 increases , showing a rapid convergnce of the approximants .",
    "however , in general , it is not quite correct to say that the approximants converge to the total sum of the series @xcite . for each @xmath48 ,",
    "let @xmath157 be the value of @xmath43 that is optimal , that is , it is the value which when used in ( [ rser ] ) gives the best estimate of @xmath41 , the total sum of the series .",
    "define , @xmath158 .",
    "then for those @xmath55 which are positions of global minima one has by definition , @xmath159 it is @xmath160 which presumably converges to @xmath41 as @xmath161 .",
    "( this implicitly assumes that the sub - sequence of global minima is infinite : that is , given any positive integer @xmath162 , there is some @xmath163 for which @xmath32 is positive . )",
    "hence if one accepts the two assumptions above , then combining ( [ ineq ] ) with ( [ star ] ) , @xmath164 for all @xmath65 , and one may conclude that the @xmath59 are lower bounds to the sum of the full perturbation series .",
    "in particular that conclusion implies that the @xmath61 curve in fig.(5a ) is a lower bound on the _ total perturbative _ contribution to the free - energy density of hot @xmath0 theory .",
    "the statement has three qualifications .",
    "firstly , it involves the technical assumptions mentioned above . secondly ,",
    "as discussed before , better approximations to the running coupling can move the bounds , but it was seen that a @xmath165 improvement in the coupling shifted the bound _",
    "upwards _ by @xmath166 .",
    "thirdly , the bounds shift by @xmath167 when the renormalization scale is varied by a factor of two from its central value @xmath168 .",
    "thus it might be more appropriate to call the bounds as `` plausible soft lower bounds '' with an uncertainty depicted in fig.(5b ) .",
    "given that the lower bound obtained above involves some unproved technical assumptions , it is useful to compare the above results with those obtained using different resummation schemes for the divergent series ( [ ser ] ) .",
    "i briefly state here the main results obtained using a borel - pade resummation of ( [ ser ] ) , with the two - loop approximation for the coupling ( [ twoloop ] ) and the central value @xmath74 . the approximants will be denoted as @xmath169 $ ] , referring of course to the particular pade approximant used for the partial borel series ( [ borel ] ) constructed from ( [ ser ] ) .",
    "the only approximants which did not develop poles and which gave a resummed value below one in the temperature range @xmath170 were @xmath171 , \\ [ 2,1]$ ] and @xmath172 $ ] .",
    "these are displayed in fig.(6 ) .",
    "the @xmath173 $ ] and @xmath174 $ ] approximants did not develop poles but gave a value above one .",
    "if the approximants which developed a pole are defined through a principal value prescription , then the lowest value was given by @xmath175 $ ] : @xmath176 as @xmath83 increased from @xmath177 .",
    "the @xmath178 $ ] and @xmath179 $ ] approximants gave values above @xmath180 in the range of interest while @xmath181 $ ] gave a value above one .",
    "thus in the borel - pade method , the minimum estimate for the fifth order resummed series is given by the principal value regulated @xmath175 $ ] .",
    "the highest values were all above one .",
    "if one keeps only the fifth order estimates below one ( thus giving a very conservative lower value ) , then the average of the @xmath175 $ ] and @xmath179 $ ] is greater than @xmath182 for the entire range @xmath170 . at @xmath86",
    "the estimates are @xmath183 .",
    "of course including also the values above one would push this average higher . clearly the borel - pade estimates are comparable to the bounds obtained using the resummation technique of sec.(2 ) and should reassure some readers about the novel resummation used here .    for completeness , i mention an alternative way of thinking about divergent series such as ( [ ser ] ) . for qcd at zero temperature ,",
    "a paradox is that one - loop results give remarkable agreement with experimental data even when the energy scale is relatively low . as the running coupling is then large it is not obvious why higher - loop perturbative corrections are suppressed .",
    "it has been suggested @xcite that the explanation might lie in the probabale asymptotic nature of the qcd perturbation series .",
    "recall that in an asymptotic series the best estimate of the full sum , _ at a given value of the coupling _",
    ", is obtained when only an optimal number of terms is kept and the rest discarded ( even if they are large ) . thus if one knew the general behaviour , at least at large order , of the series ( [ ser ] ) and assumed that it was asymptotic , then one could have obtained a reasonable estimate of the full sum by simply adding the optimal first few terms .",
    "what has been done in the previous sections , and this is what various resummation schemes try to do , is to instead sum up the whole series to get an even better estimate of the total perturbation series ( and this has the greater advantage of giving a good result for a large range of couplings ) . also note that thinking of ( [ ser ] ) as an asymptotic series does not say anything about explicit non - perturbative corrections @xcite .",
    "the total perturbative contribution to the free - energy density of @xmath0 gauge theory has been argued to be close to , or above , the @xmath61 curve in fig.(5a ) .",
    "a residual uncertainty that could lower the curve of fig.(5a ) is the exact value of the renormalization scale . for a natural range of parameters , the lower curve in fig.(5b )",
    "is the result . on the other hand",
    "the full result as given by lattice simulations is shown in fig.(1 ) .",
    "lattice errors have been stated to be under @xmath184 @xcite . taken together , the conclusion appears inescapable : _ even at temperatures a few times above the transition temperature , there are large negative non - perturbative contributions to the free - energy density_. for example , at @xmath185 , the lattice results for the normalised free - energy density are @xmath186 while the lower bound on the perturbative contribution is @xmath187 , implying a minimum non - perturbative correction of @xmath188 ( and as high as @xmath165 ) .    thus an answer has been given to the questions raised in the introduction .",
    "the deviation of the lattice data from the ideal gas value is apparently caused mainly by non - perturbative corrections , with perturbative corrections accounting for a much smaller amount . at @xmath189",
    "the relative contributions are @xmath190 and @xmath191 .",
    "i speculate now on possible sources of the non - perturbative corrections .",
    "firstly there are the familiar instantons , already present in the classical action , and which contribute terms of the order @xmath192 .",
    "secondly there are the magnetic monopoles .",
    "there is by now overwhelming evidence that confinement at zero temperature is caused by the thooft - mandelstam mechanism of condensing monopoles ( the dual superconducting vacuum ) .",
    "thus it is possible that the monopole condensate has not completely melted above the critical temperature .",
    "note that since the classical theory does not support finite energy monopoles , these must be of quantum origin , and so their contribution might be larger than those of the instantons .",
    "in fact contributions which are exponentially small but much larger than those of the instantons are suggested by the borel resummation itself .",
    "it is known that yang - mills theories are not borel summable @xcite .",
    "that is , the function @xmath40 has singularities for positive @xmath193 , making the borel integral ill - defined .",
    "one can nevertheless define the sum of the perturbation series using the borel integral if a prescription is used to handle the singularities .",
    "it is generally believed that the prescription dependent ambiguity disappears when explicit non - perturbative contributions are taken into account for the physical quantity in question .",
    "indeed the nature of singularity itself suggests the form for the non - perturbative contribution .",
    "if there is a pole at @xmath194 , then the non - perturbative contribution will be of the form @xmath195 , which is larger than the instanton contribution for small @xmath58 .",
    "an explicit mathematical model which illustrates the interplay between borel non - summability and non - perturbative contributions has been given in @xcite .",
    "notice that the non - perturbative corrections suggested by the borel method at non - zero temperature are very different from those at zero temperature . in the latter case",
    "the expansion parameter is @xmath196 and so the contribution is @xmath197 , which translates into a power suppressed contribution @xmath198 when @xmath196 is replaced by the running coupling @xmath199 . in cases where the physical quantity can also be analysed using the operator - product expansion ( ope ) , these power suppressed contributions to perturbative results correspond in the ope picture to vacuum condensates @xcite .    at nonzero temperature ,",
    "since the natural expansion parameter is @xmath200 , one does not get a simple power suppression from @xmath201 .",
    "nevertheless , the analogy with zero - temperature results suggests that such contributions might be due to some condensates .",
    "thus the conventional condensates discussed for example in @xcite are plausibly part of the non - perturbative contributions .",
    "the form however suggests even more novel condensates . these might be , for example , those of detar @xcite or pisarski @xcite .",
    "it is worth noting an explicit instance of a theory displaying exponentially small non - perturbative effects which are larger than those due to standard solitons . in fundamental string theory where the coupling is @xmath8",
    ", there are the usual solitons but there are also novel `` d - instantons '' which give a larger contribution @xmath202 @xcite .",
    "i also mention in passing the recurrent and intriguing relationship between gauge theories and strings @xcite which leads one to wonder whether that is a possible route to understanding the non - perturbative structure of hot gauge theories .    using the @xmath61 curve of fig.(5a ) as a reasonable estimate of the full perturbative result , and assuming a nonperturbative component of the form @xmath203 as suggested by the borel method",
    ", one can determine the constants @xmath204 and @xmath205 by comparing the lattice data of fig.(1 ) with the perturbative result .",
    "in @xcite it was shown that , @xmath206 where @xmath207 represents the lattice data for the free - energy , and @xmath208 the resummed perturbative result , both normalized with respect to the ideal gas value , and @xmath209 is given by ( [ twoloop ] ) at @xmath74 .",
    "eq.([bbag ] ) is a phenomenological equation of state for the free - energy which generalises the usual discussions in the literature where the second term on the right - hand - side of ( [ bbag ] ) is called a bag constant. in this case the ` constant ' is really temperature dependent and represents a non - perturbative contribution to the free - energy that vanishes at infinite temperature .",
    "it is important to note that the non - perturbative contribution is negative , since the perturbative result is above the full lattice data , and thus consistent with the usual interpretation in the literature .",
    "so far the discussion has implicitly assumed an additive picture of perturbative and non - perturbative contributions , with both components clearly distinguished .",
    "it might be that in reality the best description of the high - temperature phase is in terms of completely novel structures @xcite . in that case",
    "a forced expansion of those alternatives about @xmath210 must give something like ( [ bbag ] ) and the subsequent distinction between perturbative and non - perturbative contributions .",
    "the mathematical toy model of @xcite illustrates this .    within the framework of this paper",
    ", one can distinguish three versions of the popular concept of `` quasi - particle '' .",
    "firstly there are the `` perturbative quasi - particles '' which are deformations of the gluon formed by a particular reorganisation of the perturbative feynman diagram expansion .",
    "the results above suggest that if all the contributions of such quasi - particles to the free - energy are added up , the net result will lie above the lattice data , and only truly non - perturbative contributions , as defined in sec.(1 ) , may give the final agreement . secondly there are the `` nonperturbative quasi - particles '' , which are excitations about the nontrivial thermal vacuum that includes condensates , and so forth .",
    "currently there is not sufficient control over the theory to construct these objects .",
    "finally there are the `` phenomenological quasiparticles '' which simply aim to give numerical agreement with the lattice data within a simple _ ansatz_. the ultimate justification for these phenomological constructs must surely come from the `` nonperturbative quasiparticles '' .",
    "in this section lower bounds ( within assumptions similar to those made previously ) are obtained for the perturbative free - energy density of hot @xmath0 coupled to @xmath29 flavours of fundamental fermions .",
    "as the essential features are very similar to the pure gauge case , the discussion here will be brief . the fifth order perturbative results in the @xmath24 scheme can be read off from the landmark papers @xcite .",
    "the approximate two - loop coupling that is used here is given by @xmath211 with @xmath212 following @xcite i also assume a relative @xmath29 independence of @xmath213 , and thus use for it the same expression as used in ( [ oneloop ] ) .",
    "the extremization condition ( [ ext ] ) is solved at the reference point @xmath81 for @xmath214 and @xmath215 .",
    "the results obtained are all extremely similar : in each case the convergence of the @xmath59 is monotonic and rapid as in the pure glue case in fig(5a ) .",
    "for this reason only the @xmath61 curves are displayed in fig.(7 ) for the various number of flavours . for comparison the pure glue result ( @xmath216 ) is also included .",
    "( each curve has been normalized with respect to the ideal gas value for that number of flavours . )    the @xmath61 curves in fig.(7 ) can be taken as plausible lower bounds , or estimates , to the total perturbative free energy density of qcd with @xmath29 fundamental fermions .",
    "lattice results for qcd contain large systematic errors compared to those for @xmath0 and so a precise comaprison is not possible .",
    "after making some assumptions about the size of the systematic errors , the authors in ref.@xcite determine that for @xmath217 the free - energy density lies about @xmath218 below the ideal gas limit .",
    "this is similar to the case of pure @xmath0 . comparing this lattice estimate with the estimate on the perturbative result in fig.(7 )",
    "one is again led to suggest that there are large non - perturbative corrections to the naive picture of a weakly interacting quark - gluon plasma .    of course , given the physical relevance of qcd , it would be preferable to have more precise numbers from the lattice , and especially for other values of @xmath29 .",
    "however it seems that a non - perturbative component of @xmath219 at temperatures a few times @xmath220 is likely to be generic .    when the draft of this paper was complete , i came across @xcite which gives for @xmath221 a @xmath222 , a factor of two lower than that for the pure gauge theory .",
    "this has the consequence that @xmath76 in @xmath213 should be replaced by about @xmath223 .",
    "however as the reader can surmise by now , this has hardly any impact on the results above , for this is equivalent to shifting the renormalization scale @xmath76 by a factor of two , which as we have seen causes only a @xmath224 shift of the curves . in any case",
    "this serves to remind that the lattice results for @xmath29 are in a state of flux .",
    "define @xmath226 then the free - energy density of pure @xmath1 theory up to fifth order @xcite is given by the expression ( [ ym ] ) , with @xmath227 replaced everywhere ( including inside the logs ) by @xmath228 .",
    "thus there is no explicit @xmath229 dependence of the free - energy density when written in terms of @xmath228 .    to examine",
    "the @xmath229 dependence of the new coupling ( [ universe ] ) , consider the approximate two - loop running coupling given by @xmath230 with @xmath231 and with @xmath232 the @xmath1 gauge theory scale parameter in the @xmath24 scheme . in @xmath233 ,",
    "the constant @xmath234 is @xmath235 . comparing the various equations",
    ", one comes to the remarkable conclusion that the new running coupling @xmath236 will be independent of @xmath229 _ if _ the @xmath24 scale parameter @xmath237 is itself independent of @xmath229 when expressed in terms of some physical length scale . by comparing some data for @xmath238",
    ", teper @xcite has concluded that this is indeed the case .",
    "therefore , accepting the result of @xcite , one deduces that the @xmath61 curve in fig.(5a ) is a plausible lower bound , or estimate , to the total perturbative free energy density of hot @xmath1 theory when the x - axis is interpreted as @xmath239 instead of @xmath240 .",
    "this is then a universal relation ( at least for low @xmath229 ) , and one suspects that the corresponding full lattice results might also obey a universal curve , thus leading to the guess that the non - perturbative component of an @xmath1 plasma is about @xmath241 for temperatures a few times above the critical temperature .",
    "though the fine structure constant @xmath25 of qed is small at everyday energies , it is interesting to consider super - high temperatures where it will be large .",
    "the free - energy density of massless qed at temperature ( @xmath242 ) , has been computed up to order @xmath243 in refs.@xcite . denoting as usual @xmath244",
    ", the normalised free - energy density at the @xmath24 renormalisation scale @xmath245 , is given by @xcite @xmath246 where @xmath247 is the free - energy density of a non - interacting plasma of electrons , positrons and photons .",
    "figure ( 8a ) shows the plot of ( [ free ] ) at different orders .",
    "the series diverges at large coupling ( super - high temperatures ) , exhibiting a behaviour similar to that of yang - mills theory at low - temperatures .",
    "the convergence at large coupling can be improved by using the resummation technique ( [ rser]-[ext ] ) . using the coefficients from ( [ free ] ) ,",
    "the solutions of ( [ ext ] ) at the reference value @xmath248 are ( minima ) : @xmath249 .    the resummed series , with its much improved convergence , is shown in fig.(8b ) . the @xmath61 curve can be taken as a lower bound to the full perturbative result . if one assumes that the potential non - perturbative contributions lower the perturbative result , as happens in qcd , or are very small in magnitude , then one may conclude from fig.(8b ) that super - hot qed undergoes a phase transition",
    "this speculated high - temperaure phase of qed might then be analogous to the low - temperature phase of qcd with various bound states . or",
    ", it might resemble the alternative picture of low - energy qcd : that of flux - tubes @xcite .",
    "it is unfortunate that no lattice or other non - perturbative information is currently available about the high - temperature phase of qed .",
    "the phrase non - perturbative is used often and loosely with regard to field theories at non - zero temperature .",
    "this has caused a great deal of semantic confusion and misunderstanding .",
    "for the purpose of uncovering the cause of the deviation of the result in fig.(1 ) from the ideal gas value , it has been proposed to term perturbative all power like ( modulo logarithms ) contributions to the free - energy density .",
    "such perturbative contributions follow from the usual feynman diagram expansion of the parition function around zero coupling .    for @xmath0 gauge theory a plausible lower bound",
    "was obtained on the totality of such perturbative contributions to the free - energy density .",
    "the derivation of that lower bound using the variational conformal map involved some technical assumptions , and so one may instead wish to consider it only as an estimate of the total perturbative contribution .",
    "the estimate is comparable to that obtained using pade or borel - pade resummation methods and lies significantly higher than the full lattice result , thus suggesting that large and truly non - perturbative corrections exist . as discussed in sec.(6 ) , these non - perturbative corrections might include the usual instantons , magnetic monopoles , the usual condensates , and perhaps also more novel condensates and extended structures as suggested by the borel form @xmath201 of the non - perturbative contributions .",
    "as to which of these possibilities dominates is an interesting question left for future work .",
    "the equation of state for hot @xmath0 can be summarized by the phenomenological relation @xcite @xmath250 where @xmath207 represents the lattice data for the free - energy , and @xmath208 the resummed perturbative result , both normalized with respect to the ideal gas value , and where @xmath58 is the temperature dependent coupling ( [ twoloop ] ) at @xmath74 .",
    "there is a slight ambiguity in the estimate of the magnitude of non - perturbative corrections coming from the residual renormalization scale ambiguity of the resummed perturbative results . for the natural range @xmath78 ,",
    "the ambiguity is less than one percent .",
    "such an ambiguity between the perturbative and non - perturbative components is understandable , as only the full physical quantity can be demanded to be scale independent , and not separately its perturbative and non - perturbative components , though the latter simplifying assumption is often made .",
    "by choosing an anomalously low value for the scale @xmath23 one can fit the purely perturbative results to the lattice data but at the price of a very large effective coupling constant , and thus an unsuppresed contribution from common place objects like instantons .",
    "therefore this route does not offer an escape from the conclusion of large non - perturbative corrections .",
    "the results of this paper do not imply that the description of the free - energy density must be as in ( [ bbag2 ] ) .",
    "rather , completely novel descriptions in terms of various extended structures are possible @xcite , but in a forced expansion of those alternative descriptions about @xmath12 , one must recover something like ( [ bbag ] ) . on the other hand , the results here _",
    "do _ imply that an accounting of the lattice free - energy density in terms of a subset of feynman diagrams of the perturbative thermal vacuum might miss some essential physics .",
    "being restricted to an analysis of the free - energy density , the results here of course do not imply that every observable must have large non - perturbative contributions , but it is likely that this is true for most of the bulk thermodynamic quantities .",
    "an analysis was also carried out for generalized qcd with @xmath29 quarks .",
    "currently the lattice data is only approximate and so the conclusions are less definitive . however accepting the estimates in @xcite ,",
    "the conclusion is the same as before : there appear to be large non - perturbative corrections to the free - energy density of hot @xmath0 gauge theory coupled to @xmath29 quarks .",
    "thus in particular , `` quark - gluon plasma '' seems to be an incomplete description even at temperatures several times above the transition temperature .",
    "a simple relation was noted for the perturbative free - energy density of @xmath1 gauge theory in sec.(8 ) .",
    "that result , combined with the results for generalised qcd in sec.(7 ) , and the available lattice data , leads one to a universality _ conjecture _ : for the high - temperature ( @xmath251 ) phase of @xmath1 gauge theory coupled to @xmath29 fundamental quarks , and for all moderate values of @xmath229 and @xmath29 , at most @xmath252 of the deviation of the free - energy density from the ideal gas value is due to perturbative effects while non - perturbative effects contribute a larger @xmath241 .",
    "finally , the methods of this paper might be of some use for the study of supersymmetric theories at non - zero temperature , a topic of interest in recent developments @xcite .",
