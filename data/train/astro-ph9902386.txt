    "the crab pulsar was discovered in 1968 by the detection of its extremely strong individual pulses ( @xcite ) .",
    "such pulses , which are 100 s of times stronger than the average , are not seen in most pulsars .",
    "the properties of these giant pulses have been explored for many years ( _ e.g. _ , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "giant pulses in the crab pulsar occur at all radio frequencies , but only at the rotational phase of the main pulse and interpulse components .",
    "these two components have counterpart nonthermal emission at high frequencies  from the infrared to gamma ray energies  and may be associated with the outer voltage gaps in the pulsar magnetosphere ( @xcite ) .",
    "giant pulses are not seen in the radio precursor nor at the phases of the high radio frequency components recently described by moffett and hankins ( 1996 ) .",
    "the radio precursor is identified as being more typical of the emission from a conventional pulsar and is believed to originate at , and be aligned with , the magnetic pole .",
    "et al .  _",
    "( 1995 ) found that two separate distributions were required to describe the fluctuations of single pulse energies ) .",
    "the integral of emission over a pulse component in the latter case would be its flux , while in the former and conventional case one quantifies the integrated component emission in units of energy ( jy - s ) .",
    "] for the crab pulsar main pulse and interpulse components at 0.8ghz .",
    "about 2.5% of the pulses lie in the giant pulse distribution with a power law slope extending to high values and a low energy cutoff of 20 times the average of all pulse energies .",
    "the distinct distributions suggest different emission mechanisms for the giant and weak pulses and possibly different emission locations within the magnetosphere .",
    "however , the lack of an offset in the timing residuals between giant pulses and the average pulse profile ( @xcite ; for opposing evidence see @xcite ) suggests that the emission region is the same .",
    "the frequency of occurrence of pulses ( @xmath4 ) with energy greater than 20 times the average increases with frequency , from @xmath5 at 0.146ghz ( @xcite ) , to 0.025 at 0.8ghz ( @xcite ) .",
    "the contribution of the giant pulses to the average energy of all pulses also increases with radio frequency , although not as quickly .",
    "the probability distribution of the giant pulse energies can be written as @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the frequency of occurrence of the giant pulses , and @xmath8 is the minimum energy .",
    "correspondingly the probability density function is @xmath9 and the corresponding mean giant pulse energy averaged over all pulses is @xmath10 .",
    "the probability distribution @xmath11 has a slope @xmath12 at 0.8ghz ( @xcite ) , and @xmath13 with significant errors at 0.146ghz ( @xcite ) . at 1.4ghz and 0.43ghz the overall slope is roughly consistent with these , but is not the same for all energies ( @xcite ; @xcite ) . using the scaling law @xmath14 at all radio frequencies below 0.8ghz , we find that the contribution of giant pulses with energy more than 20 times the average of all pulses , @xmath15 , is 89% of the average energy at 0.8ghz ( @xcite ) , 9% at 0.43ghz ( @xcite ) , and only about 1% at 0.146ghz ( @xcite ) . at 1.4ghz",
    ", a similarly large fraction of the energy comes from the approximately 2% of pulses with greater than 20 times the average energy , although a single slope @xmath16 does not accurately describe the distribution .",
    "there is no evidence of increased flux density in pulses near the giant pulses ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , nor is there any correlation between giant pulses .",
    "we note that many pulsars do show pulse to pulse correlation indicating a memory process with a duration of many rotational periods .",
    "the timescale of giant pulses is , in contrast , less than a single period .",
    "in addition , the time separation distribution for giant pulses is consistent with poisson process ( @xcite ) .",
    "despite all these studies , the emission bandwidth of the giant pulses has been poorly determined .",
    "et al .  _",
    "( 1969 ) found that 50% of giant pulses were seen simultaneously at 0.074ghz and 0.111ghz .",
    "goldstein & meisel ( 1969 ) also found that some but not all pulses were correlated between 0.112ghz and 0.170ghz .",
    "et al .  _",
    "( 1971 ) noted that there was no evidence that the largest pulses at 0.16ghz and 0.43ghz were correlated .",
    "heiles & rankin ( 1971 ) observed giant pulses simultaneously at 0.318ghz and 0.111ghz , for a bandwidth spread of about 3:1 .",
    "they found that pulses classified as giant at one frequency were stronger than the average at the other , but not usually classified as giant .",
    "much more recently , moffett ( 1997 ) reported that fully 90% of the giant pulses detected at 4.9ghz were also detected at 1.4ghz , implying an emission bandwidth of 3.5ghz at high radio frequencies . in this paper",
    ", we report on giant pulses observed simultaneously at 1.4ghz and 0.6ghz to explore the correlation in this intermediate range of frequencies .",
    "section [ sec : gpobs ] describes the observations , while analysis of the simultaneous pulses lies in section [ sec : gpanal ] .",
    "the data shown here were recorded on 1996 may 21 at ut @xmath17 ( 1.4/0.6 ghz ) and 1996 oct 12 at ut @xmath18 ( 4.9/1.4 ghz ) .",
    "we also refer to observations at 1.4-ghz earlier in 1996 and in 1997 november .",
    "the 1.4-ghz and 4.9-ghz data were taken at the nrao very large array ( vla ) . for the simultaneous 1.4/0.6-ghz observations all 27 vla antennas were phased to create the equivalent sensitivity of a 130-m antenna , while the 0.6-ghz data were taken using a 25-m telescope at the nrao green bank , wv , site . for the simultaneous 4.9/1.4-ghz observations",
    "the vla was split into two equal subarrays .",
    "the peculiar phases of each antenna at the vla were determined by observing a standard point - source calibrator .",
    "these phases were then applied to the antennas to synthesize a pencil beam pointed at the crab pulsar , which essentially resolves out the bright crab nebula and vastly improves the signal to noise ratio compared to a single - dish antenna .",
    "the received voltages from each antenna are summed to form orthogonally circularly polarized 50-mhz bandwidth signals centered at precisely 4.8851ghz or 1.4351ghz .",
    "the signals are then detected and summed with a 100-@xmath3s time constant .",
    "the detector rms noise power was determined using an rms to dc converter .",
    "a detector threshold was set at either 5 or 6 times the running average of this rms noise level .",
    "pulses that exceeded this threshold generated a trigger pulse that was sent to the data recorder , and were then saved to disk and archived to tape using the full 50-mhz bandwidth . in an off - line computer the data",
    "were coherently dedispersed using the method developed by hankins ( 1971 ) and described by hankins and rickett ( 1975 ) .",
    "although the ultimate time resolution of the dedispersed data is 10ns , for the analyses described here the data were smoothed to 0.51.0@xmath3s after software detection .",
    "the two linearly polarized signals centered at exactly 0.610ghz were converted to 90mhz and 110mhz center frequencies , respectively .",
    "the two intermediate frequency signals were then summed and transmitted on a single fiber optic link from the 25-m telescope to the green bank ",
    "berkeley pulsar processor ( gbpp ) which was located at the 140-ft telescope .",
    "the gbpp converted the signals to baseband , split these into 32 0.5-mhz channels , and dedispersed the pulsar signal in each channel by ( de-)convolution in the time domain .",
    "the dispersion delay across the 16-mhz bandwidth of the gbpp at 0.6ghz is about 33ms , or one pulse period for the dispersion measure of the crab pulsar ( @xmath19 pc@xmath20 ) .",
    "full stokes information for 982 samples across the pulsar period was recorded with an accurate utc start time for each pulse .",
    "the 25-m telescope also monitors the crab pulsar daily with 0.327-ghz observations which are valuable for their sensitivity to scatter broadening by intervening plasma .",
    "the 1.4/0.6-ghz part of this experiment utilized the difference in pulse arrival time between the two frequencies due to interstellar dispersion to provide the time interval needed to communicate the trigger information between the sites . at the vla , the same trigger pulse that was sent to the data recorder",
    "was also sent , as an interrupt , to the sun workstation used for experiment control and recording .",
    "the program that received the interrupt had a socket link open over the internet to a slave program running on another sun workstation in green bank , and communicated the 1.4356-ghz arrival time of the pulse to green bank .",
    "we arranged for the gbpp to begin taking data just before the giant pulse reached the upper edge of the 0.6-ghz band , in order to obtain data for the same main pulse across the entire band . the dispersion time delay between 1.4351ghz and 0.618ghz ( the top of our 0.6-ghz band ) allowed a half second ( 0.503s ) to arrange this .",
    "the sun workstations at the two sites were synchronized to the local versions of utc which were derived from accurate atomic clocks using the xntp protocol .",
    "although both remote sites had 56-kb links to the internet , the typical internet transfer time delay was 200ms during our observation .",
    "the program running in green bank received the trigger message with its vla time stamp , calculated the transit time of the trigger , and compared that to the dispersion delay difference of 0.503s .",
    "in addition to this delay , the program included other factors such as the difference in pulse arrival due to the separation between observing sites on the earth and the latency in the gbpp hardware , both of which were of order 13ms .",
    "if sufficient time remained , the program waited until the appropriate time and issued a trigger to the gbpp _ via _ the sun parallel port to take data for the next pulse period .",
    "owing to the slow rate of data transfer from the gbpp , it could only accept such a command approximately every 12 s. some vla - initiated triggers were therefore missed by the gbpp .",
    "for the 4.9/1.4-ghz measurements the recording system was triggered by a 4.9-ghz pulse , and then automatically triggered again after the appropriate dispersion delay to record the 1.4-ghz signals .",
    "the stokes parameters for the high - time resolution data from the vla were formed from the dedispersed voltages .",
    "the necessary 90@xmath21 phase shift was obtained using an finite impulse response approximation to the hilbert transform and was applied to the right circular polarization signal before forming the stokes parameters .",
    "no instrumental polarization corrections were made other than bandpass leveling and gain matching .",
    "concurrent calibration ( moffett 1997 ) has shown that the polarization cross - coupling is less than 10% for the vla phase array .",
    "the polarization error then is comparable with the radiometer uncertainty imposed by the limited number of degrees of freedom in the data ( @xmath22 .",
    "the polarization profiles at 0.6ghz were calibrated using factors derived from pulsed noise observations .",
    "the receiver introduces a relative phase between the two linear polarizations which couples the stokes parameters @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "this phase was determined and removed using nearby observations of the vela pulsar , and comparison to a template polarization profile .",
    "no attempt has been made to remove coupling between the two polarizations .",
    "the error in polarization due to improper calibration is estimated at 10% .",
    "for each pulse , the relative dispersion between the 32 channels was removed , and the resultant data were summed over channels , after first removing the effects of the pulsar s rotation measure ( @xmath25 rad  m@xmath26 ) across the band .",
    "the unknown faraday rotation from the ionosphere causes negligible rotation of 1 to 10 degrees across the total band .",
    "of the 85 trigger events initiated at the vla a total of 77 events reached green bank within the required time , and were accepted by the gbpp .",
    "the xntp protocol requires 24 hours to stabilize to the accuracy required by our experiment .",
    "the minimum time stabilization period was not available for the sun at the vla .",
    "consequently the vla clock used to identify the time at which the trigger was sent drifted by a small amount .",
    "we are currently certain that the received trigger events allowed capture of the correct period in the gbpp for 42 pulses .",
    "the arrival times and pulse energy amplitudes were determined at both frequencies for each of these pulses .",
    "the 0.6-ghz arrival times were determined by cross - correlation with a model template , which consisted of a single - sided exponential with a decay time scale of 3 time bins , about 100@xmath3s .",
    "owing to complex structure discussed below , the 1.4-ghz pulse arrival times were obtained by computing the location of the centroid of the pulses .",
    "pulse amplitudes in units of jy - s were determined by removing an `` off - pulse '' baseline , and then summing the flux in the time bins that comprise the `` on - pulse '' window .",
    "the measurement uncertainty of these amplitudes was determined from the `` off - pulse '' noise distribution .",
    "we definitely detected 29 of the 42 correctly timed pulses at both radio frequencies .",
    "these detections correspond to a 0.6-ghz pulse energy threshold of about 4.5 times the typical measurement uncertainty , or 0.075 jy - s using 0.14 k jy@xmath27 for the 25-m telescope .",
    "this gain factor was determined using on and off measurements of the crab nebula ( which is 1208 jy at 0.6ghz ) , and has an estimated uncertainty of 50% .",
    "we conclude that about 70% of the pulses are detected at both frequencies .",
    "this statistic is used to discuss the spectral index distribution below .",
    "the data for a single giant pulse at 1.4ghz and 0.6ghz are displayed in figures [ vlabest ] and [ gbbest ] , respectively .",
    "this pulse is strongly polarized at both frequencies , although fully two thirds of the giant pulses at the lower frequency are consistent with zero polarization .",
    "the 0.6-ghz data has a low number of degrees of freedom , and so the polarization estimation uncertainty is about 5% . at 1.4ghz ,",
    "the typical polarization is about 8% although at least one pulse is 50% polarized .",
    "the position angle of the linear polarization generally varies significantly across the pulse , as is seen in figure [ vlabest ] .",
    "the arrival times for the 29 giant pulses detected at the two frequencies were separately compared to a single model for this pulsar using the tempo program developed for pulsar timing ( @xcite ) . for each radio frequency , the arrival times are well - represented by the model , leaving timing residuals of order @xmath28s .",
    "the residuals are comparable to the pulse width of the average profile during periods of low scattering , which is @xmath29s ( fwhm ) at 0.6ghz , and @xmath30s at 1.4ghz .",
    "these widths were estimated using gbpp data obtained with the 25-m and 140-ft telescopes , respectively .",
    "the timing residuals for 1.4ghz and 0.6ghz are plotted against one another in the top panel of figure [ resids ] , which shows that they are highly correlated .",
    "the solid line has a slope of one and goes through the origin . in order for the points to fall along this line",
    ", the 1.049-ms digital latency of the gbpp and the 235.42-@xmath3s latency of the vla samplers and delay lines were removed , and a further fit for dispersion measure was done in tempo .",
    "the derived dm is 56.830 pc @xmath20 although systematic errors may remain in the arrival times from the two sites .",
    "the bottom panel displays the same 1.4-ghz residuals with the solid line removed .",
    "eilek ( 1996 ) has shown that the dispersion law in the polar cap is proportional to @xmath31 , as opposed to @xmath32 for the cold interstellar medium ( ism ) .",
    "no systematic trends remain in the data in the lower panel of figure [ resids ] , indicating that systematic variations with pulse phase are less than @xmath33s between our two bands .",
    "this places limits on the differential effects of propagation through the magnetosphere .",
    "geometrically , emission in the two bands must originate within 0.16@xmath21 of rotational phase , or a range of 4.5 km in altitude .",
    "it would have been possible to have correlated emission from subpulses at different pulse longitudes at each frequency . in this case , the radiation at the two frequencies need not have come from the same radiating unit of charges .",
    "the observed rms jitter in arrival time at either frequency is @xmath34100@xmath3s , so the fact that the difference between the residuals has such a small dispersion indicates that the emission must be from the same radiating unit at both frequencies .",
    "this means that at least 70% of the giant pulses must have a bandwidth of _ at least _",
    "0.8ghz at 1ghz .",
    "the emission is clearly broadband for these cases .",
    "the giant pulses at 0.6ghz all have profiles that display a fast rise followed by an exponential decay , similar to the profile shown in figure [ gbbest ] .",
    "the exponential decay time scale is @xmath35s .",
    "monitoring of the exponential broadening of the average pulse profile at 0.3ghz using the 25-m telescope ( @xcite ) provides a contemporaneous decay time scale of @xmath36ms .",
    "the 0.3-ghz and 0.6-ghz pulse broadening time scales are consistent with the @xmath37 dependence expected from scattering by an intervening , turbulent plasma screen . at the time of these observations",
    "the crab was undergoing a period of unusually large scattering .",
    "the contemporaneous value of @xmath38 may be compared to 0.28ms at an earlier epoch .",
    "enhanced scattering of the crab pulsar radiation also occurred in 1975 ( @xcite ; @xcite ) . a likely site of the perturbed plasma that causes the enhanced pulse broadening is in the interface between the synchrotron nebula and the supernova ejecta ( @xcite ) .",
    "this region is proposed because such enhanced scattering events are not seen for any other pulsar .",
    "furthermore , this location is known to contain dense thermal plasma with structure on a variety of length scales .",
    "the transverse velocity of the line of sight with respect to the interface material is sufficient to bring occasional regions which produce strong perturbations into view .",
    "the fast rise of the 0.6-ghz giant pulses indicates that any intrinsic time scale of the pulse is unresolved , .5ex10@xmath3s .",
    "the giant pulses at 1.4ghz have a wide variety of shapes .",
    "figures [ pulse69 ] and [ pulse56 ] display two further single pulse profiles .",
    "the first pulse is extremely narrow and is dominated by a single component , while the second has several components contributing to the emission .",
    "the darker solid line is a fit to the data where the flux model @xmath39 consists of up to six components and is of the form @xmath40 these components rise to their peak in a time @xmath41 , fall by @xmath42 in a further @xmath43 , and have a pulse energy amplitude of @xmath44 . at 1.4ghz , the majority of giant pulse components are well represented by this model , with widths @xmath41 ranging from 1.2@xmath3s to 10@xmath3s .",
    "components with widely varying decay time scales may be superposed within a single giant pulse , as shown in figure [ pulse56 ] .",
    "the narrow component of the giant pulse shown in figure [ pulse69 ] has a rise time of 1.2@xmath3s , and a decay time scale of 2.5@xmath3s .",
    "the weak and broad second component in figure [ pulse69 ] is clearly necessary to account for the emission on the trailing edge of the pulse , which does not follow an exponential tail .",
    "the 1.4-ghz observations raise fundamental issues about the nature of the giant pulse emission .",
    "is the multiplicity of the components and the characteristic shape of the components a result of propagation through a turbulent screen , or are these effects intrinsic to pulse formation and propagation in the pulsar magnetosphere , or is there a mixture of effects present ?",
    "two additional results from further observations at the vla and the 0.3-ghz monitoring in green bank provide important constraints to aid in answering these questions .    first , our broadening measurement of 1.3ms at 0.3ghz scales to @xmath45s at 1.4ghz using the @xmath46 dependence expected for a spectrum of turbulence filling the intervening screen .",
    "this range is consistent with the typical _ minimum _ broadening time of approximately 2.5@xmath3s that we measured for the giant pulses at 1.4ghz . during a later epoch ( 1997 nov 26 )",
    "when the scattering broadening of the average pulse at 0.3ghz had increased dramatically by a factor of about 5 , the minimum pulse widths of the 1.4-ghz giant pulses increased by a similar factor . at an earlier epoch in 1996 both the 0.3-ghz average pulse broadening and the minimum width of the 1.4-ghz giant pulses were reduced .",
    "the second observational constraint on our interpretation of the 1.4-ghz giant pulse shapes comes from consideration of the multiple component spacing .",
    "these do not scale in the same way as the component broadening . during an earlier epoch of low 0.3-ghz scattering ,",
    "the typical 1.4-ghz component spacing is similar to that for 1996 may 21 .",
    "in addition , simultaneous vla measurements of the giant pulses at 1.4ghz and 4.9ghz ( 1996 oct 12 ) show a frequency _ independence _ of the multiple component spacing ( hankins & moffett 1998 ) . at 4.9ghz",
    "the pulse components are intrinsically very short , typically 0.1 to 0.4@xmath3s wide , while the corresponding components are broadened at 1.4ghz .",
    "simultaneous 4.9-ghz and 1.4-ghz measurements of a single giant pulse are shown in figures [ 5ghz]a and [ 5ghz]b .",
    "the separation of the two main components is similar at both frequencies , in that the onsets of the pulse components ( the fiducial points in the fits discussed in section [ secshape ] ) are separated by the same amount .",
    "a similar conclusion of frequency independence of structure can be inferred from the 1.4ghz and 0.6ghz measurements of 1996 may 21 ; that is , 1.4-ghz giant pulses with multiple components have a spread of tens of microseconds , which is consistent with the limit on structure at 0.6ghz .",
    "the correlation of broadening time scales over the range from 0.3ghz to 1.4ghz provides support for diffractive scattering in the nebular material .",
    "although the simple thin screen prediction for interstellar scattering is a single sided exponential , @xmath47 , models including two widely separated screens or a single thick screen both predict pulse shapes similar to the observed @xmath48 form of the components ( @xcite ) .",
    "isaacman & rankin ( 1977 ) have derived parameters for a two screen model from studies of the average pulse profile of the crab pulsar .",
    "a scatter plot of the 1.4-ghz component energies , @xmath44 from the fitted parameters in equation [ eq : xfred_model ] , _ vs. _ component width , @xmath41 , shows that the energies are independent of the pulse width , have an average of about @xmath49jy - s , and are scattered over two orders of magnitude .",
    "this means that the peak flux is approximately inversely proportional to the width ; stronger pulses are narrower .",
    "the data from other observing sessions show that although the broadening times change , the pulse energies remain within the same range ; _ i.e. _ , when the scattering times are longer , the peak amplitudes are correspondingly smaller .",
    "this multi - epoch result supports the hypothesis that , in spite of questions about the pulse component shape and the frequency dependence of the exponential decay time scale , the shape of the components at 1.4ghz is most likely the result of scattering by the intervening medium .",
    "the wide variations in pulse broadening seen within a single pulse are , however , difficult to explain unless the scattering screen is illuminated differently by each component .",
    "while we expect variation in the pulse broadening from component to component and from pulse to pulse owing to their being instantaneous samplings of the time variable diffractive effects , why does the _ minimum _ exponential time scale of the components at 1.4ghz agree with that extrapolated from 0.3ghz ? we have considered the possibility that the components of giant pulses are intrinsically single impulsive events that are multiply refracted and/or diffracted by discrete regions of enhanced plasma density and/or turbulence , respectively .",
    "lyne & thorne ( 1975 ) invoked similar intermittency in the wave front perturbing medium to explain the irregular and rapidly varying effects of the 1974 event , and cordes , hankins & moffett ( 1998 ) have studied the effects of discrete , small scale `` screenlets '' on giant pulses .",
    "an intermittent scattering medium that multiply refracts and/or diffracts a single impulsive signal appears to solve the problem , but has serious difficulties explaining the frequency independence of the spread and multiplicity of pulse components .",
    "consider a screen at a distance @xmath50 from the pulsar and @xmath51 from the observer .",
    "diffraction leads to an expansion of the angular spectrum of the intensity by an angle @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the coherence scale for one radian of phase difference across the wavefront .",
    "an impulse which passes through this screen is broadened by the multipath diffractive time scale , @xmath54 . if the scattering material covers a transverse scale of @xmath55 centered on the geometric line of sight , then @xmath56 .",
    "a measure of the apparent angular size of the pulsar is @xmath57 .",
    "if @xmath54 is 4@xmath3s at 1ghz and the screen is located 2 pc from the pulsar , @xmath58 , @xmath59mas , @xmath60as , @xmath61 cm , and @xmath62 cm . if the diffracting material covers only a fraction of @xmath63 , then the pulse broadening time will be _ reduced _ relative to @xmath54 owing to the reduction in the multipath propagation ( @xcite ) .",
    "the observed frequency scaling between 0.3-ghz and 1.4-ghz broadening times reported above is not consistent with this result .",
    "in addition , a diffracting region not located along the line of sight will result in components disappearing from view as the frequency increases , owing to the reduced viewing zone set by @xmath63 centered on the line of sight .",
    "this is in conflict with the current observational results .",
    "refraction in an intermittent medium has similar limitations to that of diffraction .",
    "consider a uniform density , spherical plasma lens at a transverse distance @xmath64 from the line of sight with a transverse dimension significantly less than @xmath64 .",
    "the excess propagation delay from the pulsar to the observer is dominated by the geometric delay @xmath65 and is independent of frequency owing to the highly aberrant lens .",
    "while multiple lenses of this form appear to satisfy the frequency independence of giant pulse component spacings , they will _ not _ satisfy the frequency independence of the number of components and their overall distribution in longitude .",
    "more components over a wider range of longitude would be expected at lower frequencies as is the case for diffraction discussed above .",
    "we conclude that the multiplicity of components is intrinsic to the pulsar emission mechanism or to propagation effects within the pulsar magnetosphere .",
    "multiple scatterings of a single emitted pulse component can not easily explain the observed spread and multiplicity of pulse components . despite this",
    ", we favor propagation effects in the crab nebula as an explanation for the shape of the components at 1.4ghz and below .",
    "alternatively , the observed component shape may be intrinsic to the emission .",
    "each component is emitted with its own time scale , but the characteristic @xmath48 shape .",
    "components with time scales shorter than the interstellar broadening time scale are broadened by scattering in the ism .",
    "this model explains the observed correlation between the minimum time scale and the low - frequency scattering , but involves two separate explanations for the characteristic shape of the components .",
    "determining whether the long-@xmath66 end of the distribution scales with the low - frequency scattering or is independent of it would distinguish between the two possibilities .",
    "observations at multiple frequencies during times of minimal scattering at 0.3ghz are critical to further inquiry .",
    "the distribution of pulse energy amplitudes from the 1.4/0.6-ghz experiment are displayed along with the corresponding detection thresholds in figure [ gbvla ] .",
    "the 1.4-ghz amplitudes of the 13 pulses that were not detected at 0.6ghz are also shown .",
    "solid lines corresponding to spectral indices @xmath0 and @xmath1 are shown , where spectral index @xmath67 is defined by @xmath68 .",
    "the overall spectral index for the crab pulsar is @xmath69 , while the spectral index for the average main pulse , which is shown as a dotted line in figure [ gbvla ] ( @xcite ) , is @xmath2 .",
    "the pulse amplitude of the average main pulse is 5.4 @xmath70 10@xmath71 jy - s at 0.6ghz .",
    "the largest 0.6-ghz giant pulse therefore has a pulse amplitude of about 150 times the amplitude of the average pulse .",
    "the giant pulses are narrower than the average pulse , and so are even stronger relative to the average pulse within this window .",
    "et al .  _",
    "( 1995 ) concluded from their analysis of the relative contribution of giant pulses to the average as a function of frequency ( _ cf . _",
    "section [ secintro ] ) that if the emission is narrow band , the rate of giant pulses must increase with frequency , while if the emission is broadband , then the giant pulses must have flatter spectra than the weak pulses .",
    "heiles & rankin ( 1971 ) found that their measured spectral indices at low radio frequencies ranged from nearly 0 to less than @xmath2 .",
    "similarly , moffett ( 1997 ) found that between 1.4 and 4.9ghz , giant pulse spectral indices ranged from 0 to @xmath72 , with an average of about @xmath73 .",
    "these two studies corroborate lundgren s analysis .",
    "we find that at least 70% of the pulses are broadband , and so we expect that their spectral indices are , on average , flatter than the average main pulse spectral index .",
    "the average spectral index of the giant pulses in figure 7 which were detected at both frequencies is @xmath74 , which is comparable to that of the average main pulse .",
    "this estimate is biased by the fact that the pulses that were not detected at 0.6 ghz have flatter spectral indices .",
    "in addition there may be systematic errors in flux calibration that could change the average spectral index by up to @xmath75 .    the individual giant pulse spectral indices display a relatively large scatter .",
    "individual pulse spectral indices are known for two other pulsars .",
    "the distributions of spectral indices for pulsars b0329@xmath7654 and b1133@xmath7616 have a standard deviation of 0.2 , and range from -1.6 to -3.1 and -2 to 0 , respectively ( @xcite ) .",
    "one contribution to the spectral index variations is the stochastic uncertainty in the determination of the amplitudes that is introduced by the low number of degrees of freedom in narrow band observations of intrinsically short duration pulses .",
    "we estimate this uncertainty to be of order 10% ( 20% ) at 1.4 ( 0.6 ) ghz for an intrinsic pulse width of 1@xmath3s .",
    "this is not large enough to explain the scatter in the spectral indices .",
    "the scatter could also be intrinsic to the radiation emission process .",
    "the signal could consist of a randomly occurring series of nanosecond impulses whose combined power spectrum is irregular .",
    "this would cause scatter in the observed spectral indices .",
    "but with the radiation extending over 1@xmath3s or more , there are many nanosecond pulses which would smooth out this distribution .",
    "alternatively , one might expect the spectral index to vary due to properties of the emission beam : frequency dependence and orientation with respect to the observer .",
    "future observations with higher time resolution and also with many samples across the spectrum will provide critical new insight into the giant pulse emission process .",
    "we consider two general models for giant pulse emission . in the temporal model",
    "the giant pulse emission components are impulses in time ( @xmath771@xmath3s ) with angular beam widths comparable to that of the average pulse , @xmath78 . following lundgren ( 1994 )",
    ", we also consider a model in which the enhanced emission during a giant pulse results from a steady narrow beam ( @xmath771@xmath79 ) whose position wanders on time scales 300@xmath3s @xmath80 . in this case",
    "intrinsic structure within a particular giant pulse is due to structure within this narrow beam . in both models ,",
    "the average beam may be circular , as in polar cap models , or fan - shaped , as is likely if the emission comes from the outer gaps .",
    "in the angular model , the narrow beam of emission may wobble in either the @xmath81 direction ( along the trajectory of the line of sight ) , or the @xmath82 direction ( perpendicular to the trajectory of the line of sight ) .",
    "the width of the giant pulses corresponds to the size of the beam in this model , while the jitter in arrival times @xmath83 corresponds to the wobbling of the beam along @xmath81 . for giant pulses which occur a fraction @xmath84 of the time , the wobble in @xmath82 is then @xmath85 where @xmath11 is the pulse period ( following lundgren _",
    "et al .  _",
    "lundgren was able to separate the giant pulse and normal pulse distributions at 0.8ghz , and found that one of 40 pulses is giant .",
    "since the giant pulses form a separate distribution , then if they are all broadband , they will all also appear at higher radio frequencies . then at 1.4ghz or 4.9ghz , one of 40 pulses should be giant .",
    "in fact , moffett ( 1997 ) finds that one of 50 pulses at 1.4ghz has an energy greater than 20 times the average . at 4.9ghz",
    "the intrinsic width of the giant pulses is 0.1@xmath3s to 0.4@xmath3s .",
    "we find @xmath86s , so the @xmath87 to @xmath88 beam must wobble @xmath89 in @xmath81 and @xmath90 to @xmath91 in @xmath82 .",
    "this is not consistent with a narrow beam wobbling within a roughly circular average beam .",
    "radio emission from pulsars must come from a coherent emission process ( @xcite ) .",
    "the exact process is very uncertain , as is the location(s ) of the emission .",
    "it is not necessary for the giant pulse emission to originate at the same place or in the same way as the ordinary pulse emission .",
    "the broadband nature of the giant pulse emission provides the main constraint on its origin . according to melrose ( 1996 ) , broadband emission",
    "is traditionally associated with models in which the emission occurs at a pair production front in the polar cap , or by schott radiation from a corotating charge and current distribution outside the light cylinder ( _ e.g. _ , @xcite ; ardavan 1992 , 1994 ) .",
    "the emission process itself could rely on plasma instabilities ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . alternatively ,",
    "other maser processes such as linear acceleration emission ( @xcite ; @xcite ) or maser curvature emission ( @xcite , 1995 ) could produce the radiation . in any case , if the giant pulses are a temporal effect , this variability in radio emission could be the result of the statistics of a small number of coherently emitting regions which are incoherently summed , or an increase in the coherence within a single emission region .",
    "although we believe that the @xmath48 characteristic shape of the giant pulse components at 1.4ghz is most likely the effect of propagation through the crab nebula interface , the remaining questions ( _ cf .",
    "_ section [ secinterp ] ) lead to consideration of effects intrinsic to the pulsar .",
    "an asymmetric shape is not expected for a simple narrow beam with an angular wobble . in either the temporal or angular beam model ,",
    "this shape might be explained by effects that occur as the signals traverse the pulsar magnetosphere ( eilek 1998 ) .",
    "the effects of aberration are too small to produce the broadening and asymmetry seen in these pulses , if one confines the range of emission altitudes to 4.5 km , the limit obtained from the timing residual differences at the two frequencies . in the temporal model ,",
    "the asymmetric shape is consistent with any emission process which turns on with a rapid nearly linear rise , then saturates and decays . in this case",
    "one might expect the peak energy to be independent of width , whereas we have seen that it is the total pulse energy which is independent of width .",
    "if the model is truly temporal , then the angular size of the beam does not affect the observed pulse width .",
    "the radiation is beamed into a beam width @xmath92 .",
    "the beam must be wider than any given 1.4-ghz pulse component , 50@xmath3s , and therefore @xmath93.5ex100 .",
    "we can use this value of @xmath93 to estimate particle properties using a simplistic model of coherent curvature radiation .",
    "the power lost by the @xmath94 excess charged particles in the bunch will be @xmath95 where @xmath96 is the charge on an electron , @xmath93 is the relativistic factor @xmath97 , and @xmath98 is the radius of curvature of the magnetic field . we observe @xmath49 jy - s in a 50-mhz band , so @xmath99 must equal the measured luminosity , which is therefore greater than @xmath100 erg s@xmath27 , assuming a distance of 2 kpc , and a circular beam 300@xmath3s = 3@xmath21 wide",
    ". then the number of particles in the bunch must be at least @xmath101 these particles must fit within a cube with volume @xmath102 in order to maintain the observed coherence , so the number density of excess charges must be at least @xmath103@xmath20 for the parameters used above , and a wavelength of 21 cm . for comparison ,",
    "the goldreich - julian density in the observer s frame is @xmath104@xmath20 , using a surface magnetic field of @xmath105 g .",
    "the excess charge density can be further reduced if several bunches are radiating in a periodic structure .",
    "the giant pulse emission from the crab pulsar is broadband since 70% of the pulses are observed in our 1.4/0.6-ghz experiment .",
    "the strong correlation in arrival times at the two frequencies implies that the same radiating unit is operating at both frequencies .",
    "the giant pulses display a scatter in spectral index that is consistent with or flatter than the spectral index of the average main pulse component .",
    "pulsar emission models are restricted to those that can explain the broadband nature of the giant pulse radiation on intrinsic observed time scales of one to 10 microseconds .    above 1ghz a multiplicity of components",
    "is observed with frequency independent spacing and number .",
    "the 1.4/0.6-ghz data are also consistent with frequency independence . we conclude that the multiplicity is intrinsic to the pulsar emission process and not the result of multiple imaging in the intervening plasma .",
    "the exponential pulse broadening time scale of the average pulse at 0.3ghz and of the giant pulses at 0.6ghz are consistent with multipath propagation effects .",
    "the large values and rapid variations indicate a special scattering region .",
    "we identify this region with the interface between the crab synchrotron nebula and the surrounding supernova ejecta . at 1.4ghz",
    "the observed giant pulse component shapes are characterized by fast rise and exponential decay time scales that are correlated .",
    "the minimum time scale is consistent with extrapolation of the pulse broadening at lower frequencies with a filled turbulent scattering screen .",
    "the shape and the distribution of broadening at 1.4-ghz are not fully understood .",
