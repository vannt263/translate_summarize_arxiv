    "the relationship between traffic and air pollutants such as @xmath0 has been examined using many different approaches [ e.g. , @xcite ] .",
    "proximity to traffic has frequently been used as a proxy for traffic related air pollution exposure in environmental health [ @xcite ] . in such studies ,",
    "the goal is to determine whether there is a relationship between air pollution and health outcomes . when direct measurements of specific pollutant levels are not available , proximity to roadways and traffic levels are sometimes used as proxies . in general",
    ", @xmath0 levels decline with distance from a highway [ @xcite ] .",
    "while data on proximity to major roads have proven to be a cost - effective approach in epidemiological studies of traffic exposure , they do not necessarily account for traffic volume .",
    "inclusion of volume further improves the quality of traffic exposure measurement [ @xcite ] .",
    "for instance , @xcite found that including an index of traffic intensity and proximity in a model , along with an indicator of gas cooker use in the home , improved the correlation between model estimates and levels of nitrogen dioxide measured from a monitor located close to a child s home or school .",
    "other studies [ e.g. , @xcite ] also used traffic volume to improve the quality of exposure information .    one way to include traffic volume information in a model is to introduce vehicular counts within a buffer zone , which @xcite call weighted - road - density .",
    "the idea is to calculate the total ( road length @xmath1 traffic volume ) for a given circle and divide it by the area , that is , @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the length of a segment , @xmath4 the traffic volume and @xmath5 the radius of the circle .",
    "either actual traffic counts or a road classification system can be used for @xmath4 .",
    "the authors found that actual traffic counts were better at predicting @xmath0 than a simple hierarchical classification of roads .",
    "in addition , weighted road density was found to be a better predictor than proximity to a major road",
    ".    rose et  al.s ( @xcite ) method assumed that all roads within a circle had the same effect regardless of distance to the point of interest . @xcite proposed a method that made use of road density , traffic volume and distance to roads from points of interest .",
    "they were able to estimate a dispersion function for a pollutant , which improved estimates of @xmath0 over those obtained using only average daily traffic ( adt : number of vehicles / day ) on the closest highway , adt on the busiest highway within a buffer and the sum for all road segments within a buffer .",
    "the underlying framework for the methods reviewed above is land use regression which uses traffic - related variables as predictors for @xmath0 [ e.g. , @xcite ] .",
    "@xcite added a time - varying component to a model using multiple linear regression to forecast @xmath0 levels up to 8 hours in advance by using current and past 15 hours meteorology along with traffic information .",
    "further methods for assessing intraurban exposure were reviewed by @xcite : ( i ) statistical interpolation [ @xcite ] , ( ii )  line dispersion models [ @xcite ] , ( iii ) integrated emission - meteorological models [ @xcite ] , and ( iv ) hybrid models combining personal or household exposure monitoring with one of the preceding methods [ @xcite ] , or combining two or more of the preceding methods with regional monitoring [ @xcite ] .",
    "@xcite broke down the alternatives into just two categories : dispersion - based models and empirical models .",
    "as pointed out by @xcite , a disadvantage of geostatistical interpolation is the limited availability of monitoring data .",
    "this approach requires a reasonably dense network of sampling sites .",
    "government monitoring data generally come from a sparse network of stations , giving rise to systematic errors in estimates at sites far from the monitoring stations .",
    "increasing the number of monitoring sites can be helpful but costly , so it has not been used extensively .",
    "researchers often have to use pollution measurements over relatively short time periods as a substitute for the comparatively long periods covered by health histories .",
    "this poses a choice between relying on a government network that provides temporal detail for a limited number of sites or on their own more detailed spatial network , which usually covers a short period of time .    to address the limitations inherent in each source of available data ,",
    "@xcite applied a longitudinal model that established a relationship between data from us environmental protection agency ( epa ) monitoring sites with daily or finer temporal resolution and those from the study of traffic , air quality and respiratory health in children ( star ) with monthly resolution .",
    "it was assumed that the relationship at the monthly level held at the daily level , using a model in which data from epa sites were used to estimate pollution information at study sites .",
    "this model performed well as measured by @xmath6 in a simple linear model that used star site observations as the response variable and the predictions based on epa measurements as the predictor variable .",
    "the model showed that about 73% of the variability at the star sites can be explained by the predictions .",
    "this article extends and seeks to improve zhang s ( @xcite ) method by including traffic as predictors in the model .",
    "a traffic - related variable can then be used to explain the spatial variation observed in the random intercept of the longitudinal model , thus providing a practical way for estimating the temporal / spatial distribution of @xmath0 in a region .",
    "star is an epidemiological study of childhood asthma designed to investigate whether common air contaminants are related to disease severity .",
    "four monthly outdoor @xmath0 measurements were taken for each subject , with three months separating each consecutive measurement .",
    "observations used in this analysis were taken between april 25 , 2006 and march 21 , 2008 .",
    "in contrast to the star study , the epa monitoring sites provide hourly @xmath0 measurements .",
    "average daily @xmath0 was calculated from these hourly measurements .",
    "figure  [ locations ] shows the locations of four epa sites in connecticut and 316 star study sites used in this analysis .",
    "we selected randomly 266 star learning sites for model development and the remaining 50 sites were used for model validation .",
    "measurements and 316 star sites which have monthly measurements . ]",
    "inverse distance weighting ( idw ) was used to interpolate daily @xmath0 values at star sites based on daily averages at the four epa sites .",
    "let @xmath7 denote the @xmath8th @xmath0 measurement at star site @xmath9 ( between days @xmath10 to @xmath11 , say ) , and let @xmath12 denote the idw interpolated @xmath0 value at site @xmath9 on day @xmath13 , for @xmath14 , and @xmath15 .",
    "a new variable @xmath16 can be created by taking the average of @xmath12 for site @xmath9 over the same period as @xmath7 .",
    "figure  [ starepamsr ] plots @xmath7 against @xmath16 for the 316 sites in figure  [ locations ] , where weights are the reciprocal of distance .",
    "values at 316 star sites ( @xmath7 ) vs average of idw interpolated values from epa @xmath0 measurements over the same period as @xmath7 . ]      the connecticut department of transportation reports adt for all state roads on a three - year cycle .",
    "the data for 2006 were used in this analysis .",
    "figure  [ roadsadt ] shows these        road segments which have reported adt . there are 5196 road segments , with lengths ranging from 16 meters to 12,295 meters , median of 740 meters and mean of 1207 meters . the range for adt was 0 to 184,000 ( mean of 22,323 and median of 11,400 ) .",
    "three models were compared in this study .",
    "first , we considered a linear model : @xmath17 where @xmath18 denotes the @xmath9th @xmath0 measurement on the natural log scale , @xmath19 is the natural log of the average idw interpolated @xmath0 for that site over the corresponding period , @xmath20 is the traffic information ( adt ) , and @xmath21 is some random error , for @xmath22 .",
    "second , we specified a longitudinal model with random effects for sites : @xmath23 where @xmath24 denotes the @xmath8th @xmath0 measurement at star site @xmath9 on the natural log scale , @xmath25 is the corresponding average of idw interpolated @xmath0 on the natural log scale , @xmath20 is the traffic information , @xmath26 is a random intercept for site @xmath9 , and @xmath27 is some random error , for @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "the random effects @xmath30 and @xmath31 are mutually independent .",
    "a scatter plot showing this relationship for these data is shown in figure  [ star10 ] , which shows @xmath7 ( the @xmath8th @xmath0 measurement at site @xmath9 ) against @xmath16 ( average of idw interpolated daily @xmath0 values at site @xmath9 over the period corresponding to @xmath7 ) for six randomly selected sites , with lines connecting values for a site in temporal order .",
    "levels vs averages of idw interpolated @xmath0 levels for six randomly selected star sites , with lines connecting values in temporal order . ]    finally , we specified a modified longitudinal model which allowed for spatial correlation among site effects for the model in equation ( [ longequ ] ) , that is , @xmath32 . elements in the covariance matrix @xmath33 are given by @xmath34 , where @xmath35 denotes spatial distance .",
    "the random effects @xmath36 and @xmath31 s are mutually independent .",
    "we adjusted for traffic effects using the integrated exposure model proposed by @xcite which introduced covariates into the linear predictor in a regression model .",
    "the contribution of traffic was expressed as @xmath37 where @xmath38 denotes adt for point @xmath39 on a line representing a highway and @xmath40 is a dispersion function for the pollutant generated at @xmath39",
    ". we can achieve computational efficiency with little loss in accuracy by representing this contribution numerically  taking the sum of the product of adt , the segment length and the unknown dispersion function which depends on distance .",
    "@xcite discussed alternative forms of linear dispersion functions , for example , stepped , polynomial or spline . in this example",
    "we used a step function , in which we estimated a value for the level of dispersion between specified distance intervals , @xmath41 and @xmath42 : @xmath43 , where @xmath44 is the pollution effect from a unit intensity source within the interval , @xmath45 is adt , and @xmath46 is length of the segment .",
    "the linear predictor related to traffic effects can now be written as @xmath47 where @xmath48 .",
    "adt is reported in highly variable lengths , and while this approach might work well for short segments , it can become problematic for long segments , for example , if the center of one road is close to a site but most of the remaining segments are relatively far away . to mitigate this problem , we divided the segments into smaller subsegments and found that 50-meter segments provided an adequate accuracy . to show this , we tested lengths such as 10-meter , 50-meter , 100-meter and up to 5000-meter and found little difference in the resulting estimates between 10 and 50 meters .",
    "for this example , we used 50-meter .",
    "segments were divided into subsegments using a python ( http://www.python.org/ ) script which calls relevant arcgis [ @xcite ] functions .",
    "values of @xmath49 s were predetermined by our experience with earlier analysis . setting the values of @xmath49",
    "beforehand leaves the values of @xmath44 s to be estimated as regression parameters .",
    "two possible approaches for incorporating traffic effects were examined : a single - step model which sets the contribution of highway segments within 2000 meters as equal and for distances farther than 2000 meters as 0 ; and a multi - step model with steps at 400 meters , 800 meters , 1200 meters , 1600 meters and 2000 meters .",
    "while models ( [ linearequ ] ) and ( [ longequ ] ) were fitted using a frequentist approach , we obtained parameter estimates for the third model under the bayesian framework .",
    "the three models were fitted to @xmath0 levels at the 266 learning sites and the results were used to estimate levels not only at these sites but at the 50 validation sites as well . by assuming that the relationship at the monthly level also holds at the daily level , we also obtained daily estimates .",
    "one predictor variable was based on daily pollution levels obtained by interpolating with idw measurements from the four epa sites .",
    "we also included the remaining predictors representing traffic - related effects @xmath20 .",
    "once daily @xmath0 predictions at the sites were obtained , they were averaged over the same periods as the star observations .",
    "systematic departures for site estimates were evaluated using simple linear regression : @xmath50 where @xmath7 is the @xmath8th observation at star site @xmath9 , @xmath51 is the average of the estimated daily @xmath0 values at site @xmath9 over the same period as @xmath7 , and @xmath52 .",
    "in addition , we calculated the root mean square error ( rmse ) : @xmath53",
