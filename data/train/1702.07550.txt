    "the kondo effect is an intriguing subject in the condensed - matter community since it is a paradigmatic example of strong many - body physics @xcite .",
    "although this effect was firstly observed in metals with magnetic impurities , quantum dots ( qds ) offer new posibilites for the manipulation of such many - body state owing to their tunability of the relevant parameters that control the physics of the problem .",
    "since the discovery of the kondo effect in semiconductor qd systems @xcite , interest has been spurred both experimentally and theoretically during the last decades .",
    "a prototypical setup showing kondo physics consists of a qd ( an artificial quantum impurity ) connected to two reservoirs at a temperature @xmath0 which is lower than a characteristic temperature scale dubbed kondo temperature @xmath1 . at such low temperature , the electric transport becomes highly correlated and the qd magnetic moment becomes screened by the electrons in the leads .",
    "a many - body singlet between the conducting and the localized electrons forms due to antiferromagnetic correlations originated from higher order spin - flip tunneling processes . at equilibrium , these correlations generate a sharp resonance in the local density of states around the fermi energy @xmath2 whose width is of the order of @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "importantly , the kondo temperature depends highly on the system parameters , i.e. , the position of the qd level relative to the fermi energy , @xmath4 , the charging energy of the electrons inside the dot @xmath5 and the tunnel amplitude coupling to the reservoirs @xmath6 ( where @xmath7 labels the lead connected to the dot and @xmath8 the electronic wave number ) .",
    "when a voltage bias is applied between the left and right contacts , a current is driven through the qd .",
    "in this situation , the differential conductance shows a peak that mimics the kondo resonance ( zero bias anomaly or abrikosov - suhl resonance ) @xcite .",
    "for applied voltages of the order of @xmath9 , the peak splits and a strong dephasing destroys the kondo resonance @xcite .    there",
    "exist very diverse theoretical approaches to deal with the kondo effect that have been even applied to the theory of transport of more intricate qd arrangements like double or triple qds @xcite , spin - polarized qd systems @xcite , hybrid superconducting - normal qd setups @xcite , multiterminal qd systems @xcite .",
    "further , depending on the range of temperatures and whether or not the system is driven out of equilibrium , some theoretical approximation schemes are more suitable than others . for instance , the equation of motion technique is fairly good to describe nonequilibrium kondo physics for high and moderate temperatures ( higher than @xmath1 ) .",
    "this theoretical approach is able to explain the differential conductance splitting for voltages larger than @xmath9 .",
    "however , alternative models like the slave - boson mean field theory are more accurate for temperatures lower than @xmath1 .",
    "a relatively unexplored transport regime in systems exhibiting kondo correlations is the effect of a temperature gradient applied between the electronic reservoirs .",
    "indeed , the effect of increasing the background temperature in a kondo quantum dot results in a destruction of the many - body singlet @xcite . as a consequence ,",
    "the system enters the coulomb blockade regime where transport is only allowed when the additional charging energy @xmath5 is supplied by externally gating the qd . due to the coulomb blockade effect , the differential conductance displays a coulomb diamond structure as a function of the drain - source bias voltage and the dot level position . inside the cb diamond , the conductance",
    "is strongly suppressed in contrast to the kondo regime @xcite .",
    "temperature gradients can induce an electrical current ( i.e. , a thermocurrent ) as well as voltage differences can induce a heat current .",
    "these cross phenomena are related in linear response due to onsager reciprocity .",
    "the thermoelectric current @xmath10 gives the electrical current generated by a temperature bias @xmath11 in the absence of electrical gradients .",
    "equivalently , a system under open circuit conditions ( @xmath12 ) creates a thermovoltage @xmath13 in response to the thermal bias .",
    "thermoelectric effects are essential for designing reliable devices that are able to convert waste heat into useful electric work  @xcite .",
    "miniaturization progress has led to better performances  @xcite .",
    "for this reason , nanoscale conductors have attracted a lot of attention in a large variety of solid - state devices like qds  @xcite , molecular bridges  @xcite , graphene layers  @xcite , quantum hall junctions @xcite , or quantum spin hall systems @xcite , just to mention a few .",
    "one of the first experiments probing the thermoelectrical transport in quantum systems was performed in a qd setup in the coulomb blockade regime @xcite .",
    "a sign change was observed in the thermovoltage @xmath14 with the applied thermal bias .",
    "more recently , svensson _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite found analogous nonlinear effects in the thermovoltage properties of nanowire qds .",
    "the latter experiments where theoretically addressed by two of us @xcite in which the emergence of highly nonlinear effects in the thermocurrent @xmath15 and thermovoltage @xmath14 nicely agreed with the experimental results .",
    "a hartree - fock scheme using nonequilibrium green s functions within the equation - of - motion formalism was employed to model the thermoelectric transport in the coulomb blockade regime .",
    "the origin of nonlinear thermocurrents and thermovoltages is related to a change in the direction of the electrical flow due to the different qd resonance contributions . as a consequence , the differential thermoelectric conductance plots present a butterfly shape .",
    "later on , svilans _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite reported similar experimental findings .",
    "the purpose of this work is to go beyond the coulomb blockade regime and to thoroughly investigate the nonlinear thermoelectric properties of quantum dots in the kondo regime .",
    "our first aim is to determine the fate of the kondo effect upon application of a thermal gradient . in particular",
    ", we will discuss how the position of the kondo peak and the kondo temperature get modified due to thermal biases .",
    "we address this problem by employing different theoretical approaches : nonequilibrium green s function formalism ( negf ) with higher - order equation of motion ( eom ) , slave - boson mean - field theory ( sbmft ) and perturbative approach .",
    "these schemes encompass the whole range of temperatures , well below the kondo temperature and for temperatures of the order or higher than @xmath1 .",
    "we compare the different approximations and study their range of validity .",
    "importantly , we predict for the first time that the kondo resonance is destroyed when the thermal bias @xmath11 is sufficiently strong .",
    "this result is obtained using both perturbative and sbmft approaches .",
    "further , we are able to give a fully analytical expression for the kondo quench within perturbation theory . our second aim is to analyze the transport properties of the system driven out of the equilibrium with both voltage and thermal biases and to examine the current behavior for arbitrary values of @xmath11 .",
    "our main finding in this case is a strong nonlinear behavior in the eom current characteristics due to the existence of the kondo resonance and the single - particle peaks .",
    "this is a relevant result because it would allow to experimentally measure the system s energy scales from the nontrivial zeros of the current .",
    "despite the fact that nonlinear thermoelectrics  @xcite in kondo - correlated systems is quite a new topic , there is already a number of interesting results in the last years .",
