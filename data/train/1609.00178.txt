    "four short series of i - band time - resolved photometry of henize  2428 with merope on the mercator telescope on la palma on august 28 and 30 , 2009 .",
    "they showed a photometric variability as large as @xmath20.36  mag between series , so the system was monitored for a single , 4-hour interval on the night of september 2 , 2009 , and an orbital period was determined .",
    "another similar 4-hour time - series was covered in the johnson b - band with the saao 1 m telescope / shoc on july 11 , 2013 , and in the sloan i - band with the int / wfc on august 2 , 2013 .",
    "a single 20  min spectrum with vlt / fors was secured in the blue range on june 19 , 2010 , under program i d 085.d-0629(a ) , and three additional 15 min spectra with the same configuration on the night of july 8 , 2012 , with program i d 089.d-0453(a ) . the 1200 g grism with a slit width of 0.7 arcsec was used in all cases .",
    "the spectra covered the 409 - 556  nm range .",
    "the resulting effective resolution was 0.8  .",
    "these 4 spectra taken at different times during an orbit clearly showed radial velocity variations from both stars and established the need for and feasibility of a systematic radial velocity study ( see fig .",
    "this was carried out with gtc / osiris on august 11 , 2013 .",
    "the object was monitored for 3.8 hours with a slit width of 0.6 arcsec at parallactic angle .",
    "the r2000b grating was used , resulting in a wavelength coverage from 396 to 569.5  nm , and the effective resolution was 1.9  .",
    "the spectra were binned once ( binning 2@xmath101 ) in the spatial direction .",
    "the magnitude values form the int / wfc sloan i and the saao 1 m telescope / shoc johnson b light curve data were corrected for an extinction of @xmath11= 2.96@xmath50.34 , recomputed from an available value using a different extinction law .",
    "we performed a period analysis using schwarzenberg - czerny s analysis - of - variance ( aov ) method on the photometric data set with the greatest time coverage ( from mercator / merope covering 6.25 hours along three nights , not shown here ) .",
    "the aov periodogram shows the strongest peak at @xmath211.379 cycles d@xmath12 , which would correspond to a period of 0.0879 day , or 2.1 hours .",
    "the orbital period of the system is , however , twice as long , 0.1758@xmath50.0005 day ( 4.2 hours ) , as indicated by the ellipsoidal modulation of the light curve , with the two minima showing similar but different depths .",
    "the ephemerides of the light curves indicated in table 1 were computed from their respective light curve data .",
    "due to the asymmetry in the radial velocity curves , the corresponding ephemeris of the zero phase was computed from the ephemeris of the sloan i light curve data , taken 9 nights before , and therefore the associated , accumulated error is much larger .",
    "the orbital and physical parameters of the nucleus of henize  2428 were determined by modelling the light curves , together with the radial velocity - curves , all folded on the orbital period , 0.1758 day .",
    "the mass ratio @xmath13 was fixed to 1 , as suggested by the amplitude of the radial velocity curves .",
    "a systematic search of the parameter space was performed on the inclination , orbital separation , centre - of - mass velocity , temperatures and surface potential of both stars until @xmath14 was globally minimised .",
    "given the high effective temperature of both stars , an albedo of 1.0 was used for both components .",
    "gravity brightening and square - root limb darkening coefficients were computed according to the temperature and gravity of each component@xmath1 .",
    "we provide a rough estimate of the distance to henize  2428 from the comparison of the model s total luminosity to the dereddened , apparent magnitudes , adopting a bolometric correction according to the stars effective temperatures .",
    "the resulting distance is 1.4@xmath50.4 kpc .",
    "observations in the b - band were taken 22 nights before the data used to determine the orbital phase ; error accumulation during this time interval amounts to half an orbital period , thus preventing accurate phase determination of the b - band data .",
    "therefore , actually two possibilities were independently considered and modelled ; one where the deepest minimum in both light curves occurs at orbital phase 0 ( model shown in the paper ) , and another one where the deepest minimum is offset by half an orbit .",
    "the results of both models are very similar within uncertainties .",
    "these include the inclination , which is confined to a narrow range between 62.2@xmath3 and 63.8@xmath3 , still a few degrees away from the @xmath268@xmath3-inclined equatorial ring of the nebula .",
    "the surface potential of both stars are slightly different in this model , and the temperature of the primary is around a thousand k lower than that of the secondary .",
    "the total mass is slightly larger but similar to the model shown in the paper , 1.84 m@xmath0 , still above the chandrasekhar limit even when considering uncertainties .",
    "the total luminosity of the system is somewhat larger , 1200 l@xmath0 ."

    "<S> , we have undertaken a campaign of photometric monitoring of pn central stars that show characteristic features such as rings and/or jets highlighted as being associated with central star binarity . </S>",
    "<S> one of them , henize  2428 ( pn g049.4 + 02.4 ) , shows one of the shortest orbital periods found for this class of object . </S>",
    "<S> this bipolar nebula consists of two open lobes emerging from a ring - shaped waist inclined @xmath268@xmath3 to the plane of the sky ( as deduced from the elliptical shape of the ring in images of the nebula , see fig .  1 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the kinematic age of the bipolar lobes and ring implies that henize  2 - 428 is an evolved pn . </S>",
    "<S> however , the presence of a high density nebular core indicates that strong mass loss and/or mass transfer is occurring close to its central star , which in turn suggests that the nebula may host a binary core .    </S>",
    "<S> the periodic light curves of henize  2428 in the sloan i and johnson b bands ( respective effective wavelengths 0.78 and 0.44 @xmath4 m ) demonstrate its binary nature ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2 ) . </S>",
    "<S> they show two broad minima indicative of ellipsoidal modulation due to tidal distortion of one or both components . </S>",
    "<S> the period analysis using schwarzenberg - czerny s analysis - of - variance ( aov ) method on the photometric data set with the greatest time coverage reveals that the orbital period is 0.1758@xmath50.0005 day . </S>",
    "<S> spectroscopic observations with fors2 on the very large telescope ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3 ) show the absorption lines to be double and varying with the orbital phase . </S>",
    "<S> the sinusoidal doppler shifts of the double he ii 541.2  nm absorption feature are finally revealed by a series of gtc / osiris spectra obtained along a full orbit ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> 4 ) . </S>",
    "<S> gaussian fitting of the absorption - line profiles followed by sinusoidal fitting to the data folded on the orbital period indicates that both radial velocity amplitudes are identical , with values of 206@xmath58 and 206@xmath512 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the very similar depth of the each light curve minima , of the intensity of the he ii 541.2  nm stellar absorption line , and of the velocity amplitudes indicate that the two stars have nearly identical masses and effective temperatures . </S>",
    "<S> the latter can be constrained by the presence of the photoionised nebula and by the lack of he ii emission lines in the spectrum of the nebula . </S>",
    "<S> the effective temperatures of the stars have therefore been kept between 20,000 and 40,000 k in our modelling .    the combined analysis of the light curves and radial velocity curves@xmath1 yields the orbital parameters of the system ( table 1 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the result is a double - degenerate , overcontact binary , in which both stars overfill their roche lobes . </S>",
    "<S> the total luminosity of the system , 845 l@xmath0 , is compatible with the 690 l@xmath0 reported in the literature .    </S>",
    "<S> the inclination of the orbital plane is confined to a narrow range between 63.4@xmath3 and 66.1@xmath3 ( see table 1 ) , close to the @xmath268@xmath3-inclined equatorial ring of the nebula , further strengthening the binary hypothesis . </S>",
    "<S> it is noteworthy that the nebular and orbital axes of _ every _ pn in which both are known happen to be coincident within a few degrees . </S>",
    "<S> these are a41 , a63 , a65 , hatr4 , ngc  6337 , ngc  6778 , and sp1 . </S>",
    "<S> this is convincing evidence for the binary scenario formation of pne outlined above .    </S>",
    "<S> the most striking result is the total mass of the system , which amounts to 1.76 m@xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> this is the only reported double - degenerate system whose total mass is above the chandrasekhar limit without any ambiguity , even when considering the lowest mass allowed within the confidence range ( 1.5 m@xmath0 ) . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , with a mass ratio ( mass of the secondary over mass of the primary ) of 1 , both stars are quite massive compared to average post - agb stars , and their luminosity and effective temperatures do not match the theoretical post - agb cooling tracks . </S>",
    "<S> the explanation must be sought in their binary evolution . </S>",
    "<S> the system seems to have first undergone a phase of mass transfer via wind or stable roche lobe overflow ( rlof ) , and then a ce . </S>",
    "<S> this is likely , as in order to have two oversized pre - wd stars with r=0.68 - 0.7 r@xmath0 still hot , the two events must have happened fast and consecutively . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , for the system to have a current mass ratio close to 1 , the initial mass ratio must have been also very close to 1 . </S>",
    "<S> such a case would lead to a stable rlof initially , given the relatively massive cores and judging by stability studies . </S>",
    "<S> after the first pre - wd star was formed ( from a quite massive agb ) , the mass ratio ( agb / pre - wd ) would then be much larger than 1 , as the secondary is still a massive agb as well , and the system would undergo a ce phase . having an initial mass ratio close to 1 would also explain the final , similar luminosities and effective temperatures .    an alternate model in which one or both stars are non - degenerate helium stars deserves further discussion . a 0.88 m@xmath0 helium star approaching core helium exhaustion , produced by the hydrogen shell of a massive star being stripped off during rlof , would have a compatible luminosity of 422 l@xmath0 , although its radius , 0.16 r@xmath0 is still lower than the 0.68 r@xmath0 radius found in this work , and the position of the stars of henize  2428 in log @xmath6@xmath7 diagrams does not match the locus of helium stars in binary systems in the same way as it does not match the aforementioned post - agb cooling tracks . </S>",
    "<S> this alternate model is , however , very unlikely , considering that _ ( a ) _ the computed he / h and the supersolar n / o abundance values indicate a composition more typical of a processed , agb envelope than a rgb envelope ; and _ ( b ) _ gas densities in the extended equatorial ring are around 10@xmath8 @xmath9 , implying recombination times of the order of a few tens of years for h , and a few years for n+ , o+ , and o++ . </S>",
    "<S> given the nebula age , of the order of a few thousand years , that excludes the possibility that the nebula has a fossil photoionization . </S>",
    "<S> in any case , more robust theoretical models should help understanding the peculiarities of this intriguing system .    </S>",
    "<S> the stars are massive and close enough to merge in a hubble time ( @xmath2700 million years ) , thus making henize  2428 a strong sn ia candidate . </S>",
    "<S> such a massive double - degenerate system may well explain supernova remnants like snr 0509 - 67.5 , in which the single - degenerate scenario can be ruled out , and confirms the plausibility of double - degenerate scenarios as sn ia progenitors .    </S>",
    "<S> the thermal time scale of the stars is @xmath280,000 years , much less than the merging time of the system . </S>",
    "<S> if the radius of each star contracts on the thermal timescale , then the system will relatively quickly become detached and the orbital period will shrink accordingly . if this is the case , long - term monitoring of this system might reveal small changes in the orbital period over the course of the next decades .    </S>",
    "<S> in addition to henize  2428 , only half a dozen double - degenerate binary systems are known so far : v458  vul ; sbs  1150 + 599a , the nucleus of ts  01 ; mt  ser , the nucleus of abell 41 , ngc  6026 , and fg  1 . </S>",
    "<S> however , estimates indicate they could amount up to 25% of the total pne hosting a close - binary central star </S>",
    "<S> . this figure could be even larger given the strong selection effects against double degenerates in photometric surveys in fact , most double - degenerate systems may only be identified via radial velocity studies . </S>",
    "<S> it is clear that a larger sample of double - degenerate central stars of pne would not only help better assess their contribution to the total number of pne or sn ia progenitors , but also better understand the role of common - envelope and/or contact - binarity in the evolution and shaping of pne and in the production of sn ia events .    </S>",
