    "since its advent , density - functional theory ( dft ) @xcite is routinely applied for calculating the electronic , magnetic , spectroscopic and thermodynamic properties of atoms , molecules and materials in ground and excited states . in the last couple of decades ,",
    "studying excited- states employing dft has become the main research interest @xcite .",
    "thus one of the most natural approach to do excited - state dft is to adopt the time - independent density functional formalism @xcite in which the individual excited - state energies are determined from the stationary states of the energy density functional .",
    "however , the question is whether there exists any such functional(s ) for excited states analogous to the ground - state . not only energy functionals but also the most fundamental and essential requirement for excited - state density functional theory ( @xmath0dft ) is to establish the one - to - one mapping similar to the hohenberg - kohn theorem which is the main intent of the present work . although the issue of density @xmath1 to potential @xmath2 mapping for excited states has been addressed in the past @xcite , but the question still remains unanswered .",
    "so the current work will answer the critiques of density - to - potential mapping based on the generalized / unified constrained search(cs ) due to perdew - levy(pl ) @xcite , grling @xcite , levy - nagy(ln ) @xcite , samal - harbola(sh ) @xcite and ayers - levy - nagy @xcite .    in the present work , we will critically analyse and make furtherance to the @xmath0dft ideas proposed by samal and harbola @xcite . according to it , ( i ) the cs approach can be extended to excited - state in the light of the stationary state formalism of grling @xcite and variational @xmath0dft formalism by levy - nagy @xcite ; ( ii ) within the variational @xmath0dft formalism , the construction of the kohn - sham(ks ) system by comparing only the ground - state density is insufficient and ca nt explain the existence of multiple potentials ; ( iii ) the density - to - potential mapping in @xmath0dft can be achieved through the following criteria : compare the ground states of the true and ks system energetically such that it can account for the most close resemblance of the densities in a least square sense .",
    "sh showed it by comparing the expectation value of the original ground - state ks hamiltonian ( obtained using the harbola - sahni @xcite exact exchange potential ) with that of the alternative ks systems .",
    "finally , the kinetic energy of true and ks system need to be kept closest .",
    "this is also another way of comparing the ground states based on the differential virial theorem(dvt ) @xcite ; ( iv ) the cs approach is capable of generating all the potentials for a given excited state density and at the same time uniquely establishes the density - to - potential mapping .",
    "the work is organized as follows . in sec.ii",
    ", the generalized / unified cs @xmath0dft will be briefly discussed from the prospective of density - to - potential mapping .",
    "it will be shown that there exist multitude of potentials for a given density .",
    "in sec.iii , furtherance of sh @xmath0dft will be presented in order to show the existence and unique construction of the desired density - to - potential mapping . in this",
    ", we will show , how the proposed @xmath0dft is also consistent with the generalized adiabatic connection(gac ) ks formalism @xcite and in principle applicable to ( non-)coulombic densities . in sec.iv",
    ", we will show the existence of multiple potentials for given ground or lowest excited states can never be ruled out even within li .",
    "et al.@xcite demonstration of gunnarsson and lundqvist(gl ) theorem @xcite . however , based on the theories presented in sec.ii & iii ,",
    "these seemingly contradictory results will be explained in order to justify the non - violation of hohenberg - kohn(hk ) @xcite and gl theorems .",
    "thus the density - to - potential mapping will be demonstrated within @xcite approach by making use of the unified @xmath0dft for the two model systems ( i.e. @xmath3 quantum harmonic oscillator(qho ) with finite boundary and infinite well external potentials ) . for completeness , in sec .",
    "v , same set of model systems will be used to exemplify density - to - potential mapping based on the cs formalism @xcite .",
    "finally , we will provide firm footing to density - to - potential mapping based on the proposed criteria of @xmath0dft .",
    "although in principle the ground - state cs formalism @xcite has all the information about the excited - states , the desired density - to - potential mapping for individual excited - states are not so trivial and straightforward .",
    "to do so , series of attempts being made based on the original cs approach @xcite . in the recent past , the form of functional for ground state ( both for degenerate and non - degenerate ) has been extended @xcite to study the excited states .",
    "now we will briefly describe how the generalized cs formalism explains the existence of multiple potentials for any given fermionic density without hindering the density - to - potential mapping .",
    "let s consider @xmath4 fermions trapped in a local external potential @xmath5 , described by the hamiltonian @xmath6 = \\hat t + \\hat v_{\\text{ee } } + \\sum_{i=1}^n\\hat v_{\\text{ext}}(\\vec r_i ) , \\label{gcs1}\\ ] ] where @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the kinetic and electron - electron interaction operators with the corresponding stationary states are given by @xmath9 \\psi_k(\\vec r ) = e_k[\\hat v(\\vec r ) , n ] \\psi_k(\\vec r)~ , \\label{gcs2}\\ ] ] where @xmath10 . in eq.([gcs2 ] ) , @xmath11 $ ] are the pure state @xmath12representable stationary quantum states i.e. it is coming from the solution of the schrdinger equation . but for @xmath13representable densities ( i.e. @xmath14 ) and therefore wavefunctions",

    "since all the lower states @xmath30 ( j < k)$ ] are determined from the external potential @xmath31 ( which is a unique functional of ground state density @xmath23 according to hk @xcite theorem ) , implies that the ground state density plays an important role in ln - formalism .",
    "so , in principle one can also write the excited - state density bifunctional as @xmath32 $ ] instead of @xmath33 $ ]",
    ". if the electronic densities are @xmath12representable then eq.([gcs6 ] ) modifies to @xmath34 = \\int \\rho_k(\\vec r ) { v}_{\\text{ext}}(\\vec r ) d\\vec r +   f_k[\\rho,{\\hat v}_{\\text{ext } } ] .",

    "the matching of the ground - state densities actually matches the external potentials @xmath42 and @xmath51 according to the hk theorem @xcite .",
    "but the difference occurs between the kinetic energies of the two systems . as matter of which",
    ", the discrepancy in the @xmath52 mapping arises because the ln criterion strictly depends upon the behavior of the bifunctional .",
    "the cs formulation described in the previous section implies that the content of the excited state functionals @xmath53 $ ] and @xmath54 $ ] differs from the hk universal functional @xmath55 $ ] except their stationarity with respect to variation in the external potential .",
    "actually , only in the case of ground - state , all the three functionals are identical to one another and in general there exists a close link between grling @xmath53 $ ] and levy - nagy @xmath54 $ ] @xcite .",
    "so in the unified @xmath0dft formalism , for a given excited - state eigendensity @xmath56 , both @xmath53 $ ] and @xmath57 $ ] are stationary about the corresponding @xmath58 which also holds for the desired excited - state @xmath59 @xcite .",
    "now due to the presence of orthogonality constraint in @xmath57 $ ] , several choices for the set of low lying states can be made to which @xmath60 will be orthogonal and for each choice , there may exists a generalized potential function @xmath61 .",
    "so some extra deciding factors are required for setting up the @xmath52 mapping which is the intent of the current section .",
    "now resorting back to the work of samal - harbola @xcite , we would also like to re - emphasis that the direct or indirect comparison of ground states are not sufficient to establish the @xmath62 mapping or to construct the ks system for excited - states @xcite . given the discussions on unified cs @xmath0dft in the previous section , we now present a consistent approach to address the density - to - potential mapping issues .",
    "fundamentally rigorous and crucial tenets of the proposed dft are : ( _ i _ ) there exist ways for mapping an excited - state density @xmath56 to the corresponding many - electron wavefunction @xmath63 which in turn maps to the external potential @xmath64 through the @xmath65-stationary wavefunctions @xcite . in this",
    ", the wavefunction depends upon the ground - state density @xmath23 implicitly .",
    "( _ ii _ ) the ks system is to be defined through a comparison of the kinetic energy , ground - state density and variation of the energy w.r.t .",
    "symmetry of the excited - states .",
    "the claim is , unified cs approach can provide the mapping from an excited - state density @xmath56 to many - body wavefunction .",
    "stationary state formalism @xcite provides a straightforward method of mapping @xmath66 , just by making sure whether @xmath67 is stationary or not , subject to the condition that @xmath68 gives @xmath69 .",
    "but @xcite shows that different @xmath70s correspond to potentials @xmath71 .",
    "the same problem also pervades through the variational @xmath0dft approach as proposed by ln @xcite .",
    "thus unified cs gives , many different wavefunctions @xmath70 and the corresponding external potential @xmath71 can be associated with a given density .",
    "now if in addition to the excited - state density we also have the ground - state information @xmath23 , then @xmath72 can be uniquely determined out of all possible multiple potentials @xmath71 . hence with the knowledge of @xmath23 , it is quite trivial to select a particular @xmath73 that belongs to a given @xmath74 $ ] combination by comparing @xmath71 with the actual @xmath72 .",
    "alternatively , one can think of it as finding @xmath73 variationally for a @xmath75 $ ] combination .",
    "its because the knowledge of @xmath23 and @xmath76 is equivalent . now with the above information , the bifunctional @xmath77 $ ] can be redefined as @xmath78 \\ ; = \\ ; \\langle \\psi[\\rho_e,\\rho_{0 } ] | \\hat{t } \\;+\\ ; \\hat{v}_{ee } | \\psi[\\rho_e,\\rho_{0}]\\rangle .",
    "\\label{cdpm1}\\ ] ] the above theoretical formulation is similar to that of ln @xcite but avoids the orthogonality constraint imposed by ln formalism .",
    "this is because , the densities for different excited states for a given ground - state density @xmath23 ( that corresponds to a unique external potential @xmath76 ) can be found in following manner : take a density and search for @xmath73 that makes @xmath79 stationary and simultaneously make sure whether the corresponding potential @xmath80 @xmath81}{\\delta\\rho}{\\big|}_{\\rho   = \\rho_e } \\big)$ ] resembles the given @xmath23 ( or @xmath76 ) ; if not , search for another density and repeat the procedure until the correct @xmath65 is found .",
    "thus it is clear that excited state orbitals @xmath73 are now functional of @xmath82 $ ] .",
    "so the correct density @xmath65 is excited state density of the potential and the @xmath73 obtained in this method is also excited state wavefunction corresponding to that potential and density . after finding the correct density @xmath69 ,",
    "make a variation over it so that @xmath83 and again perform the cs to find @xmath84 $ ] . in this case",
    ", choose that @xmath85 which converges to @xmath45 as @xmath86 .",
    "the above propositions for the excited - states in terms of their densities are quite reasonable , particularly because it s development is parallel to that for the ground - state dft . on the other hand ,",
    "to construct a kohn - sham @xcite system for a given density is not so trivial ; and to carry out accurate calculations for excited - states , it is of prime importance to construct a ks system .",
    "further , a ks system will be meaningful if the orbitals involve in an excitation match with the corresponding excitations in the true system .",
    "samal - harbola @xcite have shown that the ks system constructed using the levy - nagy criterion fails in this regard . but using the form of the functional above a ks system can be defined for excited state .",
    "actually , the state dependence of the excited - state exchange - correlation functional @xcite leads to the discrepancies while one compares the ground - states either direct or indirect manner .",
    "but in principle , obtaining a ks system is plausible .",
    "now by defining the non - interacting kinetic energy @xmath87 $ ] and using it to further define the exchange - correlation functional as @xmath88 = f[\\rho_e,\\rho_0 ] - e_{\\text{h}}[\\rho_e ] - t_s[\\rho_e,\\rho_0 ] , \\label{cdpm4}\\ ] ] solves the purpose .",
    "so the euler equation for the excited - state densities becomes @xmath89}{\\delta\\rho(\\vec r ) } + { v}_{\\text { h}}[\\rho_e ] + \\frac{\\delta e_{xc}\\left[\\rho_e,\\rho_0\\right]}{\\delta\\rho(\\vec r)}\\big\\}~ , \\label{cdpm5}\\ ] ] which is equivalent to solving the ks equation @xmath90 where @xmath91 - t_{s}\\left[\\rho,\\rho_0 \\right]\\big\\}}{\\delta\\rho(\\vec r)}{\\big|}_{\\rho(\\vec r ) = \\rho_e[v_{ext}(\\vec r ) ] } ~. \\label{cdpm7}\\ ] ] in ground state dft , one can easily find the @xmath92 $ ] by minimizing the kinetic energy for a given density ; here @xmath92 $ ] for a given density is obtained by occupying the lowest energy orbitals for a non - interacting system .",
    "but in @xmath0dft , to define @xmath87 $ ] is not easy , as for the excited - states it is not clear which orbitals to occupy for a given density . particularly because a density can be generated by many different configurations of the non - interacting systems .",
    "levy - nagy select one of these systems by comparing the ground - state density corresponding to the excited - state non - interacting system with the true ground - state density",
    ". however , ln criterion is not satisfactory as pointed out by samal and harbola @xcite .",
    "the reason of this discrepancy is due to the inconsistency of the ground - state density of an excited state ks system with the true ground - state density .",
    "the ground -state density corresponding to the excited - state ks system is not same as the ground - state density of the true system .",
    "this means the desired state is not associated with @xmath93 , rather it comes from a different local potential @xmath94 . to settle this inconsistency ,",
    "ks system must be so chosen that it is energetically very close to the original system and it can be ensured through the following criterion .",
    "_ criterion i : the non - interacting kinetic energy _ @xmath95 $ ]",
    "_ obtained through the cs need to be very close to the actual _ @xmath96 $ ] , where @xmath95 $ ] and @xmath96 $ ] are defined as @xmath97&=&\\min_{\\phi \\to \\rho_e } \\langle\\phi|\\hat t",

    "\\label{cdpm8 } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] so defining @xmath98 smallest not only ensures that dft exchange - correlation energy remains closer to the conventional quantum mechanical exchange - correlation energy but also keeps the structure of the ks potential appropriate for the desired excited - state which is shown below . based on the dvt @xcite",
    ", it can be argued how for a given density @xmath69 one can have different exchange -correlation @xmath99 and external @xmath45 potentials . according to dvt , the exact expression for the gradient of the external potential ( for interacting system ) for a given excited - state density @xmath69 is @xmath100\\vargamma_2(\\vec r,\\vec r')d\\vec r'~ , \\label{dvt1 } \\label{cdpm9}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath101 .",
    "this equation represents an exact relation between the gradient of the external potential @xmath45 , the @xmath102 interaction potential @xmath103 and the density matrices @xmath1 , @xmath104 and @xmath105 .",
    "the vector field @xmath106 in eq.([cdpm9])is related to the kinetic - energy density tensor via @xmath107 = \\big[\\frac{1}{4}\\big(\\frac{\\partial^2 } { \\partial r'_\\alpha\\partial r''_\\beta } + \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial r'_\\beta\\partial r''_\\alpha }   \\big)\\vargamma_1(\\vec r';\\vec r'')\\big]_{\\vec r'=\\vec r''=\\vec r }             \\label{cdpm10}\\ ] ] so , @xmath106 can be called a  local  functional of @xmath108 . similarly , for ks potential eq.([cdpm9 ] ) reduces to @xmath109 as a given ground - state density @xmath23 fixes the external potential uniquely via hk theorem , which implies that @xmath65 , @xmath108 and @xmath110 are also fixed from eq.([cdpm9 ] ) . since the density matrices generated by some eigenfunction @xmath73 of the hamiltonian @xmath111",
    "so the fixed pair of excited - state and ground - state density i.e. @xmath82 $ ] may be arising from different configurations @xmath112 different configurations can be thought of as arising from different external potential or different exchange - correlation potential and this is due to the different @xmath108 and @xmath110 for a fixed @xmath69 .",
    "suppose a given density @xmath69 is generated through an @xmath113 ks system , then @xmath114 if the density is generated through a @xmath115 external potential then @xmath116\\vargamma^j_2(\\vec",

    "thus ln criterion is exact for non - interacting system as there is no interaction , so the ground - state density match perfectly .",
    "this proposal of ln for @xmath122 mapping was carried by samal and harbola @xcite but they argued in a slightly different way .",
    "they proposed that both for interacting and non - interacting case among all the multiple potentials , choose the correct ks potential whose ground - state density differ from the exact ground - state `` most closely by least - square sense '' which is done in the following manner .",

    "this criterion is more appropriate in the context of @xmath122 than the one proposed by @xcite .",
    "the criterion as given in eq.([cdpm16 ] ) will be fully satisfied if one makes use of the excited state functionals @xcite .",
    "otherwise it may fail in certain situations as pointed out by sh @xcite .    instead of sticking to the _ criterion i & ii _",
    ", one can even go beyond the same through _ criterion iii : compare the ground states of the true and alternate systems energetically_. it can be done in the following manner in order to select the ks system for a given density . the alternative approach is to compare the ground - state expectation value of the ks system and the true system , instead of comparing their ground - state densities and kinetic energies .",
    "the procedure for comparing ground - state energy level is the following .",
    "first solve the exact dft equation ( say harbola - sahni @xcite etc ) for ground - state of the true system and obtain the ground - state of ks hamiltonian @xmath127 . if the expectation value of the ground state hamiltonian of the true system is @xmath128 and that of the ks system is @xmath129 , then one need to choose that ks system whose @xmath130 @xmath131 @xmath128 .",
    "these criteria are well connected to the gac - ks @xcite as discussed below .",

    "now consider the fig.[csfig7]a , in this case we have produced three symmetrically different alternative potentials @xmath255 , @xmath262 and @xmath266 ( shown in fig.[csfig7]b ) whose ground - states densities ( i.e. @xmath299 and @xmath300)are same as the different excited - states densities ( i.e. @xmath301 and @xmath302 ) of the qho potential @xmath303 . here",
    "@xmath304 corresponds to the configuration [ @xmath305 .",
    "similarly , @xmath306 and @xmath302 are arising from the excited - state configurations [ @xmath307 and [ @xmath308 respectively . in fig.[csfig7](d ) , we have produced a different potential @xmath255 whose excited - state density corresponding to the configuration [ @xmath309 is same as the excited - state density @xmath286 ( [ @xmath305 ) of the original @xmath3 qho potential .",
    "although we have produced so many potentials , but our criteria will only select the original potentials ( i.e. the infinite potential well in the previous and qho in the current study ) for any given ( i.e. either ground or excited - state ) density . thus establishes the excited - state @xmath310 mapping uniquely .",
    "now the conceptually basic questions of @xmath0dft : what are the consequences as well as similarities and differences between the results of the cs formalism and that obtained in connection to the hk / gl theorem ? secondly , whether there arisen any critical scenario which is inconsistent with the hk and /or",
    "gl theorem(s ) ?",
    "this is because several multiple potentials are obtained for non - interacting fermions in the ground as well as lowest excited state . not only that , @xcite have also claimed that for higher excited - states there is no analogue of hk theorem .",
    "so the seemingly contradictory results may give rise to the wrong conclusion about the validity of hk / gl theorem and non - existence of density - to- potential mapping for excited - states .",
    "however , the generalized / unified cs formalism overrules all these claims by showing that the ground - state density of a given symmetry ( potential ) can be the excited - state density of differing symmetry ( potential ) .",
    "now this excited - state will have a corresponding ground state which will be obviously quite different from the ground - state of the original system . as a matter",
    "of which there will exist a different potential according to hk theorem .",
    "this is also true for the excited -state density of the actual system : when it becomes either the ground - state or some arbitrary excited -state density of another potential .",
    "so the unified cs formalism justifies the non - violation of hk / gl theorem for such states .",
    "now based on the unified / generalized cs @xmath0dft , one can very nicely interpret ours as well as @xcite results . actually by keeping the excited / ground state density fix via a unitary transformation",
    "never guarantee the symmetries of the states involve will remain intact .",
    "this is because by changing the @xmath163 value and keeping either ground or the excited state density fix , we are forcing the system to change itself accordingly without hindering only the fixed density constraint . since @xmath163 is not fixed .",
    "so in principle one can make several choices for @xmath163 and for each choice , the system will converge to different potentials ( systems / configurations ) which can give the desired density of ground/ excited - state of the original system ( potential / configurations ) as one of it s eigendensity . actually , the converged potentials are those for which the grling and ln functionals are stationary and minimum respectively .",
    "so everything is again automatically fits into realm of generalized cs formalism and nothing really contradicting or posing issues for the @xmath0dft formulations provided by @xcite .",
    "also the transformed quantum states leading to multitude of potential for a given density are energetically far off from the actual system and even the ground - states are also very different . thus the generalized cs formalism proposed in this work along with the sh criteria can be considered as the most essential steps for establishing the @xmath311 which further elaborated below .",
    "now the question is out of these existing multiple potentials in association with a fix density and @xmath163 , which potential in principle should be picked in view of the @xmath312 ? the criteria of selecting the exact potential out of all possibilities",
    "have already been discussed in sec.iii .",
    "first of all it is quite obvious from the figs.([qhofig0_0 - 1 ] @xmath241 [ qhofig0_2 - 2 ] ) and from fig.[pbfig2 - 1 ] @xmath241 fig.[pbfig4 - 3 ] that the ground - state densities of the generated alternate potentials are different from that of the original potential .",
    "this is also true even for the results of the cs formalism as shown in the figs.([csfig1 ] @xmath241 [ csfig7 ] ) .",
    "so when we are fixing the excited - state density at the same time we should have taken care of the ground - state of the newly found system and the old one . similarly , when several multiple potentials are generated for a given ground - state density , the same is not produced as the ground state eigendensity of the alternate potentials .",
    "so it s quite obvious that there is no violation of the hk theorem .",
    "the criteria of taking care of the ground - states of the two system is given in eq.([cdpm16 ] ) .",
    "additionally the kinetic energies of the two systems need to be kept closest , which we have pointed out on the basis of dvt .",
    "so in all the non - interacting model systems reported here , @xmath313 should have been zero .",
    "but the drastically differing structures of the transformed and original wavefunctions are nothing but the manifestation of non - vanishing difference of kinetic energies and thus leading to the multiple potentials .",
    "furthermore , the most significant differences between the symmetries of the old and new systems implies that principally there exist discrepancies in the expectation values of the hamiltonian w.r.t .",
    "the ground - states of various multiple potentials .",
    "this is what trivially follows from the reported results .",
    "hence , the proposed criteria uniquely maps a given density of the @xmath3 qho / infinite well to a potential which is nothing but the @xmath3 qho / infinite well and discards rest of the multiple potentials .",
    "in this work , we have tried to obtain a consistent theory for @xmath0dft based on the stationary state , variational and gac formalism of modern dft .",
    "we have provided a unified and general approach for dealing with excited - states which follows from previous attempts made by perdew - levy , grling , levy - nagy - ayers and in particular the work of samal - harbola in the recent past . in this current attempt",
    ", we have answered the questions raised about the validity of hk and gl theorems to excited - states .",
    "we have settled the issues by explaining why there exist multiple potentials not only for higher excited states but also for the ground as well as lowest excited state of given symmetry .",
    "in fact , the existing @xmath0dft formalism allows the above possibility and at the same time keeps the uniqueness of density - to - potential mapping intact .",
    "so we have established in a rigorous fundamental footing the non - violation of the hk and gl theorem .",
    "actually , the generalized cs approach gives us a strong basis in choosing a potential out of several multiple potentials for a fixed ground / excited state density . in our propositions",
    ", we have strictly defined the bi - density functionals for a fix pair of ground and excited - state densities in order to establish the density - to - potential mapping . not only that , the theory also gives us a clear definition of excited - state ks systems through the comparison of kinetic and exchange - correlation energies w.r.t . the true system .",
    "it does takes care the stationarity and orthogonality of the quantum states .",
    "so everything fits quite naturally into the realm of modern dft .    to conclude , we have demonstrated density - to - potential mapping for non - interacting fermions .",
    "for interacting case the gac can be used to formulate all the theoretical and numerical contents in a similar way .",
    "we are working along this direction for strictly correlated fermions and the results will be reported in future .",
    "finally , our conclusion is that nothing really reveals the manifestation of the failure or violation of the basic theorems and existing principles of modern dft irrespective of the states under consideration .",
    "the method presented by samal - harbola and further progress being made here provides a most suitable framework and starting ground for the development of new density -functional methods for the self - consistent treatment of excited states .",
    "more realistically , the unified cs @xmath0dft and further extensions to the sh criteria treat both the ground or excited states in an analogous manner .",
    "hence , the present work endows the uniqueness of density - to - potential mapping for excited - states with a firm footing .",
    "the authors thankfully acknowledge valuable discussions with prof . manoj k. harbola and m. hemanadhan ."
