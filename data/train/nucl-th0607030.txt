    "in nuclear physics , the symmetry energy is first encountered within the elementary bethe - weizscker formula for nuclear energy : @xmath0 it is the change in nuclear energy associated with changing neutron - proton asymmetry @xmath1 . in nuclear matter ,",
    "the energy per nucleon , dependent on neutron @xmath2 and proton @xmath3 densities , may be represented as a sum of the energy @xmath4 for symmetric nuclear matter and the correction @xmath5 associated with the asymmetry , @xmath6 where @xmath7 .",
    "the charge symmetry of nuclear interactions , which is the symmetry under the interchange of neutrons and protons , requires that the correction be quadratic in the asymmetry , for small asymmetries : @xmath8 microscopic calculations , such as @xcite , indicate that the quadratic approximation yields a very good representation for the energy in nuclear matter , up to the limit of neutron matter with asymmetry of  1 , over a wide range of net densities . as a consequence , the energy in nuclear matter over a broad range of parameters can be described exclusively in terms of the energy of symmetric matter @xmath9 and the symmetry - energy coefficient @xmath10 .",
    "much effort has been dedicated in the past to the understanding of @xmath9 and less so to @xmath10 whose features remain more obscure @xcite .",
    "the energy @xmath9 minimizes at the normal density @xmath11 , reaching there the value of @xmath12  mev .",
    "the uncertainties in @xmath13 hamper predictions for neutron stars whose structure depends on pressure in neutron matter @xcite . in pure neutron matter , the energy is @xmath14 and the pressure is @xmath15 close to @xmath11 , as @xmath4 minimizes at @xmath11 . in the calculations of neutron - star structure @xcite ,",
    "a correlation is found , @xmath16 , between the radius @xmath17 of a neutron star of a given mass and the pressure @xmath18 in neutron matter at a given density @xmath19 .",
    "when examining the standard energy formula ( [ eq : bw ] ) , we notice that the symmetry energy has a volume character : it changes as @xmath20 when the neutron and proton numbers are scaled by one factor .",
    "the formula lacks a surface symmetry term that would change as @xmath21 with the change in nucleon number .",
    "a question to ask is whether there should be such a term .",
    "let us look at the surface energy .",
    "we can write it as @xmath22 .",
    "the ratio @xmath23 is surface tension , the work that needs to be done per unit area when changing the surface area of the nucleus , such as in deforming the nucleus .",
    "the work needs to be done to compensate lost binding , as nucleons close to the surface are less bound , due to fewer neighbors , than in the interior .",
    "the formula ( [ eq : bw ] ) states that in the interior the nucleons are less bound in a more asymmetric nucleus . in that case , the energetic price for increasing the surface should drop , i.e.@xmath24 should decrease with asymmetry , in the more general definition of tension .    as intensive ,",
    "@xmath25 should be expressed in terms an intensive quantity associated with the asymmetry , which is the asymmetry chemical potential : @xmath26 to lowest order , under charge symmetry , the tension needs to be quadratic in @xmath27 , @xmath28 if the tension depends on asymmetry , so must surface energy . on examining the function @xmath29 , with the derivative @xmath30",
    ", the last dependence is seen to produce the following apparent paradox : some of the nuclear asymmetry @xmath31 must be associated with the surface and not the interior . to answer the question on how particles can be attributed to the surface",
    ", one needs to adapt a systematic approach the separation of quantities into volume and surface contributions .",
    "gibbs @xcite proposed to consider two copies of the system , actual and an idealized reference copy where the interior densities of different quantities extend up to the surface position , cf .",
    "[ fig : gibbs ] .     gibbs @xcite construction for defining volume and surface contributions . ]",
    "the idealized system represents one with only volume contributions to different quantities , while the difference between the systems can be associated with the surface , @xmath32 .",
    "the separation , however , depends on the position of the surface which must be set utilizing some auxiliary condition . for nuclei ,",
    "it is natural to demand a vanishing surface nucleon surface number @xmath33 , i.e.set the surface position at the sharp - edged sphere radius  @xmath17 .",
    "since nuclei , though , are binary systems , the surface positions that might be separately attributed to neutrons and protons will be , generally , displaced relative to each other , cf .",
    "[ fig : gibbs2 ] .     in a two - component system ,",
    "the surfaces for the two components will be , generally , displaced relative to each other . ]    in consequence , in spite of a vanishing surface nucleon number , @xmath34 , we may have a finite surface asymmetry @xmath35 .",
    "having resolved the apparent paradox , from ( [ eq : sigma ] ) we find @xmath36 here , the index 0 refers to symmetric matter and we have introduced a surface symmetry coefficient @xmath37 , with dimension of energy . for the volume energy , within the standard formula , we have @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the volume symmetry energy coefficient . the coulomb energy is temporarily ignored .",
    "the net energy and asymmetry are , respectively , @xmath40 and @xmath41 . in the ground state ,",
    "the asymmetry should partition itself into the surface and volume contributions , in such a way as to minimize the energy .",
    "the result of the energy minimization can be , actually , written right away once one notices that the surface and volume energies , quadratic in asymmetry , are analogous to the energies of capacitors quadratic in the charge .",
    "the energy of the coupled capacitors is quadratic in the net charge , with the square divided by the net capacitance , yielding : @xmath42    adding now the coulomb term , we arrive at the modified energy formula @xmath43 compared to the standard formula ( [ eq : bw ] ) , the symmetry coefficient becomes now mass dependent , @xmath44 .",
    "the standard formula is recovered when @xmath45 , i.e.  the surface does not accept asymmetry excess , or in the limit of @xmath46 . within the modified formula",
    ", the symmetry coefficient weakens at low @xmath20 @xcite . whether or not the coefficient may be replaced by the constant @xmath39 depends on the ratio @xmath47 . that ratio can be determined from the ratio of surface to volume asymmetry partitioning for the energy minimum in proportion to the capacitances : @xmath48",
    "establishing the relatively small differences in the distribution of neutrons and protons in nuclei has been , generally , difficult experimentally .",
    "probes with different sensitivities to protons and neutrons had been utilized , such as electrons and protons , negative and positive pions , or protons and neutrons , with different associated systematic errors .",
    "the results have not been expressed in terms of the surface excess , but rather in terms of the difference in the r.m.s .",
    "radii between neutrons and protons .",
    "the conversion from the excess ( [ eq : nzs ] ) to the difference of radii is relatively straightforward @xcite , if the surface diffuseness is similar for neutrons and protons .",
    "another issue to consider theoretically is that , for heavy nuclei , coulomb forces compete with symmetry - energy effects , pushing the proton radius out against neutrons and polarizing the nuclear interior . that competition is easily taken into account by minimizing the sum of three energies with respect to the asymmetry : @xmath49 where @xmath50 from the energy minimization , an analytic formula for the difference of the radii follows , @xmath51 the first term on the r.h.s .",
    "represents the effects of symmetry energy only , from eq .",
    "( [ eq : nzs ] ) , while the second term represents the coulomb correction .",

    "( [ eq : rdif ] ) , it may be worthwhile to test the macroscopic theory against the microscopic . in their nonrelativistic hartree - fock and relativistic hartree calculations , typel and brown @xcite observed correlations between the sizes of asymmetry skins in different nuclei , when utilizing different effective interactions .",

    "neither can the @xmath20-dependent symmetry coefficient be replaced by @xmath39 , nor even expanded linearly in @xmath58 .",
    "to find absolute values of the symmetry coefficients , one might try to fit the binding formula to measured energies .",
    "however , this is treacherous as conclusions on details in different isospin - dependent terms , including coulomb , wigner and pairing get interrelated when drawn from a global fit to the energies .",
    "in addition , the correlation between mass number and asymmetry along the line of stability correlates the conclusions on details in the isospin dependent and isospin independent terms .",
    "the conclusions on the symmetry coefficients change depending on what is done to the other terms in the formula @xcite .",
    "optimal for determining the symmetry parameters would be a study of the symmetry term in the binding formula in isolation from the formula remainder , which might seem impossible .",
    "however , one can take advantage of the extension of charge symmetry of nuclear interactions to charge invariance .",
    "under charge invariance the symmetry term should be a scalar in isospin space @xcite and can be , thus , generalized with @xmath63 where we also happen to absorb most of the wigner term into the symmetry term . under the generalization ,",

    "the pairing contribution depends on the evenness of @xmath64 .    for an isospin of the same evenness as the ground ,",
    "the change in the formula in the excitation occurs only in the symmetry term : @xmath65 and the excitation energy can be used to the determine the symmetry energy nucleus by nucleus from @xmath66 in the context of the previous considerations , the question to ask is whether the deduced @xmath20-dependent symmetry coefficient weakens for light nuclei and whether the inverse of the coefficient is linear in @xmath58 : @xmath67     inverse of the @xmath20-dependent symmetry coefficient as a function of @xmath58 .",
