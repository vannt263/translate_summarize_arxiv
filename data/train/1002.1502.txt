    "in general , attractive interactions promote ordered phases or condensates , whereas long ranged repulsions inhibit this tendency , fundamentally redefining the system s free energy leading to complex phases that break translational and/or rotational symmetry .",
    "such mesoscopic ordering occurs in a very diverse range of materials @xcite , from the pasta phase in neutron stars @xcite , highly correlated quantum hall and strongly correlated electron systems such as high @xmath0 superconductors @xcite to classical systems @xcite such as ferromagnetic films , diblock copolymers , colloids @xcite , and biological systems .",
    "it has also been suggested @xcite that competing interactions can also cause frustration , leading to exotic nonergodic disordered states . in the above examples , the system is able to relax on mesoscopic lengthscales",
    "; it is rather rare to see metastable disorder at the local level .",
    "such disordered states were however reported for laponite suspensions , where electrostatic repulsions compete with van der waals attractions , but the anisotropic particles and interactions make the situation rather complex @xcite .",
    "spheres with a hard core repulsion and an attraction have long provided a model which captures the essence of atoms and small molecules .",
    "short - ranged attractions lead to gelation due to arrested phase separation @xcite . at higher densities both hard - sphere and attractive glasses",
    "are found [ fig .",
    "1(g ) ] @xcite , along with gels @xcite .",
    "long - range repulsions can lead to glasses at low densities @xcite , and combined with short - ranged attractions , the behavior is very rich and complex .",
    "indeed , many properties of biological materials may be connected , fundamentally , to a short - range attraction and longer - ranged repulsion due to electrostatic charging from immersion in an aqueous medium @xcite . for example",
    "globular proteins are rather well described as spheres with short - ranged attractions and long - ranged repulsions @xcite .",
    "while most biological systems are much more complex than spheres with competing interactions , it is clearly important to understand this seemingly simple addition to well - studied models of atoms , not least as it offers insight into transitions between metastable states .",
    "since competing interactions lead to frustration between phase separation and homogeneity , a characteristic lengthscale is often predicted from computer simulation , for example , periodic lamellae @xcite or low - dimensional clusters of a specific size @xcite .",
    "these may then undergo hierarchical self - organization ; in particular , clusters may themselves be implicated in gelation @xcite and undergo dynamical arrest to form a ` cluster glass ' @xcite . despite recent developments @xcite , experimental work in colloidal systems with competing interactions has so far found little evidence of periodic structures , although gels with novel structures @xcite and low - dimensional clusters @xcite have been seen .",
    "we consider spherical colloids ( diameter @xmath1 ) immersed in a solvent , with a relatively strong , long - range electrostatic repulsion , and a short - range , tuneable attraction mediated by non - adsorbing polymer in which the strength of the attraction is set by the polymer concentration @xmath2 , and the range by the polymer size , in this case the polymer - colloid size ratio @xmath3 ( see appendix ) .",
    "we determined the attractions in a very similar system @xcite , and the magnitude of the electrostatic repulsions from fitting the structure of equilibrium fluids @xcite which gave a colloid charge number of @xmath4 ( see appendix ) . according to mode - coupling theory for yukawa systems @xcite ,",
    "for our parameters we expect a transition to a wigner glass at comparable colloid volume fractions to those observed experimentally .",
    "mixing the samples prior to imaging leads to a randomized initial state , after which the tuned interactions and colloid volume fraction @xmath5 lead the system to a ( metastable ) point on the state diagram ( fig .",
    "[ figphasediagram ] ) .",
    "we sometimes see the formation of a wigner crystal state at high @xmath6 and low @xmath2 ; however , this is a rare event [ see fig .",
    "1(f ) ] and usually the system forms a metastable glassy state before crystallization can occur ( see appendix ) .",
    "using real space structural and dynamical analysis , we find a state diagram dominated by three types of glassy states with different disordered structures : wigner glassy state , cluster glassy state , and gel .",

    "i.e. _ , passing from the wigner to the cluster glassy state is a crossover rather than a sharp transition : particles start to form small clusters above a certain threshold @xmath2 and their size gradually increases with an increase in @xmath2 .",
    "the gradual development of the peak at contact ( at @xmath37 ) in the @xmath29 [ fig .",
    "[ figg](a ) ] further supports this observation .",
    "note that the emergence of the peak at contact is a direct consequence of attractions . in equilibrium , the repulsive wigner state ( comprised of monomers )",
    "is expected to be a crystal .",
    "the same can apply to states of _ monodisperse _ clusters @xcite , however here the clusters are very polydisperse [ see fig .",
    "[ figphasediagram](a ) and appendix ] , which leads to self - generated disorder , and intrinsically suppresses crystallization .",
    "this source of disorder is a consequence of a two - level organizational hierarchy , of colloids forming clusters and then clusters forming a glass which may be characteristic of a system of competing interactions with different lengthscales .",

    "this concerns the transition from a state of high potential energy , a tightly bound cluster of charged particles , to a smaller cluster , via cluster fission .",
    "we never observed any cluster fusion , and particle tracking shows a continuous rise in the population of small clusters as a function of time .",
    "the emission process occurs in less than @xmath46 of the characteristic diffusion time , a much faster timescale than structural relaxation even in the absence of slow dynamics .",
    "this phenomenon is illustrated in figs .",

    "this cluster state suffers from a complex minimization problem involving the spatial distributions of colloids , counterions and polymers .",

    "we have determined the colloid charge at low @xmath5 and @xmath9 . using the parameters we calculate for the colloid charge , for this system we expect a potential at contact of several hundred @xmath47 , substantially in excess of the attractive forces mediated by the depletion attraction , @xmath48 @xmath47 for @xmath36 @xmath49 at which we find clustering and gelation ( see appendix ) .",
    "we believe that the charge is associated with the free surfaces of the colloids , and that clusters may have a markedly lower charge per colloid than do the isolated particles @xcite .",
    "calculations show that for such anisotropic charge distributions , the electrostatic repulsion is much reduced , enabling the clustering and gelation we observe @xcite .",
    "in closing , we found that the introduction of relatively strong , long - ranged repulsions to a colloidal dispersion with short - range attractions , generates novel glassy states , such as the cluster glassy state , and drastically transforms behavior , at that most fundamental of levels : the ability of the system to relax locally .",
    "for a system of short - ranged attractive interactions , without strong , long - ranged repulsions , it is possible to distinguish the repulsive hard - sphere glass and the attractive glass , as depicted in fig .",
    "[ figphasediagram](g ) @xcite , but there the change in the structure is rather subtle @xcite .",
    "in contrast , the transitions between cluster glassy and gel states and between wigner glassy and gel states both accompany significant structural changes from single particle to compact clusters and a percolating network , respectively .",
    "the observed behavior can be interpretted as the interplay of a wigner glassy state dominated by the long - range repulsions with formation of clusters driven by short - range attractions @xcite and their percolation for gelation . like the neutral system",
    ", there appear to be two drivers of arrest : the gel is driven by attractions and both wigner and cluster glassy states are driven by repulsion .",
    "the effect of long - ranged repulsions on the state diagram of a system with short - ranged attractions is an interesting fundamental problem ; at intermediate repulsions a cluster fluid emerges @xcite .",

    "we have used a polymer of @xmath51 .",
    "here we used a ` good ' solvent , and in detailed studies using the same solvent - polymer mixture , we found good agreement with the asakura - oosawa ( ao ) theory @xcite , assuming polymer swelling such that the radius of gyration @xmath56 is increased by 35% .",
    "we therefore assumed a similar degree of swelling here , such that @xmath57 nm , leading to a polymer - colloid size ratio @xmath58 , which sets the range of the attractive interaction . for the dilute polymer regime , little deviation",
    "is expected from ao theory @xcite , even in the case of some polymer swelling ( non - ideality ) @xcite .",
    "furthermore , although we add sufficient polymer that some of our samples are just into the semi - dilute regime , relatively little deviation is expected from ao theory for these parameters @xcite . at the level of this work ,",
    "therefore , we treat the attractions with ao theory which leads to a pair interaction between two hard colloidal spheres in a solution of ideal polymers which reads @xmath59 where @xmath60 is @xmath61 .",
    "the polymer fugacity @xmath62 is equal to the number density @xmath63 of ideal polymers in a reservoir at the same chemical potential as the colloid - polymer mixture .",
    "this corresponds to a contact potential of 7.0 @xmath47 per @xmath64 of polymer reservoir concentration .",
    "determining the electrostatic interactions in non - aqueous colloidal dispersions is a non - trivial task @xcite , as the charge and ionic strength are very small , although they still lead to significant interactions .",
    "the interactions have nevertheless been found to be well described by the screened coulomb or yukawa interaction , which reads @xmath65 where @xmath66 is the center to center separation of the two colloids .",
    "the contact potential is given by @xmath67 where @xmath68 is the colloid charge , @xmath69 is the inverse debye screening length and @xmath70 is the bjerrum length",
    ".    one may thus assume interactions between the colloids take the form of a short - range ` depletion ' attraction and long - ranged screened coulomb repulsion , and a nearly hard core .",
    "both have been measured in nearly identical systems and found to be in good agreement with theory @xcite .",
    "here we have determined the colloid charge and ionic strength by comparison of the measured @xmath29 with one obtained from monte carlo simulation according to a yukawa potential @xcite in the ergodic fluid part of the state diagram ( @xmath71 , @xmath9 ) to be @xmath72 @xmath73 where @xmath73 is the elementary unit of charge , and the inverse debye length @xmath74 .",
    "the radial distribution function @xmath29 fitting is shown in sfig .",
    "this method is found to be consistent with electrophoretic measurements @xcite .",
    "the values we obtain for the colloid charge are somewhat ( up to 25% ) higher than those quoted previously in literature where samples were prepared using dry colloids @xcite . for these parameters",
    "mode - coupling theory predicts vitrification at higher volume fractions @xcite .",
    "however , this analysis poses a significant question : the contact potential between two such colloids is @xmath75 .",
    "this is much greater than the strength of the attraction induced by the polymer . throughout the measurements we find that clustering of gelation occurs at a polymer concentration around @xmath76 gl@xmath77 , which corresponds to a contact potential of around 30 @xmath47 [ eq .",
    "( [ eqao ] ) ] .",
    "we are reasonably confident about our understanding of the attraction induced by the polymer @xcite .",
    "we speculate that the charge is in fact different between the isolated colloids upon which measurements of the charge @xmath68 are based and colloids found in clusters , consistent with behavior we observed in a similar cluster - forming system @xcite and values quoted in the literature @xcite .",
    "alternatively , non - pairwise additivity with these long - ranged repulsions leading to a reduction in apparent repulsion may play an important role @xcite . in all of these cases , the quoted values for the repulsive interactions are stronger than the depletion induced attractions .",
    "pointers to an understanding of the underlying cause for this discrepancy may be found in measurements that indicate a reduction in charge per colloid upon clustering @xcite . moreover , if this charge were inhomogeneously distributed , a further reduction in repulsions is to be expected @xcite upon which clustering due to polymer - induced attractions is not unreasonable .",
    "further work is in progress to elucidate the charging mechanism , and possible charge anisotropy , however , we note that the weak levels of electrostatic charging in these apolar systems severely hamper a full understanding",
    ".    however , the strength of the depletion interaction , as gauged by its strength at contact [ eq . ( [ eqao ] ) ] is rather stronger here than in systems where the charge is screened @xcite . comparing the minimum polymer concentration required to form a gel , we find around a contact potential of @xmath78 .",
    "when the electrostatic repulsions are screened one finds @xmath79 for attractions of comparable range ( q=0.18 ) @xcite , rising slightly to @xmath80 for shorter - ranged attractions @xcite .",
