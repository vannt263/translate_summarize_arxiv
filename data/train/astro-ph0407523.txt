    "polars or am her systems are accreting binary systems in which material transfers from a dwarf secondary star onto a magnetic ( @xmath010200 mg ) white dwarf through roche lobe overflow .",
    "they vary in brightness over the binary orbital period , which is synchronised with the spin period of the white dwarf .",
    "it has become clear that the accretion flow in these systems is highly variable from one orbital cycle to the next . in eclipsing polars ,",
    "once the secondary star has completely eclipsed the white dwarf , the accretion flow between the stars is still visible for a short time . in the optical this eclipse profile",
    "is seen to vary from cycle to cycle ( eg hu aqr , bridge et al 2002 and ep dra , bridge et al 2003 ) .    in the case of ep dra , which has an orbital period of 104.8 min , bridge et al ( 2003 )",
    "attributed the varying eclipse profile to a variation in the amount and location of bright material in the accretion stream .",
    "they also found a depression or ` trough ' like feature starting at @xmath10.9 in some cycles .",
    "bridge et al proposed that the accretion material makes a wide accretion curtain which feeds many magnetic field lines before accreting onto the white dwarf .",
    "this should result in the x - ray pre - eclipse spectrum being harder than the post - eclipse spectrum .",
    "ep dra was included in the _ xmm - newton_-mssl survey of polars ( ramsay & cropper 2003 ) .",
    "the integrated bright phase fluxes in the soft and hard x - ray bands have already been presented by ramsay & cropper ( 2004 ) who showed that it had a spectrum consistent with the standard accretion model of lamb & masters ( 1979 ) and king & lasota ( 1979 ) . here",
    "we present energy resolved light curves and phase resolved spectroscopy of ep dra with an emphasis on determining how the absorption varies through the orbital cycle .",
    "ep dra was observed using _ xmm - newton _ ( jansen et al 2001 ) on 2002 october 18 ( _ xmm - newton _ orbit 523 ) , approximately two years after the optical observations of bridge et al ( 2003 ) .",
    "a summary of the observations is given in table  [ tab : obs ] . the epic - mos ( turner et al 2001 ) start time is earlier than that of the epic - pn ( strder et al 2001 ) , and the observation is slightly longer in duration .",
    "observations with the optical monitor ( mason et al 2001 ) were carried out in three filter bands : the @xmath2-band , uvw1 ( 2400@xmath33400 ) and uvw2 ( 1800@xmath32400 ) .",
    "the source counts were extracted from an aperture of 29@xmath4 for the epic - pn and 44@xmath4 for the epic - mos , centred on the source , and the backgrounds were extracted from annuli around the source aperture of radii 98@xmath4 for epic - pn and 147@xmath4 for epic - mos ( the particle background increased toward the end of the observation ) .",
    "the data were processed using the _ xmm - newton _ science analysis software version 5.4 . at its brightest point ( @xmath5 ) ,",
    "the @xmath2-band magnitude is 16.6 .",
    "this is comparable with that of @xmath6 of schwope & mengel ( 1997 ) and the optical observations of bridge et al ( 2003 ) indicating that ep  dra was in a similar , high , accretion state .",

    "the soft x - ray light curve ( figure [ phase ] ) shows a general and gradual decrease in flux from the start of the bright phase , leading up to a prominent dip when the flux is consistent with zero . in hard x - rays",
    "there is a sudden drop in flux to the pre - eclipse dip .",
    "this implies that while the accretion flow becomes attached over a wide range of magnetic field lines ( bridge et al 2003 ) , there is a dense , well defined , ` core ' of absorption .",
    "what makes ep dra unusual is the depth of the dip in the hard band , implying that the dense core has an unusually high column depth .",
    "ramsay et al ( 2004 ) estimated the depth of the absorption column in gg leo and found that it was different depending on whether it was determined using soft x - rays or in the uv . to estimate the absorption column that would be needed to produce the observed drop in count rate ( the mean count rate in each band between @xmath7=0.930.97 ) , we took the pre - eclipse spectrum (  [ spectra ] ) and increased the absorption column to obtain the observed decrease in count rate for soft x - rays , hard x - rays and the uv bands . for the x - ray data we increased the neutral absorption model component , while for the uv data we used the uvred model within xspec ( this is necessary as the neutral absorber model component does not extend to uv energies ) .",
    "we use the relationship between optical extinction and total absorption column of bohlin , savage & drake ( 1978 ) .",
    "we note that this is likely to be a lower limit since the uvred model assumes a large fraction of the uv absorption is caused by dust , which is unlikely to be present in the accretion stream .",
    "we find we need a column depth of 12@xmath8 @xmath9 in the uv bands , 8@xmath10 @xmath9for 0.150.5kev and @xmath11 @xmath9for 210kev bands : they are clearly inconsistent",
    ".    a solution may be that different absorption components should be applied to the various emission components .",
    "this is not surprising since the line of sight to the reprocessed emission site ( which produces a significant fraction of the soft x - ray flux , ramsay & cropper 2004 ) will be different to the line of sight to the post - shock accretion region ( which produces all of the harder x - rays ) . the uv emission",
    ", will again have a different line of sight .",
    "however , almost all investigators when fitting x - ray spectra of polars have modelled their spectra assuming that the same absorption component can be used to model the absorption of each of the emission components .    to investigate this further , we fitted the post - eclipse spectrum with a model which applied separate absorption components to the blackbody and the stratified emission region and also a model which applied the same absorption model to both emission components ( as in  [ spectra ] ) .",
    "we applied one neutral absorption component to both to account for interstellar absorption .",
    "we find that the former ( physically more realistic ) model gives a better fit ( = 1.33 , 92dof ) compared to the latter model ( = 1.53 , 94dof ) at a significance level of greater than 99.9 percent .",
    "further , we find that the blackbody emission component requires one absorption component , while the stratified emission region component requires two absorption components ( with different column densities and covering fractions ) .",
    "ramsay et al ( 2004 ) determined the mass of the white dwarf in 3 polars using _ xmm - newton _ data the same stratified emission model as used here .",
    "they found that if they restricted the energy range to 310kev rather than the full 0.210kev range they determined less massive white dwarfs .",
    "this was due to the fact that absorption plays an important role at lower energies and therefore there maybe some degeneracy between the level of absorption and the slope of the stratified emission model .",
    "however , ramsay et al ( 2004 ) also noted that the fits to the 310kev spectra were poorer compared to the fits made using the full energy range and suggested that this may be due to the absorption being more complex than applying the same absorption model to both the blackbody and stratified emission models .",
    "here we find that separate absorption models should be applied to each emission component .",
    "this would have implications for the resulting mass of the white dwarf .",
    "as the accretion flow leaves the secondary star it falls under gravity towards the white dwarf until the magnetic pressure of the white dwarf balances the ballistic pressure of the in - falling material . in reality a treatment of the transition between the ballistic and the magnetic dominated region is not simple .",
    "different parts of the accretion stream material will therefore satisfy this condition at different points along the ballistic trajectory .",
    "the actual location of threading for a particular part of the accretion stream will depend upon the density of the material , and the orientation of the magnetic field lines relative to the in - falling material .",
    "this means that the material will not all be be threaded by the magnetic field at the same point ( see , for example , liebert & stockman 1985 , mukai 1988 , heerlein , horne & schwope 1999 ) .",
    "evidence for material being coupled on to field lines covering a range in magnetic azimuth has long been available ( eg ferrario , tuohy & wickramasinghe 1989 ) .",
    "these _ xmm - newton _ observations show that in ep dra , the extent in phase of the soft x - ray absorption seen prior to the eclipse centre indicates that the accretion stream attaches onto a wide range of magnetic field lines of the white dwarf and is able to obscure the x - ray emission site for a significant fraction of the orbit .",
    "the stream does , however , have a dense and well defined core .",
    "in contrast , in hu aqr , schwope et al ( 2001 ) show that material is accreted over a narrower range of azimuth .",
    "the fact that the main stream dip is located very shortly before the eclipse , @xmath10.944 or an azimuth of @xmath12 , implies that the most dense part of the stream becomes attached to the magnetic field lines at a point relatively distant from the white dwarf .",
    "we can compare this to the phase of the prominent dip seen in hu aqr .",
    "this has been extensively observed using x - ray instruments and the azimuth of the main dip has been seen to vary from 3450@xmath13 .",
    "this implies that the main accretion stream in ep dra is coupled by the magnetic field further from the white dwarf compared to hu aqr . in the standard accretion flow model",
    "the point at which the stream gets attached by the magnetic field is the point at which the magnetic pressure equals the ram pressure of the stream ( cf mukai 1988 ) .",
    "the location of this point is thought to be relatively weakly dependent on the mass transfer rate and the mass of the white dwarf .",
    "it is more likely to be dependent on the magnetic moment ( @xmath14 ) of the white dwarf and the angle that the magnetic axis makes with the spin axis of the white dwarf , @xmath15 .",
    "the magnetic field strength of the white dwarf in hu aqr is 36 mg ( glenn et al 1994 ) while in ep dra it is 16 mg ( schwope & mengel 1997 ) .",
    "for the coupling point to be further from the white dwarf in ep dra compared to hu aqr this would imply that the white dwarf in ep dra is significantly less massive ( larger radii and hence greater @xmath16 ) compared to hu aqr . in  [ the_eclipse ]",
    "we estimate @xmath17=0.50@xmath18for an inclination of @xmath19  this compares with @xmath17=1@xmath18for hu aqr ( schwope et al 2001 ) .    for high angles of @xmath15 ,",
    "the stream travels further before it feels the effect of the magnetic field .",
    "support for a high @xmath15 angle in ep dra may be found in the peak of the x - ray bright phase : with the eclipse center fixed on @xmath7=0.0 , the center of the hard x - ray bright phase ( defined as the mid point between the rise and end of the bright phase ) is @xmath7=0.02 .",
    "this implies the accretion region is behind the line of centers joining the two stars .",
    "this is unusual since cropper ( 1988 ) found that in most systems the bright phase leads the secondary and has a mean azimuth of @xmath12 .",
    "high signal to noise polarimetric data should be able to determine the co - latitude of the accretion region .",
    "we have presented x - ray energy resolved and optical / uv light curves of the eclipsing polar ep dra .",
    "they show a prominent dip in x - rays and in the uv which is due to the accretion stream obscuring the accretion region on the white dwarf .",
    "our modelling of the x - ray spectra taken before and after the eclipse of the secondary provides evidence that accretion material attaches on to the magnetic field lines along a wide arc along the ballistic trajectory supporting the suggestion of bridge et al ( 2003 ) .",
    "we find that the level of absorption needed to account for the pre - eclipse absorption dip is much greater in hard x - rays compared to softer x - rays .",
    "we suggest that one factor which may cause this effect is that the line of sight to the emission sites producing soft x - rays , hard x - rays and uv is different .",
    "we test this by fitting such a model to the x - ray data and find that a better fit is achieved compared to using an absorption model which is applied to both emission components .",
    "this has implications for fits to the continuum spectra of polars .",
    "this is work based on observations obtained with _ xmm - newton _ , an esa science mission with instruments and contributions directly funded by esa member states and the usa ( nasa ) .",
