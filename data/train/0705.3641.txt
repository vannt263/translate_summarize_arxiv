    "geometric transitions have proven to be an essential part of understanding string theory and strongly coupled quantum field theories .",
    "it has also become evident that such transitions will play a central role in understanding the geometry of microstates of the three - charge black hole or black ring in five dimensions .",
    "indeed , one can argue @xcite that a very large number of horizonless three - charge brane configurations , when brought to strong effective coupling , undergo a geometric transition and become smooth horizonless geometries with black - hole or black - ring charges .",
    "the black hole and black ring charges come entirely from fluxes wrapping topologically non - trivial cycles , or bubbles .",
    "all these `` bubbling black hole '' geometries are dual to states of the conformal field theory describing the three - charge black hole , and",
    "their physics strongly supports the idea that black holes in string theory are not fundamental objects , but rather effective thermodynamic descriptions of a huge number of horizonless configurations ( see @xcite for a review ) .    the simplest starting point for the construction of three - charge geometries is m - theory , where one takes the eleven - dimensional supersymmetric metrics to have the form @xcite : @xmath4 the six coordinates , @xmath5 , parameterize the compactification torus , @xmath6 , and the five - dimensional space - time metric has the form : @xmath7 when constructing black - hole or black - ring solutions @xcite ,",
    "the spatial `` base metric , '' @xmath8 , is usually taken to be that of flat @xmath9 , however supersymmetry is preserved if one has any hyper - khler metric on the the base @xcite .    to construct bubbling solutions corresponding to five - dimensional black holes and black rings , the asymptotic structure of @xmath8 must still be that of @xmath9 and the conventional wisdom suggested that this implies that the hyper - khler base metric must be flat @xmath9 , globally .",
    "the breakthrough came via @xcite , where it was realized that the base metric could be `` ambi - polar , '' that is , it could change its overall signature from @xmath10 to @xmath11 in some regions .",
    "the warp factors , @xmath12 , are also singular and change sign , but the complete five - dimensional ( or eleven - dimensional ) solution is still a physical , lorentzian metric .",
    "this opens up a vast number of new possibilities for constructing bubbling black holes using four - dimensional hyper - khler base metrics .",
    "the construction of the most general solutions proceeds in several steps using the linear system of `` bps equations '' @xcite .",
    "one first chooses the ambi - polar , hyper - khler base metric .",
    "this base will generically have non - trivial two - cycles ( `` bubbles '' ) with moduli that determine the size and orientation of the cycles",
    ". dual to these bubbles are normalizable , self - dual , harmonic two - forms ( the compact cohomology ) .",
    "there are also three non - normalizable , anti - self - dual , harmonic two - forms and these correspond to the three complex structures of the hyper - khler base .",
    "the normalizable harmonic two - forms determine the electromagnetic fluxes , which in turn source the warp factors , @xmath12 . finally , the warp factors and the fluxes combine to give the source in the linear equation for the angular momentum vector , @xmath13 , in ( [ fivemetric ] ) .",
    "this procedure is easiest implemented when one considers ambi - polar gibbons - hawking ( gh ) metrics , which are hyper - khler metrics with a tri - holomorphic @xmath0 symmetry preserves all three complex structures of the hyper - khler metric . ] .",
    "all five - dimensional , supersymmetric solutions with gibbons - hawking base can be written in terms of several harmonic functions @xcite ; choosing an ambi - polar gh metric ( with positive and negative gh charges ) and specific harmonic functions ensures that the resulting `` bubbling '' solutions are horizonless , smooth , and have black hole and black ring charges @xcite .    at the last step of the construction ,",
    "some of the moduli of the bubbles have to be fixed so as to remove closed time - like curves ( ctc s ) .",
    "this step has a simple , physical interpretation : the ambi - polar base metric typically arises because one has used both positive and negative geometric charges ( _ e.g. _ gh charges ) that tend to attract one another and would cause the space to collapse if they were not stabilized in some manner .",
    "if one seeks bps solutions without including any physical stabilizing mechanism , the instability will manifest itself through the appearance of closed time - like curves ( ctc s ) . on the other hand",
    ", a flux threading a cycle tends to cause that cycle to expand .",
    "hence , by distributing fluxes on the space one can balance the attraction of the geometric charges against the expansion caused by fluxes .",
    "the bubbles thus settle down at a size where the attractive and expansion forces cancel and the result is a stable bps solution free of ctc s .",
    "one generically finds that the sizes of the bubbles are set in terms of the fluxes threading them .",
    "other bubble moduli , like orientations , remain free .",
    "the equations that express this balance of fluxes and bubble sizes are called the `` bubble equations '' @xcite .    studying solutions that have an ambi - polar gibbons - hawking base",
    "has quite a few advantages : the construction of these solutions is straightforward , the solutions can be related to four - dimensional , multi - centered `` d6 - @xmath14 '' solutions @xcite , they can arise from the geometric transition of circular three - charge supertubes @xcite , and they can describe microstates both of zero - entropy black holes and black rings @xcite , or of black holes and black rings with macroscopic horizons @xcite .    despite the remarkable results that have been obtained using gibbons - hawking geometries , such metrics represent a major restriction .",
    "in particular , they all have a translational ( tri - holomorphic ) @xmath0 isometry @xcite , which is a combination of the two @xmath0 s in the @xmath15 planes that make up the @xmath9 in the asymptotic region necessarily lies in one of the @xmath16 factors of @xmath17 . ] .",
    "thus , bubbling solutions with a gh base can not capture quite a host of interesting physical processes that do not respect this symmetry , like the merger of two bmpv black holes , or the geometric transition of a three - charge supertube of arbitrary shape .",
    "in @xcite it was argued that this geometric transition results in bubbling solutions that have an ambi - polar hyper - khler base , and that depend on a very large number of arbitrary continuous functions .",
    "counting these solutions is a way to prove the general conjecture that black holes are ensembles of smooth horizonless configurations .",
    "it is therefore of great interest to construct and understand them .    in this paper",
    "we will take a step in this direction by considering such metrics that also have a general @xmath0 isometry .",
    "these metrics are much less restrictive than gh - based metrics .",
    "moreover , they could also arise from the geometric transition of supertubes that preserve a rotational @xmath0 , and hence could also depend on an arbitrarily large number of continuous functions .",
    "constructing and counting such solutions is also of interest in the program to prove that black holes are ensembles of smooth horizonless configurations .",
    "even if the entropy in these symmetric configurations will be smaller than the entropy of the black hole , it might give some insight into the structure and charge dependence of the most general , non - symmetric configuration .",
    "an important feature of all bubbled solutions is that the ambi - polar base space and the fluxes dual to the homology are singular on the critical surfaces where the metric changes sign . for ambi - polar gh spaces it was possible to use the explicit solutions to show that all these singularities were canceled and the final result was a regular , five - dimensional space - time background in m - theory .",
    "our analysis here will illustrate how this happens for the general @xmath0-invariant bubbled background , and this work suggests that the most general bubbling geometries will have also this property .    before beginning",
    ", we would like to stress that constructing solutions that only have a rotational @xmath0 is a rather tedious and challenging task . for classical black holes and black rings ,",
    "only two such solutions exist : one describing a black ring with an arbitrary charge density @xcite , and one describing a black ring with a black hole away from the center of the ring @xcite .",
    "in this paper we will succeed in constructing the first explicit _ bubbling _ solution in this class , using a base that is a generalization of the atiyah - hitchin metric .",
    "nevertheless , the most general bubbling solutions that only have a rotational @xmath0 invariance will be much more complicated , and perhaps even impossible to write down explicitly .",
    "it has been known for a long time that hyper - khler metrics with a generic ( rotational ) @xmath0 isometry can be obtained by solving the @xmath18 toda equation @xcite .",
    "the coordinates can be chosen so that the metric takes the form : @xmath19 with @xmath20 for @xmath21 and @xmath22 for some function , @xmath23 .",
    "the function , @xmath24 , and the vector field , @xmath25 , are given by @xmath26 and the function @xmath23 must satisfy : @xmath27 this equation is called the @xmath18 toda equation , and may be viewed as a continuum limit of the @xmath28 toda equation .",
    "even though the @xmath18 toda equation is integrable , surprisingly little is know about its solutions , and there appears to be no known analog of the known soliton solutions of the @xmath28 toda equation . on the other hand ,",
    "the metric is determined in terms of a single function and ( [ todametric ] ) is a relatively mild generalization of the gibbons - hawking metrics .",
    "our purpose here is to construct three - charge solutions based upon ambi - polar hyper - khler metrics with generic ( non - tri - holomorphic ) @xmath0 isometries .",
    "we will do this in two different ways , first by building such solutions using a general metric of the form ( [ todametric ] ) on the base space .",
    "we will then consider the atiyah - hitchin metric : this metric has an @xmath29 isometry , but none of the @xmath0 subgroups is tri - holomorphic .",
    "just as with the gh metric , the metric ( [ todametric ] ) , is ambi - polar if we allow @xmath30 to change sign .",
    "thus the primary issue of regularity in the five - dimensional metric arises on the _ critical surfaces _ where @xmath31 . while we will not be able to construct general solutions as explicitly as can be done for gh metrics",
    ", we will show that the five - dimensional metric is regular and lorentzian in the neighborhood of these critical surfaces .",
    "the standard atiyah - hitchin metric @xcite arises as the solution of a first order , non - linear darboux - halphen system for the three metric coefficient functions .",
    "this system is analytically solvable in terms of the solution of a single , second order linear differential equation .",
    "indeed , the solutions of the latter equation are expressible in terms of elliptic functions .",
    "the standard practice is to choose the solution of this linear equation so that the metric functions are regular , and the result is a smooth geometry that closes off at a non - trivial `` bolt , '' or two - cycle in the center .",
    "we will show that if one selects the most general solution of the linear differential equation , then one obtains an ambi - polar generalization of the atiyah - hitchin metric .",
    "moreover , one can set up regular , cohomological fluxes on the two - cycle and the resulting warp factors render the five - dimensional metric perfectly smooth and regular across the critical surface .",
    "the ambi - polar atiyah - hitchin metric actually continues through the bolt and initially appears to have two regions , one on each side of the bolt , that are asymptotic to @xmath32 .",
    "it thus looks like a wormhole .",
    "unfortunately , the solution can not be made regular on _ both _ its asymptotic regions .",
    "indeed , upon imposing asymtotic flatness on one side of the wormhole , one finds that the warp factors change sign twice , once on the critical surface and again as one enters one of the asymptotic regions .",
    "thus the critical surface is regular , but there is another potentially singular region elsewhere .",
    "however , we find that if we tune the flux through the bubble to exactly the proper value , one can pinch off the metric just as the warp factors change sign for the second time .",
    "the result is a lorentzian metric , that extends smoothly through the critical surface ( @xmath31 ) . the pinching off of the metric does however result in a curvature singularity that is very similar to the one encountered in the klebanov - tseytlin solution @xcite .",
    "we will argue that the singularity of our new , non - trivial bps solution is also a consequence of the very high level of symmetry , and that it will be resolved via a mechanism similar to that in @xcite .",
    "we also consider solutions based upon an ambi - polar generalization of the eguchi - hanson metric , obtained by making an analytic continuation of the standard eguchi - hanson metric , and extending the range of one of the coordinates .",
    "the singular structure of this metric is precisely what is needed to render it ambi - polar .",
    "hence , upon adding fluxes and warp factors this metric gives us regular five - dimensional solutions that have similar features to the bubling atiyah - hitchin solution .",
    "there is also one surprise : one of the eguchi - hanson `` wormhole '' solutions is completely regular everywhere and is nothing other than the global @xmath33 robinson - bertotti solution .    in section 3",
    "we will review the bps equations and discuss their solution for a metric with a generic @xmath0 isometry . in section 4",
    "we will review the properties and structure of the atiyah - hitchin metric .",
    "section 5 is devoted to the explicit solution of the system of bps equations for the atiyah - hitchin metric and its ambi - polar generalization , and a discussion on regularity and ctc s . in section 6",
    "we present the bubbled solutions on the generalized ( ambi - polar ) eguchi - hanson background and we show how they closely parallel the results for the generalized ( ambi - polar ) atiyah - hitchin solution .",
    "we also show how to obtain _ global _ @xmath33 as a bubbling eguchi - hanson solution .",
    "finally , section 7 contains our conclusions and a discussion of possible future work .",
    "the supersymmetric , bps solutions to m - theory with metric given by ( [ elevenmetric ] ) have maxwell three - form potential given by : @xmath34 where the @xmath35 , @xmath36 , are one - form maxwell potentials in the five - dimensional space - time and depend only upon the coordinates , @xmath37 , @xmath38 , that parameterize the spatial directions of @xmath39 .",
    "it is convenient to introduce the maxwell `` dipole field strengths , ''",
    "@xmath40 , obtained by removing the contributions of the electrostatic potentials : @xmath41 the most general supersymmetric configuration is then obtained by solving the _ bps equations _ : @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the hodge dual taken with respect to the four - dimensional base metric , @xmath8 , and for the structure constants are given by @xmath44 .",
    "the _ bps equations _",
    "generalize trivially to more general @xmath45 five - dimensional ungauged supergravities .",
    "the first step in solving this linear system is to identify the self - dual , harmonic two - forms , @xmath40 . in a khler manifold",
    "this is , at least theoretically , straightforward because such two - forms are related to the moduli of the metric . for a hyper - khler metric",
    "there are three complex structures , @xmath46 , @xmath47 , and given a harmonic two - form , @xmath48 , one can define three symmetric tensors via : @xmath49 these tensors may be viewed as metric perturbations and as such they represent perturbations that preserve the hyper - khler structure . in particular , they are zero modes of the lichnerowicz operator .    for the metric ( [ todametric ] )",
    "it is convenient to introduce vierbeins : @xmath50 and introduce a basis for the self - dual and anti - self dual two forms : @xmath51 the three khler forms are then given by @xcite : @xmath52 and they satisfy the proper quaternionic algebra : @xmath53 following @xcite , we make an ansatz for the harmonic , self - dual field strengths , @xmath40 : @xmath54 where the dot represents derivative with respect to @xmath55 .",
    "we then find that the @xmath56 must satisfy the linearized toda equation ( it follows from ( [ todaeqn ] ) that @xmath57 also solves this equation ) : @xmath58 for later convenience , we note that there are relatively simple vector potentials such that @xmath59 : @xmath60 where @xmath61 hence , @xmath62 is a vector potential for magnetic monopoles located at the singular points of @xmath63 .",
    "since the @xmath56 satisfy the linearized toda equation , we see the direct relationship between the harmonic forms and linearized fluctuations of the metric . in practice , ( [ fluctuations ] ) and ( [ thetaform ] ) do not yield exactly the same result as the direct substitution of fluctuations in @xmath23 into ( [ todametric ] ) but they are equivalent up to infinitesimal diffeomorphisms .",
    "for example , the metric fluctuation obtained from using ( [ thetaform ] ) and @xmath64 in ( [ fluctuations ] ) is identical with the metric fluctuation , @xmath65 , combined with the infinitesimal diffeomorphism , @xmath66 .",
    "the second bps equation reduces to : @xmath67 where @xmath68 is the three - metric in ( [ threemetric ] ) and @xmath69 is given by : @xmath70 the operator , @xmath71 , denotes the laplacian in the metric @xmath68 .",
    "the natural guess for the solution is to follow , once again , @xcite and try : @xmath72 one then finds that @xmath73 is not a solution of the homogeneous equation , but @xmath74 intriguingly , one can also check that : @xmath75 where @xmath76 is the linearized toda operator ( [ lintoda ] ) and so one has the explicit solution but to the wrong equation .    the important point",
    ", however , is that the source on the right - hand side of ( [ zzeroeqn ] ) is regular as @xmath77 , and so @xmath73 is regular on any critical surface where one has @xmath78 .    to solve the last bps equation for the angular momentum vector , @xmath13",
    ", we make the ansatz : @xmath79 where @xmath48 is a one form in the three - dimensional space defined by @xmath80 .",
    "define yet another linear operator : @xmath81 and then one finds that @xmath82 and @xmath48 must satisfy : @xmath83 and @xmath84 note that the integrability of the equation for @xmath48 is precisely the equation ( [ mueqn ] ) for @xmath82 , provided that one also uses the fact that @xmath23 satisfies ( [ todaeqn ] ) .",
    "the structure of these equations also closely parallels those encountered for a gh base metric @xcite .",
    "once again one can try a form of the solution based upon the results for gh spaces .",
    "define @xmath85 by : @xmath86 and one then finds that @xmath85 must satisfy : @xmath87 again note that the source is regular as @xmath77 and so @xmath85 will be similarly regular as @xmath77 .",
    "finally , if one substitutes these expressions for @xmath12 and @xmath82 into ( [ omegaeqn ] ) , one obtains : @xmath88 where the @xmath89 means that the last term only appears for @xmath90 . note that @xmath91 has sources that are regular as @xmath77 and so @xmath91 will be regular on critical surfaces .",
    "therefore , in this more general class of metrics , we can not find the solutions to the bps equations as explicitly as one can for gh base metrics .",
    "however , one can completely and explicitly characterize the singular parts of the solutions as one approaches critical surfaces where @xmath77 .",
    "consider the behavior of the metric ( [ fivemetric ] ) as @xmath92 .",
    "the warp factors , @xmath12 diverge as @xmath93 , @xmath82 diverges as @xmath94 and so the only potentially divergent part of the metric is : @xmath95 where @xmath96 every other part of the metric has a finite limit as @xmath97 . since @xmath98 is finite as @xmath99 , we need to show that @xmath100 is finite . using ( [ zzerodefn ] ) and ( [ mures ] ) one",
    "has @xmath101 \\nonumber \\\\    & \\to & \\big(z_1^{(0 ) }   z_2^{(0)}\\ , k^1   k^2 + z_1^{(0 ) }   z_3^{(0)}\\ , k^1   k^3 +    z_2^{(0 ) }   z_3^{(0)}\\ , k^2   k^3\\big ) \\nonumber \\\\    & & \\qquad \\qquad \\qquad~-~ \\coeff{1}{4 } \\ , \\big(\\dot \\nu \\ , z_i^{(0 ) } k^i \\big)^2~-~    2\\ , ( k^1 k^2 k^3)\\,\\mu_0 \\ , ,   \\label{qdivpart}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] as @xmath77 .",
    "thus the metric is finite on the critical surfaces . to avoid ctc s , @xmath100",
    "must also be positive everywhere and , as with solutions on gh base metrics , this will depend upon the details of particular solutions .",
    "the maxwell fields are also regular on the critical surfaces . from ( [ thetaform ] )",
    "we see that the @xmath40 are , in fact , singular on the critical surfaces , however from ( [ thetadefn ] ) and ( [ bpot ] ) we see that the complete maxwell fields are given by : @xmath102 as we remarked earlier , @xmath48 is regular on the critical surfaces and the vectors , @xmath62 , defined by ( [ xidefn ] ) are similarly regular .",
    "the only possible singular terms are thus @xmath103 thus the @xmath35 are regular on the critical surfaces .",
    "we would like the four dimensional base metric to be asymptotic to @xmath9 and there are several ways to arrange this , depending upon how the @xmath0 defined by @xmath104-translations acts in @xmath9 .",
    "the simplest is to take @xmath105 and then : @xmath106 where @xmath107 and @xmath108 .",
    "this metric is that of @xmath109 provided that @xmath104 has period @xmath110 so that @xmath111 has period @xmath112 .",
    "the @xmath0 acts in one of the @xmath15 planes and so this is the natural boundary condition appropriate to a system with this symmetry .",
    "another possible boundary condition is is to require : @xmath113 and then @xmath114 where @xmath115 now set @xmath116 and @xmath117 and one arrives at the metric : @xmath118 where @xmath119 , the @xmath120 are the left invariant one - forms : @xmath121 and @xmath122 . once again , the @xmath0 generated by @xmath104 acts in one of the @xmath15 planes in @xmath123 .    with either of these asymptotic behaviors , the integral :",
    "@xmath124 converges at infinity .",
    "the integrand is manifestly non - negative and if @xmath23 is regular everywhere then we may integrate by parts .",
    "this generates the toda equation , ( [ todaeqn ] ) , and so the integral vanishes .",
    "we therefore conclude that the only solution that is regular on @xmath125 is a constant .",
    "hence , @xmath23 must have singularities on @xmath125 .    while general toda metrics may have complicated singularities , we are interested in metrics that , upon adding fluxes , give rise to smooth bubbling solutions . for gibbons - hawking base metrics ,",
    "one has positive and negative sources ( gh points ) for the metric function , @xmath24 , and pairs of these gh points then define the homology cycles . if one moves sufficiently close to one of these singular points of @xmath24 in a gh metric , then the metric is , in fact , regular and caps off into a piece of @xmath9 ( perhaps divided out by a discrete group ) with @xmath126 rotation symmetry .",
    "guided by this , it is natural to consider singularities in @xmath23 that lead to local geometry that looks like @xmath127 for some integer , @xmath128 , and which locally has an @xmath126 invariance about the singular point .",
    "equivalently , near the singularities of @xmath23 , the toda metric has a @xmath129 symmetry and so can be mapped into a gibbons - hawking form .",
    "thus the interesting class of metrics for bubbling should be those that can be put into gibbons - hawking form in the immediate vicinity of each singular point of @xmath23 .",
    "the non - trivial part of the toda solution then relates to the transitions between these special regions .",
    "one can thus think of the toda function as quilting together a collection of gh pieces .",
    "it is elementary to see from the foregoing that , in the neighborhood of a singular point of charge @xmath130 , one must have : @xmath131 with these choices the metric becomes precisely that of @xmath9 and is positive or negative definite depending on the sign of the charge . by taking the @xmath132 limit in ( [ nuasympb ] )",
    "one can also see that for a point of charge @xmath133 one has @xmath134 .",
    "one can continue to higher charges via a series expansion in @xmath55 but the geometry gets more complicated .",
    "this is because a charge @xmath128 leads to a local geometry that is @xmath127 . in gh spaces",
    "this discrete identification was factored out of the @xmath0 fiber , but in a general toda geometry it will be factored out of the base and so the geometry near the singular points of @xmath23 will involve orbifold points in @xmath125 .",
    "it is therefore simpler to restrict to geometric charges of @xmath135 and take the view that other geometric charges can be obtained via mergers of the more fundamental unit charges .",
    "while we do not yet know how to progress beyond these simple observations , we believe that similar considerations will apply to bubbled geometries constructed from completely general ambi - polar , hyper - khler metrics . in the neighborhood of singular points of the khler potential",
    "they will locally be of gh form and so one might at least construct an approximate description as a quilt of gh patches with transition functions . indeed , with such an approximating metric one might be able to establish existence theorems and perhaps even count moduli in the same manner that yau established the existence of calabi - yau metrics .",
    "the atiyah - hitchin metric has the form @xcite : @xmath136 where the @xmath120 are defined in ( [ sigmadefn ] ) and satisfy @xmath137 . for ( [ ahform ] ) to be hyper - khler , the functions @xmath138 , @xmath139 and @xmath140 must satisfy : @xmath141 where the dot denotes @xmath142 .",
    "this system of equations may be mapped onto a darboux - halphen system by introducing @xmath143 , @xmath144 and @xmath145 .",
    "one then finds @xmath146 to solve this system one first defines a new coordinate , @xmath147 , via @xmath148 where @xmath149 is defined to be the solution of @xmath150 one then finds that the solutions are given by @xcite : @xmath151 where the prime denotes derivative with respect to @xmath147 .",
    "one can find the explicit solution for @xmath149 in terms of elliptic functions : @xmath152 where @xmath153 and @xmath154 are constants and @xmath155 a first order system for three functions like ( [ dhsystem ] ) should involve three constants of integration .",
    "these are represented by @xmath153 , @xmath154 and the trivial freedom to shift @xmath156 by a constant . however , in order to get a regular , positive definite metric one must choose only one of the non - trivial solutions , which is then canonically normalized to : @xmath157 with this choice , the function @xmath158 is non - vanishing on @xmath159 and so the change of variables ( [ thetadefn ] ) is well - defined .",
    "moreover one has @xmath160 , @xmath161 and @xmath162 on @xmath159 and so the metric coefficients : @xmath163 are all positive .",
    "the standard atiyah - hitchin geometry is asymptotic to @xmath164 and has a non - trivial two - cycle , or `` bolt '' in the center . to see this we first look at the structure at infinity , which corresponds to @xmath165 . in this limit",
    "one has : @xmath166 which implies @xmath167 define @xmath168 and then the asymptotic form of the metric becomes : @xmath169 which indeed has the structure of a @xmath0 fibration over @xmath125 .    at the other end of the interval , @xmath170 ,",
    "one finds : @xmath171 define @xmath172 and the metric near @xmath173 has the form : @xmath174 thus we see the `` bolt '' at the origin .",
    "note that the scale of the metric has been fixed and the radius of the bolt has been set to @xmath175 .",
    "the fact that the coefficient of @xmath176 vanishes as @xmath177 also has important implications for the global geometry .",
    "there is a very nice discussion of this in the appendices of @xcite .    for future reference",
    ", we will chose the constant of integration ( [ thetadefn ] ) so that @xmath178 at infinity ( @xmath179 ) and take : @xmath180 with this choice , @xmath156 has the following asymptotic behavior : @xmath181 where @xmath168 .    since there is a non - trivial two - cycle , there must be a non - trivial , dual element of cohomology .",

    "since the base space considered here also has a high level of symmetry , it is tempting to conjecture that , in analogy to the klebanov - strassler solution @xcite , the pinching off will be resolved by the blowing up of a two - cycle on the base , which will only be possible in a less - symmetric , non - singular background .",
    "we should also remark that in our discussion we have taken all three warp factors to be equal , but generically we can also imagine pinching off the metric using only one of the warp factors , and keeping the others finite .",
    "this will change the structure of the metric near the singularity ( some of the two - tori will blow up and some others will shrink ) , but the singularity will also come from shrinking cycles on the base , and will probably be resolved also by considering a less - symmetric base with a blown - up two - cycle",
    "given the foregoing results , particularly those involving wormholes , it is interesting to look at the corresponding story for the eguchi - hanson metric @xcite .",
    "this metric has an @xmath380 invariance and the diagonal @xmath0 action is triholomorphic .",
    "the metric is equivalent to a gh metric with two gh points of equal charge @xcite .",

    "nevertheless , we can extend the coordinate @xmath393 to negative values , and the resulting space ( [ neweh ] ) has two regions , one where the signature is @xmath10 and one where the signature is @xmath11 .",
    "this makes ( [ neweh ] ) into precisely an ambi - polar metric of the type that can give a good five - dimensional bps solution : the overall sign of the metric changes as one passes through @xmath394 , with the coefficient of a @xmath0 fiber becoming singular at this critical surface .      in order to solve the bps equations , ( [ bpseqn:1])([bpseqn:3 ] ) ,",
    "it is convenient to introduce the basis of frames given by : @xmath395 one can then show that : @xmath396 defines a harmonic , self - dual , `` normalizable '' two form for constant @xmath397 .",
    "one also has @xmath398 with @xmath399 .",
    "as before , we take all three flux forms @xmath40 to be equal to @xmath245 and set @xmath400 .",
    "then the equation for @xmath401 becomes @xmath402 which is solved by @xmath403 where @xmath404 and @xmath271 are integration constants .",
    "the angular momentum vector , @xmath13 , has a solution of the form @xmath405 where the function @xmath406 satisfies @xmath407 the solution to this equation is @xmath408 to complete the solution we have to impose boundary condition on the functions @xmath267 and @xmath82 .",
    "if the solution is to have two asymptotic regions corresponding to @xmath409 then we must require that the angular momentum vector falls off in these regions or there will generically be ctc s .",
    "this implies : @xmath410 and then the functions @xmath267 and @xmath82 simplify to : @xmath411 if @xmath412 , @xmath267 will have a zero at @xmath413 and thus we will inevitably have ctc s unless we pinch off the solution before , or at , this point .",
    "we consider @xmath282 first , for which we have : @xmath414 note that the angular momentum function @xmath82 is always positive and is diverging on the critical surface @xmath392 .",
    "the @xmath267 also diverges and changes sign on the critical surface .",
    "this behavior ensures that the five - dimensional metric is regular and lorentzian .",
    "the explicit form of the space - time metric is : @xmath415 this metric can be cast into a more familiar form by first diagonalizing the metric by shifting the @xmath416-coordinate in ( [ sigmadefn ] ) so that @xmath417 : @xmath418 change variables via @xmath419 , @xmath420 and then the metric becomes @xmath421 which is the well known metric for global @xmath422 .",
    "the complete maxwell field on this space is given by @xmath423 and , using @xmath398 with @xmath424 , we find @xmath425 the maxwell field is thus proportional to the volume form on @xmath426 and we have obtained the global form of a robinson - bertotti solution .",
    "the wormhole thus reduces to the usual global ads solution .",
    "in fact the solution based on the singular eh metric ( [ neweh ] ) ( with @xmath427 ) has also been discussed in @xcite , where it was shown to give an @xmath33 solution with the @xmath426 in global coordinates .",
    "what we find very puzzling is the fact that in order to get the _ entire _ range of coordinates for the global @xmath426 metric , one must start from the ambi - polar eh metric with the coordinate @xmath156 running between @xmath428 and @xmath429 .",
    "it is interesting to try to understand the reason for which we could find an eguchi - hanson `` wormhole '' but not an atiyah - hitchin one . at an algebraic level",
    ", the problem comes from the form of @xmath82 , which in the eguchi - hanson background goes to zero on both asymptotic regions ( [ zmuehform ] ) , while in the atiyah - hitchin background @xmath82 , ( [ muegah ] ) , diverges in one region or in the other . if one relaxes the requirement that the atiyah - hitchin solutions be asymptotically flat , one can choose a more generic @xmath245 , containing all three @xmath241 .",
    "however , this still does not give a @xmath82 that decays properly at the two asymptotic regions .      the other way to remove ctc s",
    "is to allow @xmath430 in ( [ zehform ] ) and pinch - off the asymptotic region with @xmath431 at the point , @xmath310 , where @xmath267 vanishes .",
    "this means that we only have to require that @xmath82 vanish as @xmath432 and this implies @xmath433 in ( [ muehform ] ) .    as with the atiyah - hitchin solution , the solution will have ctc s near the pinching off point unless we also require that @xmath82 vanishes at the same point . specifically",
    ", the constant time slices of the metric have the form : @xmath434 and to avoid ctc s we must have @xmath435 if @xmath267 vanishes then @xmath82 must vanish and this imposes a relationship , akin to the bubble equations , on @xmath404 , @xmath397 and @xmath386 .",
    "unlike the corresponding solution in the atiyah - hitchin background , there is still a free parameter in the final result , and if one choses these parameters in the proper ranges one can arrange that the pinch - off occurs at @xmath436 and that there are no ctc s in the region @xmath437 .",
    "there is still , however , a curvature singularity in the metric at @xmath438 , similar to the one in the pinched - off atiyah - hitchin solution , and probably caused also by the fact that the ansatz used is very symmetric .",
    "it is quite likely that this singularity will also be resolved in the same manner as the klebanov - tseylin / klebanov - strassler solutions @xcite    it is easy to find numerical examples that exhibit a `` pinch off . '' for example , one can take the following values of the parameters : @xmath439 and the pinch off point is @xmath440 .",
    "since @xmath310 is negative this represents a solution based upon a non - trivial ambi - polar base metric .",
    "we have investigated the construction of three - charge solutions that do not have a tri - holomorphic @xmath0 isometry .",
    "we have found that the most general form of these solutions , can be expressed in term of several scalar functions .",
    "one of these functions satisfies the ( non - linear ) @xmath18 toda equation , while the other functions satisfy linear equations that can be thought of as various linearizations of the @xmath18 toda equation .",
    "we have also shown generically that in the region where the signature of the four - dimensional base space changes from @xmath10 to @xmath441 , the fluxes , warp factors , and the rotation vector diverge as well , but the overall five - dimensional ( or eleven - dimensional ) solution is smooth .",
    "this is similar to what happens when the base - space is gibbons - hawking , and strongly suggests that this phenomenon is generic : _ any ambi - polar to @xmath441 , such that the three - metric on the critical surface has two vanishing eigenvalues and one divergent eigenvalue . ] , four - dimensional , hyper - khler metric with at least one non - trivial two - cycle can be used to construct a regular supersymmetric five - dimensional three - charge solution upon adding fluxes , warp factors and rotation according to the bps equations ( [ bpseqn:1 ] ) , ( [ bpseqn:2 ] ) and ( [ bpseqn:3 ] ) .",
    "_    this phenomenon is likely to be quite important in the programme of establishing whether black holes are ensembles of smooth supergravity or string solutions . to prove this conjecture",
    ", one would need to construct and count smooth horizonless solutions that have the same charges and angular momenta as three - charge black holes or black rings .",
    "our analysis suggests that this counting problem is in fact much easier , since one would not have to count the full solutions , but just the hyper - khler base spaces underlying them .",
    "it also suggests that we may be able to capture the essential structure of the hyper - khler base by approximating it with a quilt of gh spaces .",
    "since the most general form of hyper - khler , four - dimensional spaces with a rotational @xmath0 isometry is not known explicitly , one can not explicitly construct the most general three - charge bubbling solution with this isometry .",
    "nevertheless , we have been able to construct a first explicit bubbling solution with a rotational @xmath0 starting from an ambi - polar generalization of the atiyah - hitchin metric . for both the standard atiyah - hitchin and eguchi - hanson metrics ,",
    "it is not possible to construct regular three - charge bubbling solutions .",
    "this reflects the fact that fluxes tend to stabilize cycles that would shrink by themselves , and hence only `` pathological '' generalizations to ambi - polar metrics can be used as base - spaces to create bubbling solutions .",
    "we have obtained the ambi - polar generalizations of both the atiyah - hitchin and the eguchi - hanson spaces , and have constructed the full three - charge solutions based on these spaces .    as expected from our general analysis ,",
    "the full solutions are completely regular at the critical surface where the metric on the base space changes sign . moreover ,",
    "for the ambi - polar eguchi - hanson space , one can construct the full solution , which , interestingly enough , turns out to be _ global _ @xmath442 .",
    "we could also obtain solutions that pinch off , and have a curvature singularity .",
    "we argued that this singularity has the same structure as the one in the klebanov - tseytlin solution @xcite and we believe the presence of this singularity is a consequence of the high level of symmetry of the base space , and that the singularity will similarly be resolved by considering a less - symmetric base space .",
    "this work opens several interesting directions of research .",
    "first , having shown that singular , @xmath0-invariant , ambi - polar , four - dimensional , hyper - khler metrics can give smooth five - dimensional solutions upon adding fluxes , it is important to go back to the @xmath18 toda equation and to construct more general solutions .",
    "a first step in this investigation would be to find the solutions of the toda equations that give the @xmath443 invariant ambi - polar gibbons - hawking metrics , following perhaps the techniques of @xcite .",
    "one could then find other solutions in the vicinity of the latter , and count them using the techniques of @xcite .",
    "second , the fact that the ambi - polar generalizations of the atiyah - hitchin and the eguchi - hanson spaces give regular geometries suggests that ambi - polar generalizations of other known hyper - khler metrics will also give regular solutions .",
    "finding these solutions would be quite interesting .",
    "finally , we have seen that the ambi - polar generalization of the eguchi - hanson space yields a full geometry that is @xmath442 .",
    "moreover , unlike in the case of usual bubbling bps solutions , the @xmath444 solution is not the poincar patch , but the full global @xmath445 solution .",
    "while the distinction between global and poincar @xmath426 is relatively trivial , the appearance of something like a regular wormhole suggests that bubbling geometries might be even richer and more interesting than was originally anticipated .",
