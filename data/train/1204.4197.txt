    "such oscillations are important because of their potential for the diagnostics of magnetic structures by implementation of the method of magneto - seismology , through matching the mhd wave theory and wave observations in the solar atmosphere to obtain several physical parameters ( e.g. , magnetic field strength and density scale height ) .",
