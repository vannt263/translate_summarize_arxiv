    "supergravity theories , which describe the low energy dynamics of string theories , generically have a large number of flat directions in their field spaces @xcite",
    ". we call the scalar fields corresponding to these flat directions moduli fields , or moduli , simply .",
    "moduli @xmath5 are expected to take their values of the order of the planck scale @xmath6gev in the very early universe , because it is the only scale appearing in supergravity actions . at the later epoch in the universe s evolution supersymmetry ( susy )",
    "is spontaneously broken .",
    "susy- breaking effects may lift the flat potential for moduli through some non - perturbative dynamics and generate their masses @xmath7 comparable to the gravitino mass : @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "moduli fields are generally accompanied by different kinds of cosmological problems depending on the values of their masses .",
    "these problems are divided into two classes discriminated by if or not the moduli decay takes place in the early universe .",
    "that is , if it does the radiation produced by the moduli decay may conflict with some cosmological observations , and even if it does not a tremendous amount of moduli energy density itself causes disaster .",
    "let us make a crude estimation of moduli lifetime and determine its dependence on @xmath0",
    ". from dimensional analysis the decay width of the moduli is roughly @xmath9 where @xmath10 denotes the number of decay channels .",
    "the lifetime is given by @xmath11    in conventional hidden sector models , the gravitino masses @xmath1 are about 1tev , so from eq.([moduli - lifetime ] ) we see that the moduli lifetime is much shorter than the age of the present universe @xmath12 for @xmath8 .",
    "therefore , in these models one must worry about whether or not the radiation produced by the moduli decay spoils the scenario of big bang nucleosynthesis .",
    "the reheating temperature derived from the width ( [ moduli - width ] ) is @xmath13 in order for the big bang nucleosynthesis to work , high enough reheating temperature is needed ( @xmath14mev ) , and this requirement constrains the moduli mass to be lower bounded : @xmath15 tev @xcite 10 tev , but the affleck - dine mechanism for baryogenesis @xcite naturally explains the present value @xcite . ] .",
    "however , this relatively large moduli mass @xmath16tev is realized only in a specific class of hidden sector models .",
    "thus , one is faced with a difficulty that the process of nucleosynthesis does not proceed efficiently in a generic class of hidden sector models @xcite .",
    "lyth and stewart proposed a mechanism so - called thermal inflation @xcite which solves this problem by diluting extensively the cosmic energy density of the moduli and consequently decreasing the number of photons produced by the moduli decay sufficiently so as not to upset the nucleosynthesis .",
    "gauge - mediated susy - breaking models @xcite , to which we pay our attention especially in this paper , have the gravitino mass in a range of @xmath2 kev-1gev .",

    ", moduli fields are expected to take their vacuum - expectation values ( vev s ) of the order @xmath18 , which is so large that the moduli energy density easily exceeds the critical density of the present universe .",
    "although the moduli lifetime ( [ moduli - lifetime ] ) tells us that a class of these models with 100 mev @xmath17 1 gev does not suffer from the moduli problem of their too much amount of energy density , a constraint from the cosmic @xmath19-ray backgrounds is crucial in this mass region @xcite .    our main task in this paper is to apply the thermal inflation mechanism to gauge - mediated susy - breaking models , and argue the possibility that these models could pass the above cosmological constraints .",
    "we assume @xmath20 throughout this paper .",
    "our analysis consists of two parts . in the first part ( sections 2 and 3 ) we adopt a thermal inflation model proposed by lyth ane stewart @xcite . in this model",
    "there is a pseudo nambu - goldstone boson ( called r - axion ) arising from a spontaneous breakdown of an accidental r symmetry .",
    "we show that the mass of r - axion is always much smaller than the flaton mass in the gauge - mediated susy - breaking models .",
    "thus , the flaton decays mainly into these r - axions and as a consequence the dilution of the moduli s energy density becomes much milder .",
    "we show that there is no parameter region surviving the cosmological constraints in this type of thermal inflation model .",
    "we modify the above thermal inflation model , in the second part ( section 4 ) , by adding a small explicit breaking term of the r symmetry to suppress the r - axion decay of the flaton .",
    "we find that a parameter region for the moduli mass , @xmath2kev@xmath21kev @xcite , survives the cosmological constraints .",
    "it should be noted here that the affleck - dine baryogenesis does work for these gravitino mass region @xcite .",
    "we also stress that the moduli themselves could be the dark matter in the present universe for the region , @xmath2kev@xmath17 100 kev",
    ". this may be a very crucial observation , since there is no dark matter candidate beside the moduli themselves because of the substantial dilution of any relic particle abundance by the late - time thermal inflation.@xmath22 gev may be another candidate for the dark matter@xcite .",

    "the last section is devoted to discussion and conclusions .",
    "in this section we review a thermal inflation model which was proposed by lyth and stewart@xcite .",
    "inevitable ingredients of the model are flaton fields , which are characterized by their ` almost flat ' potentials and ` large ' vacuum - expectation values ( vev s ) . here , ` almost flat ' means that the roots of the second rank derivatives of potentials at their minima , namely the masses of corresponding flaton particles , are of the order of susy - breaking scale and the flaton fields have ` large ' vev s which are much larger than the scale . for simplicity ,",
    "let us concentrate on the case in which only one flaton field exists , even though more than one flaton cases are also valuable to analyze .    in order to guarantee the flatness of potential ,",
    "we assume that the flaton s potential possesses some exact ( or at least approximate ) global symmetries .",
    "if not , nonrenormalizable higher order interactions would induce a tadpole term through the susy - breaking effects .",
    "one familiar example of such global symmetries is @xmath23 symmetry , but it should be explicitly broken to some discrete symmetry , say @xmath24 , by a constant term @xmath25 in the superpotential which is required to cancel the cosmological constant .",
    "thus , in this paper we postulate that the superpotential for the flaton exhibits @xmath26 symmetry and takes a form symmetry instead of @xmath27 , one reaches the same conclusion as in this paper , since the higher power terms @xmath28 in the superpotential ( [ superpotential ] ) are practically negligible as seen below . ]",

    "as will be verified later the vev of the superpotential ( [ superpotential ] ) is dominated by the constant term @xmath25 , and hence we take @xmath33 to cancel the vacuum energy .",

    "we will come back this point in section 4 .",
    "the superpotential ( [ superpotential ] ) has an approximate @xmath46 symmetry if we neglect the higher order terms and then the imaginary part of @xmath30 becomes a pseudo - goldstone boson called r - axion .",

    "then , at high temperature @xmath60 the flaton field sits near the origin and produces the vacuum energy @xmath39 .",
    "if the energy of the universe is dominated by the radiation just before the thermal inflation , the vacuum energy @xmath61 becomes comparable to the radiation energy at the cosmic temperature @xmath62 .",
    "thus , for @xmath63 , the vacuum energy of the flaton field dominates the energy of the universe and a mini - inflation , i.e. thermal inflation takes place@xcite . on the other hand ,",

    "the flaton decay is crucial since it is most responsible for the entropy production .",
    "here we shall list the relevant decay channels and compute quantitatively the decay rate for each channel which is needed to trace the physics following the thermal inflation epoch .",
    "the only possible renormalizable interaction of the flaton with susy standard model particles is @xmath65 where @xmath66 and @xmath67 are higgs chiral supermultiplets .",
    "when the flaton field develops the vev , @xmath68 , the higgs multiplets acquire a mass @xmath69 , and for this to be at most the electroweak scale the coupling constant @xmath70 has to be set so small , @xmath71 . here @xmath72 is the susy - invariant mass for the higgs multiplets . if the flaton mass is large enough , the flaton decays into a pair of higgs fields .",

    "even if the above decay process would be kinematically forbidden , the flaton could decay into two photons through one - loop diagrams@xcite ) or by charged @xmath52 loop through the yukawa interaction which is required in order that the flaton sits around the origin during the thermal inflation .",

    "thus we consider the model with @xmath176 not so close to unity . ] as far as @xmath184 .",
    "furthermore , the deviation of the vacuum energy of the flaton from @xmath61 is estimated as @xmath185 which has a suppression factor of @xmath186 and is consequently negligible .",
    "therefore , we find that if we take @xmath176 to be not so close to unity the dynamics of the thermal inflation is not modified much by adding the explicit breaking term ( [ w - dm ] ) .",
    "since the linear term ( [ w - dm ] ) in the superpotential breaks also an approximate @xmath46 symmetry , the term gives additional contributions not only to the flaton mass but also to the @xmath94-axion mass .",
    "then their masses are given by @xmath187 therefore , for the region that it actually corresponds to a broad one , namely @xmath188 ] @xmath189 the flaton decay into two @xmath94-axions is kinematically forbidden . in the following we consider the thermal inflation model with the explicit breaking term ( [ w - dm ] ) satisfying eq.([const - x ] ) , and re - examine whether the model can solve the cosmological moduli problem in gauge - mediated susy breaking theories .",
    "first we argue the thermal history after the thermal inflation . at the end of the thermal inflation ( @xmath86 ) the flaton field begins to oscillate around the true minimum of the potential ( [ veff - dm ] ) , and when the hubble parameter becomes comparable to the total width of the flaton , the flaton decays only into susy standard model particles since the decay into @xmath94-axions is not allowed . as discussed in section 2 , the flaton decays dominantly into higgs particles if kinematically allowed , or when the flaton mass is smaller than the threshold of the decay into two higgs particles the flaton decays into two photons .",
    "each width is represented in eqs.([chi-2higgs ] ) and ( [ chi-2photon ] ) , respectively . in both cases ,",
    "the flaton energy is transferred to radiation and reheats the universe immediately .",
    "then the modified thermal inflation model increases the entropy by a factor given by putting @xmath190 and denoting @xmath88 by @xmath101 in eq.([delta - sm ] ) , @xmath191 where the reheating temperature @xmath99 is obtained by the decay width of the flaton .",
    "for the case that the flaton can decay into higgs particles ( @xmath192 gev ) , @xmath99 is represented as @xmath193 where @xmath194 is defined by @xmath195^{1/2}.\\ ] ] thus in this case , as pointed out in ref.@xcite , the reheating temperature @xmath99 can be taken to be high enough ( @xmath135 mev ) to maintain the success of big bang neucleosynthesis .",
    "on the other hand for the case @xmath196 gev , the reheating temperature is estimated from eq.([chi-2photon ] ) as @xmath197    now let us estimate the cosmic energy density of coherent modulus oscillation in the present universe .",
    "the present energy density of the `` big - bang '' modulus is given by replacing @xmath118 in eq.([pre - rhobb ] ) by the expression of the entropy production ( [ delta - dm ] ) , hence @xmath198 on the other hand , the present energy density of the `` thermal - inflation '' modulus is estimated from eq.([pre - rhoti ] ) as @xmath199 then we turn to estimating the lower bound of the total energy density of the modulus .",
    "the lower bound is given by@xcite @xmath200      & \\geq &      \\sqrt { \\left ( \\frac { \\rho_\\phi   } { s } \\right)_{bb }          \\left ( \\frac { \\rho_\\phi   } { s } \\right)_{ti } } , \\nonumber \\\\     \\label{ab-130 g }      & \\simeq & 1.2 \\left ( \\frac { \\phi_0 } { m_g } \\right)^2      \\left ( \\frac { t_c } { m_\\chi } \\right)^{3/2 }      \\frac { m_\\chi^{3/2 } t_r } { m_\\phi^{3/4 } m_g^{3/4 } } .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here , the equality is satisfied when @xmath201 , i.e. when @xmath202 where @xmath203}$ ] and we have used eq.([tr - gamma ] ) for an expression of @xmath99 , assuming @xmath204 130 gev .",
    "then , the lower bound of the moduli energy is estimated from eq.([ab-130 g ] ) as @xmath205 thus the lowest reheating temperature @xmath206 mev and @xmath207 give the minimum abundance as @xmath208^{3/7 }      \\left ( \\frac { 1 ~\\mbox{gev } } { m_\\phi } \\right)^{3/14},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for @xmath138 and @xmath137 . however , if we put @xmath206 mev in eq.([bb = ti-130l ] ) we observe that the assumption @xmath209 gev holds only when @xmath210 thus , for @xmath211 the theoretical lower bound ( [ min-130l1 ] ) is realized in the case @xmath212 130 gev and the main decay mode is @xmath213 .    on the other hand , for the modulus mass @xmath214 we can obtain the minimum abundance lower than the r.h.s .",
    "of eq.([min-130l1 ] ) by making use of eq.([tr - higgs ] ) which is applicable for @xmath215 130gev instead of eq.([tr - gamma ] ) .. then , the flaton decay into higssinos should be forbidden , otherwise the gravitinos produced in succesive decay of higgsinos overclose the present universe . ]",
    "therefore , for @xmath214 the condition that the lower bound is saturated in eq.([ab-130 g ] ) is @xmath216^{2/7 } }      \\left ( \\frac { t_c } { m_\\chi } \\right)^{3/7 }      m_\\phi^{5/14 } m_g^{1/14 } t_r^{4/7}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the lowest possible values for the flaton mass and the reheating temperature satisfying eq.([bb = ti-130 g ] ) are practically given by @xmath217 130 gev and @xmath99 = 10 mev , yielding the minimum abundance in eq.([ab-130 g ] ) as @xmath218 comparing with the present critical density in eq.([critical - density ] ) , @xmath138 and @xmath137 leads to @xmath219    in fig.2 we show the lower bound for the enegy density of the modulus predicted from eqs.([min-130l1 ] ) and ( [ min-130 g ] ) .",
    "a remarkable consequence which distinguishes itself from the result in section 3 is that for all the moduli mass region @xmath2 kev @xmath4 10 gev , the predicted lower bound can be taken to be below the critical density of the present universe .",
    "so far , we have been considering the case @xmath220 .",
    "then let us discuss briefly what happens in the case @xmath146 . from eqs.([ab-2 ] ) and ( [ delta - dm ] ) , the present abundance of such a modulus is given by @xmath221 for any flaton mass .",
    "here we have assumed that the modulus mass is larger than the decay width of the flaton ( see the footnote [ assumption ] . ) .",
    "comparing with the case @xmath220 , the abundance in eq.([ab - ati - dm ] ) is always greater than the minimum abundances in eqs.([min-130l1 ] ) and ( [ min-130 g ] ) for @xmath222 kev1 gev .    in fig.2",
    "we also show the constraint from the observed @xmath107-ray backgrounds which is derived in section 3",
    ". then we can see that it excludes the modulus mass region 500 kev @xmath4 10 gev .",
    "therefore , we conclude that the cosmological problems are resolved in a class of gauge - mediated susy - breaking models with the gravitino mass @xmath2 kev @xmath3 500 kev , provided that the modified thermal inflation takes place and the flaton decay into r - axions is forbidden .",
    "we should comment here that the ansatz in eq.([eq - c ] ) is always satisfied for the parameter region we have analyzed .",
    "we have found in the first part of our analysis that due to the presence of too light r - axions the original thermal inflation model@xcite could not resolve infamous cosmological moduli problems in gauge - mediated susy - breaking theories , and all the gravitino mass region , @xmath2 kev @xmath3 10 gev , is excluded as long as @xmath20 is fulfilled .    in the next step ,",
    "we have modified the original thermal inflation model so that the r - axion decay of flaton is kinematically suppressed , and as a result we have succeeded to make a region @xmath2 kev @xmath3 500 kev to survive the cosmological constraints .",
    "moreover , it can be shown that a small window 1 gev @xmath3 10 gev appears , if we take @xmath223 0.010.1 that is nevertheless a slightly improbable condition . 0.010.1 in eq.([int - modui ] ) ] one should note , however , that this window is located in the region @xmath224 mev , in which it is far from easy to construct mechanisms to produce a sufficient number of baryons consistent with today s observational data@xcite if one adopts the original affleck - dine mechanism@xcite . here , it may be interesting that an enough number of baryons will be created even for @xmath224 mev if we adopt a variant type of affleck - dine baryogenesis discussed in ref.@xcite , since gauge - mediated models with @xmath225 1 gev are relatively easily constructed@xcite    in the present analysis we have adopted the effective potential ( [ flaton - potential ] ) for the flaton .",
    "we consider that the soft mass @xmath226 in eq.([flaton - potential ] ) is induced by the susy - breaking effects and hence the potential ( [ flaton - potential ] ) is applicable only for the scale below masses @xmath227 of messenger multiplets .",
    "therefore , @xmath228 should be less than @xmath229 @xcite ) .",
    "we have checked that this constraint is indeed satisfied for the mass region @xmath2 kev @xmath3 10 gev we have studied .",
    "( note that @xmath230 @xmath231 gev  @xmath232 gev for @xmath106 kev  10 gev . )",
    "we would like to emphasize that the moduli could be the dark matter in the present universe with their masses being possibly in the region @xmath2 kev @xmath4 100 kev .",
    "fig.3 exhibits the region of the parameters @xmath125 and @xmath233 in which the conditions @xmath234 and @xmath104 10 mev are satisfied for @xmath235 100 kev . by noting that this region contains plausible values @xmath236@xmath237 gev and @xmath238 gev fortunately",
    ", one would be encouraged to expect that the above emphasis is by no means a nonsensical suggestion .",
    "the detailed study on the spectrum of the @xmath107-ray emitted from the cosmic moduli will be given in ref.@xcite .",
    "as concerns the moduli masses , it is another intriguing possibility that so - called `` mev - bump '' , an excess in the @xmath19-ray background spectrum around @xmath239 1 mev@xcite , might be a signal for the moduli decay@xcite .",
    "anyway , future analyses of @xmath107-ray backgrounds in these mass regions are expected to provide us with more detailed information about the moduli@xcite .    if the existence of light moduli fields is a generic prediction of string theories , it will probably present us with a plenty of subjects in low energy physics , typical examples of which are nothing but the cosmological moduli problems we have attempted to solve in this paper .",
    "* acknowledgement *    we would like to thank t. kamae , h. murayama and s. orito for the encouragement .",
    "since the velocity dispersion of the moduli is negligible , two monochromatic photons with energy @xmath240 are produced in the moduli decay .",
    "thus , the spectrum @xmath241 of the photon per decay is written as @xmath242 the number density @xmath243 of the moduli at red - shift @xmath161 is given by @xmath244 then the present flux from the moduli is estimated as @xmath245 where @xmath160 is the present time , @xmath163 the present energy of the photon and the factor @xmath246 in the first equation represents the dilution due to the cosmic expansion .",
