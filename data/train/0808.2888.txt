    "heavy flavour hadrons play an important role in several high energy experiments as well as in the understanding of the theories like qcd , nrqcd , pnrqcd , vnrqcd and effective field theories .",
    "the bes at the beijing electron positron collider ( bepc ) , e835 at fermilab , and cleo at the cornell electron storage ring ( cesr ) are able to collect the huge data on heavy flavour mesons .",
    "where as b - meson factories , babar at pep - ii and belle at kekb are working on the observation of new and possibly exotics quarkonia states .",
    "the cdf and d@xmath7 experiments at fermilab measuring heavy quarkonia production from gluon - gluon fusion in @xmath8 annihilations at 2 te@xmath9 . also some other experiments like zeus and h1 at desy are studying charmonia production in photon - gluon fusion .",
    "the study related to the charmonia production and suppression in heavy - ion collisions are being looked by phenix , star and na60 .",
    "all these experiments are capable of observing new states , new production mechanisms , new decays and transitions , and in general to the collection of high statistics and precision data sample . in the near future",
    ", even larger data samples are expected from the bes - iii upgraded experiment , while the b factories and the fermilab tevatron will continue to supply valuable data for few years .",
    "later on , the lhc experiments at cern , panda at gsi etc are capable of offering future opportunities and challenges in this field of heavy flavour physics @xcite .",
    "+ on the theoretical side , heavy quarkonium provides testing and the validity of perturbative qcd , potential models and lattice qcd calculations @xcite .",
    "the investigation of the properties of mesons composed of a heavy quark and antiquark ( @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 ) gives very important insight into heavy quark dynamics and to the understanding of the constituent quark masses .",
    "the theoretical predictions of the heavy quarkonia @xmath10 , @xmath13 and @xmath12 mesons have rich spectroscopy with many narrow states of charmonium lying under the threshold of open charm production @xcite and of botomonium lying under the threshold of @xmath14 production .",
    "many of these states have not confirmed or understood by experiments @xcite .",
    "however , there have been renewed interest in the spectroscopy of the heavy flavoured hadrons due to number of experimental facilities ( cleo , delphi , belle , babar , lhcb etc ) which have been continuously providing and expected to provide more accurate and new informations about these states at the heavy flavour sector .",
    "+ at the hadronic scale the non - perturbative effects connected with complicated structure of qcd vacuum necessarily play an important role .",
    "all this leads to a theoretical uncertainty in the @xmath15 potential at large and intermediate distances .",
    "it is just in this region of large and intermediate distance that most of the basic hadron resonances are formed .",
    "so the success of theoretical model predictions of most of the hadronic properties with experiments can provide important information about the quark - antiquark interactions .",
    "such information is of great interest , as it is not possible to obtain the @xmath0 potential starting from the basic principle of the quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) at the hadronic scale .",
    "+ among many theoretical attempts or approaches to explain the hadron properties based on its quark structure very few were successful in predicting the hadronic properties starting from its spectroscopy to decay rates .",
    "the nonrelativistic potential models with buchmller and tye @xcite , martin @xcite , log @xcite , cornell @xcite etc . were successful in predictions of the spectra of the heavy flavour mesons while the bethe - salpeter approach under harmonic confinement @xcite were successful at low flavour sector .",
    "though there exist relativistic approaches for the study of the different hadronic properties @xcite , the non - relativistic models have also been equally successful at the heavy flavour sector .",
    "+ for the theoretical predictions of different decay rates most of the models require supplementary corrections such as higher order qcd effects , radiative contributions etc . even in some cases rescaling of the model radial wave functions",
    "are also being considered .",
    "however the nrqcd formalism provides a systematic approach to study the decay properties like the di - gamma and the di - lepton decays .",
    "these partial decay widths provide an account of the compactness of the qurkonium system which is an useful information complementary to spectroscopy @xcite .",
    "thus , in this paper we make an attempt to study the properties like mass spectrum , decay constants and other decay properties of the @xmath5 systems @xmath16 based on a phenomenological coulomb plus power potential ( cpp@xmath3 ) . here",
    ", we consider different choices of the potential power index @xmath4 to study the properties of the mesonic systems upto few excited states . +",
    "there are many theoretical approaches both relativistic and nonrelativistic to study the heavy quark systems @xcite .",
    "however their predictions suggests the successes of the nonrelativistic treatment for the heavy flavour quark - antiquark system @xcite . the relativistic invariant theory for example light - front qcd @xcite though deals with different aspects of qcd , under non - relativistic approximations , reproduces the results comparable to the non - relativistic quark - potential models @xcite . in the center of mass frame of the heavy quark - antiquark system ,",
    "the momenta of the quark and antiquark are dominated by their rest mass @xmath17 , which constitutes the basis of the non - relativistic treatment . for examples",
    "nrqcd formalism for the heavy quarkonia , the velocity of heavy quark is chosen as the expansion parameter @xcite .",
    "+ hence , for the study of heavy - heavy bound state systems such as @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath12 , we consider a nonrelativistic hamiltonian given by @xcite @xmath20 where @xmath21 @xmath22 and @xmath23 are the mass parameters of quark and antiquark respectively , p is the relative momentum of each quark and @xmath24 is the quark antiquark potential . though linear plus coulomb potential is a successful well studied non - relativistic model for heavy flavour sector , their predictions for decay widths are not satisfactory owing to the improper value of the radial wave function at the origin compared to other models @xcite .",
    "thus , in the present study we consider a general power potential with color coulomb term of the form @xmath25 [ eq:403 ] as the static quark - antiquark interaction potential .",
