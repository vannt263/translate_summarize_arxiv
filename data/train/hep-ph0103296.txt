    "a lot of effort has justifiably been spent on the central detectors of the lhc experiments so that hard  interactions can be triggered on , and observed , in order to expose new physics .",
    "however the vast majority of interactions are soft  with particles predominantly going forward , and the physics of this domain is one of the subjects of the workshop .",
    "the relevant processes , forward elastic scattering and soft  diffraction , are driven by pomeron ( or rather by multi - pomeron ) exchange .",
    "they are interesting in their own right , although in the period after the advent of qcd they did not attract so much attention .",
    "however in the last few years the situation has changed .",
    "a stimulus came from the observation of diffractive processes at hera and the tevatron , characterised by the presence of rapidity gaps .",
    "moreover , diffractive processes have been proposed as possible ways to identify new physics .",
    "for example , the central production of a higgs boson with a rapidity gap on either side is advocated as a possible discovery channel at the lhc . the chance that these gaps survive the soft rescattering of the colliding hadrons was one of the topics of discussion .",
    "the second subject of the workshop was the way to measure the luminosity of the lhc .",
    "three methods were discussed :    * the classic method based on the optical theorem , [ eq : a1 ] .",
    "|_t = 0 = ( 1 + ^2 ) , where @xmath5 is the ratio of the real to the imaginary part of the forward elastic amplitude ( coulomb effects have been neglected in ( [ eq : a1 ] ) ) , * to measure pure qed @xmath6 or @xmath7 production via photon - photon fusion [ eq : a2 ] pp p + ^+ ^- + p , * to measure inclusive @xmath2 or @xmath3 production .    at first sight",
    "it might appear that an accurate measurement of the luminosity is not essential .",
    "however , for example , precision measurements in the higgs sector of accuracy of about 7% require the uncertainty in the measurement of the luminosity to be 5% or less @xcite . at this workshop ,",
    "tapprogge @xcite summarised the physics reasons why a precise measurement of the luminosity of the lhc is important .",
    "bozzo @xcite presented the totem experimental programme , which will take place in the very first runs at the lhc .",
    "the plan is to measure @xmath9 by a luminosity - independent method [ eq : a3 ] _ tot = , with an absolute error of about 1  mb .",
    "the totem inelastic detector will be installed inside the cms experiment , with the elastic scattering roman pot  detectors located at distances in the interval 100 to 200  m from the crossing point .",
    "the totem measurements need special runs at the low  initial luminosity , with high @xmath10 optics for an accurate measurement of the small scattering angles",
    ". the detector should be efficient to within 2  mm of the beam and can reach down to about @xmath11 .",
    "they will collect about 100 events / sec for @xmath12 at a luminosity @xmath13 .",
    "the differential cross section will also be measured in the interval @xmath14 in the high luminosity runs .",
    "totem also plans an inclusive trigger for the measurement of single diffraction .",
    "we also heard at the workshop about the novel microstation concept for forward measurements @xcite .",
    "the microstation is a light , compact device which could be integrated with the beam pipe .",
    "it could be used in situations where there are severe space and mass limitations for the inelastic detector , such as in the atlas experiment .",
    "the elastic proton measurement would be like that for totem , so again it should be possible to reach down to @xmath15 .",
    "piotrzkowski @xcite considered the possibility of using the lhc as a @xmath16 collider , and noted how the present totem layout may be modified to allow the tagging of protons with small energy losses . in principle , this would allow the study of @xmath17 etc .  in a broad region of @xmath16",
    "centre - of - mass energy about 200  gev , with an effective @xmath16 luminosity that is reduced by about @xmath18@xmath19 of that of the lhc .",
    "guryn @xcite presented the pp2pp experimental physics programme at rhic .",
    "their main goal is to make a detailed study of the spin dependence of the proton - proton interaction in the kinematic range [ eq : a4 ] 50 < < 500  gev 4 10 ^ -4 < |t| < 1.5  gev^2 , in order to probe features of the pomeron . at the beginning",
    "they will measure @xmath20 down to @xmath21 , and study the @xmath22 dependence of the slope .",
    "later they will explore the coulomb - nuclear interference region , and determine @xmath5 . by measuring the spin asymmetries",
    "@xmath23 they will obtain information on the five independent @xmath24 helicity amplitudes .",
    "block @xcite discussed the determination of @xmath25 at @xmath26  tev from cosmic ray data .",
    "he emphasized the importance of the relation between the slope @xmath27 of the elastic scattering distribution and @xmath9 for energies well above the accelerator regime , and the reliance on a model of proton - air interactions .",
    "vorobyov @xcite reminded us how at isr energies , and below , it was possible to make precision measurements of the elastic differential cross section at small momentum transfer down into the coulomb - nuclear interference region . from these experiments one could make a determination of the local slope [ eq : a5 ] b ( t ) = as a function of @xmath22 , measure the ratio @xmath5 of the real to imaginary part of the forward amplitude and reliably determine the total cross section from the optical point . however",
    "the application of this method becomes more and more difficult as we go up to tevatron and then lhc energies , due to the decrease of the typical scattering angle and the inability to experimentally reach the coulomb - nuclear interference region .",
    "figs .  1 , 2 and 3 show data at isr , cern @xmath30 and tevatron energies respectively .",
    "in the first two plots we see the coulomb interference spike at very small @xmath22 , whereas at the tevatron the spike is no longer accessible and the data of the two experiments extrapolate to different values at @xmath29 .",
    "moreover at the isr we see , from fig .  1 , a change of the local slope with @xmath22 , [ eq : a6 ] b ( 0 ) - b ( | t | = 0.2  gev^2 ) 2  gev^-2 , whereas at the tevatron the data suggest less variation for @xmath31 , see fig .  3 .",
    "a global description of these and other forward data gives the @xmath22 dependence of the local slopes shown in fig .",
    "the dashed curves should be ignored as they come from a description which does not include high - mass diffraction .",
    "the remaining two curves ( continuous and dotted ) are obtained using two extremum models for high - mass diffraction , and give a measure of the level of the theoretical ambiguity in @xmath32 .",
    "the predictions at the lhc energy mean that we should be able to extrapolate the totem measurements to @xmath29 with an error of less than 0.5% coming from the variation of the local slope .",
    "even if the cross section were measured only in the interval @xmath33 , then the uncertainty at @xmath29 would be less than 3% due to the variation of @xmath32 .",
    "high energy @xmath8 scattering at small momentum transfer @xmath22 is driven by pomeron @xmath22-channel exchange .",
    "in fact we were reminded at the workshop @xcite how in 1960 , gribov startled the community by showing that the behaviour of the @xmath8 amplitude [ eq : a7 ] a ( s , t ) = i s f ( t ) , which gives the asymptotic behaviour crossing invariance is an important ingredient in the second equality in ( [ eq : a8 ] ) , the pomeranchuk theorem . ]",
    "[ eq : a8 ] _ tot = , ( pp ) = ( p|p ) , contradicts @xmath22-channel unitarity .",
    "gribov noted that a possible solution was to introduce the regge behaviour [ eq : a9 ] a ( s , t ) = i s^_(t ) f ( t ) , with a pomeron trajectory @xmath34 , with intercept @xmath35 and slope @xmath36 .",
    "this is in agreement with @xmath22-channel unitarity , while still giving relations ( [ eq : a8 ] ) .",
    "in addition to the pomeron pole , there are also regge cuts coming from multiple pomeron exchange , which led to the development of gribov s reggeon calculus , involving renormalisation of the bare pole , mandelstam crossed diagrams @xcite , agk cutting rules @xcite , etc .",
    "this soft  pomeron was the subject of the talks by landshoff @xcite and kaidalov @xcite .",
    "landshoff @xcite showed that a good description of the available data for high energy @xmath9 and @xmath37 at small momentum transfer is given by a simple effective pomeron pole trajectory [ eq : a10 ] _ eff ( t ) = 1.08 + ^t with @xmath38 .",
    "this is a remarkable simplification , but of course it is necessarily incomplete for the reasons that are mentioned below .",
    "kaidalov @xcite explained that to describe phenomena in the forward region , it is important to extend single - pomeron exchange so as to explicitly include the multi - pomeron effects . at very high energy such effects are needed to restore @xmath39-channel unitarity , but , as we will see in a moment , they are also necessary at current energies .",
    "5 shows examples of typical corrections to the bare pomeron pole of diagram ( a ) .",
    "first , iterations of the pole amplitude via elastic unitarity gives contributions of the type shown in diagram ( b ) .",
    "if we take into account the possibility of proton excitations @xmath40 in intermediate states , then we must include contributions such as that in diagram ( c ) .",
    "these iterations are implemented in terms of a two - channel eikonal formalism @xcite .",
    "note that diagrams ( b ) and ( c ) are very symbolic  by implication they incorporate the mandelstam crossed diagrams @xcite and satisfy the agk cutting rules @xcite .",
    "the second @xmath41 channel effectively allows for _ low mass _ diffractive dissociation .",
    "the excitation into _ high mass _ @xmath42 states is described by the triple - pomeron graph ( d ) for single - diffractive dissociation ( with cross section @xmath43 ) , and by ( e ) for double - diffractive dissociation @xmath44 . to be self - consistent , the pomeron lines in ( d ) and ( e ) actually represent the final pomeron amplitude with all the screening effects included .",
    "in addition to ( d ) , there is an equal contribution @xmath43 from dissociation of the lower proton only .",
    "the contribution of graphs of the type ( b)(e ) are not negligible . indeed , using the agk rules",
    ", it may be estimated that the correction to ( a ) is [ eq : a11 ] _",
    "d/_tot ( _ el + 2 _ sd + _",
    "dd)/_tot ~ 0.4 at the lhc .",
    "a most convincing way to see the necessity of multi - pomeron rescattering effects at current energies is to look at the energy behaviour of @xmath43 .",
    "if only the bare pomeron is used , as in diagram ( d ) , then the cross section grows as [ eq : a12 ] _ sd ~ s^2 _ ( t ) - 2 , whereas when rescattering effects are included [ eq : a13 ] _ sd ~ _ tot / s .",
    "the difference is dramatic , as fig .",
    "the physical origin of this result is that the high energy proton - proton interaction reaches the black - disc limit for central values of the impact parameter , and forces inelastic diffraction to come from the peripheral region with @xmath45 .",
    "a related observation was made by schlein @xcite .",
    "he showed that the single diffractive data in the isr - tevatron energy range can be described by the triple - regge formula , provided that the effective intercept @xmath46 decreased with increasing @xmath39 .",
    "such an @xmath39 dependent behaviour of the effective intercept may be interpreted as a manifestation of the multi - pomeron exchange effects.the bare pomeron , together with the multi - pomeron corrections , should give a global description of all forward phenomena , including @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "several analyses have been undertaken at various levels of sophistication to all or parts of the data .",
    "recent examples are given in @xcite .",
    "perhaps the most complete study to date is that of ref .",
    "@xcite , which is in the spirit of the much earlier pioneering work of kaidalov et al .",
    "it describes the forward phenomena in high energy @xmath8 ( and @xmath49 ) collisions using a multi - pomeron approach which embodies :    * _ pion - loop _ insertions in the bare pomeron pole , which represent the nearest singularity generated by @xmath22-channel unitarity , * a _ two - channel eikonal _ which incorporates the pomeron cuts generated by elastic and quasi - elastic ( with @xmath50 intermediate states ) @xmath39-channel unitarity .",
    "* high mass single and double _ diffractive dissociation_.    the resulting description of @xmath37 data is shown in figs .",
    "13 and the corresponding @xmath22 dependence of the local slope @xmath32 is given in fig .",
    "surprisingly , the bare pomeron pole parameters turn out to be [ eq:14 ] ( 0 ) - 1 0.10 , ^ = 0 , which is to be contrasted to those of the effective pole ( [ eq : a10 ] ) .",
    "thus the shrinkage of the diffraction cone comes not from the bare pole , but rather has components from the three ingredients , ( i)(iii ) , of the model .",
    "that is , in the isr - tevatron energy range @xcite[eq : a15 ] _",
    "( 0.034 + 0.15 + 0.066 )  gev^-2 from the @xmath51-loop , @xmath39-channel eikonalization and diffractive dissociation respectively .",
    "we saw @xcite that at lower energies the fixed target data require @xmath52 , which is consistent with ( [ eq : a15 ] ) since as the energy decreases the effect of the eikonal and higher mass diffractive dissociation reduces .",
    "moreover eikonal rescattering suppresses the growth of the cross section with @xmath53 , so to describe the same data we require @xmath54 .",
    "another observable difference between the naive effective pole and the multi - pomeron approach is in the energy behaviour of the slope @xmath55 .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "7 , together with the behaviour of @xmath9 .",
    "it is seen that , while the two approaches give similar values of @xmath9 up to lhc energies , the predictions for the slope @xmath55 at the lhc already differ significantly .    in table  1",
    "we show some predictions for the forward observables at the lhc .",
    "note that the bh predictions @xcite are based on a single - channel eikonal , and do not therefore involve inelastic diffraction .",
    "the kmr prediction is an update of @xcite .",
    ".predictions for forward observables at the lhc . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^ \" , ]     an experimental manifestation of the survival probability @xmath56 comes from comparing hard diffraction at the tevatron with that observed at hera .",
    "the relevant plot was presented by snow @xcite , see also @xcite .",
    "it shows the recent cdf measurements of diffractive dijet production as a function of @xmath57 , together with the expectations based on convoluting the parton densities of the pomeron ( and those of the proton ) with the partonic - level cross sections of the hard subprocess .",
    "@xmath57 is the momentum fraction of the pomeron entering the hard subprocess .",
    "the parton densities of the pomeron are determined from diffractive deep - inelastic - scattering data at hera @xcite .",
    "the partonic structure of the tevatron dijet production and hera diffractive dis are sketched in fig .",
    "however , as the cdf plot @xcite shows , when the hera pomeron densities are used to estimate tevatron dijet production , the factorized prediction turns out to be about an order of magnitude larger than the data .",
    "a key assumption of the factorization estimate is that the survival probability of the rapidity gap , associated with the pomeron exchange , is the same in figs .",
    "8(a ) and 8(b ) .",
    "comparison of the diagrams shows that the breakdown of factorization is an inevitable consequence of qcd , and occurs naturally , due to the small probability @xmath56 for the rapidity gap to survive the soft rescattering which occurs between the incoming hadrons at the tevatron , but which is absent between the electron and the proton at hera .",
    "in fact , a detailed study of this comparison , including the @xmath57 dependence , tells us about the dependence of the survival probability on the kinematic variables @xcite , and opens the door to the application to many other hard processes with rapidity gaps , including those discussed by khoze @xcite .",
    "lipatov gave a comprehensive survey of the pomeron before and after qcd @xcite .",
    "since he was either close to , or pioneered , all these developments , it was a masterly and informative summary .",
    "the pomeron before qcd was the subject of section  4 .",
    "that pomeron was a reggeon , even if it has a rather unusual regge trajectory , which in the time - like ( @xmath58 ) region is mixed with the @xmath59 and @xmath60 meson trajectories @xcite .    in qcd",
    "the gluon and quark @xmath22-channel exchanges are themselves reggeized .",
    "the qcd pomeron ( or bfkl pomeron as it is frequently called ) is a compound state of two reggeized gluons .",
    "in general it may have multi - gluon components .",
    "the bfkl framework allows the behaviour of the scattering of hadronic objects with transverse scale @xmath61 at centre - of - mass energy @xmath53 to be predicted in the domain @xmath62 . in the leading @xmath63 ( ll )",
    "approximation the cross section [ eq : a18 ] = _ n = 0^ c_n ( _ s s)^n .",
    "since @xmath64 a resummation of the @xmath63 terms is necessary .",
    "bfkl carried out this ll summation about 25 years ago with the result [ eq : a19 ] ~ s^ = |_s 4 2 , where @xmath65 , see @xcite .",
    "hence we speak of the bfkl or qcd pomeron . if @xmath66 , then @xmath67 .",
    "this result appears to be in contradiction with the observed rise of the relevant cross sections at large @xmath39 .",
    "the data at small @xmath68 , or of forward jets in deep - inelastic scattering at hera , or of @xmath69 scattering at lep , or jets separated by a large rapidity gap at the tevatron . ] indicate a power growth more like 0.3 than 0.5 .",
    "it was expected that the resummation of the nll corrections , that is of the @xmath70 terms , would remove the discrepancy .",
    "recently the computation of these terms has been completed @xcite and the corrections found to be large , giving [ eq : a20 ] = |_s 4 2 ( 1 - 6.3 |_s ) , which puts the usefulness of the whole perturbative approximation into question . fortunately it was observed that a major part of remaining higher order corrections may be resummed to all orders @xcite .",
    "these all - order resummations bring the bfkl programme back under control .",
    "at small bjorken @xmath0 the gluon distribution , @xmath59 , unintegrated over its transverse momentum @xmath71 , should exhibit bfkl behaviour .",
    "that is a characteristic @xmath72 growth as @xmath73 , accompanied by diffusion in @xmath71 .",
    "the transverse momenta are not ordered in the small @xmath0 bfkl evolution leading to a gaussian - type form of @xmath59 in @xmath74 with a width which grows as @xmath75 as @xmath73 .",
    "ultimately the diffusion will be a problem since it leads to increasingly important contributions from the infrared domain of @xmath76 where the bfkl equation is not expected to be valid .",
    "stirling @xcite discussed ways of studying the bfkl pomeron at the lhc .",
    "he concentrated on the original idea of mueller and navelet , that is to study the correlations between two jets widely separated in rapidity .",
    "it was argued that the best bfkl indicator is the rate of the weakening of the azimuthal ( back - to - back type ) correlation between the jets , as the rapidity interval increases  a manifestation of the diffusion in @xmath71 .",
    "the tevatron data show much less decorrelation than predicted by naive bfkl , but a much more realistic monte carlo has been developed @xcite which allows the proper constraints on phase space to be imposed .",
    "predictions for the lhc were presented .    de roeck @xcite discussed the opportunities at the lhc to observe the behaviour of parton densities at very small @xmath0 .",
    "in particular he emphasized that it may be possible to probe the gluon distribution in the @xmath77 and @xmath78 domain by observing either prompt photon production @xmath79 or drell - yan production at very large rapidities .",
    "the latter process involves a convolution to allow for the @xmath80 transition , which is required for a gluon - initiated reaction ; consequently somewhat large values of the gluon @xmath0 are probed .",
    "he pointed out that this domain may allow the shadowing corrections to @xmath81 to be studied .",
    "prompted by this talk , a quantitative study was performed using a unified evolution equation which embodies both bfkl and dglap behaviour and which incorporates the leading @xmath82 triple - pomeron vertex @xcite .",
    "the shadowing corrections were found to be small in the hera domain , but lead to about a factor of two suppression of the gluon in the @xmath83 region , which should be accessible in the experiments at the lhc .",
    "one possibility to measure the luminosity at the lhc is to observe exclusive lepton - pair production via photon - photon fusion [ eq : a21 ] pp p + ^+ ^- + p , where @xmath84 or @xmath85 , see @xcite . the born amplitude ( fig .",
    "9(a ) ) may be calculated within qed @xcite , and there are no strong interactions involving the leptons in the final state . the main phenomenological questions concern , first , the size of the absorptive corrections arising from inelastic proton - proton rescattering ( sketched symbolically in fig .  9(b ) ) and , second , how to suppress the proton dissociation contributions of fig .",
    "these questions are addressed in ref .",
    "the dissociation contributions vanish as @xmath86 , due to gauge invariance , where the @xmath87 are defined in fig .",
    "since it is difficult to measure a leading proton with @xmath88  mev , it is proposed @xcite to select events with very small transverse momentum of the lepton pair [ eq : a22 ] p_t ( ^+ ^- ) | _ ^+ t + _ ^- t | , with typically @xmath89  mev .",
    "moreover the rescattering correction of fig .",
    "9(b ) is suppressed because the main part of the born amplitude ( fig .",
    "9(a ) ) comes from large impact parameters by a @xmath90 selection rule . ]",
    "@xmath91 , whereas the rescattering occurs at smaller @xmath91 .",
    "the detection of the @xmath7 and @xmath6 processes differ .",
    "hence their use as a luminosity monitor is different .",
    "first we discuss @xmath7 production @xcite . to identify muons ( and separate them from @xmath92 mesons ) they have to have rather large transverse energy , @xmath93  gev .",
    "it is still possible to satisfy the @xmath94  mev cut , but the cross section is significantly reduced .",
    "the main contribution to the rescattering correction comes from the @xmath95 domain , where @xmath96 is the loop momentum in fig .",
    "9(b ) . as a consequence",
    "the correction is given by @xmath97 , where @xmath98 is a known , small numerical coefficient @xcite . if @xmath99  mev then the correction is only 0.13% .",
    "in addition to the small @xmath100 cut , it is proposed @xcite to fit the observed distribution in the muon acoplanarity angle @xmath101 in order to distinguish the elastic mechanism , fig .",
    "9(a ) , via its prominent peak at @xmath102 , from the background processes which are flat in @xmath101 .",
    "although the @xmath103 and @xmath100 cuts reduce the cross section , the muons have the advantage that we may trace the tracks back to the interaction vertex , and hence isolate the interaction in pile - up events .",
    "so , in principle , @xmath7 production can act as a luminometer in high luminosity lhc runs .",
    "an accuracy of @xmath104 is claimed provided the muon trigger is good enough @xcite .",
    "for @xmath6 production we do not need to select events with large @xmath105 , and so we may consider the small @xmath105 domain where the @xmath6 production cross section is much larger , and where the rescattering correction becomes totally negligible .",
    "this will require a dedicated detector in the forward regions for electrons of energy about 5  gev .",
    "if the threshold energy were reduced to 1  gev then the signal is increased by 15 and the signal - to - background ratio is substantially improved @xcite . it is claimed that an absolute luminosity measurment down to @xmath106 is possible for low luminosities @xmath107 , but for high luminosity the @xmath6 method may be limited by pile - up effects .",
    "@xmath2 and @xmath3 production in high energy @xmath8 collisions have clean signatures through their leptonic decay modes , @xmath108 and @xmath109 , and so may be considered as potential luminosity monitors @xcite .",
    "a vital ingredient is the accuracy with which the cross sections for @xmath2 and @xmath3 production can be theoretically calculated .",
    "the cross sections depend on parton distributions , especially quark densities , in a kinematic region where they are believed to be reliably known .",
    "recent determinations of @xmath110 at the lhc are shown in fig .",
    "the solid squares and triangles are from the nlo parton analyses of @xcite and the final two predictions are from the nlo and nnlo analyses of @xcite .",
    "the two major uncertainties appear to be due to the value of @xmath111 and to using different parton densities labelled by @xmath112 and @xmath113 .",
    "the @xmath114 and @xmath115 values correspond to changing @xmath116 by @xmath117 , which is probably too conservative , so a @xmath118 uncertainty in @xmath110 is more realistic from this source .",
    "the normalisation of the input data used in the global parton analyses is another source of uncertainty in @xmath110 .",
    "the hera experiments provide almost all of the data used in the global analyses in the relevant small @xmath0 domain .",
    "the @xmath112 and @xmath113 parton sets correspond to separate global fits in which the hera data have been renormalized by @xmath119 respectively . allowing for these uncertainties ,",
    "we conclude that the cross sections of @xmath2 and @xmath3 production are known to be about @xmath120 at the lhc energy . for a precise measurement allowance",
    "should be made for @xmath121 pair production and for @xmath2 bosons produced via @xmath22-quark decays , which produce about @xmath122 of the total signal .",
    "caron @xcite discussed the experimental requirements of using @xmath2 and @xmath3 production to determine the luminosity at the lhc .",
    "the luminosity determinations based on the measurement of the forward elastic cross section and on two - photon @xmath6 production can only be made in low luminosity runs , and require dedicated forward detectors and triggers",
    ". on the other hand , the measurement of @xmath2 or @xmath3 and two - photon @xmath7 production may be performed at high luminosity with the central detector .",
    "the latter process requires a good di - muon trigger with thresholds of @xmath123  gev for each muon .    in principle",
    ", we may monitor the luminosity using any process , with a significant cross section , which is straightforward to detect cleanly .",
    "for example , it could be single - pion production in a given rapidity and @xmath124 domain or inclusive @xmath7 production in a well defined kinematic region . in this way we may determine the relative luminosity and calibrate the monitor  by comparing the number of events detected for the monitor  reaction with the number of events for a process whose cross section is known .",
    "this has the advantage that the calibration may be carried out in a low luminosity run .",
    "the desired goal of measuring the luminosity to better than @xmath125 definitely seems attainable .",
    "we note that for applications where it is sufficient to know the parton - parton luminosity , better accuracy can be achieved .",
    "one view of forward or soft physics , which dominates the interactions at the lhc , is that it is an unfortunate unavoidable complication to the exciting rare events which we hope to see",
    ". it may be useful as a luminosity monitor , but the pomeron is boring .    another view expressed at the meeting is that to avoid the pomeron is to deny our birthright .",
    "almost all qcd is contained in the pomeron .",
    "the pomeron indirectly spawned string theory and sent a galaxy of physicists spinning off into higher dimensions .",
    "most of the rich hera physics is driven by the pomeron .",
    "the soft  pomeron in the non - perturbative domain has fascinating regge properties , leading to glueballs and mixing with @xmath126 states . with the advent of qcd we were reminded that the quark and gluon are not elementary , but reggeons",
    " and that the hard  or qcd pomeron is the compound state of two ( or more ) reggeized gluons .",
    "the correct interpolation between the hard and the soft regimes is an exciting fundamental problem yet to be solved .",
    "it is a special pleasure to thank , on behalf of all of the participants , dan - olof riska , risto orava and the other members of the organizing committee , together with laura salmi , for arranging such an excellent workshop , and for their hospitality in helsinki .",

    "<S> an attempt is made to summarize the discussion at the workshop , except for the panel discussion on the ability of the lhc detectors to accommodate forward reactions . </S>",
    "<S> the workshop focused on two main topics . </S>",
    "<S> the first topic was forward physics at the lhc . </S>",
    "<S> predictions were made for forward reactions , including elastic scattering and soft  diffractive processes , in terms of ( multi ) pomeron exchange , using knowledge gained at lower energies . </S>",
    "<S> the survival probability of rapidity gaps accompanying hard subprocesses was studied . </S>",
    "<S> the nature of the pomeron , before and after qcd , was exposed , and some aspects of small @xmath0 physics at the lhc were considered . </S>",
    "<S> the second topic of the workshop concerned the accuracy of the luminosity measuring processes at the lhc . </S>",
    "<S> attention concentrated on three methods . </S>",
    "<S> the classic approach based on the optical theorem , secondly , the observation of the pure qed process of lepton - pair ( @xmath1 ) production by photon - photon fusion and , finally , the measurement of inclusive @xmath2 and @xmath3 production .    plus 2 mm minus 2 mm 23.0 cm 17.0 cm -1.0 in -42pt    ippp/01/13 + dcpt/01/26 + 27 march 2001 +    * summary talk : * +   +    * luminosity determination at the lhc * + a.d . </S>",
