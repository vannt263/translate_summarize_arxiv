    "more than a half century ago , dirac s paper on the forms of relativistic dynamics @xcite introduced the front - form hamiltonian approach .",

    "the reemergence of front - form dynamics was largely motivated by simplicity as well as physicality .",
    "the light - front approach has the largest stability group @xcite of any hamiltonian theory .",
    "today the physical connection to light - front dynamics is transparent : hard scattering processes probe a light - cone correlation of the fields . not surprisingly , then , many perturbative qcd applications can be treated on the light front , see e.g. @xcite . outside this realm , physics on the light cone",
    "has been extensively developed for non - perturbative qcd @xcite as well as applied to nuclear physics @xcite .",
    "recently we investigated current matrix elements in the light - front bethe - salpeter formalism @xcite , at task originally attempted in @xcite .",
    "as an example , we considered the ladder approximation for the covariant kernel in the weak - binding limit .",
    "we calculated @xmath0-dimensional electromagnetic form factors in this reduction scheme to demonstrate the replacement of non - wave function vertices ( as coined in @xcite ) with contributions from higher fock states .",
    "these higher fock states originate from the light - front energy pole - structure of the bethe - salpeter and photon vertices .",
    "below , we take the model into @xmath1 dimensions and make clear the connection to higher fock components by explicitly constructing the three - body wave function from our expressions for form factors .",
    "additionally we show how the normalization of the covariant bethe - salpeter equation turns into a familiar many - body normalization in the light - front reduction .",
    "the immediate application of our development for form factors ( in a frame where the plus - component of the momentum transfer is non - zero ) is to compute generalized parton distributions .",
    "connection is again made to the fock space representation and continuity of the distributions is put under scrutiny .",
    "the formalism is also employed to obtain time - like form factors .",
    "this latter application in interesting since no fock space expansion in terms of bound states is possible .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "first in section [ thenorm ] we review the normalization of the covariant bethe - salpeter wave function and then proceed to derive the light - front reduced version .",
    "this necessitates a review of the light - front reduction notation introduced in @xcite .",
    "the normalization condition resembles a diagonal matrix element of a pseudo current and has contributions from higher fock states .",
    "we calculate the explicit normalization condition for the ladder model at next - to - leading order in perturbation theory .",
    "the connection to the familiar many - body fock state normalization is made in appendix [ oftopt ] .",
    "next in section [ gpds ] , we use the reduction scheme to calculate generalized parton distributions .",
    "we do so by using the integrand of the electromagnetic form factor calculated in an arbitrary frame ( these expressions in @xmath1 dimensions are collected in appendix [ fff ] where the leading - order bound - state equation for the wave function also appears ) .",
    "we discuss the continuity of these distributions in terms of relations between fock components at vanishing plus momentum .",
    "connection is also made to the overlap representation of generalized parton distributions .",
    "application of the reduction scheme to time - like form factors and their related generalized distribution amplitudes is presented in section [ gda ] .",
    "finally we conclude with a brief summary ( section [ summy ] ) .",
    "in @xcite the relation between the four - dimensional bethe - salpeter wave function and the reduced light - front wave function was presented .",
    "the normalization of the reduced wave function , however , was not discussed in much detail and will be addressed below .",
    "let @xmath2 denote the two - particle disconnected propagator , where @xmath3 labels the total momentum .",

    "one can deduce the covariant normalization condition @xcite by application of lhpital s rule @xmath13 the normalization takes the form of a diagonal matrix element of a pseudo current .",

    "when @xmath41 we pick up the residue at the double pole .",
    "part of the residue is subtracted by the @xmath22 term ; the other half depends on @xmath42 . the second term in eq .",
    "is evaluated identically up to @xmath43 . now combining the two terms and their relevant @xmath44 functions",
    ", we can rewrite the result using the explicit form of the one - boson exchange potential eq .",
    "[ obe ] , namely    @xmath45    thus although the covariant derivative s action on the potential vanishes , we can manipulate the correction to the normalization into the form of a derivative s action on the light - front , time - ordered potential . with this form",
    ", we can compare to the familiar nonvalence probability discussed in appendix [ oftopt ] ( in the frame where @xmath46 with @xmath47 as the eigenvalue of the light - front hamiltonian , denoted @xmath48 in eq .  ) .",
    "here we have seen that the normalization of the light - cone wave function includes effects from higher fock states .",
    "since this normalization condition stemmed from a diagonal matrix element of a pseudo current , we should not be surprised that matrix elements of the electromagnetic current , when treated in this reduction scheme , pick up contributions from higher fock states .",
    "these higher fock contributions appear explicitly and are the subject of the next section .",
    "having worked through matrix elements of the electromagnetic current in a frame where @xmath49 @xcite , we can now make the connection to generalized parton distributions ( gpds ) .",
    "these distributions , which in some sense are the natural interpolating functions between form factors and quark distribution functions , turn up in a variety of hard exclusive processes , e.g. deeply virtual compton scattering , wide - angle compton scattering and the electro - production of mesons @xcite .",
    "the scattering amplitude for these processes factorizes into a convolution of a hard part ( calculable from perturbative qcd ) and a soft part which the gpds encode . since light - cone correlations are probed in these hard processes , the soft physics has a simple interpretation and expression in terms of light - front wave functions @xcite . in this section , we cast our results for form factors @xcite in the language of gpds and the light cone fock space expansion .",
    "the @xmath1-dimensional expressions for form factors are presented in appendix [ fff ] .",
    "additionally one can obtain these results directly from time - ordered perturbation theory using two - body projection operators as explicated in appendix [ oftopt ] .",

    "hence one can calculate these distributions from the integrand of the form factor . in this way , the light - cone correlation defined in eq .",
    "has a natural description in terms of light - front time - ordered perturbation theory , e.g. for @xmath55 the relevant graphs contributing to the gpd are in figure [ ftri ] and [ ftri2 ] , and those for @xmath56 are in figure [ fzzz ] .",
    "conversion of the contributions to the form factor into gpds is straightforward using eq .  ; we merely remove @xmath57 and @xmath58 from eqs .",
    "( [ fflo]-[fs2 ] ) . in order for the deeply virtual compton scattering amplitude to factorize into hard and soft pieces ( at leading twist ) ,",
    "the gpds @xmath59 must be continuous at @xmath60 .",
    "maintaining continuity at the crossover is more pressing because experiments which measure the beam - spin asymmetry are limited to the crossover @xcite .",
    "the leading - order expressions are continuous .",
    "this is easy to see since the contribution for @xmath61 is identically zero .",
    "the valence contribution for @xmath55 is a convolution of wave functions one of which is @xmath62 which is probed at the end point since @xmath63 . from the bound - state equation eq .",
    ", we see the two - body wave function vanishes quadratically at the end points .",
    "taking into account the overall weight @xmath64 , the valence piece vanishes linearly at the crossover . at leading order",
    "then , continuity is maintained at the crossover , while the derivative is discontinuous .",
    "working only in the valence sector , valence quark models will never be of any use to beam - spin asymmetry measurements since the value at the crossover requires one wave function to be at an end point .",
    "in the three - body bound state problem ( e.g. the nucleon ) , the valence gpd will vanish only if the three - body interaction is non - singular at the end points ( which is physically reasonable and perturbatively true ) .",
    "let us now check the next - to - leading order contributions to the gpd for continuity .",
    "first we shall deal with the term stemming from iterating the bethe - salpeter equation for the initial state ( see diagram @xmath65 of figure [ ftri2 ] ) .",
    "since there is no z - graph generated from iterating the initial state , we expect this contribution to vanish .",
    "looking at the expression , we see again @xmath66 which vanishes linearly as @xmath67 .",
    "moreover there are the interaction terms : @xmath68 which is finite as @xmath67 , and @xmath69 which vanishes at the crossover .",
    "thus not only does the initial - state iteration term vanish at the crossover , its derivative does so as well .",
    "now we investigate the born terms [ bt1 ] ( see diagram @xmath70 of figure [ ftri2 ] ) and [ bt2 ] ( see diagram @xmath71 of figure [ fzzz ] ) at the crossover . approaching @xmath72 from above , we have the finite contribution at the crossover    @xmath73    on the other hand , approaching the crossover from below we have to deal with singularities as @xmath74 .",
    "writing out the propagator for the quark - antiquark pair heading off to annihilation , we see @xmath75 this linear vanishing cancels the weight @xmath76 .",
    "taking the limit @xmath67 then produces equation and thus the born terms are continuous .",

    "but for an interpretation in terms of a four - body wave function , all four particles must propagate at the same time .",
    "this is a subtle issue as a graph containing the product of two independently time - ordered pieces ( where one leads to a bound - state vertex ) corresponds to a sum of infinitely many time - ordered graphs .",
    "it is easiest to write out the terms of concern in terms of the propagators poles .",

    "we can introduce a factor of the time - ordered interaction .",

    "since we iterated the interaction , however , this new contribution is no longer at leading order and can be neglected .",
    "thus the second term in does not contribute at this order .",
    "having manipulated the gpds into non - diagonal overlaps for @xmath61 , we must wonder if continuity at the crossover is still maintained . in the limit @xmath67 the light - front energy of the struck quark goes to infinity .",

    "this weak binding model for behavior at the crossover is a simple example of the relations between fock components at the end points ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "more general relations must be permitted from the equations of motion to guarantee lorentz covariance ( e.g. in the structure of the mellin moments of the gpds , of which the sum rule is a special case ) . here",
    ", of course , lorentz symmetry is broken .",
    "infinitely many light - cone time - ordered graphs are needed in the reduced kernel to reproduce the covariant one - boson exchange .",

    "we state the results of these calculations in @xmath1 dimensions .",

    "on the other hand , for @xmath56 we have    @xmath178    where @xmath179 and @xmath180 denotes the photon s relative momentum .",
    "this expression is diagram @xmath71 in figure [ fzzz ] .",
    "the next leading - order term is the initial - state iteration @xmath181 .",
    "the only contribution is for @xmath55 , namely @xmath182 which corresponds to diagram @xmath65 of figure [ ftri2 ] .",
    "lastly there is the final - state iteration term @xmath183 .",
    "for @xmath55 we have @xmath184 where implicitly @xmath185 and @xmath186 .",

    ", the expression @xmath187 corresponds to diagram @xmath79 of figure [ fzzz ] .",
    "( [ fflo]-[fs2 ] ) are then the complete expressions for the form factor up to first order .",
    "the results of this paper can similarly be achieved directly from `` old - fashioned '' time - ordered perturbation theory in a form which utilizes projecting onto the two - body subspace of the full fock space .",
    "for a nice , complete discussion of this formalism for the light - cone ladder model , see @xcite . in this appendix",
    ", we show how to derive higher fock space components in this formalism , thereby demonstrating the generation of higher components from the lowest sector we found indirectly for gpds and form factors in section [ gpds ] .",
    "we write the light - cone hamiltonian as a sum of a free piece and an interacting piece which carries an explicit power of the weak coupling @xmath188 . in an obvious notation",
    "this is @xmath189 the free term @xmath190 is diagonal in the fock state basis , while the interaction generally mixes components of different particle number ( in the scalar model we consider above , the interaction is completely off - diagonal since there are no instantaneous terms ) .",
    "let us suppose that in the full fock basis , we have an eigenstate of the hamiltonian , i.e. @xmath191 where the eigenvalue is labeled by @xmath48 . since the coupling is presumed small , the mixing of fock components with a large number of particles will be small .",
    "thus one imagines our bound state will be dominated by the two - body fock component .    to make this observation formal , we define projections operators on the fock space @xmath192 and @xmath193 in the usual sense .",
    "the operator @xmath192 projects out only the two - particle subspace of the full fock space and hence @xmath193 projects out the compliment .",
    "let us define the action of these operators on our eigenstate @xmath194 as is well known , combination of eqs",
    ".   and leads to the following equation for the two - body fock component @xmath195 where the effective two - body hamiltonian is @xmath196 and we have defined the following notation for any operators @xmath70 and @xmath65 , @xmath197 .",
    "the effective two - body interaction @xmath198 defined in equation is dependent upon the energy eigenvalue @xmath48 since we have suppressed the degrees of freedom of the @xmath193 subspace .",
    "the relation between the @xmath193-space probability ( i.e. the non - valence contribution ) and the effective interaction appears @xmath199    in a weak - binding limit , we can series expand the effective interaction in powers of the coupling and thereby re - derive the light - front potential .",
    "given that every boson emitted must be absorbed in the two - quark sector , we can have only an even number of interactions and hence @xmath200 so , for example , at leading order we have all possible ways to propagate from the two - body sector and back with only two interactions in between .",
    "the diagrams in figure [ fobep ] correspond to the two possibilities distinguished by the action of @xmath201 between interactions . at the next order ,",
    "we have all possible ways to propagate from two bodies to two bodies with four interactions in between , _ etc_.    to generate higher fock components from the two - body sector , we necessarily must look at the @xmath193-space state arrived at from eqs",
    ".   and @xmath202 to generate an @xmath146-body fock component from this state , we merely act with an @xmath146-body projection operator which we shall denote @xmath203 .",
    "similar to the above , we expand in powers of the coupling to find @xmath204 for example , the leading - order three - body state is obtained by attaching a boson to a quark line in the only two possible ways ( and adding the light - front energy denominator at the end ) . with these three - body states , we can consider all possible three - to - three overlaps that would contribute to the form factor .",
    "these are depicted in figure [ ftri2 ] ( with the exception of a quark self - interaction ) .",
    "the four - body sector is richer since there are two - boson , two - quark states as well as four - quark states .",
    "the two - to - four overlaps required for gpds must have four quarks . at leading order , we generate the diagrams encountered above in figure [ fzzz ] .",
    "not surprisingly directly applying time - ordered perturbation theory from a light - front hamiltonian agrees with our derivation above from covariant perturbation theory in the bethe - salpeter formalism .",
