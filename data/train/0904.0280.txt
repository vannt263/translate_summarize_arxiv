    "irc+10216 ( neugebauer & leighton 1969 ) is the most studied carbon star .",
    "because of proximity ( distance of 135 pc ( le bertre 1997 ) ) , it shows a very rich spectrum of molecular and atomic lines particularly at millimeter and submillimeter wavelengths ( e.g. , groesbeck et al .",
    "1994 ) . as such",
    ", irc+10216 is an important target for circumstellar and interstellar chemistry .",
    "the carbon star is a red giant that is evolving toward the post asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) phase .",
    "it has a high mass - loss rate of up to 10@xmath7 yr@xmath8 , and is therefore enshrouded by optically thick circumstellar shells .",
    "observing maser transitions of various molecules towards evolved stars is a powerful tool to study their innermost circumstellar envelopes , in particular the recent mass - loss activities and history of such stars .",
    "silicon monoxide ( sio ) , water ( h@xmath9o ) and hydroxyl ( oh ) maser transitions have been most frequently used to investigate the innermost mass - loss activities of oxygen rich evolved stars @xcite .",
    "hydrogen cyanide ( hcn ) is one of the most abundant molecular species in the circumstellar envelopes of carbon stars @xcite and is known to show maser action in various vibrational states ( e.g. , ziurys & turner 1986 for @xmath10 1 ; izumiura et al . 1995 for @xmath11=0 ) . since hcn is a linear triatomic molecule ,",
    "it has three fundamental vibrational modes , ( @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 ) ; @xmath12 is the c ",
    "h stretching mode , @xmath13 is the doubly degenerate bending mode , and @xmath14 is the c ",
    "n stretching mode .",
    "many observational studies have been done using hcn transitions in the circumstellar envelope of irc+10216 and other carbon stars .",
    "amazingly , some of the hcn maser lines are in very high energy levels ( 4000 k or above ) , far above than the temperature of the photosphere or the dust temperature of the region .",
    "the hcn component in the @xmath11=(0 , 1@xmath15 , 1 ) state , which is one of the high energy level transitions , is known to perturb with the @xmath11=(0 , 4@xmath16 , 0 ) state through coriolis interaction @xcite , first empirically identified by gebbie et al .",
    "the ( 0 , 1@xmath15 , 1 ) and ( 0 , 4@xmath16 , 0 ) system have a high amplification in the 336.5 and 310.9 @xmath17 m lines due to the fact that the vibrational transition moments are sharply peaked at @xmath18 @xcite .",
    "these rovibrational transitions were detected towards irc+10216 @xcite .",
    "this paper reports detections of two other lines at such high energy levels . @xcite used the plateau de bure interferometer to study the details of the inner circumstellar envelope of irc+10216 with the @xmath11=(0 , 2@xmath16 , 0 ) @xmath19 transition at 3 mm and they confirmed that the emission may be weak maser emission occurring in an acceleration region of the circumstellar envelope .",
    "however , the components of the maser were not significantly resolved with their beam size of 2.4@xmath2 1.1 .",
    "the extended submillimeter array ( esma ) is a heterogeneous array that combines the signals detected with the eight 6-meter submillimeter array ( sma ) antennas , the caltech submillimeter observatory ( cso ) 10.4 meter telescope , and the james clerk maxwell telescope ( jcmt ) 15 meter telescope , operating at short millimeter and submillimeter wavelengths . including the cso in the interferometer",
    ", one can extend the longest baseline up to @xmath0782 meters , which improves the spatial resolution by @xmath040 % .",
    "the esma is one of the instruments that allows us to study the gas distribution and the kinematics of the innermost circumstellar envelope of this carbon star in detail where the acceleration of the gas is taking place .",
    "here we report an observational study on the properties of the innermost circumstellar envelope of irc+10216 using hcn and other molecular lines with the esma .",
    "we detected a few hot hcn lines including the one in the @xmath11=(0 , 1@xmath15 , 1 ) state mentioned in previous paragraph .",
    "we observed irc+10216 with hcn @xmath20 transitions in various vibrational states along with other molecular transitions with the esma @xcite on 2008 april 14 ( ut ) .",
    "the total bandwidth of @xmath0 4 ghz ( 2 ghz from each sideband , i.e. , 264.357 @xmath21 266.337 ghz and 274.357 @xmath21 276.338 ghz ) was covered with a frequency resolution of 812.5 khz .",
    "the data were taken under moderate weather conditions with zenith opacities of @xmath22 0.15  0.18 measured at 225 ghz .",
    "atmospheric opacities at the observing frequency were not measured during the observation , however , they are close to what we measured at 225 ghz because these frequencies are close .",
    "integration time for one data point was 30 seconds .",
    "the track lasted 5.5 hours , and about 4 hours of on - source data were acquired .",
    "the sma was configured in its very extended array ( maximum baselines to 508 m ) ; the esma then covered baselines ranging from 25 to 782 m ( @xmath0 20 to 692 k@xmath23 or @xmath0 0.2 to 10 ) .",

    "= 131643.898 ( j2000 ) .",
    "the synthesized beam size was 0.46 @xmath2 0.22 with a position angle of 39.9 .",
    "data reduction and calibration were done using the mir packagecqi / mircook.html ] including passband and gain calibrations as well as continuum subtraction .",
    "irc+10216 was observed together with quasars 3c273 and 1058 + 015 .",
    "passband calibration was done using the afore mentioned quasars .    to make the esma observations ,",
    "we used half wave plates ( hwps ) at the jcmt and at the cso to try to match the polarization angles of the receiver mixers with those at the sma antennas . based on an aperture efficiency of 75% of the sma antennas , the estimated aperture efficiencies of the jcmt and the cso telescopes were found to be 40% and 30% , respectively .",
    "the cso s aperture efficiency is typically @xmath27 60% when the telescope is used as a single - dish telescope .",
    "the degraded efficiency of the cso telescope was due to a failure of the computer that controlled the hwp .",
    "the polarization angle of the cso s mixer on the sky was not matched to the sma s .",
    "the receiver temperatures of the sma antennas and the cso antenna ranged from @xmath0 85 to 140 k , while the jcmt antenna s receiver temperature was @xmath0 290 k. the double sideband system temperature of the sma antennas and the cso telescope were ranging between @xmath0 200  500 k , while the double sideband system temperature of the jcmt telescope was ranging between @xmath0 300  600 k.    while the continuum emission of irc+10216 is marginally resolved on the longest baselines ( see section [ continuum ] ) , we have performed self - calibration of the visibility phase gains using the continuum , approximated by a point source , as our primary phase calibration step .",
    "flux calibration was achieved by setting the continuum component of irc+10216 to 1.18 jy , consistent with well calibrated observations obtained in the sma compact array in march 2008 whose beam size was about 3 .",
    "based on the estimated flux of 1.18 jy for irc+10216 , the calculated flux of the quasar 1058 + 015 was 2.53 jy , which was 9 % higher than the flux in the calibrator catalog measured on the same date ( 2008 april 17 ) .",
    "since the quasar is linearly polarized by @xmath0 25  30 % at this frequency , the 9% difference may be due to polarization . note that , by applying self - calibration using the continuum component of irc+10216 , the data taken on the quasar 1058 + 015 showed that atmospheric decorrelation was eliminated significantly even on long baselines .",
    "image processing including clean was done using astronomical image processing system ( aips ) with natural weighting of the visibilities .",
    "natural weighting was chosen to achieve a high signal - to - noise ratio for detecting and imaging weak components along with strong ones . comparing the data taken with the sma with the data taken with the esma",
    ", it was found that the inclusion of the cso and jcmt antennas , i.e. the esma , improved the signal - to - noise ratio on the longest baselines by  40% compared to that of the sma alone . in order to estimate missing flux of the two hcn transitions in the @xmath11=0 and ( 0 , 1@xmath28 , 0 ) states",
    ", we obtained a single - dish spectrum of the two hcn transitions with the jcmt on 2008 may 11th ( ut ) .",
    "the spectrum was acquired at an elevation near 30 .",
    "the main beam efficiency was measured to be 65% with a beam size of @xmath0 19   at 266 ghz , by using the continuum emission of saturn .",
    "we used 106.5 k for the main beam temperature of the planet . note that the deep ph@xmath29 absorption feature @xcite of the planet was taken into account when estimating the main beam temperature of the planet at 266 ghz .",
    "conversion from the @xmath30 scale to flux density scale was achieved with a conversion factor of 32 jy k@xmath8 for the jcmt data .",
    "continuum data were created from the portions of the spectra which appear to be free from line emission .",
    "figure [ f1 ] shows visibility amplitude versus uv distance of the continuum component originating from the circumstellar dust , and photosphere of the central star , at @xmath0 1.1 mm .",
    "the data points were averaged over every @xmath0 5 k@xmath23 .",
    "the falloff of visibility amplitude with uv distance demonstrates that the continuum component is spatially extended and partially resolved . in figure 1",
    ", one can find that the amplitude is flattened at 400 k@xmath23 .",
    "this means that there are components contributing to the continuum emission which are smaller than 27 @xmath1 or 62 au in size . on the baselines shorter than 400 k@xmath23 , the amplitude of the continuum emission rises as going towards shorter baseline length , which means that there are continuum components which we resolved whose radii @xmath27 27 @xmath1 .",
    "@xmath1 is estimated to be @xmath0 500 = 3.5 @xmath2 10@xmath31 cm @xcite .",
    "it is known that the continuum emission of irc+10216 varies with a period of 635 days at submillimeter as well as optical wavelengths @xcite . at 850@xmath17 m ,",
    "the average flux is 8.8 jy and it changes by @xmath32 0.95 jy due to the pulsation @xcite . taking the sinusoidal curve of figure 7 in @xcite , at the time when the object was observed in 2008 march and april ,",
    "the object is expected to be in the maximum phase ( phase of 0.015 by counting from the maximum phase ) .",
    "@xcite measured that the star s continuum emission extends up to 50   at the 3@xmath33 level of their measurements at 1.3 mm .",
    "the continuum emission measured from our jcmt observation was 3.7 jy at 1.1 mm , which is consistent with measurements done by other authors ( e.g. , dehaes et al .",
    "@xcite estimated the continuum emission from the stellar photosphere would be 0.55 jy at 1 mm .",
    "it suggests that about half of the total continuum emission imaged with the esma may be due to the emission of the stellar photosphere , considering the measured flux of the continuum component with the sma was 1.18 jy ( see section 2 ) .",
    "the rest of the flux measured with the esma may come from circumstellar dust components and low - level line emission which were not individually detected .",
    "figure [ f2 ] shows the spectra of hcn @xmath20 transitions in the @xmath11=0 and ( 0 , 1@xmath28 , 0 ) states over sky frequency ( @xmath34 ) taken at the jcmt and at the esma , respectively .",
    "figure [ f3 ] shows the comparison of the @xmath20 , @xmath35(0 , 1@xmath28 , 0 ) lines observed with the jcmt and the esma more closely . the esma spectra shown in figure [ f2 ] and [ f3 ] were produced from a spectral cube generated by the image processing . to create the spectrum ,",
    "a region was specified which includes all emission of the transitions detected above 3@xmath33 level in the total integrated intensity map of the transitions .",
    "@xcite observed hcn @xmath20 , @xmath11=(0 , 1@xmath28 , 0 ) transition in 1986 march at the kitt peak 12 m telescope . the stellar phase in 1986 march was near minimum .",
    "the peak flux observed in 2008 april was @xmath0 25 % higher than that observed in 1986 .",
    "the increased flux might be due to variability of the stellar luminosity . while both the hcn @xmath20 , @xmath11=0 and ( 0 , 1@xmath28 , 0 ) single - dish spectra show a typical parabolic - shape profile that traces the expanding envelope , the line profiles of the transitions taken with the interferometer have strange irregular shapes with a few peaky components .",
    "the fractions of the flux in the @xmath11=0 and ( 0 , 1@xmath28 , 0 ) states detected by the esma are only 1 and 45 % of the emission detected by the jcmt .",
    "please note that the size of the jcmt s beam corresponds to 1.1 @xmath2 10@xmath36 @xmath1 (= 2.6 @xmath2 10@xmath36 au ) .",
    "the rest , i.e. , the missing components , probably originating in the expanding envelope , are resolved out with this array configuration .",
    "the size of the missing components is unknown because mapping observation using a single - dish telescope has not done .    for the line data sets , we discuss only the detected compact components .",
    "physical properties estimated from the velocity widths follow in sections [ distribution ] and [ linewidth ] .",
    "in addition to the two hcn transitions above , seven other molecular transitions are clearly detected ( figure 4 ) .",
    "one of the detected hcn transitions is in the vibrational state of ( 0 , 1@xmath15 , 1 ) , mentioned in section 1 .",
    "molecular lines were identified mainly by comparing the observed frequencies with the line catalogs provided by nist ( slaim ) , jpl and universit@xmath37 t zu k@xmath38ln ( cdms ) .",
    "when there were multiple candidates for a spectral line feature , we checked the expected line strengths of the different transitions over the observed frequency ranges and identified most likely one .",
    "for the lines that do nt have other transitions in the band , we selected most likely one considering expected abundance in the circumstellar region .",
    "table [ tbl-1 ] summarizes features of nine lines detected with the esma .",
    "it includes an isotopologue of silicon monosulfide , si@xmath4s ( @xmath11=0 ) , potassium chloride , kcl ( @xmath39 ) , and two other hcn transitions in different vibrational states , @xmath11=(1 , 1@xmath15 , 0 ) and ( 0 , 1@xmath15 , 1 ) .",
    "the excitation temperatures of these transitions are about 5800 k and 4000 k , respectively .",
    "the hcn @xmath40 line has a relatively large shift to the red ( @xmath0 2.7 mhz or 3 ) .",
    "this may be due to absorption from the hyperfine transitions @xcite because of the nitrogen s quadrapole coupling .",
    "the rest of the lines have smaller differences between the catalog and observed frequencies ( @xmath3 700 khz ) .",
    "the central velocities of molecular transitions may be slightly shifted because ( 1 ) some of the circumstellar shells are not perfect shells , ( 2 ) evolution of the molecular species , ( 3 ) optical depth of the molecular lines , and so on .",
    "the excitation of the hcn transitions will be discussed in section [ excitation ] .",
    "the distributions of these hot hcn transitions will be described in section [ distribution ] .",
    "we detected the @xmath41 transition of kcl in the @xmath39 state .",
    "kcl was first detected at 3 mm by @xcite along with other metals in the circumstellar envelope of irc+10216 .",
    "the transitions they detected were all in the @xmath40 state .",
    "this is the first detection of a kcl transition in a vibrationally excited state .",
    "the si@xmath4s @xmath42 transition has a broader line width ( full width at half maximum of @xmath0 9.2 ) with two peaks .",
    "it seems to have a wing component on the red - shifted side .",
    "the broad line feature of si@xmath4s might be due to blending from other molecular line(s ) .",
    "however , the lines near the frequency were not found in the available catalogs .",
    "the line shapes of these transitions will be discussed in section [ linewidth ] .",
    "the maps of these molecular transitions are shown in section [ distribution ] .",
    "there were four other spectral features whose phases are tightly clustered within @xmath0 50   from zero over @xmath27 6  10 , signifying higher likelihood of detection , albeit at much lower amplitudes compared to the nine molecular lines described above .",
    "their frequencies of 265.311 , 265.323 , 265.347 , and 265.449 ghz , are marked as a , b , c and d in figure [ f4 ] .",
    "these four features are likely detections .",
    "excitation of the hcn lines in three different vibrational states and the kcl line are of interest because they exist in the innermost circumstellar envelope where dust and molecular species are forming and the molecular gas is being accelerated ( see section [ linewidth ] ) .",
    "the excitation temperatures of the lower energy levels of these transitions , @xmath0 5800 k for the @xmath11=(1 , 1@xmath15 , 0 ) state and @xmath0 4000 k for the @xmath11=(0 , 1@xmath15 , 1 ) state , are much higher than the temperature at the inner edge of the envelope ( 600  1700 k ; e.g. , menshchikov et al .",
    "2001 and references therein ) .",
    "it would be difficult to excite the transitions collisionally unless very high density gas ( @xmath27 10@xmath43 @xmath44 or so ) is present in a large region ( @xmath27 5@xmath0 700 au or @xmath0 300 @xmath1 ) .",
    "it s very unlikely that the condition is achieved for this case .",
    "the upper level of the molecules may be populated directly through the strong radiation of the stellar photosphere .",
    "figure [ f5 ] illustrates energy diagrams of selected transitions of hcn , h@xmath9 , and co. the observed rotational lines in three different vibrational states are drawn by thin horizontal lines and are magnified in the diagram .",
    "we propose that some of the hcn lines may be pumped through interaction with photons of some transitions of molecular hydrogen , those of co lines , and the stellar radiation .",
    "the stellar luminosity of irc+10216 is @xmath0 2 @xmath2 10@xmath45 l@xmath46 and the peak of the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of the object is near 10 @xmath17 m ( e.g. cernicharo et al . 1999 ) . in the near infrared band which is near the peak of the sed , such as at 2.5 , 3.5 , and 14 @xmath17 m",
    ", the molecules may be pumped to the vibrational states of hcn in the @xmath11=(1 , 1@xmath47 , 0 ) , ( 0 , 1@xmath47.1 ) , ( 0 , 1@xmath48 , 0 ) , ( 1 , 0@xmath16 , 0 ) , and ( 0 , 0@xmath16 , 1 ) states from the ground level to the exited states via the stellar radiation . figure [ f5 ] also shows the excitation temperatures of h@xmath49 1 state are close to that of the hcn ( 1 , 1@xmath50 , 0 ) state and some of the transitions have energy levels very similar to that of hcn ( 1 , 1@xmath50 , 0 ) state , indicating that a direct and rapid photon exchange can occur among the transitions .",
    "furthermore , since co @xmath51 transition is at @xmath0 2.5 @xmath17 m , such photon exchange can occur with the hcn @xmath52 state as well .    the same excitation method , namely direct pumping from the strong infrared radiation at @xmath014 @xmath17 m of the stellar photosphere , can explain the excitation of the kcl transition in the @xmath39 state .",
    "these hot hcn lines and the kcl line may be maser lines as the stellar radiation must excite the transitions .",
    "if so , the maser lines of the transitions may not be fully saturated because their flux is not high .",
    "integrated intensity maps of hot hcn @xmath20 emission in the @xmath11=(1 , 1@xmath15 , 0 ) and @xmath11=(0 , 1@xmath15 , 1 ) states are shown in figure [ f6 ] ( a ) and ( b ) respectively .",
    "the distribution of the emission is not spatially resolved .",
    "the peak of the emission coincides with the stellar position .",
    "the radius of the distribution is less than 15 @xmath1 .",
    "the compact distribution supports the scenario that the pumping arises close to the stellar photosphere or at inner edge of the circumstellar envelope .",
    "figure [ f6 ] ( c ) and",
    "( d ) show the integrated intensity maps of the transitions of kcl and si@xmath4s .",
    "both maps show that the emission originates from a region very close to the central star , very similar to the hcn maps of the @xmath11=(1 , 1@xmath15 , 0 ) and @xmath11=(0 , 1@xmath15 , 1 ) states .",
    "both of the kcl component and the si@xmath4s component are not significantly resolved .",
    "the si@xmath4s emission is partially resolved . however , most of the emission originates from a compact region near the central star .",
    "the compact distribution of the si@xmath4s @xmath42 @xmath40 transition and the peaky line features ( figure [ f4 ] ) may indicate that part of the emission arises from maser action .",
    "the distribution of kcl @xmath39 emission is very compact and the emission is not spatially resolved , most likely tracing inner edge of the envelope .",
    "total integrated intensity maps of the hcn @xmath11=(0 , 1@xmath28 , 0 ) and @xmath40 transitions are shown in figure [ f7 ] .",
    "in contrast to the maps shown in figure [ f6 ] that are not spatially resolved , the emission is much more extended .",
    "most of the emission is found within a radius of 1 , which corresponds to @xmath0 60 @xmath1 .",
    "one can find two peaks along the northwest - southeast direction on both maps .",
    "the two peaks of both maps are displaced from the stellar position . the position angles ( @xmath53 ) of the line drawing between two peak components in the @xmath11=(0 , 1@xmath28 , 0 ) and in the @xmath40 states are 115   and 130 , respectively .",
    "the distances of the two condensations of the @xmath11=(0 , 1@xmath28 , 0 ) map are 90 mas and 300 mas from the central star .",
    "the two condensations of @xmath40 map are distributed more or less symmetrically at a distance of 200 mas from the central star . in the region at a distance of 200 mas from the star , the gas temperature is estimated to be a few 100 k ( e.g. , keady et al .",
    "@xcite reported that there are features with a low degree of linear polarization identified at 1.5 @xmath17 m in continuum emission .",
    "the authors concluded that low degree of linear polarization found inside the two features indicates that the density in the two regions is higher than that of the surrounding region .",
    "the two features called nw ellipse and se fan by @xcite may be the same entities as the two hcn peaks traced with the hcn @xmath20 transition in the @xmath11=(0 , 1@xmath28 , 0 ) state , because of their similarity in shapes , p.a . , and the fact that both of them trace high density regions . however , comparing the locations of the polarization minima reported by @xcite and the hcn @xmath11=(0 , 1@xmath28 , 0 ) peaks in figure [ f7 ] ( left ) relative to the position of the central star , the hcn peaks are located at a distance from the central star only 60% of the distance between the polarization minima from the star .",
    "please note that @xcite estimated the location of the central star based on their polarization map .",
    "it is not clear why the hcn peaks and the near infrared polarization minima lie on different locations . if it were due to time evolution , the two hcn peaks and the polarization minima might be tracing different entities because the hcn peaks are located closer compared to the polarization minima . it could be that the hcn peaks detected this time in 2008 might not have existed clearly when murakawa et al made the observation in 2003 january .",
    "however , in that case , one can say that the direction of the most copious mass loss hasnt changed over about 5 years . from the two hcn peaks and those polarization features",
    ", we propose that this direction along the two hcn peaks of the hcn transitions may correspond to the direction of most conspicuous mass loss , and that this direction is the equatorial direction of the star .",
    "this proposition is consistent with the analysis of @xcite who discussed that the two linear polarization features may indicate the formation of an edge - on dust torus surrounding the carbon star .",
    "discussion on the kinematics of the two hcn peaks and other surrounding components will follow in next section .",
    "note that there are a few other high angular resolution observations at near infrared ( e.g. , weigelt et al .",
    "2002 ; menut et al .",
    "2007 ) . however , the location of the central star in their maps is uncertain so that it is difficult to compare their observed features with ours . in particular , we ca nt find any of likely components that may correspond to the two hcn peaks/ the two polarization minima . at near infrared ( 2.2@xmath17 m ) , @xcite and @xcite identified a 10-size bipolar reflection nebula that is produced by scattering of radiation from the star by dust particles in the region .",
    "the axis of the bipolar reflection nebula is at @xmath53 of @xmath0 30 , which is almost perpendicular to that of the most conspicuous mass - loss direction described above .",
    "the axis of the bipolar reflection nebula supports the scenario that the mass loss is most copious in the direction of the two hcn peaks shown in the maps in figure [ f7 ] and that infrared radiation can pass preferentially in the direction perpendicular to the most conspicuous mass - loss direction .    the significant difference in distribution between hcn emission in @xmath11= 0/(0 , 1@xmath28 , 0 ) states and the hcn emission in the @xmath11=(1 , 1@xmath15 , 0)/@xmath11=(0 , 1@xmath15 , 1 ) states or kcl and si@xmath4s emission leads us to conclude that there are two discrete regions in the innermost circumstellar envelope .",
    "one is a region of radius less than 15 @xmath1 where various molecular species have just formed and the gas is not accelerated by stellar radiation yet .",
    "we name this region region i. the other is a region outside of the region i , region ii , where spectral lines indicate higher expansion velocity .",
    "these two discrete regions may have been created because the size distributions of the condensed dust particles are significantly different in these regions ( see also section [ linewidth ] ) .",
    "dust nucleation may have further proceeded because temperature decreases rapidly as going outwards from the central star .",
    "we will discuss the properties of the region ii in next section .",
    "figure [ f8 ] shows channel maps of the @xmath11=(0 , 1@xmath28 , 0 ) , @xmath20 transition that illustrate the detailed internal structures of the gas in region ii .",
    "note that the systemic velocity of the object is @xmath54 .",
    "the channel maps clearly show expanding shells .",
    "the expansion velocity of the shells , derived by fitting the spectrum integrated over the whole region , is up to @xmath0 13 .",
    "the expanding shells are composed of many clumpy condensations .",
    "there are a few prominent condensations along the most copious mass - loss direction . by following the maps at different velocities ,",
    "one can identify shell - like features whose radii range from 11 to 22 @xmath1 .",
    "partial shell structures are found in the channel maps at of 3.8 and 19.3 .",
    "the velocities are noted in the upper part of each panel . in other words , in these velocity ranges , the hcn maser condensations are distributed avoiding the stellar position .",

    "they may be the smallest shell - like structures identified to date in the circumstellar envelope of this star .",
    "one can find one maser clump in the southeast side of the central star in the channel maps of 3.8  10.2 , noted in the upper part of each panel .",
    "another maser clump is found in the channel maps of 15.7  19.3   in the southeast side .",
    "assuming these two clumps are located on the east side of the rim of the torus - like feature ( see section [ distribution ] ) and the clumps have had constant expanding velocities , the medium of the clumps may have departed from the central star @xmath27 40 years ago . for the northeast side of the central star , a clump is seen in the channel maps of 4.7  13.8 , and another one is seen in the channel maps of 16.6  19.3 . assuming a similar condition , i.e.",
    ", the clumps are located on the west side of the rim of the torus - like feature ( see section [ distribution ] ) and the clump has had constant expanding velocities , the medium of the clumps may have been shed by the central star @xmath27 100 years ago .",
    "one can gain insights on the acceleration of the gas due to the stellar radiation from the observed line widths and the spatial distribution .",
    "the molecular gas is accelerated through dust by sharing their momentum through dust - gas collisions as the dust particles receive the radiation pressure .",
    "silicon carbide ( sic ) can condense into dust particle very close to the stellar photosphere at a temperature of @xmath0 1500 k ( e.g. menshchikov et al .",
    "2001 ) and they may evolve chemically as going away from the star , while graphite grains form at lower temperature of @xmath0 600 ",
    "@xmath0 1000 k or with radius of 5  20 r@xmath55 ( e.g. menshchikov et al . 2001 ) . at the inner edge of the envelope",
    ", sic may play a major role to accelerate the molecular gas outwards .",
    "one can derive the expansion velocity by fitting line profiles .",
    "the line profiles were fitted assuming the envelope is spherically symmetric and expanding uniformly with the expansion velocity .",
    "we also assumed that the turbulence and thermal velocity is much smaller than the expanding velocity and the medium is ejected from the central star .",
    "table [ tbl-1 ] summarizes the expansion velocities and frequency differences between recommended frequencies and observed central velocities measured for each line .",
    "the hcn @xmath20 transitions in the @xmath11=0 and ( 0 , 1@xmath28 , 0 ) states have broad line widths of @xmath0 13 , which is close to the terminal velocity of @xmath0 15   as observed from other molecular lines such as co @xcite and cs @xcite . in region",
    "ii , both graphite grains and sic concretion may contribute to the acceleration of the molecular gas .",
    "the esma resolved the emission in both vibrational states .",
    "the kinematics and distribution of the emission in the ( 0 , 1@xmath28 , 0 ) state are investigated in detail ( section [ distribution ] ) .",
    "it is very interesting that si@xmath4s emission has the largest expansion velocity ( @xmath0 16 ) although the distribution is compact and is not significantly resolved ( in section [ distribution ] ) .",
    "this expansion velocity is at the high end among the expansion velocities summarized in a detailed line survey study by patel et al .",
    "since the sublimation temperature of sis is 1213 k @xcite , which may correspond to the temperature in an outer layer of the stellar photosphere , the sis concretion mixtured with the sis gas might receive the radiation pressure directly from the stellar radiation , rather than the sis gas gains the momentum from surrounding dust particles in the region .",
    "the full width at half maximum of the si@xmath4s line is only 9.2 .",
    "the large expansion velocity is due to the strong wing component in the redshifted side .",
    "it is known that the sulphur is involved in shock chemistry ( e.g. blake et al .",
    "it may arise from a shock region in the innermost envelope .",
    "the cause of the broad wing emission remains unsolved . on the other hand , the rest of the lines which have lower expansion velocities of @xmath3 7 , namely , hcn in the @xmath11=(1 , 1@xmath15 , 0 ) and ( 1 , 1@xmath15 , 0 ) states , the emission of kcl in the @xmath11=2 state , and all three unidentified lines , must be tracing the very innermost part of the envelope because the velocity becomes larger as a function of distance from the stellar photosphere @xcite .",
    "the lowest expansion velocity is that for the hcn line in the @xmath11=(1 , 1@xmath15 , 0 ) which has the highest energy level among the hcn lines .",
    "the small frequency / velocity shifts from the catalog frequencies of the narrow line width emission ( see table 1 ) also supports the scenario that the expansion velocities of those components must be very small because their velocities are close to the systemic velocity of the star .",
    "even if the molecular components of these transitions have broken shells , since the expansion velocities are small , their central velocities should come to very close to the systemic velocity of the star .",
    "using the esma , we investigated the properties of the innermost circumstellar envelope ( cse ) of the bright carbon star , irc+10216 .",
    "hcn maser emission is spatially resolved for the first time in an astronomical object .",
    "kcl maser line in a vibrationally excited state is detected for the first time .",
    "we identified two discrete regions in the innermost circumstellar envelope .",
    "one is a region with a radius of less than 15 @xmath1 where molecular species have just formed and the molecular gas has just started being accelerated by stellar radiation ( region i ) .",
    "this region is traced by hot hcn and kcl lines , and si@xmath4s line .",
    "si@xmath4s line detected in region i shows a large expansion velocity of 16 with the broad wing emission unexpectedly .",
    "this might be partly because sis is both in gas and solid phase and receives the radiation pressure directly from the strong radiation pressure from photosphere .",
    "it might be related to some kind of shock process in the innermost envelope .",
    "the other is a shell region with a radius of about 23 @xmath1 and with a thickness of @xmath0 15 @xmath1 where the expansion velocity has reached up to 13  ( region ii ) .",
    "these two discrete regions may have emerged because the size distributions of the condensed dust particles are significantly different in these regions , i.e. , region ii may hold larger dust particles or graphite grains .",
    "we identified the most copious mass loss direction using the hcn @xmath20 transition in the @xmath11=(0 , 1@xmath28 , 0 ) and @xmath40 states .",
    "we propose that this direction corresponds to the equatorial direction of the star .",
    "the direction was found to be perpendicular to the near infrared bipolar reflection nebula and to be parallel to the features with a low degree of linear polarization identified at near infrared .",
    "the kinematics in region ii are studied in detail using the hcn @xmath20 emission in the @xmath11=(0 , 1@xmath28 , 0 ) state , which shows clumpy structures .",
    "small shell - like features with a radius of 11  22 @xmath1 were identified in region ii . a torus - like feature with a radius of @xmath09 @xmath1 exists in region ii . assuming the expansion velocity has been constant , the medium of the most conspicuous hcn maser clumps may have been shed by the central star about 40 ",
    "100 years ago .",
    "we identified nine molecular transitions in total , including hot hcn @xmath20 maser transitions in the @xmath11=(0 , 1@xmath15 , 1 ) and @xmath11=(1 , 1@xmath15 , 0 ) states and kcl ( @xmath39 ) and si@xmath4s emission .",
    "these transitions may be excited directly by the strong infrared radiation from the stellar photosphere of the star and by line overlap of some of co and h@xmath9   transitions for the hcn transition in the @xmath11=(1 , 1@xmath15 , 0 ) state . from the observed line profiles , expansion velocities of each line",
    "are estimated .",
    "all the emission lines except for si@xmath4s line have expansion velocities lower than the terminal velocity of the gas ( @xmath0 15 ) in the circumstellar envelope , which means that the observed emission traces the region where the acceleration due to strong stellar radiation is taking place .",
    "the hcn transition in the @xmath11=(1 , 1@xmath15 , 0 ) state has the lowest expansion velocity of @xmath0 3 , suggesting that it arises from the innermost part of the envelope among the lines detected in this observation .",
    "region ii has an expansion velocity of 13 .",
    "future observations with esma will allow us to constrain physical and chemical properties of the innermost circumstellar envelope further in detail and construct a concrete picture of the mass loss process in a transition phase from agb to post agb / proto - planetary nebula ( ppn ) .",
