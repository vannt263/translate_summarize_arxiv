    "in a previous paper @xcite , we have carried out the @xmath0 analysis , for _ fully contained muon events _ resulting from the quasi elastic scattering(qel)@xcite obtained from our numerical experiments , namely , the most clear cut analysis for the maximum oscillation and have shown the existence of the maximum oscillations under the neutrino oscillation parameters obtained by the super - kamiokande collaboration .",
    "this fact denotes that our numerical computer experiment has been performed in right way .",
    "the maximum oscillations for the neutrino oscillation are derived from the survival probability of a given flavor , such as , @xmath5 , and it is given by    @xmath6    however , as both @xmath4 and @xmath7 are not physically measurable quantities which are attributed to the nature of neutrino and , consequently , the maximum oscillations can not be detected through analysis of @xmath0 distribution , even if they really exist . in our numerical computer experiment , we can examine another possible combinations of l / e , such as @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 besides @xmath0 .",
    "therefore , we try to examine weather the existence of the maximum oscillation can be detected through the analysis of l / e besides @xmath0 .",
    "as physical quantities which can really be observed are @xmath8 and @xmath9 instead of @xmath4 and @xmath7 , therefore we examine @xmath3 distribution .      in figures  1 and 2 , we give the @xmath3 distributions without oscillation for 1489.2 live days which is equal to the actual live days of the super - kamiokande experiment@xcite and 14892 live days , ten times as much as that of super - kamiokande experiment , respectively .",
    "similarly , figures  1 and 2 show sinusoidal - like character as in figures  6 and 7 for @xmath0 in the preceeding paper@xcite which has no relation with the oscillation , however .",
    "such the sinusoidal character represents the intersection effect due to the horizontal - like incident neutrino , partly the upward neutrinos and partly the downward neutrinos . comparing figure  1 with figure  2 ,",
    "the characteristics of the uneven histogram in figure  1 disappear in figure  2 due to ten times statistics as much as that of the figure  1 .      in figures  3 and 4",
    ", we give the @xmath3 distributions with the oscillation for 1489.2 live days and 14892 live days , respectively . in figure  3",
    ", we may observe the uneven histogram , something like dips coming from neutrino oscillation .",
    "however , in figure  4 where the statistics is ten times as much as that of figure  1 , the histogram becomes smoother and such the dips disappear , which turns out finally for the dips to be pseudo .",
    "furthermore , comparing figure  4 in the presence of neutrino oscillation with figure  2 in the absence of neutrino oscillation , it is clear that the dips which show maximum oscillation in the figure  10 in the preceeding paper@xcite are lost in the figure  4 under cover of the complicated relation between @xmath4 and @xmath8 .",
    "it is impossible to extract the neutrino oscillation parameters from the comparison of figure  4 with figure  2 .",
    "+ in figures  5 and 6 , correspondingly , we give the correlation between @xmath8 and @xmath9 for 1489.2 live days and 14892 live days , respectively .",
    "it is clear from the figures that we can not observe any combination of @xmath3 which gives the maximum oscillation on the contrary to figures  11 and 12 in the preceeding paper@xcite .",
    "namely , we may conclude that we can not observe the sinusoidal flavor transition probability of neutrino oscillation against the claim by the super - kamiokande collaboration@xcite when we adopt physically observable quantities , such as @xmath8 and @xmath9 . +    in order to confirm the disappearance of the psuedo maximum oscillations , in figures  7 and 8 , we give the survival probability of a given flavor for @xmath3 distribution , namely , + @xmath10 , for 1489.2 live days and 14892 live days , respectively . comparing figure  7 with figure  8 ,",
    "pseudo dips in figure  7 disappear in figure  8 .",
    "thus the histogram becomes a rather decreasing function of @xmath3 in figure  8 .",
    "if we further make statistics higher , the survival probability for @xmath3 distribution should be a monotonously decreasing function of @xmath3 , whithout showing any characteristics of the maximum oscillation , which is contrast to figures  8 , 9 and 10 in the preceeding paper@xcite . in conclusion , we should say that we can not find any maximum oscillation for the neutrino oscillation in the @xmath3 distribution .",
    "now , we examine the @xmath2 distribution which the super - kamiokande collaboration treat in the thier paper , expecting the evidence for the oscillatory signatuture in atmospheric neutrino oscillations .      in figures  9 and 10 , we give the @xmath2 distribution without oscillation for 1489.2 live days and 14892 live days , respectively . comparing figure  9 with figure  10 ,",
    "the larger statistics makes the distribution more smooth .",
    "also , there is sinusoidal - like dip which have no relation with neutrino oscillation .      in figures  11 and 12 ,",
    "we give the @xmath2 distribution with oscillation for 1489.2 live days and 14892 live days , respectively . in figure  11 , we may find something like dip which corresponds to the first maximum oscillation near @xmath11200 ( km / gev ) .",
    "however , such the dip disappears , by making the statistics larger as shown in figure  12 .",
    "instead , figure  12 gives the histogram with a little unnatural shape in spite of larger statistics .",
    "this may come from the complicated correlation between @xmath8 and @xmath7 , the details of which are shown partially in eq.(2 ) , eq.(3 ) and figure  5 in the preceeding paper@xcite .      instead of @xmath7 which is correctly sampled from the corresponding probability functions ,",
    "let us utilize @xmath13 which is obtained from the `` approximate '' formula ( eq.(4 ) in the preceeding paper@xcite ) .",
    "we express @xmath7 described in eq.(4 ) in the preceeding paper@xcite utilized by the super - kamiokande collaboration as @xmath13 to discriminate our @xmath7 obtained in stochastic manner correctly . in figure  13 , we give @xmath12 distribution for 14892 live days and 14892 live days , ten times as much as the super - kamiokande experiment actual live days . .",
    "if we compare figure  13 with figure  12 , we understand that there are no significant difference between them .",
    "this fact tells us that the `` aproximate '' formula for @xmath7 by the super - kamiokande collaboration , which is not suitable for the treatment of the stochastic quantities , does not produce so significant error actually , which is understandable from figure  5 in the preceeding paper@xcite . also , we can conclude that we do not find any dip corresponding to any maximum oscillation from @xmath2 or @xmath12 distributions",
    "the reason why the figures 10 and 13 can not show any dip structure , which is shown in figures from 8 to 10 in the preceeding paper@xcite clearly , comes from the situation that the role of @xmath4 is much more crucial than that of @xmath7 in the @xmath14 analysis .",
    "namely , @xmath4 can not be replaced by @xmath8 at all .",
    "also , see the discussion in the following subsection 2.3 .        in figure  14",
    ", we give @xmath1 distribution without oscillation for 14892 days , ten times as much as actual live days of the super - kamiokande experiment to consider statistical fluctuation effect as precisely as possible .",
    "it is clear from the figure that there is not any dip corresponding to the maximum oscillation which is expected to appear in the presence of the neutrino oscillation .      in figure  15 , we give the corresponding distribution with the oscillation . in figure  16 , we give the correlation diagram between @xmath4 and @xmath9which correspond to figure  15 . on the contrary to figure  14",
    ", there are surely dips in figure  15 , and furthermore we can discriminate the strip pattern in figure  16 , similarly as in the figure  12 in the preceeding paper@xcite .    therefore , we suppose from figures  15 and 16 that we may observe some quantities which is directly related to the maximum oscillations in the @xmath0 distribution . however , it seems to be difficult to extract a pair of concrete values of @xmath4 and @xmath7 through the analysis of @xmath1 distribution . comparing figure 4 with figure 5 in the preceeding paper@xcite",
    ", it is clear that @xmath4 can not be approximated by @xmath8 at all , while @xmath7 can be approximated by @xmath9 within some allowance ( see figure  5 in the preceeding paper@xcite ) .",
    "thus , the @xmath1 distribution can show some similar structure to @xmath0 distribution .",
    "this fact shows that the role of @xmath4 is essentially important compared with @xmath7 in the @xmath14 analysis .",
    "however , it should be noticed again that we can not observe the @xmath1 distribution physically even if the dips surely exist in this distribution , because @xmath4 is the physically unobservable quantity .",
    "as the super - kamiokande collaboration think that they can approximate @xmath8 nearly equal to @xmath4 and @xmath7 is well approximated by eq.(4 ) , their experimental data should be compared with our @xmath0 distribution . + in figure  17 , we compare our numerical experimental data for _ fully contained events _ due to qel with the corresponding one by the super - kamiokande experiment ( read from figure 8.22 @xcite ) . in the light of the correct distribution , uncertainties in the distribution from the super - kamiokande experiment consist of uncertainty in @xmath8 ( see figure  4 and eq.(3 ) in the preceeding paper@xcite ) and in the transformation of @xmath7 from @xmath9 ( see figure  5 in the preceeding paper@xcite ) .",
    "there are big differences between our distribution and the corresponding one from the super - kamiokande experiment .",
    "the first is the difference in the shape of the distribution and the second is in their dip structure .",
    "it seems to be curious that there exists a rather wider dip from 100 to 630  km / gev for the first maximum oscillation in the distribution from the super - kamiokande experiment , which is against the sense of maximum oscillation , while we give a sharp dip for the first maximum oscillation around 520  km / gev predicted by the neutrino oscillation parameters from the super - kamiokande collabolation . in order to clarify the reason for the remarkable difference between ours and that of the super - kamiokande experiment , it is required that the super - kamiokande collaboration disclose their correlation diagram between @xmath4 and @xmath7 as shown in figure 12 in the preceeding paper@xcite",
    "the super - kamiokande collabolation trys to get the evidence for an oscillatory signature in atmospheric neutrino oscillations by detecting the maximum oscillations ( the first maximum oscillation ) .",
    "then , they approximate @xmath4 by @xmath8 and estimate @xmath7 from @xmath9 in their @xmath14 analysis . however , we show that the approximation of @xmath4 by @xmath8 doest not hold at all ( figures  3 and 4 in the present paper ) and the estimation method by the super - kamiokande collabolation in energy is theoretically unsuitable ( figure  5 in the preceeding paper@xcite ) .",
    "then , it is clarified that the role of @xmath4 is more decisively cruisial than that of @xmath7 in the @xmath14 analysis . as a result of it , one",
    "can not replace @xmath0 by @xmath2 .    in the @xmath14 analysis",
    ", we examine all possible combinations of @xmath14 , namely , @xmath0@xcite , @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 in the present paper . among all possible @xmath14 analysis",
    ", we find only the @xmath0 distribution can give the maximum oscillations from the survival probability of a given flavor ( eq .  1 ) ) , as it must be .",
    "however , the @xmath0 distribution can not be physically observed . even if we put aside the unsuitable estimation of @xmath7 from @xmath9 by the super - kamiokande collabolation(eq .  4 in the preceeding paper@xcite ) , it is concluded from our analysis by the numerical computer experiment that @xmath2 distribution by the super - kamiokande collabolation",
    "can not obtain the maximum oscillation from the survival probability of a given flavor . from the experimental point of view , physically measurable quantities are @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "therefore , it is desirable that the super - kamiokande collaboration carry out the @xmath3 analysis from which they examine whether they can really observe the maximum oscillation for neutrino oscillation or not . in this case",
    ", we are free from the uncertainty which is produced by the estimation of @xmath7 from @xmath9 .",
    "however , even if the super - kamiokande collabolation utilizes @xmath9 instead of @xmath7 , we can not observe the maximum oscillation in the @xmath3 analysis , which are shown in figure  8 .",
    "+ furthermore , it should be emphasized that confirmation of the existence of the maximum oscillations can be carried out by the analysis on the ratio of @xmath15 , but not by that of the @xmath16 only . for the purpose",
    ", we should say the numerical computer experiment is an indispensable mean . in conclusion",
    ", we would say that we can not observe any maximum oscillations with the super - kamiokande experiment @xmath14 analysis against the original claim by the super - kamiokande collabolation .",
