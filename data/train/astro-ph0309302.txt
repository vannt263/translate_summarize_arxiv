    "immediately following the announcement of the first microlensing detections @xcite , three groups independently showed that one could measure the microlens angular einstein radius , @xmath4 from the deviations on the microlensing lightcurve induced by the finite size of the source @xcite . here",
    "@xmath5 is the mass of the lens and @xmath6 is the lens - source relative parallax .",
    "although all three considered the case of a point - mass lens passing close to or over the face of the source star , the great majority of the actual @xmath7 measurements made over the ensuing decade used binary - lens events in which the source passed over the binary caustic @xcite . there has been only one single - lens event for which finite - source effects have yielded a measurement of @xmath7 .",
    "this was the spectacular event macho-95 - 30 , whose m4  iii source of radius @xmath8 was transited by the lens @xcite .",
    "in fact , of the more than 1000 single - lens microlensing events discovered to date , only two have a measured @xmath7 by any technique .",
    "the other was the equally spectacular macho - lmc-5 whose source - lens relative proper motion @xmath9 was measured by directly imaging and resolving the source and the m - dwarf lens six years after the event @xcite .",
    "the angular einstein radius was then inferred from , @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the einstein crossing time , which had been measured during the event .",
    "measurements of @xmath7 are important because they constrain the physical properties of the lens . for most events ,",
    "the only measured parameter that is related to the physical properties of the lens is @xmath11 , which ( from eqs .",
    "[ [ eqn : thetaedef ] ] and [ [ eqn : tedef ] ] ) is a combination of three such properties , @xmath5 , @xmath6 , and @xmath9 .",
    "if @xmath7 is measured , one then determines @xmath9 from equation  ( [ eqn : tedef ] ) , and the only remaining ambiguity is between @xmath5 and @xmath6 ( see eq .  [ [ eqn : thetaedef ] ] ) . in some cases",
    ", @xmath9 is directly of interest .",
    "for example , measurement of the proper motion of the binary event macho-98-smc-1 led to the conclusion that the lens was in the smc itself rather than the galactic halo @xcite .    in other cases",
    ", one can combine the measurement of @xmath7 with other measurements or limits to further constrain the character of the lens .",
    "the most dramatic example of this would be measurement of the microlens parallax , @xmath12 which can be determined either by observing the event from a satellite in solar orbit @xcite or from the distortion of the microlens lightcurve induced by the accelerated motion of the earth @xcite .",
    "if both @xmath7 and @xmath13 are measured , one completely solves the event .",
    "that is , @xmath14 unfortunately , while @xmath13 has been measured for about a dozen events , only one of these also has a firm measurement of @xmath7 @xcite , although @xcite also obtained tentative measurements of both @xmath7 and @xmath13 .",
    "another type of constraint that can be combined with a measurement of @xmath7 is an upper limit on the lens flux , which can often be obtained from the lightcurve .",
    "this flux limit can be converted into a luminosity limit at each possible lens distance .",
    "if the lens is assumed to be a main - sequence star , then using equation ( [ eqn : thetaedef ] ) and some reasonable assumption about the source distance , one can put an upper limit on the lens mass ( e.g. , @xcite ) . even in the absence of any additional constraints ,",
    "equation  ( [ eqn : thetaedef ] ) can be combined with a galactic model to make statistical statements about the lens properties ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the principal reason that most @xmath7 measurements come from binary lenses and that single - lens measurements are extremely rare is that the ratio @xmath15 , of the angular source radius , @xmath16 , to the einstein radius , @xmath17 is usually extremely small . at the distance of the galactic bulge",
    ", even a clump giant has an angular radius @xmath18 , and main - sequence stars are an order of magnitude smaller .",
    "by contrast , typical einstein radii are @xmath19^{1/2}$ ] .",
    "hence , the probability that the lens will pass directly over the source , which is what is required for substantial finite source effects @xcite , is very small .",
    "by contrast , binary lenses , with their extended caustic structures , have a much higher probability of generating finite - source effects .",
    "however , new microlensing surveys are beginning to alter this situation .",
    "in particular , the new phase of the optical gravitational lens experiment , ogle - iii @xcite , with its dedicated 1.3  m telescope and new @xmath20 field , @xmath21 pixel , mosaic ccd camera and generally excellent image quality is generating microlensing alerts at the rate of 500/season ( as reported by the ogle - iii early warning system , ews , http://www.astrouw.edu.pl/@xmath22ogle/ogle3/ews/ews.html ) , roughly an order of magnitude higher than previous surveys .",
    "this high event rate is itself enough to overcome the low , @xmath23 , probability of a source - crossing event , and so to generate a few finite - source affected ews alerts per year .",
    "moreover , because ews relies on image - subtraction @xcite , it is sensitive to extremely high magnification events of relatively faint sources , which have a higher chance of a source crossing than do typical events .",
    "ogle - iii is able to generate this high event rate only by reducing its visits to individual fields below 1/night .",
    "hence , it would not customarily observe the alerted event during the lens transit of the source . however , several groups , including the probing lensing anomalies network ( planet , @xcite ) , the microlensing planet search ( mps , @xcite ) , and the microlensing follow - up network ( @xmath24fun , http://www.astronomy.ohio-state.edu/@xmath22microfun/ ) intensively monitor alerts from ews and also from the microlensing observations in astrophysics collaboration ( moa , @xcite ) , primarily to search for planets .",
    "high - magnification events are the most sensitive to planetary perturbations @xcite , so these groups tend to focus on these events , particularly their peaks . as a consequence , there is a good chance they will detect finite - source effects when they occur .",
    "moreover , ogle - iii diverts time from its regular field rotation ( survey mode ) to especially interesting events ( follow - up mode ) and so can itself also directly detect these effects .    here",
    "we report observations of ews alert ogle-2003-blg-262 , which exhibited clear indications of finite - source effects near its peak on 2003 july 19 . by fitting this event to a single - lens finite - source model",
    ", we measure the @xmath7 and so @xmath9 . we use this information , combined with a measurement of @xmath11 to constrain the mass of the lens .",
    "we also present marginal ( @xmath25 ) evidence for an asymmetry which , if due to parallax effects , would imply that the lens was a brown dwarf . however , we argue that the observed asymmetry is either due to statistical fluctuations , a weak binary lens , or acceleration of the source . our analysis provides a framework in which to analyze future finite - source single - lens event , which should be considerably more common due to the higher rate of alerted events",
    "the microlensing event ogle-2003-blg-262 was identified by the ogle - iii ews @xcite on 2003 june 26 , i.e. , more than three weeks before peak , which occurred on hjd@xmath26 hjd@xmath27 over the pacific ocean .",
    "ogle - iii observations were carried out with the 1.3-m warsaw telescope at the las campanas observatory , chile , which is operated by the carnegie institution of washington .",
    "these comprise a total of 170 observations in @xmath28 band , including 68 in the 2001 and 2002 seasons .",
    "the exposures were generally the standard 120 s , except for three special 40 s exposures on the peak and following night when the star was too bright for the standard exposure time .",
    "photometry was obtained with the ogle - iii image subtraction technique data pipeline @xcite based in part on the @xcite dia implementation .",
    "the source had also been monitored by ogle - ii and was found to be very stable over four previous seasons ( april  1997  october  2000 ) .    following the alert ,",
    "the event was monitored by @xmath24fun from sites in chile and israel .",
    "the chile observations were carried out at the 1.3 m ( ex-2mass ) telescope at cerro tololo interamerican observatory , using the andicam , which simultaneously images at optical and infrared wavelengths @xcite . during the seven nights from hjd@xmath29 2838.5 to 2844.8",
    ", there were a total of 45 observations in @xmath28 , 4 in @xmath30 , and 28 in @xmath31 .",
    "the @xmath28 and @xmath30 observations were generally 300 s , although the exposures were shortened to 120 s during the three nights from 2839.6 to 2841.8 .",
    "the individual @xmath31 observations were 60 s and were grouped in 5 dithered exposures , which were taken simultaneously with one 300 s @xmath30 or @xmath28 exposure or with two 120 s @xmath28 exposures .",
    "all images were flat fielded using sky flats for @xmath30 and @xmath28 , and dome flats for @xmath31 .",
    "photometry was obtained with dophot @xcite for all @xmath30 , @xmath28 , and @xmath31 images .",
    "after reductions , the contiguous groups of 5 ( or 10 in the case of back - to - back @xmath30 and @xmath28 exposures ) @xmath31 points were averaged into single data points to yield the above - stated 28 points .",
    "the @xmath24fun israel observations were carried out on the wise 1 m telescope at mitzpe ramon , 200 km south of tel - aviv , roughly @xmath32 east of chile . during the nights of @xmath33 , @xmath34 , and @xmath35 , there were a total of four observations in @xmath28 and three in @xmath30 .",
    "the exposures ( all 240 s ) were obtained using the wise tektronix 1k ccd camera .",
    "data were flat - fielded and zero corrected in the usual way , and photometry obtained with dophot .",
    "the position of the source is @xmath36 , @xmath37 @xmath38 , and so was accessible for most of the nights near peak from chile , but only a few hours from israel .",
    "unfortunately , due to a communications mixup , @xmath24fun chile observations on the peak night were bunched in a narrow time interval .",
    "happily , when these are combined with the two ogle observations and the one @xmath28-band and one @xmath30-band @xmath24fun israel observations , the rising half of the peak is still clearly traced out .",
    "see figure  [ fig : lightcurve1 ] .",
    "= 3.5truein    = 3.5truein    we emphasize that while three of the datasets have relatively few points , two of these small datasets actually play crucial roles .",
    "the three post - peak @xmath24fun israel @xmath28 points serve to align this dataset with the two larger @xmath28 datasets and so enable the first point ( on 2839.38 ) to directly test the near - peak finite - source profile , which otherwise would be determined by a single compact set of points .",
    "see figure  [ fig : lightcurve1 ] .",
    "the four @xmath24fun chile @xmath30 points allow determination of the color of the source and so permit one to estimate the source size and thus the proper motion and angular einstein radius . see   [ model ] . with only three points , two of which are nearly coincident , the @xmath24fun israel @xmath30 data do not contribute significantly to the fit because they are absorbed by two fitting parameters , @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "however , they are included here for completeness .",
    "the source lies in one of the ogle - ii calibrated photometry fields @xcite ( ftp://bulge.princeton.edu/ogle/ogle2/maps/bulge/ ) and this allows us to place it on a calibrated color magnitude diagram .",
    "see figure  [ fig : cmd ] .",
    "the source lies on the red giant branch , about 1 mag brighter than the clump and about 0.2 mag redder .",
    "it therefore has considerably larger angular radius than typical microlens sources , and this , together with the high magnification of the event , considerably increased the chance for significant finite source effects .",
    "@xcite measured the proper motion of the source ( relative to the frame of the galactic bulge ) and found @xmath41 @xmath42 . when corrected to the tycho-2 frame , this becomes @xmath41 @xmath43 .",
    "in most cases , the lensed star is regarded as a point source because the angular size of the source is negligibly small compared to the angular separation of the source and the lens . the magnification is then given by @xcite , @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the projected source - lens separation in units of the angular einstein radius @xmath7 . however , this approximation breaks down for @xmath46 .",

    "that is , although the errors on the individual determinations of @xmath121 and @xmath122 are large , they are strongly correlated , such that the difference @xmath123 is much better determined .",
    "this in turn can be traced to the fact that there is a color offset @xmath124 at the peak , which is clearly visible in figure  [ fig : lightcurve1 ] and which the fitting routine ascribes to the source having much more ld in @xmath28 than @xmath31 and hence being relatively blue in the center .",

    ".    the errors shown in table  [ tab : par ] are @xmath133 where @xmath134 is the @xmath135-th element of covariant matrix , and the correlation coefficients defined as @xmath136 are , @xmath137 where parameters are @xmath88 , @xmath89 , @xmath11 , @xmath15 , @xmath112 , @xmath138 , and @xmath139 .",
    "as expected from experience with standard microlensing events , @xmath39 and @xmath40 are extremely correlated , and these are both highly correlated with @xmath89 and @xmath11 .",
    "what is new in equation ( [ corr ] ) is that @xmath15 is also highly correlated with these other four parameters .",
    "the fundamental reason for this is that all five of these parameters are symmetric in @xmath140 .",
    "by contrast @xmath141 is only weakly correlated with the other parameters .",
    "as discussed by @xcite , one can determine @xmath16 from the source s dereddened color and magnitude @xmath142_s$ ] by first transforming from @xmath143 to @xmath144 using the color - color relations of @xcite , and then applying the empirical relation between color and surface brightness to obtain @xmath16 @xcite .",
    "again following @xcite , we determine @xmath142_s$ ] from the measured offset of the unamplified source ( as determined from the microlensing fit ) relative to the centroid of the clump giants on an instrumental cmd , the latter s dereddened color and magnitude being regarded as `` known '' .",
    "we measure this offset to be @xmath145 in general , the source may be blended , so that the @xmath30 and @xmath28 of the source derived from the microlensing fit will not necessarily agree with those of the object identified as the `` source '' in an image taken at baseline .",
    "hence , one can not in general derive the offset from a cmd constructed from such a baseline image .",
    "however , in this case , there is essentially no blending , so the offset in the baseline calibrated cmd shown in figure  [ fig : cmd ] is virtually identical ( within 0.02 mag ) to that given in equation  ( [ eqn : delclump ] ) .",
    "the `` known '' values of @xmath142_{{\\rm clump}}$ ] have recently come under dispute .",
    "the basic problem is that the previous calibrations of these quantities relied on a number of steps , in each of which it was assumed that the ratio of total to selective extinction was @xmath146 .",
    "however , using this same value , @xcite and @xcite found respectively that the colors of bulge clump giants and rr lyrae stars were anomalous relative to local populations .",
    "@xcite then proposed that these anomalies could be resolved if the dust toward this line of sight were itself anomalous , with @xmath147 .",
    "@xcite then demonstrated that this was very likely the case based on ogle - ii data .",
    "while it would be both worthwhile and feasible to retrace all the steps that led to the old calibration in light of this revised @xmath148 , the magnitude of this project lies well beyond the scope of the present work .",
    "pending such a revision , we adopt a simpler approach .",
    "the distance to the galactic center has now been measured geometrically by @xcite to be @xmath149 kpc based on the `` visual - binary '' method of @xcite .",
    "bulge stars are of similar metallicity to local stars , so the clump should be of similar color to the _ hipparcos _ clump stars @xmath150 .",
    "( recall that it was the apparent failure of this expectation that led to the discovery of anomalous extinction . )",
    "the @xmath28-band luminosity of clump stars does not depend strongly on age ( until the stars are so young that the turnoff luminosity approaches that of the horizontal branch ) .",
    "hence , the bulge clump stars should have approximately the same @xmath151 as the _ hipparcos _ sample . for this",
    "we adopt @xmath152 , the value found by @xcite for their 70 pc sample ( and prior to their reddening correction which we consider to be substantially too large . ) hence , in lieu of a more thoroughgoing calibration , we adopt @xmath153_{{\\rm clump } } = ( 1.00,14.32 ) .",
    "\\label{eqn : viclump}\\ ] ] combining equations  ( [ eqn : delclump ] ) and ( [ eqn : viclump ] ) and applying the @xcite relation , we find @xmath154 where the error comes primarily from the 8.7% intrinsic scatter in the @xcite relation .",
    "= 3.5truein    this evaluation would appear to depend on the assumption that the source suffers exactly as much extinction as a typical clump star , which it might not , either due to highly variable extinction or to the source lying well in the foreground and so in front of a large fraction of the dust .",
    "in fact , if it were determined that the extinction toward the source were greater than to the clump by @xmath155 or less by @xmath156 , the estimate of @xmath16 would change less than 3% .",
    "this is because the changes in the inferred surface brightness and luminosity lead to changes in the source - size estimate that go in opposite directions .    combining equations  ( [ eqn : rhoteeval ] ) and ( [ eqn : thetastar ] )",
    ", we obtain , @xmath157 we now use this measurement of @xmath7 , in conjunction with its definition , equation  ( [ eqn : thetaedef ] ) , to write the source - lens relative parallax as a function of the lens mass , @xmath158 given a galactic mass model along the line of sight , @xmath159 , the prior probability of a given relative parallax is proportional to @xmath160\\biggr ) , \\label{eqn : pofpirel}\\ ] ] where @xmath161 and @xmath162 are the lens and source distances .",
    "we adopt the @xcite model , and in figure  [ fig : massdist ] we plot @xmath163 $ ] versus @xmath164 to display the constraint placed on the mass by the measurement of @xmath7 .",
    "the full - width half - maximum range is , @xmath165 in the absence of such a measurement , the only constraint comes from the measurement of @xmath11 , and this is extremely weak , having a full width half maximum of a factor @xmath166",
    ". see figure 1 from @xcite .",
    "indeed , as shown in that figure , the mere supposition that the lens is a star places stronger constraints on the lens mass than does the measurement of @xmath11 .    the measurements of @xmath7 and @xmath11 yield @xmath9 ( eq .  [ [ eqn : tedef ] ] ) .",
    "since the distribution of @xmath9 varies with @xmath161 and @xmath162 , one could in principle use its determination ( eq .  [",
    "[ eqn : muteeval ] ] ) to place further constraints on combinations of these parameters and so ( through eq .",
    "[ [ eqn : pirelofm ] ] ) on the mass . in practice , for bulge sources , the distribution of @xmath9 hardly varies as a function of lens position , even when one considers bulge versus disk lenses .",
    "moreover , the actual measured value of @xmath9 is near the peak of that distribution .",
    "hence , we do not incorporate this constraint .",
    "the @xmath9 measurement does effectively rule out a foreground disk source .",
    "( without this constraint , i.e. from the cmd alone , the source could plausibly be a disk clump giant at @xmath167 ) .",
    "however , for disk - disk events along this line of sight , the observer , lens , and source all share the same transverse motion due to the flat rotation curve of the galaxy .",
    "hence , only their peculiar motions relative to this rotation enter @xmath9 , and these are only of order 10 s of @xmath168 .",
    "hence , @xmath9 would be only a few @xmath169 , much slower than the measured value .",
    "the @xcite proper - motion measurement of the source independently rules out a foreground disk lens , since the source is moving roughly opposite to the direction of galactic rotation at about @xmath170 , where @xmath171 and @xmath172 .",
    "in fact , this measurement by itself would be consistent with the source lying in the background disk , behind the bulge .",
    "however , such a scenario is virtually ruled out by the cmd ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : cmd ] ) , which shows the source lying in or slightly above the bulge giant branch .",
    "if the source lay at , say , 10  kpc , it would intrinsically be @xmath220.5 magnitude brighter still .",
    "combining our measurement @xmath173 , with the @xcite measurement @xmath174 @xmath175 , we can effectively rule out a disk lens .",
    "these measurements imply @xmath176 , whereas a disk lens would be expected to have roughly zero proper motion .",
    "the measurement of the unlensed background flux , @xmath40 , gives an upper limit to the flux from the lens .",
    "the measured background flux is a function of observatory and filter , and tends to grow with larger mean seeing .",
    "hence , the best constraint is expected to come from the observatory with the best seeing . in our case , this is ogle .",
    "the ogle @xmath40 is also by far the best constrained , in part because of the large number of baseline points .",
    "the ogle background - to - source flux ratio is @xmath178 , which yields a @xmath128 lower limit on the magnitude difference of the lens and source , @xmath179 . for this limit to be at all relevant",
    ", the lens must be close to the turnoff or brighter , implying that it is close to a solar mass .",
    "then , from equation  ( [ eqn : pirelofm ] ) , the source and lens must be nearly the same distance .",
    "this implies in turn that the above limit on apparent - magnitude difference translates directly into a limit on absolute - magnitude difference .",
    "since the source is about 1 mag brighter than the clump , the constraint yields only @xmath180 , which is of very limited value .",
    "the detection of microlens parallax is marginal .",
    "we therefore begin by investigating whether its tentatively detected value is consistent with what else is known about the lens . given this orientation , and for simplicity of exposition",
    ", we ignore the very large error in the measurement",
    ". only one component of the parallax is measured .",
    "we therefore actually have a limit , not a measurement , of @xmath182 . together with equations  ( [ eqn : mandpirel ] ) and ( [ eqn : muteeval ] ) , this implies @xmath183 and @xmath184",
    ". the source distance can not be much more than @xmath185 , partly because of the low density of stars at greater distances and partly because it would lie in an unpopulated portion of the cmd .",
    "hence , @xmath186 , i.e. @xmath187 .",
    "that is , the lens would be a disk brown dwarf .",
    "apart from the small peculiar velocity of each , the lens and earth are both rotating about the galactic center at the same speed .",
    "hence , the lens should be seen moving against the bulge at about @xmath188 towards cygnus , which is to say at a position angle roughly @xmath189 east of north .",
    "because the dispersion of bulge stars is about @xmath190 , this should also be approximately the direction of lens motion relative to the source .",
    "since only one component of @xmath191 is measured , all we can test is the sign of this prediction . from the post - peak residuals to the fit without parallax ( fig .",
    "[ fig : lightcurve2 ] ) , the earth is accelerating in the direction of the lens motion ( thus slowing down the end of the event ) . on july 19 ( roughly one month after opposition ) , this is basically opposite the direction of the earth s motion , and so is basically toward the west .",
    "since the field is south of the ecliptic , there is also a small component of this ( projected ) acceleration toward the south .",
    "hence , the position angle of the projected acceleration vector is about @xmath192 , which is misaligned with the expected direction of the lens motion by about @xmath193 .",
    "that is , the expected sign of @xmath112 is opposite to what is expected .    while it remains possible that the peculiar velocities of the lens and source conspire to produce this result , the statistical significance of the parallax measurement is not high enough to warrant its acceptance in the face of this strong contrary expectation",
    ".    moreover , there are at least two other possible explanations for this asymmetry apart from statistical fluctuations .",
    "the first is xallarap , distortions in the light curve due to accelerated motion of the source rather than the lens .",
    "indeed , @xcite showed that any parallax effect could be mimicked by the orbital motion of the source around an unseen companion .",
    "when both components of @xmath191 are well measured , this possibility can be largely discounted because the probability of the source being in a binary with the same inclination , phase , and period as the earth s orbit is extremely small . however , in the present case , in which all that is detected is a single component of acceleration , there is a very wide class of source binaries that could mimic the observed parallax signal . moreover , by the arguments given in ",
    "[ sec : lenslum ] , any source companion on the main - sequence would be undetectable in the lightcurve ( other than through its effect accelerating the source ) . the xallarap hypothesis could be checked by radial - velocity measurements .",
    "still another possible source of the asymmetry is a very weak binary lens .",
    "@xcite detected a similarly weak asymmetry in ogle-1999-blg-36 and were able to model this either with parallax or with a low - mass companion to the lens .",
    "thus , asymmetric residuals can be attributed to several effects including parallax , xallarap , and binary lenses .",
