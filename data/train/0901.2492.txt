    "fig . 1 illustrates the basic components of the standard model of particle physics [ 1 , 2 ] : quarks and leptons are the basic components of matter : they are fermions with spin 1@xmath02 and may be classified in 3 families : the quarks u , d and the leptons @xmath1 , e@xmath2 belong to the first family ; c , s , @xmath3 , @xmath4 to the second family ; t , b , @xmath5 , @xmath6 to the third family ( one can say that they have different @xmath7 ) . only e@xmath2 , d , u are part of ordinary matter ; all others are unstable and are produced in high - energy collisions .",
    "2 shows the mass values of all basic fermions : note that they cover a mass range of @xmath813 orders of magnitude . in the original formulation of the sm",
    "the neutrinos were massless and left handed .",
    "we now know that they have very small masses and that they are subject to neutrino oscillations .",
    "other fundamental objects of the sm are the force carriers , which are bosons of spin 1 .",
    "they are ; the massless photon , responsible of the electromagnetic interaction ( qed ) , the 8 massless gluons for the strong interaction ( qcd ) and the heavy z@xmath9 , w@xmath10 , w@xmath2 , the carriers of the weak interaction .",
    "the total number of basic constituents and carriers is large : 6 quarks , which according to qcd , come in three @xmath11 ( 18 ) , 6 leptons , 12 force carriers ( in total 35 particles and one has to consider also the corresponding antiquarks and antileptons ( 18 ) ) .",
    "the formal theory of the sm is based on the gauge symmetry , which requires zero masses . in order to explain the observed masses one must introduce at least one scalar higgs boson , which is needed for the spontaneous breaking of the symmetry and the generation of masses .",
    "the coupling of the higgs boson is predicted by the sm , but not its mass [ 1- 4 ] .",
    "one can only say that its mass should presumable be larger than 130 gev and smaller than 1tev .",
    "thus the higgs will be the first particle to be searched for at the new large hadron collider at cern , which will produce high - energy @xmath12 collisions at c.m .",
    "energies up to 14 tev .    in the following will be discussed the present status of the sm , future studies at lhc , indications of physics beyond the sm , neutrino oscillations in the @xmath13m@xmath14 region indicated by the atmospheric neutrino experiments , long baseline neutrino experiments .",
    "the sm of particle physics was checked to an unprecedent level of accuracy by the precision measurements made at lep , slc , hera and the fermilab colliders : fig .",
    "3 gives the present status of the precision measurements .",
    "the sm has some theoretical inconsistencies and too many parameters ; it could be a low energy approximation of a more complete theory .",
    "thus many physicists are looking for physics beyond the sm , for instance supersymmetry , compositeness , etc .",
    "new particle searches thus remain an important subject of research . connected with these problems",
    "there is also a strong interest in finding the deep structure of the proton at ever smaller distances .",
    "neutrino oscillations give indications on the presence of physics beyond the sm , even if part of the properties of neutrino oscillations may be included in the sm .",
    "the z@xmath9 decays predominantly into @xmath15 pairs , which yields a clean sample of events to test qcd , the theory of the strong interaction .",
    "the @xmath15 pair is not observed directly , but it gives rise to two opposite jets of hadrons . before `` fragmentation '' one of the quarks may radiate a gluon by a process similar to bremsstrahlung yielding 3 jets of hadrons .",
    "the ratio of the number of 3-jets to the number of 2-jet events is one way of measuring @xmath16 , the @xmath17 @xmath18 @xmath19 .",
    "this is a foundamental parameter , which was precisely measured with a variety of experiments .",
    "they established the @xmath20 @xmath21 of @xmath16 , the running of @xmath16 , that is its decrease with increassing energy : @xmath16(m@xmath22)=0.1176@xmath230.009 ( also this is now a precision measurement [ 3 , 4 ] ) ; also the electromagnetic coupling is not constant ; it increases from zero energy ( @xmath24 @xmath81@xmath0137 ) to lep energies ( @xmath24 @xmath81@xmath0128 ) [ 5 , 6 ] .",
    "a large variety of phenomenological studies were made on qcd , including the complexity of the hadron spectrum , confinement , phase transitions , etc .",
    "[ 3 , 7 , 8 ] .",
    "in the past the reference relativistic quantum field theory was qed , but now many physicists consider qcd a better defined theory than qed .",
    "4 shows the cern complex of accelerators : an electrostatic proton accelerator , a linear accelerator , a booster proton synchrotron , the 28 gev proton synchrotron ( ps ) , the 400 gev super proton synchroton ( sps ) and finally the large hadron collider ( lhc ) which should yield proton - proton collisions up to center of mass ( cm ) energies of 14 tev .",
    "the first accelerators are relative old ( and need maintenance ) while lhc is a brand new accelerator with helium cooled superconducting magnets .",
    "5 shows the sps supercycle used in september 2008 : the first cycle accelerates protons up to 250 gev which produce secondary beams in the sps experimental areas ; there are then three cycles of protons at 400 gev , fast extracted to yield neutrinos for the cern to gran sasso beam ( cngs ) , the last cycle yields 400 gev protons to the two colliding proton beams of lhc .    the lhc ring is located in an underground tunnel at a depth of @xmath8100 m [ 9 ] . in different colliding points are placed the two general purpose detectors atlas and cms ( see fig .",

    "it may be worth recalling that the main lhc experiments use 4@xmath26 general purpose detectors , with many subdetectors , most of which immersed in a strong magnetic field .",
    "they have several hundred thousand electronic channels and very many microprocessors and computers .",
    "the detectors have a cylindrical symmetry , with a `` barrel '' and `` endcaps '' structure ; some are further structured in different subdetectors . starting with the innermost detectors and proceeding outward",
    "one finds : a microvertex detector , a central tracking detector with de@xmath0dx and time - of - flight capabilities ; the momentum of produced charge particles is measured by track curvature in the magnetic field .",
    "then follow the electromagnetic and hadron calorimeters , and , after the iron of the magnetic field return yoke , the muon detector .",
    "the collider luminosity is measured at each location using forward detectors and eventually precision `` luminometers '' ( see for ex .",
    "[ 10 , 11 ] ) .    the experiments at lep , slc , fermilab and hera , required tens of groups and hundreds of physicists and engineers , with interconnections at the national and regional levels .",
    "the experiments at the lhc require each hundreds of groups and thousands of physicists , with interconnections in a sort of world organization or transition to a new vacuum .",
    "the conclusions from several analysis teams are that these possibilities are extremely improbable .",
    "moreover the exposure to the highest energy cosmic ray protons during the life of the solar system ( equivalent to @xmath8millions of years of lhc runs ) did not show any problem .",

    "<S> the standard model ( sm ) of particle physics was tested to great precision by experiments at the highest energy colliders ( lep , hera , tevatron , slac ) . </S>",
    "<S> the only missing particle is the higgs boson , which will be the first particle to be searched for at the new large hadron collider ( lhc ) at cern . </S>",
    "<S> the sm anticipated that there are 3 types of left handed neutrinos . </S>",
    "<S> experiments on atmospheric and solar neutrinos ( made in japan , italy , canada , russia and the us ) have shown the existence of neutrino oscillations , which imply that neutrinos have very small mass differences and violate the conservation of individual leptonic numbers . </S>",
    "<S> neutrino oscillations were verified in long baseline neutrino experiments ( in japan and in the usa ) ; and cosmology has given reasonably precise indications on the sum of the neutrino masses . in this paper will be summarized some of the main properties of the sm and some of the main results obtained in the field and the experiments in preparation . some of the main open questions will be briefly discussed . </S>"
