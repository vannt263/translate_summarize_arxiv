    "a major outstanding goal in cosmology is to piece together the history of the universe between cosmic dawn , the emergence of the first stars and galaxies , and the end of reionization , when the radiation from these objects had ionized the intergalactic medium ( igm ) .",
    "advances in numerical techniques , combined with exquisite measurements of the `` initial '' conditions ( at a redshift @xmath6 ; @xcite , @xcite ) , have led to remarkable simulations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) of the conditions leading up to the former milestone , occurring at @xmath7 , when the universe was @xmath8 old",
    ". however , reconstructing the subsequent several hundred myr of cosmic history has proved far more challenging , due to the difficulties in reliably modeling the numerous forms of feedback from the first astrophysical objects ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    in particular , x - rays from the first galaxies can act as a powerful source of feedback ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) that exerts influence over a wide range of distance scales .",
    "because hard x - rays ( energies @xmath9 ) have mean free paths comparable to the hubble horizon , they can isotropically heat and partially reionize the early igm ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "in fact , they are expected to be the dominant agent in heating the igm .",
    "such heating may suppress star formation @xcite and massive black hole ( bh ) growth @xcite inside low - mass dark matter haloes by raising the jeans and filtering masses of the igm @xcite . on galactic and circum - galactic scales , soft x - rays ( @xmath10 )",
    "can affect the formation of stars and possibly massive black holes ( bhs ) by promoting the formation of molecular hydrogen via electron - catalyzed reactions ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in addition to their suspected roles in early galaxy evolution , x - rays are important also because they can leave an observable signature that can be exploited to probe the cosmological epoch in question @xcite . their thermal impact on the early universe should be measurable through the redshifted @xmath11 transition line of neutral hydrogen , which is observed in emission or absorption depending on the relative temperature of the igm with respect to that of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) .",
    "several studies have investigated how forthcoming observations of the sky - average amplitude and power spectrum of the relic @xmath11 line ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) could be used to constrain the astrophysical agent ( or agents ) responsible for heating the early igm",
    ".    there are sound reasons to expect that the first galaxies produced x - rays in abundance , and rapidly heated the igm .",
    "there are two dominant x - ray sources in present - day galaxies  both powered by gas accretion onto bhs , and both plausibly prominent shortly after cosmic dawn : gas feeding massive bhs shining as active galactic nuclei ( agn ) , and x - ray binaries , powered by a stellar - mass bh gradually cannibalizing a companion star .",
    "estimates of the mass accumulated by nuclear bhs prior to @xmath12 @xcite , the existence of very massive bhs at @xmath13 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , as well as the observed ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and theoretically expected @xcite increase in their duty cycles toward higher redshifts , all hint that x - ray agn may have been much more common during this epoch . likewise , high - mass x - ray binaries ( hmxbs ) dominate the x - ray emission of star - forming galaxies ; the low metallicity and rapid baryonic mass accretion of the earliest galaxies both lend credence to the notion that they were rife with hmxbs .",
    "theoretical models suggest that either type of x - ray source could heat the igm to above the cmb temperature as early as @xmath14 , and that this transition should be measurable by the planned @xmath11 experiments .    at present , there are too many theoretical uncertainties to determine from the future data which type of x - ray source  agn or hmxbs  was responsible for driving the thermal evolution of the @xmath15 igm .",
    "modeling the early agn x - ray emission is particularly difficult , because the conditions for triggering agn activity are not fully understood even at low redshifts ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "because of the uncertainty in the fraction of x - ray photons that is released into the igm as opposed to being trapped inside the accretion flow or reprocessed into the infrared ( e.g. * ? ?",
    "? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; and because the epoch , initial masses , and birthplaces of the massive bh `` seeds '' are not yet constrained by observations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "similarly , studies usually estimate the x - ray contribution from early hmxbs by simply inferring empirical relations between x - ray luminosity and star formation rate ( sfr ) in local galaxies ( and modeling the sfr using a semi - analytic cosmological model ) , or combining such relations with one or more free parameters ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the goal of this study is to alleviate the uncertainties in the formation rate and x - ray output of hmxbs in the early universe , by using @xmath1-body simulations of nascent groups of the first ( population iii , henceforth pop  iii ) stars .",
    "we choose the properties of the star groups in our simulations to reflect those found in hydrodynamical simulations of pop  iii star formation at @xmath16 ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "we follow the formation and dynamical evolution of compact binaries over thousands to millions of years , including the effects of the background gravitational potential and dynamical friction .",
    "this allows us to compute the fraction of pop  iii stars that form stable , compact binaries , and eventually undergo an x - ray bright phase .",
    "the end result is an estimate of the formation rate of hmxbs in the first protogalaxies , as well as the amount of x - rays they generate per unit star formation . to our knowledge , this is the first published estimate of this type .",
    "our simulations predict a binary formation rate which is similar to what is observationally inferred in present - day galaxies . however , we derive a hmxb energy output ( normalized to the star formation rate ) that is a factor @xmath17 higher than in present - day star - forming galaxies , if the hmxb duty cycle is similar to the one in the local universe .",
    "we find that the x - ray output does not change significantly within the wide variety of simulation setups considered  such as different orientations for collisions between star groups , and ambient gas density  and submit that this is a robust estimate .    the findings of this study can be used as model inputs in estimating the @xmath11 global signature and power spectrum , but have wider applications . as stated above ,",
    "the x - ray output of the first galaxies are also of interest for studying feedback on smaller scales , such as subsequent star formation and massive bh formation .",
    "our work is also relevant for predicting the rates of long - duration gamma - ray bursts ( lgrbs ) from pop  iii stars .",
    "lgrbs are important probes that can shed light on the universe out to @xmath18 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "according to the collapsar model @xcite , progenitors of lgrbs require rapid rotation of the he core and removal of the h envelope .",
    "both criteria are satisfied by pop  iii hmxbs , and it is plausible that massive pop  iii stars in binary systems are dominant lgrb progenitors in the early universe @xcite . our results on hmxb formation rates can therefore be used to predict and interpret observations of high - redshift lgrbs .    the paper is organized as follows .",
    "we start in  [ sec : dynamics ] by discussing the problem to be solved  beginning with the equations of motion , followed by the description of our @xmath1-body code , our choices for the initial conditions , and how the data is interpreted for hmxb formation .",
    "we present our results in  [ sec : results ] . in  [ sec : discussion ] , we discuss the implication of our work for the x - ray output of the first galaxies , as well as for other topics such as lgrbs and smbh formation . we conclude with a summary of our findings in  [ sec : summary ] .",
    "here , we provide an overview of our simulations  namely : the equations of motion that are solved to simulate the dynamical evolution of the star groups ; the numerical scheme we use to solve the equations ; the different types of initial conditions we adopted , as well as the reasoning behind our choices ; and finally , how the results are interpreted for hmxb formation .",

    "we numerically integrate the equations of motion @xmath20    the first term on the right - hand side of equation ( [ eq : eom ] ) is the specific force due to newtonian gravity , @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the gravitational constant , @xmath23 is the displacement of the @xmath24 star from the center of the host dark matter halo , and @xmath25 .",

    "the characteristic dynamical friction timescale , for a circular keplerian orbit of two bodies with for @xmath44 and @xmath45 , is    @xmath46    where @xmath47 is the frictional dissipation power ( @xmath48 ) , and @xmath49 the orbital energy ( @xmath50 ) .",
    "the third and last term , @xmath51 , is the specific force due to the background potential , which is dominated by gas .",
    "the background potential provides an additional inward force whose functional form depends on the density profile . for simplicity , here we use a constant density and explore different values in our simulations .",
    "the force due to the background potential is then @xmath52 where here @xmath23 is the vector pointing from the center of the halo to the @xmath53-th star .",
    "the equation of motion is solved iteratively , with the positions , velocities and accelerations of each star updated at every time step .",
    "we describe our computational method below .",
    "we perform 3-dimensional , @xmath1-body simulations with 4th - order & 5-stage runge - kutta - fehlberg methods ( rkf45 method , @xcite ) using adaptive time steps .",
    "the rkf45 is a very precise and stable integration method among the large class of runge - kutta schemes , particularly by adapting the butcher tableau for fehlberg s 4(5 ) method .",
    "we solve equation ( [ eq : eom ] ) , as described in the preceding text , updating the position and velocity components of the stars while treating the background density of the gas as a uniform and static distribution .    to ensure numerical precision ,",
    "our computational scheme varies the value of each subsequent time step analytically , so that numerical errors for each variable in the simulation do not exceed @xmath54 times the size of the variable . in some cases",
    ", however , this method leads to excessive computational effort for calculating relatively trivial interactions .",
    "for example , near the pericenter of hyperbolic or highly elliptical encounters , the time steps become increasingly small in a runaway fashion to compensate for the steep rise in acceleration and associated errors . in order to avoid such situations",
    ", we implement the following two numerical shortcuts to keep computation times tractable .",
    "the first shortcut is to use analytic approximations for very close 2-body encounters .",
    "this is justified in cases where pairs of stars are sufficiently close to each other and isolated from the other stars in the simulation , so that ( i ) the gravitational pull from the other stars and the background potential are negligible compared to the mutual gravitational pull of the pair , and ( ii ) the orbital motion is supersonic and the dynamical friction force can be treated as a linear perturbation to the 2-body keplerian problem .",
    "the code employs analytic approximations for any close stellar pairs that satisfy these conditions , and reverts to the rkf algorithm when the conditions stop being satisfied .",
    "we derived the following approximations for the semi - major axis and the eccentricity : @xmath55^{-2/3},\\ ] ] @xmath56    above , @xmath57 is the reduced mass , @xmath58 and @xmath59 are respectively the semi - major axis and the eccentricity at @xmath60 , @xmath61 is a dimensionless constant , and @xmath62 is a function of the mass ratio that is symmetric about @xmath63 .",
    "note that the variable @xmath64 with subscript indicates the specific force , while without subscript it represents the semi - major axis . to derive the analytical expression for the time - evolution of the orbital distance in equation ( [ eq15 ] ) , we integrated the equation of the motion of a star under the influence of a dynamical friction torque .",
    "equation ( [ eq16 ] ) then follows from the definition of orbital eccentricity in terms of orbital energy and angular momentum .",
    "note that as the radial distance decreases , the eccentricity increases .",
    "here , @xmath61 and @xmath62 are free parameters and we use @xmath65 and @xmath66 .",
    "the stellar coordinates and velocities are recovered as functions of @xmath64 and @xmath67 using standard expressions for keplerian orbits @xcite .",
    "because we are dealing with systems with more than three bodies of different masses , stars frequently form hierarchical triple systems whose motions are affected by the kozai mechanism @xcite . since our analytic solutions above do not account for such changes in mutual inclination , we limit the use of these solutions to situations where @xmath68 , where @xmath69 is the dynamical timescale for the outer pair in the hierarchical triple , and @xmath70 is the time scale for the kozai mechanism , @xmath71 the subscript 1 above indicates the primary star of the inner compact binary along with the satellite star denoted by the subscript 3 , while the hierarchical tertiary star is indexed by the subscript 2 , and @xmath72 is the orbital period .",
    "our second shortcut for keeping the simulation runtimes manageable is to set a minimum value for the time step .",
    "we choose a physically motivated value , @xmath73 , where @xmath74 is the smallest value of the dynamical time between any two stars in the simulation ( that are not being treated by the analytic shortcut above ) at a given time step .",
    "this procedure is necessary when there are three or more stars interacting at small separations , in which case the analytic approximations above can not be used .",
    "we note that such situations are rare compared to the places where the analytic shortcut is applicable .",
    "it is assumed that a hmxb has formed if both of the following criteria are satisfied :    1 .",
    "_ one of two stars forming a binary turns into a black hole . _ in order to determine which stars turn into black holes , we need to compare the typical lifetime ( @xmath75 ) of a massive star with the time ( @xmath76 ) in the simulation ( taken to coincide with the time at which stars are born ) . if @xmath77 , the star is marked as a black hole in the simulation . for main - sequence stars , it is possible to estimate this lifetime from the mass - luminosity relation , that is @xmath78 and @xmath79 , leading to @xmath80 with @xmath81 .",
    "however , due to the uncertain value of @xmath82 for pop iii stars , we rather prefer to use here the nuclear time scale of pop iii stars estimated by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "they calculate the h - burning nuclear time scale for these stars with a stellar evolution code .",
    "we assume that a bh forms if the stellar mass is greater than @xmath83 .",
    "the two stars are close enough so that the accretion occurs through roche - lobe overflow ( rlof)_. this criterion is simply written as @xmath84 , where @xmath85 is the stellar radius , and @xmath86 is the roche - lobe radius of the most massive star calculated from the center of the star to the inner lagrange point .",
    "an approximate analytic formula to the roche - lobe radius of star 1 for a wide range of the mass ratio is @xcite , @xmath87 where @xmath88 is the orbital distance and @xmath89 is the mass ratio .",
    "although the above expression was derived in a study of binaries in circular orbits , @xcite found that the roche lobe radius does not differ very much for eccentric binaries .",
    "we therefore apply equation ( [ eq7 ] ) to all binaries found in our simulation .",
    "if a binary satisfies these two criteria , the binary is marked as a hmxb .",
    "since the two criteria are independently checked at every time step , which criterion is satisfied first is not important .",
    "we design our simulations with the @xmath90 universe in mind .",
    "this is the redshift range where the dark matter haloes reach virial temperatures @xmath91 , the expected condition for pop  iii formation , at the highest rates .",
    "the lifetimes of the stars are several myr , which is comparable to the timescales on which the host haloes undergo mergers with other pop  iii forming haloes @xcite .",
    "the initial positions of the stars are generated quasi - randomly via a monte carlo realization as follows , motivated by the assumption that they formed inside a shared keplerian gas disk at the center of the host dark matter halo .",
    "their initial radial positions in the disk plane are chosen randomly from a uniform distribution whose amplitude depends on the characteristic size scale of the star - forming cloud ( see below ) .",
    "their azimuthal distribution is chosen to be nearly uniformly distributed , so that the azimuthal angular position of the @xmath92-th star is given by @xmath93 , where @xmath1 is the total number of stars in the group .",
    "this choice is made to minimize the radial gravitational pull between the stars , so that they do not immediately fly apart .",
    "naturally , the azimuthal positions do not remain evenly spaced , but become mixed quickly .",
    "finally , we allow the stars to be displaced out of the plane of the disk .",
    "their positions perpendicular to the plane are chosen randomly , so that their vertical displacement out of the disk plane is no more than @xmath94 above or below their initial radial displacement from their shared center of mass .",
    "the initial velocities of the stars are assigned to be circular , parallel to the disk plane , and keplerian at the instant the simulation begins .    for this study , we investigated two different size scales of star forming regions .    1",
    ".   _ large scale _ : following the results from @xcite , where pop  iii protostars are formed inside star - forming regions with a size of a few thousand au , we have performed simulations where the stars are placed inside a region of size @xmath95 . + we explore two different values of uniform , constant gas density , @xmath96 ( denoted @xmath97 hereafter ) and @xmath98 ( @xmath99 ) . + for gas of primordial composition",
    ", the molecular weight @xmath100 can vary between @xmath101 and @xmath102 , depending on the ionization fraction .",
    "we adopt @xmath103 for simplicity ; this choice does not qualitatively affect our results , since our values for @xmath92 are selected arbitrarily with the goal of exploring the qualitative dependence on @xmath92 .",
    "+ each simulation is run for @xmath104 .",
    "the masses of the stars follow the initial mass function ( imf ) they provide with @xmath105 ( @xmath106 ) , @xmath107 and @xmath108 . for these simulations",
    ", we consider @xmath109 stars .",
    "small scale _ : in the simulations by @xcite , multiple protostars formed several au apart from each other .",
    "we therefore run a second set of simulations , where stars form within a 10  au radius .",
    "since @xcite do not provide a slope for the imf , we use @xmath105 as above .",
    "that study found that more than half of the mass accreted during the protostar phase goes to the most massive protostar in the group .",
    "+ to mimic this behavior , we first generate a star with @xmath110 , then generate each subsequent star with @xmath111 [ the sum of the masses of the previously generated stars ] .",
    "+ just as with the large - scale case , we run simulations with number densities @xmath97 and @xmath99 . because this case is the more relevant one for forming hmxbs , we explore several different configurations : cases with a star group of @xmath109 stars , a star group of @xmath112 stars , and collisions between two groups of @xmath109 stars .",
    "the last case is motivated by the fact that pop  iii - forming minihaloes undergo frequent mergers , which suggests that the nascent star groups themselves undergo close encounters .",
    "here , we summarize the findings of our @xmath1-body simulations , focusing in particular on the properties of the most compact binaries found for each set of runs .    [",
    "sec : results ]      we ran 20 simulations for @xmath97 and 23 for @xmath99 .    for @xmath97 , in 12 out of 20 runs , the two most massive stars ( @xmath113 and @xmath114 , where @xmath115 is the @xmath53-th most massive star ) form the most compact binary  we denote such a binary with the notation @xmath116 .",
    "similarly , binaries of type @xmath117 ( i.e. made up of the most massive star @xmath113 and the third most massive star @xmath118 ) form the most compact binary in 6 of the runs .",
    "the left panel of figure  [ fig:1 ] shows a sample set of stellar trajectories for one of the large scale @xmath119 runs . throughout the simulation ,",
    "the compact binary tends to remain near the center of the halo , as less massive stars repeatedly undergo 3-body interactions with the binary .",
    "the fact that they do not stray far from the center of the halo is a combined effect of the background potential and the gravitational potential of the massive binary .",
    "it is these 3-body encounters that cause the most compact binary in the simulations to end up as type @xmath116 or @xmath117 . in two of the runs , the most compact binaries after @xmath104 consist of less massive stars .    the average value of the semimajor axis after @xmath120 in the large scale , @xmath119 runs is @xmath121 , and the minimum value of @xmath64 across the 20 runs is 60  au .",
    "these values for @xmath64 are much larger than that necessary for rlof to take place , @xmath122  au .",
    "their characteristic dynamical friction time scales are roughly @xmath123  yrs , which is much longer than their lifetimes ( see equation [ eq7 ] when @xmath124 and equation [ eq11 ] ) .",

    "a difference between the large - scale and the small - scale scenarios is that , whereas most cases in the large - scale calculations end up with one binary and unbound single stars ( in @xmath142 out of @xmath143 cases ) , in the small - scale runs a multiple system such as triple or quartet ( rather than a simple binary ) forms ( in 59 of 86 cases ) less massive stars take some energy from the multiple system and convert it into their kinetic energies while causing the binary to harden .    as an example",
    ", figure  [ fig:7 ] shows the evolution in the semi - major axis of a compact binary in one of the runs .",
    "one can easily notice the quick decrease in the semi - major axis during violent stellar interactions ( before 10  years ) , which clearly indicates the hardening .",
    "after a couple of stars are cast away and the multiple system is stabilized and isolated ( after about 10 years ) , dynamical friction plays the main role in the decrease of the semi - major axis ; after this point , we do not expect further dramatic hardening of the binary . in our 86 runs ,",

    "one notable difference is that for @xmath132 , the dynamical friction time scale is longer by 2 orders of magnitude compared to @xmath97 , because this quantity is inversely proportional to the number density .",

    "we consider only two of them as hmxbc and rule out the other two binaries since the mass of the more massive star is smaller than @xmath155 @xcite .",
    "we present the distribution of eccentricity for pericenter distance in figure  [ fig:8 ] . in particular , the _ left _ panel shows the distribution for @xmath97 calculations and the _ right _ panel for @xmath99 .",
    "the circled point indicates hmxbc with distance at pericenter shorter than the corresponding roche - lobe radius .",
    "how accretion proceeds in a highly eccentric binary system under these conditions remains an unsettled issue to date , as studies have claimed that the orbital semimajor axis and eccentricity can either increase or decrease depending on the binary properties at pericenter ( @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "if the rlof does induce circularization , then accretion proceeds normally ( i.e. steadily ) . however",
    ", if the rlof instead increases the eccentricity of the system , then , whether accretion can proceed steadily rather than intermittently will depend on the relative timescale between the disk lifetime @xmath156 ( on the order of the viscous timescale ) , and the orbital period of the binary @xmath157 .",
    "we computed these timescales for all the eccentric binaries in our simulations ( for which the roche - lobe radius straddles the pericenter and apocenter ) , and found that @xmath158 in all cases but one .",
    "this implies that the fraction of binaries whose eccentricities cause intermittent rlof is small , and that as a global average , rlof is steady to a good approximation .",
    "the magnitude of the gas density considerably influences the characteristics of the dynamical interactions . while on the one hand @xmath159 of the simulations end up forming the same triples for both density values , on the other hand their trajectories and the center of mass movements differ significantly .",
    "figure  [ fig:4 ] shows two sample trajectories of 5 stars with low number density ( left panel ) and high number density ( right panel ) after 1000 yr .",
    "they were given identical initial conditions for the run , but their trajectories have developed differently . in figure",
    "[ fig:3 ] , at 800 yr , even though the same stars form a triple and the same star is ejected for both number densities , their trajectories are clearly different .    as can be seen in figure  [ fig:2 ] , which shows the change of forces per unit mass exerted on a typical kicked - off star , @xmath160 and @xmath161 are negligible compared to @xmath162 before about 5 years .    note that @xmath160 and @xmath161 are synchronized at early times because the motions of the stars are close to the keplerian motion , @xmath163 .",
    "the star in figure  [ fig:2 ] is ejected at @xmath164 for the high number density ( and at @xmath165 for the low number density ) .",
    "this can be understood from the fact that @xmath162 monotonically decreases and @xmath161 increases ( @xmath166 where @xmath88 is the distance from the center of mass ) . at the same time , @xmath167 barely changes since the star moves in the supersonic regime and the speed decreases slowly .",
    "there is no noticeable difference in the overall results between the @xmath132 and @xmath119 runs  quantities such as @xmath168 , the dynamical friction time scale @xmath169 , the total mass of the most compact binary ( or which star forms the compact binary with @xmath113 ) as summarized in table [ tab : tab2 ] . for both number densities ,",
    "the companion star of the binary is typically the third most massive star @xmath118 .    to sum up , we find that @xmath170 of our simulations form hmxbc , regardless of the gas density value .",

    "we now explore several different configurations for the star group , and run several sets of simulations with 10 stars ( instead of 5 ) .",
    "these are : ( 1 ) 10-body version of the small scale calculation presented above ; ( 2 ) head - on crash of two star groups containing 5 stars each ; ( 3 ) a close encounter and subsequent inspiral and merger of two star groups containing 5 stars each .",
    "the latter two scenarios are motivated by the fact that the merger timescales and mass accretion timescales of pop  iii host haloes , as well as the lifetimes of the massive pop  iii stars themselves , are of the same order , @xmath172 .",
    "this suggests that merging haloes will be continuously forming new stars ( perhaps pop  ii instead of pop  iii ) as they merge with other haloes , and that close interactions and mergers of nascent star groups may be relatively common .",

    "this is a common feature of the 10-body simulations : they often end up with triples whose inner binary is @xmath184 while the outer binary is @xmath185 .",
    "our simulations yield @xmath186 and @xmath187 . also note that , in 14 out of 18 hmxbc , the binary is @xmath188 ( i.e. it is not made up of the two most massive stars ) .    since the compact binaries in these simulations form quickly and we only follow them for 500 years , it is technically possible that they will be disrupted before one of the stars turns into a bh .",
    "however , our simulations for the 5-body scenario showed that compact , quasi - steady binaries are unlikely to be disrupted , and for practical purposes we extrapolate this qualitative result to the 10-body case .",
    "we find that a hmxbc forms in a larger fraction of these simulations than in the 5-body case , @xmath189 , for the obvious reason that there are more stars . per unit stellar mass in the simulations , the number of hmxb candidates is @xmath190 , which is a factor @xmath191 higher than we found for the 5-body case .",
    "two groups of 5 stars are set up with random initial conditions , in the same manner as for the previous simulations of 5-body groups .",
    "the two groups are then arranged to collide head - on , as follows : they are placed at a separation of two to three times their sizes and their disks are aligned so that the mutual inclination is zero .",
    "the initial relative speed of the groups is roughly the speed of sound and the center of mass of one group is set to move directly toward the center of mass of the other group .",
    "we find that prior to colliding , each group forms a compact binary of type @xmath116 ( the most and second - most massive star ) .",
    "when the two groups collide , those two binaries that existed before the collision were broken and the two most massive stars of each group form a new compact binary with high chances .",
    "the average @xmath192 is @xmath193 , but @xmath194 and @xmath195 , meaning that the most compact binaries are not formed from the most massive stars .",
    "the shorter average separations may be a result of a larger number of early 3-body scatterings , which act to harden the group as a whole .",
    "hmxbc form in 10 out of 30 runs , and they are not of type @xmath116 .",
    "however , we find a rate of hmxb formation per stellar mass @xmath196 ; this is higher than in the 5-body case and comparable to scenario 1 above .",
    "sample trajectories for one of the simulations of scenario 2 are depicted in figure  [ fig:10 ] .",
    "we have used the same input parameters for the two groups as in scenario 2 , except that we now set the impact parameter to be of order the size of the group , whereas it was set to zero in scenario 2 .",
    "the groups are given opposite velocities of @xmath197 along the @xmath198-direction , and are offset by a displacement along the @xmath199-direction that is @xmath200 times the typical size of the star group ( @xmath201 ) so that they merge with a spiral motion .",
    "we find that @xmath202 , @xmath203 and @xmath204 .",
    "the average separation lies between what we find in scenarios 1 and 2 .",
    "this can be interpreted as being due to the fact that these simulations ( in which the two groups merge gradually via inspiral ) have more close 3-body interactions than in scenario 1 ( in which 10 stars in quasi - keplerian orbits evolve in isolation ) but fewer such interactions than in scenario 2 ( in which the two groups merge head - on ) .",
    "hmxbs form in 8 out of 30 runs and , as with scenarios 1 and 2 , none of the hmxbs are made up of the two most massive stars .",
    "we find a similar hmxb formation rate per stellar mass , @xmath205 .",
    "sample trajectories from one of the simulations for scenario 3 are shown in figure  [ fig:11 ] .",
    "in these two scenarios , we again set two groups of five stars each on a collision course .",

    "the two most massive stars form the most compact binary .",
    "stellar binaries end up with somewhat closer separations in the nearly counter - rotating case , due to the fact that the net angular momentum of the merged star group is smaller .",
    "indeed , we find a total of four hmxbc across all the @xmath206 simulations , and eight in a same number of @xmath207 simulations .",
    "for the same reason , we find a larger fraction of hmxb candidates per stellar mass simulated in the nearly counter - rotating case ( @xmath215 ) compared to the nearly co - rotating case ( @xmath216 ) .",
    "the overall formation rate of hmxb candidates is lower for both cases than the cases in which all the stellar orbits were nearly coplanar ( scenarios 1 , 2 and 3 ) , plausibly due to the additional degree of freedom in the stellar orbits .",
    "still , the value of @xmath138 is within a factor of a few for all of our simulations .",
    "sample trajectories from runs for scenarios 4a and 4b are depicted in figure  [ fig:12 ] and figure  [ fig:13 ] , respectively .",
    "our large - scale simulations show that the if pop  iii stars form hundreds of au apart , as in the simulations of @xcite , then the timescales required to make hmxbs via stellar scatterings are simply too long . on the other hand , if protostellar clouds fragment and form stars in close groups on scales of @xmath217 , as in @xcite , then a small fraction of groups can form hmxbs .",
    "we briefly discuss the dynamics of hmxb formation in our simulations , then move on to discuss the astrophysical implications of our findings .",
    "the simulations indicate that , as expected , scatterings play a major role in making a compact binary .",
    "the background potential and the dynamical friction play a secondary role , by allowing the most compact binary ( or triple ) to remain near the center of mass of the halo and for other stars to return and scatter again and again .",
    "we find that on average , the number of hmxb candidates formed per stellar mass , @xmath138 , is a function of the number and orientation of close 3-body encounters .",
    "our results indicate that @xmath138 may be somewhat higher in configurations that result in fewer ejections of stars , and if the interactions are coplanar . while we are able to interpret this , as well as trends in the average separation between stellar pairs , in terms of the initial kinematic setup of the various scenarios simulated ( see  [ subsec:10-body ] above ) , the value of @xmath138 does not vary by more than a factor @xmath191 .",
    "we interpret this lack of a significant variation in @xmath138 , for such a diverse set of initial conditions and ambient gas densities , to mean that our values are not far from the one that results from similar stellar encounters in nature .      another way in which a nascent stellar group could harden is migration through a gaseous disk .",
    "the migration could occur as the protostars form@xcite found significant accretion from the protostellar disk onto the most massive protostar , and did not follow the evolution of the system beyond this stage .",
    "( it could also occur to a lesser degree in a vestigial gas disk , after the stars are in place . )",

    "condition ( 2 ) relates the gap width and the roche radius of the secondary ; this ensures that the secondary acts to transfer orbital angular momentum through the disk , rather than accreting mass via rlof .",
    "we find that inside @xmath229 , for the disk properties stated above , @xmath230 is smaller than the right - hand side of equation ( [ eq26 ] ) by a factor @xmath231 , and smaller than the right - hand side of equation ( [ eq21 ] ) by a factor @xmath232 , indicating that the secondary is easily able to open a gap .",
    "the migration timescale of the secondary depends on the dimensionless parameter @xcite @xmath233 where @xmath234 is the local surface density of a steady - state disk around the primary , in the absence of perturbations by the secondary . for @xmath235 ,",
    "the gas in the disk is able to dynamically dominate over the gravitational influence of the secondary , and the secondary is pushed inward on the viscous diffusion timescale of the disk , @xmath236 for @xmath237 , @xcite found that the migration timescale is longer , @xmath238    in figure  [ fig:6 ] , we plot the local disk mass near the secondary , @xmath239 , alongside the typical secondary mass , @xmath240 ( the numerator and denominator , respectively , for the ratio @xmath241 ) . for @xmath242 , @xmath237 and the migration timescale",

    "we plot the two migration timescales @xmath243 and @xmath244 in figure  [ fig:9 ] .    both of these timescales are shorter than both the typical lifetimes of protostellar disks , as well as of the stars themselves .",
    "this suggests that disk migration could , in principle , lead to initial stellar separations smaller than what we have assumed , making the formation of hmxbs via stellar scatterings more favorable . on",
    "the other hand , radiative feedback from the stars could blow away the disk before significant migration can occur .",
    "we submit that the hmxb formation rates inferred from our simulations be taken as a conservative estimate , with possible additional contributions from channels other than stellar scattering .      as discussed in ",

    "therefore , our results suggest that lgrb rates from pop  iii stars could be comparable to or somewhat higher than the rates from pop  i / ii stars .",
    "our suite of @xmath1-body simulations , spanning diverse sets of initial conditions for pop  iii stars and their environments , point that hmxbs form in higher fractions in the earliest galaxies than at low redshifts , and make significant contributions to the thermal history of the igm , the @xmath11 signature at @xmath16 , and to the rates of lgrbs .",
    "the fact that the formation rates of hmxbs varied little between the simulations suggest that our estimates for @xmath138 is reasonably robust .",
    "however , we here point out several uncertainties of our work that could affect our conclusions .",
    "one important factor is the imf of the stars ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "we adopted the imf of @xcite , which were based on the masses of protostars roughly @xmath141 after the formation of the protostellar seeds .",
    "however , our key results are based on fragmentation of the protostellar clouds on smaller scales , as found in the simulations by @xcite . in those simulations , the most massive protostars had the highest accretion rates , suggesting that the imf slope may be steeper than what we assumed",
    ". we also did not account for changes in the masses of stars as they evolved .",
    "these are important considerations , as the masses of the stars play a critical role in determining the time that a binary spends transferring mass as a hmxb .",
    "we made an effort to account for this limitation by using free parameters such as @xmath264 , which accounts for the mass loss during the sn explosion .",
    "another factor that could be more carefully treated in future studies is the spin of the star . in a binary system , this impacts the circularization of the orbit , followed by low eccentricity and the synchronization of spin with orbital phase .",
    "due to tidal dissipation and circularization , this could additionally decrease the orbital distance of a binary , boosting the formation of hmxbs and change the average value of the eccentricity .",
    "in addition to reducing the orbital separation , the spin makes a difference in mass transfer rates .",
    "our simulations generally produce binaries with large eccentricities . for highly eccentric orbits ,",
    "mass transfer occurs only near pericenter ( @xcite and @xcite ) , and the rates depend on whether the orbital angular speed of the star is super - sychronous or sub - synchronous with rotational angular speed @xcite .",
    "we found that the viscous timescales in our eccentric binaries were longer than the orbital timescales in the majority of cases , and used this fact to conclude that their duty cycle should be the same as for nearly circular binaries .",
    "however , we did find one exception , in which a rlof accretion event would be sufficiently short - lived to be episodic .",
    "a more careful study focused on stellar rotation effects may be necessary to more conclusively estimate the duty cycle of eccentric pop  iii hmxbs .",
    "finally , our simulations are an attempt to model the stellar dynamics as a gravitational @xmath1-body problem with perturbative forces due to a fixed , smooth gaseous background .",
    "more detailed simulations that include detailed stellar feedback , as well as the dynamics and thermodynamics of the gaseous environment , could lead to additional revelations about the early evolution of pop  iii star groups .",
    "in this study , we used @xmath1-body simulations of the first stars to explore the formation , evolution , disruption and energy output of pop  iii hmxbs .",
    "the code includes gravitational scattering of stars , dynamical friction , and the gravitational potential of ambient gas .",
    "the initial conditions for the simulations ( i.e. imf , typical star separation in the host haloes , ambient densities ) are taken from two different sets of cosmological simulations of pop  iii formation , namely by @xcite ( large - scale , i.e. a few thousands of au ) , and @xcite , ( small - scale , i.e. a few tens of au ) .",
    "these provide two complementary sets in that they explore different physical scales for star formation ( for details , see [ sec : initialsetup ] ) .",
    "for each of the two scenarios , we investigated star evolution in two backgound gas densities , a high - density case ( @xmath308 ) , and a lower - density one ( @xmath309 ) .      1 .",
    "_ 5-body simulations _ : if stars form in quasi - keplerian disk configurations with initial separations of hundreds of au , hmxbs are highly unlikely to form .",
    "in contrast , if stars form in compact groups separated by @xmath310 , as is expected from turbulent fragmentation , stellar scatterings lead to a significant hmxb formation rate .",
    "in particular , we found that hmxbs form at a rate of a few per @xmath311 of stars formed , independent of the ambient gas density .",
    "10-body simulations _ :",
    "we simulated 10 stars on separations of @xmath310 , and evolved them as isolated quasi - keplerian disks , or as two colliding groups with 5 stars each . for the latter",
    ", we ran several different sets of collision geometries .",
    "+ we found that the hmxb formation rate was a factor @xmath312 times higher than for the @xmath313-body simulations , mainly due to the fact that the larger number of stars allowed for more hardening via stellar scattering .",
    "all of the small - scale simulations suggest an x - ray luminosity per unit star formation that is a factor @xmath5 higher than what is observed in the local universe ( under the assumption that other variables such as the x - ray escape fraction from galaxies and the duty cycle of hmxbs do not differ significantly ) .",
    "these results are mostly due to _ the large mass of the most massive star of the hmxbc compared to that of the companion star , implying both a large @xmath283 as well as a higher luminosity of the remnant bh_. the fact that we found little variation in this quantity across all of our simulations suggests that this is a robust estimate .",
    "additional factors , such as in - disk migration of nascent stars , could further increase the hmxb formation efficiency .",
    "a direct consequence is that x - rays can heat the igm rapidly at cosmic dawn .",
    "signals of early heating can be probed via the 21  cm line radiation : the absorption line signal is expected to show a broader , shallower minimum due to the shorter gas cooling time , while the emission line would be observed earlier because of the higher gas temperature , at earlier times .",
    "several studies have modeled the 21  cm signature of the first hmxbs , but relied on assumptions for their @xmath314 relation relative to the empirical value found at lower redshifts .",
    "our work provides a theoretically driven estimate for this quantity .",
    "in addition to the implications for the thermal history of the igm , these high formation rates of hmxbs per stellar mass imply a higher grb formation efficiency from pop  iii stars in binaries .",
    "this predictions can be tested with a long baseline of observational data from _ swift_."
