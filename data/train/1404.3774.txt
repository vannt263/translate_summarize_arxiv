    "this article presents an unforeseen connection between two subjects originally studied for separate reasons by the quantum bayesians , or to use the more recent and specific term , qbists  @xcite .",
    "one of these topics originates in the paper `` conditions for compatibility of quantum state assignments ''",
    "@xcite by caves , fuchs and schack ( cfs ) .",
    "refining cfs s treatment reveals an unexpected link between the concept of compatibility and other constructions of quantum information theory .",
    "we begin by taking up the question of what it means for probability distributions to be compatible with one another .",
    "consider a thoroughly classical scenario , in which alice and bob are gambling on the outcome of a coin toss .",
    "both alice and bob are certain the toss is rigged , but alice is convinced that the outcome will be heads , while bob is equally steadfast in maintaining that it will be tails .",
    "that is , @xmath0 and @xmath1 , while @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "no matter which way the coin lands , one party will be disappointed  or , depending on the stakes , bankrupt .",
    "we can equally well present a single - user version of this scenario .",
    "imagine that alice , and only alice , is gambling on the coin flip , and that conditional on some other information , she will choose to do so in accord with either the probability distribution @xmath4 or the alternative , @xmath5 for example , alice may be confident that the toss will be rigged and that she can deduce which way it will be rigged once she can observe the handedness of the coin - tosser .",
    "the incompatibility between @xmath6 and @xmath7 is then relevant to alice , regardless of the presence or absence of other players .",
    "having formulated the scenario in single - user terms , we can develop a quantum analogue ; a single - user statement avoids the conceptual problem of whether an event occurring for an agent alice could , in the quantum setting , itself be an event for any other agent  @xcite .",
    "the quantum version of this kind of incompatibility is a condition on pairs of quantum states .",
    "take two density matrices @xmath8 and @xmath9 . if there exists a measurement @xmath10 such that @xmath11 then @xmath8 and @xmath9 are called _ post - peierls incompatible _",
    "if two states are post - peierls ( pp ) compatibile , then for _ all _ experiments , there is at least one outcome for which both states yield nonzero probability via the born rule . we can naturally extend this criterion to sets of more than two quantum states . in general , a set of  @xmath12 states is pp incompatible when , for some experiment @xmath10 , @xmath13    a von neumann measurement is a povm with @xmath14 possible outcomes , specified by a set of  @xmath14 orthonormal vectors in hilbert space . in terms of projection operators ,",
    "each von neumann measurement comprises @xmath14 one - dimensional orthogonal projectors .",
    "therefore , compatibility with respect to von neumann measurements is known as _ pp - odop _",
    "compatibility @xcite . when we formulate an exact criterion for pp - odop compatibility of _ qutrit _ pure states , _",
    "i.e. , _ pure states in  @xmath15 , we find something interesting .    in the next two sections",
    ", we will examine pp - odop compatibility in more detail and find a connection to another topic of much interest to the qbist research programme . for completeness",
    ", we note that compatibility criteria have also recently entered the quantum foundations discourse through a different route .",
    "they play a key role in discussions of whether quantum states can be treated as encoding information about the values of hidden variables  @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we disregard the issue of hidden variables and treat quantum states as directly specifying the probabilities of experiment outcomes .",
    "in this section , we will correct two mathematical errors in cfs .",
    "one error is a minor nit to pick , while the other is a missed opportunity , as it introduced an inconsistency into cfs s calculations and obscured the connection which we shall examine here .",
    "it is possible to have triplets of states which are pp - odop incompatible when taken all together , even though they are compatible when taken in pairs .",
    "cfs provide a specific example , which for convenience we reproduce here .",
    "pick an orthonormal basis @xmath16 , and consider the following three possible states which can be ascribed to a qutrit : @xmath17 now , alice the graduate student performs a von neumann experiment in the computational basis of @xmath18 .",
    "whatever result she experiences , there is a state in the set @xmath19 for which that experience would be a crushing disappointment .",
    "a general set of three pure states @xmath20 is pp - odop incompatible at the tertiary level if some orthonormal basis @xmath18 exists such that @xmath21 the three @xmath22 angles are restricted to the interval @xmath23 , while the @xmath24 and @xmath25 angles must all lie in the interval @xmath26 .",
    "taking the inner products picks out one basis vector per pair : @xmath27 this is the first of the two mathematical errors mentioned above : because the @xmath25-dependent phase factors come from the bra vectors rather than the ket vectors , the sign in the exponential should be negative , instead of positive as written in cfs s equation ( 19 ) .",
    "the sign error cancels in the next step , which is to multiply these quantities by their complex conjugates , yielding @xmath28 after some algebra , one can prove from eq .",
    "( [ eq : pp - odop - trig ] ) that three pure states in  @xmath15 are pp - odop incompatible if and only if @xmath29 this is the second error in cfs : the latter inequality should be @xmath30 rather than @xmath31 , as written in cfs s formula ( 28 ) .",
    "this is the more consequential error , since if the inequality is strict , then the example of three - party pp - incompatible states which cfs provide  our triplet ( [ eq : example - set])is not consistent with cfs s compatibility criterion .",
    "the error originates in cfs s expression ( 23 ) , by neglecting zero as a possible value under the radical in the quadratic formula .",
    "the second inequality has a more intricate structure than the first .",
    "what happens when we try to _ saturate _ it ?",
    "suppose we require that the three squared overlaps all have the same value , @xmath32 .",
    "then saturating the second inequality implies that @xmath32 satisfies the cubic equation @xmath33 this cubic polynomial has a zero at @xmath34 , and a double zero at  @xmath35 , which is disallowed by the requirement that the states are nonidentical .",
    "how many states can we push simultaneously to the edge of pp - odop incompatibility in this way ? that is , how many states in qutrit state space can we find such that for any two of them , @xmath36 this is the problem of finding the _ maximal set of equiangular lines _ in three - dimensional complex vector space .    beginning with the question of compatibility among probability distributions",
    ", we have arrived at _",
    "symmetric informationally complete povms",
    "_  @xcite .",
    "a sic for a @xmath14-dimensional hilbert space is a set of @xmath37 operators @xmath38 where the rank - one projection operators @xmath39 satisfy @xmath40 it is known that sics are maximal in this regard , _",
    "i.e. , _ no more than @xmath37 operators can simultaneously satisfy eq .",
    "( [ eq : sic - trace ] ) . for qutrits",
    ", this means that a set of states such that any three saturate the edge of pp - odop incompatibility can contain at most _ nine _ states .",
    "we have shown that any triple of states chosen from a qutrit sic will be pp - incompatible .",
    "one might expect that a large number of different von neumann measurements would be required to cover all the possible choices of triples , perhaps comparable to the number of triples themselves .",
    "surprisingly , this is not the case ; our toolbox can be much more economical .",
    "take @xmath41 and @xmath42 to be its complex conjugate , and construct the following set of states : @xmath43 the set of nine states @xmath44 forms a sic known as the _ hesse sic _  @xcite .",
    "for the hesse sic , a set of _ four _ orthogonal bases is sufficient to reveal the pp - incompatibility of all possible triples .",
    "moreover , the requisite bases have an interesting property : they are _ mutually unbiased _ with respect to each other .",
    "any set of three states drawn from the sic will be revealed pp - incompatible by a measurement in one or more of the mutually unbiased bases ( mubs ) .",
    "we construct each mub vector by finding a state orthogonal to three of the sic states .",
    "specifically , each mub vector corresponds to an element in a steiner triple system  @xcite of order 9 , which we build by cyclically tracing all the horizontal , vertical and diagonal lines in the array @xmath45 each possible value of the index @xmath46 occurs in exactly four entries of @xmath47 , and each possible _ pair _ of index values occurs exactly once .",
    "it is easiest to see the meaning of this construction using the sic representation of quantum states .",
    "any quantum state , pure or mixed , is equivalent to a probability distribution over the outcomes of an informationally complete measurement , and the qutrit sic of eq .",
    "( [ eq : me - sic ] ) furnishes such a measurement .",
    "an arbitrary qutrit density matrix @xmath48 can be decomposed as @xmath49 where @xmath50 and @xmath51 is the born - rule probability @xmath52 to construct the state orthogonal to sic vectors @xmath53 , @xmath54 and @xmath55 , we simply write a probability vector @xmath56 which is zero in entries @xmath46 , @xmath57 and @xmath58 , and @xmath59 everywhere else .    to see why this construction yields a complete set of mubs , we use the fact that the hilbert  schmidt inner product of density matrices is just an affine transformation of the euclidean inner product of the corresponding probability distributions  @xcite . for qutrit states ,",
    "@xmath60 this means that if @xmath48 and @xmath61 are orthogonal , then @xmath62 .    with this",
    ", we can see that the vectors orthogonal to @xmath63 and @xmath64 , for example , must be orthogonal to each other , because when we take the dot product of their sic representations , we only have three nonzero contributions . if instead we take the vectors orthogonal to @xmath63 and @xmath65 , say , a zero in one vector coincides with a zero in the other , so the dot product can come out larger .",
    "these within - row and between - rows relationships hold generally .",
    "each row corresponds to a set of three mutually orthogonal vectors , and when we take vectors from two different rows , we always get the same nonzero overlap : the hilbert space inner product of their density matrices is always @xmath66 .",
    "we have fashioned a _",
    "complete set of mutually unbiased bases .",
    "_ starting with the sic ( [ eq : me - sic ] ) , we constructed 12 pure states which fall into four sets of three .",
    "each set of three , corresponding to a row in our table , is an orthonormal basis .",
    "when we take the hilbert  schmidt inner product of a state from one basis with a state from another , we get @xmath67 every time .",
    "this is the requirement for two bases to be mutually unbiased .",
    "( in older language , the observables associated with any two such bases are complementary @xcite . )",
    "what s more , we constructed @xmath68 mubs , which is the largest number which can possibly exist in @xmath14 dimensions @xcite . while the relation between qutrit sic and mub states has been known for some time  @xcite , the convenience of the sic representation has so far not been appreciated .",
    "given any three distinct elements from the sic set , a measurement in at least one of the mubs will reveal pp - odop incompatibility among those three states .",
    "for example , say we pick the sic elements @xmath69 , @xmath70 and @xmath71",
    ". then we measure in the basis given by the vectors orthogonal to the fourth row : @xmath72 , @xmath73 , @xmath74 .",
    "each possible outcome of the experiment conflicts with one of the three given states : the first with the state ascription @xmath69 , the second with the ascription @xmath70 and the third with @xmath71 .",
    "so , we have pp - odop incompatibility at the ternary level , while of course any two distinct states in the sic are _ pairwise _ compatible , having an inner - product - squared of  @xmath75 .",
    "note that the second error in cfs , writing @xmath31 instead of @xmath30 in the condition ( [ eq : pp - odop - sym2 ] ) , mistakenly implies that triplets of sic states are pp - odop compatible , though barely so .",
    "this is clearly incorrect , as we can see by testing @xmath69 , @xmath70 and @xmath76 in the computational basis .",
    "in order to be a sic representation of a _ pure _ quantum state , a probability distribution @xmath51 must satisfy two conditions  @xcite .",
    "the first is quadratic : @xmath77 and the second is cubic , or `` qbic '' : @xmath78 p(i)p(j)p(k )   = \\frac{d+7}{(d+1)^3}. \\label{eq : purity2}\\ ] ] the quadratic condition has an interesting interpretation that provides a handy mnemonic for it  @xcite .",
    "whenever we have a probability distribution , we can compute indices that summarize its properties .",
    "one well - known example is the shannon entropy , also designated the shannon information or shannon index , which reflects the extent to which a probability distribution is `` spread out . ''",
    "the shannon index is maximized for a uniform distribution , and it attains its minimum value of zero when the distribution is a delta function . another way to quantify the spread of a probability distribution is an _ effective number .",
    "imagine that we have an urn full of marbles , and we presume that when we draw a marble from the urn , no choice is preferred over any other .",
    "if the urn contains @xmath12 marbles , our probability of obtaining any individual one of them is @xmath79 .",
    "but what if our probability distribution is not uniform , as it would be if we thought the drawing was rigged in some way ? in that case , we can label the marbles with the integers from  1 to  @xmath12 , and we say that our probability for obtaining the one labeled @xmath46 is @xmath51 .",
    "we draw one marble , replace it and repeat the drawing . what is the probability that we will draw the same marble both times ?",
    "let the result of the first drawing be @xmath57 .",
    "then our probability for obtaining that marble again is @xmath80 , and to find the overall probability for drawing doubles , we average over all the choices of  @xmath57 : @xmath81 for a uniform distribution , this is @xmath82 that is , if all draws are equally probable , then the probability of a coincidence is the reciprocal of the population size . turning this around",
    ", we can say that whatever our probabilities for the different draws , the effective size of the population is @xmath83^{-1}.\\ ] ]    amusingly , assigning a pure state to a quantum system means that the _ effective number _ of possible outcomes for a sic experiment that one is willing to contemplate is a simple combinatorial quantity : @xmath84    another way to think of this is that when all sic outcomes are judged as equiprobable , that is to say @xmath85 , the effective number of experimental outcomes is the total number which comprise the sic : @xmath86 .",
    "so , if we focus on the quadratic constraint , ascribing a pure state means neglecting @xmath87 possible outcomes of a sic experiment .",
    "entertainingly , this is also the best known upper bound on the number of entries which can be zero in a quantum - state assignment @xmath88 @xcite .",
    "this is not a coincidence : we can deduce that bound by starting with the normalization of @xmath88 and squaring to find @xmath89 we then apply the cauchy ",
    "schwarz inequality to find , writing @xmath90 for the number of zero - valued entries in @xmath88 , @xmath91 we see the inverse of the effective number appearing on the left - hand side .",
    "consequently , @xmath92 and from eq .",
    "( [ eq : purity1 ] ) we know the right - hand side equals @xmath93 , as advertised .. note that in @xmath15 , this is equivalent to the bound in eq .",
    "( [ eq : weak - zeros - bound ] ) . however , using the so - called _ hoggar sic _ in dimension @xmath94 , we can construct states that saturate the bound in eq .",
    "( [ eq : weak - zeros - bound ] ) , containing exactly 28 zeros .",
    "this follows readily from the recent results of szymusiak and somczyski  @xcite .",
    "therefore , eq .  ( [ eq : weak - zeros - bound ] ) is actually the tightest bound possible in general . ]",
    "using the hesse sic to define a representation for qutrit state space , the qbic condition can be simplified to @xmath95 here , @xmath47 is the steiner triple system defined above .",
    "this is a consequence  @xcite of the fact that for the hesse sic , the triple products @xmath96 take a particularly simple form .",
    "note that if all three indices are equal , then @xmath97 reduces to @xmath98 , which is unity .",
    "likewise , if two of the three indices are equal , then the value of the triple product follows from the definition of a sic , ( [ eq : sic - trace ] ) .",
    "the nontrivial case is when all three indices differ .",
    "all known sics have a _ group covariance _ property : they can be generated by starting with a single vector ( the so - called `` fiducial '' ) , and applying the elements of a group to that vector to create all the others .",
    "in all cases but one , that group is the _ weyl  heisenberg group _",
    "@xcite , which is defined from the two generators @xmath99 combinations of @xmath100 and @xmath101 , together with phase factors , yield the weyl  heisenberg displacement operators : @xmath102 starting with the fiducial vector @xmath69 , we create the other vectors in the sic by applying @xmath103 , with @xmath104 . because @xmath105 , it is convenient to visualize the weyl  heisenberg displacement operators as living at the points of a @xmath106 grid . in @xmath15 ,",
    "this grid is just the square array from eq .",
    "( [ eq : steiner ] ) .",
    "group covariance alone tells us something about the triple products : if acting with a group element @xmath107 on the projectors transforms them as @xmath108 then the cyclic property of the trace implies @xmath109    in dimension @xmath15 , we have a grid of nine points that we can carve up into four different `` striations '' ( horizontal , vertical and two diagonal ) .",
    "each striation is a set of three parallel lines , corresponding to three vectors in an orthonormal basis .",
    "the weyl  heisenberg operators are horizontal and vertical shifts of this grid .",
    "these shifts map one line in a striation into another .",
    "any triple product corresponds to a set of three points in the grid .",
    "therefore , if a triple product belongs to one of the four striations , we can transform it into any other triple product in that striation , by applying a weyl  heisenberg operator and possibly permuting indices .",
    "consequently , triple products are constant on striations .",
    "the hesse sic has the additional nice property that triple products are constant from one set of parallel lines to another .",
    "the upshot of this is that for the hesse sic , we can find all the nontrivial triple products entirely geometrically .",
    "if @xmath57 , @xmath58 and @xmath110 are three _ collinear _ points , then @xmath111 otherwise , if @xmath57 , @xmath58 and @xmath110 are distinct but noncollinear , @xmath112 the fact that the triple products follow this geometrical rule is what allows us to reduce the qbic equation ( [ eq : purity2 ] ) to the simpler form of eq .",
    "( [ eq : qbic - tabia ] ) .",
    "if we have a probability distribution , we can compute the shannon entropy of it .",
    "we can , therefore , ask which pure states maximize or minimize the shannon entropy of their sic representations .",
    "in particular , if we try to minimize the shannon entropy of  @xmath56 under the constraint that its `` effective number '' is @xmath113^{-1 } = \\frac{d(d+1)}{2},\\ ] ] then we find that @xmath51 must be 0 in exactly three entries , and uniformly @xmath114 elsewhere .",
    "( this is pointed out , in slightly different language , by szymusiak and somczyski  @xcite . )",
    "how many such vectors are valid quantum states ?",
    "we must check them against the qbic equation ( [ eq : qbic - tabia ] ) . for any vector of this form , @xmath115 therefore , we must have @xmath116 suppose that we fill in one line of our @xmath117 grid with zeros . if @xmath46 , @xmath57 and @xmath58 are the points on this line , or on any line that intersects with it , then @xmath118 will evaluate to zero . exactly",
    "two lines will correspond to nonzero products , namely , the two lines parallel to the one we filled with zeros .",
    "therefore , @xmath119    it follows that the states we seek are the twelve states made by filling one line in the @xmath117 grid with zeros and inserting @xmath114 elsewhere .",
    "these twelve states fall naturally into four sets of three , corresponding to the four rows of our table .",
    "each row is derived from one way of carving the grid into three parallel lines .",
    "having a complete set of mubs , we can define a discrete wigner function  @xcite .",
    "like a sic representation , a wigner representation is a way of writing a quantum state as a list of real numbers . unlike the sic representation , wigner functions for quantum states can have negative values , and",
    "thus are called `` quasi - probability distributions . ''",
    "it is easiest to define a wigner quasi - probability function when the hilbert - space dimension is a prime number or a power of a prime .",
    "wootters  @xcite showed that one can construct a set of _ phase - space point operators _ that live in a @xmath106 grid and enjoy the following properties .",
    "first , each of the @xmath37 operators is hermitian and has unit trace : @xmath120",
    "second , they are orthogonal to one another : @xmath121 third , if we carve the grid into a set of parallel lines @xmath122 , then @xmath123 defines a set @xmath124 of mutually orthogonal projection operators , the sum of which is the identity .",

    ".    moreover , it also follows from eq .",
    "( [ eq : wigner - sic ] ) that no entry in the wigner quasi - probability can go more negative than it does for the hesse sic states themselves .",

    "the sic states themselves pack as much negativity into a single entry as a state can have .",
    "this is why the hesse sic states are among the _ maximally magic resources _ for quantum computation  @xcite .",
    "we have seen how we can start with the hesse sic and construct four mubs by minimizing the shannon entropy of the sic representation , subject to the pure - state constraints .",
    "now , take the nine sic vectors and twelve mub vectors , and represent each vector by a vertex of a graph .",
    "connect two vertices with an edge if the corresponding states are orthogonal .",

    "but the bell  kochen  specker results take us out of that regime .",
    "we can think of the kochen ",
    "specker theorem ( and its more modern descendents ) in the following way .",
    "suppose that we have some physical system , and we list a series of `` questions '' that we might ask it .",
