    "d - branes on group manifolds have been the subject of intensive research over the past few years ( see , e.g. , @xcite@xcite ) , as they provide a good laboratory for testing our intuitive understanding of d - branes on curved spaces and a case where both geometric and algebraic methods can be applied .",
    "algebraically , d - branes on a group manifold @xmath0 are obtained as solutions to the gluing conditions of the chiral currents of the wzw - model @xcite @xmath1 where @xmath2 is an automorphism of the lie algebra @xmath3 of @xmath0 . in this paper",
    "we will restrict ourselves to the sector @xmath4 , i.e.the so - called symmetry preserving ( or untwisted ) d - branes .    geometrically , symmetry preserving d - branes wrap conjugacy classes @xmath5 .",

    "we discuss some exceptions to the discussion in section 3 , and in section 6 we discuss symmetry properties of the resulting d - brane charges .",
    "we conclude with a discussion in section 7 . in the three appendices we summarize our conventions , provide a list of generators for the fusion ideals and discuss an alternative derivation of our results using fusion potentials .",

    "explicitly , in terms of a ( preferred ) basis @xmath31 of @xmath30 we have @xmath32 where the coefficients @xmath33 are called the fusion coefficients .",
    "the matrices @xmath34 , with components @xmath35 , are mutually commuting and are simultaneously diagonalized by the modular matrix @xmath36 .",

    "the ideals arising from the fusion rules of a rcft are actually of a special kind , they correspond to so - called jacobian varieties ( see appendix [ appfuspot ] )",
    ".    in the case of the conformal field theory corresponding to the wzw model for a compact , simple , connected , simply - connected , lie group @xmath0 , the relevant representations are the integrable highest weight modules of the associated ( untwisted ) affine lie algebra @xmath7 at level @xmath8 .",

    "[ we identify @xmath54 with @xmath55 , by means of the nondegenerate bilinear form @xmath56 , throughout . ]",

    "while this would characterize the fusion ideal in terms of a finite set of generators , the number of boundary weights grows rapidly with @xmath8 and the corresponding set of generators is still far from optimal . in appendix [ appgensets ]",
    "we provide what we believe is a substantially smaller set of boundary weights , whose characters generate @xmath63 . for @xmath25 and @xmath26",
    "this has been proven .",
    "the sets provided are not always optimal , but it appears that what is an optimal set in those cases behaves chaotically with respect to @xmath8 .",
    "the charge group for symmetry preserving d - branes on group manifolds was investigated in @xcite . in particular , by considering the process of d - brane creation and annihilation , it was argued in @xcite that the charge of a d - brane associated to an integrable weight @xmath13 is given by the dimension @xmath14 of the finite dimensional irreducible representation @xmath15 of the horizontal lie algebra @xmath3 , modulo some integer @xmath16 .",

    "when not all the fundamental representations are integrable at the level @xmath8 considered , i.e.  when @xmath86 , the fusion ring @xmath83 can be presented as a quotient of a subset of the character ring , and the condition considered above is too strong for a homomorphism @xmath87 to exist .",
    "we will discuss this further in section [ secexcept ] , but for now we analyze the condition @xmath84 .",
    "it is sufficient to check @xmath84 on a set of generators of @xmath63 . in particular , assuming the set of boundary weights generate the fusion ideal , as discussed in section [ secfusion ] we have , @xmath88    the main result of our paper is that the maximal value of @xmath16 for which @xmath84 is given by the following formula @xmath89 where @xmath19 is an integer , independent of @xmath8 , given in table [ taba ] .",

    "in this section we discuss some of the symmetry properties of the charges @xmath93 , with @xmath16 given by . to simplify the discussion let us extend the dimension formula for @xmath14 in to all ( not necessarily dominant ) weights @xmath51 .",
    "it is obvious that @xmath14 ( and hence @xmath94 ) is invariant under both the weyl group @xmath95 and the group of outer automorphisms @xmath96 of @xmath3 . for elements @xmath97 ,",
    "i.e.  symmetries of the affine dynkin diagram , we find however that @xmath98 where @xmath99 is determined by @xmath100 .",
    "we recall that @xmath101 where @xmath102 is the weyl group element determined by ( see @xcite for details ) @xmath103 this symmetry reflects a similar symmetry in the fusion rule coefficients @xmath104    it is well - known that @xmath105 is isomorphic to the center @xmath106 of @xmath3 .",
    "the homomorphism for @xmath107 , such that @xmath108 , is explicitly given by @xmath109 geometrically , acting with an element of the center corresponds to rotating the conjugacy class around which the d - brane is wrapped and hence should leave invariant the charge , up to a possible sign @xcite .",
    "in fact , in @xcite ( see also @xcite for @xmath110 , where this was referred to as the ` multiplet structure ' ) it was shown that requiring the invariance , in the case of @xmath24 , leads to the same charge group .",
    "this is however not the case for the other lie groups .    finally , the charges @xmath94 have a symmetry under the affine weyl group @xmath111 , that reflects the symmetry in , e.g. , the modular s - matrices and specialized characters ( see ) @xmath112 the affine weyl group @xmath113 and the outer automorphism group @xmath114 combine into a group which projects onto the finite weight space as @xmath115 , where @xmath116 is the lattice dual to @xmath117 .",
    "it turns out that , apart from a few low level exceptions , enforcing charge invariance under @xmath115 determines the charge group in all cases . including the expected invariance under affine outer automorphisms is therefore not in conflict with the charge group results .",
    "rather surprisingly , when studying the action of the extended affine weyl group @xmath118 on @xmath94 , where @xmath119 is the weight lattice of @xmath3 ( in the simply laced case @xmath120 ) , one finds that holds for @xmath121 as well , in all cases except @xmath26 , @xmath122 not a power of @xmath77 , at certain levels .    in figure",
    "[ figc24charges ] , we show as an example , the charges for @xmath123 at level @xmath124 ( for which does hold for @xmath125 ) .",
    "the symmetry about the dashed line corresponds to the outer automorphism of @xmath126 .",
    "it is easily seen to be an element of @xmath95 of negative sign composed with a translation by @xmath127 ( note @xmath128 ) .",
    "the dotted lines correspond to more general symmetries .",

    "the upper dotted line corresponds to the composition of an element of @xmath95 of negative sign composed with a translation by @xmath131 .     at level @xmath124 ( shifted by @xmath132 ) and the charges of the corresponding symmetry preserving d - branes .",
    "the charges take values mod @xmath133 .",
    "note that the charges are negated ( mod @xmath133 ) under reflection about the dashed and dotted lines.,height=377 ]    requiring to hold for all @xmath134 for @xmath26 would lead to the requirement that @xmath16 is given by with @xmath135 , and thus would lead to a universal expression for all compact , simple , connected , simply - connected lie groups ( cf .  the discussion in section [ secdim ] ) .",
    "this is suggestive of the idea that maybe , in the case of @xmath26 , the fusion rule constraints on the charge group do not take into account all physical constraints that the d - brane charge group needs to satisfy .",
    "for this reason it would be very interesting to compute the twisted k - theory for @xmath26 and make a comparison .",

    "the comparison of the results of this paper with the corresponding twisted k - theory awaits a computation of the latter . in particular",
    "this would settle the issue of whether the consistency equations of @xcite , used in this paper , suffice to determine the charge group , in particular in the case of @xmath26 ( as discussed in section [ secsymm ] ) .    beyond that",
    ", it would be very interesting to have a direct understanding of why the two approaches should lead to the same result .",
    "for instance , while it is obvious in twisted k - theory that @xmath16 is a divisor of @xmath92 ( through the atiyah - hirzebruch spectral sequence @xcite ) , there does not appear to be a simple explanation for this in our approach .    by a result of freed , hopkins and telemann ( cf .",

    "it would be very interesting to establish a direct link between the equivariant and non - equivariant twisted k - theory of @xmath0 on the one hand , and the relation between the fusion algebra @xmath83 and homomorphisms @xmath87 on the other .",
    "a particularly concrete presentation of twisted k - theory is as the grothendieck k - theory of ( isomorphism classes of ) bundle gerbe modules @xcite .",

    ". it would be interesting to explicitly construct the bundle gerbe modules corresponding to a particular d - brane charge .",
    "finally , it would be interesting to extend the results of this paper to the non - symmetry preserving branes ( i.e.  twisted branes ) @xcite , branes on coset spaces @xcite@xcite , and beyond @xcite .",

    "for the affine lie algebra @xmath7 we use the same notations except that we put a hat on the symbols . to simplify notations",
