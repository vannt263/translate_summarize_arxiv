    "a progress in telecommunications , using of new methods in data transfer , creation of medical equipment are in need of the development of microelectronic devices for generation , commutation and detection of different kinds of signals .",
    "the most actual problem is an engineering of equipments working in terahertz and far infrared range of electromagnetic waves ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "one way to determine the characteristics of high frequency electromagnetic waves ( amplitude , frequency , phase ) is a study of the direct current response which can occur under certain conditions in solid - state structures with non - linear properties ( for example , ) . among the similar phenomena",
    "it should be noted a circular photogalvanic effect ( cpge ) ( see reviews @xcite ) , which was investigated in surface layers of bulk materials @xcite , in thin films @xcite , quantum wells @xcite , in graphene @xcite . without going into details , this effect is consisted in the appearance of a direct current under the influence of elliptically polarized electromagnetic wave with oblique incidence to the surface of the sample .",
    "the current flows perpendicularly to the projection of wave vector on the plane of the sample . by the magnitude of direct current",
    "one can draw a conclusion about properties of radiation as well as properties of a considered structure @xcite .",
    "effect is directly associated with the presence of spin of charge carriers and it was mostly explored in materials with hamiltonian containing the term which is linear by a quasi - momentum ( so - called rashba @xcite or dresselhaus @xcite terms ) .",
    "such hamiltonians take in consideration a spin - orbital interaction immediately @xcite .",
    "most of the works on cpge are devoted to research in visible and near infrared range of electromagnetic waves , where inter - band @xcite or inter - subband @xcite optical transition are essential for kinetic properties of considered structures . in range of low frequencies of radiation , where only indirect intraband transitions without spin - flip are possible",
    ", the effect is not appear @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that even though photon energy is not enough for realization of direct transitions , there are possible transition processes through virtual intermediate state @xcite , which is placed in another band , and cpge is feasible , but these transitions are second - order processes and the direct current magnitude in this case is noticeably less .",
    "cpge is related to the adsorption of circularly polarized electromagnetic wave which is resulting in optical orientation of spin because of angular momentum transfer from photons to electrons @xcite .",
    "a preferential direction appears in initially homogeneous electron momentum distribution which leads to a direct current arising . at oblique incidence of wave",
    "this preferential direction is defined by the projection of wave vector on the plane of the sample . at normal incidence of elliptically",
    "polarized wave a direct current is usually associated not so with symmetry breaking in distribution of charge carriers momenta as with the inhomogeneity of the sample @xcite .",
    "a preferential direction in material can be made by another way so , for example , applying a constant external electric field .",
    "in this situation a direct current generation is possible in direction perpendicular to the constant electric field under the influence of elliptically polarized electromagnetic wave , which is incident normally to the surface of the sample , when the frequency of wave is small compared with the band gap width .",
    "herewith a main contribution to direct current component should be made by indirect transitions between the states within one band , that are the first - order processes , and the effect should not depend on spin . in papers @xcite",
    "the effect of a direct current appearance in graphene and superlattice on the base of graphene in perpendicular to a constant field direction is investigated , when the elliptically polarized electromagnetic wave is incident normally to the surface of the sample ( the problem geometry is shown in [ fig:1 ] ) .",
    "the effect arising relates to a material spectrum non - additivity @xcite . in @xcite on the base of monte carlo modelling it was shown that the inelastic scattering of charge carriers on optical phonons makes a main contribution in this effect . in present paper",
    "it is made an attempt to investigate on the base of semiclassical monte carlo simulations the effect of generation of a direct transverse current under a simultaneous influence of elliptically polarized wave and constant electric field in material described by rashba hamiltonian .",
    "also we consider this problem in the approximation of a constant collision frequency and define the possibility of application of this approach .",
    "let us to examine a sample which surface is irradiated by normally incident elliptically polarized electromagnetic wave with components of @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "a constant electric field @xmath2 is applied along the surface of the sample ( fig .",
    "1 ) . the result electric field vector takes a form : @xmath3 we shall consider a two - dimensional material , described by the rashba hamiltonian : @xmath4 where @xmath5 are the pauli matrices : @xmath6 energy spectrum can be presented of : @xmath7 here @xmath8  is a rashba parameter @xcite , @xmath9  is a quasi - momentum vector of electron . the expression ( [ eq : eq2 ] )",
    "describes two subbands , in which a conductivity band splits after removal of the spin degeneracy @xcite . in present work",
    "we shall investigate transitions within one subband only , so we , to be more specific , shall choose in ( [ eq : eq2 ] ) plus sign .",
    "successive accounting of the influence of interband or intersubband transitions on the effect will be a subject of a separate study .",
    "let us to find a direct component of the current density along the @xmath10 axis : @xmath11 where @xmath12  is a velocity projection , @xmath13  is a surface concentration of charge carriers ( @xmath14 , @xmath15 - surface area of crystal , @xmath16 - number of charge carriers ) , the angle brackets are denoted an averaging on ensemble and time .",
    "strictly speaking , for carrying out averaging one has to know an electron distribution function , which requires the solution of kinetic equation .",
    "this approach we use in sect .",
    "3 where boltzmann kinetic equation in a constant collision frequency approximation is solved . because of mathematical complexity of problem the expression of direct current density",
    "is obtained in assumption of relative smallness of linear on quasi - momentum term in expression of energy spectrum in compare with quadratic term .",
    "this solution gives an opportunity to qualitative explain some features of the direct current density dependence on components of the electric field .",
    "but the approach of constant relaxation time does nt take in account the microscopic processes of charge carriers scattering , so for definition of relative contribution of different types of scatterers on the direct current density we use monte carlo modelling .",
    "method monte carlo allows us to perform an averaging of the velocity without the knowledge of an explicit form of the distribution function .",
    "note , that used below monte carlo method is essentially a method of solving of boltzmann kinetic equation ( mathematically rigorous justification of this approach is presented , for example , in @xcite ) , that is why all restrictions , related to the application possibility of the kinetic equation ( transition probability assumed to be independent on applied fields , predominantly accounting pair collisions , etc . ) concern to used approach too .",
    "the use of the monte carlo simulations for solving of physical kinetics problems ( see , for example , @xcite ) is a productive technique . using a fairly simple and easy to parallelized code",
    ", one can get a sufficiently accurate and reasonable physical results .",
    "[ sec:3 ] is devoted to a description of the modelling method .",
    "[ sec:4 ] contains a calculation of charge carriers scattering probability on acoustical and optical phonons in material with rashba hamiltonian .",
    "[ sec:5 ] is devoted to a description of the modelling of charge carriers distribution on the quasi - momentum absolute value and polar angle in two - dimensional quasi - momentum space , which is used in monte carlo simulations . in sect .",
    "[ sec:6 ] the results of monte carlo simulations are presented .",
    "also in this section there is a comparison of monte - carlo simulation results and results of the investigation of the problem on the base of boltzmann kinetic equation in approximation in constant collision frequency .",
    "we shall investigate boltzmann kinetic equation in approximation of a constant collision frequency : @xmath17 here @xmath18 is an equilibrium distribution function , @xmath19 is a mean collision frequency .",
    "the solution of ( [ eq : eq4 ] ) is a non - equilibrium distribution function .",
    "it can be found by a method of characteristics and takes a form @xmath20 here @xmath21 is a solution of semi - classical equations of motion @xmath22 the solution of ( [ eq : eq6 ] ) is @xmath23 where we introduce denotations @xmath24 we shall investigate non - degenerated electronic gas with equilibrium distribution function @xmath25 here @xmath26 is absolute temperature , @xmath27 is a normalization constant , @xmath28 @xmath29 is an error function , @xmath30 is a dimensionless parameter responsible for the spin - orbital interaction .",
    "so the current density along @xmath10 axis can be found by expression @xmath31 let us to carry out a substitution @xmath32 , @xmath33 .",
    "so the expression ( [ eq : eq11 ] ) is rearranged in the form @xmath34 in dimensionless denotations @xmath35 the current density is @xmath36 here @xmath37 at a temperature @xmath38 , assuming @xmath39 , @xmath40 , the dimensionless rashba parameter @xmath41 , so in a first non - vanishing approximation on @xmath42 we can keep only a linear term in the expression of the direct current density . after carrying out the taylor expansion on @xmath42 the expression under integral , passing into polar system of coordinates , remembering a subsequent averaging of the current density on time we give next expression for the current density : @xmath43 @xmath44 according to cauchy inequality @xmath45 , so using @xcite ( p.197 , 1.5.20.8 , 1.5.20.10 ) we receive : @xmath46.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath47 are complete elliptic integrals of the first and second kind , respectively , and @xmath48 is an elliptic integral of the third kind .",

    "( @xmath67 ) corresponds to approximately 10 sgse unit at a temperature @xmath68 , cyclic frequency of incident wave @xmath69 .",
    "rashba parameter is assumed to be @xmath70 . in section [ sec:6 ] on the base of monte carlo simulation we find a mean collision frequency @xmath71 , so graphics on figures [ fig:2 ] and [ fig:3 ]",
    "are plotted in assumptions @xmath72 .",
    "also , to be more specific , we assume @xmath73 .",
    "the dependencies of the direct current on a constant component of electric field @xmath74 are similar ones presented on figures [ fig:2 ] and [ fig:3 ] , and they are shown in section [ sec:6 ] , where the results of the constant collision frequency approach and the monte carlo modelling are compared . in a low - amplitude area of electric field",
    "the direct current density is linear with respect to each component @xmath53 , @xmath57 , @xmath74 .",
    "this result is in according with the same obtained previously in similar problem geometry in graphene analytically @xcite and by monte carlo simulation @xcite .",
    "the effect is cubic by magnitudes of electric field strengths which is closely related to mutual influence of charge carriers motions in transverse each other directions in material with non - additive energy spectrum .",
    "a non - monotonic character of a direct current density dependence on the components of the electric field can be explained that the effect is result of a mutual interaction of three motions ( under the influence of two alternative and one constant forces ) .",
    "so if one of the forces became much more than two another , the effect decreased .",
    "another cause of decreasing of the direct current with rising of one component of the electric field is that in the states where an electron has small values of quasi - momentum , a term in the energy spectrum , linear with respect to a quasi - momentum , prevails over the quadratic term , and a non - additivity of the energy spectrum is significant . with rising of a mean value of a quasi - momentum a relative contribution of the linear term",
    "is reduced , an influence of the energy spectrum non - additivity decreases and the direct component of a transverse current also diminishes .",
    "the dependencies of the direct current density on a phase shift between the components of wave is very close to cosine ( fig .",
    "[ fig:4 ] ) . with growth of a collisional frequency",
    "the direct current component monotonically decreases .",
    "consequently , on the base of examination of boltzmann kinetic equation with the collision term in a form of constant relaxation frequency we calculate a direct current density ( in perpendicular direction to a constant component of electric field strength ) in material with rashba hamiltonian under the influence of elliptically polarized electromagnetic wave , which is incident normally to the surface of the sample .",
    "this approach allows us to get the dependence of direct current on components of electric field , collision frequency and phase shift between the components of elliptically polarized wave .",
    "it is established that essential contribution in effect appearance belongs to energy spectrum non - additivity . but",
    "the method of constant relaxation time ca nt immediately take in account microscopic mechanisms of charge carriers collisions on the lattice heterogeneity .",
    "meanwhile , only a non - additivity ca nt lead to appearance a preferential direction in a sample .",
    "direct current should arise as result of momentum and energy interchange between electron gas and lattice under the influence of electric field .",
    "next sections are devoted to clarification of relative influence of different types of scattering on appearance of direct current on the base of semi - classical monte carlo simulations .",
    "let us to watch over an electron which moves in electric field and is capable to be scattered by lattice irregularities .",
    "we assume that during the intervals between collisions the particle motion obeys the laws of classical mechanics and is described by the equations of motion @xmath75 the time intervals between collisions and the final momentum acquired by the particle after the collision , we model by the random variable , the distribution of which will be determined by the probabilities of transition from one state to another as a result of scattering .",
    "the transition probabilities are calculated from quantum mechanical considerations .",
    "calculating the momentum component for single electron at each point of time ( taking into consideration the motion in electric field and scattering ) , we calculate the electron velocity in each point of time . repeating many times similar calculations for different initial conditions ( one might say , for different particles ) , and performing an averaging across the set of initial conditions and with respect to a time",
    ", we obtain an expression for the mean velocity , and then , using ( [ eq : eq3 ] ) , we calculate a direct current density .",
    "as it was shown by simulation @xcite and as it follows from physical reasons , an inelastic scattering should play a key role in causing of transverse rectification effects .",
    "an energy exchange between the lattice and electron gas leads to demonstration of the mutual dependence of charge carriers movements in directions perpendicular to each other , potentially inherent in the materials with non - additive energy spectrum .",
    "that is why during the farther consideration of effect of direct current appearance in material with rashba hamiltonian under the conditions of elliptically polarized electromagnetic wave we shall take in account two mechanisms : scattering of charge carriers on optical phonons ( substantially inelastic ) and scattering on acoustical phonons ( which is close to elastic scattering ) .",
    "we shall need the expressions of total transition probability @xmath76 from the state with momentum @xmath77 to the state with any another allowable momentum value .",
    "the sect .",
    "[ sec:6 ]   is devoted to calculation of these probabilities .",
    "this section describes the considerations , on the base of which the time of electron scattering on phonons is modelled and the scattering mechanism is chosen .    a mean free time can be found by the next considerations set forth , for example , in @xcite .",
    "suppose , first , that the probability of an electron scattering in a time interval is proportional to the interval , and , second , the probability of collisions per unit time is independent of time .",
    "let @xmath78 is a probability that a particle moving without collisions over a period of time @xmath79 .",
    "consider the event @xmath80 , consisting in the fact that electrons move without scattering in the interval @xmath81 .",
    "this event can be considered as a combination of two events : the event @xmath82 , which consists in the fact that the electron moves without scattering over a period of time @xmath83 , and the event @xmath84 consisting in the fact that the electron is moving without being scattered in time interval @xmath85 . since we assume that the probability of the free motion of a particle depends on the duration of the period of time , but not on the initial ( or final ) point of time , the events @xmath82 and @xmath84 are independent , so @xmath86 on the other hand , @xmath87 the probability of free movement for the time @xmath88 can be expressed by the scattering probability @xmath89 for the same time : @xmath90 for @xmath91 one obtains next equation : @xmath92 the solution of this equation is a function @xmath93 where the constant @xmath82 is determined by the normalization condition @xmath94 thus , the probability that an electron will move without scattering within the time @xmath83 @xmath95 there @xmath89 is a total probability of charge carriers scattering per unit time .",
    "this probability depends primarily on the electron quasi - momentum : @xmath96 .",
    "the quantity @xmath97 in the exponent , in fact , is the probability of charge carriers scattering in the time interval duration @xmath51 .",
    "when the sample is placed in an electric field , an electron moves between collisions according to the equation of motion ( [ eq : eq23 ] ) , so that the momentum ( and the probability of scattering ) begins to depend on the time .",
    "generalization of ( [ eq : eq30 ] ) in this case is to replace @xmath98 ( @xmath99 is a vector - potential ) , @xmath100 so the probability that an electron will not experience a collision during a period @xmath51 when it moves under the influence of the external field is @xmath101 expression ( [ eq : eq33 ] ) can be used for drawing the time between successive scatterings .",
    "we assign to @xmath91 a value @xmath102 uniformly distributed in the interval @xmath103 .",
    "then the time @xmath51 of motion of an electron under the influence of fields between two successive collisions can be determined by solving the equation @xmath104 solving of ( [ eq : eq34 ] ) is a complex process . therefore , to simplify the calculations , we use techniques developed in @xcite . we introduce a fictitious self - scattering process , which does not change the momentum of a particle @xcite .",
    "let the probability of transition between the states @xmath77 and @xmath105 as a result of this process @xmath106 value @xmath107 in ( [ eq : eq35 ] ) can be chosen arbitrarily , since the state of the particle as a result of self - scattering does not change",
    ". in ( [ eq : eq34 ] ) @xmath76 is the probability of scattering due to all the processes taken into consideration . then , with the introduction of self - scattering , ( [ eq : eq34 ] ) takes a form : @xmath108 considering @xmath109 where @xmath110 is some constant , we obtain the condition for the determination of the collision moment in the form of @xmath111 the value @xmath110 should be chosen in such a way that in the region of interest values of the momentum the value @xmath107 was positive .",
    "there is another approach to the calculation of the mean free time @xcite .",
    "as before , we assume that the probability of scattering particles in the time interval @xmath79 is proportional to the length of this interval : @xmath112 here @xmath89 is the probability of charge carriers scattering per unit time .",
    "let the random variable @xmath102 is a time of free path .",
    "we introduce the distribution function of this value @xmath113  the probability that the time of free path @xmath114 is less than @xmath51 : @xmath115 then the probability of the event @xmath80 , consisting in the fact that the time of free path is in between @xmath116 , will be equal @xmath117 on the other hand , the event @xmath80 can be represented as a superposition of two events : @xmath82  `` the particle is moving without scattering over a period of time @xmath118 '' and @xmath84  `` particle scatters in @xmath116 '' .",
    "these events are independent .",
    "an independence of event @xmath82 on the event @xmath84 is unquestioned .",
    "an independence of event @xmath84 on @xmath82 is clear from the following .",
    "the fact that the scattering of particles is occurred in the interval @xmath116 ( event @xmath84 ) by our assumption depends on the length of the interval @xmath88 and on the state of the particles ( primarily , on its quasi - momentum ) .",
    "electron scattering probability per unit time @xmath89 depends on the quasi - momentum of particle , which in the case of external fields applying is a function of time , but there is no explicit dependence of the probability on the time measured from the previous collision , so there is no explicit dependence of the event @xmath84 on the initial time point of interval @xmath116 , and , hence , there is no the dependence of the event @xmath84 on the event @xmath82 .",
    "therefore the probability of an event @xmath80 can be represented as a product of probabilities of the events @xmath82 and @xmath84 : @xmath119 obviously , the probability of event @xmath82 is a complementary quantity for @xmath113 : @xmath120 the probability of event @xmath84 is defined by ( [ eq : eq38 ] ) . combining ( [ eq : eq38 ] ) , ( [ eq : eq40 ] ) , ( [ eq : eq41 ] ) , ( [ eq : eq42 ] ) , we obtain the following relationship : @xmath121 thus , the distribution function of the time of free path satisfy the differential equation @xmath122 a solution of that equation in case of @xmath123 takes a form : @xmath124 in modelling the expression ( [ eq : eq45 ] ) can be used to determine the time of free path , assuming @xmath113 is equal to uniformly distributed on the interval @xmath125 random variable @xmath102 .",
    "thus , the time of free path is determined by solving the equation @xmath126 the expression ( [ eq : eq46 ] ) is more preferable then the expressions ( [ eq : eq34 ] ) , ( [ eq : eq37 ] ) , since during the derivation of ( [ eq : eq34 ] ) we first assumed @xmath89 was independent on time , and then we generalized ( [ eq : eq30 ] ) ( not so strict ) for the case of an implicit dependency of the scattering probability @xmath127 on time . the expression ( [ eq : eq37 ] ) takes into account the dependence of the time of free path on the scattering probability only indirectly . for practical calculations",
    "it is convenient to transform the expression ( [ eq : eq45 ] ) : @xmath128 left part in ( 42 ) is the probability of the fact that the time of free path is greater than @xmath51 , and this probability one can simulate by a uniformly distributed random variable @xmath129 : @xmath130 in a right part of ( 42  ) under the exponent integral is taken numerically ( trapezoidal method ) : @xmath131 where @xmath132 is a time step ( we have omitted the quote in the designation of uniformly distributed random variable ) . since a right part of ( [ eq : eq49 ] ) is a monotonous decreasing function , we find a time of free path according to @xmath133 where @xmath13 is minimal number of steps required to satisfy the condition @xmath134 taking the logarithm of both sides of ( [ eq : eq51 ] ) , one gets following condition @xmath135 which is used in this paper to perform calculations .    playing a random variable @xmath102 uniformly distributed in the interval @xmath136",
    "$ ] , we find a moment of collision using ( [ eq : eq52 ] ) .",
    "then one should select the scattering mechanism .",
    "thereto one more random variable @xmath137 , uniformly distributed in the interval @xmath136 $ ] , is played out . in a case when only two mechanisms of scattering are supposed ( scattering by acoustic and optical phonons ) , the choice of the scattering mechanism is based on the next obvious condition : one assumes that scattering was happened by optical phonon , if @xmath138 and one assumes that electron was scattered by acoustic vibrations of the lattice in a case if @xmath139 defining the scattering mechanism , we calculate the momentum after the collision on the base of the laws of conservation of energy and momentum , further we estimate the velocity at any time during the motion of an electron in an external field and define a new collision moment .",
    "let us to consider a probability of the electron transition from the state with a quasi - momentum @xmath77 to the state @xmath105@xcite : @xmath140 here @xmath141 - is the operator of electron - phonon interaction ( it depends on type of phonons ) , matrix element @xmath142 is taken on wave function of a system `` electron + phonons '' , @xmath13 is a number of phonons in a chosen state , @xmath143 is an energy of the system `` electron + phonons '' in this state .",
    "the operator of electron - phonon interaction takes a form @xcite @xmath144 where @xmath145 and @xmath146 are , respectively , birth and delete operators of phonon with a branch number @xmath137 and a quasi - momentum vector @xmath147 .",
    "wave function @xmath148 relates to a system of non - interacting electron and phonon gases , so it can be presented in a form of the product @xmath149 here @xmath150 - is an electron wave function , @xmath151 - is a phonon wave function which is equal to a wave function of harmonic oscillator .",
    "so the expression of matrix element can be presented as @xmath152 here @xmath153    in a case of a quadratic dispersion law , with regard to only long - wavelength lattice vibrations , one can take the electron wave function in a form of plane wave @xmath154    matrix element ( [ eq : eq58 ] ) , taken on this function , is well - known and it is presented in , for example , in @xcite . in material , which is described by rashba hamiltonian , the electron wave function is given by the next expression ( in long - wavelength approximation too ) @xcite : @xmath155 @xmath156 is an angle between the components of quasi - momentum .",
    "we chose a top subband , so the wave function becomes the next : @xmath157 consequently , the expression of a scattering probability should differ from the expression , depicted in @xcite , only by values of integrals ( [ eq : eq59 ] ) .",
    "after simple transformations one can obtain : @xmath158 where @xmath159 - is a matrix element , taken on plane waves ( [ eq : eq060 ] ) .",
    "so a square of the matrix element , immediately incoming into ( [ eq : eq55 ] ) , is @xmath160 in our subsequent investigations ( during the calculation of probability of electron transition from the state @xmath77 to every possible states with quasi - momentum @xmath161 ) we shall assume @xmath10 axis directed along the vector @xmath77 , so angle difference @xmath162 should be equal to polar angle @xmath163 : @xmath164 .",
    "thus , formulae of scattering probability in a case of calculation of matrix elements on eigenfunctions of rashba hamiltonian should differ from that , calculated on plane waves , only by coefficient @xmath165 ( taking into account , of course , that we consider the two - dimensional problem ) .",
    "general expression for charge carriers probability takes a form : @xmath166 in this expression @xmath167 is a constant of electron - phonon interaction , @xmath168 is a cyclic frequency of phonon , @xmath169 is a surface density of material , coefficient @xmath170 corresponds to a potential of deformation , it depends on type of phonons ( we taking in account only nonpolar acoustical and optical phonons ) , @xmath171 is a phonon distribution function , @xmath172 is an energy of electron ( in our case it described by ( [ eq : eq2 ] ) ) . because of we are interesting in motion of electrons under the influence of comparatively weak electric fields and temperatures , we shall assume phonon distribution to be close to equilibrium , so @xmath171 can be described by plank function : @xmath173 .",
    "note , that similar to ( [ eq : eq64 ] ) expression of charge carriers probability on nonpolar phonons in two - dimensional material with linear on quasi - momentum term in energy spectrum was derived in @xcite ( for the case of graphene ) .      at temperatures",
    "less or equal to @xmath174 an acoustical phonon energy is much less than representative energies of electron in initial and finishing states and energy of thermal motion : @xmath175 .",

    "is @xmath180 . consider a unit as negligible compared to @xmath181 in the second term of ( [ eq : eq64 ] ) , we obtain an expression for the probability of electron scattering by acoustic phonons in the following form : @xmath182    to find a total probability @xmath76 of electron scattering by phonons with the momentum of @xmath77 on one of the acoustic branches one should integrate ( [ eq : eq65 ] ) over the final momentum @xmath105 , as well as the configuration space : @xmath183 going over in a polar coordinate system in momentum space and substituting the explicit expression of the energy spectrum ( [ eq : eq2 ] ) , we obtain the following expression for the total probability : @xmath184 using the rule ( see , for example , @xcite ) @xmath185=\\dfrac{1}{|\\partial f/\\partial x|}\\delta(x - x_0),\\ ] ] where @xmath186 is defined by condition @xmath187 , one obtains @xmath188 the final expression for the total probability of electron scattering by acoustic phonons becomes a form : @xmath189 the scattering of electrons by acoustic phonons is assumed to be elastic , i. e. the absolute value of the momentum is unchanged . during the modelling the recalculation of projections of momentum is performed , for which purpose the values of an angle @xmath163 are raffled off .",
