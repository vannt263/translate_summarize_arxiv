    "the @xmath8 has played a celebrated role in particle physics .",
    "its discovery  @xcite in 1964 confirmed its prediction  @xcite as the missing member of the spin-@xmath9 baryon decuplet .",
    "however , the prediction of its spin has not yet been unambiguously verified : we can only say with certainty that it is not spin-@xmath10  @xcite .",
    "if we assume that the @xmath8 is spin-@xmath9 ( as we shall throughout this paper ) , parity violation in weak interactions allows the final state in the @xmath1 decay to contain a mixture of @xmath11 and @xmath12 waves .",
    "the relative admixture of these angular - momentum states is poorly known .",
    "previous experiments have established that @xmath6 , defined as @xmath13 is small , if not zero , the world average being @xmath14  @xcite .",
    "theory predicts the @xmath1 decay to be predominately parity conserving  @xcite and hence dominated by the @xmath11-wave final state , consistent with this small value .    in the decay of an unpolarized @xmath8 hyperon , the daughter @xmath15 is produced with a longitudinal polarization  @xcite , which leads to an asymmetry in the @xmath3 decay . in this case the angular distribution of the proton is @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the total number of events",
    ", @xmath5 is the decay parameter of the @xmath3 decay , and @xmath18 is the polar angle of the proton momentum in that @xmath15 rest frame whose polar axis is the direction of the @xmath15 momentum in the @xmath8 rest frame ( the  lambda helicity frame \" shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) . since the polar ( @xmath19 ) axis in the lambda helicity frame changes direction from event to event",
    ", there is little correlation between @xmath18 and any particular region in the laboratory frame , greatly reducing many sources of bias .",
    "we here report a precise determination of @xmath6 for the @xmath1 decay with a sample of 0.96 million unpolarized @xmath1 events which is some two orders of magnitude larger than those of previous experiments .",
    "the data used in this analysis were taken in the 1997 fixed - target run at fermilab using the hypercp spectrometer  @xcite ( fig .  [ fig2 ] ) .",
    "this was a high - rate spectrometer designed to perform a sensitive search for _ cp _ violation in charged-@xmath20 and @xmath15 decays , as well as searches for rare or forbidden hyperon and kaon decays .",
    "the @xmath8 hyperons were produced as follows .",
    "an 800gev/@xmath21 proton beam , incident at zero degrees , was steered onto a 6-cm - long , @xmath22@xmath23 copper target situated in front of a 6.096-m - long curved collimator located within a dipole magnet ( the hyperon magnet of fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) producing a 1.667 t field .",
    "typically @xmath24 protons per second were delivered onto the target in 19s spills occurring once per minute ; this produced a 13mhz secondary beam exiting the collimator .",
    "the zero - degree incident angle dictated , through parity conservation in the strong interaction , that the @xmath8 s were produced unpolarized .",
    "the hyperon magnet deflected negatively charged particles at the nominal secondary - beam momentum upward at a 19.5mrad angle ; here  up \" is the @xmath25 direction , the charged secondary beam moves in the @xmath26 direction , and  beam - left \" is the @xmath27 direction , so that the @xmath28 , @xmath29 , and @xmath30 axes form a right - handed coordinate system .",
    "the defining apertures of the collimator limited the momentum range of the secondary beam to about @xmath31gev/@xmath21 , with an average momentum of about 160gev/@xmath21 . immediately following",
    "the hyperon magnet was a 13-m - long evacuated pipe ( vacuum decay region ) , which defined the allowed decay region of the @xmath8 .",
    "following the vacuum decay region was a magnetic spectrometer used to measure the momenta of the @xmath32 , @xmath33 , and @xmath34 from the @xmath8 and @xmath15 decays .",
    "it was composed of high - rate , narrow - pitch , multiwire proportional chambers ( mwpcs ) , four ( c1c4 ) located in front of the analyzing magnets and four behind ( c5c8 ) .",
    "each chamber had four anode planes , two with vertical wires ( @xmath35 view ) and two with wires angled at @xmath36 to the vertical ( @xmath37 and @xmath38 views ) .",
    "the wire pitch increased with distance from the target , with c1 and c2 at 1 mm , c3 and c4 at 1.25 mm , c5 and c6 at 1.5 mm , and c7 and c8 at 2.0 mm .",
    "the analyzing magnets were two dipole magnets placed back to back .",
    "they had a combined field integral of 4.73tm .",
    "negatively charged particles were deflected in the @xmath27 direction .",
    "[ htbp ]     toward the rear of the spectrometer were the trigger elements .",
    "these included two scintillation - counter hodoscopes , both positioned outside of the envelope of the intense secondary beam emanating from the collimator .",
    "one ( same - sign hodoscope ) was on the side of the spectrometer to which particles with charge of the same ( ss ) sign as the secondary beam were deflected , and the other ( opposite - sign hodoscope ) was on the side to which particles of the opposite charge sign ( os ) were deflected .",
    "the ss hodoscope was used to detect the presence of the kaon or pion from the @xmath1 , @xmath3 decay sequence , while the os hodoscope was used to detect the proton from the @xmath15 decay . behind",
    "the os hodoscope was the hadronic calorimeter , used to measure the energy of the proton .",
    "the trigger used to select events for this analysis ( called the cas trigger ) was designed to pick out candidate @xmath3 decays and required the coincidence of at least one charged particle in each of the ss and os hodoscopes and a minimum energy of approximately 40gev in the hadronic calorimeter .",
    "( the muon detector system at the rear of the apparatus was not used in this analysis . )",
    "the 39 billion cas triggers recorded in the 1997 run were reconstructed with a program that found all of the tracks in the event .",
    "events with fewer than three good tracks outside of the secondary - beam envelope , as well as those with no opposite - sign track , were discarded . for each remaining event ,",
    "every possible combination of ss and os tracks was used to form a @xmath39 invariant mass , with the assumption that the ss track was a pion and the os track a proton . the ss  os track pair with @xmath39 mass closest to the @xmath15 mass was tagged .",
    "the tagged pair was then combined with the remaining ss tracks , and the three - track invariant mass was determined assuming a @xmath40 hypothesis .",
    "the combination with @xmath40 mass closest to the @xmath8 mass was tagged .",
    "a geometric fit of the three tagged tracks then determined whether their topology was consistent with a two - vertex , three - track hypothesis , with the proton and pion tracks forming one of the vertices .",
    "tight event - selection cuts were applied to produce as clean an @xmath8 sample as possible .",
    "these cuts required ( 1 ) that the @xmath41 per degree of freedom of the geometric fit be less than 2.5 ; ( 2 ) that the @xmath39 invariant mass be consistent with that of a @xmath15 ( @xmath42gev/@xmath43 ) ; ( 3 ) that the three tracks not have an invariant mass consistent with a @xmath44 decay ( @xmath45gev/@xmath43 ) ; ( 4 ) that the @xmath46 invariant mass be less than 0.48gev/@xmath43 or greater than 0.51gev/@xmath43 to remove potential @xmath47 contamination ; ( 5 ) that the @xmath15 ( @xmath8 ) decay vertex be at least 0.40 m ( 0.60 m ) and less than 13 m downstream of the exit of the collimator ; ( 6 ) that the reconstructed @xmath8 track at the exit of the collimator be at most 8.0 mm ( 5.5 mm ) from the center of the collimator exit aperture in @xmath28 ( @xmath29 ) ; and ( 7 ) that the @xmath8 track extrapolated back to the target be at most 2.5 mm ( 3 mm ) from the target center in @xmath28 ( @xmath29 ) .",
    "loose cuts on the momenta of the various particles were also applied ( with one exception described next ) .",
    "in addition to these cuts two more cuts were applied to improve the agreement between the data and the hybrid monte carlo simulation ( described below ) by eliminating events populating regions in which the hybrid monte carlo distributions matched the data poorly .",
    "these required that the separation of the @xmath32 and @xmath34 tracks at chamber c4 exceed 2.0 cm in each of the three views , and that the @xmath34 momentum exceed 21.5gev/@xmath21 .    the @xmath40 invariant - mass distribution of the events passing these cuts is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] with a third - order polynomial fit to the background superimposed .",
    "the mass resolution , @xmath48mev/@xmath43 , is consistent with that obtained with monte carlo simulation .",
    "a total of 0.96million events lie between 1.6647 and 1.6807 gev/@xmath43 , that is , within @xmath49 of the central value of the @xmath40 mass ( 1.6728gev/@xmath43 ) .",

    "in order to extract @xmath6 , the slope of the proton @xmath50 distribution , @xmath51 , in the lambda helicity frame was measured and that of the @xmath50 distribution of the background , @xmath52 , subtracted to find @xmath53 .",
    "the effect of the acceptance on the @xmath50 distribution was accounted for using a hybrid monte carlo ( hmc ) technique  @xcite as follows .",
    "each real candidate @xmath8 event was read in by the hmc program , and the @xmath50 value of its proton was determined and stored .",
    "monte carlo events were then generated by taking all of the parameters from the real event except the momenta of the proton and pion .",
    "new proton and pion momenta were generated in the lambda helicity frame with an isotropic distribution and then lorentz - boosted into the laboratory frame .",
    "the hmc - generated proton and pion tracks were then traced through a software model of the spectrometer and required to pass the same trigger and event - topology requirements as the real data .",
    "for every real event ten accepted hmc events were required .",
    "if after two hundred tries , ten hmc events were not accepted ( a rarity given the large acceptance of the spectrometer ) , the real and hmc events were discarded .",
    "accepted hmc events were weighted by the function @xmath54,\\label{eq3}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath55 is the polar angle of the real proton and @xmath56 are those of the associated hmc protons . as indicated in eq .",
    "[ eq3 ] , the series expansion of the weight function in powers of @xmath57 allowed it to be written as a third - degree polynomial in the unknown slope @xmath51 , with the coefficients of the polynomial stored for each bin of hmc - proton @xmath58 .",
    "after processing all of the real @xmath8 events in this manner , a @xmath41 comparison between the real - proton and hmc - proton @xmath50 distributions was performed and the value of the slope @xmath51 that minimized the @xmath41 was found .",
    "this value was corrected for background as described below to give the final value of @xmath53 .",
    "the analysis procedure was extensively tested on monte carlo events .",
    "seven monte carlo samples were generated , each with one million accepted events , with @xmath6 values of @xmath59 , @xmath60 , @xmath61 , and 0.0 .",
    "the average difference between the input and hmc - determined @xmath53 values was found to be @xmath62 ; this offset was accounted for when the final result was extracted .",
    "the difference was independent of the input value .",
    "for the selected sample of 0.96 million @xmath1 events , the extracted value of the slope of the @xmath50 distribution was @xmath63 , where the error is statistical and includes the hmc statistical error .",
    "the hmc @xmath50 distribution of the proton weighted by the best - fit value of @xmath51 and the distribution of the real data are shown in fig .",
    "the @xmath41 of the hmc fit was 30.2 for 19 degrees of freedom .",
    "to extract @xmath53 , the contribution of the background under the @xmath8 mass peak was subtracted as follows .",
    "sidebands outside of the @xmath40 mass range used to measure @xmath51 were analyzed as described above to determine the slope of the @xmath50 distribution of their protons , @xmath52 .",
    "the lower sideband range was @xmath64gev/@xmath43 and the upper sideband range was @xmath65gev/@xmath43 .",
    "each sideband was subdivided into three bins in @xmath40 mass .",
    "the extracted slopes of the proton @xmath50 distributions for the sideband data sets were consistent with each other .",
    "a hmc fit to all of the background samples gave @xmath66 , considerably larger than that found in the signal region . using @xmath52 thus determined as the slope of the proton @xmath50 distribution for the background events under the @xmath8 mass peak , @xmath53 was extracted from @xmath51 to give @xmath67 , where the error is statistical .",

    "a run - by - run determination of @xmath53 found no significant variation .",
    "the value of @xmath53 was also measured as a function of the momentum of the @xmath8 and the position of the @xmath8 decay vertex .",
    "no significant dependences were found .",
    "we have investigated the potential systematic uncertainties related to event selection , performance of the spectrometer , and modeling of the background under the @xmath8 mass peak .",
    "the extracted value of @xmath53 was insensitive to variations in the minimum-@xmath34-momentum requirement by up to @xmath68gev/@xmath21 , and on the separation between the @xmath32 and @xmath34 tracks at c4 by up to @xmath68 cm in each view .",
    "the uncertainty in the amount of background under the @xmath8 peak within the @xmath40 mass window was estimated by performing first - degree and second - degree polynomial fits to the background .",

    "the uncertainty in @xmath52 led to a systematic error of 0.0003 in @xmath53 .",

    ", we found a systematic error of @xmath69 in @xmath53 .    to obtain the final result in @xmath53 we corrected the background - subtracted value with the offset observed in the validation of the hmc procedure and arrived at the value @xmath70\\times 10^{-2}$ ] , where the systematic error is the quadrature sum of the systematic uncertainties due to validation of the hmc ( 0.0014 ) , background subtraction ( 0.0003 ) , and calorimeter efficiency ( 0.0050 ) .",
