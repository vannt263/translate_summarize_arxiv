    "quantum entangled photons , owing to their unique properties , play a crucial role in the implementation of quantum information protocols , quantum teleportation  @xcite , and quantum computing  @xcite .",
    "the entanglement of photons can be exhibited in terms of their polarization which is intrinsically binary , or spatial and spectral degrees of freedom which are continuous variables .",
    "an important class of entangled photon states is noon states or path - entangled states , defined as:@xmath0which is the coherent superposition of _ n _ photons in two different spatial modes _ a _ and _ b_. nowadays , such noon states are being exploited to beat the classical rayleigh diffraction limit and thus , believed to find potential applications in quantum metrology , imaging and lithographic techniques  @xcite .",
    "spontaneous parametric down conversion ( spdc ) process in second order @xmath1 nonlinear bulk crystals and waveguides is a well established method for the generation of polarization entangled  @xcite and time - bin entangled photons  @xcite .",
    "the use of waveguide structures leads to enhanced nonlinear efficiencies due to tight confinement of the interacting waves and in addition , provides a means to control the spatial characteristics of the down converted photons by confining them to well defined discrete transverse spatial modes  @xcite .",
    "this is in contrast to the continuous spatial distribution governed by momentum conservation in bulk crystals . by restricting the modes of the waveguide structure to the two lowest order modes , the mode number can serve as a modal qubit  @xcite , which can be used as an alternative to polarization qubit .",
    "the guided - wave downconverted photon pairs can thus be emitted in the two allowed modes leading to modal entanglement .",
    "such waveguide structures are also compatible with integrated optics technology and form basic components in photonic circuit designs , which are expected to play an important role in quantum information technology , owing to the compactness of the device and low loss .",
    "the generation , separation and processing of entangled photons can be carried out on a single chip and hence , the entangled photon state is less susceptible to decoherence .",
    "the photonic circuits based on titanium indiffused channel ln waveguides have also been recently investigated for different combinations of modal , spectral and polarization entangled photon pairs  @xcite .    in this paper , we address the issue of generation of a modal - path entangled state using spdc in a domain engineered integrated optical waveguide device .",
    "several schemes have been proposed over the years to generate two photon and multiphoton path entanglement using spdc process with the use of interferometric set ups consisting of polarization beam splitters ( pbs ) or mach zehnder interferometers ( mzi )  @xcite , cavity qed  @xcite .",
    "we propose a scheme for the generation of non - degenerate , co - polarized modal entangled state using a directional coupler in type 0 phase - matched doubly periodically polarized lithium niobate ( ln ) waveguide .",
    "the nonlinearity in ln is tailored in such a way that quasi phase matching ( qpm ) conditions for two different spdc processes are obeyed simultaneously  @xcite .",
    "these two spdc processes , when enabled together , lead to a mode entangled output state .",
    "we have shown through quantum mechanical analysis and numerical simulations , that for our choice of waveguide geometry and the modes , maximally mode entangled photon pairs can be achieved for a wide range of input parameters of the waveguide . using an asymmetric y - coupler at the output , it is then possible to convert the mode entangled state to a path entangled state .",
    "the use of the directional coupler in our scheme facilitates the choice of the modes required , which leads to an appreciable overlap of the fields at the pump , signal and idler wavelengths .",
    "the overlap integrals , which primarily determine the down conversion efficiency , are quite high in comparison to a two mode waveguide , giving rise to a high photon pair generation rate . also , due to the design of the structure , we show that an efficient generation of photon pairs is possible using the fundamental spatial mode of the pump as compared to the earlier work in which the first excited spatial mode had to be chosen in order to achieve good efficiencies  @xcite .",

    "we conclude with a brief summary in sec .",
    "[ conclusion ] .",
    "we seek to generate a mode entangled state using spontaneous parametric down conversion process in which the signal and idler photons get generated in an entangled pair of modes .",
    "once generated , such a mode- entangled state can be converted to a path - entangled state , such that , if one of the down converted photons comes out of one of the two ( or more ) available paths , the other photon ( generated with the first photon ) would also come out of the same path and similarly for the other path(s ) . in order to achieve this",
    ", we consider a waveguide geometry as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_wavegeom ] .",
    "region i is a single mode waveguide at the pump wavelength , followed by region ii consisting of a symmetric y - splitter .",
    "region iii is a directional coupler supporting the fundamental ( symmetric ) normal mode and the first excited ( antisymmetric ) normal mode at signal and idler wavelengths . using an appropriate phase matching in the directional coupler region , it is possible to generate down converted photons which are entangled in mode number .",
    "the working of the proposed device is as follows : when the fundamental mode at pump enters the input waveguide , it passes through the symmetric y - splitter and excites the fundamental symmetric normal mode at pump wavelength in the directional coupler ( region iii ) .",
    "the directional coupler region is assumed to have a doubly periodic domain reversal grating which simultaneously satisfies the quasi phase matching ( qpm ) conditions  @xcite for the following two different spdc processes : pump photon in the fundamental normal spatial mode down converting either a ) both in the fundamental normal spatial mode or b ) both in the first excited normal spatial mode . the substrate used in this region",
    "is assumed to be a domain engineered ln substrate which results in type 0 phase matched down conversion .",
    "we show in sec .",
    "[ analysis ] , that when the qpm conditions for both the spdc processes are satisfied simultaneously , it will lead to the generation of a mode entangled signal - idler photon pair in the doubly reversed region .",
    "thus , in contrast to the standard phase matching based on a single process either in the bulk or in the waveguide configuration , domain engineering can lead to the direct production of co - polarized mode - entangled state without the need for an interferometric set up or a 50:50 beam splitter .    to convert the mode - entangled state to a path - entangled state , at",

    "thus the fundamental normal modes of signal and idler exit from the upper waveguide while the first excited normal modes exit from the lower waveguide leading to a path - entangled state . we show through numerical simulations",

    "we may mention here that the above simulations have been carried out using a titanium indiffused waveguide ; simulations can also be performed for proton exchange ( pe ) ln waveguides which may further increase the efficiencies due to tighter confinement of modes .",

    "in this paper , we have addressed the issue of generation of mode entangled photon pairs using optical waveguide geometry which has the inherent advantage of being compact ( making the photons less susceptible to decoherence ) and having enhanced optical non linearities in comparison to bulk crystal or optical fibers .",
    "the proposed scheme is very efficient as the pump , signal and idler are taken to be all extraordinarily polarized , making use of the highest non linear coefficient @xmath2 of lithium niobate , and due to our choice of the geometry and the modes , the overlap integrals determining the efficiency of the two processes are also significant .",
    "we have shown that a maximally entangled state is achievable for a wide range of core separation of the coupler , with the additional advantage that one of the entangled photons is emitted at the typical wavelength of 1550 nm and can be used as a flying qubit .",
    "this mode entangled state can further be converted to a path entangled state which should have varied applications in quantum lithography and quantum information processing .",
    "the proposal when extended to degenerate spdc processes would lead to the production of a noon state with _",
