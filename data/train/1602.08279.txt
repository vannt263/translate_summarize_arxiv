    "schaeffer in 1952 . in 1980 s frames begun to play an important role in wavelet and gabor analysis . since then , frames are an important tool in both theoretical and applied mathematics .",
    "frames have found a number of applications due to the inbuilt redundancy which provides resilience to noise and coefficient erasures . among them , frames for which @xmath4 in  , called _ parseval frames _ , have proved to be most useful since they provide the same simple reconstruction formula as orthonormal bases , but with the added benefit of having redundancy .",
    "explicitly , if @xmath1 is a parseval frame , then @xmath5 the _ frame operator _",
    "@xmath6 is defined as @xmath7 .",
    "it is positive and invertible and from the equality @xmath8 we can easily get that @xmath9 is a parseval frame , a fact which we will use in the rest of the paper . for more details on frame theory",
    "we refer to the book  @xcite or the survey article  @xcite .    in @xcite ,",
    "an algorithm was devised which generates parseval frames using a generalization of the gram ",
    "schmidt orthogonalization procedure ( or ggsp for short ) . for a given frame @xmath1 , the algorithm produces a parseval frame @xmath10 in the following manner :",
    "the first vector @xmath11 is simply the normalized vector @xmath12 as in the first step of the ordinary gram ",
    "schmidt algorithm .",
    "if @xmath13 , then @xmath14 is derived from the ordinary gram ",
    "schmidt step .",
    "if , on the other hand , @xmath15 is linearly dependent on the previous vectors , then @xmath16 is the parseval frame @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the frame operator of the frame @xmath19 . in this step",
    "the previously generated vectors @xmath20 have to be adjusted using the vector @xmath15 .",
    "an important feature of this construction is that in each step @xmath21 we get a parseval frame for @xmath22 .",

    "we refer the reader to  @xcite for details on the algorithm and some of its properties .",
    "the objective of this paper is to further investigate the algorithm with an emphasis on the iterations of the algorithm .",
    "iterative algorithms are often employed in applications and in frame theory some notable examples of iterative procedures include the frame algorithm ( @xcite ) and the gradient descent of the frame potential used for construction of approximate unit - norm tight frames ( @xcite ) . we are inspired here by these algorithms to study the limit case of the iterated ggsp .",
    "we will end this section by introducing a term that will be important in the rest of the paper .",
    "we say that a sequence of vectors @xmath25 in a hilbert space @xmath0 is a _ zero extended orthonormal sequence _ if the sequence becomes orthonormal once we remove all the zero vectors .",
    "we say that @xmath25 is a _ zero extended orthonormal basis _ if the reduced sequence is an orthonormal basis .",
    "since we will be dealing with the iterations of ggsp with the limit case in mind , the first thing we would like to know is which frames remain unchanged under the application of ggsp .",
    "it turns out that that set is the same as for the ordinary gram ",
    "schmidt procedure .",
    "[ propstationaryggsp ] let @xmath25 be a frame for a hilbert space @xmath0 .",
    "the following statements are equivalent :    * @xmath26 , * @xmath25 is a zero extended orthonormal basis .",
    "if ( ii ) holds , ggsp becomes the ordinary gram - schmidt procedure ( leaving zero vectors unchanged ) so it does nt change the orthonormal basis .    if we assume ( i )",
    "is true , let @xmath27 be the greatest index ( if it exists ) for which @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "the @xmath21th vector can change only in the @xmath21th step of the algorithm .",
    "so we must have @xmath30 .",
    "taking norms of both sides , we get",
    "@xmath31 so @xmath15 has to be zero which is a contradiction .    therefore , @xmath32 is a linearly independent set",
    ". therefore @xmath33 ( @xmath34 ) .",
    "since ggsp for linearly independent sets is the regular gram - schmidt procedure , we have that @xmath35 is an orthonormal basis ( possibly with zeros ) .",
    "since we assumed @xmath26 , it follows that @xmath36 is an orthonormal basis for @xmath37 .",
    "next we will turn our attention to the iterations of the ggsp and describe the limit case with regards to the @xmath38norm .",
    "we denote by @xmath39 , the starting frame for @xmath0 .",
    "also , recursively we define the sequence @xmath40 and @xmath41 if the limit exists .",
    "notice that if the limit @xmath42 exists , it is also a parseval frame .",
    "we will also adopt the following notation : since the input vectors may change more than once during the application of ggsp , we will have to observe not just the final vectors , but also the vectors as they appear in each step .",
    "let us denote by @xmath43 the @xmath44th vector we get in the @xmath21th step of the @xmath45th iteration of ggsp .",
    "we immediately see that @xmath46 for all @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "there are two possibilities for the starting frame .",
    "either the last vector is in the span of the preceding vectors , or it is not .",
    "the next proposition shows that we only need consider the first case when we study the convergence of iterations because in the latter case the last vector stabilizes right after the first iteration and has no effect on the other vectors .",
    "[ proplaststabilizes ] if @xmath47 , then for all @xmath48 we have @xmath49 , where @xmath50 is the orthogonal projection onto @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",

    "after @xmath53 steps of the first iteration we get the vectors @xmath54 , @xmath55 , which form a parseval frame for its span . also , we have @xmath56 . now let s observe the @xmath57th step : @xmath58 where @xmath52 so that @xmath59 is a unit vector .",
    "now , in the same way , in the second iteration we get @xmath60 which is again a unit vector so we do nt need to normalize it . in each of the following iterations we will get the same vector .    the case",
    "when the last vector is linearly dependent upon the previous vectors is actually just a special case of a more general result which we give in the next theorem .",
    "[ tmlinzavisniunulu ] if @xmath61 , then @xmath62 converges to zero as @xmath45 tends to infinity .",
    "let us enumerate by @xmath63 all the indices such that @xmath64 .",
    "for an arbitrary index @xmath65 among them , in the first iteration and the @xmath65th step of ggsp we get the vector @xmath66 .",
    "if @xmath67 , the @xmath65th vector will later change , let s say that the first time it happens is in the @xmath21th step . the square of the new vector s norm will be :    @xmath68    since @xmath69 for some @xmath70 , then in this manner the @xmath65th vector will change in steps @xmath71 , @xmath72 , ",
    ", @xmath73 giving us vectors @xmath74 , ",
    ", @xmath75 , respectively . by the previous calculation",
    "we see that for all @xmath76 , @xmath77 , @xmath78 we have    @xmath79    in particular , since @xmath80 , in the @xmath71th step using the cauchy - schwarz inequality we get    @xmath81    the @xmath82th vector can change in this way a finite number of times ( @xmath83 times , to be exact ) and each time we get a decrease in norm as in  @xmath84 .",
    "in the end we will have a lower bound on the norm : @xmath85    on the other hand , the vector @xmath86 satisfies : @xmath87 we then have @xmath88 easy induction shows that @xmath89 therefore , @xmath90 .",
    "now , for a fixed @xmath91 we can find @xmath92 such that @xmath93 , @xmath94 .",
    "for any @xmath95 from   we get @xmath96 we see that @xmath97 also , using   we get that @xmath98 combining  @xmath99  and  @xmath100 we see that @xmath101 for some @xmath102 $ ] . using the last result we can easily see that @xmath103 holds for big enough @xmath104 . therefore , @xmath105 also .",
    "we would get that @xmath106 , for all @xmath107 , analogously using the estimate   and the parameters @xmath108 $ ] , for a suitable @xmath109 .",
    "observe that in no iterations will we get a zero vector if we did nt start with a zero vector , we can just get it in the limit case . using theorem  [ tmlinzavisniunulu ] we can now state our main result .",
    "[ tmmainresult ] the sequence @xmath110 has a convergent subsequence in the @xmath38norm for any choice of the starting sequence @xmath111 and its limit @xmath42 is a zero extended orthonormal basis for @xmath112 .",

    "first , let s observe that the square of the @xmath38norm of any parseval frame is equal to the dimension of the hilbert space .",
    "therefore , we have a sequence @xmath110 of parseval frames ( except possibly for the starting sequence which can be an arbitrary frame ) , that is , it is a sequence of elements on the sphere of radius @xmath115 in @xmath116 , where @xmath0 is a @xmath117dimensional hilbert space .",
    "an easy compactness argument gives us a subsequence which converges to a limit @xmath118 which is also a parseval frame .",
    "now we have a limit parseval frame @xmath42 for a @xmath117 dimensional space which has exactly @xmath119 zero vectors .",
    "it is known that such a sequence must be an orthonormal basis with @xmath119 zeros added .",
    "the limit zero extended orthonormal basis in the previous theorem can be reached in some iteration only if we already started with a zero extended orthonormal basis .",
    "otherwise , by proposition  @xmath120 , each iteration will yield a different parseval frame .",
    "even though the sequence of parseval frames produced by ggsp has a convergent subsequence for any starting frame , it is still unknown whether this sequence converges for any starting frame or , if it does nt , a complete characterization of those frames that cause it to converge still remains an open problem .",
