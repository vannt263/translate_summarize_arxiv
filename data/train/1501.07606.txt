    "long gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) are produced by ultra - relativistic jets launched after the collapse of massive stars .",

    "this paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    ", we give a general treatment of the eic emission ( spectrum and lightcurve ) when a jet interacts with an arbitrary epf . in section 3 ,",
    "we first give simple order - of - magnitude estimates of the total eic energy in the three cases , and then put the specific epfs into the general procedures and calculate the precise lightcurves and spectra . in section 4 , we discuss some potential issues , e.g. absorption of high energy @xmath5-rays by the cosmic background light or by the local epf itself . short conclusion is given in section 5 .",
    "in this section , we provide a general calculation for the lightcurve and spectrum expected for an observer on the jet axis , when a relativistic jet makes its way through an arbitrary external photon field ( epf ) .",

    "we refer the readers to for a general treatment on ic radiation . also , @xcite give a review of ic radiation in grb afterglows , including eic and synchrotron - self compton ( ssc ) radiation .",

    "suppose the volume element ( in fig.[fig : labframe ] ) contains @xmath104 electrons , the number of photons that are scattered into @xmath105 , in a time duration @xmath106 and frequency range @xmath107 , is @xmath108 where the optical depth @xmath109 describes the attenuation by the part of the jet that lies along the incident photons trajectory before they enter the jet volume element where the ic scattering is considered .",

    ". then , the @xmath118 in eq.([eq:41 ] ) needs to be multiplied by @xmath125 .",
    "next we include the effect of the conical shape of the jet ( `` curvature effect '' ) on the observed luminosity .",
    "when the jet front is at radius @xmath35 , the scattered photons from a volume element at a distance @xmath113 from the jet front and at latitude @xmath49 will arrive at observer s time @xmath126 .",

    "then in section [ lc_spectr ] , we present the eic lightcurves and spectra , with absorption from pair production ( with prompt @xmath5-rays ) considered . for simplicity , each case is considered separately in this paper , but in reality , different cases can operate simultaneously ( e.g. the grb progenitor is in a binary system and has a wind ) and the total eic emission will approximately be a superposition of them .        consider the grb progenitor star being in a binary system .",
    "soft photons from the companion star are scattered by the electrons in the relativistic jet .",
    "we assume the direction of the jet is perpendicular to the orbital plane from the normal direction of orbital plane , the total energy ( or luminosity ) will be affected by a factor of order unity ( @xmath135 ) . ] . as shown in fig.([fig : case1 ] ) , the jet is at a distance @xmath35 from the progenitor star ( a ) and is moving with lf @xmath34 in the z direction , and the companion star ( b ) is on the x axis at a distance @xmath136 from a. photons from star b encounter the jet at an angle @xmath137 .",
    "suppose the companion star has a bolometric luminosity @xmath138 and peak energy @xmath139 .",
    "considering the possible recoil of electrons , we estimate the energy of scattered photons by @xmath140 where we have used fiducial lfs @xmath141 , @xmath142 , and @xmath143 describes the degree to which eic scattering is kn suppressed .",

    "this is because : below @xmath154 , the jet is optically thick and all the external photons contribute to the eic flux ; above @xmath154 , the effective cross section of the jet is the sum of individual electrons and that equals to @xmath155 and is smaller than @xmath156 . note that @xmath154 in eq.([eq:5 ] ) is different from the photospheric radius in that the former considers all electrons in the jet but the latter only considers electrons in the casualty connected thickness @xmath157 ( usually @xmath158 ) .",
    "we note the fact that eic flux from outside the casualty connected region ( deeper layers in the jet ) will arrive at the observer at later time , and this is fully taken into account when we calculate the spectra and lightcurves ( through eq .",
    "[ eq:48 ] ) .",
    "the number density of external soft photons is given by @xmath159    the total ( isotropic ) number of scattered photons is @xmath160 from which , we can easily see that most photons are scattered at radius @xmath161 .",

    "as suggested by e.g. @xcite and @xcite , grb progenitor stars are possibly wolf - rayet ( w - r ) stars , which have a typical mass loss rate of @xmath167 , bolometric luminosity @xmath22 , and effective temperature @xmath168 .",

    "however , the uncertainties of the eic emission from es come from the jet dynamical evolution , which depends on circum - burst number density and jet power .",

    "photons of energy @xmath385 can only be observed from nearby ( @xmath386 ) grbs @xcite .",
    "therefore , constraints on the external photon field will be most effective for low redshift ( @xmath387 ) grbs .",
    "we also note that grbs with low bulk lorentz factor @xmath388 will mostly produce @xmath389 photons , which could be observed at high redshift .",
    "\\(2 ) we assume the jet kinetic power to be steady for a duration @xmath111 . in reality , grb prompt lightcurves show multiple emission pulses .",
    "some pulses are smooth but others vary on millisecond timescale , so the jet kinetic power could be episodic and the internal dissipation could happen locally .",
    "the eic emission is also modulated by the radial distribution of external photon field .",
    "if most eic scatterings happen at radii @xmath390 , an infinitely thin shell will produce a pulse of width @xmath391 . due to limited number of eic photons from a source located at cosmological distances ,",
    "telescopes are not sensitive to the variability down to milliseconds . instead",
    ", the observed eic lightcurve should more or less track the major pulses of the prompt emission , with smoothing on timescales of order @xmath391 .",

    "despite the discrepancy ( and also uncertainties ) , both of them pointed out that about @xmath397 of the binary systems have periods @xmath398 , which corresponds to @xmath399 .",
    "an even greater uncertainty comes from the unknown nature of grb progenitors , which may not be o stars @xcite .",
    "detection of the eic emission proposed in this paper will shed light on the nature of grb progenitors .",
    "\\(4 ) in the _ star cluster case _ , the eic luminosity depends on the number density of massive stars at the time when the grb occurs .",
    "there are large uncertainties in the first few myr of the star clusters evolution , especially in the so - called gas expulsion stage ( ges ) during which the residual gas in the cluster is blown away by stellar winds or outflows .",
    "the loss of mass during ges will cause the cluster to expand and the shallower potential well may allow a fraction of the stars ( especially the ones at outer radius ) to escape .",
    "therefore , the overall stellar number density drops with time .",
    "long grbs are concentrated on the very brightest regions of actively star - forming galaxies , where young massive clusters are particularly abundant @xcite .",

    "\\(5 ) there are a few potential issues in our numerical procedures developed in section [ section : theory ] .",
    "( a ) we assume electrons are accelerated to ultra - relativistic energies and have a simple powerlaw lorentz factor ( lf ) distribution . on one hand , if grb prompt emission is produced via sub - photospheric comtonization , then @xmath406 ( or electrons thermal lf ) might be of order a few or less .",
    "in that case , the eic emission would be much weaker than the internal dissipation model considered in this work .",
    "on the other hand , even if electrons are accelerated to a simple powerlaw , due to synchrotron , synchrotron - self - compton , or eic cooling , there s a cooling lf @xmath407 above which electrons distribution turns softer .",
    "the resulting eic spectrum at energy higher than @xmath408 will be softer than our prediction , but the total eic energy will not change much , as long as @xmath409 .",
    "( b ) electron s lf distribution is actually evolving with time , i.e. @xmath406 , @xmath407 and possibly the powerlaw index @xmath410 are all functions of time ( or radius ) . in principle , by convolving the time dependent lf distribution with single particle emission , we can calculate the eic emission to a higher degree of accuracy .",
    "however , since we are not yet sure where the internal dissipation accelerates electrons and how long will electrons stay hot @xcite , such a detailed calculation is left for possible future investigation .",
    "instead , constant @xmath406 and @xmath410 are used at all radius . as shown in section [ lc_spectr ] ( fig.[fig : case1_rlimited ] ) , by using a constant @xmath406 at all radius , we are making an assumption that electrons are hot near the radius @xmath209 where most scatterings happen .",
    "\\(6 ) another interesting application is the ic scattering of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) at high redshift by pop iii grb jets .",
    "the earliest pop iii stars form in minihalos of mass @xmath411 at redshift @xmath412 - @xmath413 @xcite .",

    "if we use a jet kinetic energy @xmath421 ( isotropic equivalent ) and a uniform circum - burst medium density of @xmath422 , we get the deceleration radius @xmath423 ( eq.[eq:9 ] )",

    "using @xmath426 , we expect a photon fluence of @xmath427 at @xmath428 from redshift 20 .",
    "\\(7 ) lastly , we estimate the possible contribution of the eic emission to the extragalactic @xmath5-ray background ( egb ) around @xmath347 , by the fs channel or i d channel when grbs have large lf ( e.g. @xmath429 ) .",
