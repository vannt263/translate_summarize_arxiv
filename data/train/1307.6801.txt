    "a fundamental problem in molecular biology is explaining how the three - dimensional structure of a protein is encoded within its amino acid sequence .",

    "translation accounts for the conversion of genetic information to the primary sequence of a protein , but knowledge of how the molecule then folds into a functional state is central to our understanding of the natural world .",
    "energy landscape theory provides a mechanism whereby the existence of intermediate structures , each associated with a free energy cost , enable the folding pathway of a protein to be mapped on a multidimensional potential energy landscape . assuming the global shape of the energy landscape for a good folder resembles a funnel means that only a small fraction of all possible structures need to be sampled before the protein attains its native fold @xcite .",
    "nascent proteins can begin to fold whilst they are still bound to a translating ribosome @xcite . during cotranslational folding the conformational space available to a protein increases incrementally with addition of residues to the polypeptide chain .",

    "some research groups have also developed a theoretical understanding of how protein folding is affected by varying translation rates @xcite , but so far there has not been a satisfactory attempt to modify energy landscape theory by accounting for cotranslational folding .",
    "a suitable energy landscape theory would extract some general properties of cotranslational folders from the complex nature of the system .",
    "a key question that may be answered using energy landscape theory is : what distinguishes cotranslational folders from arbitrary polymers or proteins that can only fold once translation is over ?",

    "decreasing the translation time by an order of magnitude per codon decreases the probability that a stable fold is achieved on the ribosome at a particular chain length .",

    "when a mutation that decreases overall translation time is made at an earlier codon there is a significant increase in the mean folding time .",
    "conversely , the same mutation at a later codon has little effect on the overall folding speed .",
    "this is rationalised by noting that at earlier times there is a lower probability for the protein to be in a stable fold and addition of the next amino acid contributes to instability .",
    "geometrically , perturbed folding trajectories have not converged over the interval that the synonymous mutation has provided whereas a stable fold has already been attained by the time later codons are translated . for the same reason , fast - to - slow mutations at later positions also have little effect whilst at earlier positions these substitutions afford the protein greater time to attain a stable fold and improve the mean folding time .",
    "these results agree well experimental evidence for synonymous mutations having a pronounced effect on folding yields and efficiency @xcite .",
    "it only remains to confirm the existence of effective free energy landscapes and diffusion coefficients that enable the folding time scales predicted by equation ( [ qg6 ] ) to be described by a sensible set of parameters . a scheme implemented in c++ with the conformational entropy @xmath114 defined by bryngelson and wolynes @xcite as    @xmath152 \\ , \\ ] ]",

    "this confirms that the effect of variable translation rates on folding times and pathways can be described by changes in an effective free - energy landscape whose shape reflects the highly complex dynamics of the underlying system .",
    "furthermore , that this landscape can be derived directly from experimental observables .",
    "in this paper , two key concepts have been introduced for an energy landscape theory of cotranslational folding .",
    "the first is to consider each polypeptide of nascent chain length @xmath2 as a protein in its own right with a folding trajectory that is projected onto an @xmath12-dimensional nested energy landscape .",
    "a formal definition reveals that the ability of a protein to attain a stable fold at length @xmath2 is completely determined by curvatures of these landscapes .",
    "secondly , cotranslational folding that is under kinetic control can be described by a diffusion process on an effective energy landscape : a weighted average of nested energy landscapes whose weights depend on the translation rate of individual codons .",
    "these concepts can be used to extend the current understanding of how cotranslational folders are designed to accommodate variable translation rates .",
    "large fluctuations in average curvatures have previously been demonstrated to mark folding transitions and distinguish good folders from arbitrary polymer sequences @xcite .",
    "the origin of this behaviour is not entirely clear for the case of a full - length protein , but was originally suggested to be a result of the effective two - state dynamics of folding being connected to a symmetry - breaking mechanism of finite phase transitions @xcite . in the context of cotranslational folding , the average curvature of each nested energy landscape has a lower bound so that folding trajectories can converge on the ribosome . the conditions on the landscape at which convergence occurs have now been derived , and the development of experiments to study proteins arrested on the ribosome at different chain lengths @xcite will be useful for confirming these results .    considering cotranslational folding as a composite stochastic process generalises two - state folding models with exponentially distributed dwell times at each codon @xcite .",
    "this allows the bryngelson and wolynes approximation to make accurate predictions of mean folding times , or derive a suitable energy landscape for the entire reaction process from a set of experimentally observable parameters .",
    "the changes in the effective free energy landscape and diffusion coefficient can provide a good indication of how folding pathways and yields become altered by variable translation rates when the process in under kinetic control .",
    "moreover , the theory can be used in combination with previous findings @xcite to study the extent of cotranslational folding on a genome - wide scale since it provides an intuitive understanding of how proteins evolved to fold on the ribosome ."
