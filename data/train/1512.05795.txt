    "we first test stability of the time integration .",
    "specifically , we illustrate that our implementation is not susceptible to any significant or uncontrolled errors , given the intrinsic nonlinearity of the tdks equations and the use of an iterative solver on the linearized problem .",

    "( 14 digits ) , these quantities are @xmath57ev/(atom@xmath55fs ) and @xmath58 electrons / fs , with the 12 digit case producing drifts of a similar order of magnitude . going from 8 digits to 14 digits ,",
    "the average cpu time per step varies linearly from 0.85 s / time step to 1.64 s / time step , i.e. , convergence is exponential in the number of gmres iterations .",

    "[ table : geometries ] [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     it is worth noting that all dft - md trajectories are generated with the full four - electron paw potential .",

    "the sample size is necessarily small due to the significant computational resources required for each tddft calculation , with each production calculation being done on 1,152 cores .",
    "however , because the electronic density of warm dense beryllium is relatively uniform , we do not see much variability in the dsf from configuration to configuration . in an effort to quantify this variability",
    ", we apply jackknife resampling to estimate the variance and indicate single standard deviation intervals . for the scattering angles considered in the manuscript , we show the estimated error intervals for the dsf computed with four - electron paw potentials in figure [ fig : dsf_variation ] .",

    "similar real - time calculations in the gas phase have reported satisfaction to within @xmath89 @xcite and we report similar results .",
    "forms of the dsf based upon model dielectric functions may or may not be consistent with various sum rules by construction . our dsf is derived strictly from a time - evolved electronic density for which charge conservation is numerically guaranteed to high precision , and makes no assumptions about the form of the equivalent dielectric response . to this end ,",
    "the primary source of error in our satisfaction of sum rules is due to numerical errors in the post - processing , e.g. , the numerical evaluation of fourier integrals with integrands which become increasingly oscillatory at higher energies , and thus more prone to small errors in the response . when checking sum rules produced using linear response tddft , it is common practice to fit the high energy tail of the dsf to force it to go to zero in a way that is consistent with the integrand in the above sum rule @xcite .",
    "this is also critical for real - time simulations where small phase errors between the real and imaginary parts of the time domain density response are amplified at high energies relative to low energies when post - processing to generate the energy domain response . rather than force the tail to fit some form",
    ", we simply impose a high energy cutoff on the integrand once the dsf has decayed to @xmath90 of its peak value .",
    "we simply seek to verify that the majority of the weight of our response is consistent with the sum rule , and could resort to fitting tails if necessary to improve agreement .    applying this technique",
    ", we verify that we satisfy the f - sum rule for our four - electron data with a relative error of @xmath91 ( @xmath92 ) , @xmath93 ( @xmath94 ) , @xmath95 ( @xmath96 ) , and @xmath97 ( @xmath98 ) . in all cases ,",
    "we underestimate the value of the f - sum rule , giving us confidence that a fit of the slowly - decaying high energy tail might be used to improve this agreement . applying this same technique to the two - electron data we find relative errors of @xmath99 ( @xmath92 ) , @xmath89 ( @xmath94 ) , @xmath100 ( @xmath96 ) , and @xmath95 ( @xmath98 ) . here",
    ", we do not uniformly underestimate the sum rule as was the case with the four - electron data .",
    "the two - electron data decays much more abruptly at high energies , and does not need to represent the response of slowly - decaying core states , so we do not view this as a deficiency ( i.e. , fitting a tail would not have as strong of an impact here )",

    "this indicates that the underestimation of the tddft structure factor may be due to differences between the free electron response for the two - electron and four - electron paws , which may or may not be physical .",

    "<S> this effectively removes the dynamics of the core states from the density response and the high energy shoulder above 80 ev in the dsf is removed . for the temperatures and densities </S>",
    "<S> being considered , this is roughly equivalent to partitioning the inner two and outer two electrons into bound and free groups in the chihara picture , such that the two - electron response corresponds to @xmath47 . </S>",
    "<S> however , there are important distinctions to keep in mind . first , in the four - electron calculation </S>",
    "<S> , all electrons are being treated identically , whereas it is typical to treat @xmath47 and @xmath6 using different levels of theory and without self - consistency in the chihara framework . </S>",
    "<S> second , even in the two - electron calculation , the response of the outer two electrons is still aware of the two frozen core states tied to each atom through their screening of the nuclear potential . </S>",
    "<S> finally , these calculations are based upon explicit simulations of the real - time electron dynamics of a bulk supercell of warm dense beryllium rather than a phenomenological model of the response based upon a jellium plus average - atom picture .    based upon our observation that the two - electron response roughly corresponds to @xmath47 </S>",
    "<S> , we can also extract a quantity akin to @xmath6 by differencing the four - electron and two - electron dsfs . </S>",
    "<S> the effective @xmath47 and @xmath6 computed within tddft are illustrated in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : comparison ] . </S>",
    "<S> here we compare our tddft calculations to calculations done using state - of - the - art models for @xmath47 and @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> the former is treated with an rpa - level model dielectric function with lifetime effects taken from four - electron dft - md calculations of the optical conductivity ; the mermin approximation - ab initio collision frequencies ( ma - aicf ) method in @xcite . the latter is calculated with the formalism developed in @xcite and a quantum mechanical average - atom ion - sphere model with slater exchange . as we are interested in studying energies relevant to the electronic response , we ignore @xmath7 , though it is necessarily present in the chihara - independent tddft calculation .    . </S>",
    "<S> ( b ) illustrates the difference of the four- and two - electron tddft responses compared to an average atom treatment@xcite of @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : comparison ] ]    examining the dispersion of the primary plasmon peak in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : comparison]a , we see that tddft predicts a slight ( @xmath485 ev ) blue shift relative to the ma - aicf calculation @xmath49 and @xmath50 , whereas it predicts a stronger ( @xmath4810 ev ) red shift relative to ma - aicf at @xmath51 and @xmath52 . </S>",
    "<S> we attribute this shift to exchange / correlation and band structure effects , not present in the ma - aicf dielectric function . </S>",
    "<S> previously , comparisons of inelastic x - ray scattering spectra to rpa and lda in cold free electron metals ( na and al ) indicate a similar trend in which both lda and experiment are red shifted relative to rpa@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , these calculations also indicate that the addition of lifetime effects to the lda are necessary to totally reconcile theory and experiment </S>",
    "<S> . while non - adiabatic exchange correlation kernels are available for energy domain linear response tddft , no such time - domain exchange correlation potentials are currently available for real - time tddft . </S>",
    "<S> as warm dense matter requires a large number of thermally occupied states such that energy domain tddft may become computationally prohibitive , warm dense matter may provide compelling motivation for the development and testing of these functionals .    </S>",
    "<S> considering the bound - free shoulder in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : comparison]b , we see that tddft is generally in good agreement with the average - atom model treatment of @xmath6 with some minor differences . </S>",
    "<S> such average atom models agree well with real - space green s function methods for cold solid beryllium @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we observe a trend opposite the free - free feature , in which there is a red shift of the tddft result at small angles , and a blue shift at large angles . </S>",
    "<S> we expect that lda will do an increasingly poor job of describing the compton scattering limit at large @xmath38 due to its well - established self - interaction error . </S>",
    "<S> applying a functional with some fraction of fock exchange should remedy this behavior and will be the subject of future investigations . </S>",
    "<S> further , the tddft bound - free feature computed by differencing the two- and four - electron dsfs has a small negative dip below the 80 ev onset of the core feature . </S>",
    "<S> it is difficult to determine whether this is due to core - polarization suppressing the response of the valence electrons in the four - electron calculation , or potentially an artifact of the different pseudization procedures used to generate the two paw potentials used for this comparison . </S>",
    "<S> this motivates further investigations of the paw formalism applied to both real - time tddft and specifically , warm dense matter in which thermal effects will start to blur the line between core and valence electrons .    </S>",
    "<S> we presented a method for the direct calculation of the dsf for warm dense matter , independent of the chihara decomposition , by applying real - time tddft to configurations drawn from thermal mermin dft - md calculations . </S>",
    "<S> comparison of our results with state - of - the - art models applied within the chihara picture illustrates some subtle differences between the two , though it generally supports the use of the chihara formalism as an inexpensive alternative to the very detailed and computationally intensive tddft calculations . </S>",
    "<S> we anticipate that tddft may provide a powerful discriminating tool for arbitrating disagreements between these more phenomenological theories and experiment , especially as experimental data becomes more highly resolved . </S>",
    "<S> our framework enables future explorations of systems in which the partition between bound and free electrons is more ambiguous . </S>",
    "<S> it also provides a platform for studying the impact of recent foundational developments in dft at non - zero temperature@xcite . </S>"
