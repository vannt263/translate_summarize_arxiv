    "whereas most phenomena are quite well accounted for , the predictions for the decays @xmath7 remain much below the experimental results .",
    "the lowest order amplitude is fully determined by chiral symmetry @xcite to be [ amp ] f(s_a , s_b , s_c)&=&-f^(2)(s_a ) + f^(2)(s_a)&&t(s_a)=1 + where @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the up and down quark masses , @xmath16 and @xmath17 qcd parameters and @xmath18 , @xmath19 kinematical variables to be defined later .",
    "while the form of eq .",
    "( [ amp ] ) is valid for the decay into @xmath20 , the expression for three neutral pions is obtained by setting @xmath21 .",
    "furthermore , in lowest order in the chiral expansion one has [ massrel]b_0(m_d - m_u)&= & ( m_k^0 ^ 2-m_k^+^2)-(m_^0 ^ 2-m _ ^+^2 ) + & & m_1",
    "these equations yield a width of @xmath22 ev for the decay @xmath23 which is far below the experimental value of @xmath24 ev @xcite .",
    "it is an unusual situation , since most predictions of current algebra fall within @xmath25 to @xmath26% of the experimental results .    however ,",
    "also the next - to - leading calculation of gasser and leutwyler @xcite failed to reproduce the experimental value , despite a dramatic improvement .",
    "these authors obtain a width of @xmath27ev for the @xmath23 decay ( we have adopted the new value of @xmath28 @xcite which increases the width by about @xmath29 ev ) .",
    "thus , one may conclude that higher order corrections are very large , possibly preventing a satisfactory representation of this decay by chpt .",
    "since the decay rate is proportional to @xmath30 it is particularly sensitive to the value of the quark masses .",
    "the quark mass ratios are known with some precision @xcite from a variety of low energy investigations .",
    "since they are fundamental parameters of the basic theory , they should be determined as accurately as possible .",
    "of special interest is the up quark mass because @xmath31 is a very appealing solution to the strong cp problem @xcite . from eq .",
    "( [ amp ] ) we see that decreasing @xmath14 indeed increases the rate as required by experiment . on the other hand , corrections to the second factor",
    "will also have this effect .",
    "thus , only a careful investigation of higher order effects will enable one to draw a conclusion on the quark masses .",
    "let us formulate this more precisely .",
    "the amplitude for the decay @xmath23 can be written as @xcite [ amptot ] f(s_a , s_b , s_c)= - f(s_a , s_b , s_c,__,m_u, .. )+ where the quark masses are the renormalization group invariant masses , @xmath32 a qcd scale , @xmath18 the mandelstam variables for the decay .",
    "theorem @xcite implies that the electromagnetic contribution is of order @xmath33 , where @xmath33 stands for any invariant product of momenta .",
    "moreover , the leading ( in momentum ) electromagnetic contribution of order @xmath34 is further suppressed by a factor @xmath35 if the amplitude is assumed to be linear in @xmath36 @xcite . recently",
    ", these terms were reanalyzed in an effective lagrangian framework @xcite and the expected smallness of the electromagnetic corrections ( sutherland s theorem ) was confirmed .",
    "we will therefore neglect them throughout .",
    "returning then to the qcd contribution in eq .",
    "( [ amptot ] ) , the second factor , the function @xmath37 , is expanded in chiral perturbation theory in powers of momentum and mass [ chiramp ] f = f^(2)+f^(4)+ .. here , @xmath38 has already been defined in eq .",
    "( [ amp ] ) and @xmath39 , etc .",
    "are of higher orders .",
    "@xmath39 was given explicitely by gasser and leutwyler @xcite and consists of a variety of loops and counterterms .",
    "the corresponding coupling constants also occur in other observables which are also calculated using the chiral lagrangian , for instance the decay constants or the masses of the mesons .",
    "to order @xmath40 , it is therefore possible to express some of these corrections through physical quantities . in particular ,",
    "the quark mass contribution to the kaon mass difference can be written as @xcite [ meson ] _ _",
    "k_qcd(m_k^0 ^ 2-m_k^+^2)_qcd = q^-2(m_k^2-m_^2 ) and can be obtained from the measured masses once the electromagnetic mass differences are subtracted . here ,",
    "[ massdiff]q^-2 with @xmath41 .",
    "then , one can rewrite the amplitude as [ truamp ] f(s_a , s_b , s_c)&=&-q^-2(m_k^2-m_^2 ) + & & f^(2)(s_a)(1+_dec ) . @xmath42",
    "contains the remaining part of the @xmath43 terms as well as corrections from higher orders in the chiral expansion .",
    "terms of order @xmath44 are tiny and are therefore neglected throughout . as anticipated , the rate is indeed proportional to the quark mass difference squared . ) is required . ]",
    "the decay @xmath7 fixes the quantity @xmath45 rather than the ratio @xmath46 .",
    "this is in agreement with the observation by kaplan and manohar @xcite that the chiral lagrangian possesses a curious reparametrization invariance under which masses and some of the other parameters are changed .",
    "it implies that matrix elements derived from green functions which do not involve scalar or pseudoscalar densities are invariant @xcite with respect to that transformation . and indeed , the combination @xmath45 in eq .",
    "( [ massdiff ] ) is invariant , while for instance @xmath46 is not .",
    "unfortunately , there is no direct experimental access to this ratio , the relevant green functions must be obtained from semiphenomenological analyses @xcite .",
    "there exists an independent determination of @xmath45 by means of the following equation [ newneun ] m_1 ^ 2 = _",
    "_ k_qcd + ( k-)_em .",
    "provided that the electromagnetic contribution is known , eqs .",
    "( [ meson ] ) and ( [ newneun ] ) can be used to check the consistency of the different calculations or to predict the rate for the decay @xmath7 .",
    "the calculation of the electromagnetic mass differences is notoriously difficult .",
    "dashen s theorem @xcite implies that the electromagnetic mass difference of the kaons is equal to the mass difference of the pions , and negligible ] up to terms of order @xmath47 .",
    "if these are neglected , one has @xmath48 and one can write    [ betamp ] f(s_a , s_b , s_c)= - f^(2)(s_a)(1+_dec ) and @xmath42 determines the rate . in their calculation of the decay rate for @xmath7 gasser and leutwyler @xcite obtained a correction @xmath42 of about @xmath49% . together with eq .",
    "( [ betamp ] ) , the value of @xmath50 ev for the width resulted , still far below the experimental number .",
    "however , it was found recently @xcite that the corrections to dashen s theorem could be substantial .",
    "one should therefore start from eq .",
    "( [ truamp ] ) , avoiding unnecessary uncertainties arising from corrections to dashen s theorem . the normalization of the @xmath7 amplitude is then determined by @xmath45 which follows in principle from eq .",
    "( [ meson ] ) .",
    "as pointed out in @xcite , the positive corrections to dashen s theorem found in @xcite increase @xmath51 such that together with the value of @xmath42 obtained by gasser and leutwyler the experimental rate for @xmath7 would be reproduced .",
    "thus , the rate of the @xmath52 decay can be increased either by determining further corrections in @xmath42 ( beyond those calculated by gasser and leutwyler ) or by increasing the value of @xmath53 . in view of eq .",
    "( [ massdiff ] ) this latter term amounts to an increase in @xmath45 and thus to a smaller up quark mass .",
    "but before any conclusion on the quark masses can be drawn , the decay corrections must be understood better .",
    "it has been argued @xcite that @xmath54 mixing may increase the theoretical rate to the experimental value .",
    "however , it was recently shown @xcite that the effects of the @xmath55 are in fact included in the standard treatment and that the enhancement is due to an incomplete treatment of the resonances as an explanation for the constants of the chiral lagrangian .",
    "we therefore omit this issue in the following .",
    "the goal of this paper is to calculate one class of corrections in @xmath42 , the so called unitary corrections which ensure that the decay amplitude satisfies unitarity .",
    "these corrections are the sum of certain diagrams , namely those describing the rescattering of the final state particles to all orders .",
    "it is believed that they dominate the corrections , in particular since the final state interactions of two pions in the @xmath56 @xmath57-wave channel is strong and attractive .",
    "in fact , in the one - loop calculation of gasser and leutwyler they yield the largest new contributions .",
    "they account for roughly three quarters of the corrections , pion loops contributing about @xmath58% and kaons and etas about @xmath59% thereof , while other terms provide the remaining quarter ( of course , the division of the corrections depends on the renormalization scale chosen ; however , physical arguments such as resonance saturation of the counterterms indicate that the scale used for the above numbers is reasonable ) .    a method to evaluate the unitary corrections",
    "has been given long ago by khuri and treiman @xcite .",
    "keeping only two particle rescatterings of pions ( and neglecting @xmath60-waves ) they derived a set of dispersion relations , the khuri - treiman equation .",
    "this paper was subsequently analyzed by several authors @xcite .",
    "in particular , kacser @xcite derived the correct prescription for the analytical continuation of the partial wave projections of the decay amplitude .",
    "bronzan @xcite and later also neveu and scherk @xcite omitting also the @xmath61 rescatterings , solved the khuri - treiman equation approximately . using the properties of the omn@xmath62s function @xmath63 entering their approximate solution",
    "they argued that the remaining terms are small .",
    "some time ago , roiesnel and truong @xcite reconsidered the problem , using similar , although not equivalent methods to those of neveu and scherk to calculate the unitary corrections .",
    "these authors found a large enhancement of the amplitude , enough to account for the observed rate .",
    "the numerical results of this work were criticized in ref .",
    "@xcite on physical grounds and we confirm their findings .",
    "we believe therefore that their result is a overestimate of the unitary corrections .    in this work we will use ( and generalize by the inclusion of @xmath60-waves ( see also @xcite ) ) the method of khuri and treiman to determine numerically the unitary corrections .",
    "it is organized as follows .    in section 2",
    "we review the general structure of the decay amplitude for @xmath64 and give the necessary definitions.in section 3 we discuss the khuri - treiman equations and the inclusion of the @xmath65 rescatterings . in section 4",
    "we discuss the subtraction procedure , and in section 5 we build up an iterative scheme for the numerical solution of the set of coupled equations for the projected amplitudes @xmath66 . in section 6",
    "we discuss our numerical results and the quality of our iteration , and then in section 7 we draw the conclusions .",
    "some appendices contain necessary technical details .    in this section",
    "we discuss the general form of the amplitude for the decay @xmath67 .",
    "it serves to fix the notation , to give the isospin decomposition of the amplitude and to discuss its symmetry properties .",
    "we denote the three pions in the decay @xmath68 by the letters a , b , c , their corresponding four - momenta by @xmath69 , @xmath70 , @xmath71 and label their isospins by @xmath72 , @xmath73 , @xmath74 .",
    "the invariant masses of the pions are then @xmath75 disregarding all mass differences at this stage .",
    "the four momentum of the isospin singlet @xmath52 is denoted by @xmath76 .    in the standard model of the strong , electromagnetic and weak interactions ,",
    "the decay @xmath68 proceeds either through the isospin breaking piece of the qcd hamiltonian or through an operator of electromagnetic origin . for both contributions ,",
    "the interaction hamiltonian @xmath77 is @xmath78 .",
    "it is then convenient to treat the @xmath52 as a spurious isospin triplet and to assume isospin conservation in the decay .",
    "the corresponding isospin state is labeled by @xmath79 .",
    "the amplitude for a general isospin assignment of the pions is m&= & < , k_a;,k_b;,k_c|h(0)|k_r > + & & i ( 2)^4 ( k_a+k_b+k_c - k_r ) m _ ; ( s_a , s_b , s_c ) .",
    "the invariant amplitude has the decomposition [ 2.2 ] m_;(s_a , s_b , s_c ) & = & f(s_a , s_b , s_c ) _ _ + & & + f(s_b , s_c , s_a ) _ _ + & & + f(s_c , s_a , s_b ) _ _ , [ ampm ] where the isoscalar amplitude @xmath80 is a function of the mandelstam variables s_a=(k_r - k_a)^2,s_b=(k_r - k_b)^2,s_c=(k_r - k_c)^2 .",
    "of course only two of these variables are independent as they are related by the on - shell condition s_a+s_b+s_c=3 m_^2+m_^23 s_0 .",
    "bose statistics of the three pion system implies the symmetry f(s_a , s_b , s_c)=f(s_a , s_c , s_b ) such that the amplitude @xmath81 remains invariant under the exchanges of a & & a bc , + b & & b ca , + c & & c ab . the amplitude for the decay into charged pions is then found to be = i ( 2)^4 ( k_a+k_b+k_c - k_r ) f(s_a , s_b , s_c ) , whereas the amplitude for the decay into neutral pions is expressed as & = & i ( 2)^4 ( k_a+k_b+k_c - k_r ) + & & .",

    "eqn.([3.1 ] ) expresses the connection between causality and analyticity for the considered amplitude .",
    "unitarity gives an expression for the discontinuity of @xmath82 in @xmath36 for fixed @xmath83 and analogous ones for the other two discontinuities in the form of a sum over intermediate states involved in all the rescattering processes .",
    "the intermediate state with lowest mass contributing in this sum is the two - pion state leading to a rescattering of two outgoing pions in the decay . as any other intermediate state such as a @xmath84 or a @xmath85 state",
    "will contribute to the discontinuity at a much larger threshold it is a reasonable approximation to drop them @xcite .",

    "although this choice affects the total amplitude , say at the center of the dalitz plot , rather substantially , the resulting uncertainty on @xmath366 is not important .",
    "the contribution to @xmath366 can then be written as a integral over the discontinuity in the @xmath36 channel : @xmath384 \\over ( s'-s_a)^3 } .\\ ] ] solving eq .",
    "( [ aldisprel ] ) by iteration we obtain @xmath385 , which has to be compared to the contribution of @xmath386 , @xmath387 .",
    "thus @xmath388 which lies perfectly well within the range established above .",
    "however , the sign of the correction ( positive ) is now well understood .",
    "the reason is that current algebra underestimates the @xmath56 s - wave rescattering , hence yielding too small a discontinuity .",
    "we conclude that the actual value of @xmath389 is higher than the one - loop value ; and we will adopt @xmath385 as the most likely number .",
    "it shifts the amplitude at the center to 1.71 + @xmath3900.45 ( of which 1.47 is in the subtraction polynomial ) or by about 9 % .. ]      in sect .",
    "4 we mentioned an ambiguity to the solution of khuri - treiman equations due to the so far unspecified asymptotic behaviour of the @xmath156-phase shifts . here",
    "we give a quantitative estimate of the effect on our results .",
    "we neglect the @xmath379 phase shifts and consider the approximate solution @xmath391 , where @xmath289 is given explicitly in eq .",
    "( [ 5.28 ] ) .",
    "this approximation is actually very close to our final numerical solution , c.f .",
    "now we study two cases with distinct asymptotic behaviour of both , phase shift and amplitude : i ) @xmath392 and @xmath393 , i.e. @xmath394 and ii ) @xmath395 and @xmath396 , where we fine tune @xmath397 such that the amplitude has the improved asymptotic behaviour @xmath398 . in the first case we use the phase shift as employed before , given in eq .",
    "( [ schenk ] ) and denoted here by @xmath399 . in case ii ) we need a model which guides the phase to its asymptotic value @xmath291 .",
    "we take @xmath400 with @xmath401 and @xmath402 is the scale where the phase reaches its asymptotic value .",
    "we consider two choices @xmath403 and @xmath404 with corresponding scales @xmath405 and @xmath406 respectively .",
    "we then calculate the difference @xmath407 at the center of the physical region for various subtraction points @xmath341 .",
    "the maximal difference we obtain is @xmath408 , or 1 % and 5 % of the full amplitude for real and imaginary part respectively .",
    "this in turn implies an error on the rate @xmath409 of less than 3 % or @xmath410 .",
    "the exercise shows that rather different assumptions on the asymptotic behaviour imply only modest changes of the amplitude in the low energy region . here",
    ", taking three subtractions pays visibly . the same estimate for the twice subtracted case yields an uncertainty in the real part of the amplitude of already @xmath411 or @xmath412 on the rate .",
    "we continue with some remarks on the structure and convergence of our iteration . as described in section 5 , we distinguish two iterations , namely the one in powers of the weaker @xmath413 rescatterings ( @xmath307-iteration ) and the iteration when solving the dispersion relation ( @xmath414-iteration ) .",
    "in fact , the latter is an iteration in the @xmath56 rescatterings .",
    "we will discuss some exemplary numerical results and comment on the general trends .",
    "we will always use the subtraction at zero with the corresponding values of the polynomial .    to illustrate the @xmath414-iteration",
    ", we take the succesive values of the contribution to pure @xmath56 problem as considered by neveu and scherk . writing the amplitude @xmath144 in the form ( see eq .",
    "( [ ukuk ] ) ) u_k(s)=_1^__mk(s ) we find in the center of the dalitz plot the following numbers : @xmath415 this suggests that the iteration in the @xmath56 scattering phase converges nearly like a geometrical series with a coefficent of @xmath416 .",
    "we have found this behaviour over the whole dalitz plot and for all values of @xmath307 .",
    "the iteration is therefore terminated at @xmath417 . _                      to appreciate the degree to which the final result fulfills unitarity , we consider again the amplitude at the center of the dalitz plot for various stages of the iteration . including only the first iteration , @xmath289 , the value of the amplitude is @xmath426 .",
    "unitarity is checked by inserting this ( and the corresponding values for all @xmath57 ) value into the dispersion relation for the total amplitude which yields a new value , say @xmath427 on the left hand side .",
    "then the relative difference @xmath428 is calculated . at the center of the dalitz plot",
    ", we obtain for this deviation @xmath429 which indicates that unitarity is fulfilled to about six percent .",
    "taking now the full amplitude , we get at the center again @xmath430 .",
    "the unitarity check now yields @xmath431 for the deviation , a rather satisfactory result .",
    "we see that the iteration has improved the unitarity drastically , although the central value of the amplitude is not much changed .",
    "another result of interest is the quality of the neveu - scherk @xmath289 iteration and the relative sizes of the various isospin amplitudes @xmath432 and @xmath142 .",
    "as seen from the values given before , @xmath433 corresponds rather accurately to the final value .",
    "this is accidental .",
    "if we just solve the complete neveu - scherk problem , e.g. only include @xmath56 rescatterings , the result would be @xmath434 and @xmath289 would not be a good approximation . on the other hand , the complete calculation yields @xmath435 , @xmath436 , @xmath437 .",
    "this shows that the contribution from @xmath145 is quite substantial , and that @xmath144 alone does not saturate the amplitude at all .",
    "nevertheless we note that @xmath438 is roughly about a third , which justifies our perturbative treatment of @xmath145 ( and @xmath142 ) .",
    "our calculation further depends on input parameters which are not well known .",
    "one is the cutoff of the dispersion integral . changing it from @xmath439 to @xmath440 , the rates vary at most by @xmath338 ev and thus the variation is negligible .",
    "let us turn now to the values of the physical quantities .",
    "if we take the one - loop value for the constant @xmath366 , the rate for @xmath446 , normalized by @xmath345 , is [ valut ] = ( 180 40 )   ev .",
    "the error given reflects our estimate of the uncertainty of 25 % of @xmath366 . on the other hand ,",
    "if the improved value for @xmath366 is used , the rate becomes [ ivalut ] = 209  ev .",
    "we estimate the remaining error on this result to be about @xmath25 ev . since the one - loop value of @xmath366 is most certainly too small , the result in eq .",
    "( [ ivalut ] ) should be more reliable than the value in eq .",
    "( [ valut ] ) the corresponding values for the decay into neutral pions are @xmath447 and @xmath448 .",
    "thus , the rates are not subtstantially larger than the previous results , if the the one - loop value of @xmath366 is taken .",
    "however , if its improved value is employed by taking into account the rescatterings through the khuri - treiman equations , the corrections are substantial , although the result is still considerably below the experimental one .",
    "the size of the corrections are qualitatively reasonable : since the one - loop corrections amount to about 50 % in amplitude , next order corrections might be expected at about 40 ev , roughly the value we found .",
    "the ratio r= between the rates of the neutral and charged pion channel takes the values r=1.40 0.03 and r=1.41 0.03 for the two values of @xmath366 , respectively .",
    "the values correspond to the the small subtraction points @xmath341 considered ; the error is obtained by varying the @xmath341 between @xmath449 and @xmath165 ( see table 4 ) . in comparison ,",
    "the value @xmath450 was obtained in ref .",
    "the particle data group quotes @xmath451 favoring smaller values for @xmath452 , in particular almost excluding the current algebra result .",
    "recently , @xmath452 has been remeasured in a direct measurement @xcite r=1.44 0.09 0.01 with smaller errors than previously and which is in very good agreement with our result and the one - loop value but somewhat below the current algebra prediction of @xmath453 .    the distribution over the dalitz plot is conventionally described by the two variables @xmath454 and @xmath455 @xmath456 since @xmath457 is small , it is important to keep the masses of the charged and neutral pions different .",
    "the mass difference is generated by electromagnetic corrections .",
    "however , as discussed in the first section , the other electromagnetic contributions to the decay amplitude are small and can be neglected .",
