    "cold trapped atoms are an ideal system for investigating the quantum properties of the mechanical effects of photon - atom interaction",
    ". pioneering experiments with optical lattices and ion traps have allowed to measure and characterize several properties of the scattered radiation , thereby gaining insight into the dynamics of the driven atoms and , in particular , of the mechanical effects of light on the atomic center - of - mass motion  @xcite .",
    "recently , in experiments with single trapped ions it has been possible to measure with high precision the elastic component of the light scattered by a driven dipole  @xcite , and to observe and characterize the stokes and anti - stokes components due to the harmonic motion in the trap  @xcite , thereby confirming theoretical predictions  @xcite .",
    "lately , the properties and the manifestation of the mechanical effects in the light scattered by these systems is experiencing renewed interest in several experiments , investigating the coupling of radiation with single atoms and ions in optical resonators  @xcite .    in this work , we investigate the spectrum of resonance fluorescence of a harmonically trapped atom , whose internal transition is @xmath0shaped , and which is cooled by two lasers tuned at two - photon resonance .",
    "this configuration is peculiar , since photon emission arises only due to the mechanical effects in the photon - atom interaction .",
    "in fact , when the coupling between internal and external degrees of freedom can be neglected ( e.g.  for copropagating laser beams ) , this system exhibits coherent population trapping  @xcite : the electronic stationary state is a stable coherence , that does not absorb photons due to destructive interference between the dipole excitation paths , leading to no emission of photons at steady state .",
    "in contrast , for laser configurations where two photon processes are doppler - sensitive , internal and external degrees of freedom are coupled .",
    "if the atomic center - of - mass motion is confined in a steep potential , such configuration may allow for laser  cooling to the potential ground state  @xcite . here , we study the spectral properties of the radiation scattered by the atoms in the final stage of the laser  cooling dynamics .",
    "our theoretical analysis considers the quantum dynamics of the internal and external degrees of freedom of the atom .",
    "it is based on the perturbative expansion of the atomic dynamics in second order in the lamb  dicke parameter , i.e.  in the ratio between the size of the wave packet over the laser wavelength  @xcite .",
    "we extend previous theoretical investigations  @xcite , which analysed the stokes and anti - stokes components of the radiation scattered by a trapped dipole . in those studies these components",
    "dominate over the mollow inelastic spectrum of the bare dipole  @xcite , which is mainly due to photon scattering at zero order in the lamb ",
    "dicke expansion . in our case",
    ", the spectral component of the bare three - level atom disappears due to destructive quantum interference , and additional features emerge , which allow further insight into the coupled dynamics between the internal and external degrees of freedom of the driven atom .",
    "we analyse each spectral component , and discuss how to extract information from these results about the atomic dynamics at steady state .",
    "this work is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii the system is described and the dynamics is discussed qualitatively . in section",
    "iii we present the theoretical description and evaluate the spectrum using the formalism of  @xcite .",
    "we apply perturbation theory combined with the spectral decomposition of the liouville operator  @xcite , and calculate contributions to the spectrum at higher orders in the lamb  dicke expansion . in section iv the results are summarized and compared with the picture for the dynamics presented in section ii .",
    "finally , we discuss our results in comparison with the spectrum of a two - level transition driven by a plane and by a standing wave , as evaluated in  @xcite . in the appendices , several details of the theoretical derivation",
    "are reported .",
    "the reader who is not interested in the theoretical details can discard section iii without loss of coherence in the presentation .",

    "in fact , this signal is due to rayleigh scattering processes where the initial and final state is the dark state @xmath277 and the vibrational number @xmath278 is conserved .",
    "thus , this excitation originates from the lowest order mechanical corrections to the rabi frequency and it depends on the angle of emission @xmath19 .    at the frequencies @xmath48 one observes two narrow resonances .",
    "these are the motional sidebands of the elastic peak , the stokes and anti - stokes components of the scattered light .",
    "they correspond to raman scattering where the initial and final internal state is @xmath279 and the vibrational number is changed by one phonon .",

    "dicke expansion : this corresponds to the a.c.stark shift of the ground ",

    ", the stokes component is shown : the vertical dashed line indicate the position of the frequency @xmath285 . in the inset , the whole spectrum is shown .",

    "these can be decomposed into the sum of lorentz curves , whose height scales with @xmath286 and is linear in @xmath207 , whereas the width is in zero order in the lamb ",
    "dicke expansion .",
    "part of these features can be reproduced by evaluating the incoherent spectrum of a bare @xmath0transition driven at two photon resonance , whose ground  state coherence has a finite decay time  @xcite .",
    "hence , their origin can be explained with photon scattering at zero order in the lamb  dicke parameter , occurring once the atom has left the dark state .",
    "nevertheless , this part of the spectrum exhibits also peculiar features , which can not be understood in these terms .",
    "these are in fact curves which characterize the excitation spectrum of the bare @xmath0atom  @xcite , and which here appear shifted by the frequency @xmath287 from their center - frequency .",
    "they thus describe scattering processes where the vibrational number is changed by one phonon . for saturating driving fields ,",
    "they can be interpreted as raman scattering processes , where the initial state is the ground ",
    "state coherence @xmath288 and the final state is another dressed state at a different vibrational number state .",
    "the linewidth of the emitted photon is then the linewidth of the corresponding dressed state transition , while the center frequency is the corresponding a.c.stark shift . here",
    ", the center frequencies are shifted by the trap frequency @xmath52 , since the dark state is excited only by processes changing the vibrational number .",
    "remarkably , in second order in the lamb ",
    "dicke expansion the spectrum @xmath77 does not depend on the position of the detector , apart for the dipole pattern of emission .",
    "this is another consequence of the fact that at zero order in the perturbative expansion the atom at steady state is decoupled from radiation because of quantum interference  @xcite .    using these results",
    ", one can characterize the steady state of the motion .",
    "for instance , the measurement of the linewidth of the motional sidebands gives the cooling rate of the process .",
    "the phonon number @xmath289 at steady state can be measured through the ratio between the heights at the center - frequency of the motional sideband and of one peak of the incoherent spectrum . in this way",
    ", one gets a simple equation at second order in @xmath207 whose coefficients are determined only by the laser parameters .",
    "we remark that for larger values of @xmath207 the visibility of the motional sidebands over the mollow  type inelastic spectrum increases .",
    "this is illustrated in the inset of fig .",
    "4 .    in summary",
    ", the spectrum we have evaluated allows to gain insight into the quantum dynamics and steady state of the atom interacting with light .",
    "our results are in agreement with the dynamical picture presented in section ii .",
    "this picture is based on a clear separation between the two time scales @xmath38 , @xmath290 , on which also the validity of the perturbative expansion lies .",
    "analytical estimates and numerical checks of the validity of this coarse  grained dynamics have been presented in  @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to compare these results with the features found in the emission spectrum of a trapped two - level atom . in a two - level transition driven by a plane wave ,",
    "the incoherent spectrum has a contribution at zero order in the lamb ",
    "dicke expansion , as at this order the internal steady state of the system is characterized by non - vanishing occupation of the excited state .",
    "the features due to the mechanical effects manifest here in the motional sidebands .",
    "these are narrow resonances , whose width is the cooling rate .",
    "however , at a fixed detection angle @xmath19 the curves are fano - like profiles , whose relative height varies with @xmath19 ( while , once integrated over the solid angle of emission , have lorentz shape and are equal )  @xcite .",
    "this behaviour is an interference effect between raman processes at second order in the lamb ",
    "dicke expansion @xcite : given @xmath291 , @xmath292 ground and excited states of the dipole transition , the raman processes @xmath293 and @xmath294 is suppressed and at this order only the transitions @xmath295 occur .",
    "hence , both motional sidebands are lorentz curves of equal shape , independently of the emission angle ( which just affects the total height of the signal , according to the dipole pattern of radiation ) .",
    "thus , in this case transitions in zero order in the lamb  dicke expansion vanish because of the spatial mode structure , while light scattering occurs because of the spatial gradient of the field intensity over the center  of  mass wave packet .",
    "remarkably , in our case transitions in zero order in the lamb ",
    "dicke expansion are suppressed because of quantum interference between dipole excitation paths , and photon scattering occurs due to the phase gradient of the field over the center  of  mass wave packet .",
    "we have presented a theoretical study of the spectrum of fluorescence of a trapped atom whose internal degrees of freedom are driven in a @xmath0configuration at two photon resonance . in this system ,",
    "the atomic emission at steady state is only due to the mechanical effects of the atom  photon interaction .",
    "the spectrum has been evaluated at second order in the lamb ",
    "dicke expansion , i.e.  in the expansion of the size of the atomic wave packet over the laser wavelength .",
    "we find that the spectrum is characterized by two narrow resonances corresponding to the motional sidebands , i.e.  the stokes and anti - stokes components , and by a mollow  type inelastic spectrum , while the elastic peak is at higher order . through these properties ,",
    "several information about the quantum dynamics and steady state of the driven atom can be extracted , like the cooling rate and the temperature , and the contributions of the individual scattering processes can be identified .",
    "furthermore , for relatively large temperatures the sidebands of the elastic peak may be orders of magnitude larger than any other spectral signal , and the spectrum can be said to be solely composed of these two frequencies .",
    "our results provide an interesting insight into the underlying physics of the mechanical effects of light - atom interaction , and may contribute to on  going experiments investigating and engineering the coupling of single trapped atoms and ions with electromagnetic fields .",
