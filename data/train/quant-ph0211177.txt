    "in the context of physical reality , einstein , podolsky , and rosen ( epr )  @xcite proposed a gedankenexperiment .",
    "bohm s version  @xcite of this experiment is described as follows : suppose that two spin-@xmath0 particles with total spin zero are moving in opposite directions and that their spin components are measured by two observers . the spin component of each particle is measured in some direction by each observer .",
    "if the two measurements are performed in the same direction , the outcomes are perfectly anti - correlated in whichever direction and at however remote place they are performed .",
    "this remarkable property is known as the epr correlation .",
    "the reason for the perfect anti - correlation in any direction is that the spin - singlet state is isotropic and has no preferred direction .    in this paper , we consider bohm s version of the epr experiment in the framework of relativistic quantum theory and discuss an effect of observer s motion on the epr correlation .",
    "a number of articles  @xcite have discussed the case of a moving observer in connection with the instantaneous reduction of the state caused by the measurement in relativistic quantum theory .",
    "however , we shall not consider such a problem and concentrate on the symmetry transformation of the spin correlation under the lorentz transformation .    to address the issue of how the spin of a particle is seen from a moving observer ,",
    "we need not resort to the explicit dynamics of the particle such as the dirac equation , but only to a group - theoretical approach  @xcite .",
    "this is analogous to the fact that the transformation law of the spin under the spatial rotation is derived only from knowledge of the spatial rotation group @xmath1 .",
    "in relativistic theory , the relevant group is the poincar group @xmath2 which contains @xmath1 as a subgroup . for a massive particle ( such as an electron ) and a massless particle ( such as a photon ) ,",
    "transformation laws under the lorentz transformation are derived from the unitary representations of the poincar group .",
    "note that massless particles are entirely different from massive particles in relativistic theory since massless particles move at the speed of light and thus have no rest frame . in the massive case ,",
    "the lorentz transformation rotates the spin of a particle , known as the wigner rotation  @xcite .",
    "the angle of this rotation depends not only on the lorentz transformation but also on the momentum of the particle . on the other hand , in the massless case , the lorentz transformation rotates the plane of polarization .",
    "recently , the wigner rotation has seen a remarkable resurgence of interest in the context of the entanglement or the epr correlation in the relativistic regime  @xcite .",
    "peres , scudo , and terno  @xcite have shown that the spin entropy for a single particle is not lorentz invariant if the particle is not in the momentum eigenstate , because spin is entangled with momentum by the wigner rotation .",
    "gingrich and adami  @xcite have shown that entanglement between the spins of two particles is carried over to the entanglement between the momenta of the particles by the wigner rotation , even though the entanglement of the entire system is lorentz invariant .",
    "alsing and milburn  @xcite have considered entanglement in one of the bell states between the spins of two particles moving in opposite directions with definite momenta , and shown that it is lorentz invariant since the wigner rotation is a local unitary operation . instead of the state vector in the hilbert space , they have used a 4-component dirac spinor or a polarization vector in favor of quantum field theory .",
    "independently of their research , the authors  @xcite considered a similar situation but discussed the epr correlation rather than the entanglement using the spin - singlet state in terms of the state vector .",
    "( the entanglement is independent of the basis for the measurement , but the correlation depends on it . ) later , ahn et al .",
    "@xcite also calculated the same situation with all the bell states and obtained a conclusion on the epr correlation that contradicts our result .",
    "they concluded that the wigner rotation could cause `` a counter example for the nonlocality of the epr paradox '' .",
    "this paper is an extended and comprehensive version of ref .",
    "@xcite , discussing a possible experiment and relevance to quantum communications .",
    "we first consider two massive particles in the spin - singlet state moving in opposite directions with definite momenta , and two observers moving in the same direction at the same velocity with respect to the laboratory frame . by applying the wigner rotation ,",
    "we show that the measurement results are not perfectly anti - correlated when the two observers measure the spins in the same direction in their common rest frame .",
    "seen from the moving observers , the anti - correlation in the same direction decreases unlike the non - relativistic case . in particular , the perfect anti - correlation in every direction is not maintained in all inertial frames .",
    "the special directions along which the perfect anti - correlation is not maintained are specified by the motion of the observers and by that of the particles . we also examine the violation of bell s inequality  @xcite in this case and show that the motion of the observers _ prima facie _ decreases the degree of violation of bell s inequality if the directions of the measurement are fixed . we extend these considerations to the massless case and obtain qualitatively similar but quantitatively different results .    at first sight , the above results appear to contradict the nonlocality inherent in quantum mechanics .",
    "one might think that the quantum correlation breaks down and that local hidden variable theories are restored in the relativistic regime .",
    "however , this is not the case , of course .",
    "we explicitly show that the perfect anti - correlation is maintained in _ different _ directions and bell s inequality for an appropriate set of observables is still maximally violated .",
    "note that the entanglement is preserved under the lorentz transformation  @xcite .",
    "we emphasize that our aim is not to discuss the foundation of quantum mechanics but to explore effects of the relative motion between the sender and receiver in quantum communications that utilize the epr correlation and the violation of bell s inequality .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in order to make this paper self - contained , sections  [ sec : massive ] and [ sec : massless ] review the lorentz transformation laws for a massive particle and for a massless particle , respectively .",
    "section  [ sec : epr ] formulates relativistic epr experiments both for massive particles and for massless particles , and applies the transformation laws to them .",
    "section  [ sec : bell ] analyzes bell s inequality in the relativistic epr experiments .",
    "section  [ sec : discuss ] summarizes our results , and discusses an experimental possibility and relevance to quantum information .",
    "appendix summarizes the poincar group and our conventions .",
    "in this section , we follow ref .  @xcite to discuss the one particle states for a massive particle which furnish an irreducible representation of the poincar group .",
    "we then calculate the transformation law explicitly in a specific example .",
    "first , we consider the rest frame of the massive particle , since the spin is most conveniently identified in the rest frame .",
    "the four - momentum of the particle with mass @xmath3 then becomes the rest momentum , @xmath4 in this frame , the state @xmath5 is specified in terms of the eigenvalues of the hamiltonian @xmath6 , the momentum operator @xmath7 , and the @xmath8-component of the total angular momentum operator @xmath9 as @xmath10 for a spatial rotation @xmath11 , there is a corresponding unitary operator @xmath12 which can be represented by a @xmath13-dimensional unitary matrix @xmath14 , @xmath15 where @xmath16 is an integer or a half - integer and @xmath17 .",
    "note that the momentum on the right - hand side is also the rest momentum @xmath18 since the spatial rotation group @xmath1 leaves @xmath18 invariant .",
    "that is , the particle remains at rest if the frame is rotated spatially .",
    "the total angular momentum is equal to the spin in the rest frame because the orbital angular momentum is absent .",
    "therefore , @xmath16 is the spin of the particle and @xmath19 its @xmath8-component .",
    "we next consider the general frame , where the four - momentum of the particle is @xmath20 we obtain this momentum by performing a standard lorentz transformation @xmath21 on the rest momentum ( [ stdk ] ) , @xmath22 an explicit form of @xmath21 is written as @xmath23 where @xmath24 note that the inverse matrix @xmath25 of @xmath21 can be obtained by replacing @xmath26 by @xmath27 , i.e. , @xmath28 .",

    "unlike in the rest frame , the label @xmath19 denotes not the eigenvalue of @xmath34 but the @xmath8-component of the spin .",
    "the 3-dimensional delta function @xmath37 is not lorentz invariant .",
    "instead , @xmath38 is an invariant delta function with the mass shell condition , @xmath39 the normalization of the state is thus chosen to be @xmath40    the state defined in eq .",
    "( [ defp ] ) transforms under the lorentz transformation @xmath41 as @xmath42 where @xmath43{^\\mu_{\\phantom{\\mu}\\nu}}\\label{defw}\\ ] ] is called wigner rotation .",

    "( [ deflp ] ) that the wigner rotation leaves the rest four - momentum ( [ stdk ] ) invariant , @xmath44 this means that the wigner rotation is an element of the spatial rotation group @xmath1 .",
    "we can view this wigner rotation as follows : we perform the lorentz transformation @xmath21 on the rest frame to obtain a moving frame 1 , and then operate the lorentz transformation @xmath41 to obtain another moving frame 2 , as depicted by fig .",
    "we return to the rest frame by further performing the lorentz transformation @xmath45 on the moving frame 2 .    the wigner rotation . ]",
    "however , the resultant rest frame is different from the original one by the wigner rotation as indicated by eq .",

    "( [ rotj ] ) , we find that @xmath46 note that the spin part is transformed in a manner depending on the momentum @xmath47 , in general .",
    "this dependence plays a crucial role in later discussions on the epr correlation . on the other hand ,",
    "the transformation of the spin part under the spatial rotation is independent of @xmath47 .",
    "in fact , when @xmath41 is a spatial rotation @xmath11 , the wigner rotation @xmath48 reduces to @xmath11 itself for all @xmath47  @xcite .",
    "that is , under spatial rotations , the state @xmath36 transforms in the same way as in non - relativistic quantum mechanics , @xmath49    let us find the transformation law ( [ trans ] ) in a specific example .",

    "while it seems not feasible to move detectors ( such as the stern - gerlach apparatus ) at relativistic velocities , we may move the epr source . by special relativity , moving detectors are equivalent to a moving epr source ( see fig .  [ fig6 ] )",
