    "in previous work , we developed a model which generates the intrinsic null geometry of an event horizon with the `` pair - of - pants '' structure characteristic of a binary black hole merger  @xcite . in this paper , we extend this approach to determine all extrinsic curvature properties of such horizons , thus providing a complete stand - alone description of the event horizon of binary black holes .",
    "we apply this work to study the event horizon of a head - on collision of black holes using a sequence of models which embraces not only the perturbative regime of the close approximation  @xcite , where the merger takes place in the distant past , but also includes the highly nonlinear regime . in the perturbative regime",
    "the individual black holes merge in an interior region of the horizon , corresponding to the region of the schwarzschild event horizon lying inside the @xmath0 bifurcation sphere .",
    "but we show how dramatically nonlinear effects can push the merger into the exterior portion of the horizon .    beyond the investigation of the horizon geometry of a black hole collision ,",
    "the major motivation for this work is to provide the null data necessary to compute the emitted gravitational wave by means of a characteristic evolution of the exterior spacetime . in the cauchy problem ,",
    "the necessary data on a spacelike hypersurface are the intrinsic metric and extrinsic curvature , subject to constraints . on a null hypersurface , such as an event horizon ,",
    "the situation is quite different .",
    "the necessary null data consist of the conformal part of the intrinsic ( degenerate ) metric , which can be given freely as a function of the affine parameter .",
    "then the surface area of the horizon is determined , via an ordinary differential equation along the null rays ( the raychaudhuri equation ) , in terms of an integration constant supplied by the mass of the final black hole .",
    "similarly , all extrinsic curvature components of the horizon are determined by ordinary differential equations in terms of integration constants supplied by the final black hole .",
    "whereas in principle the intrinsic conformal geometry is the only data on the horizon necessary for the characteristic initial value problem , in practice the surface area and extrinsic curvature are essential to supply the start - up data for the implementation of a characteristic evolution code , such as the pitt null code  @xcite .",
    "the main results of this paper concern the understanding of the nonlinear nature of the underlying ordinary differential equations from geometrical , physical and numerical points of view .    given the intrinsic geometry and extrinsic curvature of the horizon , the strategy behind the characteristic approach to the computation of the emitted wave has been outlined elsewhere  @xcite .",
    "it consists of two evolution stages based upon the double null initial value problem . referring to fig .",
    "[ fig : strategy ] , the necessity of two stages results from the disconnected nature of the two null hypersurfaces on which boundary conditions must be satisfied : ( i ) the event horizon @xmath1 , where binary black hole data is prescribed , and ( ii ) past null infinity @xmath2 , where ingoing radiation must be absent , at least in the late stage to the future of the hypersurface @xmath3 which is decoupled from the formation of the individual black holes . rather than directly attempting to solve this mixed version of a characteristic initial value problem , the stage i evolution",
    "is based upon two intersecting null hypersurfaces consisting of the event horizon , where binary black hole data is prescribed , and an ingoing null hypersurface @xmath4 approximating future null infinity @xmath5 , where data corresponding to no _ outgoing _ radiation is prescribed .",
    "the characteristic evolution then proceeds _ backward in time _ along ingoing null hypersurfaces extending to @xmath6 to determine the spacetime exterior to an ingoing null hypersurface @xmath3 . as indicated in the figure",
    ", the evolution terminates at @xmath3 because the horizon splits into two individual black holes .",
    "this stage i solution is the _ advanced _ solution to the problem in the sense that radiation from @xmath2 is absorbed by the black holes but no outgoing wave is radiated to @xmath5 .",
    "stage ii provides the _ retarded _ solution , where outgoing but no ingoing radiation is present outside @xmath3 , by running forward in time a double null evolution based upon the intersecting null hypersurfaces @xmath3 , where the stage i data is prescribed , and an outgoing null hypersurface @xmath7 approximating @xmath2 , where data corresponding to no ingoing radiation is prescribed to the future of @xmath3 .",
    "the stage ii evolution produces the retarded solution for the spacetime outside the world tube @xmath3 .",
    "the approach is a nonlinear version of the standard method of determining the retarded solution @xmath8 of the linear wave equation @xmath9 , with source @xmath10 , by first finding the advanced solution @xmath11 and then superimposing the source - free solution @xmath12 . in the nonlinear case , where standard green function techniques can not be used to define retarded and advanced solutions ,",
    "they can be defined by requiring the absence of radiation at @xmath5 ( retarded ) or @xmath2 ( advanced ) . in the present case , the data on the world tube @xmath3 represents the interior source which has led to the formation of the individual black holes .",
    "( in a normal physical context , the source consists of two stars undergoing gravitational collapse but in a purely vacuum scenario imploding gravitational waves can play the role of the matter . ) the justification of this two stage approach is that it reduces to the standard linear method in the close approximation where the geometry can be regarded as a perturbation of a schwarzschild background .",
    "a purely perturbative characteristic treatment of the close approximation using the characteristic approach has been carried out in a separate study and the advanced solution has been successfully computed  @xcite .    we intend to carry out the `` backward in time '' evolution using the pitt null code  @xcite , which is based upon the bondi - sachs version of the characteristic initial value problem  @xcite .",
    "the present code is designed to evolve forward in time along a foliation of spacetime by outgoing null hypersurfaces . in this paper , in order to apply it to the backward in time evolution of a black hole horizon , we describe the merger of two black holes in the time reversed scenario of a white hole horizon , in which the black hole merger is now represented by the fission of a white hole .",
    "the post - merger era of the black hole horizon then corresponds to the pre - fission era of the white hole ; and the proposed backward in time evolution of the black hole horizon to determine the exterior spacetime corresponds to a forward in time evolution of the white hole horizon .",
    "our algorithm provides the complete white hole data necessary to carry out this evolution .",
    "the specific application in this paper is to the axisymmetric head - on collision of two equal mass black holes .",
    "however , the algorithm is capable of generating intrinsic geometry and extrinsic curvature of an arbitrary event horizon , including the case of inspiraling binary black holes of non - equal mass . in previous studies of the intrinsic geometry of non - axisymmetric horizons",
    ", the approach has revealed new features of the generic collision of two black holes , such as an intermediate toroidal phase which precedes the merger  @xcite .",
    "here we apply the algorithm to gain new insight into the global behavior of the extrinsic curvature properties of the head - on collision .",
    "the material in the paper divides into two types : ( i ) general features of a binary horizon and ( ii ) the calculation of the null data on the horizon necessary to initiate the pitt code .",
    "material of the first type , which describes how a binary horizon deviates from the close approximation in the nonlinear regime , appears in secs .",
    "[ sec : horstruct ] and  [ sec : confmod ] - [ sec : results ] and can be read independently .",
    "this material is described most conveniently in terms of sachs coordinates , introduced in sec .",
    "[ sec : horstruct ] .",
    "material of the second type involves the transformation from sachs to bondi - sachs coordinates , introduced in sec .",
    "[ sec : bondisachs ]",
    ". this material supplies all data necessary to compute , using the pitt code , the fully nonlinear merger to ringdown wave form , which will be the subject of future work .",
    "the details of implementing the horizon data algorithm as a finite difference code are given in the appendixes .",
    "an independent code designed for an axisymmetric horizon is also described and has been used as an independent test of the full code .",
    "we retain the conventions of our previous papers  @xcite , with only minor changes in notation where noted in the text . for brevity",
    ", we frequently use the notation @xmath13 to denote partial derivatives and @xmath14 to denote retarded time derivatives .",
    "the evolution of the exterior spacetime by the pitt code proceeds along a family of outgoing null hypersurfaces .",
    "the characteristic initial value problem for the evolution requires an inner boundary condition which can be set either on a timelike world tube or , as a limiting case , on a null world tube . here",
    "we choose the inner boundary to be the null world tube representing a white hole horizon @xmath15 .",
    "the white hole horizon pinches off in the future where its generators either caustic or cross each other ( such as at the vertex of a null cone ) . as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : whole ] , we introduce ( i ) an affine null coordinate @xmath16 along the generators of @xmath15 , which foliates @xmath15 into cross sections @xmath17 and labels the corresponding outgoing null hypersurfaces @xmath18 emanating from the foliation ; ( ii ) angular coordinates @xmath19 which are constant both along the generators of @xmath15 and along the outgoing rays and ( iii ) an affine parameter @xmath20 along the outgoing rays normalized by @xmath21 , with @xmath22 on @xmath15 . in the resulting @xmath23 coordinates , the metric takes the form @xmath24 the contravariant components are given by @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "in addition , we set @xmath29 , where @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is some standard choice of unit sphere metric .",
    "these coordinates were first introduced by sachs to formulate the double - null characteristic initial value problem  @xcite .",
    "the bondi - sachs coordinate system  @xcite used in the pitt code differs by the use of a surface area coordinate @xmath32 along the outgoing cones rather than the affine parameter @xmath20 .",
    "however , because the horizon is not a surface of constant @xmath32 , except in the special case of an `` isolated horizon ''  @xcite , it is advantageous to first determine the necessary data in terms of an affine parameter and later transform to the @xmath32-coordinate .",
    "the requirement that @xmath15 be null implies that @xmath33 on @xmath15 .",
    "there is gauge freedom on @xmath15 that we fix by choosing the shift so that @xmath34 is tangent to the generators , implying that @xmath35 on @xmath15 ; and by choosing the lapse so that @xmath16 is an affine parameter , implying that @xmath36 on @xmath15 .",
    "we adopt these choices throughout the paper , and our results generally hold only on @xmath37 ( @xmath38 ) and when these conditions are satisfied . later , in sec .  [ sec : headon ] , we also fix the affine freedom in @xmath16 by specifying it on an initial slice @xmath39 of @xmath15 , which is located at an early time approximating the asymptotic equilibrium of the white hole at past time infinity @xmath40 .",

    "the projection @xmath48 has gauge freedom corresponding to the choice of affine parameter @xmath16 .",

    "as the horizon evolves , the surface area @xmath32 decreases along all rays but , for the axisymmetric and reflection symmetric fission considered here , it decreases fastest along the equatorial rays where the pinch - off first occurs .",
    "the outward expansion measured by @xmath371 also initially decreases along all rays , although this process can be reversed by the growth of nonlinear terms , as indicated by the ray - averaged behavior governed by eq .",
    "( [ eq : intrlams ] ) . in the close approximation",
    ", the expansion goes to zero along all rays before the horizon pinches off , i.e. the crotch at the center of the pair of pants is hidden behind a mts .",
    "the crucial question in the nonlinear regime is whether the horizon can pinch off before the formation of a mts , i.e. whether the crotch is bare .",
    "for the related question in terms of a bondi boundary rather than a mts , the issue is who wins the race toward 0 , the radius @xmath32 or the expansion @xmath372 along some ray .",
    "we conduct this race for each of a sequence of models in the range @xmath373 , with the remaining parameters fixed at @xmath374 , @xmath375 , @xmath376 , @xmath237 and @xmath377 ( just above the minimum value of @xmath210 allowed by regularity of the conformal model for this range of eccentricities ) .",
    "we monitor the minimum value over the sphere of the expansion of the outgoing null rays on the horizon , and of the bondi radius of the horizon .",

    "however , the deviation of the expansion from a pure linear - in - time behavior is noticeable and its deviation from spherical symmetry as a function of ray is also noticeable in the full numerical data .",
    "( the angular behavior of the relevant geometrical quantities is discussed more fully below . ) as @xmath240 increases to @xmath385 in panel @xmath386 , both the radius and the expansion show markedly nonlinear behavior but the expansion still readily wins the race toward zero . however , its margin of victory gets smaller with increasing @xmath240 as manifest in panel @xmath387 for @xmath388 in which the race is nearly a tie .    for @xmath389 ,",

    "the radius makes a sudden plunge to zero to win the race before the expansion has undergone any appreciable change .",
    "this is a dramatic nonlinear effect .",
    "although the radius and expansion begin the race at the same starting point ( in rescaled units ) , the expansion begins with a flying start ( its initial slope in the figures ) and gets accelerated by linear effects whereas the radius starts from rest and only gets accelerated by quadratic or higher nonlinearities .",

    "figure  [ fig : ricci5 ] shows that the curvature scalar @xmath86 of the conformal horizon metric @xmath67 increases from its unit sphere value @xmath403 in the region near the poles and decreases in the region near the equator .",
    "this is what would be expected for the conformal geometry of the minkowski time slices @xmath404 of of the collapsing prolate wave front which seeds the model .",
    "however , it is important to bear in mind that the quantities in figs .",
    "[ fig : rho5]-[fig : shearp5 ] refer to the curved space affine time slices @xmath405 .",

    "although the time dependence of all quantities in the model is analytic , there is an apparent `` crease '' at @xmath407 in the surface plots of the ricci scalar , twist and shear which results from a rapid change in the quantity @xmath408 governing the relative minkowski and curved space affine times . for models with larger @xmath240 , the angular dependences are qualitatively similar but the time dependence is more dramatic",
    "expressed now in terms of a black hole merger , this work has traced the horizon structure of a head - on black hole collision from the close approximation to the nonlinear regime . it has revealed dramatic time dependence in the intrinsic and extrinsic curvature properties of the horizon in the extreme nonlinear regime .",
    "the results suggest two classes of binary black hole space - times depending upon whether the crotch in the standard trouser picture is protected , in the sense that it lies inside a marginally anti - trapped surface on the horizon , or bare . only in the bare case",
    "is it possible that the black holes are formed by either the collapse of matter or the implosion gravitational waves ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : strategy ] ) originating in an initially nonsingular space - time .",
    "the results pave the way for an application of the pitt code to calculate the fully nonlinear wave forms emitted in the merger to ringdown phase .",
    "it remains to be seen in future work whether the dramatic time dependence in the merger stage is responsible for equally dramatic wave forms .",
    "while the numerical results presented in this paper are for the axially symmetric case , the codes are not restricted to any symmetry .",
