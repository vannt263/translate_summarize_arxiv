    "recent years have seen a renaissance in the study of scattering amplitudes .",
    "this has been driven in part by the need for reliable next - to - leading - order qcd calculations for experiments at the large hadron collider .",
    "it has also been driven by the realization of profound hidden structures in scattering amplitudes whose full import remains to be unraveled .",
    "a key idea for many of the advances has been that new amplitudes should be constructed using only simpler on - shell amplitudes  @xcite , avoiding unphysical gauge - dependent quantities in intermediate steps . the on - shell viewpoint has revealed a number of remarkable structures in gauge theories , including a description of amplitudes in terms of curves in twistor space  @xcite , and a duality between color and kinematics  @xcite .",
    "maximally supersymmetric planar amplitudes have an even richer structure , for example all - order resummations of planar amplitudes valid at both weak and strong coupling  @xcite , new symmetries  @xcite and a grassmannian structure  @xcite . on the practical side , on -",
    "shell methods have allowed ever more complex calculations in next - to - leading - order qcd  @xcite , supersymmetric gauge theories  @xcite and supergravity theories to be carried out  @xcite .",
    "the unitarity method  @xcite gives a means for constructing complete loop amplitudes directly from on - shell tree amplitudes .",
    "these methods are efficient and display a relatively tame growth in complexity with increasing number of external particles or loops , especially when compared to traditional feynman - diagrammatic approaches . with this approach",
    ", it is usually advantageous to simplify the input tree amplitudes as much as possible prior to applying them in loop calculations .",
    "a key tool for simplifying massless tree amplitudes strictly in four dimensions has been spinor helicity  @xcite",
    ". however , if we use dimensional regularization or any form of massive regularization , massless four - dimensional spinor helicity techniques are no longer directly applicable within the loops .",
    "in this paper we will describe a unitarity - based approach using the six - dimensional spinor - helicity formalism of cheung and oconnell  @xcite to avoid these limitations . as in four dimensions ,",
    "the six - dimensional spinor - helicity formalism offers a relatively compact representation of amplitudes , making manifest little - group properties .",
    "here we are concerned with two basic applications : one - loop qcd amplitudes and multiloop scattering amplitudes in @xmath0 super - yang - mills ( sym ) theory .",
    "although related , there are differences in the technical demands of the two cases . in particular , the qcd amplitudes have both ultraviolet and infrared divergences , while the @xmath0 amplitudes have only the latter .",
    "all these divergences need to be regularized . on the other hand",
    ", the supersymmetric theory needs an efficient formalism to organize its spectrum of states , especially at high - loop orders , in much the same way as done in four dimensions using an on - shell superspace  @xcite .",
    "as we discuss , both aspects can be addressed using six - dimensional spinor helicity .    in the past , the main bottleneck for carrying out next - to - leading - order qcd calculations .",
    "has been the difficulty of evaluating one - loop amplitudes  @xcite .",
    "the unitarity method offers a universal solution to this difficulty that scales well with the number of external legs .",
    "any contributions which can be captured by four - dimensional techniques  the so called `` cut - constructible pieces ''  may be computed efficiently using four - dimensional helicity states in the cuts  @xcite .",
    "the remaining rational contributions tend to be the most complex ( and time consuming ) parts of calculations , though there are a number of techniques for dealing with such pieces . in the bootstrap approach ,",
    "the rational pieces are constructed by on - shell recursion in four dimensions  @xcite .",
    "another approach uses @xmath2-dimensional generalized unitarity  @xcite .",
    "a six - dimensional unitarity procedure for any one - loop qcd amplitude has been given in ref .",
    "@xcite using the on - shell procedure of reducing integrals in ref .",
    "a related approach makes use of the relation between massive states in four dimensions and those in extra dimensions to reduce the integrals obtained from unitarity cuts  @xcite .",
    "the six - dimensional helicity approach described here is well suited for either of the latter two approaches for carrying out integral reductions .",
    "a convenient means for doing so is by reexpressing the spinors of our six - dimensional approach as four - dimensional spinors and what are effectively mass parameters .",
    "this gives expressions similar to those used in badger s four - dimensional massive approach  @xcite .",
    "we illustrate this using some simple one - loop four - gluon contributions to qcd amplitudes  @xcite .",
    "we will also consider multiloop @xmath0 sym amplitudes . to set this up , we make use of the six - dimensional on - shell superspace constructed by two of the authors and siegel ( dhs )  @xcite .",
    "general constructions of on - shell superspaces have been discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite . in strictly four dimensions",
    "we have a well - developed on - shell superspace  @xcite for tracking contributions from different states in the multiplet .",
    "however , as already noted above this leaves open the question of whether contributions are missed by using four - dimensional momenta in the unitarity cuts or in the recent bcfw constructions of planar loop integrands  @xcite .",
    "this is especially important when constructing amplitudes for use in @xmath3 studies , but even in dimensionally regularized four - dimensional expressions , when divergences are present , there can be nonvanishing contributions from terms that vanish naively in four dimensions .",
    "this becomes more important as the loop order or the number of external legs grows , allowing for a greater number of potentially problematic terms . besides terms with explicit dependence on extra - dimensional momenta",
    ", such terms can be formed from antisymmetric combinations momenta which vanish in four dimensions .",
    "for example , we know that dimensionally regularized two - loop six - point amplitudes in @xmath0 sym theory have such terms  @xcite . in theories with fewer supersymmetries , such terms occur with more frequency , and , for example , appear in one - loop qcd amplitudes  @xcite .",
    "to illustrate the supersymmetric formalism , we first describe the three - particle cut of the planar two - loop four - point @xmath0 amplitude  @xcite , before turning to the rather nontrivial case of four - loop four - point amplitudes in this theory , including the nonplanar terms .",
    "the latter amplitude has recently been computed  @xcite , using mainly four - dimensional techniques .",
    "direct calculations of four - point gluon amplitudes in @xmath4 sym in @xmath5 dimensions , which upon dimensional reduction gives @xmath0 sym theory , confirm that all terms are captured by calculating directly in four dimensions , through three loops . at four loops ,",
    "similar @xmath5 checks have been performed in the planar case , up to a mild assumption that no term has a worse power count than the amplitude  @xcite . however , in the case of nonplanar contributions , there is no complete check that the expressions built using four - dimensional momenta in the cuts are complete , although a number of strong consistency checks have been performed  @xcite . in this paper",
    "we confirm that the expressions for the amplitudes of ref .",
    "@xcite are valid for @xmath1 , as expected .",
    "the higher - dimensional viewpoint offers a simple way to introduce a gauge - invariant massive regulator .",
    "if we do not integrate the loop momenta over the extra - dimensional momenta , but integrate over only a four - dimensional subspace , we obtain a massive infrared regulator , where the masses are effectively the extra - dimensional momenta .",
    "this allows us to connect to the massive higgs regulator recently developed by alday , henn , plefka and schuster  @xcite , which offers a number of advantages over dimensional regularization for planar @xmath0 sym amplitudes .",
    "although it seems likely that terms proportional to the mass are suppressed as @xmath6  @xcite , such mass terms are important for studies of the coulomb branch of @xmath0 sym theory . in many cases it is straightforward to convert the previously determined dimensionally regularized massless integrands to massive forms  @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , one would like a means for obtaining or confirming such integrands directly via unitarity to ensure their reliability or for deriving regulators valid for the nonplanar case .",
    "the six - dimensional on - shell superspace approach gives us a convenient means for doing this .    at four points , the integrands of @xmath0 sym integrands",
    "do not depend explicitly on the space - time dimension , but only implicitly through lorentz dot products , as already noted in refs .",
    "@xcite and explicitly confirmed here at four loops .",
    "this suggests that the dual conformal properties , which impose strong constraints on the form of the integrands in four dimensions , will impose similar constraints in higher dimensions .",
    "in addition , dual conformal invariance can be extended to the massive higgs - regulated case  @xcite .",
    "these facts suggest that the dual conformal properties of planar @xmath0 sym amplitudes should have extensions away from four dimensions .",
    "motivated by this , we write down generators for dual conformal transformations in six dimensions and propose transformation properties , which are straightforward to check at four points using the known expressions .",
    "finally , we also note that with the six - dimensional helicity formalism contributions to amplitudes factorize into products of chiral - conjugate pairs .",
    "since it holds in all cuts which decompose loop amplitudes into sums of products of tree amplitudes , it seems reasonable that it holds at loop level as well . although this structure is somewhat reminiscent of the recently discovered double - copy structure of gravity - diagram numerators  @xcite , as we shall see , there are a number of significant differences .",
    "nevertheless , it can help simplify calculations .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in we review the six - dimensional helicity formalism , showing the connection to four - dimensional helicity , briefly review the unitarity method in the context of this formalism , and discuss modifications needed for obtaining massive regulators .",
    "then in we review bcfw recursion in six dimensions , before describing the chiral - conjugate property . in",
    "we turn to our first examples , which are one - loop four - point amplitudes of qcd . in",
    "we review an on - shell superspace compatible with six - dimensional helicity .",
    "we give special care to the three - point amplitude since new variables are needed .",
    "we also develop the necessary building blocks for high - loop unitarity cuts using on - shell recursion . then in we turn to high - loop applications , using the two - loop four - point amplitude as an example to illustrate the methods before turning to higher loops . in",
    "we then discuss an extension of dual conformal properties to six dimensions .",
    "we give our comments and prospects for future developments in .",
    "we include two appendices , one showing the analytic results of a nontrivial cut of the four - loop four - point amplitude and the other collecting auxiliary variables  @xcite needed for defining three - point tree amplitudes .",
    "we begin by summarizing cheung and oconnell s six - dimensional spinor - helicity formalism  @xcite . to make the connection to four - dimensional spinor techniques more transparent",
    ", we choose to write the six - dimensional spinors in terms of the more conventional four - dimensional ones  @xcite .",
    "this form is particularly well suited for carrying out loop calculations in dimensional regularization , as needed for qcd computations .",
    "it also allows us to interpret the extra - dimensional contributions in terms of masses .",
    "before we review the six - dimensional helicity formalism , we state our conventions of spinors in four dimensions .",
    "we follow ref .",
    "@xcite and work in a weyl basis for the spinors such that @xmath7 .",
    "we use the bra - ket notation for the chiral spinors and their contractions , @xmath8 with @xmath9 , @xmath10 . for further details",
    "we refer to the above - mentioned review .. ]    in six dimensions , a vector can be expressed using the spinor representation of so(5,1 ) , @xmath11 where @xmath12 are fundamental representation indices of the covering group , su@xmath13(4 ) . here",
    "the @xmath14 and @xmath15 are antisymmetric 4@xmath164 matrices which play a role analogous to the pauli matrices in four dimensions .",
    "further details and explicit forms of the matrices may be found in appendix a of ref .",
    "the dirac equation for weyl spinors in six dimensions can be written as , @xmath17 and gives rise to two independent solutions for each of the weyl spinors , @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "each solution is labeled by indices @xmath20 or @xmath21 , which are spinor indices of the little group so(4 ) , corresponding to su(2)@xmath16su(2 ) .",
    "we may lower and raise the little group su(2 ) indices @xmath22 with the matrices @xmath23 and @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 , @xmath27 , for this case as well .",

    "the polarization vectors can be written as  @xcite , @xmath35)^{-1 }                        =                 ( \\langle p^a | k_{\\db}])^{-1 }               \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2 } } [ k_\\db | \\tsigma^\\mu|p_\\da ]             \\ , , \\label{polar}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the @xmath20 and @xmath36 indices are labels for the four polarization states .",
    "as for the four - dimensional case , we have a null reference momentum @xmath37 to define the states . for each of the weyl spinors @xmath38 and @xmath39 the indices @xmath20 and @xmath36 label two helicity states respectively .",

    "the polarization vectors are transverse , and a redefinition of the reference spinor can be shown to correspond to a gauge transformation .    given the proliferation of indices , we now summarize the indices that appear . for four - dimensional objects",
    "the indices are , @xmath42 for six - dimensional objects the indices are , @xmath43 the six - dimensional spinors will be identifiable because they carry su(2)@xmath16su(2 ) little - group helicity indices .      for many purposes , it is convenient to express the six - dimensional spinors in terms of the better - known four - dimensional ones  @xcite .",
    "this allows us to define a physical four - dimensional subspace , and identify states polarized within and transverse to it .",
    "viewed from four dimensions , the six - dimensional massless condition is that of a massive four - dimensional vector , @xmath44 where @xmath45 denotes a momentum vector keeping only the first four components .",
    "the masses are related to the fifth and sixth components of the momentum , @xmath46 where we have chosen the masses to be complex , since these will be the natural combinations appearing in six - dimensional spinors when decomposed into four - dimensional ones .",
    "in general , massive momenta can be expressed in terms of two pairs of four - dimensional spinors , here denoted by @xmath47 and @xmath48 , via , @xmath49 where , @xmath50 treating the six - dimensional spinors @xmath51 and @xmath52 as @xmath53 matrices , the six - dimensional massless spinors can then be expressed in terms of the above massless four - dimensional spinors via , @xmath54 the two columns in @xmath51 and @xmath52 correspond to the little - group index @xmath20 and @xmath21 taking value @xmath55 or @xmath56 respectively .",
    "this particular embedding of the four - dimensional spinors is constrained by the explicit form of the @xmath14 matrices used here . using this",

    "if we choose momenta which lie in the four - dimensional subspace @xmath59 , the spinors simplify to , @xmath60 so that the six - dimensional spinors reduce to four - dimensional spinors .",
    "we may also relate the six - dimensional polarization vectors ( [ polar ] ) to four - dimensional ones . with four - dimensional reference spinors embedded as the above momenta ,",
    "the states with @xmath61 either @xmath62 or @xmath63 correspond to positive and negative helicity states respectively .",
    "the mixed labels @xmath64 and @xmath65 appear as scalars from the four - dimensional point of view . of course",
    ", the particular map between six - dimensional quantum numbers and helicities depends on the explicit embedding of four - dimensional spinors in the six - dimensional space .      as usual",
    ", in this paper we will work with color - ordered amplitudes  @xcite .",

    "this property is manifest in .",
    "the three - point amplitude is a bit trickier .",
    "naively , the amplitude should contain an inverse of @xmath69 $ ] which would be ill - defined because @xmath70 $ ] vanishes for three - point kinematics .",
    "the solution worked out by cheung and oconnell is to introduce two - component objects @xmath71 and @xmath72 . in terms of these ,",
    "the three - point amplitude is given by , @xmath73 where , @xmath74 the definitions of the @xmath75 and @xmath76 objects may be found in ref .",
    "@xcite and are summarized here in .",
    "a striking property that can be observed in the three- and four - point amplitudes ( [ fourgluontree ] ) and ( [ threepointamplitude ] ) is that they contain pairs of chiral - conjugate factors .",
    "in particular , for the four - gluon case , both chiral @xmath77 and antichiral @xmath78 $ ] factors appear in the numerator .",
    "similarly , the fermionic amplitude ( [ twoquarktwogluontree ] ) breaks up into a chiral and an antichiral factor .",
    "the modern unitarity method constructs loop amplitudes directly from on - shell tree amplitudes  @xcite , by combining unitarity cuts into complete expressions for amplitudes .",
    "the most convenient cuts generally are those that reduce the loop amplitude integrands into a sum of products of tree amplitudes , @xmath79 to construct the full amplitude , we can apply a merging procedure for combining cuts  @xcite . for more complicated cases , it is best to build an ansatz first in terms of some arbitrary parameters .",
    "the arbitrary parameters are then determined by comparing the cuts of the ansatz against the generalized unitarity cuts ( [ cuts ] ) .",
    "if an inconsistency is found , the ansatz is not general enough and must be enlarged . in four dimensions ,",
    "a particularly simple set of cuts to evaluate is those with the maximal numbers of cut propagators  @xcite .",
    "often it is convenient to build the ansatz for the amplitude by starting with generalizations of these types of maximal cuts and then systematically relaxing the cut conditions one at a time  @xcite .",
    "this approach , known as the method of maximal cuts , offers a systematic procedure for obtaining complete amplitudes , including nonplanar contributions , at any loop order in massless theories .",
    "one can carry out cut calculations either analytically or numerically comparing to a target ansatz at high precision .",
    "an important concept is `` spanning cuts '' , or a complete set of cuts for determining an amplitude .",
    "for the color - ordered one - loop four - point amplitude a spanning set is the usual @xmath80 and @xmath81 channel two - particle cuts .",
    "more generally , spanning cuts are determined by requiring that all potential terms that can contribute , including contact terms , can be detected by the cuts .",
    "in we use such a spanning set of cuts to confirm the six - dimensional validity of the complete four - loop four - point amplitude of @xmath0 sym theory , calculated in refs .",
    "@xcite using mostly four - dimensional methods .",
    "one of the key ingredients in evaluating unitarity cuts is to have kinematics that satisfies all cut conditions . at one loop , for explanatory purposes",
    "it is much more convenient to use analytic solutions of the cut conditions , as we do in , while at higher loops , numerical solutions are generally easier to use .",
    "one - loop analytic solutions for the on - shell conditions for massless and massive cases have been discussed previously in refs .",
    "@xcite .      for @xmath0 sym theory in four dimensions , one can use a massive regulator , because the theory is only infrared divergent and not ultraviolet divergent . for planar amplitudes ,",
    "a convenient massive higgs regulator was recently proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite for use in this theory .",
    "this regulator has the advantage of preserving the dual conformal invariance and also of leading to integrals that are much simpler to evaluate than their dimensionally regularized counterparts .    in general",
    ", we can instead view a massively regulated amplitude as a higher - dimensional one , but where we do not carry out the loop momentum integrations over the extra - dimensional components .",
    "this meshes well with our six - dimensional helicity implementation of the unitarity method .",
    "the gauge invariance of this construction is guaranteed by the gauge invariance of the constituent tree amplitudes appearing in the unitarity cuts . to implement a massive regulator",
    ", we simply interpret the extra components in terms of masses , @xmath82 , taking on definite values that are not integrated .",
    "the key constraints on the allowed choices are that the underlying extra - dimensional components must satisfy the usual momentum conservation constraints and that all particles remain massless from the six - dimensional viewpoint . from the four - dimensional viewpoint ,",
    "the on - shell condition is then , @xmath83 . as emphasized in ref .",
    "@xcite , one particularly effective choice for planar amplitudes is to take a uniform mass in the outermost loop , while keeping all other legs massless .    in many cases ,",
    "conversion of massless dimensionally regularized results to massive ones is straightforward  @xcite .",
    "however , in general , one would like to derive or confirm massively regulated integrands directly from unitarity cuts .",
    "in particular , our confirmation in that the functional form of the four - point four - loop amplitude is unchanged between four and six dimensions ensures that the straightforward conversion of this amplitude to a massively regulated form is compatible with unitarity . for six- and higher - point amplitudes ,",
    "we know that the situation is a bit more complicated , because the higher - dimensional integrands contain additional pieces not detectable in four - dimensional massless cuts .",
    "although such terms are expected to vanish as @xmath84 even after integration , they would be needed for studies of the coulomb phase of the theory where the mass is kept finite .",
    "as seen in , three- and four - point tree amplitudes contain a pair of chiral - conjugate factors .",
    "how general is this ? to answer this we turn to bcfw recursion relations  @xcite , which offer a means for constructing tree amplitudes in a form where we can exploit the six - dimensional helicity techniques .",
    "it also provides a convenient means for generating tree amplitudes needed in the unitarity cuts .",
    "the bcfw shift using six - dimensional spinor helicity was given in ref .",
    "@xcite , and the supersymmetric version in  @xcite . here",
    "we give a brief summary and the relevant bosonic shifts .",
    "we begin by picking two external lines , say @xmath85 as special , and deform them by a null vector proportional to a complex parameter @xmath86 , @xmath87 where @xmath88 is a null vector satisfying @xmath89 .",
    "these conditions ensure that the deformed momenta remain on - shell , @xmath90 , and the overall momentum conservation of the amplitude is unaltered .",
    "since a tree amplitude is a rational function of momenta with no more than a single pole in any given kinematic invariant , this deformation will result in a complex function with only simple poles in @xmath86 .",
    "each pole in @xmath86 will correspond to a propagator that is a sum of a subset of external momenta that includes only one of the shifted momenta , @xmath91 the location of the pole is given by solving the on - shell condition @xmath92 , @xmath93 as in common usage , we denote the shifted momenta evaluated at the value of @xmath86 locating a pole with a hatted symbol `` @xmath94 '' , e.g. @xmath95 .    if a shifted amplitude vanishes as @xmath96 , then standard complex variable theory implies that it is uniquely determined by its residues in @xmath86 . for @xmath97 dimensions , it is straightforward to find choices of shifts where this property holds for yang - mills theories  @xcite .",
    "the poles correspond to configurations where propagators go on shell and where the amplitude factorizes into a product of lower - point amplitudes .",
    "each residue is then simply a sum of products of two lower - point tree amplitudes on either side of the propagator , with the shifted momenta evaluated at the location of the pole .",
    "if legs 1 and 2 are shifted , the bcfw recursion relation gives us the unshifted amplitude as , @xmath98 where @xmath99 and @xmath100 are lower - point tree amplitudes on the left and right sides of the propagator and are evaluated at shifted momenta with @xmath101 .",
    "the first sum in the above equation is over all diagrams that produce poles , while the second is over all helicity states that cross the internal leg @xmath102 .    in six dimensions ,",
    "the conditions @xmath103 can be solved by choosing @xmath88 to be proportional to the polarization of line 1 , @xmath104 , and choosing the reference spinor for the polarization vector to be @xmath105 .",
    "this satisfies the needed constraints and leads to sufficiently good behavior at large @xmath86 . since @xmath106 has extra su(2)@xmath16su(2 )",
    "little - group indices , one introduces an auxiliary matrix @xmath107 to contract the indices so that , @xmath108}_{2b}}{[1^{\\da}|2_b\\rangle } = x^{a\\da}\\frac{^{[a}\\s{p}_2|1_{\\da}]\\langle1_a|^{b]}}{s_{12 } } \\,,\\ ] ] and the condition @xmath109 now becomes @xmath110 .",
    "this can automatically be satisfied by choosing @xmath111 , where the @xmath112 and @xmath113 are arbitrary .",
    "these arbitrary variables will cancel out once one sums over all contributions .",
    "when implementing the recursion relations numerically , these variables are helpful since they can identify errors when one checks whether the result is independent of the choice of @xmath114 .",
    "the above shift can be translated into a redefinition of the spinors , @xmath115\\tilde{\\lambda}_{2a}^{\\db}\\ , , \\hskip 0.95 cm   \\tilde{\\lambda}_{{2}a\\db}(z)=\\tilde{\\lambda}_{2a\\db }    + \\frac{z}{s_{12}}\\ , x^{a}_{\\;\\;\\da } \\tilde{\\lambda}_{1a}^{\\da}\\langle 1_a|2_{\\db}]\\ , .",
    "\\hskip 1 cm   \\label{bshift}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    in , we will describe the supersymmetrized bcfw recursion relations to generate the tree amplitudes needed in calculations of multiloop amplitudes of @xmath0 sym theory .      as noted in ,",
    "the three- and four - point amplitudes contain chiral - conjugate factors .",
    "an obvious question is whether this property can be extended to @xmath116 points .",
    "indeed this is the case , as can be seen using bcfw recursion relations .",
    "this can be understood by noting that six - dimensional on - shell helicity states of yang - mills theory transform under a representation of the little group which factorizes into the direct product of two spinor representations .",
