    "experimental searches for a deviation from newton s law of universal gravitation have received a great deal of attention over the past three decades .",

    "searches have involved a great variety of experiments on the planetary , lunar , geological , and laboratory scales .",
    "a recent review by fischbach and talmadge @xcite shows that new forces with a strength weaker than or comparable to gravity have been excluded over distances ranging between 1 and @xmath0 cm .",
    "experiments have only marginally explored the distance range under 1 cm , however , and there is little knowledge of gravity itself in this range @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the sub - centimeter region is of increasing experimental interest , given a number of recent predictions of new forces from modern theories which attempt to unify gravity with the strong and electroweak interactions .    in this paper",
    "we present a review of the existing experimental limits and some of the recent theoretical predictions .",
    "we then describe an experiment which we expect to be sensitive to gravity at distances as short as 50 @xmath1 m , and to much of the parameter space for the new predictions .",

    ", as is likely , the yukawa forces couple to quantities other than mass , then @xmath9 will have a slight composition dependence @xcite , which we do not consider .",
    "the current experimental limits on @xmath9 , for yukawa ranges between 1 @xmath1 m and 1 cm , are illustrated in fig .",

    "the region above and to the right of the bold curves is excluded by experiments falling into two general categories : classical gravity measurements and casimir force measurements .      for values of @xmath10",
    "greater than 100@xmath1 m , the most stringent limits on @xmath9 can be obtained from torsion balance experiments designed to test the gravitational inverse - square law .",
    "well before the interest in gravitational measurements brought on by suggestions of a `` fifth force , '' the report of a possible deviation in a measurement by long @xcite motivated several similar experimental programs ( see , for example , refs .",
    "@xcite ) which have apparently ruled out any evidence for the anomaly @xcite .",
    "one such experiment is the irvine 2 - 5 cm null measurement @xcite , which yields the best limits in the range near 1 cm .",
    "this experiment used a torsion balance to measure the force on a test mass suspended inside a hollow cylinder , a non - zero result for which would have been evidence for an anomalous force .",
    "after an exhaustive consideration of possible systematic effects , and careful analysis of inhomogeneity in the cylinder , the authors derived the limit curve reproduced in fig .",
    "[ fig : lim ] , corresponding to a force sensitivity of about @xmath11 dyne .",
    "only the curve corresponding to the ( more sensitive ) limiting case of a hypothesized attractive yukawa force ( @xmath12 ) is shown .",
    "below the range of a few millimeters , the most stringent limits may be obtained from the torsion balance experiment of mitrofanov and ponomareva @xcite .",
    "this experiment used a dynamic - resonant technique to distinguish the gravitational interaction of the test masses from backgrounds .",
    "a test mass , initially spaced 3.8 mm perpendicular to one end of the balance , was moved synchronously with the oscillations of the balance .",
    "the authors were able to achieve a sensitivity of about @xmath13 dyne , for integration times of about @xmath14 s. the ratio of the forces measured at 3.8 mm and 6.5 mm was used to obtain a curve similar to that shown in fig .",

    "[ fig : lim ] . the 1@xmath15 errors on the test mass separations ,",
    "apparently not taken into account in the original report , are added in quadrature to the 1@xmath15 errors on the measured force ratio , so that the limit we derive is slightly less sensitive than that reported in ref .",
    "[ ref : mit ] .",
    "we have not illustrated the cases for the separate hypotheses of attractive and repulsive forces , which have little effect on the results .",
    "other inverse - square law and cavendish experiments have been performed with inter - mass separations on the order of 1 cm , including that of the tokyo group @xcite .",
    "none , however , reach stronger limits in the range below 1 cm .",
    "the rot - wash experiment , which uses a 2620 kg depleted uranium attractor rotated around a torsion balance with lead and copper test masses , yields a limit nearly competitive with the irvine result at 1 cm @xcite .",
    "this assumes a yukawa force which couples to mass ; the use of uranium makes this experiment especially sensitive to composition - dependent forces .",
    "assuming a coupling to @xmath16 , the rot - wash experiment has set a limit 10 times more stringent than the irvine experiment at 1 cm .      in 1948 , h. g. b. casimir showed that a weak attractive force should be present between a set of flat , parallel conducting plates , due to the zero - point fluctuations of the electromagnetic field @xcite .",
    "this force is given by @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the separation and @xmath19 is the area .",

    "the experiment by derjaguin , abrikosova , and lifshitz @xcite done in 1956 provided the most sensitive limits in the range less than 100 @xmath1 m for 40 years , until the recent measurement by lamoreaux @xcite .",

    "this region , bounded above by the curve in fig .",
    "[ fig : lim ] , is roughly one order of magnitude more stringent than the derjaguin limit over the entire range shown , for positive values of @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "it is very important to note that the measured force plot presumably represents less than one percent of the total data set @xcite .",
    "it is therefore likely that the limits attainable from a complete re - analysis of this experiment are at least another order of magnitude more sensitive than those presented in fig .",

    ", since the electrostatic force between protons is @xmath31 times stronger than the gravitational force , no experiment on an elementary system which is dominated by electromagnetic effects can be expected to provide limits strong enough in this range to compete with macroscopic measurements @xcite .",
    "as indicated in fig .  [ fig : lim ] , current experimental limits allow for the existence of forces many orders of magnitude stronger than gravity in the range below one millimeter .",
    "predictions of new forces  usually involving very light bosons  have arisen in many contexts , from the early notion of lee and yang of a field coupled to baryon number @xcite , to modern ideas connected with string theory . for experiments below one millimeter , several well - motivated predictions can be addressed .",

    "the mass of the light boson is typically given by @xcite : @xmath32 where @xmath33 gev is the planck mass ( or string scale ) , @xmath34 is a mass scale connected with the known elementary particles , and @xmath35 is a small integer . for @xmath36 , the choice of @xmath37 tev yields @xmath38",

    "an interesting class of predictions arises in superstring theories in which supersymmetry breaking occurs at low energies ( less than about 100 tev ) .",
    "these theories are of interest as a way to address the supersymmetry flavor problem .",
    "superstring models generally contain gravitationally - coupled scalars called moduli which are massless at the string scale .",
    "dimopoulos and giudice consider a `` gauge - mediated '' model where the moduli acquire mass only from supersymmetry breaking , which they suppose to occur at 10 - 100 tev @xcite .",

    "each prediction covers a region in the ( @xmath40 ) plane because of uncertainties in the model parameters .",
    "the predicted strengths are larger than gravity by several orders of magnitude , and the ranges are several orders larger than would be expected from eq .",
    "[ eq : boson ] .",
    "similar scenarios have been discussed previously by banks , berkooz , and steinhardt @xcite .",
    "antoniadis , dimopoulos , and dvali have presented a related theory in which supersymmetry breaking occurs via scherk - schwarz compactification at the weak scale ( @xmath41 1 tev ) @xcite .",
    "the authors show that theories involving this mechanism are likely to give rise to at least one scalar particle , the radius modulus , with a compton wavelength corresponding to the size of the compact dimension . in the model",
    "considered , the radius modulus has a compton wavelength in the sub - millimeter range , and mediates a force with strength 1/3 that of gravity , as shown in fig  [ fig : lim ] .",
    "other light scalars with stronger couplings are also possible .",
    "the dilaton of string theory couples to matter with a strength roughly 80 times that of gravity @xcite .",
    "the mass of the dilaton depends on unknown physics .",
    "dimopoulos and giudice suggest a dilaton mass of about 10 ev for their scenario , but other authors take the dilaton mass to be an unknown parameter @xcite .",

    "however , the coupling @xmath9 of the associated long - range force between unpolarized nucleons has been constrained , by recent measurements of the neutron electric dipole moment , to the region of the ( @xmath29 ) plane shown in fig .",

    "the oscillating - g cosmology of steinhardt and will involves a massive brans - dicke field which is left oscillating at high frequency after inflation @xcite .",
    "yukawa corrections to the newtonian potential are predicted , and useful bounds on a product of the parameters of the model are found when these predictions are compared to experiments .",
    "the experiment described below would improve these bounds by a factor of 600 @xcite .",
    "a recent model due to beane is based on more general assumptions .",
    "the author argues that if all experimentally observable phenomena can be described in terms of effective field theories , then the observed smallness of the cosmological constant implies the existence of new quanta @xcite .",
    "furthermore , if a substantial component of the energy density of the universe in the present epoch is due to vacuum energy , then the range of the new quanta should be approximately 100 @xmath1 m , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : lim ] .",
    "r. sundrum develops these ideas further and proposes a specific mechanism that could provide a solution to the cosmological constant problem @xcite . in this theory , the new quanta are comprised of light gravitational strings .",
    "the size of the cosmological constant is set by the scale of these strings ( as opposed to the standard model scale ) , below which the behavior of gravitational forces is expected to be quite different .",
    "consistency with current cosmological and laboratory constraints suggests this scale to be between 10 @xmath1 m and 1 cm .",
    "finally , we mention a theory which does not necessarily make recourse to new light particles . in a recent discussion , arkani - hamed , dimopoulos , and dvali",
    "propose a theory in which gravitational and gauge interactions are united at the weak scale , which is taken to be the only fundamental short scale in nature @xcite .",
    "this model does not rely on supersymmetry and is of interest as a solution to the hierarchy problem .",
    "the relative weakness of the gravitational interaction is a consequence of @xmath44 new compact dimensions which are large compared to the weak scale , and in which gravitons propagate freely but the standard model fields do not .",
    "for the smallest number of new dimensions yet to be ruled out by experiment ( @xmath36 ) , the size of the new dimensions is in the millimeter region .",
    "gravitational measurements in this regime would be sensitive to potentials dictated by gauss law in ( @xmath45 ) dimensions , or gravitational forces varying as @xmath46 .    from this discussion",
    "it is clear that forces of gravitational strength are playing an increasingly important theoretical role , especially since the advent of string theory .",
    "there is ample motivation to push to the shortest ranges possible , where macroscopic experiments might provide a rare window on physics at the planck scale .",
    "as the length scale @xmath47 of an experiment decreases , the gravitational attraction decreases as @xmath48 .",
    "it therefore becomes difficult at shorter distances to distinguish the newtonian force between the test masses from the background forces .",
    "surface forces are especially troublesome , because they increase rapidly at small separations .",
    "the most sensitive experiments in the centimeter range to date have used torsion balances .",
    "klimchitskaya , et al . , have proposed to use a torsional pendulum inside a rotating steel sphere with a non - concentric cavity , and they expect to improve the current limits by roughly an order of magnitude in the range above 100 @xmath1 m @xcite .",
    "another approach involves the use of small mechanical oscillators for the experimental test masses .",
    "the experiment of carugno , fontana , onofrio , and rizzo measured the force between a small copper mass and a steel resonator driven at 30 and @xmath49 hz , respectively @xcite . using a heterodyne detection technique ,",
    "this experiment was able to set limits on new macroscopic forces between , for example , @xmath50 at @xmath51 m and @xmath52 at @xmath53 m. these limits are roughly two orders of magnitude weaker than those shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : lim ] , however , the authors hope to improve their sensitivity by as much as five orders of magnitude using fiber optic techniques .",
    "our own design is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : expt ] .",
    "small mechanical resonators are used for both the source mass and force detector .",
    "the source mass is driven at the resonant frequency of a detector torsional mode , nominally 1 khz . in the resonant mode of interest , the two rectangular sections of the detector counter - rotate .",
    "the amplitude of motion is large for the smaller section immediately above the source mass , while the larger section is nearly stationary .",
    "this double torsional arrangement provides a degree of isolation from the oscillator mounting , which decreases the mode damping @xcite .",
    "the principal advantage of this high - frequency resonant method is that seismic and other vibrational backgrounds can be easily filtered in the kilohertz range .",
    "vibration isolation is provided by supporting the masses from stacks of brass disks connected by steel wires @xcite .",
    "other backgrounds include electrostatic forces , which are suppressed with a gold - plated shield between the masses , and magnetic forces due to both external fields and contamination .",
    "background due to the casimir effect is comparable to electromagnetic effects only for mass separations below 1 @xmath1 m , roughly 1% of the anticipated minimum gap .",
    "if these backgrounds can be sufficiently reduced , the dominant source of noise will be thermal noise due to dissipation in the detector oscillator . based on this limitation",
    ", we calculate the expected sensitivity of the experiment to a new yukawa - type interaction .",
    "the yukawa force between parallel plates separated by a distance @xmath54 is given by : @xmath55[1 - \\exp{(-t_{d } / \\lambda ) } ] \\label{eq : fyp}\\ ] ] where @xmath56 and @xmath57 are the source and detector mass densities , and @xmath58 and @xmath59 are the thicknesses .",
    "this would be an exact expression if either plate had area @xmath19 and the other had infinite area , but for the real geometry there are small edge corrections . neglecting these effects , and assuming the geometry in fig .",
    "[ fig : expt]b , the torque exerted on the detector ( the smaller rectangle only ) via a yukawa interaction with the source is given by : @xmath60[1 - \\exp{(-t_{d } / \\lambda ) } ] , \\label{eq : ny}\\ ] ] where @xmath61 is the area of the detector above the source mass , and @xmath62 is the distance between the edge of the detector and the torsion axis .    the read - out signal from the transducer varies with the amplitude of the applied torque .",
    "the source mass is driven at the detector resonant frequency @xmath63 , and only the amplitude of the signal torque associated with this frequency is effective in driving the detector . from fourier analysis ,",
    "this amplitude is : @xmath64[1 - \\exp{(-t_{d } / \\lambda ) } ] , \\label{eq : nyw}\\ ] ] where @xmath65 is the modified bessel function .",

    "while very precise casimir force measurements have recently been carried out and set new limits on effects in the range below 100 @xmath1 m , our calculations reveal that these experiments still allow for forces several million times stronger than gravity in this region .",
    "experiments of gravitational sensitivity in this range have become all the more imperative with several recent theoretical predictions of new forces , motivated especially by advances in string theory .",
