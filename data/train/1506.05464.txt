    "it might be surprising that the upper limit found by @xcite is less constraining than the one we found with our stability boundary . however , these authors study the stability of the system surveying a much more constrained region of parameter space , confining the orbits to be almost apsidally aligned , which allows for stable orbits with higher values of @xmath283 compared to random orientation of the orbits as we have assumed in our simulations ( see  [ sec : miss ] ) .",
