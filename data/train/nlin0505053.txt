    "coupled nonlinear systems possess a rich catalog of potentially useful dynamical behaviours including bifurcations , chaos and synchronization .",
    "they are central to the understanding of a wide variety of extended systems , e.g. a line of lattice oscillations or coupled plasma wave modes .",
    "a system of two oscillators could make a hopf bifurcation to a second incommensurate frequency and follow a quasiperiodic route to chaos , in addition to period doubling and intermittency .",
    "such routes to chaos was first observed by ruelle and takens@xcite .",
    "synchronization phenomena in coupled or driven nonlinear oscillators are of fundamental importance and have been extensively investigated both theoretically and experimentally in the context of many specific problems arising in laser dynamics , electronic circuits , secure communications and time series analysis @xcite to mention a few . in a recent study ,",
    "we observed phase synchronization in both unidirectionally @xcite and bidirectionally @xcite coupled deterministic ratchets that exhibits intermittent chaos . in @xcite",
    ", it was shown that the transition to the synchronous regime is characterized by an interior crises transition of the attractor in the phase space .",
    "specifically , two analytic tests based on the fujisaka and yamada approach @xcite and that of gauthier and bienfang @xcite were employed to verify the stability of the synchronous state in reference @xcite .    a clear understanding of coupled oscillator systems requires a study of the full spectrum of the operating regimes , including the nonsynchronous state @xcite .",
    "it has been reported that a group of interacting chaotic units that exhibits synchronization show some bifurcation cascades from disorder to partial and global order when varying the coupling strength @xcite .",
    "ding and yang @xcite showed the existence of intermingled basins in coupled duffing oscillators that exhibit synchronized chaos and conjectured that intermingled basins can be easily realized in the context of coupled oscillators and synchronized chaos .",
    "extensive bifurcation analysis of two coupled periodically driven duffing oscillators was done by kozlowski et al .",
    "they showed that the global pattern of bifurcation curves in parameter space consists of repeated subpatterns similar to the superstructure observed for single , periodically driven , strictly dissipative oscillators .",
    "this study was recently extended to two coupled periodically driven double - well duffing oscillators by kenfack @xcite .",
    "the results revealed a striking departure from the single - well duffing oscillators studied by kozlowski et al @xcite .",
    "the literature is abundant with studies on coupled oscillator systems . at this point",
    ", we wish to refer the reader to some other recent studies that are related to the subject of this work  @xcite-@xcite .",
    "motivated by this series of studies , we aim in this paper to explore some dynamical features hitherto not fully explored in the coupled ratchets with emphasies on the bifurcation structures preceeding the stable synchronous regime .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows : section 2 describes the equations of motion of the chaotic ratchet model and comment on the synchronization behaviour of the coupled system that is of interest in this study . in section 3 ,",
    "we carry out a linear stability analysis of the system projected on the poincar@xmath3 map , while in section 4 , numerical results of bifurcations are presented .",
    "chaotic behaviour is characterized in section 5 .",
    "the paper is concluded in section 6 .",
    "let us consider the one - dimensional problem of a particle driven by a periodic time - dependent external force under the influence of an asymmetric potential of the ratchet type  @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the time average of the external force is zero . in the absence of stochastic noise ,",
    "the dynamics is exclusively deterministic .",
    "the dimensionless equation of motion for a particle of unit mass moving in the ratchet potential @xmath4 is given by @xmath5 where time @xmath6 has been normalized in the unit of @xmath7 , the small resonant frequency of the system . here ,",
    "@xmath0 and @xmath8 are the forcing strength and the damping parameter , respectively .",
    "the dimensionless potential @xmath4 is given by @xmath9 with constants @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "the potential @xmath4 is shifted by a value @xmath12 in order to place its minimum at the origin ( see fig .",
    "[ figure1 ] ) .",
    "notice that this asymmetric potential is periodic and has infinite potential wells .",
    "the extended phase space in which the dynamic is taking place is three - dimensional , since we are dealing with an inhomogeneous differential equation with an explicit time dependence .",
    "we can rewrite equation ( 1 ) in autonomous form as a three dimensional dynamical system described by the coordinates : @xmath13 since equation ( 3 ) is nonlinear its solutions allow the possibility of periodic and chaotic orbits . for the purpose of this study , we consider a system of two identical unidirectionally coupled chaotic ratchets governed by : @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the coupling parameter . for @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 , systems ( 4 ) and ( 5 ) exhibit stable phase synchronization when @xmath19 . the synchronization dynamics for @xmath20 shown in fig .",
    "[ figure2 ] , is determined by the behaviour of the following difference @xmath21 .",
    "the phase difference is locked ( full synchronization , @xmath22 ) after a short transient time .",
    "prior to the phase locking event , the strange attractor undergoes a crises transition during which it is gradually destroyed and as the synchronization regime is approached , the attractor is again re - built @xcite . to obtain approximate visualization of the attractors and their bifurcations we follow the procedure described in @xcite .",
    "that is , we investigate the dynamics in the poincar@xmath3 sections denoted by @xmath23 .    0.25 cm   the ratchet potential ( @xmath24),title=\"fig:\",width=264,height=151 ]    0.25 cm   synchronization dynamics showing the quantity @xmath21 as function of time , for @xmath20 , @xmath17 , @xmath16 and @xmath18,title=\"fig:\",width=264,height=188 ]",
    "to begin with , let us consider the basic mathematical principle underlying some expected topological structure of the coupled ratchets .",

    "the solution of equation ( 8) after one period @xmath45 of the oscillations in the linearized poincar@xmath3 map is given by @xmath46 where @xmath39 represents the time - independent stability matrix of a periodic orbit connecting arbitrary infinitesimal variations in the initial conditions @xmath47 with corresponding change @xmath48 after one period @xmath45 .",
    "the real parts of the roots of the characteristic equation @xmath49 , given by @xmath50 determines the stability of the periodic motion , with @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 and @xmath54 . here",
    "@xmath55 represent the eigenvalues of @xmath56 . if one assumes @xmath57 , as in our numerical experiment , then @xmath58 .",
    "in general , complex eigenvalues occur in complex conjugate pairs .",
    "let us consider @xmath59 , @xmath60 as the real and the imaginary parts of @xmath61 , respectively ( @xmath62 ) .",
    "if @xmath63 is real , the eigenvalues are simply the rate of contraction ( @xmath64 ) or expansion ( @xmath65 ) near the steady state .",
    "if @xmath61 is complex , its real part @xmath59 gives the rate of contraction ( @xmath64 ) or expansion ( @xmath65 ) of the spiral while its imaginary part @xmath60 contributes for the frequency rotation .",
    "the eigenvalues of the linearized poincar@xmath3 map may thus be written as : @xmath66 it turns out from equation ( 12 ) that if @xmath64 for all @xmath63 , then all sufficiently small perturbations tend torward zero as @xmath67 and the steady state ( node ( _ n _ ) , saddle - node ( _ sn _ ) , spiral ( _ sp _ ) ) is stable . if @xmath65 for all @xmath61 , then any small perturbation grows with time and the steady state ( _ n _",

    "in addition if there exist @xmath68 and @xmath69 such that @xmath70 and @xmath71 , the equilibrium state is unstable and is called a saddle . having recourse to the above analysis it follows that saddle - node , _ sn _ ( @xmath72 ) , period - doubling , _ pd _ ( @xmath73 ) , hopf ( @xmath74 , with @xmath75 ) and symmetry - breaking ( _ sb _ ) bifurcations are expected to occur in the coupled ratchets .",

    "in order to investigate the dependence of the system on a single control parameter ( in this case , the amplitude @xmath0 of the driving function ) , several bifurcation diagrams have been computed , some of which have been chosen to illustrate the general structure of the system .",
    "each bifurcation diagram shows the projection of the attractors in the poincar@xmath3 section onto the @xmath80 or the @xmath81 coordinates versus the control parameter .",

    "we begin with a general overview of the behaviour of the two coupled systems by displaying regions of existence of different periodic and chaotic orbits in a two parameter phase diagram which is plotted in ( @xmath84 ) plane at fixed values of @xmath85 and @xmath86 ( fig .",

[ figure4 ] we show bifurcation diagrams for a comparatively small driving frequency of @xmath92 .",
    "different bifurcation sequences occur as the driving amplitude @xmath0 is varied .",
    "for instance in fig .",
    "[ figure4](a ) , there is a resonance near @xmath93 while a period-1 attractor emerges in fig .",

    "this period-2 attractor is finally annihilated in a crisis event around @xmath95 leading to a sudden chaotic state ( transcient chaotic state ) .",
    "after this chaotic state we find bubbles of bifurcation dominating periodic windows ( further , see fig .  [ figure7](a ) as a prototype ) . when the driving frequency @xmath1 is increased , saddle - node ( _ sn _ ) , symmetry breaking ( _ sb _ ) bifurcations , quasiperiodicity as well as period - doubling ( _ pd _ ) cascade predominate .",
    "for instance , fig .",
    "[ figure5](a ) shows the occurence of _ sn _ in the vicinity of @xmath96 and a _ pd _ cascade , at around @xmath97 , leading to chaos for @xmath98 .",

    ", we proceed to investigate large values of the driving frequency ( @xmath102 ) and different ranges of @xmath0 . here",
    "we find that the majority of the earlier observed bifurcation scenario are also repeated except that for large @xmath0 , typically greater than the critical value @xmath103 , periodic attractors dominate .",
    "fingerprints of such behaviour can readily be observed in fig .",
    "[ figure5](c ) for @xmath101 , where a period-1 attractor is created via a _ sb",

    "the best - known characteristic of a chaotic system is unpredictability , resulting from sensitivity to initial conditions ( sic ) .",
    "the slightest deviation from a given set of initial conditions yields a completely different output . in fig .",
    "[ figure6 ] , two typical chaotic trajectories originated from two slightly different set of initial conditions ( @xmath104 for a and @xmath105 for b ) are displayed .",
    "the parameters have been selected from the chaotic region of the phase diagram of fig .",
    "[ figure3 ] with the driving amplitude kept fixed @xmath16 .",
    "although both trajectories initially evolve together , after several time steps the state variables become essentially independent .",
    "this is a clear manifestation of the sic , as witness of chaos .    though sic has come to be the hallmark of chaos , it is not unique to the chaotic regime .",
    "for example , a similar behaviour can be observed in the intermittency transition regime where the time series is nearly periodic .",
    "thus , to better validate the results obtained above , it is necessary to investigate the dynamics of the ratchets in a more concrete space - the poincare cross - sections .",
    "analysis of the dynamics in such space may help to eventually uncover the hidden structure in the behaviour of the coupled ratchets . in the poincare cross - section ,",
    "all trajectories for a given set of control parameters converge to a single object ( the attractor ) in spite of sic .",
    "the convergence to an attractor is guaranteed even if the control parameters are slightly varied .",
    "the set of lyapunov exponents @xmath61 provides an intuitively appealing and yet a very powerful measure of sic and dissipation , both of which are required for a chaotic system . all @xmath61 originates from linear stabilty analysis . in this approximation , all solutions are of the form @xmath106 , @xmath107 .",
    "the maximum lyapunov exponent @xmath108 is defined as : @xmath109 where @xmath110 is obtained in the poincar@xmath3 cross - section by solving numerically the variational equation ( 8) simultaneously with the systems ( 4 ) and ( 5 ) .",
    "a positive lyapunov exponent is a signature of chaos while zero and negative values of the exponent is an indication of a marginally stable or quasiperiodic orbit and periodic orbit , respectively . in fig .",

    "in summary , we have investigated the dynamics of unidirectionally coupled deterministic ratchets and have shown varieties of bifurcation sequences including quasiperiodic route to chaos . using the standard method of linear stability analysis",
    ", we have examined the stability of the steady state solution of the system leading to different types of bifurcations likely to occur in the neigbourhood of the synchronized region . for a given driving frequency ,",
    "the bifurcations depend strongly on the values of the driving amplitude @xmath0 and are generally complicated .",
    "besides quasiperiodicity , the familiar period - doubling and crisis route to chaos were also observed .",
    "in addition , the coupled ratchets exhibits symmetry - breaking bifurcations , resonance , saddle - node and bubbles of bifurcations . using lyapunov exponent spectrum as well as sensitivity to initial conditions , we characterized chaos in this system .",
    "a perusal of the poincar@xmath3 cross - sections revealed boundary crises in which the size of chaotic attractor is suddenly enlarged as the driving frequency is gradually decreased for a fixed driving amplitude .",
    "although this system presents a very chaotic structure , it remains nevertheless ordered as the driving frequency becomes large , thereby providing critical parameters for a chaotic transport of particles .",
