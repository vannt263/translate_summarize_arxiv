    "the peak luminosities of @xmath0-ray bursts ( grbs ) are highly super - eddington and require relativistic outflows ( paczyski 1986 ; goodman 1986 ) .",
    "paczyski and rhoads ( 1993 ) pointed out that radio emission is expected as a result of the interaction between such a relativistic outflow and an external medium , as is , e.g. , observed in extragalactic jet sources ( see also katz 1994 ; mszros and rees 1997 ) .",
    "they estimated that the strongest grbs may be followed by transient ( @xmath5 mjy ) radio emission at intervals ranging from minutes ( for a distance @xmath6 @xmath7 10@xmath8 pc ) to several weeks ( @xmath6 @xmath7 10@xmath9 pc ) .",

    "grb 970508 is the first grb to be detected in the radio ( frail et al .",

    "the noise level in a continuum map after 12 hours of integration is typically 0.05 mjy beam@xmath14 for 14 telescopes and the full 65 mhz bandwidth . for the declination of grb 970508 , at 1.4 ghz ,",
    "the synthesized beamwidth is @xmath15 ( full width at half maximum ; fwhm ) , and the field of view is about 06 .",

    "interference was usually limited to about 5 % of the data .",
    "the interferometer gain and phase , for each observation and each band , were calibrated using the standard wsrt calibrators 3c 48 , 3c 147 and 3c 286 ( 15.96 , 9.50 and 14.77 jy , respectively at 1.4 ghz ; baars et al .",

    "due to noise the location of a source in the radio map can shift by roughly 0.5 fwhm / snr , where snr is the signal - to - noise ratio of the detection . for very low snr detections the shift can be fairly large .",
    "if we would take a peak in the map near the location of grb 970508 we would bias ourselves systematically to higher flux densities ( as we can not discern whether the peak is due to noise on top of the detection or the detection itself ) .",

    "the average 4.86 ghz flux density during the first 50 days is 560 @xmath16 10 @xmath17jy ( frail et al .",

    "the critical angular size below which diffractive scintillation can be observed is a factor 4.5 smaller than at 4.86 ghz ( goodman 1997 ) .",

    "( 1997b ) observed scintillation at 4.86 ghz until day @xmath7 30 we would expect diffractive iss to modulate the 1.4 ghz flux density for @xmath29 days .",
    "we have searched for diffractive iss in the individual 5 and 10 mhz bands during the first two weeks , dividing the data into segments of 6 hours ( a trade off between the iss decorrelation time and a sufficient amount of data ) .",

    "1998 ) . in the following",
    "we show that this may be explained by rapid cooling of a significant fraction of the electrons .",
    "a population of electrons with a power - law distribution of lorentz factors @xmath38 ( d@xmath2/d@xmath39 ) above some minimum value @xmath40 emits a power law synchrotron spectrum above the frequency @xmath41 ( corresponding to radiating electrons with @xmath42 ; e.g. rybicki & lightman 1979 ) .",
    "independently , above some lorentz factor @xmath43 the electrons may cool rapidly , and an extra break in the spectrum is expected at the corresponding frequency @xmath44 ( sari , piran , & narayan 1998 ) . beyond a certain time",
    "@xmath45 ( @xmath45 is small @xmath7 500 sec ; see paper ii ) the evolution of the blast wave is adiabatic ( sari et al . 1998 and",

    "the evolution in time of the grb afterglow is determined by the evolution of these break frequencies : @xmath50 and @xmath51 ( both decrease with time ) .",
    "the decay part of the optical r@xmath52 ( coussins r ) band light curve ( in the optical passband @xmath53 for @xmath54 1.2 days ; paper ii ) goes as @xmath55 , while the spectrum is then @xmath49 ( sari et al .",
    "this allows us to make two independent measurements of @xmath1 : using @xmath56 we find @xmath57 and using @xmath58 gives @xmath59 .",
    "the excellent agreement between the values of @xmath1 supports that a significant fraction of the electrons cool rapidly and that the evolution of the grb remnant is adiabatic .",
    "additional evidence for rapid cooling of a significant fraction of the electrons is given in paper ii .",
    "observations by bremer et al .",
    "( 1998 ) with the iram plateau de bure interferometer ( pdbi ) at 86 ghz show a maximum around @xmath7 12 days .",
    "we identify this maximum with the break frequency @xmath41 passing 86 ghz at @xmath60 12 days ( paper ii ) .",
    "we expect , the 8.46 and 1.4  ghz emission to peak at @xmath61 55 days and @xmath62 180 days , respectively ( @xmath63 ) .",
    "near day 55 , a shallow maximum can be seen in the 8.46 ghz light curve ( frail et al .",
    "unfortunately our 1.4 ghz light curve can not be used to test the presence of the maximum at that frequency , both due to low signal to noise and because it ends 150 days after the burst , i.e. before the predicted maximum .    before @xmath41 passes 8.46 ghz at @xmath64",
    "we expect the 8.46 ghz spectrum to follow the low frequency tail @xmath23 , while after @xmath65 it is expected to be @xmath66 ( sari et al . 1998",
    "and we have used @xmath1 = 2.2 ) .",
    "thus , we predict a gradual transition between @xmath67 55 days and @xmath68 80 days ( when also at 4.86 ghz @xmath41 has passed ) from @xmath31 = 1/3 to @xmath69 . we note that this expectation is different from blast wave models that do not include the effect of rapid cooling of a significant fraction of the electrons ( @xmath70 similar to the optical slope",
    "; see e.g. wijers et al .",
    "also the decays at 8.46 ghz ( after @xmath71 55 days ) and 4.86 ghz ( after @xmath72 80 days ) are expected to be different from that in the optical and x - ray passbands , @xmath73 ; where we have used @xmath1 = 2.2 ) .",
    "these predictions can be tested with the continued monitoring at the vla at 4.86 and 8.46 ghz by frail et al .",
    "( 1998 ) .    the radio afterglow light curves of grb 970508 ( frail et al .",
    "1997b and this letter ) show a much more gradual evolution than expected ( see e.g. the fit to the 8.46 and 4.86 ghz data by waxman , kulkarni and frail 1998 ) . also a constant self - absorption frequency was expected ( e.g. waxman et al .",
    "1997 ) while we here show that a transition from optically thick to thin emission occurred around @xmath7 45 days . for @xmath74 sari et al .",
    "( 1998 ) predict a decrease with time of the self - absorption frequency , @xmath75 , while for @xmath20 @xmath45 the self - aborption frequency @xmath75 remains constant .",
    "the transition from optically thick to thin 1.4 ghz radiation then suggests that @xmath45 @xmath7 45 days . also the 8.46 ghz light curve ( frail et al .",
    "1997b ) suggests that @xmath45 can not be much smaller than 10 days , i.e. 10 days @xmath76 @xmath45 @xmath76 55 days ( we have extrapolated backwards in time from the 8.46 ghz peak at @xmath77 @xmath7 55 days with the expected dependence @xmath78 for times @xmath79 ) .",
    "this is not in agreement with the finding that @xmath80 sec ( paper ii ) .",
    "however , the absence of a break in the smooth power law decay of the optical light curve from 2 to 60 days after the burst ( pedersen et al . 1998 ; castro - tirado et al .",
    "1998 ; sokolov et al . 1998 ; galama et al .",
    "1998c ) shows that there is no important transition in that period .",
    "this does imply that some additional ingredient is needed ; for example , waxman et al . (",
    "1998 ) argue that the transition from ultrarelativistic to mildly relativistic expansion of the blast wave may explain the decrease in the self - absorption frequency @xmath75 with time and the slow time dependence of the early radio light curves .    the excellent agreement in the derived value for @xmath1 ( @xmath1 = 2.2 ) from the decay of the optical light curve and the optical spectral slope support an adiabatic dynamical evolution of the grb remnant and an extra break in the synchrotron spectrum at the frequency @xmath44 above which the radiation is from electrons which cool rapidly compared to the remnant s expansion time .",
    "we predict a transition in the radio spectral index @xmath81 from 1/3 to 0.6 , between 55 and 80 days ; the light curves are predicted to decay as @xmath82 after 55 days at 8.46 ghz and 80 days at 4.86 ghz .",
