    "we consider functional forms motivated by theory .",
    "hence , the functions @xmath389 and @xmath390 are expressed as polynomials in the variable @xmath391 , plus some correction terms of order @xmath392 . in practice , we approximate the two functions as @xmath393 in the case of @xmath394 we also add a term @xmath395 , as suggested by the correction - to - scaling analysis presented in sec .",

    "coefficients @xmath396 and @xmath397 are fixed by using eqs .",

    "first , we performed several fits , changing the orders of the polynomials @xmath162 and @xmath398 , and considering the scale @xmath74 as a free parameter .",
    "we obtained almost perfect interpolations by taking @xmath399 and @xmath400 .",
    "we also observed that the fits of @xmath104 and @xmath66 were providing very similar values for the scale @xmath74 . with the previous choices of @xmath162 and @xmath398 , we obtained @xmath401 from the analysis of @xmath66 and @xmath402 from the analysis of @xmath104 .",
    "similar values where obtained in fits in which @xmath162 and @xmath398 were slightly changed .",
    "the consistency of the two results confirms the adequacy of our interpolating expressions . to obtain the final interpolations we fixed @xmath403 for both quantities , obtaining @xmath404 and @xmath405 it is important to note that these expressions have the only purpose of providing an accurate interpolation of the numerical data , and are not meant to provide the correct large-@xmath0 asymptotic behavior .",
    "for instance , they should not be used to estimate the coefficient of the corrections proportional to @xmath406 : @xmath407 obtained in the fit probably differs significantly from the correct large-@xmath0 coefficient .",

    "it depends on @xmath0 and can be evaluated by using a bootstrap method , which yields the curves shown in fig .",

    "errors are almost constant and very small up to @xmath408 , i.e. , in the region in which we have data , then they increase , reaching a maximum for @xmath409 .",
    "eventually , they should decrease to zero as @xmath410 , due to the fact that the interpolations have the correct asymptotic behavior  ( [ rasym ] ) .",
    "typical statistics of the runs range from @xmath415 to @xmath416 monte carlo steps , where a monte carlo step is made of one diagonal update and @xmath417 off - diagonal updates . the number @xmath417 is estimated at run time and turns out to linearly increase with @xmath0 .                                            since the correlation length scales as @xmath423",
