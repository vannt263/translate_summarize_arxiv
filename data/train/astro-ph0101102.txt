    "the su  uma subclass of cataclysmic variable is characterised by two distinct accretion - disk instabilities .",
    "the first is a thermal instability caused by partially ionized hydrogen , which results in dwarf - nova outbursts ( e.g.  cannizzo 1993 ) .",
    "the second is a tidal instability occurring when orbits in the disk resonate with the secondary - star orbit , driving the disk elliptical and causing it to precess with a period of a few days ( e.g.  whitehurst &   king 1991 ) .",
    "the 3:1 resonance that is responsible occurs at a disk radius of @xmath20.46@xmath3 , where @xmath3 is the binary separation . in the elliptical disk",
    "the tidal stresses vary with the interaction of the orbital and precessional periods , to produce excess light recurring with a period a few percent longer than the orbital period , called a superhump .",
    "observationally , su  uma stars show a succession of normal outbursts , caused by the thermal instability alone , followed by a longer - lasting superoutburst , during which the presence of superhumps implies that the tidal instability is also excited .",
    "this pattern ( called a supercycle ) then repeats .",
    "osaki ( 1989 ; 1996 ) has presented a model ( the tidal - thermal - instability or tti model ) which combines the instabilities to explain the supercycle .",
    "he suggests that a normal outburst depletes the disk by less than the matter accumulated since the last outburst .",
    "the disk therefore grows over a succession of outbursts until , at the onset of another outburst , it expands beyond 0.46@xmath3 and becomes tidally unstable .",
    "the tidal dissipation of the eccentric state enhances the mass - flow through the disk , sustaining the disk in its hot state for a longer superoutburst , and so draining the disk of the majority of its material .",
    "once the disk has shrunk to @xmath20.35@xmath3 , neither the eccentricity nor the hot state can be sustained , and the disk reverts to a cold , circular quiescence , to begin the cycle anew .",
    "the tti model is successful in explaining typical su  uma stars , which have supercycles of 1001000 d. however , some su  uma stars ( those with abnormally short or abnormally long supercycles ) have outburst patterns that do nt fit the standard model .",
    "this has led hameury , lasota & warner ( 2000 ) to present alternative models involving evaporation of the inner disk and irradiation - induced increases in the mass - transfer rate .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to suggest that the tti model can , after all , explain the anomalous systems , given one alteration .",
    "the term ` wz  sge star ' is a shorthand for su  uma systems with supercycles lasting decades ( see fig .  1 ) .",
    "part of the explanation for this is that the mass - transfer rates , @xmath4 , are very low , typically 10@xmath5 g s@xmath6 , compared to 10@xmath7 g s@xmath6 for normal su  uma stars ( osaki 1995a ) .",
    "also , such stars rarely or never show normal outbursts between the superoutbursts .",
    "this implies that material does not accumulate in the inner disk , which requires an abnormally low viscosity , inner - disk evaporation , or a magnetic propeller ( e.g.  osaki 1995a ; hameury etal .",
    "2000 ; wynn , leach & king 2000 ) .",
    "however , i do not address this issue here .",
    "instead , my concern is the ` echo ' outbursts seen following superoutbursts in wz  sge stars .",
    "these were most striking in eg  cnc , which , after the first superoutburst for 19 years , showed a rapid succession of 6 shorter outbursts , spanning one month , before dropping by a further magnitude to full quiescence ( fig .  2 ; patterson etal .  1998 ) .",
    "similar , though less pronounced , echos have been seen in other wz  sge systems [ e.g.  al  com ( patterson etal .",
    "1996 ) , uz  boo ( kuulkers , howell & van paradijs 1996 ) , and wz  sge itself ( patterson etal .  1981 ) ] .",
    "the first problem raised by eg  cnc is that superhumps were seen throughout the period of echo outbursts , even during quiescence ( patterson etal .",
    "this contradicts the standard tti model , in which the superoutburst ends with both the thermal and tidal instabilities shutting down .",
    "the second problem is that the mean _ accretion _ rate is clearly higher over the echo period than in full quiescence . in the tti model",
    "this requires an ad - hoc increase of the quiescent viscosity to an alpha parameter , @xmath8 , of 0.1 ( osaki , shimuza &  tsugawa 1997 ) , a value more typical of a disk in outburst .",
    "alternatively , hameury etal .",
    "( 2000 ) have suggested that irradiation of the disk by a hot white dwarf produces the echos .",
    "the er  uma stars have short supercycles lasting 4050 days ( v1159  ori and er  uma itself ) , 2535 days ( di  uma ) and 19 days ( rz  lmi ) ( fig .  1 ; robertson , honeycutt &  turner 1995 ; kato etal .",
    "1999 ) .",
    "osaki ( 1995b ) has shown that , in the tti model , increasing the @xmath4  reduces the inter - outburst intervals , and thus leads to a shorter supercycle .",
    "however , this effect can reduce the supercycle only to @xmath240 days ( corresponding to @xmath4@xmath9 g s@xmath6 ) ; increasing @xmath4   further results in longer superoutbursts , and thus the supercycle lengthens again . to achieve a supercycle of only 19 days",
    ", the superoutburst must be truncated prematurely .",
    "osaki ( 1995c ) modelled rz  lmi s supercycle by artificially ending the superoutburst when the disk had shrunk from 0.46@xmath3 to only 0.42@xmath3 , whereas an end - value of 0.35@xmath3 is used for other su  uma stars .",
    "a second problem with er  uma stars is that they show superhumps beyond the end of the superoutburst , including in quiescence ( e.g.  patterson etal .",
    "this again violates the standard tti model since the disk radius is then at a minimum ( 0.26@xmath3 in the er  uma model of osaki 1995b , well inside the resonance zone at 0.46@xmath3 ) , and so should not show superhumps .",
    "in the standard tti model , the extra drain of angular momentum in an eccentric disk provides a sufficient mass - flow to ensure that the disk remains in the hot state , and thus the end of superoutburst requires the end of the eccentricity .",
    "however , the above difficulties are solved if the tidal and thermal instabilities are decoupled , allowing the superoutburst to end when a disk that is still eccentric drops out of the hot state .",
    "this , in any case , is virtually required by the observations of superhumps beyond the end of the superoutburst in er  uma and wz  sge systems .",
    "i suggest that the key factor causing this behaviour is an ultra - low mass ratio .",
    "3 shows the radius at which the disk is truncated by tidal effects , and also the radius of the 3:1 superhump resonance , both as a function of mass ratio , @xmath0 ( see whitehurst & king 1991 ) . for systems with @xmath0@xmath100.3 the disk can not extend to the resonance radius , and",
    "the binary is not an su  uma star . as the mass ratio decreases ,",
    "there is increasing room in the disk outside the 3:1-resonance radius . in this region ,",
    "other , weaker , higher - order resonances operate , and these eventually combine to produce the tidal limit .",
    "however , the lower the mass ratio , the more likely that matter can accumulate in regions of the disk outside 0.46@xmath3 , which , avoiding the main superhump resonance , interact less strongly with the secondary star , and so suffer a lower tidal dissipation of angular momentum , @xmath11 .",
    "another factor is that the strength of the tidal interaction decreases for lower mass ratios ( assuming a fixed orbital period and white - dwarf mass ) , and this might assist in decoupling the tidal and thermal instabilities at ultra - low mass ratios .",
    "however , it should be noted that the tidal interaction is generally stronger at shorter orbital periods , owing to the smaller size of the binary , which would counteract this effect .    in su",
    "uma stars we can investigate @xmath0 without having to measure masses , since @xmath0 correlates with the amount by which the superhump period exceeds the orbital period , @xmath12 , defined by @xmath12  = @xmath13 . the exact relation between @xmath12  and @xmath0 is not certain ( see , e.g. , patterson 1998 ; murray 2000 ) , but for current purposes we require only that @xmath12  increases monotonically with @xmath0 .    note that the stars giving difficulty to the tti model have exceptionally low values of @xmath12 , and thus @xmath0 ( fig .",
    "eg  cnc has the lowest value of all , followed by two other stars that have shown echos ( wz  sge and al  com ) .",
    "di  uma is one of two stars with supercycles shorter than 40 d , while @xmath12  for the other , rz  lmi , has not yet been measured .",
    "applying the idea to eg  cnc , i suggest that the disk was larger than 0.46@xmath3 and eccentric for the entire @xmath275-d period of superoutburst and echos ( again , this is required by the observation of superhumps thoughout this period by patterson etal .",
    "however , after 15 days of superoutburst the disk outside 0.46@xmath3 was depleted sufficiently to revert to the cool state  the lower tidal @xmath11 in this region could not drive the disk edge inward quickly enough to prevent this .",
    "thus a cooling wave , originating outside @xmath14a , ended the outburst .",
    "however , the enhanced @xmath11 from the 3:1 resonance did ensure an enhanced flow into the inner disk , and this triggered a new outburst , which originated in a heating wave from the inner disk .",
    "the fact that this outburst was short suggests that the heating wave petered out before reaching the edge of the disk , and thus a cooling wave quickly followed .",
    "thus a succession of short outbursts ensued , until the disk had depleted sufficiently to revert to the circular state .",
    "then , when @xmath11 declined , the mass - accretion rate dropped , and as the last superhumps died away the system faded to full quiescence .",
    "turning now to wz  sge and al  com , both of these systems , near the end of outbursts in 1978 and 1995 , respectively , showed a brief drop in magnitude followed by the resumption of the superoutburst ( patterson etal .  1981 ;",
    "patterson etal .",
    "this again suggests that the eccentric @xmath11 was insufficient to sustain the outer disk in the hot state , resulting in a cooling wave .",
    "but , in these systems , the heating wave did run right to the edge of the disk , and thus re - established the superoutburst .",
    "note that the first cooling waves in wz  sge and al  com occurred 2530 days after the start of superoutburst , whereas that in eg  cnc occurred much earlier , at 15 days .",
    "thus wz  sge and al  com appear to be systems on the borderline of showing the echos that are fully fledged in eg  cnc .      as noted above , supercycles shorter than @xmath240 days ( those of di  uma and rz  lmi ) require a premature end to the superoutburst . as in eg  cnc , i suggest that a cooling wave from the lower-@xmath11 region outside 0.46@xmath3 causes the disk to revert to the cold state while still eccentric .",
    "the early end to the superoutburst means that the disk retains a larger fraction of mass than is usual .",
    "this , and the enhanced @xmath11 from the 3:1-resonance region , means that the flow of material into the inner disk soon triggers another outburst .",
    "again , the heating wave does not propogate to the outer edge , and so the new outburst is short .",
    "such stars therefore exhibit ` echo ' outbursts identical to those in eg  cnc  short , but with superhumps .",
    "the difference is that in eg  cnc the mass - transfer rate , @xmath4 , was much lower than the mean mass - accretion rate , @xmath15 , during the echos .",
    "thus the disk shrank to quiescence . in rz  lmi and di",
    "uma @xmath4  is higher than @xmath15 , and the disk gains material until a heating wave _ does _ propogate to the outer edge of the disk , resulting in another superoutburst .",
    "the two other er  uma stars , v1159  ori and er  uma itself , have longer supercycles ( 43 and 48 d ) that can be explained in the tti model solely by a high @xmath4   ( osaki 1995b ) .",
    "further , their @xmath12  values imply mass ratios that are typical of su  umas ( fig .  4 ) .",
    "thus , the tti variant discussed above might be required only for rz  lmi and di  uma .",
    "however , the observation of superhumps in v1159  ori beyond the end of the superoutburst ( patterson etal.1995 ) suggests that the above ideas might come into play in all er  uma stars .      kuulkers etal .",
    "( 1996 ) have pointed out the similarities between soft x - ray transients and wz  sge stars .",
    "sxts are , for many intents and purposes , dwarf novae with a black hole replacing the white dwarf . the greater mass of the black hole in sxts ( @xmath1610m@xmath17 compared to a white dwarf s @xmath161m@xmath17 ) ensures that they have low mass ratios .",
    "thus it is notable that they can show echo outbursts ( most obviously in groj0422 + 32 , fig .  2 ; kuulkers etal .",
    "1996 ) along with quiescent superhumps around the time of the echo outbursts . from superhumps of groj0422 + 32 , odonoghue &  charles ( 1996 ) measure @xmath12=0.016 , which is lower than in most su  uma stars ( fig .",
    "i propose that the echos arise for the same reason as they do in eg  cnc : the ultra - low mass ratio allows the disk to cycle over the thermal instability while still in the eccentric state .",
    "note , though , that this requires that the greater irradiation of an sxt does not prevent the outer disk from cooling .",
    "perhaps the disk is convex , and the outer disk is shielded from the x - ray flux .",
    "osaki ( 1996 ) has outlined a unification model for cataclysmic variables in which the different outburst properties are controlled by the two parameters @xmath0 and @xmath4 .",
    "i propose that echo outbursts and ultra - short supercycles ( @xmath140 d ) can be brought into the same scheme , and that they occur in binaries with mass ratios of @xmath0@xmath10.07 . in such systems",
    "the superoutbursts end prematurely because the lower tidal @xmath11 outside the 3:1-resonance radius allows cooling and heating waves to run through the disk while it is in the eccentric state .",
    "this produces ` echo ' outbursts characterised by short durations and the presence of superhumps .",
    "if @xmath4  @xmath18 @xmath15  over the echo period , the system subsides to quiescence ( eg  cnc behavior ) ; if @xmath4  @xmath19 @xmath15 , another superoutburst results ( rz  lmi behavior ) .",
    "this model predicts that superhumps should be present ( even in quiescence ) thoughout echo periods , and perpetually in stars with ultra - short supercycles .",
    "also , any system showing these characteristics should have an exceptionally low value of the superhump excess @xmath12  and mass ratio @xmath0 .",
    "of the systems dicussed in this paper , we know @xmath12  for all except rz  lmi , the star with the shortest supercycle ; i predict that it has a value of @xmath12  even lower than the 0.013 found for di  uma .",
