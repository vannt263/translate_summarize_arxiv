    "a few important factors influence any successful synthesis of novel electronic materials : a reactivity of the used precursors , an applied type of the synthesis process ( solid state reaction , reactions in a liquid phase , reaction in a gas phase ) , and the thermodynamic parameters . beside temperature",
    "also pressure is a fundamental thermodynamic variable of every chemical reaction .",
    "an influence of the pressure on a solid state reaction depends on the kind of the applied pressure medium . with applying just a hydrostatic pressure",
    ", a reduced evaporation of the volatile components during synthesis , a structural rebuilding of the resulting solid ( bond lengths and coordination number change ) and higher reactivity ( reacting powder grains are brought closer together ) can be expected .",
    "if the applied gas medium is an active component of the system ( such as oxygen in the case of oxides ) the thermodynamic equilibrium will be changed .",
    "this causes modification of the phase diagrams and changes in the defect equilibria of a solid . in the case of oxidizing gases , especially oxygen",
    ", this can result in a stabilization of the unusually high oxidation states of cations and allow synthesis of compounds thermodynamically unstable in air , that is at low oxygen partial pressure .",
    "pyrochlore oxides containing transition metals show geometrical magnetic frustration , which is interesting because of a possible realization of novel , exotic , magnetic ground states .",
    "the cubic pyrochlore oxides ( @xmath3 ) have a general formula @xmath9 , where a is usually a trivalent rare earth metal and b is a tetravalent transition metal .",
    "pyrochlore structure is based on a network of corner - sharing @xmath10 octahedra similar as observed in perovskites @xmath11 .",
    "the a atoms are in the center of the hexagonal rings formed by oxygens ( o1 , located at the 48f positions ) with two more oxygens ( o2 , at the 8b positions ) located above and below the rings .",
    "both a and b cations in this structure are located in the corners of tetrahedra .",
    "such configuration can lead to a geometrical magnetic frustration .",
    "there are almost 20 tetravalent ions ( b - site ) , which can form pyrochlore compounds with rare earth ions ( a - site ) .",
    "subramanian and sleight @xcite have built a stability - field map for these materials , which displays the stability limits for the pyrochlore structure at ambient pressure depending on a so called stability range factor defined as ionic radius ratio @xmath12 .",
    "for stability at ambient pressure it lays in the range between 1.36 and 1.71 .",
    "based on this map it looks that the rare earth mn@xmath7 pyrochlores can not be synthesized at ambient pressure and require high pressures for the stabilization .",
    "this is mainly due to the small size of mn@xmath7 ion compared to the trivalent rare earth cations giving the stability range factor @xmath13 1.84 .",
    "the first report about successful synthesis of @xmath14 ( a= y , tl ) appeared in 1979 by fujinaka et al .",
    "both compounds were synthesized at 1000 - 1100@xmath2c and pressures 3 - 6gpa .",
    "about ten years later high pressure synthesis of @xmath14 ( a = sc , y , in , tl , tb - lu ) at pressures 5 - 8gpa and temperatures 1000 - 1500@xmath2c @xcite and a = y , dy - lu by a hydrothermal method in sealed gold ampules at 0.3 gpa and 500@xmath2c @xcite was reported .",
    "later shimakawa et al .",
    "@xcite used a hot isostatic press method at 1000 - 1300@xmath2c and only 0.4 kbar for the series with a = in , y , and lu while for a = tl material still 2.5 gpa and 1000@xmath2c in a piston - cylinder apparatus was required .",
    "all the above synthesises were done in anvils with solid state pressure medium without controlled oxygen pressure atmosphere . according to the recent review of gardner et al .",
    "@xcite all these materials appear to be ferromagnets .",
    "although a variety of the preparative conditions were applied , an excellent agreement of the structural parameters was achieved by different groups is excellent .    in comparison to other pyrochlore families such as @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 @xcite ,",
    "@xmath19 system was not much explored ( especially some compositions as @xmath0 for example ) , perhaps due to ambient pressure instability and consequently a non trivial synthesis . to the best of our knowledge",
    "there were only two groups at the end of eighties reporting on the synthesis of @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "magnetisation studies were done for @xmath0 .",
    "discrepant values for the curie temperature @xmath20 ( 14k @xcite and 30(5)k @xcite ) and the curie - weiss constant @xmath21 ( + 56(8 ) ) @xcite ) were reported .",
    "the observed large and positive @xmath21 value indicates strong ferromagnetic exchange interactions between the mn moments . at low temperatures a sharp increase in the susceptibility again indicating a possibility for a long - range ferromagnetic order was observed .    in this work",
    "we report new studies of the magnetic properties of @xmath22 obtained by an oxidation of @xmath23 at 1100 @xmath2c and 1300 bar oxygen pressure .",
    "as @xmath24 cation has one of the smallest radius among the rare earth elements and consequently the tolerance factor is also the smallest , it has a big magnetic moment and a low neutron absorbtion and no neutron diffraction studies were performed for @xmath0 up to now , we have decided to undertake investigation of this compound , synthesized by a novel high pressure oxygen method .",
    "the following reagents were used : @xmath25 ( 99.99% aldrich ) and @xmath26 ( 99.997% alfa aestar ) . at first @xmath1 was synthesized by a standard solid state reaction .",
    "the respective amounts of the starting reagents were mixed , milled and calcined at 1000 - 1200@xmath27 c during 100 h in air with intermediate grindings .",
    "the synthesized material was found to be phase pure ( hexagonal phase ) as proved by laboratory powder x - ray diffraction .",
    "@xmath0 was obtained by an oxidation of 3 g of the starting material at 1100@xmath27 c and 1300 bar oxygen pressure during 20 hours in the high pressure setup @xcite .",
    "the volume of oxygen used during the synthesis in in this setup is reduced to 20@xmath8 by using double - chamber construction .",
    "the sample was placed in an alumina crucible connected tightly to an oxygen supply system of the autoclave .",
    "the crucible was placed in the furnace in the high - pressure chamber . in this chamber",
    "the oxygen pressure in the crucible is balanced by the equal argon pressure outside the crucible . in this way , the volume of the oxygen under high pressure is only up to 20@xmath8 , whereas the volume of the whole chamber is about 4000@xmath8 .",
    "both pressures were balanced by an electronic pressure control unit with remote control valves .",
    "oxygen content in the sample was determined by a thermogravimetric ( tg ) hydrogen reduction performed on netzsch sta 449c analyser equipped with pfeiffer vacuum thermostar mass spectrometer .",
    "the same tg analyser was used for the determination of the temperature stability range of the sample in pure helium and artificial air ( 21 % ( vol . ) oxygen in helium ) .",
    "ac and dc magnetization ( @xmath28 ) measurements were performed using quantum design ppms at temperatures ranging from 2 to 300  k. the ac field amplitude and the frequency were 0.1  mt and 0.05  mt and 1000  hz , respectively .",
    "neutron powder diffraction measurements were carried out at the high - resolution hrpt diffractometer @xcite at sinq neutron spallation source ( psi , switzerland ) .",
    "the refinements of the crystal structure parameters were done using fullprof  @xcite program , with the use of its internal tables for neutron scattering lengths .",
    "the symmetry analysis was performed using isodistort tool based on isotropy software @xcite , basirep program @xcite and software tools of bilbao crystallographic server @xcite .",
    "the laboratory x - ray diffraction measurements , which were done at room temperature using cu k@xmath29 radiation on a brucker d8 diffractometer , have proven that the the product of the oxidation reaction is a phase pure compound with the cubic pyrochlore structure .",
    "oxygen content determined by the thermogravimetric hydrogen reduction @xcite was found to be 7.02(5 ) .",
    "figure  [ tg_h2 ] shows a thermogravimetric curve of the hydrogen reduction of @xmath0 sample together with a mass spectrometric signal for the water created during reduction ( m / e = 18 ) .",
    "the thermal stability range of the synthesized compound was also checked by thermogravimerty .",
    "figure  [ tg2 ] shows thermogravimetric curves of @xmath0 sample heated in helium and artificial air .",
    "the thermal stability of the compound increases with the increase of the oxygen partial pressure . in helium @xmath0 starts to decompose at 850@xmath2 , while in air it is stable up to 950@xmath2 . using laboratory x - ray we have identified the product of the thermal decomposition , which is hexagonal @xmath1 .",
    "opposite to the previous reports , where the synthesis was done starting from oxides@xcite , here we have obtained a pure phase compound by converting @xmath1 at 1100 @xmath2c and 1300 bar oxygen pressure into @xmath0 .",
    "this is a new promising route to stabilize mn@xmath7 pyrochlores thermodinamically unstable at ambient pressure .",
    "the chemical reaction is reversible , and on heating starting from 850@xmath2 ( at low oxygen partial pressures ) @xmath0 transforms back to @xmath1 .",
    "figure  [ magn](a ) shows the real part of the ac susceptibility measured at 0.1  mt and 0.05  mt and 1000  hz indicating a very sharp maximum at temperature around 25k , similar to the observed in @xmath30 @xcite , @xmath31 and @xmath32 @xcite . on the figure  [ magn](b )",
    "magnetic moment as a function of the applied field is plotted for @xmath0 at 5k that is below the magnetic transition .",
    "no saturation magnetization behavior was observed up to 5 t. this was already previously noticed for @xmath0 by troyanchuk at al @xcite .",
    "the authors @xcite proposed that the value of the f - d exchange in this compound is smaller than that in other rare earth - manganese pyrochlores and the magnetic moment of the tm@xmath33 ion is in a paramagnetic state .",
    "the neutron diffraction studies have shown , that the synthesized material contains a pure phase of a well known @xcite pyrochlore cubic structure with the space group @xmath3 ( no . 227 ) .",
    "figure  [ diff30k ] shows the powder neutron diffraction pattern and the rietveld refinement curve for  at t=30k , above the curie temperature @xmath34  k. structural parameters are listed in the table  [ tab_str ] .",
    "note that in the pyrochlore structure tm and mn occupy the positions in the inversion centres and their positions can be swapped , provided that the oxygen positions are also accordingly modified .",
    "so , in this second equivalent description of the structure oxygen o1 occupies 8b - position ( , , ) , o2 remains at the same ( 48f)-position , but @xmath35 should be changed to -@xmath35 + .",
    "figure  [ diff5 - 30k ] shows the rietveld refinement pattern and the difference plot of the difference magnetic neutron diffraction pattern between 5k and 30k .",
    "all magnetic peaks are indexed with propagation vector k=0 . the main contribution to",
    "the magnetic intensity originates from the ferromagnetic ordering of both types of magnetic atoms mn and tm .",
    "however , there is a small but well visible afm - contribution .",
    "for example , the magnetic bragg peaks ( 200 ) and ( 220 ) shown in the inset of [ diff5 - 30k ] have no fm contribution .",
    "the experimental intensity of the very first magnetic peak ( 111 ) is also underestimated without afm contribution .",
    "the magnetic atoms mn and tm occupy the positions ( 16d ) and ( 16c ) , which have the same symmetry @xmath36 .",
    "the decomposition of the magnetic representation for them into irreducible representations ( irreps ) of @xmath37-point reads @xmath38 with the dimensions of irreps 1d , 2d , 3d and 3d respectively . the nomenclature for the irreps is given according to ref .",
    "@xcite with kovalev s notation in the parentheses .",
    "in is known from the magnetic susceptibility data and also from the previous neutron diffraction works @xcite on similar pyrochlores , that the magnetic structure is ferromagnetic ( fm ) .",
    "this fact imposes restrictions on the possible irrep involved in the magnetic transition .",
    "one dimensional real irrep @xmath39 resulting in @xmath40 shubnikov magnetic space group ( msg ) does not allow fm configuration .",
    "two dimensional real irrep @xmath41 does not allow fm , as well for any direction of the order parameter ( op ) in the configuration space , resulting in magnetic group @xmath42 for the general op - direction @xmath43 .",
    "the magnetic modes generated by three dimensional real irrep @xmath44 are also non - fm .",
    "the only irrep that allows ferromagnetism is @xmath45 .",
    "however , the representational approach alone is not of the big help here because this 3d irrep enters two times in the magnetic decomposition resulting in at least six independent normal modes for each sort of the atoms , i.e. twelve parameters to be refined .",
    "this general case of irrep @xmath45 corresponds to op direction @xmath46 and lowers symmetry down to the triclinic shubnikov group @xmath47 .",
    "more restrictive by symmetry approach is to use shubnikov magnetic group symmetry .",
    "there are three special directions of the order parameter @xmath48 , @xmath49 and @xmath50 that generate @xmath4 , @xmath51 and @xmath52 isotropy subgroups , respectively .",
    "each of the above op directions result in only one magnetic mode for @xmath45 ( magnetic mode defines specific magnetic configuration on all atoms of the same type and has only one parameter to be determined experimentally - it s amplitude ) .",
    "the first two subgroups are the maximal subgroups of the grey paramagnetic group @xmath53 .",
    "the group @xmath52 is not the maximal subgroup of the paramagnetic group , but is a subgroup of non - fm maximal subgroup @xmath40 , which is generated by @xmath39 .",
    "for this reason , there is an additional independent antiferromagnetic mode in @xmath52 that makes magnetic atoms of the same kind inequivalent .",
    "the magnetic group @xmath51 is a maximal subgroup and generated by a single irrep , but accidentally it can be also generated by @xmath44 with op direction @xmath54-@xmath55 .",
    "this is a rare exceptional case when two different irreps have the same msg as the isotropy subgroup .",
    "so , for the magnetic group @xmath51 one has an additional afm mode as well , similar to the case of @xmath52 .",
    "the most symmetric solution is given by the maximal tetragonal subgroup @xmath4 that forces all spins of the same type of atom ( mn or tm ) to be the same by symmetry , being the highest allowable by the symmetry solution .",
    "since @xmath45 enters the magnetic decomposition twice there are two parameters to be refined : the fm component along z and afm component in the perpendicular plane for each type of magnetic atoms tm and mn . the magnetic structure details and the refined magnetic moments are shown in table  [ tab_str ] .",
    "as mentioned above we can not distinguish between tm and mn positions in the magnetic structure because they are the only atoms with the magnetic contribution .",
    "so , the assignment of the moments per atom type is conditional .",
    "interestingly that the afm component of moment is converged to the non - zero value for only one type of atom , which has smaller value of fm component and smaller overall spin ( it is labeled as mn in the table ) .",
    "the only way to distinguish tm from mn would be by using the small differences in @xmath56 dependence of the magnetic form - factors @xmath57 of @xmath58 and @xmath24 ions , but our experimental accuracy does not allow this .",
    "figure  [ mstr_sh ] shows the best fit magnetic configuration with the parameters from table  [ tab_str ] .",
    "figure  [ mtdep ] shows temperature dependence the lattice constant refined in the cubic metric of @xmath3 space group .",
    "one can see an abrupt increase in the lattice constant below @xmath20 implying a presence of a spin - lattice interaction .",
    "ferromagnetic ordering is not possible in the cubic symmetry and the best magnetic structure solution that we have found is in the tetragonal symmetry . to further check possible tetragonal distortions we performed the following analisys",
    "we have made the fit of the crystal metric as a function of temperature in @xmath4 magnetic group keeping all structure parameters fixed by the cubic structure and with the peak shape parameters fixed by their values above @xmath20 .",
    "figure  [ tetradist ] shows @xmath59 and @xmath60 lattice constants ( top ) and the magnetic moment components ( bottom ) as a function of temperature .",
    "one can see , that below @xmath61 there is a pronounced split of the lattice constants .",
    "the distortions are significantly bigger than the change in a cubic constant a , because the tetragonal lattice constants a and c increase and decrease respectively below @xmath61 , which is accompanied with the increase in the magnetic moments .",
    "in this work we show a novel way of conversion of a thermodynamically stable a hexagonal @xmath1 ( space group @xmath5 ) compound to the metastable @xmath0 with the cubic pyrochlore - type of structure at 1100 @xmath2c and 1300 bar oxygen pressure .",
    "the unique high temperature high pressure apparatus used in this work allows to synthesize materials in @xmath8 amount , sufficient to collect good quality neutron scattering data .",
    "new studies of magnetic properties of @xmath0 by means of a high resolution neutron powder diffraction have shown , that below 25k there is a transition to a ferromagnetically ordered phase with additional antiferromagnetic canting suggesting the crystal symmetry is lower than cubic one . using symmetry analysis presented here in details ,",
    "we have found the most symmetry restrictive maximal shubnikov subgroup @xmath4 , that fits the experimental data very well .",
    "the magnetic transition is accompanied by well visible magnetostriction effect .",
    "we acknowledge the allocation of the beam time at the hrpt diffractometer of the laboratory for neutron scattering and imaging ( psi , switzerland ) .",
    "the authors thank snf sinergia project `` mott physics beyond heisenberg model '' for the support of this study .",
