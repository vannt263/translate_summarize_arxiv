    "this would not have been achievable if the weight matrices were randomly allocated .",

    "the value of the minimum determinant @xcite obtained for this code is 10.24 for 4-/16-qam and this was verified by exhaustive computer search .",
    "the rate-2 code described above has the same coding gain and ml - decoding complexity as the one presented in @xcite .    to obtain a full - rate for 3 and 4 receive antennas , we need to obtain the remaining 8 and 16 weight matrices by multiplying the weight matrices of the ciod and the rate-2 code",

    "is obtained from independent codeword matrices of 4 separate ssd codes .",
    "this property will be exploited in the next section to achieve reduced ml - decoding complexity .",
    "the rate-2 code whose codeword matrix is given in has a minimum determinant of 10.24 for 4-qam .",
    "the corresponding minimum determinant of the punctured perfect code is 3.6304 .",
    "the minimum determinants of both the codes have been calculated for 4-qam with the average codeword energy being 16 units , i.e , @xmath100 . as a result of a higher minimum determinant and hence a better coding gain ,",
    "our rate-2 code is expected to perform better than the punctured perfect code .",
    "for 3 receive antennas , our rate-3 code whose codeword matrix is given in does not offer full - diversity .",
    "it can be noted that the rate-3 code is obtained by multiplexing a full - diversity rate-2 code and a full - diversity rate-1 code . in other words ,",
    "each codeword matrix of our code has two individual sub - codeword matrices - one sub - codeword matrix belonging to the full - diversity rate-2 code and the other belonging to the full - diversity rate-1 code .",
    "we say that our rate-3 code has two _ embedded _ full - diversity codes in it . hence , though the rate-3 code may not have full - diversity , meaning which its minimum determinant is zero , the number of codeword difference matrices which are not full - ranked is lesser than it would be if the rate-3 code were constructed using arbitrary weight matrices .",
    "this is because there are many instances when two codewords of the rate-3 code are such that their codeword difference matrix is the same as one of the codeword difference matrices of one of the embedded full - diversity codes ( this happens when the two codewords of the rate-3 code have a common sub - codeword matrix ) .",
    "further , even if the two codewords of the rate-3 code do not have a common sub - codeword matrix , their difference matrix might still be full - ranked .",
    "hence , in comparison to the number of codeword difference matrices of the rate-3 code , the number of non full - ranked codeword difference matrices is very small .",
    "a similar arguement can be done for the rate-4 code , which is full - rate for @xmath16 and can be seen from to have two embedded full - diversity rate-2 codes .",
    "hence , we expect the rate-3 and the rate-4 codes to perform very well atleast in the low and medium snr range .",
    "simulation results presented later confirm our expectations .      ' '' ''",
    "the ml - decoding complexity of a code depends on the weight matrices of the code @xcite .",
    "our proposed design is such that for any number of receive antennas , reduced ml - decoding can be achieved . to see this ,",
    "our code whose codeword matrix is as shown in consists of 4 multiplexed rate-1 ssd codes .",
    "this means that for @xmath102 , @xmath103 ssd codes can be multiplexed so that the code rate is @xmath103 complex symbols per channel use .",
    "so , for any @xmath103 , one can fix the last @xmath104 symbols and decode the first 4 symbols independently ( with an additional complexity increase by a factor of only @xmath7 ) .",
    "thus , for any number of receive antennas , the worst case ml - decoding complexity is of the order of @xmath105 .",
    "this results in a reduction in ml - decoding complexity by a factor of @xmath15 with respect to the perfect code for general constellations .",

    "the structure of the above @xmath124-matrix is due to the fact that the codeword matrix of our code is comprised of multiplexed ssd - codeword matrices .",
    "note that for the ciod , the entanglement between the real and the imaginary parts of a symbol is due to the constellation rotation , which is employed for full - diversity .",
    "this can also be checked by direct computation .",
    "correspondingly , for the perfect code , the matrix @xmath129 in is as shown at the top of the next page .",
    "[ cols= \" < , < , < , < , < \" , ]     clearly , the @xmath124-matrix for our code has more zero entries than the @xmath124-matrix of the perfect code .",
    "this means that the interference between symbols is lesser for our code than for the perfect code .",
    "a consequence of this is that when qam constellations are employed , the average ml - decoding complexity using a sphere decoder @xcite is much lesser than the worst case ml - decoding complexity of @xmath105 .",
    "note that the worst case ml - decoding complexity of our code is lower than that of the perfect code by a factor of @xmath15 only for non - rectangular qam constellations .",
    "but for square - qam constellations of size @xmath7 , where the real and the imaginary parts of a signal point can be independently decoded , the ml - decoding of our code can be reduced further by a factor of @xmath130 ( from @xmath105 to @xmath131 ) by quantizing ( the details are presented in @xcite ) and the decoding complexity of the perfect code can be reduced by a factor of @xmath8 ( from @xmath132 to @xmath133 ) .",
    "this is achieved by noting from the @xmath124-matrix structure for the perfect code that the real parts of the symbols @xmath134 and @xmath135 can be independently decoded from imaginary parts for square qam constellations and this reduces the complexity by a factor of @xmath9 and using quantizing further reduces the complexity by a factor of @xmath130 .",
