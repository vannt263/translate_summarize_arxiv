    "the behavior of doped mott insulators is a long - standing open and challenging problem in condensed - matter physics .",
    "mott insulators are the parent states of all strongly correlated electronic systems and as such play a crucial role in our understanding of high-@xmath0 superconductors ( htsc ) and many other systems .",
    "their strongly correlated nature implies that their behavior can not be understood in terms of weakly coupled models . except for the very special case of one spatial dimension ,",
    "the physics of doped mott insulators is currently only understood at a qualitative level .",
    "the solution of this challenging problem remains one of the most important directions of research in condensed - matter physics .",
    "quantum dimer models ( qdm)@xcite provide a simplified , and rather crude , description of the physics of a mott insulator . they provide a correct description of the physics of mott insulators in regimes in which the spin excitations have a large spin gap .",
    "qdms were proposed originally within the context of the resonating - valence bond ( rvb ) mechanism of htsc.@xcite these systems are of great interest as they can yield hints on the behavior of more realistic models of quantum frustration .",
    "the main idea behind the formulation of qdms is that , if the spin gap is large , the spin degrees of freedom become confined in tightly bound singlet states which , in the extreme limit of a very large spin gap , extend only over distance scales of the order of nearest - neighbor sites of the lattice .",
    "thus , in this extreme regime , the hilbert space can be approximately identified ( up to some important caveats@xcite ) with the coverings of the lattice by valence bonds or dimers .",
    "surprisingly , even at the level of the oversimplified picture offered by qdms , the physics of doped mott insulators remains poorly understood . in this paper",
    "we explore the phase diagrams , and the properties of their phases , of qdms generalized to include interactions between dimers ( or valence bonds ) , and between dimers and doped ( charged ) holes .",
    "basic aspects of the physics of these models are reviewed in ref .   and references therein .",
    "undoped qdms have been studied more extensively and by now they are relatively well understood.@xcite on bipartite lattices , their ground states show either long - range crystalline valence bond order of different sorts or are quantum critical,@xcite while on non - bipartite lattices their ground states are typically disordered and are topological fluids.@xcite    the more physically relevant _ doped _ qdms , with a finite density of charge carriers ( holes ) , are much less understood , although some properties are known.@xcite in qdms a spin-@xmath1 hole fractionalizes into a bosonic _ holon _ , an excitation that carries charge but no spin , and a _ spinon _ , a fermionic excitation that carries spin but no charge.@xcite holons can be regarded as sites that do not belong to any dimer , whereas spinon pairs are broken dimers .",
    "this form of electron fractionalization is observable in the spectrum of these systems only in the topological disordered ( spin - liquid ) phases of the undoped qdm .",
    "otherwise , as in the case of the valence bond crystalline states which exhibit long range dimer order , spinons and holons are _ confined _ and do not exist as independent excitations.@xcite    in this paper , we consider several interacting qdms on a square lattice at finite hole doping , and discuss their possible phases and phase transitions as a function of hole density and strength of the interactions . at any finite amount of doping",
    "the system will have a finite density of holes , which are hard core charged bosons in this description . to simplify the problem , in this work",
    "we do not consider the physical effects of the charge - neutral fermionic spinons which in principle should also be present .",
    "thus , at this level of approximation , all spin - carrying excitations are effectively projected out .",
    "the remaining degrees of freedom are thus dimers ( `` spin - singlet valence bonds '' ) and charged hard - core bosonic holes .",
    "already this simplified picture of a strongly correlated system is very non - trivial .    for a certain relation between its coupling constants , known as the rokhsar - kivelson ( rk )",
    "condition,@xcite qdm hamiltonians , both with and without holes , can be written as a sum of projection operators .",
    "these rk hamiltonians are manifestly positive definite operators . for this choice of couplings ,",
    "the ground - state wave function is a zero - energy state which is known exactly .",
    "rk wave function _ is a local function of the degrees of freedom of the qdm , the local dimer and hole densities .",
    "the quantum - mechanical amplitudes of the rk wave functions turn out to have the same form as the gibbs weights of a two - dimensional ( 2d ) _ classical _ dimer problem with a finite density of holes . for the generalized doped qdms that we consider ,",
    "the norm of the exact ground - state wave function is equal to the partition function of a system of interacting classical dimers at finite hole density .",
    "this mapping to a 2d classical statistical mechanical system , for which there is a wealth of available results and methods , makes this class of problems solvable.@xcite    in this work we will investigate the behavior of doped qdms which satisfy the rk conditions by studying the correlations encoded in their ground state wave functions .",
    "the phase diagrams of these systems turn out to be quite rich . as we shall see",
    ", these simple models can describe many aspects of the physics of interest in strongly correlated systems , including a dimer - hole liquid phase ( a bose - einstein condensate of holes ) , valence - bond crystalline states , phase separation , and more general inhomogeneous phases .",
    "the undoped version of this system was studied in detail in ref .  , where a quantum phase transition was found that was argued to belong to the kosterlitz - thouless ( kt ) universality class , from a critical phase to a columnar state with long - range order .",
    "in this paper we confirm that this is indeed the case . at finite hole density ,",
    "hitherto available results are limited to the form of the associated rk qdm hamiltonian@xcite and numerical results for small systems .",
    "in this work we employ analytic methods@xcite combined with advanced classical monte carlo ( mc ) simulations@xcite to probe the correlations in the _ doped _ rk wave functions , investigate the phase diagram and its phase transitions .",
    "the methods used here can be readily generalized to the case of non - bipartite lattices , for which a number of important results have been published.@xcite in section [ sec : hamiltonians ] , we describe the construction of two generalized quantum dimer rk hamiltonians that we used in our study .",
    "a similar but independent construction has been presented by castelnovo and coworkers@xcite and by poilblanc and coworkers@xcite .",
    "the rk wave functions of these generalizations of the quantum dimer model have either a fixed number of holes or a variable number of holes and a fixed hole fugacity .",
    "the ground - state wave functions of both models at their associated rk points correspond to a canonical dimer - monomer system in the canonical and grand - canonical ensembles respectively . near the end of the paper , in section [ sec : hole - int ] ,",
    "we introduce a third hamiltonian , with an associated rk wave function , to study the effects of hole interactions which compete with phase separation at the first - order transitions that we find for both models .    in sections [",
    "sec : mean - field ] and  [ sec : exact - critical - behavior ] we study the correlations and the phase diagram for the ground states encoded in these wave functions by means of an analysis of the equivalent classical statistical system of dimers and holes for the rk hamiltonians of section [ sec : hamiltonians ] . in section [ sec : mean - field ] we summarize the results of a mean - field theory for both non - interacting and interacting classical dimer models at finite doping .",
    "the details of the mean - field theory are presented in appendix [ app : mean - field - details ] , where we compute the hole - hole correlation function and derive a qualitative phase diagram as a function of hole density and dimer interaction parameters .",
    "the main result of this simple mean - field theory is that the phase diagram at finite hole density contains two phases , a dimer - hole fluid and a columnar dimer solid .",
    "the columnar - liquid transition is continuous at weak coupling and turns first order at a tricritical point .",
    "naturally , the critical and tricritical behavior are not correctly described by the mean - field theory , although the general topology of the phase diagram is correct and , remarkably , even the location of the tricritical point is consistent with what we find in the mc simulations of section  [ sec : mc ] .    in section  [ sec : exact - critical - behavior ] we present a detailed analytic theory of the critical behavior of interacting classical dimers . sections [ sec : zero - density ] and  [ sec : finite - density ] focus on the field - theoretic coulomb - gas approach for this model at zero and finite doping , respectively .",
    "we show that , up to a critical value of a parameter , the undoped rk wave function describes a critical system with continuously varying critical exponents , with a phase transition ( belonging to the 2d kt universality class ) to a state with long - range columnar order . at finite hole doping",
    "we find a hole - dimer liquid phase ( with short - range correlations ) and a stable phase with long - range columnar order . at low hole densities",
    "the phase boundary is a line of fixed points with varying exponents ending at a kt - type multicritical point where the transition becomes first order .",
    "we present a field - theoretical treatment of this tricritical point and a theory of the evolution of the behavior of the columnar and orientational order parameters and of their susceptibilities along the phase boundary . past the tricritical point",
    "the system is found to exhibit a strong tendency to phase separation , which we verify in our numerical simulations ( section  [ sec : mc ] ) . in section  [ sec : hole - int ]",
    "we consider the effects of direct hole - hole interactions near the first - order phase boundary , and discuss one of the many inhomogeneous phases which arise in this regime instead of phase separation .    in section [ sec : mc ]",
    "we confirm our analytic predictions via extensive classical mc simulations of the generalized rk wave functions .",
    "for the study of the line of critical points at low doping we employ the canonical generalized geometric cluster algorithm ( ggca ) , whereas the first - order transition is studied via grand - canonical metropolis - type simulations .",
    "the ggca algorithm enables us to study relatively large systems , up to @xmath2 , for a range of dopings , @xmath3 , and to investigate the finite - size scaling behavior .",
    "the accessible range of system sizes should be compared to what can be reached for full quantum models , away from the rk condition , where available methods , such as exact diagonalization and green function monte carlo , allow the study of only very small systems with few holes.@xcite    in the undoped case we confirm the existence of a kosterlitz - thouless transition from a line of critical points to an ordered columnar state , as found in the work of alet and coworkers.@xcite we study the scaling behavior of the columnar and orientational order parameters and of their susceptibilities .",
    "we also use a mapping of the orientational order parameter of the interacting classical dimer model to the staggered polarization operator obtained by baxter for the six - vertex model@xcite to fit our mc data and find an accurate estimate of the kt transition coupling in the undoped case .    at low doping",
    ", we study the transition from the dimer - hole fluid phase to the columnar state .",
    "we confirm that the scaling dimension of the columnar order parameter operator is equal to @xmath4 , as predicted by our analytic results of section [ sec : finite - density ] .",
    "we also present a typical set of data that demonstrates how the scaling dimension of the orientational order parameter varies , again in agreement with the analytic results of section [ sec : finite - density ] , and use these results to locate numerically the phase boundary .",
    "we then turn to the behavior at larger doping and stronger couplings where the transition becomes first order .",
    "we study this regime using grand - canonical metropolis monte carlo simulations .",
    "we confirm the first - order nature of the phase transition by means of a careful analysis of the finite - size scaling behavior of the order parameters across the phase boundary and of their susceptibilities .",
    "we use these results to locate the phase boundary in the first - order regime as well . in section",
    "[ sec : hole - int ] , we use mc simulations to study the effects of a direct hole - hole repulsion which suppresses the effects of phase separation , leading instead to a complex phase diagram of inhomogeneous phases , of which we only study its most commensurate case .    in section  [ sec : sma ] , we study the elementary quantum excitations of the doped qdms satisfying the rk condition using the single - mode approximation .",
    "we only present the main results and have relegated the details to appendix  [ app : fks ] .",
    "we find that in the dimer - hole liquid phase , hole and dimer density fluctuations have quadratic dispersions @xmath5 .",
    "thus this phase should be characterized as a bose - einstein condensate of bosonic charged particles ( holes ) , but not really a superfluid , for reasons similar to those of rokhsar and kivelson.@xcite we summarize our overall conclusions in section [ sec : conclusions ] .    while this manuscript was being completed ( and refereed )",
    "a number of independent studies of aspects of this problem have been published.@xcite our results agree with those in these references wherever they overlap , as noted throughout this paper .",
    "the hamiltonian of the quantum dimer model ( qdm ) can be written in the rokhsar - kivelson ( rk ) form@xcite as the sum of a set of mutually non - commuting projection operators @xmath6 , @xmath7 where @xmath8 denotes the set of all plaquettes of the square lattice . each projection operator",
    "@xmath6 acts on the states of the dimers and holes of a plaquette @xmath9 ( or set of plaquettes surrounding @xmath9 ) . in the simplest case@xcite",
    "each @xmath6 acts only on the states labeled by the dimer occupation numbers of the links of the plaquette @xmath9 . in this case , the ground state is described by the short - range rvb wave function@xcite @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the set of ( fully packed ) dimer coverings of the 2d square lattice , and @xmath12 is a complete set of orthonormal states .",
    "if one regards the dimers as spin singlet states ( with the spins residing on the lattice sites ) each configuration represents a set of spin singlets or valence - bonds.@xcite the dimer representation ignores the over - completeness of the valence bond singlet states.@xcite this problem can be made parametrically small using a number of schemes , including large @xmath13 approximations@xcite and decorated generalizations of the spin-@xmath14 hamiltonians.@xcite    it is possible and straightforward to generalize the qdm construction so as to include other types of interactions and coverings . in ref .",
    "it was shown how to extend this structure to smoothly interpolate between the square and the triangular lattices .",
    "it was also shown there that the same ideas can be used to construct a quantum generalization of the two - dimensional classical baxter ( or eight - vertex ) model . in all of these cases ,",
    "the rk form of this generalized quantum dimer model has an exact ground - state wave function whose amplitudes are equal to the statistical ( gibbs ) weights of an associated two - dimensional classical statistical mechanical system on the same lattice .",
    "thus , if the classical problem happens to be a classical critical system , the associated wave function now describes a 2d problem at a quantum critical point . in ref .",
    "such quantum critical points were dubbed `` conformal quantum critical points '' since the long - distance structure of their _ ground - state wave functions _ exhibits 2d conformal invariance .",
    "here we are interested in a different generalization of the qdm in which we consider dimer coverings ( although not necessarily fully packed ) of the square lattice . we will also consider 2d hamiltonians whose wave functions correspond to classical interacting 2d dimer problems with local weights .",
    "similar but independent constructions have also been proposed.@xcite    trying to be as physical and local as possible , we keep the quantum - resonance terms as simple as before ( single plaquette moves ) , but the potential terms ( which again have a central plaquette@xcite ) now have fine - tuned couplings that depend on the nearby plaquettes . explicitly , we have ( cf .",

    "has the same form as a grand partition function for dimer coverings of the square lattice .",
    "this partition function now depends not only on the interaction  @xmath41 defined below eq .  , but also on the hole chemical potential @xmath42 .",
    "since the canonical and grand - canonical ensembles become equivalent in the thermodynamic limit , the two ground - state wave functions and   must correspond to the same ground - state physics .",
    "furthermore , it is clear that for @xmath43 the models are located at the usual rk point of the quantum dimer model on the square lattice . for a system with periodic boundary conditions ,",
    "each configuration @xmath44 contains only an _ even _ number of holes , with half of the holes on either sublattice .",
    "we remark that the fact that the exact ground - state wave function is a sum ( as opposed to a product ) of the ground states of sectors labeled by the number of holes on the lattice , is due to the resonance term that we have used to represent the motion of holes .",
    "in particular , we have assumed that a dimer can _ break _ into two holes which themselves repel each other . in the limit of very strong hole - hole repulsions , in strong - coupling perturbation theory ,",
    "it is straightforward to recover a fixed - hole density sector with a single - hole resonance move involving three sites in any direction ; the coupling strength in eq .   then becomes @xmath45 , and thus , in the limit @xmath46 , it reduces to an effective hopping amplitude for the holes .",
    "to examine the physics described by the ground - state wave functions obtained in the previous section we start with a discussion of a mean - field theory of the phase diagram .",
    "we use the standard approach of regarding the probability densities , obtained by squaring the wave function , as the gibbs weights of a classical two - dimensional system and focus on the interacting dimer model on the square lattice at finite hole density .",
    "although mean - field theory is insufficient to describe two - dimensional critical systems , it is a useful tool to obtain qualitative features of the phase diagram as well as the behavior deep in the phases , away from criticality .",
    "the details of this theory are presented in appendix  [ app : mean - field - details ] .",
    "we begin by constructing a grassmann representation of the partition function for an interacting dimer model using the standard methods introduced by samuel.@xcite the resulting theory involves grassmann ( anti - commuting ) variables residing on the sites of the square lattice .",
    "the action of the grassmann integral is non - trivial and is parametrized by the hole fugacity @xmath47 and a coupling between dimers @xmath48 , where @xmath31 .",
    "since the action of the resulting grassmann path integral is not quadratic in the grassmann variables , it can not be reduced to the computation of a determinant .",
    "thus , we use a standard mean - field approach which , in this case , involves the introduction of two hubbard - stratonovich ( bosonic ) fields @xmath49 and @xmath50 , defined on the sites and links of the square lattice respectively . upon integrating out the grassmann variables one obtains an effective theory for the fields @xmath49 and @xmath50 which , as usual , is solved within a saddle - point expansion .",
    "the dimer @xmath51 and hole @xmath52 densities , as well as the columnar order parameter @xmath53 , can be expressed straightforwardly in terms of the fields @xmath49 and @xmath50 . from this effective theory",
    "one can compute an effective potential @xmath54 and the configurations of the observables of interest , @xmath52 , @xmath51 and @xmath53 , as functions of @xmath47 and @xmath55 , and determine the phase diagram .    as a function of hole density ( or hole fugacity ) and @xmath41",
    ", we find that the phase diagram has two phases ( shown qualitatively in fig .",
    "[ fig : sketch ] ) , namely a dimer - hole liquid phase and a hole - poor phase with long - range columnar order .",
    "the nature of the transitions between these phases is incorrectly described by the mean - field theory , particularly at zero doping and near the tricritical point .",
    "the correct behavior is the subject of a detailed analysis in the subsequent sections .",
    "nevertheless , the mean - field phase diagram correctly predicts that at low hole densities and moderate values of @xmath41 the transition between the dimer - hole liquid and the columnar solid phase is continuous , that for large @xmath41 the transition is first order , and that there is a tricritical point at @xmath56 remarkably , the monte carlo simulations presented in section  [ sec : mc ] yield a tricritical point at a location quite consistent with these values .",
    "another correct prediction of the mean - field theory is the behavior of the connected hole density correlation function deep in the dimer - hole liquid phase .",
    "this prediction , also discussed in detail in appendix [ app : mean - field - details ] , fits surprisingly well the monte carlo simulations of krauth and moessner,@xcite performed for a system of classical non - interacting ( @xmath57 ) dimers at finite hole density .",
    "the mean - field result is consistent with the simulations for a quite broad region of densities even quite close to the fully packed limit @xmath58 where , naturally , a wrong correlation length exponent is predicted .",
    "we now turn to a more precise analysis of the phase transitions of the interacting classical dimer models as a function of hole density on interaction parameter @xmath41 . here",
    "we take advantage of a wealth of information and methods from two - dimensional systems , exact solutions and conformal field theory , to analyse the behavior in detail and extract conclusions that will be quite useful for the analysis of the wave functions .",
    "we begin with a discussion of the undoped case , and then discuss the physics at finite hole density .",
    "it is a well known fact that both classical and quantum two - dimensional dimer models can be represented in terms of height models . for the classical case ,",
    "this mapping is well known@xcite .",
    "the mapping for the quantum case has also been discussed extensively@xcite . in both cases",
    "the mapping relates each dimer configuration to a configuration of a set of integer - valued ( height ) variables , @xmath59 , which reside on the sites of the dual lattice , a square lattice in the case of interest here .",
    "thus , this mapping amounts to a duality transformation .",
    "an alternative picture follows from realizing that dimer configurations can be mapped onto the degenerate ground - state configurations of fully frustrated ising models@xcite . in our case , the corresponding spin model is the fully frustrated ising model on the square lattice ( ffsi ) at zero temperature . in the ising model picture ,",
    "each dimer is dual to an unsatisfied bond of the fully frustrated ising model and classical dimer interactions correspond to second neighbor interactions in the square lattice ffsi@xcite .",
    "it is easy to see that holes correspond to unfrustrated plaquettes in the ffsi . in this work",
    "we use primarily the language of the height representation .    to map the square - lattice classical dimer model onto a height model",
    ", we follow the prescription given in ref .  .",
    "one first assigns a height variable to each plaquette . in going around a vertex on the even sub - lattice clockwise , the height changes by @xmath60 if a dimer is present on the link between the plaquettes , and by @xmath61 if no dimer is present on that link . on the odd sub - lattice ,",
    "the heights change by @xmath62 and @xmath63 respectively . the dimer constraint ,",
    "that one lattice site belongs to one and only one dimer , implies ( for the square lattice ) that , for the fully packed case , there are four possible configurations of dimers for each lattice site . in the dual height model",
    "this is reproduced by the period four property @xmath64 of the allowed height configurations .",
    "it is easy to see that for the allowed configuration the average values that the height variables can take at a given site of the direct lattice ( a vertex ) are @xmath65 . on the other hand , a uniform shift _ of all _ the heights by one unit , @xmath66 , leads to an equivalent state",
    ". this mapping works strictly speaking only for the fully packed case .",
    "holes are sites that do nt belong to any dimer and thus represent violations of the full packing rule .",
    "they play the role of topological defects ( `` vortices '' ) in the ( dual ) height representation .",
    "the exact solution of the non - interacting fully packed dimer model on the square ( and other ) lattice has been known for a long time@xcite .",
    "in particular the long - distance behavior of the dimer density correlation functions and the hole density correlation functions are known explicitly@xcite .",
    "these correlation functions obey power law behaviors and show that this is a critical system . here",
    "we will use the standard approach to map the exact long distance behavior of two - dimensional critical systems to the behavior of the simplest critical system , the gaussian or free boson model@xcite .",
    "this approach is consistent for the free dimer model on an even lattice with periodic boundary conditions since its central charge ( or conformal anomaly ) is also @xmath67",
    ".    we will use as reference states ( `` ideal states '' in the terminology of kondev and henley@xcite ) the four columnar states of the dimer coverings , which have the largest number of flippable plaquettes , and use them to define an effective field theory for this problem@xcite .",
    "we will assign a uniform value to the coarse - grained height field @xmath68 to each reference ( columnar ) state .",
    "let @xmath69 and @xmath70 represent the coarse grained dimer densities of the horizontal link with endpoints at the pairs of lattice sites @xmath71 and @xmath72 , and vertical links with endpoints @xmath71 and @xmath73 respectively .",

    "we can now define the columnar local order parameter as the two component vector @xmath79 which clearly correspond to the @xmath80 and @xmath81 fourier components of the dimer densities .",
    "this two - component order parameter takes four distinct values for each one of the columnar states , and changes sign under shifts by one lattice spacing in either direction .",
    "it also transforms as a vector under @xmath82 rotations .",
    "thus it is the order parameter for columnar order .",

    "the relevance of @xmath280 indicates that holes on the same sublattice now have a strong effective attractive interaction , have a strong tendency to pairing and consequently phase separate .",

    "i.e. _ at fixed hole density @xmath288 , the coexistence curve opens up into a two - phase region : there is phase separation between hole - poor regions with local columnar dimer order and hole - rich regions .",
    "the jump in the hole and dimer densities ( as well as in the order parameters ) across the first - order transition is governed by the correlation length at the coexistence curve .",

    "we briefly summarize this algorithm here .",
    "the overlap of two hard - core dimer configurations generates a transition graph .",
    "this graph consists of disjoint subgraphs of dimers alternating between the two configurations . in the presence of holes , there are two possible types of graphs : an _ open graph _ which always terminates on a hole or a _ closed loop_. any monte carlo move corresponds to a transition graph of the initial and final configurations . in the geometric cluster algorithm , the two subgraphs are related by a global lattice symmetry .",
    "the algorithm obtains long transition graphs with minimal overhead : moves are never rejected , and each dimer encountered during the construction of the graph participates in the move .",
    "the construction proceeds as follows.@xcite first , a `` seed '' dimer and a symmetry axis are chosen at random .",
    "the seed dimer is reflected with respect to the symmetry axis , and if it overlaps with other dimers these are reflected as well .",
    "this proceeds in an iterative fashion until there are no more dimer overlaps or , equivalently , when an open or closed graph has been formed . on the square lattice ,",
    "the algorithm is ergodic if we allow both diagonal and horizontal - vertical axes passing through sites of the lattice .",
    "the first choice allows to change the numbers of horizontal and vertical dimers , whereas the second one permits to move through the different winding number sectors .",
    "transition graphs generated by the algorithm are symmetric with respect to the symmetry axis , and cross it at most twice .",
    "we now extend this approach to dimers with additional interactions by exploiting the _ generalized _ geometric cluster algorithm proposed by liu and luijten.@xcite now , in a single cluster move , multiple transition graphs and/or open graphs are formed simultaneously while retaining the rejection - free character of the algorithm .",
    "this is achieved by also reflecting dimers that do _ not _ overlap , with a probability that depends on the dimer - dimer coupling . when a dimer  @xmath16 , located at @xmath294 , is reflected to a new position @xmath295 ,",
    "there are two classes of dimers that interact with dimer  @xmath16 : a ) dimers which interact with it _ before _",

    "the results from the following section , which formally hold only for low density of dimers , lead to the conclusion that @xmath396 and @xmath397 is again a constant but has strong oscillatory behavior in real space .",
    "thus , from the correlation function we computed in and appendix [ app : mean - field - details ] , we conclude that these excitations are also quadratic in the momentum @xmath398 ,  @xmath399 .",
    "this result is consistent with the compressibility argument , given in ref .   which would also give quadratic dispersion in this case ( keeping in mind that in this case the compressibility is infinite when the system is doped ( constant number of holes ) ) .",
    "however , it is important to stress that the compressibility argument is a stronger condition because our calculation of the correlation function is legitimate for low dimer densities .      for the fixed hole density model the sma oscillator strength function @xmath375 for dimer density excitations",
    "is given by @xmath400    close to the wave vector @xmath401 with @xmath402 , both oscillator strengths @xmath403 and @xmath404 vanish quadratically ( cf .",
    "appendix b ) and more specifically , @xmath405 given the fact that the dimer density structure factor is a constant at @xmath406 and combining eqs . and , we may conclude that there are gapless dimer density excitations at @xmath406 .",
    "in addition to these results , we may have additional branches of dimer density excitations , specially when there is a divergence of the structure factor at some wave vector @xmath407 which would would be an indication of dimer order at a nearby phase .",
    "in particular , this happens at the phase boundary between the hole - dimer liquid phase and the columnar - ordered crystalline phase .",
    "as above , we can study the hole density excitations of the second model , the grand - canonical model , in which the hole density is not fixed , but is determined by a parameter @xmath47 which plays the role of a hole fugacity in the wave function . by the fact that there is no conservation of the number of holes",
    "is explicitly broken , we can predict that the numerator @xmath408 will vanish only at @xmath409 .",
    "this happens because of the bipartite lattice symmetry that enforces the number holes on each sublattice to be equal .",
    "for the fixed hole fugacity model the sma oscillator strength function @xmath375 for hole density excitations is @xmath410    the formula shows that the numerator @xmath411 vanishes only at the wave vector @xmath401 quadratically , as expected .",
    "the dimer density excitations are not gapless ( in the sense that the numerator does not vanish for any @xmath412 ) because the dimer - flip contribution vanishes at @xmath413 and the dimer - breaking term gives a constant contribution .",
    "this is expected due to the violation of the dimer number conservation .",
    "it is important to stress that the behavior of the structure factor is exactly the same as before ( in the fixed hole - density model ) .",
    "the reason is the equivalence of the canonical and grand - canonical ensemble in the thermodynamic limit for classical systems .",
    "it is certainly worth noting that , although the two ground - state wave functions of eqs .   and   have the same ground - state physics , due to the essential equivalence of the classical canonical and grand - canonical ensembles in the thermodynamic limit , the nature of their quantum elementary excitations is drastically different .",
    "in this work we have constructed generalizations of the quantum dimer model to include the effects of dimer correlations as well as finite hole doping in the wave function . throughout",
    "we considered the case of bosonic ( charged ) holes and neglected the fermionic spinons .",
    "we have constructed generalized rk hamiltonians whose ground - state wave functions describe the effects of ( attractive ) dimer correlations and finite hole doping .",
    "we have discussed the rich phase diagram and critical behavior of three doped interacting quantum dimer models at their rk point using both analytic methods and numerical simulations .",
    "we have shown that the ground - state wave function embodies a complex phase diagram which consists of dimer - hole liquid and columnar phases separated by a critical line with varying exponents , ending at a multicritical point with a kosterlitz - thouless structure where the transition becomes first order .",
    "the critical behavior along the low doping section of the phase boundary was investigated in detail and the predictions of our scaling analysis were confirmed with large - scale monte carlo simulations .",
    "monte carlo simulations were also used to show that the transition between the dimer - hole liquid and the columnar solid does indeed become first order , and to estimate the location of the multicritical point and of the first - order phase boundary .    in the high - doping regime , near the first - order transition line , additional repulsive interactions among holes were shown to generate , at the expense of the two - phase region , an even richer phase diagram with phases in which the dimer - hole system becomes inhomogeneous . in the regime of strong dimer coupling , @xmath414 , and weak hole interactions , @xmath358 , we found a stripe phase with wave vectors @xmath415 and @xmath416 .",
    "in general , we expect the two - phase region to be replaced by a complex phase diagram with a large number of commensurate and incommensurate phases . this physics is well known in the context of two - dimensional classical statistical mechanics of systems with competing interactions.@xcite however , it is interesting to see how it arises at the level of the exact ground - state wave function of models of strongly correlated systems , particularly given the current interest on this type of phenomena in high - temperature superconductors and related systems.@xcite    in this paper we have also presented an analysis of the low - lying excitations of the quantum system and found that , much as in the case of the rokhsar - kivelson quantum dimer model , the doped system is a bose - einstein condensate but not a superfluid , since the superfluid stiffness vanishes even though both dimers and holes interact .",
    "it is apparent that in order to render the bose - einstein condensate a true superfluid it is necessary to violate the rk condition which forces the wave function to have a local structure .",
    "the effects of violations to the rk condition are poorly understood , and we have not investigated this important problem which is essential to determine the generic phase diagram of these models .",

    "in this appendix we give details of the mean - field theory summarized in section [ sec : mean - field ] .",
    "we will use grassmann variable methods to write down the partition functions for classical interacting and doped dimers .",
    "we will use these methods to derive a simple mean - field theory for this system . while mean - field theory , as it is well known , fails to give the correct critical behavior in two - dimensional systems , it offers a good qualitative description of the phases and , surprisingly , even of the gross features of the phase diagram . in subsequent sections",
    "we will use more sophisticated analytic and numerical methods to study the phase transitions .",
    "the classical dimer - hole partition function can be formulated in terms of a grassmann functional integral , according to the prescription of ref .  .",
    "the classical partition function of the dimer problem on any lattice which is defined by the connectivity matrix @xmath417 and with fugacity @xmath47 for the dimers and 1 for the holes is : @xmath418    for the square lattice , @xmath419 is 1 if @xmath420 are nearest neighbor sites and zero otherwise . for the triangular lattice , @xmath419 is 1 if @xmath420 are nearest neighbors and also next - nearest neighbor sites , but only along one diagonal , if @xmath421 or @xmath422 .",
    "also , the fugacity z ranges from 0 to @xmath423 . when @xmath424 , the system is filled with holes and there are very few dimers and when @xmath425 the system approaches the close - packed limit with dimers .",
    "both limits are worth of study due to the existence of an important theorem by heilmann and lieb@xcite which proves under rather general assumptions the absence of any phase transitions with doping in this model .",
    "thus , the identification of the phase in the _ few dimers _ limit is enough to conclude about the phase that the system enters when doped . in this section",
    "we will study this problem in the limit in which the dimers are dilute . in this regime a simple mean - field theory of the hartree type is expected to be accurate.@xcite such a crude approximation should break near criticality , _",
    "i.e. _ near the close packing limit .    to proceed , we apply a hubbard - stratonovich transformation to the above partition function : @xmath426 where @xmath427 is an irrelevant normalization constant",
    ". we may also add sources for the hole density operators @xmath428 . in this way",
    ", the classical dimer partition function may be written as follows : @xmath429 where he have dropped the normalization constant @xmath427 , as we will do in what follows .",
    "( note that what makes the above problem _ unsolvable _ is the term ` 1 ' in the exponent ! )    upon integrating out the grassmann variables we find : @xmath430 in the limit @xmath46 we may formulate a legitimate and well - defined mean - field theory .",
    "to this end we rewrite the partition function in the following way : @xmath431}\\nonumber\\\\ & = & \\int \\mathcal{d}\\phi \\ ; e^{-\\frac{1}{z}\\mathcal{s}(\\phi)}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath432 is the effective action . as @xmath46",
    ", we have a theory which has a well - defined saddle point and the perturbation around this point will be in powers of @xmath47 which plays the role of an effective coupling constant . in this way",
    ", we have a very fast convergent expansion .",
    "the saddle - point is defined as follows : @xmath433 and we take the following equation for @xmath434 : @xmath435 in this approximation , the density of holes is given by : @xmath436 so , the source @xmath437 in terms of the density of the holes @xmath438 , is given by : @xmath439 the legendre transform of the effective action @xmath440 is : @xmath441 we specialize now to the case of uniform hole density @xmath442 and also for the case of the square lattice where the number of nearest neighbors is @xmath443 and assuming that the number of sites on the lattice is @xmath13 .",
    "then , @xmath444 at this level of approximation ( `` hartree '' ) the equation of state becomes @xmath445 so , when the sources are set to zero , the density in terms of the fugacity , in the limit @xmath446 , is : @xmath447 as a check of the approximation , we may expand the result in the region of @xmath446 , where the result should be @xmath448 for the hole density : @xmath449 or , equivalently , for @xmath450 , @xmath451 the hole density - density correlation function can be obtained in the following way by using the legendre transform : @xmath452 and also , @xmath453^{-1 } \\label{invg}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] by using and , we have : @xmath454^{-1}=\\frac{\\partial^2    \\gamma}{\\partial\\rho_i\\partial \\rho_j } = - zm_{ij }    -\\delta_{ij}\\frac{1}{\\rho_{i}^2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] since @xmath419 is a function of the distance between sites and vanishes except for nearest neighbors , its fourier transform is : @xmath455 also , we set @xmath456 and finally the hole density connected correlation function is : @xmath457 for momenta near @xmath458 , @xmath459 , with @xmath460 small , it becomes @xmath461 where @xmath253 is the correlation length @xmath462 finally , the connected hole density correlation function ( the structure factor ) in real space for @xmath463 is : @xmath464 if we restore the units , the correlation length is @xmath465 .    surprisingly , given",
    "how crude this approximation is , the result of eq .",
    "is consistent with the numerical results provided by krauth and moessner@xcite for much of the dimer density range they studied .",
    "significant deviations are seen only upon approach of the close packing regime where the classical dimer model is critical and this mean - field calculation fails , _",
    "e.g. _ the correlation length diverges as @xmath466 with exponent @xmath14 , given by eq .  , ( the mean - field value ) .",
    "the correct value of the exponent can be deduced from table [ table:0density ] and it is @xmath467 ( @xmath223 being the scaling dimension of the hole operator for the non - interacting case . ) as we show in section [ sec : zero - density ] ( and in table [ table:0density ] ) , the dimension of the hole operator grows from the value @xmath223 for free dimers to a value of @xmath178 at the ( kosterlitz - thouless ) transition to the columnar state , where it should exhibit an essential singularity due to the marginality of the hole operator .",
    "clearly , the mean - field method for the non - interacting dimer - hole system can be easily extended to dimer - hole systems with local interactions . in the case of attractive interactions between parallel dimers ,",
    "the partition function of the monomer - dimer system should be @xmath468 where @xmath469 for an attractive interaction of strength @xmath34 between parallel neighboring dimers .",

    "if we consider just a single plaquette , then the contribution from four holes on this plaquette to the gibbs weight of the partition function will be just unity but the contribution of two parallel dimers arranged either vertically or horizontally will be @xmath498 . when @xmath499 , the holes become unstable to the formation of pairs of parallel nearest neighboring dimers and the result is a columnar dimer crystal .    when @xmath500 ( whereas @xmath501 remains positive ) , there is a mean - field tricritical point where the transition ultimately becomes continuous . using the approximate eqs . -",
    ", we can have an estimate for the tricritical point .",
    "solving the set of equations we arrive to the following estimate : @xmath502    remarkably enough , these estimates are very close to the estimates from the grand - canonical simulations that are presented in section [ sec : mc ] .",
    "however , we should be very cautious on taking these estimates too seriously since the terms in the expansion of the coefficients @xmath503 in powers of @xmath47 , generically have alternating signs with increasingly large constant coefficients which suggests that this expansion is not convergent .",
    "in any case , mean - field approximations , such as the one presented here , fail in two dimensions .",
    "the actual multicritical point has a more complex analytic structure , akin to a kosterlitz - thouless transition , than suggested by these landau - ginzburg type arguments .",
    "on the other hand , the multicritical point can be approached from the high dimer density limit , where the transition is continuous and thus , an effective field theory description is possible . as we show in the following sections [ sec : zero - density],[sec : finite - density ] , this multicritical point",
    "is controlled by a marginally relevant operator and belongs to the kosterlitz - thouless universality class .",
    "in this appendix we present the details of the calculations of the sma oscillator strength functions @xmath375 discussed in section [ sec : sma ] .",
