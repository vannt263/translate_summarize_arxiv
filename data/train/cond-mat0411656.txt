    "the statistical mechanics of even well - understood physical systems subjected to quenched disorder still poses major challenges . for a large class of these systems , as e.g.random-field models or elastic manifolds in quenched disorder , an apparent simplification appears : supposing that all moments of the disorder are finite , one can show that all correlation functions in the disordered model , in the limit of zero temperature , are equivalent to those of the pure system at finite temperature in two space - dimensions less , at a temperature proportional to the second moment of the quenched disorder .",
    "this phenomenon is called dimensional reduction ( dr ) @xcite . the most elegant way to prove",
    "it is to use the supersymmetry approach @xcite , as we will detail below .",
    "however , one also knows that dimensional reduction gives the wrong result at large scales , more precisely at scales larger than the larkin length .",
    "the latter is obtained from an imry - ma type argument due to larkin , balancing elastic energy and disorder , as we detail below . for a @xmath2-dimensional elastic manifold in quenched disorder ,",
    "the elastic and disorder energy are @xmath3=\\int \\rmd^{d } x\\ , { \\frac12}(\\nabla u(x))^{2 } \\ , \\qquad e_{{\\mathrm{do}}}[u]=\\int \\rmd^{d } x\\ , v(x , u(x))\\ .\\",

    "this will play no role in the following .",
    "the most important observable is the roughness exponent @xmath9 , which describes the scaling of the 2-point function @xmath10^{2 } } \\sim |x - x'|^{2\\zeta}\\ .\\ ] ] the larkin argument compares , as a function of system size @xmath11 , elastic energy @xmath12 and disorder energy @xmath13 to conclude that in dimensions smaller than four , disorder always wins at large scales , leading to an rg - flow to strong coupling ( in a way to be made more precise below ) .",
    "this suggests that the dimensional reduction result , derived below via the supersymmetry method , @xmath14 will become incorrect below four dimensions .",
    "in this section we review some important points of the functional rg treatment , which will facilitate the derivation of the corresponding formulas in the supersymmetric treatment .",
    "functional rg was first introduced in @xcite , and pioneered for the problem at hand in @xcite , to cite the earliest contributions .",
    "important improvements @xcite have been obtained by several authors , see @xcite for a more detailed introduction and review .",
    "the larkin argument suggests that four is the upper critical dimension and that an @xmath15-expansion @xcite with @xmath16 about dimension four is possible .",
    "taking the dimensional reduction result ( [ dr ] ) in @xmath17 dimensions tells us that the field @xmath18 is dimensionless .",
    "thus , the width @xmath19 of the disorder is not the only relevant coupling at small @xmath15 , but any function of @xmath18 has the same scaling dimension in the limit of @xmath20 , and might thus equivalently contribute .",
    "the natural consequence is that one has to follow the full function @xmath8 under renormalization , instead of just its second moment @xmath21 .",
    "such an rg - treatment is most easily implemented in the replica approach : the @xmath22 times replicated partition function becomes after averaging over disorder @xmath23 - \\frac{1}t \\sum_{a=1}^{n } { e_{\\mathrm{do } } [ u_{a } ] } \\right ) } \\nonumber\\\\ & & \\qquad = \\exp \\left(-\\frac1 t \\sum_{a=1}^{n } { e_{\\mathrm{el}}[u_{a } ] } + \\frac1{2t^{2 } } \\sum_{a , b=1}^{n } \\int \\rmd^d x\\ , r\\big(u_{a}(x)-u_{b}(x)\\big ) \\right ) \\ .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] perturbation theory is constructed along the following lines ( see @xcite for more details . ) the bare correlation function , graphically depicted as a solid line , is with momentum @xmath24 flowing through and replicas @xmath25 and @xmath26 @xmath27{./figures / prop}{\\hspace*{0.8ex}}}\\parbox{\\bilderlength}{{\\hspace*{0.8ex}}\\includegraphics[scale={0.35}]{./figures / prop}{\\hspace*{0.8ex}}}}_{b}\\ = \\frac { t\\delta_{ab } } { k^{2}}\\ .\\ ] ] the disorder vertex is @xmath28{./figures / rab}{\\hspace*{0.8ex}}}\\parbox{\\bilderlength}{{\\hspace*{0.8ex}}\\includegraphics[scale={0.35}]{./figures / rab}{\\hspace*{0.8ex}}}}_{b}^{a}}\\ = \\int_{x}\\sum_{a , b } r\\big(u_{a}(x)-u_{b}(x)\\big)\\ .\\ ] ] the rules of the game are to find all contributions which correct @xmath29 , and which survive in the limit of @xmath30 . at leading order , i.e.  order @xmath31 , counting of factors of @xmath32 shows that only the terms with one or two correlators contribute . on the other hand",

    "the crucial observation is that when starting with smooth microscopic disorder , integration of the rg - equation leads to a cusp in the second derivative of the renormalized disorder at the larkin - length , as depicted on figure [ fig : cusp ] .",
    "this can easily be seen from the flow - equation of the fourth derivative ( supposing analyticity ) , which from ( [ rg1loop ] ) is obtained as @xmath46 ( note that this explains also the appearance of the combination @xmath47 in ( [ rg1loop ] ) ) .",
    "this equation has a singularity @xmath48 after a finite renormalization time , equivalent to the appearance of the cusp , as depicted on figure [ fig : cusp ] .",

    "this analysis can be continued to higher orders .",
    "let us cite some key results at 2-loop order@xcite , for which the rg - equation reads @xmath56 different microscopic disorder leads to different rg fixed points .",
    "the latter are solutions of equation ( [ 2looprg ] ) , with @xmath57 ; it is important to note that given a microscopic disorder , the exponent @xmath9 , solution of ( [ 2looprg ] ) is unique . for random - bond disorder ( short - ranged potential - potential correlation function )",
    "the result is @xmath58 . in the case of random field disorder ( short - ranged force - force correlations ) @xmath59 .",
    "both results compare well with numerical simulations .",
    "one should also note that ( [ 2looprg ] ) contains a rather peculiar `` anomalous term '' , namely @xmath60 , which only appears after the occurrence of the cusp .",
    "this term is in general hard to get , since the calculation naturally gives factors of @xmath61 , which are 0 by parity , and not @xmath62 .",
    "several procedures to overcome these apparent ambiguities have been developed @xcite .",
    "supersymmetry will allow for another prescription , as will be discussed below .",
    "another way to average over disorder is to use additional fermionic degrees of freedom .",
    "it is more commonly referred to as the supersymmetric method .",
    "supersymmetry is manifest using one copy of the system , where it immediately leads to dimensional reduction , as we show below",
    ". however it can not account for the non - trivial physics due to the appearance of the cusp and the corresponding breakdown of dimensional reduction , and supersymmetry .",

    "what is important is that rsb appears exactly at the same moment as in the functional rg the cusp appears @xcite .",
    "moreover , there is a precise relation between the 2-point function calculated by the rsb and frg methods @xcite .",
    "the latter do not coincide , since the calculations are implicitly done in zero external field ( rsb ) and vanishing external field ( frg ) , leading to physically different situations ( as for a standard ferro - magnet ) .    in section [ a : susy ] we have shown , that this is also the moment , when supersymmetry is broken . while the treatment there was for a 1-component field , the conclusion is the same for an @xmath114-component field , and persists in the limit of @xmath128 .",
    "we can thus conclude that the breaking of supersymmetry , of replica symmetry , and the appearance of the cusp are all but different manifestations of the same underlying physical principle : the appearance of multiple minima .",
