    "the underlying particle distributions of blazars are usually studied by matching broadband observations with predictions from radiative models . since these sources are highly variable , simultaneous observations are essential .",
    "the most energetic bl lac spectra extend up to tev energies , and positive detections have usually indicated flaring states .",
    "however , with their improved sensitivity , the new generation of atmospheric cherenkov telescopes ( acts ) , which has more than quadrupled the number of known extragalactic vhe sources , finds a few of these sources in marginally variable states with consistent detections after short exposures .",
    "one of these objects , the blazar at @xmath5 , is an ideal target for such studies .",
    "crucial information is expected from the _ fermi _ gamma - ray space telescope , since its improved sensitivity over egret would constrain dramatically the existing models that predict a wide variety of fluxes in the @xmath6@xmath7 energy range . since the h.e.s.s .",

    "the spectral index is similar to that previously measured by h.e.s.s .",
    "when the source was at a comparable flux level , in 2003 @xcite and between 2003 and 2005 @xcite .",
    "the vhe spectrum is affected by interactions with the extragalactic background light ( ebl ) which modifies the intrinsic shape and intensity .",

    "the positive excess variance @xmath66 , indicating variability , allows a fractional root mean square ( rms ) of @xmath67 ( see @xcite for definitions of @xmath66 and @xmath68 ) to be derived , which is 3 times less than the high state flaring variability reported by @xcite .",
    "a spectrum was obtained for each night when possible , otherwise two or three nights were combined .",
    "no indication of spectral variability was found during those observations , with a limit on the nightly index variations of @xmath69 .",

    "the normalized excess variance of @xmath73 sets a 90% confidence level limit of @xmath74 on the fractional variance @xcite .",
    "the x - ray light curve , derived from spectral fits of the nightly _ rxte _ ( and _ swift _ ) data sets , shows flux doubling episodes on time scales of days , similar to the optical and vhe measurements .",
    "the lowest fluxes of @xmath75@xmath76erg@xmath77s@xmath78 are at the same level as those seen in the low state @xcite but with larger fluctuations , @xmath79 .",

    "[ lightcurve ] show clearly that the x - ray spectrum hardens significantly , @xmath80 , as the 210kev flux increases .",
    "the atom fluxes are @xmath81 times higher than the low state found in @xcite , but the @xmath82-band magnitudes reported here are in the range @xmath83@xmath84 which is well on the lower side of the measurements of reported by @xcite when the source was quoted to be in a low state with @xmath82-band magnitudes in the range @xmath85@xmath83 . the host galaxy flux is estimated to be @xmath86 @xcite , hence most of the optical flux can be attributed to the central agn .",
    "the average fractional rms over all bands is @xmath87 .",
    "the @xmath88 lightcurve is compatible with a constant , @xmath89 , indicating little or no optical spectral variability .",
    "the two - component broad band spectra of high energy - peaked bl lac objects ( hbls ) are typically modeled with synchrotron self - compton ( ssc ) scenarios ( e.g. , @xcite ) . despite the simplicity of these models , they have been successful in reproducing many blazar seds and make definite predictions for the flux and spectral variability that should be seen in the two components .",
    "in particular , for typical parameters , the electrons responsible for the x - ray emission also produce the vhe emission ; and if the underlying particle distributions were to vary , the resulting flux and spectral changes in the vhe band should be related to variations in the x - rays .",
    "in fact , for the july 2006 flare , a non - linear relationship was seen between the x - ray and vhe bands , though the observed variability patterns do not quite fit the simple ssc model in detail @xcite .    in fig .",
    "[ sed ] , we overlay a model ssc calculation that roughly fits the time - averaged sed .",
    "the electron distribution model parameters , a three - component power - law with indices @xmath90 , @xmath91 , @xmath92 ( @xmath93 ) , minimal and maximal lorentz factors @xmath94 and @xmath95 , break electron lorentz factors @xmath96 , @xmath97 , and total electron number @xmath98 , have been set to reproduce the shape of the lower energy component of the sed .",
    "the overall sed is then adjusted with the remaining parameters : radius of the emitting region in the comoving frame , @xmath99 cm ; bulk doppler factor , @xmath100 ; magnetic field , @xmath101 g .",
    "even though we regard this fit as a `` straw - man '' model , it is perhaps reassuring that the joint _ fermi_-h.e.s.s .",
    "time - averaged spectra can be reasonably well - described as ssc emission .",
    "@xcite found similar values for @xmath102 , @xmath103 and @xmath104 in their ssc description of a steady large jet component in the sed of pks  2155@xmath31304 .",
    "some features of this model calculation are particularly noteworthy .",
    "the electrons that produce the synchrotron x - ray emission have lorentz factors @xmath105 . when the power - law component for those electrons is omitted from the calculation , the dot - dashed curve in fig .  [ sed ]",
    "results . for this particular set of parameters , the electrons that produce",
    "the x - rays have higher energies than the electrons that produce the vhe emission .",
    "furthermore , the lack of a significant impact on the shape of the ssc component when those electrons are removed indicates that klein - nishina effects suppress any significant contribution by those electrons to the emission at @xmath106tev energies .",
    "these features of this calculation allow that there need not be a correlation between the x - ray and vhe fluxes ; and in fact , this is what is observed .",
    "in contrast with the july 2006 flare , we do not find any evidence of flux correlation between the x - ray and h.e.s.s",
    ". bands with a pearson s @xmath107 of @xmath108 between these bands .",
    "furthermore , the 210 kev x - ray spectra show spectral variability consistent with an underlying electron distribution for which the cooling time scales are of order the flux variability time scales , i.e. , the spectra are softer when the flux is lower , with changes in photon index of @xmath80 ( fig .  [ lightcurve ] ) ; whereas the vhe emission shows no evidence for significant spectral variability despite flux variations of a factor of @xmath60 .",
    "since radiative cooling time scales vary inversely with electron energy , this supports the conclusion that the electrons responsible for the synchrotron emission in the x - ray band have higher energies than the electrons that produce the inverse - compton emission in the vhe range , assuming they are part of the same overall non - thermal distribution .    even though this all fits in with our straw - man sed calculation , the variability patterns in the optical , x - ray , he and vhe bands suggest a much more complex situation . in the absence of spectral variability ,",
    "the mechanisms that would produce the observed flux variability in the vhe band are rather constrained .",
    "increases in flux could be driven by injection of particles with a constant spectral shape , and decreases in flux could be caused by particle escape from the emitting region or by expansion ( `` adiabatic '' ) losses , assuming those latter two processes can operate independent of particle energy .    however , since the electrons that produce the vhe emission must be in the weak radiative cooling regime , a more natural mechanism for the flux variability would be that changes in the seed photon density are driving the variability . comparing the daily flux values in the optical and the vhe bands , we find indications of fairly strong correlations that suggest that the optical emission provides the target photons for the ic emission . in the @xmath103 , @xmath82 , and @xmath102 bands , the correlations with the h.e.s.s .",
    "fluxes have pearson s @xmath107 values in the range 0.770.86 with uncertainties @xmath109 .",
    "this correlated behavior is readily apparent in the light curves shown in fig .",
    "[ lightcurve ] , and these results provide the first quantitative evidence of correlated variability between the optical and vhe bands on these time scales for an hbl .",
    "confirmation of this behavior , not only from this source but also from other vhe emitting blazars in a low state , would provide important constraints on emission models for these objects .    in the context of a single - zone ssc model",
    ", we would expect that any flux variability in the optical bands should also appear as variability in the _",
    "fermi_-lat energy range . to illustrate this , we plot , as the dashed curve in fig .",
    "[ sed ] the sed that results if we omit contributions from electrons with energies @xmath110 .",
    "for the original model parameters , the electrons that produce the optical - soft x - ray emission also produce the bulk of the ic component , including the he and vhe emission .",
    "since we do not find any indication of a correlation between the optical and he fluxes , this suggests that the optical emission may arise from a separate population of electrons than those responsible for the he and vhe emission .",
    "if so , then these electrons probably also occupy a distinct physical region with different physical parameters ( magnetic field , size scale , bulk lorentz factor ) .",
    "multizone ssc models of this kind have already been proposed to account for the `` orphan '' @xmath2-ray flare in 1es  1959 + 650 during may 2002 @xcite .    although the @xmath47@xmath70gev photon fluxes measured by _ fermi _",
    "are consistent with being constant , we find more significant variations of the photon spectral index in the daily analyses ( @xmath111 ) .",
    "the fitted values range from fairly soft , @xmath112 , to extremely hard , @xmath113 .",
    "these values , along with the constant , intrinsic vhe index of @xmath114 derived from the h.e.s.s .",
    "data , imply spectral breaks between the he and vhe bands of @xmath115 as large as 1.4 .",
    "very sharp spectral breaks ( @xmath116 ) would require rather narrow electron distributions and would therefore pose difficulties in fitting a broad lower energy component in the context of a single - zone model .",
    "interestingly , we find a significant anticorrelation between the nightly x - ray fluxes and the _ fermi_-lat spectral indices of @xmath117 .",
    "a fit to a linear model is preferred over a constant at the @xmath118 level , with a slope of @xmath119 .",
    "if the electrons that produce the x - rays are at higher energies than those that produce the tev emission , the cause for such a correlation would be difficult to understand .",
    "an important caveat in considering these results is that the _ fermi _ coverage for pks 2155@xmath31304 was relatively uniform over each 24 hour period , whereas the optical , x - ray , and vhe observations were restricted to 46 hour intervals each night .",
    "hence , the _ fermi _ observations are not strictly simultaneous with the other measurements , so it is possible that some of the observed he spectral variability occurred outside of the nightly observing windows .    as the first multiwavelength campaign of an hbl that includes _ fermi _ and an act instrument ,",
    "these observations have yielded results that strongly challenge the standard models for these sources . having caught pks 2155@xmath31304 in a low state , we see that its spectral and variability properties are significantly different than its flaring , high state behavior . the variability patterns , in particular , defy easy explanation by the usual ssc models and should provide valuable constraints for models that attempt to describe the emission mechanisms in blazar jets .",
