    "it is one of the outstanding problems to construct a systematic computational framework to study nonperturbative aspects of quantum fields .",
    "lattice field theories initiated by wilson @xcite allow us to use the strong coupling expansion which is mathematically equivalent with the high temperature expansion in condensed matter physics .",
    "however , the results do not necessarily provide us , at least in the quantitative sense , the corresponding results in continuum space - time since the strong coupling expansion on the lattice usually breaks down at small lattice spacings .",
    "nevertheless the fact that the strong coupling expansion on the lattice clarified various nonperturbative properties of quantum fields such as the quark confinement serves us enough motivation to investigate the possibilities of improving it as to be effective on the approximation of physics in the continuum limit .    as an attempt toward the improvement of the strong coupling expansion on the lattice",
    ", we propose a new computational scheme which may be considered as an alternative to the ordinary delta expansion @xcite@xcite .",
    "we introduce @xmath4 as the parameter to dilate the scaling region of a given lattice model with the replacement of the lattice spacing @xmath5 to @xmath6 . as long as @xmath4",
    "can be tuned to some values close to unity , the lattice spacing @xmath5 may be kept large enough in calculating physical quantities near the continuum limit .",
    "further we perform the expansion in @xmath4 to finite orders and setting @xmath8 in the end of the calculation .",
    "thus , our approach has some similarities with the ordinary delta expansion , and we use the term `` delta expansion '' to refer our method .",
    "we emphasize that our delta expansion on the lattice needs no extra parameter and the principle of minimum sensitivity @xcite , both of which play , in the ordinary delta expansion , important but somewhat artificial roles to produce non - trivial results .    to investigate and explore the above idea ,",
    "we apply our method to the @xmath0 non - linear @xmath1 model on the lattice , which model is also called @xmath7-vector model . in the present paper ,",
    "we focus on two extreme cases , @xmath2 and @xmath3 which case corresponds to the ising model .",
    "the model can be exactly solved in the large @xmath7 limit , so we can examine to what extent our proposal is effective both in the qualitative and quantitative sense .",
    "the @xmath3 case is also of interest , since the ising model at @xmath0 serves us a good testing ground of analyzing phase transition at non - zero temperature .",
    "to illustrate our strategy , we first study two simple examples .      consider the problem of approximating the value of @xmath9 where @xmath10 is given as a finite series in @xmath11 ; @xmath12    we introduce @xmath4 by the replacement of @xmath13 to @xmath14 ( @xmath15 ) in @xmath10 , resulting a new function of two variables @xmath4 and @xmath13 , @xmath16 .",
    "note that we can make the region around @xmath17 of @xmath10 wider by setting the value of @xmath4 as close to @xmath18 . then",
    ", if we can construct a truncated series of @xmath16 in @xmath11 and @xmath4 and it is effective at @xmath19 , the series would provide us the information on @xmath9 as long as @xmath20 . here",
    ", we stress that for the plan to work the factor @xmath21 must be expanded in @xmath4 . as a systematic expansion of @xmath16 effective at large @xmath13 and small @xmath4 , we employ the ordinary expansion in both variables around @xmath22 .",
    "then @xmath23 order approximant of @xmath16 , denoted as @xmath24 , is written formally by @xmath25 where @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "for example , when @xmath28 , we have @xmath29 in general , it is efficient to obtain the above expansion in the following manner : consider @xmath30 first shift @xmath13 to @xmath14 and expand @xmath31 in @xmath4 to the relevant order .",
    "for example the term @xmath32 should be expanded to the order @xmath33 , giving @xmath34 . setting @xmath8 which means the infinite dilation",
    ", we then have @xmath35 . \\label{1}\\ ] ] from now on we use the symbol @xmath36 as the operation of delta expansion to the relevant order with setting @xmath8 understood . to the order @xmath37",
    "we therefore obtain @xmath38 = \\sum_{r=1}^{n}(-1)^{r-1}\\bigg ( \\begin{array}{c } n \\\\ r \\end{array } \\bigg)\\frac{1}{x^r}\\\\ & = & 1-\\big(1-\\frac{1}{x}\\big)^{n}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] it is easy to see that @xmath39 for @xmath40 .",
    "thus , when @xmath40 , @xmath41 fig .",
    "1 shows the function @xmath42 at @xmath43 . at those orders",
    ", there exists a plateu and the region of the plateu grows wider as the order increases .",
    "the value at a flat point which is a typical value on the plateu agrees with the value , @xmath44 .",
    "thus the result is quite satisfactory .     at @xmath43 .",
    "the dotted line represents the value @xmath44 . ]",
    "next example deals with the relation of observables appearing in the @xmath45 ising model . in the model , the inverse temperature @xmath46",
    "is related to @xmath47 , the square of the screening mass ( in lattice units ) in the momentum representation , by @xmath48 at very low temperature the mass @xmath47 is very small and we have the logarithmic relation @xmath49 while at high temperature , @xmath50 and @xmath51 though the previous example has the limit , @xmath52 , in the present example , @xmath46 diverges logarithmically in the @xmath53 limit .",
    "we show , however , that the delta expansion on the `` high temperature expansion '' ( [ 3 ] ) recovers numerically the asymptotic behavior of @xmath46 near @xmath54 represented by ( [ 2 ] ) .     from @xmath55 to @xmath56 orders .",

    "this reflects the logarithmic divergence of @xmath60 in the @xmath53 limit .",
    "the corrections by terms of positive integer powers experience drastic change : when the delta expansion is performed to a large order , lower order terms vanish when the value of @xmath4 is tuned to @xmath18 .",
    "for example , we find that @xmath69 , @xmath70 and @xmath71 , and these terms vanish themselves at orders large enough . at small @xmath47",
    ", however , the delta expansion has a subtlety on the definition of the full order that is in accordance with the definition at large @xmath47 . though we do not know a convincing definition ,",
    "let us proceed by supposing that we should confine ourselves with only the leading term at small @xmath47 and it should be expanded in @xmath4 to the same order with the full order at large @xmath47 .",
    "thus , at @xmath23 order of delta expansion , @xmath72 behaves at small @xmath47 as @xmath73    as is obvious from the plot of @xmath72 ( see fig.3 ) , the logarithmic behavior ( [ 3a ] ) is recovered by the @xmath4- expanded @xmath74 series already at @xmath28 .",
    "note that the scaling region develops to larger @xmath47 as the order of expansion grows . in the scaling region to be seen in fig.3 , small @xmath47 behavior of @xmath60 represented by ( [ 2 ] ) is well approximated by subtracting @xmath75 from @xmath76 .",
    "thus , even the limit of sequence @xmath77 does not exist for any @xmath47 as @xmath66 , we can reproduce the scaling behavior both in the qualitative and quantitative respects .    -expanded @xmath74 series of @xmath78 at @xmath55 and @xmath56 orders .",

    "the constraint is same as that in the continuum case , @xmath91 , and the first term in ( [ 4 ] ) is actually a constant that can be omitted .",
