    "the standard model of big bang nucleosynthesis ( sbbn)(@xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) makes well defined predictions of the primordial abundances of the light elements .",
    "these predictions agree reasonably well with the commonly accepted values of the primordial element abundances as inferred from observation ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) at a baryon - to - photon ratio of about @xmath1 .",
    "however , this baryon density corresponds to only a few percent of the closure density of the universe .",
    "this result has motivated a number of attempts to reconcile the observed big bang abundances with a model in which @xmath2 is much larger .    in this context ,",
    "it was suggested by @xcite(go ) that a population of black holes may have formed from an early generation of massive stars .",
    "the collapse of the stars to black holes does not significantly contaminate the primordial abundances .",
    "the black holes then accrete matter and produce a photon bath which further processes the remaining primordial material .",
    "go chose initial sbbn abundances at two values of the baryon - to - photon ratio which are higher than that which agrees with any of the abundance determinations .",
    "thus , they start with an excess of @xmath3he and @xmath4li and a deficit of d and @xmath0he .",
    "the @xmath3he and @xmath4li are then processed into the lighter elements as a function of the total photon energy input into the system .",
    "although go are not able to process any significant amounts of @xmath3he , they claim to be in agreement with the observed primordial abundances at the 3@xmath5 level .",
    "( see also a more recent paper ( @xcite ) ) .    in this paper",
    "we investigate in detail general models of nucleosynthesis induced by post - big - bang photoprocessing and determine the conditions under which the observed light element abundances can be reproduced .",
    "as we will show , we are unable to find a non - trivial solution where the initial abundances do not already agree with observation .",
    "the reason for this is straightforward .",
    "the sbbn abundance of @xmath3he is larger , by some 4 or more orders of magnitude , that those of d and/ or @xmath0he ( especially at high values of @xmath2 ) .",
    "it is therefore not possible to destroy enough @xmath3he to achieve consistency with observations without , at the same time , grossly overproducing pregalactic d and/or @xmath0he .",
    "further , at high @xmath2 , @xmath4li is significantly overproduced and it is difficult to destroy enough @xmath4li without destroying too much @xmath3he ( and , consequently , overproducing d and @xmath0he ) .",
    "our detailed calculations will provide support for this simple overview .",
    "in the present scenario , the primordial elements are assumed to be bathed in a photon field for a given exposure time and photon intensity . in order to calculate the nucleosynthesis ,",
    "it is necessary to know the energy spectrum of the radiation emitted by the black holes . since such spectra",
    "are not observed directly , we look to other accreting objects , such as quasars , which may have similar spectra .",
    "measurements have been made of ngc 4151 ( @xcite ; @xcite ) and other quasars ( @xcite ) in energy ranges from 2 kev ( @xcite ) up to 100 mev ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the photon number spectrum can be parameterized by two power laws , one describing the data below 23 mev and with the form @xmath6 ( @xcite ) , the other describing the data above 23 mev with the form @xmath7 ( @xcite ) .",
    "we are only concerned with energies above 2.2 mev , the binding energy of the deuteron , and thus only use the higher energy power - law .",
    "it should be noted that @xcite give a more complicated expression for the @xmath8-ray spectrum in order to describe the full energy range .",
    "as we shall see , the choice of @xmath8-ray spectrum does not change our conclusions .",
    "cross sections for ( @xmath8 , x ) reactions , where x = n , p , d , t , @xmath0he , or @xmath9 have been measured over most of the energy range of interest . in order to describe the photoerosion process",
    ", we first calculate the energy - weighted cross sections ( @xcite ) @xmath10 because of the power - law weighting factor , the energy - weighted cross section is dominated by contributions from the excitation function near threshold .",
    "sparse data exist for photodissociation reactions on the lithium isotopes near threshold , contributing up to a 50% systematic uncertainty in the energy - weighted cross section .",
    "cross sections for photodissociation reactions on @xmath3he , @xmath0he , and d are well determined from threshold up to several tens of mev .",
    "the errors in these measurements are sufficiently small ( @xmath11 20% ) that our conclusions will not be affected by improved measurements of these cross sections .",
    "table [ table : crosssections ] contains a summary of the calculated energy - weighted cross sections .",
    "we can describe the evolution of the element abundances locally by @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the number density ( at location @xmath14 and time t ) of nuclide @xmath15 and @xmath16 is the time - independent photon flux .",
    "we can further generalize eqn .",
    "[ eqn : dndt ] by writing the number density as @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the local matter density . for a time - independent @xmath18 , eqn .",
    "[ eqn : dndt ] can be rewritten with the @xmath19 replacing the @xmath20 and yielding solutions which are the same to within a dimensional constant .    in general , eqn .",
    "[ eqn : dndt ] might also include @xmath21-decay terms which act as both production and destruction mechanisms . in our case the only unstable nuclides of importance are @xmath0h and neutrons .",
    "reaction cross sections ( and thus the energy - weighted cross sections ) for photoproduction and photodissociation of @xmath0h are very similar to those for @xmath0he ( see table [ table : crosssections ] ) . for neutrons",
    "the situation is even simpler since all are assumed to decay to protons without undergoing nuclear reactions .",
    "therefore we treat @xmath0h as @xmath0he and neutrons as protons in our calculations .",
    "the simplest model is to adopt a uniform isotropic @xmath8-ray distribution ( i.e. @xmath22 is constant ) and a uniform matter density distribution in eqn .",
    "[ eqn : dndt ] .",
    "such a distribution could be produced by a universe populated with a high density of black holes which tend to smear out the @xmath23 dependence of the photon flux from an individual source .",
    "[ eqn : dndt ] then describes a set of coupled differential equations which can be evolved forward in time as a function of the `` exposure''(@xmath24 ) for each element .",
    "furthermore , the solutions obtained from this simple model can be modified to include effects from non - isotropic photon fluxes or non - uniform density distributions .",
    "these effects are folded into the solutions to eqn .",
    "[ eqn : dndt ] by a weighting procedure of the form    @xmath25    where @xmath26 is the position - dependent exposure .",
    "note that with @xmath27 we recover the original local solutions .",
    "we examine the effects of several functional forms for @xmath28 . in the first case",
    "we assume that there are two separately processed regions .",
    "then @xmath28 is simply a sum of two @xmath29 functions . in the second case",
    ", we have assumed a uniform population of black holes surrounded by a uniform density of matter .",
    "processing of the matter is dominated by the nearest black hole .",
    "thus the final element abundances are given by a spatial averaging of the processed material .",
    "in the third case , we consider not only a distribution of black holes but a density distribution which varies as @xmath23 so as to produce a flat rotation curve . from these examples",
    ", we reach some general conclusions about the necessary ( and artificial ) form @xmath28 must have in order to obtain a viable model .",
    "the criterion for these models to be viable is that the calculated abundances are within the limits determined by the observed light element abundances ( see table [ table : obslimits ] ) .",
    "we have chosen realistic but generous ( 2@xmath5 or greater ) limits so that if a model does fail , the failure is due to the model not to the choice of limits .",
    "the standard model of big bang nucleosynthesis is in agreement with our limits for @xmath30 .",
    "in each of the scenarios mentioned above , we have presented the solutions in two different ways .",
    "first , we use initial abundances from standard big bang nucleosynthesis which allows us to parameterize our four initial abundances in terms of the baryon - to - photon ratio @xmath2 .",
    "we can then follow the evolution of the abundances as a function of the exposure , @xmath31 .",
    "second , since it can be argued that an assumption of the existence of primordial black holes negates the sbbn model and necessitates the use of the inhomogeneous model , we invert the solutions to eqn .",
    "[ eqn : dndt ] for each of our scenarios . then using the observed abundances",
    ", we can trace the evolution backwards in time to solve for the primordial values as a function of the exposure .",
    "thus we avoid making any assumptions about the isotopic content of the pre - photoprocessed universe .",
    "we have calculated the abundances of the light elements relative to hydrogen for isotropic exposures @xmath32 photons/@xmath33 @xmath34 starting with initial abundances determined from the sbbn model with @xmath35 . fig . [",
    "fig : abun_vs_phit ] shows the evolution of the abundances as a function of the exposure , @xmath31 .",
    "horizontal lines represent the observationally inferred abundances . in fig .",
    "[ fig : abun_map ] we map out the regions of @xmath24 versus @xmath2 space where the individual abundances agree with observation . at no values of @xmath2 and @xmath24",
    "can the processed abundances of @xmath3he , @xmath0he , and d be reconciled with the observed limits except in the region where the unprocessed abundances already essentially agree with observation .",
    "in fact , this scenario can be ruled out by just looking at the @xmath3he and @xmath0he abundances . since most @xmath3he is being converted directly into @xmath0he and the @xmath3he abundance",
    "is so much greater than @xmath0he , any small change in the @xmath3he abundance is accompanied by a very large change in the @xmath0he abundance .",
    "this is clearly seen in the figures to be independent of the initial @xmath0he abundance ( and therefore also independent of @xmath2 ) .",
    "deuterium is constrained to rise more slowly than @xmath0he because its production is predominantly from @xmath0he through the @xmath0he(@xmath8,p)d reaction .",
    "therefore , deuterium production can not proceed until a significant quantity of @xmath0he has been created .    at large exposures , when most of the @xmath3he has been destroyed , the @xmath0he abundance begins to decrease , eventually reaching agreement with observation .",
    "however , this large @xmath24 scenario is ruled out because the @xmath3he and d abundances are well outside the observational bounds .    we have inverted the solutions to eqn .",
    "[ eqn : dndt ] in order to calculate the possible combinations of initial abundances for which this model will work .",
    "we are therefore no longer constrained by sbbn .",
    "solutions for the initial abundances , which when processed for a given @xmath24 yield light element abundances in agreement with observations , are found only for @xmath36 photons/@xmath33 @xmath34 .",
    "therefore , no significant processing occurs .",
    "indeed , the _ initial _ @xmath3he and @xmath0he abundances are constrained to be within the observational limits . the initial d abundance can be less than the observed lower limit by only @xmath37 5% and can not be more than the observed upper limit . the initial @xmath4li abundance can be no more than 0.3% above the upper limit .      we have investigated the possibility of reconciling the helium and deuterium isotope abundances by assuming a two - zone model , i.  e.  @xmath28 is a sum of two @xmath29 functions .",
    "this provides a simplified description of a mixture of material processed through different exposures . in this case ,",
    "space is divided into two regions , one of which undergoes very little or no processing and the other undergoes a great deal of processing . in the former case ,",
    "deuterium and @xmath0he agree with observation and @xmath3he is overabundant .",
    "it is also necessary that @xmath38 so that deuterium is not underproduced ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : abun_vs_phit ] ) .",
    "the latter zone undergoes significantly more processing such that most of the @xmath3he is destroyed .",
    "also , the @xmath0he and deuterium which have been created from the processed @xmath3he have been destroyed to such an extent that they once again are close to the observational limits .",
    "then by adjusting the relative volumes of the two zones ( such that the larger volume is only slightly processed and the smaller volume is highly processed ) , one can force agreement between the processed @xmath3he and the observational limits . in the larger mostly - unprocessed zone",
    "the @xmath0he abundance constrains @xmath39 .",
    "the @xmath3he and @xmath4li are therefore essentially unprocessed . however , since @xmath4li is overproduced by a greater factor than @xmath3he , and the zone - mixing reduces the @xmath4li by the same fraction as @xmath3he , the @xmath4li is still overproduced in this model . the only way to reconcile the model with observation is to start with primordial abundances for @xmath4li , @xmath0he , and deuterium which agree with the observational limits already . even then , the primordial @xmath3he can not be more than a few percent overabundant due to the constraints placed on @xmath2 by @xmath4li .      although the two - zone model shows clearly why agreement can not be attained between the primordial abundances and observation , it is too simple a model from which to infer general conclusions . in order to investigate a more physical picture , we have studied a model that has a uniform distribution of black holes that are assumed to be weak enough and/or far enough apart that processing of the primordial material is dominated by the closest black hole . in order to account for the spatial variation of the photon flux , we modify eqn .",
    "[ eqn : dndt ] by setting @xmath40 , where @xmath41 is the total @xmath8-ray luminosity from one accreting black hole .",
    "we can then write the spatially - averaged abundance relative to hydrogen as @xmath42    we examine two cases in detail . in the first case , we assume that @xmath43 is constant , i.e. the matter is distributed homogeneously",
    ". then eqn .",
    "[ eqn : radial_average ] can be written more conveniently in terms of one parameter @xmath44 to yield @xmath45    alternatively , if we assume that the density of matter falls off with distance from the central source as @xmath46 ( which will yield the flat rotation curves seen in galaxies ) then eqn .",
    "[ eqn : radial_average ] becomes @xmath47    figures [ fig : uniform_density ] and [ fig : flat_rotation ] show the dependence of the abundances on @xmath48 ( with @xmath49 so that @xmath50 ) for three values of @xmath2",
    ". figures [ fig : uniform_density_map ] and [ fig : flat_rotation_map ] illustrate the regions of @xmath51 space where the spatially - averaged abundances agree with observation .",
    "it is clearly seen that there is no region of parameter space where the models agree with the observed abundances of @xmath3he , @xmath0he , and d simultaneously except where the standard model ( for low baryon density ) already works .",
    "we have also searched for solutions for @xmath52 , where processed material with exposure greater than @xmath53 is assumed to be swallowed by the black hole and thus does not contribute to the spatial average .",
    "no non - trivial solutions were found .    as with the isotropic photon flux scenario , we have inverted the solutions to eqns .",
    "[ eqn : radial_multsqrtx ] and [ eqn : radial_divsqrtx ] in order to calculate the possible combinations of initial abundances for which these models will succeed .",
    "solutions for the initial abundances , which when processed yield light element abundances in agreement with observations , are found only for @xmath54 and @xmath55 photons/@xmath33 @xmath34 for the uniform density and the flat rotation curve models , respectively .",
    "again , no significant processing occurs and the _ initial _ @xmath3he and @xmath0he abundances are constrained to be within the observed limits .",
    "the initial d abundance may be less than the observed lower limit by only @xmath37 5% and it can not be higher than the observed upper limit . the initial @xmath4li abundance can be no more than 0.3% above the upper limit .",
    "it might be thought that the detailed shape of the photon spectrum will affect the present results .",
    "however , changing the power law index or using the parameterization of go causes only small changes in the energy - weighted cross sections . in the go case ,",
    "the energy - weighted cross sections are increased by no more than a factor of 4 even when using the most extreme distortion of the spectrum .",
    "furthermore , changes in the spectra change all the energy - weighted cross sections in the same direction , so the effect on resulting abundances is less than that on the cross sections . since our conclusions are based on qualitative conflicts between observations and the model predictions , it is not likely that uncertainties in the photon spectrum will affect our conclusions .",
    "so far we have provided examples of models that do nt work .",
    "is it possible to construct a non - trivial model that will work ?",
    "that is , can we construct a weighting function @xmath28 ( see eqn .",
    "[ eqn : weighted_average ] ) that will reconcile the solutions to eqn .",
    "[ eqn : dndt ] ( shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : abun_vs_phit ] ) with the observed limits ?",
    "in constructing such a model , two important features must be kept in mind .",
    "first , the weighting function must preferentially mix regions such that a larger fraction of @xmath4li is destroyed than of @xmath3he .",
    "since the destruction cross section for @xmath4li is higher than for @xmath3he , this may be possible .",
    "second , the weighting function must avoid appreciable contributions from the region @xmath56 in order to avoid overproducing @xmath0he and d. as a result , such a function is forced to be of the form shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : weight ] .",
    "this bimodal distribution is decidedly ad hoc ! but , even with a weighting function of this type , it is difficult ( and perhaps impossible ) to reproduce the observed primordial abundances of d , @xmath0he , @xmath3he , and @xmath4li .",
    "we have investigated several scenarios in which the primordial abundances of the light elements undergo photoprocessing due to a population of @xmath8-emitting objects such as accreting black holes ( go ) . in all cases ,",
    "the primordial @xmath3he abundance is constrained to agree with observation since even a small amount of processing of @xmath3he increases the @xmath0he and d abundances by several orders of magnitude . at large exposures , when destruction of @xmath0he and d has occurred , their abundances relative to hydrogen become independent of initial values and can not simultaneously be reconciled with observation . a general solution which would correct for this effect must preferentially weight the processed regions in such a way as to be pathological .    in short , we find no non - trivial solution to any of the several photodissociation models considered for either sbbn or inhomogeneous bbn abundances corresponding to large values of @xmath2 .",
