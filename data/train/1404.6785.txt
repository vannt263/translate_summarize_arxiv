    "moving target defense ( mtd ) is believed to be a  game changer \" for cyber defense .",
    "although there have been many studies on specific mtd techniques , the power of mtd is often demonstrated via simulation . rigorously characterizing the power of mtd is an important problem and",
    "is closely related to the well known hard problem of security metrics . in this paper",
    ", we initiate the study of a novel approach for characterizing the power of mtd .",
    "we propose to use the cyber epidemic dynamics approach to characterize the power of _ classes _ of mtd techniques .",
    "we define and investigate two novel and complementary security measures that are applicable when using mtd to achieve a certain defense goal . the first measure is centered on the _ maximum _ portion of time ( in the equilibrium ) during which the system can afford to stay in an undesired / insecure configuration ( or posture ) , without considering the cost of deploying mtd .",
    "the second measure is centered on the _ minimum _ cost when the system has to stay in an undesired / insecure configuration ( or posture ) for a predetermined portion of time .",
    "our analytic studies lead to algorithms for deploying mtd in such optimal fashions . to our knowledge , this is the first systematic study on characterizing the power of classes of mtd techniques .      rigorously characterizing the power of mtd ( or any defense ) would be a core problem in the science of security . indeed , the present study initiates a paradigm for measuring the power of mtd ( or other kinds of defense techniques whose deployment can make a global difference ) .",
    "the paradigm is centered on measuring the degree of undersired / insecure configurations that can be tolerated by deploying advanced defense such as mtd .",
    "the specific criterion used in the present paper , namely that the attacks are eventually wiped out in a certain sense , can be substituted by other criteria .",
    "one possible candidate is the containment of malware infections to a certain tolerable level @xcite ( e.g. , by appropriately choosing threshold cryptosystems ) .",
    "the present paper does not introduce any new mtd technique .",
    "rather , it studies how to systematically characterize the power of mtd and optimally launch mtd .",
    "existing studies for a similar purpose are often based on simulation @xcite .",
    "there is effort at analytically evaluating the power of some _ specific _ mtd techniques from a _",
    "view @xcite ; in contrast , we characterize the power of _ classes _ of mtd techniques from a _ global _ view .",
    "cyber epidemic dynamics was rooted in biological epidemic dynamics @xcite .",
    "the first cyber epidemic models @xcite were limited by their _ homogeneity _",
    "assumption that each computer / node has the same effect on the others .",
    "recently , models that are more appropriate for studying cyber security problems have been proposed @xcite . as we will elaborate later",
    ", the basic idea underlying these models is to use a graph - theoretic abstraction to represent the _ attack - defense _ structure , and use _ parameters _ to represent attack and defense capabilities .",
    "cyber epidemic dynamics is a special kind of _ cybersecurity dynamics _",
    "@xcite ,    we will use the cyber epidemic dynamics model in @xcite as the starting point of our study .",
    "this model @xcite describes _ reactive adaptive defense _",
    "( i.e. , the defender aims to adjust its defense to control / contain the global security state ) .",
    "we extend this model to accommodate mtd , a kind of _ proactive defense _ , and the resulting model is analyzed using different skills @xcite .",
    "we mention that the effect of dynamic structures in cyber epidemic models is studied in @xcite , where the structure dynamics however follows a _ deterministic and periodic _ process , rather than _ adaptively _ scheduled by using ( for example ) mtd .",
    "we also mention that the effect of dynamic semi - heterogeneous structures ( i.e. , clustered networks ) , rather than arbitrary heterogeneous structures , is studied in @xcite .",
    "these studies @xcite consider static parameters only and do not have any of the measures we propose to use .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec :",
    "models - accommodating - mtd ] , we present a classification of mtd techniques and describe a cyber epidemic dynamics model that can accommodate mtd . in section [ sdvsss ] ,",
    "we characterize the power of mtd that induces dynamic parameters . in section [ dsvsss ] , we characterize the power of mtd that induces dynamic attack - defense structures . we discuss the limitations of the present study in section [ sec : extension - and - discussion ] .",
    "we conclude the paper in section [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "as mentioned in section [ sec : related - work ] and elaborated later , cyber epidemic dynamics models use a graph - theoretic abstraction to represent the _ attack - defense _ structure , and use _ parameters _ to represent attack and defense ecapabilities .",
    "this suggests us to classify mtd techniques based on what they will induce changes to the attack - defense structure and/or parameters .",
    "example techniques that fall into this class are _ ip address ( and tcp port ) randomization _ and _ dynamic access control_. the basic idea underlying ip address and tcp port randomization is to frequently shuffle the ip addresses of computers by using various methods .",
    "one method is to use virtual machine techniques , such as migrating ensembles of virtual machines @xcite and others @xcite .",
    "another method is to use networking techniques , such as network address space randomization ( nasr ) whereby ip addresses can be dynamically assigned ( in lieu of dhcp ) to render the attacker s hitlist useless @xcite , ip hopping @xcite and others @xcite .",
    "a recent variant also considers constraints and how to minimize the operation cost @xcite .",
    "the basic idea underlying dynamic access control is to dynamically regulate which computers or which network address space can directly have access to the services in which other network address space .",
    "for example , certain servers on a campus network only accommodate service requests from certain classrooms . by dynamically randomizing ip addresses of authorized computers ( e.g. , using aforementioned techniques ) ,",
    "some compromised computers can not launch direct attacks against some target computers .",
    "four kinds of techniques fall into this class : instruction - level , code - level , memory - level , and application - level .",
    "one _ instruction - level _ technique is called instruction set randomization ( isr ) , which aims to randomize the instructions of each process so that the attacker can not inject executable malicious code @xcite .",
    "isr uses a program - specific key to encrypt the instructions of a program and the processor uses the same key to decrypt and run the instructions , where encryption is often based on binary transformation tools , and decryption is often based on dynamic binary instrumentation tools @xcite , emulators @xcite , or architectural support @xcite .",
    "one _ code - level _ technique is _ code randomization _",
    "code randomization offers fine - grained protection against code reuse attacks by substituting / reordering instructions , inserting nops , and re - allocating registers .",
    "code randomization operations can be conducted at the compiler @xcite or virtual machine level @xcite , or via static binary rewriting @xcite and runtime binary rewriting @xcite .",
    "dynamically generated code can be randomized as well @xcite .",
    "one _ memory - level _ technique is called address space layout randomization ( aslr ) , which defeats code - injection attacks by randomizing the memory layout of a program ( e.g. , stack ) either at the compile time or at the runtime @xcite .",
    "aslr can protect an executable ( including the associated static data , stack , heap and dynamic libraries ) @xcite and the operating system kernel @xcite , but can not defeat code reuse attacks .",
    "one _ application - level _ technique is called @xmath0-version programming @xcite , by which the defender can dynamically use different implementations of the same program function .",
    "another technique is called _",
    "proactive cryptography_. cryptographic properties proven in abstract models are undermined by attacks ( e.g. , malware ) that can compromise cryptographic keys .",
    "threshold cryptography can avoid this single - point - of - failure because it  split \" a key into @xmath1 pieces such that compromising fewer than @xmath2 pieces will not cause exposure of the key , while the cryptographic function can be computed when any @xmath2 of the @xmath1 pieces participate @xcite .",
    "proactive cryptography can render the compromised pieces of a key useless once the pieces are re - shuffled @xcite .",
    "the defender can utilize honeypot - like techniques to capture new attacks . however , the attacker can  tomograph \" honeypots and bypass the ip addresses monitored by them . therefore",
    ", the defender can dynamically change the ip addresses monitored by honeypots @xcite .",
    "the basic idea underlying cyber epidemic dynamics models ( see , for example , @xcite ) can be explained as follows .",
    "cyber attacks are often launched from compromised computers against vulnerable computers .",
    "this means that there exists an @xmath3 relation , which captures that an attacker ( e.g. , compromised computer ) can _ directly _ attack a victim ( e.g. , vulnerable ) computer . in the extreme case where any computer can attack any other computer",
    ", this relation induces a complete graph structure . in general ,",
    "any graph structure can be relevant .",
    "the resulting graph structures are called _ attack - defense structures _",
    ", where compromised computers / nodes may be detected and cured , but may later get attacked again .",
    "such models can naturally abstract attack and defense capabilities as _ parameters _ that are associated to the nodes and edges of attack - defense structures . a core concept in cyber epidemic dynamics models",
    "is the so - called _ epidemic threshold _ , namely a",
    "_ sufficient condition _ under which the epidemic dynamics converges to the clean state .",
    "we adapt the cyber epidemic dynamics model introduced in @xcite , which considers _ reactive adaptive defense _ , to accommodate mtd ( i.e. , _ proactive defense _ ) .",
    "specifically , the afore - discussed * class i * mtd techniques can be accommodated with _",
    "dynamic attack - defense structures _ , because they can cause that an infected computer may be able to attack a vulnerable computer at time @xmath4 but not at time @xmath5 ( e.g. , the vulnerable computer s ip address has been changed ) . * class ii * mtd techniques can be accommodated with dynamic parameters because they can affect capabilities of attacker and defender over time . *",
    "class iii * mtd techniques can be accommodated with dynamic attack - defense structures ( because an ip address assigned to honeypot at time @xmath4 may be re - assigned to a production computer at time @xmath5 ) _ and _ dynamic parameters ( because the defender could learn zero - day attacks from honeypot - captured data , and identify and disseminate countermeasures to prevent / detect such attacks ) . as such , our characterization study can accommodate the three classes of mtd techniques .",
    "specifically , we consider a cyber epidemic dynamics model with dynamic attack - defense structure @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the set of nodes ( e.g. , computers ) and @xmath8 is the set of edges at time @xmath2 such that @xmath9 means that node @xmath10 can attack node @xmath11 at time @xmath2 .",

    "however , it would be more realistic that the defender can maintain such configurations as @xmath43 ( @xmath40 ) for a small period of time , because the attacker can introduce ( for example ) zero - day attacks to force the system to depart from configuration @xmath43 and enter configuration @xmath44 .",
