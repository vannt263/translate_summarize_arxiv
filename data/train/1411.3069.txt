    "dipolar quantum gases expand the scope of ultracold atom experiments by introducing anisotropic and long - range interactions , providing new avenues for exploring correlated many - body systems  @xcite .",
    "experiments employing the open - shell lanthanides  and in particular dysprosium ( dy ) , an element with unsurpassed magnetic moment  offer the possibility to extend the foundational experiments performed with chromium ( @xmath7 )  @xcite to new regimes of ultracold dipolar physics .",
    "in particular , bosonic and fermionic quantum degenerate gases have been produced with dy ( @xmath8 )  @xcite and erbium ( @xmath9 ) @xcite .",
    "specifically , of dy s five naturally abundant isotopes  two fermions , three bosons  quantum gases of fermionic @xmath10dy  @xcite and bosonic @xmath6dy  @xcite have been produced .",
    "we report bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) of the two remaining high - abundance bosonic isotopes , @xmath0dy and @xmath4dy .",
    "notably , we find @xmath0dy condensates are ten - times larger than those of @xmath6dy , and may be produced in less than 18 s , while @xmath4dy are tiny and may only be condensed through careful use of a low - field fano - feshbach resonance  @xcite .",
    "initial laser cooling and trapping of dy atoms is performed using techniques explained in previous works @xcite . in brief , atoms from a high - temperature effusive cell are loaded into a magneto - optical trap ( mot ) via a zeeman slower , both with 421-nm laser light .",
    "the loading time for this mot stage is 5  s for @xmath0dy and 10  s for @xmath4dy .",
    "this difference is due to their different natural abundance : 25.5% for @xmath0dy and 2.3% for @xmath4dy .",
    "the atoms are subsequently transferred into a blue - detuned , narrow - linewidth mot at 741  nm for 5  s , reaching a final atom number of @xmath11 for @xmath0dy and @xmath12 for @xmath4dy , both at @xmath13 and spin - polarized in @xmath14 .",
    "the atomic cloud is subsequently loaded into a horizontal optical dipole trap ( odt1 ) ( see figure  [ setup ] ) formed by a 1064-nm laser beam with waists of @xmath15 and @xmath16 and an initial power of 5.0(3 ) w. to improve loading efficiency , we broaden the trap to an aspect ratio of @xmath175 by scanning the beam horizontally with an acousto - optic modulator  @xcite . once loaded into odt1 , the atoms are transferred to the absolute electronic ground state @xmath18 by radio - frequency - induced adiabatic rapid passage . loading into this state eliminates loss due to rapid dipolar relaxation  @xcite . after compressing this trap by ramping off the horizontal modulation and increasing the power , we have @xmath17@xmath19 @xmath0dy or @xmath17@xmath20 @xmath4dy atoms at a temperature of 5 - 10 @xmath21k , which sets the starting point for forced evaporative cooling .",
    "we perform forced evaporative cooling of @xmath0dy at a constant vertical magnetic field @xmath22  g to avoid fano - feshbach resonances  @xcite .",
    "our evaporative scheme employs two crossed optical dipole traps ( codts ) consisting of three 1064-nm beams shown in figure [ setup ] .",
    "the beams in both codts are detuned by @xmath17160  mhz to avoid interferences .",
    "the first codt is formed by crossing odt1 with a vertical beam ( odt2 ) of circular waist @xmath23 .",
    "evaporation begins by reducing the powers of odt1 and odt2 for 2  s from 5.0(3 )  w to 1.0(1 )  w and 4.0(2 )  w to 3.2(2 )  w , respectively .",
    "both ramps take the form @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is time , and @xmath26 and @xmath27 are experimentally optimized parameters @xcite .",
    "the phase space density of the atomic cloud is two orders of magnitude away from condensation at this stage .",
    "we load the atoms into the second codt in 1  s by linearly increasing the power of odt2 to 5.6(3 )  w , linearly reducing the power of odt1 to 0  w , and by ramping up a second horizontal 1064-nm beam ( odt3 ) to 2.5(1 )  w. odt3 is cylindrical with a horizontal waist of @xmath28 and vertical waist of @xmath29 .",
    "while the first codt is very tight for efficient initial evaporation , the second codt is larger to avoid inelastic three - body collisions .",
    "this second codt is oblate , with the tight axis along @xmath30 , to avoid trap instabilities due to the dipole - dipole interaction ( ddi )  @xcite .",
    "the second evaporation stage begins with @xmath31 atoms .",
    "the powers of odt2 and odt3 are reduced in 5  s according to the same functional form provided above .",
    "beginning with loading the first mot stage , the total time to a pure @xmath0dy bec is 18  s. after evaporative cooling , the atomic cloud is released for imaging by quickly ( @xmath3210  @xmath21s ) turning off the trapping beams , whereby the cloud expands freely for a variable time - of - flight ( tof ) . at the end of this tof ,",
    "we perform absorption imaging using resonant 421-nm light , where the magnetic field is kept constant along @xmath30 until rapidly switching to @xmath33  1  ms before imaging .",
    "this provides a quantization axis for the @xmath34-transition , which has the largest photon scattering cross section for the @xmath18 state .",
    "single - shot absorption images after 20-ms tof are shown in figure [ 162bec](a ) , ( c ) , and ( e ) , with their corresponding 1d integrated densities along @xmath35 shown in  [ 162bec](b ) , ( d ) , and ( f ) .",

    "as we lower the final trap depth , the density in the center of the cloud dramatically increases while the thermal fraction decreases , as shown in panels c - d for @xmath39 atoms at @xmath40 nk . a nearly pure bec of @xmath41 @xmath0dy atoms at @xmath42  nk is shown in figure  [ 162bec ] e - f . the thermal background is hardly visible , and the cloud has an aspect ratio of 2.6 .",
    "the evaporation is quite efficient , with the log of the ratio of phase - space density increase to atom loss exceeding three for most of the sequence .",
    "the final powers of odt2 and odt3 are 400(20 ) mw and 310(20 ) mw , respectively .",
    "we measured the final trap frequencies to be [ @xmath43 = @xmath44[66(2 ) , 30(3 ) , 131(1 ) ] hz , resulting in an oblate - trap aspect ratio of @xmath45 .",

    ". a thermal gas will expand into a spherical cloud at long tof while a bec will expand anisotropically , inverting its aspect ratio .",
    "the result of our measurement is shown in figure  [ 162inversion ] .",
    "the aspect ratio of the bec in the trap is @xmath170.5 , consistent with the measured trap frequencies .",
    "the aspect ratio is unity at @xmath176  ms tof and reverses at longer tofs , reaching 1.5 after 20 ms of tof . as mentioned above",
    ", our bias field during evaporative cooling is in @xmath30 , whereas our imaging scheme requires a quantization field along @xmath33 . to measure the aspect ratio of the bec without switching field direction during its evolution ,",
    "we adiabatically rotate the field to @xmath33 in 10 ms after the evaporation ramps .",
    "we make sure that no fano - feshbach resonances are encountered by maintaining a constant field magnitude , verified through rf spectroscopy , and we hold this configuration for 100 ms to ensure a steady state before releasing the cloud . the magnetic field",
    "is then kept constant during tof and imaging .",
    "it is worth noting that for this field orientation , the final aspect ratio , 1.5 , is not as large as the aspect ratio of 2.6 shown in figure [ 162bec](e ) .",
    "this dependence of aspect ratio on field angle is a manifestation of the anisotropy of the ddi  @xcite .    for the measurement shown in figure  [ 162inversion ] ,",
    "we drive @xmath51 transitions for absorption imaging to avoid ccd saturation at short expansion times , where the optical density of the cloud is very high .",
    "this technique is based on the fact that for a high - spin atom like dy , the transition strength in the stretched state is extremely different for @xmath34 and @xmath51 transitions . for bosonic dy in the @xmath18 state ,",
    "the transition strength ratio is @xmath52 @xcite . hence imaging with resonant @xmath51 light",
    "greatly reduces the effective optical density and is free of dispersive effects associated with off - resonant light . because optical pumping occurs during imaging with @xmath51 light , extracting the atom number from these images requires delicate calibration and detailed theoretical modeling .",
    "however , aspect - ratio measurements are largely unaffected by pumping effects during the 20-@xmath21s imaging pulse .",
    "we use a very similar two - stage cooling scheme for the isotope @xmath4dy .",
    "the first stage of forced evaporative cooling is 3-s long , during which we ramp down the power of odt1 from 5.0(3 )  w to 1.3(1 )  w and that of odt2 from 5.6(3 )  w to 2.0(1 )  w. the initial power of odt2 for the second stage is 5.6(3 )  w and that of odt3 is 3.0(2 )  w. we found that evaporation efficiency is very low for @xmath4dy at fields free from the effects of fano - feshbach resonances , preventing the formation of bec .",
    "this observation suggests that @xmath4dy has unfavorable scattering properties .",
    "publication of measurements of its scattering length , as well as those of @xmath0dy and @xmath6dy , are forthcoming  @xcite .    a useful method for changing the scattering length of ultracold atoms is to tune the magnetic field near a fano - feshbach resonance  @xcite .",
