    "in a parton model picture , parton distribution functions ( pdfs ) describe combinations of number densities of quarks and gluons in a fast - moving hadron and are a crucial ingredient for our understandings of high - energy experiments involving hadrons . at leading twist , the quark structure of spin - half hadrons",
    "is described by three pdfs : the unpolarized distribution @xmath2 , the longitudinal polarization ( helicity ) distribution @xmath3 , and the transverse polarization ( transversity ) distribution @xmath4 . from the phenomenological point of view",
    ", @xmath4 is the least known one because , being chiral - odd , it can be measured only in processes with two hadrons in the initial state ( _ e.g. _ proton - proton collision ) or one hadron in the initial state and at least one hadron in the final state ( _ e.g. _ semi - inclusive dis - sidis ) .    combining data on polarized single - hadron sidis , together with data on almost back - to - back emission of two hadrons in @xmath0 annihilations ,",
    "the transversity distribution was extracted for the first time by the torino group  @xcite .",
    "the main difficulty of such analysis lies in the factorization framework used to interpret the data , since it involves transverse momentum dependent pdfs ( tmds ) .",
    "qcd evolution of tmds must be included to analyze sidis and @xmath0 data obtained at very different scales , but the computation of its effects is still under active debate .",
    "recently , the impact of evolution on @xmath4 was estimated in the so - called css framework  @xcite .",
    "alternatively , the transversity distribution can be extracted in the standard framework of collinear factorization using data on sidis with two hadrons detected in the final state .",
    "in fact , @xmath4 is multiplied with a specific chiral - odd di - hadron fragmentation function ( diff )  @xcite , which can be extracted from the corresponding @xmath0 annihilation process leading to two back - to - back pion pairs  @xcite .",
    "the collinear framework allows to keep under control the evolution equations of diffs  @xcite . using two - hadron sidis data on proton and deuteron targets from hermes  @xcite and compass  @xcite , as well as belle data for the process @xmath5",
    "@xcite , the transversity @xmath4 was extracted for the first time in the collinear framework  @xcite and the valence components of up and down quark were separated  @xcite . in this contribution to the proceedings , we summarize the parametrization and the error analysis both for @xmath4 and for the diffs  @xcite",
    ".    we also comment on re - analyzing the @xmath5 process by including structures violating parity invariance ( p - odd structures ) .",
    "p - odd diffs arise when the fragmenting quark crosses local ( in space and time ) domains where strong interactions break parity invariance .",
    "these p - odd bubbles can be induced by topologically nontrivial solutions of qcd equations of motion , which suggest that the physical vacuum is a superposition of degenerate states , the so - called @xmath1 vacuum  @xcite , and that topological fluctuations in this vacuum structure can be equivalently represented by a local p - odd term in the qcd lagrangian  @xcite .",
    "p - odd diffs generate new azimuthally asymmetric terms in the cross section for the @xmath5 process , similarly to what happens for the @xmath6 one  @xcite but in a collinear framework . here , we write the full structure of the leading twist cross section and we try to estimate the size of the p - odd contributions .",
    "we consider the process @xmath7 , where @xmath8 denotes the beam lepton , @xmath9 the nucleon target with mass @xmath10 and polarization @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 the produced unpolarized hadrons with masses @xmath14 and @xmath15 , respectively ( the four - momenta are given in parentheses ) .",
    "we define the total @xmath16 and relative @xmath17 momenta of the pair , with @xmath18 and @xmath19 the momentum transferred .",
    "we define the azimuthal angles @xmath20 and @xmath21 as the angles of @xmath22 and @xmath23 , respectively , around the virtual photon direction @xmath24 .",
    "we also define the polar angle @xmath1 which is the angle between the direction of the back - to - back emission in the center - of - mass ( cm ) frame of the two hadrons , and the direction of @xmath25 in the photon - proton cm frame .",
    "then , @xmath26 and @xmath27 is a function of the invariant mass only  @xcite .",
    "finally , we usually define the sidis invariants @xmath28 to leading twist , the differential cross section for the two - hadron sidis off a transversely polarized nucleon target becomes  @xcite @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the fine structure constant , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , and @xmath33 with @xmath34 the fractional charge of a parton with flavor @xmath35 .",
    "the @xmath36 is the diff describing the hadronization of an unpolarized parton with flavor @xmath35 into an unpolarized hadron pair .",
    "the @xmath37 is its chiral - odd partner describing the same fragmentation but for a transversely polarized parton  @xcite .",
    "diffs can be expanded in legendre polynomials in @xmath38  @xcite . after averaging over @xmath38 , only the term corresponding to the unpolarized pair being created in a relative @xmath39 state survives in the @xmath40 expansion , while the interference in @xmath41 survives for @xmath42  @xcite . without ambiguity , the two terms will be identified with @xmath40 and @xmath42 , respectively .    inserting the structure functions of eq .",

    "moreover , from eq .",
    "( [ sidisssa ] ) the @xmath49-dependence of transversity is more conveniently studied by integrating the @xmath50- and @xmath51-dependences of diffs .",

    "in fact , after the annihilation a quark and an antiquark are emitted back - to - back , each one fragmenting into a residual jet and a @xmath58 pair . the leading - twist cross section in collinear factorization , namely by integrating upon all transverse momenta but @xmath22 and @xmath59 , can be written as  @xcite @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the symmetric term corresponding to the production of unpolarized quark and antiquark , and the azimuthal angles @xmath20 and @xmath62 give the orientation of the planes containing the momenta of the pion pairs with respect to the lepton plane ( see fig.1 of ref .   for more details ) .",
    "the azimuthally asymmetric term is generated from the production of the quark and antiquark being transversely polarized .",
