    "nichols algebras are hopf algebras in a braided category , that enjoy certain universal properties and appear naturally in every pointed hopf algebra .",
    "the most prominent examples are the borel parts @xmath0 of the small quantum groups .",
    "in fact the lie - theoretical flavour is retained in general , and we know from @xcite that any nichols algebra is controlled by a weyl groupoid .",
    "this is a natural generalization of a weyl group , where different dynkin diagrams are attached to the different groupoid objects .",
    "since @xcite we have a good perception of a weyl groupoid as an arrangement of hyperplanes , and in @xcite all finite weyl groupoids were classified : there are infinitely many finite weyl groupoids of rank @xmath1 , an additional infinite series between @xmath2 and @xmath3 , as well as @xmath4 sporadic cases up to rank @xmath5 .",
    "however , compared to the theory of semisimple lie algebras where root systems provide a complete classification ( at least over the complex numbers ) , for nichols algebras the situation is more complicated : there are non - isomorphic nichols algebras whose corresponding weyl groupoids are equivalent , and it is not known yet whether all weyl groupoids arise as symmetry structures of nichols algebras ( not even in the case of finite weyl groupoids ) . the latter problem has been brought up on several occasions , notably by the first author at the oberwolfach mini - workshop on `` nichols algebras and weyl groupoids '' in 2012 :    [ q_cuntz ] is there a weyl groupoid which does not occur as symmetry structure of a nichols algebra ?",
    "is there a characterization of those root systems that can not appear as root systems of nichols algebras ?    one way to answer part of these questions is to introduce constructions producing new nichols algebras ( and hopefully new weyl groupoids as well ) .",
    "for example , _ folding of root systems _ has been investigated by the second author to construct new large rank nichols algebras over nonabelian groups @xcite . as proven recently by heckenberger and vendramin @xcite , these nichols algebras are the only examples in large rank and characteristic zero . there are four exceptions of rank two and three which are not obtained by this folding construction , and for rank one the classification is still largely open .",
    "the second author hence asked at the oberwolfach mini - workshop on `` infinite dimensional hopf algebras '' in 2014 :    [ q_lentner ] systematically explain the impact of the folding contruction on the root system .",
    "are there more general folding constructions on the root system of a nichols algebra ?",
    "is there a closed construction of all nichols algebras over nonabelian groups in this way ?    in this article",
    "we discuss such a construction , which partly answers the previous questions , namely _ restriction _ on the arrangement of hyperplanes given by the root system .",
    "more precisely we proceed as follows : + the set @xmath6 of hyperplanes @xmath7 orthogonal to the roots is a _ crystallographic arrangement _ and this induces an equivalence between crystallographic arrangements and finite root systems .",
    "for details see the preliminaries in section [ sec_rootsystems ] .",
    "let @xmath8 be a subspace of @xmath9 .",
    "then the restriction @xmath10 is the set of hyperplanes in @xmath6 of the form @xmath11 for @xmath12 .",
    "this construction is discussed in section 3 .",
    "typically , not all hyperplanes @xmath12 give rise to hyperplanes @xmath11 in @xmath10 , and several hyperplanes in @xmath6 may give rise to the same hyperplane in @xmath10 .",
    "+ there are two important special cases : + @xmath13 the case when @xmath8 is an intersection of some hyperplanes of @xmath6 , we call this _ parabolic restriction_. then @xmath10 is automatically again crystallographic . in fact , most finite weyl groupoids appear in this way , including examples which are not attained from nichols algebras over groups",
    ". + @xmath13 the case when @xmath8 is the fixpoint set of an automorphism @xmath14 of @xmath6 . in general , @xmath10 must not be crystallographic , but in several cases it is . in the special case where @xmath14 permutes a set of simple roots ( called _ permutation restriction _ ) , these restrictions describe the root system of the folded nichols algebra over the centrally extended group .",
    "+ in section [ sec_arrnich ] we turn our attention to weyl groupoids of nichols algebras .",
    "we start with a nichols algebra @xmath15 , which is typically diagonal .",
    "let @xmath16 be a subset of the simple roots for @xmath15 , denote by @xmath17 the corresponding sub - yetter - drinfeld module and consider the associated nichols algebra of coinvariants @xmath18 this is a nichols algebra in the category of @xmath19-yetter - drinfel s modules .",
    "the key result of this article in theorem is that the root system of @xmath20 is the parabolic restriction @xmath21 .",
    "moreover , @xmath19 ( determining the category ) corresponds precisely to the sub - arrangement of hyperplanes in @xmath6 that do not give rise to hyperplanes in @xmath10 , while the number of different hyperplanes in @xmath6 that give rise to the same hyperplane in @xmath10 , determines the dimensions of the yetter - drinfeld modules in the pbw - basis of @xmath20 .",
    "+ in section [ simpcomp_section ] we conclude by viewing the set of all parabolic restrictions of a nichols algebra as a simplicial complex . in this picture",
    ", the reflection operation for nichols algebras has a particularly nice interpretation in terms of restrictions and dualization .",
    "+ we now discuss _ applications _",
    ", most of which are new and interesting already for the case of a diagonal nichols algebra and even for the special case of a quantum group @xmath22 associated to a lie algebra @xmath23 : + as first result , we obtain nichols algebras with weyl groupoids , which were not attained from a previously known nichols algebra over a group : +       1 .",
    "there exist nichols algebras whose corresponding crystallographic arrangements are the sporadic arrangements of rank three labeled @xmath24 , although these nichols algebras do not exist over any finite group .",
    "since every crystallographic arrangement of rank greater than three is a restriction of a weyl arrangement , every crystallographic arrangement of rank greater than three is symmetry structure of some nichols algebra .",
    "let @xmath25 , which is a diagonal nichols algebra of dimension @xmath26 .",
    "we consider the parabolic restriction indicated in the diagram :        then the restriction of the weyl group arrangement @xmath27 with @xmath28 roots has a weyl groupoid of sporadic type @xmath29 and @xmath30 roots ( one of which is nonreduced ) , namely +    [ cols= \" < , < , < , < , < , < , < , < , < , < , < , < , < , < \" , ]      + this yields a nichols algebra @xmath20 of dimension @xmath31 over an object @xmath32 of rank @xmath33 and dimension @xmath34 in the braided category @xmath35 with @xmath36 , where @xmath19 is an ordinary borel part @xmath37 . +",
    "this root system is clearly not one of lie type .",
    "this means that reflections in the weyl groupoid connect the weyl chamber described above with other chambers corresponding possibly to different dynkin diagrams and non - isomorphic nichols algebras ( compare example ) .",
    "+ for the restriction these different choices arise from different parabolics @xmath38 of @xmath27 in the weyl group orbit of the choice @xmath39 above . to be more precise in our example :",
    "the sporadic weyl groupoid of rank three labeled @xmath29 has by @xcite table 1 altogether @xmath40 different different root sets .",
    "counting different multiplicities of the roots , the number of objects could a - priori multiply up to @xmath41 ( simply connected weyl groupoid ) .",
    "but in this example , there are @xmath40 parabolics @xmath42 restricting to no .  @xmath29 . ] chambers ( objects ) with the following dynkin diagrams ( see the figure below for the object change diagram ) : @xmath43 and the sporadic dynkin diagrams @xmath44 in @xcite .",
    "+ how do these different objects in the restriction arise , even though @xmath27 itself has only one type of chamber ?",
    "this is because the parabolic @xmath39 is not fixed by the weyl group of @xmath27 .",
    "for example , the reflections in @xmath27 on the leftmost nodes @xmath45 map @xmath39 above to the following @xmath38 . in the parabolic restriction",
    "this changes the object ( chamber ) above with dynkin diagram @xmath46 to a different object ( chamber ) with dynkin diagram @xmath47 .",
    "in particular the now simple root with multiplicity @xmath48 is the root @xmath49 above and the double edge arises from the root string @xmath50 .",
    "we finally present the full _ object change diagram _ of the sporadic weyl groupoid of rank three labeled @xmath29 .",
    "it shows cartan matrix and dynkin diagram in each object ( chamber ) and the edges are labeled by reflections on the @xmath51-th simple root ( simple roots in the standard ordering , differently from the ordering above ! ) .",
    "reflections not drawn map to the same object . the thick arrow shows the reflection of the @xmath39-restriction to the @xmath38-restriction discussed above .",
    "as in @xcite , to a crystallographic arrangement @xmath52 of rank @xmath53 we associate the _ simplicial complex _",
    "@xmath54 on @xmath9 whose @xmath55-cells are the chambers of @xmath6 intersected with the @xmath56-sphere .",
    "this complex @xmath57 is topologically isomorphic to a sphere .",
    "sometimes it will be convenient to add a single @xmath58-cell corresponding to the origin @xmath59 .",
    "we need the following facts ( see @xcite for proofs and more details ) :      a.   let @xmath60 be a chamber and @xmath61 be the associated set of simple roots . then the adjacent @xmath62 cells @xmath63 are in bijection with the subsets @xmath64 of order @xmath65 .",
    "moreover @xmath66 is of dimension @xmath67 .",
    "b.   let @xmath68 be chambers and let @xmath69 be the weyl groupoid element with @xmath70 .",
    "then the intersection @xmath71 is a common adjacent @xmath62-cell @xmath72 , @xmath69 is contained in the weyl groupoid of the localization @xmath73 , and @xmath74 .",
    "suppose we have a nichols algebra @xmath15 , for now in the braided category @xmath75 .",
    "we consider the crystallographic arrangement @xmath52 with roots @xmath76 labeled by objects @xmath77 from theorem .",
    "more precisely , the initial nichols algebra is @xmath78 associated to some chamber @xmath79 of @xmath6 and one set of positive simple roots @xmath80 such that @xmath81 , while the other chambers correspond to weyl equivalent nichols algebras @xmath82 .",
    "thus it would be better to think of @xmath52 being associated to the entire weyl equivalence class and a specific representing nichols algebra @xmath83 being associated to each @xmath55-cell @xmath79 .",
    "we now wish to associate nichols algebra data to all @xmath62-cells @xmath84 .    as in lemma , let @xmath84 be a @xmath62-cell , let @xmath85 the associated subspace of @xmath9 , let @xmath79 be any adjacent chamber with simple roots @xmath86 and @xmath87 .",
    "+ then we associate to the pair @xmath88 the braided category of the localized nichols algebra @xmath89 and the restricted nichols algebra in this category as in theorem @xmath90    the previous definition is _ independent _ of the chosen adjacient chamber @xmath79 in the following sense : let @xmath91 be chambers adjacent to @xmath84 , then by lemma b ) we have an element @xmath69 in the weyl groupoid of @xmath6 , which is contained in the localization to @xmath92 , such that @xmath93 and @xmath94 .",
    "thus @xmath95 and the nichols algebras @xmath96 are weyl equivalent . by @xcite thm .",
    "4.4 this implies there is a category isomorphism @xmath97 @xmath98 in particular , the vector space , the root system and dynkin diagram , and the vector space dimension of the nodes @xmath99 ( multiplicities ) are independent of @xmath79 ( in contrast to @xmath100 ) .",
    "the chambers @xmath101 are the @xmath55-cells .",
    "each corresponds to the empty subsets @xmath102 and is contained only in the chamber @xmath79 itself .",
    "it is hence decorated with the unique category @xmath103 and the following nichols algebra in this category : @xmath104 hence as expected we associate to each @xmath55-cell @xmath79 the nichols algebra @xmath78 in the base category @xmath105 .",
    "the center point @xmath106 is a @xmath58-cell adjacent to any chamber @xmath79 .",
    "it corresponds to the full set of simple roots depending on the chamber @xmath107 and is hence decorated with the equivalence class of categories @xmath108 and the following nichols algebras in each category : @xmath109 hence we associate to the @xmath58-cell in the center the trivial nichols algebras , i.e.  on unit objects in all braided categories @xmath110 over some weyl equivalence representative of the full nichols algebra @xmath78 .",
    "we also note that _ simple reflection _ can be visualized nicely from this picture : let @xmath91 be adjacent chambers , meaning @xmath111 is an @xmath112-cell , i.e.  in a unique hyperplane @xmath113 .",
    "then the reflection @xmath114 constitutes of the following steps :    * restriction to the hyperplane @xmath115 yields the restricted nichols algebra @xmath116 . *",
    "the orientation chance @xmath117 i.e.  @xmath118 is simply a dualization @xmath119 , yielding equivalent categories @xmath120 and especially as image of @xmath60 a nichols algebra @xmath121 .",
    "* now @xmath60 is the restriction of the reflected nichols algebra @xmath122 to the hyperplane @xmath123 and we may conversely obtain the reflected nichols algebra from @xmath60 by a radford biproduct .",
    "the following picture now shows the arrangement in perspective : it is basically a cuboctahedron ( an archimedian solid ) with @xmath5 equilateral triangles and @xmath128 squares , which has each square subdivided into @xmath48 right triangles ( by the three orthogonal planes @xmath129 ) .",
