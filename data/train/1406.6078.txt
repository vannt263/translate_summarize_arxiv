    "with the discovery of the higgs boson , the search for supersymmetric particles which stabilize its mass is expected to be a primary goal of the lhc experiments .",
    "extensive supersymmetric ( susy ) particle searches by the atlas and cms collaborations with data collected at 7 tev and 8 tev center of mass energies have not revealed any trace of susy .",
    "the resulting limits have constrained the masses of the susy partners of the strongly interacting particles , the gluino and the squarks , to be greater than about 1.4 tev and 1.1 tev respectively @xcite .",
    "this in turn has constrained specific versions of the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) , such as the constrained mssm ( cmssm ) . on the theoretical side , simplifying assumptions are often made for the form of the soft susy breaking lagrngian , as in the case of cmssm inspired by minimal supergravity @xcite , which are not fully justified on symmetry principles .",
    "in this paper we propose and develop a class of flavor symmetry  based minimal supersymmetric standard models , smssm for short , which on one hand is predictive , but on the other hand is somewhat less constrained compared to the widely studied cmssm .",
    "as we shall see , smssm has three more phenomenological parameters compared to cmssm .",
    "a large slice of parameter space of smssm remains unexplored experimentally , but much of this space is within reach of the lhc with the potential for discovering supersymmetry when it resumes its operation .",
    "we define smssm as the minimal supersymmetric standard model with the most general soft susy breaking lagrangian subject to the following two symmetry requirements .    1 .",
    "the parameters are compatible with a grand unified symmetry such as @xmath0 .",
    "2 .   a non - abelian flavor symmetry @xmath1 acts on the three families which help suppress excessive flavor changing neutral current processes ( fcnc ) mediated by the susy particles .",
    "the motivations for each of these requirement are outlined below .",
    "grand unification @xcite , which is well motivated on several grounds , is one of the primary drivers of supersymmetric theories , and is well supported by the observed merging of the three gauge couplings at an energy scale of @xmath13 gev when extrapolated from their measured low energy values with low energy supersymmetry . among grand",
    "unified symmetry groups @xmath0 @xcite is particularly attractive as it unifies all members of a family into a single 16-dimensional irreducible representation .",
    "it predicts the existence of one right - handed neutrino per family , and thus leads to small neutrino masses and mixings via the seesaw mechanism . from the point of view of soft susy breaking , compatibility with @xmath0 unified symmetry would considerably reduce the number of soft masses of squarks and sleptons , from fifteen in the case of standard model ( sm ) gauge symmetry ( corresponding to the fifteen chiral multiplets of the sm ) down to three .",
    "it would also provide a symmetry reason for the unification of gaugino masses , reducing the relevant parameters from three in the sm to one .",
    "while smssm is defined by requiring compatibility with @xmath0 , we do not attempt to construct here complete unified models based on @xmath0 which would invariably bring in some model - dependence related to grand unified symmetry breaking .",
    "if the grand unified symmetry is chosen to be @xmath14 , the soft susy breaking mass parameters will increase from three of @xmath0 to six , since each family of fermions and their superpartners is assigned to @xmath15 under @xmath14 . while the general smssm setup would allow for @xmath14 gut , here we focus on models compatible with @xmath0 gut , as they are more restrictive and provide a natural understanding of neutrino masses .",
    "the purpose of the non - abelian flavor symmetry @xmath1 , taken to be compatible with the gut symmetry , is to suppress flavor changing neutral currents without relying on ad hoc assumptions such as universality of squark ( or slepton ) masses at the gut scale .",
    "without such a symmetry , the fermion mass matrices will not align perfectly with the soft squared mass matrices of the corresponding susy partners .",
    "this would lead to excessive flavor changing neutral currents mediated by susy particles @xcite .",
    "for example , box diagrams involving the gluino and squarks would lead to @xmath16 mixing , @xmath17 mixing and @xmath18 mixing , while loop diagram involving gauginos and sleptons would lead to flavor changing decays such as @xmath19 . from the @xmath16 sector one obtains the following constraints @xcite : @xmath20 here @xmath21 is a flavor violating squark mass insertion parameter , for @xmath22 , with @xmath23 being the average mass of the relevant squarks @xmath24 and @xmath25 in this case ) . for this estimate",
    "the gluino mass was assumed to be equal to the average squark mass .",
    "now , the natural magnitude of the mixing parameters @xmath26 and @xmath27 , in the absence of additional symmetries , should be of order the cabibbo angle , @xmath28 .",
    "the constraints from eq .",
    "( [ limit ] ) strongly suggest that the squarks of the first two generations are highly degenerate  in the limit of exact degeneracy the mixing parameters @xmath26 etc would vanish .",
    "the needed degeneracy is provided in smssm by a non - abelian flavor symmetry @xmath1 under which the @xmath29 fields belong to a common multiplet .",
    "analogous limits from @xmath30 mixing are less severe , and are given by @xcite : @xmath31 note that the natural value of this mixing parameter , in the absence of other symmetries , is @xmath32 .",
    "the constraints from eq .",
    "( [ bfcnc ] ) are well within limits .",
    "@xmath33 mixing provides even weaker constraints .",
    "this suggests that under the non - abelian symmetry @xmath1 , only the first two families need to form a common multiplet in order to solve the susy flavor violation problem , while the third family could be a singlet . we shall thus consider a @xmath4 assignment of fermion fields under @xmath1 , as well as a @xmath5 assignment",
    "both cases will lead to the same low energy phenomenology , as we shall see .      as for the choice of the flavor symmetry @xmath1 , at first sight any symmetry group with doublet and/or triplet representations would appear to suffice .",
    "however , there are important restrictions on @xmath1 .",
    "ideally , any symmetry should be a local gauge symmetry .",
    "one is naturally led then to the gauge groups @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 which contain doublet and/or triplet representations .",
    "such gauge symmetries , however , potentially contain new sources of susy flavor violation , arising from the @xmath6-terms which split the masses of superparticles within a given @xmath1multiplet after susy breaking @xcite .",
    "we propose a simple solution to this @xmath6-term problem in @xmath2 flavor symmetric models , based on an interchange symmetry acting on the higgs doublet fields which break @xmath2 . in the case of @xmath3 models",
    ", it has been noted in ref .",
    "@xcite that the @xmath6-term problem can be controlled by breaking the symmetry with higgs triplets which acquire real vacuum expectation values .",
    "we develop this class of models further , and show that with a simple discrete symmetry , the offending @xmath6-terms can be suppressed completely .",
    "we have not found a simple solution to the @xmath6-term problem if the flavor symmetry is gauged @xmath36 .",
    "it should be noted that the low energy susy phenomenology is identical in the case of @xmath2 with a @xmath4 assignment of families , and in @xmath3 with a @xmath5 assignment .",
    "this occurs because the @xmath5 assignment practically breaks down to a @xmath4 assignment when generating the observed top quark mass .",
    "a variety of models based on flavor symmetries have been proposed to address the susy flavor problem in the literature @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , global @xmath34 and @xmath36 family symmetries were proposed .",
    "if the symmetry is global , one has to deal with the goldstone bosons associated with its spontaneous breaking .",
    "global symmetries are also susceptible to violations from quantum gravity . clearly , local gauge symmetries are preferable , in which case the @xmath6-term problem should be addressed",
    ". some exceptions to the @xmath6-term problem have been noted in ref .",
    "the smssm models proposed here are fully realistic models without the @xmath6-term problem or goldstone bosons , and are protected from flavor violation induced by quantum gravity effects .",
    "they also shed some light on the fermion mass hierarchy puzzle .",
    "an interesting alternative to local gauge symmetry is to identify @xmath1 with a non - abelian discrete symmetry with either @xmath4 representations or @xmath5 representations @xcite .",
    "with such a choice of @xmath1 there is no @xmath6-term problem at all .",
    "such non  abelian discrete symmetries have found application in understanding the various puzzles associated with the quark and lepton masses and mixing angles with or without supersymmetry @xcite .",
    "more recently , such symmetries have been used to understand the near tri ",
    "bimaximal neutrino mixing pattern @xcite .",
    "it would be desirable to find a symmetry that sheds light on the fermion mass and mixing puzzle , and at the same time solves the susy flavor problem .",
    "here we present explicit examples with the permutation group @xmath7 and the tetrahedral group @xmath8 .",
    "the group @xmath7 admits @xmath4 assignment of fermion families , while @xmath8 admits a @xmath5 assignment .",
    "we focus on these groups as they are the simplest discrete groups with doublet and triplet representations . a nontrivial task in building such models",
    "is to make sure that they do lead to realistic fermion masses and mixings , which would require a consistent symmetry breaking mechanism . in all our models",
    "we address this issue .",
    "as in the case of @xmath2 and @xmath3 , these discrete groups lead to the same low energy susy phenomenology parametrized by smssm .",
    "other non - abelian discrete groups such as @xmath37 and @xmath38 for integer values of @xmath39 would yield similar results .",
    "supersymmetric models face another problem , related to cp violation .",
    "there are new sources of cp violating phases , arising from the soft susy breaking sector .",
    "the new phases should be less than about ( @xmath40 ) , depending on the squark and slepton masses and the value of @xmath41 , to be consistent with electric dipole moment limits on the neutron and the electron @xcite .",
    "the kobayashi - maskawa ( km ) phase in the quark sector , on the other hand , is of order unity .",
    "this disparity defines the susy cp problem . in our models",
    ", we require spontaneous cp violation , in which case the soft parameters will all be real . in some cases , a phase alignment is observed in the yukawa matrix and the trilinear @xmath42-term matrix , which suppresses the cp phases sufficiently @xcite . even in cases where the phases in these two matrices do not align ,",
    "the susy phase problem is significantly ameliorated .",
    "an order one phase is induced in the quark mixing matrix , so that the success of the ckm paradigm is preserved .",
    "a simple way of introducing spontaneously induced phases into the quark mixing matrix is suggested , making use of a singlet scalar field which acquires a complex vacuum expectation value .",
    "the phenomenology of smssm assumes all soft parameters to be real , as in the case of most cmssm analyses .",
    "we perform a numerical analysis of the allowed susy parameter space of smssm .",
    "this parameter set is slightly larger ( by three ) than the four ( five if sgn(@xmath43 ) is counted ) parameters used in cmssm , but still quite restrictive .",
    "specifically , smssm is defined by the following parameter set : @xmath44 here @xmath45 is the common mass of the first two family sfermions , while @xmath46 is that of the third family sfermions .",
    "@xmath47 is the mass of the pseudoscalar higgs boson , and @xmath48 is the universal gaugino mass .",
    "recall that the cmssm is defined by the parameter set @xmath49 , which has three fewer parameters than the set of smssm .",
    "we delineate the parameter space of smssm that is compatible with radiative electroweak symmetry breaking , direct lhc search limits , @xmath9 physics constraints and relic abundance of dark matter .",
    "our analysis shows that all susy particle masses can be below about 3 tev , resulting in relatively mild fine - tuning .",
    "continued search for susy at the lhc should reveal almost every superpartner in smssm .",
    "smssm is a special case of phenomenological mssm ( pmssm ) @xcite which has been widely studied , but with additional symmetry restrictions .",
    "specifically , the subset of pmssm spectrum that is consistent with a grand unified symmetry such as @xmath0 will resemble the spectrum of smssm .",
    "the number of parameters in smssm ( seven ) is much smaller than the corresponding number in pmssm ( nineteen ) , which makes exploration of the full parameter space more manageable in smssm .",
    "minimal susy models allowing for non - universal higgs masses with @xmath50 have been studied under the acronym nuhm2 ( non - universal higgs masses  2 ) @xcite .",
    "these models would reduce to smssm , if the third family soft scalar mass at the gut scale is assumed to be different from that of the first two families .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we motivate and develop the smssm models .",
    "there we present uv complete theories based on @xmath2 and @xmath3 local gauge symmetries .",
    "a new solution to the @xmath6-term problem is proposed for the @xmath2 models .",
    "models based on @xmath3 are developed and shown to be consistent with flavor changing constraints .",
    "two models based on discrete non - abelian symmetries @xmath7 and @xmath8 are also presented . in all these models , a solution to the susy phase problem is noted , based on spontaneous cp violation leading to a complex ckm matrix . in section 3",
    "we explore the parameter space of smssm models , requiring consistency with direct search limits on susy particles , radiative electroweak symmetry breaking , @xmath9 physics and relic abundance of cold dark matter . in section 4",
    "we have our concluding remarks .",
    "the primary goal of smssm is to understand in a controlled fashion , based on underlying symmetries , the breaking of supersymmetry .",
    "the lagrangian of these models is the most general compatible with specified symmetries .",
    "such a setup is guaranteed to be stable against potential planck scale corrections in the khler potential as well as the superpotential , provided that the symmetries have a gauge origin .",
    "smssm requires two symmetries , as noted in the introduction .",
    "the first , grand unified symmetry , is very powerful in restricting the number of free parameters . for a variety of reasons",
    ", @xmath0 @xcite appears to us to be the gut of choice , owing to the essential requirement of the right - handed neutrino ( to complete the spinor multiplet of @xmath0 ) needed for the seesaw mechanism and possibly for leptogenesis . under @xmath0 ,",
    "the quarks and leptons of each family and their superpartners transform as @xmath51plets of which there are three copies .",
    "this gut symmetry imposes the restriction that the three gaugino masses should be unified , so long as @xmath0 gauge singlets drive supersymmetry breaking , which is what we assume .",
    "similarly , the soft susy breaking masses of all members of a @xmath51plet must be degenerate at the gut scale , owing to @xmath0 .",
    "note , however , that the soft masses of the higgs fields @xmath52 and @xmath53 are not required to be the same as that of the @xmath51plets , as @xmath54 and @xmath55 belong to @xmath56dimensional representations of @xmath0 .",
    "most realistic @xmath0 models also utilize @xmath51 and @xmath57plet higgs fields for symmetry breaking @xcite , which also contain @xmath54 and @xmath55like components so that the mssm fields @xmath54 and @xmath55 are partially in @xmath56 and partially in @xmath58 .",
    "thus the soft susy breaking masses of @xmath54 and @xmath55 are not required to be the same , as there is no reason for the soft masses of @xmath56plet and @xmath59plets to be the same , and the admixtures of these fields in the @xmath54 and @xmath55 sectors are in general unequal .",
    "note that these models do not require @xmath60 , owing to the admixture of @xmath51 in the light field @xmath55 of mssm @xcite .    while @xmath0 symmetry already constrains the susy breaking parameters significantly , it is not sufficient to suppress potentially large fcnc processes mediated by the susy particles .",
    "smssm overcomes this problem with a flavor symmetry @xmath1 .",
    "this flavor symmetry unifies the three @xmath51plets into either a @xmath4 pattern or a @xmath5 pattern .",
    "such a unification of families would make the soft masses of the first two families degenerate in the case of a @xmath4 pattern , and all three families degenerate in the case of a triplet pattern .",
    "it turns out that both cases would result in seven effective susy breaking parameters with the fcnc processes sufficiently under control .",
    "the symmetry group @xmath1 must have doublet or triplet representations . if @xmath1 is a local gauge symmetry , the choices are @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath61 .",
    "in @xmath2 and @xmath3 models the triangle gauge anomalies automatically vanish , but not in @xmath61 models .",
    "as we show below , there are simple solutions to the @xmath6-term problem in @xmath2 and @xmath3 models , but we have been unable to extend this to the case of @xmath61 .",
    "thus we focus on the former two gauge groups .",
    "we also develop models based on non - abelian discrete symmetries .",
    "the natural choices are @xmath7 , the permutation group of three letters , which admits a @xmath4 family assignment , and the tetrahedral group @xmath8 , which admits a @xmath5 family assignment .",
    "there are no @xmath6-terms in these cases , and thus no @xmath6-term problem . if such symmetries are discrete remnants of a true gauge symmetry quantum gravity corrections will not violate the symmetry .",
    "it should be noted that string compctification often provides discrete non - abelian symmetries such as @xmath7 , @xmath62 and @xmath8 , which are of the type smssm models would need .",
    "here we propose and develop a gauge model based on @xmath2 flavor symmetry acting on the three families of @xmath51 .",
    "( we shall use a compact notation using @xmath0 language , although such an underlying gut is not necessary for the discussions to be valid . ) the fermions and their superpartners are assigned to a @xmath4 representation under @xmath2 .",

    "the @xmath2 symmetry must be broken spontaneously in order to generate realistic quark and lepton masses .",
    "the symmetry breaking sector relevant at high energies , where we assume the flavor symmetry breaks spontaneously , consists of a pair of @xmath2 doublets denoted as @xmath67 and @xmath68 which are singlets of the standard model and @xmath0 .",
    "the superpotential involving these fields is given by @xmath69 here @xmath70 is a parameter with inverse dimension of mass , which can originate either from quantum gravity corrections proportional inversely to the planck mass , or by integrating out a @xmath71 gauge singlet field .",
    "it is possible to keep such a singlet field in the spectrum , which does not change our conclusions . denoting the doublet fields as @xmath72",

    "( [ d - term ] ) , so that even by choosing small values of @xmath85 the squark mass splitting will be of the same order as the squark mass itself .",
    "this is the @xmath6-term problem of gauged flavor symmetry , as this splitting would induce excessive flavor violation in conflict with the limits shown in eq .",
    "( [ limit ] ) .",
    "here we propose a simple solution to the @xmath6-term problem of @xmath2 models .",
    "if an interchange symmetry @xmath86 is imposed , then @xmath87 in eq . ( [ potsoft ] ) .",
    "( [ split ] ) would then imply that @xmath88 , and there is no @xmath6-term splitting problem .",
    "such an interchange symmetry is quite natural .",
    "in fact , the model under discussion is a gauged @xmath2 model with two flavors ( @xmath67 and @xmath68 ) .",
    "the anomaly free global symmetry of the model is @xmath34 , which rotates the two doublets .",
    "the interchange symmetry @xmath86 is a subgroup of this anomaly free global @xmath34 .",
    "no quantum corrections will spoil this symmetry .",
    "note that the higgs potential of eqs .",
    "( [ potf])-([potsoft ] ) and the gauge interactions respect this interchange symmetry .",
    "as we shall show below , realistic fermion masses can be generated consistent with this interchange symmetry .",
    "it is worthwhile to note that such an interchange symmetry is possible only because the doublet representation of @xmath2 is pseudoreal . @xmath67 and @xmath68 have identical gauge properties in @xmath2 . if the family gauge symmetry were @xmath61 with the higgs fields transforming as @xmath89 , such an interchange symmetry will not work in any simple way , as the @xmath5 of @xmath36 is distinct from the @xmath90 .",

    "the superpotential takes the form @xmath92 here @xmath93 stands for higher order terms suppressed by more powers of @xmath94 , which is presumable the planck scale , much larger than @xmath95 and @xmath81 .",
    "as emphasized earlier , it is not required that the @xmath0 gut symmetry is employed .",

    "there are some points between the just mentioned mass ranges of @xmath358 .",
    "a more exhaustive study can fill up this gap .",
    "but it is clear enough to see the presence of neutralino-@xmath356 coannihilation scenario in our studies . in the bottom right panel",
    "we see that we do not have neutralino - stop coannihilation solutions .",
    "this is because it usually requires large values of scalar masses ( @xmath359 3 tev ) .",
    "we can see in @xmath360 plane of figure  [ funda2 ] that even though for green points @xmath361 have relatively large values but the corresponding values for @xmath312 are below 1.5 tev .",
    "it is because of it we are not having cancellation between diagonal and off - diagonal terms in stop - mass matrix and we do not have light stop solutions .",

    "it is evident from this figure that our solutions avoid the limits we just have mentioned .",
    "here we see that the minimum value for gluino mass is about 1.8 tev for both green and magenta points , while for squark is about 1.6 tev in case of green points and 2.4 tev for magenta points .",
    "we also see that the maximum value for gluino mass is about 5.4 tev with corresponding squark mass of about 5.6 tev , while gluino and squarks masses may be as heavy as 6.2 tev if we do not insist on 2@xmath368 wmap9 bounds .",

    "the current upper bounds set by super - k @xcite ( blue dashed line ) and icecube deepcore ( black solid line ) are shown .",
    "future icecube deepcore bound is depicted as the black dashed line @xcite . here",
    "we notice that green solutions are below the current and future reaches of direct and indirect bounds . in the case of neutralino - nucleon spin - independent cross section",
    "our solutions have cross section in the range of @xmath369 to @xmath370 while for neutralino - nucleon spin dependent case green points have cross section between @xmath371 to @xmath372 .",
    "although our solutions have very small cross sections which are hard to probe with the dark matter experiments mentioned above , as stated earlier , our models can be tested in collider searches .    in table",
    "[ table2 ] , we list three benchmark points .",
    "all of these points satisfy the sparticle mass and @xmath9-physics and relic density bounds as described in section  [ constraintssection ] .",
    "point 1 shows an @xmath42-resonance solution .",
    "for this point , @xmath373 805 gev , @xmath363= 125 gev , @xmath374 2058 gev , first two family squarks are just under 2 tev while sleptons of first two families are less than 1 tev , lighter stop is the lightest color sparticle .",
    "points 2 displays a neutralino-@xmath356 coannihilation solution . in this example , @xmath375 413 gev , @xmath376 124 gev , gluino mass is @xmath377 2040 gev , squarks are about 2 tev , here too @xmath378 is the lightest colored particle , sleptons of third family are greater than 1 tev but less than 1.6 tev .",
    "an example of neutralino - stau coannihilation is shown in point 3 , where we have @xmath379 623 gev , @xmath380 125 gev , @xmath381 gev , first two families squarks are under 3 tev , like points 1 and 2 , here too , @xmath378 is the lightest colored sparticle , while the first two families sleptons are relatively light .",
    "let us make a comment here .",
    "it can be seen from table  [ table2 ] that the input values of points 1 and 2 are almost similar .",
    "it occurs because we have neutralino-@xmath356 coannihilation scenario ( around @xmath382 400 gev ) , where @xmath383 is also close to @xmath47 in mass , and @xmath47 satisfies roughly the @xmath42-resonance condition ( @xmath384 ) for points 1 and 2 .",
    "we have a similar situation for @xmath382 700 gev or so where @xmath383 is close in mass with @xmath354 .",
    "for example in point 3 , @xmath379 623 gev while @xmath375 718 gev .",
    "had we chosen a point from such a region , we would have had point 2 and point 3 similar .",
    "in this paper we have proposed and developed a class of supersymmetric models in which the susy breaking lagrangian takes the most general form consistent with two symmetry requirements .",
    "the first is compatibility with a grand unified symmetry such as @xmath0 , and the second is consistency with a non - abelian flavor symmetry @xmath1 .",
    "this symmetry is chosen so that flavor violation arising from susy particle exchange is sufficiently suppressed . a minimal class of models , termed smssm  for flavor symmetry - based minimal supersymmetric standard model ",
    "is constructed .",
    "we also investigated the phenomenology of smssm in some detail .",
    "we have constructed four explicit models which generate a common spectrum of susy particles at low energies .",
    "the first two are based on @xmath2 and @xmath3 local gauge symmetries with a @xmath4 and * 3 * family assignment respectively . in both cases",
    "we have found simple solutions to the @xmath6-term problem that can potentially induce large flavor violation . an interchange symmetry acting on the doublets of @xmath2 model",
    "sets the @xmath6-term to zero . in the @xmath3 model , an explicit potential",
    "is constructed that makes the @xmath6-term vanish by virtue of a @xmath142 symmetry acting on the scalar fields .",
    "we also present two models based on discrete non - abelian symmetries @xmath7 and @xmath8 with either a @xmath4 or a @xmath5 family assignment .",
    "these models , being discrete , do not have any issue with @xmath6-terms .",
    "we have analyzed in all models the symmetry breaking sector and ensured that realistic fermion masses are generated without inducing excessive susy flavor violation .",
    "our phenomenological analysis uses as input the seven parameters listed in eq .",
    "( [ para ] ) .",
    "this is slightly larger than the four parameter set of cmssm , but still small enough to carry out a detailed parameter scan .",
    "our results show that almost all susy particles can have masses below about 3 tev , consistent with radiative electroweak symmetry breaking and @xmath9-physics constraints .",
    "we also find solutions with the correct relic density of neutralino dark matter , although their direct detection would be difficult in dark matter experiments .",
    "when the lhc resumes operation , we are optimistic that it would discover supersymmetric particles with properties predicted by smssm .",
    "we have presented three benchmark points in table [ table2 ] , which also shows that the fine tuning needed in these models is relatively mild .",
