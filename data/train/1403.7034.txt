    "ultraluminous x - ray sources ( ulxs ) are off - nuclear point - like sources that have x - ray luminosities ( @xmath9 erg @xmath10 ) above the eddington limit of a 20@xmath11 black hole ( bh ) ( feng & soria 2011 ) . although the true nature of these objects is not clear , current models propose several alternatives to explain their high luminosities : it could either be due to the geometric beaming if ulxs are powered by an accreting stellar black hole ( king et al .",
    "2001 ) or the super - eddington fluxes originating from disks ( begelman 2002 ) .",
    "additionally , some ulxs could be powered by intermediate - mass black holes ( miller & colbert 2004 ) .",

    "in this work , we have presented the energy and power spectra of the ulx x-2 in ngc 4736 using archival _",

    "_ chandra _ observation of the source revealed a qpo with a centroid frequency of @xmath68 mhz ( with an integrated rms fractional variability of @xmath40 and @xmath41 ) while the _ xmm - newton _ observation showed a qpo at @xmath2 mhz ( with an integrated rms of @xmath29 and a @xmath69 ) .",
    "the two frequencies overlap within their error limits , thus these could be either slightly differing qpos or the same qpo from the system .",
    "it is consistent that the low frequency qpo has diminished in rms percent variability when the source changed to a higher luminosity state with the outer parts of the disk being more stable to variations .",
    "it is expected that in high states of bh lmxbs low frequency qpos are suppressed .",
    "the energy spectrum for the _ chandra _ observation shows a best fit with a power - law model ( @xmath47 @xmath49 ) .",
    "the _ xmm - newton _ spectrum is best fitted with a two - component model , the disk blackbody plus power - law ( @xmath48=0.7 kev , @xmath47 @xmath5 1.7 ) as published earlier by akyuz et al .",
    "our analysis showed that the source luminosity has changed by a factor @xmath520 times between two observations .",
    "there are also couple of transient ulxs that exhibits decrease in luminosity below the ulx regime : cxom31 j004253.1 + 411422 in m31 ( kaur et al .",
    "2012 ) , ulx in m83 ( soria et al .",
    "2012 ) , 1rxh j132519.8 - 430312 and cxou j132518.2 - 430304 in ngc 5128 ( burke et al .",
    "the level of change in luminosity of the source is not well - known since the source was observed only four times within eight years .",
    "its spectral shape has changed from a one - component model of a pl to a two - component model of pl+diskbb where the disk component contributed @xmath70 and the power - law component yielded the rest of the total flux .",
    "this indicates that x-2 may be in a spectral state analogous to the thermal state of galactic bh x - ray binaries ( remillard & mcclintock 2006 ) during the _ xmm - newton _ observation .",
    "the source has a steep pl photon index as calculated from the _ chandra _ observation with a lower luminosity than the thermal state .",
    "however , the steep power law state of galactic bh x - ray binaries is characterized by a relatively high luminosity with a pl component of @xmath71 ( remillard & mcclintock 2006 ) .",
    "the ulx x-2 exhibits opposite behaviour , however a similar unusual low / soft state has also been observed from ulx x-2 in ngc 1313 ( feng & kaaret 2006 ) .",
    "this unusual behaviour may arise from the lack of good statistics in the _ chandra _ data .",

    "they noticed that the source might be in the hard state instead of the steep power - law , if one takes into account the large uncertainty of pl photon index ( @xmath72 ) due to the poor quality of the data .",
    "the mass of the bh in ulx systems can be calculated using the relation m=@xmath73",
    "@xmath74 2190/@xmath75 @xmath11 ( van der klis 2006 ) .",
    "this is based on the assumption that the qpo frequencies are associated with the keplerian frequency at the innermost circular orbit around a schwarzschild bh .",
    "the formula yields a mass value of @xmath5 @xmath76 @xmath11 for x-2 , which is rather high for even an intermediate bh .",
    "another approach is to consider the inverse proportionality between the bh mass and the qpo frequencies , and how this scales over different systems .",
    "dewangan et al .",
    "( 2006a ) used this proportionality for ulx x-1 in m82 and found the mass of the bh to be in the range of ( 25@xmath7520)@xmath11 .",
    "we used the same scaling argument to approximate the mass of the bh in x-2 of ngc 4736 .",
    "we chose the ulx in ngc 628 for the scaling since the detected qpos have similar low frequencies and luminosities ( @xmath77 erg s@xmath78 , liu et al .",
    "2005 ) . also , this source is one of the ulx which have the lowest qpo frequency ever detected . using this scaling argument and assuming the mass ( @xmath79 @xmath11 ) and qpo frequencies ( @xmath80 hz ) of the ulx in ngc 628 ( liu et al . 2005 )",
    ", we estimated a bh mass of @xmath81 @xmath11 for the compact source in x-2 .",
    "however , we note that some ulxs have low luminosities and they were estimated to have stellar / massive - stellar ( @xmath82 ) bhs ( kaur et al . 2012 ; soria et al . 2012 ) .    on the other hand ,",
    "the possible mass for the compact object in x-2 can be estimated assuming the source emits at the eddington limit .",
    "the bh mass of @xmath83 @xmath5 10 @xmath11 is found by using the highest luminosity value ( @xmath51.7@xmath8410@xmath85 erg s@xmath78 ) with this assumption . also considering the dominant contribution from the disk and the disk component model parameter ,",
    "the inner disk radius can be derived as @xmath86 96@xmath87 km .",
    "then , an upper limit for the compact source mass is estimated as @xmath18 80 @xmath11 in x-2 using the inner disk radius ( makishima et al .",
    "2000 ) . considering this mass range of ( 10@xmath780 ) @xmath11 , the compact source in x-2 is probably a stellar mass bh ( @xmath88 ) or a massive - stellar bh ( @xmath89)(feng & soria 2011 ) .",
    "in addition , we have detected a long periodicity of @xmath4 hz ( @xmath55.4 hrs ) above 3 @xmath6 confidence level in the low state of the source .",
    "we speculate that this may be another low frequency qpo from the system that may possibly be consistent with an intermediate mass bh scenario owing to the plausible large size disk .",
    "in such a case , this may be the lowest qpo detected from a ulx .",
    "however , it is also possible that this is the orbital period of the underlying binary which , then , it will be more consistent with a stellar / massive - stellar size bh .",
    "we note that the source shows low and high states of luminosity and there is not enough data on the source to conclusively decide whether it belongs to xrb class or a ulx classification .",
    "we encourage further monitoring x - ray observations of x-2 in the nearby galaxy ngc 4736 to understand its true physical parameters and characteristics .",

    "<S> we report our findings on a new quasi - periodic oscillation ( qpo ) and a long period from the ultraluminous x - ray source ( ulx ) x-2 in nearby galaxy ngc 4736 based on the _ chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _ archival data . to examine the timing properties , power density spectra of the source </S>",
    "<S> have been obtained using fast fourier transform . </S>",
    "<S> also the spectral parameters of the source have been calculated by obtaining and fitting the energy spectra . </S>",
    "<S> power density spectrum of this source reveals a qpo peak at @xmath0 mhz with an fractional rms variability of @xmath1 using the _ chandra _ data ( in the year 2000-lower state of the source ) . </S>",
    "<S> the _ xmm - newton _ data analysis indicates a peak at @xmath2 mhz with a fractional rms variation of @xmath3 ( in the year 2006-higher state of the source ) . </S>",
    "<S> these recovered qpos overlap within errors and may be the same oscillation . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , we detect a long periodicity or a qpo in the _ chandra _ data of about @xmath4 hz ( @xmath5 5.4 hrs ) over 3 @xmath6 confidence level . if this is a qpo , it is the lowest qpo detected from a ulx . </S>",
    "<S> the mass of the compact object in ulx x-2 is estimated using the eddington luminosity and a disk blackbody model in the range ( 10@xmath780 ) m@xmath8 . </S>"
