    "in the recent years , communications over multiple - antenna fading channels has attracted the attention of many researchers .",
    "initially , the main interest has been on the point - to - point multiple - input multiple - output ( mimo ) communications @xcite . in @xcite and @xcite ,",
    "the authors have shown that the capacity of a mimo point - to - point channel increases linearly with the minimum number of the transmit and the receive antennas .",
    "more recently , new information theoretic results @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite have shown that in multiuser mimo systems , one can exploit most of the advantages of multiple - antenna systems .",
    "it has been shown that in a mimo broadcast system , the sum - capacity grows linearly with the minimum number of the transmit and receive antennas @xcite , @xcite , @xcite . to achieve the sum capacity , some information theoretic schemes , based on dirty - paper coding , are introduced .",
    "dirty - paper coding was originally proposed for the gaussian interference channel when the interfering signal is known at the transmitter @xcite .",
    "some methods , such as using nested lattices , are introduced as practical techniques to achieve the sum - capacity promised by the dirty - paper coding @xcite",
    ". however , these methods are not easy to implement .    as a simple precoding scheme for mimo broadcast systems ,",
    "the channel inversion technique ( or zero - forcing beamforming @xcite ) can be used at the transmitter to separate the data for different users . to improve the performance of the channel inversion technique , a zero - forcing approximation of the dirty paper coding ( based on qr decomposition ) is introduced in @xcite ( which can be seen as a scalar approximation of @xcite ) . however , both of these methods are vulnerable to the poor channel conditions , due to the occasional near - singularity of the channel matrix ( when the channel matrix has at least one small eigenvalue )",
    ". this drawback results in a poor performance in terms of the symbol - error - rate for the mentioned methods @xcite .    in @xcite ,",
    "the authors have introduced a _",
    "vector perturbation technique _ which has a good performance in terms of symbol error rate .",
    "nonetheless , this technique requires a lattice decoder which is an np - hard problem . to reduce the complexity of the lattice decoder , in @xcite , the authors have used lattice - basis reduction to approximate the closest lattice point ( using babai approximation ) .    in this paper",
    ", we present a transmission technique for the mimo broadcast channel based on the lattice - basis reduction .",
    "instead of approximating the closest lattice point in the perturbation problem , we use the lattice - basis reduction to reduce the average transmitted energy by reducing the second moment of the fundamental region generated by the lattice basis .",
    "this viewpoint helps us to : ( i ) achieve a better performance as compared to @xcite , ( ii ) expand the idea for the case of unequal - rate transmission , and ( iii ) obtain some analytic results for the asymptotic behavior ( snr@xmath1 ) of the symbol - error - rate for both the proposed technique and the perturbation technique of @xcite .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as the following : sections ii and iii briefly describe the system model and introduce the concept of lattice basis reduction . in section iv , the proposed method is described and in section v , the proposed approach is extended for the case of unequal - rate transmission . in section",
    "vi , we consider the asymptotic performance of the proposed method for high snr values , in terms of the probability of error . we define the precoding diversity and the outage probability for the case of fixed - rate users . it is shown that by using lattice basis reduction , we can achieve the maximum precoding diversity .",
    "for the proof , we use a bound on the orthogonal deficiency of an lll - reduced basis .",
    "also , an upper bound is given for the probability that the length of the shortest vector of a lattice ( generated by complex gaussian vectors ) is smaller than a given value .",
    "using this result , we also show that the perturbation technique achieves the maximum precoding diversity . in section vii ,",
    "some simulation results are presented .",
    "these results show that the proposed method offers almost the same performance as @xcite with a much smaller complexity .",
    "as compared to @xcite , the proposed method offers almost the same performance .",
    "however , by sending a very small amount of side information ( a few bits for one fading block ) , the modified proposed method offers a better performance with a similar complexity .",
    "finally , in section viii , some concluding remarks are presented .",
    "we consider a multiple - antenna broadcast system with @xmath2 transmit antennas and @xmath3 single - antenna users ( @xmath4 ) .",
    "consider @xmath5^{t } $ ] , @xmath6^{t } $ ] , @xmath7^{t } $ ] , and the @xmath8 matrix @xmath9 , respectively , as the received signal , the transmitted signal , the noise vector , and the channel matrix .",
    "the transmission over the channel can be formulated as , @xmath10    the channel is assumed to be raleigh , i.e. the elements of @xmath9 are i.i.d . with the zero - mean unit - variance complex gaussian distribution and",
    "the noise is i.i.d .",
    "additive gaussian .",
    "moreover , we have the energy constraint on the transmitted signal , @xmath11 .",
    "the energy of the additive noise is @xmath12 per antenna , i.e. @xmath13 . the signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) is defined as @xmath14 .    in a broadcast system",
    ", the receivers do not cooperate with each other ( they should decode their respective data , independently ) .",
    "the main strategy in dealing with this restriction is to apply an appropriate precoding scheme at the transmitter .",
    "the simplest method in this category is using the channel inversion technique at the transmitter to separate the data for different users : @xmath15 where @xmath16 , and @xmath17 is the hermitian of @xmath18 .",
    "moreover , @xmath19 is the transmitted signal before the normalization ( @xmath20 is the normalized transmitted signal ) , and @xmath21 is the data vector , i.e. @xmath22 is the data for the _ i_th user . for @xmath23 ( the number of transmit antennas and the number of users are equal ) ,",
    "the transmitted signal is @xmath24    the problem arises when @xmath9 is poorly conditioned and @xmath25 becomes very large , resulting in a high power consumption .",
    "this situation occurs when at least one of the singular values of @xmath9 is very small which results in vectors with large norms as the columns of @xmath26 .",
    "fortunately , most of the time ( especially for high snrs ) , we can combat the effect of a small singular value by changing the supporting region of the constellation which is the main motivation behind the current article .",
    "when the data of different users are selected from @xmath27 $ ] , the overall constellation can be seen as a set of lattice points . in this case ,",
    "lattice algorithms can be used to modify the constellation .",
    "especially , lattice - basis reduction is a natural solution for modifying the supporting region of the constellation .",
    "lattice structures have been frequently used in different communication applications such as quantization or decoding of mimo systems .",
    "a real ( or complex ) lattice @xmath28 is a discrete set of @xmath29-d vectors in the real euclidean space @xmath30 ( or the complex euclidean space @xmath31 ) that forms a group under ordinary vector addition .",
    "every lattice @xmath28 is generated by the integer linear combinations of some set of linearly independent vectors @xmath32 , where the integer @xmath33 , @xmath34 , is called the dimension of the lattice @xmath28 .",
    "the set of vectors @xmath35 is called a basis of @xmath28 , and the matrix @xmath36   $ ] , which has the basis vectors as its columns , is called the basis matrix ( or generator matrix ) of @xmath37 .",
    "the basis for representing a lattice is not unique .",
    "usually a basis consisting of relatively short and nearly orthogonal vectors is desirable .",
    "the procedure of finding such a basis for a lattice is called _ lattice basis reduction_. a popular criterion for lattice - basis reduction is to find a basis such that @xmath38 is minimized . because the volume of the lattice is @xmath39 . ]",
    "does not change with the change of basis , this problem is equivalent to minimizing the orthogonality defect which is defined as @xmath40    the problem of finding such a basis is np - hard @xcite .",
    "several distinct sub - optimal reductions have been studied in the literature , including those associated to the names minkowski , korkin - zolotarev , and more recently lenstra - lenstra and lovasz ( lll ) @xcite .",
    "an ordered basis @xmath41 is a _ minkowski - reduced basis _ @xcite if    * @xmath42 is the shortest nonzero vector in the lattice @xmath28 , and * for each @xmath43 , @xmath44 is the shortest nonzero vector in @xmath28 such that @xmath45 may be extended to a basis of @xmath28 .",
    "minkowski reduction can be seen as a greedy solution for the lattice - basis reduction problem . however , finding minkowski reduced basis is equivalent to finding the shortest vector in the lattice and this problem by itself is np - hard .",
    "thus , there is no polynomial time algorithm for this reduction method .    in @xcite , a reduction algorithm ( called _ lll algorithm _ )",
    "is introduced which uses the gram - schmidt orthogonalization and has a polynomial complexity and guarantees a bounded orthogonality defect . for any ordered basis of @xmath28 ,",
    "say @xmath46 , one can compute an ordered set of gram - schmidt vectors , @xmath47 , which are mutually orthogonal , using the following recursion :    @xmath48    where @xmath49 is the inner product .",
    "an ordered basis @xmath50 is an _ lll reduced basis _",
    "@xcite if ,    * @xmath51 for @xmath52 , and * @xmath53    where @xmath54 , and @xmath55 is the gram - schmidt orthogonalization of the ordered basis and @xmath56 for @xmath57 .",
    "it is shown that lll basis - reduction algorithm produces relatively short basis vectors with a polynomial - time computational complexity @xcite .",
    "the lll basis reduction has found extended applications in several contexts due to its polynomial - time complexity . in @xcite ,",
    "lll algorithm is generalized for euclidean rings ( including the ring of complex integers ) . in this paper , we will use the following important property of the complex lll reduction ( for @xmath58 ) :    [ see @xcite ] let @xmath59 be an @xmath60-dimensional complex lattice and @xmath61    $ ] be the lll reduced basis of @xmath37 . if @xmath62 is the orthogonality defect of @xmath63 , then , @xmath64",
    "assume that the data for different users , @xmath65 , is selected from the points of the integer lattice ( or from the half - integer grid @xcite ) .",
    "the data vector @xmath21 is a point in the cartesian product of these sub - constellations . as a result ,",
    "the overall receive constellation consists of the points from @xmath66 , bounded within a @xmath67-dimensional hypercube . at the transmitter side , when we use the channel inversion technique , the transmitted signal is a point inside a parallelotope whose edges are parallel to vectors , defined by the columns of @xmath68 .",
    "if the data is a point from the integer lattice @xmath69 , the transmitted signal is a point in the lattice generated by @xmath68 .",
    "when the squared norm of at least one of the columns of @xmath68 is too large , some of the constellation points require high energy for the transmission .",
    "we try to reduce the average transmitted energy , by replacing these points with some other points with smaller square norms .",
    "however , the lack of cooperation among the users imposes the restriction that the received signals should belong to the integer lattice @xmath69 ( to avoid the interference among the users ) .",
    "the core of the idea in this paper is based on using an appropriate supporting region for the transmitted signal set to minimize the average energy , without changing the underlying lattice .",
    "this is achieved through the lattice - basis reduction .",
    "when we use the continuous approximation ( which is appropriate for large constellations ) , the average energy of the transmitted signal is approximated by the second moment of the transmitted region @xcite .",
    "when we assume equal rates for the users , e.g. @xmath70 bits per user ( @xmath71 bits per dimension ) , the signal points ( at the receiver ) are inside a hypercube with an edge of length @xmath72 where @xmath73 therefore , the supporting region of the transmitted signal is the scaled version of the fundamental region of the lattice generated by @xmath74 ( corresponding to its basis ) with the scaling factor @xmath75 .",
    "note that by changing the basis for this lattice , we can change the corresponding fundamental region ( a parallelotope generated by the basis of the lattice and centered at the origin ) .",
    "the second moment of the resulting region is proportional to the sum of the squared norms of the basis vectors ( see appendix a ) .",
    "therefore , we should try to find a basis reduction method which minimizes the sum of the squared norms of the basis vectors .",
    "figure 1 shows the application of the lattice basis reduction in reducing the average energy by replacing the old basis with a new basis which has shorter vectors . in this figure , by changing the basis @xmath76 ( columns of @xmath74 ) to @xmath77 ( the reduced basis ) , the fundamental region @xmath78 , generated by the original basis , is replaced by @xmath79 , generated by the reduced basis .        among the known reduction algorithms , the minkowski reduction can be considered as an appropriate greedy algorithm for our problem .",
    "indeed , the minkowski algorithm is the successively optimum solution because in each step , it finds the shortest vector .",
    "however , the complexity of the minkowski reduction is equal to the complexity of the shortest - lattice - vector problem which is known to be np - hard @xcite",
    ". therefore , we use the lll reduction algorithm which is a suboptimum solution with a polynomial complexity .",
    "assume that @xmath80 is the lll - reduced basis for the lattice obtained by @xmath68 , where @xmath81 is an @xmath82 unimodular matrix ( both @xmath83 and @xmath84 have integer entries ) .",
    "we use @xmath85 as the transmitted signal where @xmath86 is the precoded data vector , @xmath87 is the original data vector , and @xmath88 is the length of the edges of the hypercube , defined by ( [ eq : ar ] ) . at the receiver side ,",
    "we use modulo operation to find the original data :    @xmath89    @xmath90    in obtaining ( [ eq:9 ] ) from ( [ eq:8 ] ) , we use the fact that @xmath91 and @xmath92 have integer entries .    in this method , at the beginning of each fading block , we reduce the lattice obtained by @xmath68 and during this block the transmitted signal is computed using ( [ eq : transmod ] ) . neglecting the preprocessing at the beginning of the block ( for lattice reduction ) , the complexity of the precoding is in the order of a matrix multiplication and a modulo operation . therefore , the complexity of the proposed precoding method is comparable to the complexity of the channel inversion method .",
    "however , as we will show by the simulation results , the performance of this method is significantly better , and indeed , is near the performance of the perturbation method , presented in @xcite .    in the perturbation technique @xcite ,",
    "the idea of changing the support region of the constellation has been implemented using a different approach . in @xcite , @xmath93 is used as the precoded data , where the integer vector @xmath94 is chosen to minimize @xmath95 .",
    "this problem is equivalent to the closest - lattice - point problem for the lattice generated by @xmath96 ( i.e. finding the lattice point which is closer to @xmath97 ) .",
    "therefore , in the perturbation technique , the support region of the constellation is a scaled version of the voronoi region @xcite of the lattice . in the proposed method",
    ", we use a parallelotope ( generated by the reduced basis of the lattice ) , instead of the voronoi region .",
    "although this approximation results in a larger second moment ( i.e. higher energy consumption ) , it enables us to use a simple precoding technique , instead of solving the closest - lattice - point problem .    for the lattice constellations , using a parallelotope instead of the voronoi region ( presented in this paper )",
    "is equivalent with using the babai approximation instead of the exact lattice decoding ( previously presented in @xcite ) .",
    "the only practical difference between our lattice - reduction - aided scheme and the scheme presented in @xcite is that we reduce @xmath26 , while in @xcite , @xmath98 is reduced .",
    "as can be observed in the simulation results ( figure 2 ) , this difference has no significant effect on the performance .",
    "however , the new viewpoint helps us in extending the proposed method for the case of variable - rate transmission and obtaining some analytical results for the asymptotic performance .",
    "the performance of the proposed lattice - reduction aided scheme can be improved by combining it with other schemes , such as regularization @xcite or the v - blast precoding @xcite , or by sending a very small amount of side information . in the rest of this section , we present two of these modifications .      in @xcite , the authors have proposed a regularization scheme to reduce the transmitted power , by avoiding the near - singularity of @xmath18 . in this method , instead of using @xmath99 , the transmitted vector is constructed as @xmath100 where @xmath101 is a positive number . to combine the regularized scheme with our lattice - reduction - aided scheme , we consider @xmath102 as the matrix corresponding to the reduced basis of the lattice generated by @xmath103 .",
    "when we use the regularization , the received signals of different users are not orthogonal anymore and the interference acts like extra noise .",
    "parameter @xmath104 should be optimized such that the ratio between the power of received signal and the power of the effective noise is minimized @xcite .      in practical systems ,",
    "we are interested in using a subset of points with odd coordinates from the integer lattice . in these cases",
    ", we can improve the performance of the proposed method by sending a very small amount of side information .",
    "when the data vector @xmath21 consists of odd integers , using the lattice - basis reduction may result in points with some even coordinates ( i.e. @xmath105 has some even elements ) , instead of points with all - odd coordinates in the new basis . for this case , in ( [ eq : transmod ] ) , the set of precoded data @xmath106 is not centered at the origin , hence the transmitted constellation ( which includes all the valid points @xmath107 ) is not centered at the origin . therefore , we can reduce the transmitted energy and improve the performance by shifting the center of the constellation to the origin .",
    "it can be shown that the translation vector is equal to @xmath108^{\\mathtt{t } } + [ 1+i , 1+i,\\cdots , 1+i]^{\\mathtt{t } } ) \\mod 2 $ ] where @xmath109 .",
    "when we use this shifted version of the constellation , we must send the translation vector to the users ( by sending 2 bits per user ) at the beginning of the block .",
    "however , compared to the size of the block of data , the overhead of these two bits is negligible .",
    "the above idea of using a shift vector can be also used to improve the perturbation technique ( if we only use the odd points of the lattice ) . after reducing the inverse of the channel matrix and obtaining the bits ( corresponding to the shift vector ) at the beginning of each fading block , the closest point to the signal computed in equation ( [ eq : transmod ] )",
    "can be found by using the sphere decoder .",
    "then , the transmitted signal is obtained by @xmath110 where @xmath111 is the zero - one shift vector , which is computed for users at the beginning of the fading block , and the perturbation vector @xmath112 is an even integer vector such that the vector @xmath113 has the minimum energy . this method which can be considered as _ modified perturbation method _ outperforms the perturbation method in @xcite .",
    "when we are not restricted to the odd lattice points , using ( [ eq : modpert ] ) instead of @xmath114 does not change the performance of the perturbation method .",
    "it only reduces the complexity of the lattice decoder @xcite .",
    "in the previous section , we had considered the case that the transmission rates for different users are equal . in some applications , we are interested in assigning different rates to different users",
    ". consider @xmath115 as the transmission rates for the users ( we consider them as even integer numbers ) .",
    "equation ( [ eq : transmod ] ) should be modified as @xmath116 where the entries of @xmath117^{t } $ ] are equal to @xmath118 also , at the receiver side , instead of ( [ eq:8 ] ) and ( [ eq:9 ] ) , we have @xmath119 @xmath120    if we are interested in sum - rate , instead of individual rates , we can improve the performance of the proposed method by assigning variable rates to different users .",
    "we assume that the sum - rate ( rather than the individual rates ) is fixed and we want to reduce the average transmitted energy . to simplify the analysis",
    ", we use the continuous approximation which has a good accuracy for high rates .    considering continuous approximation ,",
    "the sum - rate is proportional to the logarithm of the volume of the lattice with basis @xmath121 and the average energy is proportional to the second moment of the corresponding prallelotope , which is proportional to @xmath122 ( see appendix a ) .",
    "the goal is to minimize the average energy while the sum - rate is fixed .",
    "we can use another lattice generated by @xmath123 with the same volume , where its basis vectors are scaled versions of the vectors of the basis @xmath124 , according to different rates for different users .",
    "therefore , we can use @xmath125 instead of @xmath126 ( where @xmath127 is a unit determinant @xmath128 diagonal matrix which does not change the volume of the lattice ) . for a given reduced basis @xmath124 ,",
    "the product of the squared norms of the new basis vectors is constant : @xmath129    the average energy corresponding to the new lattice basis should be minimized .",
    "when we use the modified basis @xmath130 instead of @xmath131 , the average energy is proportional to @xmath132 ( see appendix a ) . according to the arithmetic - geometric mean inequality , @xmath132 is minimized iff @xmath133 therefore , @xmath134    having the matrix @xmath124 , the columns of matrix @xmath135 can be found using the equation ( [ eq : unequal ] ) and @xmath136 can be obtained by ( [ eq : unequal2 ] ) .",
    "now , for the selection of the reduced basis @xmath63 , we should find @xmath124 such that @xmath137 is minimized .",
    "because @xmath138 is given , the best basis reduction is the reduction which maximizes @xmath139 , or in other words , minimizes the orthogonality defect .    in practice , we use discrete values for the rate , and sometimes , we should assign the rate zero to some users ( when their channel is very bad ) . in this case , for the rate assignment for other users , we use the lattice reduction on the corresponding sublattice . it should be noted that the average transmit power is fixed per channel realization and no long - run averaging is considered , and no long - run power allocation is used .",
    "in this section , we consider the asymptotic behavior ( @xmath140 ) of the symbol error rate ( ser ) for the proposed method and the perturbation technique .",
    "we show that for both of these methods , the asymptotic slope of the ser curve is equal to the number of transmit antennas . by considering the outage probability of a fixed - rate mimo broadcast system",
    ", we will show that for the ser curve in high snr , the slope obtained by the proposed method has the largest achievable value .",
    "also , we analyze the asymptotic behavior of the outage probability for the case of fixed sum - rate . we show that in this case , the slope of the corresponding curve is equal to the product of the number of transmit antennas and the number of single - antenna users .",
    "when we have the channel - state information ( csi ) at the transmitter , without any assumption on the transmission rates , the outage probability is not meaningful .",
    "however , when we consider given rates @xmath141 for different users , we can define the outage probability @xmath142 as the probability that the point @xmath143 is outside the capacity region .    for a mimo broadcast system with",
    "@xmath144 transmit antennas , @xmath145 single - antenna receivers ( @xmath146 ) , and given rates @xmath141 ,    @xmath147    define @xmath148 as the probability that the capacity of the point - to - point system corresponding to the first user ( consisting of @xmath144 transmit antennas and one receive antenna with independent channel coefficients and csi at the transmitter ) is less than @xmath149 :    @xmath150    where @xmath151 is the vector defined by the first row of @xmath152 .",
    "note that the entries of @xmath151 have iid complex gaussian distribution with unit variance .",
    "thus , its square norm has a chi square distribution .",
    "we have , @xmath153 @xmath154    @xmath155    @xmath156    we are interested in the large values of @xmath157 . for @xmath158 ,    @xmath159    @xmath160    @xmath161    where @xmath162 is a constant number .",
    "now , @xmath163    @xmath164    @xmath165    @xmath166    @xmath167    according to the definition of @xmath168 , @xmath169 .",
    "therefore , @xmath170    we can define the diversity gain of a mimo broadcast constellation or its _ precoding diversity _ as @xmath171 where @xmath172 is the probability of error .",
    "similar to ( * ? ? ?",
    "* lemma 5 ) , we can bound the precoding diversity by @xmath173 . thus , based on theorem 2 , the maximum achievable diversity is @xmath144 .",
    "we show that the proposed method ( based on lattice - basis reduction ) achieves the maximum precoding diversity . to prove this , in lemma 1 and lemma 2",
    ", we relate the length of the largest vector of the reduced basis @xmath63 to @xmath174 ( the minimum distance of the lattice generated by @xmath17 ) . in lemma 3",
    ", we bound the probability that @xmath174 is too small .",
    "finally , in theorem 3 , we prove the main result by relating the minimum distance of the receive constellation to the length of the largest vector of the reduced basis @xmath63 , and combining the bounds on the probability that @xmath174 is too small , and the probability that the noise vector is too large .",
    "consider @xmath175 $ ] as an @xmath176 matrix , with the orthogonality defect @xmath177 , and @xmath178 $ ] as the inverse of its hermitian ( or its pseudo - inverse if @xmath179 ) .",
    "then , @xmath180 and @xmath181    consider @xmath182 as an arbitrary column of @xmath121 .",
    "the vector @xmath182 can be written as @xmath183 , where @xmath184 is orthogonal to @xmath185 for @xmath186 .",

    "therefore , @xmath202 now , @xmath203 and @xmath204 , both are orthogonal to the @xmath205-dimensional subspace generated by the vectors @xmath206 ( @xmath207 ) . thus , @xmath208 @xmath209 @xmath210 the above relation is valid for every @xmath211 , @xmath212 . without loss of generality , we can assume that @xmath213 : @xmath214 @xmath215 similarly , by using ( [ eq:15 ] ) , we can also obtain the following inequality : @xmath216    consider @xmath175 $ ] as an lll - reduced basis for the lattice generated by @xmath68 and @xmath217 as the minimum distance of the lattice generated by @xmath218 .",
