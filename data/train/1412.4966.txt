    "scientific consensus dictates that the x - ray spectra of black hole x - ray binaries ( xrbs ) and active galactic nuclei ( agns ) are modelled by three spectral components : a multicolour black body component representing the emission from the accretion disc in the soft x - rays , a power law with a cutoff or no cutoff representing the thermal / non - thermal comptonisation of soft photons from a population of hot electrons in the hard x - rays , and a reflection component representing the reprocessed emission of hard x - rays from the accretion disc , i.e. photoelectrically absorbed or compton - scattered emission , in the intermediate energies , that most prominently manifests itself in the form of an iron line .",
    "however , the magnitude of these components remains unknown at a given time .",
    "for example , the magnitude of the soft component in the hard state is usually difficult to determine .",
    "however , knowledge of the accretion disc geometry in the hard state , in particular the location of the inner edge of the accretion disc , is critical for the properties and/or the validity of all accretion disc models .",
    "it is especially important for radiatively inefficient models such as advection dominated accretion flow ( adaf , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the quiescent properties of black hole transients are often cited as evidence for adafs and black hole event horizons @xcite . however , for the adaf model to be relevant , the inner edge of the accretion disc must increase by orders of magnitude between the outburst and quiescent states .",
    "therefore , it is important to determine the magnitude of the accretion disc and reflection components in the hard state  a difficult task due to the low flux compared to the comptonisation component .",
    "in fact , even the physical mechanism for the x - ray emission in the hard state is open to question , with possible contributions from direct synchrotron emission from the jet @xcite or synchrotron self - compton radiation from the base of the jet @xcite .",
    "this kind of spectral degeneracy is especially true for the galactic xrbs and a striking example can be seen e.g. in @xcite , where three very different models are fitted equally well to the same data set of cyg x-1 , despite the excellent quality of the data that was obtained by all the x - ray satellites in orbit at the time .",
    "in addition , the magnitudes of different components in the intermediate x - ray states are difficult to determine as all the components are luminous",
    ". extra complications in the interpretation of x - ray spectra are caused by the attenuation of interstellar matter in galactic xrbs and the so - called warm absorbers ( possibly associated with the winds of the accretion discs ) in agns .",
    "thus , modelling the x - ray spectra of accreting black holes often leads to a problem of degeneracy , i.e. multiple distinct models fit the observed data equally well .",
    "even if an apparently good fit is obtained between the data and the model , it does not necessarily imply a match between theory and physical reality .    in this paper",
    "we demonstrate the use of linear unsupervised decomposition methods in separating a set of time series of x - ray spectra into subcomponents corresponding to distinct spectral components from the disc and the population of hot electrons . in section [ spectral_decomposition ]",
    "we will compare three different decomposition methods , namely principal component analysis ( pca ) , independent component analysis ( ica ) and non - negative matrix factorisation ( nmf ) , using simulated spectra mimicking the spectral behaviour from a typical xrb .",
    "this analysis provides a better estimate of the x - ray continuum models required to fit the x - ray spectra in xrbs by taking into account also the spectral variability in addition to the fitting of the time - averaged spectra . in section [ discussion ]",
    "we apply the nmf to a set of spectra from the stellar mass black hole xrb gx 3394 . with a sufficiently long set of observations throughout the hardness - intensity diagram ( hid ) from gx 339@xmath04 ,",
    "we study how spectral decomposition reveals the change of spectral components in the hid . in section [ conclusions ]",
    "we present the conclusions of this paper and make suggestions for the future use of the spectral decomposition methods in the context of xrbs .",
    "x - ray spectra can be decomposed via matrix factorisation techniques .",
    "generally , this problem falls into the category of blind source separation ( bss ) , in which a set of source signals is estimated from a set of mixed signals with no information on the source signals or the mixing process . in this case",
    "the data matrix is a collection of discrete x - ray spectra , @xmath1 , consisting of flux values with energy @xmath2 measured at time @xmath3 .",
    "this matrix is taken to consist of a mix of a few , up to @xmath4 , separate source signals @xmath5 weighted over the energy bands by a weight matrix @xmath6 .",
    "essentially , the columns of the weight matrix can be thought to represent a constant spectral component that has a variable amplitude dictated by the rows of the source signal matrix for each @xmath4 . in practice , @xmath4 is much smaller than @xmath3 or @xmath2 , as the intention is to describe the information in @xmath7 concisely . @xmath8 and",
    "@xmath9 are subsequently estimated in such a way that @xmath10 , i.e.    @xmath11    the bss problem is very underdetermined since multiple equally valid solutions exists . however , by placing clever requirements on the factorisation one can reduce the number of possible solutions and obtain meaningful results .",
    "pca , for example , assumes that the source signals are minimally correlated to each other and ica assumes that the source signals are maximally independent of each other . a slightly different approach is introduced in nmf which imposes structural constraints , i.e. the non - negativity of the constituent matrices @xmath8 and @xmath9 . in the following we create a simulated dataset that mimics the spectral effects that are present in the usual x - ray data of xrbs and tackle it using the methods outlined above .          in order to gauge the appropriateness of a decomposition method ( pca / ica / nmf ) we created a simulated dataset that mimics the spectral effects that are present in the usual x - ray data of xrbs : absorbed ( phabs ) disc black body spectra ( diskbb ) with changing normalisation and temperature values and cutoff power law spectra ( cutoffpl ) with changing normalisation , spectral index and cutoff values . for",
    "` spectral pathways ' we use distinguishable functions such as sine and saw waves .",
    "in addition , we vary the disc temperature and the power law index so as to produce soft and hard x - ray states .",
    "we use isis @xcite to fake 200 spectra with an exposure of 5 ks , varying the black body normalisation sinusoidally from 500 to 2500 , the black body temperature linearly from 0.3 kev to 1.3 kev and back , the power law normalisation as a saw wave from 1.0 to 2.0 , power law index linearly from 1.5 to 2.5 and back , and a power law cutoff sinusoidally from 40 kev to 120 kev ( fig .",
    "[ sim ] ) .",
    "we used the _ rxte _ response function from gx 3394 pointing 70110010400 and then unfolded the spectra using isis to flux units ( kev photons s@xmath12",
    "@xmath13 kev@xmath12 ) .",
    "we would like to note that by using `` flux - corrected '' spectra , response matrix features are introduced in addition to the physical processes , which could have an effect in the low flux regimes .",
    "as pca , ica and nmf are all methods that rely on _ linear _ decomposition , they are suited best for finding the variability of the normalisations of spectral components , and can behave erratically when dealing with more complicated effects such as changing optical depth and electron temperature that varies the cutoff and spectral slope of the x - ray spectra . when presented with data that varies non - linearly , linear methods can , however , be used as the non - linearity",
    "can be approximated as a collection of several linear components .",
    "thus , we do not expect the decomposition to return the variability of the parameters themselves , but rather the fluxes of the spectral components that are collectively produced by the varying parameters .",
    "the quality of the decomposition is then measured by how well they are able to reproduce the disc and power law fluxes . in the following",
    "we review the different spectral decomposition methods and how they are able to reproduce the original fluxes of the simulated spectral components .",

    "one of the drawbacks in using pca for decomposing spectra is its tendency to cancel components as it works with the mean - subtracted spectra .",
    "this results in components that have either too exaggerated or diminished an impact on the x - ray spectra depending on the values of their normalisation .",
    "additionally , if the eigenvectors of the principal components have both positive and negative values , it results in pivoting behaviour of the spectra , i.e. when the normalisation of that component increases it increases the impact of the component in the positive part and decreases the impact in the negative part of the eigenvector .",

    "here we use the pfld defined as the total flux , @xmath53 , as a function of @xmath54 , which equals to 1 when the total flux is composed only of power law flux , and 0 when the total flux is composed only of disk flux .    if we take the above results as portraying the actual disc and power law components we can form the disc and power law spectra as @xmath55 and @xmath56 respectively , and feed them into isis for spectral fitting .",
    "we use the original data errors for fitting both @xmath39 and @xmath40 spectra and do not add any systematic error to the spectra .",
    "the @xmath39 spectra were fit with a model phabs@xmath57diskbb using an energy range 315 kev , and @xmath40 with a model phabs@xmath57cutoffpl using an energy range 10140 kev , thus leaving out the iron line region for simplicity and to better concentrate on the power law continuum .",
    "[ fitfig ] shows the results of the modelling plotted on the pfld .",
    "this is done so as to show the evolution of the parameters rather than to provide hard values .",
    "as it is not clear how the data errors would be divided into the @xmath39 and @xmath40 components the resulting parameters have bigger errors than when fitted to the whole spectra .",
    "thus , the parameter values in this presentation are more robust when they are changing gradually , and likely does not represent the actual value when they are in a region where the parameter value changes abruptly across the whole parameter range ( i.e. a mix of colours in fig .",
    "[ fitfig ] ) .",
    "in addition , parameter values that have their error values equal to the minimum or maximum value allowed are removed .        from fig .",
    "[ fitfig ] we can see the following :    1 .   the power law normalisation increases with the overall luminosity and the power law index increases with the power law fraction , the exception being when the power law fraction is below 0.01 .",
    "the scatter in the lower part of the hard state appears to be due a changing value of the power law index from @xmath5811.5 .",
    "2 .   as the power law fraction starts to decrease in the hard state , the disc normalisation starts to increase .",
    "3 .   the cutoff energy decreases with the luminosity in the hard state . up to the critical luminosity ( as discussed above )",
    "the cutoff is over 100 kev , but starts to decrease after the critical luminosity down to @xmath583040 kev .",
    "the difference between the transition fluxes when transferring to the soft state seem to occur from a difference in the disc normalisation and power law normalisation ( an indication of a difference could be seen in the cutoff energy as well ) , while the disc temperature and power law index change in similar fashion for each transition .",
    "the disc gets hotter when transitioning to the soft state and there is an indication of heating up again when transitioning back to the hard state as well .",
    "6 .   in the soft state",
    "both the disc normalisation and temperature decrease slowly .",
    "these results correspond well to the ones found in previous studies ( e.g. in * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in addition , the nmf analysis is able to track the changes of the disc component in the low disc fraction regime . these correspond to the regions where the disc component is weak and",
    "not required statistically in the spectral fits that have been performed previously . however , it is possible that the low energy tail of the response matrices that arise from escape and fluorescence peaks is mimicking the disc component in the faint spectral states .",
    "but , these peaks are most likely caused by photons that come from the hard spectral component and thus have the same variability producing soft excess to the hard , and not to the soft , factorised component .",
    "this shows the strength of the nmf analysis in situations where the disc component is harder to detect by using only spectral fitting . while the fluxes of the disc and power law components can be distinguished fairly well in the nmf analysis ( fig .",
    "[ quality ] ) , one has to be careful with the values of spectral components in the low flux regimes as these are most likely degenerate ( see fig .",
    "[ plotparams ] and compare to fig .",
    "[ sim ] ) .",
    "as was found in previous studies , at the soft state the disc luminosity is driven by the @xmath59 -relation mimicking the emission from a black body with radius @xmath60 and temperature @xmath61 .",
    "it is usually assumed that the above relation is achieved when the inner disc is located at the innermost stable circular orbit ( isco ) , though multiple factors can affect this scaling ( see a more complete discussion on the difference between these factors in @xcite ) .",
    "[ lumtemp ] shows the luminosity - temperature diagram for a set of selected points with a best - fit line in black , and the whole pfld in the inset with the selected points in red .",
    "the best - fit line follows approximately the relation @xmath62 , which differs from the usual relationship .",
    "however , as the _ rxte _ is sensitive only for energies 3 kev and upwards , the missing softer x - ray flux , as well as the absorption , affect the luminosity - temperature diagram as discussed in @xcite ( where their original correlation was @xmath63 and corrected @xmath64 ) .",
    "here we are concerned with the disc - temperature scaling in the broad sense and assume that when taking into account properly the data below 3 kev and the effect of absorption the scaling should be close to @xmath65 . from fig .",
    "[ lumtemp ] it can be seen that _",
    "gx 3394 exhibits the disc - temperature relation in the disc component right after it starts the transition to the soft state _",
    ", i.e. the inner disc seems to be at the isco already in the beginning of the intermediate state right after the peak of the outburst .",
    "this relation breaks in the soft state when the power law fraction achieves values close to @xmath580.30.4 .    , which differs from the expected theoretical relation ( see text for possible reasons).,scaledwidth=50.0% ]",
    "in this paper we have demonstrated that unsupervised linear spectral decomposition methods can be used to follow the evolution of distinct spectral components .",
    "the non - linearities present in the original spectral components can be taken into account by adding multiple linear components together based on their weights across the spectral energies .",
    "these methods can resolve differently varying spectral components given that they present a measurable effect on the fluxes .",
    "of the three methods used to tackle a simulated data set we showed that the non - negative matrix factorisation performs best over principal component analysis and independent component analysis .",
    "the non - negative matrix factorisation also has the additional benefit that the resulting factorisations are always positive , thus the components of these factorisations can be used to fit spectral models separately . tracking the individual spectral parameter variations is not as robust compared to fluxes but they can be tracked reasonably well with good quality spectra and high flux values .",
    "this has the advantage over normal spectral fitting where different models fit the same spectra or a specific spectral component is not required statistically in the fits .",
    "we applied the non - negative matrix factorisation to a set of _ rxte _ spectra of the galactic black hole x - ray binary gx 3394 that includes four outbursts from the source .",
    "we found that five components are required to accurately represent the spectra , and that these can be divided into disc and power law components taking into account the iron line in the latter .",
    "fitting the factorised disc and power law components separately with an appropriate spectral model corroborates the notion that the inner edge of the disc is at the innermost stable circular orbit at the onset of the intermediate state following the peak of the outburst .",
    "however , this analysis should be refined by including data below the _ rxte _ soft x - ray limit .    in the future",
    "we envision that unsupervised linear spectral decomposition methods will be used in multiple situations involving the detection of separate spectral components . in order to extend these preliminary studies in detecting the accretion disc in the low disc flux states , as seen for example in the hard state , we would need to have access to both data from multiple sources and detectors more sensitive to the softer x - ray bands . in order to detect the spectral component responsible for the quasi - periodic oscillations in xrbs ,",
    "different timing scales could be tested .",
    "finally , these methods provide an alternative way of detecting the spectral components without performing actual spectral fitting , which might prove to be an invaluable tool when dealing with large datasets .",
