    "the spatial two - point correlation function , , is probably the most classical statistic used in cosmology for clustering analyses . since its early applications ( e.g. peebles 1980 ) , obtaining reliable estimates of on large ( @xmath22 ) scales became one of the main statistical motivations for enlarging the available 3d samples through new , wider and deeper redshift surveys .",
    "the principal reason for this is that on scales sufficiently large for the fluctuations to be still in the linear clustering regime , the _ shape _ of is expected to be preserved during gravitational clustering growth .",
    "comparison of observations with models is therefore simpler , because in this case the theoretical description of clustering does not require the full non - linear gravitational modelling , which is on the contrary necessary at small separations .",
    "if we are able to measure accurately [ or its fourier dual , the power spectrum p(k ) ] , on large enough scales , we shall have a measure of the distribution of the _ initial _ fluctuation amplitudes .",
    "in addition , if the initial density field was described by a gaussian statistics , this will be all the statistical information we need to completely characterise the initial field itself .",
    "one further reason for pushing measures of to larger and larger scales , is the possibility to correctly estimate its zero  point , i.e. the scale on which correlations become negative .",
    "this is a specific prediction of any viable model , as it reflects the turnover and peak scale in the power spectrum , fingerprint of the horizon size at the matter ",
    "radiation equivalence epoch .",
    "clearly , as much as the weakness of clustering in this regime is a benefit for the theory , it represents a hard challenge for the observations : statistical fluctuations destroy any possibility to detect significant features , such as the zero  point of , if the sample under study does not contain enough objects at comparable separations .    historically , following the pioneering works of the mid  seventies ( see rood 1988 for a review ) , the industry of redshift measurements exploded in the eighties , with the completion first of the cfa1 ( davis et al .",
    "1982 ) , then of the perseus - pisces ( giovanelli et al . 1986 ) and cfa2/ssrs2 ( geller & huchra 1989 ; da costa et al .",
    "1994 ) surveys .",
    "these first large surveys ( containing several @xmath23 redshifts ) , produced significant advances in the estimation of on small and intermediate scales ( e.g. davis & peebles 1983 , de lapparent et al .",
    "however , they also showed the existence of structures with dimensions comparable to their depth .",
    "this , while on one side giving rise to speculations about the very existence of a transition to homogeneity on large scales ( see guzzo 1997 for a recent review of this problem ) , explicitly indicated the need for larger redshift samples . in more recent years",
    ", there have been a few significant attempts to fulfil this need , as for example the surveys based on the iras source catalogues ( see e.g. strauss 1996 ) , the stromlo  apm survey ( loveday et al .",
    "1992b ) , and especially the las campanas redshift survey ( lcrs , shectman et al .",
    "our contribution along this direction has been the realization of the eso slice project ( esp ) galaxy redshift survey , that was completed between 1993 and 1996 ( vettolani 1997 , vettolani et al .",
    "1998 , v98 hereafter ) .",
    "the technical aims of the esp survey were to exploit on one side the availability of new deep photometric galaxy catalogues ( in our case the edsgc , @xcite ) , and on the other the multiplexing performances of fibre spectrographs , as in the specific case of the optopus fibre coupler available at eso ( avila et al .",
    "the main scientific goals were to estimate the galaxy luminosity function over a large and homogeneously selected sample with a large dynamic range in magnitudes ( see zucca et al .",
    "1997 , paper ii hereafter ) , and to measure the clustering of galaxies over a hopefully fair sample of the universe .",
    "the esp survey , during about 25 nights of observations , produced a @xmath24 complete sample of 3342 galaxies with reliable redshift .",
    "its combination of depth and angular extension is paralleled at present only by the las campanas redshift survey ( lcrs , shectman et al .",
    "1996 ) , which has the advantage of containing a larger number of redshifts . one main difference of the lcrs with respect to the esp , is that it is selected in the red , which makes comparison with the results presented here particularly interesting .",
    "one important advantage of the esp is that it is a purely magnitude  limited sample , which makes modelling of the selection function easier than in the case of the lcrs , where an additional surface  brightness selection was applied .    in this paper we shall discuss the two - point correlation properties of the esp survey , both in redshift and in real space .",
    "previous or parallel papers , in addition to that describing the above mentioned @xmath25band luminosity function ( zucca 1997 ) , deal with the scaling properties ( scaramella 1998 ) , the properties of groups ( ramella 1998 ) , and potential biases in the estimate of galaxy redshifts ( cappi 1998 ) . the survey in general is described in vettolani et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , while the redshift data catalogue is presented in v98 . here",
    "we also marginally discuss the small  scale galaxy dynamics , for its effects on redshift  space clustering .",
    "however , a proper discussion of the small  scale pairwise velocity dispersion and related topics , will be presented in a separate paper ( guzzo , in preparation ) .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section 2 briefly summarises the properties of the redshift catalogue .",
    "section 3 discusses the techniques used to estimate two  point correlations and their errors .",
    "sections 4 and 5 present the redshift and real  space correlation functions , discussing their dependence on luminosity and comparing results with other surveys . in section 6 possible biases deriving from the observational setup are investigated .",
    "the main results are summarised in section 7 .",
    "the esp redshift survey consists of a strip of sky @xmath26 thick ( declination ) by @xmath27 long ( right ascension ) near the south galactic pole , plus an additional strip of length @xmath28 situated five degrees to the west of the main strip . in total , this covers about 25 square degrees at a mean declination of @xmath29 between right ascensions @xmath30 and @xmath31 . the target galaxies were selected from the edinburgh ",
    "durham southern galaxy catalogue ( edsgc , heydon  dumbleton et al . 1989 ) , which is complete to @xmath32 . the angular correlation properties of this catalogue were studied in detail in collins et al .",
    "the limiting magnitude of the esp is @xmath33 , chosen in order to have the best match of the number of targets to the number of fibres in the field of the multi ",
    "object spectrograph optopus , mounted at the cassegrain focus of the eso 3.6  m telescope .",
    "more details on the observing strategy and the properties of the spectroscopic data are given in vettolani ( 1997 ) , and in v98 .",
    "the final galaxy redshift catalogue contains 3342 entries , and is 85% redshift  complete within the survey area . at its effective depth ( @xmath34 ) ,",
    "the transverse linear dimensions of the survey are @xmath35 by @xmath36 , while its volume is @xmath37 .",
    "as can be seen in v98 , the survey geometry is fairly complex , being composed by two rows of circular optopus fields , partly overlapping each other .",
    "this results in the presence of interstices in which galaxy redshifts were not measured , and which obviously have to be considered carefully in the analysis of clustering .",
    "also , the completeness of each optopus field is not strictly constant ( v98 ) .",
    "this will require a weight to be applied to each object , depending on its parent field ( see  [ sec - est ] ) .",
    "the median internal error on the redshift measurements is @xmath38 for absorption  line estimates , and @xmath39 for emission  line estimates ( v98 ) .    in figure  [ fig - cone ] we show a cone diagram of the galaxy distribution in the survey .",
    "one first qualitative remark to be made , in view of the use we shall do of the data in this paper , is that the visual impression from this figure suggests - contrary to more `` local '' surveys as , e.g. cfa2 , a typical size of structures which is smaller than the survey dimensions .",
    "this gives us hope that , possibly , clustering measures extracted from this survey would be sufficiently representative of the general properties of our universe . clearly , the volume covered by the esp is still small , due to its limited area coverage on the sky , yet the linear sampling of large - scale structures in two dimensions is unprecedented , and matched only by the even larger lcrs .",
    "preliminary to the analysis , we performed a series of necessary corrections to the raw data catalogue .",
    "we first applied k - corrections to the observed @xmath25 apparent magnitudes in the same way as discussed in detail in zucca ( 1997 ) .",
    "given the location of the esp area in the region of the south galactic pole , we did not apply any correction for galactic extinction to the observed magnitudes .",
    "observed heliocentric radial velocities were converted to the reference frame of the local group using the transformation of yahil ( 1977 ) .",
    "( we also checked that correcting velocities to the cmb reference frame does not produce any difference in the results ) .",
    "we then computed comoving , luminosity , and angular diameter distances for each galaxy , adopting a cosmological model with h@xmath40 h @xmath41 mpc@xmath42 , and q@xmath43 .",
    "the correlation analyses are first performed on the whole apparent  magnitude limited catalogue . to do this ,",
    "we apply the minimum variance technique ( see   [ sec - est ] ) , for which we use the survey selection function as computed in zucca ( 1997 ) .",
    "we also exclude from this analysis those galaxies lying outside of the range of comoving distances @xmath44 , to avoid using those regions of the sample where respectively either the survey volume or the selection function are dangerously small .",
    "the sample trimmed in this way contains 2850 galaxies , with a minimum luminosity corresponding to @xmath45 .",
    "using the whole magnitude - limited sample is an attempt to extract the maximum signal from the available data , but can have some drawbacks , as the contribution of galaxies with different luminosities is not homogeneous over the sampled scales .",
    "therefore , to evidence possible biases and study the general behaviour of clustering with luminosity , we also construct a set of volume  limited subsamples , defined in table 1 .",
    "each column lists , respectively , ( 1 ) absolute magnitude limit , ( 2 ) luminosity distance computed from the magnitude limit taking into account the k - correction , ( 3 ) corresponding comoving distance limit , ( 4 ) redshift limit , ( 5 ) lower cut in comoving distance , ( 6 ) effective volume of the sample between the two distance boundaries , ( 7 ) total number of galaxies . given the small thickness of the esp slice , the lower distance limits are a safeguard to exclude that part of the samples where galaxy density is potentially undersampled by bright galaxies , thus introducing shot noise . these low cut  off values have been computed as the distance within which , for that absolute magnitude limit , one expects less than 10 galaxies within the corresponding esp volume , on the basis of the esp luminosity function .",
    "the main analyses we shall discuss in the following are based on the first four samples in the table .",
    "these offer the best compromise between having enough volume sampled and a good statistics .",
    "however , we also select a more `` extreme '' sample with @xmath46 , which contains only 292 galaxies , to study in more detail the existence of luminosity segregation at high luminosities .",

    "the technical characteristics of the optopus fibre spectrograph used for the redshift survey , introduced a bias at small angular separations , due to the finite size of the fibre connectors .",
    "this forced a minimum separation of 25 arcsec , below which two objects could not be observed with the same plugged plate .",
    "galaxies which are closer on the sky , therefore , had to be observed in two different exposures of the same optopus field , to be able to collect a spectrum for both of them .",
    "for some of the survey fields ( the most crowded ) , these repeated observations were not possible . the consequence , explicitly shown in v98 arcsec , indicating that in addition to the mechanical limitation , there has also been some systematic tendency to avoid the very close pairs , when positioning the fibres during the observations .",
    "] , is that when plotting the distribution of separations on the sky between each galaxy and its nearest neighbour , this is significantly more skewed towards small separations for the objects without redshift , than for the total photometric parent sample .",
    "this could in principle introduce a bias into the correlation function estimate , and the consequences for and have therefore to be explored carefully .",
    "first , let us simply consider the fact that at the peak of the global redshift distribution function [ @xmath47 , around @xmath48 , the minimum fibre separation corresponds to less than @xmath49 .",
    "this should in principle affect directly only the first bin we used in our estimates of correlation functions : for @xmath50 much larger than the pair separation , i.e. the large scale bins , the proper pair count statistics should be guaranteed by the area - weighting scheme .    to test any residual effect directly , we have made a further , simple exercise .",
    "undoubtedly , the maximum bias on the correlation function occurs if all the missing objects do really lie at the same distance of their nearest neighbour .",
    "let us therefore make the extreme assumption that all the close angular pairs with one missing redshift are true physical pairs , i.e. that @xmath51 .",
    "this situation should at least bracket the maximum bias we can expect from the missing pairs . to reproduce this case in a realistic fashion",
    ", we have selected all objects without redshift that are closer than 50 arcsec to a companion with measured redshift @xmath52 .",
    "we have then assigned to each of these objects a fake redshift @xmath53 , where @xmath54 is a displacement extracted at random from a gaussian distribution with @xmath55 .",
    "can be taken as a fiducial value for the pairwise dispersion in the field , as shown by guzzo et al .",
    "( 1997 ) ; note that in reality the line  of  sight distribution of pairwise velocities is best fitted by an exponential function , rather than a gaussian .",
    "this would however simply increase the tails of the simulated displacements : by using a gaussian we are placing the pairs a bit closer on the average , and therefore testing the effect on in an even more strict way . ] through this procedure , the resulting sample with `` measured '' redshifts contains about 100 additional galaxies . on this sample we repeated our computation of and .",
    "the @xmath56weighted redshift ",
    "space correlation function is compared in figure  [ xis - test ] to that from the original sample . evidently , the addition of the nearby pairs has very little effect , indicating that the minimum  separation bias in the fibre positions has no consequences on our correlation estimates .",
    "analogously , we re  computed and obtained virtually no change in the best fitting parameters for .",
    "the main results obtained in this work , can be summarised as follows .    1 .",
    "the redshift - space correlation function for the whole magnitude - limited esp survey can be grossly described by a power law with @xmath4 between 3 and @xmath57 , where it smoothly breaks down , crossing the zero value between 60 and @xmath58 . however",
    ", if one considers the overall shape from 0.1 to @xmath59 , a power law is a poor description of the observed , and it is not very meaningful to arbitrarily select one range or the other for a formal fit . in particular , below @xmath60 , has a much shallower slope ( @xmath61 ) .",
    "this is shown to be mostly due to redshift - space depression by virialized structures , whose effect is enhanced by the @xmath3 optimal  weighting technique .",
    "comparison to the only other redshift survey which provides a combination of depth and angular coverage similar or superior to esp , i.e. the lcrs , shows a very good agreement above @xmath62 .",
    "minor differences are most easily explained in terms of the different selection procedures of the two galaxy samples .",
    "also comparison with a survey with very different geometry , depth and redshift sampling ( but with the same magnitude system ) , the stromlo ",
    "apm , shows a very similar behaviour for .",
    "the unanimity of these surveys with rather different geometries and selection criteria , shows that the shape and amplitude of clustering for @xmath63 optically  selected galaxies is now rather confidently established , at least between 1 and @xmath64 .",
    "3 .   comparison of these redshift ",
    "space correlation functions to the best available real  space correlation function from the apm survey , shows a negligible amplification from streaming motions , implying a low value for the parameter @xmath65 .",
    "4 .   computing from volume  limited subsamples of the esp , we find no significant luminosity segregation in redshift space up to limiting absolute magnitudes as bright as @xmath66 .",
    "we start seeing some effect only for a subsample with @xmath46 , for which the amplitude of increases by a factor @xmath67 on intermediate scales .",
    "this global behaviour in redshift space is in general agreement with what found by benoist et al .",
    "( 1996 ) on the ssrs2 .",
    "+ these results also evidence how the small  scale shape of as estimated using the @xmath56weighting technique is systematically flatter than that observed from any of the volume  limited samples , where no weighting is used .",
    "apparently , this is produced by enhanced weight put by the technique on pairs of galaxies with high relative velocity ( i.e. within nearby clusters ) , resulting in a high pairwise velocity dispersion and consequently in a stronger damping of below @xmath62 .",
    "although the effect is observed to be more severe in the case of the esp sample , probably because of its thin ",
    "slice geometry [ the lcrs below @xmath62 is closer to the volume  limited estimates ] , these differences underline the importance of comparing weighted and unweighted estimates . 5 .",
    "studying clustering in real space through and its projection , we can evidence a mild dependence on luminosity also for magnitudes fainter than @xmath68 .",
    "this effect is mostly confined to separations @xmath69 .",
    "the shape of the contours of also clearly shows how the small  scale pairwise velocity dispersion , and the corresponding distortions ( mostly produced within virialised structures ) , are increased in more luminous samples : more luminous galaxies inhabit preferentially high  density regions , where they consequently have to move faster with respect to each other .",
    "this is the specific reason why no evident dependence on luminosity is observed on small scales in redshift space , where the two effects cancel each other .",
    "one could speculate that this mild effect evidenced on small scales might be the product of dynamical evolution of galaxies within virialized regions , while that observed only for highly luminous galaxies on large scales , given the time scales implied , can only be produced _ ab initio _ in a biased process of galaxy formation .",
    "fitting for the whole magnitude ",
    "limited esp catalogue with a power ",
    "law , we obtain as best parameters @xmath70 mpc and @xmath11 .",
    "these amplitude and slope are slightly smaller than those from most other optical surveys , suggesting that late  type galaxies are probably slightly favoured by the esp selection , with respect to early types .",
