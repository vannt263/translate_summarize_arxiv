    "the clustering of matter in different physical conditions remains a topic of interest in modern science because of its importance for understanding the behavior of natural and artificial systems far from equilibrium @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the process of clustering typically develops in particle ensembles with long - range forces , such as gravity or electric interactions and it may lead to the formation of stable spatially inhomogeneous structures @xcite - @xcite .",
    "however , there is another possibility of structure formation in dissipative systems , and typical example of such systems is flow with some chemical reactions . in this paper",
    ", we are going to examine some special features of the nonlinear dynamics of such flows .",
    "the macroscopic dynamics of dissipative systems with chemical reactions is , as a rule , described by diffusion equations @xcite-@xcite .",
    "however , such description is valid only for the systems with microscopic flow - transfer near some equilibrium state . if it is not the case , and we wish to consider the flow far from equilibrium , such approach is inadequate since the dynamics can involve several time and space scales that usually differ by several orders of magnitude . as a result , a full nonlinear treatment on the basis of hydrodynamic equations with chemical sources will be required to investigate the evolution of such system .    here",
    "we consider a particularly simple form of nonlinear dynamics of dissipative , one - dimensional flow moving in an external field with model chemical terms .",
    "we present a class of exact solutions of the fully nonlinear hydrodynamic equations describing the flow with a chemical reaction which may be useful to define the direction of the real system behavior .",
    "based on this description , we compare the formation of density profile in the dissipative flows with a chemical reaction with the corresponding evolution in the flows without chemical reactions .",
    "we shall study the one - dimensional , time - dependent pattern for the infinite medium containing movable , particles of type @xmath0 and immobile particles of the @xmath1 type between which there is a chemical reaction leading to the formation of new immobile component @xmath2 . such situation can be realized when @xmath3 , where @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the mass of @xmath0 and @xmath1 particles , respectively .",
    "it is assumed that the movement of the component @xmath0 is caused by an external force ( for definiteness , let this be the gravitational field and all particles are the neutral ones ) and friction force ( stokes force ) only .",
    "the macroscopic model of these processes can be present in an uniform form as @xmath6 @xmath7 @xmath8 @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the velocity of the @xmath0 component , @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 is the density of the @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 components , respectively , @xmath14 is the collision frequency , @xmath15 is the acceleration of freedom fall ( note that the direction of the @xmath16 axis is assumed to coincide with the direction of the acceleration of freedom fall @xmath15 ) and @xmath17 is the rate of the chemical reaction in the system .",
    "the concrete form of @xmath17 is defined by the order of reaction with respect to the components @xmath0 and @xmath1 . here",
    "we take for consideration the reactions of first ( @xmath18 ) and second @xmath19 order only , and in this case we have @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the chemical reaction constant . for simplicity , here we neglect the dependence of the friction coefficient @xmath14 on the medium parameters , as well as the dependence of the reaction constants @xmath21 , setting @xmath21=const . and @xmath14=const .",
    "since these dependences are not important for our study of qualitative properties of the flow dynamics .",
    "in order to see how these factors manifest themselves in the system dynamics it is convenient to pass from the euler description of the original system ( [ 1_chem])-([2_chem ] ) to the lagrangian frame . according to the definition ( see , for example , @xcite ) @xmath22 where @xmath23 satisfies the initial condition @xmath24 and provides @xmath25 the temporal and spatial derivatives are transformed as @xmath26 with jacobian @xmath27 besides , the condition of sign conservation of @xmath28 eliminates singularities of the flow .    under the transformation ( [ 6_chem ] ) , the eq.([2_chem ] ) is reduced to @xmath29 where @xmath30 at the same time the continuity equations ( [ 1_chem ] ) is transformed into @xmath31 in such form this equation will be needed for the exposition in the next sections .",
    "following @xcite , we start from the flow with a chemical reaction of first order . in fact , if @xmath32=const . , then eq . ( [ 9_chem ] ) is the newton equation for a particle , moving under the influence of gravity and friction .",
    "such situation occurs when the chemical reaction is first order , i.e. @xmath18 .",
    "physically this means that the concentration of one component is excessive , for example , in our model @xmath33 . in this case the solution of eq .",
    "( [ 9_chem ] ) has the exact solution @xmath34 where @xmath35 is initial velocity and @xmath36 . with the help of the relation ( [ u_nature ] ) bearing in mind @xmath37",
    ", we may deduce the path of a fluid element @xmath38 from which we find @xmath39 finally , substitution of this relation and @xmath17 for @xmath18 into ( [ 14_chem ] ) leads to @xmath40 where @xmath41 .",
    "also , from relation @xmath42 taking in account ( [ 10_chem ] ) and ( [ j_chem ] ) we get @xmath43    as is seen from ( [ na_chem ] ) and ( [ u_chem ] ) , the chemical reaction affects the flow via the parameter @xmath32 .",
    "it is worth noting that in the limit @xmath44 the relations ( [ na_chem ] ) and ( [ u_chem ] ) pass to @xmath45 in absence of a chemical reaction ( @xmath46 ) and/or friction ( @xmath47 ) these relations describe the flow by inertia in collisionless neutral gas . when @xmath48 , it predicts a singular behavior for finite time .",
    "a discontinuous pattern is a well - known intrinsic feature of fluids especially in inviscid pressureless limit . as is seen from ( [ 12_chem ] ) , on times @xmath49 the motion of fluid elements occurs in a similar way .",
    "however , in our model of dissipative flow with chemical a reaction some new peculiarities appear . in the case when @xmath50 and @xmath51 the collapse condition is @xmath52 from which follows the collapse time @xmath53 if @xmath44 , this estimation transforms into @xmath54 for the eq .",
    "( [ 15b_chem ] ) .",
    "it is clear that @xmath55 for the dissipative flow with a chemical reaction is larger than the corresponding values for the collisionless flow .",
    "thus , the chemical reaction and the friction add some restriction on the parameters of the problem but do not limit the development of singularity in the system .",
    "the physically admissible parameters @xmath56 and @xmath32 are determined by the condition that the density should be positive for all time , i.e. the following inequality must be fulfilled @xmath57 it should be noted that in this simplest case the nonlinear dynamics for some initial conditions can lead to the formation of dynamical space structures @xcite in which the initial conditions play the role of a driving parameter precluding the formation of singularities but providing for the formation of transient dynamical structures .",
    "now we move on to a more realistic case of @xmath58 . for simplicity , in this section we shall restrict our consideration to the limit @xmath59 when we may use the relation ( [ j_chem ] ) for our estimations . the eq .",
    "( [ 14_chem ] ) then reduces to @xmath60 differentiating relation ( [ 18_chem ] ) with respect to @xmath61 and using ( [ 1a_chem ] ) , we get @xmath62 then eliminating @xmath12 from ( [ 19_chem ] ) with the help of ( [ 18_chem ] ) we obtain @xmath63 where we introduce @xmath64 it should be noted that in the framework of model worked out the eq . ( [ 20_chem ] ) is an exact equation , one that has been correct for any @xmath65 .",
    "now we have to define the initial conditions for eq .",
    "( [ 20_chem ] ) which follow from the initial conditions for @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath65 . without losing too much generality",
    ", we can set @xmath66 and @xmath67 so we have @xmath68 .",
    "proceeding from obvious relations @xmath69 where the overhead dot now denotes derivative with respect to @xmath61 , and eq .",
    "( [ 18_chem ] ) rewritten for @xmath70 in the form @xmath71",
    "we get @xmath72 thus , the eq .",
    "( [ 20_chem ] ) together with the initial conditions @xmath73 defines the evolution of the flow with a chemical reaction of second order .",
    "unfortunately , this equation can not be solved analytically but proceeding from a chaplygin comparison theorem for nonlinear differential equations @xcite we are able to obtain the apriori estimates for the solutions of problem ( [ 20_chem])-([22_chem ] ) . applying this theorem to our issue",
    ", the functions @xmath74 and @xmath75 satisfying the initial conditions ( [ 22_chem ] ) shall hold the relation @xmath76 in the interval @xmath77 if the following inequalities are fulfilled @xmath78 where @xmath79    as such functions we can take @xmath80 where @xmath81 is some unknown parameter to be determined . indeed , for @xmath82 we get @xmath83 which means that we can consider @xmath82 as a lower boundary of the exact solution for eq .",
    "( [ 20_chem ] ) .",
    "we now look for the parameter @xmath81 for which @xmath84 becomes an upper boundary of the exact solution eq .",
    "( [ 20_chem ] ) .",
    "substitution of @xmath84 into ( [ 23_chem ] ) yields @xmath85 if we set @xmath86 then the curve @xmath87 always is lower than the curve @xmath88 in the interval @xmath89 .",
    "moreover , it easy to see that @xmath90 in the interval @xmath91 . for @xmath92 the second term of ( [ 25_chem ] ) becomes a positive value and the condition @xmath93 always holds true if the parameter @xmath81 belongs to the interval defined by the relation ( [ 26_chem ] ) .",
    "it implies that the functions @xmath74 and @xmath75 have no peculiarities in the interval @xmath77 .",
    "then from the relation ( [ 21_chem ] ) it follows that in the present case there may be only one hydrodynamic peculiarity associated with @xmath94 which is similar to the situation occurring in flow with the reaction of first order .",
    "+   + as an illustration of exact dynamics of the flow for case @xmath58 , in fig.1 we present the numerical solution of ( [ 20_chem ] ) for @xmath95 , @xmath96 and @xmath97 .",
    "this solution exhibits regular behavior up to the moment of development of hydrodynamic collapse @xmath55 and the function @xmath98 holds negative in the interval @xmath99 .",
    "thus , this partial case indicates that our conclusion about character of @xmath98 remains valid and collapse can be caused only by the flow hydrodynamics .",
    "+   + in fig.2 we graph this exact solution with the lower @xmath82 and upper @xmath84 boundaries for small times .",
    "as is seen from these graphs , we have a good approximation of the exact solution near initial state but for large times the boundaries can point out some rough estimate of the exact solution .",
    "however , such method of estimates seems sufficient enough for the study of the effect of chemical reactions on the formation of singularities and the influence of initial conditions on the dynamics of the system worked out .",
    "in this paper we have focused on the influence of a chemical reaction on the dynamics of the dissipative , one - dimensional flow . in order to get a full analytical description",
    "we have considered the reaction of first and second orders .",
    "these reactions belong to the simplest type of possible reactions .",
    "however , the present results indicate that the same features can be observed in more complex systems .",
    "in particular , we have shown that the wave breaking may occur in the flow under analysis [ see eq .",
    "( [ 14_chem ] ) ] similarly to what happens in a collisionless flow [ see eq .",
    "( [ 15b_chem ] ) ] . in the present example",
    "the dissipative physical processes changed only the kind of singular dynamics but did not eliminate the phenomenon itself .",
    "it is important to stress that the above - described behavior can be observed only for the initial conditions and the parameters stated in eq .",
    "( [ 17_chem ] ) .",
    "however , in the present case the evolution of the resistive flow is not restricted by any physical mechanism , such as the pressure gradient , which is usually presumed to limit the growth of the density peak ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "such type of solution represents a collapse - like class of nonlinear solutions that may arise in different physical situations . in particular , the results describing the formation of time - dependent structures in dissipative flow may be of interest for some biophysical experiments in laboratory conditions @xcite and aerosol applications @xcite . besides , we believe that our present approach can be generalized , for instance , to an inhomogeneous , many - component fluid or plasma flows in gravitational or electrostatic fields @xcite .    it should thus be of interest to examine such flows in the cylindrical and spherical geometries , which have more natural rotational degrees of freedom ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "owing to different kinds of interactions which may exist in such multidimensional systems and due to a variety of their initial states , different modes of collective motion are possible @xcite-@xcite .",
    "therefore , in higher spatial dimensions , a large variety of nonlinear dynamical structures can be expected @xcite .",
    "however , one should be noted that depending on the ratio between nonlinearity and dispersion , one can expect the formation of hydrodynamic collapses or nonlinear wave structures ( see , for example , @xcite ) . in our case , the present results for reactions of first and second orders ( in the limit @xmath59 ) indicate that there is a relatively weak effect of chemical terms on the flow dynamics since the nonlinearity is too strong that the system experiences a collapse - like behavior for small times . proceeding from this point",
    "one may expect that singularities form cellular structures in multidimensional geometry . as a result ,",
    "the intensity of the chemical reactions strongly can increase at these points .",
    "such special features are expected to play an important role , in particular , for the understanding of basic properties of aerosol systems in various environments and laboratory conditions @xcite .",
    "but it is only our assumption or guess and no more . in order to show the realization of this hypothetical mechanism we should study the above - outlined script of dynamics for dissipative flows with a chemical reaction in multidimensional geometry .    99 levich v g 1977 _ physicochemical hydrodynamics _",
