    "today , the insecure exchange of confidential or personal data is one of the major challenges to be overcome . for this very reason , secure communication based on quantum key distribution , quantum communication protocols for sharing information over large distances , and novel sources of quantum correlated light",
    "have attracted our attention over the last years . beside the traditional communication link , employing optical fibers and repeaters , and due to recent experimental advances , free - space channels turned out to be a promising contender for the transmission of quantum light .",
    "implementations of such atmospheric quantum channels were firstly realized for horizontal ground - to - ground communication  @xcite . yet",
    ", recent experiments have also promoted the field of atmospheric ground - to - satellite quantum optics  @xcite .    in order to implement and optimize quantum communication in atmospheric links , it is crucial to study the influence of fluctuating losses on the quantum properties of radiation fields .",
    "such an analysis requires the understanding of two principal aspects .",
    "first , how atmospheric loss mechanisms work and how they alter the quantum state of light .",
    "second , how the quantum features of light vary under such disturbances and under which conditions quantumness might be preserved .",
    "on the one hand , a consistent quantum theory of atmospheric losses has been introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite . based on this theory ,",
    "different fluctuating - loss models have been introduced , for example , for weak turbulence , dominated by the effect of beam wandering  @xcite , as well as for weak - to - moderate and strong turbulence , governed by beam - shape deformation and beam - broadening  @xcite .",
    "those theoretical descriptions are in a good agreement with actual experimental data  @xcite .",
    "additionally , the techniques of balanced homodyne  @xcite and heterodyne  @xcite detection have been adapted for turbulent atmospheric channels by propagating the signal and the local oscillator in orthogonal polarization modes .",
    "this enables one to measure quantum light in such systems even in the presence of bright day light .    on the other hand , quantum effects after passing light through atmospheric channels have been profoundly examined  but only for a restricted class of scenarios .",
    "this includes successful studies of the violation of bell inequalities  @xcite , quantum teleportation  @xcite , squeezed light  @xcite , and entanglement of gaussian  @xcite and non - gaussian states  @xcite .",
    "still , much more research has to be done in order to get a deeper and more universal understanding of quantum states that are subjected to atmospheric fluctuations .",
    "we have taken one step in this direction with our recent treatment of bipartite gaussian entangled states for arbitrary fluctuating loss channels  @xcite . in particular , we introduced an input - output relation for the covariance matrix and the corresponding simon entanglement test  @xcite , which allowed us to determine for which states and under which atmospheric conditions gaussian entanglement can be preserved .    in this article , we perform a rigorous analysis of different quantum effects in the presence of a turbulent loss medium .",
    "this significantly extends our previous study to single and multimode nonclassicality as well as non - gaussian and multimode entanglement . for this purpose",
    ", we will employ criteria based on the matrices of moments .",
    "such criteria have been formulated as sufficient ones  @xcite and generalized later on to formulate complete tests  @xcite . for the case of nonclassicality",
    ", the negativity of the normally ordered matrix of moments indicates the quantum character of the corresponding state  @xcite . in a similar way one can identify bi- and multipartite entanglement in terms of the negativity of the partial transposition ( npt ) through the partially transposed matrix of moments  @xcite . by deriving input - output relations for those methods ,",
    "we obtain rather general criteria for nonclassicality and npt - entanglement under atmospheric conditions .",
    "thereby , we can formulate hierarchies of nonclassicality and entanglement conditions based on the minors of the resulting matrices of moments .",
    "furthermore , we introduce fluctuation parameters that quantify the influence of fluctuating losses . depending on those parameters , we investigate the survival of quantum effects in atmospheric links and",
    "explicitly derive conditions for the preservation of different quantum features .",
    "furthermore , we will propose a measurement strategy to describe how those desired turbulent moments can be inferred .",
    "the article is structured as follows . in sec .",
    "[ ch : moments ] , we derive general input - output relations for the single- and multimode matrices of moments for turbulent loss media .",
    "furthermore , fluctuation parameters are introduced .",
    "single - mode nonclassicality is studied in sec .",

    "general npt - entanglement conditions are examined in sec .",

    "in this section , we relate the moments of annihilation and creation operators after propagating in fluctuating - loss channels to the unperturbed ones by formulating general input - output relations for the single- and multimode case",
    ". in particular , we will formulate such relations for the matrices of moments , which eventually allows us to treat general non - gaussian quantum correlations of radiation fields . at the end of this section ,",
    "fluctuation parameters are introduced which will be used in the further course of the article .",
    "we start our analysis for a single mode which is described by the annihilation ( creation ) operator @xmath0 @xmath1 of the considered mode .",
    "normal - ordered moments of these operators transform as  @xcite @xmath2 where the expectation value @xmath3 denotes the moments at the output of the fluctuating - loss channel , @xmath4 is the real valued amplitude transmission coefficient of the fluctuating - loss channel .",
    "the moments @xmath5 , with @xmath6 , are given by @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the probability distribution of the transmission coefficient  @xcite , which accounts for the effects of turbulence in the propagation media and a finite receiver aperture .",
    "it has been shown that various atmospheric channels can be described by an appropriate @xmath9  @xcite .",
    "note that the deterministic loss case with a fixed transmission coefficient @xmath10 corresponds to @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the dirac delta distribution .",
    "let us consider a single - mode operator function @xmath13 with the use of this function , we can define the matrix of moments @xmath14 , which includes the fluctuating - loss effects , through @xmath15^\\dagger[\\hat a^{\\dagger r } \\hat a^s]\\rangle_{\\mathrm{out}}}_{=m_{(p , q),(r , s)}^{\\mathrm{out}}}.      \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the unperturbed matrix of moments at the input is denoted as @xmath16^\\dagger[\\hat a^{\\dagger r } \\hat a^s]\\rangle$ ] .",
    "in order to determine the elements of the matrix of moments @xmath14 at the output of the turbulent channel , we have to determine how they scale with the moments of the fluctuating loss .",
    "therefore , we bring them in the normal - ordered form first , which allows us to apply eq .  , and then we infer the scaling with the moments of the transmission coefficient . to obtain the input - output relation , we reorganize the moments back into their original ordering . for doing so",
    ", we use the transformations @xmath17    applying those steps , we finally obtain the input - output relation @xmath18 this represents the general input - output relation for the single - mode matrix of moments .",
    "it is important to notice that the elements of the output matrix of moments are given by a mixture of lower order input elements which are scaled by different moments of the transmission coefficient , cf .",
    ". based on this relation , we will be able to formulate single - mode noncassicality tests under general atmospheric turbulence conditions .",
    "now we will formulate input - output relations for multipartite cases .",
    "therefore , we consider a multimode operator function @xmath19 here we use the @xmath20-dimensional multi - index notation . that includes the definitions @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",

    ", the transformations   can be extended to the multipartite scenario .",
    "then , in its most general form , the output expression for the multipartite matrix of moments reads as @xmath25 where the functions @xmath26 and @xmath27 act element - wise on vectors and @xmath28 .",

    "the channels might be totally correlated , which means @xmath30 , @xmath31 , and @xmath32 .",
    "an example of such a correlated scenario might be different optical modes co - propagating through the same atmospheric channel within its correlation time  @xcite .",
    "the other extreme is a totally uncorrelated channel .",
    "that is , @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "this is usually the case when the different optical modes propagate in different spatial directions through the atmosphere . as eq .",
    "does not make any restrictions to the particular turbulence of the atmosphere , it also describes , e.g. , partly correlated channels . in the following , we will also study those different cases as this may significantly influence the nonclassical properties of the output fields . based on the input - output relation",
    ", we will be able to analyze quantum properties of multipartite radiation fields evolving in fluctuating - loss channels .",
    "before we study different nonclassical effects in fluctuating - loss scenarios , we define different correlation parameters @xmath35 for the considered loss scenarios .",
    "such quantities will serve as a measure for the turbulence strength , especially , when one uses criteria based on @xmath36 minors of the matrix of moments . in the single mode case",
    ", the fluctuation parameter @xmath35 can be defined as @xmath37 with @xmath38 .",
    "@xmath39 is the ratio between the @xmath40-th order variance @xmath41 and the moment @xmath42 .",
    "hence , it is a measure for the influence of the turbulence , i.e. , how much @xmath43 and @xmath42 differ from each other .",
    "it is easy to see that @xmath44 $ ] . in the absence of turbulence , @xmath45",
    ", @xmath39 is zero .",
    "therefore , the fluctuation effects are related to a nonzero value of @xmath39 .",
    "we have : the broader the distribution @xmath9 the higher the fluctuating - loss effects  i.e . , @xmath39 increases , which may also lead to a stronger impact on the nonclassicality of light .",
    "as we will also discuss multimode matrices of moments and their application in sections  [ ch : multi - mode - nc ] and  [ ch : multimode ] , we will generalize the fluctuation parameters .",
    "therefore , we will again use the multi - index notation as introduced above .",
    "moreover , a multi - index @xmath46 may be split into two parts , @xmath47 and @xmath48 , such that its elements are disjointly distributed in @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "we define @xmath51 the subscript indicates the two partitions @xmath47 and @xmath48 into which the @xmath52-th moments can be separated . for example , let us consider a bipartite case where the modes are labeled by 1 and 2",
    ". in this case , there are two possible correlation parameters : @xmath53 for @xmath54 and @xmath55 or @xmath56 for @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",
    "the multimode @xmath35 differs form the single - mode one in this additional feature .",
    "let us now study nonclassical effects in fluctuating - loss channels for a single mode .",
    "therefore , we consider the normal - ordered expectation value of the operator function in eq .  .",
    "it can be given in terms of the glauber - sudarshan @xmath59 function  @xcite @xmath60 if the @xmath59 function fails to be interpreted as a probability distribution , the corresponding quantum state is considered to be nonclassical in the sense that it can not be interpreted as a classical statistical mixture of coherent states .",
    "this implies that the expectation value   is non - negative for any classical state .",
    "hence , @xmath61 directly indicates the nonclassicality of the considered quantum state  @xcite .",
    "the expectation value   can be related to the matrix of moments @xmath62 with @xmath63    note that we use the notation @xmath64 for the normally ordered matrix of moments in order to distinguish it from the non - normally - ordered matrix of moments  . in ref .",
    "@xcite , it has been shown that a quantum state is nonclassical if and only if its normally order matrix of moments is not positive semidefinite .",
    "in particular , this implies that if one of the principle minors of @xmath64 is negative , the nonclassical character of the corresponding radiation field is verified .",
    "the output matrix of moments is given by    @xmath65    due to the normally ordered form of the nonclassicality condition , each element of @xmath64 transforms as given in eq .  , which can be directly applied without any reordering of the moments .",
    "it is important to observe that the scaling of the different elements of @xmath66 by different moments of the transmission coefficient leads to a distinct and nontrivial dependency on the fluctuation parameters .",
    "however , due to the normally ordered form [ cf .",
    "eq  ] , the output is not a mixture of the input elements , as it occurs in the general ( non - normally - ordered ) case eq .  .",
    "therefore , it is of great interest to study under which conditions the corresponding nonclassicality test is still sensitive to quantum features .",
    "note that any constant loss , except for full loss @xmath67 , will always preserve the nonclassical features of any quantum state . in the following",
    ", we will examine the influence of fluctuating loss on two particular nonclassicality condition .",
    "we first examine the notion of sub - poissionian light , for the first experimental verification , see  @xcite .",
    "this form of nonclassicality is based on the photon number distribution of the considered light field .",
    "note that sub - poissionian light in atmospheric channels has also been studied in ref .",
    "if a quantum state shows a photon number distribution which is narrower than a poissionian distribution , i.e. , in which the photon number variance is less than the mean photon number ,",
    "it is called sub - poissonian . this effect can be identified by the so - called mandel @xmath68 parameter  @xcite , @xmath69 that is , the sub - poissionian character is then indicated by @xmath68 being negative , which implies that the numerator in eq .",
    "has to be negative .",
    "this can be equivalently expressed by a negative sub - determinant , @xmath70 including bosonic operators up to the fourth order .",
    "let us now consider the output condition after passing through a fluctuating - loss channel .",
    "it can be formulated via the corresponding minor of the output matrix   @xmath71 ,      \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath72 as defined in eq .  .",
    "let us recall that for @xmath73 there are no fluctuations of losses , and the larger @xmath72 the stronger is the influence of these fluctuations . from eq .",
    "we directly see that an increase of the mean photon number or @xmath72 may lead to a disappearance of the sub - poissonian character , which is due to the positive part added to @xmath74 .",
    "in other words , the output nonclassicality condition from the minor   is @xmath75 , which is more restrictive than the input bound @xmath76 .",
    "hence , high mean photon numbers are hindering the preservation of sub - poissonian light in atmospheric channels .",
    "let us consider the example of @xmath77-photon fock states @xmath78 .",
    "for this case , we readily get that @xmath79 , with @xmath80 and the output version reads as @xmath81 .",
    "\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this yields the following direct relation between photon number and the fluctuation parameter : @xmath82 for exhibiting a sub - poissonian character after propagation through a fluctuating - loss channel ( @xmath83 ) .",
    "especially , the stronger the fluctuating losses ( the larger @xmath72 ) the smaller the photon number @xmath77 can be in order to identify its sub - poissionian statistics .      as a second example , let us now study the nonclassical feature of @xmath40-th power amplitude squeezing in turbulent loss scenarios , which is a generalization of the ordinary notion of squeezing  @xcite .",

    "note that the determinant of the matrix @xmath92 is itself the matrix in the input condition @xmath93 [ cf .",

    "this is an important finding as such an effect does not occur in deterministic loss scenarios .",
    "additionally this gives rise to a state optimization for the nonclassicality transfer in atmospheric channels .",
    "a similar dependency for two - mode gaussian entanglement in atmospheric channels has been reported in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "now we consider the simplest case @xmath84 which is the prominent case of quadrature squeezing , as there occur already interesting phenomena .",

    "figure  [ fig : tmsv ] shows that the negativity of the nonclassicality condition   depends in a nontrivial form on the choice of @xmath101 and @xmath104 .",
    "hence , for the transfer of squeezing through a free - space link , it is possible to find optimal displacement directions in order to preserve the squeezing . in particular , zero displacement will always conserve squeezing as then the term proportional to @xmath39 in eq .",

    "now we will expand the treatment of nonclassical moments including the impact of fluctuating loss to the multipartite case .",

    "the output normally ordered multimode matrix of moments is given by @xmath115 similar to the single - mode case , different elements of @xmath114 are scaled by different moments of transmission coefficients which introduces the fluctuation effects .",
    "one should bear in mind that in the multipartite case different transmission coefficients are associated to each mode , cf . also eq .   and the text below it , which results in different scenarios such as correlated and uncorrelated losses .",

    "this kind of non - gaussian state belongs to the family of so - called entangled coherent states  @xcite which have been experimentally realized ; see , e.g. ,  @xcite .",
    "the state satisfies the entanglement condition  , as @xmath171 , which is negative for all @xmath172 .",
    "hence , the entanglement of the state can only be detected by higher - order criteria , which means it exhibits a form of genuinely non - gaussian entanglement  @xcite . to examine the state after passing a turbulent loss medium , the corresponding test",
    "can be written as @xmath173 , with @xmath174 .",
    "\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] again , the perturbing effect on the entanglement depends on the fluctuation parameter @xmath175 .",
    "an interesting question is how robust non - gaussian entanglement is against fluctuating losses compared to gaussian one . in fig .",
    "[ fig : nongauss ] , the entanglement of a gaussian two - mode squeezed - vacuum state ( @xmath176db squeezing ) is compared with the non - gaussian state   with @xmath177 . in order to assure the comparability , both states are chosen to have the same total photon number @xmath178 , as we already discovered that the photon number is crucial for the transfer of nonclassical states through fluctuating - loss channels . to test for the entanglement of the two - mode squeezed - vacuum state",
    ", we use the output version of the simon criterion as derived in  @xcite , cf . also eq .",
    "( [ eq : ior_simon ] ) . from fig .  [ fig : nongauss ] , we conclude that the non - gaussian entanglement is preserved for a larger range of fluctuating - loss , quantified by @xmath175 , compared to the entanglement of the gaussian state . thus , higher - order entanglement might be more robust under fluctuating losses than gaussian entanglement .",
    "therefore , quantum communication or teleportation that employ non - gaussian correlations might be favorable for implementations in free - space channels .",
    "eq .  ] for the entangled coherent states   with @xmath177 ( solid line ) and the gaussian entanglement condition @xmath179 [ cf .",
    "eq .  ] of a @xmath176db squeezed two - mode squeezed - vacuum state ( dashed line ) are plotted as a function of the fluctuation parameter @xmath175 .",
    "the fluctuating loss is considered as uncorrelated , with the parameters @xmath180 and @xmath181 .",
    "both states have the same mean photon number . ]      after studying bipartite non - gaussian entanglement in turbulent atmospheric channels , now we also consider multimode entanglement under such conditions . therefore and as a proof of principle ,",
    "we analyze a four - mode scenario , where each mode is represented by the operator @xmath182 with @xmath183 . as entanglement tests we will use the partial transpositions of the multimode matrix of moments  . in particular ,",
    "we apply the partial transpositions to the four - mode @xmath184 minors @xmath185 , @xmath186 , and @xmath187 , where @xmath188 is given by @xmath189 as the @xmath20 modes can be separated in @xmath149 different nontrivial bipartitions , we have to consider in our case seven different entanglement conditions .",
    "these conditions are given by the negativity of @xmath190 , @xmath191 , @xmath192 , @xmath193 , @xmath194 , @xmath195 , and @xmath196 , where the superscript denotes in which partition the transposition is carried out .",
    "now we will introduce the corresponding conditions after passing through a fluctuating - loss channel .",
    "hence , we firstly formulate the output form of @xmath188 , @xmath197 ,      \\end{aligned }      \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath198 defined in eq .  .",
    "as demonstrated in our previous analysis , here we also observe that the turbulence adds a positive term to the entanglement test . due to the turbulence",
    ", one may not be able to prove entanglement with this test anymore .",
    "it is worth mentioning that , for the structure of @xmath199 , it is not important in which modes the fluctuating losses occur , it is just important that there is a fluctuating loss in at least one mode .",
    "however , for the special case that all modes undergo a correlated loss , that is @xmath200 and @xmath201 , we see that the output is simply scaled as @xmath202 .",
    "this means that correlated loss can not affect the sign of the partial transposition of @xmath199 and , hence , entanglement will be preserved .",
    "we already observed a similar behavior for two - mode nonclassical correlations ; cf .",
    "[ ch : multi - mode - nc ] . in the present scenario ,",
    "one may also artificially correlate the modes via the protocol introduced in  @xcite , in order to preserve the non - gaussian entanglement .",
    "let us now study the behavior of the test including the contributions of the atmosphere [ cf .",
    "eq .  ] for a particular state and under realistic conditions .",
    "we consider a state of the form @xmath203 with @xmath204 in our case , a proper normalization constant @xmath205 , and the definition @xmath206 .",
    "such a state is a continuous variable version of the w state . a way of implementing such a state was recently proposed in  @xcite",
    "for this particular state , the seven different partially transposed minors reduce to only the two following forms  @xcite : @xmath207 and @xmath208 .",
    "the same holds for @xmath209 .",
    "while for @xmath210 the entanglement between one mode and the rest of the modes is considered , @xmath211 corresponds to an equal - sized partitioning .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : multimode ] , the entanglement tests for the undisturbed input and the attenuated output test are plotted as a function of the coherent amplitude @xmath212 of the state  .",
    "we consider equal but uncorrelated losses in each mode . as in sec .",
    "[ ch : multi - mode - nc ] , we apply the beam - wandering - model  @xcite .",
    "the first conclusion that can be obtained from fig .",
    "[ fig : multimode ] is that turbulence reduces the range of the coherent amplitude for which we can still detect entanglement .",
    "this is consistent with the results obtained above for other quantum effects  that is , states with higher mean photon numbers are more fragile to fluctuating losses .",
    "second , we observe that @xmath213 is more robust against the fluctuating losses than @xmath214 . hence , the entanglement between a symmetric splitting of the modes , probed by @xmath213 , is more robust then the entanglement between one mode and the other three , which are tested by @xmath214",
    ". therefore , our analysis can determine which kind of entanglement is more stable and , hence , preferable in atmospheric links .",
    "the possibility to assess multimode quantum correlations under such fluctuating losses is an important tool to design and develop free - space quantum networks .     and",
    "@xmath215 and their output versions @xmath216 and @xmath217 for the state   are displayed as a function of the coherent amplitude @xmath212 . @xmath214 and @xmath213 are scaled by a factor of @xmath218 .",
    "the fluctuating losses are uncorrelated , with @xmath219 , @xmath220 for @xmath183 and @xmath221 . ]",
    "in the previous parts of this article , we focused on nonclassicality and entanglement criteria based on the matrix of moments for quantum states that are subjected to attenuations in atmospheric fluctuating - loss channels .",
    "such criteria are only of practical interest if one has measurement principles at hand to determine the corresponding moments . in this section",
    ", we briefly outline a measurement strategy to experimentally access the desired quantities .",
    "in particular , this approach will be based on the method of homodyne correlation measurements  @xcite and it will make use of a local oscillator ( lo ) field which co - propagates with the signal field through the loss channel  @xcite . for simplicity , we will focus on a single - mode detection scheme , which , however , can be straightforwardly extended to the multimode cases  @xcite .    to ensure a proper performance of the measurement ,",
    "a good interference of lo and signal is crucial .",
    "therefore , the lo is propagating with the signal field in the same spatial mode but in an orthogonal polarization mode . as the depolarization effects of the atmosphere are negligibly small  @xcite , both fields , lo and signal , experience the same atmospheric disturbances .",
    "hence , the atmospheric attenuation of the spatial mode profiles are equal for both modes , which leads to an optimal interference of lo and signal field .",
    "furthermore , the lo acts as a spatial and spectral filter , which even allows for daylight operation of the proposed scheme .",
    "note that by measuring the intensity of the lo , one can directly monitor the channel loss .",
    "this enables one to apply post - selection  @xcite or to correlate two ore more channel - transmissions  @xcite .    after we briefly discussed how the signal and lo can be propagated through the atmosphere",
    ", we now focus on the actual measurement technique .",
    "in particular , we will show how the moments @xmath222 of the signal field including channel loss can be measured with the device shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : md ] .",
    "the setup consists of @xmath223 beam splitters and photodetectors . at the first beam splitter",
    ", the signal is superimposed with the lo which is prepared in a coherent state @xmath224 with @xmath225 .",
    "subsequently , the outputs of this first beam splitter are further equally split .",
    "the resulting beams are measured with @xmath226 photodetectors , where @xmath227 is depth of the measurement device ; cf .",
    "fig  [ fig : md ] .",
    "this allows us to measure moments with @xmath228  @xcite .",
    "photodetectors , where @xmath227 is the depth of the setup . ]    as an example , we focus on the case @xmath229 for which we have four different detection modes which are described by the operators @xmath230 , and @xmath231 . in this scenario ,",
    "higher - order correlations can be detected , for example , by measuring @xmath232 with @xmath233 . by a fourier transformation with respect to @xmath234",
    ", one can retrieve moments such as @xmath235 . in this way , we directly obtain the output moments after the transmission through the atmosphere , which constitute the output matrix of moments . in a similar way ,",
    "all moments @xmath222 can be obtained by such a balanced homodyne correlation measurement .",
    "as already mentioned , the extension to multimode moments and more details on this treatment can be found in ref .",
    "therefore , the layout in fig .",
    "[ fig : md ] can be used to measure the moments of single- and multi - mode matrices of moments .",
    "in summary , we have studied moment - based nonclassicality and entanglement criteria in the presence of fluctuating losses .",
    "we introduced general input - output relations for the single- and multi - mode matrix of moments .",
    "in contrast to deterministic losses , the output matrices show a nontrivial dependency on fluctuation parameters . particularly , different orders of moments scale with different moments of the transmission coefficients .",
    "additionally , the turbulence can lead to a mixing of different moments .",
    "both effects may diminish the quantumness of the radiation field .",
    "we also introduced correlation parameters , which quantify the strength of fluctuating losses .    based on general input - output relations , we studied the corresponding nonclassicality conditions in terms of normally order moments . for the single mode case",
    ", we could identify that the mean photon number of the quantum state in atmospheric channels can be a crucial parameter .",
    "more precisely , states with lower mean photon numbers turn out to be more robust against fluctuating losses . we could observe the same behavior also for multimode nonclassicality and entanglement , which indicates the general character of this effect .",
    "another effect is the dependency of the nonclassicality on the coherent displacement of the considered quantum state .",
    "we have shown that , for a displaced squeezed state , the nonclassicality transfer in free - space links strictly depends on the direction of the displacement .",
    "this allows one to optimize the state in such scenarios . in the case of multimode nonclassicality",
    ", we could show that correlated attenuations can preserve nonclassical correlations .",
    "thus , artificially correlating the losses of different modes , as proposed in  @xcite , can also lead to a preservation of general quantum correlations .",
    "besides the nonclassical properties of radiation fields , we also examined entanglement conditions based on the negativity of the partial transposition of the output state of turbulent loss channels .",
    "we studied nontrivial scenarios of non - gaussian and multimode entanglement .",
    "we were able to show that bipartite non - gaussian entanglement can be more robust against fluctuating losses than gaussian entanglement .",
    "therefore , quantum communication strategies in free - space based on non - gaussian entanglement might be advantageous compared with others based on gaussian entanglement .",
    "furthermore , we demonstrated the feasibility of verifying multimode entanglement with criteria based on the matrix of moments at the receivers .",
    "finally , we proposed how one can actually measure the moments needed for the various criteria .",
    "for this purpose , we adapted the method of balanced homodyne correlation measurement to the atmospheric scenarios .",
