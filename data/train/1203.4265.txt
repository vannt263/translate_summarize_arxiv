    "collimated outflows in the form of jets are ubiquitous , from agn jets driven by accretion of material by supermassive black holes in galactic centres to those associated with stellar sources such as x - ray binaries and galactic microquasars",
    ". a particularly exciting view of the fundamental physics of jet sources is offered by gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) , which form the extreme end of the energy- and lorentz factor parameter space . since the discovery of afterglows in 1997 ( @xcite ) we have a broad picture of the origin and cause of grbs : through a catastrophic event ( in the case of long - duration grbs",
    "this is the core - collapse of a massive star ) , a jet of highly relativistic material is ejected . in the standard fireball model ( e.g. mszros & rees 1997 ) , the resulting broadband emission detected from x - ray energies through to radio waves - the so - called afterglow - is explained by the relativistic ejecta colliding with the surrounding circumburst medium .",
    "the afterglow radiation we detect is consistent with a synchrotron emission ( e.g. mszros & rees 1992 , 1997 ; wijers & galama 1999 ) , characterised by a series of smoothly connected power laws , with characteristic break frequencies and fluxes .",
    "the macroscopic properties of shocks are largely understood , and the dynamics of the shock created when the relativistic jet hits the circumstellar matter can be written down in terms of the explosion energy , the density ( and density gradient ) of the medium into which the shock ploughs , and the composition of the shocked material . however",
    ", oustanding questions remain on the nature of the _ _ micro__physics : how are the relativistic particles that radiate the observed emission accelerated ? where does the magnetic field in the shocked region come from and what is its structure ?",
    "since its launch in 2004 , the _ swift _ satellite ( @xcite ) has provided us with hundreds of well sampled x - ray and uv / optical afterglow light curves from seconds to months after burst ( see for a review @xcite ) .",
    "these light curves revealed complexity that was unexpected from pre-_swift _ light curves ( @xcite ) ; the standard fireball model has received a growing number of modifications , and the concept of a canonical light curve was introduced to explain the steep fades , plateau phases and multiple breaks in _ swift _ x - ray light curves ( @xcite ) . in particular , discrepancies between x - ray and optical light curves of grb afterglows and the rich array of light curve morphology including extended plateaux , rebrightenings and flares challenge existing grb models ( see for a review @xcite ) .",
    "explanations for these features include complex jet structure , energy re - injection due to late - time central energy activity , variable microphysics and off - axis emission , with a combination of effects likely in action in most afterglows .",
    "however , these model variations are in principle non - degenerate : linear and circular polarimetry have the ability to separate out the various models for the behaviour of the ( early ) afterglows in a completely independent way , as these models have different implications for the magnitude and orientation of the optical polarisation , as well as for their time - dependence ( e.g. @xcite ) .    the ground - breaking discovery and interpretation of sudden achromatic steepening in light curves at @xmath6 day post - burst in pre-_swift _ grbs - so - called jet breaks - provided the first convincing evidence of highly collimated ejection ( eg .",
    "@xcite ) and allowed jet opening angles and collimation - corrected energies to be derived ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "jet breaks were expected to be ubiquitous in _ swift _ light curves , but the added complexity and multiple breaks in these light curves have made jet breaks difficult to identify unambiguously ( e.g. @xcite ) . in contrast , the linear polarisation around the time of the jet break is predicted to have a unique signature ( @xcite ) : at early times a distant observer located slightly off - axis will see the afterglow as a ring shaped source , which has strong polarisation in radial direction ( assuming the magnetic field is compressed in the plane normal to the motion , i.e. ordered in the plane of the shock ) . in the received light , integrated over the ring , the polarisation will largely cancel out .",
    "however , as the fireball decelerates the size of the ring increases and at some point the edge of the jet is reached , at which point the polarisation does not completely cancel out anymore and linear polarisation is observed . as the ring expands further , the opposite edge of the jet is reached as well , giving rise to a second peak in the linear polarisation curve .",
    "therefore polarimetry provides a useful tool to unambiguously identify jet breaks from other light curve breaks , though measured polarisation curves of grb afterglows have in some cases shown puzzling features ( see e.g. the cases of grbs 030329 and 020405 discussed further in section 4.1 ) .",
    "in addition , the linear polarisation properties probe jet internal structure , as different polarisation properties are predicted for ` uniform ' or ` structured ' jet energy distributions ( rossi et al .",
    "2004 , see also section 4.2.2 ) .",
    "it has been shown that if some fraction of the magnetic field in the shock has large - scale order , the light may also be circularly polarised ( masumiya & ioka 2003 ; sagiv , waxman & loeb 2004 ) .",
    "for the forward shock ( in the ambient medium ) , most models predict 0.01@xmath71% circular polarisation during the first day ( e.g. @xcite ) , depending on the strength and order of the magnetic fields and the wavelength of observation .",
    "part of this range is within reach of large telescopes , as we will demonstrate in section 3.2 .    in the _ swift _  era",
    "few polarimetric measurements have been performed .",
    "arguably the most successful have been the early time linear polarisation measurements of the afterglows of grbs 060418 and 090102 , performed with the ringo polarimeter on the rapidly responding robotic liverpool telescope ( @xcite ) , the latter grb showing a linear polarisation of 10% just 190 seconds after burst .",
    "@xcite interpret the light curve properties and high degree of polarisation in grb090102 - which was detected when emission from the reverse shock dominated the received optical light - as evidence for large - scale ordered magnetic fields in the expanding fireball .",
    "this detection of significant polarisation at early times provides strong motivation for following the polarisation properties of the fading afterglow for many hours or days after the grb .",
    "however , late - time polarimetric observations of grbs ( see @xcite for an overview ) show that the combination of fading afterglow and low levels of polarisation ( few percent ) require large telescopes to obtain polarimetric observations over multiple days to high precision ( @xmath80.3% ) , using multiple filters to distinguish dust - induced from intrinsic afterglow polarisation . in this paper",
    "we present the first such dataset for a _ swift _  burst , and the most extensive polarimetric dataset of any burst since grb030329 ( @xcite ) .",
    "this paper is the first in a series on the afterglow of grb091018 . in this first paper",
    "we will describe our dataset in detail , and compare the observed polarisation light curves with those of other ( pre-_swift _ ) bursts and theoretical models . in a forthcoming second paper ( wiersema et al .",
    "2012 in prep ; hereafter called paper 2 ) we will discuss the dust properties in grb sightlines from a combination of multi - wavelength polarimetry , spectroscopy , host imaging and broadband afterglow spectral energy distributions . in a third paper ( paper 3 )",
    "we will model the afterglow physics of grb091018 in greater detail and fit the polarisation data to more detailed models , in particular considering energy injection .",
    "this paper is organised as follows : in section [ sec : obs ] we describe the polarimetry , spectroscopy and broadband photometry observations , the data reduction and data calibration techniques ; in section 3 we discuss the detected features in the data ; and in section 4 we compare the data to models and previous studies of afterglow polarimetric light curves . throughout this paper",
    "we adopt a cosmology with @xmath9 kms@xmath10mpc@xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 .",
    "grb091018 triggered the burst alert telescope ( bat ) onboard the _ swift _  satellite at 20:48:19 ut on october 18 , 2009 ( trigger 373172 ; @xcite ) .",
    "the prompt emission shows the burst to likely belong to the class of long bursts ( @xcite ) , with a duration @xmath13 s ( @xcite ; @xcite report a spectral lag of @xmath14 msec ) .",

    ". for each linear polarisation data set we used four rotation angles of the half wavelength plate , of 0 , 22.5 , 45 and 67.5 degrees .",
    "the circular polarisation data were taken with -45 and + 45 degree angles of the quarter wavelength plate .",
    "to ensure relatively homogenous polarimetric uncertainties as a function of time , exposure time was increased as the source faded .",
    "we employed a small dithering pattern , while taking care not to position the afterglow too close to the edges of the mask .",
    "we acquired a total of 20 linear polarisation series and 4 circular polarisation series , see table [ table : polalog ] .",
    "we began our fors2  polarimetric monitoring with a single short sequence of linear polarimetry .",
    "after this , to make full use of the brightness of the afterglow we switched to circular polarimetry , for which the models predict a much lower degree of polarisation , requiring a large number of detected photons . directly following the circular polarisation , we continued our linear polarimetry .",
    "we obtained a further 6 sequences , and a further 2 at the end of the night .",
    "the next night we obtained further datasets at the beginning and the end of the night .",
    "a last , deep , point was obtained in the third night .",
    "note that for all fors2  polarimetry we position the afterglow close to the centre of the fors2  field of view , on chip 1 , where instrumental polarisation is very low ( well below our statistical errors , @xcite ) .",
    "we bias and flat field corrected all data using tasks in iraf and using standard twilight sky flats .",
    "we use our own software in combination with iraf routines to perform aperture photometry on the _ o _  and _ e _  images of the afterglow to find the source fluxes @xmath67 and @xmath68 , using the same approach as @xcite .",
    "we used a seeing matched aperture of 1.5 times the on - frame full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) of the point spread function , fitted per frame independently for the _ o _  and _ e _ as small differences in psf shape may occur between _ o _  and _ e _  beams , particularly for objects far off - axis .",
    "the sky subtraction was done using an annulus of inner and outer radii 3 and 4 times the fwhm .",
    "we measure @xmath67 and @xmath68 for all point - like objects in all frames .",
    "we express the polarimetry information in terms of the stokes vector @xmath69 ( see e.g. chandrasekhar 1950 ) , where the components of this vector have the following meaning : @xmath70 and @xmath71 contain the behaviour of the linear polarisation ; @xmath72 the circular polarisation and @xmath73 is the intensity .",
    "generally we will use the normalised stokes parameters @xmath74 , @xmath75 and @xmath76 in this paper .",
    "theoretical models are often expressed in terms of the polarisation degree @xmath77 and polarisation angle @xmath78 .",
    "these quantities can be found from the stokes parameters through the relations : @xmath79 @xmath80 @xmath81 constant @xmath82 is an offset defined so that the resulting angle @xmath78 conforms to the standard definitions of position angle ( angle from north , counterclockwise , see fig.[fig_coords ] ) : @xmath83      to measure the stokes @xmath16 and @xmath17 parameters a measurement at two rotation angles suffices , but this introduces substantial systematic uncertainties , caused by imperfect flatfielding , imperfect background subtraction and imperfect behaviour of the half wavelength plate and wollaston prism . using four rotation angles with a constant stepsize",
    "( in this case of 22.5 degrees ) means that several of these systematic effects cancel out ( in particular the effects of background subtraction and flatfielding ) , leading to greatly improved polarimetric error terms . with these angles one can write ( patat & romaniello 2006 ) : @xmath84 where @xmath85 is the number of half wavelength plate positions , and",
    "@xmath86 is the normalised flux difference of a source in the _ o _  and _ e _  beams at the @xmath87-th angle @xmath88 for the circular polarimetry , taken with two angles of the retarder ,",
    "we can simply write @xmath89        after measurement of the fluxes of the sources in the images we compute their observed stokes parameters and their uncertainties using the expressions above . the afterglow is always positioned on nearly the same position on chip1 ( barring a small dither of @xmath90 pixels in y direction in some epochs ) , on the optical axis . as such",
    "we expect the instrumental linear polarisation to be negligible ; see patat & romaniello ( 2006 ) for a thorough error analysis of fors1 , whose polarimetry optics were moved to the fors2 instrument in 2009 . additionally , circular polarimetry stokes @xmath18 has no instrumental polarisation on axis . in conclusion ,",
    "the values of the stokes parameters found through the methods above allow an investigation of the time dependence of the afterglow @xmath91 and @xmath92 .",
    "theoretical models are generally expressed in terms of the linear and circular polarisation fractions @xmath93 and @xmath94 , and we therefore convert the stokes parameter information to these quantities using the equations above .",
    "we note that the uncertainty on the linear polarisation angle is a function of the intrinsic polarisation degree ( @xmath95 ) , which means that for the low polarisation values and faint fluxes of afterglows the uncertainties in @xmath78 are very large .",
    "finally , the position angles found are corrected for the instrumental zero angle offset , which is @xmath96 at 655 nm ( the central wavelength of the filter ) .",
    "errors on @xmath97 and @xmath98 are generally distributed as a normal distribution and the stokes parameters can have positive and negative values .",
    "in contrast , @xmath93 is a positive definite quantity . as demonstrated in @xcite ( their section 2 ) , integrating the equation for the distribution of measured ( @xmath99 ) over @xmath78 shows that @xmath93 follows a rice probability distribution rather than a gaussian one . directly using the equations above will lead to overestimated @xmath93 and incorrect confidence intervals , an effect generally referred to as the linear polarisation bias .",
    "the correction to the resulting @xmath93 and associated confidence ranges has been studied through both analytical and numerical ( monte carlo ) methods . generally speaking",
    ", this correction depends on @xmath100 , @xmath77 , and the signal to noise ( snr ) of @xmath101 ( i.e. the snr of @xmath102 ) . in the literature",
    "one often sees the wardle & kronberg ( 1974 ) prescription used , in which the input @xmath77 values are multiplied by @xmath103 to find the bias - corrected polarisation .",
    "we follow sparks & axon ( 1999 ) in using a parameter @xmath104 to trace the expected behaviour of the bias and @xmath100 : when @xmath105 the wardle & kronberg correction is valid , and @xmath100 is as computed directly from the uncertainty of @xmath106 . in our fors2 dataset before correction for galactic polarisation ( section [ sec : linrgip ] ) all data points have @xmath107 , and the bias correction is in all cases small compared to @xmath100 .      to bring the afterglow @xmath97 and @xmath98 to an absolute frame",
    ", we need to correct for the linear polarisation induced by scattering on dust in our galaxy ( galactic interstellar polarisation , gip ) .",
    "note that @xmath18 does not require a correction as there is no circular gip and the resulting linear polarisation is much smaller than the threshold for noticeable linear - circular crosstalk ( @xcite ) .",
    "we assume here that the average intrinsic polarisation of a sufficiently large sample of field stars is zero , that the bulk of the polarising dust is between these stars and the observer , and that therefore the observed distribution of @xmath97 and @xmath98 of field sources measures the gip .",
    "we measure the stokes @xmath97 and @xmath98 values of all sources that have a snr above 20 in the fors2 field , on both chips , and in all epochs .",
    "a large number of artefacts are visible in our fors2 imaging polarimetry , which have the appearance of a group of stars , and which are likely caused by reflections at the retarder plate ; we take special care to avoid stars close to these artefacts .",
    "we then eliminate sources that appear significantly extended ( galaxies ) , which may give spurious linear polarimetric signals if seeing conditions change during a polarimetric sequence .",
    "we further eliminate sources that are close to the mask edges , and sources that are close to saturation in one or more of the images .",
    "it is well known that fors1 , whose polarimetric optics are now cannibalised in fors2 , displayed a roughly radial instrumental linear polarisation pattern , with polarisation magnitude depending on the radial distance to the optical axis ( see patat & romaniello 2006 ) .",
    "the shape of the linear polarisation pattern and its magnitude depend on the wavelength , and was found to reach nearly @xmath108 at the edges of the field of view ( patat & romaniello 2006 ) .",
    "while this effect is well calibrated for fors1 in @xmath72 and @xmath73 band , a similar analysis has not yet been performed for fors2 .",
    "we therefore use a conservative approach and choose only stars close ( radially ) to the grb position .",
    "it is of some importance to not select only the brightest stars ( which would give smallest uncertainty in the gip value ) , as this may result in a bias towards the nearest stars ( in distance ) , and therefore may not sample the complete galactic dust column towards the grb .",
    "we also make sure stars are selected with a fairly uniform distribution over the field ( in terms of position angle ) .",
    "we determine the gip @xmath97 and @xmath98 values using three methods : we find the weighted mean of the field star distribution ; we fit 1-dimensional gaussian curves on the histograms of the @xmath97 and @xmath98 distributions ; and we fit a 2-dimensional gaussian function ( with its orientation as a free parameter ) on the @xmath109 distribution after converting this to a 2-dimensional histogram ( where a range of bin sizes are used based on the number of input data points ) .",
    "we perform these fits for a range of limit values on the maximum radial distance @xmath110 between the input stars and the grb ; and on the maximum allowed @xmath100 of the stars .",
    "unfortunately there are only a small number of fairly bright stars near to the grb position , making it necessary to use a large limit on the radial distance to obtain a sufficient number of datapoints .",
    "we find a best balance between the number of sources in the fit and the uncertainties on the resulting @xmath111 and @xmath112 for limits @xmath113 and @xmath114 arcmin ( 103 datapoints ) .",
    "note that @xmath115 arcmin would correspond to @xmath116 and @xmath117% instrumental polarisation in @xmath72 and @xmath73 band in fors1 , respectively ; @xcite . using these limits",
    "the three methods give very similar gip values . in figure [ fig_gip ]",
    "the distribution of datapoints ( 103 points ) is shown .",
    "we find @xmath118 and @xmath119 , or @xmath120% , @xmath121 .",
    "the 2-dimensional fit gives the width of the gaussian along the @xmath97 axis as @xmath122 and along the @xmath98 axis as @xmath123 , and the rotation of the containment ellipse from the @xmath97 axis in radians , counter - clockwise , as @xmath124 radians .",
    "the evidence for deviation from radial symmetry is not very strong , but the analysis of @xcite shows that the fors1 off - axis polarisation pattern exhibited non - radial behaviour in the b band .",
    "we use this ellipse as a conservative error in the gip stokes parameters , following @xcite .",
    "the fairly large uncertainty in these is likely dominated by the contribution of the unknown instrumental polarisation pattern and the low number of bright stars within @xmath6 arcminute of the grb position .",
    "we now subtract from the grb @xmath97 and @xmath98 values the @xmath111 and @xmath112 found above , to remove the ( constant in time ) component to the polarisation caused by the galactic interstellar medium .",
    "we propagate the errors on the gip stokes parameters into the resulting corrected values @xmath127 and @xmath128 .",
    "as is clear from table [ table : polalog ] , the afterglow polarisation at very early times ( e.g. _ lin1 , lin3 _ ) all but vanishes , indicating that at early times the detected polarisation is dominated by gip .",
    "in many epochs , the @xmath127 and @xmath128 errors are dominated by the uncertainties in the gip stokes parameters .",
    "we compute gip corrected values for the polarisation and position angle , which will bring the measured values onto an absolute scale .",
    "it is clear that the errors @xmath100 are increased dramatically , while @xmath77 decreases in several epochs ( to near zero in e.g. _ lin1 _ ) , i.e. a drop in @xmath129 . at the same time , the statistical detection signal to noise ( i.e. snr of @xmath102 , simply referred to as snr in section [ sec : linrreduc ] ) stays the same .",
    "as the polarisation bias is a function of both snr and @xmath129 , the polarisation bias correction is much larger in several epochs after gip correction , showing the necessity of treating gip effects in @xmath130 space rather than @xmath99 space in low polarisation regimes . in several cases",
    "the wardle & kronberg prescription is not valid ( see @xcite ) , and we use the methods recommended by @xcite for low @xmath129 situations ( which uses a maximum likelihood estimator , this estimator has lowest bias factor and lowest risk function values in this signal to noise range ) . in two cases this led to robust zero polarisation values .",
