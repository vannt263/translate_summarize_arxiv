    "as a glass - forming liquid is cooled , its relaxation time increases very rapidly and at sufficiently low temperatures , the relaxation time eventually exceeds the time scale of cooling .",

    "although it is evident that with increasing dimensionality @xmath2 the geometric constraints decrease , it is difficult to estimate this tendency within an analytical calculation in a more quantitative way  @xcite .",

    "[ pstack3b]b .",

    "we compare the @xmath126dependence of the specific heat found in the present simulations with experimental results by using normalized scales . following tool , we scale the ordinate by converting the specific heat signal into the fictive temperature @xmath91 of the system  @xcite . for this",
    "we have linearly extrapolated the specific heat of the glass to the supercooled liquid regime , and the specific heat of the supercooled liquid was extrapolated into to glass regime  @xcite .",

    "we also see that the width of the glass transition as observed in the simulation is significantly larger than the one found even in the strongest glass - forming substances , such as sio@xmath155 , and much larger than the fragile glass - former lithium acetate .",
    "this difference could have been expected since this width depends not only on the fragility of the glass - former but also on the cooling rate  @xcite , and the temperature scanning rates of the simulations are typically @xmath163 times faster than laboratory rates  @xcite .     the total energy per particle for a@xmath7b@xmath8 in four dimensions upon cooling ( dashed line ) followed by heating ( solid line ) at rate @xmath164 . ]    in the following we consider the dependence of the hysteresis on temperature scanning rate , composition , and dimensionality of the system in more detail .",

    "we denote the area of the hysteresis loop between heating and cooling curves as @xmath166 , and their maximum separation as @xmath167 .",
    "figure  [ p_arehei ] shows these two quantities as a function of temperature scanning rate @xmath46 on logarithmic scales .",
    "the data points fall , to a good approximation , onto parallel lines , indicating a power - law dependence of @xmath166 and @xmath168 on @xmath46 .",
    "therefore we fitted the data with the functional form @xmath169 and @xmath170 , where @xmath171 and @xmath172 are the area and the maximum separation at @xmath173 , respectively .",
    "the exponents that best fit all data are @xmath174 and @xmath175 .",
    "table  [ tab1 ] lists the pre - factors @xmath176 and @xmath172 . from this table , and from fig .",
    "[ p_arehei ] , we can conclude that the hysteresis effect increases with increasing @xmath2 , in agreement with the result shown in fig .",
    "[ stack_1 ] , i.e. that the glass - forming ability of the system increases with its dimensionality .",
    "a similar analysis can also be done for real systems , although of course only for @xmath4  @xcite .",
    "it is found that the area and maximum separation of the hysteresis curves also show a power - law dependence on the cooling rate , thus showing that the results from the present simulations are consistent with real experiments .",
    "however , these experiments yield exponents of @xmath177 for area and @xmath178 for the height , i.e. different values from the one found here and hence we can conclude that these exponents are not universal , but material - specific or characteristic of the regime of temperature scanning rate .",
    "since fragile glass - formers systems have relaxation times @xmath179 that seem to diverge at a finite temperature @xcite , their effective activation barriers , i.e. the local slope of @xmath180 vs. @xmath181 is larger than the one for strong glass - formers , if @xmath182 has macroscopic values , e.g. 1  second . the temperature range at which the system falls out of equilibrium at the glass - transition is therefore trivially related to the fragility of the system , with fragile ( strong ) glass - formers showing a transition in a narrow ( wide ) temperature range . as mentioned above , the present bmlj system is expected to be a fragile glass - former since its relaxation times show a strongly non - arrhenius @xmath126dependence . using the power - laws approximations for the scanning rate dependence of the hysteresis loop ( fig .  [ p_arehei ] ) , we can obtain a rough estimate for the behavior of the bmlj systems at laboratory scanning rates ( @xmath183 , if we identify the a particles as argon atoms ) .",
    "of course it is highly uncertain whether or not the present bmlj system avoids crystallization at such slow rates .",
    "the width of the glass transition @xmath184 is proportional to the ratio @xmath185 and thus its @xmath46-dependence is given by the exponent @xmath186 . referring to fig .",
    "[ p_expthe ] , one can estimate the width of the hysteresis loop for a@xmath7b@xmath8 at @xmath187 to be @xmath188 .",
    "the power - law approximation , with @xmath189 , predicts then for the laboratory rate a @xmath190 ( or @xmath191 if using the experimentally derived values @xmath192 and @xmath193 ) . by comparison , the width of the ( fragile ) lithium acetate glass curve in fig .",
    "[ p_expthe ] is about 0.04 .",
    "we conclude that , based on this analysis , the bmlj system is indeed fragile , in agreement with the data from the @xmath126dependence of the relaxation times  @xcite .",

    "we find that the peaks in the radial distribution functions become quickly washed out with increasing dimensionality @xmath2 , reflecting fewer geometric constraints .",
    "in particular the nearest neighbor peak of the radial distribution functions becomes broader , reflecting a wider range of geometric configurations in higher dimensions .",
    "this is evidence that the glass - forming ability of the system increases with increasing dimensionality . as @xmath2 increases , the first peak in the radial distribution function shifts closer to the central atom due to force exerted by the second - nearest neighbors on the nearest neighbors , thus resulting in a stronger @xmath126dependence of the pressure . at low temperatures",

    "the specific heat curve resembles at all temperatures the one of the supercooled liquid for @xmath198 , and thus we conclude that the one dimensional system behaves kinetically like a liquid down to @xmath0 .    for the systems that show a glass - transition we find a hysteresis loop ( cooling and heating cycle ) in the energy per particle as well as in the pressure of the system . at a given cooling rate",
