    "heat capacity is one of the most important physical properties of a system , because it holds information about its degrees of freedom .",
    "heat capacity is well understood in gases and solids .",
    "liquids , on the other hand , remain an exception , with the result that their heat capacity is often barely discussed in classic statistical physics text books @xcite or texts dedicated to liquids @xcite .",
    "the general difficulty in calculating the energy and other thermodynamic quantities of a liquid is that , unlike a gas , it has strong interactions , but at the same time does not have small atomic vibrations as a solid @xcite . because the inter - molecular interactions in a liquid are strong , the properties of this interaction , and , therefore , properties of the liquid , are strongly system - dependent @xcite .",
    "consequently , it is argued that no general recipe for calculating the energy of a liquid can exist @xcite .",
    "experimental data from many elemental liquids show that their constant - volume heat capacity , @xmath2 , _ decreases _ with temperature , from about @xmath3 at the melting point to @xmath4 at high temperature @xcite . here , @xmath5 is the number of particles and @xmath6 .",
    "the decrease of @xmath2 is also seen in many complex liquids @xcite .",
    "this behaviour is not understood in a consistent framework similar to those that exist for solid and gas phases .",
    "most calculations of liquid energy , @xmath7 , approach a liquid from the gas phase , and calculate the potential energy in addition to the gas kinetic energy , giving @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the kinetic energy of an ideal gas ( @xmath10 ) and @xmath11 is the potential energy of interatomic interactions @xcite .",
    "the simplest treatment assumes the case of a dilute system with only pair interactions . assuming that the interactions are weak ( except at short separations ) , the high - temperature expansion gives the system described by the van der waals equation @xcite .",
    "while this approach can describe a dense gas or a liquid close to the critical point , it is not adequate for real liquids .",
    "for example , @xmath2 of the van der waals is equal to that of an ideal gas @xcite , in contrast with the experimental results .",
    "the improved calculations of @xmath11 employ higher - order ( three- and four- ) particle correlations @xcite .",
    "the results , however , are not straightforward to use for numerical estimates @xcite and require the knowledge of correlation functions as well as the properties of interatomic interactions .",
    "a distinctly different , and less common , approach to discuss the energy and heat capacity of a liquid is to include the strong interactions from the outset , by approaching a liquid from the solid phase .",
    "the temperature - dependent term of the energy of a solid is given by the phonon energy .",
    "in an isotropic solid ( glass ) all vibrations can be represented by one longitudinal and two transverse waves . in classical case , this gives the heat capacity of @xmath12 , the dulong - petit result .",
    "the discussion then proceeds to establish how this result needs to be modified on transition from the solid to the liquid phase .",
    "therefore , this approach accounts for the strong interactions in a liquid from the outset . in this sense",
    ", it is opposite to the approach that starts with the energy of an ideal gas and introduces interactions as a correction .    in this approach , brillouin modified the solid - like result , @xmath12 , by assuming that a liquid does not support transverse waves , and encountered an interesting contradiction @xcite .",
    "the total energy of a solid is @xmath13 , where the first and the second term give the energy of longitudinal and transverse vibrations , respectively , and @xmath14 is the mean potential or kinetic energy .",
    "if a liquid loses two transverse vibrations , their potential terms vanish , but kinetic terms remain , and the liquid energy becomes @xmath15 , giving @xmath16 @xcite .",
    "this contradicted the experimental result that liquid heat capacity at the melting point is about the same as that of crystals , @xmath12 .",
    "one way to resolve the contradiction is to assume that a liquid consists of small crystalline domains that support transverse waves in some directions , giving @xmath12 , but not in others , enabling a liquid to flow @xcite .",
    "@xmath2 was also studied in molecular dynamics simulations , with liquid al as a case study @xcite .",
    "similar to the experiment , the decrease of heat capacity with temperature was observed , and was interpreted as the progressive loss of liquid shear resistance @xcite .    the idea that a liquid loses two transverse vibrational modes was also used by landau to calculate the energy of phonon excitations in a quantum liquid at very low temperature .",
    "this gives the result that the temperature - dependent energy term of a liquid is three times smaller than that in a harmonic solid , reflecting the fact that only one longitudinal mode is preserved @xcite .",
    "more recently , liquid heat capacity has been discussed on the basis of alternative mechanisms , including the consideration of liquid potential energy landscape with intervalley motions @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we propose that energy and heat capacity of liquids can be understood on the basis of their solid - like elastic properties .",
    "in particular , we discuss how the idea of relaxation time @xmath1 can be used to describe liquid vibrational states by approaching them from the solid phase .",
    "the experimentally observed decrease of liquid heat capacity with temperature is attributed to the increasing loss of two transverse waves with frequency @xmath0 . in a simple model",
    ", we relate liquid heat capacity and viscosity , and compare this relation with the experimental data of mercury .",
    "in addition , we calculate the vibrational energy of a quantum liquid , and show that transverse phonons can not be excited in the low - temperature limit .",
    "finally , we discuss the implications of the proposed approach to liquids for the problem of glass transition .",
    "the existence of dispersion relations and the ability to support propagating shear modes has been traditionally assigned to solids .",
    "relatively recently , experiments have shown that these features also exist in liquids , with the evidence coming primarily from inelastic x - ray , neutron and brillouin scattering experiments . in this section ,",
    "we briefly recall some of these results .",
    "early experiments detected the presence of propagating modes in liquids , in the form of `` dispersion curves '' at high frequency , at the temperature around melting @xcite .",
    "later , the measurements were extended to temperatures considerably above the melting point , and confirmed the existence of collective excitations in many liquids ( see , for example , refs .",
    "as reviewed recently , it is now well established that dynamics in liquids shows solid - like character , in that liquids can sustain high - frequency propagating modes down to wavelengths on the atomic scale , with solid - like dispersion relations @xcite .",
    "the solid - like ability of a liquid to support high - frequency shear waves considerably above the melting point was directly observed some time ago @xcite .",
    "in addition , the ability to support shear waves has been inferred from the widely observed `` positive dispersion '' , the increase of high - frequency sound velocity over that expected on the basis of hydrodynamics @xcite .",
    "the general explanation of this effect is that at high frequency , a liquid responds elastically to shear stress , developing an ability to support solid - like shear vibrations , in addition to longitudinal ones . as a result ,",
    "the propagating speed starts approaching that in a solid , i.e. increases .",
    "initially , these observations were made close to the melting point , and were attributed to the proximity of solid phase .",
    "however , later experiments found positive dispersion at temperatures considerably above the melting point , confirming the general idea that liquids support solid - like shear waves at high frequencies that extend down to microscopic wavelengths @xcite .",
    "relaxation time of a liquid was phenomenologically introduced by maxwell in the viscoelastic picture of flow @xcite .",
    "this picture is based on the assumption that deformation of a liquid in response to stress can be interpolated as the sum of elastic and viscous terms , giving @xmath17 , where @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 are shear stress , shear modulus and viscosity , respectively , and the first and the second terms represent elastic and viscous response , respectively .",
    "when external motion stops , @xmath21 , stress relaxes as @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the maxwell shear relaxation time .",
    "frenkel offered microscopic interpretation of @xmath1 as the time between elementary rearrangement processes in a liquid @xcite .",
    "he started the discussion with the contradiction of essentially the same origin as encountered by brillouin : on one hand , in order to explain the solid - like value of heat capacity in liquids at the melting point , @xmath12 , thermal motion in liquids should be considered to be solid - like , i.e. vibration around fixed positions . on the other hand , this picture contradicts fluidity of liquids .",
    "frenkel reconciled the contradiction by introducing @xmath1 as the time between consecutive atomic jumps from one equilibrium position to another in a liquid .",
    "if @xmath1 is large compared with the period of atomic vibrations , a liquid is characterized by vibrational states as a solid , giving @xmath12 .",
    "if , at the same time , @xmath1 is small compared with time @xmath24 during which an external force acts on a liquid , usual liquid flow takes place .",
    "if , on the hand , @xmath1 is large compared with @xmath24 , a liquid responds to an external force elastically as a solid .",
    "hence the elastic and viscous regime correspond to @xmath25 and @xmath26 , respectively , where @xmath27 is the frequency of external force .",
    "this can be further illustrated by considering an external force @xmath28 , for which maxwell s interpolation gives @xmath29 , hence @xmath25 and @xmath26 corresponds to elastic and viscous response , respectively .    in this picture ,",
    "frenkel arrived at an important conclusion about how the liquid state can be viewed and discussed .",
    "he proposed that a liquid should be viewed as an essentially elastic medium , in which elasticity is `` masked '' by fluidity at times larger than @xmath1 ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) .    in this approach",
    ", frenkel proposed to consider its vibrational states using the following continuity argument . the solid vibrational energy is calculated for an isotropic solid , glass , and is expressed in terms of normal modes @xcite .",
    "frenkel noted that in his picture of liquid flow , no qualitative distinction can be made between a glass and a liquid : a solid glass is different from a liquid by the value of @xmath1 only ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) . because the transition between a liquid and a glass is continuous , vibrational states of a liquid just above the glass transition temperature should not substantially change from those of a glass @xcite .",
    "this argument points to the continuity of vibrational states between a solid and a liquid , and offers an important insight into a liquid from the solid phase .",
    "at the phenomenological level , two ways to incorporate @xmath1 into the existing theories have been proposed .",
    "the first one starts from a solid phase , and modifies elasticity equations .",
    "this gives rise to frequency - dependent elastic moduli , which are interpolated between zero at @xmath26 and their solid - state value at @xmath25 @xcite .",
    "another way is to start from a liquid phase , and to modify the hydrodynamic equations , by either directly introducing maxwell viscoelastic term in the navier - stokes equation @xcite , or by introducing the exponential decay , with @xmath1 as decay time , of the memory function of current correlations @xcite .",
    "as reviewed recently , the microscopic understanding of liquid dynamics is still lacking @xcite .",
    "because elasticity and hydrodynamics describe a system at length scale that is large compared to interatomic separations , these approaches do not address the microscopic effects of relaxation : elementary relaxation processes in a liquid are local atomic jumps @xcite .",
    "other disadvantages of the phenomenological description have been discussed in ref .",
    "an open question remains as to how can the liquid ability to sustain ( lose ) transverse modes with frequency @xmath30 ( @xmath0 ) be explained at the atomistic level , similar to the normal - mode analysis in a solid ?",
    "we propose that one way to understand the absence of propagating shear modes with frequency @xmath0 in a liquid at the atomistic level is to note that local atomic rearrangement processes effectively break some of the interactions between neighbouring atoms and stop wave propagation .",
    "a local structural rearrangement involves a jump of an atom from its cage , with subsequent relaxation of the local structure @xcite .",
    "we call these rearrangements local relaxation events ( lres )",
    ". lets consider how periodic transverse motion of atom @xmath31 in a liquid affects the neighbouring atom @xmath32 . lets assume that atom @xmath31 is vibrated with period @xmath33 in the direction perpendicular to the line connecting @xmath31 and @xmath32 , exciting a shear wave , and consider atom @xmath32 is involved in a lre with a period @xmath1 .",
    "if atom @xmath31 vibrates with period @xmath34 , its displacement does not affect atom @xmath32 , because during time @xmath33 atom @xmath32 has _ independently _ jumped many times due to thermally - excited lre . in this case , the wave does not propagate . if , on the other hand , @xmath35 , @xmath31 has enough time to interact with atom @xmath32 between two consecutive lres at site @xmath32 ( atom @xmath32 is frozen on the time scale of atom @xmath31 ) . in this case , the displacement of atom @xmath31 affects atom @xmath32 in the same way as in a solid , and the wave propagates . because the vibration of atom @xmath31 is the superposition of modes with different frequencies , we find that modes with frequency @xmath36 ( @xmath37 ) can ( can not ) propagate in a liquid .",
    "we note that this discussion applies to volume - conserving shear waves .",
    "low - frequency longitudinal ( hydrodynamic ) waves propagate in the presence of lres as well , which is related to the existence of the finite zero - frequency bulk modulus in liquids ( zero - frequency shear modulus in liquids is zero by definition ) .",
    "we also note that both high - frequency longitudinal and transverse waves are subject to some damping , but the damping of shear waves with frequency @xmath0 is so large that it is impossible to talk about their propagation @xcite . damping decreases with @xmath38 in the @xmath39 regime for longitudinal and shear waves , and increases with @xmath38 in the @xmath40 regime for longitudinal waves @xcite .    in this picture ,",
    "as we approach a liquid from the solid phase , lres modify the solid vibrational spectrum by effectively removing the restoring force ( or force constants ) for shear modes at frequency @xmath0 . as a result ,",
    "the oscillatory motion starts to `` slip '' at low frequency , giving rise to diffusion due to lres . on temperature increase ,",
    "the emergent diffusive motion due to lres contributes to the increased kinetic energy of the system @xmath10 . on the other hand",
    ", we can assume that the contribution of the emergent diffusive motion to the potential energy is small .",
    "lets increase the system temperature @xmath41 by a small amount @xmath42 , corresponding to a certain new value of @xmath1 . as restoring forces for shear modes with frequency @xmath0",
    "are removed , atoms start slipping and diffusing along the same directions at which they oscillated in the presence of restoring forces at temperature @xmath41 ( albeit with larger displacements ) .",
    "note that interatomic interactions that give rise to the restoring forces at temperature @xmath41 and interactions experienced by the newly diffusing atoms at temperature @xmath43 have the same microscopic origin .",
    "therefore , the absence of restoring forces at frequency @xmath0 means that the emergent diffusive motion weakly contributes to the system s potential energy : a large value of this contribution would imply strong interactions at frequency @xmath0 and , therefore , the existence of restoring forces and shear modes with this frequency .",
    "hence , the contribution of the potential energy of the emergent diffusive motion to the total energy is small compared to other energy terms ( the potential energy of the unmodified longitudinal mode and the kinetic energy @xmath9 ) , and can be ignored .",
    "the glass transition temperature @xmath44 is defined from the condition @xmath45 s @xcite . above @xmath44 , each atom participates in the vibrational motion during time @xmath1 and in the diffusional motion when it jumps between two equilibrium positions .",
    "the instantaneous liquid energy , @xmath46 , is the sum of the vibrational , @xmath47 , and the diffusional , @xmath48 , components :    @xmath49    within thermal fluctuations , @xmath46 is equal to the liquid energy averaged over time @xmath50 .",
    "lets now approach the liquid from the solid phase as discussed in the previous section . in the solid glass phase at @xmath51 , @xmath52 , and the energy is purely vibrational and consists of kinetic and potential energy of the oscillatory motion .",
    "lets assume that the temperature is instantaneously raised , corresponding to a certain value of @xmath53 in the equilibrium state . as discussed in the previous section",
    ", the effect of local rearrangements processes is to effectively remove the potential energy component that give rise to the restoring force for two transverse modes with frequency @xmath0 .",
    "the energy of such instantaneously prepared state , @xmath7 , is the sum of the kinetic energy , @xmath9 , the potential energy of one longitudinal mode , @xmath54 , and the potential energy of two shear modes of frequency @xmath30 , @xmath55 :    @xmath56    we now let the system evolve until the equilibrium state is established . in the equilibrium state , @xmath7 becomes the energy of vibrating and diffusing atoms . from the energy conservation , the energies of the initial and the final state are the same : @xmath57 .",
    "hence , we can use eq .",
    "( 2 ) to calculate the liquid energy .",
    "because @xmath58 , where @xmath59 and @xmath60 are the kinetic energies of longitudinal and transverse modes , @xmath61 , where @xmath62 is the energy of the longitudinal mode .",
    "if @xmath63 is the energy of the transverse mode , @xmath64 from the equipartition theorem . because the equipartition theorem applies to the energy of a single oscillator as well as to the sum over any set of oscillators , @xmath65",
    "then , @xmath66 .",
    "@xmath63 can be written as the sum over modes below and above @xmath67 , @xmath68 , where the two terms refer to their solid - state values",
    ". then ,    @xmath69    the first two terms in eq .",
    "( 3 ) are the vibrational energies of one longitudinal mode and two transverse modes with frequency @xmath30 . in the solid glass phase , where @xmath1 is very large , these two terms become the vibrational energy of the system , and",
    "the last term is zero . on increasing the temperature in a liquid , the second term decreases .",
    "the last term ensures that the total kinetic energy of the system does not change as a result of this decrease : the kinetic energy is defined by temperature only ( @xmath10 ) regardless of how it partitions into vibrational and diffusional motion .    to calculate the first two terms in eq .",
    "( 3 ) , we separate @xmath5 longitudinal and @xmath70 transverse normal modes with frequency @xmath30 in the statistical sum of the vibrational motion :    @xmath71    where @xmath72 and @xmath73 are frequencies of longitudinal and transverse vibrations and @xmath74 .",
    "this gives @xmath75 , where @xmath76 and @xmath77 are the contributions to @xmath78 due to the longitudinal mode and the transverse modes with frequency @xmath30 , respectively , and @xmath79 is the number of transverse modes with @xmath80 .",

    "then , @xmath96 , and the vibrational energy of one longitudinal and two transverse modes with frequency @xmath30 becomes @xmath97 .    to calculate the last term in eq .",
    "( 3 ) , we note that similarly to @xmath98 , @xmath99 , where @xmath100 is the number of transverse modes with @xmath101 . because @xmath102 , @xmath103 .",
    "then , @xmath104 , giving    @xmath105    eq . ( [ 8 ] ) predicts the relationship between the energy of a liquid and its relaxation time @xmath106 . the first term in eq .",
    "( [ 8 ] ) is the classical energy of a solid .",
    "the second term is the contribution to the energy due to local rearrangement processes in a liquid . according to eq .",
    "( [ 8 ] ) , liquid energy is equal to the solid - state value of @xmath107 in the very broad range of relaxation time @xmath1 .",
    "this range starts from the experimentally accessible @xmath108 s , and continues up to the debye vibrational period of @xmath109 s. only when @xmath110 becomes of the order of debye frequency , liquid energy and heat capacity start decreasing from their solid - state values . hence , eq . ( [ 8 ] ) predicts that this decrease should start in low - viscous liquids not far above their melting point .",
    "this agrees with experiments on liquid hg , k , na and other systems @xcite . if @xmath111 , eq .",
    "( [ 8 ] ) gives the lower limit of the energy of a simple monatomic liquid of @xmath112 .",
    "this is the result that brillouin obtained under the assumption of the complete loss of transverse modes @xcite .",
    "the reason why the energy of a liquid is equal to the solid - state value of @xmath107 unless @xmath110 is comparable to the debye frequency can also be discussed on the basis of eq .",

( [ 8 ] ) , @xmath123 is :    @xmath124    where @xmath125 is the debye period for transverse vibrations , @xmath126 , @xmath20 is viscosity , and we used the maxwell relation @xmath127 ( @xmath128 is instantaneous shear modulus ) in order to directly relate @xmath129 and viscosity .",
    "note that eq .",
    "( [ 10 ] ) relates heat capacity and viscosity with no fitting parameters , because @xmath130 is given by the liquid properties .",
    "mercury is an appropriate liquid to test the prediction of eq .",
    "( [ 10 ] ) for a number of reasons : it is a simple monatomic liquid , anharmonic effects in mercury are small @xcite ( note that thermal expansion is ignored in our discussion ) , and finally , it is a low - viscous liquid , which makes it possible to observe the decrease of heat capacity in the reasonable temperature range : as discussed above , this is expected to take place when @xmath110 becomes of the order of debye frequency .",
    "we have taken measurements of @xmath129 of mercury from ref .",

    "viscosity data was taken from ref .",
    "@xcite , and interpolated in order to use in eq .",
    "( [ 10 ] ) to calculate @xmath129 .",
    "because viscosity shows the deviation from the arrhenius behaviour , we used the vogel - fulcher - tammann expression to fit the data , @xmath131 .",

    "because the experimental temperature range of viscosity is 250600 k @xcite , slightly smaller than the experimental temperature range of @xmath129 , 234754 k @xcite , we used the fitted expression to extrapolate viscosity data in the temperature range of @xmath129 ( see fig .",
    "( [ 10 ] ) has no fitting parameters , hence there is no flexibility to fit its prediction to the experimental curve of @xmath129 .",

    "given that the experimental error of @xmath129 is 0.10.2 j / k @xcite ( experimental error of viscosity is not known ) , we find a good agreement between the calculated and experimental @xmath129 .",
    "it is important to note that the used value of @xmath130 in fig .",
    "1b gives physically sensible values for @xmath125 and @xmath128 : if @xmath128 of mercury is about 5 gpa @xcite , the used values of @xmath130 imply @xmath125 of about 0.1 ps , a typical value of debye vibrational period .",
    "we also note that the used value of @xmath130 is close to that in other liquids : in sodium , for example , the product of high - temperature @xmath1 and @xmath128 is about @xmath138 pa@xmath134s @xcite .",
    "we can therefore conclude that the decrease of @xmath129 follows , within the experimental error , the decrease of viscosity reasonably well , with physically realistic values of @xmath125 and @xmath128 .",
    "in most liquids , crystallization or vitrification take place at low temperature . however , if a liquid state exists at low temperature , quantum effects become important .",
    "below we calculate the effect of relaxation process on the vibrational energy of a quantum liquid , @xmath47 .",
    "we first note that in considering the phonon excitations in a quantum liquid at very low temperature , landau assumed that these are due to the longitudinal phonons only @xcite .",

    "the first one concerns the general approach to glass transition from a liquid state .",
    "basic discussions of liquids begin with stochastic dynamics , which describes brownian motion and self - diffusion , and is modeled by langevin - type and related equations @xcite .",
    "these approaches assume stochastic dynamics , corresponding to the regime @xmath161 . to discuss glass transition , the formalism",
    "is then modified so that is can be extended to the supercooled state where @xmath119 and eventually to the glass phase where @xmath45 s. the important point here is that the condition @xmath119 holds in 15 decades of @xmath1 ( @xmath16210@xmath163 s ) . in this range of @xmath1 ,",
    "the system is a liquid as follows from its inability to support static shear stress on experimental time scale , i.e. it flows , yet its main properties are those of a solid .",
    "first , as discussed above , the liquid energy is equal to the vibrational energy of a solid in the range of 15 decades of @xmath1 .",
    "second , a liquid supports solid - like shear modes with frequencies @xmath30 which can also span up to 15 orders of magnitude depending on @xmath1 .",
    "hence , in almost entire glass transformation range , the important properties of a liquid are governed by its solid - like elastic features .",
    "this suggests that a glass transition theory can include the solid - like elastic properties of a liquid from the outset , rather than modify and extend the stochastic high - temperature behaviour ( where these properties are absent ) to the supercooled liquid state and glass . basing on this view",
    ", we have recently proposed how glass transition can be understood on the basis of liquid elasticity @xcite .",
    "the second implication concerns the behaviour of liquid heat capacity at @xmath44 .",
    "opposite to the increase of @xmath129 on lowering the temperature in fig . 1",
    ", constant - pressure heat capacity decreases at @xmath44 , often with a jump , @xmath164 @xcite .",
    "it is therefore important to discuss how the two effects can be reconciled .",
    "several popular theories of glass transition relate @xmath164 at @xmath44 to the reduction of liquid configurational entropy and to an underlying phase transition @xcite .",
    "this approach has been convincingly criticized for a number of reasons @xcite .",
    "we propose that @xmath164 at @xmath44 can be understood as a kinetic effect related to the non - equilibrium nature of glass transition , rather than to the presence of an underlying phase transition .",
    "hence , this effect is different from the one that governs liquid heat capacity in eq .",
    "( 6 ) : recall that we related liquid heat capacity to the liquid equilibrium vibrational states .",
    "@xmath164 at @xmath44 can be understood from the disappearance of lres at @xmath44 .",
    "the presence of these processes in a liquid ( or their absence in a glass ) has a profound effect on several of important properties of the system .",
    "first , lres are accompanied by the increases of local volume .",
    "this is because the energy needed for an atom to escape its cage at the constant volume is very large due to strong short - range interatomic repulsions .",
    "hence , atoms in the cage need to increase its volume in order to allow for the escape of the central atom @xcite . because @xmath44 is defined from the condition of disappearance of lres on the experimental time scale , thermal expansion is larger ( smaller ) above ( below ) @xmath44 .",
    "this gives rise to the experimentally observed kink of density at @xmath44 @xcite , and contributes to the jump of @xmath165 at @xmath44 .",
    "second , because lres are accompanied by fluctuating local volume increases , they result in a faster softening of the high - frequency elastic constants of a liquid as compared to a glass , as witnessed by the kink of the high - frequency longitudinal and transverse sound velocities @xcite .",
    "this introduces a difference in the compressibility between a liquid and a glass at @xmath44 , and contributes to @xmath164 .",
    "finally , at times @xmath50 , lres ensure that the configurational entropy of the system , @xmath166 , is equal to the `` entropy of melting '' associated with the increase of the number of configurations of a liquid over that of a solid @xcite .",
    "if lres are frozen at @xmath44 , the change of @xmath166 contributes to @xmath164 .",
    "importantly , small variations of temperature around @xmath44 give large changes of @xmath1 , leading to the freezing of lres in a very narrow temperature range and therefore giving rise to the observed apparent jump of @xmath165 .",
    "generally , this is because at @xmath44 , the activation barrier for lres , @xmath115 , is very large : because @xmath117 and @xmath167100 - 1000 s , @xmath16835 - 37 .",
    "moreover , in `` fragile '' liquids @xcite , i.e. liquids with large slope of @xmath169 vs @xmath170 at @xmath44 , small variations of temperature around @xmath44 , @xmath42 , result in a large change of @xmath1 .",
    "take , for example , propylene carbonate , for which relaxation time follows the vft law , @xmath171 with parameters @xmath172 k , @xmath173 k and @xmath174 s @xcite . the conditions @xmath175 s and @xmath176 s give @xmath177 k and @xmath178 k , i.e. the decrease of temperature at @xmath44 by only 1.2 k gives a ten - fold increase of @xmath1 .",
    "similarly , for several other fragile liquids @xcite , we find that the variations of @xmath179(1 - 2 ) k at @xmath44 result in the variations of @xmath1 by an order of magnitude .",
    "this picture predicts that no @xmath164 would have been observed had the experiment lasted for time @xmath50 .",
    "this is consistent with the general finding that the observed anomalies at @xmath44 depend on cooling rate and observation time .",
    "another prediction of this picture is that @xmath164 at @xmath44 should be sharp in fragile , but not in `` strong '' liquids , which have a smaller slope of @xmath169 vs @xmath170 at @xmath44 .",
    "this is consistent with the experimental results @xcite . to summarize",
    ", @xmath164 can be understood as a natural signature of the glass transition insofar as this transition is defined by the freezing of lres at the experimental time scale , but not as a result of a phase transition .",
    "in summary , we discussed the solid - like elastic properties of liquids , including its vibrational states , energy and heat capacity .",
    "the decrease of liquid heat capacity with temperature was attributed to the increasing loss of two transverse modes with frequency @xmath0 . in a simple model , we related liquid heat capacity and viscosity , and compared this relation with the experimental data of mercury .",
    "we also calculated the vibrational energy of a quantum liquid , and showed that transverse phonons can not be excited in the low - temperature limit .",
    "finally , we discussed the implications of the proposed approach to liquids for the problem of glass transition ."
