    "analysis of data collected by the fermi - lat experiment has revealed two large circular structures near the galactic centre , above and below the galactic plane   the so - called fermi bubbles  @xcite .",
    "the approximate edges of the fermi bubble regions are shown in figure  [ fig : fb_shape ] .",
    "these structures are characterised by gamma - ray emission with a hard @xmath0 spectrum and a constant intensity over the whole emission region .",
    "signals from roughly the fermi bubble regions were also observed in the microwave band by wmap  @xcite and , recently , in the radio - wave band  @xcite .",
    "moreover , the edges correlate with the x - ray emission measured by rosat  @xcite .",
    "several proposed models explaining the emission include hadronic mechanisms , in which gamma rays together with neutrinos are produced by the collisions of cosmic - ray protons with interstellar matter  @xcite . others which include leptonic mechanisms or dark matter decay would produce lower neutrino emission or none at all  @xcite .",
    "the observation of a neutrino signal from the fermi bubble regions would play a unique role in discriminating between models .",
    "the properties of the hypothesised neutrino emission are described in section  [ s : fermi ] .",
    "an overview of the antares neutrino detector is given in section  [ s : antares ] and the neutrino event reconstruction is described in section  [ s : reconstruction ] .",
    "the search for neutrino emission is performed by comparing the number of events in the fermi bubble regions to the number found in similar off - zone regions ( section  [ s : offzones ] ) .",
    "the event selection optimisation is based on a simulation of the expected signal as described in section  [ s : simulation ] .",
    "the selected events are presented in section  [ s : results ] together with the significance and the upper limit on the neutrino flux from the fermi bubbles .",
    "the estimated photon flux in the energy range 1100  gev covered by the fermi - lat detector from the fermi bubble regions is  @xcite : @xmath1 assuming a hadronic model in which the gamma - ray and neutrino fluxes arise from the decay of neutral and charged pions respectively , the @xmath2 and @xmath3 fluxes are proportional to the gamma - ray flux with proportionality coefficients of 0.211 and 0.195 respectively  @xcite . with this assumption and using  ( [ f :",
    "gamma ] ) the expected neutrino flux is : @xmath4 @xmath5 the neutrino flux , as well as the gamma - ray flux , is expected to have an exponential energy cutoff , so the extrapolation of  ( [ f : fb_flux ] ) towards higher energies can be represented by : @xmath6 the cutoff is determined by the primary protons which have a suggested cutoff @xmath7 in the range from 1  pev to 10  pev @xcite .",
    "the corresponding neutrino - energy cutoff may be estimated by assuming that the energy transferred from @xmath8 to @xmath9 derives from the fraction of energy going into charged pions ( @xmath10 ) which is then distributed over four leptons in the pion decay .",
    "thus : @xmath11 which gives a range from 50  tev to 500  tev for @xmath12 .",
    "the antares telescope is a deep - sea cherenkov detector which is located 40  km from toulon ( france ) , at a latitude of @xmath13  n and a mooring depth of 2475 m. at a mooring depth of 2475  m. the energy and direction of incident neutrinos are measured by detecting the cherenkov light produced in water from muons originating in the charged - current interactions of @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "the light is detected with a three - dimensional array of twelve detection lines comprising 885 optical modules , each containing a 10  inch pmt .",
    "more details on the detector construction , its positioning system and the time calibration can be found in  @xcite .",
    "the antares detector started data - taking with the first 5 lines installed in 2007 .",
    "the construction of the detector was completed , with installation of the last two lines , in may 2008 .",
    "the apparatus has been operating continuously ever since .",
    "its main goal is the detection of neutrinos produced by the cosmic sources .",
    "muons and neutrinos created in cosmic - ray induced atmospheric showers provide the two main background components for the search for cosmic neutrinos .",
    "although the more than 2 km of water above the detector acts as a partial shield against the atmospheric muons , the downgoing atmospheric muon background at these depths is still bigger than the expected signal .",
    "therefore , the search for cosmic signal concentrates on upgoing events which corresponds to neutrinos which have crossed the earth . also , the optical modules are oriented downwards at @xmath16 to favour the detection of upgoing particles .",
    "the antares neutrino telescope has an excellent visibility by means of the upgoing neutrinos to the galactic centre region and to the fermi bubbles .",
    "since atmospheric neutrinos may traverse the earth and lead to upgoing tracks in the detector , any signal from the fermi bubbles would be inferred by observing a significant statistical excess over the background .",
    "the signal - to - noise ratio can be improved by rejecting low - energy neutrino events , as the spectrum of the atmospheric neutrinos is steeper than the expected source spectrum .",
    "the track of a muon passing through the detector is reconstructed using the arrival time of the photons together with the positions and orientations of the photomultipliers .",
    "details of the tracking algorithm are given in  @xcite .",
    "only events reconstructed as upgoing have been selected .",
    "in addition , cuts on the reconstruction quality parameters have been applied in order to reject downgoing atmospheric muon events that are incorrectly reconstructed as upgoing tracks .",
    "these parameters are the quality @xmath17 of the track fit , which is derived from the track fit likelihood , and the uncertainty @xmath18 of the reconstructed track direction .",
    "the choice of the cut on @xmath17 fixes the amount of background from misreconstructed atmospheric muons in the neutrino sample .",
    "neutrino simulations for an @xmath0 neutrino spectrum have yielded a median angular resolution on the neutrino direction of less than @xmath19 for events with @xmath20 and @xmath21  @xcite .",
    "shower - like events are identified by using a second tracking algorithm with @xmath22-like fit , assuming the hypothesis of a relativistic muon ( @xmath23 ) and that of a shower - like event ( @xmath24 )  @xcite .",
    "events with better point - like fit ( @xmath25 ) have been excluded from the analysis .    in this analysis",
    "the energy of the muons entered or born in the detector was estimated using artificial neural networks , which are produced using a machine learning algorithm which derives the dependence between a set of observables and the energy estimate in a semi - parametric way  @xcite .",
    "the parameters used include the number of detected photons , and the total deposited charge .",
    "the median resolution for @xmath26 is about 0.3 for muons with an energy of 10  tev .",
    "the reconstructed energy @xmath27 is used to reject the atmospheric neutrino background while @xmath17 is used mostly to reject atmospheric muons .",
    "the choice of cuts on @xmath17 and @xmath27 in this work is discussed in section  [ s : mrf ] .",
    "a signal from the combined fermi bubble regions is searched for by comparing the number of selected events from the area of both bubbles ( on - zone ) to that of similar regions with no expected signal ( off - zones ) .",
    "the simplified shape of each fermi bubble as used in this analysis is shown in figure  [ fig : fb_shape ] .",
    "off - zones are defined as fixed regions in equatorial coordinates which have identical size and shape as the on - zone but have no overlap with it . in local coordinates ,",
    "such off - zones have the same , sidereal - day periodicity as the on - zone and span the same fraction of the sky , but with some fixed delay in time .",
    "the size of the fermi bubbles allows at maximum three non - overlapping off - zones to be selected .",
    "the on - zone and three off - zones are shown in figure  [ fig : fb_offzones_eq ] together with the sky visibility .",
    "the visibility of each point on the sky is the fraction of the sidereal day during which it is below the horizon at the antares site ( in order to produce upgoing events in the detector ) .",
    "the average visibility of the fermi bubbles is 0.68 ( 0.57 for the northern bubble and 0.80 for the southern bubble ) and it is the same for the off - zones .    slightly changing detector efficiency with time and gaps in the data acquisition",
    "can produce differences in the number of background events between the on - zone and the three off - zones . in order to test for such an effect , firstly",
    ", the number of events in the off - zones is extracted from the data for various cuts ( @xmath28 , @xmath29 ) and the difference in the event numbers between each pair of off - zones is calculated .",
    "this difference is compared with the statistical uncertainty and no excess is seen beyond the expected statistical fluctuations .",
    "secondly , the number of events in the on - zone together with the average number of events in the three off - zones is tested using the simulated atmospheric background and the difference is found to be within the expectation from the statistical uncertainty .",
    "it can be concluded , therefore , that this effect is negligible .     showing the fermi bubble regions ( on - zone ) shaded area in the centre .",
    "the regions corresponding to the three off - zones are also depicted .",
    "the colour fill represents the visibility of the sky at the antares site .",
    "the maximum on the colour scale corresponds to a 24  h per day visibility.,scaledwidth=80.0% ]",
    "the analysis adopts a blind strategy in which the cut optimisation is performed using simulated data for the signal and the background .",
    "the main quantities used to discriminate between the cosmic neutrino candidate events and the background from misreconstructed atmospheric muons and from atmospheric neutrinos are the tracking quality parameter @xmath17 and the reconstructed muon energy @xmath27 .    [ s : simulation ] the simulation chain for antares is described in  @xcite . for the expected signal from the fermi bubbles , the @xmath2 and @xmath3 fluxes according to section  [ s : fermi ]",
    "are assumed , using four different cutoffs @xmath12 : no cutoff ( @xmath30 ) , 500  tev , 100  tev and 50  tev .",
    "atmospheric neutrinos are simulated using the model from the bartol group  @xcite which does not include the decay of charmed particles .",
    "data in the period from may 2008 , when the detector started to operate in its complete configuration , until december 2011 are used .",
    "the total livetime selected for this analysis amounts to 806  days .",
    "figure  [ fig : fb_lambda ] shows the distribution of data and simulated events as a function of the parameter @xmath17 for events arriving from the three off - zones . here the events with at least 10 detected photons and the angular error estimate @xmath31 are selected .",
    "the requirement on the number of photons removes most of the low - energy background events .",
    "the angular error condition is necessary in order to ensure a high angular resolution to avoid events originating from an off - zone region being associated with the signal region and vice versa .     for the upgoing events arriving from the three off - zones : data ( black crosses ) , 68% confidence area given by the total background simulation ( grey area ) , @xmath32 ( blue filled circles ) , @xmath33 ( pink empty circles ) ; bin - ratio of the data to the total background simulation ( bottom).,scaledwidth=70.0% ]    at @xmath34 the main background component changes from the misreconstructed atmospheric muons to the upgoing atmospheric neutrino events as seen in figure  [ fig : fb_lambda ] .",
    "the flux of atmospheric neutrinos in the simulation is 23% lower than observed in the data .",
    "this is well within the systematic uncertainty on the atmospheric neutrino flux and the atmospheric flux from the simulations was scaled accordingly in the following analysis .",
    "a comparison of the energy estimator for data and for atmospheric neutrino simulation is shown in figure  [ fig : fb_eann ] for the same event selection but with a stricter cut @xmath35 to remove most of the misreconstructed atmospheric muons .",
    "the reconstructed energy of all simulated events has been shifted , @xmath36 , in order to improve the agreement between data and simulations .",
    "this is within the estimated uncertainty of the optical module efficiency and the water absorption length  ( * ? ? ?",

    "the expected signal was scaled by a factor of 3 to allow easy comparison with the total off - zone distribution.,scaledwidth=70.0% ]    the final event selection is optimised by minimising the average upper limit on the flux : @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the number of events simulated with the flux @xmath40 from  ( [ f : fb_flux2 ] ) .",
    "the method uses an approach following feldman & cousins  @xcite to calculate signal upper limits with 90% confidence level , @xmath41 , for a known number of simulated background events @xmath42 .",
    "this best average upper limit in the case of no discovery represents the sensitivity of the detector to the fermi bubbles flux  @xcite . using  ( [ f : fb_flux2 ] ) the average upper limit on the flux coefficient @xmath43",

    "additionally , the optimal cuts for @xmath47  tev are applied for the other neutrino - energy cutoffs and the values @xmath48 are reported for comparison . as the obtained values @xmath49 and @xmath48 for each cutoff are similar , the 100  tev cuts are chosen for the final event selection .

    "an analysis of the 20082011 antares data yielded a 1.2 @xmath52 excess of events in the fermi bubble regions , compatible with the no - signal hypothesis .",
    "for the optimistic case of no energy cutoff in the flux , the upper limit is within a factor of three of a prediction from the purely hadronic model based on the measured gamma - ray flux .",
    "the sensitivity will improve as more data is accumulated ( more than 65% gain in the sensitivity is expected once 20122016 data is added to the analysis ) . the next generation km3net neutrino telescope will provide more than an order of magnitude improvement in sensitivity  @xcite .",
