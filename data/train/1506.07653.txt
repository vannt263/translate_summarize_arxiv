    "the dynamics of a wide class of open quantum systems , interacting with the environment , can be described in the framework of the hudson - parthasarathy quantum stochastic calculus @xcite .",
    "this approach employs quantum stochastic differential equations ( qsdes ) which are driven by a quantum mechanical analogue of the classical wiener process @xcite .",
    "the quantum wiener process models a heat reservoir of external fields and acts on a boson fock space @xcite . the drift vector and the dispersion matrix of the qsdes depend on the system hamiltonian and the system - field coupling operators .",
    "these energy operators specify the evolution of the system as a result of its internal dynamics influenced by the interaction with the environment .",
    "the hamiltonian and the coupling operators are usually modelled as functions of the system variables . in particular , such functions can be polynomials or weyl quantization integrals @xcite , which affects the complexity of the resulting quantum system .    an important role in the linear quantum control and filtering theory @xcite is played by open quantum harmonic oscillators ( oqhos ) @xcite with quadratic hamiltonians and linear system - field coupling operators .",
    "the linear - quadratic dependence of the energy operators on the system variables , in combination with the canonical commutation relations ( ccrs ) between the variables , makes the oqho dynamics linear ( and gaussian in the case of vacuum fields and gaussian initial states @xcite ) . despite some similarities to the classical linear sdes , the coherent ( that is , measurement - free ) quantum counterparts @xcite to the classical lqg control and filtering problems @xcite for oqhos are complicated by the physical realizability ( pr ) constraints .",
    "the latter are associated with the state - space matrices of the qsdes for fully quantum controllers or filters and are related , in particular , to the ccr preservation .",
    "we mention one of the existing variational approaches @xcite to the coherent quantum lqg ( cqlqg ) control and coherent quantum filtering ( cqf ) problems which develops optimality conditions using the frechet differentiation of the lqg cost with respect to the state - space matrices .",
    "the quantum nature of the underlying problem enters this approach only through the pr constraints , with all the other aspects of the method being essentially `` classical '' .",
    "the latter has certain advantages , such as practical applicability to the numerical optimization algorithms @xcite .",
    "however , this approach is limited to linear controllers and filters , and the resulting optimality conditions do not provide insights into whether nonlinear quantum controllers or filters can outperform the linear ones for linear quantum plants .    in the present paper",
    ", we consider a cqf problem , similar to @xcite , where a quantum observer is cascaded in a measurement - free fashion with a linear quantum plant so as to minimize a mean square error with which the observer variables approximate linear combinations of plant variables of interest .",
    "both systems are governed by markovian hudson - parthasarathy qsdes driven by bosonic fields in vacuum state .",
    "we employ a recently proposed fully quantum variational method of @xcite based on using a transverse hamiltonian , an auxiliary time - varying operator which encodes the propagation of perturbations through the unitary system - field evolution .",
    "we apply the transverse hamiltonian approach to the development of first - order necessary conditions of optimality for the cqf problem in a larger class of observers .",
    "the latter is obtained by perturbing the hamiltonian and system - field coupling operators of a linear coherent quantum observer along linear combinations of the unitary weyl operators @xcite .",
    "similar trigonometric polynomials of quantum variables have recently been used in @xcite for modelling the uncertainty in system hamiltonians . in the present paper ,",
    "the weyl variations play a different role which resembles that of the needle variations in the proof of the pontryagin minimum principle @xcite .",
    "we show that if the observer is a stationary point of the cost functional in the class of linear observers , then it is also a stationary point with respect to the weyl variations ( with the latter leading to nonlinear observers ) .",
    "therefore , in the mean square optimal cqf problem for linear quantum plants , linear coherent quantum observers are locally sufficient at least in the sense of the weyl variations of the energy operators .",

    "<S> this paper is concerned with the coherent quantum filtering ( cqf ) problem , where a quantum observer is cascaded in a measurement - free fashion with a linear quantum plant so as to minimize a mean square error of estimating the plant variables of interest . </S>",
    "<S> both systems are governed by markovian hudson - parthasarathy quantum stochastic differential equations driven by bosonic fields in vacuum state . </S>",
    "<S> these quantum dynamics are specified by the hamiltonians and system - field coupling operators . </S>",
    "<S> we apply a recently proposed transverse hamiltonian variational method to the development of first - order necessary conditions of optimality for the cqf problem in a larger class of observers . </S>",
    "<S> the latter is obtained by perturbing the hamiltonian and system - field coupling operators of a linear coherent quantum observer along linear combinations of unitary weyl operators , whose role here resembles that of the needle variations in the pontryagin minimum principle . </S>",
    "<S> we show that if the observer is a stationary point of the performance functional in the class of linear observers , then it is also a stationary point with respect to the weyl variations in the larger class of nonlinear observers .    in loving memory of my mother , raisa dmitrievna vladimirova ( 10.05.1933  30.05.2015 ) </S>"
