    "as nuclei are made up of nucleons it is natural to look at nucleus - nucleus ( a - a ) collisions as resulting from the superposition of nucleon - nucleon ( p - p ) collisions , in the spirit of glauber model approach and generalizations of it . in the single scattering limit the average number of participating nucleons per nucleus , @xmath4 behave incoherently and @xmath5 eq ( 1 ) corresponds to the wounded nucleon model @xcite@xcite @xcite .",
    "this model is expected to dominate at very low energy . in general",
    ", data do not agree with ( 1 ) .    at higher",
    "energy one has to take into account multiple scattering and one finds @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the estimated total number of nucleon - nucleon collisions and single scattering was subtracted @xcite .",
    "it should be noticed that energy momentum conservation constrains the combinatorial factors of the glauber calculus at low energy .",
    "the problem is that the energy momentum of @xmath8 valence strings has to be shared by @xmath9 ( mostly ) sea strings .",
    "there are proposals to cure this problem , for instance , by reduction of the height of the rapidity plateau for sea strings @xcite . in the same spirit , but reducing the effective number of sea strings rather than reducing the sea plateau , we write ( see @xcite ) .",
    "@xmath10 with @xmath11 such that for @xmath12 , @xmath13 , we are back to the wounded nucleon model , and for @xmath14 , @xmath15 , and we have fully developed glauber calculus .",
    "the need to take multiple scattering contribution was experimentally shown at rhic @xcite .    here as in @xcite",
    "@xcite our framework is the dual parton model with parton saturation , and we work with schwinger strings , with fusion and percolation @xcite .    in pp and au - au collisions or in general @xmath16 collisions",
    "the interactions occur with the formation of longitudinal strings in rapidity . the particle density @xmath17 is expected to be proportional to the average number of strings ( twice the number of elementary collisions ) @xmath18 ( see @xcite ) , @xmath19    the string percolation model describes the multi particle production in terms of color strings stretched between the partons of the projectile and the target . in the impact parameter plane due to the confinement",
    ", the color of strings is confined to small area in transverse space @xmath20 with @xmath21 fm , these strings decay into new ones by @xmath22 pair production and subsequently hadronize to produce the observed hadrons . in the impact parameter plane",
    "the strings appear as disks and as energy - density increases the discs overlap , fuse and percolate , leading to the reduction of the overall color @xcite@xcite@xcite .",
    "a cluster of @xmath23 strings behaves as a single string with energy momentum corresponding to the sum of the individual ones .",
    "an essential quantity is the color reduction factor @xmath24    where @xmath25 is the string density in the impact parameter plane for @xmath16 collisions given as ( see @xcite ) : @xmath26 @xmath27 is the area of the impact parameter projected overlap region of the interaction covered by @xmath8 nucleons from nucleus a. note that @xmath28 and instead of ( 5 ) we have now @xmath29 the color reduction factor @xmath30 is a tool to slow down the increase of @xmath17 with energy and number of participating nucleons .",
    "note that in ( 1 ) nucleons interact incoherently and @xmath27 is in fact @xmath31 , while in ( 2 ) , due to coherence , @xmath27 is the overall area of interaction .",
    "for details see @xcite .",

    ", we now apply the same formalism as used in pp to describe the rapidity evolution as suggested in ref @xcite@xcite@xcite obtaining a general formula for pseudo - rapidity dependence of aa collisions :    @xmath42    where @xmath43 is the usual jacobean @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "we now apply the formula to describe the charge multiplicity in p - p collisions for different energies in pseudo rapidity , from our general formula ( 12 ) by using @xmath46 and @xmath47 , to consider p - p collisions the expression is reduced to @xmath48",
    "in figure ( 1 ) it is shown the comparison of the formula ( 13 ) applyied to different energies at different pseudo - rapidities with data from different experiments and energies , showing a good agreement in the evolution in pseudo rapidity and an increase in the plateau region as increasing with energy .    in figure",
    "( 2 ) , ( 3 ) , ( 4 ) and ( 5 ) it is shown the comparison between our results from formula ( 12 ) for cu - cu , au - au and pb - pb collisions at different energies , in agreement with data .    in figure ( 6 ) we show some predictions for 3.2 , 3.9 and 5.5 tev energies at centrality @xmath49 , for pb - pb collisions .    in the above computations we have used the following values of the parameters : @xmath50 , @xmath51 , and @xmath52 gev , the same as obtained in @xcite , to describe the particle density @xmath53 in the same power law as @xmath54 .",
    "we had made here an extension to these descriptions to add the pseudo rapidity evolution with the same aim as in ref @xcite .",
    "the new parameters values @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 had been set to adjust the equation ( 13 ) with data [ 13][14[15 ] .",
    "these results can be extended to describe proton - nucleus collisions .",
    "we have discussed in a general way the physics of particle densities in pp and aa collisions .",
    "our model gives a non - linear dependence of @xmath58 on @xmath1 .",
    "particle densities , as a function of @xmath2 and @xmath3 give a good description of pb - pb data at lhc in a wide region in @xmath2 .",

    "notice that recent data from totem experiment measurements in the the charged particle pseudorapidity density @xmath59 in pp collisions at @xmath60 tev for @xmath61 have been compared to several mc generators and none of them has been found to fully describe the measurement , but our model is able to reproduce it .",
