    "the existence of anapole moment was theoretically predicted by zeldovich fifty years ago @xcite .",
    "the anapole moment arises in the system where currents or magnetic moments of particles create a ring - like closed distribution of magnetic field lines .",
    "a classic example of such distribution can be a magnetic field inside the toroidal solenoid over the surface of which poloidal currents flow .",
    "a less trivial example is an atomic nucleus in which spins of nucleons compose a ring with forming the corresponding configuration of the magnetic field .",
    "the great interest to the anapole is related to fundamental investigations on the parity nonconservation in atomic - nuclear interactions @xcite . in 1997",
    "the anapole moment of the nucleus @xmath3cs was discovered just in the experiment on parity nonconservation in the atomic transition @xmath4 of cs @xcite .",
    "now the anapole is regarded as a dipole moment of the fundamental family of toroid moments @xcite which naturally arise when currents on a torus surface are described .",
    "toroid moments are now used in problems of current parametrization and of radiation theory @xcite , in investigations of topological effects in quantum mechanics ( the aharonov - bohm effect @xcite ) , in elementary particle physics ( toroid dipole momentum of neutrino @xcite and @xmath5-scattering @xcite for example ) , in the theory of anomalous internal conversion @xcite , in atomic physics ( anapole moments of atoms @xcite , atomic emission in a condensed medium @xcite ) , in the physics of nanostructures ( carbon toroids @xcite ) , in the physics of spin - ordered crystals @xcite etc .",
    "thus the physics of toroid moments is a wide area of scientific activity ranging from elementary particles to condensed matter . at the same time , the nucleus together with the atomic shell remain one of the most suitable quantum object for probing the toroid moments .",
    "the reason is as follows .",
    "the electronic wave functions for @xmath1 and @xmath6 states have large amplitudes at the origin . as a consequence",
    ", the electronic current at such states effectively penetrates the nucleus and interacts with the toroid moment , whose magnetic field does not exceed the boundary of the nucleus .",
    "( this interaction mechanism is a direct analogy of a thought experiment offered in ref .",
    "@xcite for a toroidal solenoid immersed into the electrolyte . ) today the situation is .",
    "the static toroid dipole moment has discovered @xcite . as regards the toroid dipole moment of transition ,",
    "there are evidences @xcite that this moment results in known anomalies in the internal conversion coefficients for @xmath7 transitions in nuclei @xcite and in the process of nuclear excitation by electron transition in the atomic shell @xcite .",
    "thus , more detailed and precise `` conversion '' experiments are needed to detect the toroid dipole moment of transition .    in the present work we consider , on the example of the nucleus ",
    "atomic shell system , two new effects dealt with the toroid moments .",
    "first of all , we prove that the anomalies mentioned above for @xmath0 transitions result from a `` cyclo - toroid moment '' .",
    "this moment arises when the toroid dipole moments are arranged in a ring .",
    "secondary , we demonstrate a possibility of experimental investigation of the existence of the cyclo - toroid moment by measuring of the energy shift in atomic @xmath1 levels",
    ". the results obtained here would be useful for more fundamental understanding of the nontrivial distribution of the currents inside nucleus and nucleons , and for the processes of the interaction between nucleus and atomic shell .",
    "anomalous internal conversion of @xmath8-rays in deformed nuclei arises because of the penetration of the electron current @xmath9 into the nucleus `` beneath '' the nuclear current @xmath10 , i.e. when the current coordinates satisfy the condition @xmath11 .",
    "the reason which changes the probability of the mentioned atomic - nuclear processes originates from to the additional selection rules @xcite .",
    "nuclear and atomic matrix elements which determine the process of de - excitation ( excitation ) of deformed nuclei through the atomic shell for @xmath11 are different from those for @xmath12 . in some cases",
    "the additional selection rules allow the nuclear transition for @xmath11 and forbid a @xmath8-radiative transition @xcite with nuclear matrix element @xmath13 entering the probability formula for @xmath12 .",
    "( here and further @xmath14 are the standard electric / magnetic multipoles according to the gauge of @xmath15 ( see in ref .",
    "@xcite ) , and @xmath16 are current densities .",
    "we call @xmath16 `` currents '' for short . )    at the beginning of 80s it was found out that the real cause of the mentioned anomaly in the processes of an electric - dipole ( @xmath7 ) interaction of the nucleus with the atomic shell results from the dipole toroid moment of the transition @xcite .",
    "toroid moments are the components of electric moments @xcite .",
    "moreover , the anomaly also exists in conversion magnetic - dipole ( @xmath0 ) transitions @xcite .",
    "let us consider the nature of such @xmath0 anomaly .",
    "the nucleus matrix element corresponding to the anomalous part of the magnetic - dipole process of the nuclear interaction with the atomic shell is as follows @xcite @xmath17 where @xmath18 @xcite , @xmath19 is the energy of a nuclear transition , @xmath20 , @xmath21 are the spherical bessel functions , @xmath22 are the vector spherical harmonics from ref .",

    "the spin term of the current @xmath41 in the matrix element @xmath25 in eq  ( [ eq : n - an ] ) corresponds to the operator in eq  ( [ eq : operat - an ] ) in square brackets under the integral  @xmath42 $ ] ( here @xmath43 is the density of the magnetic moment @xmath44 ) .",

    "using the spherical functions it is easy to rewrite eq  ( [ eq : ct-1 ] ) in the form : @xmath49 then let us remember that the following objects possess the toroid moment : ( a ) a toroidal solenoid with a current @xmath46 ; ( b ) a ring formed by magnetic moments @xmath43 @xcite . for case ( b )",
    "the following relationship is true : @xmath50 , besides that @xmath51 due to helmholtz theorem @xcite . substituting @xmath52 into eq  ( [ eq:<ct > ] ) instead of @xmath43",

    "the geometrical image corresponding to the operator @xmath48 , is the ring - like composed dipole toroid moments @xmath59 .",
    "therefore @xmath48 can be called the density of cyclo - toroid moment , and @xmath60  the cyclo - toroid moment .",
    "the properties of a cyclo - toroid are shown by the torus whose surface is formed by either ring - like composed magnetic moments @xmath43 , or by poloidal lines of the magnetic field ( fig .",
    "[ fig1]a ) .",
    "it is also possible to consider the cyclo - toroid as a sequence of toroidal solenoids all together forming again a toroidal solenoid ( such objects were considered for the first time in ref .",
    "@xcite ) . in this case",
    "the equal currents flow in opposite directions on the surface of two toruses ( one of them is embedded into another ) as it is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1]b .",
    "zeldovich s anapole @xcite in the static case interacts with the external current @xmath61 only .",
    "the energy of this interaction is @xmath62 .",

    "let us determine now the role of a cyclo - toroid in the anomalous conversion .",
    "consider the internal electron conversion from one of the @xmath1 states of an atom and show first of all that @xmath65 during the @xmath0 transition of an electron to the @xmath66 state of the continuous spectrum .",
    "we write the electron current in a common way @xmath67 , where @xmath68 , @xmath69 and @xmath70 are the dirac matrixes @xcite , @xmath71 is the proton charge , @xmath72 are the electron wave functions .",

    "the normalization condition is as follow : @xmath77 .",

    "the angular part @xmath81 is very simple , and the components of the bispinor can be written in the following way : @xmath82 , @xmath83 and @xmath84 . within the spherical coordinate system the current is as follows @xmath85 for @xmath86 correspondingly .",
    "we can see that the existence of the @xmath87 transition electron current itself is a totally relativistic effect .",
    "the current disappears ( as it should be ) when the small parts of the dirac wave functions @xmath75 tend to zero .",
    "the interaction of the current with the cyclo - toroid does not occur beyond the nucleus range .",
    "therefore , for the radial components of the @xmath88 states one can use the expressions which are true for small values of arguments : @xmath89 , @xmath90 , and @xmath91 , @xmath92 , where @xmath93 is the bohr radius , @xmath94 and @xmath95 are the coefficients of decomposition .",
    "( here the potential inside the nucleus corresponds to the nuclear charge uniformly distributed over the spherical volume of radius @xmath23 @xcite . ) using the expansion , we can get from eq  ( [ eq : j ] ) for @xmath96 the following @xmath97 where the @xmath96 vector components are given in the polar system @xcite and correspond to transitions @xmath98 and @xmath99 accordingly . since @xmath100 and @xmath101 for @xmath102 states , then @xmath103 .    as an example we consider the known anomaly in the conversion @xmath0 transition with the energy of @xmath104 kev in @xmath105ta nucleus .",

    "the radiation nuclear matrix element of this transition is forbidden by asymptotic quantum numbers , while the anomalous one is allowed @xcite .",
    "however , the selection rules for the operator @xmath110 in eq  ( [ eq : operat - an ] ) forbid the anomaly nuclear transition in @xmath105ta @xcite .",
    "therefore we can infer that the anomaly results just from the interaction of the transition cyclo - toroid moment with the vortex part of the penetrating electron current .    in order to determine @xmath60",

    "for @xmath105ta nucleus the following is true : @xmath123 @xmath124/gev if the radius of a nucleus with atomic number @xmath125 is @xmath126 fm . using eq  ( [ eq : ct - reduced ] ) one can estimate the value @xmath127 for the anomalous conversion @xmath0(482 kev ) transition : @xmath128 .",
    "the cyclo - toroid moment is a pseudovector . atomic nuclei ,",
    "like some other objects , for example , nucleons , can have a static cyclo - toroid moment in the ground state .",
    "the value of a @xmath48 for nucleus should not depend on the fermi coupling constant @xmath129 of the weak interaction , unlike the static toroid moment ( the latter as a rule arises due to the parity violation for the nuclear forces and contains @xmath129 @xcite ) .",
    "another positive aspect is the geometric factor similar to the one considered for toroid moments in ref .",

    "the dependence of the energy on the electron spin projection @xmath134 and on the value of the cyclo - toroid moment @xmath135 ( here and further @xmath135 is measured in @xmath136 units ) can be found from the following formula : @xmath137 that can be obtained from eqs  ( [ eq : hint ] ) and ( [ eq : curlj ] ) , if one uses the @xmath138 wave function for the initial and the final state simultaneously , and takes into account the relation @xmath139 , where @xmath140 is the electron mass .",

    "it is important to note the following . the system depicted in fig .",
