    "current approximation techniques for dynamical systems include gaussian approximations @xcite , phase - space particle filters @xcite , hilbert - space truncation @xcite , and manifold learning @xcite , but these techniques provide little assurance about their actual errors and often remain too expensive to compute for real - time control of high - dimensional systems .",
    "another problem with optimal inference and the associated stochastic - master - equation approach is its reliance on a markovian model , which is difficult to use for many complex systems , especially those with @xmath0 or fractional noise statistics . with the ongoing trend of increasing complexity in quantum experiments , not only with condensed matter but also with optomechanics @xcite , atomic ensembles @xcite , and superconducting circuits @xcite",
