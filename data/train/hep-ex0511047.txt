    "in order to understand inclusive diffraction fully , it is necessary to separate out the contributions from transversely and longitudinally polarised exchange photons . here , the formalism of @xcite is adopted , where by analogy with inclusive scattering and neglecting weak interactions , a reduced cross section @xmath2 is defined , .",
    "the superscript @xmath3 usually included for @xmath4 and other quantities is dropped for convenience . ]",
    "related to the experimentally measured cross section by @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "the structure function @xmath0 , is closely related to the longitudinal photon contribution , whereas the more familiar @xmath7 contains information on the sum of transverse and longitudinal photon contributions .",
    "it is generally understood @xcite that at high @xmath8 and low - to - moderate @xmath9 , @xmath2 receives a significant , perhaps dominant , higher twist contribution due to longitudinally polarised photons .",
    "definite predictions @xcite exist for this contribution , obtained by assuming 2-gluon exchange , with a similar phenomenology to that successfully applied to vector meson cross sections at hera . the dominant role played by gluons in the diffractive parton densities",
    "@xcite implies that the leading twist @xmath0 must also be relatively large .",
    "assuming the validity of qcd hard scattering collinear factorisation @xcite , this gluon dominance results in a leading twist @xmath0 which is approximately proportional to the diffractive gluon density .",
    "a measurement of @xmath0 to even modest precision would provide a very powerful independent tool to verify our understanding of the underlying dynamics and to test the gluon density extracted indirectly in qcd fits from the scaling violations of @xmath7 .",
    "this is particularly important at the lowest @xmath10 values , where direct information on the gluon density can not be obtained from jet or @xmath11 data due to kinematic limitations and where novel effects such as parton saturation or non - dglap dynamics are most likely to become important .",
    "several different methods have been proposed to extract information on @xmath0 .",
    "it is possible in principle to follow the procedure adopted by h1 in the inclusive case @xcite , exploiting the decrease in @xmath2 at large @xmath12 relative to expectations for @xmath7 alone ( see equation  [ sigmar ] ) .",
    "this method may yield significant results if sufficient precision and @xmath12 range can be achieved @xcite , though assumptions are required on the @xmath13 dependence of @xmath7 , which is currently not well constrained by theory .",
    "an alternative method , exploiting the azimuthal decorrelation between the proton and electron scattering planes caused by interference between the transverse and longitudinal photon contributions @xcite , has already been used with the scattered proton measured in the zeus lps @xcite . however , due to the relatively poor statistical precision achievable with roman pots at hera - i , the current results are consistent with zero .",
    "if the potential of the h1 vfps is fully realised , this method may yet yield significant results in the hera - ii data @xcite .",
    "however , if the necessary data are taken , the most promising possibility is to extract @xmath0 by comparing data at the same @xmath9 , @xmath8 and @xmath13 , but from different centre of mass energies @xmath14 and hence from different @xmath12 values . the longitudinal structure function",
    "can then be extracted directly and model - independently from the measured data using equation  [ sigmar ] . in this contribution ,",
    "one possible scenario is investigated , based on modified beam energies and luminosities which are currently under discussion as a possible part of the hera - ii programme .",
    "given the need to obtain a large integrated luminosity at the highest possible beam energy for the remainder of the hera programme and the fixed end - point in mid 2007 , it is likely that only a relatively small amount of data can be taken with reduced beam energies .",
    "a possible scenario is investigated here in which @xmath15 are taken at just one reduced proton beam energy of @xmath16 , the electron beam energy being unchanged at @xmath17 .",
    "since the maximum achievable instantaneous luminosity at hera scales like the proton beam energy squared @xcite , this data sample could be obtained in around 2 - 3 months at the current level of hera performance .",
    "it is assumed that a larger data volume of @xmath18 is available at @xmath19 , which allows for downscaling of high rate low @xmath9 inclusive triggers .",
    "is taken in a short , dedicated run , could potentially lead to better controlled systematics at the expense of increased statistical errors . ] the results presented here can be used to infer those from other scenarios given that the statistical uncertainty scales like @xmath20 , where @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the reduced cross section and the luminosity at a proton beam energy of @xmath23 , respectively .",
    "the longitudinal structure function can be extracted from the data at the two beam energies using @xmath24 where @xmath25 and @xmath26 denote @xmath12 and @xmath27 at a beam energy @xmath23 .",
    "it is clear from equation  [ eqn : fld ] that the best sensitivity to @xmath0 requires the maximum difference between the reduced cross sections at the two beam energies , which ( equation  [ sigmar ] ) implies the maximum possible @xmath12 at @xmath16 . by measuring scattered electrons with energies @xmath28 as low as @xmath29 @xcite",
    ", the h1 collaboration has obtained data at @xmath30 .",
    "this is possible with the use of the spacal calorimeter in combination with a measurement of the electron track in either the backward silicon tracker ( bst ) or the central jet chamber ( cjc ) . for hera - ii running ,",
    "the corresponding available range of scattered electron polar angle is @xmath31 , which is used in the current study . with",
    "the vertex shifted by @xmath32 in the outgoing proton direction , which would allow measurements up to @xmath33 , giving a low @xmath9 acceptance range which closely matches that for the @xmath16 data at the normal vertex position . ]",
    "three intervals in @xmath12 are considered , corresponding at @xmath16 to @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "it is ensured that identical ranges in @xmath8 , @xmath13 and @xmath9 are studied at @xmath19 by choosing the bin edges such that @xmath37 . since the highest possible precision is required in this measurement , the restriction @xmath38 is imposed , which leads to negligible acceptance losses with a typical cut on the forwardmost extent of the diffractive system @xmath39 .",
    "the kinematic restrictions on @xmath28 , @xmath40 and @xmath13 lead to almost no change in the mean @xmath9 , @xmath41 or @xmath42 as either @xmath12 or @xmath23 are varied .",
    "in contrast , @xmath43 varies approximately as @xmath44 .",
    "as is shown in figure  [ kinplane ] , at the average @xmath45 , there is at least partial acceptance for all @xmath12 bins in the range @xmath46 , which is chosen for this study , leading to an average value of @xmath9 close to @xmath47 .",
    "( 100,65 )    ( -25,-10 ) ( 60,-10 )    the simulation is performed using the rapgap @xcite monte carlo generator to extract the number of events per unit luminosity in each bin at each centre of mass energy .",
    "the values of @xmath7 and @xmath0 , and hence @xmath48 and @xmath49 are obtained using an updated version of the preliminary h1 2002 nlo qcd fit @xcite .",
    "the expected precision on @xmath0 is obtained by error propagation through equation  [ eqn : fld ] .",
    "the systematic uncertainties are estimated on the basis of previous experience with the h1 detector @xcite . at the large @xmath12 values involved ,",
    "the kinematic variables are most accurately reconstructed using the electron energy and angle alone .",
    "the systematic uncertainties on the measurements of these quantities are assumed to be correlated between the two beam energies . with the use of the bst and cjc ,",
    "the possible bias in the measurement of @xmath40 is at the level of @xmath50 .",
    "the energy scale of the spacal calorimeter is known with a precision varying linearly from 2% at @xmath51 to 0.2% at @xmath52 .",
    "other uncertainties which are correlated between the two beam energies arise from the photoproduction background subtraction ( important at large @xmath12 and assumed to be known with a precision of @xmath53 ) and the energy scale for the hadronic final state used in the reconstruction of @xmath54 and hence @xmath13 ( taken to be known to 4% , as currently ) .",
    "sources of uncertainty which are assumed to be uncorrelated between the low and high @xmath23 measurements are the luminosity measurement ( taken to be @xmath55 ) , the trigger and electron track efficiencies ( @xmath55 combined ) and the acceptance corrections , obtained using rapgap ( @xmath56 ) .",
    "the combined uncorrelated error is thus @xmath57 .",
    "finally , a normalisation uncertainty of @xmath58 due to corrections for proton dissociation contributions is taken to act simultaneously in the two measurements .",
    "other sources of uncertainty currently considered in h1 measurements of diffraction are negligible in the kinematic region studied here .",
    ".summary of the simulation at @xmath59 and @xmath45 .",
    "the first three columns contain the @xmath12 ranges used at @xmath16 and @xmath19 and the @xmath13 values .",
    "the next two columns contain the values of the diffractive structure functions .",
    "these are followed by the uncorrelated ( @xmath60 ) and proton dissociation ( @xmath61 ) uncertainties and the correlated systematics due to the electron energy ( @xmath62 ) and angle ( @xmath63 ) measurements , the hadronic energy scale ( @xmath64 ) and the photoproduction background ( @xmath65 ) , all in percent .",

    "are given in table  [ table : fld ] .",
    "an illustration of the corresponding expected measurement , based on the @xmath0 from the h1 2002 fit is shown in figure  [ fig : fldshow ] .",
    "the most precise measurement is obtained at the highest @xmath12 , where @xmath0 would be determined to be unambiguously different from its maximum value of @xmath7 and to be non - zero at the @xmath1 level .",
    "two further measurements are obtained at lower @xmath12 values .",
    "the dominant errors arise from statistical uncertainties and from uncertainties which are uncorrelated between the two beam energies .",
    "minimising the latter is a major experimental challenge to be addressed in the coming years .",
    "only one possible scenario has been investigated here , leading to a highly encouraging result at relatively low @xmath8 , which would provide a very good test of the leading twist @xmath0 and thus of the gluon density extracted in qcd fits to @xmath7 .",
    "it may also be possible to obtain results at high @xmath8 , giving information on the higher twist contributions in that region , for example by restricting the analysis to lower @xmath13 .",
