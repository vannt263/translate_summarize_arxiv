    "in the classical statistical estimation problem , the starting point is a family @xmath0 of probability measures depending on the parameter @xmath1 belonging to some subset @xmath2 of a finite - dimensional euclidean space .",
    "each @xmath0 is the distribution of a random element .",
    "it is assumed that a realization of one random element corresponding to one value @xmath3 of the parameter is observed , and the objective is to estimate the values of this parameter from the observations .",
    "the intuition is to select the value @xmath1 corresponding to the random element that is _ most likely _ to produce the observations .",
    "a rigorous mathematical implementation of this idea leads to the notion of the regular statistical model @xcite : the statistical model ( or estimation problem ) @xmath4 , is called regular , if the following two conditions are satisfied :    * there exists a probability measure @xmath5 such that all measures @xmath0 are absolutely continuous with respect to @xmath5 ; * the density @xmath6 , called the likelihood ratio , has a special property , called local asymptotic normality .    if at least one of the above conditions is violated , the problem is called singular .    in regular models ,",
    "the estimator @xmath7 of the unknown parameter is constructed by maximizing the likelihood ratio and is called the maximum likelihood estimator ( mle ) . since , as a rule , @xmath8 , the consistency of the estimator is studied , that is , the convergence of @xmath7 to @xmath9 as more and more information becomes available . in",
    "all known regular statistical problems , the amount of information can be increased in one of two ways : ( a ) increasing the sample size , for example , the observation time interval ( large sample asymptotic ) ; ( b ) reducing the amplitude of noise ( small noise asymptotic ) .",
    "the asymptotic behavior of @xmath7 in both cases is well - studied .",
    "it is also known that many other estimators in regular models are asymptotically equivalent to the mle .",
    "while all regular models are in a sense the same , each singular model is different .",
    "sometimes , it is possible to approximate a singular model with a sequence of regular models . for each regular model , an mle is constructed , and then in the limit one can often get the true value of the parameter while both the sample size and the noise amplitude are fixed . some singular models can not be approximated by a sequence of regular models and admit estimators that have nothing to do with the mle @xcite . in this paper , section [ subsection - exact ] , we introduce a completely new type of such estimators for a large class of singular models .",
    "infinite - dimensional stochastic evolution equations , that is , stochastic evolution equations in infinite - dimensional spaces , are a rich source of statistical problems , both regular and singular .",
    "a typical example is the it equation @xmath10 where @xmath11 , \\",
    "\\mathcal{a}_0 , \\",
    "\\mathcal{a}_1 , \\",
    "\\mathcal{m}_j$ ] are linear operators , @xmath12 are adapted processes , @xmath13 are independent wiener processes , and @xmath1 is the unknown parameter belonging to an open subset of the real line .",
    "the underlying assumption is that the solution @xmath14 exists , is unique , and can be observed as an infinite - dimensional object for all @xmath15 $ ] .",
    "depending on the operators in the equation , the estimation model can be regular , a singular limit of regular problems , or completely singular .",
    "if @xmath16 are partial differential or pseudo - differential operators , becomes a stochastic partial differential equation ( spde ) , which is becoming increasingly popular for modelling various phenomena in fluid mechanics @xcite , oceanography @xcite , temperature anomalies @xcite , finance @xcite , and other domains .",

    "depending on the operators , is classified as follows :    * * diagonalizable equation * , if the operators @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and @xmath21 , @xmath22 , have a common system of eigenfunctions @xmath23 , and this system is an orthonormal basis in a suitable hilbert space . *",
    "* non - diagonalizable equation * otherwise .",
    "a diagonalizable equation is reduced to an infinite system of _ uncoupled _ one - dimensional diffusion processes ; these processes are the fourier coefficients of the solution in the basis @xmath24 . as a result , while somewhat restrictive as a modelling tool , diagonalizable equations are an extremely convenient object to study estimation problems and often provide the benchmark results that carry over to more general equations .",
    "the parameter estimation problem for a diagonalizable equation with additive space - time white noise ( that is , @xmath25 and @xmath17 for all @xmath18 ) was studied for the first time by huebner , khasminskii , and rozovskii @xcite , and further investigated in @xcite .",
    "the main feature of this problem is that every @xmath26-dimensional projection of the equation leads to a regular statistical problem , but the problem can become singular in the limit @xmath27 ( a singular limit of regular problems ) ; when this happens , the dimension @xmath26 of the projection becomes a natural asymptotic parameter of the problem .",
    "once the diagonalizable model is well - understood , extensions to more general equations can be considered ( @xcite ) .",
    "this paper is the first attempt to investigate the estimation problem for infinite - dimensional bilinear equations .",
    "such models are often completely singular , that is , can not be represented as a limit of regular models .",
    "we consider the more tractable situation of diagonalizable equations . in section [ section - settings ]",
    "we provide the necessary background on stochastic evolution equations , with emphasis on diagonalizable bilinear equations .",
    "the maximum likelihood estimator ( mle ) and its modifications for diagonalizable bilinear equations are studied in section [ section - estimates ] .",
    "we give sufficient conditions on operators @xmath28 that ensure consistency and asymptotic normality of the mle .",
    "we also demonstrate that the mle in this model is not always the best estimator , which , for a singular model is not at all surprising .",
    "section [ subsection - exact ] emphasizes the point even more by introducing a closed - form exact estimator . due to the specific structure of stochastic term , for a large class of infinite - dimensional systems with finite - dimensional noise",
    ", one can get the _",
    "exact _ value of the unknown parameter after a finite number of arithmetic manipulations with the observations .",
    "the very existence of such estimators in these models is rather remarkable and has no analogue in classical statistics .    as an illustration ,",
    "let @xmath1 be a positive number , @xmath29 a standard wiener process , and consider the it equation @xmath30 with zero boundary conditions . if @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 then @xmath34 and each @xmath35 is a geometric brownian motion : @xmath36 we assume that @xmath37 for all @xmath38 . in sections [ section - estimates ] and [ subsection - exact ] we establish the following result .",
    "if the solution of equation is observed in the form , then the parameter @xmath1 can be computed in each of the following ways :    1 .",

    "@xmath42 for every @xmath41 and @xmath43 .",
    "both ( e1 ) and ( e2 ) are essentially the same maximum likelihood estimator , but the infinite - dimensional nature of the equation makes it possible to study this estimator in two different asymptotic regimes .",
    "( e3 ) is a closed - form exact estimator .",
    "while it is most likely to be the best choice for this particular problem , we show in section [ subsection - exact ] that computational complexity of closed - form exact estimators can dramatically increase with the number of wiener processes driving the equation , while the complexity of the mle is almost unaffected by this number .",
    "the result is another unexpected feature of closed - form exact estimators : ever though they produce the exact value of the parameter , they are not always the best choice computationally .",

    "<S> a parameter estimation problem is considered for a stochastic parabolic equation with multiplicative noise under the assumption that the equation can be reduced to an infinite system of uncoupled diffusion processes . from the point of view of classical statistics , this problem turns out to be singular not only for the original infinite - dimensional system but also for most finite - dimensional projections . </S>",
    "<S> this singularity can be exploited to improve the rate of convergence of traditional estimators as well as to construct completely new closed - form exact estimator . </S>"
