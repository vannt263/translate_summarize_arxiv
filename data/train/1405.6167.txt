    "hardy s inequality is one of the classical items in analysis @xcite .",
    "two milestones among many others in the development of the theory seem to be the result of necas @xcite that hardy s inequality holds on strongly lipschitz domains and the insight of mazya @xcite , ( * ? ? ?",
    "2.3 ) that its validity depends on measure theoretic conditions on the domain . rather recently",
    ", the geometric framework in which hardy s inequality remains valid was enlarged up to the frontiers of what is possible  as long as the boundary condition is purely dirichlet , see @xcite , compare also @xcite . moreover , over the last years it became manifest that hardy s inequality plays an eminent role in modern pde theory , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "what has not been treated systematically is the case where _ only a part _ @xmath0 of the boundary of the underlying domain @xmath1 is involved , reflecting the dirichlet condition of the equation on this part  while on @xmath2 other boundary conditions may be imposed , compare @xcite including references therein .",
    "the aim of this paper is to set up a geometric framework for the domain @xmath1 and the dirichlet boundary part @xmath0 that allow to deduce the corresponding hardy inequality @xmath3 as in the well established case @xmath4 we in essence only require that @xmath0 is @xmath5-thick in the sense of @xcite . in our context",
    "this condition can be understood as an extremely weak compatibility condition between @xmath0 and @xmath6 .",
    "our strategy of proof is first to reduce to the case @xmath4 by purely topological means , provided two major tools are applicable : an extension operator @xmath7 , the subscript @xmath0 indicating the subspace of those sobolev functions which vanish on @xmath0 in an appropriate sense , and a poincar inequality on @xmath8 .",
    "this abstract result is established in section  [ sec - proof ] . in a second step in sections  [ extens ] and [ sec - poincare ]",
    "these partly implicit conditions are substantiated by more geometric assumptions that can be checked  more or less  by appearance . in particular",
    ", we prove that under the mere assumption that @xmath0 is closed , every linear continuous extension operator @xmath9 that is constructed by the usual procedure of gluing together local extension operators preserves the dirichlet condition on @xmath0 .",
    "this result even carries over to higher - order sobolev spaces and sheds new light on some of the deep results on sobolev extension operators obtained in @xcite .",
    "it is of course natural to ask , whether hardy s inequality also characterizes the space @xmath8 , i.e.  whether the latter is precisely the space of those functions @xmath10 for which @xmath11 belongs to @xmath12 . under very mild geometric assumptions we answer this question to the affirmative in section  [ sec - conv - hardy ] .    finally ,",
    "in section  [ sec - general ] we attend to the naive intuition that the part of @xmath13 that is far away from @xmath0 should only be circumstantial for the validity of hardy s inequality and in fact we succeed to weaken the previously discussed geometric assumptions considerably .",
    "throughout we work in euclidean space @xmath14 , @xmath15 .",
    "we use @xmath16 , @xmath17 , etc .  for vectors in @xmath14 and denote the open ball in @xmath14 around @xmath16 with radius @xmath18 by @xmath19 .",
    "the letter @xmath20 is reserved for generic constants that may change their value from occurrence to occurrence . given @xmath21 we write @xmath22 for the function that measures the distance to @xmath23 and @xmath24 for the diameter of @xmath23 .    in our main results on hardy s inequality we denote the underlying domain and its dirichlet part by @xmath1 and @xmath0 .",
    "the various side results that are interesting in themselves and drop off on the way are identified by the use of @xmath25 and @xmath26 instead .",
    "next , let us introduce the common first - order sobolev spaces of functions ` vanishing ' on a part of the closure of the underlying domain that are most essential for the formulation of hardy s inequality .",

    "the situation we have in mind is of course when @xmath35 and @xmath36 is the dirichlet part @xmath0 of the boundary @xmath13 .",
    "as usual , the sobolev spaces @xmath37 are defined as the space of those @xmath38 functions whose distributional derivatives up to order @xmath39 are in @xmath38 , equipped with the natural norm .",

    "in fact the second condition is equivalent to the validity of poincar s inequality @xmath61 that is clearly _ necessary _ for hardy s inequality .",
