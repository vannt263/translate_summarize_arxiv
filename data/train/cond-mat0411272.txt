    "structures with spatially modulated dielectric properties ( photonic crystals ) attract an ever growing interest since the first papers where they were considered.@xcite this interest is caused by unique opportunities that such structures provide , to affect , in a controllable way , fundamental _ microscopic _ processes of light - matter interaction through a modification of _ macroscopic _ geometric characteristics of the structures .",
    "this makes such structures of obvious interest not only for fundamental physics but also for applications .",
    "most of the works devoted to photonic crystals considered structures made of materials with a frequency independent dielectric constant.@xcite recently , however , a new class of structures , which can be described as resonant or optically active photonic crystals , has attracted particular attention . in these structures",
    "periodic modulation of the dielectric constant is accompanied by the presence of internal excitations of constituent materials resonantly interacting with light within a certain frequency region , and resulting in a strong frequency dispersion of constituent dielectric constants .",
    "extreme cases of such structures are so called optical lattices , in which well localized resonant elements are periodically distributed through the medium with a uniform dielectric constant .",
    "originally , the concept of optical lattices referred to structures formed by cold atoms,@xcite but it was also applied to a special kind of multiple quantum well structure ( mqw ) , which were considered as a semiconductor analog of a one - dimensional optical lattice.@xcite    mqw is a periodic multilayer structure built of two semiconductor materials , for instance , gaas and al@xmath0ga@xmath1as , in which electrons and holes are confined in narrower layers of a material with a smaller band gap ( quantum wells ) separated by wide layers of a semiconductor with larger band - gap ( barriers ) . in this case , the role of dipole active resonant excitations is played by excitons confined to respective quantum wells , and if the width of the barriers is large enough , excitons from different quantum wells do not interact directly .",
    "they , however , still can interact through their common radiation field , and in this sense they are similar to atomic optical lattices .",
    "this analogy is , however , exact only if one can neglect a difference in refractive indexes of wells and barriers .",
    "this approximation was widely used in most papers devoted to long - period mqw structures , in which the period of the structure is comparable with the wavelength of exciton radiation.@xcite of special interest are so called bragg structures , in which the excitonic wavelength is in bragg resonance with the periodicity , and which are characterized by a significantly enhanced radiative coupling between quantum well excitons . as a result of this coupling , light propagates through such a structure in the form exciton - polaritons ,",
    "whose dispersion law is characterized by two branches with a band - gap between them@xcite .",
    "the width of this stop band is significantly enhanced compared to off - bragg structures , and this is what makes such structures of particular interest for applications .",
    "in realistic mqw structures , however , dielectric constants of the wells and barriers are not equal to each other , and the presence of resonant optical excitations is accompanied by a periodic modulation of the background dielectric constant .",
    "these structures , therefore , represent a special case of one - dimensional resonant photonic crystals , optical properties of which are characterized by an interplay between interface reflections and resonant light - exciton interaction .",
    "the effects of the refractive index contrast on the optical properties of mqw structures have not been , of course , overlooked in previous studies . in particular ,",
    "a modification of the bragg condition and reflection spectra at normal incidence of bragg mqws in the presence of the contrast have been discussed in refs .  .",
    "the effects of the dielectric mismatch on optical properties of single quantum wells @xcite or an mqw structure embedded in a dielectric environment@xcite was also taken into account . however , a complete analytical theory of mqw based photonic crystals has not yet been developed .",
    "while optical spectra of any given mqw based structure can be easily obtained numerically , this is not sufficient when one needs to design a structure with predetermined optical properties , which is a key element in utilizing these structures for optoelectronic applications .",
    "the main difficulty of this task is the presence of a large number of experimental parameters such as an angle of incidence , a polarization state , indices of refraction , widths of the barriers and the quantum wells , etc , which are in a complicated way related to spectral characteristics of a structure . in order to resolve this difficulty",
    ", one needs a general effective analytical approach that would facilitate establishing relationships between material parameters and spectral properties of mqw based structures for an arbitrary angle of incidence and polarization state of incoming light . in the present paper",
    "we develop such a method and apply it to a case of mqw structure with an intentionally broken periodicity ( an mqw structure with a  defect \" ) .",
    "the method is based on a transfer matrix approach and consists of two steps . in the first step",
    "we show that a quantum well embedded in a dielectric environment can be described in exactly the same way as a quantum well in vacuum by introducing an effective excitonic susceptibility and an effective optical width of the quantum well layer . in the second step",
    "we establish relations between these effective quantum well characteristics and parameters of a total transfer matrix , describing propagation of light throughout an entire structure .",
    "the method is rather general and can be applied to a great variety of different mqw structures with light of an arbitrary polarization , incident at an arbitrary angle . in order to demonstrate the power of our approach",
    ", we consider reflection spectra of an mqw structure in which a central well is replaced with a well having a different resonant frequency .",
    "such structures have been considered previously in a number of papers @xcite in the optical lattice approximation . here",
    "we show that the presence of the refractive index contrast does not destroy the remarkable reflection properties of such structures , confirming , therefore , their potential for optoelectronic applications .",
    "propagation of the electromagnetic wave in structures under discussion is governed by the maxwell equation @xmath2,\\ ] ] with modulated background dielectric permeability , @xmath3 , which is assumed to take values @xmath4 and @xmath5 in the barriers and the quantum wells materials respectively . for the sake of concreteness",

    ", the propagation of the electromagnetic wave along the structure can be effectively described by a transfer - matrix . using the usual maxwell boundary conditions the transfer matrix through one period of the structure in the basis of incoming and outgoing plane waves",
    "can be written in the form @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the transfer matrix through the halves of the barriers surrounding the quantum well . here",

    "the scattering of the electromagnetic wave at the interface between the quantum well and the barrier caused by the mismatch of the indices of refraction of their materials is described by @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the fresnel reflection coefficient .",
    "the interface scattering depends upon both the angle of incidence of the wave and its polarization state .",
    "these effects are effectively described by fresnel coefficients ( see , e.g. ref . ) @xmath27 and @xmath28 @xmath29 for @xmath30 ( @xmath31 ) and @xmath32 ( @xmath33 ) polarizations respectively .",

    "here @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is the width of the quantum well and @xmath38 is the angle between @xmath22 inside the quantum well and @xmath24 .",
    "the excitonic contribution to the scattering of the light is described by the function @xmath39 which we will call the excitonic susceptibility in what follows .",
    "the radiative decay rate , @xmath40 , at normal incidence is determined by @xmath41    for oblique incidence the radiative decay rates are renormalized in different ways for different polarizations .",
    "for @xmath32-polarization in addition to this renormalization it is also necessary to take into account a possible splitting of @xmath42- and @xmath43-exciton modes @xcite that gives rise to a two - pole form of @xmath44 .",
    "however , in materials with the zinc - blend structure , the @xmath42-mode of the heavy - hole excitons is optically inactive , and one can describe angle dependencies of the radiative decay rate for @xmath30- and @xmath32-polarizations respectively by simple expressions @xmath45    thus , propagation of light in the structures under consideration depends upon a number of natural parameters such as fresnel coefficients , exciton frequencies and radiative decay rate , and optical widths , which ( with the exception of @xmath12 ) depend upon the angle of incidence of the wave and its polarization state .",
    "our next step will be to simplify the presentation of the total transfer matrix through the period of the structure in such a way that makes the relations between the elements of the transfer matrix and the natural parameters of the structure more apparent .",
    "the most complicated part of the transfer matrix is the product @xmath46 , which describes the reflection of the wave from the interface and its interaction with quantum well excitons .",
    "we simplify it by noting that this product can be presented as @xmath47 , where @xmath48 has the same form as @xmath49 , eq .",

    "@xmath54 one can see that the total transfer matrix through the period of the structure again has the form of a single quantum well transfer matrix and is determined by ( [ eq : transfer_matrix_well ] ) where the phase @xmath52 is replaced by a total phase @xmath55 .",
    "thus , we have shown that the propagation of the wave in mqw based photonic crystals can be described in terms of properties of a respective optical lattice with renormalized parameters .",
    "the renormalization of the phase is the simplest one : the expression for @xmath52 can be rewritten as @xmath56 provided that the change of phase @xmath57 across the well is much smaller than @xmath58 , which is usually true for long period mqw structures .",
    "hence , one of the effects of the index of refraction contrast is reduced to a simple renormalization of the optical width of the quantum well .",
    "the effective susceptibility , @xmath59 , consists of two terms .",
    "one of them has a singularity at the exciton frequency while the second remains smooth in a wide frequency region .",
    "the relation between these terms depends upon the frequency and near the exciton resonance the second term is negligibly small .",
    "the frequency region where the nonsingular addition to the effective susceptibility can be neglected is determined by @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the half - width of the forbidden gap in a bragg mqw without a mismatch of the indices of refraction , and @xmath62/\\pi(1-\\rho^2)$ ] is the half - width of the forbidden gap in a passive photonic crystal characterized by the same value of the mismatch calculated with the assumption of the narrowness of the gap in comparison with the position of the center of the gap , @xmath63 .",

    "the fresnel coefficient for the normal incidence is positive and therefore the oscillator strength is diminished compared to the case of the absence of the contrast . when the angle of incidence increases , in addition to different dependencies of the fresnel coefficients corresponding to different polarization states following from eqs .",
    "( [ eq : fresnel_coefficients_vals ] ) , it is necessary to take into account direct modification of the oscillator strength given by eqs .  ( [ eq : gamma_sp_oblique ] ) . fig .",

    "therefore , under these circumstances the mismatch of the indices of refraction can be treated perturbatively , so that all results neglecting the mismatch remain valid up to renormalization of the oscillator strength . however , when the number of quantum wells in an mqw structure increases , the frequency region affected by excitons widens almost linearly,@xcite and , therefore , the regular contribution to the effective susceptibility becomes important , and more detailed analysis is necessary .    keeping in mind subsequent application to more complicated structures ,",

    "the formalism presented in this paper allows one to take into account effects of homogeneous and inhomogeneous broadenings because the main results obtained do not use a particular form of the excitonic susceptibility .",
    "for example , the reflection coefficient of a structure with an inhomogeneous broadening can be obtained in the effective medium approximation by using eq .",
    "( [ eq : reflectivity_m_general ] ) with @xmath151 instead of @xmath44 and with inhomogeneously broadened @xmath164 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : reflection_drop_general ] ) : @xmath165 where @xmath166 are the distribution functions of the exciton frequencies in the host and defect layers .",
    "respectively@xcite however , as has been discussed in ref .  ,",
    "if @xmath162 is far enough from @xmath146 , i.e. if @xmath167 , where @xmath168 is the inhomogeneous broadening , the effect of the latter is negligible and the magnitude of the reflection is determined by @xmath169\\ ] ] and is small provided the smallness of the homogeneous broadening , @xmath170 , and @xmath171 .    a typical form of the reflection in the vicinity of this resonant drop has been discussed in refs . .",
    "here we would like to note that for multiple defect structures composed of several blocks @xmath120 considered above the reflection can be qualitatively described by eq .",
    "( [ eq : reflectivity_m_bragg ] ) where @xmath92 is understood as the number of such blocks .",
    "this expression shows that increasing @xmath92 can be interpreted as increasing an effective radiative decay rate .",
    "this qualitatively explains the results of numerical calculations in where it was found that the maximal value of the reflection increases with @xmath92 while the value of the contrast remains about the same .",
    "in the present paper , the general problem of light propagation in an mqw based photonic crystal characterized by both spatial modulation of the dielectric constant , and dipole active exciton states in quantum wells , is considered .",
    "it is shown that the mismatch of indices of refraction between barriers and wells can be taken into account by introduction of an effective excitonic susceptibility and an effective optical width of the quantum wells .",
    "the effective susceptibility has two terms , one of which is almost independent of frequency , while the second is resonant in nature . for short enough mqw structures ( or in the vicinity of the exciton frequency )",
    "the regular term can be neglected and the effect of the mismatch of the indices of refraction reduces to a modification of the excitonic oscillator strength . in a general case ,",
    "the reflection spectrum becomes essentially asymmetric and non - trivially dependent upon the number of quantum wells in the structure .",
    "it is shown that in order to obtain the strongest exciton induced reflection band the structure must satisfy a certain resonance condition .",
    "this is a bragg resonance condition between the period of the mqw structures and the wavelength of the electromagnetic wave .",
    "the latter has to be calculated from a dispersion law for a structure with the spatially modulated refraction index .",
    "the developed approach is applied to analysis of the reflection spectrum of a structure with an intentionally introduced defect element , which breaks the translational symmetry of a system .",
    "more detailed analysis is carried out for a special kind of defect , characterized by the presence of a layer in the middle of the structure with a different frequency of the exciton resonance .",
    "it is shown that the main characteristics of the reflection spectrum of such structures obtained in the absence of the refraction index contrast survive in the presence of the additional interface reflections .",
    "in particular , a significant decrease of the reflection takes place even in the presence of the contrast , which is important for possible applications of such structures .",
