    "schrdinger s cat sums up one of the most striking and counter - intuitive features of quantum systems that is the ability to exist in coherent superpositions of states , which , in the classical world , would mutually exclude each other .",
    "while the conceptual ambiguities arising due to this phenomenon have been highly debated in the early days of quantum mechanics , during the last decades , it has been pointed out that quantum coherence might serve as valuable resource , especially for information processing . among the first suggestions in this direction were the brassard - bennett protocol and the deutsch ",
    "jozsa algorithm promising respectively intrinsically eavesdrop - secure communication and an exponential speedup of computation by exploiting the quantum superposition principle @xcite .",
    "although theses schemes are of little practical use so far , they reveal the enormous potential of quantum technologies , which nowadays becomes all the more significant due to recent experiments showing the accessibility of quantum effects even under ambient conditions @xcite .",
    "information thermodynamics @xcite provides another , yet much less explored , area of research , which might benefit from the utilization of quantum coherence .",
    "the development of this field was originally triggered by maxwell s famous thought experiment challenging the second law by invoking a small intelligent being , which is able to separate the molecules of a gas in thermal equilibrium according to their velocity , thus establishing a spontaneous temperature gradient @xcite .",
    "building on maxwell s idea , szilrd invented a microscopic engine consisting of a single molecule confined in a container , which is in contact with a thermal reservoir of constant temperature @xcite .",
    "an external agent might operate this setup by first dividing the container in two chambers , second , detecting the position of the molecule and , third , adiabatically expanding the chamber the molecule was found in , thus extracting work from a single heat bath .",
    "half a century after its discovery , this apparent contradiction with the second law was resolved by bennett @xcite , who showed that , due to landauer s principle @xcite , the reduction of entropy associated with the measurement in the second step must be eventually compensated when the external agent discards the gathered information from its memory , which can not be inexhaustible .",
    "hence , effectively , the information acquired during the measurement is converted into work .",
    "meanwhile a fairly complete and experimentally confirmed theoretical framework exists @xcite at least for classical systems , which , on a general level , provides precise extensions of the second law accounting for information as a physical quantity thus relating it to traditional thermodynamic variables such as entropy and work .    in the quantum realm ,",
    "additional intricacies arise , which are not yet fully explored @xcite .",
    "as a consequence of the superposition principle even the hilbert space of a simple two - level system ( tls ) contains infinitely many orthonormal pairs of realizable states , each of which is associated with a specific observable , which , in principle , might be measured . moreover , according to the projection postulate , a measurement will typically alter the state of the system and thereby its mean energy .",
    "therefore , in strong contrast to the classical case , a projective quantum measurement is not only accompanied by a decrease in entropy but also by an intrinsic change in internal energy , which must be taken into account for thermodynamic considerations .",
    "jacobs argued that this energetic cost should be attributed to the external observer and derived an inequality , which incorporates it in an upper bound on the work extractable from a quantum system in thermal equilibrium after a single measurement @xcite .",
    "here , we go one step further by relaxing the assumption on the initial state and allowing multiple measurements in finite intervals . using a simple argument based on the first and the second law ,",
    "we show that jacobs bound holds whenever the probability to obtain a certain outcome does not change from one measurement to the next .",
    "this result , in particular , implies a bound on the average work delivered by information driven quantum engines operating periodically and in finite time .",
    "moreover , it provides a natural definition for the efficiency of such machines .",
    "one of the first specific , fully quantum mechanical models for a measurement controlled device was proposed by lloyd @xcite . in the spirit of szilrd",
    "s pioneering work , he considers a single spin@xmath0 system in contact with a thermal heat bath .",
    "an external controller can extract work in form of photons from this system by measuring the energy of the spin and applying a @xmath1-pulse at the larmor frequency if the excited state is detected .",
    "after the spin - flip , or , if initially the ground state was observed , the system is allowed to return to thermal equilibrium , before the procedure repeats .",
    "lloyd demonstrates that his engine can completely convert the information acquired by the measurement into work .",
    "furthermore , he argues that the efficiency of this process will inevitably decrease , due to decoherence effects , if any observable different from energy is used to determine the state of the system .",
    "however , his reasoning strongly relies on the assumption that the spin has relaxed to thermal equilibrium before any measurement , which , in fact , would require an infinite waiting time .    in this work , by generalizing the setup described above , we show that triggering a laser pulse by measuring an observable that does not commute with the hamiltonian of the system can enhance the efficiency if the model is operated in finite time .",
    "specifically , we investigate a quantum - optical tls , whose relaxation dynamics is modeled using a quantum master equation . after a projective von - neumann measurement , the system is assumed to be detached from the heat bath such that its time evolution during the laser pulse is governed by a time - dependent schrdinger equation .",
    "we note that such a separation of system and environment has recently been argued to be realistic in the context of quantum heat engines @xcite . for our model",
    ", we analytically calculate the time - dependent density matrix characterizing the system in the cyclic operation mode and numerically determine the optimal observable to control the feedback protocol as a function of the relaxation time and the spacing of the energy levels .",
    "our findings show that exploiting quantum coherences can enhance the efficiency of information engines beyond classically achievable values .",
    "the paper is structured as follows . as our first main result",
    ", we derive a new bound on the average work output of quantum information engines in section 2 . in section 3",
    ", we introduce a specific model for such a machine and solve its dynamics .",
    "section 4 is devoted to the optimization of its efficiency .",
    "we conclude in section 5 .",
    "we begin this section by introducing a general scheme for a cyclic quantum information engine . to this end , we consider a finite quantum system with hamiltonian @xmath2 , which is in contact with a heat bath of temperature @xmath3 and whose density matrix is initially given by @xmath4 .",
    "this setup is now operated by an external agent in two steps .",
    "first , an instantaneous projective measurement of the observable @xmath5 is carried out , which yields the outcome @xmath6 and leaves the system in the state @xmath7 with probability @xmath8 here , the @xmath6 are the eigenvalues of @xmath5 , which we assume to be non - degenerate , and @xmath9 denotes the normalized eigenvector of @xmath5 corresponding to @xmath6 .",
    "second , to convert the acquired information into useful work , a control operation is applied to the system , which is conditioned on the result of the preceding measurement and leads to the evolved density matrix @xmath10,\\ ] ] where @xmath11 , in principle , can be any positive , trace preserving map @xcite . practically , such an operation can be realized by intermediately manipulating the hamiltonian of the system or its coupling to the heat bath over a certain time interval .",
    "the agent now iterates the sequence of steps one and two , where , in the @xmath12^th^ operation cycle , the measurement outcome @xmath13 is obtained with probability @xmath14 .",
    "it is readily seen that these quantities fulfill the recursion relation @xmath15p_{m}^{(i-1)}\\ ] ] with the conditional probability @xmath16 = { \\langle\\psi_{m'}|}\\tilde{{\\rho}}_{m}{|\\psi_{m'}\\rangle }             = { \\langle\\psi_{m'}|}{\\mathcal{v}}_{m}\\big[{|\\psi_{m}\\rangle }           { \\langle\\psi_{m}|}\\big]{|\\psi_{m'}\\rangle},\\ ] ] since the initial density matrix of each cycle is the result of the control operation applied in the foregoing one , as shown in figure [ fig : flow_diag ] . moreover , since the transition probability does not depend on the cycle index @xmath12 but rather is fully determined by the control operation @xmath11 and the observable @xmath5 , after sufficiently many iterations a stationary distribution @xmath17 satisfying @xmath18q_{m}\\ ] ] will be approached .",

    "most importantly , in this regime , we find as our second main result that the efficiency is enhanced by exploiting coherences .",
    "specifically , it can overcome the quasi - classical value and even approach its upper bound @xmath134 in the limit @xmath135 .    the average work output for the optimal angle @xmath116 , @xmath136 ,",

    "clearly , this quantity features the same characteristic dependence on @xmath137 and @xmath114 as the maximized efficiency @xmath115 . like @xmath115 ,",
    "the average work @xmath138 exceeds its quasi - classical limit @xmath139 in the coherence - enhanced regime and becomes maximal in the same range of parameters like @xmath115 , i.e. , in the vicinity of the hyperbolas .    finally , we consider the average energetic cost per measurement @xmath140 .",
    "this additional input is inevitably necessary for the exploitation of quantum coherence and therefore becomes non - negligible whenever @xmath116 significantly deviates from @xmath141 , hence , in particular , in the regions of the parameter space , where our numerical procedure reveals @xmath115 to be large .",
    "consequently , in the range of high efficiencies , the input of the device is mainly delivered by the measurement apparatus rather than the heat bath .",
    "this result underlines the crucial role of the measurement process in the quantum realm , which , besides delivering information , can alter the state of the system and thus bears the character of an additional control operation .",
    "in this paper , we have derived a universal upper bound on the average work output delivered in finite time by cyclically operating quantum information engines , which takes into account the energetic cost intrinsically associated with quantum measurements .",
    "this bound provides a benchmark for the performance of quantum mechanical information - to - energy converters , which , in contrast to their classical counterparts , see for example @xcite , can exploit the superposition principle and thus might be able to overcome classical limitations .",
    "we have explicitly investigated the benefit of quantum coherences in the second part of the paper by considering a specific model consisting of a quantum optical tls , which , conditioned on the outcome of a projective measurement , is repeatedly either coupled to a heat bath or used to amplify a coherent laser pulse . in the regime of long relaxation times , this setup corresponds to a model originally proposed by lloyd , whose properties are reproduced qualitatively in our analysis within this limit .",
    "we emphasize , however , that the definition of efficiency used in @xcite is different from ours , since it explicitly refers to landauer s principle by invoking the minimal heat that must be dissipated in a second heat bath of different temperature to achieve the entropy production necessary to reset the memory of the external agent .",
    "viewed in this way , the model acts effectively as a heat engine , whose efficiency is bounded by the carnot value . in our approach , we consider the system as an information engine and define its efficiency in terms of quantities directly associated with the system and the measurement process , leaving aside how the agent eventually erases the gathered information .    in the coherent regime , which is characterized by short cycle times , we find that utilizing a non - classical observable @xmath52 , whose eigenstates are coherent superpositions of the energy eigenstates , can enhance the performance significantly . remarkably , it turns out that both , efficiency and average work output per cycle , can be substantially increased if the relaxation time is properly adjusted to the level spacing . since , in the corresponding regions of the parameter space , the optimal angle @xmath116 strongly deviates from the quasi - classical value @xmath141 and even comes close to @xmath131 , the device is then mainly supplied by the measurement apparatus rather than the heat bath . in fact , jacobs argued that , for thermodynamical consistency , this type of energy input must be considered as work rather than heat @xcite .",
    "it should , however , also be clearly distinguished from the work output extracted by external control operations . further clarification of the role of the measurement process in this context , using e.g. a scheme proposed in @xcite , constitutes an important and challenging subject for future research .",
