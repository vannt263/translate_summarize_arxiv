    "cepheids are pulsating stars with periods between one day and about one hundred days .",
    "although there was originally some confusion , see the review by @xcite , it is now believed that cepheids can be grouped into two distinct classes : classical cepheids and type ii cepheids ( t2cs , hereafter ) .",
    "the former are intermediate mass stars ( 410  @xmath1 ) , while the latters are lower - mass stars ( @xmath2 ) belonging to disc and halo populations ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "t2cs are conventionally divided into three period groups , bl  her stars ( henceforth bl ) at short periods , w  vir stars ( wv ) at intermediate periods and rv  tau stars ( rv ) at the longest periods . according to gingold  ( @xcite , @xcite ) ,",
    "the bls are stars evolving from the horizontal branch to the asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) ; the wvs are stars that along the agb cross the cepheid instability strip due to excursions towards higher effective temperatures ; the rvs are stars that after their agb phase are moving towards the white dwarf cooling sequence .",
    "however , some later evolutionary tracks ( e.g.  @xcite ) do not show the excursions , and the precise evolution state of t2cs remains unclear .",
    "we follow the division by @xcite and adopt thresholds of 4  d and 20  d to divide the three groups .",
    "the rv stars tend to show alternating deep and shallow minima ( and this is often taken as a defining characteristic ) , but the single period of the rvs will be used in this paper .",
    "in addition to these three groups , @xcite established a new group of t2cs , peculiar w  vir ( pw ) stars .",
    "they have distinctive light curves and tend to be brighter than normal t2cs of the same period .",
    "it is suggested that many , perhaps all , of them are binaries , but their nature remains uncertain .",
    "the bright galactic t2c @xmath3  pav appears to be a pw star ( matsunaga , feast & menzies , 2009 , hereafter m09 ) .",
    "@xcite  ( @xcite , hereafter m06 ) discovered a tight plr of t2cs in globular clusters based on infrared photometry for 46 t2cs .",
    "@xcite used pulsation parallaxes of nearby t2cs to calibrate this cluster plr and to discuss the distances of the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) and the galactic centre . the optical gravitational lensing experiment ( ogle - iii )",
    "have significantly increased samples of t2cs in the magellanic clouds .",
    "@xcite found 197 t2cs in the lmc .",
    "m09 investigated their near - infrared ( near - ir ) nature and confirmed that bl and wv stars follow a tight plr like that of t2cs in globular clusters , whereas rv and pw stars show a large scatter and are systematically brighter than the plr for the bl and wvs .",
    "the calibration by @xcite then leads to a distance modulus of the lmc of @xmath4  mag .",
    "these investigations have established the t2cs as a promising distance indicator .",
    "the aim of the present paper is to compare the t2c plrs in the small magellanic cloud ( smc ) , lmc and globular clusters .",
    "this is important for a further study of these relations and their possible dependence on metallicity and other factors .",
    "the ogle - iii survey discovered 43 t2cs in the smc ( @xcite , s10 hereafter ) . in the following , we first collect near - ir @xmath5 magnitudes of smc t2cs ( section  [ sec : photometry ] ) and",
    "investigate their plrs ( section  [ sec : plr ] ) .",
    "the reddening - free plr in @xmath6 is also discussed . in parallel with our work ,",
    "@xcite  ( @xcite , c10 ) have obtained independent @xmath7 and @xmath8 for a subset of the smc t2cs and their data is combined with ours in some of the discussions .",
    "we find evidence that the bl and wv stars need to be discussed independently . in section  [ sec : delmu ] the apparent differences in distance moduli of the lmc and smc are derived for these stars and compared with the differences obtained from other objects .",
    "the data used for classical cepheids are discussed in an appendix . in addition , the colours and period distributions of t2cs in various systems are compared and contrasted in sections  [ sec : evolution ] .",
    "section  [ sec : conclusion ] summarizes the present work .",
    "s10 catalogued 43  t2cs in the smc : 17  bls , 10  wvs , 7  pws and 9  rvs .",
    "we searched for near - ir counterparts of these stars in the catalogue of @xcite .",
    "this point - source catalogue is based on simultaneous images in @xmath9 obtained with the 1.4-m infrared survey facility ( irsf ) located at south african astronomical observatory ( saao ) , sutherland , south africa .",
    "the catalogue covers @xmath10 of the lmc , @xmath11 of the smc and @xmath12 of the magellanic bridge .",
    "the catalogue extends to fainter magnitudes and has higher resolution than the point - source catalogue of the two - micron all - sky survey ( 2mass ; @xcite ) in the regions of the magellanic clouds . the 10  @xmath13 limiting magnitudes of the survey in the smc are 18.9 , 17.9 and 16.9  mag for @xmath7 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "these limits are fainter than those for the lmc since the crowding effect is less @xcite .    matches between the ogle - iii and irsf catalogues were found for 39 s10 t2c sources with a tolerance of 0.5@xmath16 ( table  [ tab : catalogue ] ) .",
    "the differences in coordinates are small between the catalogues with standard deviations of less than 0.1@xmath16 in both ra and dec .",
    "four ogle - iii sources ( ids in s10 : # 5 , # 37 , # 42 and # 43 ) are located outside the irsf survey field . in the case of two matched objects , # 6 and # 22 , @xmath15-band magnitudes are missing because of the faintness of these stars , both of which are bl stars with relatively short periods ( @xmath17  d ) .",
    "although about half of the bl sample have @xmath15 fainter than the 10  @xmath13 limiting magnitude , their @xmath7 and @xmath14 magnitudes are brighter than the limits ."
