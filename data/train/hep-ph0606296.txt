    "a renormalizable extension of the standard model ( sm ) that incorporates neutrino masses can be obtained by introducing ( at least two ) sm gauge singlet fermions ",
    "right - handed neutrinos @xmath1 .",
    "neutrino masses arise due to the fact that right - handed neutrinos can couple to the left - handed ones ( @xmath2 ) through yukawa couplings .",
    "after electroweak symmetry breaking , the sm neutrinos are endowed with either majorana or dirac masses .",
    "a supersymmetric version of this scenario implies the existence of new , complex , sm gauge singlet scalar fields  the right - handed sneutrinos @xmath3 .    the right - handed neutrino superfield @xmath4 is a sm gauge singlet and is allowed to have a supersymmetry ( susy ) preserving majorana mass @xmath5 . in the usual high - scale seesaw mechanism  @xcite , @xmath5  the scale of lepton number breaking  is , in general , not related to the susy breaking scale .",
    "it is often considered to be around @xmath6gev so that , if the neutrino yukawa couplings are order one , active neutrino masses are around @xmath7ev , the scale inferred from neutrino oscillation experiments  @xcite .",
    "this scenario , while elegant , is very hard to verify experimentally and is motivated by the fact that neutrino yukawa couplings are `` naturally '' expected to be of order one .",
    "if the seesaw energy scale is indeed very high , right - handed sneutrino masses are expected to be of order @xmath5 and , hence , these are decoupled from low - energy phenomena .",
    "susy effects in a theory with a high seesaw scale have been considered in @xcite .",
    "it is also possible that neutrino masses arize from couplings to an su(2 ) triplet higgs boson  @xcite .",
    "the supersymmetric version of such a theory does nt have to include a right - handed neutrino superfield and thus its signatures is outside the purview of this work .",
    "it has recently been emphasized that any value of @xmath5 is technically natural  @xcite ( including @xmath8 , in which case the neutrinos are dirac fermions ) , and that it is important to explore the phenomenological consequences of all values of @xmath5 .",
    "one intriguing possibility is to consider , for example , that the unknown physics of susy breaking and lepton number breaking are intimately connected , resulting in a common mass scale .",
    "if this is the case ( or if the susy breaking scale were larger than @xmath5 ) , right - handed sneutrino masses are expected to be of the same order as the masses of all other super - partners . finally , the radiative stability of the weak scale indicates that the susy breaking scale ought to be around the weak scale , so that super - partners are expected to make their presence felt at tev scale collider experiments .",
    "depending on the physics of susy breaking , right - handed sneutrino masses may end up below all other `` active '' super - partner masses , so that the lightest sneutrino is the lightest supersymmetric partner ( lsp ) . in general , left- and right - handed sneutrinos mix . however , given that the seesaw energy scale is assumed to be very low , the neutrino yukawa coupling is , phenomenologically , required to be very small .",
    "hence , if one assumes that the supersymmetric breaking `` a - terms '' are proportional to the respective yukawa couplings , left - right sneutrino mixing is expected to be very small ( see , for example , @xcite for details , some aspects of which are given in app .",

    "we analyzed the sneutrino sector , pointed out in which cases the left - right sneutrino mixing angle can be tiny resulting in an almost pure @xmath3 lsp , and argued that the @xmath3 is an interesting non - thermal dark matter candidate ( see also @xcite ) . in this paper",
    "we explore the hadron collider implications of a predominantly @xmath3 lsp .",
    "collider signatures of a mixed @xmath10 lsp have been explored previously in other studies  @xcite .",
    "since a weak scale @xmath3 lsp interacts only through the tiny yukawa coupling @xmath11 , many unique collider signatures are expected to arise .",
    "we will show that the most striking among them is the possibility of the next - to - lightest supersymmetric particle ( nlsp ) being long - lived enough to leave a displaced vertex in the detector .",
    "a similar situation exists in theories of gauge mediation where the gravitino is the lsp  @xcite , with usually the scalar tau or the lightest neutralino as nlsps .",
    "a displaced vertex signature in the context of `` hidden valley '' models is discussed in @xcite .",
    "however , the scenario discussed here is distinguished by ( a ) the potentially long - lived states can be strongly interacting , ( b ) the lsp carries lepton number , which implies associated leptons in the final state , and ( c ) the lsp interacts only through the yukawa coupling @xmath11 , which generically implies non - universal rates for @xmath12 , @xmath13 , and @xmath14 type leptons .    in order to illustrate the unique collider signatures of a @xmath3 lsp",
