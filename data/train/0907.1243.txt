    "robust quantum mechanical codes have been developed to give us the very accurate spectral data needed to investigate the numerical consequences of the above theory . without going into details ,",
    "we should note that the dielectric spectral data depend on chirality and some swcnts even exhibit significant optical anisotropy between their radial and axial directions @xcite . for purposes of illustration of the theory developed here ,",
    "we choose [ 5,1 ] and [ 29,0 ] semiconducting carbon nanotubes , which have been previously analyzed and which differ substantially in their radii as well as spectral properties @xcite .",
    "this choice is motivated by the fact that although [ 4,2 ] is technically the smallest swcnt - it has a radius of only 0.207 nm - the [ 5,1 ] and [ 29,0 ] have a bigger difference in their spectra and are thus more appropriate to explore the effect of disparate dielectric spectra on van der waals - dispersion forces .",
    "the theory developed here should be safely applied to this case since the tubes are not metallic and their dielectric response functions are thus always bounded . furthermore , their dielectric responses and radii ( 1.135 and 0.218 nm for [ 29,0 ] and [ 5,1 ] swcnts , respectively , when measured from the center of the cylinder to the centers of the carbon atoms ) are very different , which is another reason for choosing these tubes as the benchmark for application of the theory . for illustrative purposes we also disregard the finite core size of the [ 29,0 ] swcnt that would require a more careful modeling of its effective dielectric response @xcite and thus introduce additional parameters that would complicate the understanding of the retardation effects in van der waals - dispersion interactions between these two swcnts , which is our primary aim in this paper .",
    "once the surface to surface separation between two swcnts is greater than approximately two swcnt outer diameters @xcite this approximation turns out to work quite well .",
    "it seems plausible that retardation effects are largest in the parallel configuration .",
    "although the calculations are most demanding in this case , we nevertheless analyze it first .",
    "figure [ fig : fig1 ] shows the interaction free energy per unit length for two parallel [ 5,1 ] swcnts ( panel a ) , two parallel [ 29,0 ] swcnts ( panel b ) and parallel [ 5,1 ] and [ 29,0 ] swcnts ( panel c ) .",
    "it is obvious , fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] , that the departure of the retarded results from the nonretarded ones takes place only when separations are larger than about 50 nm , but the strength of van der waals interaction there is weak , on the order of 10@xmath89 @xmath90 / nm . ] for [ 5,1]-[29,0 ] pair of swcnts .",
    "one can see very gradual deviation of the retarded results from @xmath91 to @xmath92 scaling with the separation distance ( note log - scale on both axes ) .    for @xmath93 nm , the fully retarded value of the van der waals interaction for the [ 5,1]-[29,0 ] pair is -0.13294 @xmath90 / nm , while the nonretarded value is -0.13377 @xmath90 / nm , so the contribution of retardation at this distance is only about 0.6 % .",
    "the nonretarded value of interaction then is of some use for a large interval of intercylinder separations due to the strict power - law behavior of the nonretarded values @xmath94 .",
    "for example , for @xmath95 nm , the interaction is -0.13377 ( 2/16)@xmath96 = -4.0823 10@xmath97 @xmath90 / nm .",
    "the full retarded expressions give a mostly negligible contribution to the van der waals interactions at spacings of relevance .",
    "its importance can be boosted when considering interactions between different types of swcnts in a dielectric medium with appropriate ( or even  tailored  ) response . in that case and depending on the full dielectric spectra of the two cylinders and of the medium , retardation coupled to the dielectric spectra can in principle lead to a change in sign of the interaction via a similar mechanism first considered for the interaction of ice with vacuum across a liquid film , as studied by elbaum and schick @xcite .",
    "( in that case , the two half - spaces are ice and vacuum , while the dielectric medium between is water ) .",
    "these effects will be investigated in sec .",
    "[ sec : tailor ] . note that the sign change can also be obtained for hollow cylinders at small separations , but it has a different origin @xcite .",
    "of all the three cases considered , the van der waals attraction is the strongest for the pair of [ 29,0 ] swcnts ( -0.5325 @xmath90/nm at @xmath98 nm ) .",
    "the most important reason for this is the explicit dependence of the van der waals interaction on radii of the two cylinders ( @xmath99 ) .",
    "the radius of [ 29,0 ] swcnt is 5.21 times bigger than the radius of [ 5,1 ] swcnt .",
    "these calculations are numerically less demanding since the dimensionality of integration is one rather then two for parallel cylinders .",
    "figure [ fig : fig2 ] presents the dependence of the van der waals interaction free energy for two [ 5,1 ] swcnts ( panel a ) , two [ 29,0 ] swcnts ( panel b ) and [ 5,1 ] and [ 29,0 ] swcnts ( panel c ) crossed at the right angle ( @xmath100 ) .",
    "again , the contribution of retardation is small .",
    "its observable effects in this configuration take place at about 30 nm , similar as in the case of parallel nanotubes .",
    "the nonretarded and the retarded values for the van der waals interaction for [ 5,1]-[29,0 ] pair separated by @xmath93 nm are -0.3255 @xmath90 and -0.3285 @xmath90 , respectively .",
    "the contribution of retardation effects to the van der waals interaction at this distance is thus 0.9 % , similar to the case of parallel swcnts , and , interestingly , somewhat larger .",
    "the dependence of the pair interaction on separation is @xmath101 for the nonretarded case , but one can see a gradual transition towards the @xmath94 dependence for large distances .",
    "again , the interaction is strongest for a pair of [ 29,0 ] carbon nanotubes .",
    "the dependence of the van der waals interaction on the relative orientation angle ( @xmath2 ) is of interest , since it can be used to calculate the effective van der waals torque that acts to make the cylinders parallel .",
    "the dependence of the van der waals interaction on the angle for @xmath98 nm is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3 ]    note that the torque vanishes for @xmath102 .",
    "one should also note that for @xmath103 the van der waals interaction calculated from eq .",
    "[ pars-31 ] diverges .",
    "this is due to the fact the the interaction free energy for parallel cylinders scales with their length and thus diverges for infinitely long cylinders .",
    "it is clear from eqs .",
    "[ pars-31 ] and [ pars-4 ] that the angular dependence of the van der waals interaction depends on the details of the dielectric response of the cylinders .",
    "nevertheless , a quick look at panel a ) of fig . [ fig : fig3 ] may lead one to think that the angular dependencies for all three cases are completely the same up to some multiplicative constant .",
    "this is in part due to the divergence introduced by the @xmath104 factor which tends to screen the fine details of the interaction .",
    "however , a closer look indeed shows that the angular anisotropies are not scalable as is shown in panel b ) of fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3 ] , where all three interactions have been scaled so as to reproduce the value of [ 5,1 ] - [ 29,0 ] interaction at @xmath105 ( this means that the scaling factor for [ 5,1 ] - [ 29,0 ] interaction is 1 ) .",
    "one can see how the curves separate as @xmath2 diminishes , and that [ 5,1 ] - [ 5,1 ] case has the largest angular anisotropy of the van der waals interaction .",
    "the effect is relatively small , however , and the @xmath104 factor determines the anisotropy to the largest extent , at least for the cases considered here .",
    "an interesting question is whether the cylinder - cylinder interaction can be repulsive and how that depends on the dielectric responses of the cylinders and the bathing medium ( this can be achieved only when the cylinders are different ) .",
    "the answer is somewhat hidden in eq .",
    "[ retardedfinal ] and much more explicit in eq .",
    "[ eq : cyl - paral - nonretarded ] . in both of these equations ,",
    "the van der waals interaction depends on the product @xmath106 which appears under the sum over matsubara frequencies .",
    "there is , however , the additional term that multiplies it [ @xmath107 for parallel cylinders in the nonretarded regime ] , that depends on both the longitudinal and transverse polarizabilities of the cylinders . a closer examination of eq .",
    "[ eq : adef ] shows that for isotropic cylinders @xmath108 is neccessarily positive , so that the aditional term is also positive when both cylinders are isotropic , at least in the nonretarded regime .",
    "parameter @xmath108 is negative only when the dielectric response of the medium is between the longitudinal and transverse responses of the cylinder , and even then , the sign of the additional term depends on the details of response of other cylinder .",
    "it thus seems that the repulsive nature of van der waals interaction can be most easily obtained and comprehended when it is enforced through the longitudinal response of the two cylinders .",
    "assuming now that the terms that multiply @xmath106 ( two - dimensional integral in the retarded case and relatively simple combination of transverse and logitudinal dielectric responses in the nonretarded case ) are positive , one concludes that the repulsive van der waals interaction can be obtained by making the product @xmath106 negative for all imaginary frequencies , i.e. that ( see eq .",
    "[ anisoind ] ) @xmath109 [ \\epsilon^c_{2,\\parallel}(i \\omega)-\\epsilon_m ( i \\omega ) ] < 0 , \\ ; \\forall \\omega\\ ] ] ( a completely analogous finding has been recently verified experimentally for the repulsive interaction between gold sphere and silica plate immersed in bromobenzene @xcite ) .",
    "this leads us to an interesting conception of  designing  the van der waals interaction between the cylinders by the introduction of an appropriate intervening medium . a simplest way which should produce repulsive interaction ( at least in the @xmath106  channel  )",
    "is to  construct  the medium dielectric response as @xmath110 since dielectric responses are difficult to measure experimentally the `` designer '' response above would have to be engineered by the use of _ ab initio _ codes to fill this gap .",
    "the assumption that the above dielectric response of the intervening medium leads to repulsive dispersion interactions between two swcnts can be easily checked numerically and , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig4 ] , the van der waals interaction between [ 5,1 ] and [ 29,0 ] swcnts is indeed repulsive , at small distances @xmath1 , but an interesting effect takes place when @xmath111 nm . namely the retarded van der waals interaction changes sign , becoming attractive when @xmath112 nm and with an extremely shallow minimum ( @xmath113/nm ) at @xmath114 36 nm . this effect is not seen in the nonretarded van der waals interaction which is repulsive for all distances @xmath1 .",
    "although we aimed at constructing the medium response that shall guarantee the repulsive van der waals interaction , we obtained that the retardation effects can act so as to change the sign of interaction at a certain separation distance .",
    "this effect is quite similar to what has been found in ref . and",
    "it is of interest to see whether it can be  boosted  and brought to smaller separation distances by a carefully guided choice of the medium in between the cylinders .",
    "retardation acts so as to screen the contribution of higher matsubara frequencies to the total value of the van der waals interaction .",
    "this effect becomes more important as the separation distances increase @xcite .",
    "it thus seems possible to design a dielectric response of the medium so that the retardation screens the repulsive large @xmath38 contributions to the summation in eq .",
    "[ retardedfinal ] , switching from repulsive to attractive behavior for some @xmath1 .",
    "one can even imagine a medium in which the van der waals interaction between the cylinders would be attractive for small @xmath1 s and repulsive for large @xmath1 s .",
    "this shall be illustrated by several examples .",
    "figure [ fig : figodzivi ] shows the longitudinal dielectric responses of [ 5,1 ] and [ 29,0 ] swcnts .",

    "the two responses are modeled as @xmath115 ( dashed line , model 1 ) and @xmath116 ( dotted line , model 2 ) , where @xmath38 is the matsubara frequency index .",
    "the two model medium responses are quite similar .",
    "examination of the nonretarded variant of the van der waals interaction ( eq .",
    "[ eq : cyl - paral - nonretarded ] ) , suggests that there exists a possibility of observing interesting effects in the longitudinal  channel  of dielectric response .",
    "namely , the product @xmath106 is positive when @xmath117 , negative when @xmath118 , and again positive when @xmath119 .",
    "thus , the contributions to the total ( summed ) van der waals interaction are both positive and negative , depending on the value of @xmath38 . as retardation screens the contribution from larger values of @xmath38 at large separation distances ,",
    "one may _ a priori _ expect to see a change in character of van der waals interaction ( repulsive vs. attractive ) depending on the separation distance .",
    "this is indeed confirmed by numerical results shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig5 ] .    however , the overall behavior of the van der waals interaction , being attractive for model 1 medium , and repulsive at short distances for model 2 medium , is even more striking .",
    "this change can occur by quite a minor alteration of the medium response .",
    "note , however , that the absolute magnitude of [ 5,1 ] - [ 29,0 ] van der waals interaction is a factor of 200 smaller with respect to the case when the swcnts are in vacuum ( @xmath120/nm in medium vs. @xmath121/nm in vacuum at @xmath122 nm ) .",
    "an expected minimum in the van der waals interaction is observed in model 2 of the medium at @xmath123 nm , but its depth is quite small ( @xmath124/nm ) .",
    "the origin of this effect is exactly the same as in the case studied by elbaum and schick - the medium dielectric response ( water in their case ) is such that the product @xmath125 [ \\epsilon^c_{2,\\parallel}(i \\omega)-\\epsilon_m ( i \\omega)]$ ] is both positive and negative , depending on the matsubara frequency , @xmath126 ( there is a crossover ( or several crossovers ) between the medium dielectric response and one of the cylinders responses ) . in the case studied by elbaum and schick , the medium response ( water )",
    "is quite similar to the response of one of the two half - spaces ( ice ) .",
    "this leads us to experiment a bit more with the medium response , making it more similar to the response of one of the cylinders .",

    "this interesting effect was not observed in the previous models .",
    "we should also note here that the appearance of the minimum in the interaction is a quite delicate effect that needs precise tuning of the parameters of the medium response . from our numerical experiments we found that , while it is in general easy to obtain purely repulsive or purely attractive interactions , the minimum in the interaction appears as a quite special effect , and only in a narrow region of parameters describing the response of the intervening medium .",
    "the derivation of van der waals - dispersion interaction between two anisotropic dielectric cylinders presented here , based on the pitaevskii _ ansatz _ , is valid when the interaction energy either scales linearly with the length , as in the case of parallel cylinders , or does not scale with the length at all , as in the case of skewed cylinders .",
    "all the cases where the finite cylinder length effects come into play are not covered by this derivation .",
    "in addition the cylinder radius has to be the smallest length involved in the problem .",
    "another drawback of this method is that the cases of infinitely large dielectric response as in the metallic swcnts that show a drude - like response at zero frequency can not be dealt with within the framework proposed here .",
    "the zero frequency term in the matsubara summation would have to be treated differently @xcite for those cases .    despite these drawbacks",
    "the present approach yields the final result for the calculation of van der waals dispersion interactions between infinitely long semiconducting anisotropic swcnts .",
    "we derived all the appropriate limits and showed how the detais and peculiarities of the dielectric response of various swcnts effect this interaction and can in general lead also to non - monotonic van der waals dispersion interactions of a type analogous to those found by elbaum and shick in the case of an aqueous layer on the surface of ice @xcite .",
    "we analyzed in detail also the effect of retardation at sufficiently large inter cylinder spacings .",
    "the general conclusion is that these effects kick in at separation of about 100 nm for parallel cylinders and at about somewhat smaller separation of 50 nm for skewed cylinders . in its retarded form ,",
    "that decays one distance power faster than the non - retarded form , the dispersion interactions between cylinders are in general small , only a fraction of @xmath128 per nm length of the cylinder .",
    "nevertheless these effects are real and can be significant for sufficiently long carbon nanotubes .",
    "since the dispersion interactions depend in a complicated way on the dielectric properties of the interacting anisotropic cylinders there exists a possibility that between two different types of swcnts , with sufficiently different dielectric spectra , the interaction would become repulsive , or even show a non - monotonic separation dependence .",
    "such variation of van der waals - dispersion interaction has been observed in other contexts @xcite .",
    "these delicate effects in themselves do not depend on the fact that the interacting cylinders are anisotropic .",
    "in fact , they persist even when the cylinders are made of isotropic dielectric materials .",
