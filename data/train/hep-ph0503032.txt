    "some thirty years ago , it was observed that dense and cold quark matter might exhibit cooper pairing as a result of an attractive quark - quark interaction in the color antitriplet channel  @xcite .",
    "more recent models , based on non - perturbative effective interactions or on diagrammatic calculations of single - gluon exchange interactions , indicate that a color superconducting phase might develop pairing gaps as large as @xmath0mev for quark chemical potentials on the order of @xmath1mev  @xcite .",
    "this interesting possibility has direct consequences on the physics of dense stars and is certainly important for the determination of the phase diagram of nuclear matter under extreme ( ultrarelativistic ) conditions  @xcite .",
    "different order parameters have been proposed in the literature and studied as a function of , e.g. , the quark masses , the number of flavors and colors , the quark chemical potentials , and temperature  @xcite . in the limit of qcd with two flavors of light quarks ( the 2sc limit ) , the order parameter has the form @xmath2 where @xmath3 is a four - momentum and where we have displayed the flavor ( @xmath4,@xmath5 ) , color ( @xmath6 , @xmath7 ) , and spin ( @xmath8 , @xmath9 ) indices .",
    "the tensors @xmath10 ensures that the condensate is antisymmetric in flavor , color , and spin .",
    "color is broken from @xmath11 to @xmath12 , but the flavor symmetry @xmath13 and the baryon symmetry @xmath14 remain intact . in the other limit of three degenerate flavors of light quarks ,",
    "the favored order parameter exhibits a coupling between color and flavor rotations ( called color - flavor locking or cfl ) and has the approximate form  @xcite @xmath15 color , flavor , and baryon symmetries are now broken down to @xmath16 . since",
    "both @xmath17 and @xmath18 are locked to @xmath19 , the cfl condensate also breaks chiral symmetry .    following ref .",
    "@xcite , the conjectured phase diagram for qcd with three flavors and realistic quark masses is given in fig .",

    "asymptotically high densities , the scale is set by the quark chemical potential , @xmath20 . for @xmath21 (",
    "@xmath22 is the strange quark mass ) , the more symmetric cfl phase is favored .",
    "as @xmath20 decreases , the increasing difference between @xmath23- ( or @xmath24- ) and @xmath25-quark fermi momenta weakens @xmath26 and @xmath27 condensates and eventually leads to a transition to the 2sc phase  @xcite , possibly via a so - called loff phase characterized by a spatially varying gap  @xcite .",
    "most of these results have not been confirmed by lattice simulations , which are difficult to perform and interpret for qcd with three colors at finite baryon densities .",
    "the difficulty resides in the fact that the fermion determinant in the partition function is complex for non - zero @xmath20 , and sampling weights are no longer positive definite .",
    "this difficult problem represents a significant barrier to understanding the phase structure of qcd in lattice simulations .",
    "random matrix theory offers models that are capable of distinguishing those physical properties that are determined by global symmetries from those that depend on the detailed dynamics of the interactions .",
    "the random matrix hamiltonian mimics the true interactions by adopting a block structure that is solely determined by the global symmetries under consideration .",
    "the matrix elements are drawn on a random distribution , usually a gaussian distribution , so that the model can be solved exactly .",
    "such an approach leads to universal results that can be studied at two different levels . at the microscopic level ,",
    "the statistical properties of the lowest eigenvalues of the dirac operator are determined by the spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry , as indicated for example by the universality of the spectral density near zero virtuality and related sum rules  @xcite . at the macroscopic level , many of the properties of the phase diagram ( such as its topology and the presence of given critical lines or points ) are independent of the detailed form of the interactions and are thus symmetry protected .",
    "the random matrix approach treats low - lying fermion excitations and , in its usual form , neglects their momentum and kinetic energy .",
    "the resulting phase diagram is mean - field . near critical regions",
    ", it produces results similar to those obtained in a landau - ginzburg approach  @xcite . in general ,",
    "random matrix models provide a useful tool for studying systems with non - trivial phase diagrams .",
    "this talk focuses on random matrix models that implement coexisting chiral and color symmetries in qcd with two light degenerate flavors ( 2sc ) .",
    "these models are extensions of the chiral random matrix models , which we introduce in sec .",
    "[ s : chiral ] .",
    "we present the construction of the color and spin block structure of the interactions in sec .",

    "we first consider chiral symmetry alone and turn to chiral random matrix models  @xcite . for qcd in the sector of zero topological charge with @xmath28 flavors and zero chemical potential ,",
    "the partition function is given as @xmath29\\,\\exp\\big(- \\frac{n \\beta \\sigma^2}{2}\\,{\\rm tr}[w w^\\dagger]\\big ) , \\label{z}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath30 is an @xmath31 matrix which models the interactions",

    "this leads to the block structure @xmath38 for random matrix models of qcd with @xmath11 and fermions in the fundamental representation , @xmath30 is complex .",
    "this choice corresponds to the chiral unitary ensemble , which is characterized by a dyson index @xmath39 .",

    "( @xmath42 is the charge conjugation operator , @xmath43 is the antisymmetric color matrix , and @xmath44 is the complex conjugation operator . ) this implies that it is possible to find a particular basis of states in which @xmath45 is real .",
    "accordingly , @xmath30 is chosen real in chiral random matrix models for @xmath12 , and this leads to the chiral orthogonal ensemble with an index @xmath46  @xcite . for fermions in the adjoint representation of the gauge group and any number of colors , the dirac operator obeys the anti - unitary symmetry @xmath47 with @xmath48 .",
    "this leads to the symplectic chiral ensemble with @xmath49 and quaternion real matrix elements  @xcite .",
    "we will not consider this ensemble further in this talk .",
    "the essential difference among the ensembles lies in the number of independent random variables that are allowed per matrix element .",
    "( i.e. , a complex number has two degrees of freedom ; a real number has only one . )",
    "this difference is important in determining the statistical properties of the dirac operator and , in turn , affects the phase diagram .",
    "in order to study the competition between chiral , @xmath50 , and diquark , @xmath51 , condensates , we introduce an explicit dependence in the spin and color quantum numbers appearing in the 2sc order parameter of eq .",
    "( [ 2sc ] ) .",

    "several comments are in order regarding the @xmath20 and @xmath66 dependences .",
    "the @xmath20 dependence mimics the @xmath67 term in the euclidean qcd lagrangian  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath66 dependence is based on two assumptions .",
    "first , temperature is introduced via a sum over the fermion matsubara frequencies , @xmath68 with @xmath33 odd . as random matrix theory only treats low - lying degrees of freedom ,",
    "much of the critical physics can be captured if one restricts the frequency sum to its two lowest terms  @xcite , hence the two - dimensional form @xmath69 .",
    "the second assumption comes from the physical observation that the diquark order parameter in eq .",
    "( [ 2sc ] ) couples fields of opposite four - momenta .",
    "we explicitly impose this coupling in eq .",
    "( [ zcolor ] ) by taking opposite matsubara frequencies for each flavor .",
    "different temperature dependences have been proposed in closely related random matrix models  @xcite ; we discuss their relationship to the present models in  @xcite .",
    "the partition function can be evaluated following a classical method .",
    "an integration over @xmath57 produces a four - fermion interaction which can be fierz - transformed to obtain the chiral and diquark channel terms .",
    "the resulting four - fermion potential can be expressed as a fermion field bilinear via a hubbard - stratonovitch transformation .",
    "these successive steps yield  @xcite @xmath70 where the thermodynamical potential , @xmath71 , is given as @xmath72 here , @xmath73 is the auxiliary field associated with the diquark channel ( with condensates @xmath74 = @xmath75 ) , while @xmath8 is related to the chiral channel ( with condensates @xmath76 ) .",
    "the partition function can be treated exactly in the thermodynamic limit @xmath77 by a saddle point method .",
    "the equilibrium values of the field then satisfy the two gap equations @xmath78 which constitute a system of polynomial equations that can be solved analytically or numerically .",
    "the form of the potential in eq .",
    "( [ omega ] ) has a straightforward interpretation .",
    "the quadratic terms correspond to the energy cost for having constant auxiliary fields .",
    "the logarithmic terms are to be related to the single quasiparticle spectrum in a given set of fields @xmath8 and @xmath73 . keeping in mind that the fermion four - momenta are neglected ,",
    "these energies are given as @xmath79 for the two pairing colors ( with the @xmath80 sign standing for either quark or antiquark excitations ) .",
    "for the @xmath81 unpaired colors , @xmath82 .",
    "we now turn to a chiral symmetric theory with @xmath34 .",
    "note that , because it is possible to rescale all fields and external parameters by a constant , the topology of the phase diagram depends only on the ratio @xmath83 .",
    "this is in fact a ratio of the fierz constants in the chiral and diquark channel , and it measures the relative importance of the two symmetries .",
    "for example , small ratios are obtained with @xmath84 ; the energy cost of @xmath85 then prohibits diquark condensation .",
    "similarly , large ratios @xmath83 disfavor chiral symmetry breaking . for @xmath86 , the interactions in eq .",
    "( [ expanded ] ) lead to a ratio @xmath87 , which corresponds to the phase diagram of fig .",
    "[ f : rm - pd - qcd ] .",
    "one observes a low - density chiral broken symmetry phase separated from a higher density diquark phase by a first - order line .",
    "as the temperature is raised , the diquark phase makes a transition to the chiral symmetric phase across a second - order line .",
    "the transition from broken to restored chiral symmetry is second - order at low densities and first - order at intermediate densities .",
    "the two lines are separated by a tricritical point , in the vicinity of which the thermodynamical potential reduces to a @xmath88 theory  @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to ask how the phase structure evolves if one changes the channel couplings @xmath89 and @xmath90 from the values representative of qcd . to this end",
    ", we have considered hermitean dirac @xmath45 operators spanning an exhaustive set of combinations of helicity , spin , and color block structures .",
    "remarkably , this set produces ratios @xmath83 in the _ bounded _ range @xmath91 $ ] .",
    "this result differs from what would have been obtained in a pure landau - ginsburg approach , where there is no _ a priori _ knowledge of existing constraints among the coefficients of the effective thermodynamical potential . here , however , having started at a more microscopic level , we are capable of discovering possible bounds on the coupling ratios . each ratio corresponds to a separate phase structure .",
    "the major conclusions resulting from the study of phase diagrams for ratios in the allowed range are as follows :    * there is only a finite number of different topologies .",
    "as @xmath83 is varied continuously , the evolution from one topology to another is marked by the emergence or the vanishing of new critical points or lines ; * it takes moderate  but finite  alterations of the theory to depart from the topology of fig .",
    "[ f : rm - pd - qcd ] . in that sense , the phase structure of fig .",
    "[ f : rm - pd - qcd ] is protected by symmetry .",
    "in order to appreciate the approximations involved in the formulation of the random matrix model , consider the gap equation in the limit @xmath92 , @xmath93 and compare with that obtained in a microscopic mean - field theory such as that of ref .",
    "@xcite , based on an effective interaction modeled by that induced by instantons .",
    "approximately , we find @xmath94 where we have dropped the form factors needed for the convergence of the integral .",
    "it is also implied that the integral over @xmath95 is a sum over matsubara frequencies , @xmath96 with @xmath33 odd .",
    "because we have neglected the fermion four - momenta , the gap equation in the random matrix approach does not contain an integral .",
    "this has two consequences .",
    "first , the right term in eq .",
    "( [ delta - gap - rm ] ) does not exhibit the logarithmic divergence observed in eq .",
    "( [ delta - gap - njl ] ) for @xmath97 and @xmath98 .",
    "this divergence arises for values of @xmath3 near the fermi momentum in the limit @xmath99 and implies that a non - zero @xmath73 must develop at all @xmath20 .",
    "in contrast , the diquark phase in fig .",
    "[ f : rm - pd - qcd ] does not exist for asymptotically high values of @xmath20 .",
    "the random matrix interactions saturate in the diquark channel for @xmath20 larger than @xmath100 .",
    "the second consequence of the absence of a momentum integral is that the gap , @xmath73 , evolves monotonically as a function of @xmath20 in contrast to results from a microscopic approach , see refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "these discrepancies should not be considered as weaknesses of the random matrix approach . in the first case",
    ", @xmath73 vanishes in a region where microscopic theories tend to produce small gaps which probably do not survive fluctuations beyond mean field .",
    "what random matrix can not reproduce , however , is the @xmath101 behavior as a function of the qcd coupling constant , @xmath5 .",
    "this behavior is due to the magnetic gluon interactions  @xcite .",
    "the random matrix approach is also unable to reproduce the unbounded increase of @xmath73 at asymptotically high @xmath20 , which is related to the running of @xmath5  @xcite .",
    "both these features are predicted from diagrammatic theory and are related to particular dynamic processes .",
    "the second observed difference , the variation of gaps at moderate values of @xmath20 , arises from the detailed dynamics of the interactions and depends on the choice of the regulating form factors .",
    "this behavior is not dictated by symmetry , and it is thus no surprise that it is not revealed by the random matrix approach .      in the limit of @xmath102 ,",
    "the gauge group is pseudoreal , and quark and antiquark states transform similarly under global color rotations .",
    "they can be combined into spinors which obey an extended flavor symmetry @xmath103 for which @xmath104 mesons and @xmath105 baryons belong to the same multiplets .",
    "the random matrix model ( with @xmath106 ) reproduces this extended symmetry in the vacuum and its breaking pattern as a function of @xmath20 , @xmath66 , and @xmath61 . in the vacuum and in the chiral limit",
    ", the thermodynamic potential depends on the condensation fields through the combination @xmath107 .",
    "the extended @xmath108 symmetry is here apparent since a state with @xmath109 is indistinguishable from its rotated version with @xmath110 . for @xmath111 and low temperature , the phase @xmath112 undergoes a second order phase transition to a diquark phase at @xmath113 where @xmath114 is the pion mass  @xcite .",
    "many results of the random matrix approach agree with chiral perturbation theory in this case  @xcite .",
    "the random matrix model is a theory of low - lying modes .",
    "we argued earlier that restricting the sum over matsubara frequencies leads to a model which nicely captures the critical physics .",
    "the neglect of high - energy modes leads however to unphysical results , such as a negative baryon density and a variation of the chiral field as a function @xmath20 , both in a theory with @xmath102 and in the region @xmath115 .",
    "we have shown that the inclusion of appropriate high - energy terms ( which should not describe the critical physics ) , either in the form of correction terms or as a sum over all matsubara frequencies , fixes these anomalies while leaving the topology of the phase diagram intact  @xcite .",
    "another question is whether the interactions in eq .",
    "( [ expanded ] ) preserves the statistical properties of the eigenvalues of the dirac operator that are expected from chiral symmetry alone .",
    "these properties should follow the predictions of the chiral unitary ensemble for qcd with three colors and those of the chiral orthogonal ensemble for qcd with two colors .",
    "this question is related to the number of random degrees of freedom allowed for the matrix elements .",
    "we have shown that , even if the interaction matrices are complex for both @xmath86 and @xmath102 , the deterministic spin and color dependences lead to the properties that are expected for the spectrum of the dirac operator  @xcite .",
    "we have considered random matrix models of qcd with two flavors that are capable of developing chiral and diquark condensation .",
    "we have studied the symmetry breaking patterns as a function of temperature and quark chemical potential .",
    "the phase diagrams can be established exactly from an analytical evaluation of the partition function .",
