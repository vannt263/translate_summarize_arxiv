    "the recent discovery  @xcite of the higgs boson at the cern large hadron collider ( lhc ) constitutes an important milestone for the ultra - violet ( uv ) completion of the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "although the so - called higgs mechanism may well explain the generation of most of the particle masses in the sm , the origin of the small neutrino masses still remains an open issue . in particular , the observed smallness of the light neutrino masses may naturally be explained through the see - saw mechanism  @xcite , which necessitates the majorana nature of the light ( active ) neutrinos and postulates the presence of heavy right - handed majorana partners of mass @xmath0 .",
    "the right - handed majorana mass @xmath0 is usually considered to be much larger than the lepton or quark masses .",
    "the origin of @xmath0 has been the topic of several extensions of the sm in the literature , within the framework of quantum field theory  @xcite and string theory  @xcite .",
    "recently , a potentially interesting radiative mechanism for generating gauge - invariant fermion masses at three loops has been studied in  @xcite .",
    "the mechanism utilizes global anomalies triggered by the possible existence of scalar or pseudoscalar fields in u(1 ) gauge theories and by heavy fermions @xmath1 whose masses may not result from spontaneous symmetry breaking .",
    "one - loop quantum effects of the heavy fermions @xmath1 give rise to a global chiral anomaly given by @xmath2 where @xmath3 is a pseudoscalar field , @xmath4 denotes the u(1 ) gauge field maxwell tensor and @xmath5 is its dual .",
    "moreover , it was assumed in @xcite that the pseudoscalar field @xmath3 couples to chirality - changing fermion bilinears , @xmath6 , via the yukawa - type couplings @xmath7 the fermions @xmath8 are assumed to have zero bare masses .",
    "however , as was explicitly demonstrated in  @xcite , the fermions @xmath8 can receive a non - zero mass at the three - loop level , through the anomalous interaction  ( [ aff ] ) and the chirality - changing yukawa couplings  ( [ yukawa ] ) .",
    "it was further suggested in @xcite that this mass - generating mechanism can also be applied to create low - scale fermion masses by pure quantum gravity effects . in this case , the rle of the u(1 ) gauge field strength tensor  @xmath4 will be played by the riemann curvature tensor  @xmath9 , and hence the rle of the gauge fields by the gravitons .",
    "such a gravitationally - generating mass mechanism could straightforwardly be applied to fermions without sm quantum charges , such as majorana right - handed neutrinos , which we restrict our attention here .",
    "in such a framework of quantum gravity , the operator ( [ aff ] ) is expected to be replaced by an operator of the form @xmath10 where @xmath3 is an appropriate pseudoscalar field and @xmath11 denotes the dual riemann curvature tensor .",
    "it is the purpose of this paper to present explicit scenarios of quantum gravity and provide reliable estimates of the gravitationally induced right - handed majorana mass @xmath0 .",
    "although quantum gravitational interactions are non - renormalizable , nevertheless there are aspects of the theory that can be exact , in a path integral sense , and these are related to some aspects of torsionful manifolds .",
    "torsion appears as a non - propagating form - valued pseudoscalar field @xmath12 in a quantum gravity path integral and as such it can be integrated out exactly .",
    "as we explain in this paper , the effect of torsion would result in anomalous operators analogous to  ( [ arr ] ) , which are instrumental in the generation of majorana fermion masses .    nevertheless , in addition to the torsional field @xmath12 , the presence of extra pseudoscalar fields @xmath3 are required for generating a chirality violating majorana mass @xmath0 .",
    "the reason is that the couplings of the torsional axion field @xmath12 are of derivative type and preserve a shift symmetry : @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is an arbitrary constant . as a consequence",
    ", chirality is conserved in the massless limit of the right - handed neutrinos , thus forbidding the generation of a majorana mass  @xmath0 .",
    "however , the shift symmetry may break explicitly via non - perturbative effects , when these axions couple to fermions via chirality changing yukawa couplings @xmath15 of the form  ( [ yukawa ] ) .",
    "the size of the yukawa coupling @xmath15 is highly model dependent , implying a wide range of values for the gravitationally - induced majorana mass scale  @xmath0 .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "after this introductory section , section  ii reviews some basic properties of manifolds with quantum torsion , within field - theoretic and string - theoretic frameworks . in section  iii we present an explicit effective field - theoretic scenario of quantum torsion that can give rise to an anomalous majorana neutrino mass generation at two loops",
    "finally , section iv summarizes our conclusions and presents possible future directions .",
    "quantum field theories in space - times with torsion exhibit some interesting properties , which have been known for some time  @xcite . in theories with fermions , torsion is introduced necessarily in the first - order palatini formalism , where vierbein and spin connections are treated as independent variables ( einstein - cartan theory )  @xcite . in what follows ,",
    "we discuss various cases where torsion appears in the spectrum of a quantum - gravity model .",
    "we shall examine first a string theory models and then proceed to argue that certain properties of quantum torsion , such as those related to chiral ( axial ) anomalies , are generic to field theories with fermions and can arise in ordinary local field theoretic models , not only strings . let us commence our discussion from string theory , not as much for historical purposes , but because the latter provides a concrete uv complete theoretical framework for quantum gravity .      in string theories ,",
    "torsion is introduced as a consequence of the existence of the antisymmetric tensor field @xmath16 existing in the gravitational multiplet of the string .",

    "in fact , it can be shown  @xcite that the terms involving the field strength perturbatively to each order in the regge slope parameter @xmath20 can be assembled , in such a way that only torsionful christoffel symbols , such as @xmath21 , appear . in this formalism",
    ", the torsionful christoffel symbol @xmath21 is defined as @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the ordinary , torsion - free , symmetric connection , and @xmath24 is the gravitational constant given by @xmath25 where @xmath26 and @xmath27 are newton s constant and the planck mass , respectively .",
    "consequently , terms involving the generalized riemann curvature tensor @xmath28 , appear in the effective action . in the context of ( super)string theories  @xcite , anomaly cancellation requires that lorentz and gauge chern simons terms are added to the field strength of the @xmath29 field so that one may defines a new field - strength three - form @xmath30 such that the following bianchi identity is implied : @xmath31 where * r * denotes the gravitational riemann curvature four - form without h - torsion and @xmath32 the gauge field strength two form , which includes the torsion .",
    "the @xmath33 symbol denotes appropriate contractions with the vierbeins @xmath34 , while the trace is taken over all possible group - theoretic structures .",
    "to lowest order in @xmath20 , where we shall restrict our attention here , the effective action in a four - dimensional space - time ( obtained after compactification and up to a total divergence ) reads  @xcite : @xmath35 where in the second line we used the generalized torsionful connection ( [ torsionful ] ) .",
    "the gravitational constant @xmath36 contains all the appropriate compactification volume factors and string coupling terms , in particular we have the following relation from string theory @xmath37 with @xmath38 the string mass scale and @xmath39 the string coupling assumed weak @xmath40 .",
    "we assume constant dilations @xmath41 in four dimensions for our purposes here .",
    "in general , for non constant dilations @xmath42 is a field - dependent quantity .    in four dimensions",
    ", we may define the dual of @xmath43 , @xmath44 , or equivalently in components , @xmath45 after adopting the normalizations of @xcite .",
    "the field @xmath12 is a form - valued pseudoscalar field , with a canonically - normalised kinetic term , which we call from now on the kalb - ramond ( kr ) axion  @xcite , in order to distinguish it from other axion - like fields coming , _",
    "e.g. _  from the moduli sector of string theory , which we shall also employ in our analysis . using the definition ( [ baxion ] ) we may rewrite the bianchi identity ( [ bianchi ] ) in the form @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the torsion - free gravitational covariant derivative and @xmath48 are the components of the torsion - free curvature tensor .",
    "the latin indices @xmath49 are tangent space indices as usual . using ( [ yder ] ) in ( [ eat ] ) and performing a partial integration",
    ", we arrive at the following form of the string - inspired four - dimensional effective action with h - torsion  @xcite : @xmath50\\ ; .\\qquad\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the close relation of the h - torsion to the appearance of an axion - like field in the effective action is not unique to string theory . in the next subsection",
    "we proceed to discuss a field theoretical case where similar effects take place .",
    "as observed in @xcite in the context of qed in torsionful manifolds , one obtains similar couplings of the torsion - induced axion to gravity and gauge fields as in ( [ string ] ) , by employing _",
    "quantum anomalies _ of the axial fermion current .",
    "indeed , let us consider dirac qed fermions in a torsionful space - time .",
    "the dirac action reads : @xmath51 where @xmath52 , with @xmath53 the electron charge and @xmath54 the photon field .",
    "the overline above the covariant derivative , i.e.  @xmath55 , denotes the presence of torsion , which is introduced through the torsionful spin connection : @xmath56 , where @xmath57 is the contorsion tensor .",
    "the latter is related to the torsion two - form @xmath58 via  @xcite : @xmath59 .",
    "the presence of torsion in the covariant derivative in the dirac - like action ( [ dirac ] ) leads , apart from the standard terms in manifolds without torsion , to an additional term involving the axial current @xmath60 : @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the dual of * t * : @xmath63 .",
    "we next remark that the torsion tensor can be decomposed into its irreducible parts  @xcite , of which @xmath64 is the pseudoscalar axial vector : @xmath65 with @xmath66 .",
    "this implies that the contorsion tensor undergoes the following decomposition : @xmath67 where @xmath68 includes the trace vector @xmath69 and the tensor @xmath70 parts of the torsion tensor .",
    "the gravitational part of the action can then be written as : @xmath71 where @xmath72 , with the hatted notation defined in ( [ hatted ] ) .    in a quantum gravity setting , where one integrates over all fields , the torsion terms appear as non propagating fields and thus they can be integrated out exactly .",
    "the authors of @xcite have observed though that the classical equations of motion identify the axial - pseudovector torsion field @xmath73 with the axial current , since the torsion equation yields @xmath74 from this it follows @xmath75 , leading to a conserved `` torsion charge '' @xmath76 . to maintain this conservation in quantum theory",
    ", they postulated @xmath77 at the quantum level , which can be achieved by the addition of judicious counter terms .",
    "this constraint , in a path - integral formulation of quantum gravity , is then implemented via a delta function constraint , @xmath78 , and the latter via the well - known trick of introducing a lagrange multiplier field @xmath79 .",
    "hence , the relevant torsion part of the quantum - gravity path integral would include a factor @xmath80\\nonumber \\\\    & & \\hspace{-5mm}=\\ !",

    "the reader should notice that , as a result of this integration , the corresponding _ effective _ field theory contains a _ non - renormalizable _ repulsive four - fermion axial current - current interaction   entails that a majorana fermion is its own antiparticle and so there is _ no _ such a violation of cpt . ] .",
    "we may partially integrate the second term in the exponent on the right - hand - side of ( [ qtorsion ] ) and take into account the well known field theoretic result that in qed the axial current is not conserved at the quantum level , due to anomalies , but its divergence is obtained by the one - loop result  @xcite : @xmath83 observe that in ( [ anom ] ) the torsion - free spin connection has been used .",
    "this can be achieved by the addition of proper counter terms in the action  @xcite , which can convert the anomaly from the initial @xmath84 to @xmath85 . using ( [ anom ] ) in ( [ qtorsion ] )",
    "one can then obtain for the effective torsion action in qed @xmath86\\ ; .\\ ] ] thus , even in ordinary field theories , we obtain the coupling of the kr axion to the curvature and gauge field strengths : @xmath87 , exactly as we obtained in the string case ( [ string ] ) .",
    "in addition , the torsion lead to repulsive four - fermion interactions involving the axial current .",
    "crucial to the above derivation was , however , the postulation of the conservation of the torsion charge at the quantum level , as expressed by the constraint @xmath88 .",
    "the resulting axion field has originated from the lagrange multiplier field implementing this constraint . in the subsequent section we present an alternative derivation of this result .",
    "we shall now provide a different proof concerning the fundamental geometrical properties of the torsion at the quantum level . to this end",
    ", we concentrate on the work of @xcite , which discusses fermionic torsion in first - order palatini formalism of fermions in curved space times .",
    "although the motivation of that work was an attempt to connect some aspects of loop quantum gravity theories to ashtekar canonical formulation of quantum gravity , nevertheless the used formalism will allow us to discover the above - mentioned torsion - induced axions from a different viewpoint .",
    "as noted in  @xcite , in the case of dirac fermions in a manifold with torsion , if one uses the naive version of the dirac action ( [ dirac ] ) , decomposes the torsion tensor in its irreducible parts , and uses the equations of motion , then the trace vector part @xmath69 is found proportional to the axial fermion current @xmath89 , which is _ inconsistent _ with the respective lorentz transformation properties .",
    "such an inconsistency is remedied by adding to the action a _ total derivative _ term which can be expressed solely in terms of _ topological invariants _ , namely the so - called nieh - yan invariant density  @xcite , and a _ total divergence _ of the fermion axial current : @xmath90~ , \\nonumber \\\\",

    "then , on account of ( [ torsionec ] ) , we observe that in the case with fermionic torsion , both terms in the space - time integrand of the holst action turn out to be proportional to the divergence of the axial current , which can be expressed in terms of the ( torsion - free ) curvature and gauge field strengths through the anomaly equation ( [ anom ] ) ) and the ones proportional to the h - torsion . in that case , through the anomaly equation ( [ anom ] ) and bianchi identity ( [ bianchi ] ) , both terms in the expression for the holst action ( [ ny ] ) are proportional to the same form total derivative terms , up to algebraic proportionality factors .",

    "we notice that the term involving the divergence of the axial current in ( [ ny ] ) yields , upon using the anomaly equation ( [ anom ] ) , a similar term in the effective action as the one involving the axion fields in string theory or in qed through implementing the appropriate constraints by lagrange multipliers , and thus we can identify the non constant field @xmath97 with the axion @xmath12 @xmath98 the kinetic terms for the field @xmath91 are obtained by using the equations of motion and identifying extra contributions in the contorsion involving derivatives of the field .",
    "this identification has also been conjectured in @xcite without having prior knowledge of the works of @xcite .",

    "consequently , we seem to have established that the presence of the coupling of axion to spatial curvature and the dual of the curvature tensor is a rather generic feature of torsionful theories of space time .",
    "we next proceed to apply the above ideas to the problem of gauge invariant majorana mass generation , without spontaneous symmetry breaking , for right - handed majorana neutrinos , that carry no standard model charges , and are thus susceptible to the effects of torsion .",

    "the relevant interaction lagrangian may be written down as @xmath173 where @xmath174 is the yukawa coupling of the axion @xmath3 to the fermion ( nucleon ) species @xmath175 of mass @xmath176 , @xmath177 is the axion - photon - photon coupling , and @xmath178 are model - dependent dimensionless parameters which are usually , but not necessarily , of order one .",
    "notice that there is no bare mass for the majorana fermion  @xmath179 in our case , which the pseudoscalar field @xmath3 couples to .",
    "therofore , the scale @xmath180 can not be defined , but one should instead constrain directly the dimensionless yukawa coupling @xmath15 in ( [ bacoupl3 ] ) . a detailed phenomenological study may appear elsewhere .",
    "of course , one can always assume that the axion moduli fields couple , in addition to the majorana neutrinos , also to the sm matter , such as nucleons and photons as above , in which case the phenomenological analysis and constraints of @xcite apply .",

    "heavier axions are allowed provided their coupling is greater than @xmath183  gev .    in the multi - axion models outlined above , the anomalously generated majorana neutrino mass @xmath0 will still depend on the yukawa coupling @xmath15 and the torsion - axion kinetic mixing coefficient @xmath111 , besides the assumed uv completion scale @xmath124 of quantum gravity . in order to get an estimate of the size of @xmath0",
    ", we treat the axion masses @xmath112 and mass - mixings @xmath184 as free parameters to be constrained by phenomenology .",
    "let us assume a @xmath147-axion - mixing model with @xmath185 , in which the axion mass mixings @xmath186 and their masses @xmath112 are of the same order , i.e.  @xmath187 .",
    "in this case , employing  ( [ mrmix1 ] ) , we may estimate the majorana neutrino mass @xmath0 to be @xmath188 for axion masses @xmath189 considered in the literature thus far , we find that @xmath190 , which implies extra - ordinary small majorana masses @xmath0 . an obvious caveat to this result would be to have ultra - heavy axion masses @xmath112 close to the gut scale and/or fine - tune the torsion - axion kinetic mixing parameter @xmath111 to  1 , in a way such that the factor @xmath191 compensates for the mass suppression  @xmath192 in  ( [ eq : multi ] ) .",
    "the latter possibility , however , might result in an unnaturally large ( non - perturbative ) `` effective '' yukawa coupling @xmath193 in ( [ bacoupl3 ] ) , which will bring us outside the perturbative framework that we have been considering here .",

    "this torsion - descent axion field @xmath150 has derivative couplings , leading to an axion shift symmetry : @xmath194 , where @xmath14 is an arbitrary constant .",
    "if another axion field @xmath113 or fields are present in the theory , the shift symmetry may be broken , giving rise to axion masses and chirality changing yukawa couplings to massless fermions , such as right - handed majorana neutrinos @xmath108 .",
    "we have estimated the magnitude of the two - loop gravitationally - induced majorana mass @xmath0 and found that it is highly model dependent .",
    "its size generically depends on three parameters : the value of the yukawa coupling @xmath15 to @xmath108 , the kinetic mixing term @xmath111 between the kr axion @xmath150 and the other axion field @xmath113 , and the assumed quantum gravity scale @xmath124 of uv completion . in the present study",
    ", we have assumed that @xmath124 is considerably smaller than the planck mass , i.e.  @xmath195 .",
