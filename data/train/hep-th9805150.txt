    "the study of exactly soluble 1 + 1 dimensional problems has yielded many insights into fundamental problems in field theory .",
    "other 1 + 1 dimensional problems can not be solved exactly , making it important to understand which properties of exact results will generalize to more generic cases and which are special to the exactly soluble cases .",
    "a particularly rich area is the study of solitons  time independent non - linear solutions  that arise is interesting theories in both one and three dimensions .",
    "renormalized quantum fluctuations can modify a soliton s properties , perhaps even destabilizing a classically stable solution or stabilizing a classically unstable one .",
    "the renormalization process is simpler in one dimension than it is in three , but it still must be approached carefully . merely `` canceling the infinities '' is clearly not sufficient when we want to regard a finite result as a physical prediction of a particular theory defined under fixed renormalization conditions .    in this letter",
    "we specialize the discussion of @xcite to include the case of 1-dimensional self - interacting theories .",
    "we develop an unambiguous procedure for applying standard perturbative renormalization methods to the calculation of the one - loop `` effective energy '' of a time - independent , spatially symmetric field configuration .",
    "our method is also practical and efficient for numerical calculation , which we illustrate by considering a time - independent family of configurations @xmath0 that continuously interpolates between the trivial vacuum @xmath1 and a soliton / antisoliton pair @xmath2 in @xmath3 theory .",
    "the energy of these configurations can include an imaginary part , which we show measures the instability of the system to quantum fluctuations .",
    "we also consider the exactly soluble cases such as the @xmath4 limit of the soliton / antisoliton pair , and obtain standard results that are free of cutoff ambiguities . throughout",
    ", we will be able to gain insight into these field - theoretic problems by understanding them in terms of physical quantities like phase shifts and bound state energies .",
    "the present work can be regarded in several ways . on the one hand ,",
    "one - dimensional models provide very clean pedagogical examples of the general methods developed in @xcite . on the other hand , quantum energies of one dimensional solitons are interesting in their own right , as @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite attest .",
    "our methods allow us to resolve questions that are obscure if one can only analyze quantum fluctuations about _ solutions _ to the classical equations of motion .",
    "our results on the quantum fluctuations about the @xmath3 kink are not new  they coincide with the well known results of dashen , hasslacher and neveu @xcite .",
    "however , our method displays interesting features like the correlation between imaginary frequency small oscillations and level crossing in the space of solutions to the equations of motion , and provides a simple method for avoiding ambiguities .",
    "to illustrate our method , we will consider a standard @xmath3 theory with spontaneous symmetry breaking and a source @xmath5 .",
    "the action is @xmath6 = \\frac{m^2}{\\lambda } \\int   \\left(\\half(\\partial_\\mu \\phi)^2 -   \\frac{m^2}{8}(\\phi^2 - 1)^2    - j(x)\\phi + { \\cal l}_{\\rm ct } \\right ) \\ , d^2x\\ ] ] where @xmath7 is the counterterm lagrangian .",
    "we have rescaled the field @xmath8 somewhat unconventionally in order to make explicit the correspondence between the powers of @xmath9 and the powers of @xmath10 .",
    "classical terms will go as @xmath11 , the one - loop terms we compute will go as @xmath12 , and higher loops will contribute with higher powers of @xmath9 .",
    "the mass of fluctuations around the trivial vacua @xmath13 is @xmath14 , and we define the potential @xmath15 .",
    "we consider a fixed field configuration @xmath16 .",
    "initially we will assume that @xmath17 , which restricts us to the topologically trivial sector of the theory .",
    "however , we will see that our method works equally well for the case of @xmath18 , so that in fact we can deal with configurations with any topology as long as @xmath19 has reflection symmetry .",
    "we adjust the source so that @xmath20 is a stationary point of the action , which means that @xmath21 then solves the equation @xmath22 we can always solve this equation for @xmath21 , but there is no guarantee that the @xmath21 we find will always correspond to a unique @xmath20 , as we will see later . if @xmath20 is a solution to the equations of motion , of course the source will be zero",
    ".    we would like to consider the leading quantum correction to the classical energy of this configuration , which we can represent as the sum of the zero - point energies of the normal modes of small oscillations around @xmath20 .",
    "writing @xmath23 , the normal modes are solutions of @xmath24 with @xmath25 .",
    "the quantum change in energy in going from the trivial vacuum to @xmath16 is then @xmath26 = \\half(\\sum \\omega - \\sum \\omega_0 ) + { \\cal e}_{\\rm ct } = \\delta e + { \\cal e}_{\\rm ct}\\ ] ] where @xmath27 are the free solutions ( with @xmath28 ) , and @xmath29 is the contribution from the counterterms .",
    "note that it is possible that some of the values of @xmath30 will be negative , so that in these directions our stationary point is a local maximum rather than a minimum of the action .",
    "these solutions will add an imaginary part to the energy , which we can interpret via analytic continuation as giving the decay rates through the unstable modes @xcite .",
    "if there is a direction in field space in which small oscillations lower the energy , we should be able to keep going in that direction and arrive at a lower minimum .",
    "later , we will see explicitly that the appearance of unstable modes coincides with the existence of a second solution to the @xmath20 equation with the same @xmath21 and lower energy .",
    "we would like to rewrite the sum over zero - point energies as an integral over phase space of the product of the energy and the density of states .",
    "we can then break this integral into a sum over bound states and an integral over a continuum , representing the latter in terms of phase shifts . in order to do so , however , we must review the peculiarities of levinson s theorem in one dimension . for more details on these results",
    "see @xcite and @xcite .",
    "for a symmetric @xmath31 , we can divide the continuum states into symmetric and antisymmetric channels , and then calculate the phase shift as a function of @xmath32 separately for each channel , where @xmath33 .",
    "the antisymmetric channel is completely equivalent to the @xmath34 case in three dimensions , so we have @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the number of antisymmetric bound states .",
    "however , we must be careful in dealing with the special case of a state exactly at @xmath37 . in this case the solution to eq .",
    "( [ etaeq ] ) with @xmath37 goes asymptotically to a constant as @xmath38 , as opposed to the generic case where the @xmath39 solution goes to a constant plus linear terms in @xmath40 .",
    "just as in the @xmath41 case in three dimensions , this state contributes @xmath42 to @xmath36 .",
    "we will refer to such states as `` half - bound states . ''    in the symmetric channel ,",
    "levinson s theorem becomes @xmath43 where a bound state at @xmath37 contributes @xmath42 to @xmath44 , just as in the antisymmetric case .",
    "we can see the importance of getting the half - bound states right by looking at the free case : then the phase shift is zero everywhere , and the right - hand side is zero because the free case has a half - bound state ( the wavefunction @xmath45 ) .",
    "the situation is equally subtle for reflectionless potentials , all of which have half - bound states and @xmath46 equal to an integer times @xmath47 .",
    "we are now ready to rewrite the change in the zero - point energies in terms of phase shifts . letting @xmath48",
    "be the bound state energies ( again with @xmath37 bound states contributing with a @xmath42 ) , @xmath49 be the density of states and @xmath50 be the free density of states , we have @xmath51 where @xmath52 and we have used @xmath53 note that the @xmath54 term subtracts the contribution of the free half - bound state .",
    "( [ unrenorm ] ) is divergent ( the phase shifts fall as @xmath55 for @xmath56 ) , which is what we should expect since it includes the divergent contribution from the tadpole graph without the divergent contribution from the counterterms that cancels it .    to avoid infrared problems later , we first use levinson s theorem to compute the change in particle number , which is given by @xmath57 where again , half - bound states are counted with a @xmath42 in the sum over @xmath58 and the @xmath59 comes from the contribution of the free half - bound state . subtracting @xmath60 times this equation from eq .",
    "( [ unrenorm ] ) , we have @xmath61    next , we follow @xcite and subtract the first born approximation to eq .",
    "( [ unrenormprime ] ) , which corresponds exactly to the tadpole graph .",
    "we must then add it back in using ordinary renormalized perturbation theory .",
    "however , in 1 + 1 dimensions we can adopt the simple renormalization condition that the counterterms cancel the tadpole graph and perform no additional finite renormalizations beyond this cancellation . with this choice",
    ", there is then nothing to add back in .",
    "the first born approximation is given by @xmath62 notice that the sum of these two depends on @xmath31 only through the quantity @xmath63 , so we can indeed cancel the tadpole contribution with available counterterms .",
    "subtracting the first born approximation , we have @xmath26 = \\half\\sum_j ( e_j - m ) + \\int_{0}^{\\infty } \\frac{dk}{2\\pi } ( \\omega(k)-m ) \\frac{d}{dk}(\\delta_{\\rm a}(k ) + \\delta_{\\rm s}(k ) + \\frac{\\langle v\\rangle}{k } ) \\label{renorm1}\\ ] ] which is completely finite and well - defined , since the integrand goes like @xmath64 for @xmath65 and goes to a constant at @xmath37 .",
    "in particular , we are free to integrate by parts , giving an expression that will be easier to deal with computationally , @xmath26 = \\half\\sum_j ( e_j - m ) - \\int_{0}^{\\infty } \\frac{dk}{2\\pi } \\frac{k}{\\omega(k ) } ( \\delta_{\\rm a}(k ) + \\delta_{\\rm s}(k ) + \\frac{\\langle v\\rangle}{k } ) .",
    "\\label{renorm2}\\ ] ]    the subtraction has canceled the leading @xmath55 behavior of the phase shift , leaving an integral that is finite in the ultraviolet .",
    "it must , since in 1 + 1 dimensions , eliminating the tadpole is sufficient to render the theory finite .",
    "( in 3 + 1 dimensions , we can decompose the problem into a sum of 1-dimensional problems , labeled by the angular momentum @xmath66 .",
    "we then need two subtractions : the first subtraction renders each 1-dimensional problem finite , and the second renders the sum over @xmath66 finite . )    our use of levinson s theorem to `` subtract '' @xmath67 in the infrared ( replacing eq .",
    "( [ unrenorm ] ) by eq .",
    "( [ unrenormprime ] ) ) avoided a subtlety of the born approximation in one dimension that does not occur in higher dimensions : as @xmath68 , the symmetric contribution from eq .",
    "( [ borneqn ] ) introduces a spurious infrared divergence , since it goes like @xmath55 .",
    "( each higher dimension adds a power of @xmath32 near @xmath39 .",
    "we can see this in the feynman diagram calculation , where these powers of @xmath32 come from the measure . )",
    "we can now use eq .",
    "( [ renorm2 ] ) to calculate quantum energies for specific field configurations .",
    "knowing that our model has a `` kink '' soliton solution @xmath69 , we will consider a family of field configurations that continuously interpolate between the trivial vacuum and a soliton / antisoliton pair , @xmath70 with @xmath71 measuring approximately the separation between the soliton and antisoliton . unlike the kink , these configurations are not solutions of the equations of motion , except in the @xmath72 and @xmath73 limits .",
    "thus we will need to to introduce a source that will vanish in these limits , and we must analyze the stability questions we raised earlier .    for @xmath74 very small , we simply have a small attractive perturbation from the trivial vacuum held in place by a small source , which we would not expect to introduce any instabilities . in terms of the scattering problem , for small @xmath74 ,",
    "the potential is too weak to bind a state with a binding energy greater than @xmath14 , which would give an imaginary eigenvalue .    for @xmath74 very large",
    ", we have a widely separated soliton / antisoliton pair .",
    "we know from translation invariance that a single soliton has a mode with @xmath75 .",
    "since this zero mode corresponds to a nodeless wavefunction , it is the lowest energy mode .",
    "the soliton / antisoliton pair has two translation modes that will mix , giving a symmetric eigenstate with a slightly lower energy and an antisymmetric eigenstate with a slightly higher energy .",
    "thus we expect to find a single symmetric mode with @xmath76 , which will contribute an imaginary part to @xmath77 $ ] .",
    "the imaginary part gives the rate for our field configuration to decay through this mode toward the trivial vacuum .",
    "as @xmath4 , we should find that the imaginary part goes to zero , and the real part goes to twice the energy of a single soliton , which we compute exactly below .    according to this analysis",
    ", there should be a finite , nonzero value of @xmath74 where the imaginary eigenvalue first appears . at this point ,",
    "the field becomes unstable with respect to small perturbations in some direction in field space .",
    "therefore , the energy must have a lower minimum that we can reach by moving in that direction .",
    "this configuration @xmath78 is a second stationary point of the action with the same source , which crosses @xmath20 at the value of @xmath74 where the imaginary part for the energy appears .",
    "( for smaller values of @xmath74 , this solution still exists but has higher energy . ) in terms of the scattering problem , this crossing appears when the potential has a bound state with @xmath75 .",
    "we can identify this state explicitly : since @xmath20 and @xmath79 satisfy eq .",
    "( [ jeq ] ) with the same @xmath21 , as we approach the crossing , the wavefunction @xmath80 becomes a solution to eq .",
    "( [ etaeq ] ) with @xmath75 .",
    "we have carried out this computation numerically , and find results that agree with all of these expectations . to compute the antisymmetric phase shift ,",
    "we use the method of @xcite to write @xmath81 where @xmath82 is 0 at @xmath83 and satisfies @xmath84 with prime denoting differentiation with respect to @xmath40 . to obtain the symmetric phase shift",
    ", we can follow the same derivation , but instead of imposing @xmath85 on the wavefunction , we instead impose @xmath86 , giving @xmath87 with @xmath88 the same as above , so that @xmath89    @xmath90    @xmath91    figure  [ figure1 ] shows the real and imaginary parts of @xmath77 $ ] as a functions of @xmath74 , starting from the origin at @xmath92 .",
    "when @xmath93 , a single imaginary eigenvalue appears and @xmath77 $ ] becomes complex .",
    "for @xmath74 large , @xmath77 $ ] approaches @xmath94 , twice the standard result for a single soliton . figure  [ figure1a ] shows the path of the energy in the complex plane parametrically as a function of the separation . the actual trajectory of @xmath77 $ ] in the complex plane has little significance , since it depends in detail on the functional form of @xmath0 .",
    "however , the general features  beginning at the origin , moving up the real axis , out into the complex plane , and finally asymptotically to the real two - solution value  are characteristics of any @xmath20 that begins at the vacuum and ends at a well separated kink and antikink .",
    "[ figure2 ] shows @xmath95 and the second solution to the equations of motion with the same @xmath21 , @xmath78 .",
    "@xmath79 goes to the trivial vacuum as @xmath4 , and becomes a widely separated soliton / antisoliton pair as @xmath72 , crossing @xmath20 at @xmath96 . for @xmath74 below this value , @xmath20 has lower classical energy , while above this point , @xmath79 has lower classical energy , and this crossing appears precisely where the imaginary eigenvalue appears in the small oscillations spectrum .",
    "@xmath97    through this continuous deformation from the trivial vacuum , we have arrived at a widely separated soliton / antisoliton pair , which we can now separate into independent configurations with nontrivial topology .",
    "these configurations are exactly soluble , so we will be able to study them analytically .",

    "in one dimensional quantum mechanics , potentials of the form @xmath98 with @xmath66 an integer are exactly soluble and reflectionless .",
