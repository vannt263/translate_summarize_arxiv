    "ultra - cold atoms in optical lattices offer the possibility of realizing various fundamental models of strongly correlated bosons and fermions  @xcite .",
    "a crucial aspect of the optical lattice system is its flexibility in controlling different lattice parameters and particle interactions , thereby facilitating progress towards the creation of quantum emulators .",
    "after the observation of the superfluid to mott insulator transition with spin-0 bosons  @xcite , steady progress has been made towards trapping spinful atoms .",
    "these models , along with a precise knowledge and tunability of the microscopic hamiltonian can potentially lead to a better understanding of quantum magnetism , and related phenomena . unlike magnetic traps which freeze the @xmath1 component of spin ,",
    "optical traps can confine @xmath2na , @xmath3k , and @xmath4rb with hyperfine spin @xmath5 .",
    "several theoretical studies have focused on spinor condensates in an optical lattice  @xcite and how the spin degree of freedom modifies the phase diagram and the nature of superfluid - mott insulator transition .",
    "experiments have also explored the properties of spinful bosons in harmonic traps  @xcite and , recently , in a double well optical superlattice  @xcite .    the technological breakthrough in cooling to ultra - cold temperatures paved the way for the realization of bose - einstein condensation and optical lattice experiments .",
    "the temperature of a bosonic gas in a trap can be measured accurately . however , no established temperature measurement exists for optical lattice systems , although several proposals have been made  @xcite .",
    "this makes it difficult to obtain a quantitative description of the various low temperature phases and thermal and quantum phase transitions between them  @xcite .    in current experiments ,",
    "ultra - cold atoms are first loaded in a harmonic trap , and then an external sinusoidal potential created by interfering lasers are slowly ramped up to create the optical lattice . for gradual enough ramping",
    ", there is no heat exchange with the environment , and this process can be considered adiabatic ( constant entropy )  @xcite .",
    "it is of great interest to the experimentalists to know how the system cools down or heats up during the adiabatic process .",
    "the change in temperature with adiabatic ramp - up of optical lattice for the spinless bose - hubbard model and the fermi hubbard model has been studied by several authors  @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we present the isentropes for spin-1 bosons in a homogeneous optical lattice for both ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic spin couplings .",
    "we investigate the effects of adiabatic ramping on temperature within the mean - field approximation , and show that for spinor bosons cooling occurs in the superfluid phase and heating occurs in the mott insulator or normal phase .",
    "we find that the heating - cooling separatrix lies along the superfluid - mott phase boundary . as the magnitude of spin coupling increases , the rate of temperature change decreases in the mott regime , and can both increase and decrease in the superfluid regime depending on the value of the spin coupling .",
    "we find that the mean - field isentropes for low initial entropy terminate at the superfluid - mott insulator phase boundary and argue that this is a consequence of the absence of breaking of the degeneracy of the ground state in the mean field approximation .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "we discuss the spin-1 bose - hubbard model and the details of the mean - field theory in section ii . in section iii , we investigate the entropy for this model , and present our results for the isentropes and temperature changes for different couplings . a summary is contained in section iv .",

    "in fact , all the mean - field isentropes that we obtain show this pattern - there is cooling in the sf regime and heating in the mi regime with the heating - cooling separatrix exactly on the phase boundary .",
    "the occurence of cooling in the sf phase and heating in the mott phase , and the location of the heating - cooling separatrix exactly on the phase boundary can be understood with the following physical argument - moving away from the phase boundary towards higher @xmath78 , one enters the mott phase with reduced number fluctuations and an integer number of atoms per site .",
    "so , as @xmath78 increases at constant @xmath60 , the entropy is reduced .",
    "therefore , if we want to keep the entropy constant as @xmath78 increases , the temperature must rise , and there is heating in the mott phase .",
    "similarly , moving away from the phase boundary towards the sf regime by decreasing @xmath78 , more and more particles enter the condensate , reducing the quantum depletion .",
    "more particles entering the condensate means entropy is decreasing since the condensate carries no entropy .",
    "so , to keep s constant as @xmath78 decreases in the sf , there must again be heating in the system .",

    "[ fig : isen1](a ) continue to the mi phase .",
    "this termination of the isentropic lines is a shortcoming of the mean - field theory treatment .",

    "[ fig : isen3](b ) does not have a huge impact on the isentropes .",
    "however , for antiferromagnetic coupling @xmath10 in fig .",
    "[ fig : isen3](c ) , we see that the isentropes are visibly different as is the shape of the phase boundary . inside the sf ,",
    "the system cools down very slowly .",
    "[ fig : u2rho2 ] shows the heating rate @xmath114 for a constant entropy ( s=2.5 ) in the second mott lobe as @xmath28 is turned on . unlike the case for the first mott lobe ( fig .",
    "[ fig : u2 ] ) , there is no maximum at @xmath8 , and the heating rate increases monotonically with @xmath28 . for @xmath18 and @xmath14 ,",
    "the sf / mott phase boundary is first order , and a spin singlet phase is formed in the mott region .",
    "the appearance of order in the singlet phase greatly affects the heating properties .",
    "in this paper we have extended previous mean field theory treatments of the spin-1 bose hubbard model to compute the isentropic lines .",
    "these quantities are of considerable experimental importance to understand thermometry in ultra - cold atomic gases in an optical lattice .",

    "the isentropes have a number of interesting features .",
    "first , they exhibit pure cooling within the sf and heating in the normal / mott phase .",
    "the phase boundary precisely corresponds to the location of the change in sign of @xmath114 , i.e. the heating - cooling separatrix lies on the sf - mi phase boundary .",
    "this can be understood in the symmetric view of heating as one moves away in @xmath78 from the phase boundary in either direction of sf / mott .",
    "the system gets more ordered with reduced entropy . and",
    "therefore , temperature must increase to keep the entropy constant .",
    "second , the low entropy ( low temperature ) isentropes terminate on the phase boundary because of the nonzero ground state entropy which mean field theory gives for the mott phase . for noncommensurate fillings ,",
    "the isentropes show similar characteristics except that the low entropy lines do not terminate at the phase boundary .",
    "the effect of ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic couplings on isentropes has been examined , and we quantify the rate of heating as @xmath28 changes .",
    "we find that in the experimentally relevant regime of @xmath119 for @xmath2na and @xmath4rb , the changes in heating - cooling rate is not very different from the @xmath8 case",
    ". it would be interesting to extend qmc simulations of the magnetic and superfluid properties on the spinor bose - hubbard model to study these thermodynamic properties as well .",
