    "einstein - podolsky - rosen ( epr ) steering , which was originally introduced by schrdinger @xcite in response to the epr paradox @xcite , describes the ability of one party , alice , to affect the state of another remote party , bob , through her measurements on one of an entangled pair shared between them .",
    "such effect recently is reformulated in terms of a information - theoretic task @xcite showing that two parties can share entanglement even if the measurement devices of alice are untrusted .",
    "this also shows a hierarchy between bell non - locality , steering and entanglement . to rule out the classical mimicry of steering , epr steering inequalities @xcite and steering measures @xcite are introduced to detect the steerability of bipartite quantum systems .",
    "combined with the tools to certify steering , epr steering has stimulated application to quantum key distribution ( qkd ) when one of the parties can not trust their measurement apparatus , i.e. , one - sided device - independent qkd @xcite .    there has been a range of investigations into potential extensions of epr steering since the reformulation introduced by wiseman , jones and doherty @xcite .",
    "for example , it has been shown that epr steering can occur in only one direction @xcite , from alice to bob but not from bob to alice .",
    "genuine multipartite steering @xcite are introduced to generalize the original bipartite steering effect .",
    "in addition , a temporal analog of the steering inequality has been introduced @xcite .",
    "the concept of quantum steering for single quantum systems and its role in quantum information processing have been investigated further @xcite .",
    "such that bob s qudit state is in @xmath2 where @xmath3 .",
    "( [ epru ] ) and its discussions . in ( b ) , a qudit with the state @xmath4 is sent from alice to bob . here",
    "@xmath4 is a post - measurement state of a initial qudit @xmath5 under the measurement @xmath6 for @xmath7 .",
    "alice can steer the state of bob s particle into other states by doing herself or asking him to perform the quantum operation @xmath8 . while the resources utilized for quantum steering in ( a ) and ( b ) are different , the state of the particle finally held by bob can be steered into a corresponding quantum state , @xmath9 , for both quantum steering scenarios.,width=302 ]    for practical tests of steering , experimental demonstrations of epr steering have been presented in several quantum systems . these experiments successfully test steering among bipartite @xcite and multipartite @xcite systems .",
    "a detection of temporal steering also has been reported recently @xcite .",
    "inspired by all of these studies on steering between remote parties or temporal points , we go a step further and consider the following question : how does the quantum steering change with the dimension of considered systems ? while the original concern of steering focus on the overall characteristic of a physical system that shows steerability , the system dimensionality indeed plays a role in manifesting properties that constitute a physical object .",
    "here , we use the newly introduced quantum witnesses @xcite to experimentally observe quantum steering . both epr steering and the single - system ( ss ) steering",
    "are considered in our experimental demonstrations . as will be shown presently , these steering effects vary with the system dimensionality and reveal stronger non - classical features as the dimensionality increases .",
    "the present study investigates further the utilities of the steering witnesses @xcite and shows , to our knowledge , the first experimental demonstration revealing an increase of quantum steering with dimensions .    in order to introduce our experimental scenario and the main results , we firstly present an unified way to review epr steering and the ss steering .",
    "alice s ability to affect the quantum state bob has access to is based on ( 1 ) her ability to prepare a quantum source shared between her and bob , and ( 2 ) her knowledge about the state bob finally receives ; see fig .",
    "[ steering ] .",
    "alice utilizes entangled pairs of quantum @xmath0-dimensional systems ( qudits ) as the quantum source when showing epr steering [ fig .",
    "[ steering](a ) ] , whereas she generates single - quantum systems with arbitrary states to bob for the ss steering [ fig .",
    "[ steering](b ) ] .",
    "when alice is certain that the entangled qudits eventually shared between them is as expected , she can prepare a target state for bob by measuring her qudit of the entangled pair .",
    "compared with such preparation of bob s state in epr steering , the target state in the scenario of ss steering is prepared by directly sending single systems with designed states from alice to bob . for both types of quantum steering , if alice has full information about the quantum system bob is holding , she is capable of _ steering _ the system into an arbitrary state .",
    "let us concretely show how alice achieves epr steering reviewed above .",
    "first , the entanglement source ( or called epr source ) [ fig .",
    "[ steering](a ) ] creates @xmath0-dimensional entangled pairs of the form @xmath10 where @xmath11 is an orthonormal bases . @xmath12 and @xmath13 denote the measurement of alice and bob , respectively .",
    "second , alice keeps one particle of the entangled pair and sends the other qudit to bob . a subsequent unitary operator @xmath8 is applied on the bob s subsystem according to the instructions of alice .",
    "this transformation can be done either by bob after receiving the particle , or by alice herself before the transmission of the particle .",
    "after such transformation , the state vector of the bipartite system becomes @xmath14 then , depending on alice s measurement result @xmath15 , the state of the particle finally held by bob can be steered into a corresponding quantum state , @xmath16 .",
    "when the state @xmath17 is represented in the bases @xmath18 for the measurement @xmath19 and @xmath20 for the measurement @xmath21 , where @xmath22 for @xmath23 , we have @xmath24 where @xmath25 denotes equality modulo @xmath0 . as alice measures on her qudit with a result @xmath26 ,",
    "bob s qudit is then steered into the quantum state , @xmath27 , where @xmath28 .",
    "if bob takes the complementary measurements on his particle @xmath29 and @xmath30 that are specified by the orthonormal bases @xmath31 , he will know the results @xmath32 designed by alice with certainty .",
    "we remark that , for an epr source creating entangled states that are different from @xmath17 , the transformation @xmath8 could be implemented in other ways .",
    "for example , when alice and bob share bipartite supersinglets @xcite , which are expressed as @xmath33 , for @xmath7 , alice can steer the state of bob by directly measuring her qudit in a basis featured in @xmath8 .",
    "since supersinglets are rotationally invariant @xcite , i.e. , @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is a rotation operator , alice s measurement in the basis @xmath36 will steer the state of bob s qudit into a corresponding state , @xmath37 , for @xmath38 . for @xmath39 , supersinglets become unitary invarient and provide a resource for implementing any unitary transformations @xmath8 to bob s qubit .",
    "compared with epr steering , alice can realize the ss steering by following the single - system - analogue steps . as depicted in fig .",
    "[ steering](b ) , first , alice prepares a state @xmath3 by performing complementary measurements @xmath12 or @xmath19 on an initial state , say @xmath40 .",
    "second , alice sends the particle with the state @xmath4 to bob and steers the state @xmath4 into other quantum state @xmath9 , by directly performing the unitary transformation @xmath8 before the particle transmission , or publicly , via a classical channel , ask bob to apply @xmath8 on @xmath41 . here the complementary measurements on bob s particle @xmath29 and @xmath30 are specified by the orthonormal bases @xmath42 with the results @xmath32 .",
    "the steering features of the entangled states @xmath17 and the states of single quantum systems @xmath4 can be revealed by using steering witnesses .",
    "these tools considered in our experiments are of the from @xmath43 @xcite , where @xmath44 is the witness kernel and @xmath45 is the maximum value of the kernel supported by classical mimicry .",
    "@xmath44 are designed according to some target quantum sources , then such quantum witnesses can be experimentally implemented without invoking any quantum tomographic techniques . for ideal steering , @xmath44 will be maximized . since ruling out classical mimicry is equivalent to excluding _ unsteerable states _ , exceeding the bound @xmath45 will deny processes ( e.g. , noisy channels ) that make once steerable states unsteerable and thus assist in confirming genuine quantum steering .",
    "the witness kernel of epr steering used in our experimental verification is @xmath46 where @xmath47 are the joint probabilities of getting @xmath48 by alice and @xmath49 by bob . for ss steering",
    ", the witness kernel reads @xmath50 the joint probability can be represented further by @xmath51 , where @xmath52 and @xmath53 denote the marginal probability of measuring @xmath48 by alice and the probability of obtaining @xmath49 by bob conditioned on the alice s result @xmath48 , respectively . here , without losing any generality ,",
    "we have assumed that @xmath54 in the steering scenario ( see fig .",
    "[ steering ] ) . for ideal @xmath0-dimensional steering by using the source @xmath17 or @xmath4 ,",
    "these kernels have the maximum value @xmath55 ( note that we shall use @xmath56 to signify both @xmath57 and @xmath58 hereafter ) . whereas , for the unsteerable states , the maximum value of @xmath56 is @xmath59 for both the types of steering witnesses .",
    "thus , if experimental results show that @xmath60 then the created states are steerable . for any unsteerable states",
    "the measured kernel will not certified by the witnesses .",
    "see appendix a.    one of the important features of the steering witnesses considered in this paper is that @xmath61 for any @xmath62-dimensional systems where @xmath63 .",
    "the reason is that the witness kernels @xmath57 ( [ wepr ] ) and @xmath58 ( [ wss ] ) are composed of joint probabilities for outcomes observed under two complementary measurements such that the maximum of @xmath55 can not be satisfied by @xmath62-dimensional systems .    for the witness kernel @xmath57 ,",
    "it is clear that @xmath17 is the only state such that @xmath64 .",
    "hence , for any states with @xmath63 , the measured witness kernels are smaller than @xmath65 . for the case of the ss steering ,",
    "let us assume that alice s apparatuses support desired measurements on @xmath0-dimensional systems , but , for state preparations , she has only the ability to create @xmath62-dimensional states sent to bob for @xmath63 .",
    "on the side of bob , we assume that his measurement devices can realize state distinctions between @xmath0-dimensional states for @xmath13 and @xmath21 measurements .",
    "suppose that @xmath66 of a @xmath62-dimensional system is sent to alice for measurements and that bob s qudit state is the same as the qudit sent by alice , we have the maximal sum of the joint probabilities under the measurement @xmath67 , i.e. , @xmath68 .",
    "since @xmath69 is complementary to @xmath67 , the maximal sum alice s @xmath62-dimensional systems can give is only @xmath70 the first term , @xmath71 , is the probability @xmath72 and the last two are derived from the @xmath0 terms of the maximum of the overlap between the prepared state by alice @xmath73 and the projected state @xmath74 of bob s measurements .",
    "thus for such @xmath62-dimensional systems we have @xmath75 .",
    "+ in oder to concretely see how steering effects vary with the system dimensionality , we consider the ratio between the measured witness and the maximum value achieved by classical mimicries of the form : @xmath76 for the cases where state preparations and measurements are perfect , i.e. , we have the theoretical values @xmath55 , it is clear to see that this ratio is monotonically increasing with @xmath0 and @xmath77 for any @xmath78 , for example , @xmath79 and for the case of large @xmath0 , we have @xmath80 . the steering properties certified by the witnesses  ( [ wdu ] ) reveal that , compared with the usual quantum steering of qubits ( @xmath39 ) , multidimensional quantum systems ( @xmath81 ) provide stronger steering and manifest more distinct quantum violations as @xmath0 increases .      to investigate the characteristic of multidimensional steering predicted from the steering witnesses [ eqs .",
    "( [ wdu ] ) and ( [ rd ] ) ] , we define that the qudit is composed of multiple particles .",
    "this method is also used in parallel to prepare multidimensional systems for testing bell inequalities @xcite .",

    "can be rephrased in terms of qubit states by @xmath92 where @xmath93 with the state decompositions ( [ s1 ] ) and ( [ s2 ] ) , the qudits with the states @xmath4 used for the ss steering can be then prepared from qubits in the states @xmath94 and @xmath95 as well .",
    "hence the measurements @xmath67 and @xmath69 required to experimentally determine the witness kernel @xmath56 can be performed on individual qubits .",
    "suppose that we have an experimental state @xmath96 where @xmath97 is the state of the @xmath98th entangled pair , the joint probabilities in the kernel @xmath57 predicted by quantum mechanics can be represented in terms of the probabilities of individual pairs of entangled states by @xmath99.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the above form follows from the fact that the @xmath0-dimensional density matrix @xmath100 can be constructed by @xmath82-pair of qubits . hence , the kernel of the multidimensional steering witness @xmath57 can be determined from the outcomes of measurements of individual entangled pairs .",
    "for the case of two ensembles of perfect entangled states @xmath17 , @xmath57 is maximal , that is , @xmath55 for any @xmath0 .",

    "the unqualified bipartite state shared between her and bob , and a subsequent unqualified operation , can result in such assumptions .",
    "it is reasonable to incorporate the entanglement source into the measurement apparatus as a single unqualified experiment setup for alice .",

    "the state of the particle that bob holds is then @xmath121 .",
    "hence the state of the system held by bob is unsteerable .",
