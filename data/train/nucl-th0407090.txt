    "<S> the renormalization of eft for nucleon - nucleon scattering in nonperturbative regimes is investigated in a compact parametrization of the @xmath0-matrix . the key difference between perturbative and nonperturbative renormalization </S>",
    "<S> is clarified . the underlying theory perspective and the fixing of the prescriptions for the @xmath0-matrix from physical boundary conditions are stressed .    </S>",
    "<S> * renormalization of eft for nucleon - nucleon scattering * +   + _ department of physics , east china normal university , shanghai 200062 , china + _    [ [ section ] ]    in recent years , the effective field theory ( eft ) method has become the main tool to deal with various low energy processes and strong interactions in the nonperturbative regime . </S>",
    "<S> beginning from weinberg s seminal works@xcite , this method has been extensively and successfully applied to the low energy nucleon systems@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> as an eft parametrizes the high energy details in a simple way , there appear severe uv divergences ( or ill - definedness ) and more undetermined constants that must be fixed somehow . owing to the nonperturbative nature </S>",
    "<S> , the eft for nuclear forces also becomes a theoretical laboratory for studying the nonperturbative renormalization and a variety of renormalization ( and power counting ) schemes have been proposed@xcite . however , a complete consensus and understanding on this important issue has yet not been reached . </S>",
    "<S> though the eft philosophy is very natural , but its implementation requires discretion ( in parametrizing the short distance effects)@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , as will be shown below , the nonperturbative context impedes the implementation of conventional subtraction renormalization , and some regularization / renormalization ( r / r ) prescription might even fail the eft method or physical predictions@xcite , unlike in the perturbative case@xcite .    in this short report </S>",
    "<S> , we shall revisit the problem without specifying the r / r scheme ( we only need that the renormalization is done ) to elucidate the key features for the implementation of r / r in nonperturbative regime , and various proposals could be compared and discussed . then the key principles that should be followed are suggested as the first steps in such understandings .    [ </S>",
    "<S> [ section-1 ] ]    the physical object we are going to investigate is the transition matrix @xmath0 for nucleon - nucleon scattering processes at low energies , @xmath1which satisfies the lippmann - schwinger ( ls ) equation in partial wave formalism , @xmath2 with @xmath3 and @xmath4 being respectively the center energy and the reduced mass , @xmath5 ( @xmath6 ) being the momentum vector for the incoming ( outgoing ) nucleon , and @xmath7 , @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> the potential @xmath9 can be systematically constructed from the @xmath10pt@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we remind that the constructed potential is understood to be finite first , as tree vertices in the usual field theory terminology .    </S>",
    "<S> now let us transform the above ls equation into the following compact form as a nonperturbative parametrization of @xmath0-matrix , we temporarily drop all the subscripts that labelling the status of the finiteness and divergence : @xmath11where @xmath12 is obviously a nonperturbative quantity . here </S>",
    "<S> @xmath13 , @xmath0 and therefore @xmath14 are momenta dependent matrix in angular momentum space . in field theory language </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath14 contains all the loop processes generated by the 4-nucleon vertex @xmath13 joined by nucleon ( and antinucleon ) lines@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this nonperturbative parametrization clearly separates @xmath13 ( born amplitude ) from @xmath14 ( all the iterations or rescatterings ) , and on - shell ( @xmath15 ) unitarity ( nonperturbative relation ) of @xmath0 is automatically satisfied here thanks to the on - shell relation between the @xmath16-matrix and @xmath0-matrix@xcite @xmath17 using eq . </S>",
    "<S> (  [ npt ] ) we have @xmath18 any approximation to the quantity @xmath14 leads to a nonperturbative scheme for @xmath0 .    since the on - shell </S>",
    "<S> @xmath0-matrix must be physical , then for general potential functions this nonperturbative parametrization leads to the following obvious but important observations in turn : ( i ) it is impossible to renormalize @xmath14 through conventional perturbative counter terms in @xmath13 ( we will demonstrate this point shortly ) , i.e. , they have to be separately renormalized ; ( ii ) the perturbative pattern of the scheme dependence for transition matrix or physical observables@xcite breaks down in the nonperturbative contexts like eq . </S>",
    "<S> (  [ npt ] ) ; ( iii ) the r / r for @xmath13 and @xmath14 must be so performed that the on - shell @xmath0-matrix satisfies physical boundary conditions ( bound state and/or resonance poles@xcite , scattering lengths or phase shifts@xcite , etc . ) , i.e , @xmath13 and @xmath14 are locked with each other ; ( iv ) due to this locking , the validity of the eft power counting in constructing @xmath13 also depends on the r / r prescription for @xmath14 , i.e. , the power counting of @xmath13 could be vitiated by the r / r prescription for @xmath14 which is performed afterwards . </S>",
    "<S> this explains why there are a lot of debates on the consistent power counting schemes for constructing @xmath13 . </S>",
    "<S> point ( iii ) is in fact what most authors actually did or is implicit in their treatments . </S>",
    "<S> we will return to these points later .    to be more concrete or to demonstrate the first point ( observation ( i ) ) , let us consider the case without mixing ( @xmath19 ) for simplicity . </S>",
    "<S> then the matrices become diagonal and only energy dependent due to on - shell condition , we have the following simple form of nonperturbative parametrization ( from now on we will drop the subscript `` os '' for on - shell ) ) by @xmath20 and @xmath21 and rearranging the terms . ] , @xmath22where @xmath23 . in perturbative formulation , </S>",
    "<S> all the divergences are removed order by order _ before _ </S>",
    "<S> the loop diagrams are summed up . here , in eq . </S>",
    "<S> (  [ partialw ] ) ( or eq . </S>",
    "<S> (  [ npt ] ) ) , the renormalization are desired to be performed on the compact nonperturbative parametrization . </S>",
    "<S> after @xmath13 is calculated and renormalized within @xmath10pt , the task is ( a ) to remove the divergence or ill - definedness in @xmath24 and ( b ) to make sure that the renormalized quantities ( @xmath25 and @xmath26 ) lead to a physical @xmath0-matrix . </S>",
    "<S> the most important one is ( b ) , namely the @xmath0-matrix obtained must possess reasonable or desirable physical behaviors after removing the divergences . </S>",
    "<S> technically , this amounts to a stringent criterion for the r / r prescription in use : the functional form of @xmath24 could not be altered , only the divergent parameters ( coefficients ) get replaced by finite ones .    </S>",
    "<S> now let us suppose @xmath27 could be renormalized by introducing counter terms . </S>",
    "<S> within this parametrization of eq . </S>",
    "<S> (  [ partialw ] ) , the potential @xmath13 appears as the only candidate to bear counter terms , then from eq . </S>",
    "<S> (  [ partialw ] ) we would have @xmath28where the superscripts @xmath29 and @xmath30 refer to renormalized and bare , @xmath31 denotes the additive counter terms and @xmath32 .    from the definition below eq . </S>",
    "<S> (  [ npt ] ) , @xmath14 must take the following form which is no less complicated than a nonpolynomial function in @xmath33 , @xmath34with @xmath35 being at least two nontrivial divergent or ill - defined polynomials . with this parametrization , </S>",
    "<S> eq . </S>",
    "<S> (  [ ct ] ) becomes @xmath36 note that in the divergent or ill - defined fraction @xmath37 only @xmath38 is finite . then except for the simplest form of @xmath39 (= @xmath40 , see , e.g. , ref.@xcite ) , it is impossible to obtain a nontrivial and finite fraction out of the this divergent fraction with _ </S>",
    "<S> whatever _ </S>",
    "<S> counter terms @xmath41 , i.e. , it is impossible to remove the divergences in the numerator and the denominator at the same time _ with the same _ counter terms as in eq . </S>",
    "<S> (  [ ct2 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> examples for nonperturbative divergent fractions could be found in ref.@xcite . even by chance </S>",
    "<S> @xmath14 is finite , then its functional form in terms of physical parameters ( @xmath42 ) must have been altered ( often oversimplified ) after letting the cutoffs go infinite . for channels with mixing , with @xmath43 and @xmath27 becoming @xmath44 matrices , all the preceding deductions still apply . </S>",
    "<S> thus within nonperturbative regime the counter term ( via potential ) renormalization of @xmath0-matrix fails , that is , @xmath14 must be separately renormalized  the first observation given above is demonstrated as promised . </S>",
    "<S> the other observations follow easily .    </S>",
    "<S> what we have just shown does not mean that the counter term fails at any rate . </S>",
    "<S> the above arguments showed that the counter term could not successfully renormalize the nonperturbative @xmath45 or @xmath0-matrix _ except _ they are introduced _ before _ the corresponding infinite perturbative series are summed up or _ before _ all parts of the nonperturbative objects are put together and installed , say , before the corresponding schrdinger equation is solved . </S>",
    "<S> it is well known that the schrdinger equation approach@xcite or similar@xcite is intrinsically nonperturbative , therefore the counter terms introduced there ( as parts of the potential operators ) are nonperturbative in the sense that they enter _ before _ the @xmath0-matrix or phase shifts are finally derived , or equivalently , they must enter before the perturbative series are summed up . </S>",
    "<S> so there is no contradiction between our conclusion here and that in ref.@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in fact they are in complete harmony and our conclusion above turns out to be also supporting the schrdinger equation approach for renormalizing nucleon - nucleon scattering . </S>",
    "<S> thus our discussions above are helpful to clarify the difference between perturbative and nonperturbative renormalization or to remove some mists or controversies around the renormalization of eft for nucleon - nucleon scattering .    to make our language more concise </S>",
    "<S> , we would temporarily call the counter terms endogenous to an object if they must enter before all the necessary calculations on the interested object are done , and exogenous otherwise .    </S>",
    "<S> [ [ section-2 ] ]    therefore the renormalization in nonperturbative regime have to be implemented either with endogenous counter terms ( e.g.,@xcite ) or otherwise ( e.g. , like in refs.@xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> to proceed we recall the conceptual foundation for eft method : there must be a complete theory underlying all the low energy efts . </S>",
    "<S> suppose we could compute the @xmath0-matrix in the underlying theory , then in the low energy limit , we should obtain a finite matrix element parametrized in terms of eft coupling constants and certain _ finite constants arising from the limit_. it is these constants that we are after . </S>",
    "<S> in the ill - defined eft frameworks , a r / r or subtraction prescription is employed to retrieve the finite constants . </S>",
    "<S> as we have seen the failure of the counter term subtraction at the potential or vertex level in nonperturbative parametrization , the renormalization must be otherwise implemented . </S>",
    "<S> a prompt choice is the subtraction at the integral level , and the counter term formalism is dismissed from the underlying theory point of view . in this sense , the formal consistency issue of weinberg power countings@xcite is naturally dissolved without resorting to other means , and the real concern is the renormalization instead of power counting rules . </S>",
    "<S> this resolution is in fact just a paraphrase of the fourth observation in section two ( point ( iv ) ) : a consistent power counting could be vitiated by the afterward renormalization procedures such as those using exogenous counter terms .    </S>",
    "<S> if the ill - definedness only originates from the local part of the potential , the integral level subtraction is ok as the divergent integrals can be cleanly isolated@xcite . for the more interesting cases with general pion - exchange contributions , such clean isolation seems impossible , which leads some authors to perturbative approach ( ksw@xcite ) , but the convergence is shown to be slow@xcite and the ksw power counting also bears some problems@xcite . due to such difficulties , the regularization schemes with finite cutoffs or parameters have also been adopted to keep the investigations nonperturbative@xcite , which have to be numerical . in such approaches certain sort of fitting to data is incorporated in one way or the other , this is what we stressed in section two . </S>",
    "<S> there recently appears a new approach that constructs the nonperturbative @xmath0-matrix from the ksw approach@xcite , where again certain sort of fitting is crucial there .    </S>",
    "<S> then it is clear that the main obstacle is the severe regularization dependence in nonperturbative regime . </S>",
    "<S> if we could parametrize all the ill - definedness in ambiguous but finite expressions , then the obstacle would disappear and the only task is to fix the ambiguities . </S>",
    "<S> otherwise , any theoretical judgement just based on one regularization scheme is unwarranted or ungrounded unless it is justified in various schemes @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the importance of regularization in nonperturbative regime could also be seen in the following way : for any r / r prescription in nonperturbative regimes to be able to reproduce such true @xmath0-matrix obtained from underlying theory , the regularization in use should at least reproduce the same nonperturbative functional expression as that given in underlying theory , with certain constants being adjustable , otherwise the true functional expression could not be approached since exogenous counter terms , as we have shown above , could not be effected in nonperturbative parametrization . </S>",
    "<S> alternatively , the foregoing arguments could be interpreted as a call for a devise of a new nonperturbative framework where endogenous counter terms could be naturally incorporated .    </S>",
    "<S> our parametrization also points towards a new technical direction for the nonperturbative determination of the @xmath0-matrix : to focus on the calculation of @xmath24 . </S>",
    "<S> the relevance of r / r in @xmath14 can be made clearer in the low energy expansion of @xmath14 ( pad or taylor ) since it is necessarily a function of the center energy ( @xmath3 ) or on - shell momentum ( @xmath46 ) : @xmath47 here the coefficients @xmath48 will inevitably be r / r dependent and must be determined together with the parameters in the potential from physical boundary conditions , say the empirical phase shifts in the low energy ends@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> investigations along this line are in progress@xcite and the primary the results are interesting . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , there is several virtues in such analysis : firstly , one needs not to carry out the concrete the renormalization of @xmath14 ; secondly , by comparing with low energy region of the empirical data of @xmath49 scattering ( say , @xmath50 ) one could in principle easily obtain the optimal values for the semi - phenomenological parameters ( @xmath51 ) which in turn could yield a pretty good prediction of higher energy behaviors though the parametrization formula of eq . </S>",
    "<S> (  [ npt ] ) is strikingly simple ; thirdly , with such simple tools one could test whether eft systematically works for @xmath49 scattering ; fourthly , one could also use it to estimate if the potential constructed up to a certain order is sufficient for various purposes _ without any loop calculations and renormalization operations_. moreover , due to its simplicity in principle , one might also find other uses like the estimation of the coupling constants of the local terms in constructed potential . this list could be further enlarged . </S>",
    "<S> we will visit them in the near future . in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ 1d2 ] we serve a primary example for such analysis@xcite employing the potential given by egm@xcite : the phase shifts of @xmath52 channel predicted only with a _ single </S>",
    "<S> _ parameter @xmath53 with potentials input at leading order ( lo ) , next - to - leading order ( nlo ) and next - to - next - to - leading order ( nnlo ) , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> it is clear that the prediction of the phase shift for the range @xmath54 with only one optimized or fitted parameter of @xmath55 , @xmath56 , improves with the chiral order for the constructed potential ( lo , nlo , and nnlo ) . for most channels this seems true </S>",
    "<S> of course , there could well be exceptions , which we interpret it as insufficiency of the chiral expansion in the corresponding channel(s ) .    in summary , we proposed a simple and novel parametrization for understanding the nonperturbative renormalization of the @xmath0-matrix for nucleon - nucleon scattering . </S>",
    "<S> the distinctive feature of the nonperturbative renormalization  the failure of exogenous counter terms or the need of endogenous ones  is clarified together with some related issues like consistency of w power counting . by the way we could derive other uses from our simple parametrization of the @xmath0-matrix that might be of some academic values . </S>",
    "<S> we hope our investigation might be useful for a number of important issues related to nucleon interactions , and also to other nonperturbative problems .     </S>",
    "<S> ( mev ) of @xmath52 channel at lo , nlo and nnlo with the simplest parametrization @xmath57 . </S>",
    "<S> also listed is the curve for pwa . for each order </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath58 is fitted to or optimized in the low energy region of the pwa data.,width=377 ] </S>"
