    "due to the broadcast nature of the wireless medium , simultaneously transmitted signals from multiple source nodes cause interference to each other .",
    "the interference gives rise to competition between different information flows , but it can also be exploited for cooperation between them . understanding the complex interplay between cooperation and competition is the key to understanding the capacity limits of wireless networks . in spite of an abundance of literature studying cooperative interference networks , the understanding of this topic  even at a coarse degrees - of - freedom ( dof ) level  is far from mature , as evident from any sampling of recent works on dof characterizations of cooperative interference networks that have produced surprising insights .",
    "continuing in the same spirit , in this work we seek to illuminate a few interesting and fundamental aspects of the interplay between cooperation and competition , from a dof perspective .",
    "the setting we wish to explore is the 2 user interference channel with an instantaneous relay .      from a dof perspective",
    ", the two user interference channel represents competition for resources in the strongest sense  whatever dof one user is able to achieve , comes at the cost of an equal amount of the other user s dof .",
    "this is because it is well known that the 2 user interference channel has only 1 dof , which can be achieved by any orthogonal time division policy between the two users .      to alleviate the competition between the two users ,",
    "the use of relay nodes has been considered .",
    "indeed , there are several results that show increased rates in the form of snr gains from employing a relay in an interference channel @xcite .",
    "dof gains are achieved with the use of relays when source and destination nodes are not directly connected , e.g. , in _ layered _ relay networks .",
    "reference @xcite provides a characterization of the dof of the multihop 2 user interference channel with layered relays .",
    "however , if direct channel coefficients between source and destination nodes are non - zero , then from a dof perspective , it has been shown that the use of relays does _ not _ contribute any dof gain for the 2 user interference channel @xcite , regardless of the number of relay nodes .",
    "remarkably , this is true even if the relay nodes are equipped with multiple antennas .      since",
    "conventional relays are shown not to increase the dof of a two user interference channel , we explore another form of relaying , introduced by el gamal and hassanpour @xcite , known as _ instantaneous relaying _ ( _ relay - without - delay _ ) .",
    "unlike the classical relay whose transmitted signal is a function of only past observations , the transmitted signal from an instantaneous relay , is allowed to depend on both past and _ current _ received signals .",
    "furthermore , a _ memoryless _ instantaneous relay is a constrained form of an instantaneous relay , where the transmitted signal is allowed to depend _ only on the current _ received signal .",
    "clearly , a memoryless instantaneous relay is a simpler but less powerful relay than a general instantaneous relay , which in turn is more powerful than a conventional relay .",
    "interestingly , no order relationship necessarily exists between conventional relays and instantaneous memoryless relay . because the latter has the benefit of being able to react to the current received signal but the handicap of having no memory of past received signals , it may or may not be better than a conventional relay in general . for the single user setting ,",
    "since the memoryless nature of the relay does not allow decode and forward processing , it is clear that such a relay channel will have a smaller capacity than a conventional relay in those settings where decode and forward processing is needed , e.g. , when there is no direct path between the source and destination . on the other hand , el gamal and hassanpour @xcite",
    "show that the memoryless instantaneous relay channel can have a higher capacity than a conventional relay .",
    "while the result is surprising , the capacity gains are modest and limited to snr gains . however , as we show in this paper , the use of a memoryless instantaneous relay in a 2 user interference channel has a very significant impact as it increases the dof by at least 50% ( from 1 to 1.5 ) for almost all channel realizations .          practical scenarios that can be modeled by the instantaneous relay setting can arise in a number of ways . here",
    "we outline one motivating example , shown in fig . [",
    "fig : practical ] . consider a two user interference channel where communication takes place over two hops with the use of conventional relays .",
    "there are no direct links between sources and destinations , presumably because of the excessive propagation path loss , that necessitates the use of relay nodes .",
    "it is well known that in such a network , one can completely eliminate all interference to achieve the min - cut bound @xmath2 with @xmath3 or more relay nodes , _ provided we have global channel knowledge and intelligent relay nodes_. however , both global channel knowledge and intelligence at all relays are not easily available in practice . a practical alternative is to choose a subset of relay nodes which are intelligent and let these relay nodes acquire the channel knowledge they need , while the remaining relay nodes remain _ dumb _ , e.g. , by simply amplifying and forwarding their received signals with no knowledge of channel conditions , nor any ability to tailor their transmissions to the channel conditions . such a setting",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : practical ] , where the highlighted relay node in yellow is the intelligent relay that acquires the channel knowledge that it needs .",
    "all other relay nodes ( indicated in white ) remain oblivious of the channel states and simply amplify and forward their signals with a fixed amplification factor that does not depend on channel state .",
    "thus , the channels between sources and destinations that pass through the dumb relays can be represented as an effective channel matrix and equivalently viewed as a direct channel between the sources and destinations .",
    "it is this effective channel that is learnt by the destination nodes , in addition to the channels seen from the intelligent relay node .",
    "these practical assumptions lead us to the model shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : rwd ] , where the dumb relays are not explicitly shown and instead only the effective channel is retained ( shown with dashed lines ) . since all signals arrive at the destinations with equal delay of two hops , and the dumb relays are ignored , we correspondingly shift the time reference at the intelligent relay , so that it is modeled as an instantaneous relay .",
    "the assumption of _ memoryless _ instantaneous relay is not essential to this work , since we focus only on achievable schemes , which will remain achievable even if the relay is allowed to have memory .",
    "rather it is just a feature of our achievable scheme that the relays do not need to use any memory of past received symbols .",
    "finally , we assume that the relays are full - duplex in our channel model fig .",
    "[ fig : rwd ] , which could again be justified as a consequence of an underlying protocol in the practical setting of fig .",
    "[ fig : practical ] whereby the relays transmit and receive in two orthogonal phases .",
    "thus , the channel model of the interference channel with instantaneous relay arises naturally from a two - hop interference channel with several dumb relay nodes and one intelligent relay node .",
    "henceforth , we will use only the channel model illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : rwd ] , i.e. , with the assumptions of instantaneous , full - duplex relays . the justification for these assumptions will not be repeated .",
    "the main contribution of this paper is to show that @xmath0 dof is achievable for the interference channel with the instantaneous relay .",
    "this is remarkable in light of the result that conventional relays do not increase dof beyond 1 .",
    "thus , there is a very significant dof gain from the relay s ability to instantly forward the received signal from the sources to the destinations . also surprising",
    "is that this remarkable dof gain is achievable without any memory at the relay .",
    "the dof gain extends to the setting where every node is equipped with @xmath4 antennas . in this case , @xmath5 dof are achieved the result is also interesting because of the non - trivial nature of the achievable scheme , which is inspired by the idea of _ aligned interference neutralization _",
    "recently introduced by gou et .",
    "al . in @xcite .    for the multiple antenna case , @xmath6",
    ", we construct a linear beamforming scheme to achieve aligned interference neutralization .",
    "the two sources and the relay cooperatively construct beamforming vectors so that the interference signals coming from different paths are eliminated at the unintended destination .",
    "further , we will also describe a simple modification of the beamforming scheme that can achieve snr gain for desired data signals while maintaining @xmath5 dof .",
    "the modified scheme designs the beamforming vectors in such a way that not only are the interference signals coming from different paths eliminated at the unintended destination , but also the desired signals coming from different paths are coherently combined at the desired destinations .",
    "for single antenna case , i.e. , @xmath7 , we translate the proposed linear beamforming scheme into the rational dimensions framework introduced in @xcite and @xcite . using this framework",
    ", we will also show that @xmath0 dof are achieved for the interference channel with the instantaneous relay when the channel coefficient values remain fixed .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , the system model is described and the key concept of proposed scheme is precisely explained using a simple example in section iii . in section",
    "iv we derive the lower bound of dof for the interference channel with the instantaneous relay , assuming all nodes have multiple antennas . using the rational dimension framework",
    ", we also derive the lower bound of dof for a single antenna system in section v. the paper is concluded in section vi with discussions for the role of a relay in the interference channel .",

    "the gain in dof from conventional relays to instantaneous relays is remarkable because it is quite substantial .",

    "if the two signals arrive with the same delay , then as we show here , the dof are improved by at least 50% , but if the direct signals arrive even one symbol ahead of the relayed signal , then we are in the regime of conventional relays and the dof gains disappear entirely .",
    "4 .   consider the setting where all source and destination nodes have only 1 antenna , but the instantaneous relay node is equipped with 2 antennas . in this case , interestingly , 2 dof ( which is also the outer bound ) are easily achieved without any need for alignment at the relay .",
    "the relay is able to resolve the source symbols , which allows the relay to neutralize all the interference from both destinations simultaneously , in a manner similar to the cognitive relay channel studied in @xcite .",
    "as mentioned earlier , it is remarkable that the dof gains with instantaneous relaying are possible with only memoryless relaying , i.e. , the relay needs no memory of past received symbols .",
    "finally , an interesting question that remains open is whether @xmath164 is also the dof outer bound for the interference channel with instantaneous relay , both with and without memory .",
    "other interesting directions would be to study the dof gain with arbitrary number of antennas at each node and with multiple relay nodes .",
    "as explained above , with sufficiently many antennas at the relay nodes , the dof outer bounds corresponding to full cooperation may be achieved with very simple schemes .",
