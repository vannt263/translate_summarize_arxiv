    "in the first part of this work @xcite a collisionless plasma , generated by uv illumination localized in a central part of the plasma , was analyzed .",
    "the ions were assumed to be cold and the fluid description was used . both plane and cylindrical geometries were treated .",
    "an approximate analytical solution was found under the approximation of quasi - neutrality and the exact solution was computed numerically for one value of the debye length @xmath0 for each geometry , this value being much smaller than widths of both illuminated and un - illuminated regions .",
    "it was found that the ions generated in the illuminated region are accelerated up to approximately the bohm speed inside the illuminated region . in plane geometry ,",
    "the ions flow across the un - illuminated region towards the near - wall positive space - charge sheath with a speed which is virtually constant and slightly exceeds the bohm speed . in cylindrical geometry , the ions continue to be accelerated in the un - illuminated region and enter the near - wall space - charge sheath with a speed significantly exceeding the bohm speed . in both geometries , a double layer forms where the illuminated and un - illuminated regions meet .",
    "a very unusual , if not unique , feature that this simple system reveals in plane geometry is the coexistence of two quasi - neutral plasmas of the same size with the ambipolar electric field being confined in one of them ( the illuminated plasma ) , while the other ( the un - illuminated plasma ) is to high accuracy electric field - free and uniform .",
    "the latter is particularly surprising since in all known models a near - wall space - charge sheath is bordered by a nonuniform quasi - neutral presheath where the ions going to the sheath are accelerated and the voltage drop is of the order of the electron temperature measured in volts .",
    "( we set aside cases where the ions are produced on the surface , as in q - machines or experiments with heated cavities @xcite , or inside the sheath , as in near - cathode layers of discharges burning in cathode vapour @xcite . )",
    "moreover , the difference between illuminated and un - illuminated regions in terms of ion momentum is in the presence or absence of ionization friction force , and the fact that the ion fluid is accelerated in the illuminated plasma , where the ionization friction force is present , and is not accelerated in the un - illuminated plasma , where the friction force is absent , is somehow counterintuitive .",
    "the above feature is extremely interesting , also from the methodological point of view ; note that the classical bohm sheath solution @xcite is sufficient to describe both the sheath and the adjacent ( un - illuminated ) plasma in such situation .",
    "a key to this feature is the double layer , which shields the ambipolar electric field induced in the illuminated region and prevents it from penetrating the un - illuminated region .",
    "the quasi - neutral analytical solution @xcite , while clearly being useful , does not describe the double layer , hence a more sophisticated treatment is needed in order to fully understand this feature and the underlying physics .",
    "it is clear that this feature originates in the smallness of @xmath0 , therefore the relevant procedure is to find an asymptotic solution to the considered problem in the limiting case of small @xmath0 .",
    "the technique of choice to this end is the method of matched asymptotic expansions ( e.g. , @xcite ) , which is a standard tool in problems with singular perturbations .",
    "note that this method has been successfully used in the theory of plasma - wall transitions in collisionless plasmas ; e.g. , reviews @xcite .",
    "in particular , relevant in the present context are works @xcite , where a transition layer separating active plasma and a collisionless sheath was introduced ; @xcite , where a more adequate and simpler mathematical description of this layer was suggested ; and @xcite , where the plasma column in electronegative gases was studied including in the exceptional case where the column comprises an inner plasma , a double layer , an outer plasma , and a near - wall sheath .",
    "an approximate analytical solution in the limiting case of small @xmath0 found by means of the method of matched asymptotic expansions is reported in this paper , which is thus complementary to @xcite . also reported are results of numerical calculations for different values of @xmath0 .",
    "questions to be answered include : what is the physics of the double layer ; why the ion speed in the un - illuminated plasma deviates from the bohm speed ; how this deviation can be estimated .",

    "a similar interpretation applies to potential : the potential difference across the illuminated plasma equals @xmath167 and the potential difference across the double layer is @xmath168 .",
    "the double layers in plane and cylindrical geometries are not qualitatively different as far as distributions of the electric field and space - charge densities are concerned .",
    "however , distributions of the ion speed are significantly different : the ion fluid in the double layer is continually accelerated in cylindrical geometry .",
    "this is a consequence of the appearance in the case @xmath7 of an additional term ( @xmath169 ) on the rhs of eq .",

    "this difference may look somewhat surprising : the double layer is asymptotically thin , i.e. , locally planar , so how can its curvature affect its structure ?",

    "the first and second terms on the rhs of eq .",
    "( [ 12a ] ) .",
    "the reason for the latter was discussed in @xcite and applies to the curvature effect as well : the balance of forces acting over the ion fluid is delicate in the vicinity of the sonic point since the main effects ( inertia force and the electrostatic force ) cancel ; therefore , the weak effects ( ionization , curvature , and separation of charges ) also play a role .",
    "one should stress in this connection that eq .",
    "( [ 12a ] ) , describing acceleration of the ion fluid in the double layer , appears in the second approximation rather than in the first one .",
    "in plane geometry , the ions enter the near - wall space - charge sheath with a speed that equals the bohm speed in the first approximation in @xmath105 . in other words , the bohm criterion is satisfied with the equality sign , which is a usual situation , and in the first approximation the near - wall sheath is the usual bohm sheath . in other words , the first term of the asymptotic expansion describing",
    "the sheath in the considered problem is exactly the same as in situations involving an active plasma and a collisionless sheath , for example , in the problem treated in @xcite , or in a situation which would have occurred in the problem considered here if the whole plasma were illuminated .",
    "however , the second terms of the asymptotic expansions describing the sheath in this problem and in usual situations should be different , which is due to the different behavior of the second - order term in the asymptotic zone adjacent to the sheath : in this problem , the second - order term of expansion of @xmath51 in the un - illuminated plasma is constant ( and equal to @xmath170 ) , while in usual situations the second - order term of expansion of @xmath51 in the transition layer has a pole at the wall .",
    "thus , the near - wall space - charge sheath in the plane partially illuminated plasma is the usual bohm sheath to the first approximation in @xmath105 but not to the second approximation . in cylindrical geometry ,",
    "the ions enter the sheath with a speed exceeding the bohm speed . in other words ,",
    "the bohm criterion is `` oversatisfied '' ; a situation which was known to occur only in a few artificial models @xcite .",
    "it has been known for many decades that a ( quasi - neutral ) presheath , in which the ion fluid is accelerated up to the bohm speed , must involve at least one of the following three mechanisms : ion - atom collisions , ionization , and multidimensional effects ; e.g. , @xcite . as far as ion - atom collisions and ionization are concerned , this result is somehow counterintuitive : in terms of ion momentum both ion - atom collisions and ionization represent a friction force , and why should a friction force be needed for acceleration ?",
    "an explanation of this paradox is as follows .",
    "of course , the ion fluid is accelerated by the electrostatic force while a friction force has a decelerating effect ; cf .",
    "( [ 2a ] ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the electrostatic force in a collisionless plane subsonic quasi - neutral plasma with frozen ionization would exceed the ion inertia force and the ion momentum balance can not be ensured ; cf .",
