    "<S> we investigate the extent to which leptonic cp - violation in ( 3 + 2 ) sterile neutrino models leads to different oscillation probabilities for @xmath0 and @xmath1 oscillations at miniboone . </S>",
    "<S> we are using a combined analysis of short - baseline ( sbl ) oscillation results , including the lsnd and null sbl results , to which we impose additional constraints from atmospheric oscillation data . </S>",
    "<S> we obtain the favored regions in miniboone oscillation probability space for both ( 3 + 2 ) cp - conserving and ( 3 + 2 ) cp - violating models . </S>",
    "<S> we further investigate the allowed cp - violation phase values and the miniboone reach for such a cp violation measurement . </S>",
    "<S> the analysis shows that the oscillation probabilities in miniboone neutrino and antineutrino running modes can differ significantly , with the latter possibly being as much as three times larger than the first . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , we also show that all possible values of the single cp - violation phase measurable at short baselines in ( 3 + 2 ) models are allowed within 99% cl by existing data . </S>"
