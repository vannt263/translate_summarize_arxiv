    "it is well established that the bright - rimmed globules found in  regions are often sites of star formation .",
    "reipurth ( 1983 ) first showed that these objects do form stars and subsequent work based on iras data by sugitani et al .",
    "( 1991 ) confirmed that they are indeed active `` stellar factories '' which produce intermediate - mass ( herbig aebe ) stars .",
    "these condensations are local clumps which emerge from the expanding nebula or form from the fragmentation of the dense molecular layer surrounding the ionized gas . the various theoretical works ( bertoldi , 1989 ; bertold & mckee , 1990 ; lefloch & lazareff , 1994 ) and and the numerous observational studies on bright - rimmed globules ( see e.g. cernicharo et al .",
    "1992 ; lefloch & lazareff , 1995 ) have enabled to draw the following evolutionary picture , summarized in fig .  1 .",
    "as a globule of neutral gas is exposed to the ionizing field of the exciting star(s ) of the nebula ( region i in fig .  1 ) , an ionization front ( if ) forms at the surface of the condensation . for standard ionization conditions ,",
    "the pressure of the surface ionized gas is much higher than in the nebular gas and in the molecular globule . as a consequence ,",
    "the photoionized gas expands into the hii region , inducing the formation of a photoionized envelope around the globule .",
    "it is the ionization front and the photoionized envelope which are detected in the optical as a bright rim ( region ii ) .",
    "the incident fuv field drives the formation of a photon - dominated region ( hereafter pdr , region iii ) while a shock front , driven by the surface overpressure , propagates towards the dense molecular core ( region iv ) .",
    "observational evidence of this mechanism , also called radiatively - driven implosion ( or rdi ) , has been reported in a few objects by cernicharo et al .",
    "( 1992 ) and lefloch & lazareff ( 1995 ) .",
    "progressively , a dense core forms behind the surface , and the globule adjusts its internal structure to balance the pressure of the ionized gas , while the bulk of its mass is photoevaporated . eventually , the globule reaches a quasi steady - state , the `` cometary phase '' , in which the shock front has disappeared .",
    "the globule now consists of a small dense `` head '' prolonged by a long tail of diffuse gas .",
    "it has long been suggested that the shock front inside the globule could trigger the star formation inside the bright - rimmed globules ( see e.g. reipurth 1983 ; lefloch et al .",
    "these objects appear therefore as ideal laboratories to test the scenarios of star formation triggered by an external compression wave .",
    "most of the studies led until now were focused onto the molecular core of bright - rimmed globules ( see e.g. lefloch et al .",
    "therefore , the physical conditions reigning in the pdr and in the shocked molecular gas are not well characterized and the impact of photoionization on the gravitational collapse is therefore difficult to evaluate . moreover ,",
    "all the bright - rimmed condensations studied until now are found in relatively old  regions , with ages of a few myr . because the condensations are usually found at rather large distances from the ionizing stars , they experience a reduced uv field and it is difficult to discriminate between a star formation induced by radiatively - driven implosion and a spontaneously evolving globule which has already started to form stars by the time it is hit by the ionization front .",
    "this is why we have started a systematic multiwavelength study of a young hii region  : the trifid nebula .",
    "it appears as a small dusty nebula of @xmath12 diameter at an heliocentric distance of @xmath13 ( lynds et al .",
    "1985 ) , with a dynamical age of @xmath14 .",
    "the nebula is excited by the o star hd  164492a . in a preliminary work ( cernicharo et al .",
    "1998 , cl98 ) , we reported on the mapping of the thermal dust emission of the nebula at millimeter wavelengths .",
    "this mapping revealed the presence of several protostellar cores ( dubbed tc1 to tc4 ) in the shell of dense molecular gas surrounding the  region .",
    "it was not clear however if the birth of the protostars was triggered or not .",
    "for this reason , we undertook a more detailed analysis of the protostellar cores . in a subsequent paper ( lefloch & cernicharo , 2000 ) , we reported on the continuum and molecular line emission around the two most massive protostellar cores  : tc3-tc4 .",
    "their masses are high , between 60 and @xmath15 .",
    "they harbour a class i source and one of the few high - mass class  0 candidates known until now .",
    "comparison of their properties with the models of elmegreen & lada ( 1977 ) and whitworth et al .",
    "( 1994 ) allowed to conclude that the formation of tc4 had probably been triggered in the fragmentation of the dense shell surrounding the ionized gas .",
    "the molecular properties of tc3 and tc4 are similar to those of the protostellar cores discovered in orion , though at an earlier , `` pre - orion '' , evolutionary stage .",
    "we report here on the tc2 , protostellar core , which is associated with a bright - rimmed globule on the southern border of the trifid .",
    "tc2 appears to be in a more advanced stage of photoionization than tc3 - 4  : unlike tc3 - 4 which are still embedded cores , tc2 has already emerged from the diffuse molecular gas layers and it exhibits the optical bright rim and the cometary shape typical of photoionized globules . as discussed in this work",
    ", tc2 is exposed to a rather strong ionizing field , which drives a shock into the condensation , in agreement with the evolutionary scheme presented above . like tc3 and tc4 ,",
    "tc2 displays signs of protostellar activity .",
    "cl98 reported the presence of the herbig - haro jet hh399 coming out of the head of the globule and propagating into the ionized nebula .",
    "it is the best example of globules undergoing at the same time strong photoevaporation and active star formation .",
    "it offers a good opportunity to study the quantify the relation both phenomenons hold to each other , and better constrain the role that radiatively - driven implosion could play in the star formation process . in this purpose , we have led a detailed study of the structure and the physical conditions of the globule ( density , temperature , velocity ) . because tc2 lies almost in the plane of the sky , it provides also a good opportunity to study the structure of a typical low - density photon - dominated region , and to confront its properties against the existing models .",
    "this work provides the first comprehensive study of the whole gas structure of a bright - rimmed globule , from the ionized surface layers to the cold dense molecular core .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "we first derive the structure of the globule  : the hii region ( sect .",
    "3 ) ; the bright rim and the photo - evaporated envelope ( sect .",
    "4 ) ; the pdr ( sect .  5 ) ; the dust continuum emission ( sect .  6 ) and the molecular core ( sect .  7 ) .",
    "we then discuss the observational evidences of radiatively - driven implosion in tc2 and the implications on the past history of the globule ( sect .",
    "8) . in the following section , we first study the star forming conditions in tc2 and attempt to characterize the protostellar source and the outflowing material , before studying the impact of photo - ionization both on the protostar and the evolution of the globule ( sect",
    "the conclusions are presented in sect .",
    "the determination of the physical conditions in the various regions in tc2 requires a compared study of the spectral line and continuum emission mapped at various wavelengths .",
    "the photoionized envelope at the surface of tc2 was characterized from observing the radio free - free emission with the very large array ( vla ) , following the same approach as lefloch et al .",
    "additional constraints on the envelope and the surrounding nebular gas in the trifid were brought by the fine - structure atomic and ionic lines detected in the mid - ir and fir with the infrared space observatory ( iso ; kessler et al .",
    "the conditions in the molecular core were derived from the emission of the cold dust and of various molecular tracers at millimeter wavelengths with the iram 30 m telescope .",
    "the physical conditions in the pdr were determined mainly from the observations of the fir @xmath4}}$ ] lines at @xmath5 and @xmath6 and the @xmath7}}$ ] line at @xmath8 .",
    "the dust properties were derived from the observation of the continuum emission between 5 and @xmath16 with the instruments onboard iso . in all maps presented here the coordinates of all the maps",
    "are given in arcsec offsets with respect to the position of hd  164492a  : @xmath17 @xmath18 , @xmath19 .",
    "the observational data set is summarized in table  1 ; the data described below are shown in figures 2 to 9 and 11 to 16 .",
    "the very large array observations at 3.6  cm were made with the array in its highest angular resolution a configuration in 1998 march 13 .",
    "we used 1328 + 307 as absolute amplitude calibrator and 1748 - 253 as the phase calibrator .",
    "a bootstrapped flux density of 0.271@xmath200.001 jy was obtained for 1748 - 253 .",
    "the observations were made in both circular polarizations with an effective bandwidth of 100 mhz .",
    "the data were edited and calibrated following the standard vla procedures and using the software package aips .",
    "the final map at 3.6 cm was made with the aips task imagr , the robust parameter set to 5 , and a gaussian taper of 100 k@xmath21 to the ( u , v ) data to lower the angular resolution .",
    "the field of view is approximately @xmath22 ; the synthesized beam has a size of @xmath23 ( hpfw ) and makes a position angle ( p.a . ) of @xmath24 .",
    "observations of the 1.25 mm continuum emission in the trifid were carried out in march 1996 and march 1997 at the iram 30m - telescope ( pico veleta , spain ) using the mpifr 19-channel bolometer array .",
    "the resolution of the telescope is @xmath25 .",
    "the final map was obtained by combining several individual fields centered on the brightest condensations of the nebula .",
    "each field was scanned in the horizontal direction by moving the telescope at a speed of @xmath26 per sec ; subsequent scans are displaced by @xmath26 .",
    "we used a chopping secondary at 2hz with a throw of 30 to @xmath27 depending on the structure of the region to be mapped .",
    "calibration was checked against mars .",
    "the weather conditions were good and rather stable during the two observing sessions .",
    "the opacity was monitored every hour on average and we found typical zenith opacities between 0.1 and 0.35 . pointing was checked every hour as the source transits at low elevation at pico veleta and corrections were always found to be lower than @xmath28 .",
    "the final rms is @xmath29  beam .",
    "hence , it is sensitive enough to detect at the @xmath30 level protostellar condensations of @xmath31 at 20  k in one @xmath25 telescope beam ( @xmath32 at the distance of the trifid ) . in order to outline the weak extended dust components in the nebula , we degraded the angular resolution of our map down to @xmath33 ( 0.13  at the distance of the trifid ) by convolving the emission with a gaussian of 11  hpfw .",
    "the resulting rms in the map is @xmath34 .",
    "all the results quoted in this paper are based on the non - degraded map with 0.09  resolution .",
    "we observed in july 1996 and july 1997 the trifid nebula in the millimeter lines of sio , ,   and cs , with the iram 30m - telescope .",
    "the lines were observed with a spatial sampling of @xmath33  : the data are almost nyquist - sampled at 3 mm .",
    "we used an autocorrelator as spectrometer , which provided a velocity resolution of @xmath35 in all three bands .",
    "the rejections of the receivers were always higher than 10db , and checked against w51d ( mauersberger et al .",
    "the trifid was mapped at full sampling in the co @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 @xmath37 and @xmath39 @xmath37 lines with the iram 30 m telescope in july 1996 .",
    "the autocorrelator provided a kinematic resolution of @xmath40 for all the transitions .",
    "additionnal observations of the co   transition were carried out at the cso during various observing runs between 1998 and 1999 .",
    "the receiver was connected to an aos which provided a kinematic resolution of @xmath41 .",
    "all the observed lines , their frequency , the telescope beamwidth and the main - beam efficiencies are summarized in table  2 .",
    "we observed the trifid nebula with isocam ( cesarsky et al .",
    "1996 ) onboard iso .",
    "an image of the whole nebula was obtained using the broad band lw10 filter ( @xmath42 , @xmath43 ) with a pixel size of 3 .",
    "the mid - infrared emission around tc2 was observed in the circular variable filter mode ( cvf ) between 5 and @xmath44 .",
    "the pixel size is @xmath45 and the spectral resolution is 40 .",
    "the @xmath46 pixel detector covered a total field of view of @xmath47 centered on the globule at @xmath17 @xmath48 , @xmath49 .",
    "the size of the point spread function varies between @xmath50 at @xmath51 and @xmath52 at @xmath44 .",
    "the data were reduced with the slice software and following the method of miville - deschenes et al .",
    "( 2000 ) .",
    "the emission between 2 and @xmath53 was observed with the sws spectrometer onboard iso ( de graauw et al . , 1996 ) in the sw01 mode ( @xmath54 grating scan ) the spectral resolution was 300 .",
    "a spectrum was taken right on the head of tc2 ; two additional spectra were taken at a position shifted by + 20  and - 20  in declination , in order to measure the emission towards the bright rim and the hii region and towards the main body of the globule respectively .",
    "the positions are marked in fig .",
    "we note that there is some overlap between the three beams .",
    "in particular the beam centered @xmath55 north of the globule encompasses the northern part of the bright rim .",
    "the sws data consists of an `` up '' scan , towards decreasing wavelengths , and a `` down '' scan towards increasing wavelengths .",
    "the lines identified and their flux ( obtained after averaging the `` up '' and `` down '' scans ) are given in table  3 .",
    "the calibration accuracy varies from @xmath56 at @xmath57 to @xmath58 at @xmath53 ( sws iso handbook , leech et al .",
    "because of the high noise , the statistical errors in the line fluxes are _ a priori _ not negligible in front of the systematic errors in the flux calibration .",
    "therefore , we have compared the emission in the `` up '' and `` down '' scans in order to estimate the actual uncertainty in the line fluxes .",
    "for all the lines detected , _ but the @xmath59}}$ ] line at @xmath60 _ , a very good agreement was found between both measurements . on the contrary , very large variations , up to a factor of 4 , were observed in the flux of the @xmath59}}$ ] line .",
    "the emission between 45 and @xmath16 was observed towards the globule with the lws spectrometer onboard iso ( clegg et al .",
    "the size of the lws beam is known to vary between @xmath61 and @xmath62 hpfw depending on the detector s band .",
    "this effect was taken into account to estimate the line fluxes  : the detector beam sizes were taken from the iso handbook for the lws spectrometer ( gry et al . , 2001 ) .",
    "the large - scale emission of the nebula was estimated by observing a nearby reference position @xmath63 away of tc2 , at position @xmath64 , @xmath65 ( see fig .  2 ) .",
    "the data was reduced using the off the line package ( olp ) version 7 and with the isap package .",
    "the fluxes measured are given following the standard flux calibration , assuming a point - like source .",
    "the uncertainty in the absolute flux calibration quoted for lws is @xmath66 .",
    "however , as discussed in the text , part of the emission in the lws beams arises from the nebular gas , i.e. very extended emission which fills the beam .",
    "therefore , we adopt in this case a somewhat more conservative number of @xmath67 . the identified lines and the fluxes are listed in table  [ flux_lws ] . the spectrum of the globule was obtained after subtracting the emission of the reference position ( off source ) to the emission measured on source .",
    "we proceed first with the analysis of the @xmath68 region as tc2 is embedded in the ionized gas and an estimation of the physical conditions of the ionized bright rim ( see next section ) requires a knowledge of the contribution to the atomic fine structure lines from the hii region .",
    "we show in fig .",
    "6 the various atomic and fine - structure atomic lines detected with the lws and sws spectrometers .",
    "many of the identified lines exhibit weak variations between the on and off positions .",

    "we first consider the reference position .",
    "the lws flux scale is based on a point source calibration . in the case of extended source emission , some correcting factors have to be applied to derive the correct fluxes ( see paragraph 4.9.3 in the iso handbook for the lws spectrometer , gry et al .",
    "2001 ) . since the emission at the reference position comes from the @xmath68 region and fills the whole lws beam ,",

    "is predicted to be close to 1.6 ( see e.g. lester et al .",
    "1987 ) , whereas the measured line ratio is only 0.88 . since both lines trace physically similar regions ( their critical densities are @xmath84 and @xmath85 respectively ) this discrepancy mainly reflects the different relative elemental abundances .",

    "a correcting factor has to be applied to the sws flux obtained with the reduction pipeline in order to derive the correct source flux ( salama 2000 ) .",
    "it is difficult to estimate the interstellar absorption on the line of sight .",
    "since the emission arises from the region close to the _ optical _ bright rim , we believe the interstellar extinction should be rather low and we will neglect the latter in what follows .",
    "we estimate an emissivity ratio @xmath91 for the northern spectrum .",
    "this ratio allows only to set an upper limit on the electron density ( rubin 1989 )  : @xmath92 .",
    "if the contribution of the bright rim were dominant , one would obtain a much larger emissivity ratio , of @xmath93 , as expected for the electron densities obtained with the vla ( @xmath94 ) .",

    "interestingly , this value is typical of an o7.5  iii star , a spectral type proposed by walborn ( 1973 ) for hd  164492a , and not an o7  v star ( the classification proposed by lynds et al .",

    ". moreover , the cvf data benefits a better snr because of the low spectral resolution ( @xmath159 ) . in order to determine the emission from the globule itself ,",
    "we have subtracted the contribution of the  region , estimated from a nearby reference position ( position e , fig .",

    "7 where the contours of the pah @xmath9 band are superposed on the @xmath86}}$ ] emission map .",
    "the emission delineates a thin layer of @xmath160 .",
    "it can be seen that _ there is no @xmath86}}$ ] emission detected over the body of the globule_. a spectrum at position f in the main body of tc2 ( fig .",

    "in particular , the main body of the globule is not photoionized_. some weak @xmath86}}$ ] emission is detected all around the globule , especially in the northerwestern direction , i.e. towards the ionizing stars .",
    "we suggest that it could trace the freely expanding layers of the photoionized envelope around tc2 .",
    "this gas is expected to leave the surface of tc2 with a velocity close to the ionized gas sound speed , @xmath162 ( ll94 ) .",
    "the detection of high gas velocities , from spectroscopic measurements , and the study of their spatial distribution would allow to confirm the association of this component with the photoevaporated envelope of the globule .",

    "it overlaps with the outer part of the @xmath86}}$ ] flux distribution , at the surface of the globule , and in the extended component which possibly traces the photoevaporated envelope .",
    "this is consistent with the high ionization potential of the @xmath59}}$ ] line ( 41  ev ) with respect to to the @xmath86}}$ ] line ( 22  ev ) .",
    "additional lines were detected in the far - infrared with the lws .",
    "the emission from tc2 was estimated by subtracting the emission of the reference position ( see sect .  3 ) to the spectrum towards the globule . in this case , no correcting factor was applied to the fluxes since tc2 fills only half the lws beam ( fig .  4 ) .",
    "we observe a marked increase of the density around the globule . the ratio ( @xmath70}}~52/88)$ ] ratio yields @xmath164 .",
    "a more pronounced increase is observed using the ( @xmath72}}~57/{\\hbox{[o{\\small iii}]}}~52 $ ] ) ratio  : @xmath165 , when adopting an abundance ratio of 0.5 .",
    "one can not exclude that the contribution of the  region along the line of sight of tc2 is somewhat underestimated by the procedure descrived in sect .",
    "3 . on the other hand , an additional factor can account for the observed increase in density  : the photoionized envelope of the globule . as discussed in sect .",
    "4.1 , the latter can be modeled as a layer of effective thickness @xmath166 and density @xmath167 , which expands almost freely around the globule .",
    "the emission of this layer could account for the observed increase in density towards tc2 and for the discrepancy between the density estimates from the ( @xmath70}}~52/88)$ ] and ( @xmath72}}~57/{\\hbox{[o{\\small iii}]}}~52 $ ] ) ratios .",
    "this is because the @xmath70}}$ ] @xmath79 and @xmath72}}$ ] @xmath73 lines are more sensitive to dense material than the @xmath70}}$ ] @xmath100 line ( their critical densities are similar to the ionization front density whereas it is only @xmath168 for @xmath70}}$ ] @xmath100 ) . indeed ,",
    "a simple modelling with two layers of density @xmath169 and @xmath170 , thickness @xmath171 and @xmath172 respectively can account for the emission observed .",
    "the contribution of the dense layer is almost unnoticed at @xmath100 whereas it constitutes @xmath173 of the observed flux for the @xmath174 and @xmath175 lines respectively .",
    "the analysis of the various fine structure atomic lines detected with the sws and the lws spectrometers confirms that the bright - rimmed globule is bathing in the nebular gas of density @xmath176 .",
    "for most of the fine - structure atomic lines , the nebular gas dominates the contribution of the photoionized layer surrounding the globule .",
    "the photoionized gas envelope is detected at the vla ; it is indirectly detected in the @xmath72}}$ ] @xmath73 and @xmath70}}$ ] @xmath175 lines .",
    "the surface density is @xmath177 and rises up to @xmath178 .",
    "the photoionized envelope of tc2 is also detected in the @xmath59}}$ ] and @xmath86}}$ ] lines .",
    "the mapping of these lines shows that the globule is illuminated on the rear side .",
    "in this section we characterize the properties of the pdr  : geometry , hydrogen density and gas column density .",
    "we first study the geometry of the pdr from the emission of the unidentified infrared bands ( uibs ) at 6.2 , 7.7 , 8.6 and @xmath9 as observed with isocam .",
    "the uibs are a good tracer of the strong uv field region associated with a pdr .",
    "although the exact chemical composition of these bands is still not known , the best candidates appear to be the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons , or pahs ( puget & lger 1989 ) .",
    "we will use indistinctly the former or the latter denomination in what follows .",
    "the physical conditions in the pdr are quantified from the emission of dust and of the mid - infrared lines detected with lws and sws  : @xmath156}}$ ]  @xmath179 , @xmath4}}$ ]  @xmath180 , @xmath4}}$ ]  @xmath181 and @xmath182}}$ ]  @xmath183 .",
    "the @xmath4}}$ ] and @xmath7}}$ ] lines are especially interesting tools in the study of pdrs since they can be used to probe the excitation conditions in the gas .",
    "the line fluxes are compared with the recent models of kaufman et al .",
    "( 1999 ; hereafter k99 ) and wolfire , tielens & hollenbach ( 1990 ) .",
    "these models extend the work by tielens & hollenbach ( 1985 ) , hollenbach , takahashi & tielens ( 1991 ) the main difference is that the model of k99 use very recent grain photoelectric heating rates , which include treaments of small grains and large molecules ( pahs ) .",
    "we estimated that such a contribution might be important in the case of tc2 since our cvf data show that the infrared emission shortwards of @xmath184 is dominated by the pahs emission bands .      as can be seen in fig .",
    "8 , the uibs ( or pahs ) bands at 6.2 , 7.7 , 8.6 and 11.3@xmath185 dominates the the spectral emission in the mid - infrared range @xmath186 , as observed with the cvf .",
    "one notes also in the spectra a strong 12.7@xmath187 m line that is a combination of the [ neii ] line and of a pah band , and the presence of a continuum emission at wavelength greater than 13@xmath187 m , also well detected in the sws spectra ( see sect .",
    "6.2 ) , and the presence of the [ neiii ] 15.5 @xmath187 m line . to study the spatial distribution of the various features in the cvf spectra",
    ", we have made a spectral decomposition using a gaussian function for the [ neii ] line , lorentzian lines for the pahs bands ( boulanger et al .",
    "1998 ) and a grey body for the continuum emission .",
    "the resulting maps are shown in fig .",
    "all the uibs are unambiguously detected and have the same spatial distribution , following closely the border of the globule .",
    "we note that there is no spatial segregation between the pahs bands probably as a consequence of the remote distance to the trifid nebula .",
    "the emission is shifted by @xmath188 towards the interior of the globule with respect to the photoionized region , as traced by the @xmath189}}$ ] line ( fig .",
    "the emission shows a local minimum in the center of the globule .",
    "the flux distribution is the brightest in the pdr and reaches its maximum close to the offset position @xmath190 .",
    "the pah emitting region in the pdr is mostly unresolved at all wavelengths ; this prevents any detailed physical analysis of the latter .",
    "the dark filament absorbs a fraction of the infrared radiation coming from the pdr , causing the presence of a local minimum in the brightness distribution . because of the weakness of the radiation field , almost no emission at all is detected over the body of the globule .",
    "only a weak feature is detected around @xmath191 ( fig .",
    "some weak emission is also detected outside the globule , behind the ionization front ( fig .",
    "we now compare the relative variations of the pah bands measured at a few positions over the globule and the @xmath68 region . in order to increase the snr",
    ", the emission has been averaged over four pixels at each position .",
    "the resulting spectra are displayed in fig .",
    "the contribution of the nebula , as estimated from the reference position ( fig .",
    "8e ) has been subtracted to the spectra in order to outline the emission of the globule . the almost flat spectrum obtained in the core tc2 , especially the absence of ionic lines either in absorption or in emission , shows that the nebular gas emission was removed properly .",
    "it is also consistent with tc2 being heated on the rear side .",
    "we concentrate on the 7.7 and 11.3@xmath187 m as they have the highest snr .",
    "the bands have a ratio 7.7/11.3@xmath192 in the pdr .",
    "this ratio is @xmath1931.2 at the reference position ( panel e ) in the  region and it reaches @xmath194 in the direction of the ionizing star .",
    "part of this variation of the 7.7/11.3 ratio is probably related to variations in the charge of the pahs .",
    "the current models and laboratory experiments on the pahs emission show that the relative intensity of the various bands are strongly sensitive to the ionization state .",
    "in particular the intensities of the c - c stretching modes ( 6.2 and @xmath195 ) and the c - h in - plane bending mode ( @xmath196 ) are generally stronger in pah cations than in pah neutrals by a factor of 10 ( see e.g. joblin et al . 1996 ) , whereas the intensity of the c - h out - of - plane bending mode ( @xmath9 ) seems to decrease with the ionization .    in the pdr of the globule",
    ", the models of bakes & tielens ( 1998 ) and dartois & dhendecourt ( 1997 ) predict a very small fraction of pah cations ( 0.01 or less ) . in the photoionized gas around tc2 on the contrary ,",
    "the spectra look very similar to those of a mix of pah cations superposed to a weak continuum ( see fig .",
    "3d in allamandola , hudgins & sandford , 1999 ) .",
    "therefore the decrease of the @xmath9 band can be understood as the dehydrogenation and photoionization of the smallest pahs exposed to the strong uv field of the  region .",
    "a similar effect has been reported in the  region m17 by verstraete et al .",
    "( 1996 ) and crete et al .",
    "( 1999 ) and in ngc  1333 by joblin et al .",
    "( 1996 ) .    however , we observe a marked increase of the 7.7/11.3 ratio , above 2 , inside the globule .",
    "this value is comparable to that observed in the ionized gas , whereas the ionizing field at the surface of the globule , as traced by the @xmath86}}$ ] and the @xmath59}}$ ] lines , is much lower .",
    "hence , the relative variation of the 7.7/11.3 ratio can not be directly accounted for by standard models of pah excitation . as we discuss below , _ the pah emission observed towards the main body of the globule actually comes from the pdr located on the rear side _ and has suffered strong absorption from the globule material ( the millimeter dust map indicates an average @xmath197 over the body of the globule ) .",
    "the absorption by the silicates is so large that hardly any radiation escapes from the globule longwards of @xmath198 .",
    "this effect is illustrated by the cvf spectrum taken at position f , in the main body of tc2 .",
    "almost no emission at all is detected in the spectral window , apart from a weak feature coinciding with the pah band at @xmath199 .",

    "we have calculated the spectrum of the radiation emerging at the front side of the globule , assuming the emitting region ( the pdr ) to be located at the rear surface of the globule .",
    "the extinction through the globule was computed from an empirical absorption profile constructed by cernicharo et al .",
    "( 2000 ) and scaled with the visual extinction inside tc2 .",
    "this empirical profile is based on the cvf spectrum of the class i protostar vla4 in the l1641 molecular cloud in orion .",

    "( 2000 ) , the spectrum of vla4 is very similar to the spectra observed towards deeply embedded objects in massive star - forming regions .",
    "we also note that vla4 and tc2 are in a similar evolutionary stage .",
    "hence , we believe that despite some possible abundance variations between both protostellar cores , the vla4 absorption profile should represent a good approximation to the absorption profile in tc2 .    we have applied this absorption profile to the spectrum of the bright pdr ( position d ) for a visual extinction @xmath197 , a value derived from the 1.3 mm continuum map , and similar to the average extinction over the globule .",

    "the synthetic spectrum of the pdr appears very similar to the spectrum in the body of the globule at position f. the apparent strong enhancement of the @xmath199 band with respect to the @xmath207 band is mainly a selective absorption effect of material located on the rear side of the globule .    to summarize ,",
    "the pah bands at 6.2 , 7.7 , 8.6 and @xmath9 are unambigusouly detected in tc2 .",
    "the variations of their relative intensities are in agreement with the models of pah excitation .",

    "the emission from the globule was obtained by subtracting a reference position to the spectra taken towards tc2 ( see sect .",

    "3.1 , we infer a local density @xmath219 , in good agreement with our measurement at higher angular resolution . after subtracting the contribution of the nebular gas and integrating the emission over the globule , we obtain a mean brightness temperature @xmath220 for the residual emission .",

    "an upper limit of 10 on this ratio yields a hydrogen _ nuclei _ density of @xmath244 .",
    "we determine the electron density in the pdr from the photoelectric heating efficiency @xmath245 , which is governed by the factor @xmath246 ( see e.g. bakes & tielens 1994 ) .",

    "heating amounts to @xmath249 .",

    "the agreement between the fir continuum radiation and the uv photon heating is therefore satisfactory and supports our view that the warm dust layer detected with iso / lws and sws ( see sect .",

    "we try to determine the origin of the emission observed towards the globule .",
    "it is difficult to draw any definite conclusion because of the lack of angular resolution , hence of information about the spatial distribution of the emission .",
    "also , the noise in this band of the sws is known to be high , so that the actual variations between the three positions might be somewhat more pronounced .",
    "an important constraint comes from the measurements of the thermal dust emission at 1.3 mm ; they indicate an average visual extinction @xmath197 across the globule ( see sect .",
    "the values of the interstellar extinction tabulated by mathis ( 1990 ) allow to estimate the opacity of the globule at @xmath255  : @xmath256 .",
    "therefore _ the globule is mainly transparent at this wavelength_.    for the physical conditions encountered in the pdr of tc2 , the model of wolfire , tielens & hollenbach ( 1990 ) predicts a typical value of 0.015 for the ( @xmath156}}$ ]  34.8/@xmath4}}$ ]  63 ) ratio whereas the observed ratio is 0.5 .",

    "this is much less than the flux detected .",

    "the emitted flux is then @xmath263 and @xmath264 for the pdr and the @xmath68 respectively ; the emission of the pdr is somewhat dominated by the contribution of the @xmath68 in the sws beam .",
    "the model of wolfire , tielens & hollenbach ( 1990 ) is then consistent with a gas phase abundance of @xmath265 , i.e. @xmath266 the solar abundance .",

    "reasonable fits can be obtained with the temperature in the range 43 - 48k , and hydrogen column densities of @xmath273 .",
    "the same procedure has been applied to the other positions observed with the sws . at the northern position",
    ", the pdr of the globule fills only partially the sws beam .",
    "we have estimated a size of @xmath274 for the region encompassed by the beam .",
    "the other parameters for the warm layers were left identical otherwise . at the southern position , the continuum emission could be fit with similar parameters and assuming a smaller column density of warm dust ( @xmath275 ) at about the same temperature .",

    "we detect a higher continuum level in the western side of the globule with respect to the northern one .",
    "this difference might result from a higher heating efficiency on the western side because the uv photons arrive almost normal to the surface .",
    "the rise of the continuum could also be related to an increase of the gas density like what was observed in other pdrs ( abergel et al .",

    "2002 ) . within the present understanding of the nature of the mid - infrared emitters ,",
    "it is impossible to determine the origin of the increase of the continuum emission in denser regions but one plausible explanation could be related to a change of the dust size distribution .",
    "there is also a rather good spatial correlation between the 15 @xmath187 m continuum and the distribution of the ionizing gas , as traced by the @xmath86}}$ ] line .",
    "the correlation of this emission with the photoionized envelope suggests that the emission detected probably comes from _ very small grains _ heated by the strong uv field .",

    "we detected some weak emission , at typical fluxes of @xmath281 , which spatially coincides with the region of high obscuration in the optical image , south of the ionization front .",

    "this implies a typical density @xmath295 for the core .      the spectral energy distribution of the globule between 45 and @xmath16 was obtained by subtracting the emission of the reference position to the lws spectrum taken towards tc2 .",
    "the size of the emitting region encompassed by the lws beam is @xmath296 , based on the isocam @xmath297 image and the cold dust millimeter emission ( fig .",

    "the lws also accounts for the mid - infrared continuum emission detected with the sws longwards of @xmath305 .",
    "integrating under the fit of the warm dust component , and correcting for dilution in the lws beam , we obtain the infrared intensity radiated by the warm layer  : @xmath306 . the temperature and the infrared luminosity of the warm layer",

    "this is consistent with the intensity of the far - infrared @xmath4}}$ ] and @xmath7}}$ ] lines as observed with lws ( see above sect .",
    "the whole set of observational data leads us to the conclusion that _ the warm dust component detected with the lws is actually tracing the pdr of the globule_. the average hydrogen column density is @xmath307 . with a typical hydrogen nuclei density @xmath243 , as estimated from the far - infrared line ratios ( sect .",
    "5.3 ) , we estimate the thickness of the pdr @xmath308 .",
    "the cold dust component revealed in the spectral energy distribution is therefore tracing the innermost part of the globule ( the core ) which is protected from the external uv radiation field .",
    "hence , it seems a good reasonable approximation to adopt 22  k as temperature of the dust core traced by the 1.3 mm continuum emission in order to the estimate the mass of the core .",
    "this temperature is similar to those observed in the molecular cloud surrounding the nebula ( lefloch & cernicharo , 2000 ) . a more accurate determination of the mass and column density of the core and the globule would require a better knowledge of the temperature profile .",
    "this is not allowed by the low angular resolution of the lws observations , which averages the emission over a much too large region ( @xmath309 ) .",
    "we define the total mass @xmath310 of the dust condensation by integrating over the flux contour at @xmath311 beam ; this area of mean size @xmath312 contains a total flux @xmath313 . adopting a uniform dust temperature @xmath300",
    ", we obtain the average gas column density over the globule  : @xmath314 , the total mass of the globule @xmath315 , and the average density in the globule @xmath316 .",
    "hence , we find that it is only a small mass fraction of the whole globule ( @xmath317 ) which lies in the atomic surface layers , exposed to the strong fuv field of the stars exciting the trifid .",
    "the ratio of the atomic and molecular gas masses is much lower in tc2 than in the omc  1 in orion and in the galactic center , where it is about @xmath318 . on the contrary",
    ", the ratio takes a very similar value to that in the young massive star - forming region w49n .",
    "this region is one of the youngest massive star - forming place in the galaxy , where several recently born o stars have just started to excavate the parent cloud ( vastel et al .",
    "the low atomic to molecular gas ratio measured in tc2 is therefore consistent with a very early evolutionary age for the globule .",
    "this point is more thoroughly addressed in sect .",
    "the molecular content of the bright - rimmed globule was first observed in the co lines .",
    "the line profiles are complex and exhibit several components between -50 and @xmath319 that correspond to various physical regions in the molecular cloud containing the hii region ( lefloch et al .",
    "because of the large extent of the co emission in the nebula , antenna temperatures are a better approximation than main - beam brightness temperatures to the brightness of the co lines .",
    "we adopted the same approximation for the @xmath38 @xmath37 transition . on the contrary",
    ", we assumed main - beam brightness temperatures for @xmath39 .",
    "the spatial distribution of the kinetic components shows that the emission of tc2 peaks at @xmath320 ( fig .",
    "the distribution of the emission follows closely the bright rim and drops abruptly beyond the ionization front .",
    "the antenna temperatures of the co transitions are rather uniform over the globule , with values of @xmath321 k for the  and  transitions and 15 k for @xmath322 one .",
    "we have tried to constrain the temperature and density distribution in the globule by modelling with a radiative transfer code the excitation of the co lines .",
    "a priori two zones are contributing to the emission  : the molecular core and the pdr .",
    "the large ratio between the  and the  lines is very difficult to explain .",
    "observations of the high - density gas show that the velocity shift between the quiescent core and the surface layers , which are accelerated by radiatively - driven implosion , is small , of the order of @xmath323 ( see sect .",
    "this is consistent with the symmetric profiles observed for all the molecular transitions ( fig .",
    "this velocity shift is small enough that the pdr and the dense core are still radiatively well coupled .",
    "therefore , most of the radiation coming from the pdr on the rear side of the globule is absorbed by the dense core .",
    "as a consequence , its contribution to the  and  lines is almost negligible and we detect mainly the emission of the cold core and the front side layers .",
    "we infer a kinetic temperature of about 30 - 35 k for the gas , somewhat higher than the dust temperature",

    "the picture coming out of the molecular line and thermal dust continuum analysis is that the globule consists of a cold central core of density @xmath355 surrounded by an envelope slightly warmer in the outer layers , at a temperature @xmath356 , and density of about @xmath357 .",
    "we have recalled briefly in the introduction the overall evolution of a photoionized globule .",
    "the time evolution of a photoionized globule , the density and the velocity fields , were studied numerically and presented in ll94 ( see in particular their fig .",

    "this factor is directly related to the overpressure exerted by the ionized gas , and the intensity of the shock driven in the condensation .",

    ", ll94 showed that the morphology , the density and velocity structure of a photoionized globule mainly depend on the duration of the ionization , i.e. the time elapsed since the illumination began .",

    "we find a kinetic pressure @xmath369 .",

    "therefore , the inner pressure can not sustain the globule against the overpressure of the ionized material .",
    "ll94 showed that in the course of its evolution , the pressure of the ionized gas increases as the radius of the globule decreases ( sect .",
    "5.1 in ll94 ) . in other words ,",
    "the overpressure at the surface of the globule was less in the past .",
    "figure  15 shows the emission of the dense molecular gas in the @xmath336 and cs  @xmath36 lines along a cut in declination across the border of the globule .",

    "the weakness of the line at these declinations is due to the small beam filling factor as the major fraction of the beam solid angle points towards the ionized gas in the  region .",

    "third , there is no evidence for an additional , redshifted , component which would trace the other wing of the molecular outflow .",
    "on the contrary , the profile of this secondary kinematic component is much more suggestive of a shock propagating into the globule from the _ rear _ side .",
    "the detection of this secondary kinematic component at the border of the globule , well separated from the main body gas emission , is typical of a globule in the early collapse phase and testifies that a shock is propagating into the globule from the surface .",

    "the simulation was done for ionization parameters similar to tc2  : @xmath377 and @xmath378 ( @xmath379 and @xmath380 are the initial values of the parameters @xmath363 and @xmath365 ) .",
    "it is therefore possible to relate the properties of the _ observed _ globule to the simulated cloud via the simple scaling ( ll94 )  : @xmath381 , @xmath382 , @xmath383 .",
    "as mentioned above , tc2 is undergoing the collapse phase , when a shock front propagates into the neutral gas .",
    "based on a morphological comparison with the simulated globule ( figure  4 in ll94 ) , we find the best match for an age comprised between @xmath384 and @xmath385 in the computation . at @xmath386 ( fig .",
    "4b ) , a dense core has formed below the surface of the globule , which still exhibits a `` barnacle '' shape .",
    "later on , at @xmath385 , ( fig .  4c ) , the bulk of the material has collapsed onto the main axis .",
    "the globule has now adopted an elongated shape .",
    "the best morphological match is obtained for an intermediate time @xmath387 .",
    "the numerical modelling indicates that the amplitude of the secondary kinematic component at such early photoionization stages is typically @xmath388 ( see their fig .",
    "this velocity shift could be smaller depending on the inclination angle of the globule surface with respect to the line of sight .",
    "the @xmath372 difference observed in tc2 between both kinematic components is therefore fully compatible with the numerical results .    at that stage ,",
    "the simulated globule has lost about @xmath389 of its initial mass ( see fig .  8 in ll94 ) . applying this result to tc2 ,",
    "it means that the initial mass of the globule was @xmath390 .",
    "since the initial mass of the _ simulated _ globule is @xmath391 , we can derive the scaling factor relating the properties of the observed globule to the model  : @xmath392 .",
    "the radius of the _ scaled _ ( simulated ) globule is then @xmath393  cm whereas we measured @xmath394  cm .",
    "we note however that the density is assumed to be uniform in the simulated globule , whereas a core - envelope density structure , as in tc2 , would lead to a smaller radius for the same ionization conditions .",
    "the duration of the photoionization , scaled from the simulations , is @xmath395 .",
    "this compares very well with the kinematical age of the trifid , as measured from the luminosity of the exciting star and the expansion of the nebula ( lefloch & cernicharo , 2000 ) .",
    "it is therefore very likely that the globule was very early exposed to the ionizing radiation , as soon as the o star turned on .",
    "the first evidences of ongoing star formation in tc2 were presented by cl98 , based on a @xmath396}}$ ] image of the hh399 jet running out of the bright rim of tc2 .",
    "the jet has been studied in the optical by rosado et al .",
    "( 1999 ) and cl98 .",
    "these observations revealed the fragmented structure of the jet and could identify several `` knots '' from the head to the base of the jet , a - g , a being the most remote knot ( see fig .",
    "our vla observations detect only the external part of the hh  399 jet .",
    "we could detect three `` clumps '' which coincide with the knots dubbed a , c and d by rosado et al .",
    "the clumps are unresolved in the transverse direction by our observations .",
    "the flux peaks are rather similar ( between 70 and @xmath397 ) .",
    "we take @xmath398 ( @xmath399 ) as an upper limit to the diameter of the jet , and adopting a temperature between 5000 and @xmath400 we derive average electronic densities of @xmath401 in the clumps .",
    "our estimate is in agreement with rosado et al .",
    "( 1999 ) for knot  a. there are larger discrepancies for knots c and d , which the authors estimate to have densities of @xmath402 and @xmath403 respectively",
    ". this could be due to clumpiness in the jet structure .",
    "this can be also explained by our assumption on the geometry of the jet , apart from the uncertainties in the 3.6 cm flux ( the noise is @xmath404 ) .",
    "for instance , assuming a jet diameter ten times less would yield an electron density of @xmath405 , closer to the estimates derived at optical wavelengths .",
    "as soon as the jet runs out of the pdr , it is exposed to the ionizing radiation of the exciting star . integrating over the contour at @xmath142",
    ", we obtain a total flux @xmath406 for the jet , and an average emissivity @xmath407 .",
    "the recombination rate per surface unit of the jet is @xmath408 .",
    "this is only half the ionizing flux impinging on the globule , as estimated in sect .",
    "3.1 . hence , there are enough ly - c photons to maintain the jet fully ionized once it propagates out of the globule .",
    "hh399 is one of the finest examples of photoionized jets reported so far ( see also reipurth et al .",
    "1998 ) .",
    "we searched for some molecular outflow emission which would be the counterpart to the optical jet but did not find any evidence of such a phenomenon .",
    "this is probably because of the unfavourable orientation of the jet , very close to the plane of the sky ( rosado et al .",
    "1999 estimate an inclination lower than @xmath409 ) .",
    "we also searched for sio emission as it is a tracer of young protostellar outflows , associated with class 0 and/or massive sources ( bachiller , 1996 ; lefloch et al .",
    "again , this search yielded only negative results .",
    "this suggests that the powering source has probably reached the class  i stage , characterized by a less active accretion phase than the class 0 , and has a typical evolutionary age of a few @xmath10 .",
    "if this age is correct , it means that star formation began approximatly at the time when the ionizing star hd  164492a turned on and ignited the nebula .",
    "the observation of the molecular outflow emission and the overlap between the wings usually provides a good determination of the position of the driving source . since this method",
    "can not be applied here , in the absence of molecular outflow , the only indications on the source location are provided by the vla observations .",
    "we have detected two small components inside the molecular core of tc2 ( fig .",
    "remarkably , they are both aligned with the jet propagation axis .",
    "both components are unresolved and are only marginally detected with fluxes of 50 and @xmath410 respectively at a level of @xmath30 and @xmath411 respectively .",
    "it is not clear whether these components trace some material associated with the counterjet or some material in the protostellar environment of the driving source itself .",
    "however , since they are located close to the millimeter dust emission peak we favor the latter hypothesis . in the mid - infrared ,",
    "as observed with isocam in the broad band filters , there is no evidence of point - source emission in the globule .",
    "this indicates that the powering source of hh399 is a much less luminous and massive object than the protostar detected in southwestern molecular cloud ( lefloch & cernicharo 2000 ) .",
    "a close inspection of the continuum emission between 13 and @xmath412 in the globule however reveals a local maximum of compact , unresolved , emission at @xmath413 , @xmath414 .",
    "this source is spatially separated from the pdr , though close to it ( @xmath415 ) .",
    "it coincides with the vla sources to better than @xmath416 , actually falling between them .",
    "altogether , these observations give strong support for a physical association between the vla component(s ) and the driving source of hh399 jet .",
    "the bolometric luminosity of the protostellar source is difficult to estimate since the pdr contributes to the luminosity of the globule too .",
    "we estimate the protostellar luminosity by taking into account only the cold dust component estimated from the fit of the sed  : @xmath417 .",
    "an upper limit is obtained by integrating under the spectral energy distribution  : @xmath418 .",
    "this value is typical of intermediate - mass protostars but we stress again that the actual luminosity could be lower .",
    "the radiation field has a deep impact on the herbig - haro jet as soon as it escapes the globule .",
    "however , it is less clear how much the star forming process itself is perturbed . in the present stage ,",
    "the size of the pdr represents approximately one third of the globule s radius .",
    "it is the low - density envelope , i.e. the mass reservoir , which is affected by the fuv field , and not the dense core where the material is being accreted .",
    "an important paramater in the evolution of the globule is its mass - loss rate , which is determined by the ionizing flux and the radius of the globule ( see ll94 )  :    @xmath419    for tc2 , we estimate a present mass - loss rate of @xmath420 . from comparison with numerical simulations",
    ", we found that the globule lost about @xmath391 since the ionization began .",
    "the globule has evaporated half the mass of its envelope until now and its expected lifetime is therefore @xmath421 .",
    "this is a lower estimate as the mass - loss rate increases with radius . on the other hand the active accretion phase",
    "is known to last a few @xmath10 ( andr et al .",
    "therefore , the life expectancy of the globule is long enough to allow the protostellar objects to complete smoothly the accretion phase and turn into stars before the globule wholly evaporates .",
    "tc2 is going to develop progressively a low density tail , turning into a so - called cometary globule .",
    "we speculate that within a few @xmath10 the situation should be very similar to the gas fingers observed in the eagle nebula ( white et al .",
    "1999 ) , where the strong uv field is evaporating the ultimate dust and gas layers of the stellar nests , unveiling the star(s ) formed in the early stages of the nebula .",
    "we have carried out a multiwavelength study of bright - rimmed globule tc2 in the trifid nebula .",
    "the globule lies almost in the plane of the sky , immersed in the low - density gas of the @xmath68 region ( @xmath422 ) .",
    "it is illuminated by the o star hd  164492a , mainly on the rear side .",
    "the globule consists of a very dense core of cold gas and dust ( t= 22  k , @xmath423 ) , of small dimensions surrounded by a lower - density envelope ( @xmath424 ) .",
    "its mass ( @xmath425 ) is typical of bright - rimmed globules , equally distributed between the core and the envelope ( 27 and @xmath426 respectively ) .",
    "the ionization conditions at the surface of the globule were determined from vla and iso ( lws and sws ) observations .",
    "the impinging ionizing flux is @xmath427 ; it creates an ionization front and a photoevaporated envelope of density @xmath428 at the surface of the globule .",
    "the pdr is traced by the emission of the pahs bands at 6.2 , 7.7 , 8.6 and @xmath9 .",
    "the observed variations of the relative intensities can be accounted for by the change in the excitation conditions .",
    "we find that the intensity of the @xmath9 band drops outside of the pdr in the photoionized layers , as a consequence of the ionization of the pahs .",
    "the @xmath195 band is still detected in the photoionized envelope of the globule , though at a weaker level . despite the high visual extinction of the globule ,",
    "the @xmath195 pah band , excited in the pdr on the rear side is detected in the body of the globule thanks to a minimum in the absorption of the ices and the dust in this wavelength range .",
    "millimeter line observations reveal the kinematical signature of the pdr which precedes the ionization front as a shock moving into the globule .",
    "the relative projected velocity is weak , @xmath429 .",
    "comparison with models of photoionized globules ( ll94 ) indicates that tc2 has been exposed to the ionizing radiation for @xmath430 , almost as soon as the exciting star of the nebula turned on .",
    "the structure of the photon - dominated layer has been derived from the iso far - infrared line and continuum observations .",
    "the agreement between all the data and the model of k99 is good .",
    "the intensity of the radiation field at the surface is @xmath3 .",
    "the pdr has a typical column density of @xmath431 and a molecular hydrogen density @xmath432 .",
    "the fuv field heats the dust to a temperature @xmath433 whereas the average gas temperature is found close to @xmath239 .",
    "the emission of the @xmath156}}$ ]  @xmath157 line in the pdr can be accounted for by assuming a silicon gas phase abundance of @xmath265 , i.e. @xmath434 the solar value .",
    "the globule is currently undergoing star formation .",
    "our observations show that the globule is forming a low- or intermediate - mass star of luminosity @xmath435 .",
    "the protostar powers a herbig - haro jet , which appears fully ionized outside of the globule .",
    "no molecular counterpart ( outflow ) to the optical jet has been found . in particular , no sio emission was found .",
    "this implies that the source is already in an intermediate stage between class 0 and class i , or even a full class i member .",
    "the evolutionary age of the source is therefore typically a few @xmath10 , which suggests that star formation in tc2 probably started in the large burst which accompanied the birth of hd  164492a . as a result of the photoevaporation of the surface layers ,",
    "the globule has evacuated about half the mass in its envelope until now but we have not found any evidence that the birth process itself has been perturbed . on the contrary , the photoevaporation rate is low enough to leave ample time for protostars to reach safely the ultimate stages of star formation .",

    "<S> we have carried out a comprehensive multiwavelength study of bright - rimmed globule tc2 in the trifid nebula , using the iram  30 m telescope , the vla centimeter array and the infrared space observatory ( iso ) . </S>",
    "<S> tc2 is one of the very few globules to exhibit signs of active ongoing star formation while being photoevaporated by the ly - c flux of the exciting star of the nebula ( @xmath0 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the globule consists of a cold dense core of mass @xmath1 surrounded by a lower density envelope of molecular gas . </S>",
    "<S> the impinging ly - c photons induce the propagation of an ionization front into the globule . the evaporation of the ionized gas forms a thin layer of density @xmath2 around the globule , which could be mapped with the vla . </S>",
    "<S> the globule is illuminated mainly on its rear side , by a fuv field of intensity @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> it creates a photon - dominated region ( pdr ) below the surface , which was mapped and characterized with the isocam circular variable filter and the short wavelength spectrometer ( sws ) onboard the infrared space observatory . </S>",
    "<S> the physical conditions derived from the analysis of the far - infrared lines @xmath4}}$ ]  @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7}}$ ]  @xmath8 , and the continuum emission are in good agreement with some recent pdr models . </S>",
    "<S> the emission of the pahs band at 6.2 , 7.7 , 8.6 and @xmath9 is detected over the whole globule . </S>",
    "<S> the relative intensity variations observed across the globule , in the pdr and the photoionized envelope , are consistent with the changes in the ionization fraction . in the head of tc2 </S>",
    "<S> , we find a second kinematic component which is the signature of the radiatively - driven collapse undergone by the globule . </S>",
    "<S> this component indicates that the pdr propagates at low velocity inside the body of tc2 . </S>",
    "<S> the molecular emission suggests that the star formation process was probably initiated a few @xmath10 ago , in the large burst which led to the formation of the nebula . </S>",
    "<S> the globule has already evaporated half the mass of its envelope . </S>",
    "<S> however , the ionization timescale of the globule is long enough ( @xmath11 ) to let the newly born object(s ) reach smoothly the ultimate stages of protostellar evolution . </S>",
    "<S> the impact of photoionization on the star formation process appears limited . </S>"
