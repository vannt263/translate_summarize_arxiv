    "in this paper we consider curves determined by equations of the form @xmath1 where @xmath2 , @xmath3 is a product of open intervals . equations such as are often referred to as implicit equations since in general there does not exist an explicit , unique function @xmath4 such that @xmath5 .",
    "a canonical example is that of the unit circle , with @xmath6 , which can not be rearranged to isolate @xmath7 as a function of @xmath8 .",
    "the following discussion also applies to equations of the form @xmath9 where @xmath10 is a bifurcation parameter .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to address the problem of plotting solution curves to with turning points ( a precise definition will be presented shortly ) .",
    "while a method for dealing with this problem has already been developed by keller @xcite ( via a pseudo - arc - length parametrization ) , it relies on the turning points to be anything but cusps , and thus can not be used on curves without some understanding of their profile .",
    "conversely , the algorithm that we will present not only requires no prior knowledge of the solution curve , but also approaches the problem in what we consider to be a more intuitive manner .",
    "it should be said , however , that although we acknowledge that there are other methods to deal with this problem , we will make no attempt to compare them .",
    "essentially , this paper is to be self - contained , and therefore our only concern is the explanation of our proposed algorithm , and its own benefits , not its relative benefits .",
    "before a discussion of the algorithm may begin , we must first define the term _ turning point_.    let @xmath11 , and @xmath12 .",
    "a point @xmath13 is a _ turning point _ of @xmath14 if @xmath15 , and there exists @xmath16 such that at least one of the following statements is true :    1 .",
    "2 .   @xmath18 .",
    "3 .   @xmath19 .",
    "4 .   @xmath20 .",
    "definition 1 may be envisioned in the following way : if one were to restrict themselves to a small enough neighborhood about @xmath21 , one of the open  half - balls \" centered at @xmath21 contained in this neighborhood would have no intersection with @xmath22 ( see figure [ fig : tps ] ) .",
    "the remainder of this paper will deal with the discrete set : @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the approximation of @xmath22 , and @xmath25 is the discrete approximation @xmath26 .",
    "for a detailed discussion of approximating turning points in discrete spaces see the review by cliffe , spence , and tavener@xcite .",
    "supposing that @xmath27 has been identified as a turning point of any type , let @xmath28 be the closed disk of radius @xmath29 centered at @xmath30 .",
    "the algorithm is then performed in the following steps :    1 .",
    "uniformly scan the boundary of @xmath28 , @xmath31 , for solutions to @xmath32 .",
    "denote the set of solutions as @xmath33 .",
    "2 .   1 .",
    "if @xmath34 , we may stop here : no other points in @xmath35 satisfy @xmath32 .",
    "2 .   if @xmath36 , select @xmath37 , @xmath38 , to be a `` reference point '' and select the minimal point @xmath39 such that @xmath40 for all @xmath41 , where @xmath42 3 .   1 .   create the vector @xmath43 , 2 .",
    "determine the largest axial component of @xmath44 , @xmath45 .",
    "3 .   use @xmath46 to determine the new direction of iteration .    to clear up any possible ambiguity",
    ", we will elaborate on how one might implement the above strategy on a type 1 turning point .",
    "[ [ step-1 ] ] step 1 + + + + + +    since @xmath30 is a type 1 turning point , we know that there exists an open ball of radius @xmath47 centered at @xmath30 whose eastern hemisphere is disjoint from @xmath24 . therefore ,",
    "if any solution to the equation @xmath32 exists , it must exist in the western hemisphere .",
    "hence , we describe @xmath48 , our reduced search path , by @xmath49 which is easily seen to be parametrized by @xmath50\\ ] ] thus , if @xmath51 points are used to uniformly sample @xmath48 , the mesh would look like @xmath52 for @xmath53 .",
    "the points @xmath54 are then checked to see if @xmath55 .",
    "if @xmath54 is solution to @xmath32 , it should be recorded in the set @xmath33 .",
    "it should be noted that the method employed to check whether @xmath54 is a solution to @xmath32 is irrelevant .",
    "[ [ step-2 ] ] step 2 + + + + + +    we have found that it is best to pick an @xmath56 that is contained in @xmath28 . in this way ,",
    "when we minimize the cost function @xmath57 , see , we are searching for the the point in @xmath33 which is furthest from our the reference point .",
    "if we assume @xmath30 is not the final point of @xmath24 , then the furthest point from the reference point is not expected to be any of the previous points in @xmath24 . picking a reference point that is `` too far '' from @xmath30 can potentially lead to choosing @xmath58 such that @xmath59 is a previous solution .",
    "when the algorithm is implemented inside an iterated plotting program ( one would do this for autonomous plotting ) , this has the consequence of leading the plotting program to retrace its old steps .",
    "from here it is only a matter of evaluating @xmath60 for all @xmath41 , and finding the smallest value .",
    "the coordinate which minimizes @xmath57 shall be called @xmath61 .",
    "while there is no garentee that there exists a single coordinate , such that @xmath57 is minimized uniquely ; in practice , we seldom arrive at two , or more points , that equally minimize @xmath57 .",
    "[ [ step-3 ] ] step 3 + + + + + +    make the direction vector , @xmath44 , from @xmath30 to @xmath59 .",
    "then identify which component of @xmath44 is larger in magnitude .",
    "if the @xmath7-component is larger , begin iterating along the @xmath7-axis ( the direction is determined by the sign of the @xmath7-component ) .",
    "iteration should thence begin at @xmath59 .",
    "this is to compensate for the fact that it may happen that the turning point was approached via iteration along the positive @xmath8-direction , yet the algorithm has concluded that the new direction is along the negative @xmath8-direction .",
    "if we do not begin at @xmath59 , the program will just back - track along already found points of @xmath24 .",
    "it should be noted that while the algorithm has been presented in the two - dimensional case , it is easily generalized to apply to equations on @xmath62 .",
    "for instance , if we were to consider the case @xmath63 , then a simple modification of definition 1 including half - spheres , instead of half - balls , would allow for this algorithm to work with space curves .",
    "to demonstrate the effectiveness of the turning point algorithm , we chose to implement it on the astroid , a well known implicit equation given by @xmath64 .",
    "the resulting curve can be found in figure [ fig : astroid ] .",
    "the accuracy of the curve generated with our algorithm was measured in percent error , and depended on several different parameters : @xmath29 , the radius of @xmath48 , @xmath65 how many `` steps '' back the reference point was from the turning point , and @xmath51 the grid size of @xmath48 .",
    "each parameter was varied until notable values were found .",
    "@xmath66    it was found that a radius @xmath67 $ ] ( where @xmath47 is the magnitude of the step - size @xmath68 or @xmath69 ) , @xmath70 and @xmath71 yielded a maximum percent error @xmath72 .",
    "however , for @xmath73 the algorithm failed to correctly navigate the turning point , and the plot ceased to continue .",
    "consider the problem of determining the thickness of a thin film of lubricant inside a rotating cylinder .",
    "using the lubrication approximation to the navier - stokes equations developed in @xcite , one may describe the steady - state thickness , @xmath74 , by @xmath75 where @xmath76 is the non - dimensional flux and @xmath77 is dependent on the surface tension and rate of rotation . coupling with @xmath78",
    "it is not unreasonable to ask how the curve of points satisfying and behaves for a particular @xmath77 .",
    "because this curve may be characterized by a solution set to some equation @xmath79 , we will let @xmath80 denote the curve .",
    "since our intention is to demonstrate the robustness of the algorithm , and not the challenge behind solving @xmath79 when either @xmath76 or @xmath81 is fixed , we refer the curious reader to the works of ashmore _",
    "_ @xcite and benilov _ et  al . _",
    "@xcite for detailed exposition of that task .",
    "briefly , we discretized @xmath82 on a uniform grid , and use fourier spectral differentiation matrices which account for the @xmath83-periodicity of @xmath82 .",
    "a matlab program was written to accept very small values of @xmath77 and perform an iterated newton - raphson procedure to generate @xmath84 given a particular parameter and direction .",
    "once a turning point was identified , the algorithm was performed .",
    "it was found that for @xmath85 complicated loop behavior similar to that exhibited in figure [ fig : fluid ] appeared . with the algorithm deployed to automate plotting ,",
    "each successive turning point was over come with no difficulty .",
    "interested readers may also refer to @xcite for recent literature on this topic , as well as @xcite .",
    "-bifurcation diagram generated for @xmath86 . modified from @xcite.,height=264 ]",
    "due to the various settings in which the algorithm may be applied , a general run - time analysis is impossible .",
    "instead , we will analyze the case when @xmath26 is not explicitly given , but inferred from differential or integral equations .",
    "in particular , we will perform a run - time analysis on the lubrication model example . as demonstrated in section 5 , it is clear that these settings are very useful in the study of certain ordinary and partial differential equations .    in this particular instance , we had two particular equations and which allowed us to solve for @xmath76 and @xmath81 given a function @xmath87 \\to { \\mathbb{r}}^{+}$ ] . by approximating @xmath82 with @xmath88 ( an @xmath89 column vector ) , and taking the appropriate taylor expansion of elements of , we were able to perform parameter continuation along the @xmath81-axis with a @xmath90 matrix approximation of the operator @xmath26 .    with similar linearization techniques we were able to perform parameter continuation along the @xmath76-axis with a @xmath91 matrix approximation of @xmath26 .",
    "( for more details about these techniques see benilov @xcite . )    in this setting , performing the newton - raphson method prescribed by ashmore @xcite and/or benilov @xcite , and thus completing step 1 in the algorithm , is bottle - necked by the speed of matrix multiplication .",
    "now , an algorithm for matrix multiplication of @xmath90 matrices has been found with run - time @xmath92 ( i.e. the coppersmith - winograd algorithm@xcite ) .",
    "however , this algorithm is particularly hard to implement , and is usually used for theoretic bounds above all else .",
    "thus , in the spirit of creating a practical run - time argument , we assume that strassen s algorithm is used , and therefore the calculations in step 1 can be carried out in @xmath93 @xcite . also , because newton s method is usually performed in a for - loop for a fixed number of iterations , @xmath94 say , step 1 may be preformed in @xmath95 , where @xmath51 is the number of sample points on @xmath96 .",
    "now , because calculating @xmath57 is reasonably assumed to take constant time , it is clear that the most cumbersome part of step 2 is determining the point which minimizes @xmath57 ( which is a sorting problem ) .",
    "thus , if we assume @xmath33 has @xmath51 points in it ( the maximal amount ) , then step 2 may be performed in @xmath97 .",
    "this follows from the fact that @xcite shows that that any comparison sort algorithm requires @xmath98 in the worst case .",
    "hence , taking any version of heap or merge - sort to perform step 2 will require @xmath97 .",
    "while there are a myriad of ways one may perform step 3 , any competent implementation should run in constant time since this step has only manipulates two points in @xmath35 .",
    "hence , the algorithm can be found to run in @xmath99 .",
    "however , as we saw in the astroid example , @xmath51 need not exceed 10 , or so , points . thus , if we approximate @xmath82 with any reasonable amount of resolution ( i.e. @xmath100 or @xmath101 ) , then @xmath102 , and we may consider it something of a constant .",
    "hence , the algorithm can be expected to run in @xmath93 .",
    "it is easy to see that turning points make automated plotting a challenge , if not impossible . to overcome this issue",
    "we have outlined an algorithm that determines the direction iteration should continue in after reaching a turning point .",
    "as demonstrated with the astroid and thin - film differential equation examples , the algorithm overcomes turning points accurately , and effectively , while asking little in terms of computational power .",
    "it should be said that implicit functions and dynamical systems far from exhaust the areas where this algorithm may be helpful . with the amount of research",
    "being done today throughout the various sciences ( pure and applied alike ) , it is clear that this algorithm can be applied anywhere data visualization is possible .    *",
