    "the repulsive hubbard model is one of the main models describing strong electron correlations in crystals . for its investigation",
    "a number of methods is used , discussion of which can be found , in particular , in reviews .",
    "this paper is devoted to the development of one of such methods  the strong coupling diagram technique . as follows from its name ,",
    "the method is aimed at the limit of strong hubbard repulsion @xmath1 , when it is comparable or larger than the width of the initial electron band @xmath0 . however , due to peculiarities of the method it gives the correct result also in the limit @xmath2 thereby providing an interpolation between the two limits . in calculating green s functions",
    "the method uses the serial expansion in powers of hopping constants .",
    "the elements of the arising diagram technique are site cumulants of different orders , connected by hopping lines . as in the diagram technique with the expansion in powers of an interaction , in the present approach",
    "the linked - cluster theorem allows one to discard disconnected diagrams and to carry out partial summations in connected diagrams . as a result",
    "the one - particle green s function is expressed in the form of the larkin equation through the initial electron dispersion and the sum of all irreducible diagrams  the diagrams , which can not be divided into two disconnected parts by cutting some hopping line . for more details",
    "see refs .  .",
    "a somewhat different diagram technique , which is also based on the serial expansion in powers of hopping constants , was developed in refs .  .",
    "in this paper we consider one - site contributions of the first two orders to the mentioned sum of irreducible diagrams . due to the restriction to one - site diagrams",
    "the considered approximation resembles the dynamic mean field approximation.@xcite with the insertion of the first- and second - order diagrams into internal hopping lines , the used approximation gives an equation for self - consistent determination of the electron green s function .",
    "it is shown that the solution of this equation retains causality .",
    "calculations were carried out for a semi - elliptical initial band .",
    "the approximation is able to describe the mott transition , which takes place at @xmath3 .",
    "this value coincides with that found in the hubbard - iii approximation.@xcite however , in contrast to this latter approximation the obtained density of states ( dos ) reduces to the initial semi - elliptical dos in the limit @xmath2 .",
    "no quasiparticle peak , inherent in the dynamic mean field approximation , is observed in our calculations at the mott transition . at small deviations from half - filling the dos shifts along the frequency axis without perceptible change in its shape . for larger deviations",
    "the dos is redistributed in favor of the subband , in which the fermi level is located , and for @xmath4 the mott gap disappears .",
    "possible ways of the inclusion of spin and charge fluctuations into the theory are briefly discussed .",
    "we shall consider the repulsive hubbard model on a two - dimensional ( 2d ) square lattice .",
    "the model is described by the hamiltonian @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the hopping constants , the operator @xmath7 creates an electron on the site * n * of the 2d lattice with the spin projection @xmath8 and the electron number operator @xmath9 . in this work",
    "we shall calculate the electron green s function @xmath10 where the angular brackets denote the statistical averaging with the hamiltonian @xmath11 , @xmath12 is the chemical potential , @xmath13 is the time - ordering operator which arranges operators from right to left in ascending order of times @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "green s function ( [ green ] ) does not depend on the spin projection , and it was omitted in the function notation .    in the strong coupling diagram technique green s function ( [ green ] )",
    "is presented as the serial expansion in powers of the kinetic term in the hamiltonian , and the role of the unperturbed hamiltonian is played by the repulsion term of eq .",
    "( [ hamiltonian ] ) together with the term containing the chemical potential , @xmath17 terms of the series are constructed from the hopping constants @xmath6 and cumulants of the operators @xmath18 and @xmath19 belonging to the same site .",
    "the cumulants are calculated with the site hamiltonian @xmath20 , eq .",
    "( [ unperturbed ] ) .",
    "the sum of all terms of the series can be written in the form of the larkin equation @xmath21 where the fourier transformation over the space and time variables was performed , @xmath22 is the 2d wave vector , @xmath23 is the matsubara frequency with the temperature @xmath24 , @xmath25t_{\\bf nn'}$ ] and @xmath26 is the sum of all irreducible diagrams , which is termed the irreducible part of the larkin equation .",
    "terms of lowest orders in this sum are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] together with their signs and prefactors .",
    "here circles denote cumulants , which orders equal to numbers of incoming or outgoing directed lines .",
    "two outer arrows designate the operators @xmath27 and @xmath18 of green s function ( [ green ] ) in cumulants .",
    "the discussed diagram technique allows a partial summation .",
    "therefore , it is presumed that irreducible diagrams of all orders and in all possible combinations are inserted in the internal hopping lines ",

    "[ fig1 ] . as a result , in the diagrams",
    ", the bare hopping @xmath28 is substituted by the renormalized one @xmath29 the sign of a term in the irreducible part @xmath26 is equal to @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the number of loops formed by hopping lines .",
    "prefactors in the diagrams arise due to the fact that some permutations of the kinetic energy hamiltonians in a power expansion term lead to the same diagram , since creation and annihilation operators of these permuted hamiltonians enter into the same cumulant .",
    "the first - order cumulant coincides with the one - particle site green s function .",
    "a cumulant of an order @xmath32 is equal to the @xmath33-particle site green s function and a sum of all possible products of lower - order cumulants , the summarized orders of which is equal to @xmath33 . the sign , with which a term appears in this sum , is equal to @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is the number of permutations performed to obtain the order of operators in the term from that in the @xmath33-th cumulant . in other words ,",
    "the signs of the terms containing products of first - order cumulants are opposite to signs of the same terms , which would arise from the @xmath33-particle green s function in the @xmath33-th cumulant if wick s theorem@xcite could be applicable to it . as a result in the limit @xmath2 all cumulants of orders",
