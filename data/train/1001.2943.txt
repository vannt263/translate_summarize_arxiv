    "during the past twenty years , the dynamical mean field theory ( dmft ) @xcite has been quickly developed into a powerful method to solve the strongly correlated models on the lattice ( for a review see @xcite ) .",
    "dmft maps the lattice models to the corresponding quantum impurity models subject to the self - consistency conditions . unlike the normal static mean field approaches , dmft keeps the full local dynamics induced by the local interactions .",
    "dmft has been successfully applied to various correlation problems , such as the mott transition in the hubbard model @xcite and the heavy fermion systems@xcite .    in dmft one",
    "encounters the problem of how to efficiently solve the quantum impurity problems with self - consistently determined bath .",
    "the impurity solver can be regarded as the _ engine _ of dmft , which influences the efficiency and accuracy of dmft calculations . since the invention of dmft , many impurity solvers have been developed . with the development of the modern computers ,",
    "the essentially exact numerical methods have received much attentions . among them",
    "the most used methods include the exact diagonalization ( ed ) @xcite , hirsch - fye quantum monte carlo ( hfqmc ) @xcite and the numerical renormalization group ( nrg ) @xcite .",
    "most recently the continuous - time quantum monte carlo ( ctqmc ) solver @xcite has been introduced .",
    "these methods can be divided into two classes .",
    "ed and nrg @xcite approaches are based on the hamiltonains , while the qmc solvers are based on the lagrangians ( action ) . generally the lagrangian approach is favored since the dmft theories itself is derived in the lagrangian representation , and thus in the self - consistent process there is no need to map the continuous hybridization function to the discrete hamiltonians . however the hamiltonian approaches have the merit that they work well at low temperatures and for real frequency which is more relevant to the experimental quantities , since most of the novel quantum phenomena in condensed matter physics happen at very low temperature . by the term of `` impurity solver '' , one means not only to compute the ground state but also the whole spectral functions , which include the lower energy quasi - particle parts as well as the higher energy hubbard bands in general .",
    "nrg approach could resolve exponentially small scales at the expense of the accuracy at intermediate and high energies .    the extensions of dmft also call for the development of impurity solvers . in recent years",
    ", lda+dmft has been developed very quickly and successfully applied to many systems @xcite , see @xcite and @xcite for the reviews of the recent developments and applications . since in the real materials",
    "there are usually more than one orbitals involved , therefore one needs to solve the quantum impurity problems with multi - orbitals efficiently .",
    "a second direction of the development is to study not the impurities but small clusters embedded in bath to capture the spatial fluctuations@xcite .",
    "therefor one needs an efficient method to calculate the spectral properties of smaller clusters .",
    "the requirement of solving complex impurity problems ( multi - orbital or cluster ) puts hurdles on the ed and nrg approaches .",
    "a third direction of extension of the dmft is to deal with the non - equilibrium systems @xcite , which do not have the translational symmetry in the time domain .",
    "it requires the solver being able to work in the time domain , while to our knowledge most of the solvers work in the frequency ( imaginary or real ) domain .",
    "a recent attempt is made in the ctqmc approach @xcite . while this approach can handle arbitrary interaction strengths , it suffers from a dynamical sign problem which becomes severe at long time or for large bandwidth .",
    "therefore it is urgent to develop an impurity solver working at zero temperature , which satisfies the following criteria .",
    "i ) it can capture both the low energy quasi - particle physics and the high energy hubbard bands .",
    "ii ) it is easy to be generalized to multi - orbital or cluster cases .",
    "iii ) it works with real frequency and gives the real time dynamical properties directly .    in this paper",
    ", we develop an impurity solver satisfying all these criteria based on the time - dependent variational matrix product states ( tvmps ) approach . the variational approach",
    "directly attacks the strongly correlated problems by an educated guess of the many body wavefuncitions . by introducing more variational parameters one could enlarge the dimensions of the variational space but it makes the variation process harder in general .",
    "for example , in the case of gutzwiller variational wave function , the evaluation of the expectation value is often done approximately by introducing the gutzwiller approximation @xcite .",
    "matrix product states ( mps ) are states where the coefficients of the wave function are a product of matrices depending on the local lattice site states .",
    "they are generated naturally from the nrg and dmrg calculations .",
    "actually the latter approach can be reformulated into the variational approach within the space spanned by the mps @xcite .",
    "time evolution algorithm @xcite based on mps was first proposed from the quantum information perspective , and then been translated into the language more access to the many - body theorists @xcite , see @xcite and @xcite for reviews of the time evolution algorithm of the mps .",
    "there are some previous attempts using the vmps approach to study the quantum impurity problems .",
    "@xcite studied the spectral property of siam in the presence of a magnetic field using the correction vector approach , which is first proposed in the context of dynamical density matrix renormalization group ( ddmrg ) @xcite .",
    "@xcite performed detailed comparison of the vmps and the nrg approach on the siam .",
    "@xcite used the vmps formalism to study the two - lead , multi - level anderson impurity model . along the line of developing fast impurity solvers ,",
    "several of the authors have developed the gutzwiller based impurity solver @xcite , which is suited for combining with the lda and studying the low temperature properties of multi - orbital models .",
    "there were previous attempt of using the dmrg as the impurity solver of the dmft .",
    "@xcite    the organization of this paper is as follows . in sec .",

    "[ sec : dmft ] we address the dmft self - consistent loop where a fitting procedure from the continuous hybridization function to the siam chain hamiltonian is needed .",

    "one first prepares the states , @xmath117 where the first ( second ) @xmath118 denotes the state of the @xmath17-th physical ( ancillary ) site . by the purification process one gets @xmath119 , from which one could get the finite temperature density operator @xmath120 and the partition function @xmath121 .",
    "the finite temperature correlation function can be evaluated as @xmath122 .",
    "so once one gets @xmath123 , one could apply the evolution algorithm similar to the sec.[sec : evolution ] to compute the green s function in the imaginary as well as real times .    the imaginary time green s function @xmath66 with @xmath124 to @xmath107",
    "is computed from the evolution algorithm . for the particle - hole symmetrical case ,",
    "one only needs half of the data ( @xmath125 ) due to the symmetric property @xmath126 . for general cases ,",
    "we evolute @xmath66 from @xmath127 to @xmath128 and then use @xmath129 to restore the imaginary time green s function from @xmath127 to @xmath107 .",
    "this approach reduces the computational efforts and also the accumulated errors in the long time evolution .",
    "( the ending point is conserved since in the present approach it is equal to @xmath130 ) to compute the green s function at low but finite temperatures , one needs to perform long time evolution , which is not stable due to the accumulation of the trotter error and the truncation of the hilbert space .",
    "the error is more severe in the finite temperature case , because of the presence of the exponent growth factor @xmath131 .",
    "this hinders the investigation of very low temperatures but can be circumvented by choosing alternative evolution algorithms @xcite .",
    "these possibilities demands further investigating .",
    "see fig [ fig : comp_qmc ] for a comparison of the finite - t green s function for a siam chain from the tvmps and the hf - qmc approach .",
    "there is an alternative way which does not group the physical and the ancillary sites into the supersite .",
    "this way reduces the size of the local hilbert space , but the non next - nearest interaction will hinder the simple trotter decomposition based time evolution algorithm .",
    "after all , the time evolution can be done by the lanczos dynamic or the time step targeting which does not assume the next - nearest interactions .",
