    "in spite of the dynamical evidence that a lot of dark matter is concealed in galactic halos , observations failed for many years to provide any information about its nature . a breakthrough came recently with the discovery of massive astrophysical compact halo objects ( machos ) in microlensing experiments towards the large magellanic cloud ( alcock et al .",
    "@xcite ; aubourg et al .",
    "@xcite ) . today , although the existence of machos  presumably located in the halo of our galaxy  appears to be firmly established , the implications of such an achievement are still largely unsettled , owing to their sensitive dependence on the assumed galactic model ( gates , gyuk & turner @xcite ) . more specifically , the existing data - set permits to reliably conclude that machos should lie in the mass range @xmath5 , but stronger claims are unwarranted because the inferred macho mass strongly depends on the uncertain properties of the considered galactic model ( evans @xcite , de paolis , ingrosso & jetzer @xcite ) .    even if present uncertainties do not yet permit to make any sharp statement about the nature of machos , brown dwarfs look as a viable possibility to date , and we shall stick to it throughout",
    ".    remarkably enough , a simple scenario has been proposed ( de paolis et al .",
    "@xcite ; gerhard & silk @xcite ; nulsen and fabian @xcite ) which  besides encompassing the fall - rees theory for the formation of globular clusters ( fall & rees @xcite )  predicts that dark clusters of brown dwarfs and cold molecular clouds ( mainly of @xmath6 ) should form in the halo at galactocentric distances larger than 1020 kpc .",
    "dark clusters in the mass range @xmath7 are expected to have survived all disruptive effects and should still populate the outer galactic halo today ( de paolis et al .",
    "@xcite ) .    in this paper",
    "we would like to discuss further aspects of the above scenario , which naturally arise provided machos have coronal x - ray emission .",
    "indeed , x - ray observations of field stars have shown that low - mass stars  with mass even as low as @xmath8  do have coronal x - ray emission .",
    "thus  given that machos are old , very low - mass stars  we expect them to be x - ray active .",
    "actually , under this assumption , kashyap et al .",
    "@xcite have explored the possibility that an _ unclustered _ macho population in the galactic halo can contribute significantly ( at levels @xmath9 ) to the diffuse x - ray background ( xrb ) at higher ( @xmath10 kev ) energies . as we shall see in sect .",
    "4 , such an unclustered distribution looks however unplausible .",
    "apart from automatically avoiding this difficulty , the scenario under consideration has two further implications as far as x - ray emission is concerned .",
    "first , the gas present in the dcs partially shields the x - ray emission from machos , thereby reducing the total contribution to the xrb ( as compared with the expectation of kashyap et al .",
    "@xcite ) . second  besides contributing to the diffuse xrb ",
    "dcs can also show up as discrete sources in analyses of very deep field x - ray satellite observations towards regions in the sky of very low column density .",
    "in fact , the existence of a new population of not yet fully recognized x - ray sources has been suggested by an analysis of very deep rosat observations ( towards the _ lockman hole _ ) , which revealed a considerable excess of faint x - ray sources over that expected by active galactic nuclei ( agn ) evolution models ( hasinger et al .",
    "a re - analysis of the same data shows that most of the sources in excess may be identified with clusters of galaxies and narrow emission or absorption line galaxies ( hasinger @xcite ) .",
    "recently , data analyses of rosat observations in a different region of the sky ( mchardy et al .",
    "@xcite ) have confirmed the previous conclusions by hasinger @xcite and make even more clear that below a flux level of @xmath11 erg @xmath12 s@xmath2 there exists a population of unidentified , faint point - like x - ray sources ( about 10 - 20% of the total ) .",
    "still , an open problem is whether the unidentified sources are galactic or extragalactic in origin .",
    "our main point is that a galactic population of dcs can significantly contribute to the inferred new population in question .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows . in section 2",
    "we discuss the questions concerning the dcs x - ray emission , while the observational implications of the scenario under consideration are addressed in section 3 .",
    "limits on the amount of the virialized x - ray emitting diffuse gas in the galactic halo are derived in section 4 .",
    "our conclusions are summarized in section 5 .",
    "as is well known , low - mass stars have coronal x - ray emission due to the presence of collisionally excited plasma in their convective envelopes .",
    "observations have shown that the coronal gas temperature @xmath13 lies in the range @xmath14 k ( schmitt et al .",
    "@xcite ) . as regard to the corresponding x - ray luminosity",
    ", measurements performed by einstein and rosat satellites yield the average value @xmath15 erg s@xmath2 for late m - stars ( barbera et al .",
    "@xcite , fleming et al .",
    "@xcite ) . moreover ,",
    "neither any obvious correlation between @xmath16 and bolometric luminosities for k and m - stars has been found ( mullan and fleming @xcite ) , nor a dependence of @xmath16 on the metallicity has been detected ( kashyap et al .",
    "@xcite ) . now ,",
    "brown dwarfs are very low - mass stars which share several features in many spectral bands with late m - stars .",
    "so , it seems plausible to expect machos to have coronal x - ray emission as well .",
    "erg s@xmath2 . ]",
    "more specifically , we assume that machos have an average x - ray luminosity @xmath17 erg s@xmath2 in the @xmath18 kev energy band .",
    "our attitude is further supported by the direct observation of at least one object , the vb 8 dwarf ( of mass @xmath19 ) , by einstein , exosat and rosat satellites between 1979 and 1994 , whose measured x - ray luminosity is @xmath20 erg @xmath21 , @xmath22 erg @xmath21 and @xmath23 erg @xmath21 in the energy bands @xmath24 kev , @xmath25 kev and @xmath26 kev , respectively ( drake et al .",
    "@xcite ) .    let us focus our attention on the coronal plasma emissivity @xmath27 , where @xmath28 denotes the gas metallicity , @xmath29 and @xmath30 are the ion and electron number density , respectively ( we shall use cgs units throughout the paper ) .",
    "following raymond and smith @xcite , this quantity is obtained by adding the continuum energy emissivity ( by free - free and free - bound processes ) to the emission - line contribution by metals ( through bound - bound processes ) .",
    "we may confidently suppose that the primordial halo gas from which machos have formed has a metallicity @xmath31 ( from now on - with the exception of section 4 - this value will be implicitly assumed throughout and the z - dependence in the ensuing expressions will be dropped ) .",
    "hence , the x - ray spectral luminosity @xmath32 of a single macho is obtained by integrating @xmath33 over the coronal volume @xmath34 .",
    "however , in the present instance , we do not need to know @xmath34 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 due to the obvious requirement that integration of @xmath32 over the frequency range @xmath35 is equal to the total x - ray macho luminosity @xmath36 . in this way",
    ", we find @xmath37    next , we compute the x - ray luminosity @xmath38 of a dc in the frequency range @xmath39 taking the x - rays absorption by molecular clouds within the dc into account ( absorption by the galactic disk is momentarily disregarded ) . to this end , it is convenient to consider first the x - ray luminosity @xmath40 in the frequency range @xmath41 from a unit element of the dc projected surface ",
    "perpendicular to the line of sight  at impact parameter @xmath42 .",
    "we denote by @xmath43 the coordinate along the line of sight ( with origin on the perpendicular plane through the centre of the dc ) , and by @xmath44 and @xmath45 the number density of machos and gas , respectively , in a dc .",
    "in addition , @xmath46 stands for the x - ray absorption cross - section whereas @xmath47 denotes the ( median ) radius of a dc .",
    "it follows that the optical depth inside a dc is @xmath48 moreover , a straightforward calculation yields @xmath49 because of the spherical symmetry , we ultimately get @xmath50    what are @xmath44 and @xmath45 ?",
    "although the gas distribution is expected to be clumpy , for simplicity we can safely adopt a uniform average distribution , so that @xmath45 is constant . as discussed elsewhere ( de paolis et al .",
    "@xcite ) , in the lack of any observational information about dcs it seems natural to take their average mass density equal to that of globular clusters . then the following relationship ensues @xmath51",
    "( @xmath52 is the mass of a dc ) . on account of it , @xmath45 becomes independent of @xmath52 and @xmath47 , and its explicit value is @xmath53 @xmath54 .",
    "the case of @xmath44 is less trivial , since the results we are going to derive can depend strongly on how machos are distributed inside dcs .",
    "below , we consider the two extreme situations : ( @xmath55 ) all machos are uniformly distributed in the dcs ; ( @xmath42 ) all machos are concentrated in the dc cores .",
    "realistically , we expect an intermediate situation to occur , since the mass stratification instability drives the more massive machos into the cluster cores .",
    "in addition , dcs with mass in the range @xmath56 should have started core collapse ( de paolis et al .",
    "@xcite ) , in which case situation ( @xmath42 ) becomes an excellent approximation .",
    "let us proceed to address the two cases separately . in case ( @xmath55 )",
    ", @xmath40 can be computed analytically to give @xmath57 by inserting expression ( [ 4 ] ) into equation ( [ abs ] ) we obtain @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the fraction of dc matter in the form of machos , @xmath60 and we have introduced the attenuation factor @xmath61 d\\nu   \\label{8}\\ ] ] which yields the fraction of x - rays emerging from a dc . case ( @xmath42 ) can be handled in a similar fashion with eq .",
    "( 7 ) replaced by @xmath62    what about @xmath63 ?",
    "it is well known that for x - rays incoming on gas with interstellar composition @xmath64 @xmath12 with @xmath65 in kev ( morrison and mccammon @xcite ) . on the other hand , in the limiting case of @xmath66",
    "it turns out that @xmath67 @xmath12 ( see fig . 1 in morrison and mccammon @xcite ) .",
    "since we are dealing with the case @xmath68 , we shall use for @xmath63 in eq .",
    "( [ 4 ] ) the linear interpolation between the above expressions .",
    "we report in table 1 the values of @xmath69 for various energy bands and different values of the macho coronal gas temperature @xmath13 in both cases ( @xmath55 ) and ( @xmath42 ) . as we can see , the fraction of x - rays surviving the absorption by molecular clouds in dcs ranges from @xmath70 to @xmath71 .",
    "the attenuation function @xmath72 - see eqs .",
    "( [ 8])-([9 ] ) - is displayed for selected values of the macho coronal temperature @xmath13 in different energy bands ( the first and second ones are the rosat medium and high - energy bands while the third refers to the epic instrument on the planned satellite xmm ) .",
    "we consider two cases : ( @xmath55 ) machos uniformly distributed in the dcs and ( @xmath42 ) machos concentrated in the dc cores .",
    "for the latter case , we give in the last column the x - ray flux @xmath73 - see eq.([12 ] ) - reaching the earth , assuming , as an illustration , @xmath74 , @xmath75 kpc , @xmath76 and @xmath77 erg s@xmath2 .",
    "we have verified that in the low rosat energy band 0.15 - 0.28 kev the x - ray absorption is so efficient that we can not hope to detect any radiation coming from a dc . [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "the possibility that machos with mass @xmath78 possess , in analogy with low - mass stars , coronal x - ray emission has several observational consequences . indeed , according to the considered model for the halo dark matter",
    ", the large number of machos inside each dc gives rise to a total x - ray luminosity @xmath79 as high as @xmath80 erg s@xmath2 , in spite of the strong absorption brought about by molecular clouds .",
    "the main parameter discriminating between different values of @xmath79 is @xmath52 ( see fig .",
    "1 ) , which lies in the broad range @xmath81 . at the lower end of this range , namely for @xmath82",
    ", dcs can contribute to the xrb at a level of at most 5% .",
    "of course , the latter value depends on the assumed total amount of halo dark matter , the coronal macho temperature and the considered energy range .",
    "for @xmath83 we get a different observational situation . in this case",
    ", fluctuation analyses of the xrb should yield @xmath84 dcs per square degree with x - ray flux in the range @xmath85 erg @xmath12 s@xmath2 .",
    "this conclusion supports the idea that dcs contribute to the new population of faint x - ray sources advocated by hasinger et al .",
    "@xcite and mchardy et al .",
    "@xcite . finally ,",
    "if @xmath86 , some dcs should be observable as resolved sources with the future planned satellite missions .",
    "the best strategy would then be to look in the direction of a previously microlensed star towards the lmc .",
    "we have also derived an upper limit on the amount of virialized diffuse halo gas by using rosat data .",
    "even if dependent on the gas virial temperature ( and thus on the total dynamical mass of the galaxy ) and on the metallicity , this limit shows that the amount of diffuse gas in the galactic halo is less than 5% .",
    "this result corroborates our assumption that the primordial gas left over from macho formation should remain within the dcs ( in the form of cold molecular clouds ) , for otherwise it would be heated by the gravitational field thereby emitting in the x - ray band .",
