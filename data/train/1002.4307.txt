    "one of the most actual tasks in the theory of nonlinear dynamical systems is a setting of chaotic regime generation conditions and defining possibilities of chaos control @xcite .",
    "it is well known , that in physical applications for a transition from chaotic to periodic mode in multicomponent systems different mechanisms are used .",
    "for example , in laser physics they are negative feedback @xcite , angle between two crystals which are entered to the fabry - perot cavity @xcite , full feedback intensity @xcite , intensity of activating @xcite ( see @xcite and citations therein ) . in this connection , from the theoretical point of view , an actual task is to establish of chaos control and to determine transition characters between chaotic and regular dynamics .",
    "the main goal of this work is to study an influence of two additional nonlinearityes that arise up in the chaotic system as a result of different physical processes onto transitions character between regular and chaotic dynamics .",
    "we shall consider a modified lorenz - haken model which self - consistently can describes , for example , optical bistable systems @xcite , systems of defects in solids @xcite , etc . due to condition of commensurability for all three modes relaxation times",
    "we shall set domains of system parameters of chaos realization with a help of maximal lyapunov exponents approach .",
    "we shall obtain two different strange chaotic attractors and set possible transitions to chaotic dynamics .",
    "the paper is organized in the following manner . in section 2",
    "we present a model of our system incorporating a nonlinear dissipation external perturbation terms .",
    "section 3 is devoted to the consideration of conditions for transition to chaotic regime and to determination the main characteristics of strange chaotic attractor .",
    "the main results and prospects for the future are presented in the conclusions .",
    "a lorenz - haken model can be written in a form @xcite : @xmath0 here a point means a derivative in time @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3  relaxation times of an order parameter @xmath4 , a conjugating field @xmath5 and a control parameter @xmath6 , accordingly ; @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9  positive feed - back constants ; @xmath10  pump intensity , measures the influence of environment .",
    "first elements in the left hand of the systems ( [ lor ] ) take into account dissipation effects , peculiar to the synergetic systems .",
    "connection between the order parameter and conjugating field is linear ( first equation ) , in that time as an evolution of the conjugating field @xmath5 , and control parameter @xmath6 sets due to nonlinear feed - backs relations ( second and third equations , respectively ) .",
    "principally that positive feed - backs which are provided by constant @xmath7 and @xmath8 result in an increase in conjugating field .",
    "these positive feed - backs are compensated by negative one due to principle of le - shatele . as a result one has decreasing in control parameter ( see third equation in eq.([lor ] ) ) .",
    "let us start the analysis of the system ( [ lor ] ) with passing to dimensionless variables .",
    "such transition is arrived due to measuring of time @xmath11 , order parameter @xmath12 , conjugating field @xmath13 , and control parameter @xmath14 in the followings units : @xmath15 in this time , dropping indexes , the system ( [ lor ] ) becomes a form @xmath16 where @xmath17 , @xmath18 .",
    "the system ( [ lor2eqqq ] ) is written in supposition of linear dependence for order parameter relaxation time as @xmath19 .",
    "however , most real physical systems are characterized by the nonlinear relaxation processes . in this connection let us suppose that the order parameter relaxation time @xmath1 increasing with increase in order parameter @xmath12 due to relation @xcite : @xmath20 where @xmath21  positive constant which play a role of an dissipation intensity . from eq.([f_k ] ) it is seen that relaxation time @xmath22 is independent of order parameter sign . except for that ,",
    "relation ( [ f_k ] ) has practical application namely , it designs the action of optical filter , entered into the fabry - perot cavity of optically bistable system ( for example solid - state laser ) .",
    "such acting provides establishment of the stable periodic radiation ( or time dissipative structure realization ) @xcite . using a dependence ( [ f_k ] ) , first equation of ( [ lor2eqqq ] ) is generalized by an additional nonlinear term @xmath23 .",
    "if one consider system in external field , then one need to take into consideration external perturbations . in this article",
    "we shall model such perturbations by the external potential @xmath24 . due to the standard catastrophe theory such potential",
    "is given by three types of catastrophes @xcite .",
    "in general case one has @xmath25 where @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30  parameters of the theory . for a catastrophe @xmath31 one",
    "has @xmath32 , for a catastrophe @xmath33 : @xmath34 and for a catastrophe @xmath35 : @xmath36 .",
    "the modified lorenz - haken system has the form @xmath37 where we suppose @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "variation in parameters of @xmath40 and @xmath41 can to induce changing of the attractor topology in phase space .",
    "the system eq.([lor2eq ] ) with nonlinear dependence of order parameter relaxation time versus order parameter in a form ( [ f_k ] ) ( @xmath42 ) but with absence of additional perturbations ( @xmath43 ) was considered in @xcite .",
    "it was shown that in such a case the semirestricted domain of system parameters ( pump intensity @xmath10 and dissipation intensity @xmath21 ) for dissipative structure realization is formed .",
    "it was set that in a case of linear dependence for order parameter relaxation time versus its values ( @xmath44 ) chaotic regime is not realize .",
    "in addition , it was found the chaos domain , and it was determined conditions of chaos control . finally it was defined fractal and statistical properties of corresponding chaotic strange attractor .    the main goal in this work is to study an influence of external perturbation , on a regimes of transition to chaos in lorenz - haken system , generalized by nonlinear relaxation time of order parameter in a form ( [ f_k ] ) . for external perturbations we shall use a potential of the fold catastrophe @xmath31 , i.e. @xmath45 . to indicate a chaotic dynamic we shall use a method of lyapunov exponents which is provided by a benettin algorithm @xcite . due to this algorithm",
    "each of lyaponov exponent ( number is defined by dimension of corresponding phase space ) determines a speed of convergence / divergence of any two initially nearby trajectories in a fixed direction in corresponding phase space , starting from points @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "the divergence / convergence of such trajectories is given by the dependence @xmath48 , where @xmath49 is a maximal ( global ) lyapunov exponent , which is defined due to relation @xcite @xmath50 here one takes into account an upper limit and @xmath51 is a norm ; @xmath52 ; @xmath53  full time .",
    "one can conclude that in a case @xmath54 , @xmath55 , and accordingly @xmath56 all of phase trajectories will coincide to fixed point ( stable node or stable focus ) . at @xmath54 , @xmath57 and @xmath58",
    ", @xmath59 @xmath60 phase trajectories will lie down on a stable limit circle ( dissipative structure ) . if @xmath54 , @xmath61 and @xmath62 , @xmath59 @xmath60 a dynamics of the system is chaotic .",
    "a lyapunov map of the modified lorenz - haken system ( [ lor2eq ] ) at @xmath63 and @xmath64 is shown in fig.[fig1 ] .    ) at @xmath63 and @xmath64,width=377 ]    here by gradation of grey color the value of maximal ( global ) lyapunov exponent is shown versus pump intensity @xmath10 and parameter of an external potential @xmath28 .",
    "white color determines the domains of stable system behaviour ( phase space is characterized by a fixed point ",
    "stable node or a stable focus ) .",
    "grey color marks the domains of time dissipative structure existence ( more dark domains correspond to the larger number of oscillation periods ) . domains of chaos are shown by a black colour . from fig.[fig1 ] it is seen , that in a case of nonlinear term @xmath65 absence in the external potential @xmath24 the existence of the chaotic mode requires large values of pump intensity . in case @xmath66 ) with @xmath67 and @xmath64 in detail .",

    "it is necessary to note that dark curves ( between _ a _ and _ b _ , _ b _ and _ c _ in a lyapunov map ) in the domain of dissipation structure existence ( grey area ) are determine the parameters values of doubling period bifurcation .",
    "below the map there is a dependence of maximal lyapunov exponent versus pump intensity @xmath10 at @xmath64 , @xmath68 and @xmath63 .",
    "a presence of two pronounced peaks in the domain of zero values of maximal lyapunov exponent ( fluctuations around zero are connected with an error of numeral solution of systems ( [ lor2eq ] ) ) determines points of doubling period bifurcation .",
    "corresponding phase portraits illustrating dissipative structures with one , @xmath70 and @xmath71 periods are shown with the help of insertions _ a ) _ , _ b ) _ and _ c ) _ , accordingly .",
    "it is principally , that as transition from _ a ) _ to _ b ) _ , as transition from _ b ) _ to _ c ) _ characterizes by appearance of a few additional harmonics . as it is seen from dependence @xmath72 in a point _",
    "maximal lyapunov exponent has positive value and phase space characterizes by the irregular behaviour of trajectory .",
    "increasing in pump intensity leads to dissipative structure formation with one period ( cf .",
    "phase portraits _ d ) _ and _ e ) _ ) .",
    "next increasing in @xmath10 leads to positive values of @xmath49 and phase space characterizes by chaos existence ( corresponding phase portrait is shown with the help of insertion _",
    "f)_. so , one can conclude that at @xmath64 , @xmath68 and @xmath63 with an increase in pump intensity @xmath10 a transition to chaotic regime occurs due to ruelle - takens scenario , when only negligible number of doubling period bifurcations leads to chaos @xcite . with a decreasing in @xmath10 ( from @xmath73 to @xmath74 )",
    "maximal lyapunov exponent takes positive value at @xmath75 in spontaneous manner .",
    "corresponding transition to chaos takes a place through intermittency @xcite .",
    "next , let us consider the domain of chaos , shown in fig.[fig1 ] at @xmath76 .",
    "lyapunov map at @xmath64 and @xmath69 is shown in fig.[fig3 ] .",
    "below the map as well as in previous case a dependence of maximal lyapunov exponent versus pump intensity at @xmath64 , @xmath69 and @xmath63 and corresponding phase portraits are shown .",
    "unlike to the previous case here with an increase in pump intensity @xmath10 a successive complication of attractor due to doubling period bifurcation is observed ( see corresponding phase portraits in points _ a _ , _ b _ , _ c _ , _ d _ and _ e _ ) .",
    "thus , in such a case ( @xmath64 , @xmath69 and @xmath63 ) an increasing in @xmath10 results to transition to chaos due to feigenbaum scenario @xcite .",
    "chaotic attractor is shown with the help of insertion _ f)_. as in a previous case a decrease in @xmath10 leads to transition to chaos at @xmath75 through intermittency @xcite .",
    "it is well known that dynamical systems can realize four types of attractors in phase space , namely : non chaotic non strange attractor , chaotic non strange attractor , strange non chaotic attractor and chaotic strange attractor .",
    "so , for chaotic attractor one has ( @xmath77 ) and for an strange one a fractal dimension of an attractor is fractional . in @xcite",
    "it was shown that the fractal dimension of an attractor which is realized in the dynamical system , is determined with the help of lyapunov exponents due to relation @xmath78 where @xmath79 is a minimal lyapunov exponent .",
    "thus , for considered attractor in a point _",
    "f _ at @xmath63 , @xmath80 , @xmath64 and @xmath67 ( see fig.[fig2 ] ) one has : @xmath81 , @xmath82 and , accordingly , @xmath83 . for the attractor at @xmath63 , @xmath84 , @xmath64 and @xmath69",
    "( see fig.[fig3 ] ) one has @xmath85 , @xmath86 and accordingly , @xmath87 .",
    "thus , attractors in fig.[fig2]f and fig.[fig3]f are strange and chaotic .",
    "we have studied an influence of nonlinear dissipation and external perturbations onto transition scenarious to chaos in lorenz - haken system .",
    "dissipation processes are defined due to nonlinear dependence of order parameter relaxation time @xmath1 versus its values .",
    "external perturbations are modeled by a potential of the fold catastrophe @xmath31 .    from a physical view point",
    "we have considered an absorptive optical bistability system @xcite . at that time used nonlinear dissipation relation related to the possibility of the additional medium in the fabry - perot cavity ( phthalocyanine fluid , gases @xmath88 , @xmath89 , and @xmath90 @xcite ) to absorbing signals with weak intensities . meanwhile , external perturbations model an influence of optical modulator which sets additional interphotons interaction processes in the fabry - perot cavity .",
    "we have considered a case of commensurability of relaxation times for order parameter , conjugated field and control parameter .",
    "we have shown that varying in external potential parameters values leads to parameters domain formation with @xmath91 and with @xmath10 by order of magnitude greater than @xmath21 of chaos realization . in considered system transitions from regular to chaotic dynamics",
