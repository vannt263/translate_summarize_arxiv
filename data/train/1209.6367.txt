    "the conventional assumption made in the design of communication systems is that the energy used to transfer information between a sender and a recipient can not be reused for future communication tasks .",
    "there are , however , notable exceptions .",
    "an example is given by communication based on wireless energy transfer , such as passive rfid systems @xcite or some body area networks @xcite , in which a terminal can transfer both information and energy via the transmitted radio signal , and the delivered energy can be used for communication by the recipients . for instance , a passive rfid tag modulates information by backscattering the radio energy received from the reader ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "another , less conventional , example is that of a biological system in which information is communicated via the transmission of particles ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , which can be later reused for other communication tasks .",
    "a further potential instance of this type of networks is one in which communication takes place via the exchange of quantum systems , such as photons , which may measured and then reused @xcite .    to summarize , any system that exchanges information via the transfer of given physical resources , such as radio waves , particles or qubits , can conceivably reuse , at least part , of the received resources for later communication tasks .",
    "this conclusion is supported by physical considerations @xcite and practically demonstrated by the existing systems based on this principle @xcite .",
    "it is emphasized that the possibility to deliver jointly energy and information promises not only to ease the energy requirements of various communication systems , but also , more importantly , to enable novel applications , such as the body area networks studied in @xcite .",
    "moreover , an understanding of the interplay between energy and information flows could lead to insights on the workings of some communication systems in nature @xcite .     for a generalized model .",
    ", width=340 ]      while the interaction between energy and information continues to be subject of research in the physics community ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , the topic has been tackled from a communication and information theoretic level only in a handful of pioneering works , as reviewed in the following .",
    "the references @xcite have focused on the problem of maximizing the information rate of a point - to - point system subject to minimum received energy constraints .",
    "specifically , in @xcite a single point - to - point channel was studied , while @xcite investigated a set of parallel point - to - point channels . to illustrate the trade - offs between the transfer of energy and information in a point - to - point channel consider the noiseless transmission of a 4-pam signal in the alphabet @xmath0 .",
    "if one requires the received energy to be the maximum possible , that is , to be equal to @xmath1 , the maximum transferable information rate is 1 bit per symbol , since one is forced to communicate only with the larger energy symbols @xmath2 however , with no receive energy constraint , one can clearly convey 2 bits per symbol by choosing all available symbols with equal probability .",
    "this example also explains the substantial difference between the problems studied in @xcite and that with maximum receive energy constraints studied in @xcite .",
    "the optimization of beamforming strategies under a receive energy constraint was tackled in @xcite for multiantenna broadcast channels .",
    "considerations on the design of the receiver under the constraint that , when harvesting energy from the antenna , the receiver is not able to use the same signal for information decoding , can be found in @xcite .      in all of the previous work summarized above , the requirement on the energy harvested from the received signal is considered to be an additional constraint imposed to the system design .",
    "this work is instead motivated by the observation that , in more complex network scenarios , as mentioned above , the energy harvested from the received signal may be reused for future communication tasks . in this case",
    ", the energy and information content of the exchanged signals should be engineered so as to best suit the requirements of the communication network . to study this aspect , we consider a baseline two - way communication system , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ figsysmodel ] .",
    "this is incidentally the same topology selected by shannon to initiate the study of networks from an information theoretic perspective @xcite . in the considered model ,",
    "the two nodes interact for the exchange of information and can harvest the received energy .    to enable analysis and insights",
    ", we assume that the two parties involved have a common clock and that , at each time , a node can either send an  on symbol ( or  1 ) , which costs one unit of energy , or an  off signal ( or  0 ) , which does not require any energy expenditure . upon reception of a  1 signal , the recipient node can harvest , possibly with some loss , the energy contained in the signal and stores it for future communication tasks .",
    "in order to introduce the main concepts with the minimum of the notation and technical complications , we first consider the case in which the two nodes start with a given number of energy units in their batteries , which can neither be lost or replenished from outside , and the binary channel in either direction is noiseless .    to see that even this simple scenario offers relevant research challenges , we observe the following .",
    "if there were no limitation on the number of energy units , the nodes could communicate 1 bit per channel use in either direction given that the channels are ideal .",
    "however , if there is , say , one energy unit available in the system , only the node that currently possesses the energy unit can transmit a `` 1 '' , whereas the other node is forced to transmit a `` 0 '' .",
    "therefore , the design of the communication strategy at the nodes should aim not only at transferring the most information to the counterpart , but also to facilitate energy transfer to enable communication in the reverse direction .",

    "in this section , we derive inner and outer bounds to the capacity region .      in order to gain insights into the nature of the problem under study",
    ", we consider here various communication strategies .",
    "we start by the simplest , but intuitively important , case with ` u`@xmath56 , and we then generalize to ` u`@xmath57 .",
    "we start with the special case of one energy unit ( @xmath58 ) and assume the initial state @xmath59 , so that the energy unit is initially available at node 1 .",
    "the other case , namely @xmath60 , can be treated in a symmetric way . in this setting , during each channel use , `` information '' can be transferred only from the node where the energy unit resides towards the other node , and not vice versa , since the other node is forced to transmits the `` 0 '' symbol .",
    "this suggests that , when @xmath58 , the channel is necessarily used in a time - sharing manner , and thus the sum - rate is at most one bit per channel use .",
    "the first question is whether the sum - rate of 1 bit / c.u .",
    "is achievable , and , if so , which strategy accomplishes this task .",
    "we start with a rather nave encoding strategy that turns out to be insufficient to achieve the upper bound of 1 bit / c.u .. the nodes agree on a frame size @xmath61 channel uses for some integer @xmath62 and partition the @xmath53 channel uses in @xmath63 frames ( assumed to be an integer for simplicity ) .",
    "the node that has the energy unit at the beginning of the frame communicates @xmath64 bits to the other node by placing the energy unit in one specific channel use among the @xmath65 of the frame .",
    "this process also transfers the energy unit to the other node , and the procedure is repeated .",
    "the sum - rate achieved by this scheme is @xmath66},\\ ] ] which is rather inefficient : the maximum is achieved with @xmath67 , leading to a sum - rate of @xmath68 bits/ c.u ..    the previous strategy can be easily improved by noting that the frame can be interrupted after the channel use in which the energy unit is used , since the receiving node can still decode the transmitted @xmath62 bits .",
    "this strategy corresponds to using a variable - length channel code .",
    "specifically , we can assign , without loss of optimality within this class of strategies , the codeword `` 01 '' to information bit `` 0 '' and the codeword `` 1 '' to bit `` 1 '' .",
    "the average number of channel uses per bit is thus @xmath69@xmath70 .",
    "therefore , the overall number of channel uses necessary for the transmission of @xmath71 bits is upper bounded by @xmath72 with arbitrarily small probability for large @xmath71 by the weak law of large numbers ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "it follows that an achievable sum - rate is given by @xmath73 which is still lower than the upper bound of 1 bit / c.u ..      we now discuss a strategy that achieves the upper bound of @xmath74 bit / c.u .. the procedure is based on time - sharing , as driven by the transfer of the energy unit from one to the other node . specifically , each node @xmath17 has @xmath71 bits of information @xmath75 .",
    "if @xmath71 is large enough , from the law of large numbers , approximately half the bits will be zeros and the other half will be ones .",
    "since the initial state is @xmath59 , node 1 is the first to transmit : it sends its information bits , starting with @xmath76 up until the first bit that equals `` 1 '' .",
    "specifically , assume that we have @xmath77 and @xmath78 .",
    "thus , in the @xmath79th channel use the energy unit is transferred to node 2 . from the @xmath80th channel use , node 2",
    "then starts sending its first bit @xmath81 and the following bits until the first bit equal to `` 1 '' .",
    "the process is then repeated .",
    "it is easy to see that the total time required to finalize this two - way communication is constant and equal do not contain exactly half zeros and half ones . ] to @xmath82 and thus the achieved sum - rate is equal to @xmath83 bit / c.u ..      in the sum - capacity strategy discussed above with @xmath85 energy unit , both nodes transmit equiprobable symbols `` 0 '' and `` 1 '' .",
    "when there are @xmath86 energy units in the system , maximizing the sum - capacity generally requires a different approach .",
    "consider the scenario with @xmath87 energy units : now it can happen that both energy units are available at one node , say node 1 . while node 1 would prefer to transmit equiprobable symbols `` 0 '' and `` 1 '' in order to maximize the _ information _ flow to the recipient , one must now also consider the _ energy _ flow : privileging transmission of a `` 1 '' over that of a `` 0 '' makes it possible to transfer energy to node 2 , leading to a state in which both nodes have energy for the next channel use .",
    "this might be beneficial in terms of achievable sum - rate .",
    "based on this insight , in the following , we propose a coding strategy that employs rate splitting and codebook multiplexing .",
    "the strategy is a natural extension of the baseline approach discussed above for the case @xmath58 .",

    "each codebook @xmath88 is composed of codewords that all have a specific fraction @xmath91 of `` 1 '' symbols .",

    ", we consider both a conventional codebook design in which the same probability @xmath127 is used irrespective of the state @xmath128 , and one in which the probabilities @xmath129 are optimized .",
