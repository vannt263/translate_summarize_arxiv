    "promising mechanisms for providing a pumping mechanism consistent with a continuous atom laser have recently been demonstrated  @xcite . loading a continuous - wave atom laser by optical pumping techniques",
    "was shown in @xcite while the continuous pumping of atoms into a bec via spontaneous emission from a thermal reservoir of atoms was investigated in @xcite .",
    "continuous loading of a non - dissipative atom trap was studied in @xcite .",
    "stability of continuously pumped atom lasers was discussed as well @xcite . in  @xcite , an atom laser that is simultaneously pumped and",

    "interestingly , from this figure , we see that an increase in the number of atoms leads to a more efficient population of the trapping state only in a finite range of @xmath65 , with @xmath66 .",
    "this can be understood by analyzing the incoherent pumping rates into and out of the trappings state .",

    "it can be seen that the trapping state is efficiently populated if @xmath73 and @xmath74 . in this case , from eqs .",
    "( [ pump ] ) it follows that there is a net pumping from the laser - dressed states @xmath75 into the trapping state .",
    "if either @xmath76 or @xmath77 , a pumping channel out of the trapping state exists , and it is virtually empty . from these conditions , we can derive the range of laser parameters over which the trapping state is populated , which evaluates to @xmath78     ( color online ) analysis of the laser parameters leading to an efficient population of the trapping state .",
    "the dashed straight ( green ) lines indicate @xmath79 , @xmath80 , and @xmath81 .",

    "the laser parameters are @xmath86.,width=245 ]    as expected , by comparing figs .",
    "[ fig-3 ] and [ fig-4 ] and other results not shown here , we find that increasing @xmath0 leads to the appearance of sharp jumps between states with almost all atoms either in or out of the trapping state .",
    "this occurs already at a moderate number of atoms .",
    "for example , increasing the number of atoms beyond @xmath63 in fig .",
    "[ fig-4 ] to @xmath47 in fig .",
    "[ fig-3 ] induces only relatively small changes in the trapping population . at higher atom numbers",
    ", we also find that the influence of the repumping is suppressed , as can be seen from the different @xmath87 in figs .",
    "[ fig-3 ] and [ fig-4 ] which do not lead to a strong modification as it is the case for small @xmath0 .",
    "next , we analyze the trapping population as a function of the ratio @xmath62 of the spontaneous decay rates into and out of the trapping state , see fig .  [ fig - ratio ] .",
    "we see that the trapping state population strongly depends on @xmath62 .",
    "larger trapping state populations can be expected for @xmath88 , because then the decay out of the trapping state is smaller than the decay into it . only then , increasing the sample size @xmath0 enhances the trapping state population . in the opposite case @xmath89 , only little population can be transferred into the trapping state , and increasing the sample size @xmath0 even can have a negative effect .",
    "thus we conclude that efficient population of the trapping state in steady - state via collectivity requires that @xmath90 . from fig .",
    "[ fig - ratio ] , it can also be seen that for medium - sized samples , already @xmath91 leads to almost perfect population of the trapping state if incoherent repumping is weak .",

    "the spontaneous emission ratio is @xmath51.,width=245 ]    we also calculated the second - order coherence function of the atoms in the trapping state @xmath5 , which is given by @xmath95 figure  [ fig - g2 ] shows this second - order coherence function as a function of the laser parameters , and for the case with and without incoherent repumping .",
    "interestingly , the photon statistics can be controlled via the laser field parameters .",
    "in particular , for negligible incoherent repumping , the atomic statistics changes from super - poissonian ( @xmath96 ) to sub - poissonian ( @xmath97 ) if @xmath65 is varied , as depicted by the short - dashed curve in fig .  [ fig - g2 ] .",
    "incoherent pumping due to reabsorption of particles , however , restricts the statistics to @xmath98 ( see the long - dashed and dotted curves in fig .  [ fig - g2 ] ) . as it is the case with the trapping state population ,",
    "also the second - order coherence can be improved , i.e. @xmath99 , for smaller samples if @xmath100 , or for @xmath90 and larger samples @xmath101 .    finally , we estimate the requirements of the atom beam for collectivity to occur .",
    "present guided ultra - cold atom beams can achieve fluxes of the order of @xmath102 atom / s with velocities of order of @xmath103  m / s , which corresponds to densities of order @xmath104  @xmath105 , or @xmath106 ( @xmath107 nm in rubidium )  @xcite .",
    "this is close to the densities at which dicke superradiance could be observed in an indium sample in a similar level scheme as considered here  @xcite .",
    "there , a @xmath108 dependence of the superradiance intensity was observed starting from @xmath109  @xmath105 , or @xmath110 ( @xmath111 nm in indium ) .",
    "thus we conclude that , e.g. , an increase of the flux or a decrease of the average velocity by about one order of magnitude compared to the results in  @xcite could allow to enter the regime of collectivity .",
    "note that the collective decay rates will depend on the sample geometry as @xmath112 with a geometrical factor @xmath113  @xcite .",
    "often , @xmath113 can be adjusted to be much smaller than unity .",
    "then , the condition @xmath114 is satisfied , justifying the secular approximation .    in summary",

    "the particle interactions lead to collective decay into a desired trapping state , enhancing the loading performance .",
    "we discussed conditions for an efficient increase of the trapping state population , focusing on the ratio of the spontaneous emission rates , the incoherent repumping via photon absorption in the trap , and the pump laser parameters .",
