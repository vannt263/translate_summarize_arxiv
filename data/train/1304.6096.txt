    "the investigation of the effective nucleon - nucleon ( nn ) interaction in dense hadronic matter is a topic of fundamental importance for nuclear reactions at intermediate energies ( @xmath0 ) and for nuclear structure in general .",
    "the relevant literature is very vast .",
    "reference  @xcite is just a representative example of the traditional microscopic approach where two - nucleon correlations in nuclear systems are introduced through the g - matrix .",
    "moreover , the effective nn interaction is the main ingredient of microscopic predictions of the nuclear equation of state ( eos ) and thus impacts the properties of compact stars .",
    "dense hadronic matter can also be created in the laboratory in energetic heavy - ion ( hi ) collisions .",
    "simulations of hi collisions are typically based on transport equations and describe the evolution of a non - equilibrium system of strongly interacting hadrons undergoing two - body collisions in the presence of a mean field .",
    "the boltzmann - uehling - uhlenbeck equation @xcite and quantum molecular dynamics @xcite , along with their relativistic counterparts @xcite , have been typically employed to describe intermediate - energy hi reactions . _ in - medium _ two - body cross sections are therefore an important component of such simulations .    in direct reactions at intermediate energies the nn cross sections are often used as input to obtain quantum refractive and diffractive effects , replacing the role of optical potentials commonly used in low energy reactions @xcite .",
    "examples such as knockout ( stripping and diffraction dissociation ) reactions , elastic scattering , charge - exchange , and excitation of giant resonances , are often carried out using reaction mechanisms based on the construction of scattering matrices built from the underlying nn scattering .",
    "reaction calculations at intermediate to high energy are often conducted within the framework of the glauber approximation @xcite and have been a frequent tool for testing nuclear models and constraining nuclear sizes .",
    "in fact , the description of complex nuclear reactions at intermediate energies based on individual nn collisions has a long tradition . in the framework of the glauber model ,",
    "the reaction cross section is written in terms of the  thickness function \" , which is the product of the averaged nn cross section and the overlap integral of the target and projectile local densities .    in - medium",
    "nn cross sections have been calculated with a variety of methods . in semi - phenomenological approaches",
    ", one makes the assumption that the transition matrix in the medium is approximately the same as the one in vacuum and that medium effects come in only through the use of effective masses in the phase space factor @xcite .",
    "then , the in - medium cross section is scaled ( relative to its value in vacuum ) as the square of the ratio of the ( reduced ) masses .",
    "phenomenological formulas , such as the one in ref .",
    "@xcite , have been developed for practical purposes and combine the energy dependence of empirical free - space nn cross sections with the density dependence of some microscopic models .",
    "microscopic predictions based on a medium - modified collision matrix were reported , for instance , in ref .",
    "@xcite , where dirac - brueckner - hartree - fock ( dbhf ) medium effects were applied to obtain a medium - modified @xmath1-matrix .",
    "more recent microscopic calculations applied dbhf medium effects to produce a complex g - matrix including consideration of isospin dependence in asymmetric nuclear matter @xcite .",
    "it is the purpose of this paper to present our updated predictions of microscopic in - medium elastic nn cross sections with an improved description of pauli blocking .",
    "the main objective is to produce two - body cross sections which include , microscopically , all important medium effects and are suitable for realistic applications in nucleus - nucleus scattering at intermediate energies including direct and central collisions . as explained in section",
    "ii , we start from a one - boson - exchange nn potential , which describes well the elastic part of the nn interaction up to high energy . thus , as long as we are not interested in pion production , which is negligible up to , at least , several hundreds of mev , it is reasonable to use nn elastic cross sections as input to the reaction model . of course , the elastic part of the nn interaction can and does generate inelastic nucleus - nucleus scattering .    in section",
    "ii , we describe the details of the calculation and highlight the differences with our previous approach .",
    "we then present a selection of results ( section iii ) followed by our conclusions and outlook ( section iv ) .",
    "the starting point of our calculation is a realistic nn interaction which is applied in the nuclear medium without any additional free parameters .",
    "we use relativistic meson theory , which we find to be an appropriate framework to deal with the high momenta encountered in dense matter . in particular",
    ", the one - boson - exchange ( obe ) model has proven very successful in describing nn data in free space and has a good theoretical foundation .",
    "the obe potential is defined as a sum of one - particle - exchange amplitudes of certain bosons with given mass and coupling . in general , six non - strange bosons with masses below 1 gev@xmath2 are used .",
    "thus , @xmath3 with @xmath4 and @xmath5 pseudoscalar , @xmath6 and @xmath7 scalar , and @xmath8 and @xmath9 vector particles",
    ". for more details , see ref .",
    "@xcite . among the many available obe potentials , some being part of the  high - precision generation \" @xcite",
    ", we seek a momentum - space potential developed within a relativistic scattering equation , such as the one obtained through the thompson @xcite three - dimensional reduction of the bethe - salpeter equation @xcite .",
    "first , a self - consistent calculation of ( symmetric or asymmetric ) nuclear matter is performed within the dbhf approach @xcite .",
    "this step yields , along with the eos , the self - consistent nuclear matter potential , which is conveniently parametrized in terms of nucleon effective masses ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for details ) .",
    "then , the thompson equation is solved for two nucleons scattering at some positive energy in the presence of a mean field due to the medium .",
    "the presence of the medium is accounted for through the ( previously calculated ) effective masses ( applied in the two - nucleon propagator and also in the dirac spinors representing the nucleons , consistent with the dbhf philosophy ) and the presence of the ( angle - averaged ) pauli operator to account for pauli blocking of the _ intermediate states_.    in the usual free - space scattering scenario , the two - body cross section is typically represented as a function of the incident laboratory energy , uniquely related to the nucleon momentum in the two - body center - of - mass frame , @xmath10 , through relativistic invariants which yield the well - known relation @xmath11 . in nuclear matter , though , the pauli operator depends also on the total momentum of the two nucleons in the nuclear matter rest frame . for simplicity , in the past",
    "we have used in - vacuum kinematics to define the total momentum of the two - nucleon system ( that is , we assumed that the target nucleon is at rest , on the average ) .",
    "schematically , the effect of pauli principle on intermediate states arises in the g - matrix through the in - medium scattering equation @xcite : @xmath12 with @xmath13 , @xmath14 , and @xmath15 the initial , final , and intermediate relative momenta of the nn pair in their center of mass , and @xmath16 their total momentum .",
    "@xmath17 is the energy of the two - nucleon system in the center - of - mass , and @xmath18 is the same quantity on - shell .    to account for pauli blocking of the _ final state _ , we define the total elastic cross section as @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the elastic differential cross section obtained from the g - matrix amplitudes as described above .",
    "@xmath21 is the scattering angle and @xmath22 the fermi momentum .",
    "the presence of the pauli operator in eq .",
    "( [ sigmed ] ) signifies that the integration domain is restricted by @xcite @xmath23 setting @xmath24 in eq .",
    "( [ sigmed ] ) amounts to ignoring pauli blocking of the final state .",
    "( the virtual intermediate states are always subjected to pauli blocking during the g - matrix calculation which produces the amplitudes contained in @xmath25 . )",
    "additional simplifications result from the assumption that the differential cross section is isotropic .",
    "the cross section defined in eq .",
    "( [ sigmed ] ) refers to an idealized scenario where a projectile nucleon , with some momentum above the bottom of the fermi sea , strikes a target nucleon while both embedded in an infinite medium . for application to a realistic nucleus - nucleus scattering scenario , it is best to consider the situation depicted in fig .",
    "[ one ] , where the two fermi spheres represent the local densities of the target and projectile ions .",
    "@xmath26 is the incident momentum ( the momentum of the colliding _ nuclei _ relative to each other ) , whereas @xmath27 and @xmath28 are the momenta of any two _ nucleons_. that is ,",
    "@xmath27 and @xmath29 are the momenta of the two nucleons with respect to the same point .",
    "then , the relative momentum @xmath30 and the total momentum @xmath31 are given by @xmath32 , and @xmath33 , respectively .",
    "the larger circle in the figure is centered at @xmath16 while @xmath34 is the radius of the scattering sphere .",
    "the vector @xmath30 can rotate around the scattering sphere while maintaining constant magnitude due to energy - momentum conservation .",
    "notice that , with the definitions given above , relative momenta which are off the symmetry axis of the two fermi spheres ( the @xmath26 direction ) are allowed , which is not the case with the assumptions made in eq .",
    "( [ sigmed ] ) .",
    "that is , the two interacting nucleons can have momenta in arbitrary directions . in turn , this impacts the solid angle allowed by pauli blocking , as shown below .",
    "( for completeness , we provide a detailed derivation of the allowed solid angle in the next subsection . )    in preparation for the nucleus - nucleus calculation , it is shown in refs .",
    "@xcite that the _ average _ nn cross section ( assuming isotropy of the nn differential cross section ) can be written as @xmath35 where @xmath36 and @xmath37 are smaller @xmath38 and @xmath39 , respectively , and the angular integrations extend over all possible directions of @xmath27 and @xmath28 allowed by pauli blocking .",
    "often , the empirical free - space nn cross section is used in the integral . in our case",

    "( [ sigav ] ) can be reduced to a fivefold integration .",
    "notice that the  symmetric \" choice @xmath43 @xcite amounts to making the approximations we adopted when writing eq .",
    "( [ sigmed ] ) .",
    "finally , for an actual nucleus - nucleus scattering with given @xmath44 , the average cross section given above becomes a function of the laboratory energy , @xmath45 , and the local densities of the colliding nuclei , @xmath46 , and are ready to be used in typical high - energy calculations .",

    "( [ avesigeb]-[sigmar ] ) and our new prescription of pauli - blocking effects will be the subject of a future work .",
    "as mentioned in the previous section , the relative momentum @xmath30 and the total momentum @xmath31 are given as @xmath56 , and @xmath57 .",
    "we also define a vector @xmath58 as @xmath59 . assuming that the collision is elastic , conservation of energy and momentum requires @xmath60 the quantities @xmath61 and @xmath62 are the momenta of two nucleons after the collision , whereas @xmath63 is the relative momentum after collision , with @xmath64 . because of the pauli exclusion principle , the following restrictions apply : @xmath65 or , @xmath66    in the equations above , @xmath67 is the angle between @xmath16 and @xmath63 , and @xmath68 the angle between @xmath47 and @xmath63 . as illustrated in fig .",

    "figure  [ three ] shows how @xmath77 and @xmath78 are projected on the surface of a unit sphere . if @xmath79 is the intersection of @xmath75 and @xmath76 , it is obvious that    @xmath80    the case @xmath81 is more complex than the other three cases and a more detailed study is needed . as shown in fig .",
    "[ four ] , @xmath82 and @xmath83 are the centers of the two circular projections @xmath77 and @xmath78 .",

    "after  overcoming \" complete pauli blocking , the cross section generally rises with increasing incident momentum . in the @xmath111 case ,",
    "we observe , at least at the lower densities , a tendency to reach a broad maximum . in all cases ,",

    ", the @xmath110 and @xmath111 cross sections shown by the dashed blue line are also calculated with eq .",
    "( [ sigav ] ) , but the input nn cross sections in the integrand are evaluated in free space .",
    "thus , comparing the two curves on the left - hand - side ( or on the right , for @xmath111 ) shows the impact of the additional medium effects ( besides those coming from the @xmath112 factor in eq .",
    "( [ sigav ] ) ) originating from the g - matrix calculation and included in @xmath113 in the case of the solid curves .",
    "the impact is noticeable , with the microscopic medium effects further suppressing the cross section and shifting the position of the peak .",
    "we have chosen a particular case ( @xmath114 ) for the purpose of demonstration , but the trend is similar for other densities .",
    "figure  [ eight ] is crucial for the point that we wish to make .",

    "again , we have taken a representative case , but this pattern is common to all densities",
    ". it will be interesting to explore the impact of such differences on reaction cross sections , our next objective .",
    "pauli blocking is perhaps the most important mechanism impacting the collision of two fermions in the medium . it is known to have a substantial effect on the scattering probability , that is , the in - medium cross section .    in this paper , we predict in - medium effective nn cross sections suitable for applications to nucleus - nucleus scattering . the microscopic nn elastic cross sections , modified by all medium effects implied by the dirac - brueckner - hartree - fock theory of nuclear matter , are properly averaged so as to account for all possible directions of the relative momentum of two nucleons in the two colliding fermi spheres .",
    "the more realistic description of the collision geometry amounts to an improved description of pauli blocking as compared to a previous approach @xcite .",
