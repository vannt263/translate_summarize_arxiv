    "hybrid monte carlo ( hmc ) is now the standard method to simulate fermionic field theories @xcite .",
    "it is exact , relatively simple to implement , and its cost grows just a little faster than the volume @xmath2 of the system @xcite .",
    "this should not stop us from searching for better algorithms .",
    "fermionic interactions give rise , after integration of the fermionic fields , to a non - local determinant .",
    "hmc addresses the problem of the non - locality of this determinant by linearizing the action in a succession of molecular dynamics steps .",
    "the calculation of the force at each step is obtained via the iterative solution of a sparse linear system .",
    "but this linearization implies infinitesimal steps , which in turn make narrow , very high energy barriers nearly impassable .",
    "thus very long autocorrelation times have been observed , eg . for the topological charge",
    "@xcite , and ergodicity may be questionable when the vanishing of the fermion determinant divides phase space into disconnected regions @xcite .",
    "a finite step - size algorithm is highly desirable .",
    "all such algorithms have been abandoned , because of their high cost proportional to @xmath3 @xcite . recently however , lscher proposed a finite - step bosonic formulation where one can control , through the number of auxiliary bosonic fields , the trade - off between accuracy and computer cost @xcite .",
    "surprisingly , no systematic investigation of this trade - off has appeared in the literature , except in full - blown studies of the complete qcd theory @xcite .",
    "it is our purpose to fill this gap here , by studying the weak and strong coupling limits , and the interacting theory on a sample of hmc configurations . in section 2 ,",
    "we recall lscher s formulation of the qcd determinant , and explain our methodology . in section 3",
    ", we present our results for the systematic error of the method . in section 4 , we investigate the effect of the usual ` even - odd splitting ' of the dirac operator . in section 5 , we propose a non - hermitian variant , with improved convergence , suited also for an odd number of quark flavors .",
    "section 6 describes a simple metropolis test which makes the algorithm exact .",
    "conclusions follow .",
    "in cases where the fermionic determinant can be written as a square @xmath4 , lscher has proposed a general method to approximate it by a local bosonic action .",
    "the essential steps are :    @xmath5 find a real polynomial @xmath6 of even degree @xmath7 , approaching @xmath8 as @xmath9 over the spectrum of @xmath10 , which must be real .",
    "@xmath5 decompose @xmath6 into a product of monomials @xmath11    such that @xmath12    where @xmath13 is the rank of @xmath10 .",
    "@xmath5 express each factor above as a gaussian integral over bosonic fields , so that finally @xmath14 [ d{\\phi}_k ]       e^{-{\\phi}_k^{\\dag } ( q - \\sqrt{z_{k}})^{\\dag }                           ( q - \\sqrt{z_{k } } ) { \\phi}_k } \\ ] ]    thus one trades the initial non - local determinant for a bosonic action which is a sum of @xmath7 local terms .",
    "this bosonic action can be viewed as a discrete path integral ; it converges to the exact determinant as the discretization step @xmath15 tends to zero .",
    "note that the normalization factor @xmath16 of the polynomial drops out of any expectation value .",
    "here we study this approach when applied to dynamical wilson fermions .",
    "let us denote the dirac matrix by @xmath17    where @xmath18 is the lattice wilson hopping operator and @xmath19 the hopping parameter .",
    "lscher chooses for @xmath20 the hermitian operator @xmath21 where @xmath22 is introduced to guarantee that the norm of @xmath20 is bounded by one , and his method to approximate @xmath4 applies to 2 degenerate quark flavors .",
    "the particular polynomial adopted by lscher is built from chebyshev polynomials @xmath23 , with the definitions    @xmath24    @xmath25    @xmath26    the approximation polynomial is then defined by    @xmath27    where @xmath28 is the scaled and translated chebyshev polynomial such that @xmath29 ,    @xmath30    with @xmath1 an adjustable parameter @xmath31 . by straightforward algebra ,",
    "one verifies that the zeroes of @xmath6 , @xmath32 are given by    @xmath33    a very important advantage of using chebyshev polynomials is that the error of the approximation can be bounded , and the bound converges exponentially with @xmath7 :    @xmath34\\ ] ]    the proof is given in section 5 .",
    "our methodology to assess the error of this method and to compare it with other variants , is the following : we compute the quantity    @xmath35    by calculating the eigenvalues of @xmath10 , @xmath36 , so that    @xmath37    to properly cover the full range of gauge couplings , we study the variations of @xmath38 in 3 different cases .",
    "\\i ) for free fermions the spectrum of @xmath20 is known analytically ; we estimate the error by monitoring @xmath39 .",
    "\\ii ) in the strong coupling limit we generate a sample of quenched @xmath40 configurations , and measure the fluctuation of @xmath38 by monitoring    @xmath41    the reason for the normalization factor @xmath42 is to remove the dependence of the error on the arbitrary constant @xmath16 ( eq.([pol ] ) ) .",
    "\\iii ) at intermediate coupling , we perform the same analysis for a set of matrices @xmath10 generated by hybrid monte carlo at @xmath43 and @xmath44 on a @xmath40 lattice .",
    "in the case of free fermions , our definition @xmath39 of the error depends on the normalization coefficient @xmath16 . a simple way to compute @xmath16 relies on the observation that @xmath45 , so that @xmath46 we then show in fig.1a the error as a function of the parameter @xmath1 , for 20 , 54 , 90 and 148 boson fields ( @xmath47 , on an @xmath48 lattice ) . as expected , there is an optimal value for @xmath1 : if @xmath1 is too large , the polynomial approximation degrades over the lower part of the spectrum of @xmath10 ; if @xmath1 is too small , the approximation becomes poor over the whole spectrum , because @xmath49 approaches 1 ( see eq.([l_bound ] ) ) .",
    "not surprisingly , the optimal value of @xmath1 is slightly larger than the smallest eigenvalue of @xmath10 , and approaches it as the number of bosonic fields increases .    at finite @xmath0 , fluctuations of @xmath50",
    "complicate the matter : configurations with small @xmath50 contribute larger errors , so that @xmath1 must be tuned slightly @xmath51 @xmath52 in order to minimize the average error , when this error is small .",
    "this behaviour is shown in the ( quenched ) strong coupling in fig.1b for @xmath53 .",
    "it remains unchanged at intermediate couplings @xmath54 in fig.1c , where we also illustrate a typical spectrum of the matrix @xmath55 in fig.2a .    from these figures",
    ", it appears that the optimal ratio @xmath56 is relatively insensitive to @xmath0 .",
    "this should simplify the task of tuning @xmath1 .      as mentioned in @xcite ,",
    "rescaling the matrix @xmath20 ( see eq.([q_mat ] ) ) to @xmath57 can be useful .",
    "this is equivalent to rescaling the roots of the polynomial @xmath58 . in @xcite",
    "one assumes @xmath59 to guarantee that the spectrum is bounded by one .",
    "nonetheless , one may let @xmath60 be less than one , if one monitors the largest eigenvalue of @xmath10 . under rescaling ,",
    "this largest eigenvalue approaches 1 , making use of the full interval @xmath61 $ ] of validity of the approximation ( [ gaussian ] ) .",
    "simultaneously the smallest eigenvalue of @xmath10 increases , with corresponding gains in convergence .",
    "one readily sees from equation ( [ l_bound ] ) that the number @xmath7 of boson fields can be multiplied by @xmath62 .",
    "the benefits of tuning @xmath60 vanish in the weak coupling limit , since the largest eigenvalue of @xmath10 then tends to 1 . even in the strong coupling ,",
    "the advantage remains small , @xmath63 .",
    "but the normalization of @xmath20 must be considered carefully when one uses even - odd splitting of the lattice sites .",
    "lscher s method is based on a polynomial approximation of the inverse , just like iterative methods to find the quark propagator , with the difference that the polynomial is _ predetermined _ in lscher s case , whereas it is built recursively and _ adaptively _ by an iterative linear solver .",
    "the similarity of the two approaches should encourage us to try here what works well there .",
    "in this section we test the simplest such idea , that of partitioning the lattice sites into ` even ' and ` odd ' , and of factorizing @xmath4 into equal , even and odd factors .    to justify such a factorization , we simplify the derivation used in @xcite for staggered fermions .",
    "define a diagonal operator @xmath64 with entries @xmath65 on even sites and @xmath66 on odd sites .",
    "this operator anticommutes with the hopping matrix @xmath18 , since @xmath18 connects even and odd sites . noting that @xmath67",
    ", one gets    @xmath68    now @xmath69 , and @xmath70 , so that    @xmath71    furthermore we observe that @xmath72 commutes with @xmath64 ; then if @xmath73 is an eigenvector of @xmath72 , so is @xmath74 , or @xmath75 , which is non - zero on even or odd sites respectively .",
    "therefore all eigenvalues are two - fold degenerate , and one has    @xmath76    so we can finally write    @xmath77    this way we can work with bosonic fields defined on even sites only , saving a factor 2 in memory .",
    "the bosonic action however is now less local , so that a bosonic update requires about as many operations as before .",
    "nonetheless , further gain may come through a reduction in the number of bosonic families required for a given accuracy .",
    "the reason for this potential gain becomes clear when one looks at the spectrum of a typical configuration : the spectrum of fig.2a shrinks to that of fig.2b after even - odd preconditioning .",
    "one can now readjust @xmath1 and vary the number @xmath7 of bosonic families , with and without even - odd splitting . in both cases ,",
    "the error decreases exponentially with @xmath7 , as predicted by eq.([l_bound ] ) ; but it does so much faster in the even - odd splitting formulation , as illustrated in figs . 3a and 3b for @xmath78 and @xmath54 respectively . in both figures",
    "the gain is a factor 2 to 3 in @xmath7 .",
    "this large gain can be understood by considering the spectral radius of @xmath79 , say @xmath80 : the smallest eigenvalue of entering the determinant eq.([17 ] ) is @xmath81 , but that in eq.([20 ] ) is @xmath82",
    ". thus the optimal value of @xmath83 should also increase by a factor 2 , which according to eq.([l_bound ] ) allows a reduction of @xmath7 by the same factor .",
    "in addition , one can achieve important gains by tuning the rescaling constant @xmath60 to bring the largest eigenvalue of @xmath10 close to 1 , as explained in the previous section .",
    "the normalization constant which guarantees that the norm of @xmath84 is bounded by one is now @xmath85 . but with this normalization , the largest eigenvalue of @xmath10 becomes rather small away from @xmath86 .",
    "thus in figs.3a and 3b both , we tuned @xmath60 to 0.6 instead of its default value of 1 .",
    "another lesson can be learned from iterative solvers @xcite : the method of biconjugate gradients ( bicg ) @xcite requires less work than that of conjugate gradients ( cg ) @xcite .",
    "bicg applies lanczos polynomials on the matrices @xmath55 and @xmath87 to construct the solution , whereas cg applies the lanczos polynomial on the matrix @xmath88 .",
    "this observation motivated us to look for an approximation to @xmath89 itself , instead of @xmath90 .",
    "this should be possible as long as @xmath91 is positive .",
    "but a negative determinant can only be caused by negative _",
    "real _ eigenvalues ; this situation can only occur for very small quark masses as studied in the quenched case by @xcite , beyond those reachable by present - day simulations of full qcd .",
    "the benefits of the approach proposed below are two - fold : convergence of the approximation is improved ; and the simulation of an odd number of quark flavors ( or of any number of non - degenerate flavors ) becomes possible .",
    "let @xmath92 be a polynomial of even degree @xmath7 , with real coefficients , defined in the complex plane ( since the spectrum of @xmath55 is complex ) , with complex conjugate roots @xmath93 .",
    "assume that this polynomial satisfies @xmath94 for @xmath95 , where @xmath96 is a domain in the complex plane containing the spectrum of @xmath55",
    ". then one can write    @xmath97    using the fact that @xmath98 and @xmath70 one gets    @xmath99    it follows that    @xmath100    and , in analogy with eq.([gaussian ] ) @xmath101 [ d{\\phi}_k ]       e^{-{\\phi}_k^{\\dag } ( d - z_{k})^{\\dag }                           ( d - z_{k } ) { \\phi}_k } \\ ] ]    the approximation polynomial can be defined as before by    @xmath102    where @xmath103 is a polynomial of degree @xmath104 such that @xmath29 .",
    "@xmath105 should be small in the domain @xmath96 of the approximation .",
    "the spectrum of @xmath55 has a more or less elliptical shape , as can be seen from fig.2a .",
    "it is then natural to choose for the boundary @xmath106 an ellipse . in that case (",
    "provided the origin is not inside the ellipse ) , it turns out that the polynomial which minimizes @xmath107 is again a chebyshev polynomial @xcite",
    ".    the same definitions eqs.([t0]-[tn ] ) remain valid for @xmath108 , where now @xmath109 and @xmath110 , that is    @xmath111    where @xmath112 $ ] and , for instance , @xmath113 .",
    "note that , for @xmath114 fixed , @xmath115 describes an ellipse in the complex plane , with foci @xmath116 and semiaxes @xmath117 and @xmath118 .",
    "from these definitions we can now specify the form of @xmath103 .",
    "choose for @xmath119 the ellipse centered at @xmath120 , with large semiaxis @xmath121 , and focal distance @xmath122 .",
    "then the scaled and translated chebyshev polynomial @xmath103 is defined by    @xmath123    from this definition one can show , in analogy with the hermitian case , that the roots of @xmath92 , @xmath32 are    @xmath124    so that the @xmath125 s lie on the ellipse of same center and foci as @xmath119 , which goes through the origin .",
    "we can now derive an error bound for the above polynomial approximation in the complex plane .",
    "it states that    @xmath126    _ proof .",
    "_ by definition    @xmath127    where @xmath128    from eq.([cos_expan ] ) , one sees that @xmath129 , where @xmath130 .",
    "writing @xmath131 , one gets    @xmath132    so that    @xmath133    the coordinates of any point @xmath134 in @xmath96 can be expressed as @xmath135 .",
    "successive @xmath114 s define nested ellipses , all of center @xmath136 and focal distance @xmath137 : the innermost one , for @xmath138 , is the real segment @xmath139 $ ] ; the outermost one , for @xmath140 , is @xmath106 . along each such ellipse",
    "@xmath105 is bounded by @xmath141 , and reaches this bound when @xmath134 is real .",
    "the bound increases with @xmath114 , so that over @xmath96 , @xmath105 is bounded by    @xmath142    the second factor is bounded by 2 . substituting @xmath143 and @xmath144 by their definitions in terms of @xmath145 , one recovers eq.([zbound ] ) .",
    "this derivation makes it clear that the error @xmath105 is maximum on the real points of @xmath119 , but decreases exponentially inside @xmath96 .",
    "this is in sharp contrast with the hermitian approximation of lscher .",
    "two limiting cases for @xmath119 are of special interest : the circle ( @xmath146 ) , which corresponds to the spectrum of @xmath55 in the ( quenched ) strong coupling ; and the real line segment @xmath147 $ ] ( @xmath148 ) , which corresponds to the spectrum of @xmath10 originally considered by lscher .",
    "for these 2 cases the error bound eq.([zbound ] ) becomes @xmath149 and @xmath150 respectively . to make contact with the hermitian error bound eq.([l_bound ] ) , we just express @xmath151 and @xmath152 .",
    "we recover then eq.([l_bound ] ) over the real segment @xmath61 $ ] ; over the circle we get :    @xmath153 the smallest eigenvalue of @xmath55 .",
    "then the smallest eigenvalue of @xmath10 will be @xmath154 , and the hermitian and non - hermitian bounds eqs.([l_bound ] ) and ( [ u_bound ] ) are identical is @xmath155 , then the smallest eigenvalue of @xmath10 is @xmath156 ; but the relationship between _ eigen_values of @xmath55 and of @xmath10 could be quite different , especially in the chirally broken phase . in particular one easily proves that @xmath157 , so the comparison we make here is a worst case scenario : the non - hermitian variant will always be at least as accurate as the hermitian one . ] .",
    "it is true that only @xmath158 bosonic fields are necessary to generate @xmath159 in the non - hermitian case ; but for 2 degenerate quark flavors , one needs another @xmath158 fields to finally approximate @xmath160 , for the same total of @xmath7 fields as in the hermitian case .    when @xmath0 increases , the error bound for the non - hermitian case improves .",
    "the spectrum of @xmath55 can then be contained in a more elongated ellipse whose aspect ratio tends to 2 in the free field limit .",
    "it is straightforward to verify from eq.([zbound ] ) that the convergence rate is multiplied by 2 , allowing a reduction of @xmath7 by the same factor .",
    "as importantly , the error in the non - hermitian approximation decreases exponentially inside @xmath96 . to exhibit this difference with the hermitian approximation",
    ", we show in fig.4 the magnitude of the error along the real axis , for @xmath161 and @xmath162 .",
    "that is , the range of the approximation in the hermitian case is @xmath163 $ ] , whereas in the non - hermitian case it is @xmath164 $ ] . in the hermitian case ,",
    "the error oscillates with constant amplitude @xmath165 over the interval @xmath166 $ ] . in the non - hermitian case ,",
    "when @xmath119 is a circle the error at @xmath167 and @xmath168 is also @xmath165 ; when @xmath119 is an ellipse of aspect ratio 2 , the error at @xmath167 and @xmath168 is about squared .",
    "either way , the error falls off exponentially inside the approximation range , until it becomes uniformly oscillating in the segment @xmath169 $ ] .",
    "so the accuracy on interior eigenvalues of @xmath55 is much improved .",
    "we make numerical tests of this non - hermitian approximation for hmc and strong coupling configurations .",
    "we apply the same methodology as before , but in the non - hermitian case we measure the fluctuations of the quantity    @xmath170    where now @xmath171 are eigenvalues of the quark matrix @xmath55 . with this definition of @xmath38",
    "we can compare the results directly to the hermitian case .",
    "in figs.5 we show that the errors of the non - hermitian approximation are reduced faster than in the hermitian approximation . from fig.5a we can see that in the quenched strong coupling , the gain is a factor 4 to 5 , increasing as the quark mass is reduced .",
    "this large gain is caused by the high density of interior eigenvalues .",
    "in fig.5b at @xmath43 , the gain is a factor @xmath172 , coming mostly from the elliptical shape of @xmath106 .",
    "note that simulating one flavor to the same accuracy would require half as many fields .",
    "lscher s original proposal includes the monitoring of the error , and the possibility of obtaining exact results by re - weighting the monte carlo measurements of each observable .",
    "the natural way to calculate the error eq.([y_def ] ) is to express it in an eigenbasis of @xmath10 , obtained by the lanczos algorithm .",
    "however two obstacles appear : the lanczos algorithm is affected by roundoff errors , which can be controlled only if eigenvalue multiplicities are known @xcite , and its cost grows like the square of the volume @xmath2 of the lattice , so that it becomes overwhelmingly expensive on large lattices",
    ". nevertheless attempts at using the lanczos method in a metropolis test show that most if not all of the error can be removed @xcite .",
    "in fact , it is sufficient to construct an unbiased estimator of the ratio of errors between the new and the old configurations .",
    "one can then use the noisy monte carlo method of @xcite , which was successfully applied to fermionic simulations before the advent of hybrid monte carlo @xcite .    the ratio to estimate",
    "is @xmath173 , calling @xmath174 and @xmath55 the dirac operators for the new and old configurations respectively . taking the denominator as a partition function , this ratio can be rewritten @xmath175 where the average @xmath176 is taken over all gaussian vectors @xmath155 , and @xmath177^{-1 } d p(d)$ ] .",
    "it is sufficient to estimate this ratio by taking one gaussian @xmath155 only .",
    "this requires the solution of a linear system , which will take just a few iterations since the matrix @xmath178 is almost the identity .",
    "the cost of this additional step is therefore similar to that of an update of the @xmath179 s .",
    "as the volume @xmath2 of the lattice grows , one should keep constant the acceptance of this metropolis test .",
    "this is achieved if the error per eigenvalue scales like @xmath180 . because the approximation is exponential in @xmath7 , this can be accomplished by a modest increase @xmath181 in @xmath7 , and a cpu cost scaling like @xmath182 . under this rescaling of @xmath2 ,",
    "the number of iterations necessary to solve the linear system above remains constant , so that the overhead of the metropolis test , measured in update sweeps , does not change .",
    "similarly , when the quark mass is decreased but the acceptance is kept constant , the overhead of the metropolis step , measured in update sweeps , will not change .",
    "we have studied the systematic errors of lscher s method to simulate dynamical quarks , in the full range of strong to weak coupling .",
    "two parameters define the approximation , @xmath1 and @xmath7 : @xmath1 is the lower cutoff of the polynomial approximation , @xmath7 is the number of auxiliary bosonic families .",
    "we confirm the importance of tuning @xmath1 near the minimum eigenvalue of @xmath10 ; the optimal ratio @xmath183 approaches 1 from above as @xmath7 increases , in a manner almost independent of @xmath0 ; it actually becomes slightly less than 1 for large @xmath7 , because configurations with small @xmath50 give larger errors . for @xmath1",
    "fixed , we confirm the exponential convergence of the approximation with @xmath7 .    in addition , we have studied the improvement of even - odd preconditioning : it allows a reduction of @xmath7 by a factor 2 to 3 .",
    "a full reduction however can only be achieved by tuning to less than 1 the normalization parameter @xmath60 of the matrix @xmath20 .",
    "we have introduced a non - hermitian variant , which allows the simulation of an odd number of quark flavors .",
    "the number of bosonic families is proportional to that of flavors . for 2 flavors ,",
    "the non - hermitian formulation allows a reduction of @xmath7 by a factor 1.5 to 5 .",
    "full monte carlo tests of this variant are in progress .",
    "they will shed some light on the critical dynamics of the bosonic fields @xmath179 , which depend on the singular values of @xmath184 , and might be different from the original hermitian version .",
    "even - odd preconditioning and non - hermitian formulation are most advantageous for large quark masses and small @xmath0 respectively .",
    "these two improvements can be combined when appropriate .",
    "finally we have proposed a metropolis test which removes any approximation .",
    "the overhead of this metropolis test is modest and independent of the lattice volume and the quark mass .",
    "the error we have considered is that on the fermionic determinant itself .",
    "the error measured on a given observable during a monte carlo simulation of the lscher action will depend on the overlap of that observable with the various eigenmodes of the determinant , and may be smaller than we measured here .",
