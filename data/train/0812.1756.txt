    "the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) fluctuations , a relic radiation originated around 400,000 years after the big - bang , is one of the most outstanding sources for understanding the evolution and energy / matter content of the universe . the large amount of high quality data provided by recent cmb experiments and other complementary astronomical observations , have provided with a consistent picture for a flat universe filled with cold dark matter ( cdm ) and dark energy in the form of a cosmological constant ( @xmath2 ) , plus the standard baryonic and electromagnetic components : the _ concordance model _ ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "however , beyond the strength of the cmb measurements to put constraints on the cosmological parameters , like the ones already provided by the nasa _",
    "wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe _",
    "( wmap , * ? ? ? * ) and the ones expected from the incoming esa _ planck satellite _ , the cmb is a unique tool to probe fundamental principles and assumptions of the so - called _",
    "standard model_. in particular , the application of sophisticated statistical analysis to cmb data might help us to understand whether the temperature fluctuations of the primordial radiation are compatible with the fundamental isotropic and gaussian predictions from the _ inflationary phase_. the basic inflationary scenario relates the cmb fluctuations , as well as the large - scale structure of the universe , to the gaussian quantum energy density perturbations present during the early universe  ( see for instance * ? ? ?",
    "the present homogeneity and isotropy of the universe is compatible with an inflationary era in the early universe and this idea is the only way , nowadays , to explain efficiently current observations ranging from galaxies to the cmb . in particular",
    ", this fundamental hypothesis predicts that the cmb fluctuations follow an isotropic and gaussian random .",
    "in fact , the estimation of the cosmological parameters defining the concordance model is done by assuming these statistical properties .",
    "the quality of current cmb data ( in particular the ones provided by the wmap satellite ) has allowed for a systematic probe of the statistical properties of the relic radiation .",
    "indeed , the interest of the scientific community in this field has experimented a significant growth , since the analysis of the wmap data has reported several hints for departure from isotropy and gaussianity of the cmb temperature distribution .",
    "some of these works are the following .",
    "@xcite detected a gaussianity deviation with a genus - based statistic ; @xcite found a significant non - gaussian signature on the 1-year wmap data on the kurtosis of the spherical mexican hat ( smhw ) wavelet coefficients at scales of around 10 degrees , pointing out a very large _ cold spot _",
    "( cs ) on the southern hemisphere as a possible source for this non - gaussianity .",
    "a posterior analysis @xcite confirmed the anomalous nature of the cs by performing an area - based statistical analysis of the wavelet coefficients .",
    "this detection , as well as new ones , were confirmed by analyzing wmap with various wavelet bases and several statistical estimators @xcite .",
    "isotropy deviations were also reported in different manners : an anomalous alignment of the low multipoles of the cmb @xcite ; north - south asymmetries of the cmb fluctuations @xcite ; an anomalous variance value @xcite ; unexpected correlation among the cmb phases @xcite ; unbalanced distribution of the temperature extrema @xcite ; and anomalous alignment of cmb structures @xcite .",
    "all the previous analyses can be considered as _ blind approaches _ , since null tests were performed to probe the cmb compatibility with the isotropic and gaussian hypotheses .",
    "complementary to these works , the reader can also find in the literature several studies where _ targeted _ departures from gaussianity are explored , based on non - standard physical models . in particular ,",
    "several analyses have studied the wmap data compatibility with anisotropic universes : the bianchi vii@xmath3 model @xcite .",
    "recently , some works have proposed non - rotational invariant models like @xcite and @xcite ( exprored by * ? ? ? * in the context of wmap data ) .",
    "although these non - rotational invariant models are promising and provide us with anisotropic templates that could help to fix some anomalies in wmap data , more work is still needed to connect these anisotropic patterns of the cmb fluctuations to a satisfactory physical model describing the evolution of the anisotropic field @xcite .",
    "in addition to the previous analyses , several works have studied different hypotheses to explore the anomalous nature of the cs ; for instance @xcite explored the cs compatibility with different non - standard models , pointing out that an explanation in terms of a cosmic texture ( as proposed by * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is much more favored than other alternatives already discussed in the literature , like a very large void in the large scale structure of the universe or contamination , in the form of the sunyaev - zeldovich emission , due to a large and nearby galaxy cluster .",
    "however , the study of non - standard inflationary models is the problem that has attracted a larger attention .",
    "for instance , and for the wmap case , the non - linear coupling parameter f@xmath4 that describes the non - linear evolution of the inflationary potential ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) has been constrained by several groups : using the angular bispectrum @xcite ; applying the minkowski functionals @xcite ; and using different statistics based on wavelets @xcite .",
    "besides a claim for f@xmath5 0 with a probability greater than 95% @xcite , there is a general consensus on the wmap compatibility with the predictions made by the standard inflationary scenario at least at 95% confidence level .",
    "the current best limits @xcite are : @xmath6 at 95% cl .",
    "the present paper is related to _ non - blind _ or _ targeted _ probes for gaussianity deviations , and , more specifically , it addresses two common topics arose in these kind of studies : the definition of an optimal estimator for the non - standard model ( and , therefore , the optimal estimation of the parameters that define such a model ) and the complementary issue of model selection .",
    "the former aspect is , usually , quite complex , since , for many physical models and realistic observational limitations ( e.g. incomplete sky coverage ) there is not a trivial solution and , therefore , non - optimal estimators are usually proposed ( which are posteriorly characterized by simulations ) .",
    "the latter issue on model selection is equally complex , since , generally , relies on heuristic principles .",
    "some authors adopt a fully bayesian view , whereas others adopt asymptotic measurements for the distance between two hypothesis , and others prefer to rely on the information that can be obtained from the likelihood itself . in this work",
    "we propose to study a non - gaussian model for the cmb that is a local non - linear expansion of the temperature fluctuations . for this model that , at large scales ,",
    "is considered by some authors as an approximation to the non - linear coupling parameter f@xmath4 we are able to build the exact likelihood on pixel space .",
    "to work in pixel space allows one to include easily non - ideal observational conditions , like incomplete sky coverage and anisotropic noise .",
    "we show how , from this likelihood , it is straightforward to obtain an analytical expression for the optimal estimator for the non - gaussian term .",
    "in addition , we also explore different model selection criteria , like the akaike information criterion @xcite , the bayesian information criterion @xcite , the minimum description length @xcite , the bayesian evidence , and the generalized likelihood ratio test .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : model ]",
    "we describe the physical model based on the local expansion of the cmb fluctuations and derive the full posterior probability . in section  [ sec : statistics ] we address the issue of the parameter estimation ( [ subsec : estimation ] ) and model selection ( [ subsec : selection ] ) .",
    "the methodology is explored on wmap - like simulations in section  [ sec : simulations ] and it is applied to wmap 5-year data in section  [ sec : wmap ] . finally , conclusions are given in section  [ sec : final ] .",
    "current observations indicate that cmb temperature fluctuations can be well described by random gaussian fluctuations , as predicted by the standard inflationary scenario . however ,",
    "as it was discussed in the introduction , these observations still allow for a small departure from the gaussian distribution , which could reflect the role played by physical processes described by non - standard models for the structure formation .    in this paper , we will focus on a parametric non - gaussian model , that accounts for a small and local ( i.e. point - to - point ) perturbation of the cmb temperature fluctuations , around its intrinsic gaussian distribution : @xmath7 + b\\left({\\delta t}_i\\right)_g^3.\\ ] ] @xmath8 ( _ the linear term _ ) is the gaussian part , whose n - point probability density function ( n - pdf ) can be easily described in terms of the standard inflationary model .",
    "the second and third terms on the right - hand side are _ the quadratic _ and _ cubic perturbation terms _ , respectively . their corresponding contribution to the observed cmb fluctuations ( @xmath9 ) is governed by the @xmath10 and @xmath11 parameters .",
    "subindex @xmath12 refers to the direction corresponding to a certain pixelization on the sphere , and the operator @xmath13 averages over all the pixels defining the sky coverage . notice that the previous expression does not include instrumental noise .",
    "we have adopted this simplification , since we aim to focus the work on large - scale cmb data sets ( @xmath14 ) , where ( as it is the case for wmap ) , the contribution from noise is typically negligible .",
    "let us point out that the particular situation for @xmath15 defaults into a well known case that has been already addressed in the literature ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "it describes a local approximation to the weak non - linear coupling inflationary model ( e .. g * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) at scales larger than the horizon scale at the recombination time ( i.e. above the degree scale ) .",
    "in this context , the @xmath10 factor is usally related to the non - linear coupling parameter f@xmath4 by : @xmath16 where @xmath17 mk is the cmb temperature , and we follow the sign convention in @xcite for the relation between the temperature fluctuations and the gravitational potential at the sachs - wolfe regime .",
    "let us remark that , of course , this model do not pretend to incorporate all the gravitational ( like lensing ) and non - gravitational effects , due to the evolution of the initial quadratic potential model .",
    "indeed , the reason to select the specific model given by equation  [ eq : physical_model ] is twofold .",
    "one the one hand , it is an useful parametrization for describing a small departure from gaussianity , that allows us to present a new methodology . on the other hand , it is a model previously addressed by other authors ( using other estimators ) , and , therefore , it is easier to make a straightforward comparison among the results .    for simplicity ,",
    "let us transform the gaussian part @xmath8 into a zero mean and unity variance random variable @xmath18 , hence , equation  [ eq : physical_model ] can be rewritten as : @xmath19 where : @xmath20 and @xmath21 is the rms of the cmb fluctuations .",
    "let us remark that , since the proposed non - gaussian model is a perturbation of the standard gaussian one , the non - linear parameters have to satisfy : @xmath22 it is straightforward to show that the normalized gaussian field @xmath23 satisfies : @xmath24 where @xmath25 represents the normalized correlation between pixels @xmath12 and @xmath26 .",
    "the n - pdf of the @xmath27 random field ( where @xmath28 refers to the number of pixels on the sphere that are observed ) is given by a multivariate gaussian : @xmath29 where @xmath30 denotes the correlation matrix and operator @xmath31 denotes standard matrix / vector transpose .",
    "our goal is to compute the n - pdf associated to the non - gaussian @xmath32 field , as a function of the non - linear coupling parameters based on the full n - pdf for the underlaying gaussian signal @xmath33 .",
    "hence , let us make first the inversion of equation  [ eq : model ] to find the expression of @xmath18 as a function of @xmath34 : @xmath35 + o(3).\\ ] ] obviously , since previous equation is a local transformation , the jacobian matrix is diagonal and , therefore , the jacobian ( @xmath36 ) is given by : @xmath37 } = \\prod_i \\left ( \\frac{\\partial \\phi_i}{\\partial x_i}\\right).\\ ] ] it is more convenient to work with the log - jacobian ( @xmath38 ) , which , taking into account equation [ eq : inversmodel ] and expanding the log function up to second order , is given by : @xmath39 + 0(3 ) \\nonumber.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] now , taking into account equation  [ eq : model ] and recalling that @xmath33 is a gaussian field , it is straightforward to prove that the data @xmath40 satisfy : @xmath41 and @xmath42 . therefore , the log - jacobian is given by : @xmath43 finally , it is easy to calculate @xmath44 , the n - point pdf of @xmath40 given the @xmath45 parameter : @xmath46 where the probability @xmath47 is given by : @xmath48 i.e. , it is the n - point gaussian pdf ( i.e. @xmath49 , and the log - likelihood @xmath50 reads as : @xmath51.\\ ] ] it is easy to show that @xmath52 is given by : @xmath53,\\ ] ] where the functions @xmath54 and @xmath55 are given by : @xmath56^{t},\\ ] ] and @xmath57 being @xmath58 the unity vector of dimension @xmath28 and @xmath59^{t } + \\frac{1}{2}\\left[\\bmath{x}^2-\\mathbb{i}\\right]\\bmath{\\xi}^{-1}\\left[\\bmath{x}^2-\\mathbb{i}\\right]^{t } \\right\\}\\ ] ] and @xmath60 let us remark that @xmath54 and @xmath55 could be seen as a kind of generalized third - order and fourth - order moments , respectively ( or , equivalently , in terms of the spherical harmonic coefficients , to the bispectrum and the trispectrum ) . as an example , for the particular case of uncorrelated data ( i.e. , @xmath61 ) , it is straightforward to show that @xmath62 and @xmath63 , with @xmath64 .",
    "the n - pdf @xmath65 given by equation  [ eq : pdfx ] contains all the required information , on the one hand , to estimate the non - linear coupling parameter @xmath45 and , on the other hand , to perform a model selection ( gaussian vs. non - gaussian ) .",
    "these two aspects will be studied in next section .",
    "notice that the parameter @xmath66 ( or , equivalently , @xmath11 ) can not be estimated in this framework : it just appears as an arbitrary constant in the definition of q ( equation  [ eq : q ] ) : it just controls the relevance of @xmath67 in @xmath55 .",
    "if one were interested in obtaining a posterior probability of the data @xmath40 given both non - linear parameters ( @xmath45 and @xmath66 ) , then it would be necessary to expand the local non - gaussian model beyond @xmath68 .",
    "however , we would always find an expression in which the non - linear parameter controlling the highest order in the expansion , acts as an arbitrary constant .",
    "for that reason , we keep terms up to @xmath68 .",
    "there is a discussion within the field  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) about to what extend the cubic term in the description of the weak non - linear coupling inflationary model ( for which , we recall , the local non - gaussian model in equation  [ eq : physical_model ] can be seen as an approximation at large scales ) is really negligible or not with respect to the quadratic contribution .",
    "for the former scenario ( negligibility of the cubic term ) , the particular value of @xmath66 becomes an irrelevant issue since , naturally , one will have that @xmath69 ( of course , @xmath66 should always satisfy the condition given in equation  [ eq : condition ] ) . however , for the latter case different results could be obtained , depending on the specific value for @xmath66 . in the following",
    ", we will discuss parameter estimation and model selection assuming @xmath70 in equation  [ eq : q ] .",
    "however , we will explore ( analyzing wmap data and simulations ) whether the condition @xmath69 is naturally satisfied or not .",
    "in this section we aim to address two aspects very much linked one to the other : the estimation of the parameter defining the local non - gaussian model ( @xmath45 , section  [ subsec : estimation ] ) and the computation of some heuristic rules to decide whether a given data set is better described by the local non - gaussian model rather than by the standard gaussian one ( section  [ subsec : selection ] ) .",
    "the description of the full n - pdf for the non - gaussian model proposed in section  [ sec : model ] allows one to obtain an optimal estimation of the non - linear coupling parameter @xmath45 .",
    "let us recall that an _ optimal estimation _ of the @xmath45 parameter is possible , since it would be derived from the full pdf for the non - gaussian model , @xmath65 . in other words , we could obtain an unbiased and minimum variance estimator .",
    "this is possible , precisely , for the specific selection of the local non - gaussian model in equation  [ eq : model ] : for other physical non - gaussian models it is not always trivial to obtain a full description of the posterior probability of the data given the parameters ( at least , under realistic observational conditions like incomplete sky coverage ) and shortcuts have to be taken by defining _ pseudo - optimal _ estimators that are , afterwards , validated with simulations .",
    "we shall define the optimal estimator for the non - linear parameter as the value , @xmath71 , that maximizes the probability of @xmath40 given @xmath45 . from equation  [ eq : pdfx ] ,",
    "it is obvious that maximizing this probability is equivalent to maximize @xmath72 in equation  [ eq : loglike ] . by derivation one",
    "obtains : @xmath73 we can also estimate the error associated to @xmath71 from the fisher matrix @xmath74 : @xmath75 notice that the error on the estimation of the parameter @xmath45 is constant , up to the order considered in equation  [ eq : model ] .      within the bayesian framework we can include any _ a priori _ information that we might have in relation to the @xmath45 parameter . in particular , following bayes theorem , the probability of @xmath45 given the data @xmath40 read as : @xmath76 where @xmath77 is the _ prior _ probability function for the parameter @xmath45 .",
    "of course , for the case of the local non - gaussian model proposed in this work , there is not a clear physical motivation to choose a particular prior .",
    "let us however explore , as an exercise , two simple scenarios , which could be useful for more general purposes .",
    "we consider first a _ uniform prior _ given by : @xmath78 \\\\ \\\\ 0 & { \\rm otherwise } \\\\",

    "for this particular case , it is trivial to show that the bayesian estimation for the non - linear coupling parameter ( @xmath81 ) is equivalent to the one obtained via the maximum - likelihood estimation ( i.e , @xmath82 ) if @xmath83 $ ] .",
    "the second case we want to address corresponds to a gaussian prior @xmath84 , described by a most probable value @xmath85 and a dispersion @xmath86 : @xmath87 by deriving the posterior probability , it is trivial to obtain the bayesian estimation for the non - linear coupling parameter ( @xmath81 ) : @xmath88 for the particular case of @xmath89 , i.e. a very strong prior for @xmath45 , peaked around @xmath85 , one trivially obtain @xmath90 , that is , the prior dominates bayesian estimation , leading to a most probable value for @xmath45 equal to the maximum value for the prior .",
    "also trivially one finds that , for a non - informative scenario ( i.e. , @xmath91 ) , @xmath92 .      in this subsection we aim to calculate",
    "under which conditions ( according to different model selection criteria ) a given observation @xmath40 is better described by a local non - gaussian model as the one described by equation  [ eq : model ] with @xmath93 ( hereinafter @xmath94 ) rather than by a gaussian random field described just in term of the n - point correlation function @xmath30 ( hereinafter @xmath95 ) .",
    "some of the model selection approaches investigated in this paper have been previously applied to different astronomical / cosmological problems for instance ,  @xcite applied the akaike and the bayesian information criteria ( aic and bic , recpectively ) to study whether astronomical data sets favored simplest models for the accelerating universe against more complex ones .",
    "this issue was also addressed by  @xcite by analyzing the essence supernova survey data , and appliying bayesian evidence ( be ) in addition to the aic and the bic approaches , to study .",
    "these three model selection criteria ( aic , bic and be ) were also applied to study the impact of non - standard physical models on the friedmann equations  @xcite .",
    "@xcite used the aic and the bic techniques to study , on the one hand , whether wmap 1-year data preferred a spatially flat cosmology versus a closed one , and , on the other hand the significance of the running spectral index detected on this wmap data release . in a posterior work",
    "@xcite , be was added to the aic and the bic approaches to study the suitability of different cosmological models to the wmap 3-year data .",
    "bayesian evidence ( be ) is , probably , the model selection criterion that has attracted a greater interest from cosmologists during the past years .",
    "in addition to the works mentioned above ( where it was compared with other model selection criteria ) , it has been also applied to several problems where competing cosmological models were explored .",
    "some of these applications are the following :  @xcite followed a be approach to study cosmological models with different matter power spectra and dark energy evolution models ;  @xcite studied different dark energy evolving scenarios ;  @xcite performed a model selection on the matter power spectrum from the be analysis of the wmap ;  @xcite followed a similar approach for analyzing the wmap compatibility with anisotropic bianchi vii@xmath3 models ;  @xcite used it to decide whether the wmap cold spot was compatible or not with predictions from non - standard models like the cosmological defects ;  @xcite studied the planck ability to discriminate between several re - ionization models ; the be criterion was also applied  @xcite to the problem of compact source detection on microwave data ; and more recently ,  @xcite investigated different properties of the constrained minimal supersymmetric model ( msugra ) , using wmap data .      the akaike information criterion ( aic , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) provides with a selection index to decide among competing hypothesis , being the model associated to the lowest index the most favored one .",

    "therefore , according to the aic , the decision rule reads as : @xmath102      this asymptotic bayesian criterion introduced by @xcite is prior independent .",

    "[ fig : fnl_sims ] we present the @xmath71 distributions obtained from the analysis of local non - gaussian simulations . from left to right and from top to bottom , the panels show the cases : @xmath45 = 0 , 0.001 , 0.002 , 0.003 , 0.004 , 0.005 , 0.010 , 0.015 , 0.020 , 0.025 , 0.030 and 0.035 .",
    "notice that , as expected , the parameter estimation is unbiased for _ reasonable _ values of the @xmath45 parameter : all the distributions are peaked around the value of @xmath45 used to generate the simulations . only for @xmath142 ( or , equivalently , f@xmath143 ) a bias starts to appear .",
    "this effect comes from the fact that these values of @xmath45 are not small enough to assure a local non - gaussian model as the one described by equation  [ eq : model ] , i.e. , a non - gaussian model that is a local perturbation of the underlaying cmb gaussian signal .",
    "also as expected ( see equation  [ eq : error_epsilon ] ) , the width of these distributions does not depend on the particular value of @xmath45 , if , once more , @xmath45 is small enough to assure a proper expansion for the local non - gaussian model . in this regime",
    ", we obtain , on average , @xmath144 , or , equivalently , @xmath145 . again , for @xmath142 the width of the distributions starts to be slightly smaller , indicating an inadequate value of the non - linear parameter . these two effects ( bias of the maximum - likelihood parameter estimation and dependence on the error on the parameter estimation ) provide a natural range ( at least for a pixel resolution of @xmath134 ) where the non - linear parameter is allowed to take values : @xmath146 $ ] .",
    "this allowed range for @xmath45 can be seen as a _ natural prior _",
    "@xmath147 , that could be used for performing a parameter estimation within a bayesian framework .",
    "obviously ( as discussed in subsection  [ subsubsec : bayes ] ) , the bayesian estimation made with this uniform prior produces the same estimations for @xmath45 already reported from the maximum - likelihood .    finally , we have also investigated whether the value of @xmath67 in equation  [ eq : q ] is negligible as compared to @xmath148 , which , as discussed in section  [ sec : model ] , would lead to a situation where the choice of a particular value for the non - linear parameter @xmath66 becomes an irrelevant problem .",
    "we found that , actually , this is not the case : on average , @xmath149 .",
    "this implies that , first , different values of @xmath66 could provide different results , not only to the ones presented in this work , but also for other works in the literature ( where , we recall , it is assumed @xmath70 ) . in particular , it is trivial to show that , values of @xmath150 would affect the determination of the coupling parameter @xmath45 in @xmath151 .",
    "second , as it has been discussed by some authors  @xcite , it would indicate that , for the weak non - linear coupling inflationary model , the role played by cubic terms could be non negligible as compared to quadratic contributions , since , to some extent , they will contribute to the full trispectrum ( as one can notice from equation  [ eq : q ] , where @xmath66 governs the role played by @xmath67 ) .",
    "this results could be important when describing more complete non - local non - guassian model , since it would indicate the need of including physical effects up to third order .",
    "we discuss which is the performance of the different model selection criteria presented in subsection  [ subsec : selection ] . for the particular case of",
    "be , we assume the natural prior @xmath147 found in the previous subsection : @xmath146 $ ] .",
    "as for the case of the parameter estimation previously discussed , we have considered a set of local non - gaussian models given by different values of the non - linear parameter .",
    "we present the results , graphically , in figure  [ fig : selection_sims ] .",
    "this plot consist in 6 rows and 5 columns .",
    "each row corresponds to the results obtained for a given value of the @xmath45 parameter ( namely , from top to bottom : @xmath45 = 0 , 0.005 , 0.010 , 0.015 , 0.020 and 0.025 ) .",
    "each column refers to a model selection criterion ( from left ro right : aic , bic , mdl , be and glrt ) .",
    "for the first column ( i.e. , the aic case ) we plot the distributions ( obtained after analysing 1,000 simulations ) of a statistical variable defined as : @xmath152 , notice ( from equation  [ eq : aic_rule ] ) that a positve value of @xmath153 implies to accept @xmath94 against @xmath95 . the second column accounts for the distributions of the variable @xmath154 , which ( from equation  [ eq : bic_rule ] ) also satisfies to be positive when favoring @xmath94",
    "equivalently , third column shows the distributions of @xmath155 , that according to equation  [ eq : mdl_rule ] is also positive when @xmath94 is more likely than @xmath95 .",
    "fourth column provides @xmath156 , obtained from equation  [ eq : b10_uniform ] .",
    "finally , in the fifth column we present the distributions obtained for @xmath157 which , according to the glrt decision rule ( equation  [ eq : glrt_rule ] ) provides a measurement of the strength in accepting @xmath94 against @xmath95 .    in addition to the distributions , we also plot , as an indication , a vertical line in each panel . for @xmath153 , @xmath158 and @xmath159 , this vertical line separate the region where",
    "@xmath95 is favored ( left side ) from the one where @xmath94 is more likely ( right side ) .",
    "the percentage of the 1,000 simulations that fall on the @xmath94 region is also reported at each panel .",
    "the vertical line for the @xmath160 statistic represents the limit for which the logarithmic bayes factor ( @xmath156 ) is greater than 1 , which , in terms of the jeffreys rule , indicates that @xmath94 is , at least , mildly favored against @xmath95 .",
    "we also provide the percentage of the simulations satisfying this condition .",
    "finally , the vertical line for the @xmath161 statistic indicates the value of @xmath115 for which @xmath162 of the 1,000 simulations favor @xmath94 instead of @xmath95 .",
    "this value of @xmath115 is also written in the panels .",
    "notice that , among the asymptotic model selection criteria ( aic , bic and mdl ) , aic offers a less restrictive criterion than bic , whereas bic behaves similarly with respect to mdl , the figure also shows that be provides a more conservative criterion than the asymptotic methods .",
    "we have applied the statistical approaches described in section  [ sec : statistics ] to wmap 5-year data . in particular , we have analyzed a co - added cmb map generated from the global noise - weighted linear combination of the reduced foreground maps for the q1 , q2 , v1 , v2 , w1 , w2 , w3 and w4 difference assemblies  ( see * ? ? ? * for details ) .",
    "weights are normalized to unity and , for each map , they are proportional to the inverse average noise variance across the sky",
    ". this operation is made at = 512 healpix resolution , being degraded afterwards down to = 32 .",
    "hence , we are in the same conditions as for the analysis on simulations described in the previous section and , therefore , the cmb cross - correlation in wmap data is given by the @xmath30 correlation matrix already defined in section  [ sec : simulations ] .",
    "the estimated full n - pdf of the wmap 5-year data given the non - linear parameter @xmath45 is showed in figure  [ fig : data_posterior ] ( indeed , it is given in terms of the most common f@xmath140 parameter for allowing a better comparison with previous works ) .",
    "maximum - likelihood estimation ( equation  [ eq : est_loglike ] ) provides @xmath163 with an error for the parameter ( equation  [ eq : error_epsilon ] ) of @xmath164 ( compatible with the values obtained from simulations ) .",
    "hence our wmap 5-year data analysis reports : @xmath165 at 95% cl ( or , equivalently , @xmath166 at 95% ) .",
    "this result is compatible with similar works in the literature reporting wmap compatibility with gaussian hypothesis . however , let us remark that this estimation is more efficient than previous ones at similar angular resolution , since it provides a smaller error bar .",
    "for instance , @xcite performed a gaussianity test on the wmap data , at the same healpix resolution , although in a smaller region of the sky ( 16% instead of the 69% considered in this work ) .",
    "their f@xmath140 estimator was based on the three minkowski functionals , providing an error bar of @xmath167 .",
    "the expected @xmath168 provided by our maximum - likelihood estimator for a similar observed region would be @xmath169 , i.e. , @xmath170 smaller than the one obtained by the minkowski functionals .",
    "this result was expected since , as it was already discussed , the maximum - likelihood estimation of the non - linear parameter is _ optimal _ , given the local non - gaussian model in equation  [ eq : physical_model ] .",
    "this curve represent the probability given in equation  [ eq : pdfx ] , i.e. the full pdf of the wmap 5-year data @xmath40 given the non - linear parameter @xmath45 ( or , equivalently , f@xmath171 .",
    "vertical dotted line marks the maximum - likelihood estimation @xmath163.,width=302 ]    as it has been mentioned above , this result shows wmap data compatibility with the gaussian hypothesis , since f@xmath172 can not be rejected at any significant confidence level .",
    "of course , same conclusions are obtained from the model selection criteria described in subsection  [ subsec : selection ] .",
    "neither aic , bic , mdl nor be criteria select @xmath94 against @xmath95 , whereas glrt would favor @xmath94 under the very weak condition for @xmath115 in equation  [ eq : glrt_rule ] of @xmath173 ( which implies a likelihood ratio of @xmath174 )    finally , let us remark that , as it also happened for the simulations analyzed in section  [ sec : simulations ] , the contribution of the @xmath67 term to the value of @xmath55 ( see equation  [ eq : q ] ) is not negligible , in particular , @xmath175 .",
    "this indicates that , as it was already mentioned , the cubic term in the model given by equation  [ eq : model ] is not _ naturally _ negligible as compared to the quadratic term and , therefore , @xmath66 should be chosen small enough ( like the case @xmath70 considered in this work ) .",
    "we have presented a parametric non - gaussian model for the cmb temperature fluctuations .",
    "the non - gaussian model is a local perturbation ( up to third order ) of the standard cmb gaussian field which recovers ( for the case of @xmath176 in equation  [ eq : physical_model ] ) an approximative form of the weak non - linear coupling inflationary model ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) at scales larger than the horizon scale at the recombination time ( i.e. above the degree scale ) . for this model",
    ", we are able to build the posterior probability of the data given the non - linear parameter @xmath45 ( see equation  [ eq : model ] ) , from which , in principle , an _ optimal estimator _",
    "( i.e. , unbiased and with minimum variance ) can be derived .",
    "analytical expressions for the maximum - likelihood estimation of the non - linear parameter ( @xmath71 ) and its associated error ( @xmath128 ) are derived .",
    "in addition , we also discuss an alternative bayesian estimation ( in terms of the posterior probability of the non - linear parameter ) , for the hypothetical case in which we might have some prior information for @xmath45 . as an example",
    ", two cases are addressed : a non - informative ( i.e , uniform ) and a gaussian priors .",
    "we also investigate an issue very much linked to the parameter estimation : the model selection .",
    "indeed , we discuss several well known techniques to perform hypotheses test , like the akaike information criterion  ( aic , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the bayesian information criterion  ( bic , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the minimum description length  ( mdl , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the generalized likelihood ratio test ( glrt ) and the bayesian evidence ( be ) .",
    "we derive analytical expressions , for the particular local non - gaussian model proposed in this work , for all these model selection techniques .    the performance of both , parameter estimators and model selection criteria , are investigated by analyzing non - gaussian simulations , as they could be observed by wmap .",
    "we check that the maximum - likelihood estimation provides an unbiased and efficient estimation of the non - linear parameter defining the deviations from gaussianity .",
    "we find that , for the healpix resolution considered in this work ( = 32 ) , results are consistent up to a value of @xmath177 , which approximately corresponds ( at the sachs - wolfe regime ) to a value of the the non - linear coupling parameter f@xmath178 .",
    "this parameter is the one commonly used to described the weak non - linear coupling inflationary model ( e .. g * ? ? ?",
    "we also find that , among the model selection criteria , aic is the asymptotic method that provides the less restrictive decision rule , whereas , on the other hand , mdl is the most strict one .",
    "we also find that be , for a uniform prior given by @xmath146 $ ] , is even more restrictive than mdl .",
    "the proposed methodology is applied to wmap 5-year data .",
    "we obtain a value for the non - linear coupling parameter of @xmath165 at 95% cl .",
    "this result provides a more efficient estimation than previous works in the literature , at the same angular scales .",
    "for instance , comparing with the work by @xcite using minkowski functionals , we can infer that the maximum - likelihood error bar is @xmath170 smaller than the one obtained with those geometrical estimators .",
    "application of model selection criteria to wmap data confirms that standard hypothesis of gaussianity is favored against the alternative hypothesis of non - gaussianity , for the specific local model proposed in this work , and for the adopted resolution of @xmath134 .",
    "finally , we would like to comment that , currently , we are extending the technique based on the n - pdf presented in this work , to deal with a more realistic non - local non - gaussian model , where higher resolution cmb data are considered , including as well the effect of anisotropic noise .",
