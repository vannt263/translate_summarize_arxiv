    "we consider a scalar field satisfying the helmholtz equation with frequency @xmath1 in @xmath2 . given a prescribed incident field @xmath3 , a non - singular solution of @xmath4 we are interested in the solution @xmath5 of @xmath6 where , for @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and @xmath9 equals @xmath10 inside the inhomogeneity and @xmath11 outside .",
    "we take the inhomogeneity to be a ball of radius @xmath0 .",
    "the coordinate system is chosen so that the inhomogeneity is centered at the origin . in other words",
    "@xmath12 we assume that both @xmath11 and @xmath10 are real and positive .",
    "we assume that the scattered field satisfies the classical silver - mller @xcite outgoing radiation condition , given by @xmath13 where , as usual @xmath14 .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to provide sharp estimates for the scattered field @xmath15 , for any contrast @xmath16 and any frequency @xmath17 .",
    "the norms we use to describe the scattered field are the following . given any @xmath18 , its restriction to the circle @xmath19",
    "can be decomposed in terms of the spherical harmonics given by , in the following way @xmath20 and @xmath21 can be measured in terms of the following sobolev norm @xmath22 for any real parameter @xmath23 . by density , this norm can be defined for less regular functions . for radius",
    "independent estimates , we shall use the norm @xmath24 it is easy to see that this norm is finite for a smooth @xmath25 with bounded radial variations . for a radial function , this is simply the sup norm for @xmath25 .",
    "finally , to document the sharpness of our estimates , we will provide lower bounds in terms of the semi - norms @xmath26 where @xmath27 are integers and @xmath28 is a real parameter .",
    "these norms are satisfy the following inequality @xmath29 and if for all @xmath30 , @xmath31 only has one non zero spherical harmonic coefficient , @xmath32    they are the natural extension of the norms introduced in @xcite for the two dimensional companion problem . when the incident field is a plane wave , @xmath33 where @xmath34 is a unit vector in @xmath2 , for all @xmath35 , @xmath36 whereas for any @xmath37 and @xmath28 , @xmath38 where @xmath39 for all @xmath40 and @xmath10 ( see ) .",
    "the motivation from this work comes from imaging . in electrostatics ,",
    "the small volume asymptotic expansion for a diametrically bounded conductivity inclusion is now well established , and the first order expansion has been shown to be valid for any contrast @xcite . it is natural to ask whether such expansions could also hold for non - zero frequencies , even in a simple case .",
    "another inspiration for this work is recent results concerning the so - called cloaking - by - mapping method for the helmholtz equation . in @xcite ,",
    "the authors show that cloaks can be constructed using lossy layers , and that non - lossy media could not be made invisible to some particular frequencies ( the quasi - resonant frequencies ) . within the range of non - lossy media , one can ask whether such ` cloak busting ' frequencies are a significant phenomenon , that is , would appear with non - zero probability in any large frequency set , or on the contrary if they are contained in a set whose measure tends to zero with @xmath0 .",
    "these questions were considered in two dimensions in @xcite . in this paper",
    "we show that these results extend , after some adjustments , to the three dimensional case .",
    "the proofs presented in this paper are very similar to the ones of the two - dimensional paper , but we believe the results , more than their derivation , could be of interest to researchers in various areas of mathematics . in numerical analysis",
    "they could be used as a validation test for broadband helmholtz solvers , since we provide both upper and lower bounds for the scattering data . in the area of small volume expansion for arbitrary geometries , or in the mathematical developments related to cloaking , they provide a best case scenario which can be used to document the sharpness of more general estimates .    to make the results of this paper accessible to readers who are not familiar with bessel functions ,",
    "the main estimates are written in terms of the norms @xmath41 and @xmath42 introduced above , and powers of @xmath43 . because no unknown constant @xmath44 appears in the results , this paper can be used as a black - box if the reader wishes to do so .",
    "bessel functions do appear in one place , to describe quasi - resonances , but they turn out to be of the same nature as the two - dimensional ones , and so we refer to @xcite in that case .    the main results of the paper are presented in section  [ sec : main ] . the proofs are given in section  [ sec : proofs ] .",
    "to state our results , we introduce the rescaled non - dimensional frequency @xmath45 , and the contrast factor @xmath46 given by @xmath47    the following theorem provides our estimates for either small frequencies or for any frequency .",

    "furthermore , for any @xmath48 , when @xmath49 , the scattered field @xmath15 also satisfies @xmath56 when @xmath57 there holds @xmath58    naturally , the variant of incorporating the more precise estimate given by for the fourier coefficient corresponding to @xmath59 also holds by linearity .",
