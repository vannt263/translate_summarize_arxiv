    "the kochen - specker ( ks ) theorem states that there exist no valuations on the set of self - adjoint operators on a hilbert space  of dimension greater than two .",
    "valuations @xmath1 are required to respect the functional relationships between the operators , so if @xmath2 , then @xmath3 in particular this implies that for a projection operator @xmath4 , @xmath5 or @xmath6 .",
    "this requirement is usually referred to as the functional composition principle , or @xmath7 .",
    "many proofs of the ks theorem are written in terms of ` colouring ' rays in a hilbert space of fixed dimension , assigning values @xmath8 or @xmath9 to collections of rays in a @xmath10-dimensional hilbert space , subject to the condition that the sum of the values of @xmath10 orthogonal rays is one .",
    "this is equivalent to assigning values to the projection operators onto those rays subject to the condition @xmath7 above .    since kochen and specker s original collection of 137 rays in three dimensions @xcite which is not ` colourable ' in this way ,",
    "many smaller sets of rays have been discovered ( see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "it is perhaps hard to see whether these sets are related , and why it is , for example , that there exist non - colourable sets of rays in four dimensions which are smaller than those for three dimensions .",
    "the observation in @xcite that the kochen - specker theorem may be written in terms of the non - existence of global elements of a certain presheaf provides a new way of looking at these proofs , and shows new relationships between them .    in this paper",
    "i will briefly review the statement of the ks theorem in presheaf - theoretic terms before showing how this approach brings out a different structure , based on the relationships between operators ( or their spectral algebras ) rather than rays , and how this structure may be seen in existing proofs of the theorem .",
    "the ks theorem may be seen as the statement that there exist obstructions to the construction of global elements of a particular varying set over the partially ordered set @xmath0  of boolean subalgebras of projection operators on a hilbert space of dimension greater than two .",
    "the obstructions arise over ( collections of ) ` loops ' of algebras in @xmath0 .",
    "we show that for a hilbert space of three dimensions , these loops necessarily contain ten algebras , but that this number may be reduced for higher - dimensional hilbert spaces .",
    "in @xcite it was shown that the kochen - specker theorem can be stated as the fact that the dual presheaf over the category @xmath0  of boolean subalgebras of projection operators on a hilbert space @xmath11has no global elements . in this section ,",
    "we describe this construction for the case of a finite - dimensional hilbert space .",
    "we begin with the set @xmath0  of boolean subalgebras of projection operators on .",
    "this forms a partially ordered set by subalgebra inclusion .",
    "if @xmath12 , we write the inclusion map as @xmath13 .",
    "forms a category with objects being boolean subalgebras and morphisms being + inclusion maps . ]",
    "a _ varying set _",
    "@xmath14 over the partially ordered set @xmath0  is an assignment of a set @xmath15 to each @xmath16 , and an assignment to each inclusion map @xmath13 of a map @xmath17 between the sets associated with @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "if @xmath20 , we require that @xmath21 .",
    "this structure is also known as a presheaf over the _ base category _ @xmath0",

    "a _ global element",
    "_ @xmath23 of the varying set @xmath14 is analogous to a global section of a bundle ; it is a function which assigns to each @xmath24 in @xmath0  an element @xmath25 , with the property that the elements match up under the action of the varying set maps , so for @xmath26 , we have that @xmath27    the varying set @xmath28 over @xmath0  was introduced in @xcite .",
    "it is defined as follows :    1 .   on elements of @xmath0 : @xmath29 is the _ dual _ of @xmath24 ; thus it is the set @xmath30 of all homomorphisms from the boolean algebra @xmath24 to the boolean algebra @xmath31 .",
    "2 .   on inclusion maps : if @xmath32 then @xmath33 is defined by @xmath34 where @xmath35 denotes the restriction of @xmath36 to the subalgebra @xmath37 .    a global element of this varying set ,",
    "if it existed , would then be a function @xmath38 that associates to each @xmath39 an element @xmath40 of the dual of @xmath24 such that if @xmath41 then @xmath42    since each projection operator @xmath43 belongs to at least one boolean algebra , namely the algebra @xmath44 , and this is included in any larger algebra @xmath24 which also contains @xmath4 , a global element @xmath38 assigns a value @xmath45 to each projector , and this value ( either @xmath8 or @xmath9 ) is equal to @xmath46 for all boolean algebras @xmath24 containing @xmath4 .",
    "furthermore , if @xmath47 there exists an algebra @xmath48 containing both @xmath4 and @xmath49 , and since @xmath50 is a homomorphism , we have that @xmath51 and hence @xmath38 provides a valuation on projectors which respects the functional composition principle .",
    "the ks theorem may therefore be stated as the fact that , for a hilbert space of dimension greater than two , the varying set @xmath52 has no global elements .",
    "it is this type of valuation which is usually used in the construction of counterexamples to the kochen - specker theorem  sets of directions are given for which the associated projectors can not be assigned the values @xmath8 or @xmath9 in accordance with the above condition .",
    "these may be viewed as belonging to subsets of @xmath0  over which there is some obstruction to constructing a global element of @xmath28 .",
    "the statement of the ks theorem in this way , in terms of global elements , provides a new insight into its origin , and how it may be proved .",
    "we know that we can construct a _ partial element _ of @xmath28  over certain subsets of @xmath0  ( cf .",
    "discussion of partial valuations in @xcite , section 3.2 ) , but that these can not be extended over the whole of @xmath0  without violating the matching condition eq .",
    "( [ eqn : d - matching ] ) . we now proceed to identify possible obstructions to such a construction .    the simplest possible obstruction which could occur to the construction of a global element @xmath23 of a varying set @xmath53 over a partially ordered set @xmath54 is if there are four _ objects _",
    "@xmath55 such that @xmath56 and @xmath57 each have a map to both @xmath58 and @xmath59 , which we denote @xmath60 , @xmath61 , etc .",

    "( [ eqn : match ] ) to hold , @xmath68 must be in the inverse image @xmath69 of @xmath70 along the map @xmath71 , and also in the inverse image @xmath72 of @xmath73 .",
    "if @xmath74 , then this is clearly not possible ( as shown in figure [ fig:4obs ] ) . in that case , we know that there is no global element of @xmath53 with the chosen value @xmath75 at stage @xmath58 .",
    "if there is no value @xmath63 for which @xmath76 , then we have an obstruction , and the varying set @xmath53 has no global elements .    for most varying sets",
    ", such simple obstructions will not exist .",
    "more complicated obstructions will arise over larger collections of objects in the base category @xmath54 in the same basic way , namely that given an assignment of a value for the global element over one object in @xmath54 , there will be two ( or more ) incompatible restrictions on the possible values the global element may have for another object .",
    "we therefore expect obstructions to arise over sets of objects @xmath77 where each is connected to at least two others ( _ i.e. _ there are at least two relations in @xmath78 with each @xmath77 as their domain or codomain ) .    the simplest structures to look for are therefore ` loops ' of objects in the partially ordered set @xmath54 ; each object being connected to precisely two others .",
    "we can view eq .",
    "( [ eqn:2-loop ] ) as a loop of four objects . for",
    "the varying set @xmath52 over @xmath0 , loops containing just four boolean subalgebras will not suffice to produce obstructions .",
    "the loops needed will be larger , and many connected loops will generally be required to produce a complete obstruction .",
    "in the category @xmath79 of boolean subalgebras of a three - dimensional hilbert space @xmath80 , there are three types of boolean algebra , corresponding to operators with different degeneracies",
    ".    1 .   _ maximal algebras _ containing three projectors @xmath81 onto orthogonal 1-dimensional subspaces @xmath82 of @xmath80 .",
    "these will be denoted @xmath83 .",
    "degenerate algebras _ containing just one 1-dimensional projector @xmath84 .",
    "these will be denoted @xmath85 .",
    "3 .   the trivial algebra @xmath86 , included in all @xmath24 in @xmath0 .",
    "inclusion maps in @xmath79 ( other than identity maps ) have either the trivial algebra or a degenerate algebra as their domain .",
    "maps from the trivial algebra are of no use in constructing obstructions ; @xmath87 for any global or partial element @xmath38 .",
    "we will therefore only need to consider morphisms of the type @xmath88 .",
    "we can see straight away that there are no loops such as those in eq.([eqn:2-loop ] ) with just two maximal algebras , @xmath89 and two degenerate algebras @xmath90 both included in each maximal .",
    "this would require each degenerate algebra to contain a one - dimensional projector which is in each of the maximal algebras , with the result that either @xmath91 and @xmath92 have two projectors in common ( and hence must also share a third , and be equal ) , or @xmath93 , and so @xmath94 .",
    "in fact , for a three - dimensional hilbert space , there are also no loops with three or four maximal algebras . in a loop with four maximal algebras ,",
    "each must share a single projector with two other maximal algebras .",
    "the same projector must not be shared by any three maximal algebras , or else they will all be linked by a single degenerate algebra , and there would a reduced loop with fewer algebras .",
    "so the four maximal algebras contain 8 one - dimensional projectors , denoted @xmath95 .",
    "we use the letters @xmath96 to refer to the vectors in  corresponding to those projectors .",
    "the algebras are joined as follows : @xmath97    then since @xmath98 , we know that @xmath57 is a linear combination of @xmath59 and @xmath56 , @xmath99 for some @xmath100 .",
    "similarly , @xmath101 , and @xmath102 , so @xmath103 and @xmath104 for some @xmath105 .",
    "but we know that @xmath107 and @xmath108 are mutually orthogonal , so @xmath109 implies that @xmath110 , and hence either @xmath111 or @xmath112 , and it quickly follows that all of the maximal algebras are equal .",
    "therefore in a three - dimensional hilbert space , there are no loops in @xmath79 containing just four maximal algebras .",
    "although loops in @xmath79 with five maximal algebras do exist , a single such loop ( with ten associated vectors ) does not provide a complete obstruction ; partial elements over such loops certainly exist . to form a complete obstruction",
    ", several such loops must be joined together . to see how obstructions may be built up in this way",
    ", we will now look at the structures corresponding to some existing proofs of the ks theorem .    currently , most proofs in three dimensions consist of the construction of a set of rays in @xmath80 with the property that they can not each be assigned a value @xmath8 or @xmath9 subject to the constraint that the sum of values assigned to any orthogonal triple of rays is one .",
    "this is usually described in terms of ` colouring ' rays , green for zero and red for one . following terminology in @xcite such a set of vectors",
    "is called a _ totally non - colourable set _ , or tncs .",
    "one way to produce such a tncs is that used originally by kochen and specker , whereby a tncs are built up from sets with less predictive power .",
    "the starting point is a _ definite prediction set _",
    "( dps ) , which is a set of rays @xmath113 such that if a single particular ` input value ' is chosen for one ray , @xmath114 , there is another vector , @xmath115 , which is not orthogonal to @xmath114 , for which there can be only one possible value .    new dpss may be created by rotating each ray in the original set by the same fixed amount , preserving their orthogonality relations .",
    "one can then proceed to chain several such dpss together , with the predicted value of the first being used to constrain the ` input value ' of the second , and so on , until a structure is obtained where the final predicted value contradicts the initial input value .",
    "this results in a partially non - colourable set ( pncs ) ; there is no possible colouration consistent with the initial input value .",
    "such sets constitute state - dependent proofs of the ks theorem ",
    "if the system is in an eigenstate corresponding to the initial input value , a contradiction is seen to occur .",
    "a tncs can then be produced from pncss ; in three dimensions this would require three pncss , one to eliminate each possible valuation on an orthogonal triple of rays .",
    "clifton @xcite showed how a dps may also be used to directly give a proof of the need for values to be contextual .",
    "this involved also using some arguments based on the statistical predictions of quantum mechanics .",
    "the dpss used by clifton , cabello and garca - alcaine and kochen and specker may be easily shown to consist of vectors corresponding to the one dimensional projectors in certain algebras which form small collections of interlocking loops in @xmath79 .",
    "clifton uses a set of eight vectors @xmath116 consisting of two orthogonal triples , @xmath117 and @xmath118 plus two other vectors , each of which is orthogonal to one vector in each orthogonal triple .",
    "these vectors fit into seven algebras , as shown in figure ( [ fig:7dps ] ) .",
    "the eight diamonds represent degenerate algebras , those generated by projectors onto the above rays .",
    "they are labelled by the number of the appropriate vector from the above set .",
    "the squares represent maximal algebras , each containing three projectors onto one - dimensional rays , plus all meets and joins .",
    "these are labelled by the numbers of the appropriate vectors from the above set , the letters @xmath119 correspond to new rays not in the set used by clifton .",
    "however , since each new ray is orthogonal to two in clifton s set , a valuation on clifton s set will also completely determine the value of these new rays .",
    "figure ( [ fig:7dps ] ) is seen to form a dps in the following way .",
    "suppose we assign value one to the projectors onto the rays @xmath120 , and @xmath121 .",
    "@xmath122 then @xmath123 .",
    "this implies that @xmath124 through the application of eq .",
    "( [ eqn : pplusq ] ) in the top two maximal algebras in the diagram .",
    "similarly , @xmath125 implies that @xmath126 .    in algebra @xmath127",
    "we now have @xmath128 , which implies that @xmath129 , and similarly in algebra @xmath130 we can deduce that @xmath131 .",
    "this gives us a contradiction in algebra @xmath59  two orthogonal projectors @xmath132 and @xmath133 are both assigned the value @xmath9 .",
    "hence by _ reductio ad absurdum _ the value assignment in eq.[eqn : dpsinit ] is not possible , and we deduce that if @xmath134 , then we have the ` definite prediction ' that we must assign @xmath135 .      the construction above , figure ( [ fig:7dps ] ) , with seven maximal algebras forming two loops of five , with three algebras in both loops , is the smallest way to join two loops together . as has been shown , this leads to a dps where , if a certain 1-dimensional projector is assigned value 1 , another such must be assigned the value zero . in @xcite , cabello and garca - alcaine",
    "give three examples of dpss with a stronger predictive power , namely that if a certain 1-dimensional projector is assigned value one , then another 1-dimensional projector must also be assigned value one ( rather than zero , as in the clifton dps ) .",
    "the advantage of their construction is that chains of such dpss may be formed : a new dps is constructed by rotating all directions by a fixed amount so that the direction of the ray whose value is predicted by the first set becomes the direction for input value for the second .",
    "for the three - dimensional case , they give a set of ten vectors as follows : @xmath136 with @xmath137 , @xmath138 , and @xmath139 , @xmath140 and @xmath141 related by : @xmath142    cabello and garca - alcaine give a diagram showing the orthogonality relations of these vectors .",
    "they can also be represented as a diagram in @xmath0 , as shown in figure ( [ fig:9dps ] ) .",
    "the degenerate algebras are labelled by the number ( in the above list ) of the single direction onto which they contain a one - dimensional projector .",
    "the maximal algebras are labelled by the three directions they contain . as in the case of clifton s dps , some new directions @xmath143 are required , each orthogonal to two from the above set .",
    "this construction can be seen to contain the same structure as the dps due to clifton ( two loops of five maximal algebras with three in common  the right hand and outer loops ) , with an extra connection formed by the maximals containing the directions @xmath144 and @xmath145 .",
    "the prediction used by cabello and garca - alcaine in this set is that if the projector onto @xmath146 is assigned the value one , then the value assigned to @xmath147 must also be one .",
    "this can again be seen by assuming @xmath148 and following the implications round to reach a contradiction .",
    "cabello and garca - alcaine also identify two more dpss ( @xcite , appendix ) which correspond to the diagrams in @xmath0  shown in figure ( [ fig:2a3 ] ) .",
    "complete geometrical proofs of the kochen - specker theorem in three dimensions consist of large numbers of algebras , connected in an intricate way .",
    "as has been mentioned , this may be done by chaining together dpss such as those shown in the previous subsection .",
    "however , the number of rays can be reduced by considering sets of rays with more interconnections .",
    "for example , the proof by peres @xcite , a tncs with 33 rays , can be drawn as a diagram in @xmath0  with 40 maximal algebras . to do this ,",
    "24 more rays must be introduced , each of which is orthogonal to two others in the set of 33 , and each of which is only contained in one maximal algebra .",
    "the diagram produced in this way ( figure [ fig : big ] ) is large , having many interlinked loops of algebras , although as expected , loops containing just five maximal algebras may be identified within it .",
    "the threefold symmetry within the diagram comes from the fact that the set of rays used is invariant under interchange of any two axes  the central maximal algebra contains projectors onto the rays @xmath149 and @xmath150 .",
    "maximal algebras are shown as circles , degenerate algebras as solid black dots .",
    "[ fig : big ]",
    "in a four - dimensional hilbert space , there exist more types of boolean sub - algebras of @xmath152 , corresponding to operators with different degeneracies .",
    "in addition to the trivial algebra @xmath153 , we have    1",
    ".   _ maximal algebras _ containing four projectors onto orthogonal 1-dimensional subspaces of @xmath151 .",
    "2 - 1 - 1 degenerate algebras _ containing two 1-dimensional projectors @xmath154 . these correspond to operators with three eigenvalues ,",
    "one of which is degenerate ( associated with the two - dimensional eigenspace orthogonal to the @xmath58 and @xmath59 directions ) .",
    "3 .   _ 3 - 1 degenerate algebras _ generated by a single one - dimensional projector .",
    "2 - 2 degenerate algebras _ containing two ( orthogonal ) two - dimensional projectors , and no one - dimensional ones .",
    "this larger number of possible types of algebra results in more possible loops of algebras ; in particular , it is possible to form loops in four dimensions with less than the ten algebras needed in the three - dimensional case .",
    "the constructions required to show a contradiction of the ks theorem may be simpler , containing far fewer algebras than necessary for the three - dimensional case .      a dps in a three - dimensional hilbert space such as those shown in figs.([fig:9dps ] ) and",
    "( [ fig:2a3 ] ) , where an initial assignment of value one to a one - dimensional projector induces another such assignment to a non - orthogonal projector , can be easily generalised to four ( or more ) dimensions .",
    "the vectors involved in the construction of the old dps , say that in figure ( [ fig:9dps ] ) , are thought of as belonging to a three - dimensional subspace of @xmath151 , which may be chosen as that orthogonal to the vector @xmath155 .",
    "each algebra in figure ( [ fig:9dps ] ) is then extended by the addition of the projector @xmath49 onto the direction @xmath155 , plus the meets and joins of @xmath49 with the other projectors in the algebra .",
    "the result is that we may view the diagram in figure ( [ fig:9dps ] ) as a diagram of sub - algebras of a four - dimensional hilbert space , with squares once again corresponding to maximal algebras , and diamonds corresponding to 2 - 1 - 1 degenerate algebras .",
    "there should then also be an additional 3 - 1 degenerate algebra , @xmath156 , which , like the trivial algebra , is included in every other algebra in the diagram .",
    "the reasoning showing that the diagram is a dps still holds true ; we now have a dps in four dimensions .",
    "it is this extendibility of a dps which cabello and garca - alcaine use to provide a construction of a totally non - colourable set of rays in any hilbert space of finite dimension of three or greater .",
    "perhaps the simplest and most elegant proof of the ks theorem is the four - dimensional proof produced by peres @xcite and mermin @xcite .",
    "mermin gives a collection of nine operators in @xmath151 of the form @xmath157 , where @xmath158 and @xmath159 are either pauli matrices or the ( two - dimensional ) identity .",
    "these are reproduced in the body of table ( [ tab:4d ] ) .",
    "each row and column contains three operators having eigenvalues @xmath160 which commute .",
    "the products of the three operators in each row and column is the identity operator , with the exception of the third column , whose product is minus the identity .",
    "a valuation would consist of an assignment of a value ( @xmath8 or @xmath9 ) to each observable such that these functional relationships hold , _",
    "i.e. _ , the product of the values in each row and column would be @xmath161 , except the final column which would give @xmath162 .",
    "this is easily seen to be impossible , hence the ks theorem in four dimensions is proved .",
    "[ tab:4d ] @xmath163    peres gives a set of 24 vectors belonging to 6 orthogonal tetrads in @xmath151 ( shown in the upper row and leftmost column of table 1 which form a totally non - colourable set in the usual way , and shows how the degenerate operators used in mermin s reasoning may be derived from them . when viewed in the context of constructing a global element of @xmath28  over @xmath0 , it is easy to see that these correspond to the subdiagram of @xmath0  shown in figure ( [ fig:4d ] ) .",
    "the orthogonal tetrads of vectors correspond to maximal algebras @xmath143 , and the degenerate operators in the body of the table correspond to 2 - 2 degenerate algebras .",
    "each degenerate algebra is included in two maximal algebras , for example the spectral algebra of @xmath164 consists of projectors onto the eigenspaces @xmath165 and @xmath166 , where @xmath77 and @xmath167 are the vectors defined in the table .",
    "we can see that in this four - dimensional case , there are loops containing just four maximal algebras , and four 2 - 2 degenerate algebras .",
    "these constrain the algebras involved more severely than the larger loops previously considered , as is shown by the fact that only three interlinked loops are now required for a complete proof of the ks theorem .",
    "we have shown that various existing proofs of the kochen - specker theorem may be viewed as subsets of the category @xmath0  over which no global elements of the dual presheaf @xmath28  may be constructed . as we move to higher - dimensional hilbert spaces",
    ", we see that there are more possible types of degenerate boolean subalgebra , and hence more ways of forming obstructions .",
    "we have seen that in four dimensions , loops may be easily found containing fewer than the necessary ten algebras in three dimensions , leading to new predictive sets .",
    "some care must be taken when examining these structures , however , as it is now necessary to examine whether connections are independent .",
    "for example , a loop with just four algebras may be constructed : two maximal algebras , @xmath168 with two projectors @xmath169 in common , and the two 3 - 1 degenerate algebras generated by @xmath170 and @xmath171 .",
    "these appear to form a loop which could be used in the construction of an obstruction , but in fact this is not so , since the inclusion maps from both degenerate algebras factor through the 2 - 1 - 1 degenerate algebra generated by the projectors @xmath170 and @xmath171 .",
    "any valuation on this 2 - 1 - 1 degenerate algebra will induce ( compatible ) valuations on all of its subalgebras .",
    "a choice of a value for a global element @xmath23 of @xmath52 for one of the maximal operators will therefore only result in a single restriction on @xmath23 over the second , so it is therefore not possible to obtain contradictions from this construction .",
    "this fact , that loops with two degenerate algebras each included in two maximal algebras , may be reduced to the inclusion of a single degenerate algebra , is true in any finite - dimensional hilbert space .",
    "all projectors in each degenerate algebra are contained in both maximal algebras , so a larger degenerate algebra may be formed by combining the original two , and this will also be contained in each maximal algebra .",
    "the general appearance of these diagrams of loops in @xmath0  suggests that some type of cohomological description of these structures may be possible , in analogy with the way obstructions to the construction of non - trivial principle fibre bundles are classified .",
    "the non - existence of valuations would then be verifiable from properties of the base space @xmath0",
    ".    this would be particularly interesting in the light of recent work by meyer , kent and clifton @xcite concerning the fact that the ks theorem does not hold if we restrict attention to a countable dense subset of observables .",
    "this amounts to changing the base category @xmath0  from being the collection of all boolean subalgebras of @xmath172 to some subset of these , with the result that over the new base category , global elements _ can _ be constructed . for the construction given by kent and clifton in @xcite ,",
    "the reasons for the lack of obstructions are fairly clear .",
    "they construct a subset of projectors @xmath173 with the property that no projector in @xmath174 belongs to two _ incompatible _ resolutions of the identity , where two resolutions of the identity @xmath175 are incompatible unless @xmath176 = 0 $ ] for all @xmath177 . the corresponding category of boolean subalgebras , @xmath178 will therefore contain no degenerate algebras which are included in more than one maximal algebra , and hence will contain no loops of algebras of the type used in creating obstructions to the construction of global elements .",
    "the subset of projectors used by meyer s construction @xcite essentially directions in @xmath179 does not have this property , and the lack of obstructions is harder to explain .",
    "a full cohomological decription of obstructions to the construction of global elements of presheaves would be able to throw more light on this problem ."
