    "the anticipated development of 5 g communication is raising interest in new problems in communication theory .",
    "in particular , we now have this general vision of smart cooperative cloud - based networks that can autonomously adjust to varying environmental conditions .",
    "traditional results in network information theory hence need to be used as tools to build a theoretical framework that identifies useful insights and fundamental limits for these new networks .",
    "our focus in this work is to analyze information theoretic models of interference networks that capture the effect of deep fading conditions through introducing random link erasure events in blocks of communication time slots .",
    "more specifically , in order to consider the effect of long - term fluctuations ( deep fading or shadowing ) , we assume that communication takes place over blocks of time slots , and independent link erasures take place with a probability @xmath1 in each block .",
    "further , short - term channel fluctuations allow us to assume that in each time slot , all non erased channel coefficients are drawn independently from a continuous distribution ; this is known as the assumption that the channel is _",
    "generic_.    we are interested in understanding the role of transmitter cooperation ( also known as coordinated multi - point ( comp ) transmission ) in these dynamic interference networks .",
    "in particular , if each message can be assigned to more than one transmitter , with a restriction only on the maximum number of such transmitters , without any constraint on their identity , what would be the optimal assignment of messages to transmitters and corresponding transmission scheme that maximizes the average rate over all possible realizations of the network ? . to simplify analysis , we consider the linear interference network introduced in  @xcite , where each transmitter can only be connected to the receiver having the same index as well as one following receiver .",
    "the channel capacity criterion we consider is the pre - log factor of the sum capacity at high signal to noise ratio ( snr ) , also known as the degrees of freedom ( dof ) . because our goal is to understand the optimal pattern of transmitter cooperation that scales in large networks , we consider the dof normalized by the number of transmitter - receiver pairs , and",
    "take the limit as that number goes to infinity ; we call this the per user degrees of freedom ( pudof ) .    in  @xcite ,",
    "the considered setting was studied , where first the case where each message can only be available at a single transmitter was analyzed .",
    "the optimal assignment of messages to transmitters , and the value of pudof were identified as a function of the erasure probability @xmath1 . in this work ,",
    "we extend the work of  @xcite by studying the case where each message can be available at two transmitters , and transmitter cooperation is allowed .",
    "the optimal message assignment in the limits @xmath3 and @xmath2 were identified in  @xcite and  @xcite . as @xmath3 ,",
    "each message is assigned to the two transmitters connected to its destination , to maximize the probability of successful delivery .",
    "as @xmath2 , the pudof value goes to @xmath5 , and is achieved by splitting the network into subnetworks ; each has five transmitter - receiver pairs . in order to avoid interference between the subnetworks ,",
    "the last transmitter in each subnetwork is inactive . and",
    "hence , each of the first and last message in each subnetwork is only assigned to one of the two transmitters connected to its destination , and the other assignment is used at a transmitter not connected to its destination , but connected to another receiver that is prone to interference caused by this message .",
    "further , the middle message in each subnetwork is not transmitted .",
    "we find , through simulations , in this work that assigning that middle message to only one transmitter connected to its destination , and another transmitter not connected to its destination , leads to better rates than assigning it to the two transmitters connected to its destination at low values of @xmath1 .",
    "that implies that a fraction of @xmath6 of the messages are assigned to only one of the two transmitters connected to their destination , and the remaining @xmath7 are assigned to the two transmitters connected to their destination .",
    "we show in this work , that at any value of @xmath1 from @xmath8 to @xmath9 , the assignment achieving the highest pudof using our proposed scheme , has a fraction of @xmath10 of messages that are assigned to only one of the transmitters connected to their destination , and another transmitter used for interference cancellation , and the remaining fraction @xmath11 of messages are assigned to the two transmitters connected to their destination .",
    "the value of @xmath10 decreases monotonically from @xmath6 to @xmath8 as @xmath1 increases from @xmath8 to @xmath9 , which agrees with the intuition about the shifting role of cooperative transmission from canceling interference to increasing the probability of successful delivery as @xmath1 increases from @xmath8 to @xmath9 .",
    "we use the standard model for the @xmath12user interference channel with single - antenna transmitters and receivers , @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the time index , @xmath15 is the transmitted signal of transmitter @xmath16 , @xmath17 is the received signal at receiver @xmath18 , @xmath19 is the zero mean unit variance gaussian noise at receiver @xmath18 , and @xmath20 is the channel coefficient from transmitter @xmath16 to receiver @xmath18 over the time slot @xmath14 . we remove the time index in the rest of the paper for brevity unless it is needed .",
    "finally , we use @xmath21 $ ] to denote the set @xmath22      each transmitter can only be connected to its corresponding receiver as well as one following receiver , and the last transmitter can only be connected to its corresponding receiver .    in order to consider effect of long - term fluctuations ( shadowing ) ,",
    "we assume that communication takes place over blocks of time slots , and let @xmath1 be the probability of block erasure . in each block",
    ", we assume that for each @xmath16 , and each @xmath23 , @xmath24 with probability @xmath1 .",
    "moreover , short - term channel fluctuations allow us to assume that in each time slot , all non - zero channel coefficients are drawn independently from a continuous distribution .",
    "finally , we assume that global channel state information is available at all transmitters and receivers .      for each @xmath25 $ ] , let @xmath26 be the message intended for receiver @xmath18 , and",
    "@xmath27 $ ] be the transmit set of receiver @xmath18 , i.e. , those transmitters with the knowledge of @xmath26 .",
    "the transmitters in @xmath28 cooperatively transmit the message @xmath26 to the receiver @xmath18 .",
    "the messages @xmath29 are assumed to be independent of each other .",
    "each message can only be available at two transmitters .",
    "i.e. , @xmath30\\ ] ]      the total power constraint across all the users is @xmath31 . in each block of time slots , the rates @xmath32 are achievable",
    "if the decoding error probabilities of all messages can be simultaneously made arbitrarily small as the block length goes to infinity , and this holds for almost all realizations of non - zero channel coefficients .",
    "the sum capacity @xmath33 is the maximum value of the sum of the achievable rates . the total number of degrees of freedom ( @xmath34 ) is defined as @xmath35 . for a @xmath0-user channel , and a probability of block erasure @xmath1 , we let @xmath36 be the average value of @xmath34 over possible choices of non - zero channel coefficients . we further define the asymptotic per user dof ( pudof ) @xmath37 to measure how @xmath36 scale with @xmath0 .",

    "these are initialized to zero .",
    "we look at every message starting from @xmath43 to @xmath44 and evaluate the conditions under which a message can be sent and decoded at its desired receiver , such that no interference occurs .",
    "if a decision is made to send message @xmath45 from transmitter @xmath16 , the corresponding variable @xmath46 is set to one . since message @xmath26 can be sent to its destination using either transmitter @xmath18 or @xmath47 ,",
    "there are two cases that are considered in the algorithm . in the following we are discussing and justifying both cases .",

    "this is only possible if @xmath48 exists and message @xmath45 is available at transmitter @xmath47 .",
    "furthermore , we have to make sure that while sending @xmath45 , transmitter @xmath47 does not cause interference at receiver @xmath47 .",
    "first , assume that transmitter @xmath47 does not send @xmath49 .",
    "there are three possibilities , for which message @xmath45 can be decoded without interference .",
    "the trivial one is that the link between transmitter @xmath47 and receiver @xmath47 does not exist .",
    "another possible scenario is that receiver @xmath47 is not able to decode its desired message anyway , i.e. @xmath49 is not sent from transmitter @xmath50 .",
    "as long as these conditions are satisfied , the variable @xmath51 is set to 1 .",
    "otherwise , if @xmath45 does interfere with @xmath49 at receiver @xmath47 , we might still be able to remove the interference by sending a signal from transmitter @xmath50 such that it will cancel the interference at receiver @xmath47 .",

    "this time , we have to make sure that receiver @xmath18 can decode message @xmath45 without any interference .",
    "this holds if either the link @xmath48 does not exist or if transmitter @xmath47 is not active .",
    "then @xmath67 is set to 1 . for user @xmath68",
    ", we make sure that there is no inter - cluster interference .",
    "similar to the previous case we can also cancel the interference from transmitter @xmath47 as long as message @xmath49 is available at transmitter @xmath18 and @xmath49 is the only message that causes interference at receiver @xmath18 .",
    "if these conditions hold and if for @xmath69 there is no inter - cluster interference , both @xmath67 and @xmath70 are set to 1 .",
    "we now prove the following result to justify algorithm 1 .    given any assignment of messages to transmitters , such that each message can only be available at two transmitters , algorithm 1 leads to the optimal zero - forcing transmission scheme if the whole network is selected as the input cluster .",
    "first , we show that the general structure of our algorithm leads to the optimal transmission scheme .",
    "then , we justify the conditions in detail for the first three messages and finally show how the argument generalizes .",
    "we consider the messages in ascending order from @xmath71 to @xmath72 , and check which transmitter can deliver message @xmath26 such that it can be decoded at its desired receiver and without interfering at any previous active receiver . if this is true , we will transmit the message . in the following ,",
    "we prove by induction that this procedure leads to the optimal transmission scheme . in a first step ,",
    "we consider the base case , i.e. we prove that sending @xmath43 from transmitter @xmath9 is always optimal as long as it is available @xmath73 and @xmath74 .",
    "we define @xmath75 to be the subset of all links @xmath76 through which a message @xmath45 can be sent and decoded at its desired receiver , and call it the feasible set . in other words , all links in @xmath75 satisfy the trivial conditions for transmission ; namely @xmath77 and @xmath78 .",
    "let @xmath79 be an arbitrary set of links that can be used _",
    "simultaneously _ to deliver messages to their desired receivers while eliminating interference .    starting with any set @xmath80 , if @xmath81 , we either add @xmath82 to @xmath80 or replace the first link in @xmath80 by @xmath82 if there is a conflict .",
    "we claim that this replacement can not decrease the dof .",
    "this is because on one hand , the first active receiver in the network does never observe interference .",
    "also , if we send @xmath43 from the first transmitter , this can only cause interference at the second receiver , but as @xmath83 is either not in @xmath84 or it is the first link in @xmath84 and hence is replaced by @xmath82 , the transmission of @xmath43 does not prevent any other message corresponding to subsequent links in @xmath84 from being decoded at their destination . as a consequence , it is always optimal to transmit @xmath43 from transmitter @xmath9 as long as @xmath73 and @xmath85 .",
    "next , we extend the proof to all users by induction .",
    "the induction hypothesis is as follows .",
    "we consider an arbitrary link @xmath86 .",
    "let @xmath87 be the set of links @xmath88 , through which a subset of the messages @xmath89 can be delivered simultaneously to their destinations , while eliminating interference .",
    "assume that all links in @xmath90 are chosen optimally , i.e. the number of delivered messages can not be increased by changing any of these links .    then , we do the induction step .",
    "let @xmath91 be any set of links @xmath88 , through which a subset of the messages @xmath92 can be transmitted simultaneously such that they can be decoded at their destination .",
    "also , the links in @xmath93 are chosen optimally to maximize the number of delivered messages .",
    "if it is possible to send @xmath45 through @xmath76 without causing a conflict with any of the messages , that are sent through the links in @xmath94 , the same logic applies to @xmath76 as to @xmath82 in the base case .",
    "more precisely , if @xmath45 does not interfere at any previous active receiver and it can be decoded at receiver @xmath18 while eliminating interference , @xmath76 can be either added to @xmath95 or replace the first link in @xmath95 , in order to obtain an optimal set of links for the transmission of the messages @xmath96 .",
    "this is possible since again , @xmath45 does not cause interference at any active receiver with an index @xmath97 , because @xmath98 is either not in @xmath95 or it is the link that is replaced by @xmath76 anyway . therefore , sending a message @xmath45 through a link @xmath76 is always optimal as long as it is possible to decode @xmath45 at receiver @xmath18 without causing interference at a previously active receiver .",
    "this simplifies the optimal algorithm in two ways . on the one hand",
    ", we can go through the links one by one and check if it is possible to send a message to its desired receiver without interfering with any of the previous active messages .",
    "if it is possible , we will always decide to send the message . on the other hand , decisions that we already made",
    "do not have to be changed later , because at each step we make sure to avoid conflicts with previously activated messages .",
    "this procedure is applied in algorithm 1 , as we illustrate below .",
    "it is sufficient for the proof to consider only clusters where all diagonal links exist , i.e. all @xmath99 .",
    "this is because otherwise , we can split the network and study both clusters separately .",
    "this will be explained in greater detail in the journal version of the paper .    in the following ,",
    "we derive the decision conditions for the first three messages in a cluster .",
    "+ if @xmath81 , sending @xmath71 is optimal , as shown in the base case of the proof by induction .",
    "hence , set @xmath100 .    if @xmath101 , we have two possibilities .",
    "if @xmath102 , we can not send @xmath103 from transmitter 1 as well without causing interference at the first receiver .",
    "otherwise , if @xmath104 , it is optimal to send @xmath103 from the first transmitter .",
    "if @xmath105 , there are three cases to consider .",
    "first , if @xmath106 and @xmath107 , we have interference from @xmath43 at the second receiver .",
    "however , this can be canceled as long as @xmath71 is available at transmitter 2 .",
    "if this is true , set @xmath57 and @xmath58 . otherwise , if @xmath108 and @xmath56 , it is not necessary to send @xmath109 from transmitter 2 . finally ,",
    "if @xmath108 and @xmath107 , we basically have the same situation as for user 1 .",
    "thus @xmath110 is set to 1 .",
    "note that due to the previous conditions , the case where @xmath106 and @xmath56 never occurs .",
    "now , we consider sending message @xmath111 .    if @xmath112 , the following four scenarios are possible . if @xmath107 and @xmath113 , which implies that @xmath114 , the case of transmitting @xmath115 becomes similar to the case we considered above for user 1 .",
    "hence , @xmath116 .",
    "if @xmath108 , @xmath56 and @xmath113 , which implies that @xmath114 , then we need to consider @xmath117 . as long as @xmath118 , we can send @xmath111 without causing interference at the second receiver .",
    "thus , set @xmath116 . otherwise , if @xmath119 , @xmath111 sent from the second transmitter interferes with @xmath109 .",
    "we can cancel the interference only if @xmath120 , so then set @xmath116 and @xmath121 .",
    "if @xmath106 , @xmath107 and @xmath57 , which implies that @xmath58 , message @xmath111 can not be sent , because this would cause interference at the second receiver , that can not be canceled using the first transmitter without interfering with @xmath71 . finally ,",
    "if @xmath108 , @xmath107 and @xmath57 , which implies that @xmath114 , we could basically send both @xmath103 and @xmath111 from the second transmitter and cancel interference using the first and third transmitter",
    ". however , the sum dof of both messages will remain one .",
    "therefore , in this case we set @xmath122 .",
    "next , we check the possibilities to send @xmath111 from the third transmitter if @xmath123 . if @xmath124 and @xmath125 , then also @xmath114 and the third receiver does not observe interference .",
    "thus , we set @xmath126 . if @xmath124 and @xmath127 , our decision will depend on whether message @xmath71 is sent . if @xmath104 , which implies that @xmath128 , the interference from @xmath109 at the third receiver can be canceled as long as @xmath129 .",
    "if this is true , set @xmath126 and @xmath130 . otherwise , if @xmath106 and therefore @xmath131 , the interference caused by sending @xmath43 can not be canceled , because @xmath132 and hence , @xmath43 can not be assigned to transmitter 3 .",
    "note that as long as @xmath130 , sending @xmath115 from transmitter 3 does not increase the dof .    since each message can only be available at two transmitters , it is not necessary to consider the users before receiver @xmath50 to decide whether @xmath26 can be transmitted .",
    "a more detailed explanation on this will be given in the journal version .",
    "as a consequence , the conditions for sending message @xmath115 , if generalized to @xmath26 , basically apply to all following messages as well .",
    "there are only two additional aspects that have to be considered .",
    "first , if we generalize the case where @xmath121 for interference cancellation , we have to make sure that receiver @xmath50 is not active .",
    "that means for @xmath133 , not only @xmath134 but also @xmath135 has to be true . finally , for any message sent from the last transmitter in the cluster",
    ", inter - cluster interference must be avoided .",
    "therefore , either @xmath136 or @xmath137 has to be erased .",
    "using algorithm 1 , we can determine the optimal transmission scheme for a given network realization and message assignment . in this section",
    ", we apply this algorithm to compute the dof as a function of the erasure probability @xmath1 for several cluster sizes and message assignments . in particular , we find schemes that outperform those presented in @xcite for a wide range of the open interval @xmath138 .",
    "to compute the average pudof at a certain @xmath1 for a given message assignment , we simulate a sufficiently large number @xmath139 of channel realizations , where links are erased with probability @xmath1 , and apply algorithm 1 to each realization .",
    "the pudof value is then computed as the average number of decoded messages divided by the cluster size @xmath68 .",
    "the simulation is done for a set of message assignments with different fractions @xmath10 of messages that are assigned to one transmitter connected to their desired receiver and another transmitter that can be used to cancel interference , while the remaining fraction of @xmath11 of messages are assigned to both transmitters that are connected to their destination .",
    "furthermore , we vary the cluster size @xmath68 .",
    "more precisely , we use the following assignment strategy : @xmath140    first , we choose @xmath68 to be 100 and vary @xmath10 from @xmath141 up to @xmath142 , calculating the pudof as a function of @xmath1 for each of these message assignments .",
    "additionally , we vary the cluster size and thus also the message assignment by reducing the fraction by its greatest common divisor . as an example , for @xmath143 we consider a cluster with @xmath144 users where only the first message is assigned to the first and second transmitter , while all other messages @xmath26 are known at the transmitters @xmath47 and @xmath18 , respectively .    as a result , the maximum pudof that is achievable with the set of message assignments described above",
    "is shown in figure [ fig : plot ] .",
    "compared to the schemes presented in @xcite , there exist message assignments with a better performance . these are presented in table [ opt_assignments ] .",
    "note that in @xcite it was shown that assignment with @xmath145 is optimal for @xmath2 .",
    "interestingly , we find an assignment with @xmath146 ( see the green curve in fig . [",
    "fig : plot ] ) that achieves the same pudof for @xmath147 , but performs slightly better on the interval @xmath148 . from our results in table [ opt_assignments ] , we observe that the optimal fraction @xmath10 decreases monotonically from @xmath6 to @xmath8 as @xmath1 goes from @xmath8 to @xmath9 .            , v.  s.  annapureddy , and v.  v.  veervalli , `` degrees of freedom ( dof ) of locally connected interference channels with coordinated multi - point ( comp ) transmission , '' in _ proc .",
