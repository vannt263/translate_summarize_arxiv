    "study of nuclei in mass a @xmath5 105 region close to the n = z = 50 shell closures is interesting due to existence of various structural effects with increasing proton and neutron numbers .",
    "the availability of limited number of valance nucleons with respect to doubly magic @xmath7sn core , makes this region , an ideal testing ground for the observation of various nuclear phenomena such as band termination , shears mechanism , antimagnetic rotation and shape evolution from collective to non - collective structures or vice versa @xcite .",
    "these structures are attributed to various coupling and competition between collective and single particle degrees of freedom .",
    "the nuclei in this mass region show small deformation ( @xmath8 ) @xcite at low spins , evolving into collective structures with increasing angular momentum . this behavior is observed particularly in lighter odd - a cd isotopes .",
    "since these nuclei lie in transitional region with two proton holes in high-@xmath9 1g@xmath10 orbital and several neutron particles in low-@xmath9 g@xmath11 , d@xmath12 and h@xmath13 orbitals , the competing rotational - vibrational structures are built on the configurations involving these orbitals .",
    "for example , systematic study of @xmath14cd @xcite isotopes reveals that the yrast negative parity band structures are developed on vibrational excitation at low spins , which evolved into rotational structures that terminate at higher spins .",
    "these rotational structures are interpreted due to the alignment of @xmath15h@xmath13 pair . whereas the positive parity bands are interpreted as based on configurations involving @xmath15g@xmath16 and @xmath15d@xmath12 orbitals .",
    "theoretically , these nuclei are predicted to have rapid shape transitions as a function of rotational frequency due to the occupation probability of valance quasiparticles in deformation driving high - j , low-@xmath9 orbitals .",
    "for example , such a shape transition is evident in @xmath17cd @xcite based on total routhian surface calculations ( trs ) , which depicts that , the prolate shape of this nucleus persists up to spin j@xmath18=39/2@xmath4 and changes to an oblate shape at higher spins . in case of @xmath19cd @xcite , the shape of the nucleus , which is quite @xmath6-soft at low spin",
    ", evolves into a near prolate shape at higher spins .",
    "thus , the triaxial deformation parameter-@xmath6 has strong influence over the shape of nuclei and it would be interesting to investigate such an effect in @xmath0cd .    the low spin sates in @xmath0cd have been reported previously by several groups @xcite .",
    "first identification of excited negative parity structures in @xmath0cd have been done by regan _",
    "et al . , _ @xcite using fusion evaporation reaction and reported the level structure up to j@xmath18 = 47/2@xmath4 .",
    "later , the positive parity level structures were established by jerrestam _",
    "et al . , _",
    "@xcite with several modifications made in negative parity sequences .",
    "the observed band structures were discussed based on the spin diabatic surface calculations .",
    "recently , the lifetimes of the yrast negative parity states above spin 23/2 @xmath20 have been measured using doppler shift attenuation method @xcite .",
    "the extracted @xmath21 values show decrease with increasing spin , whereas the dynamic moment of inertia remains constant at @xmath5 30 @xmath22 .",
    "these are signatures of anti - magnetic rotational phenomenon in this band . although , the yrast negative parity bands in @xmath0cd have been reported up to high spins , the high spin state information for positive and non - yrast negative parity states in @xmath0cd is limited .",
    "therefore , detailed investigation of these structures in @xmath0cd to higher spins has been the subject of interest in the present work . in addition , the study of shape evolution in this nucleus enable us to understand the competing interplay between single particle and collective degrees of freedom in this region .",
    "the deduced band structures have been analyzed using the cranked shell model ( csm ) and triaxial projected shell model ( tpsm ) approaches .",

    "the bands b6 and b5 are predominantly composed of the one - quasineutron configurations , k=5/2 ( 1.1068 ) and k=5/2(0.9288 ) and k= 9/2(1.1068 ) and k= 9/2(0.9288 ) and the band b3 is primarily a three - quasiparticle configuration .",
    "it is evident from fig .",
    "[ figtpsmw2 ] that two observed positive parity b1 and b2 bands have predominant one - quasiparticle configurations , k=9/2 , 13/2 and also three - quasiparticle contribution with k=17/2 .",
    "we would like to point out that tpsm results in figs .",
    "[ figtpsmw1 ] and [ figtpsmw2 ] deviate for higher spin states , in particular , for bands b3 and b2 .",

    "the earlier reported level structures have been verified .",
    "we have incorporated several modifications in the positive and negative parity bands .",
    "four new band structures have been established with the addition of 30 new transitions to the level scheme .",
    "spin and parity of the observed states have been assigned based on the directional correlation orientation ratios , polarization asymmetry values and systematics .",
    "the experimental alignments and rotational properties of the identified bands are discussed within the framework of cranked shell model , which explains the observed experimental alignments reasonably well .",
    "the trs calculations for the yrast band structures show evolution from prolate shape at low rotational frequency to triaxial shapes at higher rotational frequencies .",
    "the triaxial projected shell model calculations are performed , which predict that , the observed band structures has strong dependence on triaxial deformation and indicate that the shape of @xmath0cd changes from @xmath6-soft to @xmath6-rigid for excited configurations .",
    "the calculated wave functions for the newly observed excited bands predict that one - quasiparticle configurations with k = 5/2 and 9/2 components are dominant for negative parity bands b5 and b6 .",
    "the positive parity band b2 is based on configurations with k = 9/2 , 13/2 ( one - quasiparticle ) and also k=17/2 ( three - quasiparticle ) .",
