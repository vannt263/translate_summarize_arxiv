    "periodic boundary conditions are used . for @xmath26 mesh points ,",
    "the boundary conditions also have no effect on the structures within the system .",
    "this is confirmed by also performing the simulations with unpinned spins , and observing that the same results are obtained.a euler integration scheme is sufficient and therefore used for the time integration of the system .",
    "indeed more advanced methods , like runge - kutta and ndsolve of mathematica , give essentially identical numerical results .    throughout the course of a simulation we require that the magnitude of the magnetization remain constant @xmath27 .",
    "however , the accumulation of numerical errors means that this is not the case , and the magnetization tends to drift away from the value one .",
    "therefore we add an additional bloch - like damping term to the equation of motion ( [ eq1 ] ) that recalls the length of the magnetization vector back to one at each time step .",
