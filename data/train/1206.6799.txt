    "type ia supernovae ( sne ) are believed to be the thermonuclear explosion of a c+o white dwarf ( wd ) that is destabilized when its mass approaches the chandrasekhar limit by accretion of material from a binary companion .",
    "after the central regions ignite , a burning front propagates outwards , consuming the entire star and leading to a characteristic ejecta structure with @xmath0 0.7 m@xmath3 of fe - peak nuclei ( primarily in the form of @xmath2ni that powers the sn light curve ) in the inside , and an equal amount of intermediate mass elements on the outside .",
    "while the amount of @xmath2ni can vary between @xmath0 0.3 m@xmath3 and @xmath0 1 m@xmath3 , the stratification of the ejecta remains constant across sne ia subtypes @xcite .",
    "the simple structure of the ejecta results in uniform light curves and spectra and make sn  ia useful distance indicators ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "depending upon the nature of the wd companion , sn  ia progenitors are divided into either single degenerate @xcite or double degenerate cases @xcite . finding clear evidence supporting one of these two scenarios has become a cornerstone in stellar astrophysics , as unknown evolutionary effects associated with the progenitors may introduce systematic trends that could limit the precision of cosmological measurements based on sn  ia @xcite .",
    "most type ia supernova remnants ( snrs ) reflect the simplicity of the explosion .",
    "galactic snrs such as tycho and sn  1006 appear remarkably symmetric @xcite , unlike their core ",
    "collapse counterparts , such as cas a @xcite or younger extragalactic sne such as sn  1980k or sn  1993j @xcite .",
    "the morphology and x - ray spectra of snrs with known ages and a type ia classification also indicate that the progenitors do not modify their surroundings in a strong way  in particular , while absorption features seen in the spectra of type ia sne suggest small cavities of radius @xmath7 10@xmath8 cm @xcite , there is little evidence for large ( @xmath9 @xmath0 3  30 pc ) wind - blown cavities around the explosion site @xcite .",
    "however , @xcite recently showed that the candidate type ia rcw  86 is currently interacting with a cavity wall and that the cavity has a radius of @xmath0 12 pc , in the middle of the range of sizes expected from the accretion wind models @xcite .",
    "the lack of a sizeable population of ia snr inside of cavities is particularly relevant as the current paradigm for sn  ia progenitors in the single degenerate channel predicts fast , optically thick outflows from the wd surface which would leave behind such cavities ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "additionally , the dynamical and spectral properties of young ia snrs like tycho and 050967.5 are more consistent with an interaction with a constant density interstellar medium ( ism ) @xcite .",
    "a notable exception to this is kepler s snr ( g4.5 + 6.8 ; kepler ) , shown in x - rays in figure  [ fig : kepler ] .",
    "kepler s snr has recently been firmly established as the remnant of a type ia sn , based on the o / fe ratio observed in the x - ray spectrum @xcite . however , unlike many other type ia snrs , the morphology of this @xmath10 400 yr old remnant shows a strong bilateral symmetry , and optical observations reveal clear signs of an interaction between the blastwave and a dense , nitrogen  enhanced circumstellar shell with a mass of @xmath0 1m@xmath3 @xcite . near infrared observations also show evidence for circumstellar knots akin to the quasi - stationary floculi of cassiopeia a @xcite .",
    "this suggests that either the progenitor of kepler s sn or its binary companion might have been relatively massive , creating a bowshock shaped circumstellar medium ( csm ) structure as the system lost mass and moved against the surrounding ism . @xcite",
    "found values of @xmath11 @xmath0 5@xmath12 10@xmath13 m@xmath3 yr@xmath14 and v@xmath15 = 15 km s@xmath14 are required in order to explain the morphology of kepler s bowshock . while it is likely that not all progenitor scenarios for sne ia are the same , the dense csm wind required to create the observed morphology appears to be in conflict with observations of the recent nearby sn  ia 2011fe in m101 @xcite . in the case of 2011fe , the radio and x - ray observations place constraints on the circumstellar environment with @xmath16 @xmath17 6 @xmath18 , or in the case of a stellar wind , @xmath11 @xmath17 6@xmath1210@xmath19 m@xmath3 yr@xmath14 @xcite .",

    "located well above the galactic plane , the snr has an angular size of 2@xmath1 in radius , but the distance is poorly constrained .",
    "@xcite used absorption to estimate a distance of 4.8 @xmath4 d@xmath23 @xmath4 6.4 kpc , while @xcite estimate that the snr is somewhat closer , with a lower limit of 3.0 kpc on the distance , based on the width of the h@xmath24 line and proper motion measurements .",
    "the non - detection of tev @xmath25-rays by hess ( f@xmath26 @xmath4 8.6 @xmath12 10@xmath27 erg @xmath28 s@xmath14 ) places a lower limit on the distance to kepler of @xmath0 6 kpc @xcite assuming a model for the gamma - ray emission @xcite , for a normal ia sn . to match the angular size",
    ", the distance would have to be even greater than 6 kpc ( @xmath7 7 kpc ) if the sn were more energetic than a normal ia , or else the blastwave would have to expand into a csm with considerable density .",
    "@xcite measured the velocity of the snr forward shock and estimated @xmath29 = 4200@xmath30 km s@xmath14 and concluded that the distance must be @xmath7 6 kpc or otherwise the sn was subenergetic .",
    "the distance estimates are incompatible with one another : either 3.0 @xmath4 d@xmath23 @xmath4 6.4 kpc , or d@xmath23 @xmath5 7 kpc , based on the non - detection of tev gamma - rays , an important new constraint .",
    "given the uncertainty on the distance , the blastwave has a radius between 1.75 @xmath31 r@xmath32 @xmath31 3.7 pc , or r@xmath32 @xmath5 4.1 pc .",
    "here we present hydrodynamical simulations of type ia sn ejecta interacting with an external medium shaped by a circumstellar wind .",
    "combining models for the pre - supernova mass - loss with models for the ejecta density distribution and composition , we simultaneously fit both the morphology of the snr and the observed x - ray spectrum within the observable constraints the age and angular size of the snr along with the bulk spectral properties .",
    "since the circumstellar environment is complicated by the bowshock structure in the north , we focus our attention on the southern portion of the snr ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : kepler ] ) , in an attempt to minimize the number of free parameters in our hydrodynamical simulations . based on our joint hydrodynamical and spectral fits ,",
    "we conclude that kepler was a luminous type ia sn .",
    "if the snr is expanding into a stellar wind we require a distance to kepler of @xmath5 7 kpc .",

    "a 750ks _ chandra _ image of kepler s snr ( pi : s.  reynolds ) is shown in figure  [ fig : kepler ] , with the x - ray emission from the pie - sliced region shown in figure  [ fig : spec_fit ] ( left ) .",
    "as shown in fig  [ fig : spec_fit ] ( left ) , the x - ray spectrum is dominated by emission from fe k and fe l , as well as emission from intermediate mass elements such as silicon , sulfur , and argon .",
    "the amount of iron emission in the spectrum is a key constraint on the explosion , as it will allow us to discriminate between type ia explosion models @xcite .",
    "besides emission from the shocked ejecta , there is also emission from circumstellar material mainly oxygen and neon , which overlaps with the l - shell iron emission @xcite , as well as nonthermal continuum which contributes to the emission above a few kev @xcite . in the subsequent discussion on the fits to the spectrum ,",
    "we do not account for either the contribution from the swept up circumstellar material or nonthermal emission in the spectral models the contribution by shocked circumstellar material to the thermal x - ray emission is small and accounts for only a few percent of the total emission @xcite , while the nonthermal emission serves to raise the continuum above @xmath0 4 kev .",
    "the processes that lead to the nonthermal emission could alter the thermal spectrum @xcite , but those affects have been shown to be small , particularly in young snrs @xcite .",
    "interesting characteristics of the spectrum include : the presence or absence of emission from iron , which will constrain the explosion energetics ; the centroids of k  shell emission lines , which constrains the ionization state of the shocked gas ; and flux ratios of individual lines , such as k@xmath24 to h - like ly@xmath24 , which constrain the density of the circumstellar material .",
    "the spectra from the combined 750ks observation shown in figure  [ fig : kepler ] was extracted from the level 2 _ chandra _ event list using ciao 4.1 , and weighted response matrices were computed using caldb version 4.1.3 . the broadband spectrum ( fig .",
    "[ fig : spec_fit ] , left ) shows significant emission from both fe l and fe k @xcite .",
    "given the complexity of the fe l emission at @xmath0 1 kev , we focus only on those emission lines above 1.5 kev , as they are well separated from neighboring lines .",
    "to measure the emission line centroids , we modeled the spectrum as a powerlaw continuum with a series of gaussians for each emission line .",
    "the spectral fit is shown in figure  [ fig : spec_fit ] ( right ) .",
    "we chose to model the continuum as a powerlaw since @xcite showed that much of the continuum emission in kepler is nonthermal in nature ( see figs .  6 and 8 of * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "for the spectral fits , we used xspec version 11.3.2ag .",
    "we used a region nearby the supernova remnant for a local background subtraction .",
    "since we are only fitting the data above @xmath0 1.5 kev , we do not include absorption in our spectral fits .",

    "fitting only the data above 1.5 kev , we were unable to constrain the column density .",
    "however in the subsequent sections where we compare our hydrodynamical and spectral models to the data , we assume a column of 5.2 @xmath12 10@xmath34 @xmath28 so that we may compare the computed x - ray emission below 1.5 kev directly to the data .",
    "the results of our centroid fits are listed in table  [ tab : fits ] .",
    "the key results in table  [ tab : fits ] are the line centroids , and in the subsequent discussion , we will focus on the line centroids of of si k@xmath24 , s k@xmath24 , and fe k@xmath24 .",
    "we also point out in figure  [ fig : spec_fit ] ( right ) that there is little emission at 2 kev from ly@xmath24 .",
    "this is confirmed in our spectral analysis where we are only able to set an upper limit on the ly@xmath24 emission from shocked ejecta in the south .",
    "the lack of emission at this energy will be used to constrain the csm structure and density .",
    "in this section , we present results from a modeling effort where we have coupled the hydrodynamics to a nonequilibrium ionization ( nei ) calculation to produce joint spectral and dynamical fits to kepler s snr .",
    "we describe , in general terms in   3.1 the formation of the bowshock structure in the north of kepler and how it can be used to constrain the mass - loss parameters of the progenitor system .",
    "we also describe how the choice of ia explosion model ( e.g. the explosion energy and amount of @xmath2ni that is synthesized ) imposes a constraint on the uncertain distance to the snr . in the subsequent sections",
    ", we compare the bulk spectral properties of kepler s snr to those predicted by our spectral models .",
    "the presence of a bowshock and shell of circumstellar material in the north of kepler s snr suggests that there was an outflow from the progenitor or its companion prior to the explosion .",
    "this is because the bowshock can only form at a converging flow , in this case a wind interacting with the interstellar medium , where the ism has a net inflow velocity relative to the progenitor , due to the progenitor s systemic velocity through the ism .",
    "@xcite recently modeled the dynamics of the snr blastwave through the bowshock and concluded that the dynamics of the snr blastwave are consistent with the presence of a bowshock .",
    "we can use estimates for the location of the bowshock stagnation point as a constraint on the wind parameters .",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) :    @xmath36    where @xmath11 is the mass - loss rate , @xmath37 is the wind speed , @xmath38 is the ambient ism density , and @xmath39 is the systemic velocity of the star . in order to explain the large distance above the galactic plane , the progenitor likely had a large systemic velocity , @xmath39 @xmath0 250 km s@xmath14",

    "equation  [ eqn : stag ] can be inverted to estimate the mass - loss rate of the wind :    @xmath42    given the uncertainty of greater than a factor of two on the distance , the stagnation point is located at a radius of 24 pc , similar to the 23 pc assumed by @xcite .",

    "the mass - loss rates from agb stars can vary over several orders of magnitude , but the velocity of the wind is generally 1020 km s@xmath14 @xcite . using this range in velocity combined with the range in the radius of the stagnation point yields mass - loss rates of 10@xmath13 ",
    "10@xmath43 m@xmath44 yr@xmath14 .    to model a csm wind , the mass - loss rate and wind velocity are all that are required , since @xmath45 = @xmath46 where the wind normalization @xmath47",

    "for rcw  86 , @xcite require a density contrast of @xmath4 2 between the north and south , in order to reproduce the observed x - ray emission at an age of 1800 yr . for kepler",
    ", a density contrast considerably higher than 2 would be required to produce the same morphology in just 400 yr .",
    "160@xmath70 emission @xcite suggests a density gradient towards the north  northwest of kepler , but they point out that much of that emission _ may _ arise from foreground or background sources .",
    "@xcite reached a similar conclusion from _ spitzer _",
    "160@xmath70 observations , noting a north  south gradient in the emission at that wavelength , indicative of a density gradient in the circumstellar medium .",
    "if the bowshock structure is caused by a gradient in the density of the circumstellar environment , then that would suggest that the sn exploded in an environment that was closer to uniform in density , rather than one shaped by a slow and dense stellar wind interacting with the ism .",
    "if this were indeed the case for kepler , then it would be similar to the candidate type ia remnant g299.2 - 2.9 . in the case of that remnant , a signficant density gradient ( 3@xmath12 )",
    "is required to explain the observed asymmetry in the x - ray morphology @xcite . however , that snr is estimated to be ten times older than kepler , so the spatial scale of the density gradient is correspondingly larger .",
    "in order to explain the observed dynamics and x - ray emission of kepler s supernova remnant , we have coupled models for ejecta from type ia sne to a model for a circumstellar medium shaped by a slow stellar wind . we have synthesized the x - ray emission from these models and compared it to the observed x - ray spectrum .",
    "our conclusions are :    1 .",
    "if the distance to kepler is taken to be less than 6.4 kpc , then the dynamics ( e.g. the forward shock radius ) are better explained by a subenergetic explosion model ( ddtg ) interacting with a slow and dense stellar wind .",
    "however , while the subenergetic models can explain the dynamics , the synthesized x - ray spectra do not agree with the observed x - ray emission .",
    "specifically , the subenergetic model does not produce enough iron to explain the observed emission .",
    "the presence of strong fe emission in the spectrum rules out all ddtg models . 2 .",
    "if the distance is taken to be greater than 7 kpc , then the dynamics can be explained by the energetic ia models . while the x - ray spectrum of kepler shows significant emission from fe k and fe l , there is little emission from h - like ly@xmath24 of intermediate mass elements such as silicon .",
    "the modeled line centroids in the ddta + wind models do not agree with the measured line centroids , even in those models with high mechanical luminosities ( i.e. high wind speeds ) .",
    "additionally , the pure wind models over predict the amount of ly@xmath24 emission relative to that which is observed .",
    "this rules out the ddta + wind models with csm winds that extend all the way to the explosion site .",
    "since the ddtg models are ruled out based on the presence of fe emission , and the ddta + wind models are ruled out based on the measured k - shell line centroids and si k@xmath24 to ly@xmath24 flux ratio , we consider the presence of a small , low density cavity around the progenitor prior to the sn .",
    "the low density cavity alters the ionization state of the shocked ejecta but does not significantly change the dynamics of the forward shock .",
    "we find that the presence of the cavity reduces both the amount of ly@xmath24 emission as well as the modeled line centroids to values consistent with the measured centroids .",
    "we find that the energetic ia model ( ddta ) interacting with a wind with velocity @xmath71 20 km s@xmath14 and mass - loss rate of @xmath71 6@xmath1210@xmath13 m@xmath3 yr@xmath14 is a good match both spectrally and dynamically , assuming a distance @xmath5 7 kpc .",
    "4 .   ddta models with a constant density ambient medium ( @xmath45 @xmath10 2 @xmath12 10@xmath65 g @xmath18 ) can explain the observed x - ray emission and place the snr at a distance that is consistent with previous estimates @xcite . in order to explain the bowshock structure in the north , a north - south density gradient in the interstellar medium",
    "is required .",
    "evidence for such a gradient is seen in 160@xmath70 emission maps of kepler and its vicinity @xcite .",
    "+    thus , we conclude that in order to explain both the dynamics and x - ray emission of kepler in the context of a wind environment , the explosion was energetic , producing @xmath0 1m@xmath3 of @xmath2ni .",
    "the supernova occurred in a slow and dense csm wind with a small central cavity .",
    "the observed x - ray emission , which traces the explosion energetics , requires a distance @xmath7 7 kpc , in the csm wind model .",
    "alternatively , we find that the x - ray emission and dynamics of kepler can also be explained by a constant csm density model .",
    "these models place the snr at a distance of @xmath0 56 kpc , consistent with previous measurements . in the constant density scenario ,",
    "a north  south density gradient in the ism would be required in order to explain the snr morphology .",
