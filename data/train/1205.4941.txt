    "full information about the experimental state of a quantum system is naturally highly desirable because it enables one to determine the mean value of each observable and thus also of each other property of the quantum state .",
    "abstractly , such a complete description is given for example by the density operator , a positive semidefinite matrix  @xmath0 with unit trace .",
    "quantum state tomography  @xcite refers to the task to determine the density operator for a previously unknown quantum state by means of appropriate measurements . via the respective outcomes more and more information about the true state generating the data",
    "is collected up to the point where this information uniquely specifies the particular state .",
    "quantum state tomography has successfully been applied in many experiments using different physical systems , including trapped ions  @xcite or photons  @xcite as prominent instances .",
    "unfortunately , tomography comes with a very high price due to the exponential scaling of the number of parameters required to describe composed quantum systems . for an @xmath1 qubit system",
    "the total number of parameters of the associated density operator is @xmath2 and any standard tomography protocol is naturally designed to determine all these variables .",
    "the most common scheme used in experiments  @xcite consists of locally measuring in the basis of all different pauli operators and requires an overall amount of @xmath3 different measurement settings with @xmath4 distinct outcomes each .",
    "other schemes , _",
    "e.g. _ , using an informationally complete measurement  @xcite locally would require just one setting but , nevertheless , the statistics for @xmath5 different outcomes . hence the important figure of merit to compare different methods is given by the combination of settings and outcomes .",
    "for such a scaling , the methods rapidly become intractable , already for present state - of - the - art experiments : recording for example the data of @xmath6 trapped ions  @xcite , currently the record for quantum registers , would require about @xmath7 days , although @xmath8 measurement outcomes can be collected for a single setting in only about three seconds . in photonic experiments",
    "this scaling is even worse because count rates are typically much lower , _",
    "e.g. _ , in recent eight - photon experiments  @xcite a coincidence of single click events occurs only at the order of minutes , hence it would require about seven years to collect an adequate data set .",
    "this directly shows that more sophisticated tomography techniques are mandatory .",
    "new tomography protocols equipped with better scaling behaviour exploit the idea that the measurement scheme is explicitly optimized only for particular kinds of states rather than for all possible ones . if the true unknown state lies within this designed target class then full information about the state can be obtained with much less effort , and if the underlying density operator is not a member then a certificate signals that tomography is impossible in this given case .",
    "recent results along this direction include tomography schemes designed for states with a low rank  @xcite , particularly for important low rank states like matrix product  @xcite or multi - scale entanglement renormalization ansatz states  @xcite .",
    "other schemes include a tomography scheme based on information criteria  @xcite or  the topic of this manuscript  states with permutation invariance  @xcite .",
    "however it needs to be stressed that in any real experiment all these tomography schemes must cope with another , purely statistical challenge : since only a finite number of measurements can be carried out in any experiment one can not access the true probabilities predicted by quantum mechanics @xmath9 , operator @xmath10 describing the measurements , but merely relative frequencies @xmath11 .",
    "though these deviations might be small , the approximation @xmath12 causes severe problems in the actual state reconstruction process , _ i.e. _ , the task to determine the density operator from the observed data .",
    "if one navely uses the frequencies according to born s rule @xmath13 and solves for the unknown operator @xmath14 , then , apart from possible inconsistencies in the set of linear equations , the reconstructed operator @xmath15 is often not a valid density operator anymore because some of its eigenvalues are negative .",
    "hence in such cases this reconstruction called linear inversion delivers an unreasonable answer .",
    "it should be kept in mind that inconsistencies can also be due to systematic errors , _",
    "e.g. _ , if the true measurements are aligned wrongly relative to the respective operator representation  @xcite , but such effects are typically ignored .    therefore , statistical state reconstruction relies on other principles than linear inversion .",
    "in general , these methods require the solution of a non - linear optimization problem , which is much harder to solve than just a system of linear equations . for large system sizes this becomes , besides the exponential scaling of the number of settings and outcomes , a second major problem , again due to the exponential scaling of the number of parameters of the density operator .",
    "in fact for the current tomography record of eight ions in a trap @xcite , this actual reconstruction took even longer than the experiment itself ( one week versus a couple of hours ) .",
    "hence , feasible quantum state tomography schemes for large systems must , in addition to an efficient measurement procedure , possess also an efficient state reconstruction algorithm , otherwise they are not scalable .    in this paper",
    "we develop a scalable reconstruction algorithm for the proposed permutationally invariant tomography scheme  @xcite .",
    "it works for common reconstruction principles , including , among others , maximum likelihood and least squares methods .",
    "this scheme becomes possible once more by taking advantage of the particular symmetry of this special kind of states , which provides an efficient and operational way to store , characterize and even process those states .",
    "this method enables a large dimension reduction in the underlying optimization problem such that it gets into the feasible regime .",
    "the final low dimensional optimization is performed via non - linear convex optimization which offers great advantages in contrast to commonly used numerical routines , in particular regarding numerical stability and accuracy .",
    "already a first prototype implementation of this algorithm allows state reconstruction for @xmath16 qubits in a few minutes on a standard desktop computer .",
    "the outline of the manuscript is as follows : section  [ sec : background ] summarizes the background on permutationally invariant tomography and on statistical state reconstruction .",

    "permutationally invariant tomography has been introduced as a scalable reconstruction protocol for multi - qubit systems in ref .",
    "it is designed for all states of the system that remain invariant under all possible interchanges of its different particles .",
    "abstractly such a permutationally invariant state @xmath17 of @xmath1 qubits can be expressed in the form , @xmath18_{\\rm pi } = \\frac{1}{n ! } \\sum_{p\\in s_n } v(p)\\ : \\rho \\ : v(p)^\\dag,\\ ] ] where @xmath19 is the unitary operator which permutes the @xmath1 different subsystems according to the particular permutation @xmath20 and the summation runs over all possible elements of the permutation group @xmath21 .",
    "many important states , like greenberger - horne - zeilinger states or dicke states fall within this special class .    as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , full information of such states can be obtained by using in total @xmath22 different local binary measurement settings , while for each setting only the count rates of @xmath23 different outcomes need to be registered .",
    "this finally leads to a cubic scaling in contrast to the exponential scaling of standard tomography schemes .",
    "the measurement strategy that attains this number runs as follows : each setting is described by a unit vector @xmath24 which defines associated eigenstates @xmath25 of the trace - less operator @xmath26 .",
    "each party locally measures in this basis and registers the outcomes `` @xmath27 '' or `` @xmath28 '' respectively .",
    "the permutationally invariant part can be reconstructed from the collective outcomes , _",
    "i.e. _ , only the number of `` @xmath27 '' or `` @xmath28 '' results at the different parties matters but not the individual site information .",
    "the corresponding coarse - grained measurements are given by @xmath29_{\\rm pi}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath30 and where the summation @xmath31 is over all permutations that give distinct terms .",
    "in total one needs the above stated number of different settings @xmath32 .",
    "these settings can be optimized in order to minimize the total variance which provides an advantage in contrast to random selection .",
    "in addition to this measurement strategy there is also a pretest which estimates the `` closeness '' of the true , unknown state with respect to all permutationally invariant states from just a few measurement results  @xcite .",
    "this provides a way to test in advance whether permutationally invariant tomography is a good method for the unknown state .    restricting to the permutationally invariant part of a density operator",
    "has already been discussed in the literature ; for example for spins in a stern - gerlach experiment  @xcite or in terms of the polarization density operator  @xcite . here , due to the restricted class of possible measurements ,",
    "only the permutationally invariant part of , in principle distinguishable , particles is accessible  @xcite .",
    "this is a strong conceptual difference to permutationally invariant tomography where one intentionally constrains itself to this invariant part .",
    "nevertheless it should be emphasized that the employed techniques are similar .",
    "since standard linear inversion of the observed data typically results in unreasonable estimates as explained in the introduction , one employs other principles for actual state reconstruction .",
    "in general one uses a certain fit function @xmath33 that penalizes deviations between the observed frequencies @xmath11 and the true probabilities predicted by quantum mechanics @xmath34 if the state of the system is @xmath0 . the reconstructed density operator @xmath35 is then given by the ( often unique ) state that minimizes this fit function , @xmath36 hence the reconstructed state is precisely the one which best fits the observed data . since the optimization explicitly restricts to physical density operators this assures validity of the final estimate @xmath35 in contrast to linear inversion . depending on the functional form of the fit function different reconstruction principles are distinguished .",

    "given a set of measured frequencies @xmath11 the maximum likelihood state @xmath42 is exactly the one with the highest probability to generate these data .",
    "other common fit functions , usually employed in photonic state reconstruction , are different variants of least squares  @xcite that originate from the likelihood function using gaussian approximations for the probabilities .",
    "there this is often also called maximum likelihood principle but we distinguish these , indeed different , functions here explicitly . typically the weights in the least squares function are set to be @xmath43 because @xmath11 represents an estimate of the variance in a multinomial distribution , cf . the free least squares principle . however , this leads to a strong bias if the counts rates are extremal , _",
    "e.g. _ , if one of the outcomes is never observed this method naturally leads to difficulties . a method to circumvent this",
    "is given by the free least squares function  @xcite or using improved error analysis for rare events .",
    "let us stress that all these principles have the property that if linear inversion delivers a valid estimate @xmath44 , it is also the estimate given by these reconstruction principles   in this case and clearly @xmath45 for those functions . in the case of the likelihood it follows from positivity of the classical relative entropy between probability distributions . ] .    finally , hedged maximum likelihood  @xcite represents a method that circumvents low rank state estimates .",
    "via this one obtains more reasonable error bars using parametric bootstrapping methods  @xcite ; for other error estimates we refer to the recently introduced confidence regions for quantum states  @xcite . in principle many more fit functions are possible , like generic loss functions  @xcite , but considering these is out of the scope of this work .",
    "from the previous it is apparent that permutationally invariant state reconstruction requires the solution of @xmath46 for the preferred fit function .",
    "this large - scale optimization becomes feasible along the following lines :    first , one reduces the dimensionality of the underlying optimization problem because one can not work with full density operators anymore .",
    "this requires an operational way to characterize permutationally invariant states @xmath47 over which the optimization is performed , and additionally demands an efficient way to compute probabilities @xmath48 which appear in the fit function .",
    "second , one needs a method to perform the final optimization .",
    "we employ convex optimization for this task .",
    "this reduction relies on an efficient toolbox to handle permutationally invariant states , which exploits the particular symmetry .",
    "here we explain this method and the final structure ; for more details see sec .",
    "[ sec : details_reduction ] .",
    "these techniques are well - proven and established ; we employ and adapt them here for the permutationally invariant tomography scheme such that we finally reach state reconstruction of larger qubits .",
    "the methods of this toolbox are obtained via the concept of spin coupling that describes how individual , distinguishable spins couple to a combined system if they become indistinguishable .",
    "since we deal with qubits we only need to focus on spin-@xmath49 particles . in the simplest case",
    ", two spin-@xmath49 particles can couple to a spin-@xmath28 system , called the triplet , if both spins are aligned symmetric , or to a spin-@xmath27 state , the singlet , if the spins are aligned anti - symmetric .",
    "abstractly , this can be denoted as @xmath50 .",
    "if one considers now three spins , then of course all spins can point in the same direction giving a total spin-@xmath51 system .",
    "there is also to a spin-@xmath49 system possible if two particles form already a spin-@xmath27 and the remaining one stays untouched .",
    "this can be achieved however by more than one possibility , in fact by two inequivalent choices   with @xmath20 being any possible permutation , are states of total spin @xmath52 and projection @xmath53 to the collective spin operators @xmath54 , @xmath55 being the corresponding pauli operator on qubit @xmath56 .",
    "however as can be checked these states only span a @xmath57-dimensional subspace . ] , and is expressed by @xmath58 .",
    "this scheme can be extended to @xmath1 spin-@xmath49 particles to obtain the following decomposition of the total hilbert space , @xmath59 where the summation runs over different total spin numbers @xmath60 starting from @xmath61 depending on whether @xmath1 is even or odd . here , @xmath62 are called the spin hilbert spaces with dimensions @xmath63 , while @xmath64 are referred as multiplicative spaces that account for the different possibilities to obtain a spin-@xmath65 state .",
    "they are generally of a much larger dimension , cf .",
    "( [ eq : dimk ] ) .",
    "permutationally invariant states have a simpler form on this hilbert space decomposition , namely @xmath66 with density operators @xmath67 called spin states and according probabilities @xmath68 .",
    "thus a permutationally invariant density operator only contains non - trivial parts on the spin hilbert spaces while carrying no information on the multiplicative spaces .",
    "note further that there are no coherences between different spin states .",
    "this means that any permutationally invariant state can be parsed into a block structure as schematically depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : pistate ] .",
    "the main diagonal is built up by unnormalized spin states @xmath69 , which appear several times , the number being equal to the dimension of the corresponding multiplicative space .",
    "this block - decomposition represents a natural way to treat permutationally invariant states and has for example been employed already in the aforementioned related works of permutationally invariant tomography  @xcite but also in other contexts  @xcite .    ) with @xmath69 . ]",
    "this structure shows that if we work with permutationally invariant states we do not need to consider the full density operator but rather that it is sufficient to deal only with this ensemble of spin states .",
    "therefore we identify from now on @xmath70 this provides already an efficient way to store and to visualize such states .",
    "more importantly , it also enables an operational way to characterize valid states , since any permutationally invariant operator @xmath17 represents a true state if and only if all these spin operators @xmath67 are density operators and @xmath68 a probability distribution .",
    "this is in contrast to the generalized bloch vector employed in the original proposal of permutationally invariant tomography  @xcite given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : gen_bloch_vec ] ) , which also provides efficient storage and processing of permutationally invariant states , but where bloch vectors of physical states are not as straightforward to characterize .    via this identification",
    "one can demonstrate once more the origin of the cubic scaling of the permutationally invariant tomography scheme .",
    "the largest spin state is of dimension @xmath71 which requires parameters on the order of @xmath72 for characterization .",
    "since one has on the order of @xmath1 of these states this shows results in a cubic scaling .",
    "fixing the ensemble of spin states as parametrization it is now required to obtain an efficient procedure to compute the probabilities @xmath73 for the optimized measurement scheme .",
    "this is achieved as follows : first let us stress that a similar block decomposition as given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : pi - state1 ] ) holds for all permutationally invariant operators . hence also the measurements @xmath74 given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : pi - measurements ] ) can be cast into this form . using the convention",
    "@xmath75 leads to @xmath76 therefore the problem is shifted to the computation of the spin-@xmath65 operators @xmath77 for each setting @xmath32 . as we show in prop .",
    "[ prop : measurements ] below , using the idea that measurements can be transformed into each other by a local operation @xmath78 this provides the relation @xmath79 here @xmath80 corresponds to the measurement in the standard basis ( that need to be computed once ) and @xmath81 is a unitary transformation determined by the rotation @xmath82 .",
    "this connection is given by @xmath83 where @xmath84 stands for the spin operators in dimension @xmath85 .",
    "this finally provides the efficient way to compute probabilities .      as a second step one still needs to cope with the optimization itself .",
    "although there are different numerical routines for statistical state reconstruction like maximum likelihood @xcite or least squares  @xcite , we prefer non - linear convex optimization @xcite to obtain the final solution .",
    "quantum state reconstruction problems are known to be convex  @xcite , but convex optimization has hardly been used for this task . however , convex optimization possesses several advantages : first of all it is a systematic approach that works for any convex fit function , including maximum likelihood and least squares .",
    "in contrast to other algorithms such as the fixed - point algorithm proposed in ref .  @xcite it gives a precise stopping condition via an appropriate error control ( see , however ref .",
    "@xcite ) and still exploits all the favourable , convex , structure in comparison to re - parametrization ideas as in ref .",

    "the optimization given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : convex_opti ] ) can be performed for instance with the help of a barrier function  @xcite  . rather than considering the constrained problem",
    "one solves the unconstrained convex task given by @xmath92 - t \\log[\\det\\rho(x)],\\ ] ] where the constraint is now directly included in the objective function .",
    "this so - called barrier term acts precisely as its name suggests : if one tries to leave the strictly feasible set , _",
    "i.e. _ , all parameters @xmath93 that satisfy @xmath94 , one always reaches a point where at least one of the eigenvalues vanishes .",
    "since the barrier term is large within this neighbourhood , in fact singular at the crossing , it penalizes points close to the border and thus ensures that one searches for an optimum well inside the region where the constraint is satisfied . the penalty parameter @xmath95 plays the role of a scaling factor .",

    "small penalty parameters are approached by an iterative process : for a given starting point @xmath102 and a certain value of the parameter @xmath103 one solves eq .",

    "then each unconstrained problem can be solved very efficiently since one starts already quite close to the true solution .",
    "let us point out that via the above mentioned barrier method one additionally obtains solutions to the hedged state reconstruction with @xmath108 since the unconstrained problem given by eq .",

    "i.e. _ , tomography should work for all states that remain invariant under the action of a specific group .",
    "clearly any symmetry decreases the number of state dependent parameters , but the challenge is to devise efficient local measurement strategies .",
    "interesting classes here are graph - diagonal  @xcite or , more general , locally maximally entangleable states  @xcite , translation or shift - invariant states  @xcite , or @xmath154 invariant states  @xcite .",
    "third , it is worth to investigate to what extent particularly designed state tomography protocols are useful in further tasks , like process tomography for quantum gates .",
    "for instance , permutationally invariant tomography might be unable to resolve the toffoli gate  @xcite directly , but since the operation on all @xmath1 target qubits is symmetric , a permutationally invariant resolution of this subspace ( and the additional control qubit ) might be sufficient .",
    "finally let us point out that permutationally invariant tomography can be further restricted to the symmetric subspace , which often contains the desired states .",
