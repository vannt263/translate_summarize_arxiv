    "our experiments began with nearly pure @xmath30 becs of around @xmath129 atoms in the @xmath130 state confined in a crossed optical dipole trap .",
    "the trap consisted of a pair of @xmath131 laser beams propagating along @xmath58 ( @xmath132 radii of @xmath133 and @xmath134 ) and @xmath135 ( @xmath132 radii of @xmath136 ) .",
    "the trap frequencies at the end of an evaporation sequence were @xmath137 .",
    "to study collisions beyond @xmath6-wave we prepared colliding bose - einstein condensates in the lowest energy raman - dressed band using the following procedure : ( i ) starting with an @xmath130 bec at rest , a radio - frequency magnetic field , @xmath138 , was ramped on in @xmath139 with an initial detuning @xmath140 ( where @xmath141 , and the detuning @xmath142 was controlled by changing @xmath143 ) and coupling strength @xmath144 ; ( ii ) the detuning was adiabatically ramped to @xmath145 in @xmath146 , and then the radio - frequency coupling strength @xmath147 was decreased to zero in @xmath148 . in the last millisecond of the ramp of @xmath147 the dressed state to which we connect adiabatically is a virtually equal superposition of @xmath149 ; ( iii ) during this final millisecond @xmath48 increased from zero to its final value , creating two spatially overlapping condensates in the ground dressed band with momenta @xmath150 .",
    "the turn - on of the raman beams was adiabatic with respect to inter - band excitation but fast with respect to the trap s @xmath151 quarter - period along @xmath58 .",
    "this ensured the atoms could not change their momentum as @xmath48 was increased @xcite .    to observe @xmath6-wave scattering we prepared the system in the absence of any raman beams .",
    "the bec , initially formed in the @xmath130 state , was transferred to the @xmath53 state by radio - frequency adiabatic rapid passage .",
    "thus the atoms were in the same spin state as for the time - of - flight ( tof ) stage for the higher partial wave data ( see deloading below ) , ensuring that any small distortions of the scattering halo in tof expansion due to stray magnetic field gradients were the same for the @xmath6-wave data and the higher order partial wave data .",
    "two temporally square pulses of a 1d optical lattice along @xmath58 ( formed with @xmath152 light ) were used to split the bec , initially at rest , into @xmath150 orders @xcite .",
    "the dipole trap was switched off ( @xmath50 ) at the end of the second optical lattice pulse , and the resulting atomic distribution absorption - imaged after @xmath54 tof .    to prepare a bec in the highest energy dressed state we first loaded the bec into the lowest energy raman dressed state with zero momentum @xcite .",
    "the bec was then excited to the highest energy dressed state with zero momentum by amplitude modulating the raman beams . for a coupling strength @xmath153 , the amplitude of the raman beams was modulated by @xmath154 ( half peak - to - peak amplitude ) for @xmath155 . during this",

    "the inverse abel transform is appropriate for axially symmetric distributions , which is the case for the scattering products after tof .",
    "the small central cloud of atoms in the images ( fig .",
    "2 ) is due to a residual population of @xmath162 atoms remaining from the loading process into the ground raman - dressed band .",
    "the density of the @xmath162 clouds is small enough that their effect on the scattering halos is negligible .",
    "raman - dressed atoms are in a superposition of spin and momentum states .",
    "when the raman beams were turned off diabatically , the raman - dressed atoms were projected onto a superposition of bare spin states @xmath163 , @xmath164 , @xmath165 , somewhat complicating the atomic distribution in tof . in order to image a single , well - formed scattering halo ,",
    "we adiabatically mapped atoms in the @xmath166 band to the @xmath167 bare state .",
    "this was achieved by ramping the detuning of the raman beams from @xmath168 to @xmath169 ( for which the raman - dressed states coincide nearly perfectly with pure spin states ) .",

    "is possible as discussed in the main body of the paper and shown in fig .",
    "the total elastic scattering cross section is given by the sum of cross sections of each partial wave contribution , however the total collision cross section does not increase when the atomic interactions are modified by the laser dressing .",
    "this is because rather than adding @xmath13-wave and @xmath38-wave contributions on top of the @xmath6-wave scattering component , the interactions are modified such that part of the @xmath6-wave contribution is renormalized to @xmath13- and @xmath38-wave contributions .",
    "the total collision cross section is in fact generally smaller than the bare state collision cross section , due to the partial ( spin - dependent ) overlap between the initial and final scattering states .",
    "the modified density of states in the presence of laser dressing also reduces the number of final states for a particle to scatter into .",
    "the density of states on the scattering halo is purely geometric in origin and depends on the coupling strength @xmath48 , which determines the shape of the scattering halo through the modified dispersion relation @xmath185 .",
    "since @xmath48 is measured ( see below ) for each scattering halo , one can calculate the form of the density of states and remove its effect from the measured atomic signal , revealing the underlying anisotropic atomic distribution due to the modification of the interaction potential by the response function @xmath186 . the uncertainty introduced by dividing out the density of states",
    "is set by the uncertainty in @xmath48 , from which the bandstructure and hence the density of states are calculated .",
    "the raman coupling strength was measured using a raman pulsing technique @xcite . the uncertainty ( standard deviation ) in @xmath48 from this measurement",
    "was @xmath187 , translating to a comparable or smaller uncertainty in the extracted partial wave amplitude ( determined by carrying out the partial wave fitting procedure on data which had been normalized to the density of states calculated for @xmath188 ) .",

    "these excited bands are of intrinsic interest , for example in schemes considering oppositely - charged particles in synthetic gauge fields or proposals for generating non - abelian gauge fields for ultracold atoms , which rely on two excited dressed states ( see @xcite and references therein ) .    in order to measure the lifetime in the @xmath200 band we excited a bec in the @xmath204 state to the @xmath205 state as described above .",

    "a double exponential fit of the form @xmath207 was used to the extract the initial decay time of @xmath208 .",
    "we attribute the slower decay , @xmath209 , to the depletion of excited state bec and subsequent decay of the lower density thermal atoms .",
    "note that in the limit of very large raman coupling , @xmath210 , ( which was outside our range of available laser powers ) the matrix element for these band - changing collisions tends to zero , and long lifetimes in the excited state should be possible .",
    "it would also be possible to suppress collisional losses from the excited state at lower @xmath48 by modifying the final density of states , for example , by the use of an optical lattice to open band gaps at the relevant energies .      that the response function @xmath28 depends on the initial and final momenta of the colliding particles implies that an effective real space potential describing the screened collisions can no longer be represented by a dirac @xmath22-function but has some finite range .",
    "furthermore , the effective interaction potential is long - ranged only along the direction specified by the raman beams ( which can in general be different from the collision axis ) .    in order to qualitatively understand the size of this range it is useful to consider two limiting situations .",
    "firstly , atoms scattering with a small momentum difference , @xmath211 , have nearly the same bare spin composition .",
    "secondly , particles with a large momentum , @xmath212 , are unaltered by the raman coupling . in either case , @xmath213 and the atoms collide as they did absent raman coupling ( _ 17 _ ) . for intermediate momenta @xmath214",
    "there is significant dressing - altered scattering , giving a range @xmath215 , to the effective interaction potential , with @xmath216 for our experiment .",
    "this expression is valid in the limit @xmath217 , required for restricting atoms to the lowest band for our collision energies . whereas slowly moving atoms experience @xmath6-wave , scattering higher partial waves are possible at slightly larger velocities .",
    "this is because the range of the effective potential is much larger than that of the real potential , and hence the velocity for which higher partial waves become important is proportionally smaller .    to gain further insight into the nature of the real space representation of the effective interaction potential",
    "a quantitative analysis is necessary .",
    "an analytical approximation to the real space screened potential can be found for @xmath218 . while this is not the case for the experiments described in this paper ( where @xmath219 ) , this limiting case is useful for pedagogical reasons .",
    "the form of the real space potential for general @xmath220 can be solved numerically and has a similar form to the analytical solution we derive below .    in the following discussion",

    "perhaps the most unusual aspect of this potential is that while momentum is still conserved , galilean invariance is not .",
    "this breakdown of galilean invariance is common in screening problems where there is a preferred reference frame . in this case , rapidly moving atoms are doppler shifted from raman resonance and the effects of the laser coupling vanish .          because this is only a function of the differences @xmath233 and @xmath234 , it has recovered galilean invariance , but only when @xmath235 ( expressed in terms of experimental variables ) is small . in our collision experiment , @xmath236 .",

    "<S> along with the modification of scattering halo shape , the distribution of atoms on the scattering surface is also changed . </S>",
    "<S> two main effects determine the distribution of atoms : ( i ) the anisotropic final density of states ( dos ) @xmath63 , and ( ii ) effective higher - order partial waves in the binary collision process . </S>",
    "<S> the first effect , resulting from the shape of the scattering halo as determined by @xmath60 , would occur in an identical scattering experiment with spinless bosons subject to the same energy - momentum dispersion relation . the second effect , described by the response function @xmath28 of eq .  </S>",
    "<S> [ responsefunction ] , is a consequence of the momentum - dependent spin structure of raman - dressed atoms leading to effective beyond _ s_-wave interactions , and is the central result of this paper .    </S>",
    "<S> these independent effects may be quantified with fermi s golden rule ( fgr ) . for two colliding atoms the scattering rate from the initial state @xmath64 into the final state @xmath65 is @xmath66 @xmath67 , dependent on both the final dos @xmath68 and the transition matrix element @xmath69 describing the screened potential @xmath70 . here </S>",
    "<S> @xmath71 is the many - body vacuum , and @xmath72 describes the annihilation of a raman - dressed atom with wave vector @xmath73 . </S>",
    "<S> the dependence of the matrix element on the response function @xmath28 gives rise to effective higher order partial wave scattering @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the contributions of the dos and the matrix element to the anisotropic nature of the scattering rate @xmath74 are of comparable magnitude .    </S>",
    "<S> figure  3a shows the peak signal as a function of polar angle @xmath75 extracted from the inverse abel transform for several different @xmath48 , normalized to the anisotropic dos @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this normalization removes all anisotropies except those resulting from beyond @xmath6-wave scattering , which we quantify by fitting the data with the partial - wave expansion @xcite , @xmath76 , where the fit parameter , @xmath77 , is the phase shift of the @xmath78 partial wave , @xmath79 is the legendre polynomial of order @xmath80 , and @xmath81 is an overall scaling factor ( e.g. , dependent on the initial condensate densities and their interaction time ) . </S>",
    "<S> the peak signal @xmath82 is proportional to @xmath74 . </S>",
    "<S> the fit was restricted to the angular range @xmath83 which excluded the regions close to the unscattered clouds . </S>",
    "<S> these regions showed an increase in atom number beyond that expected , even for pure _ s_-wave scattering between bare spin states , possibly because of multiple scattering events or bose stimulation .    </S>",
    "<S> figure  3b displays the _ d_- and _ g_-wave amplitudes ( normalized to the _ s_-wave amplitude ) as a function of @xmath48 , obtained from fits as in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 3a , where the fractional amplitude of the @xmath84 partial wave is @xmath85 . at @xmath86 </S>",
    "<S> , we find a fractional @xmath13-wave amplitude of @xmath87 for collision temperature @xmath88 , where @xmath89 is the reduced mass of the colliding particles and @xmath90 their relative velocity . by comparison , two previous experiments @xcite , which studied the scattering of @xmath30 in a bare spin state , did not find comparable @xmath13-wave magnitudes until @xmath91 . </S>",
    "<S> the solid lines show the theoretical prediction for the fractional partial wave amplitudes , calculated from a partial wave expansion of the matrix element @xmath69 . </S>",
    "<S> figure  3b highlights that the engineered effective interaction potentials are not only long - ranged but also tunable ; by changing @xmath48 we controlled both the magnitude and sign of the @xmath13-wave phase shift .    </S>",
    "<S> we now consider collisions between atoms in the highest energy @xmath92 raman - dressed band . </S>",
    "<S> although spin - changing collisions of bare atoms hardly occur in @xmath30 , strong band - changing transitions of dressed atoms are in general permitted @xcite . to study this effect we investigated the ( energetically allowed ) collision - induced transitions of atoms to lower bands </S>",
    "<S> we considered collisions in a single bec ( so atoms collided at extremely low relative momenta ) and observed the spatial distribution of the collision products after tof .    </S>",
    "<S> we prepared a bec in the highest energy dressed state with zero momentum @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> figure  4b shows atoms in the @xmath93 ( intermediate energy ) band which have decayed from the excited band by the processes indicated in fig </S>",
    "<S> .  4a . </S>",
    "<S> scattered atoms exhibited a node in the @xmath94 plane , a dramatic manifestation of beyond _ </S>",
    "<S> s_-wave scattering . </S>",
    "<S> the inner halo ( i ) is due to a process where one atom in a colliding pair undergoes an inelastic transition to the @xmath93 band while the other scattered atom remains in the @xmath92 band . as the scattering products are distinguished by their band index , the spatial wave function need not be symmetric with respect to exchange , and the scattered wave function can in principle have contributions from all partial waves . </S>",
    "<S> however , only effective @xmath12-wave and higher odd partial wave components are permitted due to the underlying symmetry of the hamiltonian .    </S>",
    "<S> our technique for modifying atomic interactions has significant ramifications for systems of ultracold atoms , bosons and fermions alike . </S>",
    "<S> possible new effects induced by synthetic higher - order partial wave interactions in a harmonically trapped bec could include roton features in the excitation spectrum @xcite , crystalline ordering @xcite , supersolidity @xcite , or even the support of 2d solitons @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , collisions in this experiment are subject to a new kind of resonance phenomena . </S>",
    "<S> as the collision energy approaches the inter - band spacing , virtual excitations to the higher band can greatly modify the collisional properties beyond the effects described here .    </S>",
