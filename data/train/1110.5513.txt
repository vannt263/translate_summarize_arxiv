    "fekete points_. they are defined to be those points that maximize the ( absolute value of the ) vandermonde determinant on the given compact set . however , these are known analytically only in a few instances ( the interval and the complex circle for univariate interpolation , the cube for tensor product interpolation ) , and are very difficult to compute , requiring an expensive and numerically challenging nonlinear multivariate optimization",
    ".    _ admissible meshes _ ( shortly am ) , introduced by calvi and levenberg in @xcite , are sets of points in a given compact domain @xmath2 which are nearly optimal for least - squares approximation , and contain interpolation points that distribute asymptotically as fekete points of the domain .",
    "this theory has given new insight to the ( partial ) solution of the problem of extracting good interpolation point in dimension @xmath3 . in all practical applications , instead of am , people look for low - cardinality admissible meshes , called _ weakly admissible meshes _ or wam ( cf .",
    "the recent survey @xcite ) .",
    "the extremal sets of our interest are the _ approximate fekete points _",
    "( afp ) and _ discrete leja points _ ( dlp ) . as described in @xcite , afp and dlp can be easily computed by using basic tools of numerical linear algebra . in practice , ( weakly )",
    "admissible meshes and discrete extremal sets allow us to replace a continuous compact set by a discrete version , that is `` just as good '' for all practical purposes .    in this paper , we focus on afp and dlp extracted from weakly admissible meshes of the rectangular cylinder @xmath4 $ ] , with @xmath1 the unit disk .",
    "these points are then used for computing interpolants , least - square approximants and cubatures of functions defined on the cylinder .",
    "we essentially provide afp and dlp of the cylinder that , to our knowledge , have never been investigated so far .",
    "polynomial determining _ compact set @xmath5 or @xmath6 ( i.e. , polynomials vanishing there are identically zero ) , a weakly admissible mesh ( wam ) is defined in @xcite to be a sequence of discrete subsets @xmath7 such that @xmath8 @xmath9 being the set of @xmath10-variate polynomials of degree at most @xmath11 on @xmath12 , where both @xmath13 and @xmath14 grow at most _ polynomially _ with @xmath11 , i.e. card@xmath15 , for some fixed @xmath16 depending only on @xmath12 .",
    "when @xmath17 is bounded we speak of an admissible mesh ( am ) .",
    "we use the notation @xmath18 for @xmath19 a bounded function on the compact @xmath12 .",
    "wams enjoy the following ten properties ( already enumerated in @xcite and proved in @xcite ) : 0.3 cm * p1 : * @xmath17 is invariant under affine mapping + * p2 : * any sequence of unisolvent interpolation sets whose lebesgue constant grows at most polynomially with @xmath11 is a wam , @xmath17 being the lebesgue constant itself + * p3 : * any sequence of supersets of a wam whose cardinalities grow polynomially with @xmath11 is a wam with the same constant @xmath17 + * p4 : * a finite union of wams is a wam for the corresponding union of compacts , @xmath17 being the maximum of the corresponding constants + * p5 : * a finite cartesian product of wams is a wam for the corresponding product of compacts , @xmath17 being the product of the corresponding constants + * p6 : * in @xmath20 a wam of the boundary @xmath21 is a wam of @xmath12 ( by the maximum principle ) + * p7 : * given a polynomial mapping @xmath22 of degree @xmath23 , then @xmath24 is a wam for @xmath25 with constants @xmath26 ( cf .",
    "* prop.2 ) ) + * p8 : * any @xmath12 satisfying a markov polynomial inequality like @xmath27 has an am with @xmath28 points ( cf .",
    "* thm.5 ) ) + * p9 : * least - squares polynomial approximation of @xmath29 : the least - squares polynomial @xmath30 on a wam is such that @xmath31 ( cf .",
    "* thm.1 ) ) + * p10 : * fekete points : the lebesgue constant of fekete points extracted from a wam can be bounded like @xmath32 ( that is the elementary classical bound of the continuum fekete points times a factor @xmath17 ) ; moreover , their asymptotic distribution is the same of the continuum fekete points , in the sense that the corresponding discrete probability measures converge weak-@xmath33 to the pluripotential equilibrium measure of @xmath12 ( cf .",
    "* thm.1 ) ) .",
    "pluripotential theory has been widely studied by m. klimek in the monograph @xcite , to which interested readers should refer for more details .",
    "0.3 cm it is worth noticing that in the very recent papers @xcite , the authors have provided new techniques for finding admissible meshes with low cardinality , by means of analytical transformations of domains . 0.2 in examples of wams",
    "can be found in @xcite . here",
    ", we simply recall some one dimensional and two dimensional wams .    1 .",
    "the set @xmath34 of @xmath35 _ chebyshev - lobatto _ points for the interval @xmath36 $ ] , is a one - dimensional wam of degree @xmath11 with @xmath37 and card@xmath38 .",
    "this follows from property * p2*. 2 .",
    "the set @xmath39 of the _ padua points _ of degree @xmath11 of the square @xmath40 ^ 2 $ ] is the set defined as follows ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) @xmath41 where @xmath42 notice that here we refer to the first family of padua points .",
    "@xmath43 is then a two - dimensional wam with @xmath44 and card@xmath45 .",
    "this is a consequence of property * p2 * since , as shown in @xcite , the padua points are a unisolvent set for polynomial interpolation in the square with minimal order of growth of their lebesgue constant , i.e. @xmath46 .",
    "3 .   the sequence of _ polar symmetric grids _",
    "@xmath47 with the radii and angles defined as follows @xmath48 are wams for the closed unit disk @xmath49 , with constant @xmath50 and cardinality card@xmath51 for odd @xmath11 and card@xmath52 for even @xmath11 ( cf .",
    "moreover , since these wams contain the chebyshev - lobatto points of the vertical diameter @xmath53 only for @xmath11 odd ( whereas it always contains the chebyshev - lobatto points of the horizontal diameter @xmath54 ) , and thus is not invariant under rotations by an angle @xmath55 .",
    "hence in order to have a wams on the disk invariant by rotations of @xmath55 , we have to modify the choice of radii and angles in ( [ eq1 ] ) as follows @xmath56 in this way the obtained wam is now invariant with card@xmath51 also for @xmath11 even .",
    "we considered two meshes : the first one uses a symmetric polar grid in the disk @xmath1 and chebyshev - lobatto points along @xmath57 $ ] ; the second one uses padua points on the @xmath58 plane and equispaced points along the circumference of @xmath1 .",
    "we consider the set @xmath59 with @xmath60 and @xmath61 that is @xmath62 the cardinality of @xmath63 , both for @xmath11 even and @xmath11 odd , is @xmath64 . indeed , let us consider first the case of @xmath11 even .",
    "the points on the disk , subtracting the repetitions of the center , which are @xmath65 , are @xmath66 .",
    "all these points are then multiplied by the corresponding @xmath35 chebyshev - lobatto points along the third axis @xmath67 , giving the claimed cardinality .",
    "when @xmath11 is odd , there are no coincident points , thus we have @xmath68 points on the disk .",
    "then , considering the @xmath35 chebyshev - lobatto points along the third axis , we get the claimed results .    finally , the set @xmath63 so defined , is a wam since it is the cartesian product of a two dimensional wam ( the points on the disk ) and the one dimensional wam of the chebyshev - lobatto points .",
    "the property * p5 * gives the constant @xmath69 ( see figure [ fig1 ] for the case @xmath70 ) .",
    "this discretization is obtained by taking the padua points @xmath43 on the plane @xmath71 , rotated @xmath11 times along @xmath67-axis by a constant angle @xmath72 . in this way , along the bottom circumference of the cylinder , we obtain @xmath73 equispaced points .",
    "this is due to the fact that the points with coordinates @xmath74 and @xmath75 are padua points . in details ,",
    "the mesh is the set @xmath59 with @xmath76 and @xmath77 , that is @xmath78 this mesh has cardinality @xmath79 .",
    "in fact , when @xmath11 is even , the points are @xmath80 from which we have to subtract the repetitions @xmath81 , corresponding to the @xmath82 padua points with abscissa @xmath83 counted @xmath11 times .",
    "then , the points so generated are @xmath84 . on the contrary , when @xmath11 is odd , there are no intersections and so the total number of points is @xmath85 ( see figure [ fig1 ] for the case @xmath86 ) .",
    "we now prove that this mesh is indeed a wam . to this aim , consider a generic polynomial of degree at most @xmath11 defined on the cylinder @xmath87 .",
    "for a fixed angle @xmath88 , @xmath89 is a polynomial of degree at most @xmath11 in @xmath90 , while it is a trigonometric polynomial in @xmath91 of degree at most @xmath11 for fixed values of @xmath71 .",
    "since on the generic rectangle @xmath71 we have considered the set of padua points of degree @xmath11 which is a wam , say @xmath92 , hence , we can write @xmath93 where @xmath94 does not depend on @xmath88 . let @xmath95 be the maximum .",
