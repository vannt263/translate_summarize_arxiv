    "we have proposed several models @xcite possessing interesting dynamics relevant for collider phenomenology @xcite and cosmology @xcite .",
    "the structure of one of these models , known as minimal walking technicolor , has led to the construction of a new supersymmetric extension of the sm featuring the maximal amount of supersymmetry in four dimension with a clear connection to string theory , i.e. minimal super conformal technicolor @xcite .",
    "these models are also being investigated via first principle lattice simulations @xcite .",
    "an up - to - date review is ref . while an excellent review updated till 2003",
    "these are also among the most challenging models to work with since they require deep knowledge of gauge dynamics in a regime where perturbation theory fails .",
    "in particular , it is of utmost importance to gain information on the nonperturbative dynamics of non - abelian four dimensional gauge theories .",
    "the phase diagram of @xmath1 gauge theories as functions of number of flavors , colors and matter representation has been investigated in @xcite .",
    "the analytical tools which will be used here for such an exploration are : i ) the conjectured _ physical _ all orders beta function for nonsupersymmetric gauge theories with fermionic matter in arbitrary representations of the gauge group @xcite ;",
    "ii ) the truncated schwinger - dyson equation ( sd ) @xcite ( referred also as the ladder approximation in the literature ) ; the appelquist - cohen - schmaltz ( acs ) conjecture @xcite which makes use of the counting of the thermal degrees of freedom at high and low temperature .",
    "these are the methods which we have used in our investigations .",
    "however several very interesting and competing analytic approaches @xcite have been proposed in the literature .",
    "what is interesting is that despite the very different starting point the various methods agree qualitatively on the main features of the various conformal windows presented here .",
    "recently we have conjectured an all orders beta function which allows for a bound of the conformal window @xcite of @xmath1 gauge theories for any matter representation .",
    "the predictions of the conformal window coming from the above beta function are nontrivially supported by all the recent lattice results @xcite .",
    "in @xcite we further assumed the form of the beta function to hold for @xmath2 and @xmath3 gauge groups and further extended in @xcite to chiral gauge theories .",
    "consider a generic gauge group with @xmath4 dirac flavors belonging to the representation @xmath5 of the gauge group .",
    "the conjectured beta function reads : @xmath6 with @xmath7 the generators @xmath8 of the gauge group in the representation @xmath9 are normalized according to @xmath10 = t(r ) \\delta^{ab}$ ] while the quadratic casimir @xmath11 is given by @xmath12 .",
    "the trace normalization factor @xmath13 and the quadratic casimir are connected via @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the dimension of the representation @xmath9 .",
    "the adjoint representation is denoted by @xmath16 .",
    "the beta function is given in terms of the anomalous dimension of the fermion mass @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the renormalized mass , similar to the supersymmetric case @xcite .",
    "the loss of asymptotic freedom is determined by the change of sign in the first coefficient @xmath19 of the beta function .",
    "this occurs when @xmath20 at the zero of the beta function we have @xmath21 hence , specifying the value of the anomalous dimensions at the irfp yields the last constraint needed to construct the conformal window .",
    "having reached the zero of the beta function the theory is conformal in the infrared . for a theory to be conformal",
    "the dimension of the non - trivial spinless operators must be larger than one in order not to contain negative norm states @xcite .",
    "since the dimension of the chiral condensate is @xmath22 we see that @xmath23 , for all representations @xmath24 , yields the maximum possible bound @xmath25 in the case of a single representation this constraint yields @xmath26 the actual size of the conformal window can be smaller than the one determined by the bound above , eq .",

    "it may happen , in fact , that chiral symmetry breaking is triggered for a value of the anomalous dimension less than two . if this occurs the conformal window shrinks .",
    "within the ladder approximation @xcite one finds that chiral symmetry breaking occurs when the anomalous dimension is close to one .",
    "picking @xmath27 we find : @xmath28 in the case of a single representation this constraint yields @xmath29 when considering two distinct representations the conformal window becomes a three dimensional volume , i.e. the conformal _ house _ @xcite .",
    "of course , we recover the results by banks and zaks @xcite valid in the perturbative regime of the conformal window .",
    "we note that the presence of a physical irfp requires the vanishing of the beta function for a certain value of the coupling .",
    "the opposite however is not necessarily true ; the vanishing of the beta function is not a sufficient condition to determine if the theory has a fixed point unless the beta function is",
    "_ physical_. by _ physical _ we mean that the beta function allows to determine simultaneously other scheme - independent quantities at the fixed point such as the anomalous dimension of the mass of the fermions .",
    "this is exactly what our beta function does .",
    "in fact , in the case of a single representation , one finds that at the zero of the beta function one has : @xmath30      for nonsupersymmetric theories another way to get quantitative estimates is to use the _ rainbow _ approximation to the schwinger - dyson equation @xcite . after a series of approximations ( see @xcite for a review ) one deduces for an @xmath1 gauge theory with @xmath31 dirac fermions transforming according to the representation @xmath9 the critical number of flavors above which chiral symmetry maybe unbroken : @xmath32 comparing with the previous result obtained using the all orders beta function we see that it is the coefficient of @xmath33 which is different .",
    "we note that in @xcite it has been advocated a coefficient similar to the one of the all - orders beta function .",
    "the ladder result provides a size of the window , for every fermion representation , smaller than the maximum bound found earlier .",
    "this is a consequence of the value of the anomalous dimension at the lower bound of the window .",
    "the unitarity constraint corresponds to @xmath37 while the ladder result is closer to @xmath38 .",
    "indeed if we pick @xmath39 our conformal window approaches the ladder result .",
    "incidentally , a value of @xmath40 larger than one , still allowed by unitarity , is a welcomed feature when using this window to construct walking technicolor theories .",

    "the actual size of the conformal window matching this possible dual corresponds to setting @xmath37 .",
    "we note that although for @xmath163 and @xmath154 the magnetic gauge group is @xmath125 the theory is not trivially qcd given that it features new massless fermions and their interactions with massless mesonic type fields .",

    "it is easy to check from the results presented that this ratio is not only independent on the representation but also on the particular gauge group chosen .",
    "the four methods we used to unveil the conformal windows are the all orders beta function ( bf ) , the sd truncated equation , the thermal degrees of freedom method and possible gauge - duality .",
    "they have vastly different starting points and there was no , a priori , reason to agree with each other , even at the qualitative level .",
    "several questions remain open such as what happens on the right hand side of the infrared fixed point as we increase further the coupling .",
    "does a generic strongly coupled theory develop a new uv fixed point as we increase the coupling beyond the first ir value @xcite ?",
    "if this were the case our beta function would still be a valid description of the running of the coupling of the constant in the region between the trivial uv fixed point and the neighborhood of the first ir fixed point .",
    "one might also consider extending our beta function to take into account of this possibility as done in @xcite .",
    "it is also possible that no non - trivial uv fixed point forms at higher values of the coupling constant for any value of the number of flavors within the conformal window .",
    "gauge - duals seem to be in agreement with the simplest form of the beta function .",
    "the extension of the all orders beta function to take into account fermion masses has appeared in @xcite .",
