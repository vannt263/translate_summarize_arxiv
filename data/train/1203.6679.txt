    "it is , therefore , a valid question whether @xmath0 collisions also exhibit any behavior of the kind observed in heavy - ion collisions @xcite .",
    "bjorken first suggested the idea of possible deconfinement in @xmath0 collisions @xcite .",
    "it has also been suggested by van hove @xcite and recently by campanini @xcite that an anomalous behavior of average transverse momentum ( @xmath12 ) as a function of multiplicity could be a signal for the occurrence of a phase transition in hadronic matter , _",

    "the hadronic interaction model epos ( partons off - shell remnants and splitting of parton ladders ) , has also been used to describe the production of mqgp features in high energy density @xmath0 collisions @xcite .",
    "another indication of collective phenomena might be the observed long - range , near - side angular correlation ( ridge ) in hm @xmath0 collisions at center - of - mass energy @xmath2 = 7 tev for charged particle multiplicities well above the mean multiplicity .",

    "when looking at particles in a specific range of @xmath15 and high multiplicity ( @xmath16 gev/_c _ and @xmath17 ) , a clear ridge - like structure emerges at @xmath14 @xmath18 0 and @xmath19 , that is not reproduced by existing monte carlo ( mc ) event generators  @xcite .",

    ", the color of these strings is restricted to a small area in transverse space . with increasing energy of the colliding particles , the number of strings grows and they start to overlap , forming clusters this can introduce a possible dependence of particle production on the energy density @xcite .    we have studied  @xcite the effect of strong longitudinal color fields ( slcf ) in @xmath0 collisions up to lhc energies in the framework of the hijing / bb v2.0 model , which combines ( collinear factorized ) pqcd multiple minijet production with soft longitudinal string excitation and hadronization .",
    "the default vacuum string tension , @xmath29 = 1 gev / fm , is replaced by an effective energy dependent string tension , @xmath30 gev / fm that increases monotonically with center - of - mass energy .",
    "the exponent @xmath31 is found to succeed at describing well the energy dependence of multiparticle observables for rhic , tevatron , as well as lhc data @xcite . in the hijing / bb v2.0 model",
    "the rapid growth of @xmath32 at mid - rapidity with energy is due to the interplay of copious minijet production with increasing strong color field contributions .",
    "however , the large ( strange)baryon - to - meson ratios recently measured at lhc energies , especially at @xmath2 = 7 tev , are not well described using this set of parameters .    in this work",
    "we will address this question and in addition we will discuss a possible dependence of the strength of strong color field on the event multiplicity .",
    "we will show that the model predicts a very strong enhancement of ( multi)strange baryon - to - meson ratios in hm events .",

    ", the degree of collectivity is described by the overlap of individual strings ( clusters ) , quantified by the infrared sensitive variable , the string tension ( @xmath1 ) . a reduction mechanism of strange quark suppression was introduced by assuming that the effective string tension increased with increasing reaction energy according to a power law :    @xmath59    where @xmath5 = 1 gev / fm is the vacuum string tension value and @xmath60 = 1 gev@xmath61 is a scale factor .",
    "in addition to describing well the energy dependence of charged particle density at mid - rapidity from sps to lhc energies , we have shown that this dynamical mechanism improves the description of the strange meson / hyperon data at tevatron and lhc energies @xcite .",
    "however , using a set of parameters corresponding to those obtained from eq .",
    "[ eq : eq3 ] , results in an over - prediction of the recently measured yields @xcite of @xmath62 particles ( by up to a factor of two ) and of @xmath26 particles ( by up to a factor of four ) .",
    "a possible reason for this could be a too strong energy dependence used for the mean string tension values ( see eq .",
    "[ eq : eq3 ] ) . therefore ,",
    "here we consider a weaker energy dependence of the form , @xmath63 this leads to a value for the mean string tension of @xmath64  gev / fm at 0.9 tev and @xmath65  gev / fm at 7 tev .",
    "the results obtained using this new parametrization will be discussed in section iii .    because the threshold for strange quark production in a deconfined phase ( or in a mqgp ) is much smaller than in a hadron gas , a larger enhancement in strange particle production has been suggested as an indication of possible mqgp formation @xcite .",
    "equation  [ eq : eq2 ] , which describes strangeness suppression factors @xmath66 , shows that an increased value @xmath1 up to @xmath67 gev / fm leads to a saturation of suppression factors , @xmath66 .",
    "for example , in @xmath0 collisions at 7 tev the suppression factor @xmath66 increases from 0.4 ( corresponding to @xmath68 gev / fm ) to approximately 0.85 ( corresponding to @xmath69 gev / fm ) , and has only a modest further increase up to 0.89 for @xmath70 gev / fm .",
    "therefore , if we assume a different energy density in mb and hm @xmath0 collision events ( corresponding also to a different type of ropes formation ) could lead to different effective @xmath1 values .",

    "[ eq : eq4 ] @xmath1= @xmath71 can be associated with mb events , since it is deduced from inclusive data . for hm events we will assume an extreme value of @xmath72 gev / fm , which corresponds to a saturation of strangeness suppression factors . to better characterize the sensitivity to the parameter @xmath1",
    ", we also present the result corresponding to an intermediate value @xmath1= @xmath73 .",

    "the free and internal energies actually correspond to slow and fast ( relative ) motion of the charges , respectively @xcite .",
    "infrared sensitive variables such as string tension are very helpful to identify specific degrees of freedom of the plasma .",
    "since the confinement of color in non - abelian theories is due to the magnetic degree of freedom , the magnetic component is expected to be present in the plasma as well @xcite . in the presence of the _ chromo - magnetic scenario _",
    "it was shown that the effective string tension of the free energy @xmath1 = @xmath78 decreases with @xmath74 , to near zero at critical temperature ( @xmath79 ) @xcite .",
    "in contrast , the effective string tension of the internal energy ( corresponding to a fast relative motion of the charges ) @xmath1 = @xmath80 remains nonzero below about @xmath81 with a peak value at @xmath79 about 5 times the vacuum tension @xmath82 ( @xmath80 = 5 @xmath82 = 5 gev / fm ) @xcite .",

    "a mini quark - gluon plasma differs from the strong coupling plasma ( sqgp ) produced in central nucleus - nucleus ( @xmath11 ) collisions , mostly by its small initial transverse size @xmath127 fm compared to the significantly larger nuclear transverse size @xmath128 fm .",
    "extensive hydrodynamic  @xcite and transport calculations  @xcite have shown that collective flow signatures , such as perfect fluid elliptic flow , require several fm/_c _ to develop .",

    "therefore , hyperon - to - meson ratios and their @xmath15 dependence may serve as the best probe of possible out of equilibrium mqgp formation .    in order to explore better the enhancement of the baryon / meson production ratio as a possible signature of mqgp in @xmath0 collisions , and especially its possible dependence on event multiplicity ,",

    "the formation of a collective phase in high multiplicity @xmath0 collisions would be made evident within our phenomenology by a relative increase in the baryon / meson ratios with increasing multiplicity , particularly those ratios involving strange and multi - strange particles .",
    "the experimental data could show a multiplicity dependent transition as indicated by comparing results obtained with a lower value of @xmath6 gev / fm to those corresponding to a higher value of @xmath69 gev / fm originating from possible production of a transitory out of equilibrium mqgp phase .",
