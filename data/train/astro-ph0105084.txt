    "an x - ray binary ( xrb ) consists of a compact object  a neutron star or black hole  that is accreting material from another ( companion ) star .",
    "xrbs comprise the brightest class of extrasolar x - ray sources , and have been subjected to nearly four decades of study . in the galaxy ,",
    "about 200 xrbs have been catalogued ( van paradijs 1995 ) and grouped into two major subdivisions : low - mass x - ray binaries ( lmxb ; with companion mass @xmath5 ) and high - mass x - ray binaries ( hmxb ; @xmath6 ) , each with a number of subclassifications in use in the current literature ( white 1989 ) .    in the broadest astronomical context ,",
    "xrbs owe their significance to their status as products of exotic stellar evolution . in a similar vein ,",
    "xrbs provide some of the best opportunities to observe the extreme endpoints of stellar evolution , in which issues such as dense matter and strong gravity come to the fore .",
    "accretion physics plays a role in all of these subject areas  we learn about neutron stars and black holes by watching matter fall onto ( or into ) them . with the advent of spaceborne x - ray detectors with high",
    "spectral resolving power comes new , highly - detailed information to inform our understanding of mass transfer in xrbs . with respect to _ chandra",
    "_ and _ xmm - newton _ , it is too early to provide a thorough review of the advances made possible by these new missions .",
    "we will , therefore , keep the article somewhat general , and concentrate on x - ray spectroscopy and modeling , and leave `` what - we - have - learned '' reviews for the future . a series of review articles covering most of the major topics associated with xrbs is contained in lewin , van paradijs , & van den heuvel ( 1995 )",
    ". a number of earlier review articles concerning the specifics of xrbs are in the literature . among them",
    "are nagase ( 1989 ) , white ( 1989 ) , white & mason ( 1985 ) , and white , swank , & holt ( 1983 ) .",
    "while the source of accretion material in both hmxbs and lmxbs is a nearby companion star , the physical processes by which the material is transferred to the collapsed star differ .",
    "for lmxbs , a gaseous disk mediates the transfer , the disk being fed by roche lobe overflow ; for hmxbs , the uv field of the early - type companion drives a wind through which the accretor moves , sweeping up a small fraction of the wind through gravitational capture .",
    "there are exceptions , and it is worth noting that some hmxbs appear to be powered by roche lobe overflow , so that this classification scheme ( lmxb / disk : hmxb / wind ) is not strictly adhered to .",
    "the best studied xrbs typically have high accretion luminosities ( @xmath1@xmath7 @xmath8 ) , owing to the ready availability of matter to accrete ( large @xmath9 ) and to the compactness of the region in which kinetic energy is converted into high - energy radiation ( @xmath10 ) .    in lmxb accretion disks ,",
    "the nearly circular quasi - keplerian annuli have projected velocities of @xmath11 km s@xmath4 , for inclination angle @xmath12 , where @xmath13 cm ) . in hmxbs , to the extent that we are observing reprocessing in stellar winds , comparable velocities are expected .",
    "large scale velocity fields should broaden the lines , and , in some instances , shift them , as well . with a few exceptions , the ability to measure the effects of velocity fields , made possible by the high resolving power of the @xmath14 reflection grating spectrometer ( rgs ) and , especially , the _ chandra _ high energy transmission grating ( hetg ) , represents a new dimension in x - ray spectroscopy of xrbs , and promises to provide valuable constraints on source models .    even with the highest angular resolution available with x - ray telescopes , xrbs can not be spatially resolved , as they subtend roughly 100 @xmath15arcsec at a distance of 1 kpc .",
    "the x - ray spectrum measured at earth is thus a composite of spectra formed over a large volume and , presumably , over a wide range of physical conditions .",
    "if we assume that the continuum is born pure at its site of formation , then we can think of the interaction of the continuum radiation with the accreting gas as deforming the continuum .",
    "the magnitude of the continuum deformation varies wildly from source to source , and , for a given source , usually varies on observable time scales as well .",
    "the spectral imprinting by circumsource material provides , in principle , a set of handles that observers / analysts can use to construct a physically and geometrically consistent model of the source .",
    "continuum deformation in xrbs is the result of four main types of process : continuum absorption , discrete emission and recombination continuum emission , resonant scattering , and compton scattering .",
    "if local material intervenes with our line of sight to the continuum source , then absorption may alter the shape of the continuum , sometimes producing observable photoelectric edges .",
    "the x - ray irradiated gas in the vicinity of the continuum source radiates lines and continua characteristic of the local conditions .",
    "this gas can also intercept continuum radiation at energies corresponding to atomic level separations .",
    "a photon can be absorbed , and subsequently re - emitted at nearly the same energy , but with a new direction .",
    "this can either add to or subtract from the photon flux propagating toward the observer , depending on the location of the reprocessing gas with respect to the observer s line of sight to the continuum source .",
    "finally , in plasmas in which the abundant elements are stripped of their electrons , compton scattering can regulate the rate of energy exchange between the gas and the radiation field , and can , depending on the compton depth and the electron temperature , produce substantial modification to the spectrum .",
    "the resulting composite spectrum is further modified by its passage through the interstellar medium .",
    "since most xrbs lie near the galactic plane at distances @xmath16 1 kpc , this is significant , in effect `` cutting off '' most sources at wavelengths longward of 2030  .",
    "we emphasize emission - line spectroscopy in this article , and , for the most part , restrict the discussion to the 135   band , since there are no observable atomic features shortward of 1  , and most xrbs can not be observed in the x - ray band at wavelengths longward of 35  .",
    "the key emission processes are briefly described below .    to generalize each of the reaction types ,",
    "we denote by _ core _ an atomic configuration and by _ ( core )  nl _ the same configuration modified by the addition of an electron described by the quantum numbers @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "the symbols @xmath19 and @xmath20 are used for free electrons and photons , respectively .",
    "_ electron - ion impact excitation _",
    "@xmath21    while electron temperatures in x - ray photoionized plasmas are too low ( see  1.3 ) to effectively populate high - lying energy levels by electron impact excitation ( eie ) , this process is often the dominant one in transferring population between closely - spaced levels .",
    "important instances of eie are the collisional de - population of the energy level responsible for the so - called forbidden line in he - like ions ( @xmath22-@xmath23 ) , and the populating of low - lying excited states in l - shell and m - shell ions .",
    "_ radiative recombination _",
    "@xmath24    the outgoing photons are distributed into a continuum  the radiative recombination continuum ( rrc)above the recombination edge ( @xmath25 ) , with a width @xmath26 . in an overionized plasma @xmath27 , which means that the recombination continuum feature is narrow , and appears `` line - like . '' to date , the only identified rrc features have been associated with recombination to the ground level of h - like and he - like ions , but more often recombination leaves an ion in an excited state .",
    "_ dielectronic recombination _ in this two - step process , the first step , radiationless capture , excites an electron belonging to the initial - state ion  no photon is emitted .",
    "@xmath28    in x - ray photoionized plasmas , the core is excited by way of an intrashell transition , such as @xmath29 .",
    "the energy of the ion following capture lies above the first ionization limit .",
    "the ion may , therefore , autoionize .",
    "for example ,    @xmath30 ,    which is , in effect , an elastic scatter when combined with the first step .",
    "alternatively , the ion can emit a photon , leaving the ion with an energy below the first ionization limit ( _ radiative stabilization _ ) , which completes the dielectronic recombination ( dr ) , for example ,    @xmath31 .",
    "dr is not an important process for k - shell ions , but can be the dominant recombination mechanism for l - shell ions . _",
    "radiative cascade _",
    "@xmath32    subsequent to recombination into an excited level , the ion will decay in a series of spontaneous radiative transitions , until it reaches the ground level . at each step",
    "the ion may have access to several decay channels .",
    "the relative probabilities attached to these various channels partly determine the ionic spectrum . at high densities , however , eie can interrupt the cascade , possibly resulting in line ratios that differ noticeably from the low - density limit . for ions with l - shell electrons , cascades following both rr and dr must be considered .",
    "since the post - dr stabilized state can have an excited core , cascades that proceed in the presence of a `` frozen '' excited core are possible , the spectrum of which is distinct from the rr cascade spectrum . since collisional excitation of high - lying states is exceptionally rare in x - ray photoionized plasmas , radiative cascades following recombination are of paramount importance , which can be contrasted to the case of collisionally - ionized plasmas , where , in the context of line spectroscopy , recombination processes are generally treated as details .",
    "_ fluorescence _    @xmath33 @xmath34    a two - step process . here",
    "the initial state `` core '' is written as the composite of a closed @xmath35 shell plus @xmath36 additional bound electrons .",
    "the first step is a k - shell photoionization . in the second step one of the @xmath36 electrons above",
    "the k shell fills the k shell , emitting a characteristic k photon .",
    "if the falling electron originates in @xmath37 ( l shell ) , then the photon is designated k@xmath38 .",
    "the probability that the second step above occurs , rather than autoionization    @xmath39    is called the fluorescence yield , which scales as @xmath40 . owing in part to the rapid scaling with @xmath41 , fluorescence lines from iron are the most commonly observed . in principle , calculating the fluorescence spectrum is a computationally intensive problem .",
    "a full calculation of the k@xmath38 fluorescent spectrum of a few - times - ionized ion would require a determination of the level population distribution of numerous low - lying energy levels , consistent with the local electron density and radiation field .",
    "the fact that many levels can have non - trivial population densities in xrbs not only affects the exact distribution of fluorescent lines but drastically increases the number of radiative and autoionization transitions that need to be calculated . in practice , however , these complications are ignored . in particular ,",
    "the redistribution of k@xmath38 line emission can not be resolved with current instruments .",
    "the effect on fluorescent yields is not known in general ( cf .",
    ", jacobs et al .  1989 ) .",
    "the physical conditions in optically thin x - ray photoionized gas are , for a given ionizing spectrum , conveniently parameterized by the _",
    "ionization parameter_. although there are a number of quantities dubbed `` ionization parameter '' in the literature , most of what follows is discussed in terms of @xmath42 ( tarter , tucker , & salpeter 1969 ) , the use of which is motivated by consideration of the steady - state equations of ionization equilibrium .",
    "let @xmath43 , @xmath44 , and @xmath45 denote the photoionization rate ( s@xmath4 ) of charge state @xmath12 , the collisional ionization rate coefficient ( @xmath46 ) of @xmath12 , and the recombination rate coefficient ( @xmath46 ) of charge state @xmath47 , respectively .",
    "the term @xmath45 accounts for all two - body recombination processes . in steady state the equations of ionization equilibrium",
    "can be written @xmath48 where the temperature dependence of the rate coefficients is indicated .",
    "given the photoionization cross - section @xmath49 and ionization threshold energy @xmath50 of charge state @xmath12 , the photoionization rate for a point source of ionizing continuum can be written @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the spectral shape function , normalized on a suitable energy interval . denoting the integral in eq .",

    "a useful way to think about overionization is that for a given level of ionization the plasma is cool compared to the equilibrium temperature corresponding to collisional ionization equilibrium ( the limit @xmath59 ) .",
    "the simultaneous solution of the set of ionization equations ( eq .",
    "4 ) and the energy equation ( @xmath60 ) gives the @xmath61 relation .",
    "it is found that @xmath44 can usually be neglected for the photoionized plasmas of interest to x - ray spectroscopists .",
    "such plasmas are thus purely x - ray photoionized",

    "( 1998 ) , and kallman & mccray ( 1982 ) . in short ,",
    "photoionization codes are used to determine the effect of a radiation field on a gas of specified chemical composition , and the self - consistent effect that passage through the gas has on the radiation field , including the addition of local sources of radiation .",
    "this entails , among other things , the determination of the charge state distribution and temperature as functions of @xmath42 .",
    "maxwellian electron distributions are assumed , but lte is not .",
    "lte is rarely applicable , owing to the insufficiently high electron densities and the highly - diluted non - planckian radiation fields found in xrbs .",
    "calculations are performed in the spirit of _ detailed level accounting _ , whereby charge state fractions and level populations are calculated by explicit inclusion of all relevant rates into and out of each energy level .",
    "it is found that highly - ionized ions exist over the approximate range 10@xmath62 in @xmath42 ( c.g.s .",
    "below that range recombination lines fall at energies below the x - ray band , but inner - shell fluorescence line emission is still possible . above that range , ions are fully stripped , but hydrogen - like recombination emission is still possible .",
    "recombination spectra are formed primarily in the approximate temperature range @xmath63-@xmath64 k.",
    "one of the themes of this article is the global nature of line formation in xrbs . in other words ,",
    "even simple models of the geometric and physical distribution of gas in xrbs show that lines form over regions comparable in size to the binary systems themselves , often encompassing a broad range of physical conditions . that the volume integral of the line emissivity determines the observed line ratios and line profiles in a non - trivial way",
    "should be kept in mind . attempting to infer the run of physical conditions in a source by solving",
    "the inverse problem using a set of line ratios is problematic when working outside the framework of a particular model of the source .",
    "nevertheless , it is always useful to take advantage of spectral features or line ratios that are , for example , sensitive to temperature or density , in order to provide a starting point for more detailed studies . in this section ,",
    "a few of the available discrete diagnostics are discussed . a more detailed treatment of x - ray spectroscopy of photoionized plasmas , with emphasis on atomic kinetics ,",

    "a more general presentation of x - ray spectroscopy , including discussions of the relevant atomic rates , can be found in mewe ( 1999 ) .",
    "although x - ray line emission in xrbs is likely to originate in photoionized gas , one still seeks explicit confirmation through examination of spectra .",
    "after all , it is conceivable that xrbs contain regions of , for example , shock - heated gas .",
    "the indicator of photoionization dominance is recombination dominance in the emission line spectra of high charge states .",
    "having discerned that the emission mechanism is consistent with pure recombination , one can then appeal to photoionization codes in order to assign a rough value of @xmath42 , from the @xmath65 relationship , and @xmath57 , from the @xmath61 relationship , both derived for the appropriate ionizing continuum . fortunately , there are a few easily recognized spectral signatures of recombination dominance , described below .",

    ", the ratio @xmath66-@xmath67)/i(rrc ) is approximately 1.3 ( liedahl & paerels 1996 ) .",
    "since rrc shapes are determined by @xmath57 , rrc provide a relatively model - independent temperature diagnostic , and can , in principle , be used to check the theoretical @xmath61 relationship .",
    "\\(2 ) _ large g ratio in he - like ions . _",
    "the he - like @xmath68 ratio is defined as the intensity ratio @xmath69 , where @xmath70 and @xmath71 are the intercombination lines @xmath72@xmath73 , @xmath74 is the forbidden line @xmath72@xmath23 , and @xmath75 is the resonance line @xmath72@xmath76 ( gabriel & jordan 1969 ) . in collisional ionization equilibrium @xmath75 is the brightest he - like line , while in photoionization equilibrium in the low - density limit , @xmath74 is the brightest ( pradhan 1985 ; liedahl 1999 ) .",
    "thus a `` by - eye '' examination of the ratio @xmath77 may be sufficient to discern photoionization / recombination dominance . at higher densities , however ( see next section ) , the blend @xmath78 can be brighter than @xmath74 , so , to generalize , the sum @xmath79 is used in the definition of @xmath68 . in short , a large @xmath68 ( @xmath80 - 4 )",

    "decades of solar x - ray observations have familiarized spectroscopists with the fact that bright iron l - shell emission dominates the line spectrum of cosmic - abundance plasmas with temperatures in the @xmath64-@xmath83 k range ( phillips et al .",
    "it was shown by kallman et al .",
    "( 1996 ) , however , that under conditions of overionization , iron l - shell emission is overwhelmed by @xmath84 and rrc emission from k - shell ions of , for example , oxygen , neon , and magnesium .",
    "there are several reasons for this .",
    "perhaps the simplest way to look at it is to think of iron l - shell ions as having unusually large collisional rate coefficients , which help to drive the impressive line fluxes observed in collisionally ionized plasmas , but do not come into play at all in photoionized plasmas .",
    "these calculations have been borne out by the _",
    "observation of the hmxb vela x-1 during eclipse ( nagase et al .",
    "1994 ) , which shows a spectrum dominated by h - like and he - like ions .",
    "in fact , sako et al .",
    "( 1999 ) achieved satisfactory fits to the data using an otherwise detailed spectral model for which iron l - shell spectra were entirely absent .",
    "recombination spectra also affect iron l - shell ratios ( liedahl et al .",
    "1990 ) but it appears that use of these ratios may have to wait for instruments of higher sensitivity .      we have already remarked on the use of he - like ions to discriminate between collisional ionization and photoionization .",
    "they are also well known density diagnostics ( gabriel & jordan 1969 ) .",
    "the useful ratio is denoted by @xmath85 , and is defined as @xmath86 , where @xmath70 , @xmath71 , and @xmath74 were defined in the previous section .",
    "the @xmath74 line is a slow magnetic dipole transition , so that as @xmath87 increases , collisional depopulation of the @xmath23 level begins to compete with radiative decay .",
    "the density at which the rates of these two depopulation mechanisms are equal is called the critical density @xmath88 .",
    "the dominant sinks for the outgoing population flux are the three @xmath89 levels , two of which can decay to ground , producing the @xmath70 and @xmath71 lines .",

    "the variation of @xmath85 is greatest for the two orders of magnitude in @xmath87 centered on @xmath88 . below this range",
    ", one would observe @xmath92 , and assign an upper limit to @xmath87 . above this range , @xmath93 , and a lower limit",
    "can be assigned .",
    "the ground state transitions of he - like ions of c , n , o , ne , mg , si , s , ar , ca , and fe fall into the x - ray band .",
    "both @xmath91 and @xmath88 vary with @xmath41 ( pradhan 1982 ) , and obtaining their theoretical values requires detailed solutions of the rate equations ( bautista & kallman 2000 ; porquet & dubau 2000 ) .",
    "in particular , @xmath88 increases with @xmath41 , ranging from @xmath94 @xmath95 for @xmath96 to @xmath97 @xmath95 for fe xxv .",
    "to the extent that the various he - like spectra are present in a given set of data , density information is available over a broad region of @xmath87@xmath42 parameter space .",
    "the prevalence of he - like ions in highly - ionized plasmas , the relative simplicity of calculating he - like spectra , and their sensitivity to plasma conditions has made them the pre - eminent diagnostics in x - ray spectroscopy . however , a complication that was noted early on in the study of he - like spectra is now being revisited , one which may compromise the use of the @xmath85 diagnostic in some systems , notably xrbs . the collisional transitions that are crucial to the density sensitivity of he - like ions",
    ", @xmath98 are all electric dipole transitions , and can be driven equally well by photons .",
    "the wavelengths corresponding to the energy separation of the @xmath23 and @xmath99 levels , to take an example , are 1634  , 1273  , and 868  , for o , ne , and si , respectively . a bright uv source in the vicinity of the x - ray emission - line regions can thus have the effect of mimicking the signature of high electron density .",
    "the possible influence of uv radiation on @xmath85 was pointed out by gabriel & jordan ( 1969 ) for solar applications , where it was found that only c v should be affected by photospheric uv emission , and by blumenthal , drake , & tucker ( 1972 ) , who emphasized that , for example , the presence of a moderately hot white dwarf could drive the @xmath85 ratio to low values .",
    "this has obvious implications for hmxbs , in which o and b stars reside , and lmxbs , in which an accretion disk emits copious uv radiation .",
    "it was argued by kahn et al .",
    "( 2001 ) that the low values of @xmath85 observed in the isolated o supergiant @xmath100 pup are consequences of uv driving , rather than high densities , consistent with expectations that stellar winds are too tenuous for the collisional depopulation of the @xmath23 level to matter .",
    "however , if our expectations are that densities _ should _ be high enough for the collisional mechanism to work , and a uv source is also present , a genuine `` degeneracy '' occurs .",
    "this may be the case in lmxbs ( liedahl et al .",
    "1992 ) and some classes of cataclysmic variable .",
    "what is needed is another x - ray density diagnostic , one that is not susceptible to uv driving , and one for which the critical density lies in an interesting part of parameter space .",
    "one such candidate is the ne - like fe xvii 17.10/17.05 ratio ( @xmath101 @xmath95 ) , which appears to be immune to the influence of few - ev planckian radiation fields ( mauche , liedahl , & fournier , in preparation ) .",
    "the x - ray spectra of xrbs are almost completely dominated by continuum radiation , most of which is thought to be produced through conversion of the gravitational potential energy of the accreted material into radiation .",
    "apart from the nearly ubiquitous iron k complex , detections of discrete line emission have , prior to _ asca _ , been difficult to obtain , owing to the limited sensitivity of x - ray spectrometers , and partly to the small intrinsic equivalent widths of the emission lines . in the case of hmxbs , where most of the soft x - ray line emission originates from an extended stellar wind ,",
    "the mass - loss rates of the companion stars are typically @xmath102 , which implies photoelectric optical depths @xmath103 for most of the relevant charge states . in lmxbs , where the lines are produced near the surface of an accretion disk ,",
    "the solid angle subtended by the disk at the continuum source is @xmath1040.2 .",
    "thus in either case only a small fraction of the source x - ray luminosity leaves the system in the form of discrete x - ray emission .",
    "still , recent observations of hmxbs and lmxbs with high - sensitivity , high - resolution spectrometers show discrete features that can be used to constrain models of the structure of the accretion flow around compact objects ( brandt & schulz 2000 ; cottam et al .",
    "2001 ) .    despite the large variety of xrbs ,",
    "all of them have one common property ",
    "they emit strong continuum radiation over several decades in energy .",
    "the x - ray luminosities of persistent xrbs are intrinsically variable , and range anywhere from ( typically ) @xmath105 during the low state to as high as the eddington luminosity of a @xmath106 . in black hole x - ray novae ,",
    "the range in x - ray luminosities is more dynamic , with quiescent luminosities as low as @xmath107 ( garcia et al .",
    "2000 ) . a large fraction of xrbs , however , are persistent x - ray sources .    the intrinsic continuum shape and the location of the source determine the ionization and thermal structure of the surrounding photoionized medium , and , as such , are important for interpreting the associated emission / absorption line features imprinted on the continuum spectrum . on the other hand ,",
    "these structures do not depend on the physical mechanism responsible for the production of the primary continuum radiation .",
    "therefore , the line spectrum can not be used to infer _ how _ the continuum is generated .    from an observational point - of - view ,",
    "the spectral shape of the continuum radiation from xrbs is well - understood , in the sense that they can be reproduced by relatively simple mathematical prescriptions . in neutron star hmxbs , for example",
    ", the x - ray continuum can usually be described by a single power law with photon indices in the range @xmath108 = 1.22.0 , with an exponential cut - off at energies above @xmath109 kev , and @xmath19-folding energies of @xmath11030 kev ( nagase 1989 ) .",
    "a possible physical interpretation of this spectrum is unsaturated comptonization of soft seed photons as they travel through a hot , fully - ionized medium .",
    "when the observed spectrum covers a wide enough range in energy , measurements of the power - law slope and the cut - off energy provide simultaneous estimates of the electron temperature and optical depth of the comptonizing medium , as demonstrated by eardley , lightman , & shapiro ( 1975 ) and sunyaev & titarchuk ( 1980 ) using the hard x - ray continuum spectrum observed in the hmxb cygnus x-1 .",
    "most hmxbs contain pulsars , which makes the radiation field anisotropic as well as time - dependent .",
    "the illuminated circumsource medium , therefore , responds to either the instantaneous flux or the time - averaged flux , depending on the gas density and the pulse - period .",
    "electron cyclotron absorption and/or emission features are also seen in the hard x - ray spectra of many hmxbs , and can be used to estimate the magnetic field strength of the neutron star ( trmper et al .  1978 ; wheaton et al .  1979 )    in lmxbs , single - component continuum models usually do not provide adequate fits to the data ( see white , nagase , & parmar 1995 and references therein ) .",
    "the spectrum , instead , typically consists of a cut - off power law similar to those seen in hmxbs , but with an additional blackbody component with temperatures of @xmath111 , the latter presumably originating from the boundary layer between the accretion disk and the neutron star surface . in many cases , the blackbody component is observed to be more variable than the comptonized component , implying that it is not the source of seed photons for comptonization ( white , peacock , & taylor 1985 ) . there is also evidence for the blackbody component to be point - like , whereas the harder comptonized spectrum originates from a more extended region ( church et al .",
    "1998 ) , providing further support for the picture described above .",
    "mitsuda et al.(1984 ) demonstrated that the use of multi - colored blackbody models ( as a replacement for the comptonized component ) provide constraints on the inner radius of the emitting region .",
    "however , white , stella , & parmar ( 1988 ) argue that multi - colored blackbody emission models do not provide adequate descriptions of the spectra of most lmxbs , and are , moreover , physically implausible , since electron scattering should modify the shapes of the intrinsic spectra ( shakura & sunyaev 1973 ) .",
    "the fact that the continuum shape can be parametrized by simple phenomenological models makes it difficult to infer the physical mechanisms responsible for continuum radiation production .",
    "various physical models can produce continuum spectra of similar shape , and the data usually can not be used to distinguish between different models , especially when the data cover a relatively narrow band pass ( e.g. , vacca et al .",
    "for example , a @xmath112 bremsstrahlung spectrum can not be distinguished from comptonized emission in a mildly compton thick medium .",
    "if each of the components are absorbed through different ( or time varying ) column densities , the continuum parameters derived under the assumption of a single absorbing column may provide purely empirical results that have little to do with reality .",
    "sometimes , the degeneracy can be broken by studying the temporal behavior of the continuum during the various spectral states , as well as quasi - periodic oscillations ( qpos ) in different energy bands .",
    "many theoretical models have been developed in an attempt to unify the global spectrum and the temporal behavior of xrbs . for disk accretion onto weakly - magnetized neutron stars lamb ( 1989 ) , lamb & miller ( 1995 ) , and psaltis , lamb , & miller ( 1995 )",

    "the neutron star magnetosphere produces soft x - ray seed photons through electron cyclotron emission , which are comptonized within the magnetosphere itself , as well as in a hot corona that forms around the magnetosphere .",
    "more recently , the development of various branches of self - consistent accretion flow solutions such as advection - dominated accretion flows ( adaf ; ichimaru 1977 ; narayan & yi 1995 ) that successfully describe the spectral behavior of black hole xrbs ( tanaka & lewin 1995 ; tanaka & shibazaki 1996 ) , advection - dominated inflow / outflow systems ( adios ; blandford & begelman 1999 ) , and convection - dominated accretion flows ( cdaf ; quataert & gruzinov 2000 ) have provided us with deeper insights about the global energetics of accretion flows around compact objects .",

    "( 1972 ) showed that periodic changes in the x - ray pulse frequency of cen x-3 could be used to establish the binarity of the system .",
    "this observation , along with the finding that the optical candidate of cyg x-1 was a spectroscopic binary ( bolton 1971 ; webster & murdin 1972 ) , was a key to confirming suggestions that many of the bright variable x - ray sources known at the time were indeed close binaries ( shklovsky 1967 proposed that sco x-1 is a neutron star binary ) . the _",
    "observations of cen x-3 showed that during x - ray eclipses the x - ray flux level did not go to zero but that there was a residual flux , indicating the presence of extended matter , or , in any case , another source of x rays in the system .",
    "cen  x-3 was soon identified in the optical with an o - type star ( krzemisky 1974 ) .",
    "early type stars had already been known to have strong winds with mass loss rates @xmath113 yr@xmath4 and velocities @xmath114 km",
    "s@xmath4 ( morton 1967 ) . thus it was natural to attribute the residual eclipse flux in cen  x-3 to scattering or other reprocessing by a stellar wind .",
    "similar explanations were given for the residual flux observed in other eclipsing x - ray binary pulsars identified with early - type stars , such as vela x-1 , 4u 1538 - 522 , smc x-1 , and lmc x-4 .",
    "the hard x - ray continuum spectrum of the residual eclipse radiation was generally observed to have the same form as the uneclipsed flux in the hard x - ray band .",
    "therefore , electron scattering , which is independent of photon energy for small compton @xmath71 parameters and photon energies such that @xmath115 , was implicated as the reprocessing mechanism ( e.g. , becker et al .  1978 ) .",
    "the residual flux observed in eclipse is usually a few percent of the flux outside of eclipse , implying scattering optical depths @xmath116 of a few percent . to get an estimate of the corresponding electron density , we let the companion star set the linear scale ( @xmath117 ) , and estimate @xmath87 from @xmath118 , where @xmath119 is the thomson cross section .",
    "this gives a density @xmath120 @xmath95 in hmxb winds , which is consistent with the densities in the winds of isolated massive stars .",
    "the wind provides a natural source of accretion fuel to power the x - ray source . for the wind density derived above ,",
    "the theory of bondi & hoyle ( 1944 ) predicts an accretion rate sufficient to power a neutron star luminosity of approximately @xmath1 @xmath121 erg s@xmath4 , where @xmath122 is the wind velocity in multiples of 1000 km s@xmath4 .",
    "therefore , while it is possible that , in some hmxbs , the compact object is powered by accretion directly from a wind of the type found in isolated massive stars , those that lie at the high end of the luminosity range are not easily accommodated .",
    "either the wind must be much different than in an isolated massive star wind ( for example , the wind velocity is much lower ) , or the compact object must be fueled in some other manner , such as roche lobe overflow .    for a luminosity of @xmath1@xmath7 erg s@xmath4 , the density and length scale described above imply @xmath42 values in the range @xmath123@xmath62 .",
    "for such large ionization parameters , astrophysically abundant elements are typically ionized up to the k shell ( e.g. , kallman & mccray 1982 ) .",
    "if we note additionally that the electron temperatures implied for such gas are @xmath63@xmath83 k , then we can estimate line luminosities . for si xiv ly@xmath38 , for example",
    ", the recombination line luminosity is @xmath124 where @xmath125 is the line photon energy , @xmath126 is the volume of the emission region , @xmath127 is the ionization fraction of fully stripped silicon , @xmath128 is the silicon abundance relative to hydrogen , and @xmath129 is the effective rate coefficient for recombinations that result in emission of a si xiv ly@xmath38 photon .",
    "if we use the density and length scale from above , take the solar abundance of silicon , assume that silicon is fully stripped ( @xmath130 ) , and @xmath131 @xmath2 s@xmath4 ( for a temperature of 100 ev ; osterbrock 1989 ) then we find a value of approximately @xmath132 erg s@xmath4 .",
    "the continuum spectra of x - ray pulsars are typically flat ( photon index of @xmath133 ) up to approximately 10 kev , above which they are cut off .",
    "so , the specific monochromatic luminosity of the continuum is approximately ( @xmath134/10kev ) . in eclipse , since the apparent luminosity is reduced to a few percent of that outside of eclipse , the monochromatic luminosity becomes @xmath0 erg s@xmath4 kev@xmath4 .",
    "this gives equivalent widths @xmath135 ev , which are easily observable with _",
    "asca_. with the benefit of hindsight , we see that lines from highly - ionized gas might have been expected .",
    "it was somewhat surprising to many of us , however , when vela  x-1 was observed over an eclipse , and several emission lines from h - like and he - like ions were observed ( nagase et al .",
    "1994 ) .    before the launch of _ asca _ in 1993 ,",
    "x - ray spectroscopy provided information on the winds of hmxbs mostly through studies of scattering and absorption of the continuum .",
    "the properties of the scattered continuum are almost entirely independent of the physical state and chemical composition of the scattering gas .",
    "this is useful , in that studies of the x - ray scattered continuum `` find '' all of the gas , but problematic , in that the electron scattered continuum conveys no information on the physical state of the gas .",
    "absorption tends to probe regions of low ionization , and provides a valuable complement to studies of emission lines ( e.g. , haberl , white , & kallman 1989 ) from highly ionized regions .",
    "the iron k emission line complex provided some constraints on the state of gas in the pre-_asca _ era but with proportional counters , the 6.4 , 6.7 , and 6.9 kev lines of neutral or near - neutral , helium - like , and hydrogen - like iron , respectively were often blended . the absence of detailed information regarding the state of the highly - ionized gas has compromised our ability to describe the wind physics because the mechanism by which the wind is accelerated is likely to depend on the local temperature and ionization state .      in massive , isolated stars , winds are driven as uv photons from the star transfer their outward momentum to the wind via absorption line transitions .",
    "castor , abbott , & klein ( 1975 ) showed that line transitions provide the opacity to power winds in isolated , massive stars , and that the winds obey the velocity law @xmath136 for a given distance @xmath85 from the center of the wind donor , where @xmath137 is the stellar radius , and where @xmath138 , assuming a uv point source . by accounting for the finite size of the companion star , pauldrach , puls , & kudritzki ( 1986 ) showed that values of @xmath139 in the range 0.71.0 are better representations of the wind kinematics .",
    "given a velocity profile , the wind density can be calculated by applying the equation of mass continuity , assuming spherical symmetry : @xmath140 where @xmath15 is the gas mass per hydrogen atom .",
    "we can estimate the density from this equation and compare it to our earlier estimate based upon inferred compton depths . for @xmath141 , @xmath142 which provides some validation to expectations that a more or less normal stellar wind is responsible for reprocessing the central x - ray continuum .    if a point source of x rays is introduced into this system such that the distance of a gas parcel from the source is denoted by @xmath143 , then from eqs .",

    "with a strictly spherically symmetric wind , i.e. , ignoring the effects of non - inertial forces in the co - rotating frame , stellar rotation , etc . , the line of centers is an axis of cylindrical symmetry .",
    "since recombination timescales near the binary are short compared to the orbital period , this structure is virtually fixed in the co - rotating frame , modulo intrinsic time variations in the x - ray continuum flux .",
    "this type of configuration was first studied by hatchett & mccray ( 1977 ) .",
    "surfaces of constant @xmath42 are surfaces of fixed charge state distribution , as well as constant temperature .    at large @xmath143 ( and , therefore , large @xmath85 )",
    "both the wind density and the ionizing flux fall as @xmath146 , and @xmath42 approaches a constant value @xmath147 , or , numerically @xmath148 more significantly , @xmath149 is also close to the values of @xmath42 at points on the system midplane ( @xmath150 ; @xmath42 on the midplane is exactly equal to @xmath149 for the limiting case @xmath151 ) .",
    "this latter aspect provides a way to estimate a characteristic value of @xmath42 for a particular system , since most of the x - ray emission will originate in the binary system between the companion and the x - ray source .    what fig .",
    "1 does not show , of course , is the @xmath152 weighting needed to calculate line emissivities @xmath153 , where @xmath154 is the line power ( c.g.s .",

    "if the @xmath42 structure for a particular system is such that a given ion can exist in regions near the companion star , then , for lines emitted by this ion , these denser regions of the irradiated stellar wind will have the highest line emissivities . on the other hand , the luminosities of lines formed at",
    "somewhat higher @xmath42 , produced away from the stellar surface , benefit from the larger volumes @xmath155 over which they can form ( @xmath156 ) . moving away from the companion , the competition between the falloff in density and the increase in the volume over which lines form determines the weightings given to each ion in producing the overall recombination line spectrum .",
    "the coupling of models for the ionization structure and the wind velocity profile provides the means by which to calculate this distribution in weightings , called the _ differential emission measure distribution _",

    "it turns out , however , that @xmath149 is a good indicator of the spectrum , in the sense that prominent lines will be produced in regions characterized by values of @xmath42 centered approximately on @xmath149 .",
    "the high level of ionization in the wind induced by the x - ray source causes a serious complication in the simple picture presented above .",
    "studies of the effects of x rays on the wind - driving mechanism have shown that the radiative force decreases as wind material becomes increasingly ionized by the x - ray source ( macgregor & vitello 1982 ; stevens & kallman 1990 ) . as predicted by hatchett & mccray ( 1977 ) , this effect can be observed directly through the orbital phase variation of resonance lines of uv p cygni profiles from ions such as si  iv , c  iv , and n  v ( dupree et al .",

    "closer to the stellar surface , a modification of the wind structure , an exponential form with scale height @xmath157 as proposed by clark , minato , & mi ( 1988 ) for cen  x-3 , was necessary to explain the gradual eclipse transitions .",
    "the physical processes of x - ray scattering and absorption are often sufficient to describe the spectra seen with low - resolution detectors . however , an _ asca _ observation of vela  x-1 over an eclipse ( nagase et al .",
    "1994 ) was dominated by recombination emission lines .",
    "we describe in the next section a method for calculating emission line spectra for model winds .",
    "when recombination is the dominant line production mechanism , the line power can be written as @xmath158 where @xmath159 is the ionic fraction of the recombining ion .",
    "recombination lines can be associated with particular values of @xmath42each line can be assigned a @xmath42 _ of formation _",
    "these occur at the value of @xmath42 for which @xmath161 is a maximum , equivalent to maximizing @xmath162 .",

    "the presence of bright emission lines from species of such disparate @xmath160 suggests that the reprocessing gas in vela x-1 is composed of a non - trivial distribution in @xmath42 .",
    "this comes as no great surprise , based upon the discussion in the previous section , to the extent that the simple model described there is a reasonable representation of the true matter distribution .    to a first approximation",
    ", we can write @xmath165 where @xmath166 is called the _ volume emission measure_. without corollary information that would allow an independent determination of either the density or the emission volume , we can describe the `` amount '' of gas only in terms of the emission measure .",

    "gives an approximation to the differential emission measure ( dem ) distribution , the emission measure per unit @xmath145 , which is defined more formally below .",
    "the significance of this is that the empirical dem distribution is relatively easy to construct , and can be compared to theoretical predictions derived from geometrical models of the source .",
    "this has an advantage over comparisons of spectra , since large - scale models of xrbs often use highly schematic atomic models .",
    "it is well - known , however , that recombination emission , especially from h - like ions , is efficient over a wide range in @xmath42 ( hirano et al .  1987 ; ebisawa et al .",

    "were added to the fitting program to accommodate lines from near - neutral mg , si , s , ar , ca , fe , and ni .",
    "a related problem is that the highly - ionized wind model does not account for the intrinsic near - neutral column density needed to attenuate the continuum flux .",

    "1980 ; sato et al .  1986 ) , and considerably smaller than expectations based upon wind mass loss rates from isolated early - type stars .",
    "the problem can be summarized as follows : ( 1 ) the explanation of recombination emission from k - shell ions requires a certain range of @xmath42 and a certain range of dem magnitudes , which leads to small @xmath9 ; ( 2 ) a model using a larger value of @xmath9 , while explaining the column density variation , x - ray fluorescence , and uv evidence of low charge states , predicts that the recombination line zones would closely surround the neutron star , with dimensions so small that they would be occulted by the companion star during eclipse .",
    "sako et al .  showed that by abandoning the assumption that the wind is smooth , this apparent discrepancy could be reconciled ( cf .",
    ", nagase et al .  1983 ; sato et al .",
    "1986 ) . a picture of the wind arises for which @xmath195 of the wind s mass is in the form of cool , dense clumps , but @xmath196 of the irradiated wind volume within the binary system conforms to the simple @xmath139-law / hatchett - mccray model used to fit the recombination emission .",
    "this picture is able to bring the x - ray recombination spectrum , the fluorescent line spectrum , the intrinsic column density , and the presence of the low charge states observed in the uv into accord , and yields an estimate of the total mass loss rate ( @xmath197 @xmath190 ) that agrees well with earlier numbers .",
    "finally , this clumpiness may be related to short - term variability ( @xmath198-@xmath62 s ) in the x - ray luminosity through collisions of dense wind structures with the neutron star .    in hot star winds ,",
    "clumping is expected on theoretical grounds , and is evidenced by the appearance of so - called `` discrete absorption components '' ( dacs ) in uv line profiles . on a timescale of a few days , dacs may appear in the absorption trough of a uv p cygni profile , which subsequently begin to narrow and move to the blue ( e.g. , kaper et al .",
    "x rays are observed from isolated o and b stars ( e.g. , seward et al .",
    "1979 ) , whose origin has been attributed to shocks in radiatively driven winds ( lucy 1982 ) .",
    "line - driven stellar winds are subject to several instabilities ( macgregor , hartmann , & raymond 1979 ; lucy & white 1980 ; owocki & rybicki 1984 ) , such as the rayleigh - taylor instability , which will produce clumps with sizes @xmath199 cm ( carlberg 1980 ) .",
    "thus it is not entirely surprising that a clumpy wind is invoked to explain the x - ray spectrum of vela x-1 .",
    "the relation between clumping in a normal wind and clumping in an x - ray irradiated wind is not established , however . while the characteristics of the clumps in the model are reasonable , they are more or less _ ad hoc _ , do not explain their origin or survivability , and do not accommodate a clump population that is likely to possess a distribution of sizes and densities .    liedahl et al .",
    "( 2000 ) speculate that the clumped component of the wind , since it is characterized by small values of @xmath42 , has sufficient opacity to the companion s uv field to permit normal radiative driving .",
    "while the diffuse wind is too highly ionized to be driven by uv radiation , the clumps , which contain most of the wind mass , may mediate the transfer of momentum to the outflow , with the result that the hotter , diffuse wind is `` pushed ''",
    "outward , thereby imparting the @xmath139-law velocity distribution to the recombination emission line regions .",
    "alternatively , the hotter , more tenuous wind component may originate from the evaporation of material off the clump surfaces , which then leaves it tied to the clump velocity distribution .",
    "wojdowski et al .  (",
    "2001 ) applied a similar dem analysis of the _ asca _ spectrum of cen x-3 . unlike vela x-1 , for which a wind terminal velocity has been measured ( dupree et al .",

    "( 7 ) it can be seen that the local density , hence dem , scales with @xmath200 .",
    "thus the ratio @xmath200 must be used as a fitting parameter , rather than @xmath9 . also by contrast to vela x-1",
    ", it is already known that any clump population should have a negligible effect on the cen x-3 x - ray spectrum , as evidenced by the near constancy with orbital phase of the equivalent width of the fluorescent iron k@xmath38 complex ( ebisawa et al .",
    "in other words , were the wind highly clumped and extended , a dramatic increase in the fe k@xmath38 equivalent width would accompany eclipse of the compact x - ray source .",
    "vela x-1 , for example , _ does _ show a large - amplitude variability in the fe k@xmath38 equivalent width ( sato et al .",
    "therefore , it is assumed from the outset that the wind in cen x-3 is smooth , and that , for a given @xmath201 , the best - fit @xmath9 pertains to the total mass - loss rate of the companion .    the value of @xmath200 derived from the wojdowski et al .",

    "this is demonstrated by fig .",
    "( 2 ) , which shows a comparison of the dem distributions obtained from fits to the _ asca _ data .",
    "the apparent difference in the total emission measures ( the integrals of the dem distributions ) is not real , and results simply from the omission of the dem distribution for the ( off - scale ) lower-@xmath42 region .",

    "above @xmath205 , however , the difference between the two curves is real .",

    "this is a crude argument , but it is consistent with the x - ray spectra , and suggests that further work into the formation and survivability of clumped winds in hmxbs may show that thermal instabilities play an important role .",
    "the interplay of the various physical processes in hmxb winds is complex , and computational simulations that include hydrodynamics , the effects of radiation on the thermal balance , and gravitational and non - inertial forces are necessary to determine the resulting structure and kinematics . as these simulations are necessarily inexact , it is desirable to test them by predicting how these simulated wind models would appear when observed with real observatories and comparing these predictions with observational data . in principle , simulations could be improved by comparing predicted spectra to observed spectra , identifying the physical processes which need to be treated in greater detail in order to reproduce the observed spectra , and then iterating .",
    "this is not generally practical , however .",
    "running a simulation of the wind for even a single set of assumptions and approximations takes a large amount of computer time and performing a large number of iterations of simulating and comparing to observation is generally impossible .",

    "only a few attempts have been made to compare simulations with observational data quantitatively .",
    "one reason is that many simulations are done in two dimensions and the quantitative extrapolation of the results to three dimensions is not straightforward .",
    "the wind in smc  x-1 was simulated by blondin & woo ( 1995 ) in three dimensions , including uv radiation driving and its disruption by x - ray ionization , and also the driving of a thermal wind from the x - ray heated face of the companion .",
    "this simulation included the gravity of the supergiant companion and non - inertial forces but not the gravity of the compact object .",

    "the observed spectrum had no obvious emission features .",
    "this excluded the possibility that the dem distribution of the wind contained a large component with @xmath220 , as strong recombination emission features ( predominantly o  vii and o  viii ) are emitted below 2 kev at those ionization parameters . in the simulation , the wind was denser in the x - ray shadowed region , but dense finger - like structures from the shadowed side of the companion extended into the x - ray illuminated side .",
    "these structures were characterized by ionization parameters in the range @xmath220 , and their integrated emission measure was greater than that allowed by the observed spectrum by an order of magnitude .",
    "it was therefore concluded that the finger - like structures could not exist as they appeared in the simulation .",
    "again , it is not clear how the physical assumptions of this simulation should be changed in order to make the resultant wind conform to observations .    despite the growing sophistication of these simulations ,",
    "there are still potentially important physical effects that have not been accounted for . for example , none of the simulations mentioned above properly account for the transfer of x rays through the wind . to take an example , the inclusion of detailed x - ray transfer may result in the formation of strmgren ionization boundaries around the x - ray source .",
    "outside of the strmgren surface , the wind is not highly ionized , thus uv radiation driving is not strongly affected by the x - ray field of the compact object ( masai 1984 ) .",

    "the emissivities , which include the @xmath152 weighting , are by far the largest nearest the companion star , in what for an isolated star would be the acceleration zone , where the velocity is relatively low .",
    "this primarily shows that outflowing material on the irradiated side of the companion is ionized to high levels by the x - ray field long before the wind attains a high velocity . owing to this effect",

    "the emission spectrum for a given spatial cell of gas can still be treated as though it were function of @xmath42 alone , but , in order to compute the total spectrum , absorption along the line of sight to the observer must be applied to each cell ( see wojdowski et al .",

    "the _ chandra _ x - ray spectrum of circinus x-1 shows h - like and he - like lines from ne , mg , si , s , and fe , with line widths of @xmath221 km s@xmath4 and p cygni profiles , the first observed in the x - ray band , indicative of an accelerating outflow with a comparable velocity ( brandt & schulz 2000 ) .",
    "interestingly , optical observations suggest that cir x-1 is a low - mass system ( glass 1994 ) , which is also implied by its x - ray spectrum and variability ( shirey , bradt , & levine 1999 ) , as well as its type i x - ray bursts ( tennant , fabian , & shafer 1986 ) .",
    "thus the x - ray continuum is thought to be viewed through an accretion disk wind , which in some ways poses an even greater challenge for modelers than stellar winds ; for example , conditions at the base of the wind vary with disk radius . in order to obtain the values of @xmath42 corresponding to the observed ionic species ,",
    "a density @xmath222 @xmath95 is required .",
    "this is consistent with the model values for the atmospheric density in a hydrostatic disk ( see  5 ) .",
    "in addition , a broad ( @xmath221 km s@xmath4 ) , blueshifted h@xmath38 line may indicate an outflow of an optically thick gas , indicative of even larger densities , perhaps at the base of the wind ( johnston , fender , & wu 1999 ) . a model spectrum of this source",

    "the intense emission from lmxbs is attributed to the efficient conversion of gravitational potential energy into radiation , as mass is transferred from an otherwise normal star to a compact object ( shklovsky 1967 ) .",
    "the mass donor ( companion ) overflows its roche lobe , thereby spilling matter through the inner lagrangian point ( l1 ) .",

    "1995 ) .",
    "the viscous mechanism in accretion disks allows accretion to occur by transporting angular momentum outward , matter inwards , and by dissipating gravitational energy into heat inside the disk .",
    "the viscosity mechanism has been identified in theory as a magneto - rotational instability due to the entanglement of magnetic fields from the differential rotation of gas in keplerian orbits , akin to a dynamo effect ( balbus & hawley 1998 ) . in mhd models ,",
    "this mechanism provides the energy dissipation and angular momentum transfer needed to naturally produce mass accretion with self - sustained magnetic fields @xmath227 that are much smaller than the equipartition level ( @xmath228 ) , where @xmath229 is the gas density and @xmath230 is the thermal velocity .",

    "moreover , neutron star or coronal thermal emission has made the discernment of disk continuum emission ambiguous .",
    "as such , x - ray line emission is a potentially powerful tool for elucidating the properties of accretion disks .      with the exception of fe k emission in the 6.47.0 kev range , discerning x - ray line emission in lmxbs has been challenging , owing to limitations in sensitivity and spectral resolving power , as well as the difficulties associated with attempts to extract line emission from data dominated by intense continuum emission .",
    "still , measurements obtained with the _ einstein objective grating spectrometer ( vrtilek et al .  1991 ) , the _ rosat position sensitive proportional counter ( schulz 1999 ) , and the _ asca ccd imaging detectors ( asai et al .",

    "evidence of x - ray emission from extended regions in lmxbs comes from the spectral variations during ingress and egress phases of eclipses , and during rapid intensity fluctuations known as dips .",

    "hydrostatic equilibrium , thermal equilibrium , and ionization equilibrium should be good assumptions in a time averaged sense .",
    "the radiation transfer is complex , and the assumptions used to simplify calculations could be problematic . in particular , by dividing the disk atmosphere into annular zones with a given vertical gas column , our 1-d radiation transfer calculation assumes that 1 ) the primary continuum is not absorbed before reaching the top of the column , 2 ) the radiation in the column propagates from top to bottom at a given grazing angle , and 3 ) there is no significant radiative coupling from one disk annulus to another , which is used to justify the slab approximation .",
    "the above assumptions are inadequate if the column height is comparable to the disk radius , or if the photon mean free path in the gas column is many times the local radius .",
    "thus , future 2-d calculations will result in better bookkeeping of photons , a more accurate structure , and a more reliable x - ray line spectrum .",
    "the correct calculation of line transfer in the gas is also a concern , since the disk atmosphere is optically thick in the lines .",
    "line transfer is complicated by the keplerian velocity shear , which has to be taken into account for a given viewing angle ( murray & chiang 1997 ) .",
    "the escape - probability approximation used to calculate line transfer in the disk may also be inadequate because of the large optical depths .",
    "our calculations show that the proper treatment of a thermal instability ( field 1965 ; krolik , mckee , & tarter 1981 ) and the effect of conduction to resolve it affect the spectrum significantly ( zeldovich & pikelner 1969 ) . a two - phase gas could form , with clouds of an unknown size distribution and with undetermined dynamics of evaporation and condensation ( begelman & mckee 1990 ) , with each phase having distinct ionization parameter and opacity .",
    "the instability is sensitive to 1 ) the metal abundances , 2 ) the continuum shape ( hess , kahn , & paerels 1997 ) , and 3 ) the atomic kinetics ( savin et al .  1999 ) .",
    "finally , the inclusion of radiation pressure in high luminosity systems or for small radii is advisable ( proga , stone , & kallman 2000 ) .",

    "fortunately , our numerical modeling indicates that the viscosity term is negligible in most regions of the disk atmosphere except for the inner disk if @xmath278 ( in particular , near the compton - temperature corona ) .",

    "1999 ) and in the disk atmosphere ( rozanska & czerny 1996 ) .",
    "other forms for the local dissipation that reduce to the @xmath38-disk have been used ( meyer & meyer - hofmeister 1982 ) .",
    "irradiated gas is subject to a thermal instability for temperatures in the @xmath63@xmath64 k range ( buff & mccray 1974 ; field , goldsmith , & habing 1969 ) , suppressing x - ray line emission in that regime .",
    "the field ( 1965 ) stability criterion indicates that a photoionized gas may become unstable when recombination cooling of h - like and he - like ions is important .",
    "the temperature and ionization parameter ranges where the instability occurs depend on the metal abundances and the local radiation spectrum ( hess , kahn , & paerels 1997 ) . within a range of _",
    "pressure ionization parameters _ ( @xmath280 , where @xmath281 is the radiation pressure , and @xmath282 the gas pressure ; krolik , mckee , & tarter 1981 ) , thermal equilibrium is achieved by three distinct temperatures , only two of which are stable to perturbations in @xmath213 ( see fig .  4 ) .",
    "the instability implies a large temperature gradient as the gas is forced to move between stable branches , requiring the formation of a transition region whose size could be determined by electron heat conduction .    for simplicity",
    ", we neglect emission from the conduction transition region . upon calculation of the field length , the length scale below which conduction dominates thermal equilibrium , we estimate that conduction forms a transition layer @xmath283 times the geometrical thickness of the x - ray emitting zones . nevertheless , x - ray line emission from the neglected transition region could be important ( li , gu , & kahn 2001 ) .    consideration of conduction gives a physical interpretation to choosing one of the two stable solutions for a given @xmath208 .",
    "roughly , a static conduction solution must split the instability region in half , taking the low-@xmath213 stable branch at @xmath284 , and the high-@xmath213 stable branch at @xmath285 , separated by the transition layer at @xmath286 ( zeldovich & pikelner 1969 ) . a transition layer located away from @xmath286",
    "will dynamically approach @xmath286 by mass flow .",
    "thus , a transition layer at @xmath287 corresponds to evaporating gas , while a transition at @xmath288 implies condensing gas ( zeldovich & pikelner 1969 ) .",
    "we compute the disk structure for both condensing and evaporating solutions ( jimenez - garate et al .",
    "the static conduction solution is an intermediate case of the latter extreme cases .",
    "we always take a single - valued @xmath289 , since a two - phase solution may be buoyantly unstable , making the denser , colder gas sink .",
    "the evaporating disk corresponds to the low-@xmath213 branch of the instability , while the condensing disk corresponds to the high-@xmath213 branch .      using a model for a disk illuminated by a neutron star",
    ", we have produced an x - ray recombination line spectrum from a self - consistent accretion disk atmosphere .",
    "the flaring of the atmosphere is consistent with optical observations ( de jong , van paradijs , & augusteijn 1996 ) . by introducing the feedback between illumination and disk atmosphere geometry (",
    "25 ) , we have obtained a disk with a height to radius ( @xmath290 ) ratio that is @xmath291 times larger than previously thought , with a corresponding increase in the reprocessed line radiation intensity .    with the disk structure [ @xmath292 , @xmath293 and charge state distributions @xmath294 , we compute local x - ray emissivities using detailed atomic models . the atomic structure , radiative transition rates , and collisional rate coefficients are calculated with hullac ( hebrew university / lawrence livermore atomic code ; klapisch et al .  1977 ) .",
    "radiative recombination rates , including the rrc , are found from the milne relation using the photoionization cross - sections provided by saloman , hubble , & scofield ( 1988 ) .",
    "the overall spectral model includes the h - like and he - like ions of c , n , o , ne , mg , si , s , ar , ca , and fe , as well as the fe l - shell ions .",
    "further details are described in sako et al .",
    "( 1999 ) .",
    "each annulus consists of a grid of zones in the vertical direction , and @xmath213 , @xmath229 and @xmath295 for each zone are used to calculate the line and rrc emissivities .",
    "the radiation is propagated outwards at inclination angle @xmath12 , including the continuum opacity of all zones above .",
    "the spectrum is doppler broadened by the projected local keplerian velocity , assuming azimuthal symmetry .",
    "the outgoing spectrum for each annulus is added to a running total to obtain the total disk spectrum .",
    "our models show that , for a low - inclination lmxb , x - ray lines from the disk will be difficult to detect against the bright continuum .",
    "chandra letgs spectrum of x0614 + 091 ( paerels et al .",
    "2001 ) confirms this .",
    "although a number of interstellar absorption features are present , there is no evidence for disk line emission .",
    "the data can be reproduced ,",
    "i.e. , we can generate a model spectrum for which the x - ray line emission lies below the limit of detectability , if we constrain the outer disk radius such that @xmath296 cm .",
    "we propose that this source is at a low inclination and has a small accretion disk , reducing substantially the equivalent widths of disk emission lines .",
    "unfortunately , the orbital parameters and inclination of this source are unknown .",
    "of course , this is only a consistency check  not the best way to corroborate details of disk models  but it is still somewhat gratifying that there are plausible pockets of parameter space for which the model predicts unobservably weak lines . _",
    "the _ xmm - newton rgs spectrum of x0748 - 67 , which shows a number of emission lines (  5.1 ) , provides a more stringent test .",
    "we have not yet attempted to `` fit '' the data ; the particular result discussed here arises from a preliminary investigation of the sensitivity of the x - ray line spectrum to parameter variation and selecting among different thermally stable solutions ( jimenez - garate et al .",
    ", in preparation ) . as can be seen from ( fig .  5 ) , our disk atmosphere model spectrum compares favorably with the x0748 - 67 data .",
    "the model disk inclination is set to @xmath297 .",
    "for the line emission , we applied a neutral absorbing column density @xmath298 @xmath299 , and for the continuum emission @xmath300 @xmath299 , which represents a geometry for which a compact continuum source is obscured by material in the outer disk .",
    "this is consistent with the significant variability in the continuum , and the absence of variability in the extended disk line emission .",
    "integration of theoretical he - like spectra over the disk produce he - like @xmath85 ratios that are consistent with those observed .",
    "for example , the typical model atmospheric density corresponding to o vii emission is @xmath301 @xmath95 or greater .",
    "hydrogen - like o viii rrc are very broad , with a superposed narrow component in evaporating disks .",
    "the o vii rrc and the @xmath75 line appear at the expected relative levels . among other preliminary results , we find that the o viii / o vii line ratios are good tracers of evaporation from the disk ( jimenez - garate et al .",
    "2001 ) , so that the predicted o viii ly@xmath38 to o vii he@xmath38 ratio , for example , is sensitive to both the flaring angle of the disk and to the presence or absence of evaporation .",
    "the robustness of the calculated ratio against changes in the computational methods used will have to be evaluated _ vis - a - vis _ other models , e.g. , those using 2-d radiation transfer .",
    "the o vii he@xmath38 line flux may be more model dependent since it is produced in a smaller region , where conduction is not negligible . _    line profiles for x0748 - 67are resolvable by the _ xmm and _ chandra spectrometers .",
    "we find that an essential factor in properly calculating line profiles is that x - ray line formation , for a given line , is spread over most of the disk .",
    "for example , the @xmath302 profile of o viii ly@xmath38 ( fig .",
    "6 ) shows that radii spanning several orders of magnitude ( @xmath303 cm ) need to be accounted for ( this applies also , of course , to a proper calculation of the total line luminosity or line equivalent width ) .",
    "the theoretical line profile for a single narrow annulus is double peaked .",
    "however , integrated over the disk surface , the line acquires broad , smooth wings and only a very narrow double- peaked core from the outermost annulus .",
    "the spectrometer response can easily smooth this feature into a quasi - gaussian core profile .",
    "again we see that access to a global , parameterized model of the source is imperative if we are to provide a valid interpretation  not just a description  of spectroscopic data .",
    "the erstwhile goal of inferring accretion disk structure by working backwards from a set of plasma diagnostics appears to be an untenable proposition . _ _",
    "we have remarked that , thus far , x - ray emission line spectra of xrbs consist almost exclusively of h - like and he - like ion spectra , mixed with k@xmath38 fluorescence lines .",
    "while the atomic physics and population kinetics of the former are fairly simple , the latter are , in principle , quite complicated , but merely _ treated _ as though they were simple . to some extent",
    ", this situation removes the atomic physics barriers to successful interpretations of x - ray spectra from xrbs . with increasing detector areas ,",
    "however , such as will become available with _ constellation - x _ , more advanced techniques will become more readily available ( fe l - shell spectroscopy , ion fluorescence spectroscopy , etc . ) . at that time",
    ", atomic physics issues and uncertainties will again be a primary concern .",
    "for the time being , it is our opinion that there are more pressing problems .",
    "as has been discussed , line formation in an xrb is inherently global , in the sense that line luminosities typically involve integrations over non - negligible fractions of the source volumes , over which the basic physical parameters may assume a broad range of values . although it is useful to derive semi - quantitative estimates of densities , temperatures , and velocities from observed spectra , the notion that a particular value of a particular diagnostic line ratio allows us to specify one of these physical parameters fails to acknowledge this global nature .",
    "what is needed , therefore , is development of and access to global models of xrbs  models that strive for spectroscopic accuracy , so that x - ray spectra now being obtained with _",
    "chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _ can be used as feedback .",
    "we have described a few of these models .",
    "those that have been successful at reproducing x - ray spectra are full of simplifying assumptions , thereby lacking sufficient physical realism .",
    "unfortunately , adding complexity to models does not guarantee their success , owing to the need to select among various subsets of physical assumptions . in the long term",
    ", radiative - hydrodynamic calculations will undoubtedly provide an increasingly realistic picture of accretion flows in xrbs . in the near term , however , we are faced with a number of obstacles , both conceptual and practical , that remain to be surmounted .",
