    "the experimental evidence for discontinuities in the sequence of atomic masses , @xmath1 and @xmath2- decay systematics and binding energies of nuclei suggests the existence of a set of magic proton and neutron numbers , which can be described successfully by single particle shell models with a heuristic spin - orbit term @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the most prominent representative is the phenomenological nilsson model @xcite with an anisotropic oscillator potential : @xmath3 although these models are flexible enough to reproduce the experimental results , they lack a deeper theoretical justification , which becomes obvious , when extrapolating the parameters @xmath4 , @xmath5 , which determine the strength of the spin orbit and @xmath6 term to the region of superheavy elements @xcite .",
    "hence it seems tempting to describe the experimental data with alternative methods .",
    "typical examples are relativistic mean field theories @xcite,@xcite , where nucleons are described by the dirac - equation and the interaction is mediated by mesons . although a spin orbit force is obsolete in these models , different parametrizations predict different shell closures @xcite,@xcite .",

    "we will determine the symmetry group , which generates a single particle spectrum similar to ( [ nilsson ] ) , but includes the magic numbers right from the beginning .",
    "our approach is based on group theoretical methods developed within the framework of fractional calculus .",
    "the fractional calculus @xcite-@xcite provides a set of axioms and methods to extend the coordinate and corresponding derivative definitions in a reasonable way from integer order n to arbitrary order @xmath7 : @xmath8 the definition of the fractional order derivative is not unique , several definitions e.g. the feller , fourier , riemann , caputo , weyl , riesz , grnwald fractional derivative definitions coexist @xcite-@xcite .",
    "a direct consequence of this diversity is the fact , that the solutions e.g. of a one dimensional wave equation differ significantly depending on the specific choice of a fractional derivative definition .",
    "until now it has always been assumed , that the fractional derivative type for an extension of a fractional differential equation to multi - dimensional space should be chosen uniquely .",

    "we conclude , that the caputo - riemann - riemann symmetric rotor predicts a well defined set of magic numbers .",

    ". there are no potential - terms or parametrized skyrme - forces involved and finally , all results may be calculated analytically .",
    "the results obtained encourage further investigations in this field .",
    "the next steps should include the pairing energy term and parameters should be determined by a more sophisticated fit procedure . with these additional contributions the model will most probably describe nuclear properties with at least similar accuracy as the models currently used .",
    "based on the riemann- and caputo definition of the fractional derivative we used the fractional extensions of the standard rotation group @xmath0 to construct a higher dimensional representation of a fractional rotation group with mixed derivative types .",
    "we obtained an extended symmetric rotor model , which predicts the sequence of magic proton and neutron numbers accurately .",
    "furthermore we have shown , that the ground state properties of nuclei can be reproduced correctly within the framework of this model .",
    "hence we have demonstrated , that a dynamic symmetry , generated by mixed fractional type rotation groups is indeed realized in nature .",
    "we thank a. friedrich for useful discussions .",
