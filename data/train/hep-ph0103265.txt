    "in the recent report on the detailed analysis of solar neutrino oscillations @xcite done by the super - kamiokande collaboration @xcite , it has been suggested that solutions with large mixing angles are favored while solutions with small mixing angles are disfavored at the 95@xmath18 confidence level .",
    "neutrino oscillations controlled by such large mixing angle have also been observed and confirmed for atmospheric neutrinos @xcite .",
    "both observed oscillations are characterized by the same property of neutrino mixings , namely , large neutrino mixings , which are theoretically consistent with bimaximal mixing scheme @xcite .",
    "the difference arises in their oscillation scales denoted by @xmath19 for atmospheric neutrinos and @xmath20 for solar neutrinos , which are specified by @xmath21 ev@xmath22 and @xmath23 ev@xmath22 , thereby , indicating a hierarchy of @xmath24 .",
    "neutrino oscillations arise for massive neutrinos @xcite .",
    "since neutrino masses of @xmath25 ev are implied by @xmath19 , models for neutrino oscillations must be equipped with mechanisms generating such tiny masses of neutrinos @xcite , which include breaking of the lepton number conservation for majorana neutrino masses .",
    "it has been long known @xcite that such lepton number breaking interactions are inevitably contained in the minimal @xmath26 model for electroweak interactions ( called the 331 model ) @xcite because a charged lepton ( @xmath27 ) and its antiparticle ( @xmath28 ) together with a neutrino ( @xmath29 ) are placed in a triplet of @xmath30 as @xmath31=(@xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34)@xmath35 . as a result , the model provides a charged - lepton mass term included in @xmath36 , which simultaneously contains @xmath37 as a neutrino mass term .",
    "namely , the need for majorana mass term is linked to the existence of the massive charged leptons .",
    "therefore , the 331 model is suitable for incorporating majorana neutrino masses @xcite .    with this nice feature of the 331 model in mind ,",
    "we introduce the bimaximal mixing scheme into the model to accommodate observed neutrino oscillations .",
    "one of the possible scenario for bimaximal mixing scheme is to employ a new @xmath38 symmetry based on @xmath1 ( @xmath39 @xmath10 ) @xcite .",
    "neutrino mixings are predicted to be maximal for solar neutrinos with @xmath20=0 but arbitrary for atmospheric neutrinos with @xmath40 .",
    "the hierarchy of @xmath24 is trivially satisfied since @xmath20=0 .",
    "one has to next explain how a nonvanishing @xmath20 is induced while preserving @xmath24 .",
    "an elaborated mechanism is to generate @xmath20 as radiative effects @xcite , whose generic smallness explains the relative smallness of @xmath20 over @xmath19 @xcite .    in this article",
    ", we construct our interactions that induce phenomenologically consistent neutrino and charged - lepton mass matrix , @xmath41 and @xmath42 , with appropriate radiative effects for @xmath20 .",
    "since the model describes both matrices in a unified form , masses for charged leptons and neutrinos are correlated to each other .",
    "the mass term of @xmath36 transforms as @xmath43 and @xmath44 , which requires @xmath45 and/or @xmath46 as higgs scalars .",
    "the coupling of the triplet higgs scalar to @xmath36 is antisymmetrized with respect to the @xmath30-index .",
    "the spin and statistics , then , requires antisymmetrized flavor indices carried by @xmath31 , in turn , generating antisymmetrized @xmath42 with eigenvalues corresponding to @xmath47 , which contradicts with the observed hierarchy of @xmath48 .",
    "the triplet higgs scalar alone is not consistent with the observed lepton mass spectrum . therefore , the sextet scalar , which provides symmetrized mass terms , is the key ingredient of the 331 model @xcite .- singlet vector - like heavy @xmath49electron \" without introducing a sextet scalar @xcite has been advocated to describe consistent mass spectra of neutrinos and charged leptons @xcite . ]    because the sextet higgs scalar contains both an @xmath50-doublet scalar for charged leptons and an @xmath50-triplet scalar for neutrinos , we naturally expect @xmath49degeneracy `` in the structure of their mass matrices .",
    "the charged leptons should contain a diagonal mass term such as the @xmath15-mass , which forces @xmath41 to have a diagonal term .",
    "however , @xmath41 should not contain diagonal terms to be consistent with bimaximal mixing scheme based on @xmath10 . to avoid this @xmath49degeneracy '' , we use the conservation of the @xmath10 quantum number supplemented by an appropriate @xmath3 parity as well as a specific breaking pattern of @xmath10 yielding a residual discrete symmetry .",
    "the collaboration of these symmetries allows neutrinos to develop no diagonal mass terms . as a result",
    ", atmospheric neutrino oscillations are controlled by those tree - level off - diagonal masses while solar neutrino oscillations are to be induced by one - loop effects . and",
    "a discrete symmetry have been done in ref.@xcite . ]    in the following section , we first introduce particles and their interactions and discuss how the required vacuum alignment is realized . section iii deals with the diagonalization of @xmath41 , which reflects rotation effects due to the diagonalization of @xmath42 .",
    "the bimaximal condition on the neutrino masses determines a pattern of the matrix elements for the electron mass .",
    "one - loop radiative mass of @xmath51 is also calculated .",
    "the discussions in sec.iv include to examine @xmath20 by utilizing the correlation between @xmath41 and @xmath42 and to confirm that the partial @xmath49degeneracy \" between @xmath41 and @xmath42 suppresses the rotation effects to yield the lma solution based on the radiative effects .",
    "the final section is devoted to summary and discussions .",
    "the model contains neutrinos and charged leptons in triplets of @xmath52 ( @xmath53=1,2,3 ) and the greek letters of @xmath54 , respectively , stand for the three families and three @xmath30-indices . ] with @xmath55 for @xmath56 and @xmath57 for @xmath58 , where the superscript @xmath59 of @xmath60 stands for the charge conjugation , and two ( anti-)sextet higgs scalars @xmath61 with @xmath10=(0 , 2 ) for ( @xmath9 , @xmath11 ) .",
    "since @xmath9 can couple to @xmath62 ( @xmath8=2,3 ) , @xmath63 mixing terms are generated by @xmath64 and are to be responsible for the bimaximal structure .",
    "on the other hand , @xmath65 ( and also @xmath66 ) are generated by @xmath67 via its coupling to @xmath68 ( @xmath69=2,3 ) .",
    "since @xmath68 also supply couplings to @xmath70 and @xmath71 , if @xmath72 is also induced , then it disturbs the nice feature of the bimaximal mixing scheme based on @xmath10 .",
    "therefore , in order for the present approach to be acceptable , the simultaneous alignment of @xmath73 and @xmath67 should be dynamically allowed .",
    "it is demonstrated that this vacuum alignment of @xmath74 and @xmath75 is indeed possible to occur as a result of the emergence of a residual discrete symmetry specific to @xmath38 .",
    "the 331 model is specified by the @xmath76-charge .",
    "let @xmath77 be the @xmath76 quantum number , then the hypercharge , @xmath78 , is given by @xmath79 and the electric charge @xmath80 is given by @xmath81 , where @xmath82 is the @xmath83 generator with tr@xmath84 @xmath85 .",
    "let us first summarize the whole particle content in our model , where the quantum numbers are specified by ( @xmath30 , @xmath76 ; @xmath38 ) : @xmath86 for leptons , @xmath87 for quarks @xmath88 for triplet higgs scalars , and @xmath89 for ( anti-)sextet higgs scalars .",
    "these higgs scalars have the following vacuum expectation values ( vev s ) : @xmath90 and quarks and leptons will acquire masses via these vev s , where the orthogonal choice of the vev s in eq.([eq : vev_triplet ] ) and the vanishing vev of @xmath91 in eq.([eq : vev_sextet ] ) are to be ensured by appropriate higgs interactions .",
    "the pure @xmath30-anomaly is cancelled in a vectorial manner .",
    "the anomalies from triplets of the three families of leptons and of the three colors of the third family of quarks are cancelled by those from antitriplets of three colors of the first and second families of quarks @xcite .",
    "other anomalies including @xmath76 are also cancelled .",
    "the scale of the 331 model is set by @xmath92 , yielding @xmath93 and we expect the magnitude of @xmath92 is of order tev .      to realize phenomenologically viable interactions",

    "hereafter , we restrict ourselves to the lepton sector .",
    "the yukawa interactions for leptons are , then , controlled by the following lagrangian : @xmath98 where @xmath99 s denote the yukawa couplings with @xmath100 .",
    "the possible term of the @xmath101-type is forbidden by @xmath3 .",
    "the higgs interactions are described by self - hermitian terms composed of @xmath102 ( @xmath103=@xmath94 , @xmath96 , @xmath97 ) and @xmath104 , which include the potential term of @xmath105 : @xmath106 where @xmath107 s represent coupling constants and @xmath108 and by the non - self - hermitian terms in @xmath109 where @xmath110 denotes a mass scale and @xmath111 stand for coupling constants .",
    "there is a leptonic number associated with @xmath31 , which can be taken to be @xmath112 for @xmath113 and 0 for all others . since the @xmath114 conservation is broken both spontaneously by @xmath113 and explicitly by @xmath115",
    ", there is no harmful nambu - goldstone boson .",
    "although the lepton number can not be globally assigned to @xmath30-multipulets , to argue majorana masses for neutrinos , it is useful to define the lepton number @xmath116 to classify interactions @xcite in the similar way used for the electric charge defined in the standard @xmath117 model . following the classification lately done in ref.@xcite",
