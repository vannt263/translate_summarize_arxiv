    "the standard model of the accretion disk proposed by shakura & sunyaev ( 1973 ) explains the dynamics of a thin disk by the newtonian potential , not taking into account of the essential general - relativistic effects of the black hole .",
    "the only notion it hires from general relativity ( hereinafter gr ) is that the inner most edge of the disk truncates at the last stable circular orbit of the schwarzschild geometry .",
    "complete general relativistic description of the thin keplerian disk was developed by novikov & thorne ( 1973 ) .",
    "owing to the complicated and cumbersome nature of underlying general relativistic equations , especially to study the full scale dynamics of the disk , it would be worthy enough to study in newtonian framework using a modified newtonian potential , namely pseudo - newtonian potential ( hereinafter pnp ) , having all the essence of a black hole geometry .",
    "such a potential was first proposed by paczyski & wiita ( 1980 ; hereinafter pw ) for modeling a thick / thin accretion disk around a nonrotating black hole .",
    "the potential exactly reproduces marginally stable orbit @xmath3 and marginally bound orbit @xmath4 of that in full gr and the efficiency per unit mass at the last stable circular orbit @xmath5 agrees with at most @xmath6 error .",
    "nowak & wagoner ( 1991 ) and mukhopadhyay & misra ( 2003 ) proposed other potentials for an accretion disk to describe epicyclic frequency which mimic most of the properties of the disk governed by the schwarzschild and kerr geometry respectively .",
    "pnps to describe the fluid dynamics of accretion disk around a rotating black hole in equatorial plane were also proposed by chakrabarti & khanna ( 1992 ) and artemova et al .",
    "( 1996 ) which , however , were not valid for entire range of kerr parameter .",
    "later , a twodimensional potential was described by mukhopadhyay ( 2002 ; hereinafter m02 ) which is valid for the entire range and reproduces @xmath7 exactly , @xmath8 with a maximum error @xmath9 and @xmath10 with a maximum possible error @xmath11 compared to that in the kerr geometry .",
    "the more interesting fact , however , lies in the methodology adopted by m02 in deriving the potential which can be used to formulate the pnp for any metric according to the physics concern .",
    "based on the procedure , several authors have developed pnps at the equatorial plane for other metric , e.g hartle - thorne metric by ghosh ( 2004 ) , kerr - newman metric by ivanov & prodanov ( 2005 ) .",
    "we plan to follow the procedure outlined by m02 to derive a pnp for general kerr geometry ( particle motion not confined to the equatorial plane ) which can be applied to study the generalized axisymmetric accretion disk dynamics .",
    "naturally , the aim is to furnish a pseudo - newtonian vector potential rather than a scalar potential with radial and vertical component in cylindrical coordinate system suitable for studying a thick accretion disk .",
    "while some authors focus on to propose an ad - hoc and a mathematically simpler form of pnp , we derive it from the spacetime metric directly .",
    "therefore , we do not need to worry about its final form strictly determined by our procedure for any spacetime metric unlike the other pnps .",
    "problem with an ad - hoc pnp is that there is no easy one to one correspondence between spacetime metric and pnp .",
    "most of the cosmic objects in our nature are rotating ( see e.g. iwasawa et al .",
    "1996 ; wilms et al . 2001 ; miniutti et al .",
    "2004 ; miller et al . 2004",
    "; genzel et al .",
    "recently , it has also been argued ( mcclintock et al .",
    "2006 ) that the source grs  1915 + 105 is a rapidly rotating black hole with spin parameter @xmath12 .",
    "thus , the predictions of the inner disk properties will be incorrect if the pseudo - newtonian modeling fails to include the spin parameter of the black hole .",
    "the potential proposed by m02 has already been used to study the hydrodynamics of the disk around kerr black holes , which shows a dramatic change of the valid parameter space region ; any shock location and other fluid properties change for different rotation parameters of the black hole ( mukhopadhyay 2003 ) .",
    "recently chan et al .",
    "( 2005 , 2006 ) have used this potential for time dependent studies of accretion flow for twodimensional viscous hydrodynamic disk and for threedimensional self - gravitating magnetohydrodynamic disk around rotating black holes using spectral method .",
    "our aim in the present paper is to develop a potential for the general kerr geometry which can be used to mimic the general relativistic effects of the spacetime , enabling us to suitably use it to study the accretion dynamics , especially of a thick disk with the inclusion of vertical outflow .",
    "thus we goal for a generalized potential which is a function of @xmath13 and @xmath14 both and having two components , in radial and vertical direction , in cylindrical coordinate system , hence a vector potential .",
    "this is useful for both quasi - numerical analyzes and time dependent simulations , avoiding the use of complicated relativistic equations , yet capturing the essential physics of spacetime outside of a kerr black hole . in early",
    ", some attempt was made to describe pnp in generalized kerr geometry by , e.g. , dadhich ( 1985 ) , semerk & karas ( 1999 ) , chakrabarti & mondal ( 2006 ) .",
    "the pnps described in first two works , while aim to furnish frame - dragging effects in the newtonian framework , do not reproduce marginally stable and bound circular orbits and specific energy close to the black hole and hence may not be suitable for the hydrodynamical analysis of a keplerian accretion disk , particularly , when aim is to study inner disk properties .",
    "the third one is the modification of chakrabarti & khanna ( 1992 ) potential to mimic approximately the general relativistic effects in accretion disks for @xmath15 .",
    "the potential is a prescription with which the authors maintain the ad - hoc - ness of pw potential and may be used to study accretion disk having particle orbits of small inclination angle at a certain parameter window .",
    "our goal here , however , is to extend the procedure initiated by m02 which can be used to describe a pnp for the general kerr spacetime ; particle motion not confined to the equatorial plane .",
    "the potential given by m02 is more useful to study the dynamics of a vertically averaged thin disk at equatorial plane .",
    "henceforth , we wish to derive a generalized potential applicable for off - equatorial planes following the procedure of m02 which reproduces exactly or in good agreement all the ( inner ) accretion disk properties ( unlike the previous works ) for a general case in kerr geometry . this will be useful to study the thick accretion disk dynamics with the inclusion of vertical outflow and wind .",
    "the potential should reproduce those features of a rotating black hole geometry which have been reproduced by that of m02 at equatorial plane and that of pw for a nonrotating black hole .",
    "we formulate our pnp from the kerr metric .",
    "as the metric is involved directly to our calculation , many of the features of kerr geometry are inherent in our potential .",
    "the axisymmetric pnp we plan to establish here for a general kerr metric is more useful for quasi - analytical studies and time dependent simulations of accretion and wind and related physics as that studied by chan et al .",

    "( 2007 ) using m02 , without loss of any generality .",
    "we arrange the paper in the following manner . in the next section",
    ", we present the basic equations and derive the pnp . in  3",
    ", we compare the various features of dynamics of accreting particles obtained by our potential with that in kerr geometry . finally",
    " 4 presents a discussion with summary .",
    "here we furnish the derivation of our said potential .",
    "it is condensed in three subsections , where we have elucidated the description of the potential starting from the kerr metric .",
    "the kerr spacetime in the boyer - lindquist coordinate system in geometrized units @xmath16 is given by @xmath17 where @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 which is specific angular momentum of the black hole named kerr parameter .",
    "the lagrangian density of the particle of mass @xmath21 in the kerr spacetime is given by @xmath22 where over - dots denote the derivative with respect to proper - time @xmath23 along the curve . from the symmetries , we obtain two constants of motion corresponding to two ignorable coordinates @xmath24 and @xmath25 given by @xmath26 and @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the component of angular momentum of the orbiting particle along spin axis of the black hole ( i.e. parallel to the symmetry axis ) .",
    "the hamiltonian of the system can also be written as @xmath29 the hamiltonian is itself a constant of motion and by usual setting @xmath30 for a particle with nonzero rest mass , we obtain the third constant of motion ( integral of motion ) as @xmath31 the lagrangian and the hamiltonian of the geodesic with the above condition are exactly same .",
    "the three integrals of motion obtained above are sufficient to determine the geodesic equations under restrictive condition like the motion of a test particle confined to an equatorial plane @xmath32 ( e.g. shapiro & teukolsky 1983 ) . to describe the motion of a particle for a generic case around the kerr black hole , with dependency on @xmath14 , a fourth integral of motion is needed which does not come from the symmetries of the metric .",
    "it was discovered by carter ( 1968 ) that such an integral of motion can be obtained explicitly by separability of the hamilton - jacobi equation ( hereinafter hje ) ( also see chandrasekhar 1983 ) given by @xmath33 .",
    "\\label{23}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath34 is called the carter constant ( carter 1968 ) . the above equation together with eqns . ( [ 12 ] ) and ( [ 13 ] )",
    "provides a complete set of integrals of motion for the geodesic of a test particle in the kerr geometry where @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath28 are three constants motion .",
    "it can be seen from the above equation that for a particle always confined to the equatorial plane ( i.e. , @xmath36 and @xmath37 ) , the carter constant @xmath34 is zero . for @xmath38",
    ", @xmath39 is square of the total angular momentum of a particle s orbital motion .",
    "it is to be noted that the information about @xmath14 and @xmath40 for an orbital trajectory is consolidated into a single parameter @xmath34 , which is a conserved quantity . now using eqns .",
    "( [ sag4 ] ) , ( [ 12 ] ) , ( [ 13 ] ) , ( [ 16 ] ) and ( [ 23 ] ) , we obtain the most general equations of motion governing the orbital trajectory of a test particle in the kerr geometry ( bardeen 1972 ; wilkins 1972 ) given by @xmath41 @xmath42 @xmath43 ,   \\label{26}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath44 , \\label{27}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath45 ^ 2 - \\delta \\ , [ m^2 r^2 + ( \\lambda_z - a e)^2 + q ] , \\label{28a}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath46 .",
    "\\label{28}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]      @xmath47 and @xmath48 are in general called the effective potentials describing the particle motion in a generalized kerr spacetime . for a particle moving perpetually at the equatorial plane , the only effective potential that governs the particle motion is @xmath47 with @xmath34 equals to zero . in order to understand the generic orbit ,",
    "both potentials should be accounted for . to have an insight of the nature of orbits in threedimensional kerr geometry",
    ", we recall that for bound geodesics @xmath49 orbits either remain perpetually at the equatorial plane @xmath50 or cross it repeatedly @xmath51 .",
    "more precisely , orbits with @xmath52 ( more general case ) , also called the off - equatorial orbits , are inclined to the equatorial orbital plane .",
    "figure [ fig1 ] shows that the orbital plane of an off - equatorial orbit is inclined at an angle @xmath53 to the equatorial plane , which also means that the orbital plane makes an inclination @xmath53 with the spin axis of the hole ( symmetry axis ) . for a particular orbit ,",
    "the inclination angle @xmath53 is a constant of motion .",
    "however , in general , the plane of an off - equatorial orbit precesses with an angular frequency @xmath54 called lense - thirring precession ( lense & thirring 1918 ) . owing to this fact , the plane of the orbit neither remains fixed , nor crosses the equatorial plane with constant inclination @xmath53 , but rather at a different angle .",
    "looking meticulously , we find that the information of entire @xmath14 motion ( as for a particular off - equatorial orbit , @xmath14 has all arbitrary values and it changes constantly ) is glued up into one single inclination parameter @xmath53 .",
    "thus the motion of the bound orbit in the kerr geometry is now governed by four parameters @xmath13 , @xmath53 , @xmath25 and @xmath24 .    as our intention is to derive a generalized pnp for particle orbits not confined to the equatorial plane , which itself is an approximate quantity , we restrict ourselves to an ideal case of circular orbits . in general ,",
    "due to plane precession , the orbit never remains circular , but have eccentricity .",
    "the study of generic orbits ( inclined and eccentric ) for our particular case is deferred for future .",
    "the circular orbits satisfy @xmath55 . hence to analyze the orbital motion for circular case ,",
    "the radial effective potential @xmath47 is necessary and sufficient .",
    "our next objective is to describe the inclination parameter @xmath53 with known quantities .",
    "as stated earlier , the constant inclination angle @xmath53 ( without considering plane precession ) is the angle between the plane of the orbit and the spin axis of the hole .",
    "as @xmath56 for @xmath38 stated in the preceding subsection , we identify in the cartesian coordinate system @xmath57 approximately .",
    "hence @xmath34 can be treated as the component of square of the total angular momentum in perpendicular to the symmetry axis or to the spin axis ( @xmath58 ) of the black hole or precisely the component projected into the equatorial plane .",
    "however , even for a maximally spinning hole the error is found to be less than a few percent ( glampedakis et al .",
    "2002 ) . with this conjecture ,",
    "the inclination parameter @xmath53 can be defined as ( ryan 1995 ; shapiro 1996 ; hughes 2000 ) @xmath59 taking all these into account , our radial effective potential @xmath47 in eqn .",
    "( [ 28a ] ) with further simplification eventually reduces to @xmath60 thus the effective potential is a function of @xmath13 and @xmath53 ( which is a conserved quantity for a particular orbit ) .",
    "if we consider the effect of lense - thirring precession on the orbital plane , then we need to amend a minor correction with the above definition of inclination angle .",
    "now if you specify for circular orbits , then the effective potential further reduces as @xmath61^{1/2}}{(r^3 + ra^2 + 2ma^2)\\sec i}\\\\ \\label{shu6}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which is essentially the solution for @xmath35 of @xmath62",
    ".      the conditions for a circular orbit are @xmath63 solving for @xmath35 and @xmath28 from eqn .",
    "( [ sa2 ] ) we obtain @xmath64 @xmath65 and @xmath66 are specific energy and specific angular momentum parallel to the symmetry axis respectively , and @xmath13 is the radius of the circular inclined orbit .",
    "we do not represent the functions @xmath67 and @xmath68 explicitly as they are cumbersome .",
    "it can be easily verified that @xmath69 is the total angular momentum of the orbital plane with inclination angle @xmath53 and its direction is perpendicular to the plane of the orbit .",
    "the relativistic specific angular momentum of the matter is defined by the relation @xmath70 ( kozlowski et al .",
    "1978 ) . following m02 and as standard practice",
    ", we can define the keplerian angular momentum distribution @xmath71 .",
    "therefore , corresponding centrifugal force in the kerr geometry can be written as @xmath72\\cos { 2i } \\sec^2 { i}\\bigr\\}^{1/2}\\biggr]^2 } \\nonumber   \\\\ & = & f_g = f_{kr } \\label{sa5}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath73 .",
    "thus from above , @xmath74 can be identified as the generalized gravitational force of the kerr black hole at the keplerian orbit .",
    "the subscript @xmath75 represents a keplerian orbit and subscript @xmath13 represents force in the radial direction .",
    "the above expression reduces to that of m02 at an inclination angle @xmath76 , i.e. particle motion confined to the equatorial plane , and that of pw for @xmath77 .",
    "thus we can say that above eqn .",
    "( [ sa5 ] ) is the most general form of force corresponding to the pnp for a generalized accretion disk around a rotating black hole .",
    "one may be confused with the mathematical form of @xmath74 in eqn .",
    "( [ sa5 ] ) which appears complicated compared to that of pw and thus the pnp approach with @xmath74 appears to be lacking the main motivation and advantage in comparison with full framework of gr .",
    "however , one should also remember that mathematical complexity of accretion disk dynamics in full kerr geometry is beyond comparison with that in much simpler schwarzschild geometry .",
    "therefore , the apparent complex form of @xmath74 above is nothing compared to the complications exist in the set of actual equations in the kerr geometry .",
    "therefore , @xmath74 must be acceptable if it exhibits the essential features of the kerr geometry what we examine in  3 .",
    "the general form of corresponding pnp is @xmath78 therefore , @xmath79 is a generalized axisymmetric potential mimicking the geometry of the general kerr spacetime .",
    "the above potential can be attributed to the threedimensional free - fall acceleration of a test particle around a kerr black hole . in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] we show the evolution of the pseudo - newtonian potential as a function of @xmath13 and @xmath53 for extremally rotating black holes .",
    "as the unstable region including unbound orbits with small inclination is broader for a counter rotating black hole ( described in detail in  3 with tables 1 and 2 ) , @xmath79 increases and tends to diverge at a larger radius than that of the corotating one . for the corotating case , @xmath79 tends to diverge at a very inner region in the vicinity of the black hole only .",
    "figure [ fig3 ] describes the corresponding contours of constant @xmath79 .",
    "it is found that the entire family of contour is shifted towards smaller @xmath13 for the corotating case compared to the counter rotating one . above qualitative features",
    "are same for other kerr parameters .",

    "@xmath86 and @xmath87 are the components of force corresponding to the pseudo - newtonian vector potential components in cylindrical geometry .",
    "once we have the pseudo - newtonian potential ( and force ) , we examine the corresponding density distribution @xmath88 from the poisson s equation @xmath89 shown in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] for extremally rotating black holes .",
    "it is found that the hypothetical density distribution @xmath88 is gaussian along @xmath90 axis for both corotating and counterrotating black holes .",
    "like @xmath79 , @xmath88 increases much faster at an outer radius for the counterrotating black hole than the corotating one .",
    "@xmath88 for the corotating case increases significantly only at very close to the black hole event horizon .",
    "to check the validity of the potential derived in the preceding section , we follow the procedure considered in m02 and mukhopadhyay & misra ( 2003 ) .",
    "we make a comparison to show how far the potential @xmath79 reproduces the values of @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath10 as that in kerr geometry .",
    "we do not repeat the corresponding equations to calculate the parameters in kerr geometry as they are established well in literature ( see e.g. shapiro & teukolsky ) .",
    "however , for completeness , we show them for the pseudo - kerr case .",
    "stability of an orbit requires ( pw ) @xmath91 therefore , we obtain marginally stable orbit @xmath3 by solving eqn .",
    "( [ shu2 ] ) for @xmath13 with  equals to \" sign .",
    "the energy of a particle in the kerr geometry according to @xmath79 is given by @xmath92 therefore marginally bound orbit ( @xmath8 ) can be accounted for by solving the equation @xmath93 for @xmath8 .",
    "in addition , once we know @xmath7 , we can compute @xmath94 , the energy at last stable circular orbit .",
    "we enlist the comparison of @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath10 between the kerr and pseudo - kerr geometry with percentage error for a few inclination parameters @xmath53 in the tables 1,2,3 .",
    "we present the values of above parameters upto the orbital inclination @xmath95 , as we believe that realistically the disk thickness does not exceed beyond the height corresponding to inclination parameter @xmath96 .",
    "it is exciting to note that @xmath7 computed from pseudo - kerr geometry exactly matches to that in kerr geometry for all values of @xmath97 and @xmath53 .",
    "to best of our knowledge , none of the existing pseudo - newtonian potentials proposed for threedimensional kerr geometry reproduces @xmath7 exactly .",
    "table 1 shows that values of @xmath8 obtained from @xmath79 match with that from exact kerr geometry in very good agreement ; with a maximum error @xmath0 at high inclination angle @xmath2 . with the increase of @xmath97 upto certain value , error increases to a maximum ( obtained in the range @xmath98 ) and then decreases to @xmath99 at @xmath100 .",
    "it is to be noted that values of @xmath7 and @xmath8 are independent of @xmath53 at @xmath100 which coincide with the event horizon as the case for @xmath76 .",
    "the energy of an accreting particle at marginally stable orbit is also being reproduced by our pnp in very good agreement with that in exact kerr geometry for @xmath101 , as understood from table 2 .",

    "therefore , our potential is expected to be most selfcontained and useful to study generalized accretion disk including jet , particularly for the hydrodynamical / magnetohydrodynamical analysis .",

    "the potential is effectively useful to study the detailed hydrodynamics of the realistic disk with the inclusion of vertical outflow using newtonian mhd equations , especially in the inner region , where general relativistic effects are very important .",
    "thus the potential satisfies all the criteria to be claimed as good pseudo - newtonian vector potential for a general kerr metric .",
    "in this paper , we have prescribed a most generalized gravitational potential , pseudo - newtonian vector potential , for the modeling of thick accretion disks around rotating black holes . as this potential",
    "is derived from the spacetime metric directly , it naturally carries several essential general relativistic properties .",
    "our potential is valid for co - rotating as well as counter - rotating black holes with all realistic values of orbital inclination .",

    "the full scale disk dynamics is very complicated and there is no virtue to assume that the accretion disk around black holes is fully keplerian in nature .",
    "moreover , the vertical outflow and wind in the form of relativistic jet , which are believed to be present almost in all quasars and microquasars , are predicted to be emanating from a very inner region of a puffed up disk or from a coronal transition region ( liu et al .",
    "1999 ; meyer et al .",
    "in addition , various inner fluid dynamical properties and also the powering of jet depend on spin parameter of the black hole . thus evidently the realistic accretion physics ( especially the accretion dynamics ) around black holes can be studied with our prescribed axisymmetric generalized pnp , capturing the essential physics of gr .",
    "the general relativistic study of full scale dynamics of a realistic accretion disk for a highly turbulent viscous medium with the inclusion of jet and magnetic field is beyond the scope with the present physical and mathematical tools available to us .",
    "most of the numerical studies of general relativistic flows have been performed with simplifying assumptions and remained confine to certain regions .",
