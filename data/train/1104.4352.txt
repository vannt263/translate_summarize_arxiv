    "one striking feature of few - body physics is the presence of universality under a resonant short - range interaction , where the low - energy behavior of the system does not depend on the details of its structure or interactions at short distances .",
    "of particular interest is the existence of bound trimer states for three identical bosons in three dimensions with a resonant two - body interaction , as discussed in 1970 by vitaly efimov  @xcite . at infinite scattering length",
    ", these three - body bound states form an infinite geometric spectrum with a constant ratio between two successive binding energies , indicating a discrete scaling symmetry  @xcite . besides",
    ", the bound trimer states persist rather counterintuitively to negative scattering length regime , where two - body bound states are not existent . after its original proposal ,",
    "the efimov physics has attracted great attention in multi - disciplinary systems , including atomic nuclei  @xcite , @xmath1he trimers  @xcite , and other molecules  @xcite . however , a direct evidence of such peculiar behavior was not achieved for more than three decades until its first observation in an ultracold gas of neutral atoms  @xcite . thanks to the extraordinary controllability of the mutual atomic interaction by tuning through a magnetic feshbach resonance , signatures of trimer bound states have been observed in trapped atomic gases for both negative and positive scattering length regimes  @xcite .",
    "in addition to the original problem of identical bosons , the study of three - body physics has been extended to a variety of other three - particle systems  @xcite , including three distinguishable particles with different scattering lengths and/or different masses  @xcite , two identical fermions with a third atom  @xcite , and the three - atom systems with with non - zero angular momentum  @xcite .",
    "of particular interest is the case of three distinguishable fermions in an ultracold gas of three - component @xmath2li atoms .",
    "in such a system , there exits a broad magnetic feshbach resonance such that all three scattering lengths can be tuned around resonance simultaneously  @xcite , leading to a promising candidate to observe the few - body universal behavior  @xcite .",
    "besides , the few - body problem has also been analyzed in ultracold gases of different atomic species by tuning the interaction across an interspecies feshbach resonance  @xcite .    due to the multi - channel nature of the inter - atomic interaction ,",
    "the efimov states in the three - dimensional ( 3d ) ultracold atomic gases are only metal - stable states . through the three - body recombination process",
    ", two of the three atoms in an efimov trimer can further form a deeply bound dimer and the third one would escape from the trap . in order to prepare stable trimer states , one has to figure out a mechanism to significantly reduce or even prevent three - body recombination .",
    "since the three - body recombination process only occurs when three atoms all come to a close range , one possible route towards this goal is to use geometric confinement to separate atoms such that they can not travel to a same spot .",
    "for instance , if two of the three atoms are individually trapped in two spatially separated one - dimensional ( 1d ) tubes or two - dimensional ( 2d ) disks , and interact with each other via the third atom which is free in all three dimensions ( 3d ) , the three - body recombination is inherently forbidden and the trimer states are stable if they exist in this mixed dimensional configuration .",
    "the few - body problem in mixed dimensions has been recently discussed by nishida and tan  @xcite , where they consider two species of atoms confined in different dimensions and find trimer bound states for a certain range of mass ratio .",
    "however , since the atoms in lower dimensions are not geometrically separated , this configuration suffers the same problem of three - body recombination and the trimer states are unstable .",
    "therefore , nishida consider the problem of two atoms trapped in two separated 1d tubes or 2d layers , and interacts with the third atom which is free in 3d  @xcite .",
    "this 1d-1d-3d or 2d-2d-3d mixture thus can support stable efimov trimer states .    in this manuscript",
    ", we adopt another approach based on born - oppenheimer approximation ( boa ) to study some few - body problems in mixed dimensions , and investigate the existence and properties of stable few - body bound states in a variety of configurations .",
    "for the three - body problems , we consider the systems with two heavy atoms trapped in two parallel 1d tubes ( 1d-1d-3d ) or 2d disks ( 2d-2d-3d ) , plus one light atom moving freely in 3d ( see fig . 1 for illustration ) .",
    "we conclude that the light atom can induce an effective interaction between the two heavy atoms which are spatially separated by the low dimensional traps .",
    "due to this effective interaction , the two heavy atoms can be bound with each other and lead to the formation of a three - body bound state in a very broad parameter region , including the regimes with negative @xmath3-wave scattering lengths between the light and the two heavy atoms , where two - body bound states are not present .",
    "in addition to their existence in mixed dimensions , the universal three - body bound states also acquire some unique features due to the geometric confinement .",
    "especially , we find that the two heavy atoms experience the strongest effective interaction when the scattering length between heavy and light atoms equals to the distance between the two low - dimensional traps . as a consequence of this resonance phenomenon , the binding energy of the ground trimer state takes a peak value around the resonance point , where the scattering length is of a finite value .",
    "we emphasis that , the boa provides a very clear physical picture with which the new resonance phenomenon in the mixed - dimensional systems can be easily explored and clearly described .",
    "we also compare our results with the exact expression  @xcite given by an effective field theory , and conclude that boa works well even in systems with a mass ratio only about @xmath4 .",
    "this finding suggests that boa is a powerful tool for the study of stable heteronuclear few - body bound states in mixed dimensions .    to demonstrate the usage of boa for general few - body problems , we consider as an example the 1d-1d-1d-3d geometry with three heavy atoms confined individually in parallel 1d tubes and a light atom in 3d free space .",
    "we find four - body bound states living in a wide range of scattering lengths .",
    "a similar resonance phenomenon is also observed when the scattering length becomes close to the mutual distances between 1d tubes , in which case the binding energy of the ground tetramer state reaches its maximum when the three 1d tubes form an equilateral triangle .",
    "we also show the scheme to generalize the boa to problems with @xmath5 heavy atoms and a single light one in an arbitrary mixed dimensional geometry .",
    "the mixed dimensional systems discussed in this manuscript can be realized in a mixture of two - species ultracold gases with species - selective dipole potential , as illustrated in recent experiments  @xcite .",
    "the remainder of this manuscript is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we first consider the 1d-1d-3d geometry and outline the boa approach for the three - body problem .",
    "we calculate the effective interaction potential between the two heavy atoms , and observe the new resonance phenomenon . in sec .",
    "iii we solve for the three - body bound states , from which we conclude that a stable trimer state can exist in a broad parameter region , and the binding energy of the ground trimer state takes largest value under the new resonance condition .",

    "the quantum state of this system can be described by the wave function @xmath10 , where @xmath11 are the @xmath12-coordinate of atoms @xmath13 in the 1d tubes , and @xmath14 is the coordinate of atom @xmath8 in 3d .     and @xmath15 confined in two 1d tubes and the light atom @xmath8 moving freely in 3d .",

    "we only consider the cases where the distance @xmath22 between the two tubes is much larger than the characteristic length of the interaction potential between @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",

    "this approximation is applicable when the motion of the heavy atoms @xmath13 is slow enough such that the quantum transitions between different instantaneous eigen - states of the light atom @xmath8 with fixed positions @xmath11 of @xmath13 are negligible .",
