    "motivated by general interest in mesoscopic quantum phenomena , as well as by specific interest in quantum computation , there has been intensive experimental and theoretical effort to study coherence properties and measurement possibilities of solid state qubits . in particular , there has been great interest in different quantum measurement proposals .",
    "this paper is concerned with a type of weak measurement , referred to as a quantum nondemolition ( qnd ) measurement .",
    "qnd measurements are important when one wishes to extract information about a quantum state over a period of time without destroying it .",
    "this type of measurement has been proposed and implemented in optics , @xcite gravity - wave antennas , @xcite and various realizations of harmonic oscillators @xcite .",
    "qnd measurements have also been proposed as a quantum computing measurement method for single spins .",
    "@xcite    a weak measurement of a quantum system occurs when the state of the system is not perfectly correlated with the detector , in contrast to the usual projective measurement .",
    "weak measurement has an advantage over projective measurement in that one can study the coherent oscillations of a single quantum state over a long time period , whereas with projective measurements , one must repeat the measurement many times to see the quantum coherent oscillations",
    ". however , weak measurements have the disadvantage that they usually act back on the system , so that one is never sure whether the result stems from the original quantum state alone .",
    "qnd schemes try to overcome this limitation by coupling the detector to the system via an operator that represents an approximate constant of motion of the quantum system . in this way",
    ", the detector disturbs the system in a minimal way .",
    "[ fig1 ]    recently , averin proposed a qnd scheme for a two - state system that involves a time dependent coupling which follows the qubit in spin - space while weakly measuring it.@xcite the scheme was illustrated with a josephson - junction system as an example of a mesoscopic qubit .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to generalize averin s qubit nondemolition measurement .",
    "the method we propose is quite general and could be implemented in many different detector realizations .",
    "the basic idea is that rather than try to chase the spin around in spin space , we let it come to us .",
    "this is done by strobing the qubit / detector coupling constant in time , so the detector only has access to the qubit at approximately discrete moments . in this reduced problem , by fixing the waiting time between pulses to be a multiple of the qubit oscillation time @xmath0 , the observable we want to measure is static in time .",
    "thus , by measuring over many pulses , a large ( back - action free ) signal - to - noise ratio may be obtained .",
    "the liability of this proposal is that one can not detect what is happening while the coupling is turned off , so the qubit must have a reasonably high quality factor .",
    "however , this scheme has several advantages over the original proposal : ( 1 ) the coupling to the qubit needs only one qubit operator ( the one we want to measure ) , ( 2 ) an arbitrary qubit hamiltonian is allowed , ( 3 ) in the ideal case , no assumptions need to be made about the density matrix of the qubit , and ( 4 ) in the non - ideal case , the pulses may be noisy .",
    "these advantages make this kicked qnd measurement feasible with existing technology .",
    "although kicking the qubit in time sounds rather violent , it is in fact coherent because we choose the pulses to be fast , so they may be described by a series of delta function kicks .",
    "dephasing is induced by the fluctuating measurement apparatus .",
    "the inspiration for the present paper is from a venerable model of quantum chaos , the kicked rotor.@xcite here , the situation is even simpler because the kicked quantum system has only two states .",
    "nevertheless , it is the play - off between the waiting time between kicks and the system dynamics that yields the interesting physics . in this way ,",
    "the kicked qnd measurement is similar to kicked atoms which give rise to accelerator modes@xcite or quantum resonances.@xcite however , the idea of `` stroboscopic measurement '' is actually quite old , and the basic idea appears already for harmonic oscillators in refs .  , and has recently been proposed for the nanomechanical resonator . @xcite",
    "an implementation of the quantum nondemolition experiment is shown in fig .  1 . a double quantum - dot representing a charge qubit is capacitively coupled to a quantum point contact ( qpc ) .",
    "the qpc is opened and closed with the help of a plunger gate with voltage @xmath1 . before considering this specific physical system , we first present general theoretical considerations .",
    "after the detector assumptions are reviewed in sec .",
    "[ da ] , the hamiltonian is introduced and the ideal quantum nondemolition measurement is described in sec .  [ is ] .",
    "deviations are then allowed in secs .  [ de ] and [ np ] with detuning between the detector pulses and the qubit oscillation time , as well as noisy pulses of finite width .",
    "we then describe the details of the quantum double - dot measured by the qpc in sec .",
    "[ imp ] ( see fig .  1 ) .",
    "[ conc ] contains our conclusions , and appendix [ pm ] contains our perturbation method .",
    "a realistic , effective detector has two necessary characteristics : the measurement output should behave classically and the response time of the detector should be much shorter than the period of the qubit oscillations . as mentioned in the introduction , there can be strong detectors whose states are well correlated with the state of the system and thus make a projective measurement of the qubit s state , or there can be weak measurement which only extracts partial information about the quantum state . for the weak measurement , we assume that linear response applies .",
    "@xcite quantitatively , if the bare detector variable is @xmath2 , ( which we treat as a classical random variable ) , coupled to the qubit with the operator @xmath3 , and the detector output is @xmath4 , then it is given by a noisy , random part @xmath5 , plus a small component that reflects the dynamics of the qubit,@xcite ( t ) = q(t ) + _ z(t ) , [ deto ] where @xmath6 is the response coefficient which indicates how sensitive the detector is , and @xmath3 is the qubit operator that we are trying to measure . with these assumptions ,",

    "the spectral density of the detector is now given by s()= _",
    "-^ e^i t c(t ) = s_q + _ -^  e^i t k(t ) .",
    "[ sw ] this is the object that is experimentally accessible for low frequencies .",
    "if the detector is coupled to the qubit statically , over several oscillations the measurement device will measure the desired quantum operator ( @xmath3 ) , but there will be detector back - action altering the qubit dynamics .",
    "this back - action imposes a fundamental limit on the signal - to - noise ratio of 4.@xcite we turn now to the pulsed scheme to overcome this limitation .    instead of following the spin ,",
    "we let it complete the rabi oscillation and couple only after a full rotation .",
    "the time scale of the on / off transition should be slow to the detector ( so linear response still applies ) , but fast to the qubit .",
    "if the effective qubit has higher energy states , then the time scale of the kick must also be sufficiently slow so as not to excite these states . the dynamic coupling will result in a ladder of pulses at the measurement output device , typically of height @xmath6 .",
    "the measurement of the quantum state of the qubit is extracted by examining how the rungs of the ladder are correlated with each other above the white noise background .",
    "we first consider the simplest case where the duration of the pulse is zero .",
    "the qubit is then coupled to the detector by periodic delta functions in time of waiting time @xmath11 , with @xmath2 describing the random detector variable .",
    "the hamiltonian for this ideal scenario is given by h= _",
    "z + _ x + _ n=-^(t - n ) + h_f , [ ham ] where @xmath12 is the detector hamiltonian .",
    "the evolution operator corresponding to this time - dependent hamiltonian may be found from ^t = t , [ u ] where t is the time ordering operator .",
    "the time integration gives the free propagator when the delta function is zero , while during the kick , we can integrate the delta function over a small time interval @xmath13 to find the qubit propagator for the kick : @xmath14 \\right\\ } \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\qquad   = \\exp[-i\\sigma_z f(\\tau)/2 ] .",
    "\\label{inth } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the contribution of the free propagator is proportional to @xmath13 in this interval so it vanishes when we take @xmath15 , while the kick contribution stays finite .",

    "it is important to note that @xmath18 changes during each time step because @xmath2 has its own dynamics while the coupling is turned off that is governed by @xmath12 . so far",
    ", the waiting time interval @xmath11 may be arbitrary . in the ideal case ,",
    "we choose @xmath11 to be @xmath19 , the oscillation period of the qubit .",
    "then , the free propagator is simply the identity matrix , so the total propagator is composed of @xmath20 s only .",
    "now that we have the propagator , all dynamical properties of the qubit may be investigated .",
    "the first important property is that of the coherence of the qubit .",
    "decoherence effects are caused by the randomly changing @xmath2 variable . if we begin kicking with an initially pure state @xmath21 in the @xmath22 basis , the density matrix changes in time as @xmath23 where @xmath24 $ ] by the central limit theorem .",
    "here , we see explicitly that the pulsed coupling keeps the diagonal matrix elements constant in time , but there is exponential dephasing controlled by the fluctuations in @xmath2 whose dephasing rate is simply the noise of the detector variable .",
    "it is clear that information about the @xmath25 and @xmath26 variables is being destroyed by the measuring apparatus , while we have carefully preserved the @xmath22 information of the state .",
    "one simple but important quantity to calculate is the expectation value of @xmath27 , _",

    "[ sz ] for the ideal case , the propagator is just a function of @xmath3 , so @xmath3 is a constant of motion .",
    "tr@xmath28=\\vert\\alpha\\vert^2-\\vert\\beta\\vert^2 $ ] ,",
    "so the expectation value is a measure of the population that is time independent .",

    "this tells us that the accumulated signal about @xmath3 may be arbitrarily larger than the noise of the detector , @xmath8 , regardless of how small the response coefficient @xmath6 is .",
    "we now generalize this ideal behavior to more realistic situations . in this section , we let the waiting time @xmath11 be close to the qubit oscillation time , but not equal .",

    "<S> while dephasing is unavoidable , the nondemolition measurement can ( 1 ) slow relaxation of diagonal density matrix elements , ( 2 ) avoid detector back - action , and ( 3 ) allow for a large signal - to - noise ratio . </S>",
    "<S> deviations from the ideal behavior are studied by allowing for detuning of the waiting time , as well as finite - time , noisy pulses . </S>",
    "<S> the scheme is illustrated with a double - dot qubit measured by a gate - pulsed quantum point contact . </S>"
