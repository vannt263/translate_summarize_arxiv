    "likewise , the above ghost zero modes may produce additional ghost interactions , because @xmath50 from ( [ 206 ] ) and ( [ 207 ] ) , we obtain @xmath51 where @xmath52 , and terms denoted by @xmath53 lack some or all of @xmath41 and @xmath42 . therefore ( [ 209 ] ) leads to @xmath54[cd]}\\psi^{abcd } \\xi \\xi^{\\dagger } \\bar{\\xi } \\bar{\\xi}^{\\dagger}\\ , e^{-\\int dx { \\mathcal{l}}_{\\alpha}}= \\int dc d{\\bar{c}}\\,\\sigma^{[ab][cd]}c^ac^b{\\bar{c}}^c{\\bar{c}}^d\\ , e^{-\\int dx { \\mathcal{l}}_{\\alpha } } ,   { \\label{210}}\\ ] ] where @xmath55[cd]}$ ] is antisymmetric with respect to @xmath56 and @xmath57 , and @xmath58 and @xmath59 as well .",

    "thus we have @xmath293 that is , the rg equation for @xmath135 is unchanged .",
    "it is easy to check that @xmath149 is invariant under the brs transformation @xmath294 the constant @xmath254 is determined to conserve this symmetry . from the partition function",
    "@xmath295 we can derive the equation of motion for @xmath57 as @xmath296 where @xmath297 since @xmath298 and @xmath299 are invariant under the brs transformation , @xmath300 holds .",
    "we substitute @xmath301 and @xmath302 into ( [ d01 ] ) , and use @xmath303 , @xmath304 . then ( [ d01 ] ) leads to @xmath305 .",
    "the consistency with ( [ d02 ] ) requires @xmath156 .",
    "the anti - brs transformation is given by @xmath306 when @xmath307 , from the equation of motion for @xmath146 , @xmath308 holds .",
    "therefore the anti - brs symmetry is broken spontaneously , because @xmath309 in addition , we must set @xmath310 to maintain the brs symmetry . as @xmath311 , the lagrangian does not respect the anti - brs symmetry .      using the constant small parameter @xmath312 ,",
    "the global gauge transformation is defined by @xmath313 , where @xmath314 represents all the fields in @xmath149 .",
    "this symmetry breaks down just like the anti - brs symmetry .",
    "in fact , @xmath307 gives @xmath315 .",
    "and @xmath156 brings @xmath316 .",
    "next we study the partition function @xmath317 .",
    "it transforms as @xmath318 . using @xmath319 and ( [ d02 ] )",
    ", we find @xmath320 namely , because of the brs symmetry , @xmath317 remains invariant under this symmetry .    in the same way , we can show that the breaking by @xmath254 can not be observed in any function @xmath321 , if @xmath322 is brs - invariant . to show this",
    ", we consider the function @xmath323 which appears in @xmath324 . using @xmath325 and @xmath326 , we find ( [ d03 ] ) vanishes .",
    "thus brs invariant green functions are nt broken by @xmath327 .",
