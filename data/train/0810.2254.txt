    "hydrogen is a clean energy carrier and an alternative to carbon based fuels in the long run . @xcite",
    "mobile applications require a compact , dense and safe storage of hydrogen with a high - rate loading and unloading capability .",

    "@xcite metal hydrides are formed by binding hydrogen atoms in the crystal lattice , resulting in very high volumetric densities .",
    "reasonable hydrogen gravimetric densities in metal hydrides can be achieved if lightweight metals are used .",
    "@xmath0 has been studied intensively since it has a relatively high hydrogen gravimetric density of @xmath1 wt .",
    "@xmath2 . bottlenecks in the application of @xmath0 are its thermodynamic stability and slow ( de)hydrogenation kinetics .",
    "these lead to excessively high operating temperatures ( @xmath12 k ) for hydrogen release .",
    "@xcite the hydrogen ( de)sorption rates can be improved by decreasing the particle size down to nanoscales . @xcite it is predicted that particles smaller than @xmath13 nm have a markedly decreased hydrogen desorption enthalpy , which would lower the operating temperature.@xcite the production of such small particles is nontrivial , however , and the hydrogen ( de)sorption rates of larger nanoparticles are still too low .",
    "an additional way of improving the ( de)hydrogenation kinetics of @xmath0 is to add transition metals ( tms).@xcite usually only a few wt .",
    "% is added , since tms are thought to act as catalysts for the dissociation of hydrogen molecules .",
    "recently however , notten and co - workers have shown that the ( de)hydrogenation kinetics is markedly improved by adding more tm and making alloys @xmath14 , tm@xmath15sc , ti , @xmath16 .",
    "@xcite the basic ansatz is that the rutile crystal structure of @xmath0 enforces an unfavorably slow diffusion of hydrogen atoms .",
    "@xcite @xmath17 and @xmath18 have a fluorite structure , which would be more favorable for fast hydrogen kinetics . by adding a sufficiently large fraction of these tms one could force the @xmath14 compound to adopt the fluorite structure .",
    "in this paper we examine the structure and stability of @xmath19 , tm = sc , ti , v , cr , compounds by first - principles calculations . in particular , we study the relative stability of the rutile versus the fluorite structures . this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",

    "however , the parameter that is most relevant for hydrogen storage is the hydrogenation enthalpy . assuming that the alloy does not dissociate upon dehydrogenation ,",

    "in contrast to ref .  , we use the spin - polarized fcc alloy for calculating the contributions ( i ) and ( ii ) , as this will make the extraction of the hydrogenation enthalpy easier . in the cases where the magnetic moment is nonzero , we study both ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic ordering . as for the simple hydrides , cr compounds generally have an antiferromagnetic ordering .",

    "it is in fact comparable to that of pure mg , see fig .",
    "[ fig : edecomposed](a ) . at the composition @xmath58 ,",
    "the effect on the energy of changing the unit cell volume is dominated by mg . for these compounds",
    "the lattice expansion only plays a minor role in the formation energy , in contrast to the simple hydrides , where the lattice expansion gives a significant contribution . the hydrogen insertion energies ( iii )",

    "only the compound @xmath64 has a somewhat smaller hydrogen insertion energy .",
    "the reason for this is that the energy gained by magnetic ordering of the alloy @xmath65 is relatively high , as compared to the other compounds .",

    "this result agrees with the experimental finding that of the mg - tm alloys considered here , only a stable mg - sc alloy exists in bulk form .",
    "the substantial increase of the alloy formation enthalpy in the series sc , ti , v , is largely responsible for the variation of the formation energy of the corresponding hydrides @xmath58 .",

    "[ fig : edecomposed ] .",
    "since the most stable structure of the alloys is not always the fcc structure , one should however subtract the energy required to convert the alloys from their most stable structure to an fcc structure .",
    "we find , for instance , that for @xmath68 the fcc structure is 0.04 ev / f.u .",
    "less stable than the hcp structure .",
    "indeed thin film experiments on @xmath69 yield yield an hcp structure.@xcite for @xmath70 the fcc structure is more stable than the hcp structure by 0.05 ev / f.u ..    the calculated hydrogenation enthalpy of @xmath70 is @xmath71 ev / f.u . , in good agreement with the experimental value of @xmath72 ev / f.u .. @xcite the calculated hydrogenation enthalpy of @xmath68 is @xmath73 ev / f.u .",

    "the most stable structures of @xmath66 , tm @xmath15 v , cr , are not known , but judging from the sc and ti compounds the energy difference between the fcc and the most stable structures will be small . neglecting this energy difference upper bounds for the hydrogenation enthalpies of @xmath67 and @xmath65 are @xmath74 and @xmath75 ev / f.u .",

    "again this indicates that alloying mg with these tms does not improve the hydrogenation enthalpy substantially .",
    "in summary , we have studied the structure and stability of @xmath19 , tm = sc , ti , v , cr , compounds by first - principles calculations .",
    "we find that for @xmath76 the fluorite structure is more stable than the rutile structure , whereas for @xmath77 the rutile structure is more stable .",
    "this phase transition correlates with the observed slowing down of the ( de)hydrogenation kinetics in these compounds if @xmath9 exceeds the critical composition @xmath57 .",
    "the density of states of these compounds is characterized by the valence bands being dominated by contributions from the hydrogen atoms , wherease the tms have partially occupied @xmath21 states around the fermi level .",
