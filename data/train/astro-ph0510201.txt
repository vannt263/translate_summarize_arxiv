    "the sources may include stellar feedback ( i.e. local events ) and galactic rotation ( i.e. large - scale motions ) .",
    "the physical mechanism converting these energies into turbulence has not been well understood .",
    "we expect that it affects the morphology of the gas structure as well as the turbulent motions .",
    "in particular , the shape of molecular clouds might indicate the possible energy source and physical mechanism .",

    "the relation is confirmed for the clouds at terminal velocities , which do not suffer from the distance ambiguity .",
    "the existence of the relation at terminal velocities justifies the assumption that virtually all clouds are gravitationally bound .",
    "each cloud is inspected by eye in @xmath22 , @xmath23 , and @xmath24 maps ; possibly - blended clouds ( about 10% ) were removed from the sample ( note that this operation does not change the following results ; and the blending affected very few clouds as discussed in  [ sec : spin ] ) .",

    "the sound speed corresponding to the molecular gas temperature of @xmath53 is @xmath54 .",
    "the much larger velocity widths ( @xmath42 and @xmath44 ) indicate that the internal gas motions are supersonic .",
    "the position angles and axis ratios of molecular clouds are calculated by diagonalizing the moment of inertia matrix as , @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the brightness temperature at a pixel ( @xmath57,@xmath58 ) , and @xmath59 and @xmath60 are the distances from the emission centroid to the pixel in the @xmath9- and @xmath10-directions .",

    "the axis ratio and position angle of clouds correspond to @xmath63 and @xmath62 , respectively .",
    "the position angle is defined from the positive @xmath10-direction going counterclockwise to the positive @xmath9 .",
    "the direction along the galactic plane is @xmath64 .",
    "figure [ fig : elon ] shows the histograms of axis ratio and position angle . the axis ratio has the peak at about 1.8 , indicating that the molecular clouds are significantly elongated .",
    "the population of round clouds , having the axis ratio of 1 , is small .",
    "the position angle peaks at @xmath65 ( i.e. along the galactic plane ) .",
    "clouds with @xmath65 is about two times more populated than those with @xmath66 or @xmath67 . _ therefore , molecular clouds are elongated predominantly in the direction of the galactic plane .",
    "_ we separate small clouds ( @xmath68 ) from large clouds ( @xmath69 ) in figure [ fig : elon ] . as well as the large clouds , the small clouds are predominantly elongated along the galactic plane .",
    "these clouds are much smaller than the width of the gas disk ( about 100 pc ) and stellar disk ( about 600 pc ) .",
    "it is possible that the elongation is supported by the spin of molecular clouds . in order to evaluate this , we measured the velocity gradient in molecular clouds ( projection on the sky ) and the position angle perpendicular to the maximum velocity gradient , i. e. parallel to the axis of possible spin ( figure [ fig : spin ] ) .",
    "the velocity gradient is estimated from the observed velocity field by fitting a plane .",
    "the position angle @xmath70 is oriented with @xmath71 at @xmath72 , increasing toward @xmath73 .",
    "typical velocity gradients @xmath74 projected on the sky are about 0.15 @xmath75 .",
    "we did not correct for the apparent velocity gradient due to the projected lsr velocity over the diameter of the clouds , since this gradient is at most @xmath76 , assuming a rotation velocity of @xmath77 .",
    "prograde and retrograde spins with respect to the galactic rotation are indicated with different patterns , and are equally populated .",
    "figure [ fig : spin ] _ right _ can be directly compared to figure [ fig : elon ] _",
    "right_. if spin supports the elongation , the @xmath70 should be distributed similarly to the @xmath62 ; their peaks should be related as @xmath78 .",
    "the figures , however , show that the spin is randomly oriented and has no dominant peak .",
    "figure [ fig : diff ] shows the difference of the position angles of the elongation axis and spin axis .",
    "this figure shows no significant peak at @xmath79 , compared with figure [ fig : elon ] _ right _ and considering the statistical error @xmath80 .",
    "_ therefore , the cloud elongations are not supported by internal spins , but should be related to the internal velocity dispersions ( supersonic motions ) .",
    "_    it is noteworthy that confusion ( blending ) in cloud identification is likely to align the apparent spin axis perpendicular to an elongation  it is most likely that two clouds are slightly offset in space and velocity .",
    "the opposing result strongly indicates that the blending is not important in our sample .",
    "the supersonic motions within molecular clouds must be regenerated continuously ; otherwise they decay rapidly within a cloud crossing time .",
    "_ mechanisms for driving the supersonic motion must also account for the cloud elongation along the galactic plane .",
    "_ in light of the new results , we discuss a possible energy source and mechanism for driving supersonic motions and cloud elongations .      among several suggested energy sources ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , two sources , i.e. stellar feedback and galactic rotation , are most often considered .",
    "most other sources extract their intrinsic energies from these two .",
    "stellar feedback includes protostellar outflows , stellar winds , ionizing radiation , and supernova explosions .",
    "these feedback mechanisms , however , release energy isotropically or in random directions .",
    "such processes are unlikely to cause the preferential orientation of molecular clouds .",
    "they would cause a random orientation .",
    "supernovae are the most energetic feedback mechanism @xcite .",
    "there are some arguments for supernovae - induced dense gas formation and supersonic turbulence .",
    "if supernova blastwaves , however , compress surrounding material and induce molecular cloud formation , their round expansion will produce _ no _ preferential orientation .",
    "the blastwaves would escape from the galactic disk predominantly in the direction normal to the galactic plane .",
    "then , most molecular clouds would be elongated perpendicular to the plane .",
    "the stellar feedback is unlikely to be the dominant cause of the elongation of molecular clouds .",
    "evidence has been accumulated for the presence of molecular clouds without star formation activity @xcite .",
    "stellar feedback can not supply energy to such clouds .",
    "high mass star - forming regions are localized around spiral arms in the galaxy @xcite and in external galaxies @xcite .",
    "it is also unlikely that the energy supply from stellar feedback suffices to maintain supersonic motions in interarm molecular clouds .",
    "since the cloud elongation has the preferential direction , the energy source is likely to have a similar preferred direction .",
    "galactic rotation has an rotation axis , and is a likely energy source .",
    "galactic rotation provides an enormous reservoir of energy ; it can maintain the elongations and supersonic motions over the galactic age .",
    "even if molecular clouds are only transient structures in large - scale interstellar turbulence , the anisotropic shapes should indicate the origin of the turbulence .",
    "it is still likely that the galactic rotation is the main source of the turbulant energy .",
    "how might the rotation energy be transfered to random motion in molecular clouds ?",
    "energy transfer from rotation to random motions generally occurs in a differentially rotating disk , if mass elements orbiting at slightly different radii pull on each other @xcite .",
    "@xcite pointed out that many types of viscous stress , including reynolds , maxwell , and gravitational stresses , can cause the energy transfer from rotation to random motion .",
    "for example , @xcite found with an analytic calculation that cloud - cloud gravitational interactions ( gravitational stress ) can transfer the orbital energy of clouds into random motions _ between _ clouds [ but they did not discuss internal motions ] .",
    "@xcite used hydrodynamical simulations and showed that the rotational energy could cascade into smaller scales ( down to their resolution limit , i.e. the size of giant molecular clouds ) , owing to local tidal force among clouds , filaments , and voids .",
    "perhaps , this cascade proceeds down to the internal motions of the clouds .",
    "if tidal gravitational torques exerted by passing clouds is the cause of the velocity dispersions , the preferred elongation of molecular clouds would be produced naturally .",
    "the mean separation of molecular clouds is about @xmath81 .",
    "this is larger than the thickness of the galactic molecular disk @xmath34 .",
    "tidal radius of molecular clouds should be at least a few times larger than their diameter , and thus is not negligible compared with the disk thickness .",
    "tidal interaction should occur predominantly in the galactic plane ; it may generate asymmetric velocity dispersions which cause the elongation along the galactic disk .",
    "a slight exchange of angular momentum may occur during tidal interaction and spin up clouds .",
    "the spin axis might become perpendicular to the elongation , however , this effect should be little . in case that two clouds pass by at the distance @xmath82 and velocity @xmath83 ( typical cloud - cloud velocity dispersion ) , the tidal interaction would increase the velocity gradient within a cloud by at most @xmath84 if the two clouds are strongly coupled .",
    "this is negligible compared with the observed velocity gradient . in addition , random encounters would suppress the increase of angular momentum .",
    "the spin - up is not significant even if the tidal interaction is the cause of supersonic motions .",
    "we discussed only gravitational interactions between molecular clouds .",
    "some other density fluctuations , such as filamentary structure in gas , would also strengthen the tidal field around clouds .",
    "there are , of course , some other possible mechanisms introduced by magnetic field , surrounding diffuse gas ( hi and @xmath85 ) , and gradients in stellar potential .",
    "further discussions would require theoretical researches .",
    "we showed that @xmath0co molecular clouds are elongated predominantly along the galactic plane .",
    "the elongations are not supported by the spins of molecular clouds , but should be supported by supersonic velocity dispersions in molecular clouds . in order to avoid a rapid decay of the supersonic motions , there must be some mechanisms to drive them continuously .",
    "the driving mechanisms must also account for the elongations of molecular clouds .",
    "the driving energy is likely to come from large - scale motions , such as the galactic rotation , and not from stellar feedback .    the boston university - fcrao milky way galactic ring survey ( grs ) is a joint project of boston university and five college radio astronomy observatory , funded by the national science foundation under grants ast-9800334 , ast-0098562 , & ast-0100793 .",
