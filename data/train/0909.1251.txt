    "floer homology invented by floer @xcite , has proven to be a very powerful tool in the symplectic geometry and related areas . in the case of floer cohomology of lagrangian submanifolds , fukaya , oh , ohta and ono @xcite has defined the @xmath0-algebra of a lagrangian submanifold or the @xmath0-bimodule of a pair of lagrangian submanifolds in the full generality . unlike the case of hamiltonian floer cohomology",
    ", these @xmath0-algebra or @xmath0-bimodules do not always define floer homologies as they are obstructed in general . in @xcite , they have studied the obstruction theory and showed that if the obstructions vanish , these @xmath0-structures give rise to the floer cohomology theories , and can be applied to the study of symplectic topology or homological mirror symmetry ( see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite for example ) .",
    "but if a lagrangian submanifold is obstructed ( see section 2 and 7 for its definition ) , its floer cohomology is not defined . in this paper , we explore alternative ways of defining homology , by considering hochschild and cyclic homology of an @xmath0-objects and chevalley - eilenberg or cyclic chevalley - eilenberg homology of their underlying @xmath1 objects .    such homology theories are well - known for associative ( or lie ) algebras and also for @xmath0 , or @xmath1-algebras without @xmath2 .",
    "( we refer readers to @xcite for the definitions using non - commutative geometry ) .",
    "the definition easily extends to the case with with @xmath2 , but it turns out that the usual homological algebra properties of these homology theories do not immediately extend as the usual contracting homotopy of the bar complex does not work with @xmath3 . but by working with novikov fields , we study their homological algebras and show that we still have the reduced hochschild homology , and @xmath4-cyclic complex where conne - tsygan @xmath5-operator actually has an additional term compared to the standard case .",
    "the main motivation to study these homology theories is to have a well - defined floer homology theory even in the obstructed cases .",
    "we show that even in the obstructed cases , these homology theories are well - defined and invariant under various choices involved and define invariants of a homotopy class of @xmath0-objects .",
    "we remark that there has been different approaches to consider obstructed cases , by cornea and lalonde @xcite using morse functions and by fukaya @xcite using the relationship with loop space homology and floer homology .",
    "we observe that the topological dual theory of the chevalley - eilenberg homology theory of @xmath1-objects is related to the cluster homology theory announced by cornea and lalonde in @xcite .",
    "their cluster homology corresponds to the extended cyclic chevalley - eilenberg homology of @xmath1-algebras and their symmetric fine floer homology corresponds to chevalley - eilenberg homology of @xmath1-modules .",
    "unfortunately , analytic details of the construction of cluster homology theory in @xcite has not been rigorously established yet , but the homology theories in this paper may provide an alternative way to consider such theories in the obstructed cases .",
    "we remark that the study of the dual geometry of an @xmath0 or @xmath1-algebras which was initiated by kontsevich @xcite .",
    "the @xmath0-algebra , which is a coalgebra has a dual which can be regarded as a differential graded algebra ( dga ) .",
    "actually , in contact geometry , the dual language has been mostly used ( see chekanov @xcite , eliashberg - givental - hofer @xcite for example ) and the analogue of unobstructed condition is the notion of augmentation . in both cases , if it is unobstructed or has an augmentation , the deformed homology theory provides much more refined informations .    due to the use of novikov coefficients , to take the appropriate dual of the filtered @xmath0 or @xmath1 objects , we consider topological duals induced by energy filtrations .",
    "in fact , the completion used in this paper is somewhat different from that of cornea and lalonde , resulting different behavior of the homology theories in obstructed cases .",
    "but this does not bring a major difference as cornea has informed me that the filtration used here also works in the cluster homology setting .",
    "there is an easy way to obtain cyclic homology complex of an @xmath0-algebra or a cyclic chevalley - eilenberg homology complex from the bar complex .",
    "recall that @xmath0-algebra @xmath6 , which is given by countably many operations @xmath7 , is algebraically a tensor coalgebra @xmath8)$ ] with a codifferential @xmath9 .",
    "the complex @xmath10),{\\widehat{d}})$ ] is called a bar complex , whose homology is trivial(see lemma [ bartrivial ] ) .",
    "one can consider cyclic or symmetric bar complex , which is a subcomplex of the bar complex by considering the fixed elements of the natural cyclic or symmetric group action .",
    "the homology of these subcomplexes are in fact the cyclic homology of @xmath0-algebra or cyclic chevalley - eilenberg homology of the induced @xmath1-algebra . here , as any associative algebra can be regarded as a lie algebra whose bracket is given by the commutator , an @xmath0-algebra ( @xmath0-module ) gives rise to an underlying @xmath1-algebra ( @xmath1-module ) by symmetrizing all @xmath0-operations and chevalley - eilenberg homology is their lie algebra homology .",
    "we remark that the existence and invariance of homology of these subcomplexes has been known to authors of @xcite .",
    "( note that what we call cyclic bar complex is different from the cyclic bar complex of getzler - jones @xcite )    we will also consider hochschild homology of @xmath0-bimodule of a pair of lagrangian submanifolds when one lagrangian submanifold is obtained as a hamiltonian isotopy of the other and this homology contains information about their intersections .",
    "similarly , one can consider the induced @xmath1-module of such pair over the @xmath1-algebra of such a lagrangian submanifold and consider its chevalley - eilenberg homology .    if @xmath11 is an obstructed @xmath0-algebra of lagrangian submanifold with non - trivial primary obstruction , then the chevalley - eilenberg floer ( co)homology , and the extended cyclic chevalley - eilenberg floer cohomology vanish .",
    "recall that in @xcite , cluster complex with free terms has vanishing cluster homology .",
    "this may be interpreted as the vanishing of chevalley - eilenberg floer homology when @xmath3 if we use the filtration of @xcite .",

    "then , its hochschild homology of the @xmath0-algebra of @xmath12 vanishes and also the chevalley - eilenberg homology vanishes    now , the following question is related to the maslov class conjecture in the obstructed case , but we do not know whether it is true or not .",

    "does the cyclic homology of the @xmath0-algebra of @xmath12 vanish ? also does the cyclic chevalley - eilenberg homology vanish ?    if the answer for the first question is yes , then together with the theorem [ thm:2 ] it should prove the maslov class conjecture even for the obstructed relatively spin compact lagrangian submanifolds in @xmath13 that its maslov class vanishes ( see @xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite ) and we leave this for future research .",

    "we have been informed by cornea that the filtration used here also can be used in the cluster homology theory , and we thank him for his comments .",
    "but we do not know whether the filtration used in @xcite can be used here to provide an invariant homology theory as we prove the invariance before we take the dualization and then use lemma [ ceiso ] .",

    "the condition on @xmath869 guarantees that the following is an element of @xmath864 . @xmath871 as @xmath872 , and @xmath873 , we have @xmath874 . as @xmath821 is a derivation of the dga @xmath864 , we also have @xmath875 .",
    "hence , @xmath876 as @xmath365 is a coboundary , this implies that any @xmath821-cocycle @xmath877 is a coboundary .",

    "<S> lagrangian floer homology in a general case has been constructed by fukaya , oh , ohta and ono , where they construct an @xmath0-algebra or an @xmath0-bimodule from lagrangian submanifolds , and studied their obstructions and deformation theories . </S>",
    "<S> but for obstructed lagrangian submanifolds , the standard lagrangian floer homology can not be defined .    </S>",
    "<S> we explore several well - known cohomology theories on these @xmath0-objects and explore their properties , which are well - defined and invariant even in the obstructed cases . </S>",
    "<S> these are hochschild and cyclic homology of an @xmath0-objects and chevalley - eilenberg or cyclic chevalley - eilenberg homology of their underlying @xmath1 objects . </S>",
    "<S> we explain how the existence of @xmath2 effects the usual homological algebra of these homology theories . </S>",
    "<S> we also provide some computations . </S>",
    "<S> we show that for an obstructed @xmath0-algebra with a non - trivial primary obstruction , chevalley - eilenberg floer homology vanishes , whose proof is inspired by the comparison with cluster homology theory of lagrangian submanifolds by cornea and lalonde .    </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , we also provide an example of an obstructed case whose cyclic floer homology is non - vanishing . </S>"
