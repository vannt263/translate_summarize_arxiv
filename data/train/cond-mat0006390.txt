    "the ability of a simulation to successfully predict the properties of real materials is primarily dependent upon the accuracy of the model interaction potential used .",
    "the construction of model interactions generally involves the optimization of the parameters of the potential with respect to _ mechanical _ properties of the material ( crystal lattice constants , elastic constants , liquid density , etc . ) as determined from experiment or _",
    "ab initio _ calculations .",
    "non - mechanical properties ( i.e. those not obtainable as local averages over coordinates ) such as phase transition temperatures are difficult to include in such optimization procedures and are generally calculated for the optimized model _ a posteriori _ , and the agreement of such quantities with experiment is not guaranteed .",
    "however , for some applications that deal directly with such properties , such as in the study of solid - liquid interfaces@xcite in which the melting temperature plays an obviously important role , it is desirable to develop efficient procedures for including such non - mechanical properties in the optimization . in this work ,",
    "we outline a general procedure for adjusting the potential parameters for a system designed to model a real system to improve the agreement of the melting point of that system with the experimental value . as an example we present an application to an existing embedded atom model of aluminum  @xcite .",
    "our re - parameterization scheme is based on the powerful gibbs - duhem integration method developed by kofke@xcite . in this technique ,",
    "the derivative along the coexistence curve of any coexistence condition ( such as melting temperature or pressure ) with respect to any parameter of the potential can be determined by an appropriate configurational average at a previously determined melting point .",
    "the method is generated by the integration of a generalized gibbs - duhem equation and the steps are analogous to the derivation of the familiar clapeyron equation for the slope of the p - t coexistence curve .",
    "gibbs - duhem integration has been shown to be quite successful in efficiently determining the coexistence conditions for entire classes of potentials .",
    "for example , the phase diagram for the class of repulsive inverse power potentials , @xmath2 , was determined@xcite by starting with the known hard - sphere ( @xmath3 ) coexistence and integrating the derivative of coexistence curve with respect to the parameter @xmath4 .",
    "the method has also proved useful in a variety of other applications  @xcite .    in the current application ,",
    "one begins with a model potential , parameterized for a real system in the usual way with respect to mechanical properties of the real system .",
    "the melting temperature ( or pressure ) for the model system is then calculated by thermodynamic integration .",
    "once this is done , the derivative of the melting temperature ( or pressure ) with respect to all parameters of the system can be determined via separate simulations on the coexisting fluid and solid using the gibbs - duhem procedure .",
    "the calculated derivatives allow an assessment of the effect of each individual parameter on the melting point . from this information an appropriate scheme to adjust the parameters to improve the melting point",
    "can be devised in such a way that the agreement with the other experimental properties is not unacceptably compromised .",
    "the gibbs - duhem integration and our re - parameterization scheme is outlined in more detail in the next section .    as a test application of this procedure ,",
    "we examine an embedded atom model of aluminum developed by mei and davenport@xcite .",
    "this particular model was chosen for three reasons : first , the importance of aluminum as a material makes the development of an accurate model potential for simulation purposes desirable .",
    "second , the large number of parameters and complicated nature of the embedded atom potential increases the need for a systematic , as opposed to _",
    "ad hoc _ procedure for adjusting the melting point .",
    "in addition , the zero - pressure melting point for the mei - davenport potential has been previously determined@xcite to be 800@xmath5k somewhat lower than the experimental melting point of aluminum at 933k .",
    "( note that , the melting point determined by mei and davenport was calculated for a 256 particle system - the actual value for this potential in the thermodynamic limit is slightly higher at 826.4@xmath61.3k . )",
    "we find that , in this specific case , only one of the parameters of the potential has any significant effect on the potential and that changing this parameter according to the gibbs - duhem procedure yields a new model with the correct experimental melting point with no significant change in the quality of the agreement of the quantities with respect to which the model was originally optimized .",
    "details of this calculation as well as a description of the model can be found in section  [ sec : ourmethod ] below .",
    "the technique of gibbs - duhem integration has been well described previously by kofke@xcite , but in the interests of completeness and clarity we repeat the basic derivation here .",
    "consider a single - component system with an arbitrary interaction potential , @xmath7 , where the @xmath8 are the atomic coordinates and the @xmath9 are the parameters that define the potential - no restriction to pairwise additivity need be assumed .",
    "assume there are two phases @xmath10 and @xmath11 in coexistence at a temperature @xmath12 and pressure @xmath13 .",
    "on the surface of coexistence , the chemical potentials ( molar gibbs free energies ) of the two phases must be equal . to quantify how changes in @xmath13,@xmath12 , and @xmath9 will affect the chemical potential",
    "one can define a generalized gibbs - duhem equation , @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the chemical potential , @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the entropy and volume per particle , respectively , and the @xmath18 are generalized thermodynamic variables conjugate to the potential parameters , @xmath19 , defined as @xmath20    now as one moves infinitesimally away from the original coexistence point @xmath21 to another point @xmath22 on the surface of coexistence , the change in @xmath15 must be identical in both phases .",
    "this condition together with eq .",
    "[ dmu ] gives @xmath23 @xmath24 where @xmath25 and @xmath26 are the chemical potentials for each of the respective phases .",
    "assuming constant pressure ( @xmath27 ) , since we are interested here in changes in the transition temperature , the previous equation can be rearranged to give @xmath28 where we have also assumed that at coexistence , @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the latent heat per particle for the phase transition .",
    "( note that , the corresponding equations for the @xmath31 can be easily obtained by replacing @xmath32 in eq .",
    "[ gd : deriv ] with @xmath33 . )",
    "the @xmath18 can be related to mechanical averages that can be easily calculated in a molecular dynamics or monte carlo simulation .",
    "first , the gibbs free energy is related to the isothermal - isobaric distribution , @xmath34 , as follows .",
    "@xmath35 which for a classical system with interaction potential @xmath36 is given by @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the volume . taking the derivative of eq .",
    "[ gnpt ] with respect to the parameter @xmath9 gives    @xmath39 @xmath40    using eq .",
    "[ lambdadef ] we have @xmath41    using eq .",
    "[ gd : deriv ] and eq .",
    "[ lamf ] we can calculate the change necessary in each of the parameters @xmath42 , to alter the melting temperature of our interaction potential by some arbitrary amount . as long as the changes are not too large , the calculation can be greatly simplified by the assumption that the deviation remains linear . @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the melting point of the original model with parameters @xmath45 .",
    "( if the linear approximation does not hold - and it should always be checked - one could integrate the differential equation using an appropriate numerical technique . ) from a single simulation , one could calculate the necessary change in all the different parameters of the potential corresponding to a particular change in the melting temperature .",
    "one could then , use this information to construct a cost function to re - optimize the potential that includes the previously used set @xmath46 of experimentally determined ( mechanical ) properties as well as the experimental melting temperature @xmath47 as optimization targets .",
    "for example , a linear least squares procedure could be utilized using appropriately chosen set of weight functions @xmath48 : @xmath49 ^ 2 +   \\sum_j w_i [ a_j^{\\mbox{exp.}}- a_j(\\{x_i\\})]^2   \\;.\\ ] ] @xmath50 ^ 2 \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\ ; + \\sum_j w_i [ a_j^{\\mbox{exp.}}- a_j(\\{x_i\\})]^2   \\;.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] ( in the example application discussed in the next section , we found that only one of the several parameters of the potential had any significant effect on the melting point , which greatly simplified the re - parameterization by making it possible to modify the potential without having to directly use such a cost function .",
