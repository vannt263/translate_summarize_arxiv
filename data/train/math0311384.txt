    "during the last 20 years the theory of frames has been growing rapidly , since several new applications have been developed .",
    "for example , besides traditional applications as signal processing , image processing , data compression , and sampling theory , frames are now used to mitigate the effect of losses in packet - based communication systems and hence to improve the robustness of data transmission @xcite , and to design high - rate constellations with full diversity in multiple - antenna code design @xcite .    to handle these emerging applications of frames new methods",
    "have to be developed .",
    "one starting point is to first build frames `` locally '' and then piece them together to obtain frames for the whole space .",
    "one advantage of this idea is that it would facilitate the construction of frames for special applications , since we can first construct frames or choose already known frames for smaller spaces . and",
    "in a second step one would construct a frame for the whole space from them .",
    "therefore it is necessary to derive conditions for these components , so that there exists a construction , which yields a frame for the whole space with special properties .",
    "various approaches to piecing together familes of vectors to get a frame for the whole space have been done over the years going back to duffin and schaeffer s original work @xcite .",
    "one approach used in the wavelet as well as in the gabor case @xcite is to start with non - frame sequences and piece them together to build frames for the whole space .",
    "another is to build frames locally and piece them together orthogonally to get frames .",
    "we refer to heil and walnut @xcite for an excellent introduction to these methods and gabor frames in general .",
    "recently , another approach was introduced by fornasier @xcite .",
    "fornasier uses subspaces which are quasi - orthogonal to construct local frames and piece them together to get global frames .    in this paper we will formulate a general method for piecing together local frames to get global frames .",
    "the importance of this approach is that it is both necessary and sufficient for the the construction of global frames from local frames .",
    "some of these results are generalizations of fornasier s work @xcite although they were done before his papers became available to us .",
    "another motivation comes from the theory of c*-algebras . just recently",
    "casazza , christensen , lindner , and vershynin @xcite proved that the so - called `` feichtinger conjecture '' is equivalent to the weak bourgain - tzafriri conjecture .",
    "the feichtinger conjecture states that each bounded frame is a finite union of riesz basic sequences .",
    "then , casazza and vershynin @xcite showed that the kadison - singer problem is equivalent to the strong bourgain - tzafriri conjecture and that these two problems have a positive solution if and only if both the feichtinger conjecture and the @xmath0-conjecture have positive solutions .",
    "the @xmath0-conjecture states : for every @xmath1 , every unit norm riesz basis is a finite union of @xmath2-unconditional basic sequences .",
    "a unit norm sequence @xmath3 is a @xmath2-basic sequence if for every sequence of scalars @xmath4 we have @xmath5 to attack these problems it is important to know into which components we can divide a frame . as we will see in this paper",
    ", the necessary divisions will form a frame of subspaces for the space . at this time ,",
    "it is not even known how to divide a frame into two infinite frame sequences .    in this paper",
    "we want to answer the following two questions , which relate to the two different motivations :    * let @xmath6 be a collection of closed subspaces in a hilbert space @xmath7 in which we want to decompose our function , where each subspace @xmath8 is equipped with a weight @xmath9 , which indicate its importance .",
    "when can we find frames for @xmath8 for each @xmath10 so that the collection of all of them is a frame with special properties for the whole space @xmath7 ? * let @xmath11 be a frame for a hilbert space @xmath7 , and let @xmath12 be a partition of @xmath13 so that @xmath14 is a frame sequence for each @xmath15 . which relations exist between the closed linear spans of @xmath14 , @xmath15 ?",
    "we start our consideration by giving a brief review of the definitions and basic properties of frames and bases and stating some notation in section [ review ] .    in section [ fos ] it will turn out that both questions above lead to the definition of a frame of subspaces . in the first subsection we will state the definition of a frame of subspaces for a given family of closed subspaces @xmath6 in a hilbert space and a family of weights @xmath16 .",
    "then it is shown that this definition leads to some answers to the above questions ( see theorem [ transfer_frame ] ) , since it shows that frames of subspaces behave as a link between local components of a frame and the global structure .",
    "this will also enlighten the advantage of our approach , since now we can choose the frames for the single subspaces @xmath8 arbitrarily and always get a frame for the whole hilbert space by just collecting them together .",
    "thus it differs from previous approaches and is a generalization of the approach of fornasier @xcite .",
    "it will turn out that frames of subspaces behave as a generalization of frames .",
    "we first give a definition of completeness of a family of subspaces and show that the relation between this property and the notion of a frame of subspaces is similar to the relation between the definition of completeness of a sequence and a frame . further in subsection [ frame_prop ] we introduce an analysis and a synthesis operator , a frame operator , and a dual frame of subspaces for a given frame of subspaces and prove that they behave in an analogous way as the corresponding objects in abstract frame theory .",
    "we even obtain a reconstruction formula using these ingredients ( proposition [ reconstruction ] ) . the next subsection deals with parseval frames of subspaces , which share several properties with parseval frames .",
    "finally in subsection [ roti ] we show that using the theory of frames of subspaces we can construct several useful resolutions of the identity .",
    "section [ riesz_dec ] deals with riesz decompositions , which are a generalization of the notion of riesz bases to our general setting .",
    "we further define minimality for a family of subspaces and show that it behaves as expected .",
    "also exactness is defined in a canonical way .",
    "however , it will turn out that this property is much weaker than exactness of a frame ( compare theorem [ riesz_minimal_exact ] ) .",
    "some constructions are given in section [ constr ] .",
    "here we first state some results which help constructing frames of subspaces .",
    "an extended example concerning the situation of gabor frames is added . in subsection [ constr_frame_riesz ]",
    "we then show how to construct frames and riesz frames using a frame of subspaces .",
    "finally , section [ harmonic_fos ] deals with harmonic frames of subspaces .",
    "these are a generalization of harmonic frames , which distinguish themselves by having an easy construction formula . in both the finite and the infinite dimensional cases we give the definition of a harmonic frame of subspaces , state some results , and give examples , e.g. , subspaces coming from gabor systems and subspaces coming from multiresolution analysis , for their occurance .",
    "first we will briefly recall the definitions and basic properties of frames and bases . for more information we refer to the survey articles by casazza @xcite , the books by christensen @xcite , grchenig @xcite , and young @xcite and the research - tutorial by heil and walnut @xcite .",

    "moreover , we say that a frame @xmath11 is a _ riesz frame _ , if every subfamily of the sequence @xmath11 is a frame sequence with uniform frame bounds @xmath21 and @xmath22 .    as important example of frames are the so - called _ harmonic frames , _ which are uniform parseval frames of the form @xmath41 , where @xmath30 is a unitary operator on @xmath7 and @xmath42 , @xmath43 or @xmath44 . concerning a classification of harmonic frames we refer to the paper by casazza and kovaevi @xcite",
    ".    _ riesz bases _ are special cases of frames , and can be characterized as those frames which are biorthogonal to their dual frames .",
    "an equivalent definition is the following .",
    "a family @xmath11 is a riesz basis for @xmath17 , if there exist @xmath45 such that for all sequences of scalars @xmath46 , @xmath47 we define the _ riesz basis constants _ for @xmath11 to be the largest number @xmath21 and the smallest number @xmath22 such that this inequality holds for all sequences of scalars @xmath48 . if @xmath11 is a riesz basis only for its closed linear span , we call it a _ riesz basic sequence_.    an arbitrary sequence @xmath11 in @xmath17 is _ minimal _ , if @xmath49 for all @xmath10 , or equivalently if there exists a sequence @xmath40 , which is biorthogonal to @xmath11 .",
