    "the subject of metal - insulator transitions has been studied for decades .",
    "@xcite it is well understood that a metal - insulator transition is typically related to the breaking of a specific symmetry of the system , and carbon nanotubes are particularly interesting to study , due to their low dimensionality and special helical symmetry . in this paper",
    "we investigate the symmetry breaking in single - wall nanotubes ( swnts ) due to an external potential which depends on the angular coordinate along the swnt circumference .",
    "this perturbation may induce a transition in a swnt changing the type of its electronic structure by opening / closing the band gap in the metallic / semiconducting nanotube .",
    "@xcite it is important for applications in which such gap engineering can potentially be controlled locally , for instance by the field of a sharp tip , by a small molecule or by a local gate .",
    "swnt lattice symmetry depends on two parameters , diameter and chirality , which determine the type of band structure .",
    "@xcite about one - third of possible swnts are metallic , with one dimensional energy subbands crossing at the fermi level , as confirmed by experiments .",
    "@xcite in this study , we consider metallic nanotubes and focus mainly on the special case of armchair swnt ( a - swnt ) , which has a higher symmetry prohibiting an energy gap at the fermi level  @xcite for typical non - chiral perturbations such as stretching , uniform electric field , impurity potentials and many - body interactions .",
    "the same perturbations would open a small `` secondary '' band gap in metallic nanotubes of different symmetry .",
    "the high symmetry of a - swnts is also responsible for the absence of back scattering in the conduction channels .",
    "@xcite such ballistic transport is very attractive for future electronic applications  @xcite and a method to control the conductance of a - swnts would be particularly desirable .",
    "different perturbations have been attempted to modify the electronic structure of a - swnts .",
    "@xcite our goal is to demonstrate , using symmetry arguments , whether a particular perturbation can open a gap at all and how the gap depends on the magnitude of the perturbation potential",
    ". we will show below that , with minor exceptions , this can not be a linear dependence .",
    "we call this transition a `` metal - semiconductor transition '' ( mst ) since the gap size is smaller than in typical insulators",
    ".  @xcite    a nonorthogonal tight binding ( tb ) approach is used to model the swnt electronic structure . despite its simplicity",
    ", the tb approach may include as much important physics as more sophisticated models with the right choice of empirical parameters .",
    "@xcite in addition , it possesses a great advantage for analytical derivations . combining the tb approach and the summation of perturbation series with a group theory technique , it was shown in previous work  @xcite",
    "that mirror symmetry breaking is a necessary condition to mix the two crossing subbands ( @xmath0 and @xmath1 ) and open a band gap in a - swnts . here",
    ", we find several additional significant results : ( 1 ) due to the high lattice symmetry , the second order contributions _",
    "always _ cancel out and no second order gap opening occurs .",
    "one notes that the first order process is suppressed unless very specific selection rules are satisfied ( see below ) .",
    "( 2 ) under potentials of a single angular fourier component , @xmath2 , the lowest contributing coupling order between @xmath0 and @xmath1 bands , @xmath3 , is determined by the angular momentum of the potential , @xmath4 , and the index @xmath5 of the @xmath6 a - swnt as @xmath7 , in which @xmath8 is the greatest common divisor .",
    "the band gap opening is proportional to @xmath9 for small perturbation @xmath10 , where @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the nanotube fermi velocity and radius . in a typical experiment ,",
    "when the perturbation has a small angular momentum ( @xmath13 ) , the coupling order is high ( @xmath14 ) and the gap is small if any . to observe a linear effect ( @xmath15 ) , a high-@xmath4 potential must be applied ( @xmath16 ) .",
    "the high coupling order can be reduced by choosing combinations of several angular fourier components or different types of perturbation .",
    "( 3 ) additional symmetry of a particular model may lead to extra selection rules for the band gap opening .",
    "for example , gaping is forbidden for a - swnts with even @xmath5 if perfect electron - hole symmetry is assumed , as in an orthogonal basis .",
    "when the slight asymmetry between the conduction and valence bands is included , a gap proportional to the asymmetry parameter occurs .",
    "( 4 ) significant changes in the a - swnt density of states ( dos ) is observed even when the gap is absent .",
    "modification of the low energy band structure is mostly determined by the second order perturbation .",
    "the dos is enhanced near the fermi level and simultaneously @xmath11 decreases .",
    "peaks of the first pair of van hove singularities are brought closer , resulting in a smaller excitation energy between these subbands .",
    "our study is restricted to the case of potentials which are uniform along the tube axis , but certain results are easily generalized for perturbations with even / odd axial dependence .",
