    "the error is minimal at @xmath166 for @xmath167 , at @xmath168 for @xmath153 , and @xmath169 for @xmath170 .",
    "note that the shape of the curve flattens with increasing @xmath7 , so that the minimum is hard to find numerically .",
    "the intuitive explanation is that in the limit of large @xmath7 , as if alice were to transmit a  classical atom , \" _",
    "i.e. _ , a classical two body kepler system , then the direction of the classical angular momentum and lrl vectors could be found irrespective of the eccentricity .",
    "therefore , the transmission accuracy would be the same for any eccentricity that is not close to zero or one .",
    "the deviation of the optimum from @xmath171 was expected , since transmission of the @xmath73 direction ( @xmath121 ) achieved higher fidelity than the transmission of the @xmath74 direction ( @xmath122 ) .",
    "thus the ellipse with optimal eccentricity for transmission of two axes is biased to give @xmath172 in order to compensate the difference and make the contribution to the error from the @xmath73 direction about equal to that from the @xmath74 direction .",
    "elliptic states give results very close to the optimal ones . the mean square error for transmission of two axes by elliptic states with optimal eccentricity",
    "is compared to the optimal results @xcite in table iii .",
    "we now construct a povm based on the so(4 ) group and use it in order to transmit two axes .",
    "this povm is naturally built with the so(4 ) coherent states which are , as we have seen , direct products of two so(3 ) coherent states .",
    "we shall use for each one of the so(3 ) subspaces the notation    to be transmitted , and @xmath173 as in eq .",
    "( [ povm ] ) . by applying schur s lemma to each of the so(3 )",
    "subspaces we have de_1(_1_1_1)de_2(_2_2_2)=_1_2=.    we are now ready to discuss the transmission of alice s @xmath4 and @xmath5 axes by means of an elliptic state .",
    "we take |a = | =    define a fiducial vector for bob |b = ( 2j+1)| , [ bobso4 ] written in bob s notations .",
    "thus the povm element is constructed from the vector     the result of bob s measurement consists of two sets of euler angles , @xmath174 and @xmath175 .",
    "the first one gives bob s estimate of the active rotation needed to bring his @xmath4-axis to alice s @xmath4-axis .",
    "likewise , the second set gives bob s estimate of the active rotation needed to bring his @xmath5-axis to alice s @xmath5-axis .",
    "the detection probability of these sets of angles is dp(_1 ...",
    "_2)= d__1_1_1d__2_2_2 |a|u_1 u_2|b|^2 . [ prob2notation ] recall that eq .",
    "( [ aliceso4 ] ) was written in alice s notations , while ( [ bobso4 ] ) is in bob s notations . to compute the result explicitly , we need a uniform system of notations . for this",
    "we introduce , as in @xcite , the euler angles @xmath176 that rotate bob s @xmath177 axes into alice s axes .",
    "( the euler angle @xmath69 should not be confused with the eccentricity parameter introduced in sec .",
    "the unitary operator @xmath178 represents an active transformation of bob s state vectors to the corresponding state vectors of alice s system .",
    "therefore , @xmath179 is also the passive transformation from alice s notations to bob s notations . written in bob s notations , alice s vector @xmath180 becomes @xmath181 so that in eq .",
    "( [ prob2notation ] ) , @xmath182 becomes @xmath183 .",
    "owing to the commutation relations ( [ com1 ] ) and ( [ com2 ] ) u()&= & e^-il_ze^-il_ye^-il_z , + & = & u_1()u_2 ( ) , where again @xmath184 and @xmath124 are defined as in eq .",
    "( [ uj ] ) .",
    "we thus have u()|_1_2=u_1()|_1u_2()|_2 .",

    "as before , the euler angles @xmath185 have the effect of rotating bob s @xmath4-axis into his estimate of alice s @xmath4-axis and then rotating back the result by the true rotation from alice s to bob s frame .",
    "the action of the euler angles @xmath186 is similar for the @xmath5-axis .",

    "[ prob ] note the similarity with eq .",
    "( [ prob2notation ] ) .",
    "the difference is that ( [ prob2notation ] ) referred to the probability of _ detection _ of a particular set of euler angles , while ( [ prob ] ) gives the probability of _ error _ in that detection .",
    "the transmission mean square error _ per axis _ is , as in eq .",
    "( [ msecirc ] ) ,    r = ( 1-_x)+(1-_y ) , where @xmath188 and @xmath189 are the angles between the true and estimated directions of the @xmath4-axis and @xmath5-axis , respectively .",
    "since bob infers the direction of the @xmath4-axis from the angles @xmath174 , the value of @xmath190 depends only on @xmath191 .",
    "likewise , the value of @xmath192 depends only on the angles @xmath186 .",
    "we have _ x = d__1 _ 1 _ 1 | | u_1||^2_x , [ wxso4 ] where we have used ( [ prob ] ) and schur s lemma for the second set of angles , namely ( 2j+1)d__2 _ 2 _ 2 u_2||u_2^= _ 2 .",
    "the evaluation of eq .",
    "( [ wxso4 ] ) is identical to the one performed in eq .",
    "( [ wzcircular ] ) , with @xmath7 replaced by @xmath193 everywhere , and we get _ x = ( n-1)/(n+1 ) . likewise _",
    "y = ( n-1)/(n+1 ) .",
    "thus the infidelity ( mean square error ) per axis is ( 1-_x)+(1-_y ) = 1/(n+1 ) in ref .",
    "@xcite it was found that the _ optimal _ povm ( not restricted to elliptic states ) for transmission of two axes using a hydrogen atom is of the form given by eq .",
    "( [ povm ] ) .",
    "it was shown that using this povm , the infidelity per axis for alice s optimal signal approaches @xmath194 asymptotically . using so(4 ) instead of so(3 ) as in  @xcite , we obtain an infidelity per axis that is exactly @xmath195 for all values of  @xmath7 . as shown in the appendix , an adjustment procedure to obtain to orthogonal axes will further decrease the mean square error by a factor which for large values of @xmath7 tends to @xmath196 .",
    "the so(4 ) povm also enables the transmission of two directions which are not orthogonal , by means of a single hydrogen atom in an elliptic state . to transmit the directions of two general unit vectors",
    "@xmath197 and @xmath198 , alice s prepares the elliptic state |a = |_1_2 = |_1|_2 , ( in her notations ) while bob s vector is ( in his notations ) |b = ( 2j+1)|_1 .",
    "as before , the infidelity for each direction is @xmath195 .",
    "it should be noted that transmission of two non - orthogonal directions with one hydrogen atom is not possible with the so(3 ) povm .",
    "we have shown how elliptic rydberg states can transfer information on the orientation of one direction , or more generally that of a cartesian frame . for increasing values of @xmath7 , the fidelity obtained for a single direction falls rapidly below the optimal ones . however , for a cartesian frame the results are very close to the optimal ones .",
    "furthermore , elliptic states have the advantage of being experimentally accessible , while preparation of the optimal states seems much more difficult .",
    "note that we have assumed alice and bob have the same chirality .",
    "if their chiralities are opposite , then when angular momenta are used for the transmission , the direction inferred by bob should be reversed ( because directions are polar vectors while angular momentum is an axial vector ) .",
    "however , the lrl vector is also a polar vector , thus even if bob and alice have opposite chiralities , the direction inferred by bob is correct . we have also shown how elliptic rydberg states can be prepared to encode two arbitrary directions , when the measurement is based on the so(4 ) rotation group .",
    "work by ap was supported by the gerard swope fund and the fund for promotion of research .",
    "work by nhl was supported by a grant from the technion graduate school .",
    "as we have seen in sec .",
    "v , bob s estimates of alice s @xmath4 and @xmath5 axes may not be exactly orthogonal .",
    "the probability for the estimate of the @xmath4 axis to have an angular error @xmath188 , as can be seen from eq .",
    "( [ overlapj ] ) , is ( _ x)^2n-2(_x/2 ) , [ probomega ] and likewise for the @xmath5 axis .",
    "thus for large values of @xmath7 , the error probability distribution will be highly peaked .",
    "we now calculate the gain in fidelity achieved if bob performs a simple orthogonalization of his two estimates @xmath199 and @xmath200 , by rotating the two vectors in their plane by the same angle , so that they become orthogonal .",
    "let us define two pairs of spherical angles that give the position of the estimated directions with respect to the ( unknown ) true axes .",
    "these positions are given by _",
    "x=(_1_1 , _ 1_1 , _ 1 ) , [ r1 ] and _ y=(_2_2 , _ 2_2 , _ 2 ) .",
    "[ r2 ] the probability distributions will be denoted @xmath201 . in the limit of large @xmath7 , the deviation angles @xmath188 and @xmath189 are small .",
    "hence the distribution are centered as _",
    "x=(_1-,_1),_y=(_2-,_2- ) , where @xmath202 is peaked around @xmath203 . here",
    "we used the fact that the so(4 ) povm gives probabilities of error for each axis which are identical and independent .",
