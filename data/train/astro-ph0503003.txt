    "within the cold dark matter ( cdm ) paradigm for structure formation , first light in the universe is usually assumed to have come from stars which collapsed early at the centres of rare and unusually massive dark matter haloes associated with high peaks of the initial gaussian overdensity field .",
    "soon after their birth , these stars began to influence the structure , the thermodynamics and the chemical content of surrounding gas .",
    "the epoch when this occurred and the precise details of how it happened are not yet well understood .",
    "recent simulations including gravitational , chemical and radiative processes have suggested that metal - free gas in dark matter haloes of virial temperature @xmath14 and mass @xmath15 cooled efficiently by emission from molecular hydrogen and collapsed to form a star at redshifts @xmath16 .",
    "( abel et al . 1998 , 2002 ; fuller & couchman 2000 , bromm et al . 2002 ; yoshida et al .",
    "2003 ; for reviews see bromm & larson 2004 and glover 2004 ) . to achieve the required resolution ,",
    "these calculations followed evolution within very small cubic subvolumes of the universe assuming periodic boundary conditions .",
    "such boundary conditions suppress all fluctuations with wavelength longer than the side of the simulated region .",
    "as we shall see , this can have drastic effects , particularly on the morphology of large - scale structure and on the abundance and formation history of objects with mass more than roughly @xmath17 of the total mass in the simulated region .",
    "in fact , the first haloes of any given mass ( and thus quite probably the first stars ) do not form in `` typical '' regions at all , but rather in `` protocluster '' regions ( white & springel 2000 ; barkana & loeb 2004 ) .",
    "this is an effect of the relatively large contribution from mpc wavelengths to the fluctuation amplitude on even the smallest mass scales , and is reflected , for example , in the plots presented by mo & white ( 2002 ) for the spatial clustering strength of haloes for redshifts out to @xmath18 .",
    "conclusions about early objects reached from simulations of small and `` typical '' regions may thus be misleading ; in particular , the formation redshift of the first haloes of any given mass or temperature will be systematically underestimated .",
    "an alternative strategy is to simulate regions which are constrained to have high overdensity or to contain a high amplitude density peak ( abel et al .",
    "1998 , fuller &  couchman 2000 ; bromm et al . 2002 ) but this leads to interpretational difficulties because there is no clear relation between the statistical properties of the resulting objects and those of the rare objects of similar mass which would form from unconstrained initial conditions ( white 1996 ) .",
    "the formation of the first stars has also been studied by combining semi - analytical modelling of baryonic processes ( e.g. tegmark et al 1997 ; hutchings et al . 2002 ; yoshida et al . 2003 ) with press - schechter or extended press - schechter predictions of the number density of dark matter haloes ( press & schechter 1974 ; bond et al .",
    "1991 ; bower 1991 ; lacey & cole 1993 , 1994 ) . over the limited mass range that they test",
    ", recent n - body simulations have shown that the halo number density in the concordance cosmology is reasonably well matched by the sheth & tormen ( 1999 ) variant of the press - schechter model ( jenkins et al . 2001 ; reed et al . 2003 ; yahagi et al .",

    ", this work is still far from testing the regime that is relevant for studies of the first stars .    in this paper",
    ", we attempt to simulate an example of one of the first haloes capable of forming stars .",
    "anticipating that these will be progenitors of massive present - day objects , we perform a series of nested resimulations of the most massive progenitor of a rich cluster and its supercluster environment . in each resimulation",
    "we increase the resolution , we include additional small - scale structure in the initial conditions , and we start at higher redshift in order to capture the early phases of nonlinear evolution .",
    "as anticipated from the above discussion , we find that our simulated halo would likely form its first star at significantly higher redshifts than suggested by previous work . in this paper , however , we simulate only the formation and evolution of the dark halo itself .",
    "a more detailed consideration of baryonic processes is deferred to a companion paper ( reed et al .",
    "2005c ) and to later papers which include simulation of hydrodynamics and radiative cooling .",
    "our paper is structured as follows . in section  2 ,",
    "we describe our simulation sequence , the methods used to set up initial conditions , to integrate the equations of motion , and to identify haloes , and the evolution in mass and effective abundance of the dominant object . in section  3 , we present images of our main halo and its immediate surroundings at @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "we also present density profiles and an analysis of substructure for this halo at these same times , and we chart its remarkably rapid growth in virial temperature .",
    "internal structure is surprisingly similar at different times , whereas halo environment changes systematically and qualititively with increasing redshift . in section  4",
    "we extend our study of environment to larger scales , highlighting the qualitative difference in structure between early and late times . at redshift 50 the dark matter distribution in our simulation",
    "is very different from a scaled copy of that at @xmath21 . in this section",
    "we also compare the number density of haloes in our simulations with analytical models , showing that there is an extremely strong clustering bias which is quite well modelled by a suitable version of extended press - schechter theory . in section  5",
    ", we discuss the some possible implications of our calculations for the formation on the first stars .",
    "finally , we summarize our conclusions in section  6 .",
    "we adopt standard values for the cosmological parameters . for the mean densities of dark matter , dark energy and baryons ( in units of the critical density )",
    "we take @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 respectively .",
    "the present value of the hubble parameter is set to @xmath25 and the extrapolated linear amplitude of fluctuations in a sphere of radius @xmath26 is set to @xmath27 .",
    "we computed the initial linear power spectrum down to @xmath28 using cmbfast with a primordial spectral index @xmath29 ( seljak & zaldarriaga , 1996 ) .",
    "it was necessary to extrapolate a further order of magnitude in wavenumber to reach the nyquist frequency corresponding to our highest resolution resimulation .",
    "this was done using a power - law matched to the slope ( @xmath30 ) at the join .",
    "strictly speaking , there should be some curvature , but at these wavenumbers the slope is very close to its asymptotic value of  @xmath31 .      [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     it is a challenge to simulate the formation of early structure in a cdm universe because the first collapsed objects are very small .",
    "in addition , the slope of the matter power spectrum at high wavenumber approaches the critical value  @xmath31 for which equal contributions to the variance of the density field come from each logarithmic interval in wavenumber .",
    "thus a very wide range of scales must be included in order to simulate correctly the early formation of small objects .",
    "the required dynamic range is beyond present algorithms and computer resources by a wide margin so it is currently impossible to carry out simulations with sufficient resolution everwhere to follow the nonlinear dynamics of the first collapsing structures .",
    "we have devised a multigrid procedure which circumvents this problem and allows us to follow the growth of an object in its full cosmological context from @xmath32 to @xmath21 . over this period",
    "its mass increases by about 13 orders of magnitude .",
    "the procedure works as follows :    ( 1 ) : :    we identify a rich cluster halo at @xmath21 in a cosmological    simulation of a very large volume .",
    "( 2 ) : :    we resimulate the evolution of this rich cluster and its environment    with much higher mass and force resolution , while following the    remainder of the simulation volume at lower resolution than before .",
    "we    ensure the proper treatment of small - scale structure by starting the    resimulation at higher redshift than the original , and including in    its initial conditions a random realisation of the fluctuations at    wavenumbers between the nyquist frequencies of the original and the    higher resolution particle distributions .",
    "( 3 ) : :    we find the most massive object in the high resolution region of this    resimulation at each redshift and identify the time when it _ first _    contains more than about 10000 particles within its virial radius .",
    "( 4 ) : :    we then resimulate the evolution of this progenitor object and its    immediate surroundings with further improved mass and force    resolution , while again following the more distant matter distribution    at lower resolution .",
    "( 5 ) : :    we iterate steps  3 and  4 until we reach the desired redshift and    progenitor mass .    in practice , we chose at random a rich cluster of virial mass @xmath33 from the vls simulation of the virgo consortium , a cosmological simulation of a cubic region of side @xmath34mpc ( jenkins et al .",
    "2001 , yoshida et al .",
    "the first resimulation of this cluster involved a single application of the `` zoom '' technique first introduced by navarro & white ( 1994 ) in the implementation described and tested by power  et al .",
    "this was one of the cluster resimulations analyzed in navarro et al .",
    "( 2004 ) and gao et al .",
    "( 2004a , b , c ) . for the present paper we repeated this `` zoom '' step four more times reaching ever higher mass and force resolution .",
    "we thus have a total of 5 resimulations in addition to the original vls simulation .",
    "we label these r1 ( @xmath35 ) , r2 ( @xmath36 ) , r3(@xmath37 ) , r4 ( @xmath38 ) and r5 ( @xmath39 ) , where @xmath40 is both the final redshift of each resimulation and the redshift at which the most massive progenitor in the high - resolution region of the previous resimulation was identified .",
    "we checked the virial mass of the main object and the morphology of the surrounding structure between each pair of simulations at these times , finding excellent agreement in all cases . the first object to reach a mass greater than 10000 particles in the high - resolution region of r1 turned out not to be a progenitor of the main cluster itself , but rather of a smaller @xmath41 member of the same @xmath21 supercluster . at @xmath42 ,",
    "this object was @xmath43 per cent more massive than the most massive progenitor of the main cluster .",
    "the objects resimulated in r3 , r4 and r5 did , however , all turn out to be progenitors of this same object .",
    "the high resolution regions of the first three resimulations , r1r3 , had final radii about @xmath44 times the virial radius of the final massive object .",
    "for r4 and r5 we chose to follow a more extended region in order to investigate the large - scale environment of the principal halo .",
    "the first three resimulations used the original periodic boundaries of the parent vls simulation . for r4 and r5",
    "we used isolated boundary conditions with sharp spherical cuts at comoving radii of @xmath45mpc and @xmath46mpc respectively . at the relevant redshifts",
    "the universe is quite homogeneous on these scales , and our target objects were almost unaffected by the omission of more distant structure .",
    "note that this cut - off , unlike the imposition of periodic boundary conditions , does not exclude the contribution to the density field due to long wavelength modes , although it does significantly affect the bulk motion of the whole simulated region .",
    "this is of no consequence here .",
    "further details of our series of resimulations are listed in table 1 .",
    "here @xmath47 is the total number of particles in the high resolution region of each resimulation , @xmath48 is the mass of each of these particles , @xmath49 is the gravitational softening parameter ( in comoving units ) , @xmath50 is the mass of the final object within the sphere of radius @xmath51 ( also given in comoving units ) which encloses a mean overdensity of @xmath52 relative to critical , and @xmath53 and @xmath54 are the initial and final redshifts of each resimulation .",
    "in most of our resimulations the dominant halo at the final time has about 2 million particles inside @xmath51",
    ". only for r5 at @xmath12 was this number significantly lower , about @xmath55 million .",
    "for this highest resolution resimulation , the particle mass was @xmath56 and the force softening @xmath45pc in comoving units .",
    "the growth in mass of the principal object we have followed is shown in the first panel of figure  [ fig : fig1 ] .",
    "( as noted above , after @xmath57 this is not the most massive object in the high resolution region of r1 . )",
    "the rapidity with which the mass increases at early times is quite remarkable .",
    "picking a series of redshifts separated by factors of two in expansion factor , we find masses of @xmath58 at @xmath59 , of @xmath60 at @xmath61 , of @xmath62 at @xmath63 , of @xmath64 at @xmath65 , of @xmath66 at @xmath67 , of @xmath68 at @xmath69 , and of @xmath70 at @xmath21 .    for given halo mass and redshift , one can define a characteristic abundance as the mean number of haloes of equal or greater mass per unit volume in the universe as a whole .",
    "while our iterative procedure is guaranteed to find a rare , massive halo at high redshift , the corresponding abundance can not be estimated directly from our resimulations since these focus on `` special '' regions .",
    "it can not be much lower than the @xmath21 abundance of galaxy clusters like that initially selected , and in fact it turns out to be significantly higher .",
    "nevertheless , only an extremely small fraction of all cosmic mass is locked up in objects as massive as the one we are tracking .",
    "we illustrate these points in the lower two panels of figure  [ fig : fig1 ] using the sheth & tormen ( 1999 ) formulae to estimate abundance and mass fraction .",
    "note that these estimates require extrapolation far beyond the regime in which these formulae have been numerically tested ; while undoubtedly qualitatively correct , they may contain significant errors beyond @xmath71 . at @xmath72 the comoving abundance of objects like the one we have simulated",
    "is predicted to be similar to that of @xmath73 haloes today , but such objects contain only a few times @xmath74 of all cosmic matter , corresponding approximately to @xmath75 peaks of the initial gaussian density field .",
    "in contrast , the rich cluster we originally selected corresponds only to a @xmath76 peak , while the @xmath21 descendent of our high redshift halo corresponds to an even less rare @xmath77 peak .",
    "it is interesting that a large excursion is visible at @xmath78 in the plots of figure  [ fig : fig1 ] , which explains how the progenitor of the @xmath79 object managed to `` beat out '' that of the more massive @xmath21 cluster we had originally chosen .",
    "in addition , there is a clear change in behaviour in some of these plots after this redshift which is related to the fact that the object is no longer subject to the condition that it must evolve into an extreme system at later times ( see also figure  4 below ) .",
    "+    our r1 resimulation was carried out with the publicly available tree code gadget-1.1 ( springel , yoshida & white 2001 ) .",
    "our other resimulations used an improved tree - pm code gadget-2 ( springel 2005 ) .",
    "two of the most common methods for identifying haloes in @xmath2-body simulations are the friends - of - friends ( fof ) algorithm of davis et al .",
    "( 1985 ) , and the spherical overdensity ( so ) algorithm described by lacey & cole ( 1994 ) . advantages of fof are that it does not impose any fixed shape on the haloes , and that it is fast .",
    "however , it occasionally links separate haloes over a chance bridge of particles , and the most massive haloes in a large simulation are often such multiple objects . in the limit of large particle number , fof haloes",
    "are approximately bounded by an isodensity contour .    in the so algorithm ,",
    "the mass of a halo is evaluated in a spherical region .",
    "there is only one free parameter , the mean overdensity @xmath80 within this region .",
    "there are , however , many possible ways to determine its centre . for practical purposes , most of these are equivalent . in our implementation , the centre is determined iteratively .",
    "a local maximum of the density field , estimated by the standard sph method , is taken as an initial guess . a sphere",
    "is then grown outward until it reaches the desired mean overdensity .",
    "the centre - of - mass of this sphere is taken as the next guess at the centre and the procedure is repeated .",
    "after several iterations , the motion of the centre becomes small .",
    "the so algorithm rarely identifies haloes with multiple major concentrations , but it is slower than the fof algorithm and it does impose a fixed spherical shape when determining halo masses    as we shall see in later sections , the first massive objects are found in overdense regions containing many smaller haloes which line up along filaments and sheets . in this situation",
    "we find that the fof halo identification algorithm is quite dependent on the mass resolution of the simulation .",
    "for example , using a linking length of 0.2 times the mean interparticle separation ( at the cosmic mean density ) , the halo mass functions in corresponding regions at @xmath12 of the r4 and r5 resimulations are very different ; @xmath81 per cent of all high resolution particles are identified as a single halo in r5 , but the most massive halo is much smaller in r4 . on the other hand , as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2 ] , the abundance of haloes selected by so assuming @xmath82 ( again relative to the cosmic mean ) agrees well in the two resimulations down to the resolution limit of r4 . in",
    "the following we use the so(180 ) algorithm to identify all haloes , unless otherwise stated , although we often quote masses and radii as @xmath50 or @xmath51 referring to a spherical region with mean density 200 times the _ critical _ value .",
    "in this section we study the growth of the main halo in our simulation sequence and consider how its internal structure changes with time .",
    "we wish to test whether the halo and its environment at high redshift are similar to a suitably scaled version of low redshift structures .",
    "it has often been argued that dark matter evolution should be effectively self - similar in hierarchical clustering . this could only be strictly true in an einstein - de sitter universe with a power - law initial fluctuation spectrum ( e.g. efstathiou et al .",
    "1988 ; smith et al . 2003 ) .",
    "some deviations are expected in the concordance @xmath83cdm cosmology , both because of the influence of the cosmological constant at low redshift , and because of the curvature of the initial power spectrum .",
    "in addition , the fact that the power spectrum slope approaches the critical value @xmath31 at high wavenumber implies a breakdown at early times of the critical assumption underlying the hierarchical clustering model , namely that small things form first .",
    "our sequence of resimulations provides an opportunity to explore whether these effects lead to qualitatively different behaviour at early times .",
    "we begin by displaying images of the main halo and its immediate surroundings at the end of each of our resimulations .",
    "these are the times when the structure is best resolved .",
    "subsequent subsections consider the evolution in characteristic temperature , in density profile and in substructure content of the principal halo .",

    "[ fig : fig3 ] illustrates the larger scale environment of these main haloes .",
    "the images here have side @xmath89 , are projections of a region of depth @xmath90 , and again all represent the projected overdensity using an identical colour scale .",
    "the qualitative change in morphology with redshift is more dramatic in these plots .",
    "as we go back in time the main halo becomes less dominant and less regular , the `` filamentary '' structures become heavier and smoother , and substructure both within and outside the main object becomes less evident . at the earliest times , the filaments extend over the full region plotted and are the most striking structure within it . note that with the exception of the latest pair ( @xmath42 and @xmath21 ) all the matter shown in each early image is contained within the central object of the next later one .",

    ", it has reached @xmath11k when , for the high densities predicted at these redshifts , molecular hydrogen should form sufficiently rapidly to provide efficient radiative cooling . as many recent simulations have shown ,",

    "are centred on a rare and massive object .",
    "we therefore compare structure in the high - resolution region of r4 to structure surrounding our massive cluster in the vls simulation .",
    "it is unclear how the two models should be scaled to carry out this comparison , since , for any reasonable definition of the nonlinear mass scale , it is many orders of magnitude smaller at @xmath12 than at @xmath21 .",
    "we have chosen to scale , as in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3 ] , by the characteristic size @xmath51 of the central object .",
    "since our @xmath12 object is , in a dimensionless sense , much rarer than our @xmath21 object ( i.e. farther out on the tail of the mass distribution ; see the mass fraction plot of figure  [ fig : fig1 ] ) one might expect @xmath51 for the high - redshift object to be larger than that of an object which `` correctly '' corresponds to the @xmath21 halo . we would then underestimate the factor by which early large - scale structure should be magnified in order to correspond to @xmath21 structure .",
    "in fact , however , the opposite is true : even with the scaling we have chosen , large - scale structure is _ much _ more coherent at @xmath12 than at @xmath21 .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig8 ] , we compare large - scale structure at @xmath12 and @xmath21 after applying this scaling .",
    "the regions shown are @xmath113 on a side and are @xmath89 in depth .",
    "we have normalised by the projected mean cosmic density at each epoch and used the same logarithmic colour scale to display the two images .",
    "the qualitative and quantitative differences between the two plots are dramatic .",
    "the mean overdensity across the whole image at @xmath12 is clearly substantially higher than at @xmath21 , and in fact the mean density of the high resolution region of r4 at the redshift plotted is more than 2.5 times the global cosmic mean , even though the mass in this region is five orders of magnitude larger than that of the central halo .",
    "in addition , the large - scale structure at @xmath12 has a single dominant peak and extends more or less coherently across the whole region , while at @xmath21 there are many peaks of quite similar mass and morphology to the central one and typical filaments and voids are smaller than the region plotted .",
    "clearly it is dangerous to assume that large - scale structure in the early universe is just a scaled version of that familiar from simulations of low redshift structure formation .",
    "the regions followed by our resimulations are not typical regions of the universe , since , by construction , they are centred on a rare and massive object .",
    "indeed , all the material followed at high resolution in r@xmath114 falls onto this object during the evolution of r@xmath115 for @xmath116 and @xmath117 .",
    "it is this bias which is responsible , of course , for the substantial overdensity of the whole @xmath12 region plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig8 ] , and it results in accelerated growth of objects throughout the overdense region in comparison with `` typical '' regions of the universe . this may be quantified by comparing the mass function of haloes in the high resolution regions of our resimulations with that expected at the same redshift for the universe as a whole .",
    "[ fig : fig9 ] shows , as a function of mass , the abundance of objects identified by the so(180 ) algorithm in spherical regions centred on the most massive halo at two different redshifts .",

    "these formulae agree moderately well and the st prediction , in particular , is very close to the fitting function proposed by jenkins et al .",
    "( 2001 ) as a good representation of the best available simulation data . at @xmath12 , however , the two predictions disagree badly  by a factor of about 10 at @xmath123 and by a factor of about 100 at @xmath124 . in this regime",
    "there are no reliable simulations with which they can be compared , so it is unclear which ( if either ) is most correct . for the largest high - resolution simulation of a `` typical '' region carried out so far , the so - called millennium run ,",
    "the st formulae continue to fit the high mass tail of the concordance @xmath83cdm mass function out to @xmath125 where the ps formulae already underpredict by about an order of magnitude ( springel et al . 2005 ) . nevertheless , these results are still a factor of 5 in redshift and @xmath126 in mass from the regime of concern here .",
    "both the ps and the st formula fit the @xmath21 data well for spheres of radius @xmath118 and @xmath127 and the simulation results in the two cases are indistinguishable . for the sphere of radius @xmath128 , the simulation results are similar at small mass but appear high at the large mass end . within the two larger spheres the mean overdensity is close to zero , so no substantial bias is expected theoretically .",
    "the situation is dramatically different at redshift @xmath12 .",
    "even though the st prediction is much larger than that from ps theory , it still lies far below any of the mass functions measured from the simulation .",
    "in addition , the three spheres produce mass functions which differ considerably , with the smallest sphere having the largest abundances .",
    "as noted above , the overdensities within these spheres are substantial , and as we now show , their mass functions can be predicted surprisingly well by inserting these overdensities into a suitable version of the conditional or extended press - schechter model ( eps ; bond et al .",

    "to evaluate @xmath130 , we must relate the nonlinear overdensity @xmath80 measured at redshift @xmath131 in eulerian space to the original linear overdensity in lagrangian space .",
    "based upon the spherical collapse model , mo & white(1996 ) provided an analytical fitting formula which links these two overdensities in an einstein - de sitter universe .",
    "sheth & tormen ( 2002 ) later showed that this formula remains reasonably accurate for all cosmologies of interest .",

    "for r4 at @xmath12 we find @xmath139 and @xmath140 for spheres of radius @xmath141 , @xmath127 and @xmath128 respectively .",
    "for the vls simulation at @xmath21 the corresponding numbers are -0.02 , 0.17 and 0.49 .",
    "these numbers can be converted to linear overdensities using equations ( [ nonden ] ) , while the radii of the spheres can be converted to lagrangian radii simply by multiplying by @xmath142 .",
    "equations ( [ eps ] ) then predict the halo abundance in these regions .",
    "we plot the results as thick solid lines in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : fig9 ] .",
    "( we do not show these curves at @xmath21 since they differ little from the standard ps prediction . ) clearly , the agreement with the measured abundances is very good .",
    "[ fig : fig10 ] shows that the eps model works equally well at @xmath143 .",
    "for this plot we consider the halo abundance in a spherical region of radius @xmath128 , the largest sphere that fits completely within the high resolution region of r3 at this redshift . as noted above , tests of the standard ps formula show increasingly poor fits to the high mass tail of the global mass function at high redshift ( and , in particular , much worse fits than the st formula ) , so it is remarkable that the eps mass function gives a such an accurate estimate of halo abundance in high density regions at these early times .",
    "the redshift and mass ranges tested here , @xmath144 and @xmath145 , are those most relevant for the collapse of the haloes which host the first stars .",
    "the eps formalism may also be used to calculate the growth history of a given halo . at given ( high )",
    "redshift , we estimate the expected mass of the most massive progenitor of the final halo by integrating the eps progenitor mass function down from infinity until the expected total number of progenitors is equal to @xmath146 .",
    "we then adopt the mean progenitor mass over this range as our estimate for the largest progenitor mass . the thick line in the upper panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] shows the resulting prediction for the growth in mass of the dominant halo in our resimulation series .",
    "( recall that the final object is not the most massive halo at @xmath21 in r1 but rather a nearby halo of mass @xmath147 . )",
    "remarkably , the theoretical prediction follows our simulation results very closely , with at most a @xmath148 per cent shift in redshift at early times . we believe this close agreement to be at least partly fortuitous , since we have also resimulated the most massive @xmath42 progenitor of the rich cluster halo we originally picked from the vls simulation .",
    "although at @xmath42 it is only 15% less massive than the object we have concentrated on in this paper ( and at @xmath21 is a factor @xmath149 _ more _ massive ) , by @xmath108 , the earliest time for which we currently have a reliable mass estimate , it is less massive than our principal object by a factor of @xmath148 . clearly , there is substantial scatter in growth histories of the kind we are studying .",
    "in the context of the @xmath83cdm cosmogony , understanding the formation and evolution of early dark haloes is a prerequisite for understanding the formation of the first stars .",
    "although first star formation depends strongly on additional hydrodynamic and radiative processes , dark halo collapse provides the dynamical context for these processes , and so can serve as a useful guide to when and where the first stars may form .",
    "we already saw in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : fig4 ] that a halo of virial temperature @xmath11k is in place in our simulation series by @xmath12 .",
    "these are the properties usually suggested as appropriate for the condensation of the first stellar generation through molecular hydrogen cooling .",
    "by @xmath100 the biggest halo has high enough temperature for efficient cooling by atomic processes .",
    "we now briefly consider the implied abundance and clustering of such objects .",
    "a more detailed discussion is given in our companion paper ( reed et al .",
    "2005c ) .",
    "the lower right - hand panel of figure  [ fig : fig1 ] shows the st formulae to predict that at @xmath12 the mean abundance of objects at least as massive as our dominant halo is @xmath150mpc@xmath151 , while at @xmath100 it is @xmath152mpc@xmath151 .",
    "these numbers correspond roughly to the present - day abundance of @xmath153 and @xmath154 haloes respectively .",
    "the lower left - hand panel of figure  [ fig : fig1 ] demonstrates that only a tiny fraction of all mass is in such haloes , about @xmath155 at @xmath12 and about @xmath156 at @xmath100 .",
    "since the masses of the first stars are expected to be a few hundred m@xmath157 , the fraction of all baryons in stars at @xmath12 is predicted to be around @xmath158 .",
    "this is far too low for their uv flux to reionise a significant fraction of the igm .",
    "these early objects would thus create isolated hii regions with a very small filling factor .",
    "atomic cooling might allow more efficient condensation of the baryons into stars in the @xmath100 objects , but even then the abundance is too low for the hii regions to percolate .",
    "in addition , activity related to a central star formed at @xmath9 might eject the baryons from these objects before their virial temperature reaches the critical value for atomic cooling .",
    "closely related to the fact that the main progenitors of high - mass objects accrete matter very rapidly at high redshift is the fact that the abundance of objects above a given ( high ) mass or temperature threshold increases very rapidly with time .",
    "thus while the st prediction for the mass fraction in objects with virial temperature above 2000k is @xmath155 at @xmath12 , it has already increased to @xmath159 by @xmath100 with a corresponding abundance of @xmath160mpc@xmath151 , well above that of dwarf galaxies today .",
    "note that these strong dependences are also reflected in considerable sensitivity of these st predictions to the particular form used for the @xmath83cdm power spectrum . here , as in our simulations , we have used the spectrum given by cmbfast ( seljak & zaldarriaga 1996 ) . in the regime",
    "we are considering , switching to the analytical fits quoted by bond & efstathiou ( 1987 ) or bardeen et al .",
    "( 1986 ) alters the abundance at fixed halo mass and redshift by up to an order of magnitude , and the redshift at fixed halo mass and abundance by up to @xmath161 .",
    "+    a final point of interest for the first stars is the spatial clustering of their potential host haloes .",
    "this has a direct impact on the likelihood that a star or star cluster can affect star formation in neighbouring haloes .",
    "it also has consequences for the morphology of the igm during its reionisation and so for the form of the predicted signal in future redshifted 21 cm surveys ( e.g. ciardi & madau 2003 ) .",
    "the halo autocorrelation function is easily estimated using the formalism proposed by mo & white ( 1996 ) which is based upon the eps and top - hat collapse models and was tested by them against direct n - body simulations .",
    "the halo auto - correlation function , @xmath162 , is given by    @xmath163    where @xmath164 is the bias factor for haloes of mass @xmath165 at redshift @xmath131 ( cole &  kaiser 1989 ; mo &  white 1996 , 2002 ; jing 1998 ) , and @xmath166 is the _ non_linear auto - correlation function of the underlying mass , estimated to sufficient accuracy from the linear power spectrum by the procedure of peacock & dodds ( 1996 ) .",
    "equation [ xibias ] is only valid on scales significantly larger than the size of the haloes , and , like the ps and st formulae , it has not been tested numerically in the regime where we use it here . in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig11 ] , we compare the correlation functions for 2000k haloes at @xmath12 and for 10000k haloes at @xmath100 with those for haloes with a variety of masses today .",
    "( note that lengths in this plot are in comoving units . )",
    "the halo correlation amplitudes at these early times are several hundred times that of the underlying mass . on scales of a few mpc",
    "they are comparable to that of @xmath167 dark haloes today .",
    "the correlation length ( defined by @xmath168 ) is @xmath169mpc for our @xmath12 haloes and is @xmath170mpc for the @xmath100 haloes .",
    "thus on mpc scales , the comoving clustering pattern of the first stars and galaxies may be quite similar to that of dwarf galaxies today .",
    "we have invented a novel strategy which allows us to follow the build - up of a massive object within the concordance @xmath83cdm cosmogony over an unprecedentedly large range in redshift and mass . in the particular resimulation series presented in this paper",
    "we track the growth of one particular object from a mass of about @xmath171 at @xmath32 to about @xmath172 at the present day . throughout the series the full cosmological environment of the object",
    "is correctly represented so we can study evolution both of its internal structure and of the `` large - scale '' structure in which it is embedded . as a by - product we are able to estimate approximately when the baryons associated with this particular object would first have been able to collapse to form a star .",
    "our main results may be summarized as follows :    ( 1 ) : :    massive objects at early times accrete mass extremely rapidly and form    in regions where the overdensity is high on much larger scales than    those of the objects themselves .",
    "( 2 ) : :    at early times ( @xmath173 ) the filamentary structure    surrounding the massive objects is much stronger than at lower    redshifts ( @xmath174 ) . ( 3 ) : :    at very high redshift ( @xmath72 ) large - scale structure    is qualitatively different from that in the low redshift universe .",
    "in    particular the characteristic size of coherent structures is much    larger in relation to the typical size of collapsed objects .",
    "( 4 ) : :    despite this , the internal structure of massive early dark haloes is    quite similar to that to their present - day counterparts , both in terms    of density profiles and in terms of substructure .",
    "although early    objects are less concentrated and have less substructure , the    differences are relatively small .",
    "( 5 ) : :    the number density of haloes in overdense regions at high redshift is    surprisingly well described by the extended press - schechter model , at    least in the redshift interval @xmath175 that we study here . ( 6 ) : :    by @xmath12 our main object has reached virial temperature    @xmath176k and should soon form sufficient molecular hydrogen    for gas to condense into a central massive star .",
    "pockets of star    formation may thus have appeared much earlier than previously thought .    at @xmath12",
    "such 2000k haloes have a comoving number density    comparable to that of @xmath177    haloes today , but by @xmath178 this has already increased by    almost two orders of magnitude . by @xmath100",
    "our main halo    has a virial temperature of 10000k so its gas can start cooling by    atomic processes and turning , perhaps , much more efficiently into    stars .",
    "( 7 ) : :    over the redshift range @xmath179 haloes like the one we    have simulated have comoving correlation lengths up to    @xmath180mpc , similar to those of present - day dwarf    galaxies .",
    "the ionisation and dissociation structures their associated    stars produce is studied in our companion paper ( reed et al .",
    "2005c ) .    by clarifying how the dark matter distribution evolves in and around extreme objects , our simulations set the scene for the more complex processes of gas cooling , collapse and fragmentation that result in the first stars .",
    "we will study these processes in forthcoming papers using direct simulation of the baryonic component .",
