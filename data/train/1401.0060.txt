    "guth @xcite proved existence of a map from @xmath0 into a trivalent tree with lengths of fibers bounded in terms of hypersphericity of @xmath0 .",
    "it follows from theorem 0.3 in @xcite that there exists such a map with fibers of length @xmath23 .",
    "the second main result of this paper is about slicing @xmath0 by @xmath24cycles .",
    "if instead of simple closed curves we allow subdividison by 1-cycles , we show that @xmath0 can be subdivided into two regions with arbitrary prescribed ratio of areas by a 1-cycle of length @xmath25 .",
    "in fact , we prove the following    [ morse ] there exists a morse function @xmath2 with fibers of length @xmath25 .",

    "alvarez paiva , balacheff and tzanev @xcite show that existence of a morse function on a riemannian 2-sphere with bounded fibers yields a length - area inequality for the shortest periodic geodesic on a finsler 2-sphere ( for both reversible and non - reversible metrics ) .",
    "note that arguments used by croke @xcite to prove the length - area bound for the shortest closed geodesic on a riemannian 2-sphere ( see also @xcite for the best known constant ) can not be directly generalized to the finsler case because co - area inequality fails for non - reversible finsler metrics .",

    "the area of the region reduces at least by a factor of @xmath33 .",
    "we then assemble these subdividing curves into one foliation with lengths bounded by the geometric progression @xmath34 in the proof of theorem [ morse ] some subdividng curves are used twice so an additional factor of @xmath35 appears .",
    "after the first subdivision happens our regions are no longer spheres , but rather spheres with a finite number of holes",
    ". it may not be possible to find a short simple closed curve subdividing it into two parts of area @xmath36 of its area .",
    "instead we may have to use a collection of arcs with endpoints on the boundary subdividng the region into many pieces , each of small area .",
    "the issue is then how to assemble all of these subdividing curves into one foliation .",
    "the main technical result of this paper ( proved in the next section , see proposition [ subdivision ] ) is that we can always choose these subdividing arcs in such a way that they belong to a single connected component of the boundary of a certain subregion @xmath37 with area of @xmath37 between @xmath38 and @xmath33 of the area of the region .",
