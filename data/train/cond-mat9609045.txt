    "the influence of disorder on the abrikosov vortex lattice in the mixed phase of high - temperature superconductors , such as @xmath1 ( ybco ) , is an issue of immediate technological interest because pinning of the flux lines by disorder opens the possibility of regaining a dissipation - free current flow in the mixed phase .",
    "the flux line ( fl ) array in a high - temperature superconductor ( htsc ) is extremely susceptible to thermal and disorder - induced fluctuations due to the interplay of several parameters , namely the high transition temperature @xmath2 , large magnetic penetration depths @xmath3 and short coherence lengths @xmath4 , and a strong anisotropy of the material .",
    "this leads to the existence of a variety of fluctuation dominated phases of the fl array and very rich phase diagrams for the htsc materials  @xcite .",
    "we want to consider here the pinning of fls by point defects such as the oxygen vacancies , which is usually referred to as point disorder .",
    "it is well - known that the fl lattice is unstable to point disorder  @xcite .",
    "it has been conjectured that due to a _ collective pinning _ by the point disorder , the fl array may form a _ vortex glass phase _ with zero linear resistivity  @xcite .",
    "although the existence of a vortex glass ( vg ) phase has been verified experimentally  @xcite , its large scale properties characterizing the nature of the vg phase are still under debate  @xcite .",
    "a possible scenario for a description of the low - temperature properties of the fl array subject to point disorder is the existence of a topologically ordered , i.e. , _ dislocation - free _ vg phase , the so - called _ bragg glass _ phase  @xcite as a thermodynamically stable phase . in this glassy phase , a quasi long range positional order of the fl array",
    "is maintained in spite of the pinning  @xcite .",
    "this entails the existence of algebraically decaying bragg peaks in diffraction experiments on this phase ( bearing the name `` bragg glass '' for this property ) , which have indeed been observed in neutron diffraction experiments on @xmath5 ( bscco ) at low magnetic fields  @xcite . in the bragg glass phase ,",
    "the disordered fl array is modeled as an elastic manifold in a periodic random potential , similar to a randomly pinned charge density wave or a xy model in a random field  @xcite . to give a thermodynamically stable phase , this requires the persistence of the topological order , or absence of unbound dislocations , even in the presence of disorder . in the neutron diffraction experiments by cubitt et al .",
    "@xcite , it has been observed that upon increasing the magnetic field , the bragg peaks vanish , indicating an instability of the bragg glass phase .",
    "critical current measurements of khaykovich et al .",
    "@xcite show a sharp drop in the ( local ) critical current @xmath6 upon decreasing the magnetic induction below a critical value .",
    "this can be attributed to the `` disentanglement '' of fls in the absence of dislocations when topological order is regained and dislocation loops vanish upon lowering the magnetic field .",
    "similarly , changes in the i - v characteristics of ybco based superlattices below a critical magnetic field can be interpreted as stemming from a sharp drop of the pinning energy and indicate a restoration of positional order in the vg  @xcite .",
    "the existence of a topological transition has also been demonstrated in recent numerical studies  @xcite . in the closely related 3d xy model in a random field ,",
    "vortex loops occur in a topological phase transition at a critical strength of the random field  @xcite . in simulations of disordered fl arrays",
    "@xcite , a proliferation of dislocation lines has been found at a critical magnetic field in good agreement with the experimental results in ref .",

    "recently , the quantitative aspects of this issue have been addressed also analytically  @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite a self - consistent variational calculation and a scaling argument are presented , which show the topological stability of the elastic bragg glass phase over a finite range of parameters that can be estimated by a lindemann - like criterion ( [ cond ] ) . a more detailed discussion of the methods used in ref .",
    "@xcite and their limitations as well as of the lindemann - like criterion ( [ cond ] ) , which provides the basis for the calculations in the present work , will be given in the next paragraph .",
    "recently , fisher  @xcite has presented refined scaling arguments further supporting the existence of a topologically ordered bragg glass phase . in refs .",
    "@xcite , purely phenomenological lindemann criteria are used as starting point for an estimate of the phase boundaries of the bragg glass .",
    "erta and nelson  @xcite and goldschmidt  @xcite use `` cage models '' to mimic the interactions between fls which yields an effective theory for a single fl in a random potential , to which they apply the conventional phenomenological lindemann criterion . giamarchi and le doussal  @xcite",

    "however , it is well known that phenomenological lindemann criteria as used in refs .",
    "@xcite do not allow a theoretical description of a phase transition but can only give estimates of the location of the transition .",

    "@xcite represent a further step towards this goal .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , the stability of the elastic bragg glass phase has been investigated for a layered uniaxial geometry , where the magnetic field is parallel to the cuo - planes , by means of a self - consistent variational calculation and a scaling argument identifying the shear instability due to proliferating dislocations by the disorder - induced decoupling of the layers . for this geometry",
    "a lindemann - like criterion has been derived , which is given below in ( [ cond ] ) and relates the stability of the bragg glass phase to the ratio of the positional correlation length and the fl spacing .",
    "these findings are supported by a more rigorous rg analysis @xcite for a simplified model with only two layers of fls in a parallel magnetic field .",
    "the usual experimental situation with the magnetic field perpendicular to the cuo - layers , which will be considered in the present work , is theoretically less understood mainly because displacements of the fls have two components ( biaxial ) instead of one component ( uniaxial ) .",
    "it is unclear at present whether topological phase transitions of the biaxial and uniaxial model share the same universality class @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , it has been argued that the scaling argument for the uniaxial geometry can be generalized to the full , biaxial model leading to the following criterion estimating the range of stability of the bragg glass phase with respect to a spontaneous formation of dislocation loops : @xmath11 @xmath9 is the fl distance and @xmath3 the magnetic penetration depth ( we consider a magnetic field perpendicular to the cuo - planes of the htsc , and will specify @xmath3 below for such a geometry ) .",

    "first , we will review the pre - asymptotic regimes of the fl array subject to point disorder on scales smaller than the positional correlation length @xmath16 .",
    "this allows us to express @xmath12 in terms of the microscopic parameters of the htsc and the disorder strength , and to obtain its dependence on magnetic induction @xmath17 and temperature @xmath18 . in the second part",
    ", we will demonstrate the equivalence of the above criterion ( [ cond ] ) to the phenomenological lindemann criterion in the form @xmath7 ( as for example used in refs .",
    "@xcite ) , where @xmath8 is the ( disorder - averaged ) _ relative _ mean square displacement of neighboured fls .",
    "this yields a relation @xmath19 between @xmath13 from ( [ cond ] ) and the lindemann - number @xmath10 , and the value @xmath14 found by a variational calculation in ref .",
    "@xcite turns out to be in good agreement with a value @xmath20 widely used in the literature for the lindemann - number .",
    "this equivalence further supports a scenario where the topological transition of the fl array subject to point disorder may be described as disorder - induced melting by unbound dislocations on the shortest scale @xmath9  @xcite .",
    "finally , and most importantly from the experimental point of view , we estimate the region of the phase diagram of ybco in the b - t plane ( see fig .",
    "1 ) where the bragg glass phase is stable and should be observable experimentally or numerically according to the lindemann - like criterion ( [ cond ] ) .",
    "we find qualitative agreement with experiments  @xcite .",
    "the upper phase boundary of the bragg glass , which we obtain using ( [ cond ] ) , turns out to be identical to the one obtained by erta and nelson  @xcite .",
    "to relate the positional correlation length @xmath16 to the microscopic parameters of the htsc and the disorder strength , we have to review the crossover between the different pre - asymptotic regimes of the dislocation - free disordered fl array preceding the asymptotic bragg glass phase , and the associated crossover length scales  @xcite .",
    "these crossovers are induced by the interplay between the fl interaction , the periodicity of the fl lattice and the disorder potential , which are in addition affected by thermal fluctuations , and lead to essentially two different pre - asymptotic regimes : on the shortest scales , we have the `` larkin '' or `` random force '' regime of larkin and ovchinnikov  @xcite , which crosses over to the so - called `` random manifold '' regime at the larkin length , before the asymptotic bragg glass behaviour sets in on the largest scales exceeding the positional correlation length . in between this sequence of crossovers ,",
    "one additional length scale is set by the fl interaction , which describes a crossover from a `` single vortex '' behaviour to a `` collective '' behaviour .    in the following , we consider the usual experimental situation @xmath21 of a magnetic field perpendicular to the cuo - planes of the htsc .",

    "let us adopt the convention to denote scales longitudinal to the fls in the z - direction by @xmath28 and transversal scales in the @xmath24-plane by @xmath29 .",
    "moreover , it turns out to be convenient to use the _ reduced induction _ @xmath30 to measure the strength of the magnetic field .",

    "there , it is formulated in its conventional form @xmath198 with a lindemann - number @xmath199 . for the thermal melting of the fl array ,",
    "the main contributions to the left hand side of ( [ lindemann ] ) come from fluctuations on the _ shortest _ scale , which is in the transverse direction the fl spacing @xmath9 , i.e. , @xmath200 ( note that we apply again a convention like ( [ conv ] ) ) .",
    "therefore , the straightforward generalization of ( [ lindemann ] ) to the disorder - induced melting by dislocations is @xmath201 where we consider again fluctuations on the shortest scale @xmath54 . in ref .",
    "@xcite , one derivation of the criterion ( [ cond ] ) was based on a variational calculation for a layered superconductor in a parallel field .",
    "there it was found , that unbound dislocations proliferate indeed on the shortest scale at the topological transition described by ( [ cond ] ) , i.e. , in between every layer and thus with a distance @xmath9 .",
    "this suggests that the use of the conventional phenomenological lindemann criterion in the form ( [ linde ] ) might be one possibility to obtain the topological transition line .",
    "this can be further justified by showing that the criterion ( [ cond ] ) , obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite on the basis of a scaling argument and a variational calculation for a uniaxial model , is actually _ equivalent _ to the phenomenological lindemann criterion ( [ linde ] ) : considering the relation ( [ lrl ] ) between @xmath202 and @xmath9 , it becomes clear that ( [ cond ] ) is the analog of the lindemann criterion ( [ linde ] ) formulated in terms of the underlying transversal scales rather than the corresponding displacements . using ( [ lrl ] ) , the criterion ( [ cond ] ) for the stability of the bragg glass can be written as @xmath203 this is just the above phenomenological lindemann criterion ( [ linde ] ) , and we can identify @xmath204 we see that the equivalence of the criterion ( [ cond ] ) to the phenomenological lindemann criterion ( [ linde ] ) includes the agreement of the appearing numerical factors : the value for the lindemann - number @xmath20 , widely used in the literature , produces a good agreement in ( [ ccl ] ) with the value @xmath14 obtained by the variational calculation .",
    "this equivalence to a scenario where disorder - induced fluctuations on the shortest scale `` melt '' the fl array favours a first order transition scenario for the topological transition , which could not be excluded in the experiments  @xcite . as we will see , the quantity @xmath205 is equivalent to the mean square displacement of the `` effective '' fl studied in the `` cage model '' of erta and nelson  @xcite .",
    "they apply the lindemann criterion directly in its phenomenological form ( [ linde ] ) to the `` caged '' fl . using ( [ ccl],[zeta ] ) , we can cast the lindemann - like criterion ( [ cond ] ) into the form @xmath206",

    "the boundary of the regime given by ( [ cond2 ] ) defines a _ topological transition line _ @xmath207 , where dislocations proliferate and the topological order of the bragg glass phase is lost .",
    "the upper branch @xmath83 of this line can be obtained by applying the expressions ( [ rl2lxi > d ] ) or ( [ rl2lxi < d ] ) for the positional correlation length @xmath16 in the dense limit @xmath208 to the criterion ( [ cond2 ] ) .    for weak pinning or @xmath174 such that we have collective pinning on the scale @xmath113 , this yields a condition @xmath209 in the b - t plane with @xmath210 note that the transition line ( [ buptlxi > d ] ) is identical to the one obtained by erta and nelson  @xcite by applying the conventional phenomenological lindemann criterion to a `` cage model '' for a single fl ( this demonstrates the equivalence of the displacement @xmath202 as defined in ( [ linde ] ) to the average displacement of",

    ", the fl array melts into a disordered fl liquid , and the bragg glass order is destroyed by the thermal fluctuations on small scales where disorder - induced fluctuations are irrelevant , whereas above the transition line @xmath83 the bragg glass `` melts '' by disorder - induced fluctuations , when unbound dislocation loops proliferate . for @xmath234 , we find @xmath235 , and the melting curve @xmath226 lies _ above _ the topological transition line in the b - t plane .",

    "@xcite , such a change in the properties of the melting transition has indeed been observed in ybco at a temperature around @xmath236 which is in fairly good agreement with our result for @xmath224 .",
    "let us now give the main results for the lower branch of the topological transition line @xmath237 at which the strongly dispersive contribution from the electromagnetic coupling to the single vortex tilt modulus is dominating . at low inductions in the dilute limit @xmath238",
