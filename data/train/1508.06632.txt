    "kagom - lattice antifferomagnets are iconic in the field of frustrated magnets , comprising a number of model systems whose classical ground states are massively degenerate , giving rise to an extreme sensitivity to subtle symmetry breaking effects,@xcite to fractional magnetization plateaus , @xcite to a strongly amplified role of secondary interactions,@xcite and to an emergent hierarchy of energy scales in their dynamics.@xcite a crucial role of the non - linear , anharmonic terms in the so - called order - by - disorder ground - state selection by thermal@xcite or quantum fluctuations@xcite in the kagom - lattice antifferomagnets has been recognized for some time .",
    "recently , an accurate , systematic treatment of the quantum order - by - disorder effect in the anisotropic versions of the model has received a significant development.@xcite however , much less is known about the role of such terms in the excitation spectra of frustrated magnets and only recently a rather dramatic picture has begun to emerge .",
    "@xcite    usually , the nonlinear terms in antiferromagnets are necessary to describe interactions of magnons and , while their role is , generally , more significant when frustration is present,@xcite they still lead to effects that are relatively minor in the large-@xmath4 limit , i.e. , constitute a @xmath5 contribution compared with the classical energy scale @xmath6 . however , in a wide class of highly - frustrated systems , including the kagom - lattice antiferromagnets , the non - linear anharmonic terms are responsible for the phenomena that are much more dramatic .    first effect concerns systems in which contenders for the ground state form a highly degenerate , extensive manifold of states , and neither the classical energetics nor the harmonic fluctuations are able to select a unique ground state from that manifold.@xcite in that case , the selection role is passed onto the nonlinear terms providing a variant of the quantum order by disorder effect .",
    "such is the case of the three models considered in this work , heisenberg , @xmath0,@xcite and single - ion anisotropy models , while in the case of the dzyaloshinskii - moriya ( dm ) anisotropy , a unique state is selected already on the classical level.@xcite    the second effect is less - studied , but is equally striking .",
    "we demonstrate , that the nonlinear terms lead to spectacularly strong quantum effects in the dynamical response of the flat - band frustrated magnets , even in the ones that are assumed nearly classical.@xcite the resultant spectral features invoke parallels with the quasiparticle breakdown signatures in quantum spin- and bose - liquids,@xcite which exhibit termination points and broad continua where single - particle excitations are no longer well - defined . in the present case , the origin of such features is in the near - resonant decay into pairs of the flat modes , facilitated by the nonlinear couplings .",
    "the effect is strongly amplified by the density of states of the flat modes and can be shown to persist even in the large-@xmath4 limit , defying the usual @xmath5 suppression trend and challenging a conventional wisdom that such drastic phenomena can only occur in an inherently quantum system . in the present study , we expand the analysis of our previous works@xcite and offer an expos of the @xmath5 formalism for several common anisotropic extensions of the nearest - neighbor heisenberg model on the kagom lattice that are also relevant to real materials .",
    "the presented approach to the nonlinear spin - wave theory can be applicable to the other , more complicated forms of the kagom - lattice hamiltonians as well as to a broader class of frustrated spin systems on the non - bravais lattices .",
    "we also provide a useful extension of our approach to the perturbative treatment of small perturbations to the main hamiltonian , such as the next - nearest superexchanges @xmath7 .    for the ground - state consideration ,",
    "we demonstrate a quantum phase transition between the @xmath1 and the @xmath2 states as a function of anisotropy parameter in two models : @xmath0 model , studied previously,@xcite and the single - ion anisotropy model .",
    "while the effect is similar in both models , the energy scale associated with it is shown to be different , in agreement with the understanding that the degeneracy - lifting interaction is associated with a high - order topologically - nontrivial spin - flip processes , which are different in the two models . nevertheless , both model cases present a rare example of the ground - state selection that is different from the choice of the thermal fluctuations , which favor the @xmath2 structure for any value of the anisotropy parameter .",
    "@xcite    for the spectral properties of the kagom - lattice antiferromagnets , we offer a detailed consideration of the decay - induced effects in the dm anisotropy model with @xmath7 , the model that closely describes the @xmath3 fe - jarosite.@xcite we also present a general analysis of the near - resonant decays in the flat - band frustrated antiferromagnets , which suggests that the dramatic modifications in the spectrum due to this phenomenon must persist in the large-@xmath4 limit . while the core of our presentation is aimed at a common and realistic extension of the nearest - neighbor heisenberg kagom - lattice antiferromagnet , we argue that the spectacularly strong quantum effect of the quasiparticle breakdown in an almost classical system should be applicable to a variety of other flat - band frustrated spin systems .",
    "@xcite we also remark on a useful @xmath8-dependence of the dynamical structure factor , which is characteristic to the non - bravais lattices and allows to select spectral contributions of specific branches in the portions of the @xmath8-space .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : linear ] we present a consideration of the harmonic theory for several common anisotropic models on the kagom lattice , explicate details of the diagonalization procedure , and show results of a representative calculation within the harmonic approximation . in sec .",
    "[ sec : nonlinear ] , anharmonic terms of the models are derived and the results of the ground - state selection calculations are presented .",
    "the spectral properties of the kagom - lattice antiferromagnets are also given a detailed exposition .",
    "technical aspects of the derivation of the quartic terms are given in appendix  [ appa ] .",
    "to set the stage , we provide the linear spin - wave consideration of the isotropic nearest - neighbor antiferromagnetic heisenberg model on the kagom lattice following the approach of ref .  .",
    "we continue with various extensions of the model , which are either relevant to real materials or allow to explore the role of quantum effects in a wider parameter space .",
    "these extensions include the anisotropic @xmath0 model , models with the single - ion and the out - of - plane dzyaloshinskii - moria anisotropies , and additional further - neighbor exchange terms .",
    "subsequently , the important steps of the diagonalization procedure that will be essential for the non - linear terms considered in sec .  [ sec : nonlinear ] are exposed . in the end of this section ,",
    "results of the calculations of the on - site magnetization within the linear spin - wave theory for the @xmath0 model are presented as an example .      within the spin - wave treatment , nearest - neighbor heisenberg antiferromagnet on the kagom lattice with the hamiltonian @xmath9",

    "summation is over bonds and @xmath11 are the sites of the lattice . aligning the @xmath12-axis on each site along the direction of the ordered moment and directing the @xmath13-axes out of the ordering plane transforms the hamiltonian ( [ has ] ) to a local spin basis @xmath14 where @xmath15 is an angle between two neighboring spins and we have introduced `` matrix '' product @xmath16 of spins with the matrix @xmath17 as a shorthand notation .     and ( b ) @xmath2 spin configurations . in ( a ) , primitive vectors of the kagom lattice and numbering of sites within the unit cell are shown . ]",
    "we choose the unit cell of the kagom lattice as an up - triangle , see fig .",
    "[ basis ] , and the primitive vectors of the corresponding triangular bravais lattice as @xmath18 all in units of @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the interatomic distance .",
    "the atomic coordinates within the unit cell are @xmath21 , @xmath22 , and @xmath23 .",
    "then , changing summation over bonds to summation over unit cells and the atomic index , @xmath24 , with @xmath253 enumerating atoms within the unit cell , the hamiltonian becomes @xmath26 where the product @xmath27 is according to ( [ hs ] ) , and @xmath28 with the coordinate of the unit cell @xmath29 .",
    "it should be noted that although a coplanar state with spins on each triangle in a 120@xmath10 structure minimizes the classical energy of ( [ has ] ) , such a state is not unique and the manifold of them is extensive.@xcite however , it is also clear from the hamiltonian in the local basis ( [ hs ] ) that the linear spin - wave theory is the same for _ any _ state from this degenerate manifold,@xcite because @xmath30 for any pair of spins in such state and @xmath31 terms do not contribute to the harmonic order of the @xmath5 expansion .",

    "one can rewrite this hamiltonian as @xmath41 with the vector operator @xmath42 and the @xmath43 matrix @xmath44 @xmath45 where @xmath46 and @xmath47 is the identity matrix .    for a moment",
    ", we will confine ourselves to the eigenvalue problem of @xmath48 .",
    "because of an obvious commutativity of the matrices @xmath49 and @xmath50 , the eigenvalues of @xmath44 are straightforwardly related to their eigenvalues , and , in turn , are determined by the eigenvalues @xmath51 of the matrix @xmath52 , so that the spin - wave excitation energies are @xmath53 with the frequencies @xmath54 and @xmath55 thus , the problem of the diagonalization of @xmath48 in ( [ h2f ] ) is reduced to the eigenvalue problem of @xmath52 in ( [ mk ] ) . from the characteristic equation for @xmath52 one finds @xmath56 where @xmath57 is introduced and factorization is performed with the help of a useful identity @xmath58 which holds once the cosine arguments satisfy @xmath59 .",
    "thus , the @xmath51 eigenvalues are @xmath60 of the resultant spin - wave excitations one is completely dispersionless and has zero energy , referred to as the `` flat mode , '' and two are `` normal , '' i.e. dispersive modes , which are degenerate in the heisenberg limit @xmath61 the nature of the flat mode has been discussed previously.@xcite generally , such modes owe their origin to both the topological structure of the underlying lattices that facilitate spin frustration and the insufficient constraint on the manifold of spin configurations . physically , they correspond to the localized , alternating out - of - plane fluctuations of spins around elementary hexagons,@xcite which do not experience a restoring force in the harmonic order in the heisenberg limit , hence their energy is zero . in the following ,",
    "various anisotropies lift the energy of such a flat mode , but preserve its flatness .",
    "next , we consider an extension of the heisenberg model on the kagom lattice to the @xmath0 model with anisotropy of the easy - plane type , @xmath62 .",
    "the original motivation for this extension , see ref .",
    ", was that the degeneracy among the @xmath63 coplanar states in this model remains the same as in the heisenberg model .",
    "this has allowed us to extend the parameter space and to study the effect of quantum fluctuations in the ground - state selection without lifting degeneracy of the classical ground - state manifold , see sec .",
    "[ sec : nonlinear ] for more detail.@xcite    in the case of the @xmath0 model , the plane for the coplanar 120@xmath10 structure is chosen by the anisotropy . in the local spin basis of ( [ hs ] ) with @xmath13-axis out of the ordering plane , the @xmath0 addition to the heisenberg model reads as @xmath64 a now straightforward spin - wave algebra of ( [ hsxxz ] ) leaves the structure of the harmonic hamiltonian in ( [ h2f ] ) intact , yielding corrections to the hamiltonian matrix in ( [ hmatrix1 ] ) @xmath65 the spin - wave energies for the @xmath0 model in ( [ ek ] ) are now with @xmath66 and give @xmath67 for the flat mode , which is now at a finite energy , and @xmath68 for the dispersive modes .      instead of the @xmath0 correction ,",
    "an alternative way of generating easy - plane anisotropy is to add a positive single - ion term @xmath69 where @xmath13 is the out - of - plane axis in the local spin basis of ( [ hs ] ) as before .",
    "this term , in a complete similarity to the @xmath0 case , gives zero contribution to the classical energy , does not affect cubic anharmonicity , and does not contribute to the degeneracy lifting of the 120@xmath10 manifold through the quartic terms.@xcite its contribution to the harmonic hamiltonian ( [ hmatrix1 ] ) is also simple @xmath70 where @xmath71 and @xmath47 is the identity matrix .",
    "thus , once again , the eigenvalue problem of @xmath72 reduces to the eigenvalue problem of @xmath52 , resulting in the spin - wave frequencies @xmath73 , and the spin - wave energy of the flat mode @xmath74 while energies of the dispersive modes are @xmath75 which should be compared to the @xmath0 results above .",
    "there is a high degree of similarity of the single - ion anisotropy model ( [ hd ] ) and its results to the @xmath0 case , the most important being no degeneracy lifting among the 120@xmath10 manifold of classical states at the harmonic level of approximation .",
    "however , there is also an important difference .",
    "if analyzed in real space in the local basis , the structure of the spin - flip terms is different in the two models . in particular",
    ", the single - ion term creates spin flips that are purely local while the spin - flip hopping and other amplitudes responsible for degeneracy - lifting remain independent of anisotropy @xmath76 .",
    "therefore , from the point of view of the real - space perturbation theory , described in ref .  , the minimal order in which an effective degeneracy - lifting interaction is generated is different in the two models.@xcite we will address this difference in section  [ sec : nonlinear ] in more detail .",
    "important correction to the heisenberg spin model ( [ has ] ) that commonly occurs in real magnetic materials with the kagom structure is the anisotropic dzyaloshinskii - moriya ( dm ) interaction .    the out - of - plane dm term , see fig .",
    "[ fig : dm ] , is the main perturbation to the heisenberg hamiltonian of the @xmath77 kagom - lattice antiferromagnet fe - jarosite,@xcite @xmath78 materials herbertsmithite@xcite and vesignieite,@xcite and other systems.@xcite this anisotropy differs from the ones considered above in a number of aspects , but allows for a very similar analytical treatment , mainly because of its nearest - neighbor nature .     and @xmath79 operators in the vector - product in .",
    "]    the antisymmetric dzyaloshinskii - moriya interaction is generally written as @xmath80 in order to determine the dm vectors @xmath81 one has to specify the order of sites in the vector product , which may be represented by the bond direction from the first to the second spin in each pair .",
    "a convenient choice consists of ordering spins uniformly along the chains , see fig .",
    "[ fig : dm ] .",
    "then , the symmetry analysis yields a unique pattern of the dm vectors orthogonal to the kagom plane as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : dm ] .",
    "@xcite note , that the in - plane components of the dm vectors are strictly forbidden once the the kagom plane coincides with a mirror crystal plane .",
    "@xcite    apparent alternation of the dm vectors between up triangles with @xmath82 and down triangles with @xmath83 is partly fictitious , because it is a consequence of the chosen bond gauge , in which the two types of triangles are circumvented oppositely , fig .",
    "[ fig : dm ] .",
    "the dm interactions on the two triangles favor the same sense of spin rotation or chirality .",
    "hence , for a given sign of @xmath84 , the dm term selects one of the two @xmath1 structures with positive ( @xmath85 ) or negative ( @xmath86 ) chiralities , yielding energy gain @xmath87 per site . on the other hand , for the @xmath2 state contributions from up and",
    "down triangles come with opposite sign and cancel out . in the following , we assume @xmath85 and , consequently , perform the spin - wave expansion around the @xmath1 state with positive chiralities , see fig .",
    "[ fig : dm ] .",
    "it is also straightforward to see that the dm term does not induce additional canting and preserves the 120@xmath10 magnetic structure in the @xmath88@xmath13 plane .",
    "consider the dm term ( [ hdm ] ) on the @xmath89 bond in fig .",
    "[ fig : dm ] written in the rotating local spin basis ( [ hs ] ) @xmath90 where @xmath91 , and the first term contributes to the classical , harmonic , and quartic orders of the @xmath5 expansion , while the second contributes in the cubic order .    since the dm term concerns only the nearest - neighbor pairs of spins and",
    "because in the @xmath1 state all dm bonds contribute identically , the overall structure of the harmonic part of the hamiltonian remains the same as in .",
    "then , some algebra yields the harmonic hamiltonian @xmath72 in the form with the dm contributions @xmath92 where @xmath93 and @xmath52 is unchanged from , again reducing the eigenvalue problem of the harmonic spin - wave theory to the one of @xmath52 , already solved in and .",

    "the flat mode energy is @xmath95 and the energies of the dispersive modes are @xmath96 which are similar to the @xmath0 and the single - ion , results and are in agreement with ref .  .",
    "the energies of the magnon modes @xmath97 are illustrated in fig .",

    "opposite to the previous extensions , the dm term contributes to the cubic anharmonicities , see . using the second term in for one bond and extending it to the entire lattice we find for the @xmath1 state @xmath100 whose structure is identical to the cubic term from the @xmath101-part of the hamiltonian considered in sec .",
    "[ sec : nonlinear ] .",

    "the other term of the same order in the @xmath5-expansion is from the quartic terms , @xmath233 , which was obtained for the dm model in ( [ ehf4 ] ) .",

    "as is mentioned above , the summation over magnon branches in ( [ gamma1 ] ) contains six distinct terms , or potential `` decay channels . ''",
    "a particular decay channel may or may not be contributing to the decays , depending on the kinematic conditions discussed below .    before we divert our attention to a specific model , the following qualitative consideration can be made .",
    "the form in ( [ gamma1 ] ) suggests that @xmath240 , which is small compared to @xmath241 in the large-@xmath4 limit .",
    "thus , generally , one can expect a regular , perturbative @xmath5-effect of broadening of the higher - energy part of the dispersive branches due to decays into the lower - energy states.@xcite however , a spectacular exception to this rule must occur if both of the decay products , branches @xmath229 and @xmath230 , belong to flat modes with @xmath242 .",
    "clearly , this decay channel produces an essential singularity in @xmath243 and @xmath244 at the energy equal to twice the flat mode energy , the effect that can be seen as a resonance - like decay .",
    "therefore , a special care must be exercised in this case as any residual dispersion of the flat mode becomes crucial in regularizing such a singularity .",
    "in fact , the way of removing this singularity is offered by the same @xmath5 fluctuations due to cubic terms , as the self - energy ( [ sigma ] ) also yields a dispersion for the flat mode .",
    "this can also be interpreted as a fluctuation - generated further - neighbor @xmath7 spin - spin interactions,@xcite and such a dispersion of the flat mode has been observed in fe - jarosite.@xcite still , this scenario implies that the fluctuation - induced flat - mode bandwidth , @xmath245 , is of the order @xmath5 compared to the bandwidths of the normal dispersive modes , @xmath246 .    introducing this @xmath5 dispersion for the flat modes in ( [ gamma1 ] ) , suggests that the near - resonance decay - induced broadening of the dispersive mode within the energy window of the width @xmath247 near @xmath248 should now scale as @xmath249 .",
    "this is the _ same _ energy scale as the spin - wave dispersion itself without any obvious additional smallness .",
    "therefore , our analysis implies a very strong broadening , likely eliminating spectral weight nearly completely from the respective energy range even when spin @xmath4 is large , providing an example of a spectacular quantum effect in an almost classical system .",

    "an extensive analysis of the kinematic decay conditions in representative models of the frustrated spin systems has been provided previously.@xcite here , the modification of the problem is in having three different magnon branches , which modifies these condition to @xmath253 so that every decay channel @xmath254 has to be analyzed separately .",
