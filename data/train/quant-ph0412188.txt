    "entanglement is a fundamental notion of quantum theory , having no classical counterpart .",
    "a pure state of two quantum systems is called entangled if it is not a product of a state for one system and a state for another .",
    "this definition is similar to the definition of statistical dependence in the classical theory .",
    "however , entanglement implies stronger correlations between the observables of both systems than it is allowed by the classical statistical theory .",
    "the first machine generating entanglement was described by schrdinger in 1935 in the very paper introducing the notion of entanglement @xcite . in his famous _ gedankenexperiment",
    "_ schrdinger describes a machine which produces entanglement between the states of a cat and a decaying nucleus placed inside a closed box together with a diabolic machine , which kills the cat if the nucleus decays .",
    "the nucleus is initially in a non - decayed state @xmath2 and in one hour it has a probability of @xmath3 to decay to the state @xmath4 .",
    "if we denote the state of alive and dead cat @xmath5 and @xmath6 respectively , and the initial and final states of the diabolic machine @xmath7 and @xmath8 respectively , then in one hour the state of nucleus , diabolic machine and cat transforms ( up to normalization ) like @xmath9 the state in the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ 1 ] ) is entangled since it is pure and is not a product .",
    "we see that the nucleus together with the diabolic machine act as `` entangling machine '' for the cat , because they produce entanglement between themselves and the cat .",
    "however , this machine works only if the initial state of the cat is `` alive ''",
    ". indeed , if we place a dead cat inside the box , then the transformation ( under the natural assumption that the diabolic machine does not affect the dead cat ) will be @xmath10 and the states of nucleus and cat are not entangled .",
    "thus we have found that the entangling machine proposed by schrdinger is state - dependent , i.e. it produces entanglement for some input states and does not for others .",
    "all quantum devices used today for producing entanglement between quantum systems share this feature with schrdinger s machine : they all require the quantum systems to be prepared in definite initial states .",
    "these states can be quite `` natural '' , e.g. the vacuum state of two sub - harmonics in the process of parametric down - conversion @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , it is interesting from both fundamental and practical points of view to know if it is possible to design a state - independent entangling machine which generates equal non - zero amount of entanglement for any state of the incoming system .",
    "such a machine would have fundamental importance because it would clarify the relation between the notions of `` quantum state '' and `` quantum entanglement '' , i.e. if the local and non - local properties of quantum systems can be manipulated independently from one another .",
    "from the practical point of view such machine would have applications to preparation of entangled state of two systems in the case where the initial state of one of them is not fully known at the moment of entangling interaction .",
    "this situation is typical for eavesdropping in quantum cryptography and can be met in quantum computation @xcite .",
    "quantum machines generating entanglement in a universal ( input state - independent ) way have been considered by alber @xcite and buzek and hillery @xcite . both approaches",
    "aim at entangling two similar systems ( having the same number of levels ) in either antisymmetric @xcite or symmetric @xcite way .",
    "the latter type of entangling interaction has been recently realized in an experiment @xcite . in the present paper",
    "we develop an alternative approach which does not require two systems to be similar to one another ( cf . cat and nucleus above ) . as a consequence , our approach can",
    "not and does not impose any symmetry condition on the output , and the machine of our interest can be called asymmetric universal entangling machine ( auem ) . as we will see later , to obtain a non - trivial machine we will need to impose an additional constraint , linking the machine output to its input .",
    "other and deeper differences between the approach of the present paper and that of refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite will be clarified in the next sections .",
    "the paper is structured as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we give a definition of asymmetric universal entangling machine . in sec .",
    "iii we deduce the explicit form of a transformation entangling a @xmath0-level system in an a priori unknown state to a @xmath1-level ancilla and prove its optimality .",
    "iv is devoted to different forms of representation of the introduced machine , in particular cases giving other universal machines discussed in the literature , in particular , the symmetric quantum entangler @xcite , the symmetric @xcite and asymmetric @xcite quantum cloners , the quantum information distributor @xcite and the universal - not ( unot ) gate @xcite . in sec .",
    "v we turn to the simplest case of two - level systems ( qubits ) and describe a quantum circuit realizing the universal entangling transformation . in the same section the asymmetric entangler is compared to the symmetric one , introduced by buzek and hillery , and the differences are discussed .",
    "let us now define precisely the machine we are interested in .",
    "we consider a signal system @xmath11 having a state space @xmath12 of @xmath0 dimensions and initially prepared in an unknown state @xmath13 . another quantum system @xmath14 with a state space @xmath15 of @xmath16 dimensions is called _ ancilla _ ; it is initially prepared in a definite state @xmath17 .",
    "we define quantum entangling machine as a physical device which takes as input these two systems and produces as output two systems @xmath18 and @xmath19 with the same number of dimensions of state space @xmath0 and @xmath16 respectively . in the future we will often omit primes and call the output systems @xmath18 and @xmath19 `` signal '' and `` ancilla '' as well , though they are not necessarily the same physical objects which entered the machine .",
    "we demand for our machine that the joint state of signal and ancilla at the output is a pure state @xmath20 , which generally is not a product of two local states , i.e. a state for @xmath18 and a state for @xmath19 . to obtain a universal ( input state independent ) quantum entangling machine",
    "we demand that the degree of entanglement contained in @xmath20 is independent of the input signal state @xmath13 . at this step",
    "we need to implement a quantitative measure of bipartite entanglement .",
    "fortunately , for pure state there is a good measure of entanglement @xcite , defined as von neumann entropy of the signal system alone : @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the density operator of the signal at the output of the entangling machine : @xmath23 the entanglement @xmath24 defined in eq .",
    "( 3 ) varies within the limits @xmath25 , with @xmath26 realized for maximally entangled systems and @xmath27 for statistically independent ones .",
    "now the _ condition of universal entanglement _ can be formulated as follows : a machine should produce the same amount of entanglement @xmath24 for any input signal state @xmath13 .",
    "however , this condition alone can be satisfied by a trivial machine with @xmath28 , which discards the input and produces as output the maximally entangled state of signal and ancilla : @xmath29 where @xmath30 and @xmath31 are two sets of orthonormal vectors in the state spaces of signal and ancilla respectively .",
    "the entanglement of the output is @xmath26 and of course it does not depend on the input state which is simply discarded .",
    "the same argument can be applied to the antisymmetric entangler of ref .",
    "@xcite ( see discussion in ref .",
    "@xcite ) . to obtain a non - trivial machine",
    "it is necessary that the output state , but not the degree of its entanglement , be related in some way to the unknown input state of the signal .",
    "the most simple and natural way to do so is to demand some `` similarity '' between the output and the input of the signal system : the signal output should in some sense `` resemble '' the input , so that the latter can not be discarded .",
    "a natural measure of similarity of two quantum states is the so - called fidelity @xcite . in our case",
    "the fidelity between the signal output and the signal input is defined as @xmath32 and we may formulate _ the condition of universal similarity _ as follows : a machine should change the signal system in such way that the fidelity of the signal output with respect to the signal input is constant for any input signal state @xmath13 .",
    "thus we define an auem as a physical device having as input systems @xmath11 and @xmath14 in states @xmath13 and @xmath17 respectively and producing as output systems @xmath18 and @xmath19 in a pure state @xmath20 such that both entanglement eq .",
    "( [ e ] ) and fidelity eq .",
    "( [ f ] ) are independent of the state @xmath13 .",
    "we suppose that the entanglement is non - zero and the fidelity satisfies @xmath33 .",
    "the fidelity equal to or below @xmath34 is not interesting because in this case the output is not more similar to the input than the totally mixed state with the density matrix @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is the unity matrix .",
    "we expect that @xmath37 will be a decreasing function of @xmath38 , i.e. that we need to `` pay '' for the entanglement by a degradation of the signal state fidelity .",
    "the obvious limiting points are @xmath39 ( trivial machine with the output given by eq .",
    "( [ max ] ) ) and @xmath40 ( no interaction ) .",
    "the most important question now is if the machine defined in this way is possible to realize by physical means .",
    "there is a number of quantum machines which are defined by general demands imposed on the outputs and which proved to be `` impossible '' , i.e. not allowed by the laws of quantum mechanics , for example the perfect cloning machine @xcite and the perfect universal - not gate @xcite .",
    "a number of other machines proved to be `` possible '' , e.g. the universal ( imperfect ) cloning machine @xcite , the asymmetric cloning machine @xcite , phase - covariant cloners @xcite , and the ( imperfect ) universal - not gate @xcite .",
    "if auem would prove to be possible , another important problem would be to find the optimal machine , producing maximal degree of entanglement for a given degradation of the signal state fidelity .",
    "let us suppose that the entangling machine defined in the previous section is possible and analyze the properties of the optimal one .",
    "while deducing the properties of the optimal machine we will find its explicit form and thus prove its existence .      in the definition of the entangling machine we demanded that the output state of signal and ancilla is pure .",
    "let us now show that if this state is mixed , entanglement is not greater .",
    "suppose that the joint state of the signal and the ancilla at the output of the entangling machine is a mixed state @xmath41 .",
    "the entanglement of this state can be measured by such a measure as the entanglement of formation @xcite , which is found in the following way .",
    "first we unravel the state @xmath41 , i.e. represent it as a sum of pure states with some weights , then calculate the entanglement of each pure state according to eq .",
    "( [ e ] ) and take a weighted sum of them , which will give us the entanglement of that unravelling .",
    "the minimum of this quantity over all possible unravelling of a mixed state is called its entanglement of formation . for pure states it coincides with the entanglement given by eq .",
    "( [ e ] ) .",
    "it has been proven that the entanglement of formation is the upper bound for all other measures of entanglement @xcite .",
    "let us denote the entanglement of formation of @xmath41 as @xmath42 .",
    "now we wish to show that for the same output signal state @xmath43 we can construct a machine producing not less entanglement than @xmath42 .",
    "the output state @xmath41 , as any mixed state , can be purified on a larger state space : a second ancilla @xmath44 can be added and a pure state @xmath45 can be found on the state space of the signal and both ancillas , such that @xmath46 .",
    "it can be easily proven from the convexity of von neumann entropy that @xmath42 is not greater than the entanglement between @xmath11 and @xmath47 in @xmath45 ( see the second lemma in ref .",
    "it means that for any mixed output state @xmath41 we always can construct another entangling machine with a bigger ancilla and pure output @xmath45 , which produces not less entanglement and results in the same transformation of the signal state .",
    "now we analyze the structure of the pure output state of our machine . as any bipartite pure state , it can be written in the form of schmidt decomposition @xmath48 where @xmath49 is an orthonormal basis in @xmath12 , @xmath50 is an orthonormal set of vectors in @xmath15 , whose dimensionality is @xmath51 , and @xmath52 are some complex numbers ( schmidt coefficients ) , satisfying the normalization condition @xmath53 we accept that the vectors are numbered so that @xmath54 .",
    "the input signal state can be decomposed in the basis @xmath49 as : @xmath55 where @xmath56 are some complex coefficients , satisfying the normalization condition @xmath57    now the fidelity , eq . ( [ e ] ) , and the entanglement , eq .",
    "( [ f ] ) , can be expressed as @xmath58 @xmath59 where @xmath60 is boltzmann s h - function .",
    "now our task is to find such form of the output state which ( i ) maximizes @xmath24 for given @xmath38 and ( ii ) maximizes @xmath38 for given @xmath24 .",
    "we start with solving the first problem .",
    "let us consider @xmath38 and @xmath24 as functions on the coordinate space @xmath61 created by @xmath62 and @xmath63 , satisfying the normalization conditions eqs .",
    "( [ lambda ] ) , ( [ c ] ) and the ordering of @xmath64 s .",
    "let us define on @xmath61 a subspace @xmath65 by @xmath66 .",
    "now , for given @xmath38 on @xmath65 : @xmath67 and the entanglement is @xmath68 the h - function is maximal when all its arguments are equal .",
    "let us denote by @xmath69 the one - parameter subspace of @xmath65 with @xmath70 . on this subspace @xmath71 reaches its maximum @xmath72 , where the function @xmath73 is defined as @xmath74 and has the meaning of maximum of the h - function over @xmath0 arguments summing up to unity , with the fixed maximal argument @xmath38 .",
    "this function is strictly decreasing for @xmath75 , because its derivative @xmath76}$ ] is strictly negative in this region . on the entire space @xmath61 the relation @xmath77 holds ( from eq .",
    "( [ fsum ] ) ) and for any given @xmath78 , the entanglement is bounded above by the value @xmath79 ( from the meaning of the latter ) .",
    "since @xmath73 is a decreasing function of @xmath38 , it follows that @xmath80 , i.e. @xmath81 is the entanglement maximum for the given fidelity .",
    "now we turn to the second problem .",
    "let us fix the entanglement @xmath82 satisfying @xmath83 .",
    "we define the fidelity @xmath84 by equation @xmath85 , which has a unique solution , since @xmath73 is strictly decreasing on @xmath75 .",
    "this fidelity corresponds to a point in the subspace @xmath69 ( see above ) .",
    "let us prove that @xmath84 is the fidelity maximum for the given entanglement .",
    "suppose that there is a point on @xmath61 , giving the fidelity @xmath86 and entanglement @xmath87 .",
    "the maximal value of @xmath87 is given by @xmath88 , as proven above . since the function",
    "@xmath73 is _ strictly _ decreasing on @xmath75 , it follows that @xmath89 , that is , the value @xmath82 is unreachable for fidelity higher than @xmath84 .",
    "this completes the proof .    summing up",
    ", we see that there is a one - parameter subspace ( @xmath69 ) , where both conditions ( i ) and ( ii ) are satisfied simultaneously . on this subspace @xmath90 and",
    "the output state can be written as @xmath91 where the phases of coefficients are absorbed by @xmath92 . both the fidelity @xmath38 and the entanglement @xmath93 of the state eq .",
    "( [ out ] ) are independent of the input state @xmath13 , and therefore , a machine transforming @xmath94 into the state eq .",
    "( [ out ] ) is an auem and an optimal auem . we still need to prove that such a machine exist .",
    "it will be done in the next subsections by deducing the explicit form of the necessary unitary transformation .",
    "now we look how the optimal auem is `` seen '' by the signal system alone . for the signal the auem acts as a quantum channel , which transforms its state from a pure state @xmath95 to a mixed state @xmath22 .",
    "this transformation can be found by substituting eq .",
    "( [ out ] ) into eq .",
    "( [ rhos ] ) , which gives @xmath96 where @xmath97 is connected to @xmath38 by the relation @xmath98 . the quantum channel defined by eq . ( [ depol ] )",
    "is called `` depolarizing channel '' and the parameter @xmath97 varying from 0 to 1 is known as `` depolarized fraction '' .",
    "the depolarizing channel is typically taken as the starting point for the discussion of universal quantum machines , e.g. quantum cloners @xcite . in our approach",
    "it has been shown that this channel is optimal for our purpose .      in future",
    "it will be very useful to implement the formalism of generalized bell basis and pauli operators to systems with number of dimensions greater than 2 @xcite .",
