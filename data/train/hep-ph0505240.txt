    "the use of forward proton tagging as a means to discover new physics at the lhc has received a great deal of attention recently ( see for example @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the process of interest is the so - called ` central exclusive ' process , @xmath1 , where @xmath2 denotes the absence of hadronic activity ( ` gap ' ) between the outgoing protons and the decay products of the central system @xmath3 .",
    "there are two primary reasons , from which all other advantages follow , that central exclusive production is attractive .",
    "firstly , if the outgoing protons remain intact and scatter through small angles , then , to a very good approximation , the central system @xmath3 is produced in the @xmath4 , c and p even state .",
    "an absolute determination of the quantum numbers of any resonance is possible by measurements of the correlations between outgoing proton momenta .",
    "secondly , the mass of the central system can be determined very accurately from a measurement of the transverse and longitudinal momentum components of the outgoing protons alone . for the case of exclusive particle production",
    ", this means an accurate determination of the mass irrespective of the decay mode of the centrally produced particle .",
    "there are several locations around the lhc interaction points at which it is possible to install forward proton tagging detectors .",
    "the 220 m region will almost certainly be instrumented at both atlas and cms at lhc startup @xcite , and there are plans to install tagging detectors in the 420 m region at some point in the future @xcite .",
    "recent studies suggest that the missing mass resolution will be @xmath5 for a @xmath6 gev central system , if both protons are detected at 420 m from the interaction point @xcite . for configurations in which one proton is detected at 220 m , and one at 420 m",
    ", the resolution deteriorates to approximately @xmath7 .",
    "there is no acceptance for central systems with masses less than @xmath8 gev with 220 m detectors alone .",
    "previous analyses have focused primarily on light ( @xmath9 gev @xmath10 gev ) standard model higgs production , with the higgs decaying to 2 b - jets @xcite .",
    "the potentially copious b - jet background is controlled by a combination of the @xmath4 selection rule , which strongly suppresses central @xmath11 production at leading order @xcite , and the mass resolution from the tagging detectors .",
    "the missing mass resolution is critical to controlling the background because the remaining b - jet background is a continuum beneath the higgs mass peak , and therefore poor resolution simply allows more background events into the mass window around the peak . assuming a gaussian mass resolution of width @xmath12 gev",
    ", it is estimated that 11 signal events , with a signal to background ratio of order 1 , can be achieved with a luminosity of 30  fb@xmath13 in the @xmath11 decay channel @xcite .",
    "it is worth noting that in the large tan @xmath14 region of mssm parameter space , the situation becomes much more favourable , leading to predicted signal to background ratios in excess of 20 for the lightest higgs mass of @xmath15 gev @xcite .",
    "the central exclusive channel may be the discovery channel in this case .",
    "whilst the @xmath11 channel is certainly attractive , since it allows direct access to the dominant decay mode of the light higgs , there are two potential problems which render it challenging from an experimental perspective .",
    "firstly , since the mass resolution of the proton taggers is used to suppress the background , any degradation in the expected resolution will adversely affect the signal to background ratio . secondly , level 1 triggering of @xmath16 events is difficult .",
    "the 420 m detectors are at or beyond the distance at which signals arrive at the central detectors in time for a level 1 trigger decision .",
    "triggering on the central system may therefore be necessary , but the low - mass di - jet signature of the @xmath16 channel will certainly be a challenge for both atlas and cms .    in this paper , we turn our attention to the @xmath17 decay mode of the light standard model higgs boson , and above the 2 @xmath18 threshold , the @xmath0 decay mode .",
    "as we shall see , this channel does not suffer from either of the above problems : suppression of the dominant backgrounds does not rely primarily on the mass resolution of the detectors , and certainly in the leptonic and semi - leptonic decay channels , level 1 triggering is not a problem .",
    "the advantages of forward proton tagging are , however , still explicit . even for the double leptonic decay channel ( i.e. two final state neutrinos )",
    ", the mass resolution should be better than @xmath19 ( and @xmath20 for double 420m - tagged events ) , and is expected to improve further with increasing higgs mass , and of course observation of the higgs in the exclusive double tagged channel immediately establishes its quantum numbers .",
    "in section [ signal ] we use the exhume monte carlo @xcite to simulate the signal process @xmath21 , and discuss possible trigger strategies for the lhc experiments .",
    "exhume is a direct implementation of the calculations of @xcite . in section [ background ]",
    "we survey the backgrounds , and in section [ sb ] we present our conclusions .",
    "( 140,120)(0,0 ) ( 0,0 )",
    "the central exclusive production cross section for the standard model higgs boson was calculated in @xcite . in figure [ wwxs ]",
    "we show the cross section for the process @xmath22 as a function of the higgs mass @xmath23 .",
    "the increasing branching ratio to @xmath0 as @xmath23 increases compensates for the falling central exclusive production cross section . for comparison",
    "we also show the cross section times branching ratio for @xmath24 .",
    "we also expect the @xmath0 channel to be effective in the study of the low tan @xmath14 mssm @xcite , although we leave this for a future publication .",
    "events with two @xmath18 bosons in the final state fall into 3 broad categories from an experimental perspective , depending on the decay modes of the @xmath18 .",
    "events in which at least one of the @xmath18 bosons decays in either the @xmath25 or @xmath26 channel are the simplest , and will usually pass the level 1 trigger thresholds of atlas and cms due to the high @xmath27 final state lepton , as we shall see below .",
    "if neither of the @xmath18 bosons decay in the @xmath25 or @xmath26 channel , the event can still pass the level 1 trigger thresholds if a @xmath18 decays in the @xmath28 channel , with the @xmath28 subsequently decaying leptonically ( although the leptons from the @xmath28 decays have a softer @xmath27 spectrum ) . the 4-jet decay mode occurs approximately half the time , but it is unlikely that this signature will pass the level 1 triggers of either atlas or cms without information from the proton taggers .",
    "it is possible that the 220 m proton detectors can be included in the level 1 trigger and therefore events with one proton detected at 220 m could be taken , even in the 4-jet case .",
    "this will also increase the trigger efficiency in the leptonic and semi - leptonic channels .",
    "we leave this possibility for future study .",
    "( 160,70)(0,0 ) ( 0,0 )    in figure [ wwleptons ] we show the pseudorapidity and transverse momentum distributions of the decay lepton in events where at least one @xmath18(or a @xmath28 lepton in the case of the @xmath29 decay mode ) decays in the @xmath25 or @xmath26 channel , for @xmath30 gev . for the doubly leptonic decay modes ,",
    "the highest transverse momentum lepton is chosen .",
    "events were generated using exhume 1.3 @xcite interfaced to pythia 6.205 @xcite for the decay of the higgs boson .",
    "the cms level 1 trigger has a single electron threshold of @xmath31 gev with a pseudorapidity coverage of @xmath32 , and @xmath33 gev for a single muon with @xmath32 @xcite . at atlas , the level 1 trigger thresholds are @xmath34 gev , @xmath32 for single electrons and @xmath35 gev , @xmath32 for single muons @xcite . from figure [ wwleptons ] , it is clear that a reasonable fraction of signal events will be taken by these standard triggers . in figure [ wwjets ]",
    "we show the jet @xmath36 and pseudorapidity distributions ( 2 entries per event ) for the two highest @xmath27 jets in the semi - leptonic decay channel .",
    "the jets are found using the exclusive @xmath37 algorithm @xcite , in the @xmath38 scheme . in exclusive mode",
    ", the final state is forced into a 2-jet topology .",
    "the merging scale ( often termed @xmath39 ) which defines the two jets has been used as a powerful background suppression tool ( see for example @xcite ) .",
    "we do not simulate the background processes to the hadronic final state level in this paper , and we therefore leave the details of optimising the jet finding for a later publication , whilst noting that such optimisation will undoubtedly be important . requiring @xmath40 central jets ( and perhaps reduced hadronic activity outside the jets ) at level 1 in conjunction with a high @xmath27 electron or muon should allow the single lepton trigger thresholds to be further reduced .",
    "it is also likely that the trigger efficiency in the @xmath28 channel can be improved .",
    "for the purposes of this paper , events with @xmath28 decays are kept only if they pass the standard trigger definitions outlined above . in summary ,",
    "our trigger efficiency estimates here are conservative .",
    "( 160,70)(0,0 ) ( 0,0 )    besides the level 1 trigger , the other important ingredient in the efficiency comes from the acceptance of the proton taggers themselves .",
    "the acceptances were obtained using a fast simulation program for the cms detector , which includes a parameterisation of the response of the roman pots based on a detailed simulation @xcite where the scattered protons were tracked with the mad @xcite package .",
    "mad was used with lhc optics version 6.2 .",
    "the acceptance rises from 60% at @xmath41 gev to 80% at @xmath42 gev .",
    ".[signal1]the effect of cuts on signal samples for selecting semileptonic ww decays ( @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 ) for different higgs masses using the standard atlas leptonic trigger thresholds . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "( 160,120)(0,0 ) ( 0,0 )    one of the attractive features of the @xmath0 channel is the lack of a relatively large irreducible continuum background process , such as central exclusive @xmath11 production in the case of @xmath16 , which relies on the experimental missing mass resolution being good enough to provide adequate suppression .",
    "the primary exclusive backgrounds are illustrated in figures [ bg1 ] and [ bg2 ] .",
    "tree - level photon - photon processes ( figures 4 ( b - e ) ) are calculated using calchep @xcite .",
    "the background coming from processes of the type shown in figures [ bg1 ] ( b ) , ( d ) and ( e ) is potentially large due to collinear logarithms corresponding to lepton ( or quark ) production at small angles . by requiring that the leptons ( or jets ) are central the contribution from such diagrams decreases . after imposing the pseudorapidity cut @xmath32 ,",
    "the cross sections corresponding to all tree - level photon - induced subprocesses are @xmath46 = 0.015 ( 0.033 , 0.37 , 2 ) fb for @xmath23 = 120 ( 140 , 160 , 180 ) gev where we integrated over the mass interval @xmath47 , assuming a gaussian mass resolution of the proton taggers of width of @xmath40 gev .",
    "note that these cross sections include a gap survival factor , which according to the calculations of @xcite is @xmath48 for the integrated cross section .",
    "therefore , even without additional experimental cuts on the final state , this background contribution is comfortably below the signal cross section for @xmath49 gev . after applying the single leptonic trigger cuts as detailed in table 1 ,",
    "the qed background cross sections become @xmath50 0.01 ( 0.02,0.27,1.53 ) fb for @xmath51 120 ( 140,160,180 ) gev the overall photon - photon background contribution rises with @xmath23 .",
    "imposing a cut on the transverse momenta of the outgoing protons @xmath52 mev suppresses the photon fusion by process approximately a factor of @xmath53 , whilst reducing the signal by 10% ( 40 % ) cuts on the final - state protons induce a further reduction of the survival factor in qed - induced processes , for example for @xmath54  mev @xmath55 .",
    "such a cut will most likely be necessary for higgs masses above the ww threshold , and we include it for large higgs masses in tables [ signal1 ] and [ signal2 ] .",
    "of the outgoing protons is close to the intrinsic @xmath27 spread of the lhc beams , and it may therefore be necessary to raise this cut in practice @xcite ] .",
    "further optimisation of the cuts on the final - state particles should enable this qed background to be reduced further without dramatically affecting the signal . in principle",
    ", the angular distributions and correlations between the reconstructed @xmath18 bosons will be different for the ( scalar ) higgs decay and the photon fusion backgrounds . with the expected low number of signal events and the centrality requirement on the @xmath18 decay products however ,",
    "such techniques are unlikely to be useful .",
    "the other important background comes from the qcd @xmath18-strahlung sub - processes of the type shown in figures 5 ( a ) and ( b ) , which have recently been studied in @xcite . here",
    "we have to take into account the non - trivial polarization structure of the @xmath4 amplitude .",
    "this was done in @xcite using the spinor technique of @xcite . again to suppress the collinear ( quark line ) logarithms we impose the pseudorapidity cut @xmath56 on the final state quarks . with these kinematic cuts ,",
    "the cross section for the processes in figures 5 ( a ) and ( b ) , summed over the two families of fermions and including both @xmath57 and @xmath58 configurations , is @xmath59 @xmath60 pb for @xmath61 gev .",
    "it rises to @xmath62 pb at @xmath63 gev and then decreases slowly for higher masses , falling to @xmath64 pb at @xmath42 gev .",
    "this cross section should be multiplied by the phase space factor @xmath65 , again assuming @xmath66 , and by the corresponding gluon luminosity @xcite .",
    "this leads to the qcd background cross section at @xmath67 tev of 1.7 fb for @xmath68 gev . above the 2-w threshold , we expect to be able to suppress this background extremely effectively by requiring that the quark jets fall within an appropriate @xmath18 mass window , since the background will be a continuum beneath the @xmath18 mass peak .",
    "the potential problem is therefore only for higgs masses below 160 gev , for the case in which the @xmath69 decays hadronically and therefore the di - jet mass from the signal events falls outside the @xmath18 mass window . in figure [ mjj ]",
    "we show the di - jet mass distribution for the semi - leptonic w - decay channel , @xmath68 gev , after the level 1 leptonic trigger and di - jet pseudorapidity cuts , for the signal sample only . imposing the @xmath18 mass window",
    "effectively removes all hadronically decaying @xmath69 events from the sample , with the benefit of greatly enhancing the signal to background ratio .",
    "as can be seen from table 1 , this reduces the signal by a factor of @xmath70 for @xmath30 gev .",
    "a fraction of these lost events can be recovered if the leptonic trigger thresholds are reduced at level 1 , since forcing the @xmath69 to decay leptonically reduces the average @xmath27 of the decay leptons",
    ". there may be alternative ways of reducing this background , for example by imposing cuts on the final state to account for the azimuthal correlations between the quark jets . a full monte carlo simulation of these qcd processes will be required to assess the effectiveness of such approaches .",
    "( 160,55)(0,0 ) ( 0,0 )    ( 160,120)(0,0 ) ( 0,0 )    finally , we consider the fully leptonic decay modes .",
    "the only background subprocesses in this case are caused by the photon fusion diagrams of figures 4 ( a ) , ( b ) and ( c ) and by the qcd box diagram of figure 5 ( c ) .",
    "as we discuss above , the photon - induced contributions can be reduced in the high - mass region , where they become potentially large , by the proton transverse momentum cut @xmath71 mev . using the results of @xcite we find the qcd contribution from figure 5 ( c ) is very small , less than 1% of the signal .",
    "to summarise , the most problematic background contribution arises in the semi - leptonic case from the qcd diagrams shown in figures 5 ( a ) and ( b ) when the off - shell @xmath18 boson decays hadronically . at higgs masses above @xmath72 gev , photon - induced backgrounds from diagrams of the type shown in figure 4",
    "can be a problem , but can be suppressed if necessary by increasing the transverse momentum cut on the tagged protons to @xmath73 mev . as shown in tables 1 and 2 , this higher @xmath27 cut has little effect on the signal , but will further reduce the photon - induced backgrounds . for the fully leptonic decay modes , and for semi - leptonic decays",
    "in which the on - mass - shell @xmath18 boson decays hadronically , the signal to background ratio should be much greater than unity .",
    "we have not considered the @xmath74 decay channel here , because we expect the rate to be too low to be of interest .",
    "we have shown that , given the standard level 1 trigger thresholds at both atlas and cms , and installation of the proposed 220 m and 420 m proton tagging detectors , we expect the standard model higgs boson to be visible in the @xmath75 double tagged exclusive channel for @xmath6 gev @xmath76 gev with @xmath77  fb@xmath13 of lhc luminosity .",
    "for a 120 gev higgs in the @xmath17 channel , the event yield is marginal . for masses above 140 gev",
    ", we expect approximately 5 or 6 events , largely independent of higgs mass , of which 1 is expected to be in the ` gold plated ' doubly leptonic channel , with no appreciable background .",
    "these numbers would double if the trigger thresholds on single leptons could be reduced to @xmath78 gev , which may be possible by using other event characteristics such as the @xmath40 central jets from the hadronically decaying @xmath18 .",
    "when a di - jet @xmath18 mass window is applied , 2 or 3 events remain , with again no appreciable backgrounds . in the semi - leptonic channel ,",
    "there is a potentially dangerous background from central exclusive @xmath18 + jets processes below the 2-@xmath18 threshold , although we expect that this background may be manageable with carefully chosen experimental cuts .",
    "the largest loss of events is caused by the level 1 trigger efficiency , and we have made no attempt to optimise this here , although we expect that significant improvements will be possible .",
