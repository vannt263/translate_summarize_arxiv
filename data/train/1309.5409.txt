    "the theory of surface growth processes has by now reached a mature status that allows to describe statistically a wide variety of nonequilibrium phenomena in terms of universality classes of scaling regimes @xcite .",
    "as is known , these latter depend strongly on the conservation laws of the underlying dynamics , bringing about important effects at large times .",
    "an interesting example of this , introduced in the context of restricted solid - on - solid dimer growing interfaces @xcite , is the set of parity conserving ( pc ) processes @xcite . here , the seemingly microscopic variation of considering the dynamics of extended objects ( i.e. involving more than one interface location ) rather than that of monomers , has however far reaching implications , giving rise to an anomalous growth of the global roughness or interface width . in one - dimension ( 1d ) , where nonequilibrium roughening transitions can also take place @xcite ,",
    "this anomaly has been investigated in terms of even - visiting random walks @xcite . in that representation",
    "the height levels of the interface are thought of as the visited sites of a 1d brownian path extended on a given time interval , here playing the role of the substrate length @xmath0 .",
    "the constraint to cover each path location an even number of times ( or more generally , conserving this number modulo @xmath1 ) , introduces long - range temporal correlations @xcite which causes the interface to roughen as @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "this is in marked contrast to the usual root mean square displacement of normal ( diffusive ) random walks characterizing the asymptotic @xmath3 width of a variety of interfaces grown out of monomers @xcite , and typical of both 1d edwards - wilkinson ( ew ) @xcite and kardar - parisi - zhang ( kpz ) @xcite universality classes .",
    "also , roughening anomalies were reported in other growth models with similar global constraints including multiparticle correlations @xcite , self - flattening , and self - expanding surfaces @xcite .    in this work",
    "we examine further aspects of the pc processes referred to above focusing attention on more detailed levels of description , such as height difference correlation functions and width probability distributions . interestingly and in line with a variety of studies of several growth models",
    "@xcite , it will turn out that in approaching the stationary regime there is a single length scale , namely the usual average width , which characterizes these latter distributions in terms of a universal scaling function . here",
    "we follow an alternative description of pc interfaces @xcite using a simple extension of the well known 1d mapping between stochastic dynamics of binary lattice gases and body - centered solid - on - solid ( bcsos ) growth processes @xcite .",
    "there , the differences of adjacent pairs of height variables @xmath4 are restricted to @xmath5 , while as is shown in fig.[rules ] , attachment and detachment of dimers ( or @xmath6-mers in general ) , are viewed as exchanges of ising spins @xmath7 on three ( @xmath8 ) consecutive bonds .",
    "although the adsorbed particles do not diffuse explicitly neither in @xmath6-mer nor monomer form , they are allowed to rearrange throughout the interface by explicit dissociation of @xmath6-mers .",
    "this takes place under desorption attempts which may occur whether the @xmath6 targeted monomers were original adsorbing partners or not . in passing ,",
    "it is worth mentioning that this is also a typical feature of catalytic surface reactions where the reconstitution of composite objects actually does matter @xcite .",
    "the simplicity of these rules is deceptive as they entail a number of conservation laws which grows exponentially with the substrate size . at the root of this rather unusual partitioning of the phase space is a useful construction , namely the irreducible string , introduced by barma and dhar in closely related systems @xcite . we shall exploit this nonlocal construct , defined later on in sec .",
    "iia , using a simple numerical algorithm which enables an approach to the stationary behavior _ without _ actually evolving the system .",
    "to that aim , we must content ourselves with analyzing just the situation of equal deposition - evaporation rates .",
    "the idea , to become clear in a moment , is to concatenate parts of steady configurations of initially flat but small interfaces , such that the final assembly also bears the global constraint of an originally flat but much _ larger _ substrate .",
    "this approximation circumvents the problem of going through the slow subdiffusive dynamics characteristic of these processes @xcite thus permitting a thorough sampling of width distributions in scaling regimes , and which otherwise would be hard to examine by standard simulations . nonetheless , to probe simple features of our assembled interfaces under the actual dynamics , we shall also make use of those simulations in large but yet accessible scales . to complement this finite - size approach",
    "we also focus attention on dynamic exponents which , as is known @xcite , can be read off from the spectrum gaps of evolution operators .",
    "thus , we shall diagonalize these latter exactly in reachable dimensions . in line with what was mentioned before",
    ", these exponets will come out to be sub - diffusive and in close agreement with those obtained by the usual dynamic scaling of the interface width @xcite .",
    "-14.1 cm     ( @xmath9 ) at random locations having at least two consecutive height minima ( maxima ) .",
    "the corresponding spin-@xmath10 ( @xmath11 ) or hard core particle dynamics consists , respectively , of two simultaneous left ( right ) particle hoppings .",
    "the array between brackets illustrates an irreducible string ( see sec .",
    "iia ) . also , note that the identity of dimers is not necessarily maintained by subsequent evaporations.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=100.0% ] -7.75 cm    the layout of this work is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we recast the master equation of these processes in terms of a quantum spin hamiltonian through which we not only obtain dynamic exponents but also use to span the entire phase space of small substrates .",
    "following ref.@xcite to identify the conservation laws of this @xmath6-mer dynamics and utilizing the full configuration lists provided by the spanning , we then put forward our algorithm to sample rapidly the phase space of large interfaces . in sec .",
    "iii , at first we test this sampling method so as to retrieve known roughening exponents as well as steady state correlations of smaller systems .",
    "then we carry on with the evaluation of width distributions for which the onset of a universal scaling function is suggested .",
    "surprisingly , this later exhibits a longer tail than that of normal random - walk - like interfaces @xcite .",
    "section iv contains a concluding discussion along with brief remarks on open issues and possible extensions of this work .",
    "the stochastic dynamics of discrete markovian systems such as those referred to above , amounts to a generic prescription of transition probability rates @xmath12 between all possible configurations @xmath13 explored in time ( here taken as being continuous ) .",
    "therefore , the evolution of the probabilities @xmath14 to observe the system in one of these latter is controlled by a gain - loss relation known as the master equation @xcite , namely @xmath15.\\ ] ] conveniently , this relation can also be rewritten in the form of a schrdinger equation in an imaginary time , that is @xmath16 , thus permitting to derive the probability distribution @xmath17 at subsequent moments from the action of @xmath18 on a given initial condition , i.e. @xmath19 . here , the liouville or evolution operator @xmath18 embodying the dynamics is defined through its matrix elements @xmath20 which , due to conservation of probability , clearly constrain all @xmath18-columns to add up to zero . thereby it can be shown @xcite that the steady state corresponds to a unique @xmath18-eigenmode with eigenvalue @xmath21 , whereas the relaxation time of any observable is upper bounded by @xmath22 , with @xmath23 being the first excitation level of the @xmath18-spectrum .    in our case , for what follows",
    "it is helpful to think of this evolution operator as being applied to a space of @xmath10-spinors .",
    "for that , we interpret the slope configurations @xmath24 of fig.[rules ] as being already diagonal in the @xmath25-component , say , of pauli matrices @xmath26 assigned to each slope site . by construction it is then clear that up to a constant @xmath27 chosen as a reference level , the heights of the bcsos interface are obtained as @xmath28 in particular , note that under periodic boundary conditions ( pbc ) the dynamics is consistent with a vanishing total magnetization @xmath29 though as we shall see below , many further additional conservation laws also emerge .",
    "introducing now the right and left @xmath6-mer hopping operators @xmath30 @xmath31 associated respectively to the detachment and attachment processes described in fig.[rules ] , and taking into account the algebra of the spin-@xmath32 raising and lowering operators @xmath33 , we can readily write down the operational counterpart of eq.([elements ] ) , which here reduces to @xmath34 such simplicity is only apparent as the commutation algebra of the hopping operators complicates the analytical treatment ( except for monomers and @xmath35 , where @xmath18 reduces to the isotropic heisenberg ferromagnet ) . in this latter equation",
    "evidently each of the off - diagonal terms provide the appropriate transition elements of the dynamics , whereas the addition of its diagonal parts @xmath36 @xmath37 accounts for the number of manners @xmath38 in which a given spin configuration may access to other ones either by right or left jumps , i.e. @xmath39 thus complying with conservation of probability . on the other hand combining this with the microscopic reversibility of our model , here expressed simply as @xmath40 ( or @xmath41 ) @xmath42 ( or @xmath9 ) , we then obtain @xmath43 = \\left ( \\epsilon -   \\epsilon ' \\right)\\,\\left(\\,n^+_s - n^-_s \\right),\\ ] ] from which some brief remarks about the steady state distribution now follow . first , note that the monomer case is special in that for _ pbc _ ( hereafter considered throughout ) this latter identity always cancels out as for @xmath44 eq.([diagonal ] ) simplifies to @xmath45 .",
    "therefore , comparing eq.([identity ] ) with the right hand side of the master equation , we thus see that the monomer steady state , either in equilibrium or not ( @xmath46 ) , is consistent with a _ constant _ distribution @xcite .",
    "more generally however , and except for the equilibrium situation , this feature does _ not _ hold for @xmath1 because the diagonal @xmath47 operators of eq.([diagonal ] ) are now different , so in general @xmath48 .",
    "since the equiprobability issue is essential for the sampling algorithm that follows , this breakdown will restrict the numerical findings of sec .",
    "iii only to the case @xmath35 , yet being non - trivial for @xmath1 as we shall see below .      turning to conservation laws and assuming that the lattice @xmath49 is @xmath50-partite ( in 1@xmath51 just meaning @xmath0 multiple of @xmath50 )",
    ", the first invariant set of quantities one can readily identify from the composite spin exchanges of fig.[rules ] is that of the sublattice magnetization differences @xmath52 with @xmath53 . from these @xmath54 possible pairs only @xmath8 of them are independent , so the number of conservation laws would grow at most as @xmath55 . but as mentioned earlier , there is in fact a much subtler set of constants of motion , in turn growing exponentially with the lattice size .    to construct that set , here",
    "we briefly survey the ideas of ref.@xcite concerning the dynamics of deposition - evaporation of trimers reconstructing on a line , and which for what follows it is convenient to adapt to larger objects of even length , e.g. @xmath56 .",
    "clearly , those processes are then isomorphic to ours via a simple particle - hole mapping , say on even sublattices .",
    "thus , in analogy to ref.@xcite we now define the _ irreducible string _ ( is ) @xmath57 of any spin configuration as the sequence obtained by deleting all groups of @xmath50 consecutive anti - parallel spins appearing on chosen locations , and then repeating recursively the procedure on the resulting shorter string until no further of such groups remain . as an illustration ,",
    "consider for simplicity the following examples of @xmath58 @xmath59 in the first case this deletion , marked by boxes , is applied to a group of spins chosen either starting from the left or right . in the second instance",
    "the procedure is carried out recursively in two steps and no characters are left , while in the third example the string considered is already jammed ( same irreducible block of fig.[rules ] ) and can no further evolve .",
    "the invariance of the irreducible characters ( if any ) left by this process is in line with the idea that the successive action of the hopping operators of eq.([hopping ] ) on a given spin configuration , just changes the position of those characters by multiples of @xmath50 lattice spacings .",
    "the separations between them are mediated by substrings of different lengths ( @xmath60 ) , though all of these are in turn reducible to null strings .",
    "thus , the interface dynamics may be thought of as a random walk of hard - core irreducible characters ( they can not cross each other ) , as depicted schematically in fig.[walk ] .",
    "-9.3 cm   -5 cm    the positions of these walkers at a given instant of course depend on the order in which the reduction rule is applied , but the key issue to bear in mind here is that the sequence of irreducible charcaters remains unaltered throughout .",
    "in addition and as noted in ref.@xcite , two spin configurations @xmath61 are connected by the dynamics @xmath62 .",
    "thus , the is uniquely labels all subspaces left invariant by the @xmath6-mer kinetics , regardless in which order the reducible groups are removed . on the other hand , it is clear that the number of combinations forming these irreducible sequences grows exponentially with the number of characters or string length @xmath63 .",
    "more specifically , a straightforward analysis of a recursion relation for this length @xcite , shows that for large @xmath64 and @xmath65 the number of invariant subspaces increases as fast as @xmath66 , where @xmath67 is the largest root of @xmath68 .    on a more fundamental level",
    ", it would be interesting to identify the symmetries at the origin of these conservation laws .",
    "for instance , in the much simpler case of the sublattice differences of eq.([differences ] ) the symmetries responsible for them just involve @xmath69 rotation angles around the @xmath25 direction of each sublattice . recalling that under those rotations @xmath70 transform as @xmath71 , evidently as long as @xmath72 is held , the hopping operators of eq.([hopping ] ) will be left invariant , and so will @xmath18 in eq.([h ] ) .",
    "thus , from the infinitesimal generators @xmath73 of these @xmath74 independent rotations one is finally led to the conservation laws of eq.([differences ] ) , already obtained on more intuitive grounds .",
    "however in the case of the is and the exponential proliferation of constants of motion it entails , the analysis appears to be much more involved .",
    "due to the highly convoluted form in which the is is obtained , unlike eq.([differences ] ) it is neither clear how to construct its operational counterpart ( possibly non - local ) , nor to identify the corresponding symmetries in the evolution operator . despite that",
    "formal insufficiency , the invariance of the is provides an alternative computational tool to approach the equilibrium regime , and which we now implement .    -0.45",
    "cm @xmath75      notice that whenever @xmath76 is kept finite in the thermodynamic limit , the interface can not roughen at large times @xcite .",
    "this is because for @xmath35 the distances @xmath77 between irreducible characters ( or random walkers ) are distributed as @xmath78 @xcite .",
    "thus , mean square height fluctuations along those distances ( or reducible substrings , all with @xmath79 ) remain bounded as @xmath80 .",
    "so , hereafter we will focus on the null string subspace only .",
    "besides , it is the most natural to consider in the context of growing interfaces , as it stems from initially flat conditions ( plain antiferro states ) .",
    "although in equilibrium all configurations are equally weighted , yet the expectation value of most observables are not analytically simple to obtain because the ensemble of averaged states must be consistent not just with @xmath79 but also with a vanishing is .",
    "this introduces spatial correlations ( absent in the monomer case , where @xmath81 always coincides with @xmath64 ) , which develop slowly in the course of growth simulations . at large times",
    "however , such process ultimately amounts to producing a uniform distribution of null string states .",
    "here we put forward an approximation to such distribution in large scale substrates based on the construction of small ones .",
    "the idea is to assemble pieces of small substrates in such a way that by applying the above deletion rules the whole set is reducible to the null string .",
    "there are several forms to attempt this , but consider for instance a set of @xmath82 spin configurations ( sketched as the initial blocks of fig.[algorithm ] ) with a common length @xmath83 , and drawn randomly from a list of null string blocks previously prepared .",
    "this latter , in turn can be constructed from the repeated action of the hopping operators ( [ hopping ] ) on , say , initial antiferro    -0.37 cm .",
    "dashed lines denote random locations where an entire block is interposed . at each step",
    "the block size is doubled while complying with the null string constraint .",
    "eventually , parts of the original blocks can also be further splitted by random intercalations.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=56.4% ] -0.51 cm    states , until exhausting the full space ( typically growing exponentially with @xmath84 @xcite ) .",
    "at the first step , half of the drawn blocks are divided in two parts at random locations , while as depicted in fig.[algorithm ] , each of the remaining blocks are settled between the split pairs .",
    "thus , one is left with @xmath85 blocks of length @xmath86 all of which are evidently reducible to the null string [ e.g. see eq.([null ] ) ] .",
    "next , the process is recursed , eventually by splitting further parts of the original blocks , until a single block of length @xmath87 is obtained .",
    "the algorithm thus generates an ensemble of substrates which are fully reducible by successive reductions around a central @xmath84-block , always left unsplit .",
    "though uniform , this assembled distribution ( ad ) can _ not _ be entirely representative of the much larger substrate space , at most it just can be approximative . nevertheless , as it will be tested out in sec .",
    "iii , it does reproduce known features of the scaling regimes in which one is ultimately interested , while enabling to examine there width distributions otherwise difficult to reach .",
    "let us finally comment that had a simple concatenation of blocks been carried out it would have bounded all heights as @xmath88 , whereas on the other extreme , the use of more reduction centers neither would bring about a better approximation to the equilibrium regime .    -0.41",
    "before setting out this algorithm in width distributions , we first test it against typical scaling aspects of growing interfaces . in studying",
    "these latter one usually considers the mean square fluctuations of the average height @xmath89 , which provides a measure of the global interface width at a given instant , that is @xmath90 ^ 2 \\right\\rangle\\,.\\ ] ] here , the brackets denote an ensemble average over all possible evolutions of heights , in our case compatible with the null string imposed by flat initial conditions . based on a wide range of theoretical and numerical studies",
    ", it can be argued that @xmath91 should scale as @xcite @xmath92 with a universal scaling function behaving as @xmath93 for @xmath94 , while approaching a constant for @xmath95 .",
    "hence , for @xmath96 the width must grow as @xmath97 @xcite , until saturating as @xmath98 for times comparable or larger than the relaxation time @xmath99 . in the above hypothesis the hurst or roughening exponent @xmath100 measures the stationary dependence of the interface width on the typical substrate size , while the fundamental scaling between length and time is given by the dynamic exponent @xmath25 .",
    "-0.97 cm @xmath75      when it comes to this latter it is helpful to also consider the spectral gap @xmath101 of the evolution operator constructed in sec .",
    "ii , so as to obtain a separate evaluation ( independent of @xmath100 ) , and which we now briefly touch upon .",
    "assuming as usual the emergence of a finite - size scaling regime in which @xmath102 @xcite ,    -2.8 cm   in eq.([h ] ) ] for dimers ( squares ) , trimers ( triangles ) , and monomers ( circles , just for comparison ) . from top to bottom solid lines are fitted with slopes corresponding to dynamic exponents @xmath103 , and 2 , obtained in turn from the highest available approximants of eq.([approx ] ) .",
    "these are exhibited in the inset for @xmath104 and 3 using several lattice sizes ( @xmath105 . the horizontal line indicates the value of @xmath106 arising from fig.[scaling]b.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=52.6% ] -2.2 cm    we analyzed those exponents for @xmath35 and small substrates using a lanczos diagonalization @xcite of eq.([h ] ) within null string subspaces , in turn spanned via the hopping operators ( [ hopping ] ) as explained in sec .",
    "the results so obtained are displayed in fig.[gaps ] , where it is seen that already modest lengths are able to yield clear finite - size trends which evidence nonuniversal and subdiffusive slopes for dimers and trimers , i.e. @xmath107 2.61 and 2.89 respectively . in that regard ,",

    "the relative differences between our highest approximants are about 0.1% for @xmath110 , and 1.3% for @xmath111 , which in any case are far apart from the diffusive slope ( @xmath112 ) of the monomer case , only shown for comparison",
    ". it would be desirable to improve the convergence of the trimers @xmath25 s , but the next approximant ( @xmath113 ) requires to consider spaces of more than @xmath114 null string states which goes beyond our computing facilities .",

    "our @xmath100 value should _ not _ be regarded as a mere numerical deviation from the @xmath147 exponent conjectured in @xcite . at the origin of this departure",
    "is the exponential proliferation of irreducible strings appearing in the dimer dynamics which ultimately impose tighther restrictions than those already occurring in evrw .",
    "although both dynamics share the topological constraint caused by the mod 2 conservation of the number of particles at every height level , note that the bcsos version of evrw @xcite mixes up all the many - sector decomposition discussed in section iia .",
    "for instance , besides the dimer dynamics ref.@xcite also considers the full restoration of ergodicity by deposition - evaporation of two particles at two randomly chosen columns with equal heights .",
    "these need not to be contiguous ( as in the dimer dynamics ) , nor necessarily share the same terrace . that introduces a genuine one - to - one correspondence with the ensemble generated by the evrw dynamics , so the estimate of @xmath148 found there in such conditions is then in line with the theory of ref.@xcite .",
    "similarly , that latter work also investigates the effect of adding monomer diffusion within terraces .",
    "that produces another estimation which yields @xmath149 . but",
    "further to that difference , note that the explicit addition of monomer diffusion partially relaxes the broken ergodicity of the original dimer dynamics .",
    "hence , the above deviations of @xmath100 from @xmath147 should not be ascribed merely to statistical errors but mainly to the change of conservation laws .",
    "in fact , when restoring full ergodicity ref.@xcite yields a kpz type exponent @xmath150 which is far apart from the subdiffusive @xmath151 obtained in the original dimer dynamics of both refs.@xcite and @xcite as well as in this section .    turning to smaller scales and to further probe the ad , we finally compare the exact slope or spin correlations @xmath152 evaluated in the uniform distributions of our largest available blocks ( 36 heights for dimers and 48 for trimers ) , with those estimated in substrates assembled with _ smaller _ @xmath84 s .",
    "this is illustrated in the lower panels of fig.[growth ] where it is corroborated that in both cases these functions closely approximate each other . as mentioned earlier on , we thus see that even though the averaged distributions are uniform , the null string constraint enforces non - trivial correlations which otherwise would not appear by the sole restriction of @xmath79 ( as in the case of monomers , where all even correlators @xmath153 vanish identically as @xmath154 ) . noting that either eq.([width ] ) or ( [ diff - corr ] ) can also be expressed in terms of @xmath155",
    ", it follows that for @xmath1 these pair correlations are the ultimately responsible for the anomalous roughening of pc interfaces , as opposed to the case @xmath156 where these pairs ( @xmath157 ) have no effect .",
    "it is reassuring that both roughening exponents and correlations of fig.[growth ] , in conjunction with the near - saturated scaling regimes of fig.[scaling ] , all suggest strongly that the construction of section iib is sampling close - to - equilibrium states .",
    "thus , we carry on and further exploit that construction to compute the width distributions of pc interfaces .",
    "since the dynamic scaling hypothesis ( [ scalingw ] ) involves in fact an integral over all interface modes , it may well occur that corrections to scaling are needed . in our case , this is particularly noticeable at early stages of evolution where the data collapse in the lower sets of figs.[scaling]a and [ scaling]b is not so evident . in that sense , a variety of theoretical and numerical studies @xcite have suggested an alternative characterization of interfaces in terms of the full probability distribution @xmath158 of its particular random width realizations @xmath159 .",
    "so long as their average @xmath160 diverges in the thermodynamic limit , i.e. @xmath161 , the relevance of such distribution relies in that for large substrates it scales as @xcite @xmath162 where the scaling function @xmath163 is a _",
    "universal _ characteristic of the interface fluctuations . like @xmath100 however ,",
    "at large times this function can not point out dynamic aspects of universality classes .",
    "for example , since in 1d the steady sates grown out of @xmath156 are equiprobable and uncorrelated ( recall sec .",
    "ii ) , @xmath163 is the same for both ew ( @xmath164 ) and kpz ( @xmath165 ) universality classes @xcite .",
    "but in view of the role of null strings for @xmath1 , @xmath163 should be able to distinguish clearly the growth of pc interfaces from that of monomer ones .",
    "to that aim , note that the basic problem of sampling stationary @xmath159 under very slow relaxation ( @xmath166 ) inevitably arising in standard simulations , is to a large    -2 cm ) .",
    "squares and triangles stand for strings of @xmath58 assembled with @xmath167 and 24 using @xmath168 and 8 respectively . in turn ,",
    "circles and rhomboids denote @xmath169 strings stemming from blocks of @xmath170 and 30 , also recursed 10 and 8 times in each case . for comparison",
    ", the solid line refers to the @xmath44 distribution of ref.@xcite , whereas the dashed one is just a guide to the eye .",
    "the inset evidences a longer tail for @xmath1 , clearly decaying exponentially with @xmath171.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=59.8% ] -2.8 cm    extent bypassed by the close - to - equilibrium distributions of sec .",
    "iib . in turn",
    ", these also enable to sample sufficiently large lattices as otherwise there would be a rather small number of possible @xmath159 values coarse - graining the histogram of @xmath172 .",
    "thus , using substrates in the range of 6.000 to 50.000 heights , in fig.[distribution ] we display the scaled distributions obtained after dividing the data into @xmath173 intervals ( not all shown ) , and averaging over about @xmath174 samples .",
    "this rather extended sampling , facilitated through the algorithm of sec .",
    "iib , was necessary to capture the statistics of the rare events on the tail of the distribution given in the figure inset . as expected , in all cases the data collapse into a single scaling function easily discernible from the exact monomer result @xcite .",
    "( the collapse is better demonstrated within the scales of the inset where probabilities are much smaller ) .",
    "furthermore , @xmath163 appears to be the same for dimers and trimers , each stemming from dissimile types of assembled null strings , thus suggesting a universal function for equilibrium pc interfaces .",
    "in contrast to the scaling hypothesis ( [ scalingw ] ) , here note that there are no parameters to collapse the @xmath175 s , and no scaling properties of @xmath176 are used or assumed .",
    "the only approximation is the finite size of the systems investigated . in that regrad",
    ", other large substrates assembled with different @xmath84 s and @xmath132 s ( not displayed to avoid overcrowding ) yielded the same , numerically indistinguishable , functions .",
    "just as the monomer case , we see that the length scale @xmath177 not only characterizes the macroscopic level of the interface roughness [ eq.([scalingw ] ) and fig.[growth ] ] , but also emerges as the natural length of the whole width distribution . since @xmath178",
    ", one would intuitively presume that height fluctuations in pc interfaces are smaller than those in monomer ones .",
    "thus , on approaching the above length scale one would expect @xmath163 to become more peaked and narrower than the monomer @xmath175 , something which in fact occurs to some extent .",
    "however , on the same basis one would also expect the pc distribution to decay faster for large width realizations .",
    "surprisingly , however it turns out to be the other way around .",
    "this is illustrated in the inset of fig.[distribution ] where the semilog plot strongly suggests an exponential decay in the scaled variable @xmath179 rather than its squared , as occurring in the exact solution of @xmath156 @xcite .",
    "more specifically , the tails of these two distributions behave as @xmath180 with fitting parameters @xmath181 and @xmath182 .",
    "hence , we conclude that even though the average roughness of finite pc interfaces is significantly smaller ( @xmath139 ) their fluctuations can eventually explore larger widths .",
    "to summarize , we have presented an alternative approach to 1d parity conserving interfaces close to their equilibrium regimes ( @xmath35 ) .",
    "the notion of irreducible string @xcite , which partitions the dynamics into very many disjoint sectors of the configuration space , played an instrumental role in the implementation of the assembling algorithm put forth in sec .",
    "iib ( fig .",
    "[ algorithm ] ) .",
    "this latter was shown to provide a fair sampling of the almost saturated state , in turn exhibiting a scaling regime ( fig.[scaling ] ) controlled by the very same dynamic and roughening exponents obtained through the dynamic scaling hypothesis ( [ scalingw ] ) @xcite . without explicitly evolving the system in time , the assembled distribution also reproduced that latter exponent both at the macro scale of the average interface width ( main panels of fig.[growth ] ) , as well as at the micro level of the height difference correlations of eq.([diff - corr ] ) ( upper insets ) .",
    "the value of @xmath183 so obtained is also in excellent agreement with those resulting from simulations in previous studies @xcite and with restricted solid - on - solid versions of these interfaces @xcite .",
    "as for dynamic exponents , we diagonalized the evolution operator ( [ h ] ) within the accessible null string spaces already stored in assembling the above distributions , so as to analyze the size dependence of its spectral gap ( fig.[gaps ] ) .",
    "this provided an estimation of dynamic exponents via a sequence of finite - size approximants ( inset of fig.[gaps ] ) nearing subdiffusive but nonuniversal values , i.e. @xmath184 and 2.89 for dimers and trimers respectively , both in reasonable agreement with the exponents resulting from the scaling hypothesis ( [ scalingw ] ) .",
    "apart from avoiding the slow subdiffusive dynamics , perhaps the most interesting aspect of our assembling approach is that it also allows for a rich statistical analysis of the full width distribution of large scales .",
    "all assembled sizes yielded a single universal scaling function for both dimers and trimers ( fig.[distribution ] ) , in turn quite distinct from that of normal random - walk or monomer interfaces @xcite .",
    "this contributes to the list of already known scaling functions @xcite which concurrently with roughening exponents may be used to identify static universality classes of growth processes .",
    "the only length scale spontaneously emerging in those functions is the average interface width @xmath185 , which in the pc class results conspicuously smaller than in other classes .",
    "curiously , however , height fluctuations in this former turn out to build up in such a way that tails of width distributions decay much slower than those in monomer interfaces ( stretched exponential of eq.([tails ] ) and inset of fig.[distribution ] ) .    turning back to irreducible strings , note that in equilibrium the only one in which fluctuations diverge even in the thermodynamic limit is just the null string .",
    "all other ones containing a finite density @xmath186 of irreducible characters might be considered as non - critical strings . in",
    "that regard , fig.[walk ] is helpful to understand these latter as random sequences of null substrings of length @xmath77 ( distributed as @xmath187 @xcite ) , through which mean square height fluctuations can not but to remain bounded as @xmath188 .",
    "however note that as soon as @xmath46 , stationary probabilities immediately become nonuniform [ recall discussion below eq.([identity ] ) ] and this simple picture no longer holds .",
    "notwithstanding that the nonequilibrium dynamics is still partitioned by the same strings , it remains to figure out whether the current assembling approach , either for null or finite strings , could be extended to incorporate those nonuniform measures . because of these latter , nonequilibrium width distributions need no longer be related to the scaling function obtained here . finally , in @xmath189 where there is no analogue of irreducible string , all these issues either in equilibrium or not remain quite open .",
