    "clusters of galaxies mark the largest virialized structures in the universe , and their formation and evolution rates depend on cosmological parameters and the kinematics of the dark matter .",
    "the cluster mass function constrains the normalization of the matter power spectrum , typically expressed as @xmath2 , the root - mean - square ( rms ) mass fluctuation on a scale of 8 @xmath3mpc . as a result ,",
    "the number of clusters as a function of redshift provides a powerful constraint on both the expansion history of the universe and the gravitational growth of structure within it ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "both functions are strongly influenced by the matter content @xmath4 and the equation of state of the so - called `` dark energy '' that comprises most of the effective energy density in the universe .",
    "galaxy clusters also harbor a significant fraction of the visible baryons in the universe , in the form of a hot intracluster medium that leaves an imprint on the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) radiation though the sunyaev zeldovich effect ( sze ) @xcite . at frequencies below the sz null frequency around 218  ghz",
    ", clusters appear as small ( @xmath5mk ) decrements in the temperature of the cmb .",
    "selecting clusters through the strength of their sze signal has key advantages over other methods of selection : ( 1 ) it is relatively independent of redshift , ( 2 ) according to simulations , the sze flux ( @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the usual compton @xmath7-parameter ) should be cleanly related to the cluster mass with low scatter @xcite , and ( 3 ) according to simulations the sze signal is more robust to baryonic astrophysics ( cooling , agn feedback ) .",
    "thus an sze - selected sample could offer a reliable correlation with cluster mass , which is the key cosmological property , particularly at high redshift . however , optical and x - ray observations are crucial to confirm the sze detections and calibrate the @xmath8-mass relation predicted by simulations .",
    "the sze has been the focus of a considerable number of observational efforts over the past three decades .",
    "some of the earliest convincing measurements were made by @xcite observing at 20  ghz on the 40-m telescope of the owens valley radio observatory .",
    "each individual cluster detection required many hours of telescope time , typically spread out over several years . by the late 1990 s",
    "there were still only a dozen or so clusters for which reliable detections had been published ( see the review by * ? ? ?",
    "large - area cosmological sze surveys have only now become a reality , thanks to the development of mm - band cameras composed of arrays of order a thousand bolometers located at the focus of large - diameter telescopes ( 6 to 10 m ) offering diffraction - limited imaging at arcminute resolution ( a factor of five finer than the _ planck _ satellite ) .",
    "two such experiments , the atacama cosmology telescope ( act , * ? ? ? * ) and the south pole telescope ( spt , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) have surveyed hundreds of square degrees of the southern sky at arcminute resolutions and are reporting the first cluster detections @xcite .",
    "act is conducting a wide - area mm - band survey at arcminute resolution with @xmath930 @xmath10k  s@xmath11 array sensitivity to efficiently search for massive galaxy clusters using the sze .",
    "the first act sze clusters detected in the 2008 observation season are reported in @xcite and the first analysis of the act 148  ghz cmb power spectrum reaching to arcminute scales is presented in @xcite .",
    "this paper introduces the first sample of optically - confirmed sze clusters from the act 2008 148  ghz data ( see * ? ? ?",

    "subsequently , during the 2009b semester , we imaged candidates in the bands @xmath14 , @xmath15 , and @xmath16 on 4-m class telescopes to confirm the presence of a brightest cluster galaxy ( bcg ) and an accompanying red sequence of cluster members .    in two companion papers we describe in detail the sze cluster selection from the act data ( marriage et  al .  2010 ) and",

    "the reported magnitudes are always in the ab system .",

    "utilizing these cluster samples to constrain cosmology and cluster physics requires empirical characterization of the sze selection function .    as the first step in this process we measure the `` purity '' of the act sample , i.e. , the fraction of real clusters as a function of the sze detection significance , using a signal - to - noise limited sample of cluster candidates extracted from the 148  ghz maps .",
    "we search for an optical cluster associated with each candidate s sze decrement .",
    "this is relatively straightforward , since for a wide range of mass limits in a @xmath25cdm cosmology 90% of clusters will lie below @xmath26 and are therefore accessible in modest exposures on 4-m class telescopes . to illustrate this point , in figure  [ fig : nc ] we show the expected number of clusters of galaxies more massive than @xmath27 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 as a function of redshift from the mass function of @xcite .",
    "this range in mass limit covers the current relevant range for act .",
    "a key requirement of our observing plan is efficient multi - band optical imaging of act cluster candidates .",
    "unfortunately , the current generation of large and wide format ccd mosaic cameras are not ideally suited for this task as their long read - out times ( typically between @xmath28  s ) often become comparable to the required exposure times to find @xmath29 ( the characteristic @xcite luminosity ) ellipticals at @xmath30 , resulting in significant time overheads . for our observations",
    ", we decided instead to trade the large field - of - view for smaller but faster readout ccd cameras ( around 10  s ) that allow us to move rapidly from target to target and secure multi - band imaging for the central @xmath31 of the clusters , sufficient for the identification process because of the accurate astrometry of the mm - band data ( see below ) .",
    "the number of nights required for this measurement is set by several factors , but the basic requirement is unambiguously detecting all optical clusters out to a redshift of @xmath26 ( as shown in figure  [ fig : nc ] ) , where we can detect a high fraction ( @xmath990% ) of _ all _ massive clusters even for a conservative mass threshold of @xmath32 .",
    "the optical cluster detection requires seeing a cluster red sequence ( i.e. , early - type galaxies with luminosities less than @xmath29 ) .",
    "our exposure times are therefore determined by the observed @xmath33band magnitudes of low - luminosity ( @xmath34 ) red - sequence galaxies at @xmath35 , so that we can confidently identify clusters using the overdensity of red galaxies .",
    "in addition to being dominated by a red sequence of galaxies , massive clusters exhibit another distinctive signature , the presence of a bcg ( typically with luminosity of a few @xmath29 ) .",
    "our observation plan is hence designed to detect both of these features of real clusters ( bcg and red - sequence ) for 90% of the sze candidates ( i.e. , @xmath36 ) . for most of the remaining clusters at @xmath37 (",
    "estimated to be only 10% of the total number ) we will be able to detect the presence of a bcg as well as some of the brightest cluster members .",

    "an important conclusion of this analysis is that within our high snr sample ( @xmath595.7 ) , which was fully observed , we report no clusters above a redshift of 1.1 . as we show next , this distribution is fully consistent with expectations of @xmath25cdm which are based on gaussian fluctuations in the primordial matter density distribution .",

    "the full sample of 23 is well characterized by a mass threshold of @xmath190 and the 10 highest significance clusters , where all act sz candidate clusters were optically confirmed , are consistent with a mass threshold of @xmath1 .",

    "therefore the mass threshold values quoted here can be considered strong upper limits .          beyond the reported sample of 23 clusters ( table  [ tab : clusters ] ) , there are in addition three sze cluster candidates ( not reported ) at relatively high snr ( @xmath595.1 ) for which we do not find an optical counterpart using the procedure described above",

    "this value is consistent with the average surface density of galaxies at @xmath30 and additionally is far below the typical observed richness of the confirmed clusters ( @xmath9 60 members ) in the optical .",
