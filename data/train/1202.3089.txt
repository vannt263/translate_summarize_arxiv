    "gamma ray bursts ( grbs ) are the most luminous events in the universe , predominantly observed in the hard x - ray to gamma ray energies .",
    "an individual grb appears as a flash of gamma ray event lasting for seconds and then continuously shifts towards the lower energy bands  all the way to radio wavelength ( see for example , mszros 2006 ) . in the initial phase of high energy emission , known as the prompt emission , it undergoes significant spectral evolution . over the years , researchers have developed empirical models to describe the time - integrated spectrum , the light curve and the spectral evolution .",
    "it has been shown that various model parameters correlate with the energy related physical parameters of the full grb .",
    "for example , the parameter peak energy of the @xmath4 spectra ( @xmath3 ) correlates with the isotropic energy ( @xmath1 ) ( amati et al .",
    "2002 ) , isotropic peak luminosity ( @xmath5 ) ( schaefer 2003 ; yonetoku et al .",
    "2004 ) , and collimation - corrected energy ( @xmath6 ) ( ghirlanda et al . 2004 ) .",
    "similar correlations hold in the time domain e.g. , spectral delay ( @xmath7 ) - @xmath5 ( norris , marani & bonnell 2000 ) , variability ( v ) - @xmath5 ( fenimore & ramirez - ruiz 2000 ) and rise time ( @xmath8 ) - @xmath5 ( schaefer 2007 ) . the objective of such correlation studies is two - fold .",
    "firstly , to use grb as a standard candle of cosmology , alongside the commonly used standard candle  supernova . secondly , to understand the grb physics itself .",
    "grb can be observed at a much higher redshift ( as high as z @xmath9 6 ) than supernova ( z @xmath10 1.7 ) . with the advent of the fermi satellite",
    "we now have the record holder ",
    "grb 090423 ( z = 8.2 ; see ghirlanda et al .",
    "2010 ) . in spite of this tremendous advantage over the supernova",
    ", grb has one serious drawback . unlike the supernova",
    ", whose mechanism is very well understood and supported by numerous observations , the physics of grb is not understood properly .",
    "hence , it is interesting to investigate empirical models which can predict the correct energetics of grb .",
    "the predictions of theoretical model should conform to that of a data driven empirical model and this whole process gives a strong constraint on the possible physics of grb .",
    "pulse analysis of grb prompt emission has received considerable attention in recent times .",
    "it has the potential to unravel physical processes responsible for the observed correlations and help in standardizing the energy budget so that grbs can be used as precise cosmological distance indicators ( hakkila 2009 ) . in the prompt emission phase ,",
    "a grb varies vastly in time and energy domains , so much so that no two bursts have the same temporal and spectral characteristics ( norris et al .",
    "this situation simplifies if the whole grb event is considered as an ensemble of temporally separated pulses of self similar shapes ( nemiroff 2000 ) , generated nearly simultaneously in a wide range of energy bands ( norris et al .",
    "hence , each of the pulses can be modelled separately and then the whole grb event can be reproduced by shifting and adding these pulses .",
    "one of the strongest constraint the pulse analysis gives is that the pulses of a grb , despite having separate set of parameters and different energetics , have the same redshift .",
    "hence , each pulse can be used as a distance indicator and must conform with each other .",
    "it has been shown that all the correlations studied for the full grb event hold good , sometimes even better , if the inherent pulse property of grb is taken into account .",
    "krimm et al .",
    "( 2009 ) , for example , showed that the @xmath3 - @xmath1 correlation derived from pulse - wise analysis is consistent with the time - integrated analysis .",
    "hakkila et al .",
    "( 2008 ) studied @xmath7 - @xmath5 correlation and conclusively showed that the spectral lags are pulse properties rather than burst properties .",
    "these kind of correlations are , however , empirical in nature , and may not have any physical significance ( band & preece 2005 ; butler et al . 2007 ; 2009 ) .",
    "moreover , they do not use the full information available in the sense that the spectral and timing parameters are considered independent of each other . in such correlation studies ,",
    "the information of time evolution of the spectral parameters and the energy dependence of the timing parameters are lost .",
    "hence , the derived spectral and timing parameters are average quantities .",
    "liang & kargatis ( 1996 ) showed that one of the spectral parameters , namely @xmath3 , follows a time evolution law .",
    "kocevski & liang ( 2003 ) used this interdependence to study the evolution of @xmath3 , and found that @xmath3 exponentially decreases with the fluence of an individual pulse in a grb .",
    "recently , basak & rao ( 2012 ) have developed a new method for the complete empirical description of the individual pulses of grb prompt emission , simultaneously in the time and energy domains , based on well established empirical formulae .",
    "the method conclusively shows that the two new parameters of the liang & kargatis ( 1996 ) model , namely , the peak energy at zero fluence ( @xmath0 ) and the characteristic fluence ( @xmath11 ) , can be used to predict the timing parameters , namely , spectral delay and width . in other words ,",
    "these two parameters are more intrinsic to the grb pulses than the average spectral and timing parameters , and the other pulse characteristics can be derived from them . in this paper",
    "we demonstrate that the pulse - wise analysis gives a better correlation than both the time - integrated analysis and time - resolved analysis , which do not take broad pulses into account .",
    "we also show that @xmath0 , instead of @xmath3 , gives even better correlation , and it is the correct choice of parameter in correlation studies .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows . in ",
    "2 we briefly describe the method and in  3 we give the data analysis and results .",
    "major conclusions are discussed in  4 .",
    "pulse analysis of grb essentially involves extracting the constituent substructures based on various empirical time description of pulses ( norris et al .",
    "1996 ; nemiroff et al . 2000 ; hakkila et al . 2009 ; 2011 ) , e.g. , the fast rise exponential decay model ( fred ; kocevski 2003 ) , the norris model ( norris et al . 2005 ) .",
    "though this method is useful in extracting isolated and slightly overlapping pulses , it can not be used to extract `` heavily - overlapping '' and low signal - to - noise pulses at present ( hakkila et al .",
    "the energy spectrum of a grb is popularly described by an empirical model given by band et al .",
    "the same model can also be used for the individual pulses .",
    "choosing norris model for the time domain and the band model for the energy domain , and employing the time evolution of the peak energy ( @xmath3 ) of band model , as proposed by liang & kargatis ( 1996 ) , basak & rao ( 2012 ) developed a technique to determine the model parameters ( @xmath0 and @xmath11 ) .",
    "basak & rao ( 2012 ) analyzed the swift / bat and fermi / gbm data of the brightest grb in the fermi era ",
    "grb 090618 .",
    "they measured the global parameters of the individual pulses of this grb , namely , the low energy photon index ( @xmath12 ) , high energy photon index ( @xmath13 ) using the band model ( band et al .",
    "1993 ) for the time - integrated spectral data , and the characteristic time scales ( @xmath14 and @xmath15 ) by fitting the energy - integrated light curve with the norris model ( norris et al . 2005 ) .",
    "these global parameters were then used to generate the xspec table model with the parameters @xmath0 and @xmath11 as variables . from spectral fitting in xspec , @xmath0 and @xmath11 were determined .    the data analysis for the global parameters ( see basak & rao 2012 ) showed improvement due to the inclusion of the swift / bat along with the fermi / gbm .",
    "the simultaneous spectral fitting , however , showed some systematic errors in the overlapping energy regions .",
    "hence , they used only swift / bat data for the simultaneous timing and spectral description of the grb pulses .",
    "the typical value of the peak energy ( @xmath3 ) of grbs ( and the individual pulses ) is @xmath16 300 kev , and we expect still higher values of the parameter , @xmath0 . the swift / bat energy range ( 15 - 150 kev ; barthelmy et al .",
    "2005 ) is inadequate for accurate measurement of these parameters in many occasions .",
    "hence , the derived values by basak and rao ( 2012 ) showed large uncertainties ( typically 50  100 kev ) .",
    "gbm onboard the fermi satellite provides an unprecedented energy range ( @xmath168 kev to @xmath1640 mev ) with adequate sensitivity ( meegan 2009 ; meegan et al .",
    "2009 ) for constraining the values of @xmath3 and @xmath0 .",
    "hence , in the present analysis , we have used fermi / gbm data .",
    "also , we have carefully chosen the time interval of each pulse avoiding contamination from the other pulses .",
    "for example , in grb 090618 ( see table 1 ) , we have chosen time intervals 61 - 76 , 76 - 95 and 106 - 126 seconds for the pulses 2 , 3 and 4 respectively ( compared with the time divisions of basak & rao ( 2012 ) : 50 - 77 , 77 - 100 and 100 - 130 seconds , respectively ) .",
    "we have included the precursor burst of this grb ( pulse 1 ) in the present analysis .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "it is long debated that the correlation such as @xmath3 - @xmath1 might be a result of observational selection effects . in particular ,",
    "the @xmath3 values are stretched due to the multiplication factor ( 1+z ) making the correlation look better ( nakar and piran 2005 ; band and preece 2005 ; butler et al .",
    "2007 , 2009 ; shahmoradi and nemiroff 2009 ) .",
    "but , there are other researchers who argue in favour of the reality of these correlations ( ghirlanda et al . 2008 ; nava et al .",
    "2008 ; krimm et al .",
    "2009 ; amati et al . 2009 ; ghirlanda et al . 2010 ) .",
    "if these correlations hold within a grb as for a sample of many grbs , then we can conclude that the correlations are indeed physical .",
    "in figure 2 , we have marked the data points for grb 090424 ( stars ) and grb 090618 ( filled triangle ) for which we analyze the highest number ( four ) of pulses .",
    "the data shows that the pulses of the same grb follow the same @xmath0 - @xmath1 correlation .",
    "also , the fact that this correlation is tighter than @xmath3 - @xmath1 correlation signifies that @xmath0 is more intrinsic of a grb pulse than @xmath3 and hence this parameter should be used for such correlation studies .",
    "it is interesting to note that the pre - cursor of the grb 0901618 also follows the same correlation .",
    "the grb 090328 is also marked ( filled squares ) .",
    "first two pulses of this grb ( with higher @xmath0 values ) show particularly high deviation .",
    "an examination of the @xmath3 - @xmath1 values of these two pulses ( figure 1 ) also shows a much higher deviation .",
    "interestingly , the third pulse of this grb is consistent with the trend .",
    "it is known earlier that the first pulses of grbs tend to be harder and thus deviate from the correlation ( krimm et al .",
    "2009 , ghirlanda et al . 2010 ) .",
    "but , this deviation is much less compared to the pulse - wise @xmath3 in the @xmath3 - @xmath1 correlation .",
    "the strong correlation between the luminosity and the parameter obtained from a joint spectral and timing fit for the individual pulses of grbs clearly indicates that the basic radiation/ emission process is similar in diverse grbs and the dispersion in the other parameters like lorentz factor , beaming angle etc .",
    "are quite minimal .",
    "an examination of the data in table 1 and figure 2 shows that the dispersion in the correlation for different pulses of a grb is of the same magnitude as the dispersion between grbs .",
    "hence it is worthwhile to investigate the radiation/ emission process in operation by making a direct model fit to the data .",
    "this would help us finding the fundamental parameter/ variable responsible for the correlation .",
    "if such an exercise brings down the dispersion in the relation , it may be possible to use grbs as a distance indicator for cosmological purposes .",
    "it is also interesting to note that the parameters derived for the `` pre - cursor '' in grb  090618 , is consistent with the global correlation .",
    "asano & meszaros ( 2011 ) have done simulations of the spectral and temporal evolution of gamma - ray bursts using internal dissipation models and have concluded that the models reproduce the band spectra and also the generic time evolution .",
    "dado et al .",
    "( 2007 ) have used the master formula based on the `` cannonball '' model and have explained the various correlations observed for the prompt emission of the grbs .",
    "the present work demonstrates that it is possible to fit the data with a comprehensive set of formulae describing the temporal and spectral evolution of the bursts .",
    "hence , it should be possible to directly fit the data with the model predictions and derive the fundamental quantities responsible for the universal correlation .",
    "any model contains basic physical assumptions along with other details .",
    "a direct fit to the data taking individual pulses should segregate the basics from the details .",
    "for example , in the `` cannonball '' model ( dado et al .",
    "2007 ) the lorentz factor and the viewing angle of a grb determine most of the properties of a grb pulse . since the viewing angle would be the same for the different pulses of a given grb , a direct fit to the spectral and temporal profile can have the additional constraint of the constancy of this parameter .",
    "further improvements for the method described here ( also see basak & rao ( 2012 ) ) could be made by iteratively including color corrections to the light curve and also re - confirming the @xmath3 evolution formula .",
    "it would also be interesting to repeat this exercise for short grbs and x - ray flares , which will give further clues to the emission mechanisms responsible for the correlation presented here .",
    "the choice of isotropic energy ( @xmath1 ) over the other two physical quantities , namely , the isotropic peak luminosity ( @xmath5 ) and collimation - corrected energy ( @xmath6 ) can be justified as follows .",
    "peak luminosity is measured based on the assumption that the spectral shape at the peak is the same as the average shape , which is not very physical ( wang et al .",
    "2011 ) . on the other hand , @xmath6 could have been a better choice , as collimation effect is corrected",
    "though , in practice the beaming angle ( @xmath17 ) is very ill determined ( e.g. , see the weak constraints in the measured @xmath17 by goldstein et al .",
    "it is evident from table 2 that the intrinsic scatter does not improve in the new analysis .",
    "this might happen due to some inherent assumptions of our model , crucially the hard - to - soft evolution and/or the uncertainty in the measured redshift .",
    "a close inspection of figure 2 reveals that the pulses of the same grb are scattered on the same side of the correlation line .",
    "this might be due to the fact that the correct energy budget is the collimation corrected energy and not the isotropic energy .",
    "analysis of 14 pulses of 6 grbs ( for which @xmath17 values could be collected ) shows a correlation of 0.91 .",
    "we believe that this correlation might improve with increasing accuracy of the measured @xmath17 .    to summarize ,",
    "we have used the method of joint timing and spectral description of grb pulses and found that @xmath0 is a fundamental parameter in the pulse description .",
    "this research has made use of data obtained through the heasarc online service , provided by the nasa / gsfc , in support of nasa high energy astrophysics programs .",
    "we are greatly thankful to the referee for the valuable suggestions in many places which improved the readability of the paper ."
