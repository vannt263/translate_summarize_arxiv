    "fluid phase transitions can be drastically changed by confinement in small pores .",
    "helium has a rich phase diagram and well - understood bulk behavior and is an ideal system in which to study these changes .",
    "silica aerogels , with their tenuous structure and extraordinarily low densities , provide a unique opportunity to introduce impurities in a controllable way and so to address fundamental questions about how disorder , finite size effects and surfaces affect phase transitions and critical behavior .",
    "recent work on the helium / aerogel system has provided insights into the role of disorder in a wide range of phase transitions . for example , the lambda transition for @xmath0he in aerogels  @xcite remains sharp , but with a non - bulk critical exponent for superfluid density , while for @xmath1he aerogels suppress or even completely eliminate superfluidity  @xcite , resulting in a zero temperature `` quantum phase transition . '' for @xmath1he-@xmath0he mixtures , the presence of 2% or even 0.5% silica ( i.e. aerogels with porosity of 98% or 99.5% ) has dramatic effects  @xcite on the entire phase diagram , causing the phase separation curve to detach from the lambda line and stabilizing a region of dilute @xmath0he superfluid inaccessible in bulk mixtures .",
    "the range of effects aerogels have on the various transitions reflects differences in their correlation lengths and in how the order parameter couples to the aerogels . in superfluid",
    "@xmath0he , the correlation length is very small and only approaches that of the aerogel structure very close to the lambda point .",
    "the correlation length in superfluid @xmath1he is much larger , comparable to aerogel length scales at all temperatures . in @xmath1he-@xmath0he mixtures , the aerogel strands couple directly to the order parameter ( @xmath1he concentration ) , in contrast to the much weaker coupling to the superfluid order parameters in @xmath1he and @xmath0he .",
    "the liquid - vapor phase transition in porous media has considerable fundamental and practical interest .",
    "it is often described within the framework of capillary condensation since , in geometries like pores or channels , fluids tend to condense more readily than in bulk .",
    "that is , liquid forms at pressures lower than the bulk saturated vapor pressure .",
    "this behavior is usually described by taking into account the energetics of liquid - vapor and liquid - solid interfaces ( i.e. surface tension ) and the depression of condensation pressure is fairly well - described by the kelvin equation , even in very small pores  @xcite .",
    "capillary condensation is characterized by very deep metastable states during adsorption and desorption , which leads to hysteresis along adsorption isotherms .",
    "although extracting pore size distributions for real porous media requires simplifying assumptions , the fundamental aspects of capillary condensation are well explained .",
    "however , near the liquid - vapor critical point ( lvcp ) this picture breaks down .",
    "thermal fluctuations grow from atomic to macroscopic scale as the lvcp is approached and many thermodynamic properties diverge ( e.g. the liquid - vapor interface thickness ) or tend to zero ( e.g. the surface tension ) .",
    "close to the critical point , density fluctuations might exceed the size of the pores , raising the question of how the critical behavior responds to confinement . in bulk fluids",
    ", the liquid - vapor transition falls into the ising universality class and degennes  @xcite suggested that fluids in porous media may provide a realization of the random field ising model ( rfim ) .",
    "however , most measurements in pores and gels show slow dynamics  @xcite , metastability and hysteresis and this complicated behavior makes it difficult to compare directly to theories of phase transitions in disordered media .",
    "experimental work on capillary condensation of near - critical fluids includes dense porous glasses such as cpg ( controlled pore glass )  @xcite .",
    "these studies show a slight narrowing in the phase separation curve , with the `` vapor '' branch shifted to higher densities than in the bulk fluid .",
    "in addition , the termination of this curve , sometimes referred to as the `` capillary critical point , '' is shifted to a temperature below the bulk lvcp . despite the relatively well defined pore geometries of these systems there is no general agreement about how to picture these systems near the lvcp .",
    "aerogels provide an opportunity to study this transition in a very different medium , one without a well - defined pore shape . with their tenuous network of silica strands",
    ", it is hard to imagine a liquid - vapor meniscus with the uniform negative curvature usually associated with capillary condensation . on the other hand , aerogels could be the ideal system in which to study liquid - vapor critical behavior in the dilute impurity limit .",
    "however , a recent direct measurement of density fluctuations in carbon dioxide confined in aerogel  @xcite showed little evidence for a diverging correlation length at the lvcp and thermal fluctuations may be less important than those introduced by the disorder in the aerogel structure  @xcite .",
    "the first liquid - vapor experiments involving aerogels  @xcite showed a reduced critical temperature for @xmath0he in a 95% porosity sample and a coexistence region which was dramatically narrowed ( by a factor of ten ) . below the critical point , isotherms appeared to have discontinuous density jumps between vapor and liquid - like phases and no hysteresis was observed . the surprisingly narrow coexistence curve , determined from heat capacity and isotherm measurements , could be fit using the bulk critical exponent .",
    "measurements with n@xmath2  @xcite showed slow dynamic behavior ( in density fluctuations in light scattering ) and a coexistence curve that was also narrower than for bulk ( although substantially broader than for @xmath0he ) .",
    "more recently , a low frequency mechanical pendulum technique was used to measure adsorption isotherms and study  @xcite the liquid - vapor behavior of @xmath0he in a similar aerogel .",
    "the measurements were affected by very long thermal response times but showed finite isotherm slopes and hysteresis between filling and emptying , even near the critical point .",
    "the behavior was reminiscent of capillary condensation , rather than equilibrium coexistence and critical behavior .",
    "our preliminary ultrasonic , acoustic resonator and isotherm measurements  @xcite on neon and helium in aerogels also showed hysteresis and our phase separation curves were narrower than in bulk fluids , but substantially broader than the @xmath0he curve in ref .  .",
    "recently , computer models of fluid adsorption in aerogel have also reached a level of realism which allows direct comparison between experimental and simulated adsorption isotherms  @xcite .",
    "these simulations were made using a lattice - gas model , with the aerogel structure produced by a diffusion - limited cluster - cluster aggregation algorithm .",
    "the use of the lattice - gas model allows the very large simulation volumes necessary for investigating low density aerogels .",
    "the simulations favor an interpretation without a macroscopic equilibrium phase transition near the bulk critical point and provide a picture of the liquid - vapor interface during adsorption in aerogel .",
    "the simulations show an interface with a range of curvatures , which becomes less distinct as the temperature is raised .",
    "the liquid - vapor phase transition has not been systematically experimentally studied around the lvcp . while adsorption isotherms of low density aerogels at temperatures far below the lvcp have shown how the isotherm shape changes with porosity  @xcite , data near the lvcp are restricted to a single porosity ( namely 95% ) .",
    "how hysteresis in the adsorption isotherms disappears as the temperature is raised has not been quantitatively studied for fluids in aerogel , and raises interesting questions about the effects of impurities on liquid - vapor critical behavior .",
    "the existence of equilibrium liquid - vapor transition for fluids in low density aerogels , necessary for there to be true critical behavior , is an open question . while there is little evidence for liquid - vapor critical behavior in denser media , as the concentration of impurities ( i.e.  aerogel density )",
    "is reduced this critical behavior may resurface .    in this paper",
    ", we describe a series of experiments on the isothermal adsorption and desorption of helium in silica aerogels of different densities .",
    "the aerogels were surrounded by bulk helium , but we used a capacitive measurement technique which allowed us to probe the helium density inside the aerogel directly .",
    "we controlled and varied the pressure , and thus the chemical potential , rather than admitting fixed amounts of helium .",
    "thermal equilibration within aerogels was exceptionally slow ; their tenuous microstructure suppressed convection and conducted heat very poorly .",
    "this slow equilibration was controlled by the heat of adsorption when fluid is added to ( or removed from ) the gel .",
    "pressures equilibrated rapidly due to the aerogels large permeability , but the heat of adsorption produced a temperature gradient which kept the fluid density within the gel from equilibrating until this heat had been conducted through the sample .",
    "we minimized equilibration times by cutting our samples as thinly as possible ( less than 0.5 mm ) , but the system could still take hours to equilibrate after a pressure step . since there was no way to avoid this slow equilibration in monolithic aerogels , we monitored the pressure , bulk helium density and helium density inside the aerogel and waited at each point until all had stabilized .",
    "we then made detailed measurements to see how the isotherm shapes and hysteresis depended on aerogel density and how they evolved with temperature near the lvcp .",
    "our results show that hysteresis in adsorption isotherms persists to temperatures very close to the lvcp , and there is no sign of an equilibrium liquid - vapor transition once the hysteresis disappears . with aerogel samples with porosities between 95% and 98% , and isotherms taken at temperatures from 4.880k to helium s bulk critical point at 5.195k , we are able to analyze the evolution of adsorption isotherms with temperature and aerogel density",
    ". the shapes of our isotherms agree with simulation studies  @xcite , and recent experimental  @xcite work , but show no signs of the surprisingly narrow coexistence region  @xcite seen in the first study published on helium condensation on aerogel .",
    "adsorption isotherms were collected for helium condensation in several aerogel samples .",
    "the two samples studied in detail had densities of @xmath3 and @xmath4 corresponding to porosities of 95% and slightly less than 98% respectively ; throughout this paper they are referred to as aerogels `` b110 '' and `` b51 . ''",
    "these aerogel samples were synthesized in our lab from tmos using the standard one - step base catalyzed method followed by supercritical extraction of the methanol solvent@xcite .",
    "sample b51 was the lowest density sample that we could reliably get to gel using the one - step process  to go to lower densities ( and thus higher porosities ) one must use a two - step synthesis procedure@xcite .",
    "data from a third sample , designated `` u90 , '' are not presented in detail here since the aerogel was not made in our laboratory and its synthesis conditions are unknown .",
    "its physical appearance resembled that of our other two samples , and it had a density of @xmath5 .",
    "the aerogel samples were @xmath6 mm thick discs cut from monolithic aerogel cylinders about 12 mm in diameter and @xmath7 cm long .",
    "because of the highly fragile nature of aerogels , great care had to be taken at all points to minimize any forces on the discs .",
    "copper films were then deposited directly onto both faces of the aerogel discs by thermal evaporation through a 9 mm diameter mask ( deposited at 0.30.4 nm / sec to a thickness of @xmath8 nm , as determined by quartz crystal thickness monitor ) .",
    "empirically , metal did not seem to penetrate significantly into the aerogel and the copper film did not plug the pores as it would for a denser porous medium .",
    "the metal film acted as a continuous electrode , confirmed by electrical conductivity measurements . by patterning the electrodes directly onto to aerogel we ensured that any bulk fluid in the experimental cell could only influence our measurements through the capacitor s fringe fields ; it could not intrude directly between the capacitor plates .",
    "the samples acted as parallel plate capacitors , but included significant effects from fringe fields ( electric field lines which project from the edges of the capacitor ) through the bulk helium in the cell .",
    "since the measured capacitance depended on the details of all the electric field lines , it was affected by the environment outside as well as that inside the aerogel .",
    "this effect was clearly seen in the experiment  for a slice of aerogel of our dimensions , fringe fields caused the capacitance to deviate from the ideal infinite parallel plate capacitance by about 10% .",
    "the aerogel capacitors were also modelled using an electrostatic modelling program 2d , '' ansoft corporation ] .",
    "the model calculations reproduced the magnitude of the fringe field effect seen experimentally  @xcite .",
    "there were three distinct modules to the cell , each with a single measurement function  a central piece and two endcaps .",
    "the center included a capacitive pressure gauge and an inlet capillary through which fluid could be admitted .",
    "one endcap measured bulk fluid density using a coaxial cylindrical capacitor with the bulk fluid acting as a dielectric between the plates .",
    "the other endcap was used to hold the aerogel sample for measurements of fluid density within the gel .",
    "details of the experimental setup can be found in ref .  .",
    "the aerogel lay in a shallow copper cup which made contact with the bottom electrode on the aerogel slice and was electrically connected to an isolated feed - through soldered into the cell .",
    "contact to the top electrode was made by a patch of fine metal mesh  the patch acted as a very weak spring , holding the slice in place while ensuring good electrical contact to another feed - through .",
    "a typical aerogel sample had a capacitance of @xmath9pf .",
    "the experimental cell was designed to reduce stress on the sample , allowing us to work with weak , high porosity , aerogels .",
    "the bulk density capacitor had a capacitance of @xmath10pf .",
    "the outer plate was a 1 cm length of 1.25 cm diameter thin - walled stainless steel tubing ; the inner plate was a 1 cm long solid copper cylinder machined to fit inside the tubing with a slight gap between the two .",
    "the two plates were separated by eight small dabs of epoxy  the epoxy held the plates apart , but filled a negligible amount of the inter - plate volume ( less than 2% ) .",
    "the _ in situ _ pressure gauge was necessary to obtain sufficient precision and reproducibility for our experiments .",
    "the gauge was constructed after the design of straty and adams@xcite , and consisted of a 0.2 mm thick hardened beryllium - copper diaphragm whose deflection influences the separation of two parallel brass plates .",
    "the gauge was calibrated for each data run using a room temperature pressure gauge .",
    "the cell was mounted on a liquid helium cryostat , with cooling power provided by helium exchange gas .",
    "temperature was controlled using a calibrated germanium resistive thermometer and @xmath11 thick film resistive heater mounted directly on the cell body .",
    "cell temperature was controlled to @xmath12k with long term drift also of about @xmath12k .",
    "most capacitance data from aerogel b110 were obtained using a manually balanced capacitance bridge .",
    "since we did not use a low temperature reference capacitor , the bridge s resolution and drift limited the experimental resolution to about 1 part in @xmath13 .",
    "later data , including all data on aerogel b51 , were collected using an automated capacitance bridge with much higher resolution .",
    "helium was admitted to the cell using two different methods . in the first method ,",
    "helium was directly admitted to the cell from a room temperature gas handling system through a mass flow controller .",
    "this ensured a continuous flow into the cell at a well controlled rate , but even the slowest rate of flow was too fast to allow for relaxation within the aerogel . to allow for thermal equilibration , the flow controller had to be shut off and the system allowed to relax until the fluid density in the aerogel stopped changing .",
    "most data from sample b110 were taken in this manner .",
    "for collecting data on aerogels b51 and u90 , a low temperature ballast volume was mounted about 33 cm above the cell for collecting equilibrated points ; the setup is shown schematically in fig .  [ isothermsetupschematic ] .",
    "a schematic of the low temperature portion of the setup used to measure aerogel capacitance during adsorption of helium in silica aerogel . ]",
    "helium was admitted to the ballast and the pressure of the system was then controlled by adjusting the temperature of the ballast volume .",
    "the ballast and cell were connected by a @xmath14 cm length of 0.2 mm i.d .",
    "cuni capillary and their temperatures were controlled independently . when the ballast held coexisting liquid and vapor , a small step in the ballast temperature would change the equilibrium vapor pressure of the helium in the ballast , and consequently change the pressure in the sample cell .",
    "this latter method is directly analogous to simulation studies of hysteretic adsorption of fluids in which the chemical potential is gradually incremented and the response of the fluid density is monitored . using this pressure stepping technique",
    ", we ensured that we remained along the outside edge of any hysteresis loops . on the other hand , if volumetric bursts were added to , or removed from , the system , an unknown degree of local heating or cooling could have occurred within the sample .",
    "thus , precise knowledge would be lost about where the system was within the hysteretic region .",
    "when a system is not governed by metastability the methods should give identical results , but when hysteresis is present the current state of the system depends on all the states it occupied along the way .    using the pressure regulation ballast",
    "allowed us to automate small pressure steps along the adsorption isotherm and required no additional helium input from the gas handling system outside the cryostat .",
    "our technique worked well for isotherms with finite slopes , but it only produced a few points along very flat isotherms ( i.e.  isotherms where the aerogel sample filled with liquid over a narrow pressure range ) whereas the dosing technique would have allowed a higher density of points .",
    "for b110 there was no problem obtaining enough points along the hysteresis loop of the isotherm , but for b51 the isotherms were so flat that they would fill or empty completely over a pressure range spanned by only two or three data points .",
    "the resolution and drift of the manual capacitance bridge were the limiting factors in the earlier isotherms , but the resolution of the automated capacitance bridge is about an order of magnitude better than the experimental noise . for most of the data therefore , resolution was set by temperature control .",
    "the resolution of the bulk helium density capacitor is better than @xmath15 .",
    "the aerogel helium density resolution is somewhat sample dependent , but always better than @xmath16 .",
    "both the bulk and aerogel helium density capacitances show slight shifts with temperature which contribute an additional error of less than @xmath17 over the temperature range of these data .",
    "the method we used for converting aerogel capacitance to helium density also introduced errors on the order of those due to electrical noise .",
    "since the sample was mounted with its axis horizontal , there was a gravitational pressure head of up to 60@xmath18bar across the 1.2 cm diameter sample . the uncertainty and drift in cell and ballast temperatures ( @xmath19 ) , and the slope of the coexistence curve of helium near its critical point ( @xmath20 ) combined to restrict our experimental pressure resolution to about 70@xmath18bar .",
    "the similar size of these two factors meant that both the sample dimensions and temperature control would have to be changed to improve experimental resolution significantly .",
    "the bulk helium capacitor was calibrated by using the measured capacitance and literature values@xcite for the density of helium liquid and vapor at saturated vapor pressure at 4.400k .",
    "these values were used to fit the helium density ( @xmath21 ) to an expression of the form : @xmath22 where @xmath23 was the measured capacitance and @xmath24 and @xmath25 were adjustable constants which were recalculated for each data run . the bulk helium capacitor had a slight background temperature dependence so a small empirical temperature correction was added to minimize deviations from literature values at higher temperatures . a comparison between densities calculated from our experimental data and values extracted from the nist chemistry webbook@xcite showed deviations less than @xmath26 for temperatures from 4.400k to just below the bulk critical temperature of helium ( 5.195k ) . since bulk helium density is only used to account for the effect of the aerogel capacitor fringe fields , this degree of accuracy is sufficient .",
    "isotherms for bulk helium near the critical temperature of 5.1952k .",
    "below t@xmath27 there exists a region of two - phase coexistence where the isotherm is completely flat , indicated by the arrows along the isotherms at 5.175k and 5.194k .",
    "above t@xmath27 this flat region is replaced by an inflection point . ]    using this calibration , bulk pressure - density isotherms were collected .",
    "three examples of bulk isotherms are shown in fig .",
    "[ bulkheliumisotherms ] , two below t@xmath27 ( which was empirically determined to be 5.1952k on our thermometer calibration ) and one above it . for the t@xmath28t@xmath27",
    "isotherms a distinct coexistence region is marked by arrows .",
    "the width of the two - phase coexistence region shrinks as the critical temperature is approached ; above t@xmath27 there is no coexistence and isotherms are single smooth curves with an inflection point at the critical density . even when the onset of coexistence was a little unclear on a pressure - density plot , such as the t=5.194k isotherm in fig .",
    "[ bulkheliumisotherms ] , it was obvious when looking at the time dependence of the data during a constant flow adsorption isotherm  once coexistence was reached the capacitance of the bulk helium capacitor remained constant for a long time , until the liquid - vapor meniscus in the cell reached the bulk helium capacitor . from the slopes of supercritical isotherms",
    "it is also possible to determine the compressibility of bulk helium , with flat isotherms below the lvcp corresponding to a diverging compressibility .",
    "the effective dielectric constant of a porous medium depends on the dielectric constant of the matrix , that of the fluid in its pores , and the geometry of the system . with knowledge of those three factors it is possible to calculate an effective dielectric constant@xcite .",
    "since aerogel acts as a dilute impurity , it turns out that there is little deviation from a linear relationship between fluid density and capacitance .",
    "when a single fluid phase is present there is a nonlinear term in the dielectric constant of the aerogel which depended on the aerogel porosity ( @xmath29 ) and the fluid dielectric constant ( @xmath30 ) .",
    "this term , proportional to @xmath31 , was negligible in our measurements since we were using 95% and 98% porous gels and the dielectric constant of helium is less than 1.05 at the temperatures and pressures used in our experiments .",
    "when phase separated liquid and vapor were present inside the aerogel , more assumptions had to be made since the geometry of the liquid - vapor interface was not known .",
    "however , deviations from linearity were still smaller than 3%@xcite , less than both the experimental variations between runs and the features we were investigating .",
    "there are actually three contributions to the measured capacitance of the aerogel sample : the capacitance of the empty aerogel ( @xmath32 ) , the capacitance added by the helium in the aerogel ( @xmath33 ) , and the capacitance added by the bulk helium in the fringe fields outside of the aerogel sample ( @xmath34 ) : @xmath35    to find the density of helium in the aerogel these three factors were determined separately , using an adsorption isotherm taken at 4.400k to determine their relative sizes .",
    "the capacitance of the aerogel was measured when empty ( c@xmath36 ) , when full with liquid but surrounded by bulk vapor ( c@xmath37 ) , and when full with liquid and surrounded by bulk liquid ( c@xmath38 )  see fig .  [ 95gelfringeeffects ] for details . as the aerogel fills with helium , capacitance increases until point `` a , '' where the aerogel is completely filled with liquid .",
    "the spike of noise in pressure at point a is related to momentary temperature control problems in the cell as bulk liquid begins to condense into the cell .",
    "as the bulk liquid meniscus moves up over the aerogel sample ( i.e. between points `` a '' and `` b '' ) the capacitance increases due to fringe fields in the bulk helium , not due to the helium density within the sample . by quantifying these fringe effects it is possible to correct the capacitance data for the small spurious shifts due to changes in bulk fluid density in the cell .",
    "continuous flow helium adsorption isotherm for sample b110 at 4.400k .",
    "c@xmath36 is the capacitance of the empty aerogel , point `` a '' corresponds to the aerogel being full of liquid coexisting with bulk vapor outside the gel , and point `` b '' corresponds to a full gel surrounded by bulk liquid helium .",
    "the inset enlarges the region where fringe field effects are most obvious . ]",
    "we assume that far from the lvcp the density of liquid helium in aerogel is equal to that of bulk liquid helium ; while there may be a slight enhancement of helium density due to denser layers adsorbed on the silica strands , it will not be important far from the critical point . the first layer of helium adsorbed on the aerogel surface accounts for less than 8% of the open volume in the aerogel ( for 95% porosity aerogel ) .",
    "even if we assume that the first layer is 25% denser than bulk liquid helium , then the total helium density of the system will only be enhanced by about 2% far from the lvcp .    using the three points along the 4.400k isotherm mentioned above , and assuming that helium density at 4.400k in aerogel is identical to bulk helium density , it is possible to fit the density of the helium to an expression of the form : @xmath39 where `` d '' reflects the sensitivity of the capacitor to the density of helium in the aerogel and `` e '' reflects the effects of the fringe fields ( i.e. the influence of the environment surrounding the gel , which must be subtracted from the signal ) . the constants ( c@xmath36 , d , and e ) must be determined for each run since even a small change in position of the sample can have significant effects on the density calibration .",
    "when bulk capacitance and aerogel capacitance were measured simultaneously it was simple to account for the fringe effects .",
    "however , occasionally bulk data were not available , so the density for bulk helium at svp was used to approximate @xmath40 ( bulk vapor density , since our isotherms were taken below bulk saturation ) .",
    "aerogels are truly phenomenal thermal insulators , a fact which leads to very slow thermal equilibration within samples . by using the thinnest samples ( only a few hundred micrometers thick ) we minimized the thermal equilibration time . to ensure that we were measuring rate  independent isotherms , we directly monitored the equilibration of helium density during adsorption and desorption .",

    "this is probably due to the slow thermal equilibrium within the aerogel ; while the aerogel is highly permeable to helium , convection is suppressed by the aerogel strands .",

    "the relaxation in aerogel b51 was even slower than in aerogel b110 ; a direct comparison of emptying steps for the two is also shown in fig .",
    "[ 95to98gel51krelaxemptying ] . the step along the b51 desorption isotherm corresponded to a change in t@xmath43 of only 0.1mk , as opposed to the 1.0mk change shown for aerogel b110 .",

    "similarly , the density enhancement when the gel is full ( at 5.150k ) is smaller in b51 . far from the critical point we assumed that the aerogel strands only perturb the density of the layer of helium directly adjacent to the silica strands , but by 5.150k the system is close enough to the lvcp that the liquid - vapor interface has become less distinct and the fluid is very compressible .",
    "in this temperature region , perturbations in fluid density caused by the silica strands propagate further into the fluid .",

    "the onset of capillary condensation along the isotherms is gradual , making it impossible to unambiguously identify a low density fluid phase in the aerogel that is analogous to bulk vapor .",
    "gabay _ et al_.  @xcite used a mechanical oscillator to measure the helium density while isothermally flowing helium at different rates into or out of a similar aerogel .",

    "the rate dependence they observed is consistent with our long equilibration times , given their larger sample dimensions ( 1 cm versus our 0.5 mm ) .",
    "they also found that the isotherms always had finite slopes , in agreement with our measurements .",
    "wong and chan , on the other hand , saw qualitatively different behavior  @xcite near the lvcp of helium .",
    "they measured heat capacity along isochores and used the temperatures of the peaks to map out an extremely narrow coexistence curve near the lvcp , with the liquid branch shifted to _",

    "they supplemented these measurements with several adsorption isotherms which had flat regions consistent with coexistence , and reported no hysteresis .",
    "their isotherm measurements had limited pressure resolution , so would not have resolved the smallest slopes we observed .",
    "the absence of hysteresis in these isotherm is puzzling , but could reflect differences in how our samples were filled .",
    "they used the more common method in which known quantities of gas are admitted in bursts and then let come to equilibrium  in essence stepping density rather than pressure .",
    "however , this can cause significant local heating as the gas condenses into the sample .",
    "when condensation occurs over a very narrow pressure range ( as it does in aerogels near the critical point ) a local temperature jump of even a few millikelvin would correspond to relative pressure shifts larger than the width of a hysteresis loop itself .",
    "the system would then relax along a different thermodynamic path and might not end up in the same metastable state it would reach if the chemical potential was isothermally changed in steps , as in our measurements , or continuously , as in gabay _ et al_. s work . at lower temperatures ,",
    "all techniques show hysteretic adsorption loops that cover a relatively wide density range , like the 4.880k data shown in fig .  [",
    "95gellowt3isotherms ]  @xcite .    the very narrow coexistence curve that wong and chan deduced from their heat capacity measurements was a surprising result .",
    "neither we nor gabay _",
    "et al_.  were able to find either a true coexistence region or any features in our isotherms that would produce such a narrow curve .",
    "in addition to the method used to admit helium , there are several differences between the experiments which may be relevant . both our cell and that of gabay _",
    "et al_.  had large open volumes , so the aerogel was always in contact with a substantial reservoir of bulk helium ; wong and chan s cell had much less bulk volume .",
    "our measurements and those of gabay _",
    "et al_.   were done isothermally ; wong and chan s heat capacity measurements followed isochores .",
    "these differences mean that less helium was adsorbed or desorbed following a temperature step in their isochoric measurements than following a pressure step in our isotherms .",
    "however , even with no bulk helium present , a temperature step produces gradients in temperature and thus in pressure , resulting in an internal redistribution of helium within the aerogel , with similar long equilibration times . since our sample dimensions were comparable to those in wong and chan s heat capacity measurements ( about 0.25 mm thick in their case ) , their samples probably had similarly long time constants , up to several hours .",
    "this makes interpretation of ac heat capacity measurements difficult , since only a very thin layer of helium near the surface of the sample would respond even at a heater frequency as low as 0.1 hz .",
    "although our sample density is similar to that used by wong and chan , the liquid - vapor phase behavior could be sensitive to small differences in porosity or microstructure .",
    "however , we made measurements in another aerogel , u90 , with similar density ( @xmath50 ) but synthesized elsewhere and fig .",
    "[ b110tou1005k ] shows that the behavior at 5.000k is essentially the same as the behavior of b110 ( as was the evolution of the isotherms with temperature ) .",
    "thus , two different gels with similar densities , but from different sources , showed remarkably similar behavior .",

    "perhaps more significantly , the shape of the hysteresis loops does not change as the lvcp is approached ( figs .",

    "the low density onset of condensation is sharper , but still rounded , and isotherms have a smaller , but non - zero slope at all temperatures .",

    "when there is no hysteresis , we can not identify a distinct low density feature , but over a limited temperature range there is still a kink which may indicate the end of capillary condensation and is a possible marker for the high density `` liquid '' branch of a coexistence curve .",

    "the narrowing of the b110 curve is , however , similar to that previously seen for nitrogen@xcite and neon@xcite .",
    "the behavior of fluids in pores near the liquid - vapor critical point has often been discussed in terms of a `` capillary critical point '' but there are a variety of definitions of this point  @xcite .",
    "it is sometimes assumed to be the temperature where hysteresis disappears ; in other work it is thought of as a more fundamental thermodynamic point which plays the same role as the liquid - vapor critical point in bulk fluids . in the former case ,",
    "properties like surface tension are usually assumed to remain bulk - like . in the latter case",
    ", they may exhibit power law behavior close to the capillary critical point . in our measurements",
    ", the disappearance of hysteresis does not correspond to a true critical point since , for example , the fluid s compressibility does not diverge at this temperature ( the isotherm slopes do not approach zero ) .",

    "the fluid density in the equilibrium states showed a discontinuous jump in fluid density at a single value of chemical potential as one would expect with liquid - vapor coexistence .",
    "however , when the simulations raise and lower the chemical potential to fill and empty the aerogel ( the analog of us varying the pressure in our measurements ) they also show metastable states and hysteresis .",
    "the qualitative features of the simulated hysteresis loops closely resemble our results and even the sizes of the loops are similar .",
    "furthermore , the simulated and experimental loops evolve in the same way with temperature ; roughly rectangular loops become narrower and more triangular as the temperature is raised and disappear slightly below the lvcp . at higher temperatures the simulated isotherms have finite slopes , as do our experimental ones .",
    "if there is an equilibrium liquid - vapor transition , it must be masked by the hysteresis loops at temperatures far from the lvcp and disappear before the hysteresis loops do .",
    "although the simulated aerogels all have porosities of 95% or less , the porosity dependence of the isotherms also qualitatively resembles the behavior in our experiments .",
    "loops become more rectangular as the density of the gel decreases , and the disappearance of hysteresis occurs closer to the bulk critical temperature .",
    "since the simulations which showed this behavior use mean field calculations , it does not appear that critical thermal fluctuations are needed to explain the evolution of the hysteresis or its disappearance below the bulk critical temperature .",
    "if true thermal critical behavior is observable for fluids in aerogel , then it must be very subtle .",
    "this is also consistent with the recent neutron scattering study of co@xmath2 in aerogel@xcite which did not see any evidence of a diverging coherence length near the lvcp .",
    "many of the features of our adsorption isotherms are similar to those associated with capillary condensation in denser media , despite the lack of well defined pores in aerogel . in dense media , fluid can be pictured as being adsorbed on the walls of archetypal pores ( cylindrical , slit , or ink bottle , for example ) .",
    "as fluid is adsorbed , a liquid - vapor interface forms with a negative curvature which shifts the equilibrium conditions and causes liquid to condense below the bulk saturated vapor pressure .",
    "this behavior is described quantitatively by the kelvin equation , which can be written as : @xmath51 where @xmath23 is the curvature of the liquid - vapor interface , @xmath52 is the surface tension of the fluid , @xmath53 is the saturated vapor pressure at a given temperature , @xmath54 is the pressure at which capillary condensation occurs , and @xmath55 and @xmath56 are the molar volumes of the liquid and vapor phases respectively .",
    "all of these terms are temperature dependent except for the curvature of the interface , which is assumed to remain well  defined and constant . however , aerogels are best described as a tenuous network of silica strands , not as a set of regular pores and it seems unlikely that condensation would involve a liquid - vapor interface with a constant negative curvature  the mean field simulations@xcite discussed above do not show evidence for a constant curvature interface .    the depression of the condensation pressure in our measurements ( filling at p / p@xmath57 in figs .  [ 95gel514ratehyst ] to  [ 98gelhight3isotherms ] ) does scale roughly with the bulk surface tension of helium , as one would expect for capillary condensation .",
    "if one assumes that condensation of helium in aerogels can be well described by the kelvin equation then we can extract an effective curvature of the liquid - vapor interface which is responsible for the lower condensation pressure . to convert curvature to a radius",

    "the thickness of a bulk liquid - vapor interface is given by@xcite @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the interface thickness and @xmath60 is the fluid correlation length calculated as a function of reduced temperature , t , using @xmath61 where  @xcite @xmath62 .",

    "the aerogel strands may not pin the interface and the effective surface tension may differ from its bulk values .",
    "it is therefore surprising that the filling and emptying of the aerogels scales so well with bulk surface tension . very close to the critical point , where hysteresis disappears",
    ", the bulk helium interface thickness is much larger than the strand diameter and is approaching the size of the average void in the aerogel . the effective interface radius of curvature changes rapidly in this temperature regime and it no longer makes sense to think of the system in terms of pores with a curved liquid - vapor interface .",
    "it is probably better to picture the aerogel as a random perturbation affecting the fluid phases in some averaged way .",
    "although our adsorption isotherms share many qualitative features with those in denser media , referring to the process as capillary condensation is somewhat misleading since aerogels do not have well defined pores .",

    "[ 95to98gel488k ] .",
    "the high pressure side of the b51 isotherm has a negative slope after the completion of capillary condensation ; this is due to surface tension compressing the sample and changing the area and separation of the capacitor plates .",
