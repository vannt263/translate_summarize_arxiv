    "one of the most remarkable recent experimental achievements is the preparation of cold ensembles of dipolar particles .",
    "gases of ultracold ground state magnetic atoms have been shown to display dipole - dominated dynamics in the quantum regime  @xcite .",
    "huge electric dipole moments , of up to thousands of debye , are present in highly excited rydberg states of alkali atoms  @xcite , and experiments are under way to demonstrate and control interactions in these systems  @xcite . strong correlations with ground state atoms can be obtained by weakly admixing with laser light these rydberg states @xcite , at the price of finite heating and losses due to spontaneous emission  @xcite .",
    "polar molecules prepared in the electronic and rovibrational ground state  @xcite combine the stability of ground state particles with dipole moments of up to a few debye , leading to large dipolar interactions .",
    "experiments are well under way to exploit these interactions in combination with reduced trapping geometries , to add collisional stability  @xcite .",
    "this opens the door to the study of strongly correlated quantum phases with designed long range interactions  @xcite , e.g. , for dipolar bose systems the density - driven superfluid - crystal quantum phase transition in 2d  @xcite .",
    "+ finite , confined dipolar assemblies are worthy of investigation for a number of reasons , the most obvious being the study of the evolution of the physical properties of the system as its size is increased , approaching the bulk limit @xcite .",
    "for example , recent theoretical work with fermionic molecules  @xcite has analyzed the effects of quantum statistics on transitions between wigner - type states in traps  @xcite . in this work ,",
    "we focus our attention on quasi - two - dimensional , harmonically confined dipolar systems of mesoscopic size , comprising a relatively small number of particles .",
    "one of the fundamental issues that one may address , is the occurrence of superfluidity in a cluster , until now mostly explored in the context of helium @xcite and hydrogen @xcite droplets .",
    "+ based on results of first principle quantum simulations , an intriguing deviation from bulk behaviour that occurs in a dipolar system of small size is predicted here , namely the occurrence of _ non - classical _ ground state crystalline arrangements , in an intermediate range of confinement strength .",
    "these configurations differ from the classical arrangement by the number of particles in the inner shell of the crystal , and are stabilized by the energetic contribution of zero - point motion . to our knowledge , this is the first demonstration of such a physical effect , which can be observed experimentally in mesoscopic dipolar clusters of polar molecules .",
    "it is observed for clusters of specific sizes , namely @xmath0=12 and @xmath1 , for @xmath2 .",
    "this effect takes place in the mesoscopic crystalline phase , in which quantum - mechanical exchanges of indistinguishable particles are stroingly suppressed ; it is therefore expected to take place irrespective of the quantum statistics of the particles .",
    "+ we describe the mathematical model of the system utilized here in the next section ; we then briefly review the computational methodology utilized here , and illustrate the results of the calculations and main physical conclusions in the following sections .",
    "we consider a setup where @xmath0 dipolar particles of mass @xmath3 are confined to a 2d plane by applying a strong transverse trapping field  @xcite , e.g a 1d optical lattice .",
    "dipole moments are aligned perpendicular to the plane , with a dc induced dipole moment @xmath4 .",
    "we assume an additional in - plane parabolic trap with frequency @xmath5 , as realized by a magnetic dipole trap , or a single site of a large spacing optical lattice .",
    "for pure dipolar interactions , the many - body hamiltonian in dimensionless form is given by @xmath6      + \\sum_{i < j}\\frac{1}{|{{\\mbox{\\boldmath$r$}}}_i-{{\\mbox{\\boldmath$r$}}}_j|^3},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the unit of length is @xmath7 , that of energy is @xmath8 , and where @xmath9 , @xmath10 being the characteristic ( dimensionless ) confining length of the parabolic trap .",
    "@xmath11 plays the role of control parameter here , as a greater value of @xmath11 means that the trap is compressed , and the particle density correspondingly increased .",
    "we assume for definiteness that particles obey bose statistics , and all of the numerical results presented here are obtained with this assumption ; however , the conclusions of this study pertaining to the crystalline phases are independent of quantum statistics",
    ". + the basic ground state physics of the system described by ( [ eq : eqhamres ] ) has been characterized in previous works @xcite ; generally speaking , it mimics qualitatively that of the bulk system @xcite . for sufficiently small @xmath11 ,",
    "the cluster is in a low - density , weakly interacting superfluid phase @xcite . in the limit of strong confinement , the potential energy dominates , and the ground state takes on the classical lowest - energy crystalline configuration , predictable by straightforward potential energy minimization ( last two terms of eq .  ) .",
    "+ for a cluster comprising a sufficiently small number of particles ( i.e. , @xmath12 ) , the finite size of the system allows for the existence of several intermediate , ",
    "supersolid \" phases @xcite displaying simultaneously a finite superfluid response and crystalline order @xcite .",
    "these phases are not expected to survive in the thermodynamic limit ; indeed , the nature of a supersolid phase of a system of dipolar bosons in two dimensions is predicted @xcite to deviate significantly from that of mesoscopic supersolids .",
    "+ in this manuscript we mostly focus our attention on mesoscopic crystalline phases , in which particles are localized and consequently quantum - mechanical exchanges are suppressed .",
    "we investigated the low temperature ( @xmath13 ) properties of the system described by ( [ eq : eqhamres ] ) by means of computer simulations , based on the continuous - space worm algorithm @xcite . since this technique is by now",
    "fairly well - established , and extensively described in the literature , we shall not review it here .",
    "details of the simulation are standard .",
    "+ because we are interested in the physics of the system in the @xmath13 limit , we report here results corresponding to a temperature @xmath14 sufficiently low to regard them as essentially ground state estimates . a quantitative criterion to assess whether the temperature @xmath14 of the simulation is sufficienty low ,",
    "consists of comparing it to the computed particle mean kinetic energy @xmath15 .",
    "for all the simulations for which we present results in figures [ f2 ] and [ f4 ] , it is @xmath16 .",
    "+ the use of a finite temperature technique to investigate ground state physics might appear counterintuitive , considering that methods exist purposefully designed to study the ground state of a many - body system ( e.g. , diffusion monte carlo ) . in practice , however , finite - temperature techniques often prove superior , even to determine ground state properties ( naive statements by dmc practitioners notwithstanding ) .",
    "this is mainly owing to the unbiasedness of finite temperature methods , which , unlike their @xmath14=0 counterparts , require no _ a priori _ physical input ( e.g. , a trial wave function ) . moreover , finite temperature methods allow one to assess more easily and reliably quantities other than the energy , including off - diangonal correlations .",
    "we compute both global and local superfluid responses , using standard methodology @xcite .",
    "all of the results presented here are extrapolated to the limit of zero imaginary time step @xcite .",
    "for a two - dimensional system of @xmath0=12 dipolar bosons confined in a planar harmonic trap of different characteristic length @xmath17 . ]    figure [ fig : fig2 ] displays radial density profiles ( computed with respect to the center of the trap ) for the ground state of a mesoscopic assembly of @xmath0=12 particles , confined in two - dimensional harmonic traps of varying strength ( i.e. , characteristic length ) . in order to facilitate the comparison",
    ", we plot the radial density @xmath18 as a function of @xmath19 .",
    "figure [ f2 ] shows particle density maps obtained from statistically representative configuration snapshots ( i.e. , particle world lines ) for four distinct cases , corresponding to different values of the harmonic confining length @xmath17 , namely @xmath20 and 0.00056 . by  statistically \" representative , we mean that every configuration generated in the simulation is physically equivalent to that shown in the figure ; in particular , for the case in which the system takes on the crystalline arrangements shown in panels ( c ) and ( d ) , every configuration in the monte carlo random walk only differs from that shown by a mere rotation .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]      + most interestingly , we find that in the range of values of @xmath17 in which the non - classical crystal ( e.g. , for @xmath0=12 , @xmath21 ) is the ground state , the classical one ( @xmath22 ) remains a low - temperature metastable conguration .",
    "specifically , in a finite range of temperature the system is observed in the monte carlo simulation to switch between @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "this is shown qualitatively in figure [ f3 ] , displaying typical configuration snaphots yielded by a simulation carried out at a temperature @xmath23 ; this is approximately thirty times higher than that yielding essentially ground state estimates , for which the configuration is that shown in the right panel of figure [ f3 ] .",
    "the kinetic energy per particle at this high temperature is around @xmath24 .",
    "melting of the cluster into a featureless fluid takes place at a higher temperature , in fact at a value close to that of the bulk crystal @xcite .",
    "a similar coexistence is observed for the @xmath0=19 cluster as well .",
    "the physical behavior described above , namely the coexistence of two  phases \" of the cluster at finite temperature , with the classical one emerging as the temperature is raised , is analogous to what predicted for some small parahydrogen clusters ( between 20 and 30 molecules ) @xcite .",
    "this intriguing type of phase coexistence is allowed by the finite size of the system , with the ensuing interplay between bulk and surface energy .",
    "an important difference is that , in the case of @xmath25-h@xmath26 clusters , coexistence is between superfluid and crystalline phases , the superfluid being the ground state , underlain by particle exchanges . at higher temperature ,",
    "as the thermal wavelength of the molecules becomes shorter , exchanges are suppressed and the system finds it energetically advantageous to take on solid - like . in the case of the dipolar cluster discussed here ,",
    "coexistence is between two crystalline phases .",
    "exchanges are infrequent in these phases , quantum - mechanical effects consisting almost exclusively of zero - point motion .",
    "an important consequence of this fact , is that a transition between non - classical and classical ground states can be expected to occur in mesoscopic dipolar systems of either bose or fermi particles .",
    "this is because any physical difference between bose and fermi systems can emerge only in the presence of quantum - mechanical exchanges of indistinguishable particles , which are strongly suppressed in these mesoscopic crystals .",
    "+ in conclusion , a numerical studies of mesoscopic systems of dipolar particles confined to two dimensions yields evidence of non - classical crystalline ground states for clusters of specific numbers , underlain by quantum zero - point motion .",
    "the mesoscopic phases described in this work can be realized with polar molecules of current experimental interest .",
    "for example ,",
    "for a moderate in - plane confinement @xmath27 1khz and fully polarized rbcs ( @xmath28  debye ) , lics ( @xmath29  debye ) , and sro molecules ( @xmath30 debye ) , @xmath17 reaches values as small as @xmath31 and 0.002 , respectively . since the in - situ interparticle distances can be of the order of several hundreds of nm , it may be possible to directly address single particles _ in situ _ , and thus image the _ spatial structure _ of the crystalline phases above using , e.g. , tightly focused beams .",
    "alternatively , we propose the following method , which amounts to a version of a _ magnifying lens_. at a given time @xmath32 the ( dc or ac ) fields inducing the dipole - dipole interactions are switched off , and the in - plane harmonic confinement is inverted in sign . because of this inverted potential , each particle experiences a radial acceleration which depends on its _ spatial position _ at time @xmath32 . after a certain time - of - flight , the particles can be , e.g , ionized and their positions recorded on a ion plate with unit efficiency , providing a magnified picture of the in - situ spatial configuration .",
    "+                                                                obviously , in a strict thermodynamic sense one can not speak of `` phase '' of a finite system . henceforth ,",
    "therefore , this word should be interpreted loosely , in reference to qualitative , average properties of the system in its most probable configurations .",
    "obviously , any finite cluster can rotate without dissipation at a temperature lower than @xmath33 , @xmath34 being the classical moment of inertia of the cluster .",
    "such a free rigid rotation constitutes a conceptually different scenario from the one referred to here as  superfluid \" ."
