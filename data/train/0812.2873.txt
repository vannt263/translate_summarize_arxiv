    "nonperturbative dynamics affects the structure of lhc events even for high momentum transfer , through hadronization , soft underlying scattering , multiple hard interactions .",
    "models for these processes are necessary , for instance , for monte carlo generators to produce realistic event simulations",
    ".    the treatment of multiple parton interactions in qcd will require methods that go beyond the local operator expansion , and likely involve fully unintegrated parton correlation functions  @xcite .",
    "besides the relevance for event generators , this should also provides a natural framework for the investigation at the lhc of possible new strong - interaction effects at very high energies , including parton saturation  @xcite .",
    "this report is based on the analysis  @xcite of nonlocal operator expansion , investigating corrections from graphs with multiple gluon exchange .",
    "the point of view in this study is to connect the treatment of multi - gluon contributions with formulations in terms of standard partonic operators , and in this respect it can be seen as deriving from the approach of  @xcite .",
    "we present an illustration for the case of structure functions .",
    "this case is also treated in the analyses of  @xcite .",
    "more discussion may be found in  @xcite . the formulation discussed below trades parton distribution functions for moments of eikonal - line correlators .",
    "we expect this formulation to be useful also for the treatment of the associated final - state distributions .",
    "the analysis  @xcite starts with the quark distribution function , defined as @xmath0 is the gauge link , and the subscript @xmath1 is the instruction to take connected graphs .",
    "the matrix element ( [ eq : fqdef ] ) can be rewritten as the real part of a forward scattering amplitude  @xcite , in which we think of the operator @xmath2 as creating an antiquark plus an eikonal line in the minus direction , starting at distance @xmath3 from the position of the target .    next ,",
    "supposing that @xmath4 is small , we treat the evolution of the antiquark - eikonal system in a hamiltonian framework ( see  @xcite and references therein ) which allows us to express the evolution operator in the high - energy approximation as an expansion in wilson - line matrix elements .",
