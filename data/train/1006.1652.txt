    "many different mechanisms have been suggested to explain the observed late - time acceleration of the expansion of the universe @xcite .",
    "differentiating between these options is one of the main challenges facing cosmologists today .",
    "we can try to build up the evidence for different mechanisms by examining the evolution of the universe in two key ways : measuring the background geometry and measuring structure formation within it .",
    "the geometrical evolution of the universe can most easily be measured using two primary techniques : we can use supernovae as standard candles or galaxy clustering as a standard ruler to make precise measurement of cosmological expansion . although supernovae were first to confirm the accelerated expansion of the universe at high statistical significance @xcite following analyses of early galaxy surveys @xcite , supernovae surveys are now limited by systematic rather than statistical errors @xcite .",
    "the possibility of using galaxy clustering to provide a standard ruler has become increasingly important since the baryon acoustic peak was detected @xcite in galaxy power spectra measured from the 2df galaxy redshift survey ( 2dfgrs ; @xcite ) and the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; @xcite ) .",
    "using only the baryon acoustic oscillation ( bao ) component of the galaxy clustering signal makes constraints robust to non - linear effects , and has already been exploited to produce interesting constraints on cosmological models @xcite .",
    "galaxy surveys provide complementary information about the build - up of large - scale structure through redshift space distortions ( rsd ) .",
    "these arise because we do not observe true galaxy positions , but instead infer distances from measured redshifts .",
    "coherent comoving galaxy velocities due to the growth of structure therefore lead to measurable anisotropic clustering @xcite .",
    "rsd have been measured from the 2dfgrs and sdss using techniques based on both correlation functions and power - spectra @xcite , and have recently been detected at higher redshift @xcite .",
    "in fact , for fundamental reasons , rsd are independent of galaxy bias : galaxies act as test particles in the matter flow , so their motion is independent of galaxy properties .",
    "we can therefore measure the matter velocity field at the locations of the galaxies and , provided that galaxy positions are representative within the velocity field , this gives an unbiased measurement of @xmath5 where @xmath6 , the logarithmic derivative of the linear growth rate , @xmath7 , with respect to the scale factor @xmath8 , and @xmath9 quantifies the amplitude of fluctuations in the matter density field .",
    "many techniques have been proposed for measuring rsd , including using multipoles of the correlation function @xcite , or the power spectrum @xcite , based on the plane - parallel approximation for rsd @xcite .",
    "the geometry of the system can be easily incorporated into an analysis of the correlation function as the separation of each pair can be split into radial and angular components .",
    "it is more difficult to perform such a decomposition when measuring the power spectrum , although various techniques have been suggested , decomposing the density field into a basis of spherical harmonics and radial functions ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "as well as allowing for the geometry to a survey and rsd within it , we need to allow for two effects :    1 .",
    "rsd are degenerate with the angular anisotropy of power spectrum caused by the alcock - palczinski effect , so measurements of growth and geometry from the same survey will be correlated , and it is sensible to undertake a combined analysis @xcite .",
    "as noted by @xcite , the full rsd operator has extra terms compared to the plane - parallel one and results in a redshift - space power spectrum which is not diagonal in @xmath10 .",
    "these extra terms are important for galaxy pairs separated by wide angles and need to be included in any analysis that uses wide - angle data @xcite .",
    "in this paper we concentrate on the second of these effects . @xcite and",
    "@xcite proposed a method of computing the redshift - space correlation function which does not assume a plane - parallel approximation and is applicable to arbitrarily large angles . in their treatment",
    "the redshift - space correlation function depends not only on the redshift - space pair separation @xmath11 and cosine of the angle of the pair with respect to the line - of - sight @xmath12 , but also on the separation angle between two galaxies in a pair @xmath13 , which does not have to be small .",
    "they were able to express the redshift - space correlation function explicitly trough a real - space correlation function and cosmological parameters . given the precision that future surveys will achieve and the fact that they will cover large fractions of the sky , these effects will need to be corrected .",
    "the wide - angle effects can be subdivided in `` purely wide - angle '' and `` mode - coupling '' terms : `` purely wide - angle '' effects correct plane - parallel predictions accounting for the fact that the separation angle is non - zero , `` mode - coupling '' terms in addition account for the fact that galaxy pairs coherently moved from the high - density to low - density regions .",
    "these latter terms vanish if the initial real - space distribution of galaxies is uniform in distance , and both terms vanish in the plane - parallel limit due to the symmetry of the system .",
    "both terms are of the same order and mode - coupling tends to smooth out features in the power spectrum such as the baryon acoustic oscillations ( bao ) .",
    "given the importance and , particularly , the quality of rsd constraints expected from forthcoming surveys such as the baryon oscillation spectroscopic survey ( boss ; @xcite ) , surveys resulting from proposals for wide - field multi - object spectrographs on 4 m telescopes such as bigboss @xcite and satellite missions such as euclid @xcite , it is timely to revisit this problem , and to test wide - angle rsd theory .",
    "in this paper we use numerical simulations to extensively test the dependence of rsd constraints on the angular separation of galaxy pairs .",
    "this paper is organised as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec : rsd ]",
    "we briefly review the theory of wide - angle rsd ; in sec .",

    "[ sec : disc ] we conclude and discuss how the results will affect real survey measurements .",
    "galaxy positions are measured in a redshift - space , and differ from the real - space positions because of the contributions from peculiar velocities , @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the redshift space position , @xmath16 is the real space position and @xmath17 the radial component of peculiar velocity .",
    "since the total number of galaxies in real and redshift spaces is the same , the number @xmath18 of galaxies observed in a volume element @xmath19 of redshift space is related to the real space number density @xmath20 by : @xmath21 the observed redshift space galaxy overdensity @xmath22 at position @xmath15 can be related to the redshift - space selection function @xmath23 , @xmath24 in contrast , an unbiased estimate of the true galaxy overdensity @xmath25 at position @xmath16 is given by : @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the expected galaxy distribution in real - space  the expected number density of unclustered galaxies at position @xmath16 given the selection criteria of the survey .",
    "we distinguish here between the measured redshift - space selection function @xmath28 and the true selection function @xmath27 even though the two are the same at linear order .",
    "we now assume that the expected density is a function of the radial component of the position only , which we denote @xmath29 in redshift - space and @xmath30 in real - space .",

    "this allows us to only consider galaxy pairs at particular values of @xmath13 .    to show both the correctness of our methodology and the deviation from the plane - parallel situation we tested galaxies separated by two different fixed values of @xmath13 ; the mode coupling terms are also strongly dependent on the galaxy radial distribution",
    ", so we have tested simulations with 4 different number density distributions , for both values of @xmath13 .",
    "we show that taking in account the wide angle and mode coupling terms ( that are of the same order , as stated in @xcite ) give a clear deviation from the plane - parallel theory ; using the exact theory and our methodology , we can match the results of simulations , the agreement between data and theory being remarkable , especially considering how crude our modelling of the hv simulations is ( we use a measurement of the 3d real - space correlation function as our baseline model , and we do not include a correction for fingers - of - god type effects ) . for rsd measurements made within radial bins , it will be vital to match the theory to the exact distribution of galaxies observed .    in a measurement of rsd from real data ,",
    "the final result will be a weighted average over different opening angles , to take account for the fraction of galaxy pairs separated by a @xmath13 angle , so in wide surveys one has to discard the plane - parallel approximation , or face losing a considerable amount of information .",
    "for this reason our methodology will be particularly useful for incoming and future redshift surveys , such as the baryon oscillation spectroscopic survey ( boss ; @xcite ) , bigboss @xcite , and euclid @xcite ; the importance of this methodology for current and future experiments will be considered in a subsequent paper @xcite .",
