    "quantum optomechanics is a rapidly developing field of research .",
    "the optomechanics archetypal setup consists of a high - finesse optical cavity whose optical mode is coupled to the displacement of a mechanical resonator . in the past few years , several research groups using different device designs have reached a regime where the optical radiation pressure cools the motion of the mechanical resonator  @xcite .",
    "this technique has been used to bring the mechanical resonator to the quantum ground state  @xcite . a remarkable progress in the linear regime",
    "@xcite has been achieved ; highlights include optomechanically induced transparency  @xcite , generation of squeezed light  @xcite , and mechanically mediated state transfer  @xcite .",
    "considerable efforts are now dedicated to reaching the nonlinear regime , which holds immense promise for the study of large - scale quantum phenomena such as the preparation of nonclassical states of mechanical resonators  @xcite . in the canonical system",
    "this regime is achieved when the single photon coupling strength @xmath0 is comparable to the mechanical frequency of the resonator @xmath1 and the decay rate of the optical cavity @xmath2  @xcite .",
    "these conditions are far from reach with current devices , and to enhance the nonlinearity several alternative techniques have been proposed  @xcite .",

    "gaas / alas superlattice cavities , where a @xmath5 cavity is enclosed by two distributed bragg reflector  ( dbr ) mirrors , can simultaneously confine the light field and the mechanical field  @xcite .",
    "the great advantage of superlattice planar cavities is that the large overlap between both optical and vibrational fields in the cavity region and the photoelastic effect leads to high optomechanical coupling rates  @xcite .",

    "have been demonstrated  @xcite in micropillar superlattice cavities and high quality factors for the mechanical mode are also expected and are calculated here .",
    "in addition higher optomechanical coupling rates are expected for micropillar cavities , compared to planar superlattice cavities , because of the reduced acoustic and optical - mode volumes .",
    "all these qualities make them excellent candidates for optomechanical experiments .",
    "however , the acoustic confinement in micropillar cavities differs significantly from the acoustic confinement in planar cavities . at the air - semiconductor boundary of the micropillar",

    "here we study the acoustic confinement in superlattice micropillar cavities taking into account the effect of the air - semiconductor boundary .",
    "we have developed a semi - analytical model that combines the scattering matrix and the acoustic modal expansion of each layer of the micropillar .",
    "first we calculate the eigenmodes of each single layer and then we impose continuity of the displacement and stress fields at the boundaries between the layers . each layer is modeled as an individual cylindrical acoustic waveguide and the acoustic modes are calculated along the cylinder axis @xmath8 in cylindrical coordinates @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and @xmath8 .",
    "we consider only axisymmetric modes because , for symmetry reasons , only these modes are coupled with the optical field .",

    "the lowest frequency mode corresponds to a surface acoustic wave and the second lowest frequency mode corresponds to a transverse mode .",

    "the calculation of the longitudinal and transverse resonance modes using a one - dimensional transfer - matrix calculation  @xcite gives the same result as our model in the limit of a large diameter .",
    "now we do an in - depth analysis of the longitudinal mode .",
    "this mode provides the highest coupling rate with the optical field because longitudinal vibrations modify considerably the effective length of the optical cavity whereas the contribution of transverse vibrations to the optomechanical coupling rate is minimum .",

    "we can define @xmath76 as the length traveled by vibrations inside the cavity and @xmath77 as the rayleigh length of the acoustic gaussian beam . if the number of pairs is small , the mechanical quality factor is small , @xmath77 is bigger than @xmath78 , and the resonance mode has a gaussian shape because there is no reflection at the boundaries [ see  fig .  [",

    "the micropillar can be modeled as a one - dimensional device . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : dbrcavity](b ) , in this regime the quality factor obtained with a one - dimensional transfer matrix calculation  @xcite coincides with the quality factor obtained with the mathematical model from this paper ; this validates our model .",

    "[ fig : dbrcavity](b ) the reflections at the air - semiconductor boundary can considerably modify the quality factor .",
    "figure  [ fig : dbrcavity](b ) shows that the mechanical quality factor can be improved by increasing the number of pairs per mirror , but this improvement is considerably reduced for small micropillar diameters .",
    "the coupling rate @xmath79 , representing the optical resonance frequency shift per unit displacement amplitude , is reduced with the number of pairs per mirror because the overlap between the mechanical mode from figs .  [",

    "[ fig : dbrcavity](c ) , these two effects compensate each other and @xmath81 is almost independent of the number of pairs per mirror . the optomechanical coupling rate @xmath0 has been calculated with a perturbative approach  @xcite which accounts for the geometric and the photo - elastic contributions .",
    "we used bulk photoelastic coefficients for gaas , @xmath82  @xcite . with these values ,",

    "we propose an alternative approach that allows high mechanical quality factors with very small mode volumes to be obtained .",
    "the structure consists of a gaas region with two propagative modes that is enclosed by two monomode alas regions [ see figure  [ fig : fanoregime](a ) ] .",
    "the first propagative mode of the gaas region is very well coupled to the propagative mode of the alas region because the spatial mode shapes are very well matched .",
    "the impedance mismatch at the gaas / alas boundary leads to small reflections , resulting in smooth oscillations of the transmission as a function of the gaas region thickness [ see figure  [ fig : fanoregime](b ) ] . on the other hand the second propagative mode of the gaas region is not well coupled to the single propagative mode of the alas region and is strongly reflected at the interface .",
    "as a result the second propagative mode of the gaas region is well confined , giving rise to high-__(__q ) trapped modes .",
    "the result of the interaction between these two transmission pathways from gaas to alas leads to fano lineshape resonances  @xcite characterized by an asymmetrical lineshape that has been observed in various physical systems ranging from carbon nanotubes  @xcite to intersubband transitions in coupled quantum well systems  @xcite .",

    "[ fig : fanoregime](d ) . in this device",
    "there is no optical cavity , but it is possible to couple the mechanical mode through strain  @xcite to the optical transition of a quantum dot that can be placed in the gaas region .",
    "this would allow the mechanical mode to be cooled down to the ground state  @xcite and has interesting applications such as quantum state transfer between the mechanical resonator and the two level system  @xcite .",
    "the mathematical model presented here provides the foundation for the acoustic analysis of layered structures with lateral confinement .",
    "our calculations show that the total reflection of vibrational modes at the air - semiconductor boundaries of superlattice micropillar cavities has a dramatic effect on the acoustical quality factor and mode volume .",
    "in particular , the acoustic - mode volume is strongly dependent on the number of mirror repeats , unlike the optical - mode volume .",
