    "being one of the most exciting manifestations of the wave properties of particles , tunneling seemed to be a paradoxical prediction of quantum mechanics .",
    "historically , the theory of the nuclear @xmath0decay was the first study of tunnel transitions @xcite , caused by bonding between nuclear resonances and continuous spectrum .",
    "explanation of the intermolecular rearrangement of the ammonium spectrum @xcite due to the tunnel splitting of vibrational spectra , opened the era of study of tunneling in multi - well potentials @xcite .",
    "this problem became even more important in view of interpretation of the observed tunneling phenomena in condensed matter @xcite , and in particular in the josephson junctions @xcite .",
    "currently , investigations of tunneling processes are mostly related to the study of the bose - einstein condensate in different types of traps @xcite .    theoretical analysis of tunneling in double - well potentials is mostly performed within the two ",
    "mode approximation @xcite",
    ". important characteristics of this approach are the difference of energies of the ground state and of the first excited state ( @xmath1 ) , as well as their wave functions",
    ". values of @xmath2 define , in particular , revival times of the wave packets .",
    "this approximation explains general properties of tunneling , but it is unable to give interpretations of many subtle effects .",
    "analysis of processes in multi - well potentials is complicated , since most of the models use phenomenological or piecewise potentials ( e.g. , building from the rectangular wells and barriers , or from parabola ) , which are far from the real potentials .",
    "spectra and wave functions in such potentials are unknown , that supposes the numerical analysis of their properties in consequent studies .",
    "it is important to note that there exist exactly solvable models with multi - well potentials @xcite , which could be used for the description of tunneling processes .",
    "going beyond the two - mode approximation reveals interesting features of the dynamics of localized states .",
    "in particular , it leads to the substantial coherence breaking , as in symmetric @xcite as well as in asymmetric double - well potentials @xcite .",
    "moreover , characteristics of tunneling strongly depend on the shape of the potential , and demonstrate a non - regular behavior which realized in bouncing increasing the probability of the localization of the wave packet ( wp ) in certain well .",
    "these features become even be more striking upon the initial localized state squeezing .    in",
    "qm the time evolution of wave packets is described by propagators @xcite , in which the contribution of the entire spectrum of the considered hamiltonian is taken into account .",
    "however , only few models , mostly with one - well potentials , are known to have analytical expressions for propagators . to build propagators for exactly solvable quantum mechanical models with double - well potentials one could use the same approach as in @xcite and construct new propagators from the known ones .",
    "the aim of the present paper is to describe the dynamics of localized states in multi - well potentials within the self  consistent approach .",
    "we use multi - well potentials obtained in the framework of @xmath3 @xcite and describe the dynamics of wave packets with corresponding propagators , calculated by use of the approach of @xcite .",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows . in section 1",
    "we briefly discuss the construction of exactly solvable models in the framework of @xmath3 @xcite and give expressions for hamiltonians with both symmetric and asymmetric potentials , and wave functions , obtained from the initial model of harmonic oscillator ( ho ) . in section 2",
    "we obtain the expressions for propagators in these models using the approach of @xcite . using the hamiltonian of ho as the initial one ,",
    "we obtain the explicit expressions for propagators in models with multi - well potentials . in section 3",
    "we use the obtained potentials and propagators for the non - perturbative analysis of the dynamics of localized states in both symmetric and asymmetric potentials , and for different types of wave packets . in section 4",
    "we discuss some problems related to the considered problems and future developments .",
    "to construct multi - well potentials in @xmath3 @xcite we add states with energy @xmath4 below the ground state energy @xmath5 of the initial hamiltonian @xmath6 ( we assume that @xmath6 possesses only the discrete spectrum ) .",
    "multi - well structure of the obtained potentials becomes more striking when @xmath7 .",
    "the super  hamiltonian of @xmath3 consists of three non - trivial hamiltonians @xcite @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "spectra of the latter two hamiltonians have the additional state below the ground state of the initial hamiltonian , when @xmath11 is exact , while other states coincide with those of @xmath12 . @xmath9 and",
    "its wave functions are related to @xmath13 and its initial wave functions in the following way : @xmath14 here @xmath15 are two linear independent solutions to the auxiliary equation @xmath16 .",
    "they are non  negative and have the following asymptotic behavior : @xmath17 ( @xmath18 ) under @xmath19 , and @xmath20 ( @xmath21 ) under @xmath22 . here",
    "@xmath23 are normalized wave functions of @xmath24 , @xmath25 is the wronskian .    using the form  invariance of @xmath26 and @xmath27 @xcite one could obtain similar expressions for @xmath10 , @xmath28 : @xmath29 where the parameter @xmath30 is restricted to be @xmath31 , and",
    "the normalization constant is @xmath32 .    in what follows",
    ", we will use the hamiltonian of ho as the initial hamiltonian to consider the tunneling of wave packets .",
    "thus , the solutions to the auxiliary equation are parabolic cylinder functions @xmath33 and the wronskian becomes @xmath34 @xcite , where @xmath35 is the gamma - function , @xmath36 , @xmath37 : @xmath38    note that @xmath39 , entering @xmath40 , are determined by the asymptotes of the solutions @xmath41 .",
    "the ground state wave function of @xmath9 is @xmath42 and wave functions of excited states are determined by ( [ susy - article - eqs:1 ] ) , where @xmath43 , @xmath44 are the wave functions of ho .",
    "the potential of the hamiltonian @xmath45 ( see fig . [ susy - article - fig:1 ] ) is defined by the symmetric combination of solutions @xmath46 , while the potential of @xmath10 is defined by the asymmetric combination @xmath47 , and corresponds to the family of hamiltonians with different values of @xmath48 .",
    "hence , the ground state wave function of @xmath10 has the form of @xmath49    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     this phenomena could be illustrated by the probability to find the particle in a certain well @xmath50 ( fig .",
    "[ susy - article - fig:7 ] ) . large amplitudes of beats gives the evidence for the substantial contribution from the over - barrier states to the dynamics of wave packets .",
    "as it was mentioned above , during the evolution in the symmetric potential , a substantial part of the wave packet leaves the left well and return to the initial value at the time scale @xmath51 .",
    "meanwhile , the portion of the wave packet in the right well of the asymmetric potential varies insignificantly , that tells on the partial trapping of the wave packet .",
    "in the present paper we propose the approach to study of the dynamics of initially localized states , which is based on the exactly solvable quantum mechanical problems with multi - well potentials and on the corresponding exact propagators .",
    "using the hamiltonian of the harmonic oscillator as a basis one , we obtain , in frameworks of @xmath3 , new hamiltonians with multi ",
    "well potentials , both symmetric and asymmetric , together with the corresponding propagators .",
    "the study of the dynamics of the initially localized states demonstrates that the application of the two - mode approximation to the description of tunneling is very restricted , especially for systems with only few states in the under - barrier region .",
    "such condition is typical for modern superconducting quantum interference devices and cold atoms traps .",
    "so , even the non  squeezed wave packet ( @xmath52 ) can not be adequately approximated by wave functions of the ground and the first excited states .",
    "it is important to note that the states of hamiltonians @xmath9 and @xmath10 are well  suited as the basic states to expand the localized states @xmath53 .",
    "usually , ten states are enough for a good approximation of @xmath53 in the sufficiently wide range of the squeezing parameter @xmath54 this can be confirmed by a good agreement between @xmath55 and the results of calculations by use of the exact propagator .",
    "in contrast to @xcite , where tunneling is compared in symmetric and asymmetric potentials , the spectra of hamiltonians @xmath9 and @xmath10 are similar in our approach . moreover , the shape of the potentials may be varied by the variation of @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "the dynamics of wp contains slow tunneling of under  barrier states and fast beats , due to over - barrier states , and has a regular character , in contrast to @xcite .",
    "it happens since the over - barrier states have the spectrum of the initial hamiltonian of ho ( i.e. the equidistant spectrum ) and the states get interfered with each other .",
    "beats become smoother when a dissipation is taken into account @xcite .",
    "the revival time of the wave packet is equal to @xmath58 , that coincides with revival time predicted by the two - mode approximation .",
    "when the squeezing parameter is low @xmath59 the amplitude of beats is relatively small , since the number of excited states , contributing to wp is low . in the symmetric potential a part of the wp , which is formed by tunneling of the under - barrier states is smooth enough .    in the asymmetric potential",
    "the dynamics of wp , initially localized in one of the minima of @xmath60 , has a number of distinctive features .",
    "in particular , the partial trapping of wp in the initial well and the suppression of tunneling to another well is observed .",
    "this phenomenon occurs independently on the well initially containing the wp .",
    "when the initial state is uniformly distributed between both wells of @xmath60 , this phenomenon is observed for the deeper well , thus the tunneling rate from the deeper well to the other well is smaller than the rate of reverse transitions . when the squeezing parameter @xmath61 increases , beats , caused by the over - barrier states , increase and mimic the contribution of slow tunneling of the under - barrier states .",
    "in some sense it could be considered as the destruction of tunneling of the initially highly localized wave packet .",
