    "the cms and atlas collaborations have announced the discovery of a resonance around @xmath1 gev compatible with the higgs boson predicted by the standard model ( sm )  @xcite . to eventually confirm the discovery of the sm higgs boson",
    ", it will be necessary not only to measure the strength and the structure of its couplings to the fermions and vector bosons of the sm , but also to exclude the existence of other heavier scalar states with similar properties .",
    "the scalar sector of the sm is particularly simple , yet it does not provide any clue either on its origin , i.e. on the possible underlying dynamics , or on its stability .",
    "alternative models that address these and other open questions often predict a richer structure for the scalar sector , such as in supersymmetry ( susy ) , technicolor theories and models with extra dimensions .",
    "two - higgs doublet models provide the simplest and most often studied extensions of the scalar sector of the sm . in all these cases , heavier scalar and/or pseudo scalar partners of the `` sm higgs '' can be expected below the tev scale .",
    "the width of such heavy states , turns out to be sizable .",
    "a large width induces both a smearing and deformation of the signal line shape as well as a sizable signal / background interference . for a heavy sm - like higgs , ( e.g , @xmath2100 gev for @xmath3 gev )",
    ", the narrow width approximation ( nwa ) has been shown to be untenable , possibly invalidating the currently set exclusion limits on the heavy higgs and beyond  @xcite .",
    "going beyond the nwa , however , turns out not to be such an easy theoretical task .",
    "the challenges are manifold .",
    "first , the most accurate predictions for the signal cross sections , typically at the next - to - next - to - leading order ( nnlo ) in qcd and at nlo in ew , assume a complete factorization between production and decay , _ i.e. _ , they employ the nwa , and the _ a posteriori _ inclusion of width effects is not uniquely defined @xcite .",
    "second , the very definition of a width , which amounts to a resummation of a specific subset of terms appearing at all orders in perturbation theory becomes problematic , leading to possible violations of gauge symmetry as well as of unitarity @xcite .",
    "currently , the most pragmatic and employed solution is the so - called complex mass scheme ( cms ) @xcite . in short",
    ", it amounts to analytically continue the parameters entering the sm lagrangian that are related to the masses to complex values .",
    "such scheme maintains gauge invariance at all orders in perturbation theory and can be consistently employed in ( n)nlo in ew computations  @xcite .",
    "however , since a fixed complex pole is assumed for any virtuality of the unstable particle , the resulting scattering amplitudes violate unitarity and do not correctly describe the lineshape of broad resonances .",
    "an alternative to the cms is the fermion - loop scheme  @xcite , which offers a solution for the restoration of unitarity , but yet does not give a complete description of unstable particles because the width of a heavy higgs is dominated by its decay into gauge bosons .",
    "a consistent treatment of the bosonic contributions is possible in the framework of the background field gauge @xcite , but this requires a calculation of the complete radiative corrections at a fixed loop order .",
    "these two approaches require greatly increase the complexity of the calculation .",
    "other suggested schemes for the treatment of unstable particles include the pole scheme @xcite , the seymour scheme @xcite , the use of an effective lagrangian including non - local interactions @xcite , and an approach based on collinear effective field theory  @xcite .",
    "summarizing , in general and especially for a heavy higgs , one would like to be able to include a running width in the propagator directly connected with the higgs self - energy and at the same time to respect gauge invariance and unitarity .    in this work",
    "we tackle the problem from an effective field theory ( eft ) point of view .",
    "we propose to systematically include width effects via a set of gauge invariant higher dimensional terms to the sm lagrangian , along the lines of what was first proposed in ref .",
    "such new operators systematically encapsulate higher order terms coming from the self - energy and naturally allow a running and physical width for the higgs in a gauge invariant way .",
    "as we will show in the following , our scheme is consistent at higher orders and it can be considered a generalization of the cms as it reduces to it in the limit where the dependence on the virtuality of the higgs self - energy is neglected .",
    "the two - point green s function for the higgs boson is @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the bare mass , and @xmath6 is the higgs self - energy . in the conventional on - shell definition ,",
    "the mass and width are given by    & m_h , os^2=m_h,0 ^ 2-re ( m_h , os^2 )  , + & m_h , os_h , os=  .",
    "these definitions become gauge - dependent at order @xmath7 .    in order to avoid the divergence of the tree - level propagator @xmath8 , one performs the dyson resummation to obtain @xmath9 to include the running effects of the width",
    ", one can further approximate the propagator by @xmath10 where the imaginary part of @xmath11 is related to the higgs - boson width .",
    "the consistency of the above treatments of the higgs propagator with the equivalence theorem and unitarity has been discussed by valencia and willenbrock @xcite .",
    "alternatively , as shown in a series of papers  @xcite a consistent , convenient and resilient definition of mass @xmath12 and width @xmath13 up to two loops , is obtained by setting @xmath14 and then solving the implicit equation @xmath15 in terms of @xmath16 .",
    "this gives a gauge independent definition to all orders @xcite ( independent of the gauge choice present in the computation of @xmath17 ) and in addition avoids unphysical threshold singularities @xcite .",
    "the above definition is also consistent with the use of the cms . in this scheme",
    "the propagator is @xmath18 . by definition",
    "this approach can give a good approximation of the full propagator @xmath19 only close to the pole or , equivalently , for a small width , @xmath20 . here",
    "@xmath21 is the renormalized self energy , satisfying the following renormalization conditions : @xmath22    a natural improvement would consist in including the full resummed propagator in explicit calculations .",
    "this , however , leads to gauge violation already at the tree level .",
    "the reason being that in perturbation theory gauge invariance is guaranteed order by order while the presence of a width implies the resummation of a specific subset of higher order contributions , the self - energy corrections .",
    "this results in a mixing of different orders of perturbation theory .",
    "in particular , the following issues need to be addressed : +    1 .",
    "in general @xmath6 explicitly depends on the gauge - fixing parameter ( gfp ) . to resum the self - energy correction to all orders",
    ", @xmath6 must be extracted in a physically meaningful way .",
    "the resummed propagator spoils the gauge cancellation among different diagrams , and eventually leads to the violation of goldstone - boson equivalence theorem and unitarity bound .",
    "both issues can be tackled by the so - called pinch technique ( pt ) @xcite . in the pt framework ,",
    "a modified one - loop self - energy for the higgs boson can be constructed by appending to the conventional self energy additional propagator - like contributions concealed inside vertices and boxes . for the application of pt in resonant transition amplitude , and",
    "in particular , the extraction of a physical self energy , we refer to the work of refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the modified self - energy correction for the higgs is gfp - independent , and reflects properties generally associated with physical observables . at the one loop level",
    ", we have the following expressions @xcite    [ eq : pipt1 ] ^(ww)_hh(s)&=b_0(s , m_w^2,m_w^2 )  , + ^(zz)_hh(s)&=b_0(s , m_z^2,m_z^2 )  , + ^(ff)_hh(s)&=(s-4m_f^2)b_0(s , m_f^2,m_f^2 )  , + ^(hh)_hh(s)&=b_0(s , m_h^2,m_h^2 )  , [ eq : pipt4 ]    where the superscripts denote the contributions from the @xmath23 , @xmath24 , fermions and higgs loops , and    b_0(p^2,m_1 ^ 2,m_2 ^ 2 ) & + ( 2)^4-d &    is the normal passarino - veltman function @xcite .",
    "these results are indepent of the gfp .",
    "note that the expressions in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : pipt1]-[eq : pipt4 ] ) coincide with the @xmath25 result obtained in the background - field gauge @xcite .    in addition , the gauge cancellation among different amplitudes can be restored , by including certain vertex corrections obtained via the pt   @xcite .",
    "this is because in this framework the green s functions satisfy the tree - level - like ward identities ( wi ) , which are crucial for ensuring the gauge invariance of the resummed amplitude .",
    "as an example , let us consider the higgs - mediated part of same helicity fermion scattering into longitudinal @xmath23 s , @xmath26 .",
    "there are contributions from @xmath27-channel and @xmath28-channel diagrams , as is shown in figure  [ fig:1 ] .",
    "the contributions from @xmath28-channel and higgs diagram to the amplitudes coming from longitudinal components of the @xmath23 s and same helicity fermions ( in the high energy limit ) read at high energy region . ]",

    "the ellipsis in @xmath31 denotes terms that are not related to the higgs exchange diagram .",
    "these terms come from the contribution of opposite helicity fermions , and are supposed to cancel the bad high - energy behavior of the @xmath32 mediated diagrams .    without the higgs contribution",
    "@xmath33 grows with energy and eventually violates unitarity .",
    "the cancellation of the bad high - energy behavior of each amplitude , and the equivalence theorem , are guaranteed by the following wi :    [ eq : wi1 ] & k_+^k_-^_^hww(q , k_+,k_-)= + & -m_w^2^h^+^-(q , k_+,k_-)+_h(q^2 ) ,    where @xmath34 are nambu - goldstone bosons .",
    "only the leading terms at high energy are included .",
    "the relation above explicitly shows that the inclusion of higher order terms in the imaginary part of @xmath35 has to be related to the ew corrections of @xmath36 and three scalar vertex .",
    "only if both @xmath37 and @xmath36 are computed in one - loop via the pt , then the wi remains valid , and the gauge - cancellation , as well as the equivalence theorem , are not spoiled .",
    "besides , @xmath38 is not affected by the higgs width and therefore the tree - level relations can be used .",
    "thus the resummed propagator can be consistently included with the one - loop correction to @xmath36 via the pt .",
    "even though correct , the solution outlined above for @xmath39 is not a general one . in @xmath40 , for example , it is not sufficient to include only the @xmath41 and @xmath42 corrections .",
    "the triple and quartic vector - boson vertices at one - loop are also required to cancel the bad high - energy behavior of the higgs - mediated amplitude and the overall procedure of analyzing the full set of wi s becomes more and more involved .",
    "the goal of this work is to present a simple method to generate the needed corrections to the vertices and propagators so that the wi s are automatically satisfied and unitarity automatically ensured .",
    "as explained above , we aim at finding a systematic approach to improve the higgs propagator without breaking either gauge invariance or unitarity . in other words",
    "we are looking for a mechanism that guarantees the constraints imposed by the wi to be satisfied at any order in perturbation theory .    at one loop , the full calculation via the pt certainly provides an exact solution valid at nlo .",
    "the challenge is to achieve the same keeping the calculation at leading order , including only the necessary ingredients coming from nlo and resumming them into the propagator via a dyson - schwinger approach .",
    "the idea is to associate the corrections to an ad hoc constructed gauge - invariant operator and match the operator to the one - loop two - point function @xmath37 calculated via the pt . in so doing one",
    "aims at obtaining the exact resummed propagator already at the leading order and , _ at the same time _ , the interactions modified to automatically satisfy the wi s .",
    "the latter desired result ensures the gauge - invariance of the amplitudes , and it can be considered as an approximation to a full one - loop calculation in pt .    to this aim",
    ", we consider the taylor expansion of the function @xmath43 @xmath44 where @xmath45 are dimensionful constants and , as first attempt , we add the following infinite set of operators to the lagrangian :    [ eq : op1 ] o_=&_i=0^c_i ^(-d^2)^i + & ^(-d^2 )    where @xmath46 is the higgs doublet , and @xmath47 is the covariant derivative .",
    "it is straightforward to check that @xmath48 modifies the higgs propagator as desired : the two @xmath46 s contribute two higgs fields , and each @xmath49 contributes an @xmath27 leading to @xmath50 as desired",
    ". note that in principle , @xmath48 is a non - local operator , yet by expanding it , we re - express it in terms of an infinite series of local operators . and therefore the real part of the propagator is not affected . ]",
    "we remark that while very similar in spirit , our approach differs from that of ref .",
    "@xcite : the operator chosen there does not contain gauge fields , and it is therefore not sufficient to restore the gauge cancellation and fix the bad high - energy behavior in vector - vector scattering .",
    "( [ eq : op1 ] ) leads to the correct expression for the propagator .",

    "( [ eq : pihh ] ) unchanged . the final form of the operator , which we dub @xmath53 , is @xmath54\\phi+\\frac{\\pi(0)}{2v^2}\\left[(\\phi^\\dagger\\phi)-\\frac{v^2}{2}\\right]^2\\,.\\ ] ] the addition of this operator to the sm leads to several changes , which we now consider in detail .",
    "first of all , by construction , it gives rise to the propagator in eq .",
    "( [ eq : prop ] ) , and a resummed propagator with the full one - loop self energy via the pt at tree level is obtained .",
    "second it leads to modifications of the other interactions , in such a way that gauge invariance is maintained .",
    "for example , the @xmath23 and @xmath24 two - point functions are modified by the addition of    i^_ww(q^2)=&i()^2 + i^_zz(q^2)=&i()^2    where @xmath55 is the higgs vev , and @xmath56 the values for the @xmath23 and @xmath24 masses are shifted    & m_w^2=()^2(1+(0 ) ) + & m_z^2=()^2(1+(0 ) ) , [ eq : eftmass ]    as well as the propagators @xmath57\\ , .",
    "\\label{eq : eftprop}\\ ] ]    let us first consider @xmath58 in the eft approach .",
    "the operator modifies the @xmath30 and the @xmath59 interactions .",
    "the combined effect is a factor of @xmath60 .",
    "therefore in this process the eft approach is equivalent to the following substitution of the higgs propagator : @xmath61 which behaves like @xmath62 at large energy , and therefore exactly cancels the high - energy behavior from @xmath31 .",
    "it is also interesting to note that , if @xmath11 has a linear dependence on @xmath27 , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath63 the above equation becomes @xmath64 and the eft approach coincides with the scheme proposed by seymour @xcite .",
    "this makes sense because in the seymour scheme the vector boson pair self energy also has a linear dependence on @xmath27 . in our scheme",
    "we see that the numerator of seymour s propagator comes from the modified @xmath30 vertex , as required by the wi .",
    "we now turn to vector - vector scattering and in particular to @xmath40 .",
    "this process features a pure gauge and a higgs - mediated @xmath27-channel contribution , fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] .",
    "both contributions do contain terms that grow as @xmath27 at high energy , whose cancellation is guaranteed by gauge - invariance . to calculate @xmath40 amplitude in the eft we need to extract the feynman rules from @xmath53 , _",
    "i.e. _ , the contributions that need to be added to the usual sm rules .",

    "these feynman rules are sufficient to calculate both @xmath69 and @xmath70 . at the leading order in @xmath71 and @xmath72",
    ", we find for @xmath69 ,    & m_h^llll=- + & m_gauge^llll = s    and for @xmath70 ,    & m_g=-    so that    m_h^llll+m_gauge^llll&=- + & = .",
    "as expected , @xmath73 does not grow with @xmath27 and the equivalence theorem is recovered , up to a factor @xmath74 ^ 2 $ ] , which exactly amounts to the wave function renormalization of the goldstone fields .",
    "an interesting feature of our approach is that in the limit where the dependence of @xmath11 on @xmath27 is neglected , @xmath75 is a constant , then @xmath76 .",
    "the only effect of the operator is a shift in @xmath77 , the coupling of the higgs - boson self interaction .",
    "if @xmath78 is the on - shell mass , this amounts to the replacement @xmath79 _ i.e. _ , given that @xmath80 can be a complex number , it is equivalent to the cms .",
    "the advantage of the eft approach is the possibility of using `` arbitrary '' functional form of the self energy .",
    "we have shown that with special choices of @xmath11 , the eft approach can reduce to the seymour scheme and the cms scheme in certain cases .",
    "for example , there is no need for spurious non - zero width for @xmath28-channel propagators as this can be easily imposed by always maintaining gauge invariance .",
    "finally , we note that despite the restoration of gauge - invariance and equivalence theorem is a general feature of our approach , one has to be careful in choosing the appropriate operator .",
    "for example , the following operator @xmath81 introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite , gives rise to the correct self energy and the resummed propagator , but it does not modify the gauge contribution , so in @xmath69 the gauge cancellation between the @xmath27-channel higgs - mediated amplitude and the gauge amplitude is not restored . on the other hand , it modifies the goldstone amplitude in a way so that the equivalence theorem is satisfied . as a result ,",
    "both @xmath69 and @xmath70 have bad high - energy behavior , and eventually break unitarity bounds . in general , adding higher dimensional operators to the lagrangian leads to unitarity violation at some scale .",
    "we are going to show in the next sections that the operators we use do not have this problem .",
    "though the above operator @xmath82 solely does not treat the @xmath42 and @xmath30 correctly at high energy , when combined with @xmath83 , we can adjust them in a certain way to improve this method",
    ". we will discuss this in the following sections .",
    "adding operators of dimension @xmath84 to the sm lagrangian @xmath85}{\\lambda^{n-4}}\\,,\\ ] ] is equivalent to recast the sm in terms of an effective field theory valid up to scales of order @xmath86 @xcite , beyond which the theory is not unitary .",
    "it is therefore mandatory to check whether this is the case for the operator @xmath87 .",
    "in fact , as we will see in the following section , a consistent perturbation theory implies that the same operator needs to also appear as a counterterm at higher orders .",
    "overall we do not modify the theory and our procedure amounts to a reorganization of the perturbative expansion .",
    "however , we still need to make sure that neither unitarity is violated nor double counting happens at any given order in the perturbation theory . in this section",
    "we consider the first of these issues by showing that in sample calculations , @xmath88 and @xmath89 , at tree - level the operator in eq .",
    "( [ eq : o ] ) does not break unitarity at large energy .    in @xmath90",
    "the change in @xmath91 vertex cancels the change in @xmath92 propagator at high @xmath27 , independently of the helicities of @xmath93 , so the @xmath27-channel higgs diagram does not lead to any bad high - energy behavior .",
    "the scattering of opposite helicity fermions does not entail the @xmath27-channel higgs diagram and is the same as in the sm .",
    "as we have already verified , in @xmath94 the longitudinal amplitude does not break unitarity , because the modification to the corresponding goldstone interaction is finite ( @xmath95 and @xmath96 ) .",
    "we now check the transverse amplitude @xmath97 , @xmath98 , @xmath99 , @xmath100 , in the limit    s~|t|~|u|m_w^2,m_h^2m_w^2 .",
    "( note that @xmath101 , @xmath102 , @xmath103 configurations do not feature a higgs in the @xmath27-channel and therefore are left unchanged . )",
    "an explicit calculation for @xmath104 gives    & m_h^++=m_h^llll+(m_w^4 ) + & m_gauge^++=m_gauge^llll+(m_w^4 ) ,    where @xmath105 indicates the amplitude with four longitudinal vectors .",
    "for @xmath106 we obtain    & m_h^ll++=m_h^llll+(m_w^2 ) + & m_gauge^ll++=m_gauge^llll+(m_w^2 ) ,    and for @xmath107 we obtain    & m_h^++ll = m_h^llll+(m_w^2 ) + & m_gauge^++ll = m_gauge^llll+(m_w^2 ) ,    these results vanish faster than the longitudinal amplitude at large @xmath27 .",
    "finally for @xmath108 , we obtain    m_h^++++&= -ig^2m_z^2 + ( m_w^4 ) + & ",
    "( s)~s^-1 + m_gauge^++++&=i8g^2c_w^2+(m_w^2 ) .",
    "so at large energy the inclusion of @xmath109 does not lead to any bad high energy behavior .",
    "starting at order @xmath110 , the operator @xmath111 is allowed in any leading order computation . at next - to - leading order in ew interactions , however , this is not necessarily consistent and possibly leads to double counting . in this section",
    "we argue that this is not a fundamental problem and can be dealt with by simply subtracting the same operator in a nlo as a counterterm , in full analogy to the procedure used in the cms @xcite .    in the cms ,",
    "an imaginary part is added to the real mass , and then subtracted as counterterm at nlo .",
    "one can prove that this procedure does not spoil the wi s , despite the fact that only a special class of higher order terms is resummed .",
    "as the eft approach can be viewed as a generalization to the cms , the same approach can be followed .",
    "the operator @xmath111 corresponds to the imaginary part of the mass .",
    "it includes some of the higher - order contribution , and provides an improved solution to the wi s .",
    "it enters the resummed propagator and other feynman rules , and needs to be subtracted at higher orders .",
    "the main difference is that in the cms the propagator describes an unstable particle with a fixed width , while in the eft approach one can resum an arbitrary part of the self - energy correction .",
    "this difference may be important when the width of the unstable particle is large , as in the case of a heavy higgs , and the actual functional form of @xmath11 becomes important .    in the pole - mass renormalization scheme ,",
    "the two - point function of the higgs can be written as @xmath112 where @xmath16 is the pole and @xmath21 is the one - loop pt self - energy correction renormalized in the pole - mass scheme .",
    "we can now define the eft approach by adding the operator in eq .",
    "( [ eq : o ] ) and subtracting it as a counterterm : @xmath113 in so doing the theory is exactly the same as before . now",
    "( [ eq:2point ] ) can be rewritten as    _ h(s)=&s - s_h+(s ) + & + [ ^r_hh(s)-(s ) ]    where the first line starts at leading order , while the second line starts at order @xmath110 .",
    "the eft approach then amounts to choose @xmath11 in a way to capture the important part of ( if not all of ) @xmath21 , so that this part of the self - energy correction is included at the leading order , and will be resummed . in practice",
    ", one does not have to choose the exact pt self energy , and gauge invariance is always guaranteed .",
    "in particular , choosing @xmath114 corresponds to the cms scheme .    in our scheme ,",
    "ew nlo calculations are obviously more involved .",
    "the resummed propagator ( [ eq : prop ] ) and the modified feynman rules do require extra work .",
    "however , one can also always employ a standard cms at nlo and only include the full propagators and vertices in the lo result . in this way we can consistently have leading order calculated in the eft approach , and nlo in cms but with counterterms from @xmath111 .",
    "in the eft approach , the exact functional form of the @xmath11 is somewhat arbitrary .",
    "ideally , one would like to use the imaginary part of the pt one - loop self energy , as given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : pipt1])-([eq : pipt4 ] ) .",
    "unfortunately , in @xmath89 this choice produces an unphysical excess at low energy .",
    "as mentioned above , such an excess can be avoided by incorporating the operator @xmath82 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : op2 ] ) .",
    "the reason for the excess is that the operator does not correctly describe the 1-loop @xmath91 vertices at low energy .",

    "this arrangement is satisfactory because we do not expect contributions from the goldstone vertex .",

    "the operator @xmath116 ( eq .  ( [ eq : op2 ] ) ) satisfies the equation with the saturation of the goldstone - higgs vertex , yet fails at describing the high energy behavior of weak boson scattering for example .",
    "the solution for this problem relies on the construction of a suitable combination of these two operators .",
