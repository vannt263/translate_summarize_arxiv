    "many treatments assume that the disc is aligned with the symmetry axis of the central object , although there is often no _ a priori _ reason for this .",
    "the first widely  studied case relaxing this restriction was the evolution of tilted discs around spinning black holes . until recently the standard picture of tilted disc evolution was that , in the regime where viscosity acts diffusively ( technically , @xmath2 ) , the inner disc would align or counteralign rapidly with the hole s spin , with a smooth warp to the still misaligned outer parts .",
    "this is often called the bardeen  petterson effect ( * ? ? ?",
    "* but note their equations do not conserve angular momentum ; see @xcite for detailed discussions of the correct equations ; and @xcite for the possibility of counteralignment ) .    in a recent paper , @xcite showed that this evolution can be very different for large inclinations of the disc and spin , and/or low values of the dimensionless viscosity coefficient @xmath3 @xcite . enforcing the connections imposed by conservation laws between the various components (",
    "` radial ' , and ` vertical ' ) of viscosity @xcite , @xcite showed that the viscous torques in the disc may be unable to communicate the lense  thirring precession efficiently enough to produce a smooth warp .",
    "instead one expects a sharp break in the disc plane between the aligned inner parts and the misaligned outer parts , connected only by tenuous rings of gas with inclinations changing rapidly across the break .",
    "we shall see from our eqn .",
    "[ crit ] below , that even if the viscosity coefficients remained constant with warp amplitude , the disc would still break for realistic parameters .",
    "@xcite show that an assumed break of this type remains stable in 3d simulations of such discs .",
    "@xcite show that inclined , partially counter ",
    "rotating gas orbits within an accretion disc lead to cancellation of angular momentum and thus subsequent accretion . the mass flow rate through the disc",
    "can , for a time , be increased by large factors up to @xmath4 times that of the corresponding disc with zero inclination .",
    "these results suggest that sufficiently inclined discs might break , and that if the precession rate of the inner and outer disc differs enough , discs rotating in opposed senses might interact and produce dynamical mass infall .",
    "we consider these questions in this letter .",
    "we ask + 1 ) for realistic parameters , can the lense  thirring torques exceed the local viscous torques in the disc ?",
    "+ 2 ) if they can , can we arrange the broken disc such that disc orbits counter  rotate ?",
    "here we estimate analytically the radius at which the disc is likely to break . this will give us an idea of the parameters which lead to breaking , and whether it is a common event .",
    "to break the disc , the torque resulting from the lense  thirring effect must overcome the local viscous torques , or equivalently , the orbits in the disc must precess faster than the viscosity can communicate the precession . to illustrate this point ,",
    "let us imagine the two extremes .",
    "if the viscosity is dominant , the precession is communicated throughout the disc instantaneously , and the whole disc precesses rigidly . at the other extreme where viscosity is negligible , orbits at different radii precess at different rates and the disc must break into many distinct rings .",
    "the nonlinear connection between effective viscosity coefficients , enforced by conservation laws @xcite , tell us that once a disc starts to break in this way , the viscosity evolves so as to reinforce the tendency to break @xcite .    to calculate the breaking radius for a given viscosity we can assume that the disc has no initial warp",
    ". then we can consider the usual viscous torque , and to a good approximation neglect the more complicated physics of a warped disc .",
    "the azimuthal viscous force per unit area in the disc is proportional to the rate of shear @xmath5 ( where @xmath6 is the radial coordinate and @xmath7 is the disc angular velocity ) and so can be written as @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the dynamical viscosity .",
    "the area of an interface in the disc is @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the disc vertical thickness .",
    "so the viscous force acting in the azimuthal direction is given by @xmath12 where we have substituted the dynamic viscosity for the kinematic viscosity @xmath13 , and used @xmath14 .",
    "the magnitude of the viscous torque @xmath15 is given by @xmath16 where the prime denotes the radial derivative .",
    "this is the usual viscous torque at the interface of two annuli in an accretion disc ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . for near",
    "keplerian rotation ( @xmath17 ) it becomes @xmath18    the lense  thirring precession induces a torque with magnitude @xmath19 where the lense  thirring frequency @xmath20 , the disc angular momentum density @xmath21 and @xmath22 is the angle between the angular momentum of the black hole and the disc .",
    "we assume the disc breaks when the lense  thirring torque tears gas off the disc faster than viscosity can make it spiral inwards , which requires @xmath23 making the standard assumption of a thin keplerian @xmath3disc @xcite and using @xmath24 , the radius at which we expect the disc to break is given by @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the gravitational radius of the black hole .    equation ( [ crit ] ) looks plausible ; it makes sense that at large viscosity , low spin or small inclination angles the disc can not be broken , i.e. @xmath27 .",
    "conversely , for low viscosity , high spin and/or large inclinations we expect the disc to break into distinct rings at some radius @xmath28 .",
    "the typical radius at which the disc breaks is given by @xmath29 where we have parameterized using quantities typical for agn discs .",
    "this radius falls within typical discs , suggesting that inclined discs near spinning black holes are quite susceptible to breaking .",
    "we caution that at extreme parameters this simple argument may not suffice to predict the behaviour of the system , although we expect the general behaviour to hold . in the next section",
    "we confirm the breaking of the disc with numerical simulations .",
    "these simulations are a preliminary investigation into this problem and we intend to follow up in more detail in future publications .",
    "let us consider an inclined disc that breaks under the action of a strong differential precession .",
    "its inner and outer regions precess almost independently at different rates .",
    "the precession timescale is much shorter than the alignment timescale , which must wait for precession to induce dissipation .",
    "so both the inner and outer discs retain their inclinations to the black hole spin .",
    "the outer disc remains almost unmoved , while the inner disc ( typically a ring of radial width @xmath30 ) precesses rapidly about the spin axis .",
    "if the angle @xmath22 between the outer disc and the hole spin lies between @xmath31 the inner ring must form an angle @xmath32 with respect to the outer disc after half a precession period .",
    "the rotational velocities are now partially opposed .",
    "this configuration is similar to those adopted in the counter  rotating disc simulations in @xcite and",
    "so must result in rapid accretion .",
    "we note the probability that a randomly oriented accretion event lies in the critical range of inclinations is given by the fractional solid angle as @xmath33 i.e. @xmath34% . in other words ,",
    "disc breaking and dynamical infall from counter ",
    "rotating accretion flows must be common in active galactic nuclei .",
    "it is also common in stellar  mass x ",
    "ray binaries if the spin of the black hole ( or neutron star ) accretor is sufficiently misaligned with the binary plane .",
    "we report two simulations of an inclined disc around a spinning black hole using the smoothed particle hydrodynamics ( sph ) code phantom ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "sph performs well in modelling warped discs @xcite finding excellent agreement with the analytical treatment of @xcite .",
    "this is to be expected as both treatments solve the navier stokes equations with an isotropic viscosity .",
    "the connections between the viscosity coefficients derived by @xcite therefore naturally holds in our numerical treatment . in the simulations reported here we implemented the lense  thirring effect , following @xcite .",
    "the simulations use a disc viscosity with shakura & sunyaev @xmath35 ( cf . * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , a disc angular semi  thickness of @xmath36 and the black hole has a spin @xmath37 .",
    "initially the disc has no warp and extends from an inner radius of @xmath38 to an outer radius of @xmath39 , with a surface density profile @xmath40 and locally isothermal sound speed profile @xmath41 where we have chosen @xmath42 and @xmath43 to achieve a uniformly resolved disc @xcite . the disc is initially composed of 2 million particles , which for this setup gives @xmath44 ( cf .",
    "the two simulations differ only by the relative inclination angle to the black hole .",
    "the simulation shown in fig .",
    "[ small ] has an initial inclination of @xmath45 , and thus @xmath46 , i.e. at a radius inside the disc s inner boundary , and so we do not expect the disc to break .",
    "this agrees with the simulation , which shows the usual ( bardeen  petterson ) evolution with a smooth warp .",
    "in contrast , the simulation shown in fig .  [ large ] has an inclination of @xmath47 and therefore @xmath48 , i.e. we expect the disc to break .",
    "the simulated disc does indeed break , producing multiple distinct rings of gas with large relative inclinations .",
    "this leads to phases of strong accretion when the rings are highly inclined , and quieter phases when they are not .",
    "the accretion rates for the two cases are shown in fig .",
    "[ accretion ] .     to the hole with no warp .",

    ", i.e. the dynamical time at the inner edge of the discs is @xmath50 .",
    "note this is the mass flow rate through @xmath51 and not the final accretion rate on to the black hole . ]",
    "we note that this evolution is more extreme than the 1d simulations reported in @xcite .",
    "however the numerical method used there assumed the gas always remained on circular orbits , evolving purely by viscous diffusion .",
    "this was appropriate for the problem studied there , namely , whether such a relatively orderly disc could break at all , given the nonlinear evolution of the viscosity predicted by @xcite .",
    "the current paper studies a dynamical problem , where the inclination of disc orbits can change so rapidly that viscous diffusion of gas in circular rings is no longer an adequate approximation .",
    "interestingly , @xcite did remark that their simulated disc rings appeared to be trying to break into more than one distinct plane .",
    "we first discuss the possible arguments against this picture .",
    "the main unknown in this work is the nature of the viscosity controlling angular momentum transport in the disc . in this paper",
    "we have assumed that this can be modelled as an isotropic shakura & sunyaev @xmath3 viscosity .",
    "there is a strong basis for assuming that the radial transport of angular momentum ( governed by the azimuthal viscosity ) is limited to @xmath52 @xcite and we expect discs around black holes to be very thin away from the immediate vicinity of the strongly accreting hole ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "however , the nature of the viscosity is unknown . in reality",
    "the local viscosity is likely to result from mhd effects @xcite , and may well be anisotropic .",
    "the azimuthal shear is likely to be secular , with gas parcels continually moving away from each other , whereas the vertical shear is probably oscillatory @xcite .",
    "this is suggestive of a favourable anisotropy where the vertical viscosity does not strongly oppose breaking , but the result is simply not known .",
    "the consistency requirements worked out by @xcite for a locally isotropic viscosity show that in a strong warp , the viscosity trying to hold the disc together is likely to weaken .",
    "there appears no reason to suggest this differs for an anisotropic viscosity .",
    "another possible complication is the thermal evolution of the gas .",
    "as the disc orbits do not all lie in the equatorial plane , they must shock and heat up . in the simulations above we have assumed an isothermal equation of state , so this extra heat is assumed to be radiated away instantly .",
    "this is reasonable , as the densities in black hole discs are high and cooling is likely to be efficient .",
    "however if the disc can not cool on the local precession timescale , it may heat up significantly so that eq .",
    "[ crit ] is no longer satisfied . in this case",
    "the disc may rapidly thicken , perhaps even becoming thermally unstable , and switch to a different mode of both accretion and warp propagation . on the other hand",
    ", @xcite found , in counter ",
    "rotating disc simulations using an adiabatic equation of state , that although the gas dynamics can be strongly modified by gas heating , the net result in terms of rapid accretion is similar .",
    "otherwise there appears to be no obvious reason why this behaviour should be suppressed .",
    "we therefore expect this to be generic to most cases of accretion on to black holes ( or neutron stars , since the lense  thirring effect applies here too ) , and more generally for the evolution of gas discs in the presence of a strong precession .",
    "we have shown that for realistic parameters a randomly oriented accretion event on to a spinning black hole is likely to form a disc which is susceptible to breaking at a radius close to the hole .",
    "if the angle between the disc and the hole lies between @xmath31 the interaction of partially opposed gas motions is likely , and leads to cancellation of angular momentum and rapid infall .",
    "this quasi  dynamical form of accretion , which appears to be a generic consequence of randomly oriented accretion on to a black hole , significantly alters the standard picture of slow viscous accretion .",
    "there is nothing to prevent a succession of events where rings break off the inner disc edge and then precess independently of those inside or further out ( see fig .",
    "[ large ] ) .",
    "it is reasonable to think of this process as tearing up the disc in a chaotic way .",
    "\\2 . in a stellar  mass binary system",
    "this means that tearing _",
    "modulates _ a quasi  steady mass transfer rate .",
    "the modulation might have large amplitude if the disc / spin inclination is high .",
    "even if the inclination is modest , there are likely to be observable effects which could include quasiperiodic behaviour such as quasiperiodic oscillations ( qpos ) .",
    "still more effects can occur if the infalling rings shadow the central x  ray source .",
    "by contrast , in active galactic nuclei , the viscous timescale of the outer disc may easily exceed a hubble time , and no steady state is ever set up . thus tearing of a significantly inclined agn disc",
    "may promote significant accretion when the central black hole would otherwise not gain mass at all .",
    "the torques we have considered here are all internal to the disc  black hole system .",
    "they can not affect any conclusions concerning the global conservation of angular momentum or mass of this system .",
    "in particular , considerations of the long  term evolution of black hole spin through accretion remain unchanged , whether the accretion is assumed to be coherent ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) or chaotic @xcite .",
    "we can expect qualitatively ( and sometimes quantitatively ) similar effects for other cases where an accretion disc is subject to a forced external differential precession .",
    "most obviously , @xcite have shown that the effective potential experienced by a disc accreting on to a misaligned binary , as is thought to occur when supermassive black holes are close to coalescence , is extremely similar to that caused by the lense  thirring effect . for initial inclinations",
    "near to co or counter  rotation the disc respectively coaligns or counteraligns ( for the subsequent evolution of prograde circumbinary discs see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and for retrograde circumbinary discs see @xcite )",
    ". however , disc tearing changes this picture and may well bring gas into the close vicinity of the holes on near  dynamical timescales , and thus help with the last parsec problem @xcite as well as feeding problems .",
    "\\6 . in general any black hole has some spin , and in general any accretion disc plane may be inclined to this spin . to prevent any of the effects",
    "we have discussed here from appearing , the misalignment must satisfy @xmath53 which is extremely small for realistic parameters . for example",
    ", a moderately thick disc with @xmath54 , @xmath55 and a low spin @xmath56 must be inclined by less than @xmath57 to avoid this process .",
    "we suggest that disc tearing , particularly in the inner disc , probably occurs in many if not most cases of black hole or non - magnetic neutron star accretion .",
