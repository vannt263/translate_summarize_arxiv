    "heterotic @xmath6 orbifold models @xcite are popular for string phenomenology and for physics beyond the standard model @xcite .",
    "heterotic toroidal abelian orbifolds are based on tori which are orbifolded by acting with discrete abelian groups @xmath7 or @xmath8 .",
    "this introduces mild singularities at the fixed points , which reduces the amount of parallelizable spinors and can thus lead to models with reduced supersymmetry in lower dimensions .",
    "compatibility with the discrete action fixes the complex structure of the underlying tori ( except for the case of @xmath9 ) .",
    "these models are based on free conformal field theories which allow for an exact treatment .",
    "orbifolds are at rather special points in the moduli space of string compactifications which exhibit enhanced symmetry . in particular , the primordial @xmath6 gauge group is broken rank - preservingly . furthermore , there are many discrete symmetries which can help solving problems inherent to most models beyond the standard model such as proton decay or the @xmath10-problem @xcite .",
    "this makes orbifolds phenomenologically attractive , but also rather special points , apparently isolated from each other and from smooth ( supergravity ) compactifications . in the last years",
    "there has been considerable progress connecting different orbifolds with their smooth supergravity counterparts @xcite ; however , the process has to be carried out for each orbifold separately .",
    "f - theory @xcite was introduced roughly ten years later as an approach to constructing string vacua which are connected via a web of dualities to type ii and heterotic string theories .",
    "while these dualities have been worked out for various dimensions of string compactification spaces , we focus on the case of orbifolds corresponding to singular k3 surfaces on the heterotic side , which correspond to f - theory models on ( elliptically fibered ) calabi  yau ( cy ) threefolds over a complex two - dimensional base space which is a hirzebruch surface @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "most commonly , the elliptically fibered cy threefolds are discussed in terms of a weierstrass model , in which the elliptic fiber is given in terms of an equation of degree 6 in the weighted projective space @xmath12 whose coefficients are sections in the base @xmath11 .",
    "generically , the elliptic fiber degenerates over codimension one subloci in the base .",
    "the resolution of the singularities were classified by kodaira @xcite in terms of the vanishing orders of the the coefficients @xmath13 , and the discriminant @xmath14 of the weierstrass equation .",
    "the resolution requires the introduction of @xmath15 s whose intersection numbers are those of the negative affine cartan matrix of the ade - type lie algebras . using f-/m - theory duality , it can be seen that the ade - type singularities give rise to precisely the same gauge group in f - theory .",
    "for this reason , we use the name of the singularity in the kodaira classification and the name of the resulting gauge algebra somewhat interchangeably .",
    "matter arises in codimension two where the singularity type of the fiber is further enhanced . in the meantime",
    ", there has been quite some progress in string phenomenology based on f  theory , ultimately motivated by the possibility to obtain exceptional groups and more general matter representations than in type iib intersecting brane models .",
    "similar to intersecting branes , however , much of the phenomenological work discusses local models , and global completions are much harder to construct .    for the f - theory duals of smooth models",
    ", there is a general algorithm for the construction @xcite .",
    "in contrast , f-/m - theory on singular spaces is less well understood @xcite .",
    "as we shall see , also in our case the tools from the smooth case can not be applied directly ( cf .  also @xcite ) .",
    "furthermore , as we shall explain , toroidal orbifolds do not have a direct weierstrass description . to circumvent this problem",
    "we will use a method used in @xcite to construct a weierstrass model and from that the heterotic ",
    "f - theory duality .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows : in section [ sec : review ] we review heterotic orbifold models , f - theory , and the construction of the duality . in the process , we compare to other methods used to construct the duals in the smooth case . in section [ sec : orbifoldduals ] we construct the f - theory duals of all four @xmath0 orbifolds in the `` standard embedding '' ( which means in the case of orbifolds that the discrete gauge bundle is @xmath7 , leading to a commutant of @xmath16 for @xmath17 or @xmath18 for @xmath19 , respectively ) and comment on cases with more general gauge embeddings . in section [ sec : conclusions ] we conclude and present an outlook .",
    "we consider heterotic orbifold compactifications to six dimensions on calabi  yau manifolds , which are singular limits of k3 .",
    "we study orbifolds of the type @xmath0 with @xmath20 .",
    "the spectra and gauge groups that can be obtained in these models without using wilson lines have been classified in @xcite .",
    "we collect the spectra of the standard embeddings in table [ tab : orbifoldspectra ] .",
    "we also included the spectrum of a @xmath21 orbifold where one wilson line in the first torus has been switched on .",
    "this wilson line has two effects : it breaks the gauge group further down ( while preserving the rank ) and it projects out some of the matter states which are incompatible with the wilson line .",
    "this leads to the fact that the spectrum at the various orbifold fixed points where the wilson line acts is different from the spectrum where the wilson line is trivial .    for our discussion",
    ", we will start with the most simple model , which is the standard embedding of @xmath0 with gauge group @xmath22 or @xmath23 .",
    "the orbifold acts on the two complex torus coordinates @xmath24 as @xmath25 in order to ensure modular invariance , a twist by @xmath26 in a @xmath0 orbifold in standard embedding is accompanied by a shift in the @xmath6 gauge degrees of freedom by @xmath27 . for the @xmath21 model",
    "this means that the orbifold acts as a reflection , @xmath28 and the associated shift breaks the gauge group to @xmath22 .",
    "the orbifold action introduces four fixed points in each torus , leading to @xmath29 @xmath9 ( or @xmath30 ) orbifold singularities , cf .",
    "figure [ fig : t4z2orbifold ] . comparing with table [ tab : orbifoldspectra ]",
    ", we see that there are eight @xmath31 .",
    "note , however , that the @xmath32 of @xmath33 is pseudo - real , so there are 16 half - hypers , i.e.  one per fixed point .",
    "likewise , there are 32 hypermultiplet doublets @xmath34 which are pseudo - real as well , leading to 4 half - hypers per fixed point . in contrast , the @xmath35 and the four singlets @xmath36 in the untwisted sector are not pseudo - real and thus are full hypermultiplets . also note that there is no matter charged under the second ( unbroken ) @xmath37 .",
    "it should be mentioned that the subtlety concerning pseudo - real representations mainly arise in the @xmath21 models .",
    "the reason is that the commutant of @xmath7 with @xmath37 for @xmath38 is @xmath39 rather than @xmath40 .",
    "for that reason , the other orbifold standard embeddings come with a 1 factor , and thus the irreps carrying 1 charge are complex ( but e.g.  the 5 singlets of the @xmath41 model are uncharged and correspond to 10 half - hypers at the 6 + 4 @xmath9 fixed points occurring in the second twisted sector of @xmath41 ) .",
    "in fact , in all cases where the number of states is half the number of equivalent fixed points the representations are pseudo - real , such that there is one half - hyper per fixed point .",

    "this leads to very stringent anomaly cancellation conditions .",
    "in particular , the gravitational anomaly reads @xmath55 where @xmath56 are the number of hyper- , vector- , and tensor multiplets .",
    "perturbative heterotic string models always have @xmath57 , where the scalar of the tensor multiplet is the dilaton . using and the other conditions ensuring the absence of gauge and mixed anomalies",
    ", it can be easily checked that the models in table [ tab : orbifoldspectra ] are anomaly - free .",
    "note that in contrast to 4d , the anomaly also depends on the singlets , i.e.  it is sensitive to the entire particle spectrum .",

    "we see that the @xmath127 fiber locus @xmath128 does not intersect the @xmath37 brane @xmath125 , since @xmath129 note that the monomial @xmath130 is in the stanley ",
    "reissner ideal and thus the two coordinates can not vanish simultaneously .",
    "furthermore , @xmath123 is just a number not equal to zero : if it were zero , @xmath131 at @xmath125 , which is too singular to allow for a crepant resolution .",
    "so there are no `` brane intersections '' , and we do not expect any charged matter . on the other hand ,",
    "the neutral hypers can be counted by the coefficients in the the polynomials : the total number of coefficients in the @xmath132 and @xmath133 is 509 .",
    "subtracting three for @xmath134 acting on the base coordinates and 14 for @xmath135 , @xmath136 , we end up with @xmath137 .",
    "hence , we reproduce the fully higgsed heterotic model .    furthermore , we used ` palp ` @xcite as a cross - check to calculate the hodge numbers of the elliptically fibered cy threefold over @xmath70 .",
    "we get @xmath138 and @xmath139 , and @xmath140 . by comparing with",
    ", we find indeed that the rank of the gauge group is @xmath141 , and there are 492 neutral hypermultiplets .",
    "the largest gauge group which can be obtained in perturbative string theory on the smooth heterotic side is when all instantons are embedded in the @xmath40 ( alternatively , one can think of only giving vevs to the @xmath34 but not to the @xmath31 .",
    "this case corresponds to an 2 bundle which leaves an unbroken gauge group of @xmath58 . in the process of higgsing",
    ", we break the @xmath40 and lose three hypers . from the spectrum in table [",
    "tab : orbifoldspectra ] , we see that we end up with @xmath143 @xmath32 s and @xmath144 singlets in that case .    in order to get an enhanced gauge group from the weierstrass model",
    ", we have to restrict the polynomials .",
    "it is rather straightforward to see that we can get an @xmath33 singularity if we set @xmath145 the determinant then factorizes as @xmath146 and we find an @xmath37 at @xmath125 , an @xmath33 at @xmath147 , and a smooth @xmath127 locus at @xmath128 since it does not factorize further .",
    "regarding the matter spectrum , it is clear that on the one hand we have lost neutral hypermultiplets from the complex structure moduli ( namely the ones in the polynomial we have set to zero ) , but on the other hand have gained charged matter from the resolution of the singularity enhancements where the `` branes '' intersect , i.e.  where the singularity in the fiber gets worse .",
    "explicitly , the remaining polynomials contain 69 parameters , but the reparameterizations that are left are just the ones on the base and a rescaling of @xmath79 ( since @xmath147 should be fixed ) .",
    "hence , we find @xmath148 neutral hypermultiplets .",
    "regarding the charged matter , we look at the reduced determinant , @xmath149 which intersects @xmath147 at 20 points on the base @xmath15 . at each of these intersection points ,",
    "we expect one half - hypermultiplet of @xmath32 , yielding 10 full @xmath32 hypers .",
    "since again @xmath79 and @xmath88 can not vanish simultaneously , we find no intersection of the @xmath33 with the @xmath37 curve or of the @xmath37 with the @xmath127 curve .    from the cross - check with ` palp ` we obtain @xmath150 and @xmath151 , which is consistent with our previous findings .",
    "we could now go back to the generic case by switching on vevs , or polynomials , which is basically the path outlined in @xcite .",
    "motivated by the previous results , our ansatz is to factorize @xmath126 further by choosing less generic polynomials such that we find an additional @xmath153 locus .",
    "in addition to the three extra vector multiplets , we should get three new hypermultiplets , which , together with the already - present 65 singlets of @xmath33 organize themselves into 32 doublets of @xmath40 plus four remaining singlets .",
    "however , we expect the following problems : first , from the orbifold analysis we expect fractional instantons : we need a total instanton number of @xmath60 , which should be divided evenly among the 16 @xmath9 fixed points which are the only loci of non - zero curvature .",
    "hence , each fixed point carries a fractional instanton number of @xmath154 .",
    "furthermore , these instantons , embedded in the first 8 , should not break the gauge group but only branch it to @xmath16 .",
    "second , the 2 doublets , the 7 charged matter , and the instantons are localized at the orbifold fixed points .",
    "this leads to a singularity at the intersection points in codimension two which is too severe for the usual rules of calculating the spectrum to apply .",
    "third , due to the homogeneity of the polynomials in @xmath126 , the extra 2 locus will be located at the zeros of a factor of the form @xmath155 , i.e.  we get a natural quantization of matter states in multiples of 12 arising from the @xmath77-scaling of @xmath70 . however , the multiplicity of @xmath35 is 1 and the multiplicity of @xmath34 is 32 , so neither is dividable by 12 .",
    "before we discuss how to tackle this problem in the next section , it is worthwhile to investigate other approaches to the duality to see how these problems arise there .      in a series of beautiful papers @xcite a connection between the data from the anomaly polynomial and the geometry of the cy threefold",

    "we can calculate the euler number of the ( smooth ) k3 @xcite by starting from the original singular space @xmath61 , subtracting the number of fixed points , dividing by the @xmath9 action , and gluing back in @xmath224 exceptional divisors @xmath225 : @xmath226 using @xmath227 , @xmath228 , @xmath229 , @xmath230 , we find that @xmath231 for @xmath232 and @xmath233 for @xmath234 .",
    "this means that the global compactification obtained by using this method does not result in the heterotic dual we want to construct case for example , one can show that this method produces only @xmath99 fixed points instead of the @xmath235 that we would expect from the orbifold , which is again consistent with a quotient k3@xmath236 rather than @xmath47 . ] .",
    "after having outlined why the previously considered constructions can not work in our case we now describe the approach we are following instead . in order to do so",
    "it is thus instructive to take a closer look at the duality @xcite .",
    "as explained in figure [ fig : cyfibration ] , we have a double fibration structure on the f - theory side . in particular , the heterotic k3 is essentially the base @xmath15 together with the elliptic fiber .",
    "this means that the `` middle '' terms in @xmath74 and @xmath75 , i.e.  the terms @xmath237 and @xmath238 should contain the geometric moduli of the heterotic k3 . indeed ,",
    "subtracting an overall scaling , we obtain @xmath239 moduli .",
    "likewise , the zeros of @xmath240 and @xmath123 correspond to the instantons in the two @xmath37 s .",
    "again , after subtracting an overall scaling , one obtains @xmath60 and @xmath92 , as it should be . to describe the fibration structure",
    "depicted in figure [ fig : cyfibration ] , we use similar methods to the ones described in @xcite .",
    "pictorially , the @xmath21 orbifold is a pillow with a torus over it everywhere except at the corners , where the fiber is a pillow itself , cf .  figure .",
    "any section will hit one of the fiber pillow corners at the base pillow corners .",
    "on the other hand , a weierstrass fiber torus always has one singularity ( at @xmath241 ) , not four , and a non - singular section at @xmath242 .",
    "hence we have to deform the orbifold in order to write it as a weierstrass model .",
    "the method of @xcite is to    * pick one section , * blow up the fiber singularities it hits ( such that we basically have a pillow where one of the corners is blown up to a smooth @xmath15 ) , * blow down the other finite - volume component of the fiber ( i.e.  the original pillow ) .    .",
    "over each base singularity there is an orbifold pillow with four @xmath9 singularities , corresponding to the affine dynkin diagram of @xmath243 . in the blowdown procedure , the central torus node ( blue )",
    "is blown down and one of the corner singularities ( red ) is blown up.,scaledwidth=90.0% ]    this procedure is summarized pictorially in figure [ fig : t4z2blowdownlimit ] . in this way we end up with a fiber with a @xmath244 singularity ( made up of three of the original pillow corners and the blown - down pillow itself ) , where the section sits at a smooth point .",
    "in particular , the affine node corresponds to one of the four corner singularities and the original orbifold pillow corresponds to the central ( adjoint ) node .",
    "note that the central node has multiplicity ( or dynkin label ) two .",
    "hence it is intersected by a two - section rather than a section .",
    "in contrast , after applying the above procedure , we obtain a finite component with multiplicity one , which can hence be hit by a section and thus should have a weierstrass model .",
    "this means we need to find a complex two - dimensional weierstrass model with four @xmath244 singularities .",
    "we start from the heterotic weierstrass model @xmath245 where we identify @xmath246 and @xmath247 and require the vanishing orders of @xmath248 to be @xmath249 at four points in the base ( cf .",
    "table  [ tab : kodaira ] ) .",
    "this fixes the weierstrass equation to @xmath250 here @xmath251 is a polynomial of degree four in @xmath84 , whose four zeros correspond to the position of the four fixed points in the base .",
    "the discriminant is @xmath252 so we clearly have four @xmath244 singularities at the roots of @xmath251 . as an additional check ,",
    "note that the complex structure @xmath253 is given in terms of the @xmath254-function by @xmath255 i.e.  it is constant but not fixed .",
    "this fits nicely with the @xmath9 orbifold , in which the complex structure is also not fixed since every lattice has a reflection symmetry .",
    "this orbifold argument fixes @xmath256 and @xmath257 .",
    "furthermore , we know that the @xmath60 instantons are located at the fixed points as well , which suggests @xmath258 .",
    "looking at , we see that we have fixed all polynomials except for @xmath259 . requiring that we find an extra @xmath40 symmetry forces us to take @xmath260 and to relate the numerical coefficients @xmath261 among each other . by rescaling and leaving @xmath123 and the coefficients in @xmath251 as free parameters",
    ", we then find    @xmath262    clearly , there is an extra locus of type @xmath153 fibers over @xmath263 .",
    "when looking at the spectrum , one has to be very careful as results may be different from what one naively expects .",
    "we present a discussion of the subtleties from different point of views .",
    "first we find that ( by construction ) still nothing intersects the @xmath37 curve at @xmath125 .",
    "however , the price to pay is that the @xmath33 curve , the @xmath40 curve , and the @xmath127 curve all intersect at the four points @xmath264 . this is to be expected since",
    "all matter ( except for the untwisted @xmath35 and the four singlets ) is localized at the orbifold fixed points located at the zeros of @xmath251 in the base .",
    "now comes the tricky part : the blowup of the singularities in the base seems to introduce new tensor multiplets ( whose singlets correspond to the blowup moduli ) , which would result in models with @xmath265 and thus would not be dual to a perturbative heterotic model . however , as argued by aspinwall and donagi in @xcite , the spectrum computation is much more subtle in this case .",
    "naively one might have expected that the orbifold is the limit in which the gauge bundle becomes concentrated at the orbifold singularities , leading to point - like instantons . however , these point - like instantons are not the same as the tangent sheaf ( albeit having the same support ) .",
    "the difference becomes apparent when looking at the spectral curve . in the former case it contains a reduced component while in the latter case it contains a fat line .",
    "this leads to different effects when resolving the singularities .",
    "in particular , in order to decide which of the multiplets ( tensor , gauge , and matter multiplets ) that are expected from the resolution actually do occur , one needs to investigate the corresponding extremal transitions . by studying a similar case ,",
    "the authors of @xcite find that the occurrence of extra tensor multiplets is indeed blocked , while the 2 together with the four half - hyper doublets do occur .",
    "the fact that the spectrum differs from the naive expectations can also be understood from the heterotic / m - theory duality .",
    "note that the instantons at the orbifold fixed points can not be `` ordinary '' point - like instantons which would correspond to m5 branes .",
    "these ordinary instantons do not break or branch the gauge group ; the corresponding new tensor multiplets balance the vector multiplets in the anomaly .",
    "this fits well with the fact that point - like instantons usually have trivial holonomy @xcite .",
    "in contrast , point - like instantons at orbifold singularities are expected to inherit the orbifold holonomy , which is fractional .",
    "this means that these instantons can ( and do ) branch the gauge group , removing some @xmath266-bosons from the spectrum . in order to still satisfy the anomaly constraint",
    ", no new tensor multiplets do occur .",
    "hence these point - like instantons with non - trivial fractional holonomy can not correspond to ordinary m5 branes . in some sense , these m5 branes with fractional holonomy are forced to sit at the fixed point with the same fractional holonomy and can not travel though the bulk ( which has trivial holonomy ) ; hence they can not be removed from the singularity and become ordinary m5 branes .",
    "the presence of spaces with singularities were studied in an m - theory description in @xcite .",
    "there , the singularities correspond to `` frozen singularities '' with discrete 3-form flux obstructing their resolution .",
    "it would be very interesting to construct these m - theory models directly and compare with the jacobian of the f - theory models as discussed in @xcite , which is however beyond the scope of the paper .    despite these complications ,",
    "we demonstrate that the spectrum can be determined based on counting arguments as it was done in section [ sec : dualitysmooth ] and is found to be as expected from the perturbative heterotic orbifold point of view . to determine the number of @xmath32 s",
    ", we note that after deforming the extra @xmath40 locus away by switching on coefficients in the polynomial , we are again in the `` minimally higgsed '' case described in section [ sec : dualitysmooth ] with @xmath201 @xmath32 s , which assemble into sixteen half hypers @xmath31 and one full hyper @xmath35 .",
    "the uncharged moduli correspond to the parameters left in the polynomials . on the heterotic side , there are four ( two are related to the size and two are related to the complex structure of the @xmath267 underlying the @xmath21 orbifold . on the f - theory side",
    "we find that there are @xmath235 parameters : @xmath268 , @xmath269 , @xmath270 , @xmath271 , @xmath123 and four parameters of @xmath251 .",
    "however , the zeros of @xmath251 are fixed as they correspond to the orbifold fixed point locations .",
    "in addition , the other parameters have to be related amongst each other for the extra @xmath40 locus to appear , which leaves us with four free parameters .",
    "in particular , the complex structure of the base torus depends on a combination of @xmath268 and @xmath269 , cf .  .",
    "finally , the doublets of @xmath40 are related to those deformations of the original polynomials @xmath259 , @xmath272 , @xmath240 , @xmath273 , and @xmath274 that destroy the @xmath40 locus . as discussed in section [ sec : dualitysmooth ] , these have @xmath275 parameters out of which one is an overall scaling , so there are @xmath276 .",
    "out of these four respect the @xmath40 symmetry ( i.e.  the four singlets ) , so @xmath277 parameters destroy the extra @xmath40 locus .",
    "these @xmath277 correspond to the 64 half - hypers @xmath34 .      in terms of the stable degeneration limit",
    ", this means that the 24 @xmath127 fibers that generically intersect the divisor @xmath213 are grouped into four groups with 6 @xmath127 s each , leading to four @xmath1 singularities .",
    "since the discriminant vanishes with order 1 along an @xmath127 and with order @xmath99 along an @xmath1 , we see that all 24 @xmath127 fiber components are used in this limit . along the divisors",
    "@xmath214 we keep an @xmath37 fiber and along the divisor @xmath216 we split the @xmath37 into @xmath16 .",
    "when blowing up the central node in each of the @xmath1 , we obtain the 16 @xmath153 singularities of the @xmath21 orbifold .",
    "it is not possible to obtain 16 @xmath153 directly , as this would require @xmath278 @xmath127 fibers , but in a k3 there are only 24 .    of course the techniques outlined here",
    "can also be applied to other @xmath0 orbifolds , which we will discuss now in turn .",
    "we start with discussing the orbifold .",
    "it has nine @xmath279 ( or @xmath280 ) fixed points ( three per @xmath281 plane , cf .  figure [ fig : t4z3orbifold ] ) and two twisted sectors , @xmath282 this means that if we distribute the instantons again evenly , we have @xmath283 instantons per fixed point or @xmath284 per resolution @xmath15 . in order to be able to mod out the @xmath279 orbifold action , the complex structures of the two @xmath281 have to be fixed to @xmath285 . for the spectrum ,",
    "this means that there are two moduli ( completely uncharged singlets ) corresponding to the overall sizes of the tori .",

    "each fixed point has one @xmath32 and seven singlets , both charged under the @xmath39 .",
    "furthermore , there is another @xmath32 and another charged singlet in the untwisted sector .",

    "this time , however , the procedure takes us from nine @xmath280 singularities to three @xmath111 ones , cf .",
    "figure [ fig : t4z3blowdownlimit ] .",
    "the dynkin label of the original finite ( central ) component is @xmath102 and thus should be intersected by a three - section , while after applying the procedure , we obtain a finite component with multiplicity 1 , which can be described as a weierstrass model with a single section .",
    "the vanishing orders of @xmath287 and @xmath288 in the heterotic weierstrass equation should be @xmath289 and @xmath98 at three points to obtain an 6 .",
    "but clearly @xmath287 is not the cube of any degree - three polynomial , so we have to set @xmath290 ( note that indeed the vanishing order for @xmath111 is @xmath291 , not necessarily equal ) on the other hand , we can easily set @xmath292 to obtain a vanishing order of 4 at three points in the base .",
    "this has the nice effect that the the complex structure of the fiber is given by @xmath293 i.e.  it is fixed to @xmath285 , just as it should be for the @xmath279 orbifold .",
    "hence we have fixed @xmath294 and @xmath273 .",
    "going further , we note the interpretation of @xmath240 as the instanton location implies that we should have @xmath295 , since we have 24 instantons equally divided between the three singularities , i.e.  eight per singularity . on the other hand , @xmath259 is again not fixed . however , by comparing to the minimally higgsed case and to the @xmath9 orbifold results , we find that each zero of @xmath259 contributes one @xmath32 half - hypermultiplet , which have to combine into full hypermultiplets in this case since their 1 charge forces them into complex representations , so we make the ansatz @xmath296 . the zeros of @xmath297 should then correspond to the untwisted @xmath32 , while the @xmath298 gives rise to the twisted @xmath32 s . as in the @xmath9 case",

    "here we group the 24 @xmath127 fibers into a group with 10 @xmath127 s , a group with 8 @xmath127 s , and a group with @xmath99 @xmath127 s , resulting in one @xmath4 , one @xmath3 , and one @xmath1 singularity intersecting @xmath213 , which uses up all 24 @xmath127 fibers as in the previous cases .",
    "again , we keep the @xmath37 fiber along @xmath214 and split the @xmath37 along @xmath216 into @xmath18 .",
    "when blowing up the central nodes , we obtain 1 @xmath361 , 4 @xmath300 , and 5 @xmath153 singularities , whose direct construction would require 28 @xmath127 fibers .      as a last step we want to discuss orbifold models with wilson lines .",
    "if on turns on wilson lines at the orbifold , they further branch the gauge group and project out some of the matter states . as an example",
    ", we will discuss the @xmath21 orbifold where one wilson line @xmath362 along one of the torus directions ( say @xmath363 ) has been switched on in addition to the standard embedding shift vector @xmath364 . as a result",
    ", the @xmath365 @xmath9 fixed points located at @xmath366 do not feel the wilson line and behave as if it was not switched on , while the other @xmath100 @xmath9 fixed points at @xmath367 feel both the shift and the wilson line . as a result",
    ", we get a gauge group of @xmath368 with the matter content given in table [ tab : orbifoldspectra ] .",
    "note that the @xmath40 corresponds to the factor branched off the @xmath33 , while the @xmath369 corresponds to the  original ",
    "@xmath40 of the above @xmath9 example . at the @xmath100 fixed point where the wilson line does not act ( corresponding to the upper line in the third column of the @xmath21 case in table [ tab : orbifoldspectra ] ) , the spectrum is simply branched , which means that @xmath370 . at the other @xmath100 fixed points",
    ", it has been calculated using the standard cft techniques .",
    "hence the discussion is not as symmetric as in the first case .",
    "nevertheless , the idea is similar .",
    "one starts with an @xmath371",
    "( i.e.  @xmath372 ) singularity at @xmath147 with vanishing orders @xmath373 and an @xmath37 singularity at @xmath125 and factorizes the discriminant further by restricting the polynomials until two further @xmath153 loci appear which correspond to the two @xmath40 s .",
    "the resulting expressions @xmath74 , @xmath75 , @xmath14 then are of the form    @xmath374    where the @xmath375 are ( fixed ) numerical constants that are determined such that the discriminant factorizes into two quadratic pieces plus a rest and that the terms containing @xmath376 and @xmath377 cancel from the discriminant , enhancing @xmath244 to @xmath378 .",
    "we thus obtain an @xmath37 singularity at @xmath125 , a @xmath378 singularity at @xmath147 and two @xmath153 singularities at @xmath379 .    applying the methods described in section [ sec : otherconstructions ] does again not give rise to the `` correct '' orbifold limit . using table [ tab : grouptheorycoefficients ] , we find @xmath380 as expected , the @xmath371 and the two @xmath40 s are in the same divisor class @xmath381 , and the @xmath37 is in the divisor class @xmath382 .",
    "we thus find that @xmath383 neglecting again the normalization such that fractional instantons can arise we find that @xmath384 , @xmath385 , @xmath386 , which gives the correct spectrum .",
    "so far we have restricted our discussion to the case where all instantons are embedded in one @xmath37 . in an orbifold with general gauge shift and wilson lines ,",
    "both @xmath37 s will be broken .",
    "such models can also be connected to the ones we discussed here via a sequence of blowups and blowdowns in the base @xcite . by blowing up an extra point in the base",
    ", we can get from @xmath387 to @xmath388 . the corresponding picture in the hoava ",
    "witten picture of m - theory @xcite is the following : the blowup in the base introduces an extra tensor multiplet ; the scalar of this tensor multiplet encodes the position of on m5 brane in the m - theory bulk ( i.e.  on the interval between the two @xmath37 branes ) .",
    "thus by blowing up and blowing down , we can `` peel off '' an m5 brane from one @xmath37 ( blowup ) , let it travel through the bulk , and absorb it at the other @xmath37 brane ( blowdown ) , changing the instanton embedding in this way . for the analysis",
    ", this means that the expansions in have to be done such that they are compatible with the new scalings .",
    "the geometry of the singularity structure does not change , and the terms in the expansions can still be identified with bundle and geometry data @xcite .",
    "in this paper we investigated heterotic models compactified on singular k3 spaces corresponding to abelian toroidal orbifolds @xmath0 and argued that all these models can be connected via f - theory .",
    "for the sake of simplicity we concentrated on the standard embedding of these orbifolds , in which one @xmath37 is broken rank - preservingly to either @xmath16 or @xmath389 and the other @xmath37 is left unbroken .",
    "first we discussed previous approaches for constructing f - theory duals of smooth heterotic k3 models and argued why these approaches can not be used .",
    "for the construction of the duals , we first had to describe the geometry of the @xmath0 models on the heterotic side .",
    "having singular fibers by itself over singularities in the base , the description led to fibers with singularities of the type @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 . by calculating the @xmath390 function of these fibers",
    ", we found that the complex structure of the orbifold torus is free in the @xmath21 case , fixed to @xmath391 in the @xmath47 and @xmath53 case , and fixed to @xmath302 in the @xmath51 case , as needed for compatibility with the orbifold action .",
    "we found that in these constructions the node corresponding to the `` orbifold pillow '' in a fiber above a @xmath7 singularity in the base has multiplicity @xmath339 .",
    "furthermore , the distribution of the fractional instantons over the @xmath7 fixed points in the base is @xmath392 .    by blowing down the `` orbifold pillow '' and blowing up one of the dynkin nodes with multiplicity one",
    ", we could go to a weierstrass description of the model . using the information about the instanton embeddings and the singularities of the geometry on the heterotic side",
    ", we could tune the complex structure parameters on the f - theory side such that the defining quantities @xmath87 of the f - theory weierstrass model have the vanishing orders needed to reproduce the gauge groups on the heterotic side .    however , the resulting models were too singular to apply the usual spectrum calculation rules of f - theory .",
    "the reason is that ( most ) matter and instantons are living at the singularities on the heterotic side and thus all components of the discriminant on the f - theory side vanish at the fixed point loci of the heterotic dual .",
    "nevertheless , by counting parameters and deforming the singularities away to connect to the ( partially higgsed ) smooth model , we argued that the f - theory spectrum coincides with the spectrum on the heterotic side . using the strong constraints imposed by 6d anomaly cancellation , we could further cross - check the spectrum .",
    "the results obtained from the counting agree with the ones obtained by aspinwall and donagi in @xcite for f - theories with orbifold singularities in the fiber .    in the end , we investigated more general gauge sectors with wilson lines and configurations in which both @xmath37 s were broken on the heterotic side and argued that these can be obtained by further specialization of the complex structure moduli in the cy threefold combined with blowups and blowdowns in the base @xmath387 .",
    "in particular , the geometry on the heterotic side and the gauge group and matter content in each @xmath37 are described by the complex structure on the f - theory side , while the instanton embedding on the heterotic side corresponds to blowups and blowdowns in the base on the f - theory side .",
    "this means that heterotic orbifold wilson lines map to complex structure parameters ( and not to wilson lines ) on the f - theory side .",
    "it should be noted that the methods we applied here for the description of the geometry of the singular k3 compactifications could in principle also be applied to cy threefolds on the heterotic side ( of course there the anomaly cancellation conditions are weaker , which makes cross - checking the f - theory matter spectrum harder ) .",
    "it would be very interesting to see which of the @xmath393 and @xmath394 orbifolds are connected via f - theory on cy fourfolds .",
    "in addition , one could work out the description of the heterotic orbifolds and their f - theory duals directly using multisections as recently explored in @xcite rather than constructing the weierstrass model using the blowup and blowdown procedure , and match the results .",
