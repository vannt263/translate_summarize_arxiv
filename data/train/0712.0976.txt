    "spontaneous protein folding is a dynamic process , which starts after the generation of the dna - encoded amino acid sequence in the ribosome and is in many cases finished , when the functional conformation , the native fold , is formed .",
    "as this process takes microseconds to seconds , a dynamical computational analysis of an appropriate microscopic model , which could lead to a better understanding of the conformational transitions accompanying folding  @xcite , is extremely demanding . since protein folding is a thermodynamic process at finite temperature , a certain folding trajectory in the free - energy landscape is influenced by brownian collisions with surrounding solvent molecules .",
    "therefore , it is more favorable to study the kinetics of the folding process by averaging over an appropriate ensemble of trajectories .",
    "a significant problem is that the complexity of detailed semiclassical microscopic models based on force - fields and solvent parameter sets ( or explicit solvent ) rules out molecular dynamics ( md ) in many cases and , therefore , markovian monte carlo ( mc ) dynamics is a frequently used method for such kinetic studies .",
    "it is obvious , however , that the time scale provided by mc is not directly comparable with the time scale of the folding process .",
    "it is widely believed that the folding path of a protein is strongly correlated with contact ordering  @xcite , i.e. , the order of the successive contact formation between residues and , therefore , long - range correlations and memory effects can significantly influence the kinetics .    a few years ago , experimental evidence was found that classes of proteins show particular simple folding characteristics , single exponential and two - state folding  @xcite . in the two - state folding process , which is in the focus of the present study ,",
    "the peptide is either in an unfolded , denatured state or it possesses a native - like , folded structure .",
    "in contrast to the barrier - free single - exponential folding , there exists an unstable transition state to be passed in the two - state folding process . due to the comparatively simple folding characteristics , strongly simplified",
    ", effective models were established .",
    "knowledge - based models of g - like type  @xcite were investigated in numerous recent studies  @xcite . in g - like models",
    "the native fold must be known and is taken as input for the energy function .",
    "the energy of an actual conformation depends on its structural deviation from the native fold ( e.g. , by counting the number of already established native contacts ) . by definition ,",
    "the energy is minimal , if conformation and native fold are identical in all degrees of freedom involved in the model .",
    "the simplicity of the model entails reduced computational complexity and also md simulations , e.g. , based on langevin dynamics  @xcite , can successfully be performed .    in this paper , we follow a different approach .",
    "we also study a g - like model , but it is based on a minimalistic coarse - grained hydrophobic - polar representation of the heteropolymer . the basic idea behind coarse - graining is the introduction of a mesoscopic length scale , i.e. , the reduction of microscopic details , in order to classify heteropolymers with respect to their folding characteristics .",
    "the assumption is that , if there is some sort of universality in folding processes , then an effective model should allow for a general description of the qualitative folding behavior .",
    "in fact , in a recent work we could show that two - state folding , folding through intermediates , and metastability are inherent tertiary folding processes which can also be found in folding studies  @xcite of the simple hydrophobic - polar ab model  @xcite . in this context",
    ", it is quite interesting that also secondary structures are intrinsic geometries of polymer - like objects , even on a mesoscopic scale  @xcite .",
    "in the following , we consider the hydrophobic - polar heteropolymer sequence @xmath0 , where the @xmath1 s indicate hydrophobic monomers and the @xmath2 s polar ( hydrophilic ) residues . for our comparative model study",
    ", we employ the physically motivated ab model  @xcite and a knowledge - based model of g type  @xcite , which is referred to as the gl ( g - like ) model throughout the paper .    in the ab model ,",
    "the energy of a conformation @xmath3 with @xmath4 monomers , where @xmath5 denotes the spatial location of the @xmath6th monomer , is given by @xmath7 where the first term is the bending energy and the sum runs over the @xmath8 bending angles @xmath9 ( @xmath10 ) between monomers @xmath11 , @xmath12 , and @xmath13 of successive covalent bond vectors which have length unity .",
    "the lennard - jones type potentials depend on the types of the interacting monomers ( @xmath14 ) and on their spatial distance @xmath15 and represent the influence of the specific ab sequence on the energy .",
    "the long - range behavior is attractive for pairs of like monomers and repulsive for @xmath16 pairs of monomers : @xmath17 in this model , the ab heteropolymer with sequence @xmath18 experiences a hydrophobic collapse transition which is signalized by the peak in the specific - heat curve plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : cv ] .",
    "the transition between random coils and native - like hydrophobic - core conformations is a ( pseudo)phase separation process and the folding transition of two - state ( folded / unfolded ) type . in particular , for such systems it is known from model studies of realistic amino acid sequences that knowledge - based g type models reveal kinetic aspects of folding and unfolding processes reasonably well  @xcite .",
    "= 8.8 cm    for performing kinetic studies of @xmath18 in the simplified hydrophobic - polar approach as well , we use the ( putative ) global - energy minimum , identified in energy - landscape paving ( elp ) minimizations  @xcite of the ab model  @xcite , as input for the definition of a hydrophobic - polar gl model .",

    "this means , `` energy '' in the gl model plays rather the role of a similarity or `` order '' parameter and is , therefore , not a potential energy in the usual physical sense ( as there is no physical force associated with it ) .",

    "the free overall energy scale @xmath33 was chosen such that @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is the total number of native contacts .",
    "the definition of a native contact requires the introduction of a cutoff radius , which we chose as @xmath36 .",
    "this entails @xmath37 for the native conformation @xmath19 , and therefore @xmath38 .",
    "the choice of the cutoff radius is not very sensitive with respect to the results , provided it is not too small .    for the thermodynamic analyses , we performed parallel tempering simulations  @xcite and for the kinetic studies , a standard implementation of the metropolis monte carlo method was used .",
    "chain updates were performed employing the spherical - cap updates as described and parametrized in ref .",
    "a sweep consists of @xmath39 sequential bond vector update trials .",
    "= 8.8 cm    for the study of the folding transition , the introduction of an effective parameter is useful which uniquely describes the macrostate of the ensemble of heteropolymer conformations .",
    "a widely used measure is the contact number @xmath40 which is for a given conformation @xmath41 simply defined as the fraction of the already formed native contacts @xmath42 in conformation @xmath41 and the total number of native contacts @xmath43 in the final fold , i.e. , @xmath44 .",
    "then , the statistical ensemble average of this quantity @xmath45 at a given temperature characterizes its macrostate .",
    "roughly , for a two - state folder , if @xmath46 , native - like conformations are dominating the statistical ensemble . if less than half the total number of contacts is formed , the heteropolymer tends to reside in the pseudophase of denatured conformations .",
    "note that folding transitions are not sharp phase transitions in the thermodynamic sense as the heteropolymer sequence is of finite length and can not be extended .",
    "another suitable parameter is the angular overlap parameter  @xcite which has been proven to be extremely useful in the characterization of heteropolymer folding channels in the ab model  @xcite .",
    "if all virtual bond and torsion angles of two conformations , to be compared with each other , coincide , it is unity and between 0 and 1 otherwise .",
    "the advantage is that it is particularly useful for classifying intermediate or metastable structures with stable , but nonnative contacts . in fig .",
    "[ fig : ov ] , the fluctuations of both parameters , i.e. , @xmath47 and @xmath48 , respectively , are plotted as functions of the temperature for the gl model of sequence @xmath18 .",
    "we clearly see that the temperature region of conformational activity as signalized by these two `` order '' parameters coincides with the thermally active region indicated by the peak of the specific heat , which is also shown for comparison .",
    "the folding temperature , i.e. , the temperature of maximum activity , is @xmath49 .",
    "= 8.8 cm    = 8.0 cm    the classification of the heteropolymer with sequence @xmath18 as two - state folder arises from the analysis of the free - energy landscape .",
    "we assume that @xmath50 is a suitable parameter that describes the macrostate of the system adequately . considering this parameter as a constraint",
    ", we can formally average out the conformational degrees of freedom and the probability for a conformation in a macrostate with contact parameter @xmath51 reads @xmath52 where @xmath53 denotes the unrestricted partition function .",
    "the integral measure is simply @xmath54\\prod_{i=1}^{n-1}[\\delta(|r_{ii+1}|-1)]$ ] .",
    "expression  ( [ eq : pofq ] ) can be used to define a free energy as function of the @xmath50 parameter by @xmath55 since the value of @xmath50 is a qualitative measure for the macrostate the system resides in , the minimum of the free energy at a given temperature @xmath56 is related to the dominant macrostate in the canonical ensemble at this temperature . actually , as can be read off from fig .",
    "[ fig : fofq ] , the folding transition of the heteropolymer with sequence @xmath18 is a phase - separation process , i.e. , at the transition point close to @xmath49 , the folded and the denatured pseudophase coexist and the transition state barrier possesses a local maximum close to @xmath57 , as expected for a typical two - state folding characteristics .",
    "a useful measure of structure formation is the radial distribution function and its dependence on temperature . due to translational invariance in the three - dimensional space ,",
    "three degrees of freedom contribute only a volume factor to the partition function .",
    "therefore , we utilize this by fixing the position of the first monomer , @xmath58 .",
    "thus , we measure radial distances @xmath59 of the other monomers with respect to the first one and we define the radial distribution function as @xmath60\\right ) \\right\\rangle\\ , .\\ ] ] note that we have excluded @xmath61 as , by definition , the virtual covalent bonds are rigid and , therefore , @xmath62 . actually , from our definition , @xmath63 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : rad ] , the radial distribution functions of @xmath18 are shown for ( a ) the lowest - energy conformation and the ensembles at different temperatures in the ( b ) ab model and ( c ) gl model . although the global - energy minimum conformation shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : gem ] does obviously not form a regular crystal structure , the lennard - jones like interactions in combination with the rigid virtual bonds induce preferable substructures , favoring , e.g. , bond angles of @xmath64 , @xmath65 , and @xmath66  @xcite . therefore , the peaks of the radial distances from the first monomer for the global energy minimum conformation in fig .",
    "[ fig : rad](a ) can be partly explained by these local segments .",
    "the first peak at @xmath67 is related to the minimum potential distance between two nonbonded @xmath1 monomers ( and the reference monomer at @xmath68 is of type @xmath1 ) .",
    "also the location of other peaks can be deduced from fig .",
    "[ fig : gem ] by similar geometric arguments .",
    "= 8.8 cm    = 17.6 cm    the temperature dependence of the peak evolution is shown for the ab model in fig .",
    "[ fig : rad](b ) and for the gl model in fig .",
    "[ fig : rad](c ) . as a first result",
    ", we see that there is nice coincidence not only in the location of the peaks , but also in the fact that their is no indication of intermediary , weakly stable conformations .",
    "actually , the folding characteristics is similar in both models , at least from the thermodynamic point of view . at high temperatures , random - coil conformations",
    "dominate : there is no significant structuring in the radial distribution function . passing the folding transition temperature , local ,",
    "planar structures form first , before the tertiary , three - dimensional ordering towards the native conformation occurs .",
    "the advantage of the simple gl model for two - state folding is that it enables likewise kinetic studies of folding _ and _ unfolding events .",
    "in fact , this is the main purpose of this knowledge - based model , because kinetics studies of physically motivated models are typically computationally extremely demanding .",
    "this is unfortunately also the case for folding studies employing the ab model .",
    "a striking example is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : native ] where for a folding event the gray - scale coded average probability of native - contact formation is plotted for the original ab model [ fig .  [ fig : native](a ) ] and the gl model [ fig .",
    "[ fig : native](b ) ] .",
    "the average was taken over a `` time '' window @xmath69 $ ] with @xmath70 mc steps . the darker a bar , the higher the probability that the associated contact is formed .",
    "as the simulation was carried out in the folding regime , the probability of native - bond formation increases with the number of total mc steps .",
    "it is , however , obvious that the folding is much slower using the ab model , whereas in the gl model most of the native contacts have already been formed after 80000 mc steps .",
    "the native conformation of the considered sequence possesses partly kind of zig - zag structures , or `` turns '' ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : gem ] ) .",
    "the folding of these segments is particularly simple and the probability of the formation of the associated native contacts of monomers @xmath6 with monomers @xmath71 or @xmath72 increases much faster than for the other contacts .",
    "but even in this case , the gl kinetics is unbeatable .",
    "this example exhibits the dilemma of physics - based models in studying kinetic aspects of structure formation by means of computer simulations .",
    "it is a notoriously difficult problem , because the time scale of molecular dynamics is typically too small to see folding events , but also markov chain monte carlo dynamics of physical models is typically too slow . just for kinetic aspects , where absolute time scales are widely irrelevant , knowledge - based gl models are an alternative that allow for increasing the sampling efficiency , at least for systems with simple folding characteristics ( as , for example , two - state folding ) . actually , for such models an adequate statistical sampling of ensembles close to the transition state can be achieved by sophisticated monte carlo methods where efficiency is typically gained by simulating generalized ensembles at the expense of an artificial dynamics .",
    "therefore , it is widely believed that free - energy - driven dynamics , as it is relevant for protein folding , can reasonably be provided only by boltzmann - markov chains of conformational updates .",
    "one possibility to achieve this is the application of a conventional metropolis monte carlo method .",
    "although the overall time scale is left open , this method allows for comparative folding ( unfolding ) studies at various temperatures .",
    "the kinetics of the folding ( unfolding ) transitions is thereby obtained by averaging over sufficiently many folding ( unfolding ) trajectories .",
    "= 8.8 cm    in fig .",
    "[ fig : fold ] , snapshots of a single gl folding event of the heteropolymer with sequence @xmath18 at @xmath73 are shown at different times @xmath74 .",

    "the grayscales are linearly interpolated in - between these boundaries .",
    "although there are periods of relaxation and local unfolding , a stable intermediate conformation is not present and the folding process is a relatively `` smooth '' process .",

    "[ fig : foldb ] , where the temporal averages of the similarity parameters @xmath50 and @xmath79 , and of the energy @xmath80 are shown .",

    "this result also demonstrates that the description of the folding and unfolding transitions from the kinetic point of view is not only qualitatively , but even quantitatively consistent with the thermodynamic results from the canonical - ensemble analysis .",
    "it is not the purpose of this manuscript to perform a coarse - grained analysis of the two - state folding characteristics of a specific , real protein .",
    "rather , we have shown that   although also only exemplified for a single sequence   it is actually useful to study thermodynamic and kinetic properties of mesoscopic peptide models without introducing atomic details . the main focus of such models",
    "is pointed towards general features of the folding transition ( measured in terms of `` order '' parameters being specific for the corresponding transition , such as , e.g. , the contact and overlap parameters investigated in our present study ) that are common to a number of proteins behaving qualitatively similarly .",
    "it is then furthermore assumed that these proteins can be grouped into classes of certain folding characteristics .",
    "the sequence @xmath18 used in our paper is not obtained from a one - to - one hydrophobic - polar transcription of a real amino acid sequence .",
    "we do not think that such a mapping is particularly useful .",
    "rather , @xmath18 is considered as a representative that exhibits two - state folding characteristics in the coarse - grained model considered here .",
    "this implies , in general , that the classification of peptide folding behaviors is not necessarily connected with detailed atomic correlations and particular contact - ordering .",
    "it is rather an intrinsic property of protein - like heteropolymers and can thus already be discovered employing models on mesoscopic scales  @xcite .",
    "several proteins are known to be two - state folders and their folding transitions exhibit the features we have also seen in our present coarse - grained model study",
    ". a famous example is chymotrypsin inhibitor 2 ( ci2 )  @xcite , one of the first proteins , where two - state folding characteristics has experimentally been identified .",
    "clear signals of a first - order - like folding - unfolding transition were also seen in computational g model analyses of that peptide  @xcite .",
    "it is clear , however , that a precise characterization of the transition state ensemble , which is required for a better understanding of the folding ( or unfolding ) process of a specific peptide ( e.g. , secondary - structure formation or disruption in ci2  @xcite ) , is not possible . in the models used in our study , for example",
    ", only tertiary folding aspects based on hydrophobic - core formation are considered as being relevant .",
    "nonetheless , as shown in our study of sequence @xmath18 , macroscopic quantities or cooperativity parameters manifest a qualitatively similar behavior of the heteropolymer considered here , compared to real two - state folders .",
    "in this study , we have analyzed the folding thermodynamics and kinetics of a knowledge - based hydrophobic - polar g - like ( gl ) model for heteropolymers at a mesoscopic scale . for a given sequence , the native conformation and the peak temperature of the specific heat as obtained from the physically motivated ab model",
    "were used to parametrize the gl model . since",
    "the chosen sequence was known to exhibit two - state - like folding characteristics in the ab model , the definition of the corresponding gl model is appropriate for kinetic folding studies , which are very time consuming with the ab model itself .",
    "the reason is that the metropolis monte carlo method we used for the kinetic studies , is responsible for trapping effects and slowing down the markovian dynamics of the physical model .",

    "thermodynamic and kinetic properties were found to be even quantitatively consistent .",
    "the advantage of such simplified , coarse - grained models is that they enable a more global , generalized view on the physics of conformational transitions accompanying protein folding processes .",

    "<S> we present results of monte carlo computer simulations of a coarse - grained hydrophobic - polar g - like heteropolymer model and discuss thermodynamic properties and kinetics of an exemplified heteropolymer , exhibiting two - state folding behavior . </S>",
    "<S> it turns out that general , characteristic folding features of realistic proteins with a single free - energy barrier can also be observed in this simplified model , where the folding transition is primarily driven by the hydrophobic force . </S>"
