    "rx  j0720.4 - 3125  @xcite , is one of the best studied isolated neutron stars whose x - ray emission is dominated by radiation from the hot neutron star surface .",
    "their x - ray spectra are best described by blackbody emission with @xmath0  ev , but the emitting areas seem to be significantly smaller than the canonical neutron star surface .",
    "this suggests that the x - ray emission is coming from a small , hot , fraction of the neutron star @xcite , or may not be pure blackbody radiation , but instead the result of emission from a reflective condensed matter surface @xcite .",
    "recently it was observed that the isolated neutron stars rx j1308.6 + 2127 and rx j1605.3 + 3249 exhibit broad absorption features that may be caused by proton cyclotron absorption @xcite .    the spectral behavior of rx  j0720.4 - 3125  is even more surprising .",
    "early observations with _",
    "chandra _",
    "@xcite and _ xmm - newton _",
    "@xcite are consistent with a blackbody - like spectrum , but subsequent observations by _ xmm - newton _  indicate a slow evolution of the spectrum between 10 - 38   , resulting in deviations from a planckian spectrum .",
    "the deviations consist of a flux decrease at wavelengths longer than @xmath1 , and a flux increase at shorter wavelengths @xcite .",
    "the nature of the emerging spectrum is not clear ( modified blackbody , cyclotron absorption in combination with a hotter blackbody ? ) , nor is it clear what causes the emission properties to change . in @xcite",
    "we suggested that rx  j0720.4 - 3125  is precessing , which causes us to observe the hot region of the star under a continuously different angle .",
    "this requires that the surface emission is anisotropic , and may alter as result of traversing a magnetized atmosphere @xcite .",
    "whatever the underlying mechanism , it is clear that the spectral evolution of rx  j0720.4 - 3125potentially provides clues to the nature of the x - ray surface emission from isolated neutron stars , whereas the fact that the spectrum evolves may have implications for the structure of neutron stars , e.g. if the evolution is a consequence of precession . in order to further monitor its spectral evolution , and to investigate the spectrum for @xmath2    with high spectral resolution",
    ", we were granted director s discretionary time ( ddt ) on _ chandra _  for observing rx  j0720.4 - 3125  with the low energy transmission grating spectrometer ( letgs ) in combination with the hrc - s ( high resolution camera ) microchannel plate detector .",
    "in this letter we report on the analysis of this observation .",
    "we show that the spectrum has continued to evolve : it has further hardened , but the attenuation at long wavelengths has disappeared .",
    "_ chandra _  observed rx  j0720.4 - 3125  for 35  ks on february 27 , 2004 ( obs .",
    "i d 5305 ) as part of its ddt program . for our analysis",
    "we used the cleaned event list available from the _ chandra _  x - ray center .",
    "spectral extraction and ancillary response files were made using the standard _",
    "chandra _",
    "reduction package ciao v.3.0.2 . for comparison we also analyzed the longest archival letgs observation , made on february 2 , 2000 ( obs .",
    "i d 745 , see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and the six archival _ xmm - newton _  reflective grating spectrometer ( rgs ) data sets discussed in @xcite .    the letgs ddt spectrum is shown in fig .  [ ddt ] .",
    "the spectrum is clearly harder than the letgs spectrum of february 2000 .",
    "this confirms the discovery of spectral evolution of rx  j0720.4 - 3125  @xcite .",
    "however , it is clear that the source has continued to evolve since the last _ xmm - newton _  observation of 27 october 2003 , as the attenuation of the emission above 23   , which increased with time and was very prominent in the last rgs spectrum , has almost disappeared .",
    "in fact , unlike the last rgs spectrum both letgs spectra can be fitted reasonably well with pure blackbody models , but with different temperatures .",
    "the new spectrum requires a hotter blackbody temperature of @xmath3  ev than that of february 2000 , which is best fitted with a temperature of @xmath4  ev .",
    "the precise values for temperature depend on the modeling assumptions ( table  [ bbody ] ) , e.g. whether we allow the interstellar absorption to vary from one observation to another ( columns @xmath5  free ) or whether we fit the two spectra simultaneously , forcing the absorption parameters for the two models to be equal .",

    "however , we do not want to overemphasize this .",
    "first , it may be the result of calibration uncertainties regarding the instrument sensitivity .",
    "secondly , assuming that the additional component is real and caused by thermal emission , a very cool blackbody is required ( @xmath20  ev ) , with an emitting area too large for a neutron star , corresponding to a radius of @xmath21  km ( following * ? ? ?",
    "* we assume here , and throughout the rest of the text a distance of 300  pc ) .",
    "the observed increase of the emission above 23    with respect to the last rgs observation is very interesting , but also somewhat unfortunate , as the broad spectral range of the letgs would have allowed to put better constraints on the spectral shape of the low energy attenuation .",
    "for instance , @xcite showed that the deviations from a blackbody spectrum apparent from the _ xmm - newton_-rgs spectra , could be either modeled by a broad gaussian absorption component , or by a blackbody modified by a multiplicative power law .",
    "@xcite favored the characterization by a power law times a blackbody , as it provided good fits to the data with fewer parameters : apart from the blackbody parameters , only the power - law slope had to be determined .",
    "although there is no clear physical rational for such a model , the spectral evolution could be characterized by just one parameter : the power - law slope . changing the power - law slope results in a simultaneous hardening and supression of long wavelength emission , which describes well the spectral evolution up to october , 2003 , see fig .",
    "[ flux ] .",
    "ergs@xmath22@xmath23 ( 23 - 38   ) and @xmath24  ergs@xmath22@xmath23  ( 10 - 23   ) . ]    the alternative spectral model discussed in @xcite , a blackbody with gaussian absorption , e.g. caused by proton cyclotron absorption , has three additional parameters : central energy , @xmath25 , width , @xmath26 , and normalization .",
    "such a model has been considered by @xcite for rx j1605.3 + 3249 , and for rx  j0720.4 - 3125  by @xcite , who found a central energy of 271  ev and width @xmath27  ev .",
    "reanalyzing the rgs spectra for this study , and simultaneously fitting all spectra with a blackbody model with gaussian absorption with one central energy and width gives @xmath28  ev ( 40.5   ) and @xmath29  ev . the central energy is outside the rgs spectral range and the width is so large that , as far as the rgs spectra are concerned , the gaussian absorption component is indistinguishable from an exponential absorption feature .",
    "however , the rgs spectra are inconsistent with the best - fit gaussian parameters found by @xcite , mainly because the rgs spectra require a broader absorption feature than a gaussian absorption with @xmath27  ev .",
    "whatever the best model to describe the deviations from a blackbody spectrum , the new letgs spectrum breaks the trend that a spectral hardening is accompanied by a decrease of long wavelength emission .",
    "the flux in the spectral range from 10 - 90   has slightly increased since february 2000 by 8% , but the best - fit parameters of the blackbody model imply that the total blackbody flux has hardly changed . taken at face value this would imply that the emission area must have decreased ( table  [ bbody ] ) .",
    "it is of interest that apart from a long term change in the spectrum , _ xmm - newton _  ccd spectroscopy indicates that the spectral shape is also a function of pulse phase @xcite , and is in itself also subject to evolution @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , the rgs timing resolution ( @xmath304  s ) is not sufficient to check the shape of the long wavelength attenuation as a function of pulse phase . on the other hand ,",
    "the timing resolution of _ chandra _ s hrc - s detector is @xmath31  ms .",
    "we therefore folded the events of both the february 2000 and 2004 observation with the 8.3911  s period ( see * ? ? ? * for the latest timing results ) , and added a timing offset in order to align the folded light curves so that the maximum emission occurs at phase 0.25 and the minimum at 0.75 .",
    "we then extracted spectra for the phase bins 0.125 - 0.375 and 0.625 - 0.875 ( fig .",
    "[ phases ] ) .",
    "apart from an obvious variation in brightness between on and off peak , the overall shapes of the spectra do not change much . in order to test this",
    "we statistically compared the two spectra for each observation by direct comparison of the countrates per spectral bin .",
    "we assumed that the spectra are the same in both phase bins , except for a normalization factor .",
    "the best fitting normalization factors , i.e. the ratio in flux between on and off peak emission , are @xmath32  ( feb .",
    "2000 ) and @xmath33 ( feb 2004 ) , which is consistent with previous published pulse profiles @xcite . comparing the on peak spectra with the off peak spectra multiplied by the normalization factor we obtained respectively @xmath34  and @xmath35 , which corresponds to probabilities of 8% and 27% that on and off peak spectra are similar .",
    "our limits for variations are still consistent with the results of @xcite , who found variable absorption of the order of @xmath36@xmath5@xmath37  @xmath23 .",
    "note that although the letgs has a higher spectral resolution , the _ xmm - newton _  ccd instruments have a much higher effective area .",
    "phase resolved spectroscopy with the letgs does , however , indicate that whatever the phase dependent spectral changes , they must be rather subtle and are probably caused by broad features .",
    "following the discovery of long term spectral changes in the x - ray emission of rx  j0720.4 - 3125  by _ xmm - newton _ , the new _ chandra _  ddt observation shows that the x - ray spectrum of rx  j0720.4 - 3125  has continued to evolve .",
    "in particular the spectrum has remained hard from october 2003 to february 2004 , but , somewhat unexpected , the attenuation of emission at wavelengths longer than 23     has disappeared .",
    "a simple minded explanation would be that part of rx  j0720.4 - 3125  surface must have heated up in the course of the last 4 years , initially accompanied by absorption , but which disappeared between october 2003 and february 2004 .",
    "the absorption mechanism could be proton cyclotron absorption , as was invoked to explain the broad absorption features in the spectra of other isolated neutron stars .",
    "however , such an explanation is not completely consistent with the evolution of the spectrum of rx  j0720.4 - 3125 .",
    "first of all , if the surface is heated up by a starquake @xcite , or by increased accretion from the interstellar medium , we would expect that an additional hot spot at the surface would appear , or that the existing hot spot would become hotter . as a result",
    "the total blackbody flux would increase .",
    "this is , however , in disagreement with our best - fit blackbody parameters and the flux decrease between 45 - 55    ( fig .",
    "[ ddt ] ) .",
    "note that heating as a result of accretion from the interstellar medium is also unlikely given the the high proper motion of the neutron star ( @xmath38  mas / yr , * ? ? ?",
    "our suggestion that the spectral evolution of rx  j0720.4 - 3125   is due to precession @xcite , can at least qualitatively explain the results .",
    "it assumes that the emission remains unchanged , but that we see the hot spot under different viewing angles .",
    "free precession has been observed in some pulsars ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "recently @xcite has calculated the expected precession period caused by an oblique magnetic field and magnetic stresses in the neutron crust .",
    "his model requires a type ii superconducting interior .",
    "the expected precession period scales as @xmath39 , with @xmath40 the rotation period . for rx",
    "j0720.4 - 3125 , which has an inferred magnetic field of @xmath41  g @xcite , the expected precession period is @xmath42  yr , which is consistent with the timescale of the spectral evolution .",
    "moreover , _",
    "xmm - newton _  ccd spectra indicate that a modulation of the spectrum with pulse phase is present , and the fact that pulsation can be observed at all requires anisotropic surface emission @xcite . as the phase modulation of the spectrum also implies a spectral change with viewing angle , it is not unreasonable to assume that precession gives rise to a similar modulation of the spectrum with precession phase .",
    "theoretically a strong effect of the viewing angle on the observed spectrum from a highly magnetized atmosphere is to be expected .",
    "the reason is that protons and electrons in the neutron star atmosphere are constrained to move along the magnetic field lines .",
    "this results in radiation that is strongly polarized and angle dependent .",
    "this is further enhanced for magnetic fields",
    "@xmath43  g , for which vacuum polarization becomes important .",
    "this is a quantum electrodynamics effect that changes the polarization mode as the photon traverses a density gradient @xcite .",
    "the new _ chandra _  observation is not able to confirm that the attenuation has an approximate gaussian shape , as may be expected for proton cyclotron absorption .",
    "however , as the spectrum of rx  j0720.4 - 3125continues to evolve , future _",
    "chandra_-letgs observations may be able to constrain the spectral model further .",
    "long term monitoring is necessary to test the precession idea , since it implies a cyclic spectral evolution .",
    "@xcite suggested that rx  j0720.4 - 3125  is an off - beam radio pulsar .",
    "if it is indeed precessing , there is a possibility that at some point during its cycle the radio beam will be directed toward the earth .",
    "finally , we point out that other isolated neutron stars may show similar behavior , indicative of precession . further observations of those sources is therefore important for increasing our understanding of both the hot surface of neutron stars and for probing their internal structure .",

    "harvey tananbaum for allowing rx  j0720.4 - 3125  to be observed as part of the ddt program , and for his continued interest in the results .",
