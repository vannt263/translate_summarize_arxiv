    "heavy neutrino is one of the most interesting new physics candidates .",
    "what makes this particle promising is the well - established fact that the neutrinos are massive .",
    "the most simple and natural way to account for the neutrino masses is introducing gauge - singlet fermions into the standard model .",
    "in such a theory , the left - handed neutrinos @xmath8 ( @xmath9 ) are often mixed with the gauge - singlet fermions after the electroweak symmetry breaking , such that @xmath10 here @xmath8 denote the flavor eigenstates of the left - handed neutrinos , @xmath11 is the maki - nakagawa - sataka matrix , @xmath12 stand for the mass eigenstates of the ordinary neutrinos ( @xmath13 ) , @xmath14 is the heavy neutrino , and @xmath15 is the active - sterile mixing which rules the strength of the gauge interactions for @xmath14 with @xmath16 . in this paper , we shall consider one heavy neutrino just for simplicity . ] .",
    "there is yet another motivation to consider the heavy neutrinos , namely , the baryon asymmetry of the universe .",
    "it is known that a ( nearly ) degenerate pair of heavy neutrinos in the mass range @xmath17 can account for the baryon asymmetry of the universe through the oscillation taking place in the early universe  @xcite .",
    "contrary to the standard leptogenesis  @xcite with the heavy neutrino masses around the grand unification scale , this mechanism predicts the heavy neutrinos testable by terrestrial experiments  @xcite .    having these strong motivations , ship  @xcite and dune  @xcite are planning dedicated searches for heavy neutrinos .",
    "these experiments will explore hitherto unexplored ranges of parameters far beyond the current bounds , as flagships of hidden particle searches in the coming decades .",
    "until physics run of these projects turn on , it would be desirable to have alternative searches with shorter - term ability .",
    "the heavy neutrinos are efficiently produced by muon and/or meson decay just like the ordinary neutrinos .",
    "thus a relevant question is if we can employ some existing or forthcoming facilities in high intensity frontier .    in this paper , we focus on the comet experiment  @xcite  a dedicated experiment for the @xmath0-@xmath1 conversion search  as an example of such an idea .",
    "the comet experiment plans to stop @xmath18 muons on the target in phase - i  ( phase - ii )  @xcite . with these enormous numbers of muon , this experiment is potentially capable of discovering heavy neutrinos in unexplored parameter range beyond the strongest bound set by the ps191  @xcite .",
    "the details are the followings .",
    "the comet experiment searches the @xmath0-@xmath1 conversion process by looking for the single electrons of @xmath19 energy coming out from the muonic atoms .",
    "the experimental site is in the hadron experimental hall of j - parc .",
    "the muon beam is produced from the pions following after the collision of the bunched @xmath20 proton beam with a graphite target .",
    "the pions are efficiently captured by the pion capture solenoid . in phase - i ,",
    "the muons are stopped in an aluminium target after the first @xmath21 bend of the muon transport solenoid .",
    "the target is surrounded by the cylindrical drift chamber ( cdc ) . in phase - ii ,",
    "the muon transport sector is extended and the stopping target is placed after the second @xmath21 bend .",
    "the detector section is also extended so as to select the electron s momenta by the electron transport solenoid .",
    "see ref .",
    "@xcite for more details . in",
    "what follows , we shall focus on the phase - i detector setup .    about 60% of the stopped muons",
    "are captured by the aluminium nuclei , changing themselves into the muon neutrinos @xmath22 .",
    "the rest 40% of the muons decay in orbit-@xmath1 conversion , but this is of course negligible in the study of the heavy neutrinos . ] .",
    "suppose for simplicity that the heavy neutrino is in the mass range @xmath23 and predominantly couples to muons , namely @xmath24 .",
    "in what follows , we focus on this parameter regime unless otherwise stated . then the daughter @xmath22 produced by the above two processes is `` replaced '' with the heavy neutrino @xmath14 at the rate @xmath25 .",
    "namely , when @xmath26 muons are stopped , @xmath27 heavy neutrinos are produced .    within this parameter range ,",
    "the main decay mode of @xmath14 is @xmath28 and the subdominant mode is @xmath29 .",
    "the latter subdominant mode is detectable if the electron pair hit the cdc with sufficient energies . a schematic view of the decay event is shown in fig .  [ event ] .",
    "since the energy of the parent heavy neutrino @xmath14 is almost equal to the muon mass @xmath30 , typical energy of each electron is @xmath31 .",
    ".breakdown of the heavy neutrino signal acceptance . for the timing window",
    "we examine two options of @xmath32 or @xmath33 . [ cols=\"<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     the decay width of each process is given by @xmath34 the fraction for the latter detectable mode is @xmath35 . in the final state .",
    "those include the distributions of the invariant mass , the visible energy , the opening angle , etc .",
    "] let us assume that the neutrinos are the majorana particles .",
    "then the lifetime of @xmath14 is given by @xmath36 @xmath37 .",
    "the decay length for the detectable mode is @xmath38 , where @xmath39 .",
    "when we pick up @xmath40 and @xmath41 which are on the ps191 bound for example , the signal decay length becomes @xmath42 .",
    "the decay length is seemingly too long , and one may think the detection is a formidable task .",
    "however , with a detector of @xmath43 length , the probability that a heavy neutrino decay in the detector region is @xmath44 .",
    "this means if we can gather @xmath45 heavy neutrinos @xmath46 events are expected to be observed .     and @xmath47 .",
    "the dotted curve labeled `` ps191 '' is the 90% cl limit placed by ps191  @xcite .",
    "the dashed curve labeled `` @xmath48 '' is the bound placed by the peak search in kaon decay  @xcite .",
    "the left panel shows the case where the timing acceptance @xmath49 is taken as @xmath32 .",
    "the right panel shows the case where @xmath50.,title=\"fig : \" ]   and @xmath47 .",
    "the dotted curve labeled `` ps191 '' is the 90% cl limit placed by ps191  @xcite .",
    "the dashed curve labeled `` @xmath48 '' is the bound placed by the peak search in kaon decay  @xcite .",
    "the left panel shows the case where the timing acceptance @xmath49 is taken as @xmath32 .",
    "the right panel shows the case where @xmath50.,title=\"fig : \" ]    the number of events is estimated by @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the number of the muons stopped in the target , @xmath53 is the path length that heavy neutrinos across the cdc , @xmath54 is the decay length for the signal mode @xmath55 , and @xmath56 is the acceptance factor .",
    "the path length @xmath53 depends on the production point and the flight direction of the heavy neutrino . in what follows we simply set @xmath57 , where @xmath58 is the difference between the inner and outer radius of the cdc  @xcite .",
    "the acceptance factor is the product of the several factors such as geometrical acceptance , timing window , trigger efficiency , etc .",
    "for these factors we use the same numbers as the @xmath0-@xmath1 conversion case  @xcite except for the geometrical acceptance and the timing window . for the geometrical acceptance",
    ", we assume that `` longitudinal heavy neutrinos '' will not leave detectable signals , where longitudinal heavy neutrinos mean those who are going through the up and down - stream ends that are not covered by the cdc .",
    "this estimates 70% of the heavy neutrinos are acceptable .",
    "as for the timing window , we examine two options of @xmath32 and @xmath33 , where @xmath32 is the same number as the @xmath0-@xmath1 conversion case . on the other hand , the number @xmath33 is meant as a potentially available number for the heavy neutrino search without the timing window , since it leaves characteristic @xmath59 pair which may not need a strict separation from the beam - related backgrounds .",
    "the breakdown of the acceptance factor is presented in tab .",
    "[ tab1 ] for @xmath14 is estimated by @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the inner radius of the cdc .",
    "the time @xmath62 becomes significant only when the heavy neutrino mass is in the vicinity of the muon mass .",
    "that is , @xmath63 for @xmath64 .",
    "thus , in most cases , the heavy neutrino events belong to the bursts after @xmath65 from the prompt timing  @xcite . ] .",
    "[ bounds ] shows the 90% cl limits when the comet experiment observes null event .",
    "the left panel shows the case where the timing acceptance @xmath49 is taken as @xmath32 , while the right panel shows the case where @xmath50 .",
    "the solid curves show the comet limits in each panel .",
    "the dotted curve labeled `` ps191 '' is the 90% cl limit placed by ps191  @xcite .",
    "the dashed curve labeled `` @xmath48 '' is the bound set by the peak search in kaon decay  @xcite .",
    "although the event estimation by eq .",
    "( [ eventn ] ) is applicable only for the phase i whose goal is @xmath66 , we also put the curve for @xmath47 to get an idea how good the whole comet project is , under the assumption that the phase ii setup can keep the same performance for the heavy neutrino search .",
    "we conclude from fig .  [ bounds ]",
    "that the heavy neutrino search with the comet experiment is an idea with good potential .",
    "it is important to note , however , that the curves in fig .",
    "[ bounds ] are drawn under the assumption that the heavy neutrinos exclusively contribute to the detections of @xmath59 pair .",
    "a potential background is the @xmath59 pair creation by gamma rays . according to ref .",
    "@xcite , the radiative muon capture @xmath67 and the radiative pion capture @xmath68 are followed by @xmath69 .",
    "when these follow - up pair creations take place in the cdc volume , they mimic the heavy neutrino signal .",
    "more detailed and precise analysis may thus need a thorough understanding of the pair creation by gamma rays inside the cdc volume .",
    "a possible way to reject these background is selecting the directions of the @xmath59 momenta . for the @xmath59 creation by gamma rays coming from the inner region than the cdc volume , the momenta of @xmath59 tend to be outgoing for the momentum conservation . on the other hand , the @xmath59 from the heavy neutrino decay can be emitted to ingoing directions at significant rates .",
    "the typical @xmath70 factor of @xmath59 in the @xmath14 rest frame is @xmath71 , whereas the gamma factor of @xmath14 in the laboratory frame is @xmath72 .",
    "hence , roughly speaking , if @xmath73 , namely if @xmath74 , then @xmath59 can head in the opposite directions from the heavy neutrino momentum . in such a mass regime distributions for the momentum direction may help to reject the background .",
    "if we relax the assumption @xmath24 so that the tau flavor mixing @xmath75 takes part in the game , the signal decay width becomes proportional to @xmath76 instead of @xmath25 . in this case",
    "[ bounds ] should be read as a plot for the combination @xmath77 .",
    "when we consider the full parameter space @xmath78 , the thing gets more complicated , owing to the fact the signal decay @xmath79 is conducted by both of the charged and the neutral currents .",
    "however , the electron component @xmath80 is much more severely constrained than the other two parameters  @xcite .",
    "the plots in fig .  [ bounds ] ( with the replacement mentioned above ) therefore cover all the cases of practical interests .",
