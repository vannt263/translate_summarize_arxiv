    "quantum error - correcting codes are seen as being indispensable for building a quantum computer .",

    "subsystem codes_. subsystem codes provide a common platform for comparing the various different types of quantum codes and make it possible to treat active and passive quantum error - correction within the same framework .",
    "apart from the fact that subsystem codes give us more control over the degree of passive error - correction , there have been claims that subsystem codes can make quantum error - correction more robust and practical .",
    "for example , it has been claimed that subsystem codes make it possible to derive simpler error recovery schemes in comparison to stabilizer codes .",
    "furthermore , it is conjectured that certain subsystem codes are self - correcting  @xcite .",
    "subsystem codes are relatively new and promise to be a fruitful area for quantum error - correction . until now , there are few concrete examples of such codes and even fewer systematic code constructions .",
    "little is known about the parameters of subsystem codes , so it is difficult to judge the performance of such codes .    in a recent work @xcite , we derived a character - theoretic framework for the construction of subsystem codes .",
    "we were able to show that there exists a correspondence between the subsystem codes over @xmath1 and classical additive codes over @xmath1 and @xmath2 . in this paper",
    ", we investigate basic properties of subsystem codes , establish further connections to classical codes , and derive bounds on the parameters of subsystem codes .",
    "we report first results on a fair comparison between stabilizer codes and subsystem codes .",
    "the paper is structured as follows . after a brief introduction to subsystem codes in section  [ sec : classical ] , we recall some results about the relations between subsystem codes and classical codes . then we give some simple constructions of subsystem codes which parallel the common constructions of stabilizer codes . in section  [ sec : lbounds ] , we give a nonconstructive proof of the existence of subsystem codes . in section  [ sec :",
    "ubounds ] , we derive linear programming upper bounds on the parameters of subsystem codes . for pure subsystem codes ( to be defined later ) we can also derive analytical upper bounds which resemble the quantum singleton and hamming bounds .",
    "armed with these results on bounds we make a rigorous comparison of stabilizer codes and subsystem codes , that makes precise when subsystem codes can do better .",
