    "the born effective charge  @xcite ( @xmath0 ) is the equivalent , for crystalline insulating solid , of the atomic polar tensor introduced for isolated molecules  @xcite .",
    "it is a dynamical charge related to the macroscopic polarization induced by the collective displacements of nuclei belonging to a given sublattice . in the study of the lattice dynamics of insulating crystals ,",
    "it is considered as a fundamental quantity , because it governs the amplitude of the long - range coulomb interaction between nuclei , and the splitting between longitudinal ( lo ) and transverse ( to ) optic phonon modes .    in simple materials , like @xmath1 binary crystals  @xcite , the phonon eigenvectors are imposed by symmetry .",
    "infra - red measurements of the splitting between lo and to modes allows an accurate estimation of @xmath2 and offers therefore an unambiguous way to extract the amplitude of @xmath0 from the experiment .",
    "however , in more complex materials like abo@xmath3 compounds , lo and to mode eigenvectors are not necessarily equivalent .",
    "the determination of @xmath0 from the experimental data is consequently not straightforward and requires the use of some approximations  @xcite . for such compounds ,",
    "the development of theoretical methods giving direct access to @xmath0 acquires therefore a specific interest .",
    "conventionally , the born effective charge tensor @xmath4 of nuclei belonging to the sublattice @xmath5 is defined as the coefficient of proportionality relating , under the condition of zero macroscopic electric field , the change in macroscopic polarization @xmath6 along the direction @xmath7 and the collective nuclear displacements of atoms @xmath5 along direction @xmath8 , times the unit cell volume @xmath9  : @xmath10 however , a thermodynamical equality relates the macroscopic polarization to a derivative of the electric enthalpy @xmath11 and another relationship connects the forces @xmath12 on the nuclei @xmath5 to a derivative of the electric enthalpy so that @xmath13 can be alternatively defined as follows : @xmath14 from these relationships , z@xmath15 can therefore be thought either as ( i ) the change of polarization induced by the collective displacements of atoms @xmath5 , under zero field ( ii ) a mixed second derivative of the electric enthalpy or ( iii ) the derivative of the force induced on a nucleus @xmath5 by an homogeneous effective electric field @xmath16 , at zero atomic displacements .",
    "the three definitions are formally equivalent .",
    "however , each of them can lead to different algorithms for the computation of @xmath13 from first - principles . among the approaches which are the most widely used ,",
    "a first powerful and systematic procedure was introduced by baroni , giannozzi and testa  @xcite , who suggested to determine @xmath0 from a linear response formalism grounded on a sternheimer equation .",
    "a different algorithm , based on a variational principle , was later reported by gonze , allan and teter  @xcite , yielding a new alternative expression for @xmath0 .",
    "thanks to progress in the theory of the macroscopic polarization , @xmath0 is also directly accessible from finite difference of polarization  @xcite . the first two algorithms were exclusively implemented within the density functional formalism ( dft ) while the last one also allowed calculations of changes in polarization within different other one - electron schemes ( hartree - fock method  @xcite , model gw approximations to many - body theory  @xcite , harrison tight - binding model  @xcite ) and the hubbard tight - binding model  @xcite .",
    "accurate predictions of the born effective charges have been reported for a large variety of materials . in some of these studies",
    "@xcite , the decomposition of @xmath13 in individual contributions from separate groups of occupied bands appeared as a powerful tool to identify the microscopic mechanisms monitoring its amplitude .",
    "however , the physical interpretation of these decompositions was never explicitely discussed . moreover , unlike the total @xmath13 , contributions from individual groups of bands are not uniquely defined .    in the present paper ,",
    "we aim at presenting the links between the theoretical frameworks used nowadays to compute @xmath13 , and at deducing from this comparison the correct way to develop a band - by - band analysis .",
    "we demonstrate that the natural decompositions arising from eq .",
    "( [ eqz.p ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ eqz.2 ] ) _ differs _ , although independent approches ( linear response , berry phase approach , electronic wannier functions ) to eq .",
    "( [ eqz.2 ] ) are strictly _ equivalent _ provided the phase of the wavefunctions are correctly chosen .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we describe the mathematical links existing between the different expressions that can be used to determine the global value of @xmath17 within the density functional formalism without yet referring to band - by - band decompositions .",
    "we adopt the notations of ref .  @xcite . in section iii",
    ", we discuss how contributions from isolated sets of bands can be separated from each others .",
    "we identify different expressions and discuss their meaning in terms of electronic wannier functions . in section iv , we illustrate our results on a numerical example , emphasizing that independent decompositions yield in practice radically different values . finally ,",
    "in section v , we conclude on the physically correct way of performing band - by - band decomposition of @xmath13 .",
    "for practical purposes , in what follows , the born effective charge will be decomposed into two contributions  : @xmath18 the first term , @xmath19 , is the charge of the nuclei ( or pseudo - ion , in case of pseudopotential calculations ) , and can be trivially assigned . the second ,",
    "@xmath20 , is the contribution due to the electrons .",
    "a first straightforward approach for the determination of @xmath21 consists in computing the difference of macroscopic polarization between a reference state , and a state where the atoms belonging to the sublattice @xmath5 have been displaced by a small but finite distance @xmath22 .",
    "the electronic contribution to @xmath13 can be obtained as  : @xmath23 in periodic systems , the change in electronic polarization in zero field can be computed from the king - smith and vanderbilt formula  @xcite  : @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the occupation number of states in the valence bands ( @xmath26 in spin - degenerate system ) and @xmath27 is the periodic part of the bloch functions . taken independently ,",
    "the matrix elements of the previous equation are ill - defined because the phase of the wavefunctions at a given wavevector of the brillouin zone is arbitrary , and thus unrelated with the phases at neighbouring * k * points .",
    "however , the _ integral _ of the right - hand side is a well - defined quantity , which takes the form of a berry phase of band @xmath28 , as discussed by zak  @xcite .",
    "the king - smith and vanderbilt definition is valid _ only _ under the constraint that the wavefunctions fulfill the _ periodic gauge _ condition .",
    "this means that the periodic part of bloch functions must satisfy @xmath29 this condition does not fix unambiguously the phase of the wavefunctions at a given * k*-point ( even not at neighbouring * k*-points ) but it imposes a constraint for wavefunctions at distant wavevectors .",
    "it defines a topology in * k*-space , within which the polarization takes the convenient form of a berry phase .",
    "when working within one - electron schemes ( dft , hartree - fock , ... ) , a second choice of phase is present at _ another _ level . for the ground - state ,",
    "the lagrange multiplier method applied to the minimization of the hohenberg and kohn fonctional under orthonormalization conditions on the wavefunctions  @xcite , gives the following equations  : @xmath30 this condition , associated with the minimisation of the hohenberg and kohn energy functional , means that the application of the hamiltonian to a given wavefunction generates a vector which must stay within the hilbert space defined by the set of @xmath27 wavefunctions .",
    "we observe that a unitary transformation between the wavefunctions will leave that hilbert space invariant , and eq .",
    "( [ eq.s ] ) will remain satisfied provided the matrix of lagrange multiplier @xmath31 is transformed accordingly . in order to build kohn - sham band structures , the unitary transform is implicitely chosen such as to guarantee @xmath32 in which case @xmath33 correspond to the eigenvalues of the kohn - sham hamiltonian and the associated functions @xmath34 are the kohn - sham orbitals .",
    "this choice is called the _ diagonal gauge _ condition . all along this work , it will be emphasized by a `` @xmath35 '' subscript .",

    "@xcite .",
    "we note that the choice of gauge will influence the value of the first - derivative of @xmath41 , although the integrated quantity @xmath42 must remain independent of this choice ( in any periodic gauge ) .",
