    "_ xmm - newton _ was immediately activated and it found one single source inside the error circle of isgri . the coordinates ( j2000 ) were @xmath9 and @xmath10 with an uncertainty of @xmath11 ( rodriguez et al .",
    "2003a ) . in this reduced error circle it was possible to identify two reliable infrared counterparts in the 2mass catalog ( tomsick et al .",
    "2003b ) .",
    "a preliminary analysis of the _ xmm - newton _ observation , together with the identification of the infrared counterpart was presented in rodriguez et al .",
    "( 2003b ) . here",
    "we present a reanalysis of the _ integral _ ao1 observation , together with a reanalysis of the _ xmm - newton _ too data .",
    "_ integral _ observed the norma region from 1 february 2003 @xmath13 to 5 february 2003 @xmath14 ut for an elapsed time of @xmath15 ks and with the dither pattern @xmath16 .",
    "the screening , reduction , and analysis of the ibis / isgri data have been performed by using the _ integral _ offline scientific analysis ( osa ) v. 3 ( goldwurm et al . 2003a ) , available to the public through the _ integral _ science data centre ( isdc ) .",
    "an initial analysis was performed by deconvolving the isgri shadowgrams to obtain images .",
    "igr j@xmath0 was detected in the imaging pipeline in the energy bands @xmath17 kev ( signal  to  noise ratio @xmath18 ) and @xmath19 kev ( @xmath20 ) .",
    "the mosaic images are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : isgri_mosaic ] . given the present uncertainties in the validation of the software for the off  axis sources , it was adopted the same procedure described by goldoni et al .",
    "we divided the count rate of igr j@xmath0 by the count rate of the crab in a similar off ",
    "axis angle , extracted from the calibration observations .",
    "we added a @xmath21 of systematic error , to take into account the residual fluctuations in the count rate ( cf goldwurm et al .",
    "the calculated flux is @xmath22 erg @xmath3 s@xmath23 and @xmath24 erg @xmath3 s@xmath23 , in the energy bands @xmath17 kev and @xmath19 kev respectively .",
    "no significant detection was recorded at higher energy .",
    "igr j@xmath0 was detected in most of the individual scws with @xmath25 .",
    "therefore , to study the variability of the source it was decided to rebin the lightcurve so that each time bin contains 8 scw , corresponding approximately to @xmath26 ks .",
    "the obtained lightcurve shows a clear outburst at the time of the discovery , plus some other periods with a certain variability ( fig .",
    "[ fig : isgri_lc ] ) . during the outburst , the flux in the band @xmath17 kev raised from about @xmath27 mcrab to @xmath28 mcrab ( fig .",
    "[ fig : isgri_lc ] , _ left _ ) .",
    "the time scale of the variations occurs on @xmath29  s or even more .",
    "a similar behaviour is clearly seen in the @xmath19  kev energy band ( fig .",
    "[ fig : isgri_lc ] , _ right _ ) .    since in a coded  mask instrument the brightest sources in the field of view ( fov ) can  under certain conditions",
    " significantly affect the detection of the other nearby sources , we investigated also the time variability of the three brightest sources in the fov , namely 4u@xmath1 , 4u@xmath30 , and gx@xmath31 .",
    "all the analysed sources display different variability patterns and therefore we conclude that the variability of igr j@xmath0 is genuine .      to extract the spectrum of the whole observation and also during the outburst we used both the spectral extraction pipeline and the results from the image analysis , to perform a check of the results .",
    "this is necessary to take into account that igr j@xmath0 is located in a crowded region , with at least two nearby sources ( 4u @xmath1 and igr j@xmath32 ) , and therefore the different approach in the deconvolution of images and extraction of spectra ( see goldwurm et al .",
    "2003a for a full explanation of the algorithms ) could generate results not always consistent each others .    for the spectral extraction pipeline we rebinned the latest rmf matrix from the original @xmath33 channels to @xmath34 channels , by putting all the channels above @xmath35 kev into the last channel of the rebinned matrix .",
    "the remaining channels in the range @xmath36 kev were grouped in bin of about @xmath37 kev in size .",
    "this approach has been selected to emphasize the energy range @xmath36 kev and to have enough statistics to perform the @xmath38 test in the spectral fit with ` xspec ` ( v 11.3 ) .",
    "nonetheless , the source is faint and does not allow a fit with multiple component models .",
    "we decided to fit with a simple power law model to measure if there is hardening / softening during the outburst .",
    "the spectrum of the whole observation has @xmath39 , with a flux of about @xmath40 erg @xmath3 s@xmath23 in the energy band @xmath41 kev , consistent with the results from the imaging analysis .",
    "also in the spectral extraction pipeline no flux is detected for energies greater than @xmath42 kev .",
    "the spectrum extracted during of the outburst ( bins 2 - 4 in fig .",
    "[ fig : isgri_lc ] ) has the photon index varying from @xmath43 to @xmath44 , therefore slightly harder than that of the whole observation , with a peak flux of @xmath45 erg @xmath3 s@xmath23 in the @xmath41 kev energy band .    during the `` normal '' activity , investigated only with the imaging pipeline , igr j@xmath0",
    "is barely detected in the energy band @xmath19 kev ( fig .",
    "[ fig : isgri_lc ] , _ right _ ) , with the exception of the outburst .",
    "the hardness ratio ( not shown ) , calculated by using the fluxes in the two energy bands ( @xmath17  kev and @xmath19  kev ) , is in agreement with the results of the spectral extraction pipeline , and confirms the softness of the source during almost the whole observation .     kev energy band , with @xmath8 ks of exposure ( i.e. cleaned from soft - proton flares ) .",

    "we used still the xmm sas v. 5.4.1 software to process and screening the data and the same procedures described in rodriguez et al .",
    "( 2003b ) .",
    "we adopted a different procedure only to extract the spectrum .",
    "since the source is bright enough to be clearly visible still in the flared image , we avoided the selection of a time region not affected by soft - proton flares , and we extracted directly from the contaminated image the source plus background counts from a circular region centered on igr  j@xmath0 with radius of @xmath58 .",
    "therefore , we extracted the background from another circular region with radius @xmath6 , and close to the source .",
    "we performed the background ( now including the soft  proton flares ) subtraction directly in ` xspec ` .",
    "we succeeded to save @xmath59 ks from the elapsed time of @xmath49 ks , with a loss of only @xmath60 ks ( to be compared with the loss of @xmath34 ks of the early analysis ) .",
    "we found that the best fit model is still an absorbed power law with @xmath61 and @xmath62 @xmath3 ( @xmath63 , d.o.f.@xmath64 ) , consistent with the results of the early analysis ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : epic_spec ] ) .",
    "the unabsorbed flux in the @xmath65 kev energy band is @xmath66 erg @xmath3 s@xmath23 .",
    "we note that there are some interesting features between @xmath67 and @xmath37 kev , and particularly some hints for emission lines of the iron complex , between @xmath68 and @xmath69 kev .",
    "the addition of a thermal plasma model ( ` mekal ` model in ` xspec ` ) with a temperature @xmath70 kev is able to reproduce some of these features , and particularly the emission lines of the iron complex .",
    "however , this model is statistically required only at @xmath71 confidence level . a simple gaussian emission line at @xmath72  kev and width @xmath73  kev is required at @xmath74% .",

    "concerning the source 2 , there are detections in other catalogs : a summary of the optical / infrared detections is shown in table  [ tab : oir ] .",
    "it is worth noting that the source 2 is classified as a non - star object , that may be either galaxies or blended objects , in the guide star catalog 2.2 .",

    "the nature of igr  j@xmath0 is not clear yet and , even though the most probable hypothesis is a galactic x  ray binary , the possibility of an extragalactic object can not be completely ruled out .",
    "the source appears to be intrinsically absorbed , with an @xmath89 one order of magnitude greater than the galactic absorption along the line of sight .",
    "also the infrared observation suggests an excess due to circumstellar plasma or dust along the line of sight .",
    "the x  ray spectrum could support the hot plasma solution , but the confidence level is not enough ( only @xmath71 ) and should be confirmed with further observations with much more statistics .",
    "therefore , the picture of a high  mass x ",
    "ray binary ( hmxrb ) with a compact object accreting through winds appears to be very likely for igr  j@xmath0 .",
    "the winds could also be the source of obscuration , wrapping up the compact object .",
    "the nature of the accreting object is not clear as well : the strong differences in the photon index in the energy bands @xmath90  kev and @xmath41  kev could be due to changes in spectral states , thus suggesting a black hole . on the other hand , the drop of emission for energies greater than @xmath91  kev is common in neutron stars .",
    "although , the _ integral _ and _ xmm - newton _ are not simultaneous , we tried a simultaneous fit ( fig .  [ fig : allspec ] ) .",
    "the best fit model ( @xmath92 , @xmath93 ) is an absorbed power law with exponential cutoff ( ` cutoffpl ` model in ` xspec ` ) , typical of accreting neutron stars ( see , e.g. white et al .",
    "the photon index is @xmath94 , the column density @xmath95  @xmath3 , and the cutoff energy @xmath96  kev .",
    "the scaling constant applied to the isgri spectrum is @xmath97 .",
    "we stress that the observations were _ not _ simultaneous and the source is strongly variable .",
    "therefore , this fit should be taken with extreme care .",
    "another possibility , given the low luminosity in both bands ( @xmath98  erg / s in the @xmath65  kev energy band , and @xmath99  erg / s in the @xmath41  kev band ) if the source is located in the norma arm ( @xmath8  kpc ) , is that we are observing the emission from a jet . in this case",
    ", we could make the hypothesis that the change in the photon index could be due to a break , because of a change in the mechanism of cooling of electrons .",
    "the key question in the study of this source is therefore the spectral variability .",
