    "excess electrons in liquid helium are known to form electron bubbles .",
    "this is so because of the strong repulsion between the helium atoms , which are very weakly polarizable , and the intruder electrons .",
    "experimental and theoretical spectroscopic studies on electron bubbles have been carried out for many years since the pioneering works of northby and sanders,@xcite and of dexter and coworkers.@xcite only some twenty years later , grimes and adams were able to carried out a detailed analysis of the infrared - absorption spectrum of the electron bubble in liquid @xmath0he . in a first work,@xcite",
    "they have used a photoconductive mechanism to detect the transitions which operated only over a limited region of the pressure - temperature ( @xmath5 ) plane because it appeared to be associated with trapping of bubbles on vortices in the superfluid .",
    "later on , they have improved their experimental apparatus and have observed the electronic transitions in direct infrared absorption.@xcite this has allowed them to study the spectrum of electron bubbles in a wider region of the @xmath5 plane from @xmath6 to the solidification pressure , and up to temperatures above 4 k instead of the maximum @xmath7 k reached in photocurrent experiments .",
    "recent experiments on cavitation in liquid helium have renewed the interest in the study of single electron bubbles.@xcite multielectron bubbles have also prompted some theoretical activity;@xcite while the stability of multielectron bubbles is not yet clarified,@xcite single electron bubbles are stable entities for pressures above saturation pressure .",
    "electron bubbles in helium droplets are metastable objects whose lifetime has been measured for both helium isotopes.@xcite    the simplest model to address electron bubbles in liquid helium supposes that they are confined in a spherical well potential of radius @xmath8 .",
    "the total energy of the electron - helium ( e - he ) system is then written as a function of @xmath8 @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the ground state electronic energy , @xmath11 is the pressure applied to the system , and @xmath12 is the surface tension of the liquid . for an infinite spherical",
    "well potential , @xmath13 .",
    "this model is able to qualitatively reproduce the experimental infrared - absorption energies , and is simple enough to allow to calculate shape fluctuations of electron bubbles and line shapes.@xcite it can be refined@xcite by taking into account the finite depth of the well @xmath14 , which is about 1 ev , ref . .",
    "once @xmath15 has been minimized with respect to @xmath8 and the radius of the equilibrium bubble @xmath16 has been determined , it is easy to obtain the energies of the @xmath17 excited states and to compute the transition energies to the ground state if the franck - condon principle holds , i.e. , if the absorption of a photon by the electron bubble is a process much faster than the time needed for the helium bubble to adapt itself to the electron wave function in the excited state .",
    "another key ingredient entering eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) is the surface tension @xmath12 , which for @xmath0he at zero @xmath18 and @xmath11 is about 0.274 k @xmath19 , ref . .",
    "this yields @xmath20  .",
    "the surface tension is only known along the liquid - vapor coexistence line .",
    "consequently , to use eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) one has to rely on model calculations of @xmath21 .",
    "the situation has been discussed in detail by grimes and adams , who concluded that in order to perfectly fit their experimental results with eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) , one has to take the depth of the well @xmath14 @xmath11-dependent and a surface tension @xmath12 independent of @xmath11 , which seems difficult to justify .",
    "for instance , early calculations@xcite indicated that the surface tension @xmath12 nearly doubles from @xmath6 to 25 atm .",
    "for the sake of completeness , we present in the appendix a calculation of @xmath22 that also yields this increase , although we will not make a substantial use of these results in our study .",
    "it is worthwhile to stress that when both @xmath14 and @xmath12 were made @xmath11-dependent following the expected pressure dependences , the agreement between theory@xcite and experiment was only qualitative , see fig . 2 of ref .",
    "for this reason , these authors concluded that more sophisticated calculations of the properties of electron bubbles were called for , incorporating the fact that the bubble density profile is not abrupt but have a finite surface thickness .    in this work we present a theoretical description of infrared - absorption @xmath2 and @xmath3 excitation energies of electron bubbles in liquid helium .",
    "it belongs to the class of the more sophisticated calculations suggested by grimes and adams , since it is not based on ad - hoc assumptions , but on the use of a finite - temperature density functional ( df ) approach in conjunction with a realistic electron - helium effective potential .",
    "df methods have become increasingly popular in recent years as useful computational tools to study the properties of classical and quantum inhomogeneous fluids,@xcite especially for large systems for which these methods provide a good compromise between accuracy and computational cost , yielding results in agreement with experiment or with more microscopic approaches . in the frame of df theory ,",
    "the properties of an electron bubble approaching the surface of liquid @xmath0he have been studied by ancilotto and toigo@xcite using the so - called orsay - paris ( op ) zero temperature finite - range df@xcite and the pseudopotential proposed in ref . as e",
    "- he interaction .",
    "this another key ingredient of the calculation , and an accurate description of the infrared absorption can be only achieved using an accurate e - he interaction .",
    "we want to mention that df theory has been succesfully applied to dynamical problems in bulk liquid helium and helium droplets@xcite using a generalization of the op density functional called orsay - trento ( ot ) functional.@xcite having no ad - hoc parameters to be adjusted in the calculation to describe the infrared - absorption energies , we will show that the simplest form of a df for liquid helium , namely a zero range one , is not able to reproduce the experimental data .",
    "as we are going to show , one must resort to more sophisticated forms , such as the mentioned op and ot finite range functionals .",
    "this finding is an additional supporting evidence of the reliability of finite range functionals .",
    "density functional theory has also proven to be the most successful approach in addressing cavitation in liquid helium so far.@xcite it incorporates in a self - consistent way the equation of state of bulk liquid and surface tension of the liquid - gas interface as a function of temperature .",
    "it allows for a flexible description of the electron bubble , incorporating surface thickness effects . within df theory one",
    "avoids the use of macroscopic concepts such as surface tension and pressure at a nanoscopic scale ; however , it is a continuous , not an atomic description of the system . used in conjunction with a hartree - type e - he potential , we have recently shown that this approach quantitatively reproduces the existing experimental data on cavitation of electron bubbles in liquid helium below saturation pressure.@xcite consequently , it is a tested framework to address other properties of electron bubbles .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we briefly present the density functional ( df ) plus hartree electron - effective potential approach we have employed , as well as some numerical details .",
    "the structure of the electron bubble ( radius and surface thickness ) and infrared - absorption energies are discussed in sec .",
    "iii , and a summary is presented in sec .",
    "finally , we present in the appendix a model calculation of the surface tension as a function of pressure that we have used to make some crude estimates of the electron bubble radius .",
    "as in ref . , our starting point is the finite temperature zero - range df of ref . that reproduces thermal properties of liquid @xmath0he such as the experimental isotherms and the @xmath0he liquid - gas coexistence line up to @xmath23 k , and the @xmath18 dependence of the surface tension of the liquid free surface .",
    "we have taken the hartree - type e - he effective potential derived by cheng et al.@xcite ( see also ref . ) as e - he interaction .",
    "this allows us to write the free energy of the system as a functional of the @xmath0he particle density @xmath24 , the excess electron wave function @xmath25 , and @xmath18 : @xmath26 = \\int d\\vec{r}\\ , f(\\rho , t)+ \\frac{\\hbar^2}{2\\,m_e } \\int d\\vec{r}\\ , |\\nabla \\psi(\\vec{r}\\,)|^2 + \\int d\\vec{r}\\ , |\\psi(\\vec{r}\\,)|^2 v(\\rho )   \\ ; , \\label{eq9}\\ ] ] where @xmath27 is the @xmath0he free energy density per unit volume written as @xmath28 in this expression , @xmath29 consists of the free energy density of a bose gas , plus phenomenological density and temperature dependent terms written as @xmath30 that takes into account the effective interaction of helium atoms in the bulk liquid . the parameters of these terms and those of the density gradient terms in eq .",
    "( [ eq10 ] ) have been adjusted so as to reproduce physical quantities like the equation of state of the bulk liquid and the surface tension of the liquid free surface .",

    "we have taken @xcite @xmath39  , @xmath40  .    for given @xmath11 and @xmath18 values",
    "we have solved euler - lagrange equations which result from the variation of the constrained grand potential density @xmath41 , where @xmath42 it yields @xmath43 @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the lowest eigenvalue of the schrdinger equation obeyed by the electron .",
    "these equations are solved assuming spherical symmetry , imposing for @xmath24 that @xmath46 and @xmath47 , where @xmath48 is the density of the bulk liquid , and that the electron is in the @xmath49 state .",
    "fixing @xmath48 and @xmath18 amounts to fix @xmath11 and @xmath18 , since the pressure can be obtained from the bulk equation of state @xmath50 , and the @xmath0he chemical @xmath51 is known in advance .",
    "we have used a multidimensional newton - raphson method@xcite for solving eqs .",
    "( [ eq14 ] ) and ( [ eq15 ] ) , after having discretized them using @xmath52-point formulas for the @xmath53 derivatives .",
    "a fine mesh of step @xmath54@xmath55 has been employed , and the equations have been integrated up to @xmath56 @xmath55 to make sure that the asymptotic bulk liquid has been reached .",
    "after obtaining the equilibrium configuration ( @xmath49 state ) , the spectrum of the electron bubble @xmath57 is calculated from eq .",
    "( [ eq15 ] ) keeping frozen the helium density ( franck - condon principle ) .",
    "figure [ fig1 ] shows the @xmath2 transition energies ( ev ) as a function of @xmath11 ( atm ) for @xmath58 k. it can be see that the agreement between theory and experiment is good from @xmath6 to the solidification pressure , and consequently , the physical process seems well undestood",
    ". however , a minor discrepancy appears at high pressures , and especially in the description of the @xmath3 transition energies , as it can be seen in fig .",
    "this is not surprising , since one would expect that the @xmath59 state is more sensitive to fine details of the bubble structure , in particular to its thickness , because the @xmath59 wave function penetrates deeper into the liquid .",
    "we have improved the method of sec .",
    "ii to achieve a better agreement with experiment .",
    "the improvement is based on the observation that zero - range df s as the one described in sec .",
    "ii are fitted to reproduce the experimental surface tension of liquid helium at zero temperature,@xcite and then , the @xmath18-dependence of @xmath12,@xcite and the thickness @xmath60 of the free surface -defined as the difference between the distances at which the density equals 0.1@xmath48 and 0.9@xmath48 , where @xmath48 is the bulk density at the given @xmath61- come out as predictions of the formalism .",
    "it turns out that at @xmath62 , zero - range df s overestimate @xmath60 by about 1  .",
    "indeed , recent measurement of the @xmath0he surface thickness yield values around 6  , refs . , whereas the value predicted in refs .",
    "is about 7  . in the case of @xmath4he ,",
    "the experimental value is about 7.5 ,@xcite whereas the prediction using zero - range df s is about 8.5 - 9 .@xcite we recall that the surface thickness of liquid helium is a quantity rather difficult to determine experimental and theoretically,@xcite and the dispersion of the values assigned to it is large.@xcite only recently , the mentioned values ( @xmath63 6 - 6.5 @xmath55 for @xmath0he and @xmath63 7.5 @xmath55 for @xmath4he ) have emerged as likely accurate determinations of the surface thickness of liquid helium free surface .    in the nineties ,",
    "a new class of df s has appeared that retains some of the simplicity of the original zero - range df s , incorporating finite - range effects that are absolutely necessary to address a wide class of physical phenomena , like elementary excitations in bulk liquid and large inhomogeneities caused by the presence of impurities in bulk liquid and droplets , and also by substrates .",
    "two such df s are the op and ot functionals for @xmath0he already commented.@xcite it is remarkable that they reproduce the experimental surface tension at @xmath62 without having imposed it in their construction , and also the surface thickness . in particular , op yields @xmath64 k @xmath19 , @xmath65  , and ot yields @xmath66 k @xmath19 , @xmath67 .@xcite a recent diffusion monte carlo calculation yields @xmath68 k @xmath19 , @xmath60=6.3(4 ) .@xcite    it is then quite natural to ask oneself if the remaining disagreement between theory and experiment shown in fig . ( [ fig1 ] ) and especially in fig . ( [ fig2 ] ) might arise from a worse description of the electron bubble surface in the case of zero - range df s . indeed , the error in the infrared energies has been estimated@xcite to be @xmath63 1% , smaller than the difference between experiment and zero - range df calculations . to answer this question ,",
    "we have repeated the calculations using the zero temperature ot functional -thermal effects on the excitation energies are expected to be small for @xmath58 k , and this is what we have found , see below- , and also using a straightforward generalization at finite @xmath18 of the op functional , which is possible because of the similarities between op and the zero - range df of sec ii.@xcite it is worth to know that a generalization of the ot density functional at finite temperatures is also available.@xcite    density profiles of electron bubble at different pressures and @xmath69 k , obtained with the op and the zero - range functional , are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , and in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] for the ot functional at @xmath62 k. the excess electron squared wave functions @xmath70 corresponding to the @xmath71 and @xmath59 states are also represented .",
    "for the zero - range df we also give the value of the surface thickness @xmath60 , which goes from 6.1 @xmath55 at @xmath6 atm to 4.3 @xmath55 at @xmath72 atm . in the case of op , and especially of ot , it is difficult to define the thickness , and even the bubble radius , because of the density oscillations in the surface region ( see also ref . ) . for reference ,",
    "we indicate that the surface thickness of the electron bubble at @xmath69 k and @xmath6 atm obtained with op is 5  , one @xmath55 smaller that the value yielded by the zero - range df .    figures ( [ fig1 ] ) and ( [ fig2 ] ) also show the results obtained with op and ot .",
    "it can be seen that in this case , the agreement between theory and experiment is excellent.@xcite it is worthwhile to mention that eloranta and apkarian @xcite have also obtained the absorption energies up to @xmath73 atm using the ot functional and the pseudopotential of jortner et al.@xcite as e - he interaction .",
    "their results for the @xmath3 transition energies are not in as good agreement with experiment as ours , likely because of the different e - he interaction we have used .",
    "besides , the relevance of a correct description of the surface thickness to reproduce the experimental data has been overlooked in their work , which is mainly about the dynamics of electron bubble expansion in liquid @xmath0he .    figure ( [ fig5 ] ) shows the evolution of the radius of the electron bubble with pressure determined by several authors using different methods,@xcite and the value we have obtained using the zero - range and the op and ot functionals . for a given pressure , we have defined the radius of the bubble as the radial distance at which the helium density reaches the corresponding bulk value divided by two .",
    "it can be seen that our results are compatible with the more recent experimental determinations , even those obtained with the zero - range df , which overestimate the radius of the electron bubble by @xmath74  .",

    ", it is no longer valid to assume that the electron bubble is void of he atoms .",
    "it has been shown@xcite that the bubble is progessively filled with helium vapor that must be ` dragged ' by the electron in the course of its dipole excitation .",
    "this dynamical effect has to be taken into account if one wants to have a quatitative agreement with experiment above @xmath78 k. although it is in principle possible to address this problem within time - dependent density functional theory@xcite using the finite temperature op functional or that of ref .",
    ", this is not a trivial issue and it is beyond the scope of our work .",
    "finally , we have also calculated the cross - section of the transition from the @xmath49 to the @xmath79 and @xmath59 excited states . for photons of frequency @xmath80 polarized along the @xmath81 axis ,",

    "our results are in full agreement with these of ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "we have also studied the infrared - absorption spectrum for electron bubbles in liquid @xmath4he .",
    "the application of df theory to describe electron bubble explosions in @xmath4he proceeds as shown in sec .",
    "we have used the zero - range df proposed in ref . to describe the inhomogeneous liquid , and also a finite - range df , called from now on fr , obtained from the zero - range one following the procedure indicated in ref .",
    "for the @xmath0he case .",
    "the e - he interaction is given again by eq .",

    "we represent in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] the infrared - absorption energies for the @xmath2 and @xmath3 transitions .",
    "it can be seen that the results are qualitatively similar to those found for @xmath0he , i.e. , a fair insensitivity of the @xmath2 transition energy to the detailed structure of the bubble surface , and an underestimation of the @xmath3 transition energy by the zero - range df .",
    "the half density radius of the electron bubble @xmath87 goes from 22.5 @xmath55 at @xmath6 to 11.8 @xmath55 at @xmath88 atm .",
    "the smaller excitation energies in the case of @xmath4he are due to the smaller surface tension for this isotope , @xmath89 k @xmath19,@xcite which causes that electron bubble radii are larger for @xmath4he than for @xmath0he ( e.g. , @xmath90 @xmath55 at @xmath6 instead of 18.9  ) , yielding smaller excitation energies , as shown for instance by the simple model of eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) .",
    "in particular , at @xmath6 the model gives for the ratio of the @xmath2 excitation energies the value @xmath91 , in good agreement with the results obtained within the df approach ( see tables ) .",
    "finally , we collect in table [ table2 ] the excitation energies ( ev ) , oscillator strengths and total cross sections ( ev @xmath83 ) to the first two @xmath84 states obtained with the fr functional at @xmath62 , @xmath85 atm .",
    "it can be seen that the oscillator strengths and cross sections are sensibly the same for both isotopes .",
    "we have demonstrated the suitability of the density functional approach to quantitatively address electron bubbles in liquid he . on the one hand , we have shown that the df approach , in conjunction with a realistic electron - helium interaction , is able to reproduce without any further assumption , the low temperature infrared spectrum of electron bubbles experimentally determined by grimes and adams.@xcite on the other hand , the method yields results that agree with the experimental findings of maris and co - workers on cavitation of electron bubbles below saturation pressure,@xcite in a wide range of temperatures.@xcite    we have shown that the analysis of infrared - absorption transitions of electron bubbles constitute a stringent test for the theoretical models aiming a detailed description of the free surface of liquid helium , in particular of its surface thickness .",
    "this is at variance with electron bubble cavitation , which seems to be sensitive only to global properties of the surface , like its tension .",
    "indeed , we have checked that the cavitation pressure for electron bubbles in liquid @xmath0he yielded by the zero - range df is -2.07 bar , whereas op yields -2.13 bar , and ot yields -2.08 bar .",
    "these differences are far smaller than the experimental error bars , and are partly due to the small differences in the surface tensions predicted by these functionals .    there are some related problems that can be studied as a natural extension of the work carried out until present within the df frame",
    ". in particular , the effect on the critical cavitation pressure of quantized vortices pinned to excess electrons.@xcite the infrared absorption above @xmath92 k is another open problem whose quantitative description requires to relax the franck - condon principle .",
    "although they were not detected in the experiments,@xcite it would be also interesting to check if there are other resonances in the infrared spectrum arising from the state where the helium atoms are relaxed , even though this state itself is not realized .",
    "for instance , in the case of electrons in crystals , this phenomenon , pertaining to polaron physics , is the origin of a peak in the electron optical spectrum on top of the franck - condon spectrum , due to the resonance of this virtual relaxed excited state with the applied radiation field.@xcite both problems , presently unaffordable by any microscopic approach , can be addressed within dft and tddft .",
    "as these are not trivial issues at all , they may be the next test grounds to assess the capabilities and limitations of the df theory applied to liquid helium .",
    "[ [ section ] ]    in this appendix we work out the zero temperature surface tension of bulk liquid @xmath0he as a function of @xmath11 for the zero range df .",
    "as we have previously stated , this is a model system , since bulk helium can only be in equilibrium with its vapor along the coexistence line , and thus for one single @xmath11 value at the given @xmath18 .",
    "we closely follow the method developed in refs . .",
