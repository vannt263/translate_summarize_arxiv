    "moreover , various grb / sn associations indicated that sne producing grbs can differ significantly from sn1998bw ( e.g. , grb021211/sn2002lt : della valle et al .  2003 ; grb060218/sn2006aj : campana et al .  2006 ; pian et al .  2006 ; mazzali et al .",

    "they concluded that this , as well as the combination of a long duration but a short temporal lag between different energy bands ( e.g. gehrels et al .",
    "2006 ) provide evidence for a new class of long grbs not associated with sne . at the cited redshift",
    ", an association with a sn as bright as sn1998bw is excluded . and that is why this grb was a surprise , while a few years earlier it would have been regarded as a blessing .",
    "the history of the theoretical ideas behind a possible grb / sn association is also complex and sinusoidal .",
    "supernovae as the originators of grbs were first discussed by colgate ( 1968 ) , goodman , dar & nussinov  ( 1987 ) and dar et al .",
    "the concrete realizations of the idea in these early works are obsolete , with the possible exception of mergers of compact objects as a mechanism behind _ short _ grbs ( goodman et al .",
    "1987 ) .",
    "arguing against a grb / sn association , woosley ( 1993 ) proposed a _ failed supernova _",
    "scenario , in which the collapse of a very massive star into a black hole would result in a grb unaccompanied by a sn . following the discovery of grb980425/sn1998bw , woosley , eastman & schmidt  ( 1999 ) and macfadyen & woosley  ( 1999 ) proposed two _ collapsar _ scenarios in which , instead of a ` failed sn ' , the opposite extreme results : a very bright and energetic hypernova [ the ` delayed ' collapsar scenario involves an intermediate state in which a neutron star is formed , as discussed in de rjula ( 1987 ) in connection with sn1987a ] .    an intermediate quiet period is also invoked in the _ supranova _ model ( vietri & stella 1998 ) , in which an ordinary sn produces a neutron star . due to loss of angular momentum by magnetic - dipole radiation , the neutron star collapses to a black hole and emits a grb years later , when the sn is no longer observable .",
    "similar two - stage processes had been considered by shaviv & dar ( 1995 ) as possible mechanisms for the generation of both short and long grbs . in their work ,",
    "the intermediate compact object is a neutron , hyperon or quark star , and the second transition is due to cooling , loss of angular momentum , mass accretion or a merger .",
    "but their suggestion for the grb - generating microphysics is very specific : inverse compton scattering , the mechanism adopted in the cb model ( e.g.  dar & de rjula 2004 ) .",
    "the other scenarios for grb / sn associations which we have reviewed are intertwined with the prevailing fireball models , which invoke synchrotron radiation from relativistic thin colliding shells of delicately baryon - seeded shock - accelerated @xmath3 pairs ( e.g.  waxman 2003 ) .",
    "a supranova or any other delayed - grb origin , or a ` failed supernova ' , would all explain the absence of an observable sn associated with grb060614 , but not the presence of a sn in all other well - observed cases .    in this paper",
    ", we examine whether or not the deep limits on an underlying sn in the optical ag of grb060614 do indeed provide conclusive evidence for long grbs which are not associated with sne .",
    "we discuss and compare three alternative explanations why grb060614 may have had a sn progenitor , which was not detected :    * the grb was produced by a very faint sn , akin to the ones discovered by turatto et al ( 1998 ) and by pastorello et al .",

    "the brightness of the sn may have been further extinct below the detection limit of hst ( gal - yam et al .",
    "2006 ) by dust in the host galaxy .",
    "we shall see that this possibility and the next are only apparently incompatible with the measurements ( mangano et al .",
    "the grb was produced in the putative host galaxy at @xmath1 , within a dense molecular cloud .",
    "the euv and soft x - rays of the grb destroyed the dust . in the cb model",
    "this occurs only inside an extremely narrow cone along the jet axis . through this cone",
    "only a very small fraction of the sn light could be seen .",
    "most of the sn light in the direction of the observer travelled outside this cone and encountered a large column density of dust , suffering strong extinction . *",
    "the grb was a normal long grb produced in a sn explosion at a large redshift ( @xmath4 ) as suggested by various grb redshift estimators ( schaefer & xiao 2006 ; dado , dar & de rjula 2007a ) where from the sn was well below the detection limits .",
    "the proximity of the line of sight to grb060614 to a foreground galaxy at @xmath1 was a chance coincidence , as advocated by schaefer & xiao ( 2006 ) and cobb et al .",
    "the grb could have been host - less , or could have taken place in a dwarf galaxy below the detection limit of the search by gal - yam et al .",
    "( 2006 ) .",
    "the peak energy , equivalent isotropic energy and peak luminosity of the grb play a central role in our discussion of the above possibilities , because of the relation between these observables and the luminosity of the sn , which is explicit in the cb model ( dar & de rjula 2004 ) .",
    "in the first case these observables coincide with the cb model expectations for a _ very faint _ sn at @xmath1 . in the second case",
    ", they do not . for the third itemized possibility , at @xmath4 , the values of the cited observables are , in the cb model , the ones predicted for a conventional 1998bw - like associated sn .",
    "but they are also the ones expected from model - independent ` redshift estimators ' .",
    "this gives us an occasion to comment on their use , and on the origin of the observed correlations between grb observables .",
    "in the cb model ( dar & de rjula  2000a , 2004 ; dado et al .  2002 , 2003 ) , _ long - duration _ grbs and their ags are produced by bipolar jets of cbs , ejected in core - collapse sn explosions ( dar & plaga  1999 ) .",
    "an accretion disk is hypothesized to be produced around the newly formed compact object , either by stellar material originally close to the surface of the imploding core and left behind by the explosion - generating outgoing shock , or by more distant stellar matter falling back after its passage ( de rjula  1987 ) . as observed in microquasars , each time part of the disk falls abruptly onto the compact object , a pair of cbs made of _ ordinary plasma _ are emitted with high bulk - motion lorentz factors , @xmath5 , in opposite directions along the rotation axis , where from matter has already fallen onto the compact object , due to lack of rotational support .",
    "the @xmath5-rays of a single pulse in a grb are produced as a cb coasts through the sn _ glory _ the sn light scattered away from the radial direction by the pre - sn ejecta .",
    "the electrons enclosed in the cb compton up - scatter glory s photons to grb energies .",
    "each pulse of a grb corresponds to one cb .",
    "the baryon number , lorentz factor , and emission time of the individual cbs reflect the chaotic accretion process and are not currently predictable , but given these parameters ( which we extract from the analysis of grb ags ) , all properties of the grb pulses follow ( dar & de rjula  2004 ) .",
    "two mechanisms contribute to a grb and its afterglow : inverse compton scattering ( ics ) and synchrotron radiation ( dado , dar & de rjula 2007b , de rjula 2007 ) .",
    "the second mechanism typically dominates in the ag phase .",
    "it is due to electrons of the interstellar medium ( ism ) swept - in by the cbs and spiraling in the their inner magnetic fields ( dado et al .",
    "2002 , 2006 ) and to ism electrons scattered to higher energies by the cbs and meandering in the galactic field ( dado & dar 2005 ) .",
    "the first cited mechanism , ics , typically dominates the @xmath5 and x - ray production during the ` prompt ' phase .",
    "it is the one resulting in the expectations to be discussed next ( dar & de rjula 2004 ) .",

    "the cb model predicts a strong extinction of the light of the associated sn , without a comparable extinction of the late grb s ag .",

    "2007 ) , nor the frail relation ( e.g. , kocevski & butler  2007 ) .",

    "the conclusion may be correct , and the new object may even be one of the ones previously discussed in the literature : a ` failed supernova ' ( a direct collapse into a black hole with no visible sn , woosley 1993 ) , a supranova ( a delayed collapse of a neutron star , vietri & stella 1998 ) , or a phase transition between the possible states of a compact hadronic star ( shaviv & dar  1995 ) .",
    "all the properties of grb 060614 , but the lack of a sn progenitor , are compatible with those of typical long - duration grbs . if this grb belongs to an entirely new class , this would need to be explained .",
    "we have discussed less drastic conclusions , and studied three reasons why a sn progenitor of grb 060614 may have avoided detection : strong extinction of the sn light in a molecular cloud , a fake sky coincidence with a galaxy at @xmath1 , and a dimmed associated supernova .",
    "the merits and demerits of these mutually - excluding alternatives are :    * the molecular - cloud hypothesis is the most obvious . in fireball models",
    "it would be excluded by the available data on the afterglow s optical extinction .",
    "but in the cb model , in which the sn and the source of the afterglow ( the moving cannonballs ) do not lie in the same fixed direction , it is not excluded .",
    "we disfavoured it on grounds that it can not naturally accommodate the values of all the prompt grb observables .",
    "* the possibility that the grb is much more distant than @xmath1 ( schaefer and xiao , 2006 ; cobb et al .",
    "2006 ) is consistent with the data , but not decisively provable .",
    "the correlations between grb observables used to substantiate this hypothesis are , as we have discussed in detail , not sufficiently trustable for a single case .",
    "this is so even in the cb - model , wherein the correlations satisfied by the data are predictions based on trivial physics and mere geometry ( dado , dar & de rjula , 2007a and references therein ) . to agree with all observations ,",
    "this scenario requires the grb to be host - less , or to have taken place in a dwarf galaxy fainter than the hst limit ( gal - yam et al .",

    "2004 , 2007 ) . in the cb model",
    "this alternative is supported by the fact that it results in correct predictions for the observed peak energy , isotropic energy and peak luminosity of the grb .",
    "two out of the five secured grb / sn associations , ( grb021211/sn2002lt : della valle et al .  2003",
    "; grb060218/sn2006aj : pian et al .  2006 ; mazzali et al .",

    "recently , li ( 2007 ) argued that the peak energy , @xmath14 , of their prompt @xmath5-ray emission is correlated to the peak bolometric luminosity @xmath111 of their sn : @xmath112^{4.97}$ ] .",
    "if such a correlation were true , it would exclude both a faint and a ` failed supernova ' origin of grb 060614 .",
    "but the alleged correlation is highly uncertain : it is based on four events three of them clustered within errors and on measurements with large systematic uncertainties .",
    "moreover , it has not been tested for the many more grb / sn pairs with a photometrically discovered sn .",
    "after decades of intense theoretical efforts and numerical simulations , there is no first - principle understanding of sn explosions , not to speak of the allegedly consequent generation of relativistic jets , particularly if required to consist mainly of @xmath3 pairs . yet",
    ", most fireball - inspired discussions of the association advocate sne ib / c .    the hypotheses of the cb model do not stem from simulations , but from the analogy between observations of accreting quasars or microquasars , with expectations based on angular - momentum conservation about the inner realms of a rotating star whose core has collapsed .",
    "it is not obvious why the external composition of the star , which determines the sn type , would play a crucial role .",
    "thus the model does not imply a strong a - priori preference for a sn type , provided it is ( for long grbs ) a core - collapse sn .",
    "evidence that type ii sne emit cbs is provided by the  mystery spots \" of sn1987a ( ninenson & papaliolios , 2001 ) .",
    "there are large uncertainties in the conversion of the measured rates of grbs into the true frequency of these events .",
    "they arise not only from detection biases , backgrounds and thresholds , but from the model - dependent beaming - angle distribution . moreover , in the cb model , a grb s luminosity is proportional to the early luminosity of its generating sn , which is type - dependent . and so is the sn luminosity function .",
    "all in all , for the typical very narrow beaming angles of the cb model , @xmath113 mrad , the uncertainties are large enough to amply accommodate the conclusion that most core - collapse sne generate grbs , or that only @xmath114% of them do it , perhaps the ones of type ib / c .",

    "( 2006 ) are often quoted for their 1% upper limit on the fraction of grb - generating sne .",
