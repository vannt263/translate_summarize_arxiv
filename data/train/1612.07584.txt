    "( [ kontsevich ] ) was generalised to admit a purely imaginary coupling constant @xmath18 , and the interest was turned to correlation functions arising from the formal measure ( [ kontsevich ] ) , @xmath19 with the usual trick of generating @xmath20 under the integral and after absorbing @xmath21 in a redefinition of @xmath16 and @xmath22 , the known solution ( in the large-@xmath2 limit ) of the kontsevich action ( [ kontsevich ] ) allows to formally derive all correlation functions ( [ harald+harold ] ) .",
    "the term ` formally ' refers to the fact that the large-@xmath2 limit produces the usual divergences of quantum field theory .",
    "their removal by appropriate choice , depending on dimension @xmath23 , of parameters in @xmath24 was achieved in @xcite .",
    "explicit formulae for the renormalised functions ( [ harald+harold ] ) at @xmath25 and genus @xmath26 were given .",
    "in a recent paper @xcite we transferred the solution strategy developed by two of us ( h.g.+r.w . ) for the @xmath27-matricial quantum field theory @xcite to the @xmath28-kontsevich model .",
    "this approach uses the ward - takahashi identity for the @xmath29 adjoint action ( first employed in @xcite ) to derive a system of schwinger - dyson equations in which the @xmath30-point function depend only on @xmath31-point functions with @xmath32 .",
    "the initial step for the model is , in a special limit of large matrices coupled with an infinitely strong deformation parameter , an integral equation solved by makeenko and semenoff @xcite . from this point of origin",

    ", this bphz renormalisation scheme @xcite completely avoids the use of ill - defined ( divergent ) quantities .",
    "that the bphz scheme extends smoothly to non - perturbative renormalisation is our first noticeable message .    for reasons explained below we are particularly interested in _ real _ @xmath33 coupling constant , i.e.  @xmath34 in ( [ harald+harold ] ) .",
    "this is a drastic change !",
    "the partition function does not make any sense for real coupling constants .",
    "our point of view is to _ define _ quantum field theory by quantum equations of motion , i.e. schwinger - dyson equations .",
    "these equations can formally be derived from the partition function , but then we forget the partition function , declare the equations as exact and construct exact solutions . whereas the @xmath35-kontsevich model with imaginary coupling constant is asymptotically free @xcite , our real @xmath35-model has positive @xmath36-function .",
    "but this is not a problem ; there is no landau ghost , and the theory remains well - defined at any scale ! in other words , the real @xmath35-kontsevich model could avoid triviality .",

    "the amplitudes of the graphs perfectly sum up to the taylor expansion of the exact result .",
    "the original bphz scheme with normalisation conditions at a single scale leads in just - renormalisable models to the renormalon problem which prevents borel resummation of the perturbation series .",

    "euclidean symmetry and invariance under permutations are automatic .",
    "the most decisive osterwalder - schrader axiom @xcite , _ reflection positivity _ , amounts for the schwinger 2-point function to the verification that the diagonal matrix model 2-point function is a stieltjes function .",

    ".    the original kontsevich model with purely imaginary coupling constant can not be positive .",
    "this property is shared with the @xmath46 matricial quantum field theory @xcite where the stable phase with @xmath47 , where the partition functions has a chance to exist , can not be reflection positive @xcite . for @xmath48 , where the partition function is meaningless",
    ", a lot of evidence has been given @xcite for reflection positivity of the 2-point function .",
    "the exciting question whether also the higher schwinger functions of @xmath1 are reflection positive in @xmath49 is left for future investigation .",
    "we dedicate this paper to the memory of wolfhart zimmermann .",
    "the scientific community owes him , amongst others , the lsz formalism , momentum space taylor subtraction under the integral , the forest formula to handle overlapping divergences , operator product expansion and the reduction - of - couplings scenario .",
    "our contribution applies several of these concepts to a non - perturbative setting .",
    "we are convinced that wolfhart zimmermann would have enjoyed these results .",
    "one of us ( h.g . ) was several times invited ( mostly by julius wess ) to the mpi in munich at fhringer ring . but during these visits and after seminars we got little by little good contacts to wolfhart , too .",
    "it was an honour to give a summary @xcite of our earlier work with r.w .  at the ringberg meeting celebrating the 80th birthday of wolfhart zimmermann .",

    "we extended our previous work @xcite ( on @xmath602 ) to give an exact solution of the @xmath1 large-@xmath2 matrix model in @xmath603 and @xmath604 dimensions .",
    "induction proofs and the difficult combinatorics were unchanged compared with @xmath602 , but the renormalisation , performed in the manner of wolfhart zimmermann , was much more involved .",
    "the main lesson is that our method is powerful enough to handle just renormalisable models with running coupling constant where a perturbative approach is plagued by overlapping divergences and renormalon problem .",
    "none of these perturbative artefacts arises : the exact renormalised correlation functions are analytic in the renormalised @xmath33-coupling constant .",
    "although the bare ( and real ) @xmath35-coupling constant diverges ( positive @xmath36-function ) , the exact solution does not develop a landau pole .",
    "the deepest result established in this paper is the completely unexpected proof that the schwinger 2-point function arising from the large - deformation limit of the @xmath1-model on noncommutative moyal space is reflection positive in @xmath3 and @xmath4 dimensions , but not in @xmath0 .",
    "this result relied heavily on the explicit knowledge of the @xmath1-matrix correlation functions which allowed us to perform the analytic continuation to the complex plane .",
    "consequently , this sector of the theory defines unambiguously a wightman 2-point function of a true relativistic quantum field theory @xcite in @xmath49 dimensions .",
    "we explicitly computed the stieltjes measure of the euclidean quantum field theory , which is the same as the klln - lehmann mass spectrum @xcite of the wightman theory .",

    "in addition there is a scattering spectrum starting at @xmath605 and ranging up to @xmath606 .",
    "the beginning at @xmath605 and not at @xmath607 is strange .",
    "it essentially means that the theory , although in dimension @xmath49 , behaves like a one - dimensional theory where only the energy , and no momentum , is additive .",
    "this sounds somewhat disappointing , but mathematical physics in one dimension @xcite is a rich subject ! of course it remains to be seen whether the interpretation as a scattering spectrum is correct . according to aks @xcite , scattering in dimension",
    "@xmath49 must be accompanied by particle production , which however is absent in integrable models .",
