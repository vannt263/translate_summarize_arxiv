    "in a series of articles from 1979 to 1990 steve kudla and the second named author developed a theory to explain the occurrence of intersection numbers of geometrically defined cycles as fourier coefficients of automorphic forms from the point of view of riemannian geometry and the theory of reductive dual pairs and the theta correspondence ( see eg @xcite ) .",
    "their program was motivated by the work of hirzebruch - zagier @xcite on ` hirzebruch - zagier ' curves in hilbert modular surfaces and shintani @xcite for the ` classical ' modular symbols inside modular curves .",
    "they obtain analogues of the results of @xcite and @xcite for orthogonal , unitary , and symplectic groups of arbitrary dimension and signature .",
    "in particular , their work gives rise to a lift from the cohomology with compact supports for the associated locally symmetric spaces to spaces of holomorphic siegel and hermitian modular forms .",
    "note however that the restriction to cohomology with compact supports implies that their results actually do not include the one obtained by hirzebruch - zagier ( which deals with a smooth compactification of the hilbert modular surface ) .",
    "the typical shape of the results of kudla - millson for the dual pair @xmath0 is as follows .",
    "there exists a theta series @xmath1 ( associated to a carefully chosen vector - valued schwartz function @xmath2 on @xmath3 ) with values in the closed differential forms on @xmath4 , an appropriate , typically non - compact , arithmetic quotient of the orthogonal symmetric space , such that its cohomology class @xmath5 = \\sum_{n \\geq 0 } { \\operatorname{pd}}(c_n)e^{2\\pi i n\\tau}\\ ] ] is a holomorphic modular form of weight @xmath6 for @xmath7 ( in @xmath8 , the upper half plane ) with values in the cohomology of @xmath4 with trivial coefficients . here",
    "@xmath9 are the poincar dual classes to the geometrically defined , totally geodesic , `` special '' cycles @xmath10 in @xmath4 , parameterized by non - negative integers @xmath11 .",
    "these cycles @xmath10 are ( usually ) non - compact and hence define in general homology classes relative to the ( borel - serre ) boundary .",
    "then the ( co)homological pairing of this generating series with the cohomology with compact supports or equivalently with absolute cycles gives rise to a theta lift from these ( co)homology groups to classical modular forms .",
    "the authors of present paper have been developing a program , see @xcite ( for an introductory overview also see @xcite ) , in which they seek to generalize the original work of kudla - millson in various directions . in @xcite , they extended the lift to include non - trivial local coefficients systems .",
    "the main main goal however , is to extend the theta lift to cohomology groups associated to @xmath4 which capture its boundary .    among the finite - volume non - compact quotient cases",
    "there is a family that appears to be amenable to attack using the techniques we have developed so far .",
    "it is the family such that the theta functions @xmath12 ( with potentially non - trivial coefficients ) restricted to the borel - serre boundary of @xmath4 are exact .",
    "equivalently , the special cycles that intersect the borel - serre boundary @xmath13 have intersections that are boundaries in @xmath13 . in this case",
    "it appears that one may obtain a correction term given by another theta series @xmath14 so that the pair @xmath15 is a cocycle in the mapping cone de rham complex associated to the pair @xmath16 .",
    "this pair hence corresponds to a cohomology class on @xmath4 with compact supports whose image in the absolute cohomology coincides with the class of @xmath12 . on the cycle level this construction corresponds to capping off the relative cycles @xmath17 at the boundary to form absolute cycles @xmath18 _ which are homologous to @xmath10 as relative cycles_. in this way one",
    "can then extend the lift to the full cohomology of @xmath4 .",
    "we have in fact implemented this procedure in @xcite to reprove the main result of hirzebruch and zagier @xcite and give a topological interpretation of the remarkable fact of the authors proof in which the desired generating series is expressed as the difference of two non - holomorphic modular forms .",
    "our purpose in this paper is to deal with the most basic case of all , namely geodesics _ with coefficients _ in modular curves , that is , we consider and extend shintani s work @xcite . in our set - up this is the case of @xmath19 whose arithmetic quotients @xmath4 via the special isomorphism with @xmath7 we can interpret as modular curves ( in the non - compact case ) .",
    "furthermore , the special cycles @xmath10 are closed or infinite geodesics ( in the latter case these are the classical modular symbols ) . in @xcite we explain ( in much greater generality ) how one can associate coefficient systems to the cycles @xmath10 .",
    "namely , we let @xmath20 be the @xmath21-th symmetric power of the standard representation of @xmath7",
    ". we can then construct cycles with coefficients @xmath22 } \\in h_1(x , \\partial x , \\widetilde{e_{2k}})$ ] , where @xmath23 is the local system associated to @xmath20 , see below . our main result of @xcite specialized to this case recovers shintani s result @xcite and states that @xmath24})e^{2\\pi i n\\tau } \\in s_{k+3/2}({\\gamma } ' ) \\otimes h^1(x,\\widetilde{e_{2k}})\\ ] ] is a cusp form of weight @xmath25 for a congruence subgroup @xmath26 .",
    "note that shintani formulates his result in terms of weighted periods of cusp forms @xmath27 of weight @xmath28 over the geodesics . via the map",
    "@xmath29 , which induces the eichler - shimura isomorphism , one can obtain our point of view . here",
    "@xmath30 is the standard basis of @xmath31 .",
    "in this situation a remarkable phenomenon occurs . the cycles with trivial coefficients ( i.e. , @xmath32 )",
    "can not be capped off or equivalently the theta functions with trivial coefficients can not be corrected to make them into relative classes . on the other hand _ for any irreducible non - trivial coefficient system @xmath20 the cycles @xmath22}$ ] can be capped off_. equivalently , for non - trivial coefficients the forms @xmath12 of @xcite can be corrected to be compactly - supported .",
    "the actual procedure of capping off a modular symbol ( when it is an infinite geodesic joining two cusps ) with coefficients produces a ` spectacle ' equipped with parallel sections of the coefficent system which we have named a ` spectacle cycle ( with coefficients ) ' .",
    "the oriented graph @xmath33 of figure 1 is of course not a cycle .",
    "it only becomes a cycle when local coefficients are added in a way that we now describe .",
    "let @xmath34 , resp .",
    "@xmath35 , be the intersection of the straight part @xmath36 of the spectacles with the right - hand circle @xmath37 , resp .",
    "the left hand circle @xmath38 .",
    "suppose @xmath33 is embedded in a topological space equipped with a flat bundle @xmath39 .",
    "to promote @xmath33 to a cycle with coefficients in @xmath39 we need a parallel section @xmath40 on @xmath36 , a parallel section on @xmath37 with a jump at @xmath34 whose value is the negative of @xmath41 and a parallel section on @xmath38 with a jump at @xmath42 with value equal to @xmath43 .",
    "it is a remarkable fact ( see the discussion below ) that such cycles can be found implicitly in classical complex analysis ( with @xmath39 a flat complex line bundle ) .    in our situation , we consider the borel - serre compactification @xmath44 of the modular curve @xmath45 which adds a boundary circle to each cusp and @xmath46 .",
    "furthermore , @xmath36 is a modular symbol given by an infinite geodesic in @xmath4 joining two cusps , and the section @xmath47 on @xmath36 takes the constant value @xmath48 .",
    "the circles @xmath49 are the boundary circles at the cusps joined by @xmath36 .",
    "then the sections on @xmath49 arise from solutions to the equation @xmath50 ( which are not unique , and do nt exist if @xmath51 is a lowest weight vector in @xmath20 with respect to the borel attached to the given cusp ) . here",
    "@xmath52 are the ( properly oriented ) generators of the stabilizer of the cusps @xmath49 in @xmath53 .",
    "the idea of adding ` spectacles ' to convert a locally - finite cycle with coefficients ` joining ' two punctures ( or equivalently @xmath54-cycles with coefficients relative to small circles surrounding the punctures ) into a closed cycle with coefficients _ in the same relative cohomology class _ comes from deligne and mostow @xcite - see the picture at the top of page 14 ( deligne and mostow have spectacles with rectangular lenses ) .",
    "deligne and mostow point out the classical antecedents of their construction in the contour integral formula for the @xmath53-function .",
    "the gamma and hypergeometric integrands should be regarded as _ single - valued _ differential one - forms with values in a one - dimensional flat complex line bundle .",
    "the integral of such a form over a contour requires a section of the dual bundle over that contour . in this paper",
    "we are dealing with differential @xmath54-forms and @xmath54-cycles with values in local systems of dimension higher than one that are locally homogeneous for the group @xmath55 .",
    "the spectacle construction in our situation appeared earlier in the work of harder and his school , see eg kaiser",
    "s diplomarbeit @xcite , in their investigation of ( the denominator of ) eisenstein cohomology .",
    "they discuss the cases @xmath56 @xcite and @xmath57 @xcite in detail and integrate eisenstein cohomology classes over the spectacle cycles .    throughout the paper we use the language and",
    "set - up of a rational quadratic space @xmath58 of signature @xmath59 whose arithmetic quotient gives rise to a modular curve @xmath45 , see section  [ prelim ] .",
    "this is necessary for our theta series construction , and is of course also the set - up in shintani s paper . in section  [ spec - section",
    "] , we construct the special cycles in our context and the associated spectacle cycles .",
    "the special cycles @xmath60 arise from a rational vector of positive length @xmath61 , and there is a natural choice to ` promote ' this cycle to one with coefficients",
    "@xmath62}$ ] .",
    "then @xmath22}$ ] is obtained by summing over a set of representatives of @xmath53-equivalence classes of vectors of length @xmath11 in a coset of an even lattice in @xmath58 .    the main result for the construction of the spectacle cycles is lemma  [ v_x - lemma ] .",
    "a rough summary of our considerations in section  [ spec - section ] is    let @xmath44 be the borel - serre compactification of @xmath4 .",
    "let @xmath63 be a modular symbol with coefficients , where @xmath51 is a rational vector in @xmath20 . then if @xmath64 in the homology of @xmath65 , we can associate to @xmath63 a spectacle cycle in @xmath44 which defines an absolute cycle with rational coefficients .",
    "in particular , there are natural choices to obtain spectacle cycles @xmath66}$ ] and @xmath67}$ ] by requiring that the integral of the canonical generators of the cohomology at the boundary over the `` lenses '' vanishes .",
    "we did not seriously consider integral structures in this paper since our focus is different .",
    "however , proposition [ propv_x ] expresses the coefficient vectors of the spectacle explicitly as linear combinations of ( integral ) weight vectors in @xmath20 , where the coefficients are integral multiples of bernoulli numbers and special values of bernoulli polynomials .",
    "it is well - known that if @xmath27 is a holomorphic cusp form of weight @xmath28 then the critical values of the associated @xmath68-function has a cohomological interpretation as the weighted periods of the closed holomorphic @xmath54-form @xmath69 along the @xmath70-axis which may be considered as a locally finite @xmath54-cycle or as a relative cycle ( relative to the borel - serre boundary ) .",
    "in fact , the @xmath70-axis can be realized as a modular symbol @xmath60 for a certain vector @xmath61 .",
    "of course it is immediate that we get the same result by integrating over the corresponding spectacle cycle assuming @xmath71 .",
    "however , if @xmath27 is not cuspidal then we can no longer take the period of @xmath69 over the @xmath70-axis - the integral diverges . for the definition of the @xmath68-function this is usually dealt with by subtracting the constant fourier coefficient from @xmath27",
    ". however this looses the homological interpretation of this value as a period of @xmath69 .",
    "we show that for @xmath71 the second interpretation of the @xmath68-value as the period of @xmath69 over the spectacle cycle stills makes sense ( we push the spectacles in , take the period and show that this period is independent of how much we pushed in ) .",
    "thus we obtain a uniform description of the critical @xmath68-values for all holomorphic modular forms of weight @xmath28 with @xmath71 .",
    "we discuss these issues in section  [ l - section ] , and obtain ( theorem  [ lvalue ] )    [ intro - lvalue ] let @xmath72 , not necessarily a cusp form .",
    "assume that @xmath60 is the imaginary axis in @xmath73 .",
    "then the ( co)homological pairing @xmath74,{c^c_{{\\mathbf{x}},[k ] } } \\rangle$ ] is the central value of the @xmath68-function of @xmath27 .",
    "we have @xmath75 , { c^c_{{\\mathbf{x}},[k ] } } \\rangle = ( -2)^k i^{k+1 } \\lambda(f , k+1),\\ ] ] where @xmath76 is the completed hecke l - function associated to @xmath27 which ( for @xmath77 ) is given by @xmath78 . for the pairing , we interpreted @xmath79}}$ ] as an absolute cycle in @xmath4 .",
    "in fact , all critical values of @xmath27 arise from the pairing of @xmath80 $ ] with spectacle cycles associated to @xmath60 ( with different coefficients ) .",
    "note that kohnen - zagier @xcite ,  4 give a formal definition of the periods of eisenstein series by extending the formulas for cusp forms .",
    "from this perspective we give a geometric interpretation for their procedure .",
    "there is also a different approach to consider the periods of non - cuspidal modular forms over infinite modular symbols .",
    "namely , one can replace @xmath69 by a cohomologous @xmath54-form which extends to @xmath44 . for periods of eisenstein series",
    "this is for example the approach of harder and kaiser@xcite , and also of stevens @xcite ( in a slightly different context ) .",
    "in fact , the explicit description of a spectacle cycle given in proposition [ propv_x ] together with theorem  [ intro - lvalue ] can be used to a slightly different approach to the arithmetic properties of eisenstein cohomology given in @xcite .    in section  [ schwartz - section ]",
    "we introduce the schwartz forms needed to construct the theta series .",
    "we show in section  [ main - section ] that the theta series @xmath81})$ ] for @xmath58 underlying our realization of the shintani lift extends to a form on @xmath44 ( this is in much greater generality the main result of @xcite ) .",
    "the crucial point for us is that the restriction of @xmath81})$ ] to the boundary face of a given cusp @xmath82 is an exact differential form , and there is a ( natural ) primitive @xmath83})$ ] , a theta series for a positive definite @xmath54-dimensional subspace of @xmath58 .",

    "we discuss the general mapping cone construction associated to the pair @xmath16 and also its relationship to the cohomology of compact supports for @xmath4 .",
    "one reason for our detailed discussion is the need to have explicit integral formulas for the kronecker pairings in the different realizations of the cohomology . for future reference",
    "we actually carry this out in greater generality needed for this paper , namely for smooth manifolds with boundary .",
    "the main result is the extension of and is discussed in sections  [ main - section ] and [ modular - section ] .",

    "hence it suffices to consider the lift for representatives of the cokernel of the natural map @xmath89 . for these representatives ,",
    "we take infinite modular symbols @xmath60 with _ different _ coefficients for which the boundary map does not vanish .",
    "then we prove the theorem by explicitly comparing the fourier coefficients of the lift of these infinite modular symbols with the generating series of the intersection numbers with the spectacle cycles @xmath22}$ ] . in a sense",
    ", we are proving the theorem by a hirzebruch - zagier @xcite method .",
    "it turns out that this approach reduces the theorem to a corresponding theta lift for a split space of signature @xmath90 , which we discuss in section  [ 1 - 1-section ] . for @xmath32 , the trivial coefficient case ,",
    "this lift for signature @xmath90 is a special case of a theta lift for the dual pair @xmath91 studied by kudla @xcite . for this @xmath90-lift",
    "we also establish a regularized siegel - weil formula in the spirit of @xcite making explicit the very general results of kudla - rallis .",
    "in particular , we realize classical integral weight eisenstein series of @xmath92 as a theta lift for @xmath93 .",
    "for example , for the standard @xmath56-eisenstein series @xmath94 of even weight we have @xmath95 which we now interpret as a theta series of signature @xmath90 ( where the summation is restricted to the positive cone ) .",
    "moreover , from our perspective the fourier coefficients are a weighted sum over certain @xmath96-cycles in the hyperbolic line .",
    "it is well - known that one can extend the shimura - shintani correspondence to eisenstein series in a somewhat formal way by considering hecke - eigenvalues .",
    "our point is that one can give a geometric extension of the correspondence . in section  [ eisenstein - section ]",
    "we show ( for @xmath56 ) that the lift of eisenstein series of weight @xmath28 indeed gives eisenstein series of weight @xmath25 .    while the theta lift is defined for all congruence subgroups @xmath53 , the definition of the cycles themselves and the topology interpretation a priori require @xmath53 to be torsion - free . since , in many ways the most interesting case is the modular curve itself we conclude in section  [ lastsection ] by explaining how the results of our paper @xcite allow the results of to be extended to the case of quotients of orthogonal symmetric spaces by arithmetic subgroups _ that are not torsion free_.    it is a great pleasure to dedicate this article to steve kudla .",
    "his influence in our work is evident .",
    "we would like to thank him for by now decades of encouragement , collaboration , mathematical discussions , and friendship .",
    "let @xmath58 be a rational vector space of dimension @xmath97 with a non - degenerate symmetric bilinear form @xmath98 of signature @xmath59 .",
    "we write @xmath99 for the associated quadratic form . throughout",
    "we assume that @xmath58 is isotropic , and in fact we realize @xmath58 as the rational traceless @xmath100 matrices . for simplicity",

    "we write @xmath106 , and we set @xmath107 for the real points of @xmath108 .",
    "we pick an orthogonal basis @xmath109 of @xmath110 such that @xmath111 and @xmath112 .",
    "this also gives rise to an orientation of @xmath58 .",
    "explicitly , we set @xmath113 , @xmath114 , and @xmath115 .",

    "note that @xmath119 and @xmath120 are defined over @xmath105 .",
    "we let @xmath121 be the stabilizer of @xmath122 in @xmath123 , and we let @xmath124 be the associated symmetric space . it can be identified with the hyperboloid @xmath125 hence @xmath122 represents the base point @xmath126 of @xmath127 .",
    "the tangent space @xmath128 at the base point is canonically isomorphic to @xmath129 .",
    "we orient @xmath127 by stipulating that @xmath130 is an oriented basis of @xmath128 and propagate this orientation continuously around @xmath127 .",
    "of course we have @xmath131 , and the isomorphism is given explicitly by @xmath132 this intertwines the natural action of @xmath123 on @xmath58 and on @xmath73 : @xmath133 and also preserves the canonical orientation of @xmath73 given by its complex structure .",
    "let @xmath134 be an even lattice of full rank and write @xmath135 for the dual lattice of @xmath68 .",
    "we fix an element @xmath136 and let @xmath53 be a torsion - free congruence subgroup of @xmath56 which takes @xmath137 to itself . in the last section we remove this restriction .",
    "we let @xmath138 be the associated arithmetic quotient .",
    "it is a modular curve .",
    "the set @xmath139 of all isotropic lines in @xmath140 can be identified with @xmath141 , the set of cusps of @xmath142 , by means of the map @xmath143 \\mapsto { \\operatorname{span}}{\\left(\\begin{smallmatrix } -\\alpha\\beta & \\alpha^2 \\\\ -\\beta^2 & \\alpha\\beta\\end{smallmatrix}\\right ) } \\in { \\operatorname{iso}}(v)$ ] . this maps commutes with the @xmath144-actions .",

    "we orient all lines @xmath149 by requiring that @xmath152 is a positively oriented basis vector of @xmath82 .",
