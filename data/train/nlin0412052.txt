    "recent developments in the physics of intrinsic localized modes ( ilm ) @xcite have shown that the ilms are not only conceptually important in theoretical and mathematical physics as ubiquitous fundamental modes in nonlinear , discrete physical systems @xcite but also possess innovative potential applications in fundamental science and technology in addition to their experimental observation @xcite .",
    "areas of such applications cover coupled josephson junctions , photonic crystals , optical lattices in bose - einstein condensates , all - optical logic and switching devices , targeted breaking of chemical bonds , and so on @xcite .",
    "very recently , the interplay between nonlinear dynamics and geometry has attracted particular attention in ilm problems @xcite .",
    "historically , such an observation was first made when formulating model hamiltonians for the dynamics of bases in dna to take care of helical structure , to the best of the authors knowledge @xcite .",
    "the latter problem gave rise to the intuitive introduction of the so - called sine - lattice ( sl ) model @xcite in which inter - site interactions along a given strand are taken to be sinusoidal rather than the conventional quadratic ones .",
    "the sl model later turned out to yield a novel type of ilm , referred to as an intrinsic rotating mode ( irm ) , also termed a roto - breather @xcite .",
    "an example of transition from oscillation to such rotation modes in simulations of molecular crystals can be found in @xcite .",
    "another example of this type is given by curved or bent chains @xcite and long - range interactions on a fixed curved substrate @xcite .",
    "geometric constraints naturally appear in crystalline bodies consisting of relatively rigid atomic clusters .",
    "an important example of this class of materials are the polymorphs of silica ( sio@xmath0 ) , where the structural units , i.e. , sio@xmath1 tetrahedra are corner - linked by oxygen atoms , and the energy cost of deformation of the tetrahedra is much greater than the cost of their mutual rotations .",
    "atoms in the almost rigid clusters move as if they were subjected to a geometrical constraint .",
    "to describe the position of a finite - size molecular cluster , one has to introduce not only translational but also rotational degrees of freedom .",
    "it has been demonstrated that the rotational degrees of freedom can be responsible for the incommensurate phase in quartz @xcite , negative poisson s ratio of cristobalite and quartz @xcite , and negative thermal expansion of beta - quartz @xcite .",
    "similar effects can be observed in other materials with microscopic rotations , such as perovskites ( e.g. , srtio@xmath2 ) containing corner - linked tio@xmath3 octahedra , the kh@xmath0po@xmath1 ( kdp ) family of crystals with comparatively rigid po@xmath1 tetrahedra , among others .    motivated by these investigations , we proposed in a previous paper a mechanical model in which a set of masses on a linear chain are re - arranged to slide on fixed rings @xcite .",
    "such a model was shown to contain rich nonlinear dynamics , exhibiting various types of nonlinear modes ranging from kinks to irms .",
    "the method employed there amounts to applying a specific geometrical constraint to a purely harmonic lattice , leading eventually to equations having the form of a extended version of the sl equations .",
    "it is our purpose here to propose a method for studying the above - mentioned interplay between nonlinearity and geometry in a more general and transparent way .",
    "the basic point of our method is to take three - dimensional ( 3d ) harmonic lattices as a starting point on which geometrical constraints are imposed .",
    "since linear systems constitute a basis for studying physics and mathematics in general , we expect the present method will give much more insight into the problem . the work is composed of two parts : the first presents a general scheme of geometrical constraints , while the second complements it with a detailed study of the ilms in sine- plus linear- lattices resulting from the helical constraints that we impose on the original 3d harmonic lattice .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in the next section , we present a simple 3d harmonic lattice model and consider a general scheme of the geometrical constraint applied to it . in section iii , we introduce the helical constraints as an application of the general method to arrive at helical lattices described by sine - linear - lattice ( sll ) equations interpolating between sl and linear lattice .",
    "section iv is devoted to the study of some properties of the sll equations .",
    "generalization of the sll model is made in section v to include the effect of an on - site potential , giving rise to the ilms .",
    "the last section is devoted to concluding remarks .",
