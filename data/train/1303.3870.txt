    "the idea that the universe through a period of exponential expansion , called inflation @xcite has proved useful for solving the horizon and flatness problems of standard cosmology and in addition providing an explanation for the scale invariant super - horizon perturbations which are responsible of generating the cmb anisotropies and formation of structures in the universe .",
    "a successful theory of inflation requires a flat potential where a scalar field acquires a slow - roll over a sufficiently long period to enable the universe to expand by at least 60 e - foldings during the period of inflation .",
    "there is a wide variety of particle physics models which can provide the slow roll scalar field inflaton for inflation @xcite . from the observations of cmb anisotropy spectrum by cobe and wmap @xcite",
    "it is not yet possible to pin down a specific particle physics model as the one responsible for inflation . in the light of recent discoveries by cms @xcite and atlas @xcite it is of interest to consider the standard model higgs boson as the candidate for inflaton . on the face of it",
    "the idea does not work as the inflaton quartic coupling should be of the order @xmath13 to explain the amplitude of cmb perturbations measured by wmap @xcite while the 125 gev higgs has a quartic coupling @xmath14 at the electroweak scale which can however go down to smaller values at the planck scale due to renormalization @xcite .",
    "however just from the standard model renormalization one can not have the higgs coupling @xmath13 over the entire range of the rolling field ( 10 - 1 ) @xmath15 during inflation and the standard slow roll inflation with a higgs field does not give the observed amplitude and spectrum of density perturbations @xcite .",
    "if the higgs and top mass are fine tuned then there can be a small kink in the higgs potential and the universe trapped in this false vacuum can undergo a period of inflation @xcite .",
    "later a way out of fine tuning the scalar self coupling to unnaturally small values was found out @xcite and it was shown that if one couples the scalar field to the ricci scalar @xmath12 then the effective potential in the einstein frame becomes a slow roll one with the effective scalar coupling being @xmath16 and the amplitude of the density perturbations constrain this ratio rather than @xmath3 , hence @xmath17 can be increased as large as required to get the desired self - coupling @xmath3 .",
    "density perturbations from inflation in the curvature coupled theories were calculated in @xcite .",
    "the equivalence of the density perturbation in jordan and einstein frame was shown by komatsu and futamase @xcite who also calculated the tensor perturbations and showed that the tensor to scalar ratio is generically small in @xmath12 model .",
    "bezrukov and shaposhnikov @xcite revived the large curvature coupling model to motivate the idea that the standard model higgs field could serve as the inflaton in the early universe .",
    "the amplitude and spectral index of density perturbations observed by wmap can be generated by the higgs field with self coupling @xmath18 and curvature coupling @xmath19 @xcite .",
    "this large value of @xmath17 needed however is seen as a problem as at the time of inflation the higgs field is at the planck scale and hence graviton - scalar scatterings due to the curvature coupling of the scalar would become non - unitary @xcite .",
    "ways of solving the unitarity violation problem in the higgs inflation models have been explored in @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we assume that the dominant interaction between higgs field and gravity is through operators of the form = .",
    "[ nonminimal ] this form ( [ nonminimal ] ) of higgs curvature interaction has been mentioned in the ref .",
    "the complete dynamics of the higgs field involves the role of the goldstone modes as has been studied in detail in @xcite .",
    "the multifield dynamics of the goldstone modes gives rise to sizable non - gaussianity .",
    "we will study the dynamics of the higgs mode and impose a charge conservation and cp symmetry such that the goldstone modes of the higgs field do not acquire vevs .",
    "we will take the background higgs field to be =    0 +    where @xmath20 is the higgs mode with mass 126 gev .",
    "our inflation model falls in the class of inflation in @xmath21 theories studied in ref .",
    "our motivation is that we use the higgs quartic coupling @xmath22 where the standard model value of @xmath23 can lie in the range @xmath24 depending on the value of top quark mass @xcite or on new physics @xcite .",
    "we take curvature coupling @xmath17 to be unity and check the possibility of generating the observed density perturbations from higgs inflation by varying parameters @xmath5 , @xmath7 and @xmath3 .",
    "the non minimal coupling @xmath17 has been taken unity in order to improve the unitarity behaviour which increases the natural cutoff scale @xmath25 from @xmath26 to @xmath27 .",
    "we derive the curvature perturbation during inflation in two different ways .",
    "we derive the perturbations of modified einsteins field equation in the jordan frame in presence of the higgs - curvature interaction terms and derive the amplitude and spectral index of curvature perturbation .",
    "we find that to generate the planck@xmath2wp preferred amplitude @xmath28 and spectral index @xmath29 @xcite for @xmath30 we should have @xmath31 ( and for @xmath32 we need @xmath33 ) . in these fits",
    "we take @xmath34 .    in the @xmath12 theory",
    "we can always make a conformal transformation to the einstein frame so one can compute the density perturbations either in einstein frame or jordan frame and the gauge invariant curvature perturbations should be same in both the frames @xcite . in our case with the @xmath35 coupling",
    "we find that no conformal transformation exists which can in general remove this term ( i.e go to an einstein frame ) .",
    "we find that in the general @xmath35 theory such a conformal transformation is only possible if the metric is quasi - de sitter .",
    "the accurate comparision with the experimental data should be made however with the jordan frame results .",
    "calculation of the curvature perturbation in both einstein and jordan frame for the @xmath12 theory has been done previously in ref .",
    "@xcite . in section ( [ s_jordan ] )",
    "we derive the curvature perturbations and tensor perturbation in our theory in the jordan frame and in section ( [ s_einstein ] ) we make a conformal transformation to go to the einstein frame and compute the curvature perturbations . finally in the last section ( [ concl ] ) we compare the results of the two frames and discuss the viability of our considered higgs inflation model .",
    "in this section we introduce a scalar - gravity interaction term @xmath21 in the action and calculate physical quantities related to the inflationary density perturbations such as the spectral index , curvature perturbation and tensor - to - scalar ratio .",
