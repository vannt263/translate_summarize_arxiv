    "the generalization of renormalizable relativistic gauge theories to the standard model ( sm ) was very successful and has been confirmed experimentally in an impressive way , including detailed tests of radiative corrections . , @xmath0 and @xmath1 in the neutrino sector may be the first signs of physics beyond the sm @xcite .",
    "] however , it is important to keep in mind that the mechanism of electroweak ( ew ) symmetry breaking is still mostly untested .",
    "the postulated higgs particle has so far not been observed and there is only indirect evidence from quantum corrections that a sm higgs boson should be lighter than about @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "the higgs sector has furthermore well - known theoretical problems , especially the gauge hierarchy problem , which strongly suggest that new physics exists which is connected to the mechanism of ew symmetry breaking .",
    "whatever the correct symmetry breaking mechanism is , it must satisfy by now a number of stringent direct and indirect constraints . given the success of the sm it is , however , immediately clear how an alternative symmetry breaking scenario can be consistent with data . in the limit",
    "where new physics decouples , it just has to reproduce effectively the sm higgs sector with a light higgs particle @xcite .",
    "if the model has such a decoupling limit , as in the case discussed in this paper , then deviations from the sm can be understood as a departure from the decoupling limit .    motivated by the evidence for neutrino masses , we discuss the possibility that the ew symmetry is broken dynamically by a neutrino condensate .",
    "this would normally lead to neutrino masses of the order of the symmetry breaking scale , i.e.  @xmath3 .",
    "neutrinos may , however , possess both dirac and majorana mass terms and the dynamical generation of large dirac mass terms leads via the see - saw mechanism @xcite to small , phenomenologically acceptable neutrino masses .",
    "a composite higgs particle will emerge that is not affected by the see - saw mechanism , i.e.  it will have a mass of the order of the ew symmetry breaking scale .",
    "the low - energy effective lagrangian in the decoupling limit is therefore the sm , with a composite higgs instead of a fundamental scalar .",
    "a heavy dirac neutrino mass is similar to the heavy top mass of the order of the ew scale , which gave rise to speculations that top condensation might be responsible for ew symmetry breaking @xcite .",
    "however , top condensation is not viable in its simplest version , since it predicts too large top and higgs masses .",
    "different non - minimal models are in principle viable @xcite , and the possibility that third - generation neutrinos contribute to top condensation was studied by martin @xcite .",
    "the condensation of a full fourth generation ( including neutrinos of the fourth generation ) @xcite was also discussed in this context .",
    "we study the case where only neutrinos are responsible for the dynamical breakdown of the ew symmetry .",
    "we briefly discuss a mixed case as well where combined neutrino and top condensation leads to an effective two - higgs scenario with a leptonic and a hadronic higgs particle .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in the next section we discuss the condensation of neutrinos , i.e.  we study the relevant system of coupled gap equations in combination with the see - saw mechanism in the proper mass eigenstate basis .",
    "afterwards , we solve the gap numerically .",
    "the following section contains the phenomenology and the predictions arising from the renormalization group improved compositeness conditions .",
    "section  [ sec:3neutrinos ] contains a short discussion of the option that all three generations of neutrinos condense simultaneously and in section  [ sec:2higgs ] we outline briefly the possibility of a combined neutrino - top condensation scenario .",
    "we assume as mentioned that some physics exists at high energies which yields an effective four - fermion picture similar to weak interactions at low energies .",
    "however , contrary to weak interactions we assume that certain four - fermion couplings become strong enough to trigger the formation of condensates , thus giving masses to some of the fermions via gap equations .",
    "the remaining fermions could e.g.  obtain masses from further four - fermion couplings , which only subdominantly contribute to the gap . for top condensation",
    "it was shown how this can be justified in the context of broken renormalizable gauge theories at high energies , for example in the framework of so - called top - color models @xcite or u(1 ) models @xcite . in this spirit , we consider the particle content of the sm extended by three right - handed neutrinos but without a fundamental higgs field . instead of the sm higgs field",
    "we assume four - fermion couplings involving the lepton doublets and the right - handed neutrinos .",
    "in addition , since the right - handed neutrinos are singlets under the sm gauge group and since there is no protective symmetry , we assume them to have huge majorana masses .    in order to show the essential aspects of such a scenario , we consider first the case where only one of the four - fermion couplings drives the condensation , while the others vanish .",
    "thus , the four - fermion lagrangian is @xmath4 where we have omitted the @xmath5 indices and where @xmath6 , @xmath7 stand for the relevant neutrino degrees of freedom .",
    "moreover , we assume the majorana mass matrix to be diagonal so that the condensing pair of neutrinos can be studied independently .",
    "therefore , we need to consider only one majorana mass term , @xmath8 we will see that this describes the most interesting features of neutrino condensation .",
    "more general scenarios will be discussed briefly in sections  [ sec:3neutrinos ]  and  [ sec:2higgs ] .",
    "the question whether a non - perturbative solution for the ground state exists in the presence of the huge majorana mass , i.e.  if the gap equation has a non - trivial solution , will be studied in section  [ sec : gap ] .",
