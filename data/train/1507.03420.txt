    "though very pioneering , the lane - emden equation is still a versatile and useful modeling device in astrophysics @xcite . to obtain the lane - emden equation one needs to invoke three essential basics : spherical symmetry , hydrostatics equilibrium , and a polytropic equation of state @xcite",
    "of course , the relativistic version of the lane - emden equation is now at our disposal @xcite . in general relativity",
    "one needs to replace the classical hydrostatic equilibrium equation with its relativistic dual .",
    "the well - known tov ( tolman - oppenheimer - volkoff ) equation is in fact the relativistic version of hydrostatic equilibrium @xcite@xcite .",
    "generally , the lane - emden equation can be derived using the polytropic equation of state in the form @xmath0 with @xmath1 being called the polytropic index . the rationale for postulating such a relation between density and pressure originates from thermodynamics . in thermodynamics ,",
    "a polytropic equation comes from the adiabatic condition @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the transferred heat .",
    "one of the immediate consequences then is @xmath4 in which @xmath5 is the pressure , @xmath6 is the density and @xmath7 , the ratio of the two specific heats @xcite .",
    "the isothermal and the adiabatic processes are the most important examples of a polytropic process . to find a comprehensive analysis about the non - relativistic version of the lane - emden equation and its solutions one can refer to clayton ( 1968 ) @xcite .    assuming a polytropic star makes the relativistic structure analysis easier and more interpretable .",
    "solutions should satisfy appropriate boundary condition(s ) in order to explain various astrophysical objects from compact stars to galactic objects @xcite .",
    "almost all polytropic models assume an isotropic pressure . here",
    ", we allow anisotropic cases by assuming different tangential and radial pressure components in the energy - momentum tensor .",
    "all principal pressures ( stresses ) are assumed to have double - polytropic equations of state @xcite .",
    "a number of authors have investigated anisotropic models ( see , @xcite-@xcite ) .",
    "assuming anisotropic stresses is by no means un - natural .",
    "for example , in a compact star , although the radial pressure vanishes at the surface , one still could postulate a tangential pressure to exist .",
    "while the latter does not alter the spherical symmetry , it may create some streaming fluid motions .",
    "the reissner - nordstrom solution is another relativistic solution which is supported by anisotropic stresses .",
    "a charged black hole readily results in negative radial pressure , while the tangential pressure remains positive . on galactic scales , a spherical galaxy",
    "is well described by the king - michie family of models @xcite , which involves an anisotropic pressure .",
    "this anisotropic pressure originates from the fact the phase space distribution function of the stars depends on coordinates and velocities only through the constants of motion ( energy and angular momentum ) .",
    "if the distribution function depends on the magnitude of the angular momentum , this will lead to an anisotropic pressure , even if the system is spherically symmetric .    in what follows ,",
    "we first derive the tov equation for an anisotropic fluid with spherical symmetry ( next section ) . in section",
    "[ 3 ] , we will derive analytical solutions with regular behavior at the center .",
    "section [ kilsec ] is devoted to a study of killing horizons and energy conditions .",
    "the last section reflects concluding remarks .",
    "although for most cases the classical hydrostatic equation suffices , when the gravitational field becomes strong , using a general relativistic version of the hydrostatic equilibrium equation becomes inevitable .",
    "if one starts from a spherically symmetric metric assuming an isotropic energy - momentum tensor one ends with the famous tov equation @xcite @xmath8 where @xmath5 is the pressure and @xmath9 is the mass variable defined by @xmath10 from now on , we release the assumption of isotropic pressure and let the tangential and radial pressures to be different .",
    "let us take the following static and spherically symmetric metric for describing a gravitating relativistic sphere in schwarzchild coordinates : @xmath11 @xmath12 where @xmath13 is a function of the radial coordinate @xmath14 .",
    "introducing an orthonormal spherically symmetric basis @xmath15 and using @xmath16 for the torsion - free spacetime , the nonzero components of the connection form will be @xmath17 @xmath18 @xmath19 @xmath20 we also have the energy - momentum conservation law in the form @xmath21 where @xmath22 stands for absolute exterior differential @xcite and @xmath23 is the energy - momentum 1-form @xmath24 in our case , @xmath25 can be written in the form @xmath26 note that there is no summation over indices in ( [ tt ] ) , and @xmath27 and @xmath28 are defined as @xmath29 and @xmath30 where @xmath31 and @xmath32 are the radial and tangential pressures ( stresses ) .    from the conservation law ( [ cons ] ) one obtains @xmath33 for @xmath34 we have @xmath35 substituting for the connection forms from ( [ eq18])-([eq21 ] ) we obtain @xmath36 using the metric ( [ eq1 ] ) and matter field ( [ 12 ] ) , the first two components of the einstein field equations reduce to @xmath37 which is equivalent to @xmath38 .",
    "on the other hand ( [ eq5 ] ) can be written as @xmath39 where prime stands for differentiation with respect to @xmath14 .",
    "solving for @xmath13 yields @xmath40 with @xmath41 is the constant of integration .",
    "though having a singularity ( black hole ) at the origin is among the possibilities and should be explored separately , for the moment we ignore the first term of the above equation in the following relations .",
    "consequently @xmath13 reduces to @xmath42 where @xmath9 is the gravitational mass inside radius @xmath14 in such a way that @xmath43 substituting for @xmath13 and @xmath44 in ( [ ml ] ) we finally obtain @xmath45 which is the generalized tolman - oppenheimer - volkoff ( tov ) equation .",
    "it can be seen that eq .",
    "( [ otov ] ) readily reduces to the standard tov ( [ tov ] ) when @xmath46 .",
    "we will look for solutions of the generalized tov equation which are asymptotically schwarzschild , in the following section .",
    "in this section , we will derive analytical solutions of the generalized tov equation which are non - singular throughout the space and asymptotically approach the schwarzschild spacetime . in",
    "what follows , we assume that the radial and tangential pressures obey the following barotropic equations of state ( eos ) : @xmath47 @xmath48 here @xmath49 is the central density and @xmath50 are the dimensionless eos parameters .",
    "these eoss are composed of two terms .",
    "the first term is linear which is the most widely used one in astrophysics and cosmology .",
    "the second term allows a polytropic behavior which is familiar in astrophysical applications , leading to the lane - emden equation in the theory of stellar structure @xcite . since from eq .",
    "( [ eq5 ] ) we have the equality @xmath51 one obtains @xmath52 and @xmath53 in eq .",
    "( [ 23 ] ) .",
    "this value for @xmath54 shows that we are encountering a dark - energy - like situation .",
    "existence of negative pressure warns us about possible violation of energy conditions .",
    "however , nowadays energy condition violating matter has become much more popular in the literature ( e.g. dark energy , wormhole theory , quantum effects ) . in particular",
    ", the existence of a strongly negative pressure is an essential ingredient in dark energy models .",
    "lobo @xcite presented a generalization of the gravastar picture , by considering a matching of an interior solution governed by the dark energy equation of state @xmath55 , to an exterior schwarzschild vacuum solution at a junction interface .",
    "he assumed an isotropic pressure there .",
    "the present work differs from @xcite in three respects .",
    "first , the fluid pressure is assumed to be anisotropic .",
    "second , the eos is not assumed to be linear , and third , we do not cut off the matter density at a certain radius , thus there is no need to apply matching conditions at the surface .",
    "the 22 and 33 components of the einstein equations give @xmath56 eqs.([eq5 ] ) and ( [ eq8 ] ) can be simplified by introducing @xmath57 in the following form @xmath58 @xmath59 respectively . here , the subscript @xmath60 indicates derivative with respect to the variable @xmath60 . taking derivative with respect to @xmath60 from eq .",
