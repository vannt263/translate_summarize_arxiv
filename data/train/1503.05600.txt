    "in earlier work @xcite the effect of scaling of number systems on some quantities in physics and geometry was described .",
    "the work was based on the description of mathematical systems of different types as structures or models that satisfy a set of axioms relevant to the type of each system @xcite .",
    "as presented , the work may have been difficult to understand .",
    "the concern of this paper is to place this work on a more secure and , hopefully , easier to understand foundation .",
    "the concept of mathematical systems as structures is retained .",
    "structures for a system of a given type consist of a base set , a set of a few base operations , a possibly empty set of a few base relations , and a set of a few constants .",
    "examples of structures are those for the natural numbers , @xmath1 which satisfy the axioms for arithmetic @xcite and the real numbers , @xmath2 that satisfy the axioms for a complete ordered field @xcite .",
    "this work begins with the idea that there are two separate concepts that are combined or identified in these number structure representations .",
    "these are the concepts of numbers or labels for the elements of the base sets , @xmath3 or @xmath4 @xcite and the concept of the values that the numbers have in the structures .",
    "as long as one works with just one ( standard ) natural number structure @xmath5 and just one real number structure , @xmath6 the distinction between these concepts can be ignored .",
    "this is the case in the usual descriptions of numbers in mathematical analysis and in the use of mathematics in physics and geometry .",
    "the distinction between these two concepts can not be ignored when one considers the existence of many number structures of a given type that are related by scaling factors .",
    "one finds that the base sets , @xmath3 and @xmath4 when considered by them selves as sets , have no meaning as sets of number values .",
    "the elements of the sets acquire meaning only as base sets of structures satisfying relevant axioms .",
    "it turns out that a given element of @xmath3 or @xmath7 can have many different values .",
    "the particular value depends on the structure containing the base set .",
    "the value of a base set element in a number structure is defined by the properties it has .",
    "a simple example of this is shown in the next section .",
    "two natural number structures are described , one is the usual one and the other is a structure for the even natural numbers .",
    "some of the base set elements have two different values .",
    "they have one value in the usual structure and another in the structure for the even natural numbers .",
    "section [ ns ] extends the example of natural numbers to real and complex number and to vector spaces .",
    "it also applies to integers and rational numbers , even though they are not discussed here .",
    "two different types of maps between structures of a given type are described , those that are the identity on the base sets and change number values , and those that preserve number values , but are scaling permutations of the base set elements .",
    "a brief description is given of the similarity of assignment of meaning to the base set elements and decoding of the base set elements .",
    "the following section gives fiber bundle descriptions of these number and vector space structures over a manifold , @xmath0 .",
    "here @xmath0 is taken to be flat as in space time or euclidean space .",
    "bundles for scalars and for vector spaces with associated scalars are described .",
    "the fibers consist of either scalar or scalar and vector space structures at all possible scaling levels .",
    "the structures at different levels all have the same values .",
    "they differ in which base set elements have a given value .",
    "a fiber at point @xmath8 of @xmath0 has a complete set of structures at all scaling levels .",
    "section [ cs ] describes connections between fibers at neighboring locations and sections as fields on the bundle .",
    "the connections are used to describe covariant derivatives of fields over @xmath9 the fields described here are different from those in gauge theories in that they have two connection dimensions .",
    "one is the usual one over @xmath0 .",
    "the other is the connection over the different fiber levels .",
    "two types of fields are discussed .",
    "one type consists of fields whose values are scalar structures or the product of scalar and vector structures .",
    "these are fiber elements .",
    "the other type consists of fields whose values are either scalars or are products of scalars and vectors .",
    "the structures containing the field values are at different fiber locations and levels in the fibers .",
    "section [ gt ] describes gauge theories based on the fiber bundle setup described here .",
    "covariant derivatives for abelian and nonabelian theories for @xmath10 dimensional vector spaces are described .",
    "four vector gauge fields are present in addition to the three vector bosons present in the nonabelian case .",
    "the two fields , one real and one imaginary , associated with the scaling degree of freedom , appear to be gradients of scalar fields , the other two fields , also one real and one imaginary , are associated with the locations on @xmath0 .",
    "the imaginary field seems to have the properties of the electromagnetic field .",
    "the physical properties , if any , of the real location field and the complex scaling field are unknown at present .",
    "a discussion section on open problems and extensions of the results obtained here ends the paper .",
    "this work on scaling of number and vector space structures seems to be carried out in isolation as a literature search came up empty .",
    "however recent papers on the relativization of arithmetic and symmetries in physics @xcite and on the mathematical universe @xcite does touch on some of the ideas presented here .",
    "also the type of scaling described here seems to be different from that in conformal theories @xcite .",
    "the reason is that all number values are scaled , including those for angles and for lengths .",
    "however the property of scaling is such that trigonometric relations are preserved under scaling .",
    "the material in this section is basic to everything that follows . to begin one must have some idea of what mathematics is about .",
    "here the view is taken that mathematics consists of a large number of structures of different types with many relations between the structures @xcite .",
    "examples of structure types are the different types of numbers , natural , integers , rational , real , complex , vector spaces of different types algebras , etc .    a structure of a given type consists of a basic set , a few basic operations , none or a few basic relations , and none or a few basic constants .",
    "a generic representation of a structure has the form @xmath11 here @xmath12 is the base set , @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the sets of basic operations and relations , and @xmath15 denotes the set of constants , if any .",
    "an overline as in @xmath16 distinguishes a structure from the base set @xmath12 of the structure .",
    "structures of a given type must satisfy a set of axioms relevant to the structure type .",
    "this is in essence the mathematical logical description of semantic or meaningful models of formal systems as syntactic or meaningless systems with a given set of expressions as the formal axioms @xcite .",
    "examples of structures of different types are @xmath17the natural numbers satisfy the axioms of arithmetic @xcite , and the real and complex numbers satisfy axioms for a complete ordered field @xcite and an algebraically closed field of characteristic @xmath18 @xcite .",
    "the inverse operation is denoted by @xmath19 complex conjugation has been added as a basic operation to the complex number structure even though it is not part of the usual representation .",
    "these structures and those for the integers and rational numbers , represent the usual structures in wide use in physics and mathematics .",
    "the basic point to make is that these structures and those of other types conflate or identify two distinct concepts .",
    "one is the description of the base set elements as numbers .",
    "the other is the values the numbers have in number structures . in other words ,",
    "the base set elements , when considered by themselves , have no intrinsic meaning or values .",
    "they acquire meaning or values only as part of a structure . to emphasize this the elements of the base sets of the structures in eq .",
    "[ bnrc ] are referred to a numbers .",
    "this is distinct from the values they have in a structure .",
    "this is seen by the observation that in different structures of the same type the values of the numbers are different .",
    "their values depend on the structure containing them .",
    "a simple example illustrates this point .",
    "consider the natural number structure @xmath20 the elements of the base set have names , `` 0'',``1'',``2 '' , etc .",
    "the quotes denote the fact that these are element names . in @xmath5",
    "the elements @xmath21 have value @xmath22    it is clear that the even numbers , `` 0'',``2'',``4'',etc . in the base set @xmath3 form a base set , @xmath23 of a valid natural number structure @xmath24",
    "this follows from the observation that even numbers also make a good representation of the natural numbers : one can count with them and do arithmetic with them .",
    "the structure , @xmath24 , for these numbers is @xmath25 in this structure @xmath26 still has value @xmath18 .",
    "however the element @xmath27 has value @xmath28 .",
    "this is different from the value of @xmath27 in @xmath20 the same difference holds for any base set element @xmath29 .",
    "this element has value @xmath30 in @xmath31 and value @xmath32 in @xmath20    values of base set elements of a structure are determined by the properties they have .",
    "these are derived from the axioms .",
    "for example the value @xmath28 is assigned to @xmath27 in @xmath24 because it satisfies the multiplicative identity axiom in that @xmath33 for all number values , @xmath34    the subscript @xmath10 is a structure identifying label .",
    "it identifies structure membership of a number value .",
    "the value @xmath35 is a fixed meaningful value , but without a structure identifying label one has no idea which of the base set elements has value @xmath35 .",
    "this description of even number structures extends to structures @xmath36 for any @xmath22 the base set of this structure , @xmath37 consists of the numbers , @xmath38 , etc .",

    "note that @xmath50    an interesting point is that the number , @xmath51 is the only base set element whose value , as the additive identity , is the same in all structures .",

    "each element can have any value or possibly none at all .",
    "the elements of @xmath7 or @xmath405 acquire value or meaning only as base sets contained in structures that satisfy relevant sets of axioms .",
    "this is more in accord with the quantum mechanical view of properties of physical systems .",
    "a particle , described by a wave function , has no specific position or momentum .",
    "any values are possible , subject to the position momentum uncertainty principle .",
    "a single measurement on a system gives , as outcomes , values of these quantities .",
    "repeated measurements on different identically prepared systems , give different outcome values .",
    "the probabilities of different values are properties obtained from the wave function .",
    "the correspondence with base sets @xmath7 and @xmath405 is that , like the wave function particle description , any value is possible for the elements of the base sets when considered by themselves . a single measurement of particle position or momentum , yields a value as an outcome",
    ". this is like measuring the value of an element of the base set where the outcome is a value for the measured element .",
    "this is equivalent to choosing the value structure in which the base set element measured has `` measured '' value .",
    "further exploration of the correspondence between particle mechanics and base sets in number structures is left to the future . here",
