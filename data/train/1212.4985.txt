    "the idea of inflation  @xcite has now become a part of standard cosmological evolution scenario .",
    "it provides beautiful explanations for the nearly flat isotropic / homogeneous universe and the origin of primordial density fluctuation , which results in rich observed cosmological structures . for successful inflation",
    ", the energy of the inflaton , which drives the inflationary expansion of the universe , must be transferred to the radiation consisting of hot standard model ( sm ) plasma .",
    "this process , called _ reheating _ , is rather an unknown aspect of inflation  @xcite , partly because the process is model dependent and partly because the era of reheating is difficult to be explored observationally .",
    "however , the reheating temperature @xmath4 , corresponding to the temperature of the hot plasma at the beginning of the radiation dominated era , is an important characteristics of inflation model since it often determines the efficiency of leptogenesis / baryogenesis and the abundance of ( unwanted ) relics such as the gravitino and moduli .    in a conventional picture ,",
    "the inflaton is assumed to have a coupling to light fields and perturbatively decays into them . produced light sm particles are thermalized and constitute radiation component of the universe thereafter . in this case",
    ", the reheating temperature simply depends on the perturbative decay rate of the inflaton : @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the relativistic degrees of freedom at the temperature @xmath7 , @xmath8 denotes the inflaton decay rate evaluated at the vacuum and @xmath9 is the reduced planck scale . here",
    "we defined this quantity , @xmath10 , as `` would - be - reheating temperature '' .",
    "however , this simple picture does not hold for some inflation models for the following reasons .",
    "first , the inflaton is oscillating around its potential minimum , and hence masses of coupled particles also oscillate with time , which would invalidate the use of the inflaton decay rate at the vacuum  @xcite .",
    "second , before the complete decay of the inflaton , the universe is often already filled with high - temperature plasma .",
    "thus light particles , including sm particles , obtain thermal masses and should be treated as quasi - particles , which would significantly modify the inflaton decay rate into these particles . on this second aspect ,",
    "it was pointed out that large thermal masses of decay products prevent the inflaton decay and the temperature of plasma can not be as high as the inflaton mass ( divided by a coupling constant )  @xcite .",
    "this is not true : in high - temperature environment , the quasi - particles obtain thermal widths and the inflaton dissipates its energy into thermal plasma as was explicitly shown in refs .",
    "@xcite in the context of reheating .",
    "intuitively this is understood as a result of efficient scattering processes between inflaton and quasi - particles in thermal plasma .",
    "thus actual thermal history would be much more complicated and , in particular , the reheating temperature would be significantly different from the estimate ( [ tr_wb ] ) .    in this paper",
    "we address the issues of thermalization and reheating after inflation in detail .",
    "we start from the inflaton oscillation just after inflation and show how particle production and their thermalization occur . then we study the evolution of the inflaton oscillation and plasma by taking into account the inflaton dissipation in high - temperature plasma and also the non - perturbative particle production , until the inflaton dissipates all its energy , after which the radiation dominated universe begins .",
    "formulations for these effects are found in our previous paper  @xcite , where dynamics of scalar fields in thermal environment was studied in detail .",
    "it is shown that deviation from the conventional reheating scenario becomes more prominent for smaller inflaton mass , and hence we mainly focus on low - scale inflation model .",
    "such low scale inflation is actually realized in the higgs inflation  @xcite , where the sm higgs field plays a role of inflaton , since its mass around the vacuum is weak scale .",

    "hence , hereafter , we mainly concentrate on the large amplitude case : @xmath29 .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to clarify the thermalization and reheating process in this class of models , especially the reheating temperature , by solving the evolution of inflaton and plasma system .",
    "the basic ingredients that we will use in the following discussion are found in detail in our previous paper  @xcite and here we briefly repeat the results .",
    "let us see what happens after inflation in the following subsections .",
    "after the inflation , the inflaton starts to oscillate around its potential minimum with an initial amplitude @xmath24 .",
    "hence , the coupled field @xmath12 has an amplitude - dependent dispersion relation : @xmath30 where @xmath31 denotes a possible thermal mass . initially the thermal mass vanishes ( @xmath32 ) , since there is no background plasma . if @xmath33 , the perturbative decay of the inflaton into @xmath12 creates thermal plasma as in a conventional scenario . on the other hand ,",
    "if @xmath34 , such a process is kinematically blocked due to the @xmath11-dependent mass of @xmath12 at the most time domains in each one oscillation of the inflaton .",
    "instead , the following non - perturbative particle production process becomes important .",
    "field is possible , but its efficiency is lower than that of the non - perturbative particle production . ]",
    "the efficient non - perturbative particle production occurs when the adiabaticity of the coupled @xmath12 fields is broken down  @xcite : @xmath35 . from this inequality ,",

    "is met , the @xmath12 s modes below the typical momentum @xmath40 are amplified in each oscillation , and the typical number density for one degree of freedom can be evaluated as @xmath41 in each oscillation .    after the @xmath11 passes through the origin , the produced particles become heavy due to the field value of oscillating @xmath11 , and their decay rate becomes large correspondingly .",
    "if the decay rate of @xmath12 : @xmath42 is sufficiently large , they eventually decay into the other light degrees of freedom at @xmath43 well before the @xmath11 reaches its maximum value  @xcite .",
    "this is the case for @xmath44 , if we assume that the typical decay rate of @xmath12 is given by @xmath45 .",
    "in this case , a linear potential for @xmath11 generated by the produced particles  @xcite is insignificant , since the produced particles decay when the inflaton field value reaches @xmath46^{1/2 } \\ll \\tilde \\phi$ ] .",
    "in addition , if the inflaton couples to the bosonic fields @xmath47 , this condition guarantees the absence of violent parametric resonant phenomena .",
    "unless the coupled bosonic particles decay before the inflaton moves back to the origin , the production rate of these bosonic particles is enhanced due to the induced emission effect .",
    "thus , their number density grows exponentially whenever the inflaton passes through the origin , and as a result , the system may enter the so - called turbulent regime as shown in refs .",

    "the produced thermal plasma can significantly affect subsequent dynamics of oscillating inflaton field . aside from the blocking effect on the non - perturbative production due to the thermal mass , which we discussed in the previous section ,",
    "there are basically two effects from thermal environment : ( i ) thermal effective potential for the inflaton and ( ii ) dissipation of the inflaton to thermal plasma .",

    ", the oscillating scalar field @xmath11 can not decay into light degrees of freedom , since these would - be decay products acquire thermal masses which are larger than the @xmath11 mass .",
    "however , the oscillating scalar can dissipate into thermal plasma through multiple scattering by light particles in thermal plasma , or more precisely through thermal width of each quasi - particle excitation .",
    "the dissipation coefficient depends on the value of @xmath11 , and its dependence can be divided into two regimes : ( i ) small field value regime @xmath70 and ( ii ) large field value regime @xmath71 . in the case ( i ) ,",
    "the coupled @xmath12 particles are relativistic and its number density is given by @xmath72 .",
    "hence , the oscillating scalar dissipates its energy through scatterings involving @xmath12 particles . on the other hand , in the case ( ii ) ,",
    "such processes are unlikely to occur since the @xmath12 particles become very heavy due to the amplitude of @xmath11 and the number density of @xmath12 is exponentially suppressed correspondingly . therefore ,",
    "the oscillating scalar dissipates its energy mainly by multiple scattering of gauge bosons through a higher dimensional operator obtained from integrating out the heavy @xmath12 field .",
    "consequently , the dissipation coefficient for @xmath69 can be evaluated as  @xcite @xmath73 where @xmath74 here @xmath75 stands for the dimension of @xmath12 s representation @xmath76 of gauge group and @xmath77 is the index of @xmath12 s representation @xmath76 defined by @xmath78 $ ] , and @xmath79 is a numerical constant , typically @xmath80 . for our numerical calculation ,",

    "for example , in the higgs inflation  @xcite scenario ( see refs .",
    "@xcite for its realization in nmssm ) , the inflaton mass around the vacuum is weak scale .",
    "although @xmath166 potential is dominant after inflation and the evolution of inflaton / plasma system would be different from our model , the final process of reheating can not be understood without taking the dissipation effect into account , as studied in this paper .",
    "mssm inflation  @xcite is another example in which the inflaton is very light .",
    "non - perturbative particle production is expected at the first several oscillations  @xcite , but the final reheating may be caused by dissipative effects in thermal plasma .",
    "similar results may hold for alchemical inflation scenario  @xcite , in which the inflaton has a mass of soft susy breaking scale and oscillates around the origin after inflation .",
    "it will also be useful for reheating after a class of thermal inflation model  @xcite .",
    "it should also be noticed that the evolution of thermal plasma before the complete reheating in these cases can significantly differ from a conventional scenario .",
    "phenomenological consequences , such as relic abundance of heavy particles created in high - temperature plasma and the efficiency of baryogenesis , may not be characterized by a single parameter @xmath4 , but by a detailed thermal history before reheating .",
    "we will further generalize our results and apply to concrete models in a separate paper .",
    "if the inflaton oscillates around a large vev as in the case of new inflation  @xcite , it is expected that the dissipation effect would be much milder and the conventional reheating scenario by the perturbative decay would be appropriate for broader parameter spaces .",
    "this might also be true in hybrid inflation  @xcite , although it is rather non - trivial because the inflaton oscillates around the origin while the waterfall field oscillates around a large vev .",
    "we leave these issues for a future work .",
    "finally we comment on the fate of particle - like excitations of inflaton . in the case where thermal dissipation plays a crucial role for the reheating with @xmath167 ,",
    "the inflaton particles are expected to have ( nearly ) thermal abundance .",
    "when the temperature decreases to @xmath168 after the completion of reheating , the inflaton freezes out from thermal bath . at this stage ,",
    "the perturbative decay of the inflaton opens since the temperature is lower than the inflaton mass , and the decay rate is given by @xmath169 , which is much larger than the hubble rate at this epoch , @xmath170 unless @xmath14 is extremely small .",
    "therefore , the inflaton particles decay into light species and disappear as soon as they freeze out from thermal bath .",
