    "around redshifts of @xmath103 , luminous quasars were orders of magnitude more numerous than today .",
    "although the physics of how active galactic nuclei evolve is still not understood , several links between galaxy and quasar evolution have emerged over recent years .",
    "the observational confirmation of supermassive black holes in the nuclei of all galaxies with a substantial bulge component ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) makes every such galaxy a potential agn host .",
    "the strong evolution of the agn space density could therefore be related to the availability of accretion fuel in the host galaxies , or to the frequency of agn triggering events .",
    "gravitational interaction and major or minor merging of galaxies have long been suggested as important factors in driving nuclear activity in galaxies . confirming any of these as the dominant process has proved difficult , mainly because the morphological characteristics found for relatively nearby agn host galaxies are so diverse .",
    "furthermore , the properties of the hosts in the ` heyday ' of quasars ( @xmath11 ) are still elusive , a consequence of the substantial observational difficulties .",
    "the contrast between the bright nuclear point sources and the surrounding galaxy increases dramatically beyond @xmath12 as a result from both surface brightness dimming and waveband shifts towards the rest frame uv .",
    "the last years have seen numerous attempts to resolve the host galaxies of high - redshift quasars .",
    "owing to the observational challenges of detecting distant host galaxies the observational effort for each object is large , and the observed samples have consequently been very small , of the order of @xmath13 per target group . while radio - loud quasars appear to be very extended and have been resolved out to @xmath14 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ) , this is not the case for the large majority of radio - quiet quasars .    at high redshifts",
    "two constraints dominate observational studies of host galaxies : on one side , very good seeing conditions are required to maximize the spatial contrast of the compact nuclear source compared to the extended host galaxy . on the other , large telescope apertures are preferrential to trace faint quasar hosts to as far away from the nucleus as possible .",
    "thus significant progress had to wait for 8m - class telescopes at very good sites with active optics systems  with a very high light collecting power but atmospheric seeing limitations  and for the _ hst _  and its high space - based sensitivity , combined with unprecedented spatial resolution , but limited size that might miss light from faint outer structures of the hosts .",
    "some host galaxies of radio - quiet quasars at @xmath15 have now been resolved both in the near infrared @xcite and in the optical domains @xcite , showing these objects to be moderately luminous , corresponding to present - day @xmath16 or slightly brighter .    however , host galaxy colours have been unavailable , precluding estimates of the mass - to - light ratio ( @xmath17 ) .",
    "thus , without colours the observed luminosities , and their evolution with redshift , can not be mapped to the mass evolution if young stars contribute a major fraction of agn host s light .",
    "this is important as several high - luminosity quasars at @xmath11 appear to be located in very uv - luminous host galaxies @xcite .",
    "also , at low redshifts there is a link between nuclear activity and enhanced global star formation in the host galaxies .",
    "@xcite reported that sdss spectra of local seyfert  2 galaxies show a significant contribution from young stellar populations , and that this trend is strongly correlated with nuclear luminosity . in a multicolour study of low-@xmath18 qso hosts",

    "these results indicate that in the recent past the star formation activity in galaxies hosting an agn may be different from normal galaxies .",

    "clearly more information is required to investigate the relation of starformation and agn activity , their common cause or causal order and the evolution of these properties with redshift .",
    "the new generation of wide - field imaging mosaics obtained with the hubble space telescope ( _ hst _ ) , especially in the conjunction with deep agn surveys , has opened a new observational avenue towards agn host galaxy studies .",

    "2004 , in prep . ) .",
    "as the deblending of nuclear and host galaxy component with two - dimensional modelling is sensitive to background sources , we applied an extra procedure to remove net residuals in the local background .",
    "this included an iterative masking of all objects in the field and the determination of the local background from the object - free regions .",
    "for each square of @xmath54 pixels an average from the unmasked pixels was computed , with a subsequent bilinear interpolation between these values to yield a background estimate for the whole field . after background adjustment , small subimages of @xmath55 pixels were extracted around all agns , corresponding to a field of view of @xmath56 .",
    "this field size contains @xmath57  % of the acs psf flux .",
    "since the agn are not strongly resolved this fraction also applies to the agn flux .",
    "the data reduction procedure kept record of the individual pixel weights throughout the process of reduction and combination .",
    "this information was then used in combination with the shot noise derived from pixel count rates to construct variance images which were later used in the error budget calculations .",
    "compared to ground based telescopes , the point spread function ( psf ) of acs is very stable in time . however , coma , astigmatism and defocus from surface height variations of the two ccds lead to variations over the field of view that need to be taken into account .",
    "the variations are much weaker than for the wfpc2 camera but remain non - negligible .",
    "also the ` breathing ' of _ hst _  changes the focal length which leads also to a small time variability in the psf . in figure",
    "[ fig : psf ] we show the mean acs psf compiled from @xmath8500 stars in the extensive gems  area and the variation of the psf over the fov .",
    "+    the variations were also investigated by @xcite from the crowded field of 47  tucanae .",
    "such an analysis was not possible for individual gems  fields due to the small number of stars ( @xmath810 ) per field .",
    "thus a simultaneous characterisation of the spatial and temporal variations was not possible .",
    "however , since the spatial variations dominate ( further details of our investigations of the acs psf variations will be given in a dedicated technical paper , jahnke et al .",
    "2004 , in prep . )",
    "we used the large number of unsaturated stars in the gems  area to construct an empirical psf individually for each object . at a given position we combined the nearest @xmath835 undisturbed stars to create a position - specific psf estimate . in this way we average over time , but only stars from a radius @xmath58 were used , and psf shape errors due to _ spatial _ variation were minimized , while a very high s / n was achieved for each of these psf estimates .",
    "finally , the subimage of each agn and its connected psf were registered to a common centroid .    from our psf analysis we found that while coherent large - scale variations were essentially absent within each stack of @xmath835 psf stars , there was still considerable mismatch between the individual stars , in particular in the central pixel regions .",
    "as such mismatched pixels could be spuriously assigned to a host galaxy , we took the variations within each psf stack to derive rms frames describing an inherent psf uncertainty ; these were then also included in the variance images , artificially reducing the weight in the inner pixel regions .",
    "psf rms errors per pixel range from up to 30% in individual pixels inside 1  fwhm to 515  % inside @xmath59 , and to generally below 5% outside .      for luminous agn at high redshifts , separating the galaxy image from the nuclear point source is a daunting task .",
    "even with a very good knowledge of the psf , the problem is still that the relative scalings of galaxy and agn are not known _",
    "a priori_. in fact , one can not even be certain that the host galaxy is detectable at all and not swamped by the central point source .",
    "we therefore started out with the well - established technique of simple psf subtraction .    in each case , the psf was scaled to the central flux of the agn , integrated inside a circular aperture of 4 pixel ( 012 ) diameter centered on the nucleus .",
    "this radius encircles approximately 34% of the total energy of a point source .",
    "a smaller radius ( e.g.  1 pixel ) would become too sensitive to shot noise and psf mismatch , while larger radii contain a significantly higher fraction of the total flux ( 50%/60%/70% at 3/4/5 pixel radius ) and thus would make a detection of any host galaxy component successively harder .",
    "this procedure somewhat oversubtracts the nuclear component by an amount corresponding to the underlying host galaxy contribution inside the encircled region . however , this method yields strictly conservative estimates the host galaxy flux , i.e.  always unserestimating it .",
    "we used extensive simulations to determine correction factors for this oversubtraction ( see section  [ sec : errors ] ) .",
    "the peak - scaled psf subtraction method has the advantage of being independent of any assumption about the host galaxy morphology .      as a second method we employed the modelling package galfit  in version 1.7a @xcite that allows the simultaneous fitting of several two - dimensional components to an image , convolved with a given psf .",
    "we describe our application of galfit  to quasar images in @xcite in detail .",
    "in total we ran galfit  in three configurations , always fitting two components , which were the point - source nucleus and either an exponential disk @xcite , a @xmath60 de  vaucouleurs spheroid @xcite , or a @xcite model with the srsic index as a free parameter .",
    "however , simulations ( sect .",
    "[ sec : errors ] ) showed that with the present data , the galfit  version used was operating near its limit , due to the very high contrast between nuclei and host galaxies . in the context of this paper",
    "we thus used galfit  only as a cross - check on the peak subtraction method .      to determine the limits for detecting host galaxies we constructed a sample of 200",
    "randomly selected unsaturated stars , 100 in each observed band , to mimic unresolved quasars . this way we could investigate how our nucleus - removal techniques responded to a undetectable host galaxy , and we could set limits on the size and shape of expected residuals , thus lower flux limits for detectable host galaxies . for these stars",
    "the psfs were created in exactly the same way as for the agns .",
    "the object itself was always excluded in the psf production thus each test star and its psf were fully independent .",
    "this set of simulated ` naked quasars ' showed that in 88% ( 97% ) of all cases , any residuals  which could be taken as spurious ( g)host galaxy detections  had fluxes of less than 5% ( 10% ) of the total object flux . from this we adopted the condition that a real detection should show a residual flux after peak subtraction of at least 5% of the total flux , corresponding to a maximum nucleus - to - host ratio of 20 .",
    "because of the systematic oversubtraction inherent in the procedure corrections for the flux have to be applied ( see next section ) .    the final decision",
    "if a host galaxy is resolved is based on this criterion .",
    "in addition we visually inspected whether the detected flux indeed came from a host galaxy or whether other , unmasked structures were present , using the peak subtracted images and radial profile . if this could be ruled out we classified a host galaxy as detected .",
    "while the mere detection of an agn host galaxy can be achieved with comparably little effort , the determination of flux error bars and systematic offsets is much more complicated .",
    "we performed extensive simulations of artificial quasar images , composed from empirical psfs and host galaxy models plus artificial noise matching the actual flux and noise distribution in real images .",
    "these simulations are described in detail by @xcite .",
    "we applied the peak subtraction nucleus removal as well as galfit  to a set of @xmath82000 quasar images created in this way . comparing input and output parameter values yielded mean magnitude offsets as well as statistical errors for the individual host galaxy magnitudes ( fig .",
    "[ fig : corrs_and_errors_z ] ) .",
    "the simulations give reliability regions and error bars .",
    "the left panel in figure  [ fig : corrs_and_errors_z ] shows which magnitudes are recovered for a given synthetic host galaxy .",
    "since the input set covers a large range of different morphological configurations , scale lengths , nucleus - to - host ratios , etc . , the recovered values will scatter .",
    "close to the detection limit , the scatter and the corrections grow rapidly as a function of magnitude ; additionally , the ability to differentiate between different morphological types will generally be lost .",
    "the combination of these effects is reflected in the spread of the output of the simulations .",
    "this measured spread is a direct estimate for the uncertainties of the total flux ( right panel in figure  [ fig : corrs_and_errors_z ] ) .    from these simulations we adopt approximate regions in brightness where host galaxy magnitudes can be reliably determined , with correction of 0.25 to a maximum of 0.6  mag .",
    "these regions go down to @xmath61 , @xmath62 for the peak subtraction method and the present data . outside the corrections and errors increase . in three cases , marked in table  [ tab : results_vz ] with ` ? ' in column @xmath63 , the observed magnitudes extend to outside these regions ; here we continue using the derived corrections for these three objects , but the so derived host galaxies are more uncertain and their magnitudes should be taken with care .",
    "notice that the f850lp  band data are substantially shallower than the f606w  band , mainly a consequence of the acs detector sensitivity .",
    "using the above criteria for detecting a residual host galaxy , we find nine of the 23 host galaxies to be resolved in both bands , although some lie close to the sensitivity limit .",
    "one object formally fell above the 5% level in one band but not the other ; combo-17  33630 at @xmath64 might be marginally resolved in f850lp  and shows a structure at 1distance that might be a tidal arm or a foreground object . with this object lying at the highest redshift of the sample",
    "we do not consider this a clear detection .",
    "as mentioned , for three further cases in the f850lp  band the host galaxies are very faint ( marked with a ` ? ' in the @xmath63 column in tab .",
    "[ tab : results_vz ] ) . while their flux is above 5% of the total , their raw magnitudes fell 0.81.0  mag outside the reliability region where corrections and associated errors are still small . this low s / n is also reflected in the radial profiles ( see appendix  [ sec : appendix ] ) .",
    "as described above , tests with field stars show that 12% of all objects ( @xmath83 objects ) might show spurious ` host galaxies ' at the 5% flux level , and 3% ( 0 or 1 objects ) at the 10% flux level . in f606w  five of our objects fall with their host fluxes between these two values . in the f850lp - band",
    "these are four which include the three uncertain ones from above . according to statistics",
    "13 of these might be spurious detections .",
    "however , including or excluding these more uncertain data points in the following analysis does not have an influence on the conclusions drawn .    for each object",
    "the host galaxy flux was determined by simple aperture photometry after subtraction of the scaled psf , excluding resolved companion objects .",
    "the radius of the aperture was matched the used image size .",
    "all extracted magnitudes are collected in table  [ tab : results_vz ] , and shown together with the upper limit for the unresolved objects in the top panels of figure  [ fig : errorsimpeak ] .",
    "the extracted host galaxy images and radial surface brightness profiles are shown in fig .",

    ", we included a selection of 24 field stars , 12 each in the f606w- and f850lp - band ( figures  [ fig : stars_v ] and [ fig : stars_z ] ) , that were subjected to the same psf determination and peak subtraction as described in section  [ sec : detection ] .",
    "we plot the same profiles as for the agn .",
    "this selection is random apart from the fact that the 24 stars were observed on 24 different tiles . for most of the stars",
    "there is no systematic positive residual flux visible , as expected .",
    "the few that do show positive fluxes form the spurious detection statistic described above .",
    "while with deeper images or at lower redshift @xcite the morphological appearance of the host galaxies can be determined , this was generally not possible for the present data .",
    "apart from the extentions in combo-17  00784 , apparent residual structure visible in the colour images shown in the appendix is dominated by the psf subtraction procedure .",
    "this includes elongations and apparent off - centering that is due to limited centering precision of the order of 0.050.1 pixel ( see e.g.  combo-17  05696 from tile 2 ) .",
    "thus we adopted the host galaxy morphological class in all cases as ` undecided ' , and then applied the systematic corrections for oversubtraction provided by the simulations ( fig .",

    "this is the option we consider first .",
    "given the unknown dust absorption and metallicities in the host galaxies , a single uv colour is insufficient for performing a detailed age dating of starburst or a decomposition of stellar populations .",
    "however , we want to compare to the available theoretical colour range spanned by galaxy formation at @xmath91 and a very recent ( 100  myr ) starburst to illustrate how mixing of an old underlying population with most of the mass and a recent starburst influences the colour . in figure  [ fig : ssp_colours_ab ] the solid lines mark these extremes . in between these the dot - dashed lines",
    "show how contribution of a 100  myr component would influence the colour of an otherwise old population . from top to bottom 0.1% , 1% and 10% in mass are added to the old population .",

    "if we choose 100  myr as a timescale similar to the dynamical timescale in galaxies , the masses involved in that starburst would be of the order of a few percent of the total stellar mass .    for the assumption of only one single - aged population we can rule out a very high formation redshift ",
    "@xmath91 corresponds to ages of 3.52.5  gyr at @xmath96@xmath105 in the chosen cosmology . for the adopted set of models",
    ", the resulting age estimates would range mostly between @xmath80.1 and @xmath80.7  gyr .",
    "we note that the colour tracks in figure  [ fig : ssp_colours_ab ] are largely flat over the redshift range of interest , and that the two pure population and the different mixing ratios correspond to different colours almost independently of @xmath18 .",
    "since our measured colours are all quite similar , we conclude that the luminosity weighted ages of the the uv - dominating stellar population must be rather similar , unless younger ages and more reddening in some objects conspire .",
    "clearly , a single uv colour is insufficient to perform a reliable age dating , with all broad band colours being affected by various degeneracies with respect to dust and metallicities .",
    "however , we have reason to believe that at least the central lines of sight towards the agn are reasonably free of dust extinction ( because the agn sample is selected by optical / uv flux ) , and we therefore do not expect dust to play a major role . at any rate , significant dust extinction would make the host galaxies intrinsically bluer than what we observe . on the other hand ,",
    "assuming a metallicity lower than solar would shift all curves in figure  [ fig : ssp_colours_ab ] downward , resulting in older age estimates . reducing the metallicity to @xmath106 ( 1/5 solar )",
    "gives an single burst age increase by a factor of two ( for bruzual & charlot models ) .",
    "we conclude that if the uv light in our host galaxies is emitted by a passively evolving population of young stars , this population is typically much younger than a gyr .",
    "the diagram in figure  [ fig : nuchost ] shows that no correlation exists between the amount of stellar uv light from the host galaxies and the amounts of uv radiation produced by the nuclei .",
    "if the latter is taken as a measure of the amount of matter accreted by the nuclei then in the context of a recent starburst the size of the starburst and the amount of accreted matter must be governed by different mechanisms .",
    "if the accretion rate is primarily defined by the nuclear mass , and a correlation between galaxy and black hole mass is assumed , then the size of the starburst is independent of the bulk stellar mass of the host galaxy .",
    "other factors must be dominating the amount of ( gas ) mass involved in the starburst .",
    "this can be either the total amount of gas available in the galaxy , the size of the region involved in the starburst , the strength of an interaction responsible for the starburst , etc . in any case",
    "the amounts of gas involved are variable for a given nuclear luminosity . including the upper limits in figure  [ fig : nuchost ] the host luminosities span e.g.  @xmath84  mag at @xmath107 , i.e.  the amount of gas involved can vary by a factor of @xmath108 or more .",
    "we now interpret the detected uv emission in the alternative framework of being due to young stars forming continuously in the agn host galaxies . under this assumption",
    "it is possible to estimate the star formation rate ( sfr ) of the host galaxies from the measured rest frame uv luminosities .",
    "following @xcite and using the conversion of ab magnitudes into monochromatic fluxes we obtain @xmath109 where @xmath110 is the luminosity distance to the agn in cm , and @xmath111 is the observed uv magnitude at an arbitrary wavelength between 15002800 . with this formula we can now convert our f606w  band luminosities ( which are much deeper than the f850lpband data ) into star formation rates . as long as intrinsic dust attenuation",
    "is neglected , these values are of course mere lower limits .",
    "the resulting sfr values are listed in table  [ tab : colours ] and generally amount to a few solar masses per year , with remarkably little variation .",
    "the maximum value found is @xmath815  @xmath112 , and the mean is @xmath86  @xmath112 , including the results from the stacked image of individually unresolved host galaxies .",
    "this value is thus representative for the full sample of 23 agn .",
    "we show the distribution of star formation rates vs.  redshifts in figure  [ fig : sfr ] .",
    "no trend emerges , consistent with the previously established observations that neither colours nor luminosities show any significant trend with @xmath18 .",
    "this is again compared to the star formation rates for lbgs at @xmath113 from @xcite , as determined from the uv flux and uncorrected for dust .",
    "there are a few host galaxies with higher uv flux while for the majority it is smaller by a factor of 23 .",
    "however , there is a principal caveat in our guiding assumption of this subsection : the uv light from galaxies with strong ongoing star formation is expected to be totally dominated by the youngest stars .",
    "@xcite pointed out that the spectral shape of galaxies with a constant sfr over at least @xmath114  myr is basically flat ( in @xmath115 ) between 15002800 , assuming a @xcite imf .",
    "this would lead to an expected uv colour for our objects of @xmath116 or spectral index @xmath117 , more or less independently of redshift ( within the @xmath18 range of our sample ) , inconsistent with our observations for most objects ( see previous subsection , figure  [ fig : ssp_colours_ab ] and table  [ tab : colours ] ) .",
    "in other words , most detected host galaxies of our sample have uv colours that are too ` red ' for a simple continuous star formation scenario , while the stacked host galaxy is roughly consistent . if for the resolved hosts the f850lp  band fluxes were used instead of the f606w  band , sfr values would be higher by roughly a factor of 2 .",
    "this apparent inconsistency could be resolved in several ways .",
    "the initial assumption could be wrong , and the uv flux originates not from freshly formed stars , but from a passively evolved starburst as outlined in sect .",
    "[ sec : starburst ] .",
    "the star formation rate might not have been constant over the past , so that varying amounts of stars of different masses and ages would have been formed ; such a configuration is always possible , and our only argument against it would invoke occam s razor . finally , as discussed in the previous section , there could be an underlying older stellar population contributing more to f850lp  and less to f606w  ( but note that by sample design , also f850lp  is completely below the balmer jump at all relevant redshifts ) .",
    "this is the scenario that is favoured by our intermediate redshift data from gems  @xcite .",
    "clearly , in this study our current data set of just two uv bands is insufficient to settle this ambiguity .",
    "however , in all three cases there would be no continuous star formation as inferred for lbgs .",
    "the blue light would be a result not of a continuous process but of one or more events in the past of the host galaxy that triggered star formation . whether galaxy interaction or merger incidents were responsible or the formation of bars or spiral arms",
    "is involved can not be investigated with the present set of data .      even at low redshifts , colour data of agn host galaxies",
    "are relatively scant , except for rather low - luminosity agn where the host galaxy can be separated with relative ease . in those cases ,",
    "colours were generally found to be consistent with morphological types , in particular for the prevailing disk - type host galaxies @xcite . however",
    ", when higher nuclear luminosities are observed ( which generally correlate with a larger bulge component ) , then a tendency towards abnormally blue colours and younger stellar populations emerges @xcite .",
    "this tendency appears to hold also at intermediate redshifts , as demonstrated in our companion _",
    "paper @xcite , where we find more than half of the investigated host galaxies to have bluer colours than what would be expected from their morphological types .",
    "however , we can not confirm increasing amounts of blue light from young stars with increasing host luminosity as found by @xcite .",
    "our data are consistent with constant uv flux for all hosts .    at high redshifts ( @xmath11 ) ,",
    "colour information is available only for a handful of objects . in a ground - based study of six bright radio - loud quasars",
    ", @xcite found indications that the hosts were very blue , actively star - forming galaxies .",
    "for three high luminosity quasars , one radio - loud and two radio - quiet , @xcite claimed very luminous envelopes and star formation rates of several hundreds solar masses per year .",
    "more recently , @xcite presented optical _",
    "_  observations of three radio - loud and two radio - quiet quasars and found less extreme , but qualitatively similar results .    because of their high radio power and optical luminosities , many of the quasars observed in previous studies are probably quite different from the moderate - luminosity hosts of moderate - luminosity radio - quiet agn that we focus on .",
    "it is nevertheless interesting to see that the presence of a significantly enhanced uv continuum and young stars seems to be at least qualitatively similar between qsos of intermediate and high luminosities .",
    "we performed the hitherto largest study of host galaxies properties of a complete sample of high - redshift agn .",
    "we detected the hosts and extract colour information in 9 of the 23 agn , and we also achieved a statistical detection of the host in the remaining 14 from a stack analysis .",
    "the uv luminosities can be interpreted in three ways : either as contribution from a passively evolving population of relatively young stars , forming typically 0.5  gyrs ago , as a mix between a population of old ( e.g.  @xmath104 ) stars and a small contribution of a recently formed young population ( e.g.0.1%10% in mass at an age of 100  myrs or 1/10th of this for age 10  myrs ) , or as an indicator of ongoing star formation at a level of @xmath8215@xmath118 ( uncorrected for internal dust attenuation ) .",
    "while the first possibility is very simplistic and appears unphysical , the uv colours actually favour the two burst interpretations ; but the possibility of on - going star formation can not be completely ruled out from our data .    in the framework of combined old and young populations ,",
    "it is remarkable how similar the host galaxy colours are within the sample , and , unless different mass  age combinations conspire , hence the estimated stellar mass fractions and ages .",
    "the derived young population mass fractions and ages are also very similar to the values estimated in our companion gems  study of agn at @xmath119 @xcite , where we find abnormally blue rest - frame @xmath120 colours for a substantial fraction of host galaxies , particularly the most luminous agn in the sample .",
    "even more , these colours and ages are in turn very close to the mean values obtained from our ground - based low-@xmath18 multicolour sample @xcite . while the stellar population diagnostics of @xcite are not immediately convertible into our simple colour indicators , their impressive and highly significant results point in exactly the same direction .    while the results from all these redshift regimes are similar and point to a connection of nuclear activity and the presence of young stars , and that mass fractions of young stars are similar",
    ", we always find that a larger range of absolute masses is involved , showing as a range in uv luminosity . here",
    "we find a variation of a factor of @xmath12140 for a given nuclear luminosity .",
    "our host galaxy colours span a range that reaches the colours of lyman break galaxies for a few very luminous hosts , while , as mentioned , the colours of the majority are somewhat redder than these",
    ". a comparison of optical / uv properties to the general population of high redshift galaxies would be very illuminating , but large statistical samples only become available in the near future , e.g.  from the goodsproject .",
    "this persistent trend to find agn to be associated with blue stellar colours is intriguing and suggests a close connection between enhanced star formation and nuclear activity .",
    "additional support for such a connection comes from the detection of submm co emission in a number of extremely luminous high - redshift qsos and radio galaxies @xcite , although the current sensitivity of submm telescopes is insufficient to perform this test for less luminous agn at high @xmath18 .",
    "while the fact that there is a relation can hardly be denied , its physical origin remains obscure .",
    "is the enhancement of star formation a prerequisite for nuclear activity ?",
    "is it a simultaneously occurring phenomenon , caused by the same trigger ? or is it a consequence of the agn ?",
    "galaxy merging and interaction are clearly two possible candidates to connect these two phenomena , but neither the only ones nor are the involved physics understood .",

    "<S> we have performed _ hst _  imaging of a sample of 23 high - redshift ( @xmath0 ) active galactic nuclei , drawn from the combo-17survey . </S>",
    "<S> the sample contains moderately luminous quasars ( @xmath1 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the data are part of the gems  imaging survey that provides high resolution optical images obtained with the advanced camera for surveys in two bands ( f606w  and f850lp ) , sampling the rest - frame uv flux of the targets . to deblend the agn images into nuclear and resolved ( host galaxy ) components we use a psf subtraction technique that is strictly conservative with respect to the flux of the host galaxy . </S>",
    "<S> we resolve the host galaxies in both filter bands in 9 of the 23 agn , whereas the remaining 14 objects are considered non - detections , with upper limits of less than 5  % of the nuclear flux . </S>",
    "<S> however , when we coadd the unresolved agn images into a single high signal - to - noise composite image we find again an unambiguously resolved host galaxy . </S>",
    "<S> the recovered host galaxies have apparent magnitudes of @xmath2 and @xmath3 with rest - frame uv colours in the range @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> the rest - frame absolute magnitudes at 200  nm are @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> the photometric properties of the composite host are consistent with the individual resolved host galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the uv colors of all host galaxies are substantially bluer than expected from an old population of stars with formation redshift @xmath6 , independent of the assumed metallicities . </S>",
    "<S> these uv colours and luminosities range up to the values found for lyman - break galaxies ( lbgs ) at @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> our results suggest either a recent starburst , of e.g.  a few per cent of the total stellar mass and 100  myrs before observation , with mass - fraction and age strongly degenerate , or the possibility that the detected uv emission may be due to young stars forming continuously . for the latter case we estimate star formation rates of typically @xmath8@xmath9 ( uncorrected for internal dust attenuation ) , which again lies in the range of rates implied from the uv flux of lbgs . </S>",
    "<S> our results agree with the recent discovery of enhanced blue stellar light in agn hosts at lower redshifts . </S>"
