    "individuals of ecological communities permanently face the choice of either cooperating with each other , or of cheating  @xcite .",
    "while cooperation is beneficial for the whole population and essential for its functioning , it often requires an investment by each agent .",
    "cheating is then tempting , yielding social dilemmas where defection is the rational choice that would yet undermine the community and could even lead to ultimate self - destruction .",
    "however , bacteria or animals do not act rationally ; instead , the fate of their populations is governed by an evolutionary process , through reproduction and death .",
    "the conditions under which cooperation can thereby evolve are subject of much contemporary , interdisciplinary research  @xcite .",
    "evolutionary processes possess two main competing aspects .",
    "the first one is selection by individuals different fitness , which underlies adaptation  @xcite and is , by neo - darwinists , viewed as the primary driving force of evolutionary change . in social dilemmas , defectors exploit cooperators rewarding them a higher fitness ; selection therefore leads to fast extinction of cooperation , such that the fate of the community mimics the rational one . a large body of work is currently devoted to the identification of mechanisms that can reinforce cooperative behavior  @xcite , _",
    "e.g. _ kin selection  @xcite , reciprocal altruism  @xcite , or punishment  @xcite .",
    "however , the evolution of cooperation in darwinian settings still poses major challenges .",
    "the second important aspect of evolution are random fluctuations that occur from the unavoidable stochasticity of birth and death events and the finiteness of populations .",
    "neutral theories emphasize their influence which can , ignoring selection , explain many empirical signatures of ecological systems such as species - abundance relations as well as species - area relationships  @xcite .",
    "the importance of neutral evolution for the maintenance of cooperation has so far found surprisingly little attention  @xcite .    in this article",
    ", we introduce a general concept capable to investigate the effects of selection versus fluctuations by analyzing extinction events .",
    "we focus on social dilemmas , i.e. , we study the effects of darwinian versus neutral evolution on cooperation . for this purpose ,",
    "we consider a population that initially displays coexistence of cooperators and defectors , i.e. , cooperating and non - cooperating individuals .",
    "after some transient time , one of both ` species ' will disappear  @xcite , simply due to directed and stochastic effects in evolution and because extinction is irreversible : an extinct species can not reappear again .",
    "the fundamental questions regarding cooperation are therefore : will cooperators eventually take over the whole population , and if not , for how long can a certain level of cooperation be maintained ?",
    "we show that the answers to these questions depend on the influence of stochasticity . for large fluctuations , evolution is effectively neutral , and cooperation maintained on a long time - scale , if not ultimately prevailing .",
    "in contrast , small stochastic effects render selection important , and cooperators die out quickly if disfavored .",
    "we demonstrate the emergence of an ` edge of neutral evolution ' delineating both regimes .",
    "* different types of social dilemmas*. we consider a population of cooperators and defectors , and describe their interactions in terms of four parameters @xmath0 and @xmath1 , see text . depending on the payoff - differences @xmath2 and @xmath3 , four qualitatively different scenarios arise .

    "we assume that individuals randomly engage in pairwise interactions , whereby cooperators and defectors behave distinctly different and thereby gain different fitness .",

    "we present the different possible fitness gains of cooperators and defectors .    in the _ prisoner s dilemma _",
    "a cooperator provides a benefit @xmath7 to another individual , at a cost @xmath8 to itself ( with the cost falling short of the benefit ) .",
    "in contrast , a defector refuses to provide any benefit and hence does not pay any costs . for the selfish individual ,",
    "irrespective of whether the partner cooperates or defects , defection is favorable , as it avoids the cost of cooperation , exploits cooperators , and ensures not to become exploited .",
    "however , if all individuals act rationally and defect , everybody is , with a gain of @xmath9 , worse off compared to universal cooperation , where a net gain of @xmath10 would be achieved .",
    "the prisoner s dilemma therefore describes , in its most basic form , the fundamental problem of establishing cooperation .    we can generalize the above scheme to include other basic types of social dilemmas  @xcite .",
    "namely , two cooperators that meet are both rewarded a payoff @xmath11 , while two defectors obtain a punishment @xmath1 .",
    "when a defector encounters a cooperator , the first exploits the second , gaining the temptation @xmath12 , while the cooperator only gets the suckers payoff @xmath13 .",

    "therefore , cooperation is favorable when meeting a defector , but defection pays off when encountering a cooperator , and a rational strategy consists of a mixture of cooperation and defection .",
    "another scenario is the _ coordination game _ , where mutual agreement is preferred : either all individuals cooperate or defect as the reward @xmath22 is higher than the temptation @xmath12 and the punishment @xmath1 is higher than sucker s payoff @xmath13 .",

    "selection , as a result of some interactions within a finite population , can either stabilize or destabilize a species coexistence with others as compared to neutral interactions , thereby altering the mean time until extinction occurs .",

    "there , either defectors or cooperators eventually survive , and the mean extinction time of the other strategy is small , and obeys a logarithmic law @xmath116 . we have encountered this regime already in the particular case of the prisoner s dilemma specified by @xmath158 .",
    "these two darwinian regimes are separated by two regimes of neutral evolution , shown in grey in fig .",
    "[ fig : c ]",
    ". first , for small @xmath4 and small differences in the payoffs ( i.e. , around the point where the four types of games coincide ) a @xmath113 behavior emerges .",

    "mutualism , the mean extinction time increases as a square - root in the population size , @xmath114 .    similar to the prisoner s dilemma , we now aim at identifying the edge of neutral evolution , i.e. , the crossover from the darwinian regimes to the regimes of neutral evolution .",
    "we have calculated the boundaries of both neutral regimes , @xmath113 and @xmath159 analytically , see methods section  [ methods_edges ] .",
    "they are described by straight lines for the first one and by parabola - shaped lines for the second one , see fig .",
    "[ fig : c ] .    both edges of neutral evolution scale proportional to the system size @xmath4 .",
    "therefore , while increasing the system size changes the payoff parameters where the crossovers appear , the shape and relations of the different regimes are not altered . concerning the dependence of the edges of neutral evolution on the characteristic strength of selection @xmath160 , meaning the average contribution of the fitness - dependent payoff to the overall fitness , different scaling laws arise .",
    "for the crossover from the neutral regime @xmath113 to the other regimes , @xmath140 and @xmath141 scale as @xmath161 .",
    "in contrast , a scaling law @xmath162 for crossovers between the neutral regime with @xmath130 and the darwinian regimes emerges .",
    "this different scaling behavior arises , for example , for @xmath155 and varying @xmath163 as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : d ] b.",
    "cooperation is often threatened by exploitation and therefore , although beneficial , vulnerable to extinction . in evolutionary dynamics , this mechanism comes in through selection by individuals fitness , the driving force of darwinian evolution .",
    "however , evolution also possesses stochastic aspects . employing a standard formulation of social dilemmas",
    ", we have shown that fluctuations can support cooperation in two distinct ways .",
    "first , they can lead cooperators to fully take over the population .",
    "second , neutral evolution considerably increases the time at which cooperators and defectors coexist , i.e. , at which a certain level of cooperation is maintained . to emphasize the importance of the second point , we note that in real ecological systems the rules of the dynamics themselves change due to external  @xcite or internal  @xcite influences , setting an upper limit to the time - scales at which evolution with constant payoffs , as we study here , applies",
    ". in particular , these times can be shorter than the times that would be needed for extinction of either cooperators or defectors , such that it may be less important to look at which of both would ultimately remain , but what the time - scales for extinction are .",
    "quantitatively , we have shown the emergence of different darwinian and neutral regimes . in the darwinian regime of the prisoner",
    "s dilemma , cooperators are guaranteed to become extinct ; the same is true for the second neutral regime , where @xmath114 .",
    "however , in the other neutral regime , with @xmath113 , a random process determines whether cooperators or defectors prevail .",
    "cooperators may therefore take over due to essentially neutral evolution .",
    "moreover , even if cooperators eventually disappear , they remain for a considerably longer time in the neutral regimes than in the darwinian regime .",
    "indeed , in the regimes of neutral evolution , coexistence of cooperators and defectors is maintained for a mean time @xmath32 obeying @xmath113 resp .",
    "@xmath114 . for medium and large population sizes , this time exceeds by far the time @xmath45 at",
    "which cooperation disappears in the darwinian regimes of the prisoner s dilemma or of the coordination game ( if defectors happen to dominate in the latter case ) .",
    "neutral evolution can therefore maintain cooperation on a much longer time - scale than darwinian evolution .",
    "this effect is relevant as the neutral regimes considerably extend into the prisoner s dilemma as well as the cooperation game region .",
    "there , a form of neutrally maintained cooperation evolves .",
    "our results have been obtained by applying a general concept based on extinction times that allows to classify evolutionary dynamics into regimes of darwinian and neutral character , separated by an emerging edge of neutral evolution .",
    "apart from the social dilemmas under consideration here , we believe that our quantitative analytical approach can be versatilely applied to disentangle the effects of selection and fluctuations in various ecological situations where different species coexist  @xcite .",
