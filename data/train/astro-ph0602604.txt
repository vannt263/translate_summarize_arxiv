    "one of the fundamental tenets of the cold dark matter ( cdm ) paradigm @xcite is that dark matter halos form hierarchically , via a series of mergers with smaller halos .",
    "this prediction gives rise to the natural expectation that the stellar halo is formed from disrupted , accreted dwarf galaxies @xcite .",
    "cdm models predict that stellar halos form early , with the majority of the stars in the halo formed within a few relatively massive , @xmath7m@xmath8 , dwarf irregular ( dirr ) -size dark matter halos .",
    "these were accreted @xmath310 gyr in the past , likely prior to the formation of the bulge component via gaseous collapse , mergers and starbursts .",
    "such models predict that the halo should be metal - poor and relatively smooth within the inner 50 kpc , where the tidal signatures of early stellar streams have been erased @xcite .",
    "the giant stellar streams in the milky way @xcite and andromeda @xcite testify to the longevity of minor accretions which occurred since the metal poor halo formed .",
    "the average stellar halo density profile is expected to fall off with radius more quickly than that of the dark matter because the stellar halo is formed from the most tightly bound material in infalling systems , while the majority of the accreted dark matter is stripped and deposited at larger radii .",
    "the discovery of fossil evidence of these accretion events via the identification of substructure within nearby stellar halos may provide the only direct evidence that structure formation is hierarchical on small - scales @xcite .",
    "one of the most promising systems for the detailed decomposition and study of the stellar halo and its relation to the dark matter halo is the andromeda galaxy , or m31 , @xcite .",
    "often considered the milky way s twin , this galaxy , at a distance of @xmath3785  kpc , @xcite , lies sufficiently close that modern instrumentation can be used to measure spectra of individual stars in the top few magnitudes of the red giant branch ( rgb ) , providing access to their radial velocities and metallicities . in this paper",
    "we probe the outer stellar component of m31 using radial velocities and calcium ii triplet ( cat ) metallicities of rgb stars to study the overall kinematic characteristics .",
    "since 2002 we have undertaken a spectroscopic survey of rgb stars ( selected by their optical colors and magnitudes ) in m31 with the 10 m w.  m.  keck  ii telescope and the deimos spectrograph @xcite .",
    "the 54 spectroscopic fields shown in figure  1 comprise 9861 stars with measured radial velocities ( shown in figure  2 ) , and represent our ongoing program to provide a complete kinematic and metallicity characterization of the disk and halo of m31 , as well as the accreted fragments that now litter this environment .",
    "details of the spectroscopic observations and the selection of m31 rgb stars from the color - magnitude diagram ( cmd ) have been presented in previous papers ( @xcite  i05 ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . briefly , we used the standard deimos multi - slit mode for low density outer fields , but adopted our own _ mini - slitlets _ approach targeting @xmath9 stars per mask in higher density inner fields using small ( 1.5  long ) slits , with data reduction using our own custom software pipeline ( i05 ) .",
    "stars are selected for masks based on the position of the red giant branch ( rgb ) in the color - magnitude diagram , with a limit of @xmath10 for useful spectra . for most fields , except where a structure like and - ix @xcite or the @xcite fuzzy clusters were targeted",
    ", stars were given equal priority from the rgb tip to @xmath11=21.25 , then lower weight for fainter objects .",
    "the s / n degrades to about 5 at the limit of useful data .",
    "a summary of all fields observed with deimos , the radial velocity yields , and the breakdown of stars by kinematics into halo , disk , and galactic windows , is presented in table  1 .",
    "representative individual spectra are shown in figure  [ repspec ] , as a function of both rgb color and @xmath11-mag .",
    "radial velocities measured from the calcium ii triplet ( cat ) can be used to kinematically isolate a likely sample of m31 halo stars . however , extracting a representative sample of m31 halo stars is hampered by the fact that many of the spectroscopic pointings have directly targeted the obvious photometric overdensities identified in @xcite .",
    "fortunately , our discovery ( i05 ) that an extended rotating component dominates the star counts in all these photometric substructures ( with the exception of the giant tidal stream to the south - east ",
    "@xcite ) , suggests a method to procure a sample of stars which is unbiased with respect to the photometric overdensities . a candidate _ halo _",
    "component of stars can be extracted by windowing out in heliocentric velocity all stars which rotate with this extended component ( shown in figure  2 ) . in other words ,",
    "the photometric representation of our windowed sample should be spatially smooth to first order ( see i05 for further discussion of this point ) .",
    "we construct windows for the extended rotating component by adopting the average fit to the extended rotating component , @xmath12km / s gaussian , from the kinematic model presented in i05 , and considering the window to span @xmath13 ( or @xmath14100km / s in the _ disk - lag _ frame).50km / s ) in the coadded disk fields .",
    "this is partly a problem of the projection effects and the simplicity of the kinematic model currently adopted .",
    "] this is considered to be our `` disk '' sample , those stars exhibiting thin - disk - like kinematics . between disk - lag velocities of @xmath15",
    "we define an additional component of intermediate kinematics , which we term `` thick disk '' in the subsequent discussion ( to be discussed in detail in a subsequent paper ) . as the peak of the velocity distribution of the disk",
    "is observed to shift slightly between fields ( typically by @xmath16 to @xmath17 ) compared to the simple disk model of i05 , the selection windows are adjusted accordingly by a small amount ( hence the limits of the `` disk '' and `` thick disk '' selections in figure  2 are slightly ragged ) .",
    "the disk - like population is revealed in figure  [ histos ] as a gaussian with disk - lag velocity of zero .",
    "some skew in the distribution arises from the truncation in the north - east region of m31 imposed in order to reject contaminating stars from the milky way .",
    "this also affects the v@xmath18 visualization of the disk in figure  [ histos ] , giving rise to a much larger -470km / s disk peak ( whereas the disk is actually sampled with roughly even numbers from our spectroscopy ) .",
    "the minor axis fields require an additional windowing criterion .",
    "for inner fields where the rotating components dominate , we have windowed out the `` disk '' component as it passes over v@xmath18=-300km / s ( even though this removes any possible halo sample as well  clearly this is unavoidable ) . for outer fields where the halo dominates ,",
    "we do not window at all .",
    "the first such field is f5 at 20kpc on the se minor axis ( figure  1 ) , and all fields beyond that were considered to be `` pure halo '' .",
    "we do not explicitly distinguish a bulge component in this study , as it does not obviously distinguish itself in our predominantly major axis fields .",
    "we note that a relatively metal - rich _ bulge - like _ component is reported at minor axis radii from 12 - 20kpc by @xcite , consistent with other photometric studies of rgb stars at these radii ( durrell , harris , & pritchet 1994 , 2001 ; mould & kristian 1986 ; brown et al .",
    "2003 ; bellazzini et al .",
    "2003 ; worthey et al .",
    "2005 ) . however , this is tangential to the present study .",
    "very few of our fields lie within this radial range , and even fewer are used for measuring the halo spectroscopic metallicity ( see  4 and fig .",
    "9 which shows the fields where the numbers and quality of the spectra are sufficient for obtaining a halo metallicity measurement ) . as discussed above , our first minor axis field suitable for direct comparison with the @xcite bulge is f5 at 20kpc .",
    "this field has a halo sample metallicity of [ fe / h ] = -1.18 ( to be presented in fig.9 ) , and is consistent with the findings of @xcite within errors of their bridging halo / bulge fields . to ensure that this result is not biased by galactic dwarf star contamination",
    ", we have tested the field f5 with velocity cuts at both -300km / s and -170km / s , the resulting measurements are [ fe / h ] = -1.23 ( @xmath19kms ) and [ fe / h ] = -1.18 ( @xmath20kms ) .",
    "this is in the opposite sense from that expected if dwarf contaminants were significant ( see below ) .",
    "our current inability to clearly distinguish a possible bulge component in the inner - most regions of m31 may bias our measurements to slightly higher metallicity , although there is no statistically significant evidence that this is the case .",
    "the galactic foreground ( discussed below ) and the giant southern stream are the last _ contaminants _ to window from our stellar halo sample .",
    "the giant southern stream has kinematics which stand out as a high negative velocity peak in figure  2 @xcite .",
    "it appears in only seven of the fields , although another eight fields in the north - east region show a coherent kinematic structure which is similarly metal - rich to the giant southern stream , suggesting that this region represents a dominant component of the stream s _ return _ on the other side of m31 @xcite .",
    "nonetheless , the total number of stars in the giant stream is still relatively small , leaving the extended rotating component windows having the most significant effect on the halo sample .",
    "the sample selection in the disk - lag and heliocentric frames is shown in figure  [ vels ] ( where the black dots mark the halo stars of interest to this study ) and figure  [ histos ] where the total distributions are shown .",
    "figure  [ histos ] reveals the stellar halo windowed sample as a broad gaussian distribution centered on v@xmath21 - 300km / s , along with the rotating thin and thick disk - like populations together as a single sample .",
    "also shown in figure  [ histos ] are representative velocity histograms in nine individual fields spread throughout m31 .",
    "the double - peaked disk / galaxy components seen in the top three panels ( from the n - e region of m31 ",
    "f30 , f10 , f8 ) demonstrate that our v@xmath22km / s galactic windowing is indeed very conservative , yet necessary to obtain an uncontaminated stellar halo sample .",
    "after all windowing procedures , 1207 stars remain in our halo sample .",
    "we then refine this sample to 827 stars by applying the following quality criteria ( the same criteria as in i05 ) : _",
    "( i ) _ the velocity of stars derived from two different sky - subtraction algorithms has to agree within 20km / s : removes 35 stars _",
    "( ii ) _ stars with continuum @xmath23 counts ( or about 40e- total / pix ) : removes 38 stars _",
    "( iii ) _ stars with @xmath24km / s : removes 138 stars _",
    "( iv ) _ stars with cross - correlation peak @xmath25 : removes 189 stars .",
    "this sample can be considered to _ underlie _ the extended rotating structure of ( i05 ) .      to complete our halo sampling ,",
    "we must remove the foreground galactic component ( mostly dwarf stars ) , observed as a strong gaussian peak centered on -61 km / s ( i05 ) .",
    "the galactic window is stationary ( defined here as stars with @xmath26 ) , except for fields within the dense disk of m31 on the north - eastern major axis where we chose to remove only those stars with @xmath27 as the source density is so high that galactic contaminants are rare .",
    "any galactic contamination near the m31 systemic velocity ( @xmath28 ) has to be galactic halo , and the corresponding density of dwarf stars is minimal .",
    "the besancon galactic starcounts model @xcite estimates 10 galactic stars per m31 deimos field of view ( @xmath29 ) with @xmath30 ) if all available candidates were observed . for @xmath31",
    "the besanon model indicates the number of galactic stars per deimos field to be only 1.8 stars ( typically @xmath321% ) .",
    "the besanon prediction at velocities @xmath2 -300 km / s is particularly relevant since more than 50% of our halo sample is cut at v@xmath33 - 300km / s . in practice ,",
    "we have typically observed @xmath250% of the stars which are consistent with m31 rgb colors available in the region covered by a deimos mask . given our choice of thousands of targets per field inside the inner ellipse in figure  1 ( and a maximum multiplexing of @xmath34 stars per deimos mask with our _ mega - holes _ approach ",
    "see i05 for further discussion ) , we estimate a negligible galactic contamination out to @xmath330kpc , and at most 10% contamination in our fields at larger radius .",
    "we also refer to the work of @xcite which uses a multi - dimensional rejection of galactic dwarfs based on a variety of spectral features ( most of which are unavailable to us , given the small extracted wavelength regime from our custom data reduction ) .",
    "@xcite are therefore able to calibrate the use of kinematic selection alone as a means to reject galactic dwarfs , finding that @xmath21% of stars cut at v@xmath35km / s will be dwarfs , in agreement with the besanon model",
    ". therefore our cmd selection of rgb stars coupled with kinematic sorting of the candidate m31 stars by radial velocity is likely to remove the vast majority of galactic contaminants .",
    "the windowing of stellar halo sample provides another check on galactic contamination .",
    "our north - eastern stellar halo represents a more ` galactic dwarf free ' sample as it is cut in velocity below -300km / s , whereas the south - western stellar halo is cut typically from -160km / s@xmath36 - 300km / s .",
    "as we might expect based on the @xcite work , we find almost no differences between our north - east and south - west hemisphere results , neither in kinematics (  3 ) nor in metallicity (  4 ) , and thus it is clear that galactic dwarfs are not significantly affecting our stellar halo results .",
    "a further reality check that our spectroscopically identified stars are truly m31 rgb stars comes from the nai@xmath37 which is sensitive to surface gravity , and is accordingly undetectable in m31 rgb stars , but is as strong as the cat absorption lines in galactic dwarfs with relatively red colors ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "we can check for this on a field by field basis in combined spectra of stars , and where our spectroscopic approach resulted in wavelength coverage to @xmath38   ( the @xmath330% of fields where we employed the standard deimos multi - slit masks ) .",
    "our stacked spectra in all m31 components ( extended disk , thick disk , halo , and giant stream ) show very little evidence for nai@xmath37 absorption lines , whereas stars drawn randomly from -100 to zero velocity show strong nai absorption on average ( figure  [ galcontam ] ) .",
    "direct measurement of the nai equivalent widths in the halo and galactic windows shows the contamination fraction is less than 15% , although this is of course a severe upper limit since there are large numbers of true m31 rgbs in the `` galactic '' window @xcite diluting the nai absorption , and weak nai is also observed in rgbs .. this further corroborates the very low galactic contamination in our m31 kinematically - selected samples .",
    "to provide an overall kinematic characterization of the m31 halo stars , we first fitted a simple model with an isotropic velocity dispersion that is independent of radius , but that is allowed to rotate as a solid body about the centre of the galaxy , which is assumed to have a systemic heliocentric velocity of @xmath39 , and with the same axis of rotation as the disk . for this first fit , we manually removed 3 fields from the sample , due to the obvious presence of a kinematic halo substructure .",
    "these three contiguous fields lie on the north - eastern major axis at the edge of the inner ellipse shown in figure  1 , and the kinematic substructure is clearly visible on figures  2 & [ histos ] with heliocentric velocity in the range @xmath40 ( this detection is is discussed further in @xcite ) .",
    "the model was fit simultaneously to the halo stars in all of the remaining 51 spectroscopic field using a windowed maximum likelihood approach .",
    "the resulting distribution of likelihood as a function of the model dispersion and angular speed is shown in figure  [ halofit1 ] .",
    "the best model parameters given this data are a halo velocity dispersion of @xmath41 , and an angular velocity of @xmath42 .",
    "however , the data are also consistent , at the @xmath43 confidence level , with no rotation .",
    "[ halofit1 ]    indeed , the halo shows no significant signs of rotation in any orientation . by dividing the spectroscopic fields into two sub - samples using a line intersecting the center of m31",
    ", we find the largest velocity differential as a function of azimuthal angle occurs near the major axis where the ne half shows v@xmath44km",
    "/ s from a best fit gaussian to the average sample , while the sw half has v@xmath45km / s .",
    "this insignificant _ rotation _ is in the same sense as the extended rotating component @xcite , and could for instance be a result of residual extended rotating component stars contaminating our halo sample . for simplicity we therefore neglect rotation in the following , slightly more complex models .",
    "[ halofit2 ]    in figure  [ halofit2 ] we show the result of fitting a model in which the velocity dispersion is allowed to vary linearly with projected radius @xmath46 .",
    "the systemic velocity was again fixed at @xmath47 for stability due to a complex windowing function .",
    "we proceeded by first calculating the velocity dispersions in individual fields , given the adopted window function , and assuming that the dispersion is constant and gaussian at the position of the field .",
    "the resulting maximum - likelihood calculated values are shown in the upper panel of figure  [ halofit2 ] . a single model with a linear dependence of velocity dispersion with radius was then fit to the full dataset .",
    "the measurements for individual fields are _ not _ used in the analysis , presented only to clarify what the maximum - likelihood algorithm is latching onto .",
    "proceeding in an iterative manner , we rejected those fields where the likelihood of the velocity dispersion conforming to the linear fit was less than 1% , and re - computed the fit .",
    "the likelihood contours of this model are shown in the lower panel of figure  [ halofit2 ] ; the most likely model has @xmath48 at a distance of 10kpc , the inferred velocity dispersion of the halo is therefore @xmath49 , while at a distance of 60kpc the inferred velocity dispersion has changed to @xmath50 .",
    "these results stand in contrast to the essentially isothermal halo measured for the inner galaxy @xcite ; for m31 , an isothermal model can be rejected at the @xmath51 level .",
    "the individual field - by - field fits reveal that the overall fit when we allow for a gradient in the dispersion is obviously dominated by the stars inside @xmath52 .",
    "while stars likely belonging to the giant stream have been removed from the halo sample , several _ stream _ fields stand out very clearly as not belonging to the trend by having a very low velocity dispersion , as do fields in the _ ne shelf _ region ( described in @xcite which also shows stars with giant stream kinematic structure ) .",
    "the fact that these fields still stand out from an otherwise well - behaved trend suggests that our windowing of the giant stream is not extensive enough .",
    "however , at the present time we lack a full understanding of the distribution of the stream debris over the face of m31 , forcing us to adopt this pragmatic approach .    the above two models are essentially just phenomenological descriptions of the data , so in the following we attempt a more physically - motivated model .",
    "modern cosmology finds that the dark matter halos of galaxies have a universal shape ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter nfw ) .",
    "simulations show that halo stars are the remnants of ancient accreted proto - galaxies , but ones that were relatively massive .",
    "as such the stars deposited by these accretions are biassed towards being closer to the centre of the halo , and consequently the halo is less extensive than the dark matter halo @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the halo stars provide a reasonable first approximation to the dark matter , and we will therefore attempt to fit the population with an nfw model .",
    "this comparison is further motivated by the finding that the velocity dispersion of the halo sample decreases with radius , which is expected from the nfw model .",
    "the nfw model is fully described by concentration and virial mass parameters .",
    "though the concentration is on average dependent on the virial mass @xcite , there is a large scatter in this relation , and it is therefore safer to consider the full parameter space .",
    "we integrated the nfw model numerically , using the relations described in @xcite , to obtain the projected line of sight velocity dispersion for each field in our survey , under the assumption that the velocity dispersion is isotropic .",
    "note that the relative densities between fields were purposefully not specified , due to the fact our survey does not provide a complete census of stars in each field .",
    "we further adopted @xmath53 and a virial overdensity parameter of 200 .",
    "figure  [ halofit3 ] shows the resulting likelihood contours ( after rejection of the low - dispersion fields marked red in the upper panel of figure  [ halofit2 ] ) .",
    "although the most likely model parameters are m@xmath54 and @xmath55 , the likelihood contours are very extended in the concentration direction .",
    "the main reason for this is that our maximum - likelihood analysis method , as mentioned before , does not have access to the information on the field - to - field density variations , whereas the concentration by its very nature relates to the radial variation in density .",
    "what density sensitivity we do have is due to the integration along the line of sight in each field .",
    "cosmological simulations indicate that concentration values of @xmath56 are very unlikely for the dark halos of galaxies such as m31 @xcite ; this limit is shown by a dashed line in figure  [ halofit3 ] . imposing",
    "this additional constraint implies that the virial mass of the m31 halo must exceed m@xmath57 with 99% confidence .",
    "this value for the halo mass agrees remarkably well with the value calculated from the kinematics of the giant stream around m31 @xcite , where we found a mass interior to @xmath58 ( the apocenter of the stream ) of @xmath59 .",
    "in contrast , the present constraint translates to @xmath60 .",
    "[ halofit3 ]",
    "the photometrically dominant extended rotating component appeared to have a relatively high metallicity , [ fe / h]=-0.9 @xmath1=0.2 dex ( i05 ) , consistent with our larger sample of disk stars reported here , [ fe / h]=-1.0 @xmath1=0.3 dex ( where the error bars represent field to field dispersion in the measurements ) , explaining why so many disk - like stars have been found at large radius @xcite . while attempts to model a more metal - rich halo have had some degree of success under specialized evolutionary conditions @xcite , our cdm understanding of how the halo of a typical l@xmath61 spiral galaxy forms suggest there must be a metal - poor relic of the early halo .",
    "but is there perhaps a metal - poor halo lurking underneath the relatively metal-_rich _ rotating component ?",
    "our first goal is to assess the metallicity of our velocity - windowed sample of stars , to see if it shows properties distinct from the prominent extended rotating component which vastly outnumbers the halo ( on average by a factor @xmath62 ) at radii @xmath63kpc @xcite .",
    "the deimos spectra allow a measurement of the metallicity of the targeted stars from the equivalent widths ( ew ) of the ca  ii triplet absorption lines , free from the model - dependency of photometric analysis . while the noise in individual spectra is typically too high to yield a useful measurement of the ca  ii equivalent widths ( whereby individual spectra can have vastly different systematic errors due to the inopportune location of sky lines for certain heliocentric velocities ) , we estimate the average metallicity by stacking the rgb star spectra in individual fields .",
    "we shift each spectrum to zero velocity before stacking , normalizing the continuum to one using the inter - cat continuum regions to fit a spline function , and finally weighting individual spectra by the continuum s / n ( figures  [ metalfields ] & [ metalstack ] ) .",
    "metallicities were measured in an identical way to i05 , using the correlation of the caii equivalent width with [ fe / h ] as calibrated by @xcite .    for comparison , we derived photometric [ fe / h ] values for the halo stars by interpolating between globular cluster fiducial sequences described in i05 .",
    "the photometric properties of these metal - poor halo rgbs are entirely consistent with the spectroscopic properties , as shown in figure  [ specphot ] ( we defer the model / age - dependent analyses of the stellar photometry to a followup paper ) .",
    "the largest variations occur in the n - e fields where the metal - rich giant stream structure is present at the halo window velocities ( v@xmath35km / s ) , which appear to be more metal - rich in the spectroscopic measurements .",
    "this may be indicative of the different ages / properties of the giant stream stars from the stellar halo .",

    ". there are five halo fields in the north - east which appear significantly more metal - rich than average and are not typical for the halo sample .",
    "these five fields all possess a kinematically coherent sub - structure at v@xmath66km / s and with [ fe / h]@xmath3 - 0.7 which contaminates the halo - selected sample to various degrees . including these sub - structure stars in the halo sample",
    "only marginally changes the result ( [ fe / h]=-1.36  @xmath67 with , versus [ fe / h]=-1.40  @xmath68 without ) .",
    "this sub - structure is likely to be associated with the giant southern stream @xcite . aside from these _ giant stream _ fields in the north - east , the metallicity measurements in each halo field",
    "are very similar , with no apparent radial gradient ( figure  [ metalfields ] ) .",
    "the three most outlying metallicities found are for fields d14 and d12 ( both with halo [ fe / h]@xmath3 - 1.7 ) and for f24 ( with halo [ fe / h]@xmath69 - 0.9 ) , none of which can obviously be attributed to selection effects or contamination .",
    "fields d14 and d12 are in the n - e hemisphere of m31 , where as we ve noted the halo sample cut with v@xmath35km / s results in @xmath70% galactic contamination .",
    "while a small fraction of galactic contamination is expected for f24 in the s - e hemisphere , this would in fact make the spectroscopic [ fe / h ] appear more poor , not rich .",
    "these fields may therefore host accreted substructures which are not as well phase mixed as the halo in general .",
    "our findings therefore suggest that there is a metal - poor , non - rotating halo component in m31 , with comparable metallicity to the milky way s non - rotating stellar halo @xcite .",
    "the accuracy of our m31 halo metallicity measurement is limited by the continuum fitting in these relatively low signal - to - noise spectra , with additional uncertainty from systematic effects such as residual sky .",
    "the large distance of m31 implies a small uncertainty for the horizontal branch magnitude , even if the stars are drawn from relative extrema in the galaxy .",
    "furthermore , the rms dispersion in @xmath71-band magnitudes of the total sample of halo stars is very small ( @xmath20.5 mag ) .",
    "these effects diminish the impact on the derived metallicity of an uncertainty in distance in the rgb population we are observing in our sample .",
    "a formal error for each fit is obtained from the signal - to - noise of the cat lines , with an extra error estimated for the uncertainty in sky subtraction .",
    "the typical uncertainty is @xmath72  dex .",
    "a concern is that the average cat metallicity in a given field may be dominated by a few outlying spectra , although this should only be a factor for increasing the metallicity ( increasing the ew ) .",
    "this potential systematic error can be tested by dividing up the fields into halves and comparing metallicity measurements . generally subsamples have metallicities consistent to within 0.2  dex .",
    "however , a danger with this approach is that for a small enough sample , variations will be present due to the random sampling of the underlying metallicity distribution .    our sample of rgb stars isolated to have halo kinematics ( and importantly windowing out the extended rotating component ) have allowed a census of the halo along both major and minor axis fields , and underlying the range of photometric substructures observed .",
    "the uniformly low ( @xmath73 } = -1.4 $ ]  @xmath1=0.2 ) metallicity we measure across the fields reflects a stellar halo component which has a distinctly different origin from the extended rotating component .",
    "our discovery is complemented by the independent discovery of a halo component with metal poor ( [ fe / h ] = @xmath74 ) stars lying at large radius ( 60150  kpc ) @xcite . their outer halo component and bridging halo / bulge component at smaller radii are similarly metal - poor to the halo we describe here . however , the 47 pure halo stars at @xmath75kpc in @xcite and @xcite lack sufficient statistics to ascertain whether they are consistent with an outer extension of the kinematically characterized , pressure - supported , non - rotating component we describe in this paper .",
    "the larger field to field halo metallicity dispersion ( @xmath76 ) found by @xcite and @xcite is suggestive of an increasingly inhomogeneous halo component with radius , and is consistent with the dramatic structural variations from wide - field photometric surveys of m31 s outer halo by ibata et al .",
    "( 2006 ) and @xcite .",
    "these findings are also consistent with the much less phase - mixed outer halo in the simulations of @xcite , suggesting that the outer halo may truly represent a component with a much longer assembly and relaxation time than the inner halo .",
    "while our study has uncovered conclusive evidence for a pressure supported metal - poor halo in m31 within the inner 70kpc ( complemented by the co - discovery of a metal - poor halo in kalirai et al .",
    "2006 and gilbert et al .",
    "2006 ) , evidence for metal - poor stars in andromeda s halo reaches back to @xcite , who used deep imaging in the outer halo to probe the halo cmd .",
    "even earlier results from rr  lyrae studies suggested that old , metal - poor stars might be present in the halo @xcite .",
    "metal - poor rgb stars were first identified spectroscopically in the halo using keck @xcite , with speculations that differences appeared to exist between subsets of the rgbs in their sample , finding a large range in metallicities , and suggesting that disk - like stars were found at radial distances as large as 34kpc ( de - projected ) . however , with only two isolated pointings and small numbers of stars ( 23 and 29 respectively ) , these studies had no means to characterize the outer structural components in m31 .",
    "while our keck spectroscopic data do not suffer from age / metallicity degeneracy as do the earliest photometric studies of the halo , the most important ingredient for our discovery is the detailed knowledge of the extended rotating component which allows for the separation of populations by their kinematics .",
    "thus when stars are selected in a similar way to the halo star selection in galactic studies ( i.e.  by extreme kinematics ",
    "@xcite ) , a similar [ fe / h]@xmath3 - 1.4 metallicity is found .",
    "since m31 and the milky way reveal so many differences in their evolutionary histories and environments ( e.g. , bulge size , thin disk scale , number and types of globular clusters , scale sizes and types of satellite dwarf galaxies ",
    "e.g. , @xcite ) , it is of considerable interest that they seem to have developed similar metal - poor stellar components in their outskirts , likely near their formation epoch .",
    "if models of halo formation are correct @xcite , this similarity in metallicity and dispersion , along with the similar dark matter masses @xcite , suggest that both galaxies must have originated in comparable overdensity contrasts and perhaps attracted similar numbers and masses of merger accretions early on .    our finding of a low halo metallicity in m31 contrasts , however , with recent measurements of the stellar halo metallicity distribution in a sample of more distant edge - on galaxies by @xcite .",
    "these authors derive photometric metallicity estimates from hst / wfpc2 observations and find a strong correlation between halo [ fe / h ] and galaxy luminosity ( figure  [ renda ] ) . for a luminosity similar to m31 or the milky way , their relation predicts a mean halo abundance of [ fe / h]@xmath77 , significantly more metal - rich than that found here .",
    "it is important to point out that the fields studied by @xcite are assumed to probe the stellar halo on the basis of their projected radii alone but this assumption has not been verified by either structural decomposition , or kinematics .",
    "we have shown that when halo stars are selected kinematically  arguably the best way in which to do so  then the metallicities inferred for the milky way and m31 are both similarily low . when combined with the recent discovery of metal - poor , [ fe / h]@xmath78 , kinematically - selected halo stars in the lower mass spiral galaxy m33 @xcite",
    ", this suggests that the true underlying stellar halo metallicity in spiral galaxies may have very little dependence on galaxy luminosity .    in fig .",
    "[ renda ] , we place our kinematically - selected halo metallicity results for m31 and m33 in the distribution of @xcite .",
    "their results suggest that galaxies with metal - rich stellar halos at @xmath79 have a longer formation history , whereas galaxies with a more metal - poor stellar halo at @xmath79 have a shorter assembly , consistent with their halo [ o / fe ] predictions . by",
    "kinematically selecting only the non - rotating halo components of the local group spirals , it is clearly a shorter assembly time , primordial halo in the @xcite simulations that would be isolated .",
    "however , @xcite define the halo as all the stellar particles in the simulation at a projected distance @xmath80kpc .",
    "clearly a direct application of this definition to m31 would result in an average [ fe / h]@xmath3 - 1 , being drawn primarily from the dominant extended rotating component ( i05 ) .",
    "note , however that the @xcite simulations ( figure  [ renda ] ) suggest that even defining the total halo in this way , finding a halo metallicity as rich as [ fe / h]@xmath3 - 1 is quite rare for virial masses as large as m31 ( @xmath81m@xmath82 ) . by contrast , in the @xcite simulations finding an early assembled stellar halo with a @xmath83m@xmath82 virial mass and an [ fe / h]@xmath3 - 1.4 ( like the mw and m31 ) occurs in only @xmath310% of the accretion histories , suggesting that the mw and m31 halos are actually quite rare for l@xmath61 spirals .",
    "however , our discovery should not be interpreted as claiming that all components of the @xmath84kpc stellar halo are metal - poor , but simply that a non - rotating metal - poor component to m31 exists which is similar in [ fe / h ] to the halo in the galaxy .",
    "there may also be a rotating halo sub - component which is more metal - rich which could effectively be windowed out of our current sample .",
    "contamination from extended rotating component stars both in velocity and metallicity makes a detailed comparison difficult .",
    "@xcite and @xcite noted that there is very clearly a persistent population with red colors ( suggesting stars which may be metal - rich or young ) along the minor axis , and beyond the region that i05 have characterized as the extended rotating component .",
    "while measuring the spectroscopic properties of this population would be interesting , the statistics in our minor axis fields are currently insufficient to show any kinematic differences or even allow robust metallicity measurements for the red and blue rgbs .",
    "future expansions of the dataset may allow the characterization of this population .    finally , it is of interest to understand how our new metal - poor component connects to the extended @xmath85 halo component discovered photometrically along the minor axis by @xcite , and also discovered through spectroscopic confirmation of halo - like , metal - poor stars at very large radius ( @xmath86kpc ) @xcite .",
    "are these all part of the same halo component , and is there a gradient in kinematics and metallicity ? again , it is difficult to assess , although the fact that massive satellites can be more easily accreted on prograde orbits ( contaminating the disk , but leaving the spherical halo intact ) , suggests that such an extension of the halo would be physically motivated .",
    "tentative evidence from this work and from @xcite for a more heterogeneous outer halo component distinct from the more phase mixed inner halo component is broadly consistent with the expectations from theory @xcite .",
    "we have presented evidence for a metal - poor , [ fe / h]@xmath87 dex , stellar halo component in m31 , by kinematically isolating 827 non - rotating stars from our survey of @xmath310,000 stars with radial velocities from keck - ii / deimos .",
    "the halo component is detectable at radii from 10kpc to 70kpc , and underlies a more dominant extended rotating component .",
    "this metal - poor halo component has no detectable metallicity gradient , and is consistent with an early and rapid formation period as suggested by the simulations of @xcite .",
    "the more metal - rich stellar halo components observed with hst by @xcite may be indicative of components accreted later over longer assembly times .    our analysis has also allowed us to constrain the kinematic properties of the m31 halo .",
    "the windowed halo sample shows no evidence for rotation about any axis , though there is clearly a drop in the velocity dispersion of the population with distance away from the galaxy center .",
    "fitting an nfw model to these data and using the cosmologically - motivated constraint that the model concentration @xmath88 , provides a lower limit to the virial mass of the halo of @xmath89 ( 99% confidence ) .",
