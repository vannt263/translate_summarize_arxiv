    "amphiphilic molecules such as block copolymers and lipids can self - assemble into many different structures when dissolved in solution @xcite .",
    "this phenomenon has recently attracted a great deal of attention @xcite , driven both by the potential applications of self - assembled amphiphile aggregates in the encapsulation and delivery of active chemicals such as drugs and genetic material @xcite and the insights gained into biological systems @xcite .    for solutions of a single type of simple amphiphile , such as a diblock copolymer or simple lipid ,",
    "it is fairly straightforward to gain a basic understanding of which aggregate will form in a given system @xcite .",
    "although a variety of factors , such as the concentration @xcite and size @xcite of the amphiphilic molecules , may play a role , the shape of the aggregates is most easily controlled via the architecture of the amphiphile ; that is , the relative sizes of its hydrophilic and hydrophobic blocks . if the hydrophilic component is large ( or appears large due to its interaction with the solvent ) , then spherical micelles are seen .",
    "however , if the hydrophobic block is large , lamellar structures such as vesicles form . for intermediate architectures , cylindrical micelles",
    "are observed , either as isolated , worm - like structures @xcite , or branched networks @xcite .",
    "the experimental phenomenology is much richer in binary mixtures of amphiphiles @xcite , especially those that individually self - assemble into different aggregates @xcite .",
    "novel structures are observed , such as undulating cylinders and branched , octopus - like aggregates @xcite .",
    "binary mixtures have been investigated in a wide variety of amphiphile systems .",
    "a great deal of work has been carried out on lipid - detergent systems @xcite , and over the past few years lipid @xcite and block copolymer @xcite mixtures have been widely studied .",
    "lipid mixtures are of interest due to their presence in cells and role in biological transport processes @xcite . in the case of block copolymers",
    ", on the other hand , the motivation for the use of two amphiphiles is that it greatly increases the number of design parameters and gives finer control over the self - assembly .",
    "the architectures and concentrations of both species may now be varied , as may the stage in the self - assembly process at which they are blended @xcite .",
    "a number of properties of the aggregates may be controlled , such as their shape @xcite , stability @xcite , and ability to solubilize hydrophobic compounds @xcite .",
    "an interesting and recent example is the addition of lamella - forming copolymers with a short hydrophilic block to a solution of longer sphere - formers to increase the solubilization capacity of the resulting micelles while maintaining their compact and stable spherical shape @xcite . in the current paper , we study a basic example of such a system : a solution of sphere - forming diblock copolymers to which an admixture of diblocks with a much shorter hydrophilic block is added . to study the problem in as simple a form as possible , we consider two copolymer species that are formed of the same species a ( hydrophilic ) and b ( hydrophobic ) , and have the same length hydrophobic blocks .",
    "we focus on the case where the sphere - formers remain in the majority , and , using coarse - grained mean - field theory , investigate how the small spherical aggregates formed are modified by the presence of the shorter copolymers .",
    "we perform a broad scan of the system s parameter space , and study how the core composition and radius of the micelles are affected by the interactions , concentrations and architectures of the two polymers .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the following section ,",
    "we introduce the coarse - grained mean - field theory ( self - consistent field theory ) that will be used .",
    "we then present and discuss our theoretical results , and give our conclusions in the final section .",
    "self - consistent field theory ( scft ) @xcite is a coarse - grained mean - field model that has been used successfully to model equilibrium @xcite and metastable @xcite structures in polymers blends and melts .",
    "scft has several features that make it particularly suitable for the study of the current problem of small binary aggregates .",
    "first , its general advantages are that it is less computationally intensive than simulation techniques such as monte carlo , yet , for sufficiently long amphiphiles @xcite , provides comparably accurate predictions of micelle size and shape @xcite . secondly , as a relatively simple , coarse - grained theory",
    ", it will allow us to model the broad phenomenology of the system clearly and show how general the phenomena observed are likely to be .",
    "furthermore , scft has a specific feature that is especially useful in the current problem : it makes no initial assumption about the segregation of two copolymers of different architecture within the micelle , provided the two amphiphile species are formed from the same types of monomer .",
    "this will enable us to demonstrate that effects such as the encapsulation of one polymer species by another within the micelle arise spontaneously and do not require further assumptions to be made .    to make our discussion more concrete",
    ", we now outline the mathematical structure and main assumptions of scft as applied to the current system .",
    "the theory considers an ensemble of many polymers .",
    "these are modeled as random walks in space , which means that fine details of their molecular structure are not taken into account @xcite .",
    "the inter - molecular interactions are modeled by assuming that the system is incompressible and introducing a contact potential between the molecules @xcite , the strength of which is fixed by the flory @xmath0 parameter @xcite .",
    "the first step in finding an approximation method ( scft ) for this problem is to think of each polymer molecule as being acted on by a field produced by all other molecules in the system @xcite .",
    "viewing the problem in this way involves no approximations in itself , but has several advantages when computing numerical solutions .",
    "first , it transforms the @xmath1-body problem of modeling a system of @xmath1 polymers into @xmath1 @xmath2-body problems @xcite .",
    "the advantage of this arises from the fact that , since we are interested in computing average properties , we consider the partition sum over all possible system configurations .",
    "this means that all molecules of a given species may be treated as equivalent and we in fact only have to solve one @xmath2-body problem for each type of polymer in the system .",
    "second , this approach allows us to replace the discrete sum over the system configurations by a continuous integral over smooth functions , which is easier to deal with numerically @xcite .",
    "finally , the computational burden of the problem may be sharply reduced by finding approximate forms of the field variables using a saddle - point ( mean - field ) approximation @xcite , which corresponds to neglecting fluctuations in the system .",
    "scft can be used to study a wide variety of polymer systems , including simple homopolymers @xcite , more complex copolymers @xcite and mixtures of these @xcite .",
    "we now outline the application of scft to our current system of two amphiphiles in a solvent , which we model by a simple mixture of two types of ab block copolymer with a homopolymer solvent .",
    "we take the lamella - forming species of copolymer to have a mean - squared end - to - end distance of @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the monomer length and @xmath1 is the degree of polymerization @xcite .",
    "this polymer contains @xmath5 hydrophobic b - monomers and @xmath6 hydrophilic a - monomers . to consider the effect of different lamella - formers on the self - assembly , we vary the number of a monomers while keeping @xmath5 fixed .",
    "we note that our use of the term lamella - former to refer to amphiphiles with short hydrophilic blocks is not precise , as these molecules might precipitate rather than self - assemble in solution @xcite if not mixed with an amphiphile with a larger hydrophilic block such as a sphere - former .",
    "furthermore , in aggregates formed from a mixture of sphere - formers and amphiphiles with a short hydrophilic block , the presence of these latter molecules might lead to the formation of regions of negative curvature rather than the zero - curvature regions that would be favored by a lamella - former .    all sphere - formers considered contain @xmath7 hydrophobic monomers , but their overall length is necessarily greater and is given by @xmath8 , where @xmath9 .",
    "as above , the number of a monomers @xmath10 is varied with @xmath5 fixed in order to investigate the effect of sphere - former architecture on the aggregate properties . for simplicity ,",
    "the number @xmath11 of a monomers in a homopolymer solvent molecule is also fixed at @xmath5 .",
    "since we focus on spherical aggregates , we assume spherical symmetry of the calculation box with reflecting boundary conditions at the origin and outer limit of the system .    in this paper , we keep the amounts of copolymer and homopolymer fixed ; that is , we work in the canonical ensemble . applying the procedure described above , we find that the scft approximation to the free energy of our system has the form @xmath12 \\nonumber\\\\ &   -(\\overline{\\phi}_\\text{a}+\\overline{\\phi}_\\text{b})\\ln ( q_\\text{ab}/v)-[(\\overline{\\phi}_\\text{a2}+\\overline{\\phi}_\\text{b2})/\\alpha]\\ln ( q_\\text{ab2}/v ) -\\overline{\\phi}_\\text{s}\\ln ( q_\\text{s}/v ) \\label{fe}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the @xmath13 are the mean volume fractions of the various components .",
    "the @xmath14 are the local volume fractions , with @xmath15 or @xmath16 for the hydrophilic components of species @xmath2 and @xmath17 , @xmath18 or @xmath19 for the hydrophobic components and @xmath20 for the a homopolymer solvent .",
    "the strength of the repulsive interaction between the a monomers ( hydrophilic component and solvent ) and b monomers ( hydrophobic component ) is determined by the flory parameter @xmath0 .",
    "@xmath21 is the total volume , @xmath22 is the volume of a monomer , and @xmath23 is the scft free energy of a homogeneous system of the same composition .",
    "this last quantity contains terms arising from the entropy of mixing of the different species @xcite and a term proportional to @xmath0 describing the interactions of the species in the absence of self - assembly @xcite .",
    "the architectures of the individual molecules enter through the single - chain partition functions @xmath24 . as an example , that for the homopolymer is given by @xcite @xmath25=\\int\\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{r}\\,q_\\text{s}(\\mathbf{r},s)q_\\text{s}^\\dagger(\\mathbf{r},s )",
    "\\label{single_chain_partition}\\ ] ] where the @xmath26 and @xmath27 terms are single chain propagators @xcite .",
    "the partition functions of the copolymer chains are calculated in a similar way .",
    "we now recall that the polymer molecules are modeled as random walks in an external field that describes their interactions with the other molecules in the system .",
    "this is reflected in the fact that the propagators satisfy diffusion equations with a field term .",
    "again considering the case of the homopolymer , we have @xmath28q_\\text{s}(\\mathbf{r},s ) \\label{diffusion}\\ ] ] where @xmath29 is a curve parameter specifying the position along the polymer and the initial condition is @xmath30 .",
    "the copolymer propagators are computed similarly , although in this case the corresponding diffusion equation is solved with the field @xmath31 and the prefactor of the @xmath32 term appropriate to each of the two sections of the copolymer @xcite . in the case of the longer sphere - forming copolymer , the fields",
    "must be multiplied by the ratio @xmath33 to take into account the higher degree of polymerization @xcite .",
    "the derivation of the mean - field free energy @xmath34 also generates a set of simultaneous equations linking the values of the fields and densities .",
    "the first of these simply states that all volume fractions must add to @xmath2 at all points due to the incompressibility of the system ; however , we also find the following linear relation @xmath35 \\label{scft_equation}\\ ] ] furthermore , the homopolymer density is related to the propagators ( see eqn .  [ diffusion ] ) according to @xcite @xmath36}\\int^1_0\\mathrm{d}s\\ , q_\\text{s}(\\mathbf{r},s)q_\\text{s}^\\dagger(\\mathbf{r},s ) \\label{density}\\ ] ] the copolymer densities are computed in a similar way , with the integration limits set to give the required amounts of each species .    in order to calculate the scft density profiles for a given set of polymer concentrations , eqn .",
    "[ scft_equation ] must be solved with the densities calculated as in eqn .",
    "[ density ] and taking account of the incompressibility of the system . to begin",
    ", we make a initial guess for the fields @xmath31 with the approximate form of a micelle and solve the diffusion equations to calculate the propagators and then the densities corresponding to these fields ( see eqns [ diffusion ] and [ density ] ) .",
    "new values for the fields are now calculated using the new @xmath14 , and the @xmath37 are updated accordingly @xcite .",
    "the procedure is repeated until convergence is achieved .",
    "the diffusion equations are solved using a finite difference method @xcite . to resolve the more complex features of the micelle density profiles ,",
    "it is necessary to use a relatively fine discretization : a spatial step size of @xmath38 and a step size for the curve parameter @xmath29 of @xmath39 .    until now",
    ", we have only considered isolated spherical micelles .",
    "we must now link the thermodynamics of a single aggregate to those of a larger system containing many micelles . to do this , we proceed as follows @xcite .",
    "firstly , we calculate the free - energy density of a box containing a single spherical aggregate surrounded by solvent . since we assume spherical symmetry , the calculation is effectively one - dimensional .",
    "the volume of the simulation box containing the aggregate is then varied , keeping the volume fraction of copolymer constant , until the box size with the minimum free - energy density is found . provided",
    "the system is dilute , so that micelle is surrounded by a large volume of solvent , this mimics the behavior of a larger system ( of fixed volume and fixed copolymer volume fraction ) containing many micelles .",
    "the reason for this is that such a system minimizes its total free energy by changing the number of micelles and therefore the volume ( ` box size ' ) occupied by each .",
    "minimizing the free energy density in this way locates the micelle that would have the lowest free energy and hence be most likely to be observed in a sample containing many aggregates .",
    "this approach allows many - micelle systems to be investigated using inexpensive one - dimensional calculations on single aggregates , and its predictions on micelle radii and shape transitions often agree well with experiment @xcite .",
    "we divide the results section into four subsections . these focus on the effect on the micelle morphology of , respectively , the lamella - former concentration , the strength of the interaction between the two species , the lamella - former architecture and the sphere - former architecture .",
    "to begin , we investigate the effect of the gradual addition of lamella - former to a system of sphere - formers , finding the micelle of lowest free energy using the method of variable subsystem size described above . to see the effect of blending two species as clearly as possible",
    ", we consider a pair of strongly mismatched copolymers : a lamella - former with @xmath40 and a sphere - former with @xmath41 .",
    "the flory parameter is set to @xmath42 , a high value which causes relatively sharp interfaces to form between the species a and b. we fix the overall volume fraction of copolymer to @xmath43 , to give a reasonable volume of solvent around the micelle without making the simulation box so large that the calculations become slow .",
    "cuts through the density profiles of the spherically - symmetric aggregates formed in a solution of lamella - former with @xmath40 mixed with a sphere - former with @xmath41 .",

    "figure [ conccut45_fig ] shows a series of radial cuts through the density profile of the optimum spherical aggregate as the volume fraction of lamella - former is increased from @xmath44 to @xmath47 of all copolymers in steps of @xmath43 . for the lowest of these lamella - former concentrations ( figure [ conccut45_fig]a ) ,",
    "the sphere - formers and lamella - formers are homogeneously mixed in the core , and a simple mixed micelle is formed ( see the sketch in figure [ micelle_fig ] ) . this structure is little different from that which would be formed in a system of pure sphere - forming amphiphiles : the concentration of lamella - formers is not yet sufficiently large to have a strong effect on the micelle morphology . indeed , for such low lamella - former concentrations , mixed micelles may not be present @xcite , with pure aggregates of the two species forming instead .",

    "however , as more lamella - forming molecules are added ( figure [ conccut45_fig]b ) , their influence on the core composition of the micelle becomes clear .",
    "a polymer with a large hydrophobic component that naturally forms flat bilayers or even structures of negative curvature is in an energetically highly unfavorable state in a small , positively curved micelle . in consequence , these molecules segregate to the center of the aggregate , where they form a tightly - wrapped bilayer .",

    "the polymers in the inner leaflet of this bilayer are in a more favorable negative curvature state , with their hydrophilic components pointing in towards the center of the micelle .",

    ", they are mixed with the sphere - formers , which can no longer form their preferred simple micelle structure , but strongly prefer the positively - curved surface of the new spherical aggregate to its core .",

    "this process continues in figure [ conccut45_fig]d , where @xmath47 of all copolymers are lamella - forming . here",
    ", a number of the sphere - formers have mixed with the inner leaflet of the lamella - former bilayer , meaning that the overall structure has the form of a ( very ) small bilayer vesicle ( see the sketch in figure [ vesicle_fig ] ) .",
    "small vesicles with a preferred radius have indeed been seen in experiments on mixtures of sphere- and lamella - forming amphiphiles @xcite .",
    "their existence has also been predicted in recent lattice scft calculations by li et al.@xcite .",
    "our current work considers a different region of parameter space to these lattice - based calculations , which focus on weakly mismatched amphiphiles and ( usually ) higher lamella - former concentrations . in consequence ,",
    "the mechanism by which the preferred vesicle radius is selected appears to be rather different in the two studies . in our work , strong segregation of the two species occurs and the compositions of the inner and outler leaflets of the bilayer are quite different . the small vesicle structure forms as it accommodates both the preference of the shorter copolymers for a bilayer structure and that of the longer , sphere - forming amphiphiles for positively - curved surfaces .",
    "this is in contrast to the results of li et al .",
    "@xcite , where the vesicles are larger and the two bilayer leaflets have similar compositions .",

    "in contrast , for larger amounts of lamella - forming copolymer , the fraction of a - block in the more strongly - interacting system grows more and more rapidly as the preferred aggregate changes from a closed micelle to an open vesicle .",
    "the clearest difference between the two systems is seen in the behavior of the amount of solvent in the core as the lamella - former concentration is increased ( see the lower two curves in figure [ radius_comp_conc_fig]b ) . in the @xmath48 system , where the core is largely composed of copolymers ,",
    "the fraction of solvent remains fairly constant at around @xmath55-@xmath56 .",
    "the fact that this value is a little higher than might be expected from the density profiles in figure [ conccut30_fig ] , and also varies slightly , can be attributed to the fact that our simple definition of the core radius means that a thin shell of solvent is always included as part of the core . in the system with stronger repulsion between the a and b components , the core solvent fraction starts at a similar small value , remaining close to this as the lamella - former volume fraction is increased and the morphology of the system changes from a simple micelle to the aba structure shown in figure [ encapsulated_fig ] .",
    "however , as the fraction of lamella - formers @xmath49 is increased towards @xmath53 , the fraction of solvent in the core grows very quickly as the aggregate expands towards a vesicle .",
    "we have checked a selection of these calculations for a much more dilute system with an overall copolymer volume fraction of @xmath57 , focusing in particular on those lamella - former volume fractions where the aggregate changes from one morphology to another .",
    "such a dilute system may be more appropriate for observation of the small spherical structures considered in this paper , since a more concentrated solution might form larger aggregates such as worm - like micelles .",
    "we therefore wish to check that the form of the optimum spherical aggregates is not strongly sensitive to concentration ( although the likelihood of their formation with respect to larger aggregates may of course depend on the concentration ) .",
    "indeed , little change in the form of the aggregates is observed .",
    "the most significant difference is that , in the dilute case , the transition between the simple micelle and the aba structure in the @xmath42 system occurs when @xmath49 is between @xmath45 and @xmath58 , rather than between @xmath43 and @xmath45 in the @xmath59 system .",
    "this preference for small spherical micelles in more dilute systems is in line with the known concentration dependence of block copolymer solutions @xcite .",
    "similar small shifts in the morphology transitions as the overall copolymer concentration is varied , or no appreciable shifts at all , are observed in all the systems considered in this paper , where the polymers considered aggregate reasonably strongly and the free - energy minima associated with the various micelle shapes will be relatively sharp .",
    "this is not the case for shorter or more weakly - interacting polymers , where the concentration dependence may be quite strong .      in the results discussed in the preceding subsection",

    "the reason for this is that , as the aggregate shrinks and solvent is slowly expelled from the center of the aggregate , the amount of a - blocks changes relatively little .",
    "these blocks therefore come to constitute a larger fraction of the core . as the lamella - former a - blocks",
    "are lengthened still further , we observe a sharp drop in the fraction of hydrophilic material in the core , as the system contracts to form a simple mixed micelle .",

    ", we focused on strongly mismatched copolymers and so used a highly asymmetric sphere - former with @xmath41 .",
    "we now vary the length of the hydrophilic block of the sphere - forming copolymer over a wide range , starting from a short molecule with @xmath79 and increasing the number of a monomers until @xmath81 .",
    "the architecture of the lamella - former is fixed , with @xmath40 , and , as in all the above cases , the total copolymer volume fraction is kept constant at @xmath43 .",
    "three quarters of these copolymers are sphere - forming , so that @xmath82 . as in our studies of the effect of copolymer concentration and lamella - former architecture , we consider two values of the flory parameter : @xmath42 and @xmath48 .    in figure [ spherecut45_fig]a to d , we show cuts through the density profiles of the optimum aggregates formed when @xmath79 , @xmath83 , @xmath84 and @xmath85 for @xmath48 . despite the wide variation in the number of hydrophilic monomers , roughly similar small vesicle structures are formed in all cases , with particularly little change in morphology being observed between @xmath80 and @xmath85 .",
    "provided the two copolymer species are sufficiently strongly mismatched to segregate within the aggregate , there is indeed no reason to suspect that increasing the sphere - former a - block length further should cause major qualitative changes to the form of the aggregate , as the sphere - formers have already reached the outer surface and can move no further .",
    "in fact , the differences between the four panels of figure [ spherecut45_fig ] can be attributed mainly to the fact that increasing the length of the sphere - former hydrophilic block at constant @xmath49 gradually reduces the amount of sphere - former hydrophobic block , with the result that the hydrophobic core becomes more and more dominated by the lamella - former . in consequence , the core radius of the aggregate increases somewhat , as the lamella - formers push outwards towards their preferred flat state .",
