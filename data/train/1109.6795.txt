    "no hints exist yet as to the value of @xmath11 , and oscillation experiments are not sensitive to the latter two cp - violating phases , which are nonzero only if neutrinos are their own antiparticles ( i.e. , majorana particles ) .",
    "so far , two of the mixing angles , @xmath8 and @xmath10 , have been measured  @xcite and are large .",
    "the value of @xmath9 , on the other hand , appears to be quite small .",
    "it was first significantly constrained by the chooz experiment in 1999  @xcite ; the result is shown in fig .",

    "the final expression is found to depend not on the absolute squared masses but on two independent squared - mass differences  @xmath22 and @xmath14 . while both the sign and magnitude of the first of these are known  @xcite , only the magnitude of the second squared - mass difference is known  @xcite .",
    "that is , we do not know if @xmath6 is more or less massive than @xmath4 and @xmath5 ; the first possibility is referred to as the normal mass hierarchy and the latter , the inverted mass hierarchy .",
    "the oscillation mode of present interest is @xmath1 . to leading order :    @xmath23    with @xmath24 in units of @xmath25 , @xmath18 in km , and @xmath15 in gev .",
    "when we account for the propagation of the neutrinos through matter , additional , higher order terms appear in eq .",
    "[ oscprobleading ]  @xcite .",
    "the full expression depends on the cp - violating phase @xmath11 and the mass hierarchy ; accordingly , the results presented here will be sensitive to these parameters .    under certain conditions  @xcite , leptonic cp violation can lead to non - conservation of baryon number , which in turn can help explain the observed matter - antimatter asymmetry in our universe .",
    "access to the value of the leptonic cp - violating phase , namely @xmath11 , is controlled by the size of @xmath9 .",
    "should @xmath9 be sufficiently large , one may be able to measure @xmath11 with current or next - generation long - baseline neutrino oscillation experiments .",
    "finding , on the other hand , that @xmath9 is zero could point to a new symmetry .",
    "the minos experiment consists of three key parts : the neutrinos at the main injector ( numi ) neutrino beam at fermilab , the near detector ( nd ) at fermilab , and the far detector ( fd ) in soudan , mn .",
    "the numi beam  @xcite is produced by striking a graphite target with 120-gev protons from fermilab s main injector , focusing the resulting secondary hadrons ( mostly pions , some kaons ) using pulsed - current magnetic horns , and allowing these hadrons to decay leptonically in flight .",
    "although the horns polarities are set to focus @xmath26 and @xmath27 and defocus @xmath28 and @xmath29 , a small fraction of negative hadrons travel along the horns axis , avoid being defocused , and remain in the beam .",
    "the primary decay mode for these hadrons is @xmath30 or @xmath31 ; a very small fraction decay to @xmath32 or @xmath33 .",
    "ultimately , the resulting neutrino beam is 92% @xmath2 and 7% @xmath34 ; @xmath0 and @xmath35 make up the remainder .    the minos detectors are functionally identical , magnetized tracking calorimeters .",
    "the 980-ton nd is located approximately 1 km downstream of the numi target and measures the neutrino beam s initial composition and energy spectrum .",
    "the 5.4-kton fd is located 735 km downstream in the soudan mine in northern minnesota and measures the oscillated beam s composition and energy spectrum .",
    "both detectors consist of alternating layers of 2.54-cm thick steel and 1-cm thick plastic scintillator .",
    "the scintillator is segmented into optically - isolated , 4.1-cm wide strips and serves as the active portion of each detector .",
    "light from the strips is read out via optical fibers and multi - anode photomultiplier tubes .",
    "further details can be found in ref .",
    "though a multi - purpose experiment , minos was designed and optimized to study @xmath2 disappearance .",
    "the event type of interest in such an analysis is a @xmath2 charged - current ( cc ) interaction :    @xmath36    where n represents a nucleon or a quark inside a nucleon and x represents the resulting hadronic recoil system .",
    "the track produced by the muon typically extends far beyond the shower activity of the recoil system ( see left of fig .",
    "[ eventdisplay ] ) , enabling straightforward identification of such an event . in the analysis at hand , however , the event type of interest is a @xmath0 cc interaction :    @xmath37    in the minos detectors , the electromagnetic shower generated by the electron has a radiation length of 1.76 cm  @xmath3830% less than the thickness of a steel layer  and a molire radius of 3.7 cm  @xmath3810% less than the width of a scintillator strip .",
    "as a result , the electromagnetic shower becomes fully interspersed with the hadronic shower ( see center of fig .  [ eventdisplay ] ) .",
    "the challenge , then , is to distinguish this type of event from the primary background event type  the neutral - current ( nc ) interaction ( see right of fig .",
    "[ eventdisplay ] ) :    @xmath39          this is the third @xmath0 appearance search conducted by minos . in all three analyses , event selection consisted of three general stages .",
    "first , we required that the event took place within a fiducial volume .",
    "next , we rejected events that were clearly or likely background .",
    "this `` pre - selection '' eliminated most @xmath2 cc events by requiring that any reconstructed track in the event be no more than 24 planes long and extend no more than 15 planes beyond the hadronic shower .",
    "we also required that an event have at least five contiguous planes with energy greater than half that deposited on average by a minimum ionizing particle .",
    "events were required to be in - time with and to point in a direction consistent with the neutrino beam pulses .",
    "the reconstructed energy of the event had to lie between 1 and 8 gev , as most events below 1 gev are from nc interactions and @xmath40 is negligibly small above 8 gev .",
    "the last stage of the selection involved the use of a sophisticated event identification technique to separate signal from background . in our first two @xmath0 appearance analyses  @xcite",
    ", we used a neural network ( named artificial neural network , or ann ) whose input variables were reconstructed quantities characterizing the longitudinal and transverse energy deposition profiles of an event .",
    "the present analysis utilizes instead a novel technique named library event matching ( lem ) that uses raw energy deposition information instead of reconstructed quantities and is based on a pattern recognition algorithm .",
    "we begin by comparing a given candidate event to each of @xmath41 simulated events ( the `` library '' ) , of which @xmath42 are background events and @xmath43 are signal events .",
    "intuitively , the comparison determines the extent to which the topologies and strip pulse heights of the candidate and library events are similar .",
    "quantitatively , this is performed using a likelihood :    @xmath44 , \\label{lemlikelihood}\\ ] ]    where @xmath45 is the poisson probability for observing @xmath46 given mean @xmath47 and @xmath48 is the charge ( in photoelectrons ) deposited in strip @xmath21 of plane @xmath49 of event @xmath50 ( candidate or library ) .",
    "once this matching process is completed for a given candidate event , the library events are ranked by their @xmath51 values .",
    "the top 50 of these , designated the `` best matches , '' are summarized by three variables : ( 1 ) the fraction that are signal ( @xmath0 cc ) events , ( 2 ) for these signal events , the average fraction of total event energy in the hadronic recoil system , and ( 3 ) for these signal events , the average fraction of deposited charge that overlaps between each of them and the candidate event .",
    "these variables , along with the reconstructed energy of the candidate event , are given as inputs to a neural network ; the output is the lem discriminant , shown in fig .",
    "[ lemdistro ] .",
    "the present analysis represents three improvements over the most recent previous analysis , the effects of which are summarized by fig .",
    "[ bettersens ] .",
    "an additional exposure of @xmath52 protons on the numi target provides a modest 17% increase in the size of our data set . using lem instead of ann provides a gain in sensitivity to @xmath53 of about 15% .",
    "finally , instead of cutting at the optimal value of the discriminant ( found to be 0.7 for lem ) and comparing the number of events above that value to the expectation ( as we did in the previous two analyses ) , we perform a fit to the lem discriminant distribution ( optimal binning was found to be 0.6 - 0.7 , 0.7 - 0.8 , 0.8 - 1.0 ) , obtaining an additional 12% increase in sensitivity . the basic approach to making a background prediction",
    ", however , remains unchanged  count the events observed in the nd and use the fd and nd simulations to `` extrapolate '' this to the fd .",
    "assuming the normal mass hierarchy .",
    "the contour labeled `` ann @xmath54 0.7 '' is the sensitivity achieved by repeating the last analysis with the additional data included .",
    "the `` lem @xmath54 0.7 '' contour is the sensitivity for a counting experiment performed with lem instead of ann using the same full data set .",
    "finally , the `` lem 3 bins '' sensitivity is obtained by performing a shape fit to the lem distribution.,width=302 ]      events due to nc interactions constitute the primary background in this analysis .",
    "contributions to the background from @xmath2 cc and intrinsic beam @xmath0 cc interactions are smaller but non - negligible ; the @xmath55 oscillation mode allows the possibility of @xmath3 cc interactions , an additional source of background .",
    "such a multi - component background complicates the aforementioned extrapolation process , as each of the components is affected differently by the transition from nd to fd ( e.g. , nc interaction rates are not affected by oscillations while the various cc interaction rates are affected to differing extents ) .",
    "consequently , we perform the background prediction component - by - component . in particular , the background prediction for component @xmath16 ( nc , @xmath2 cc , @xmath0 cc ) in analysis bin @xmath56 is given by :      where the individual @xmath58 and @xmath59 terms stand for event counts . in a manner similar to that of the @xmath3 cc interactions , signal",
    "@xmath0 cc interactions `` appear '' due to oscillations ( in this case , via the @xmath1 mode ) . as such",
    ", these event types appear only in the fd and can not be extrapolated from the nd using eq .",
    "[ extrapolation ] ; we use a more involved but conceptually similar approach based on the observed nd @xmath2 cc spectrum to predict the event counts due to these interactions .",
    "the @xmath60 term stands out on the right - hand - side of eq .",
    "[ extrapolation ] . while the total number of events in the nd data is straightforwardly obtained ( simply apply the relevant cuts and count them ) , the means of determining the individual contributions of the three background event types to this number",
    "are far from obvious .",
    "our solution to this problem takes advantage of the flexibility of the numi beam configuration .",
    "in addition to taking data in the standard configuration , we also take data ( albeit with considerably smaller exposures ) in the so - called `` horn - off '' ( focusing horns turned off ) and `` high - energy '' ( target pulled farther away from the focusing horns , horn currents increased slightly ) configurations .",
    "these configurations produce neutrino beams with different true energy spectra ( see fig .",
    "[ hornconfs ] ) , which in turn produce activity in the nd with different relative fractions of nc , @xmath2 cc , and intrinsic beam @xmath0 cc events .        combining the total nd data rate in each of the three configurations with the simulated background component ratios between configurations , we perform a fit and",
    "obtain the @xmath60 , the data background components in the standard configuration , as shown in fig .",
    "[ nddecomp ] .      the fd - to - nd ratio in eq .",
    "[ extrapolation ] is taken directly from the simulation and is responsible for the extrapolation from nd to fd .",
    "it corrects for a variety of effects , including flux differences ( @xmath61 fall - off , acceptance , decay kinematics , focusing ) , fiducial volume effects , energy smearing , oscillations , and detector effects .",
    "similarities between the detectors , including associated similarities between their simulations , allow much of the systematic uncertainty to cancel to first order in this ratio .",
    "the resulting values of this ratio , with systematic error bars , are shown in fig .",
    "[ fovern ] for each of the three nd - based background component types , as a function of reconstructed energy .",

    "the `` run periods '' referred to in the plot are periods of experiment running with slightly different conditions ; these conditions are accounted for in the simulation , thus explaining why the values of the ratio differ slightly between run periods.,width=302 ]    with this information , we are now able to make the background and signal predictions . in particular , we have the ability to adjust the predictions for different sets of oscillation parameters . to illustrate , table  [ predictions ] lists the predicted counts of events with lem @xmath54 0.7 for two reference values of @xmath9 , assuming a commonly used set of values for other oscillation parameters .",
