    "<S> concluding remarks. _ we have studied the tunneling across barriers between p- and n - doped regions of semi - dirac materials , and examined the impact of their anisotropic dispersion on transport through the junction . </S>",
    "<S> we find , first , that the role of common - path interference in the landau - zener tunneling problem is sensitively dependent on the angle of the tunneling barrier relative to the quadratic axis of the material : for instance , electrons incident normally on the barrier do not experience interference once the barrier angle exceeds a critical value @xmath57 . </S>",
    "<S> this is in turn reflected in the behavior of the @xmath3 characteristic , and specifically in the presence or absence of bias regimes with negative differential conductance . </S>",
    "<S> our analysis was twofold : first , we used a wkb treatment of tunneling under the barrier that can be readily generalized to more complicated barrier potential profiles ; second , we performed a landau - zener analysis , restricted to the case of a uniform barrier field , that served as a check on the wkb results . </S>",
    "<S> we also generalized these ideas to the multi - valley setting , where we propose that the angular dependence of the landau - zener tunneling may be leveraged to build a `` valley valve '' , as we find bias regimes where the current flowing across the junction is valley - filtered . </S>",
    "<S> although the basic ingredients of the devices proposed here are quite conventional , the semi - dirac system remains relatively unexplored from a device engineering perspective , so there may be unforeseen difficulties in building good p - n junctions and controlling their properties . </S>",
    "<S> however , we note that our analysis is quite general and applies to any material with semi - dirac dispersion ; individual materials may have widely differing critical angles and bias regimes for the effects considered here , making them more or less suitable for specific applications . </S>",
    "<S> farther afield , we note that there are also proposals to engineer semi - dirac dispersion in photonic crystals ; in such situations , our analysis suggests a promising new route to controlling the flow of light through photonic devices .    _ </S>",
