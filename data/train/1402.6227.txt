    "@xcite , superconductivity in an electron - phonon system can exist despite the fact that the kernel function @xmath69 is positive for all frequencies .",
    "the kernel for energies larger than @xmath59 is dominated by the coulomb repulsion between two electrons whose spatial distance is small , while the behavior of the kernel near the fermi surface is due to both the coulomb interaction and the attraction mediated by the plasmon - phonon excitations , between two electrons whose distance is rather large . consequently , when , for example , @xmath112 is much larger than @xmath113 , the two electrons can avoid the region of the coulomb repulsion and form a cooper pair .",

    "it is worth noting that there exists a substantial difference between experimental values of @xmath83 obtained in different experiments .",

    "[ h ]    lao-sto-fig2.eps    the observed differences of the experimental results on the critical temperatures in the laalo@xmath0-srtio@xmath0 heterostructures can be explained as follows . in different experiments @xcite ,",
    "the laalo@xmath0-srtio@xmath0 heterostructures have been grown independently .",
    "therefore those heterostructures can at least slightly differ from each other .",
    "the thermal energy @xmath128 is extremely small compared to the characteristic energies involved in the superconducting phase transition : the fermi energy of the electrons and the lo - phonon energies ( which both are of order @xmath129 mev ) . under these conditions",
    ", the critical temperatures can be very sensitive to relatively small difference of the internal properties of the fabricated heterostructures .",
    "additional factors ( e. g. , disorder , local phonons , defects , etc . )",
    "can substantially influence @xmath83 .",
    "moreover , also even the critical temperatures for bulk strontium titanate measured in different experiments @xcite differ substantially from each other .",
    "consequently , the relatively large variation of the experimental results on the critical temperature in laalo@xmath0-srtio@xmath0 heterostructure is not surprising . despite that uncertainty ,",
    "the measured critical temperatures in different experiments are of the same order .",
    "we can see that for each @xmath49 , the curve is close to only few data points .",
    "however ( i ) experimental data are obtained with a substantial numeric inaccuracy , ( ii ) experimental data from different sources do not agree even with each other .",
    "it should be noted also that , since the thermal energy corresponding to the critical temperature in the lao - sto structure is very small with respect to other energies participating in the superconductivity ( the optical - phonon energies and the fermi energy ) , even a small uncertainty of these parameters can then lead to a significant change of the critical temperature .",
    "our calculation , performed without fit using parameter values known from literature , yields the critical temperatures within the same range as in the experiments .",
    "we can therefore conclude that , taking into account the uncertainty of the experimental results on the critical temperatures , the suggested theoretical explanation of the superconducting phase transition in the laalo@xmath0-srtio@xmath0 heterostructures leads to tentative agreement with experiment .",
    "we can see different regimes of @xmath83 as a function of density in fig .",
    "2 . first , the critical temperature exhibits almost linear dependence at small @xmath11 up to @xmath130 . after reaching the maximum , as seen from fig . 2  ( b )",
    ", the critical temperature falls down at high densities as @xmath131 with a positive constant @xmath132 depending on the parameters of the system .",
    "this density dependence of @xmath83 for low and high densities can be explained as follows .    in the limit of low densities ,",
    "the effective interaction potential @xmath75 given by ( [ rpa ] ) tends to the non - screened effective interaction potential @xmath133 that does not depend on the density .",
    "also the contribution @xmath134 to the total effective interaction due to the acoustic phonons is density - independent . therefore at low densities the parameters @xmath4 tends to a constant depending on the material parameters of the system .",
    "according to ( [ tc ] ) , the critical temperature in the low - density limit is proportional to the carrier density .",
    "this result has a clear physical interpretation .",
    "let us compare ( [ tc ] ) with the known bcs expression @xcite,@xmath135 where @xmath136 is the debye frequency , @xmath137 is the density of states at the fermi energy , and @xmath138 is the model bcs matrix element .",
    "the bcs theory describes the adiabatic regime when @xmath139 , and pairing occurs for the electrons whose energies lie in the layer of width @xmath140 near the fermi energy . as a result , @xmath141 within the bcs picture . on the contrary , in strontium titanate and in the laalo@xmath0-srtio@xmath0 heterostructure at low densities the anti - adiabatic regime",
    "is realized : @xmath142 , where @xmath143 is an optical - phonon frequency . in the anti - adiabatic regime ,",
    "all electrons participate in the superconductivity",
    ". therefore the factor @xmath144 in the adiabatic regime corresponds to the factor @xmath59 in the anti - adiabatic regime .",
    "because in the anti - adiabatic regime all electrons contribute to superconductivity , the parameter @xmath4 hardly can be interpreted as @xmath145 . in a non - adiabatic regime",
    "@xmath4 must be , in general , a functional of the density of states for all energies @xmath146 .",
    "however , the density of states for a 2d system and for a sufficiently low energy ( where the band nonparabolicity is relatively small ) is@xmath147 so that @xmath148 ( and hence also @xmath4 ) does not depend on the carrier concentration at low concentrations .",
    "thus the aforesaid qualitative physical estimation leads to the the low - density behavior @xmath149 , in agreement with the result obtained in the present work .    in the opposite regime of high carrier densities ,",
    "the plasma frequency can exceed both the fermi energy and the optical phonon energies .",
    "in this regime , the plasmon mechanism of superconductivity @xcite must dominate . according to ref .",
    "@xcite , the critical temperature for an electron gas in 2d with the effective mass @xmath56 and the dielectric constant @xmath150 due to the plasmon mechanism can be modeled by an analytic expression,@xmath151   \\label{b1}\\ ] ] with the averages@xmath152 and the function@xmath153 here , @xmath154 is the euler beta function , @xmath155 is the conduction band degeneracy , @xmath156 is the fermi momentum , and @xmath157 is the thomas - fermi wave vector . for a 2d electron gas , @xmath158 does not depend on the carrier density . here , the factor @xmath155 is equal to 1 because the conduction band in srtio@xmath0 is split due to the spin - orbit interaction @xcite .",

    "@xmath49 , the acoustic - phonon mechanism stronger influences the density dependence of @xmath83 leading to deviations from the purely plasmon picture .",
    "in conclusion , we have re - formulated the kirzhnits method for a multilayer structure with several polar layers .",
