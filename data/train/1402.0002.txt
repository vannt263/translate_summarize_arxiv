    "most self - similar models have three serious limitations , ( 1 ) the flow often does not cross all critical points ( especially not the fast - magnetosonic limiting characteristic ) , with the result that the terminal wind solution is not causally disconnected from the disc , ( 2 ) singularities exist at the jet axis in radial self - similar models , and ( 3 ) for deriving self - similar models the assumption of axisymmetry is necessary .",

    "the other two limitations can only be solved using numerical simulations extending the analytical solution of e.g. v00 as done by @xcite using the mhd code nirvana @xcite , @xcite using the mhd code pluto @xcite and again with pluto in paper i for comparison with models with finite jet - emitting disc radii . @xcite",
    "extended the solution by adding the effects of resistivity . however , all of those models still assumed axisymmetry .",
    "the aim of this paper is to investigate numerically how relaxing the assumption of axisymmetry , i.e. performing full 3d numerical simulations of a disc - wind crossing all magnetohydrodynamic critical surfaces , affects the topology , structure and stability of this particular radial self - similar analytical solution .",

    "the spherical radius is denoted by @xmath12 and the cylindrical radius by @xmath13 .    as initial conditions",
    ", we use the steady , radially self - similar solution which is described in v00 and crosses all three appropriate critical surfaces , modified near the symmetry axis as described in @xcite and @xcite .",

    "we refer the reader to v00 and paper  i for further details on the self - similar solution and the numerical setup .",
    "we define the reference length @xmath19 to be unity , while the reference velocity is normalized by setting @xmath20 .",
    "time is given in units of @xmath21 , i.e. one keplerian orbit period at @xmath22 .",
    "we solve the mhd equations with the pluto code , a modular godunov - type code particularly oriented towards the treatment of astrophysical flows in the presence of discontinuities .",
    "for the present case , second order accuracy is achieved using a runge - kutta scheme ( for temporal integration ) and piecewise linear reconstruction ( in space ) .",
    "all the computations were carried out with the harten , lax , van leer approximate riemann solver with the contact discontinuity ( hllc ) .    at the lower boundary , we keep the physical variables fixed to their analytical values , however , making sure that the problem is not over - specified .",
    "outflow conditions are set at the other boundaries , i.e. all gradients across these boundaries are set to zero .",
    "we performed 3d simulations on grids with resolutions between 256@xmath23 and 1024@xmath23 cells and a domain size of [ -100,100]x[-100,100]x[10,210 ] in cartesian coordinates ( @xmath24,@xmath25,@xmath26 ) . for comparison",

    "the three - dimensional and 2.5-dimensional simulations show a similar structure of the flow . since the initial conditions are not a steady solution of the system of equations under consideration due to the modifications at the axis , the initial conditions relax toward a new final steady state within about @xmath27 , while after that only changes of a few percent are present .",
    "as expected from the high mhd signal velocities , the inner regions of the flow evolve very rapidly .",
    "mhd waves communicate changes of the inner flow to the outer regions and are clearly visible as bends moving along the field lines . in all models , a shock representing the fast magnetosonic separatrix surface ( fmss ) forms , as already described in the axisymmetric 2.5d models by @xcite , @xcite and paper  i.    in fig .",

    "all eight physical quantities ( including pressure and magnetic field components ) agree well in the axisymmetric 2.5d and the 3d models with the same resolution . since the central axis is not a symmetry axis anymore in the 3d simulations , some differences in the region @xmath28 are present .      in order to test for possible deviations from axisymmetry , we use the results of our 2.5d runs as reference . for each grid cell in the finer 3d run , we plot its quantities against its cylindrical radius and compare it with profiles in the 2.5d runs ( fig .",

    "+     +       most of the profiles show a very good agreement between the 3d run and the axisymmetric 2.5d runs and also almost no signs of deviations from axisymmetry . for values of @xmath29 , we have only data points from the 3d run . in this region in the corners of the 3d domain ,",
    "a small scatter of points around the mean profile is present which is possibly connected to boundary effects .    in the range @xmath30 , the profiles of the 2.5d and 3d simulations are in very good agreement in all quantities . for even smaller values of @xmath13 ,",
    "already the three 2.5d simulations with different resolutions show slightly different profiles , which result in different positions of the fmss between @xmath3124 depending on the resolution .",
    "the position of the fmss in the finer 3d run is also different to that in all three 2.5d runs .    inside the fmss for radii @xmath32 ,",
    "the profiles show again only small deviations from the axisymmetric mean profiles . in the innermost central spine of the flow , @xmath28 ,",
    "we see two distinct effects .",
    "the first one is the changed behaviour in @xmath33 and @xmath34 , which go to zero on the axis faster than in the 2.5d simulations ( in these simulations @xmath33 and @xmath34 also vanish on the axis due to the imposed axisymmetric boundary conditions ) .",
    "the second effect is significantly increased deviations from axisymmetry which are mainly in the toroidal velocity @xmath33 and the poloidal magnetic field components @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "these three quantities show patterns of an instability .",
    "we note however , that these quantities are not dynamically important , since at @xmath36 the flow is super - fast magnetosonic and the dominant components of the magnetic field and flow speed are @xmath37 and @xmath38 , respectively .    in fig .",
    "[ fig_bvariance ] ( top ) , we show a horizontal slice of @xmath39 through the computational domain at @xmath40 for the final time step .",
    "one can directly see that the instabilities are confined to the interior of the fmss , i.e.the fast - magnetosonic flow .",
    "the fmss is fully developed after one orbit at 1 @xmath41 and also the instabilities do not grow after this time .    when plotting @xmath35 along a ring of radius @xmath42 ( and again at @xmath40 ) as a function of @xmath43 ( fig .",
    "[ fig_bvariance ] , middle ) we see a sinusoidal behaviour which remains steady at large times .",
    "related to its temporal behaviour we can distinguish between three stages ( fig .",
    "[ fig_bvariance ] , bottom ) . up to 0.5 @xmath41 ,",
    "the fmss is still inside this radius and the variation of @xmath35 as a function of @xmath43 is only several percent .",
    "when the fmss has expanded beyond the radius @xmath42 , the variance of @xmath35 rapidly grows until at 1 @xmath41 the instability is fully established and saturates .",
    "most likely , this instability is induced by the rotating flow discretized on cartesian grid cells . since grid errors are replicated in the four quadrants , this would also explain the formation of four equidistant spiral patterns as seen in fig .",

    "<S> we compare the results of these runs with previous axisymmetric 2.5d simulations . </S>",
    "<S> the structure of the flow in all simulations shows strong similarities . </S>",
    "<S> the 3d runs reach a steady state and stay close to axisymmetry for most of the physical quantities , except for the poloidal magnetic field and the toroidal velocity which slightly deviate from axisymmetry . </S>",
    "<S> the latter quantities show signs of instabilities , which , however , are confined to the region inside the fast magnetosonic separatrix surface . </S>",
    "<S> the forces present in the flow , both of collimating and accelerating nature , are in good agreement in both the 2.5d and the 3d runs . </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that the analytical solution behaves well also after relaxing the basic assumption of axisymmetry .    </S>",
