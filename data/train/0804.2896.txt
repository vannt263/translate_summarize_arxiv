    "a mysterious dark matter dominates the matter content of the universe .",
    "although there are no dark matter candidates in the standard model , they are plentiful in extended models . among these , weakly interacting massive particles ( wimps ; @xcite ) , which may arise in supersymmetric extensions of the standard model ( susy ) @xcite or in theories that include universal extra dimensions @xcite , stand out as well motivated and detectable .    wimps may be detected directly by scattering in a laboratory detector @xcite or indirectly by their annihilation products from their highest density regions @xcite . in the case of direct detection , we must know the dark matter s phase space structure to predict rates .",
    "in early calculations , the standard halo model ( shm ) of the dark matter assumed no rotation and the density distribution was taken to be a spherical isothermal sphere with a core radius of several kpc .",
    "more recent modeling includes the cuspier central profiles from  simulations @xcite , producing changes of @xmath12 with respect to the shm @xcite .",
    "larger boosts have been claimed if dark matter is highly clumped @xcite , but it is more likely that we live outside a clump , leading to a modest reduction in the local density @xcite .",
    "simulations containing only dar matter particles have extremely high resolution , but they may not be addressing the  next to leading order \" of the model because they do not include the effect of the baryons .",

    "( 2008 ) recently demonstrated that massive satellites are preferentially dragged into the baryonic disk plane by dynamical friction where they dissolve leaving a thick dark matter disk @xcite .",
    "the precise properties of the dark disk depend on the stochastic merger history and cosmology .",
    "however , given the expected merger history for a typical milky way in , they found a dark disk with density in the range @xmath13 at the solar neighborhood ( where @xmath14 is the density of the shm ) .",
    "the lower bound @xmath15 is particularly conservative since it is produced by just one merger of large magellanic cloud mass within 20@xmath16 of the disk plane . in",
    "we expect _ two _ such low inclination mergers per milky way ( and seven in total at all inclinations ) .",
    "we may obtain an upper bound on @xmath17 from the kinematics of stars at the solar neighborhood @xcite .",
    "the latest measurements from hipparcos give a conservative upper bound of @xmath18 , including systematic errors @xcite ; with @xmath17 being @xmath19 likely . if more than half of the thick disk owes to accretion , the likely dark disk density would be near the upper limit .",
    "as such we consider @xmath20 $ ] in this paper .",
    "the disk density @xmath21 is an excess over @xmath14 , locally increasing the dark matter density .",
    "the kinematic properties of the dark disk can be estimated from the accreted stellar thick disk that forms concurrently .",
    "stellar thick disks are found in the milky way and in all well - observed spiral galaxies @xcite , while at least one _ counterrotating _ thick disk is strong evidence for an accretion origin @xcite .",
    "however , thick disks can also form through heating of an underlying thin disk @xcite , or even directly from extended gas @xcite ; indeed it is difficult in  to obtain a thick disk massive enough from accretion alone @xcite . in this paper , we assume  based on the numerical models of @xcite  that the dark disk s kinematics match the milky way s stellar thick disk . at the solar neighborhood",
    ", this gives a rotation lag @xmath22 of @xmath23 km @xmath24 with respect to the local circular velocity , and dispersions of @xmath25 km @xmath24 @xcite .",

    "improving on this assumption will involve untangling heated versus accreted components in the milky way stellar thick disk .",
    "this should become possible with future astronomical surveys like the radial velocity experiment ( rave ) @xcite and global astrometric interferometer for astrophysics @xcite that will provide full 6d phase space and chemical information for hundreds of thousands of individual stars .",
    "we emphasize that the dark disk must form in any hierarchical model of structure formation ; it is not special to our  simulations @xcite",
    ". however ,  is specific enough to predict the dark disk density with uncertainties owing only to the stochastic nature of the merging and accretion history .",
    "the dark disk is very different from dark matter streams @xcite that have a low filling factor ( we are not likely to live in a stream ) , and are stochastic _ microstructure_. by contrast , the dark disk is the expected equilibrium end state of dissolving satellites and the earth _ must _ be embedded in one ( if hierarchical formation is correct ) . like the near - spherical dark matter",

    ", we show the energy below which the dark disk dominates the rate as a function of @xmath2 , for three values of @xmath17 .",
    "the total rate in a detector is the sum of the two contributions from the shm and the dark disk , which dominate at high and low energies , respectively . for @xmath55 ,",

    "the details of the differential rate with energy , as shown in figure 4 , betray both the contribution of the dark disk relative to the shm and @xmath2 .",
    "this introduces a mass - dependend characteristic shape of the differential rate which will improve the constrains on @xmath2 upon detection .",
    "the motion of the earth around the sun gives rise to an annual modulation of the event rate and recoil energy spectrum @xcite .",
    "the annual modulation is more pronounced for the dark disk , since the relative change to the mean streaming velocity owing to the earth s motion is larger ( @xmath5719% ) compared with the shm ( @xmath576% ) .",
    "we show in figure 3 the residual integrated rates for a liquid xenon detector throughout a year , for three different @xmath2 and two values of @xmath17 .",

    "the phase ( defined at maximum rate ) of the dark disk and the shm differ because the sun s motion is slightly misaligned to the dark disk . while the phase of each component does not depend on @xmath2 , their sum does because their amplitudes depend on @xmath2 .",
    "we show this dependency in figure 5 , for three values of @xmath17 .",
    "the phase shift is determined by the relative contributions of each component .",
    "figure 3 shows that the phase shift is largest for low @xmath17 , since in this case the sum preferentially follows the halo modulation phase , while for higher @xmath17 the disk component dominates the modulation phase .",
    "this is a new effect introduced by the presence of the dark disk that allows @xmath2 to be uniquely determined from the phase of the modulation signal , for given @xmath17 .",
    "note that there is an amplitude flip for the shm that occurs as @xmath2 is increased , which is not seen for the dark disk .",
    "as @xmath2 is lowered , the  crossing energy \" at which the differential rates for minimal and maximal wimp velocity are equal shifts to lower energies . for the dark disk ,",
    "it remains close to , or below , current thresholds and so the amplitude flip is not seen .",
    "the effect of the dark disk on current upper limits on the si wimp - nucleon cross section is shown in figure 6 for cdms - ii and xenon10 @xcite .",
    "depending on @xmath17 , we exclude new regions in the allowed parameter space for @xmath55 .    on a final note , we find that including the dark disk component does not change the interpretation of the annual modulation signal observed in the dama @xcite experiment for pure si coupling . at high @xmath2 , the allowed dama region",
    "is still excluded by cdms - ii and xenon10 @xcite results , while at low @xmath2 no new parameter region opens .",

    "recoil energies of 5 - 20 kev and @xmath58 , the rate is boosted by factors up to 2.4 for ge and 3 for xe targets . comparing this with the rates at higher energy will constrain @xmath2 , particularly for @xmath59 .",
