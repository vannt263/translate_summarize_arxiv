    "our work constitutes the first approach to the photoinduced modulation of the landau level structure in single - layer graphene in presence of an intense and continuously applied laser field .",
    "however , we would like to mention that a recent work@xcite has addressed the role of intense radiation field . yet",

    "first we consider an eigenstate of the static hamiltonian that has vanishing pseudospin polarization in the static regime .",
    "next , we present the same analysis for an initially prepared coherent state , with static finite pseudospin polarization and highlight the main differences with respect to the other initial configuration . in section",
    "iv we discuss our main results and in section v we present concluding remarks and argue on the experimental implementation of our proposed theoretical setup .",

    "positive ( negative ) values of @xmath20 represents the conduction ( valence ) band at each dirac point .",
    "in addition , the integer quantum number @xmath21 labels the landau level ( ll ) structure of monolayer graphene . using the eigenstates @xmath22 of the operator @xmath23 , the corresponding eigenstates @xmath24 read @xmath25 for @xmath26 .",
    "the zero energy eigenstate ( @xmath3 ) is given in each case by @xmath27 due to time - reversal symmetry , we have @xmath28 .",
    "let us now consider the effect of intense circularly polarized terahertz electromagnetic radiation , incident perpendicularly to the sample .",
    "we assume that the beam radiation spot is large enough compared to the lattice spacing so we can neglect any spatial variation .",
    "according to the standard light - matter interaction formulation , the dynamical effects of a monochromatic radiation field incident perpendicular to the sample can be described by means of a time - dependent vector potential @xmath29 where @xmath30 and @xmath31 are respectively the amplitude and frequency of the electric field given in turn by the standard relation @xmath32 .",
    "in addition , we are using @xmath33 ( @xmath34 ) for right ( left ) circular polarization .",
    "we are using circular polarization because it has been shown to provide the maximal photoinduced bandgap@xcite .",

    "hence , defining rising @xmath47 and lowering @xmath48 pseudospin operators by the standard formulas @xmath49 the time - dependent interaction potential can be rewritten as @xmath50        now we invoke floquet s theorem which states that the time evolution operator of the system induced by a periodic hamiltonian can be written in the form@xcite @xmath51with @xmath52 a periodic unitary matrix and @xmath53 a time - independent dynamical generator referred to as the floquet hamiltonian .",

    "@xmath31 in the terahertz domain leads to @xmath68 .",
    "this value is an order of magnitude smaller than the landau level separation @xmath69 mev , for @xmath70 t. for larger frequencies and stronger magnetic field intensities , the ratio @xmath71 tends to be smaller .",

    ", a more detailed derivation by means of second order perturbation theory shows that there is a small @xmath92 energy correction due to first nondiagonal terms in equation ( [ pert1 ] ) which couple all adjacent ll .",
    "this higher order corrections could be important at low quantizing magnetic fields for which the condition @xmath93 could be satisfied .",
    "+ let us now analyze some physical consequences of the radiation field on the landau level structure of monolayer graphene with focus on the interplay among the quantizing magnetic field and the light - matter interaction . to begin with , we notice that the quasienergies are defined up to multiples of @xmath31 ; therefore , a better physical characterization of the energy spectrum for the driven system is provided by the mean energies@xcite @xmath94 which are invariant under @xmath95 , for @xmath96 being an integer . doing the explicit calculation the mean energies are found to be given by the expression @xmath97 where we remember the definition of the effective coupling to the radiation field as @xmath38 . + as can be seen in fig .",
    "1 , these mean energies are plotted as function of the quantizing magnetic field @xmath2 , for different values of the landau level index changing the effective coupling @xmath98 .",
    "we notice that , at intermediate light - coupling strength , the energy resolution of these levels becomes much better and could experimentally be tested for not so large quantizing magnetic fields @xmath2 .",
    "moreover , we find that to this order of approximation the ll become gapped , with the striking feature that the photoinduced gap is level dependent .",
    "these gap openings appear except for the @xmath91 level which , as discussed before , remains insensitive to the radiation field . +",
    "below we will deal with the photoinduced dynamical features and therefore , we give the corresponding normalized floquet eigenstates for @xmath90 @xmath99 where we have defined the coefficients @xmath100 with @xmath101 .",
    "in addition , the zero energy eigenstate ( @xmath91 ) is still given by @xmath102 , i. e. , @xmath103",
    "now that we have found the approximate floquet eigenstates and quasienergies , we explore other dynamical features of the driven ll configuration by evaluating the mean values of the pseudospin polarization operator and its relation to the autocorrelation function dynamics@xcite .    for this purpose ,",
    "let us first assume that the system is initially prepared in an eigenstate of the hamiltonian @xmath57 @xmath104 ) , the initial state is written as @xmath105    taking into account that the @xmath106 states are degenerate eigenstates of @xmath107 , the unitary operator @xmath108 would just contribute a phase @xmath109 . using the hamiltonian ( [ hfin ] ) the evolved state can be written as @xmath110 where we have introduced the time - dependent coefficients @xmath111 .",
    "let us then consider the dynamics for the autocorrelation function and pseudospin polarization @xmath112 operators from which we can respectively infer the feasibility of manipulating the polarization state of the sample and the dipole moment radiation emmited by the driven sample .",
    "it is important to remark at this point that studying the out of plane pseudospin polarization is a means of detecting the angular momentum exchange between the dirac fermions in graphene and the circularly polarized radiation field , as can be inferred from the discussion in the recent literature about the role of @xmath113 in describing the total angular momentum content of the system@xcite .",
    "+ with these ideas in mind , we first begin by evaluating the pseudospin polarization @xmath114 for the chosen initial state we find @xmath115 .",
    "when expression ( [ szt ] ) is evaluated we find after some algebraic manipulations @xmath116 we note that for vanishing values of the coupling to the radiation field @xmath117 one has @xmath115 .",
    "therefore , once the electromagnetic field is present the pseudospin oscillations are a manifestation of the angular momentum exchange among the radiation field and the charge carriers in graphene @xcite .",
    "as discussed in the case of the quasienergies , we could better quantify the effects of the driving field by evaluating the average @xmath118 with the period of the radiation field given as @xmath41 .",
    "then we get the expression @xmath119 with @xmath120 .",
    "+ in figure fig .",
    "[ fig : figure2 ] we plot the behavior of @xmath121 as a function of the coupling strength @xmath98 . at small @xmath122",
    "we see that the closer the state is to the @xmath91 ll the role of the radiation field in modifying its pseudospin polarization is less relevant and this is correlated to the fact that , within this regime , the gap openings seen in the mean quasienergy spectrum are not so noticeable at different values of the @xmath123 ll index .",
    "in addition , at large values of the quantizing field , @xmath124 , the value of the pseudospin polarization is almost the same at each value of the @xmath123 ll index .",
    "however , we see in the second upper panel that already at intermediate values of the relative coupling strentgh @xmath125 that at large values of the quantizing field @xmath126 t one can discern among the different ll polarization value which serves to separate each level contribution to this quantity dynamical behavior . in the lower two panels",
    "we show that this physical picture becomes more obvious at larger values of @xmath98 , with perfect separation for the contribution from the @xmath127 and @xmath128 , levels .",
    "yet , the corresponding @xmath129 and @xmath130 contributions to the pseudospin polarization remain degenerate at large @xmath2 values",
    ". one would expect that this accidental crossings seen as a degeneracy would be removed by including higher order perturbative contributions , since then the coupling among nearby levels would lead to additional splittings in the quasienergy spectrum that would in turn also lift this accidental pseudospin degeneracy .    in order to discuss more general dynamical features",
    ", one should consider a superposition state .",
    "however , in order to do so we must take into account the feasibility of experimentally realizing such a superposition state . a paradigmatic case of such interesting superposition states is given by the coherent state which are minimal uncertainty wave packets relevant for studying the classical states of the radiation field in the sense of being a classical counterpart of the quantum harmonic oscillator",
    "since , as in the quantum harmonic oscillator , the landau levels in graphene are eigenstates of the number operator , one should expect that these coherent state superpositions would be interesting .",
    "indeed , there has been recently some proposals to analyze the dynamics of coherent electronic states in graphene nanomechanical resonators @xcite . by taking advantage of the intrinsic non linear nature of flexural modes in graphene , the authors of reference @xcite",
    "show that cat - like@xcite states can be generated .",
    "we follow a different physical approach . instead of resorting to nonlinearities of flexural modes",
    "we invoke the light - matter coupling as a mechanism for studying the evolution of an initially prepared coherent superposition state built from the landau level eigenstates described in section ii and evaluate the induced pseudospin polarization effects in order to contrast to the results shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : figure2 ] .        formally speaking",
    ", the coherent state @xmath131 is defined by means of the eigenvalue equation    @xmath132    where @xmath133 . using the expansion    @xmath134    with @xmath135 representing a summation for all @xmath136 .",
    "assuming , without loss of generality , the symmetric scenario @xmath137 , one finds that the coherent state is given as @xmath138 which can be shown to be normalized .",
    "if we now evaluate the mean value of the hermitian operator @xmath139 in the coherent state and use the definition given in equation ( [ dqla ] ) , we get @xmath140 . in addition , if we use the coherent state to evaluate the average of the number operator @xmath55 defined in equation ( [ excitations ] ) , it is not difficult to show that we also get @xmath141 . therefore , the coherent state parameter amplitude @xmath142 is a measure of the mean number of landau levels that are excited and corresponds to the mean photon number in the context of quantum optics .",
    "thus , we will use it as a control parameter to discuss the properties of the physical quantities as follows .    in this case",
    ", we find for the pseudospin polarization @xmath143        this is plotted in fig .",
    "3 for @xmath122 and four representative values of @xmath142 . in this figure",
    "we notice that for small values of @xmath142 the dynamics of the pseudospin polarization resembles the pattern for rabi oscillations since the main contributions would arise for the interference among the zero and first ll . yet",
    ", no polarization inversion can be achieved within this regime .",
    "however , once @xmath144 the contribution from other ll states becomes increasingly important to the interference pattern and the former rabi oscillations become distorted .",
    "moreover , at this value of @xmath142 , one can achieve the polarization inversion for large enough values of time in the long - term evolution . in the lower panels of fig .",
    "4 we find that for larger values ( @xmath145 and @xmath146 ) , we get a beating pattern showing a dynamical localization effect that is directly related to a collective behavior of the driven charge carries in graphene .",
    "we would like to remark that the problem of the population inversion has already been studied long time ago by eberly et al@xcite .",
    "their model corresponds to a two - level system coupled to a single mode radiation field ( jaynes cummings hamiltonian ) . in our approach , this in turn is given by the static graphene hamiltonian for landau levels written in equation ( 2 ) .",
    "a larger value of the coherent state parameter @xmath142 would imply larger mean landau level occupation , and thus the second term in the numerator of the pseudospin polarization given in expression ( 43 ) would have a larger influence in the pseudospin inversion since larger n landau levels would be occupied which will contribute a higher weight in the pseudospin polarization ( see numerator in equation ( 20 ) . moreover , since the effective light - matter coupling strength @xmath98 also affects the phase , as given by the cosine term in equation ( 20 ) of the polarization , this interesting interplay forbids the inversion which is also a signature of the localization and beating effects shown on panels 3(c ) and 3(d ) and our results extend those found in the context of reference@xcite .",
    "this physical picture for the coherent state dynamics can be complemented by studying the autocorrelation function @xmath147 , which is found to be given as @xmath148 the autocorrelation function provides additional physical information of the system since its fourier transform is related to the local density of states@xcite .",
    "its time evolution is plotted in fig .",
    "4 choosing again an effective coupling strength value of @xmath122 and the same values of @xmath149 as in fig .",
    "3 showing the dynamical behavior of the pseudospin polarization . comparing fig.3 and fig .",
    "4 we see that partial revivals for the autocorrelation function are correlated to the beating or localization behavior of the pseudospin polarization . therefore , one could indirectly gain information on the pseudospin dynamics by measuring the time revivals @xcite which means detecting those times for which the wave packet reconstructs itself .        in order to show explicitly the role of the driving field we have plotted in fig .",
    "5 the static autocorrelation function . comparing the lower right panels in fig . 4 and fig . 5",
    ", we find that the radiation field induces additional revivals in accordance to the beating pattern in the pseudospin oscillation , as seen in fig.3 .",
    "we have shown that the radiadion field leads to a quasienergy spectrum with a level dependent gap , except for the @xmath91 ll which , to leading order , remains insensitive to the radiation field effects .",
    "in addition , we have found that a finite out of plane pseudospin polarization value can arise for initial states that possess either a finite or vanishing initial value of @xmath113 . as we saw at the beginning of section ( [ sec1 ] ) in presence of the radiation field ,",
    "the total out of plane angular momentum component @xmath150 of the electrons is no longer a constant of motion .",
    "therefore , the pseudospin oscillations are due to the angular momentum exchange among the driving field and the charge carriers in single layer graphene . for the coherent state a beating pattern emerges in the pseudospin polarization . in spite of the fact that the interaction is dictated by a periodic hamiltonian",
    "we find that the dominant or characteristic time scale for this collective behavior is the cyclotron frequency",
    ". we could expect this behavior of the wave packet at large values of @xmath142 as a measure of the classical behavior associated to the cyclotron problem but now realized with dirac fermions in the ll quantized regime as was discussed by one of the authors in reference@xcite .",
    "we must remark that in order to be able to detect the reported effects an ensemble of coherent states should be prepared each time , because the measurement process destroys the state .",
    "it should also be remembered that the coherent state parameter @xmath142 is determined by choosing appropiate values for the mean values of position and momentum in accordance to the following prescription @xmath151 another point to be highlighted is that for standard two dimensional electron gases the coherent state built from the landau levels would remain coherent , i.e. , it will evolve in time in such a manner that it would just oscillate in time around the prescribed mean values given in eqs .",
    "( [ x ] ) and ( [ p ] ) .",
    "more precisely , its wigner function representation in phase space will oscillate in time without deformation .",
    "this is known to be a consequence of the fact that the dependence with the @xmath152 quantum number is linear . yet , in graphene we have a @xmath153 and this in turn prevents the coherent state to evolve in such a coherent manner .",
    "therefore , the spreading of the wave packet and the corresponding appearance of the additional revival times at shorter time values is a direct consequence of the driving field that even at low coupling can induce interesting dynamical behavior as shown in fig . 3 and fig .",
    "4 . we supported this last statement by evaluating the static ( @xmath154 ) autocorrelation function as shown in fig .",
    "5 and found that the second packet reconstruction ( see lower panel for @xmath146 in fig .",
    "4 ) around @xmath155 is absent in the static regime .",
    "we would also like to comment that graphene subject to electromagnetic radiation without quantizing magnetic field has been discussed in several papers @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that for zero momentum ( k=0 ) , the dynamical equation is exactly solvable and leads to a photoinduced ( zero quantizing magnetic field ) mass term that has opposite signs at the two valleys . yet , at finite momentum the dynamics is no longer exactly solvable and one has to resort to numerical analysis by means of an infinite expansion in fourier modes .",
    "this is why we consider our results to be a valuable tool in analytically describing the photoinduced pseudospin effects in the landau level structure of monolayer graphene .",
    "we now briefly mention that our values of quantizing magnetic fields are within experimentally accesible orders .",
    "for instance , in the pioneering paper by novoselov et al . in reference",
    "@xcite , the authors used a value of quantizing magnetic field @xmath156 t to study the quantum hall effect in graphene .",
    "moreover , in a following classical paper , their results were extended up to values of @xmath157 t and even @xmath158 t for the quantizing magnetic field@xcite .",
    "here it is shown that at these values of magnetic field , the quantum hall effect in graphene could be observed at room temperature that constitutes a breakthrough in the physics of quantum hall phases .",
    "we have analyzed the dynamical modulation of physical quantities for dirac fermions within the landau level quantized regime of single layer graphene subject to intense circularly polarized terahertz radiation . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "this is the first analysis of the photoinduced manipulation of the ll structure in single - layer graphene subject to a continuously applied intense laser field instead of a pulsed one . by means of a perturbative analytical treatment we found very interesting physical features such as a non trivial level dependent dynamically induced gap structure .",
    "due to the angular momentum exchange among the radiation field and the charge carriers , it also leads to modulation of the oscillations in the dynamics of the out of plane pseudospin polarization , even for superposition states with an initially vanishing pseudospin value .",
    "we also found that localization effects in the time evolution of the pseudospin polarization can be keep track of by measuring the revival times of a wave packet initially prepared as a coherent state .",
    "the reported photoinduced gap modulation and pseudospin oscillations could be detected through the reemitted dipolar radiation from the oscillating charge carriers as it was proposed in reference@xcite .",
    "+ we would also like to mention that for values of @xmath159 , one enters the so called ultrastrong coupling limit in the context of cavity quantum electrodynamics experiments . within this parameter regime",
    ", it has been experimentally shown in reference @xcite that explicit anti - crossings appear in the energy spectrum .",
    "this in turn corresponds to a breakdown of the jaynes cummings approximation that describes resonant processes in the two - level problem coupled to a single mode radiation field .",
    "our exact floquet hamiltonian given in equation ( 20 ) allows us to explore this ultrastrong coupling regime beyond the perturbative results presented and could be the subject of future work where one would expect non linear effects to be relevant in the graphene physics .",
    "for instance , as we already argued in the discussion section , one could expect that the accidental degeneracies seen in the panels of fig .",
    "2 , at large values of the quantizing magnetic field , would be lifted by a stronger coupling to the radiation field .",
    "finally , we would like to mention that although we perform our analysis for neutral undoped graphene . yet , in the graphene literature the role of doping has been given special attention since it might either modify the effective fermi velocity of dirac fermions@xcite .",
    "the first work@xcite shows that the energy spectrum near the charge neutrality point is non linear and no gap is found at energies even as close to the dirac point as @xmath160  mev . on the other hand ,",
    "the authors of paper @xcite show that that electron interactions leave the graphene energy dispersion linear as a function of excitation energy even for energies within @xmath161  mev of the fermi energy .",
    "yet , it has recently been shown that doping effects might also lead to a bandgap opening in the graphene spectrum ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "in particular , the authors of the work@xcite have discussed the tunability of the bandgap energy in single - layer graphene due to manganese oxide nanoparticles by means of an electrochemical method @xcite .",
    "this work reports a maximum value for the induced energy bandgap of @xmath162 ev .",
    "although they do not discuss the quantized ll regime , we could incorporate these doping effects in our model by including a phenomenological diagonal term in the landau level hamiltonian given in equations ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) .",
    "this mass - term would in turn be proportional to @xmath113 and the valley index @xmath163 , as required by time reversal invariance .",
    "thus , one would expect an interesting interplay between the photoinduced gap openings and the static bandgap determined by doping effects .",
    "yet , we considered undoped graphene in order to highlight the photoinduced ll dependent bandgap discussed above .",
    "concerning the actual experimental observation of our predicted results , we consider that these could motive the exploration of larger intensities for the radiation field as given in the experimental setup in reference @xcite when their model enters the landau level regime . in this sense , we consider that our work would contribute to explore a new physical scenario within realistic parameter values to discuss the pseudospin physics in graphene , also taking into account the role of zitterbewegung as it is discussed in reference@xcite , extending their results to initially prepared coherent states when the radiation field is a monochromatic continuous laser field instead of a pulsed laser .",

    "<S> we present perturbative analytical results of the landau level quasienergy spectrum , autocorrelation function and out of plane pseudospin polarization for a single graphene sheet subject to intense circularly polarized terahertz radiation . for the quasienergy spectrum </S>",
    "<S> , we find a striking non trivial level - dependent dynamically induced gap structure . </S>",
    "<S> this photoinduced modulation of the energy band structure gives rise to shifts of the revival times in the autocorrelation function and it also leads to modulation of the oscillations in the dynamical evolution of the out of plane pseudospin polarization , which measures the angular momentum transfer between light and graphene electrons . for a coherent state , chosen as an initial pseudospin configuration , </S>",
    "<S> the dynamics induces additional quantum revivals of the wave function that manifest as shifts of the maxima and minima of the autocorrelation function , with additional partial revivals and beating patterns . </S>",
    "<S> these additional maxima and beating patterns stem from the effective dynamical coupling of the static eigenstates . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss the possible experimental detection schemes of our theoretical results and their relevance in new practical implementation of radiation fields in graphene physics . </S>"
