    "observations of a pulsar closely orbiting sgr  a * , the supermassive black hole at the galactic center ( gc ) , could provide a variety of important information about the pulsar itself , the black hole , the interstellar medium around the gc and , if close enough , relativistic orbital dynamics .",
    "but , experience has shown that radio searches for pulsars near the gc are really challenging .",
    "many searches have been made @xcite but no pulsars were discovered within a few arcmin of sgr  a*. the closest separations between pulsars discovered by these projects and sgr a * are about 10 - 15 arcmin .",
    "psr  j1745@xmath02900 , which was serendipitously discovered , is the only pulsar known within a few arcmin from sgr  a*. it was first detected as an x - ray flare thought to be from sgr a * by swift @xcite .",
    "follow - up observations with the nustar x - ray observatory detected periodic intensity variations with a period of 3.76  s @xcite .",
    "it is confirmed as a magnetar by subsequent x - ray timing observations with nustar and swift @xcite . unlike ordinary pulsars , most of which",
    "can only be detected in the radio band , very few magnetars have been confirmed with radio pulsations .",
    "of the 28 magnetars and candidates previously known , only three of them have detectable radio pulsations @xcite .",
    "the radio pulsations from psr j1745@xmath02900 were detected by several large radio telescopes , which makes it the fourth magnetar known with radio pulsations ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "astrometry measurements for psr  j1745@xmath02900 with the vlba indicate that its projected separation from sgr  a * is as small as 0.097  pc @xcite , giving it the potential to contribute to the important studies mentioned above .",
    "psr  j1745@xmath02900 shows a flat radio spectrum and a high degree of polarized emission , according to observations at frequencies ranging from 1.4 to 20  ghz . the derived dispersion measure ( dm ) is @xmath3  @xmath4 @xcite , which makes it the highest - dm pulsar known .",
    "the faraday rotation measure ( rm ) of this pulsar is @xmath5  rad m@xmath6 .",
    "this implies that the magnetic field strength is about 2.6  mg at the radius of 0.12  pc from sgr  a * , which is dynamically important for the accretion of the black hole @xcite .",
    "the scatter - broadening time scale at 1  ghz and the scatter - broadening spectral index fitted with multi - frequency observations are @xmath7  s and @xmath8 respectively @xcite .",
    "this timescale is several orders of magnitude lower than the prediction of the ne2001 model @xcite .",
    "judging from this result , scattering effects are not the main reason for lack of pulsar detections around sgr  a*. the intrinsic deficit in the ordinary pulsar population in this area is proposed to be the most likely reason for this @xcite .",
    "eight months of 8.7  ghz observations of psr  j1745@xmath02900 with the green bank telescope ( gbt ) between mjds 56515 and 56845 @xcite identified two main periods of activity .",
    "the first is characterized by approximately 5.5 months ( up to mjd  56726 ) of relatively stable evolution in radio flux density , rotation and profile shape , while in the second period these properties became highly variable .",
    "the gbt observations gave a single - pulse energy distribution that roughly follows a log - normal distribution with an apparent high - energy tail .",
    "subpulse drifting was not found in their observations .",
    "no sustained enhancement of the x - ray emission at the gc was detected by the swift on mjd  56910 @xcite .",
    "but , at present it is not clear that this x - ray enhancement is related to psr  j1745@xmath02900 or sgr  a*.    in this paper , we present the results of 8.6  ghz observations that were carried out with the shanghai tian ma radio telescope ( tmrt ) . the observation and data reduction procedures are presented in  [ sec : obs ] . in ",
    "[ sec : intprf ] and  [ sec : single ] we discuss the integrated profile and single - pulse properties , respectively , and give further discussion about the results in  [ sec : concl ] .",
    "the tmrt is a new 65  m diameter fully - steerable radio telescope located in the western suburbs of shanghai , china .",
    "the first phase of construction was finished in december 2013 .",
    "four cryogenically cooled receivers covering the frequency ranges 1.25  1.75  ghz , 2.2  2.4  ghz , 4.0  8.0  ghz and 8.2  9.0  ghz , respectively , are available .",
    "the highest frequency of the tmrt will be 43  ghz .",
    "the telescope has an active surface control to compensate for gravity deformation of the main reflector during tracking .",
    "the digital backend system ( dibas ) of tmrt is an fpga - based spectrometer based upon the design of versatile gbt astronomical spectrometer ( vegas ) with pulsar modes that provide much the same capabilities as green bank ultimate pulsar processing instrument ( guppi ) @xcite . for pulsar observations",
    ", dibas supports both pulsar searching and on - line folding mode .",
    "both coherent and incoherent dedispersion observation modes are supported . for the incoherent dedispersion observation mode ,",
    "the bandwidth of each of digitizer channel is up to 2  ghz . since three pairs of digitizer ( one digitizer for each polarization )",
    "are currently available , a maximum bandwidth of 6  ghz can be supported . for the coherent dedispersion observation mode",
    "the maximum bandwidth is 1  ghz , limited by the computing power of the current high - performance computer cluster .",
    "dibas supports full stokes - parameter pulsar observations which are written out in 8-bit psrfits format @xcite . in order to reduce the data rate in pulsar searching observations",
    ", the observer can also choose to record stokes - parameter i ( total intensity ) only , which is obtained by summing the two polarization channels after digitisation .",
    "observations of psr  j1745@xmath02900 were performed with the tmrt in 2014 , june to october using the incoherent pulsar searching observation mode .",
    "the frequency range of our observations was 8.2  9.0  ghz .",
    "the full bandwidth was divided into 512 channels to allow off - line dedispersion . even though the dm of psr  j1745@xmath02900 is 1778  @xmath9  pc , at this high frequency , 512 channels are sufficient , giving a time delay in each channel of only @xmath2  46.9 microsecond .",
    "the sampling interval was 131.07 microseconds .",
    "the exact observing dates were 2014 june 28 , 2014 july 24 , 2014 aug . 4 , 2014 sept . 11 ,",
    "2014 sept .",
    "12 and 2014 oct . 13 , corresponding to mjds of 56836 , 56862 , 56873 , 56911 , 56912 and 56943 , respectively .",
    "the data recording times for the six sessions were 120 , 40 , 25 , 26 , 60 and 90 min , respectively .",
    "the first two epochs of observation presented here occurred prior to the last epoch reported in @xcite .",
    "the digital signal processing for pulsars ( dspsr ) program @xcite was used to dedisperse and fold the data at the known topocentric period using polynomial coefficients generated with tempo2 in its prediction mode @xcite .",
    "the profile data were written out with 1024 phase bins per period in psrfits format .",
    "the pulse broadening caused by interstellar scattering is about 3.7 millisecond at 8.6  ghz @xcite and so it is reasonable to use 1024 phase bins across the 3.76  s pulse period .",
    "psrchive programs @xcite were used to do further data editing and processing .    at the time of observation , the diode that injects",
    "pulsed signals into the front - end of the receiver had not been installed , so we could not use the normal procedure to do the flux density calibration .",
    "previous studies have shown that the flux density of pulsars is in general intrinsically stable over several years .",
    "most pulsars are in the weak scattering regime at 8.6  ghz @xcite and so it is reasonable to use other normal pulsars as calibrators to estimate the flux density of psr  j1745@xmath02900 .",
    "the pulsars chosen as the flux density calibrators were observed on the same day with psr  j1745@xmath02900 using the same setups .",
    "there were no input power adjustments between observations of calibrators and psr  j1745@xmath02900 .",
    "on mjd  56836 , we observed five normal pulsars with known flux density at 8.35  ghz with same setup as for psr  j1745@xmath02900 .",
    "table  [ tab : fluxpsr ] lists these pulsars and gives their 8.35  ghz flux density measured at effelsberg @xcite , radio spectral index @xcite , estimated flux density at 8.6  ghz , the flux density in arbitrary units measured with the tmrt , the average elevation angle of the tmrt during the observation , the length of the observation and the scaling factor to convert from tmrt units to mjy . using the scaling factor of the five normal pulsars , we obtain the weighted average scaling factor and corresponding standard deviation .",
    "these are used to convert the measured flux density of psr  j1745@xmath02900 into mjy units .",
    "the effect of possible variations in the flux of the known pulsars is negligible because of the stable intrinsic flux density of calibrator pulsars , weak interstellar scattering at the band of observation and the averaging effect of using multiple calibrators .",
    "therefore , we only use the standard deviation of scaling factor to quantify the flux uncertainties of psr  j1745@xmath02900 .    [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]",
