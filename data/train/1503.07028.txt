    "a tsunami is popularly an elevation of the sea level due to an earthquake .",
    "however , tsunamis induced by seismic sources represent only 80 % of the tsunamis .",
    "6% are due to landslides and 3% to meteorological effects ( see the book of b. levin and m. nosov @xcite ) .",
    "big traveling storms for instance can give energy to the sea and lead to an elevation of the surface . in some cases ,",
    "this amplification is important and this phenomenon is called the proudman resonance in the physics literature .",
    "similarly , submarine landslides can significantly increase the level of the sea and we talk about landslide tsunamis . in this paper",
    ", we study mathematically these two phenomena .",
    "we model the sea by an irrotational and incompressible ideal fluid bounded from below by the seabed and from above by a free surface .",
    "we suppose that the seabed and the surface are graphs above the still water level .",
    "we model an underwater landslide by a moving seabed ( moving bottom ) and the meteorological effects by a non constant pressure at the surface ( air - pressure disturbance ) .",
    "therefore , we suppose that @xmath0 , where @xmath1 represents a fixed bottom and @xmath2 the variation of the bottom because of the landslide . similarly , the pressure at the surface is of the form @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is a constant which represents the pressure far from the meteorological disturbance , and @xmath5 models the meteorological disturbance ( we assume that the pressure at the surface is known ) .",
    "we denote by @xmath6 the horizontal dimension , which is equal to @xmath7 or @xmath8 .",
    "@xmath9 stands for the horizontal variable and @xmath10 is the vertical variable .",
    "@xmath11 is the typical water depth .",
    "the water occupies a moving domain @xmath12 .",
    "the water is homogeneous ( constant density @xmath13 ) , inviscid , irrotational with no surface tension .",
    "we denote by @xmath14 the velocity and @xmath15 the velocity potential .",
    "we have @xmath16 .",
    "the law governing the irrotational fluids is the bernoulli law    @xmath17    where @xmath18 is the pressure in the fluid domain .",
    "changing @xmath15 if necessary , it is possible to assume that @xmath19 .",
    "furthermore , the incompressibility of the fluid implies that    @xmath20    we suppose also that the fluid particles do not cross the bottom or the surface .",
    "we denote by * n * the unit normal vector , pointing upward and @xmath21 the upward normal derivative .",
    "then , the boundary conditions are    @xmath22    and    @xmath23    in 1968 , v. e. zakharov ( see @xcite ) showed that the water waves problem is a hamiltonian system and that @xmath24 , the trace of the velocity potential at the surface ( @xmath25 ) , and the surface @xmath26 are canonical variables .",
    "then , w. craig , c. sulem and p.l .",
    "sulem ( see @xcite and @xcite ) formulate this remark into a system of two non local equations .",
    "we follow their construction to formulate our problem .",
    "using the fact that @xmath15 satisfies and , we can characterize @xmath15 thanks to @xmath26 and @xmath25    @xmath27    we decompose this equation in two parts , the surface contribution and the bottom contribution    @xmath28    such that    @xmath29    and    @xmath30    in the purpose of expressing with @xmath26 and @xmath24 , we introduce two operators .",
    "the first one is the dirichlet - neumann operator    @xmath31 : \\psi \\mapsto \\sqrt{1+|\\nabla \\zeta|^{2 } } \\partial_{\\textbf{n } } \\phi^{s}_{\\;\\ ; |z=\\zeta},\\ ] ]    where @xmath32 satisfies .",
    "the second one is the neumann - neumann operator    @xmath33 : \\partial_{t } b \\mapsto \\sqrt{1+|\\nabla \\zeta|^{2 } } \\partial_{\\textbf{n } } \\phi^{b}_{\\;\\ ; |z=\\zeta},\\ ] ]    where @xmath34 satisfies .",

    "then , we take the trace at the surface of ( since there is no surface tension we have @xmath41 ) and we obtain a system of two scalar equations that reduces to the standard zakharov / craig - sulem formulation when @xmath42 and @xmath43 ,    @xmath44(\\psi ) =   g^{n \\ !",

    "the wellposedness of the water waves problem with a constant pressure and a fixed bottom was studied by many people .",
    "s. wu proved it in the case of an infinite depth without nondimensionalization ( @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "then , d. lannes treated the case of a finite bottom without nondimensionalization ( @xcite ) , t. iguchi proved a local wellposedness result for @xmath47 small enough in order to justify shallow water approximations for water waves ( @xcite ) , and d. lannes and b. alvarez - samaniego showed , in the case of the nondimensionalized equations , that we can find an existence time @xmath48 where @xmath49 does not depend on @xmath45 , @xmath46 and @xmath47 ( @xcite ) .",
    "more recently , b. msognon - gireau improved the result of d. lannes and b. alvarez - samaniego and proved that if we add enough surface tension we can find an existence time @xmath50 where @xmath49 does not depend on @xmath45 and @xmath47 ( @xcite ) .",
    "t. iguchi studied the case of a moving bottom in order to justify asymptotic models for tsunamis ( @xcite ) .",
    "finally , t. alazard , n. burq and c. zuily study the optimal regularity for the initial data ( @xcite ) and more recently , t. alazard , p. baldi and d. han - kwan show that a well - chosen non constant external pressure can create any small amplitude two - dimensional gravity - capillary water waves ( @xcite ) .",
    "we organize this paper in two part .",
    "firstly in section [ local existence of the water waves equations ] , we prove two local existence theorems for the water waves problem with a moving bottom and a non constant pressure at the surface by differentiating and `` quasilinearizing '' the water waves equations and we pay attention to the dependence of the time of existence and the size of the solution with respect to the parameters @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath51 and @xmath47 .",
    "this theorem extends the result of t. iguchi ( @xcite ) and d. lannes ( chapter 4 in @xcite ) .",
    "we also prove that the water waves problem can be viewed as a hamiltonian system . secondly in section [ asymptotic models ]",
    ", we justify some linear asymptotic models and study the proudman resonance .",
    "first , in section [ a shallow water model with small topography variations ] we study the case of small topography variations in shallow waters , approximation used in the physics literature to investigate the proudman resonance ; then in section [ a shallow water model with a variable topography ] we derive a model when the topography is not small in the shallow water approximation ; and in section [ linear asymptotic and resonance in intermediate depths ] we study the linear water waves equations in order to extend the proudman resonance in deep water with a small fixed topography .",
    "finally , appendix [ laplace_problem ] contains results about the elliptic problem and appendix [ the dirichlet - neumann and the neumann - neumann operators ] contains results about the dirichlet - neumann and the neumann - neumann operators .",
    "appendix [ estimates ] comprises standard estimates that we use in this paper .",
    "a good framework for the velocity in the euler equations is the sobolev spaces @xmath52 .",
    "but we do not work with @xmath14 but with @xmath24 the trace of @xmath15 , and @xmath53 .",
    "it will be too restrictive to take @xmath24 in a sobolev space .",
    "a good idea is to work with the beppo levi spaces ( see @xcite ) . for @xmath54 ,",

    "contrary to @xcite and @xcite , we exhibit the nonlinearities of the water waves equations in order to obtain a better existence time .      in this part",
    ", we present a nondimensionalized version of the water waves equations . in order to derive some asymptotic models to the water waves equations we introduce some dimensionless parameters linked to the physical scales of the system .",
    "the first one is the ratio between the typical free surface amplitude @xmath78 and the water depth @xmath11 .",
    "we define @xmath79 , called the nonlinearity parameter .",
    "the second one is the ratio between @xmath11 and the characteristic horizontal scale @xmath80 .",

    "we also nondimensionalize the variables and the unknowns .",
    "we introduce    @xmath85    where    @xmath86    it is worth noting that the nondimensionalization of @xmath32 , @xmath24 and @xmath87 comes from the linear wave theory ( in shallow water regime , the characteristic speed is @xmath88 ) .",
    "see paragraph * 1.3.2 * in @xcite .",
