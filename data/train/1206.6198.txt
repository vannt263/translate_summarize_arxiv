    "@xcite ; and @xcite have suggested the division of gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) into two categories , either short or long , according to their duration ( at @xmath02s ) .",
    "many observations demonstrate different properties of short and long bursts .",
    "they have different redshift distributions @xcite and may have different celestial distributions @xcite . at present",
    "there is a predominant opinion that they are physically different phenomena @xcite .",
    "there are also statistical indications of a third ,  intermediate \" , group .",
    "the division of grbs into three groups has been studied statistically over different databases : batse @xcite ; bepposax @xcite ; swift @xcite and rhessi @xcite .",
    "these three groups may also have different celestial distributions @xcite ; at least for the batse database .",
    "no test has given a statistically significant support for the existence of four or more groups .",
    "only the batse database gave a weak 6.2% significance level for such a possibility @xcite .",
    "one can not exclude an eventuality that the separation of this third group is simply a selection effect @xcite .",
    "in other words , a separation from the statistical point of view does not necessarily also indicate astrophysically different phenomena . in principle",
    ", it is still possible that the class of the intermediate grbs constitutes a  tail \" of either the short or the long group .",
    "the article by @xcite claims that - at least for the swift database @xcite - the third group is related to the so - called x - ray flashes ( xrfs ) , which need not be physically distinct phenomena @xcite . two models of xrfs are favored ; either they are ordinary long grbs viewed slightly off - axis @xcite or they are intrinsically soft long - duration grbs @xcite . hence",
    ", at least in the swift database , the problem of the intermediate class seems to have been solved .",
    "however , for three reasons the situation has not yet been clarified .",
    "first , with regard to the swift database , another study suggests that even the short group should be further separated @xcite .",
    "secondly , there is additional observational evidence against the simple scheme that maintains the existence of _ only _ two types of bursts ( short / hard and long / soft ) separated at duration of @xmath02s .",
    "the grb060614 event , which is clearly long at duration ( @xmath1100s ) but in any other properties resembles a short grb , and subsequent short bursts with soft extended emission yet challenged this scheme @xcite . to avoid the limitations of a short - long separation terminology , the designations",
    " type i \" and  type ii \" have been proposed @xcite because duration alone is hardly sufficient for a correct division into categories .",
    "thirdly , it remains possible that in other databases the discovered intermediate group is not represented by xrfs . concerning this third reason",
    ", the mean duration of the intermediate group appears to vary according to the database in which it is found . for the swift data @xcite the mean duration is @xmath012s , which resembles the durations of the long grbs , but for the rhessi and batse data",
    "@xcite this mean is far below 10s .",
    "it is clear that any new result in the classification scheme of grb groups is desirable . in this article",
    "we study the rhessi database , where in addition to @xcite , the spectral lags and peak - counts are also included .",
    "we have two concrete aims here : first , to provide further statistical tests concerning the grb classes and , second , to provide additional information concerning the physical significance of the rhessi intermediate group found by @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec : sample ] the rhessi satellite and its grb data sample are described . in sec .",
    "[ sec : ks ] distributions of spectral lags , normalized lags , and peak - count rates are studied using kolmogorov - smirnov and anderson - darling tests along with monte carlo simulations . in sec .",
    "[ sec : dis ] we discuss results of these tests , compare the results with the batse and swift data samples , and discuss the number of grb groups using model - based and k - means clustering methods .",
    "[ sec : sum ] summarizes results of this paper .",
    "the ramaty high energy solar spectroscopic imager@xmath2 ( rhessi ) is a satellite designed for the observation of hard x - rays and gamma - rays from solar flares @xcite , but it is also able to detect grbs .",
    "there is no automatic search routine for grbs , and only if a message from any other instruments of the international planetary network ( ipn ) occurs , the rhessi data are searched for a grb signal .",
    "therefore , our data set includes only events confirmed by other satellites .    in this paper",
    "we study the same list of bursts which has been published in @xcite .",
    "we consider 427 grbs from period between february 14 , 2002 and april 25 , 2008 .",
    "contrary to @xcite , the spectral lags and the peak - counts - calculated for the first time for rhessi - next to the durations and hardnesses , are used .",
    "they are collected , together with their uncertainties , in table  [ tab : database ] .",
    "these new observational data allow further study of the questions concerning the grb classification .",
    "there are two arguments for the choice of the same list of bursts .",
    "first , both in @xcite and in the present work , similar statistical studies are performed .",
    "hence , for comparison , it is reasonable to study the structure of groups found in the rhessi database over the same set .",
    "the second argument concerns an instrumental effect .",
    "the measurements of the hardness ratio of the events during the year 2008 and later has been systematically affected by an  annealing \" procedure executed on the rhessi detectors at late 2007 @xcite .",
    "the reason why the rhessi team decided to anneal the detectors was to recover its deteriorating spectral sensitivity .",
    "however , the sensitivity at low energies had not been recovered as well as at high energies and hence the measured grb hardness ratios from the post - annealing period are systematically shifted to higher values @xcite . in order to be eliminate this instrumental influence a more sophisticated modeling would be required . however",
    ", this is beyond the scope of this article .    in order to compare the spectral lags and the peak - counts of bursts belonging to the different groups",
    ", one must provide a rule by which the particular grbs are sorted into the concrete groups .",
    "we proceeded in the following manner : the probability density function employed in the fitting of the duration - hardness plane in @xcite is composed through the summation of three bivariate log - normal functions @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the base 10 logarithm of the duration and @xmath5 is the base 10 logarithm of the hardness ratio , and @xmath6 , @xmath7 , and @xmath8 are components corresponding to the particular groups .",
    "a burst at the point @xmath9 $ ] is considered short , intermediate or long depending on whether the @xmath10 , @xmath11 or @xmath12 is maximal .",
    "in essence , we follow a procedure identical to the that of @xcite and @xcite utilized on the batse and swift datasets .    in order to sort the given grbs into the groups we employ the measurements of the durations and hardness ratios as given in table  7 of @xcite with the exception of six events .",
    "we found that for these six events the mentioned values in @xcite were not corrected for a so - called decimation , which is an instrumental mode used to conserve the onboard memory .",
    "table  [ tab : dec - corr ] presents these six events , now corrected for this decimation .",
    "the group members used in this study were determined from the best maximum likelihood ( ml ) fit @xcite in the duration - hardness plane of 427 grbs . in this sample the six events with corrected decimation were included along with the remaining 421 events taken from @xcite .",
    "the best ml fit with two bivariate lognormal components gives logarithmic likelihood @xmath13 .",
    "best fit with three components gives logarithmic likelihood @xmath14 .",
    "the ml ratio test tells that the twice of difference in the logarithms of the likelihoods @xmath15 should follow @xmath16 distribution with 6 degrees of freedom @xcite",
    ". therefore ml ratio test , employed in @xcite and now applied on the duration - hardness plane with these 427 grbs including the six events corrected for decimation , gives again a statistically significant intermediate group at the significance level of 0.3% .",
    "the new ( former ) best - fit model parameters of the intermediate group are : 0.12 ( 0.11 ) for the mean logarithmic duration , 0.25 ( 0.27 ) for the mean logarithmic hardness , 4.1 ( 5.3% ) for the weight , and 0.0 ( 0.59 ) for the correlation coefficient .",

    "the rhessi count rates are sometimes `` decimated '' , which means that , as the rate becomes too high or the onboard solid - state recorder becomes too full , a part of the recorded counts is removed .",

    "a detailed explanation is provided in appendix  [ app:1 ] .",
    "the ccf was fitted for each of the 1001 synthetic profiles and for each burst in our sample .",
    "the median of such a distribution of 1001 maxima of polynomial fits was taken as the true lag @xmath19 for each burst .",

    "we decided to calculate the spectral lags only for bursts with a signal - to - noise ratio higher than 3.5 in both channels .",

    "this can be done by a method called the bayesian information criterion ( bic ) presented by @xcite .",
    "the function which must be maximized to get the best - fitted model parameters is : bic = 2lnl@xmath103 - @xmath104ln@xmath105 , where l@xmath103 is the maximum likelihood of the model , @xmath104 is the number of free parameters , and @xmath105 is the size of the sample . in our work",
    "we use the bic to determine the most probable model , its parameters and the number of its components .    for model - based clustering ,",

    "the nomenclature of the different models in mclust involves the following designations : the volumes , the shapes and the orientation of the axes of all clusters may be equivalent ( e ) or may vary ( v ) and the axes of all clusters may be restricted to parallel orientations with the coordinate axes ( i ) .",

    "all parameters are free .",

    "this means that - from the statistical point of view - different groups can be found if one looks at different databases .",
    "bursts observed with properties similar to the short bursts ( hardness , lag ) except their durations exceed 2s .",

    "if rhessi detects only the hard initial spike , and the softer extended emission is lost in the noise , then the detected intermediate group might be polluted by these objects .",
    "therefore , we also checked the light - curves of the rhessi intermediate bursts as observed by konus - wind @xcite , because it also has a good sensitivity below 50kev ( its range is @xmath135kev ) .",

    "however , no extended emission was observed for these seven bursts by konus - wind .",
    "this observation indicates the rhessi intermediate grbs should not be dominantly polluted by sgrbees .",
    "furthermore , there are also additional indications that grbs which do not belong to the long+xrf pair category , may originate from a broad range of astrophysical phenomena . for example",
    ", @xcite found four subclasses in the batse database from the year 1998 , but the fourth group was populated by a single grb . from the statistical point of view , such an object is an outlier of uncertain origin .",

    "<S> the analysis of the rhessi database has already inferred the existence of a third group with intermediate duration , apart from the so - called short and long groups . </S>",
    "<S> first aim of this article is to discuss the properties of these intermediate - duration bursts in terms of peak - count rates and spectral lags . </S>",
    "<S> second aim is to discuss the number of grb groups using another statistical method and by employing the peak - count rates and spectral lags as well . </S>",
    "<S> the standard parametric ( model - based clustering ) and non - parametric ( k - means clustering ) statistical tests together with the kolmogorov - smirnov and anderson - darling tests are used . </S>",
