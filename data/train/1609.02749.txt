    "the computation of displacement or stress fields of dislocations in uniform motion @xcite has attracted a lot of attention in the past since the pioneering works of frank @xcite , eshelby @xcite , bullough and bilby @xcite , and weertman @xcite .",
    "the theoretical possibility of supersonic dislocations @xcite was put forward very early @xcite , but had to wait until atomistic simulations to earn some credence @xcite .",
    "although experimental evidence is still lacking , the quest for supersonic dislocations in metals has since gained impetus with the help of current experimental and simulation tools @xcite . however , experimental evidence for supersonic dislocations is already available in systems other than metals , e.g. , in dust plasma crystals @xcite or in relation with seismological events @xcite .",
    "we mainly deal hereafter with two classes of rectilinear dislocations @xcite .",
    "the first one is that of elementary ` point - like ' volterra dislocations .",
    "the other one is that of somigliana dislocations @xcite ( sometimes called _ smeared - out _ dislocations ) .",
    "hereafter we take them with a flat core of finite width , of the specific functional kind that solves both the peierls - nabarro equation @xcite and the weertman equation @xcite with the frenkel ( sine ) pull - back force @xcite .",
    "eshelby @xcite first used this particular dislocation model to study the width of a moving dislocation .",
    "afterwards , it was employed in further studies on motion @xcite . for conciseness , and for lack of a definite name",
    ", such a dislocation will tentatively be called hereafter an _",
    "eshelby dislocation_. a precise definition of it is given in sec .",
    "[ sec : eshdis ] below .",
    "results for volterra dislocations can be obtained as limits of results for somgliana dislocations by letting the core width go to zero @xcite .",
    "such limits define in general distributions or pseudo - functions , and this aspect of volterra dislocations has recently been emphasized as it is particularly important in dynamics @xcite .",
    "more classically , it has long been known @xcite that volterra supersonic expressions involve mach cones in the form of dirac measures along cone generators @xcite . because dirac measures ( or pseudo - functions , for that matter ) can not be plotted in any meaningful way , numerical field calculations in the supersonic regime require considering somigliana ( or other kinds of smeared - out dislocations ; e.g. , @xcite ) instead of volterra dislocations .",
    "somigliana dislocations can be obtained by convolution of the volterra distributional solution with the appropriate dislocation density function and result in more regular fields @xcite .",
    "as pointed out by eshelby @xcite and weertman @xcite in the context of isotropic elasticity , mach cones generated by such smeared - out dislocations are spread over a finite width of order the dislocation width ; thus , they can be evaluated numerically @xcite .",
    "our emphasis is on dislocation motion in anisotropic media .",
    "an anisotropic medium sustains three wave vector - dependent bulk wavespeeds @xcite .",
    "relatively to the glide direction , those wavespeeds define in non - degenerate cases three particular limiting velocities to be compared to the dislocation velocity @xmath0 , hereafter denoted as @xmath1 where the subscripts stand for `` lower '' , `` intermediate '' and `` upper '' , which can be computed from sections of slowness surfaces transverse to the dislocation line , as explained by lothe in refs .",
    ", @xmath2 and @xmath3 are denoted , respectively , @xmath4 ( also @xmath5 in @xcite ) , @xmath6 , and @xmath7 . ] following lothe s terminology ( also , @xcite ) , the inequality @xmath8 defines the _ subsonic _ range ; there are three isolated _ transonic _ velocities @xmath9 , and the _ fully supersonic _",
    "range is @xmath10 .",
    "the qualificative _ supersonic _ applies to all velocities @xmath11 .",
    "we shall call _ intersonic _ the intermediate supersonic ranges @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "is often termed _ transonic _ ( but also _ intersonic _ ) and the range @xmath14 is termed _ supersonic _ , where @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the shear and dilatational wavespeeds , respectively . ]    as is well - known , stroh @xcite devised a powerful method to deal with subsonic volterra dislocations of arbitrary character in an anisotropic medium ( see @xcite for reviews ) .",
    "the method requires solving a @xmath17 eigenvalue problem an inexpensive task with today s computers .",
    "moreover , the current formulation of the stroh theory provides basic insight on anisotropic supersonic solutions @xcite .",
    "for instance , the limiting velocities can be determined , as well as the opening angle of the mach cones .",
    "up to three mach cones can arise ( in the fully supersonic regime ) , involving two waves each @xcite .",
    "to our knowledge however , a general formula for the intensity of the mach cones ( the prefactor of the dirac measures , for volterra dislocations ) has not been derived .",
    "besides , no anisotropic supersonic somigliana solution is available .",
    "this prompts us to seek general analytical means to compute supersonic dislocation fields in anisotropic media .    on another issue , the geometric configuration of mach cones in anisotropic media can prove surprising .",
    "indeed , payton @xcite reported from a particular solution for the fields of a volterra dislocation in a transversely anisotropic medium , the possible existence of ` backwards ' mach cones , i.e. , v - shaped waves with cone aperture directed _ towards _ the direction of motion .",
    "no explanation for this counter - intuitive phenomenon has been given so far in terms of general principles .",
    "having derived his solution for a uniformly - moving dislocation as the long - time steady - state asymptotics of a transient causal field solution , payton emphasized the necessity of accounting for causality in field expressions to investigate mach cones .",
    "this stems from the fact that mach cones are built over time as caustics of expanding wavefront sets , which is a causal process .",
    "however , the classical exposition of stroh s formalism rests on postulating _ a priori _ functional expressions for the fields , independently of any consideration of causality @xcite .",
    "but without causality , a - causal spurious wavepackets solutions of the field equations could arise , which must be prevented .",
    "accordingly , the purpose of this paper is : first , to endow the stroh formalism with causal properties , which is done in section [ sec : green ] starting from the green function of the wave equation ; second , to derive from this modified formalism field solutions relative to somigliana dislocations ( section [ sec : eshelby ] ) .",
    "the volterra limit of vanishing core size is also examined , revealing the features of mach cones ( geometry , and intensity ) , and a simple existence criterion for payton s ` backward ' cones is derived ( section [ sec : machcones ] ) .",
    "in addition , full - field calculations are compared with the straightforward huygens construction of mach cones from ray surfaces to validate our analytical method of handling fields in the supersonic regime .",
    "a concluding discussion closes the paper ( section [ sec : concl ] ) .",
    "a few technical calculations are developed in [ sec : distr ] and [ sec : appflat ] .",
    "our conventions for the fourier transform of a space- and time - dependent function @xmath18 are as follows : @xmath19 where unless otherwise stated integrations with respect to the space variable @xmath20 and the wave vector @xmath21 are over the @xmath22-dimensional space @xmath23 ( @xmath24 or @xmath25 ) , and integrations with respect to the time @xmath26 and the angular frequency @xmath27 are over @xmath28 .",

    "adams @xcite came close to the point in 2001 , in the context of a weertman - type equation for slip - pulse propagation at the interface between two different isotropic media .",
    "he noticed that unique expressions of the coefficients of the governing equation apply indifferently to subsonic or intersonic velocities , provided that all ` relativistic ' terms involved , of the type @xmath382 ( where @xmath383 is any of the four wavespeeds involved ) for @xmath384 , are replaced for @xmath385 by @xmath386 , which he rightfully identified as a ` radiation condition ' without however giving any further explanation .",

    "the range is simply the one for which waves have a normal to the slowness surface ( proportional to the group velocity ) that points towards the abscissa axis .",
    "there exists a well - known close connection @xcite between the problem of a uniformly - moving dislocation in an anisotropic media , and the theory of surface waves and of wave reflection at interfaces in anisotropic media ( see , e.g. , @xcite for recent reviews ) . in the latter context",
    ", it is remarked that waves with such normals have been interpreted as incident waves onto the interface @xcite .",
    "our analysis of ` backward ' cones shows that such waves can also be radiated away _ from _ the glide plane ( but the side opposite as the usual one ) , thus offering a new perspective on their practical significance .",
    "the very natural question as to whether fully - developed ` backward ' march cones could effectively be observed in atomistic simulations or in finite - element calculations is an issue beyond the scope of this paper . to answer",
    "it would require at least investigating the stability of such steady motions @xcite .",
    "this problem is connected with the determination of the width of the eshelby dislocation as a function of the velocity @xcite , and will be examined elsewhere @xcite .",
    "the author thanks a.  vattr for discussions about the stroh formalism in the preliminary steps .",
    "some useful distributions employed in the paper are briefly recalled .",
    "first , the well - known sokhotski - plemelj formula is @xmath393 taking its derivative with respect to @xmath394 gives @xmath395 which can be generalized to any number of successive differentiations ( e.g. , @xcite , p.  94 ) .",
    "the interesting identity ( [ eq : curious ] ) is proven as follows .",
    "introduce the integral @xmath396 where @xmath89 is the angle between @xmath72 and @xmath100 . by ( [ eq : dsk ] )",
    ", the limit of @xmath397 as @xmath268 is equal to the integral in the left - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ eq : curious ] ) . then @xmath398 the real part of the integral vanishes by symmetry , so that @xmath399 the fraction in this result goes to @xmath102 as @xmath268 @xcite , which proves identity ( [ eq : curious ] ) .",
    "we explain the computation of the @xmath174 component of integral ( [ eq : intflat1 ] ) .",
    "the other angular integrals of the paper are obtained by the same method .",
    "we thus need to compute @xmath400 where @xmath401 stands for @xmath402 , @xmath403 , and @xmath404 is a complex angle .",
    "then , the imaginary parts @xmath405 and @xmath406 have same signs . introducing the complex variable @xmath407 , integral ( [ eq : ivmint ] )",
    "is transformed into a contour integral over @xmath408 in the complex plane , on the unit circle @xmath409 defined by @xmath410 .",
    "this change of variables entails      where , invoking cauchy s theorem , the integral is computed by summing up residues @xmath412 of @xmath413 at its poles .",
    "the first sum in ( [ eq : sumres ] ) is over the residues at those poles @xmath414 of @xmath413 that are enclosed within the contour @xmath409 ( i.e. , such that @xmath415 ) .",
    "the rightmost one , in which we have introduced weights @xmath416 , is over the residues at _ all _ poles , provided that we take @xmath417 if @xmath415 and @xmath418",
    "if @xmath419 . in the intermediate case @xmath420 where the pole lies _ on _ the contour @xmath409 , the principal - value prescription is invoked to handle the singularity . as discussed shortly , this simply amounts to taking @xmath421 . the function @xmath422 has seven poles @xmath414 , @xmath423 with associated residues @xmath412 . with @xmath424",
    ", they read @xmath425}{2(\\varepsilon^2 - 1 + 2{\\mathrm{i}}\\varepsilon s_y \\cos\\gamma)[\\cos(\\gamma-\\psi)-{\\mathrm{i}}s_y\\varepsilon\\cos\\psi]}}},\\\\ { { \\displaystyle z_{5,6}=\\pm\\sqrt{\\frac{1+\\varepsilon^2 + 2\\varepsilon|\\sin\\gamma|}{{\\mathrm{e}}^{-2{\\mathrm{i}}\\gamma}+\\varepsilon^2 } } } } & { { \\displaystyle r_{5,6}=\\frac{\\sin\\gamma[\\sin(\\gamma-\\psi)-{\\mathrm{i}}s_y \\varepsilon\\sin\\psi]}{2(\\varepsilon^2 - 1 - 2{\\mathrm{i}}\\varepsilon s_y \\cos\\gamma)[\\cos(\\gamma-\\psi)+{\\mathrm{i}}\\varepsilon s_y\\cos\\psi]}}}. \\end{array}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in the expressions for the poles @xmath426 , we have for convenience correlated with @xmath427 the alternate sign under the square roots by introducing the absolute value of @xmath428 , so that @xmath429 ( poles inside the contour ) and @xmath430 ( poles outside the contour ) . as a result , @xmath431 always intervenes within a group @xmath432 in the residues .",
    "the latter inequalities are saturated if and only if @xmath433 or @xmath434 , namely , on the the glide path @xmath435 in cartesian coordinates . in the generic case @xmath436 , we have @xmath437 and @xmath438 .",
    "when @xmath439 the poles in the pairs @xmath440 and @xmath441 , and @xmath442 and @xmath443 , coalesce , pinching the contour : the integral develops a so - called _ pinch singularity _ , which sometimes leads to contour integrals being divergent . however , the singularity is inessential in the present case since the residues @xmath444 vanish in the limit .",
    "moreover , @xmath445 , and if @xmath446 , then @xmath447 so that @xmath448 , whereas @xmath449 in the opposite situation .",
    "it is intuitively obvious that the intermediate singular case @xmath450 ( for which both poles @xmath451 lie on the contour , and the contour integral is ill - defined ) must be handled by taking @xmath452 , i.e. , by averaging the results of both previous cases .",
    "this amounts to taking a principal - value prescription .    expressing the weighted sum of residues ( [ eq : sumres ] ) in terms of @xmath453 by means of lengthy simplifications involving usual trigonometric identities ,",
    "we compute separately the cases @xmath446 ( only poles @xmath454 contribute ) and @xmath455 ( only poles @xmath456 contribute ) . both results are encoded into the following single expression , where @xmath457 with the convention that @xmath458 : @xmath459.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] multiplying by @xmath460 as in eq .",
    "( [ eq : intflat1 ] ) eventually yields the @xmath174 component in that equation .",
