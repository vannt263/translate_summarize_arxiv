    "randomized algorithms are simpler and more efficient than their deterministic counterparts in many applications . in some settings such as communication complexity and distributed computing",
    ", it is even possible to prove unconditionally that allowing randomness improves the efficiency of algorithms ( see e.g. ,  @xcite )",
    ". however , access to sources of randomness ( especially common randomness ) may be limited , or the quality of randomness in the source may be far from perfect .",
    "having such an imperfect source of randomness , one may be able to extract ( almost ) unbiased and independent random bits using _",
    "randomness extractors_. a randomness extractor is a function applied to an imperfect source of randomness whose outcome is an almost perfect source of randomness .",
    "the problem of randomness extraction from imperfect sources of randomness was perhaps first considered by von neumann @xcite .",
    "a later important work in this area is @xcite where santha and vazirani introduced the imperfect sources of randomness now often called santha - vazirani ( sv ) sources .",
    "these sources can easily be defined in terms of an adversary with two coins .",
    "consider an adversary who has two different coins , one of which is biased towards heads ( e.g. ,  @xmath3 ) and the other one is biased towards tails ( e.g. ,  @xmath4 ) .",
    "the adversary , in each time step , chooses one of the two coins and tosses it .",
    "adversary s choice of coin may depend ( probabilistically ) on the previous outcomes of the tosses .",
    "the sequence of random outcomes of these coin tosses is called a sv source .",
    "santha and vazirani @xcite show that randomness extraction from the above sources through a deterministic method is impossible .",
    "more precisely , they show that for every deterministic way of extracting one random bit , there is a strategy for the adversary such that the extracted bit is biased , or more specifically , the extracted bit is 0 with probability either @xmath5 or @xmath6 .",
    "subsequently , other proofs for this result have been found ( see e.g. ,  @xcite ) . in appendix",
    "[ appendixc ] , we give a more refined version of this result , which provides a more detailed picture of the limits of what the adversary can achieve .    despite this negative result , such imperfect sources of randomness are enough for many applications .",
    "for example , as shown by vazirani and vazirani @xcite , randomized polynomial - time algorithms that use perfect random bits can be simulated using sv sources .",
    "this fact can also be verified using the fact that the min - entropy of sv sources is linear in the size of the source ( where min - entropy , in the context of extractors , was first introduced by @xcite ) .",
    "indeed , by the later theory of randomness extraction ( e.g. ,  see  @xcite ) , it is possible to efficiently extract polynomially many almost random bits from such sources with high min - entropy if we are , in addition to the imperfect source , endowed with a perfectly random seed of logarithmic length .",
    "( in fact , for the special case of sv sources , a seed of constant length is enough  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* problem 6.6 ) ) . for the application of randomized polynomial - time algorithms where a logarithmic - length random seed is not available",
    ", we can enumerate in polynomial time over all the logarithmic - length seeds ; for each choice of the seed , we apply the randomness extractor with the given seed and use its outcome bits ( that are not truly random ) in the algorithm . finally , we take a majority over the outputs of the algorithm for different choices of the seed .",
    "enumerating over all seeds may be inefficient for some applications , or does not work at all , e.g. , in interactive proofs and one - shot scenarios such as cryptography .",
    "therefore , it is natural to ask whether deterministic randomness extraction from imperfect sources of randomness is possible . for most applications , it is also necessary to require that the extractor be explicit , i.e. , extraction can be done efficiently ( in polynomial time ) .",
    "previous to this work , explicit deterministic extractors had been constructed for many different classes of sources , including i.i.d .  bits with unknown bias @xcite , markov chains @xcite , affine sources @xcite , polynomial sources @xcite , and sources consisting of independent blocks @xcite .    *",
    "deterministic extractors for generalized sv sources . *",
    "although  @xcite proves the impossibility of deterministic randomness extraction from sv sources , this impossibility is shown only for binary sources . in this paper",
    "we show that if we consider a generalization of sv sources over _ non - binary _ alphabets , deterministic randomness extraction is indeed possible under certain conditions .    to generalize sv sources over non - binary alphabets , we assume that the adversary , instead of coins , has some multi - faceted ( say 6-sided ) dice .",
    "the numbers written on the faces of different dice are the same , but each die may have a different probability for a given face value .",
    "the adversary throws these dice @xmath7 times , each time choosing a die to throw depending on the results of the previous throws .",
    "again , the outcome is an imperfect source of randomness , for which we may ask whether deterministic randomness extraction is possible or not .",
    "when the dice are non - degenerate , i.e. , all faces of all dice have non - zero probability , we give a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of a deterministic strategy for extracting one bit with arbitrarily small bias .",
    "for example , when the dice are 6-sided , the necessary and sufficient condition implies that we can deterministically extract an almost unbiased bit when the adversary has access to any arbitrary set of five non - degenerate dice , but randomness extraction is not possible in general when the adversary has access to six non - degenerate 6-sided dice .",
    "more precisely , a set of non - degenerate dice leads to extractable generalized sv sources if and only if the convex hull of the set of probability distributions associated with the set of dice does not have full dimension in the  probability simplex \" .",
    "we emphasize that when we prove the possibility of deterministic extraction , we also provide an explicit extractor .",
    "* relation to block - sources . *",
    "the generalized sv sources considered in this paper are also a generalization of  block - sources \" defined by chor and goldreich @xcite , where the source is divided into several blocks such that each block has min - entropy at least @xmath8 conditioned on the value of the previous blocks .",
    "such a block - source can be thought as a generalized sv source where the adversary can generate each block ( given previous blocks ) using any  flat \" distribution with support @xmath9 .",
    "being a special case of generalized sv sources ( defined here ) , block - sources have another difference as well : since it is impossible to extract from a single block - source deterministically , the common results regarding extraction from block - sources are about either seeded extractors ( e.g.  @xcite ) or extraction from at least two independent block - sources ( e.g.  @xcite ) .    * common randomness extractors .",
    "* common random bits , shared by distinct parties , constitute an important resource for distributed algorithms ; common random bits can be used by the parties to synchronize the randomness of their local actions .",
    "we may ask the question of randomness extraction in this setting too . assuming that the parties are provided with an imperfect source of common randomness",
    ", the question is whether perfect common randomness can be extracted from this source or not .",
    "gcs and krner  @xcite and witsenhausen  @xcite have looked at the problem of extraction of common random bits from a very special class of imperfect sources , namely i.i.d .",
    "sources . in this case , the _ bipartite _ source available to the parties is generated as follows : in each time step , a pair @xmath10 with some predetermined distribution ( known by the two parties ) and independent of the past is generated ; @xmath11 is revealed to the first party and @xmath12 is revealed to the second party . after receiving arbitrarily many repetitions of random variables @xmath11 and @xmath12 , the two parties aim to extract a common random bit .",
    "it is known that in this case , the two parties ( who are not allowed to communicate ) can generate a common random bit if and only if @xmath11 and @xmath12 have a common data  @xcite .",
    "this means that common randomness generation is possible if @xmath11 and @xmath12 can be expressed as @xmath13 and @xmath14 for a nonconstant common part @xmath15 , i.e. , there are nonconstant functions @xmath16 such that @xmath17 .",
    "observe that when a common part exists , common randomness can be extracted by the parties by applying the same extractor on the sequence of @xmath15 s .",
    "that is , the problem of common randomness extraction in the i.i.d .",
    "case is reduced to the problem of ordinary randomness extraction .",
    "these results are obtained using a measure of correlation called  _ maximal correlation_. the key feature of this measure of correlation that helps proving the above result is the _ tensorization property _ , i.e. , the maximal correlation between random variables @xmath11 and @xmath12 is equal to that of @xmath18 and @xmath19 for any @xmath7 , where @xmath18 and @xmath19 denote @xmath7 i.i.d .",
    "repetitions of @xmath11 and @xmath12 .    in this paper",
    "we consider the problem of common randomness extraction from _ distributed sv sources _ defined as follows . in a distributed sv source ,",
    "the adversary again has some multi - faceted dice , but here , instead of a single number , a pair of numbers @xmath20 is written on each face .",
    "as before , the set of values written on the faces of the dice is the same , but the probabilities of face values may differ in different dice . in each time step , the adversary depending on the results of the previous throws , picks a die and throws it . if @xmath20 is the result of the throw , @xmath11 is given to the first party and @xmath12 to second party .",
    "thus , the two parties will observe random variables @xmath11 and @xmath12 whose joint distribution depends on the choice of die by the adversary .",
    "again consider the non - degenerate case where all faces on all the dice of the adversary have positive probability .",
    "we show that in this case , we can extract a common random bit from the distributed sv source if and only if it is possible to extract randomness from the common part of @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "that is , similar to the i.i.d .",
    "case , the problem of common randomness extraction from distributed sv sources is reduced to the problem of randomness extraction from non - binary generalized sv sources . since by our results",
    ", we know when randomness extraction from generalized sv sources is possible , we obtain a complete answer to the problem in the distributed case too .",
    "this relation between the problem of common randomness extraction and the problem of randomness extraction from the common part holds in more general settings . for example , it resolves the problem of common randomness extraction from the following interesting distributed sv source .    * example . * a concrete example of a distributed sv source is as follows .",
    "let us start with the original source considered by santha and vazirani with two coins .",
    "assume that the adversary chooses coin @xmath21 ( where coin 1 is biased towards heads and coin 2 is biased towards tails ) and let the outcome of the throw of the coin be denoted by random variable @xmath15 .",
    "the first party , alice , is assumed to observe both the identity of the coin chosen by the adversary , i.e. , @xmath22 , and the outcome of the coin , which is @xmath15 .",
    "the second party , bob , observes the outcome of the coin @xmath15 , but only gets to see the choice of the adversary with probability 0.99 .",
    "that is , bob gets @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the result of passing @xmath22 through a binary erasure channel with erasure probability 0.01 . here the common part of @xmath25 and @xmath26 is just @xmath15 .",
    "our result ( theorem  [ thm : main - distributed ] ) then implies that alice and bob can not benefit from their knowledge of the actions of adversary , and should only consider the @xmath15 sequence .",
    "but then from the result of @xcite , we can conclude that common random bit extraction is impossible in this example .",
    "* proof techniques . *",
    "we briefly explain the techniques used in the proof of the above results .",
    "consider a deterministic randomness extractor that extracts one bit from a generalized sv source .",
    "we can view this extractor as labeling the leaves of a rooted tree with zeros and ones .",
    "each sequence of dice throws corresponds to a path from the root to one of the leaves , and at each node , the adversary has some limited control of which branch to take while moving from the root towards the leaves . to prove the impossibility of randomness extraction",
    ", we need to show that either the minimum or the maximum of the probability of the output bit being zero , over all adversary s strategies , is far from @xmath27 .",
    "our idea is to track these maximum and minimum probabilities in a recursive way , i.e. , to find these probabilities for any node of the tree in terms of these values for its children .",
    "we then by induction show that for each node of the tree either the minimum probability or the maximum probability is far from @xmath27 .",
    "to be more precise , given a deterministic extractor , let @xmath28 be the minimum probability of output bit being zero ( over all strategies of the adversary ) .",
    "similarly , let @xmath29 be the maximum probability of output bit being zero ( over all strategies of the adversary ) .",
    "then we show that under certain conditions , there exists a _",
    "function @xmath30 on the interval @xmath31 $ ] , such that @xmath32 and furthermore @xmath33 .",
    "we prove @xmath32 inductively using the tree structure discussed above .",
    "this implies the desired impossibility result , as by the continuity of @xmath30 , both @xmath28 and @xmath29 can not be close to @xmath27 .",
    "for instance , for the binary sv source with two coins having probability of heads respectively equal to @xmath34 and @xmath35 , figure  [ fig1 ] shows a curve where @xmath36 always lies above it .",
    "this curve is clearly isolated from @xmath37 .",
    "we follow similar ideas for proving our impossibility result for common randomness extraction from a distributed sv source ; again we construct a continuous function , which somehow captures not only the minimum and maximum of the probability of the extracted common bit being zero , but also the probability that the two parties agree on their extracted bits .",
    "the construction of this function is more involved in the distributed case ; it has two terms one of which is similar to the function in the non - distributed case , and the other is inspired by the definition of maximal correlation mentioned above .    to show the possibility of deterministic randomness extraction under certain conditions , we try to use linear relations among the probability vectors associated with different dice in order to define a martingale with anti - concentration properties , and use the theory of stopping times for martingales and submartingales .",
    "* contributions to information theory . * as mentioned above , the problem of common randomness extraction from i.i.d .",
    "sources has been studied in the information theory community .",
    "then our work provides a generalization and an alternative proof of known results in the i.i.d .  case .",
    "in particular , we give a new proof of witsenhausen s result  @xcite on the impossibility of common randomness extraction from certain i.i.d .  sources .",
    "we also would like to point out that a generalized sv source as we define , is indeed an arbitrarily varying source ( avs )  @xcite with a causal adversary .",
    "these sources are studied in the information theory literature from the point of view of source coding  @xcite",
    ".    * notations . * in the rest of this section we fix some notations that will be used .",
    "the main results of the paper are discussed in the following two sections .",
    "probability spaces in this paper are all over finite sets which are denoted by calligraphic letters such as @xmath38 .",

    "we also consider functions @xmath42 .",
    "such a function can be thought of as a random variable @xmath43 .",

    ")  random variables is denoted by @xmath61 .",
    "similarly for @xmath62 we use @xmath63 .",
    "we also use the notation @xmath64 } = ( c_k , c_{k+1},\\dots , c_{k+\\ell})$ ] .",
    "let @xmath38 be a finite alphabet set .",
    "consider a _",
    "finite _ set of distributions over @xmath38 indexed by a set @xmath65 .",

    "generalized sv sources can be alternatively characterized as follows : given @xmath80 and @xmath89 , the distribution of @xmath70 should be a convex combination of the set of @xmath90 distributions @xmath91 .",
    "we emphasize that even after fixing distributions @xmath67 , the generalized sv source ( similar to ordinary sv sources ) is not a fixed source , but rather a class of sources .",
    "this is because in each step @xmath92 is chosen arbitrarily by the adversary as a ( probabilistic ) function of @xmath69 .",
    "nevertheless , once we fix adversary s strategy , the generalized sv source is fixed in that class of sources .",
