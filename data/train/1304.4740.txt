    "the @xmath0he(@xmath1)@xmath2be reaction is an excellent example of those reactions which preserve their importance over several decades despite many experimental and theoretical studies devoted to them .",
    "the crucial role played by the @xmath0he(@xmath1)@xmath2be reaction in solar hydrogen burning was realized more than 50 years ago , when h.d .",
    "holmgren and r.l .",
    "johnston measured its cross section @xcite and found a value being about a factor of 100 higher than estimated theoretically @xcite .",
    "this result indicated that the 2nd and 3rd pp - chains @xcite can compete favorably with the first chain at the temperature of the solar core .",
    "several experimental studies followed this pioneering work in the next decades aiming at the determination of the @xmath0he(@xmath1)@xmath2be cross section at energies as low as possible in order to approach the astrophysically relevant energy range @xcite .",
    "this energy range , the so called gamow window , lies between about 15 and 30kev at 15 mk temperature relevant for the solar core .",
    "the cross section at these energies is too small to be measured directly , theory - based extrapolations are therefore necessary to obtain the cross section at solar energies and hence the reaction rate .",
    "figure[fig : old_data ] shows the summary of the experimental results available at the time when the first review paper on solar fusion reactions by e.g. adelberger _ et al . _",
    "@xcite was published . in order to avoid the strong energy dependence of the cross section caused by the coulomb barrier penetration , the results are shown in the form of the astrophysical s - factor .",
    "based on these data , a recommended value of the zero energy extrapolated s - factor of s(0)=0.53@xmath40.05kevb is quoted in ref.@xcite .",
    "the relative high uncertainty of this value is on one hand due to the typically low precision of the individual measurement at low energies and the large scatter of the data points ( see fig.[fig : old_data ] ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the uncertainty is also increased by the fact that measurements carried out with two different experimental techniques ( activation and in - beam methods , see below ) resulted in different s(0 ) extrapolated values @xcite .    at around the turn of the century the detection of solar neutrinos entered a precision era .",
    "the solar neutrino problem has been solved by the discovery of neutrino oscillation @xcite and the flux of @xmath2be and @xmath5b solar neutrinos can now be measured with a precision of about 3 - 4% by various neutrino detectors @xcite .",
    "the measured neutrino fluxes can therefore be used to probe the solar core and test solar models if the underlying nuclear physics input , i.e. the cross section of pp - chain reactions is known with sufficient precision @xcite . since the @xmath0he(@xmath1)@xmath2be reaction is the starting point of the 2nd and 3rd chains from where the @xmath2be and @xmath5b solar neutrinos originate , the uncertainty of its cross section must be reduced .",
    "the need for a more precise @xmath0he(@xmath1)@xmath2be cross section arose also from another field of nuclear astrophysics , namely the big - bang nucleosynthesis .",
    "owing to the high precision measurement of some cosmological parameters , like the baryon - to - photon ratio of the universe carried out by the wmap mission @xcite , primordial abundances of some light nuclei can be compared to observation with high accuracy . while good agreement is found between model predictions and observations for most of the nuclei produced in the big - bang , @xmath2li is significantly overproduced in the models .",
    "this so called @xmath2li problem is one of the biggest unresolved problems of big - bang theory @xcite . at the observed values of the baryon - to - photon ratio of the universe",
    "the @xmath0he(@xmath1)@xmath2be reaction is responsible mainly for the production of @xmath2li .",
    "the @xmath2be decays by electron capture to @xmath2li after the primordial nucleosynthesis ceasesli would be mainly produced directly by the @xmath0h(@xmath1)@xmath2li reaction . ] .",
    "the precise knowledge of the @xmath0he(@xmath1)@xmath2be reaction rate is crucial in order to exclude a solution of the @xmath2li problem based on this reaction rate .",
    "answering the urgent call from these two fields of nuclear astrophysics , several new experiments studied the @xmath0he(@xmath1)@xmath2be reaction in the last 10 years @xcite .",
    "the results of these `` modern '' @xmath0he(@xmath1)@xmath2be experiments are shown in fig.[fig : new_data ] .",
    "not surprisingly these experiments tried to concentrate on the low energy range in order to be as close to astrophysical energies as possible .",
    "only the erna collaboration using a novel approach of a recoil separator measured the cross section in a wider energy range up to e@xmath3=3.1mev @xcite . above about 1.3mev the only dataset previously available was that of p.  parker and r.  kavanagh @xcite .",
    "fig.[fig : new_data ] also includes these data . as one can see",
    ", there is a clear disagreement between the two high energy datasets .",
    "the erna data are significantly higher than the p.  parker and r.  kavanagh data and the energy dependence of the s - factor is also different .",
    "this contradiction has a strong astrophysical consequence since the cross section must be determined at solar energies , well below the lowest available measurement and the extrapolations are based on theoretical calculations .",
    "the goodness of these theoretical models and thus the reliability of the extrapolation is assessed based on the comparison with experimental data at high energies where data are available .",
    "moreover , the calculated s - factors are often fitted to available experimental data by a single rescaling parameter to obtain the extrapolated s - factor , even though such a rescaling does not have a strong physical justification for microscopic models @xcite . as an example ,",
    "fig.[fig : new_data ] shows three theoretical cross section curves which are used to obtain cross sections at the gamow window .",
    "the result of the microscopic models of t. kajino and a. arima @xcite and k.m .",
    "nollett @xcite were published when only the `` old '' experimental data were available . in lack of other data ,",
    "their aim was to describe the data of p.  parker and r.  kavanagh at high energies .",
    "after the erna data became available , t. neff carried out microscopic model calculations and was able to describe relatively well the `` modern '' experimental data @xcite .",
    "the zero energy extrapolated s - factors from the models differ by as much as 50% ( without any rescaling to experimental data ) .",
    "several other theoretical models are available for the @xmath0he(@xmath1)@xmath2be reaction ( see e.g. refs.@xcite ) .",
    "the application of different theoretical models introduces a non - negligible uncertainty in the extrapolated s - factor .",
    "the new review paper on solar fusion reactions by e.g.  adelberger _",
    "_ @xcite assigns a theoretical uncertainty of 4% to this value . in order to reduce this uncertainty ,",
    "the high energy behavior of the @xmath0he(@xmath1)@xmath2be cross section must also be understood .",
    "presently there is no explanation to the difference between the two datasets at high energies .",
    "it is therefore necessary to carry out new experiments in the problematic energy range in order to provide more data for a better understanding of the cross section behavior .",
    "the aim of the present work is thus to measure the cross section in the energy range between e@xmath3=1.5mev and 2.5mev .",
    "there are two different ways to determine the @xmath0he(@xmath1)@xmath2be cross section which were both used several timesbe isotopes in a recoil separator .",
    "this technique was used up to now solely by the erna collaboration .",
    "a similar experiment is in preparation at the dragon facility at triumf , vancouver , canada @xcite . ] .",
    "the in - beam technique is based on the detection of prompt @xmath6-radiation emitted when the fusion of the two helium isotopes takes place in the direct capture process .",
    "the capture can lead to the ground or first excited states of @xmath2be and with the in - beam method partial cross section leading to these two states can be measured separately .",
    "the sum of the partial cross sections provides the total cross section .",
    "the other method is the activation which exploits the fact that the produced @xmath2be isotope is radioactive .",
    "it decays with a half - life of 53.22@xmath40.06d @xcite and the electron capture decay is followed by the emission of a single @xmath6-radiation of 478kev with 10.44@xmath40.04% relative intensity @xcite .",
    "the off - line detection of this @xmath6-radiation can also be used to determine the cross section .",
    "this method provides directly the total cross section but gives no information about the branching ratio between the population of the ground state and first excited state .",
    "the set of `` old '' experiments showed an apparent discrepancy of about 15% between the results obtained with the two methods .",
    "the new experiments of the luna collaboration @xcite and brown _ et al . _",
    "@xcite provided data with both methods and perfect agreement between the results were found .",
    "therefore , in the present work only one technique was used .",
    "the activation method has some clear advantages over the in - beam technique , especially at higher energies .",
    "there is no need to determine the angular distribution of the emitted @xmath6-rays - as opposed to the in - beam method - and the beam induced background is of less importance .",
    "therefore , the activation method has been chosen for the present work .",
    "since the @xmath0he(@xmath1)@xmath2be reaction takes place between two isotopes of a gaseous element , the application of a gas target is necessary . at high energies ,",
    "a thin window gas cell is a possible choice because the beam energy loss in the entrance foil is typically low compared to the beam energy and does not introduce a high uncertainty in the determination of the effective energy .",
    "a thin window gas cell is technically easier to handle and the determination of the number of target atoms can be done with high precision .",
    "the present study was thus carried out using a thin window gas cell .",
    "further details about possible gas target designs can be found in @xcite .",
    "the experimental procedure used to determine the @xmath0he(@xmath1)@xmath2be cross section has been described in detail in a separate publication @xcite . here",
    "only the most important aspects of the experiments are summarized .",
    "the @xmath7-beam was provided by the mgc-20 cyclotron of atomki @xcite .",
    "after many tests , five irradiations were carried out between @xmath7-energies of 4.0 and 6.3 mev .",
    "the energy of the beam at the used beamline is defined to a precision of 0.3% .",
    "the typical @xmath8he@xmath9 beam intensity was between 100 and 250pna .",
    "the length of irradiations varied between 14 and 25 hours ( see table[tab : irrad ] ) .",
    "although the irradiation time was short compared to the half - life of the reaction product , the current integrator counts were recorded in multichannel scaling mode with 1 min time base in order to follow the changes in beam intensity .",
    "the current integrator was calibrated using a current generator and a precision current meter .",
    "the beam entered the target chamber through a beam defining aperture of 4 mm in diameter .",
    "after this aperture the whole chamber , including the gas cell , served as a faraday cup in order to determine the number of projectiles impinging on the target by charge measurement .",
    "a larger diameter aperture was placed behind the beam defining aperture and biased to -300v to suppress the secondary electrons emitted from the target and aperture .",
    "a liquid nitrogen cooled trap was placed upstream the chamber to reduce the carbon build - up on the gas cell entrance foil .",
    "the @xmath0he target gas was confined in a closed gas cell of 3 cm length .",
    "the @xmath0he isotopic enrichment was 99.95% .",
    "the gas was filled into the cell before the irradiation and kept closed afterwards .",
    "the pressure of the gas was continuously measured with a type 722b mks baratron .",
    "the gas pressure was typically 300 mbar .",
    "the temperature of the gas cell was measured with a thermometer attached to the body of the cell .",
    "the back of the gas cell which served as the beam stop was directly water cooled .",
    "the typical temperature of the cell was about 25@xmath10c determined by the cooling water temperature .",
    ".[tab : irrad ] some parameters of the irradiations .",
    "[ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     the uncertainty of the cross section values is calculated as the quadratic sum of the statistical error of the @xmath2be peak area and several systematic uncertainties .",
    "these uncertainties are listed in table[tab : uncert ] . in table[tab : results ] the statistical and total systematic uncertainties , respectively , are quoted separately in parenthesis .",
    "the uncertainty of the s - factor values also includes the effective energy uncertainty , however , since the effective energy is rather well defined , this source of uncertainty is small compared with the others listed in table[tab : uncert ] .",
