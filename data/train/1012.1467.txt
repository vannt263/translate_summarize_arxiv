    "the matrix models generate the ensemble of discretized two dimensional surfaces as a feynman diagrammatic expansion , thus providing a discrete formulation of the liouville gravity @xcite ( see also the reviews @xcite ) . in the case of the one ( hermitian ) matrix model ( omm ) ,",
    "the matrix potential can be tuned in the continuum limit in order to achieve the @xmath0 minimal liouville gravity ( mlg@xmath0 ) , which consists of matter , liouville and ghosts fields .",
    "deformations of the critical potential can also be introduced , which produce the kdv renormalization group flows between the critical points . in the liouville gravity context",
    ", this picture corresponds to perturbing the action with vertex operators .",
    "as suggested in @xcite , the exact relation between the matrix model ( kdv ) and the liouville gravity couplings involves a non - trivial resonance transformation due to the contact terms .",
    "this transformation was obtained at the first order in @xcite , and the identification of the bulk one and two point correlation functions was performed . in @xcite , a. belavin and",
    "a. zamolodchikov obtained the resonance transformation reproducing the three - point correlation function of the mlg@xmath0 from the matrix model .",
    "their result leads to a conjecture for the explicit form of the resonance transformation to all orders @xcite .",
    "this conjecture was checked up to the fifth order @xcite .",
    "it was also shown in @xcite that this transformation also works for the bulk one - point correlation function on the disc .    to complete our understanding of the discrete formulation of the liouville gravity",
    ", we have to study the realization of boundary conditions ( bcs ) and boundary operators .",
    "such approach has already been taken in various matrix models , including the rsos and @xmath3 models @xcite and the two matrix model @xcite .",
    "recently , two of the authors constructed new boundaries for the omm using additional vector fields , providing the general mlg@xmath0 bcs in the continuum limit @xcite .",

    "the three conformal killing vectors on the disc allow to fix the position of three boundary operators with the appropriate ghost dressing .",
    "since there are no remaining coordinate dependence , these correlation functions are referred as ` correlation numbers ' .",
    "so far from the matrix model , only correlators involving the @xmath23 operators were explicitly known .",
    "the purpose of this article is to construct the matrix model operators providing in the continuum limit the general boundary operators [ bcc operator ] .",

    "this paper is organized as follows . in the section [ one matrix model with vectors ] ,",
    "we briefly review the construction of the omm boundaries using the vector description .",
    "then , we discuss in section [ boundary perturbation ] the perturbation of the boundary term , and the general form of the matrix boundary operators . these operators will be explicitly determined in the section [ boundary two - point correlation numbers ] using the requirement of vanishing boundary two - point functions for two different operators in the mlg@xmath0 . as a consistency check",

    "the coupling @xmath37 is related to the bulk cosmological constant @xmath38 which controls the area fluctuation of the worldsheet .",
    "the vectors allow to emphasize the role played by the boundary , but can be integrated out , and the partition function [ starting point ] is reduced to the following expansion , @xmath39 here , @xmath40 represents the connected part of the expectation value with respect to the matrix integration with potential @xmath27 and @xmath41 stands for the trace over both flavor and matrix indices .",
    "the correlators @xmath42 describe a worldsheet with @xmath43 disconnected boundaries , or holes .",
    "they can be expanded in powers of @xmath33 , @xmath44 ; each @xmath45 describes a worldsheet with @xmath37 handles and @xmath43 holes , and @xmath46 is the corresponding euler characteristic . in this paper , we focus on the disk partition function ( @xmath47 ) in the planar limit ( @xmath48 ) , @xmath49    in the feynman diagrammatic expansion of the integral ( [ starting point ] ) , boundaries are formed by loops of the vectors , each flavor being associated to a different boundary @xcite .",
    "the diagonal elements of the matrix @xmath28 create the corresponding boundaries , whereas the off - diagonal elements produce a flavor mixing leading to a boundary changing effect .",
    "when the matrix @xmath28 is purely diagonal with respect to the flavor indices , the correlator [ disk partition function ] reduces to a sum over the disk correlators with different boundaries @xmath34 , @xmath50 , where @xmath51 denotes the trace over the matrix indices .    the simplest , and most studied , case is to consider only a single boundary and define @xmath52 .",

    "this value will be taken to be zero by a suitable shift of the matrix @xmath25 , so that we define the renormalized boundary cosmological constant as @xmath59 , which is identified with the parameter @xmath6 of the mlg@xmath0 . in this limit",

    "the new matrix boundaries introduced in @xcite are defined as @xmath66 with @xmath67 where we denoted @xmath68 and @xmath69 in the continuum limit , these couplings get renormalized as @xmath59 , @xmath70 , and the critical resolvant @xmath71 takes the same value over the variables @xmath72 , @xmath73 . in this limit",

    "in this section , we study the perturbation away from the critical boundary constructed by @xmath77 .",
    "the bulk perturbations are introduced as a modification of the potential @xmath27 , @xmath78 where the @xmath79 are the @xmath80th critical potentials leading to the mlg@xmath81 @xcite .",
    "the couplings @xmath82 generate the kdv flows between the critical points of the matrix model ; they are related to the perturbation of the mlg@xmath0 with bulk vertex operators by the resonance transformation . in a similar way",
    ", we would like to write the boundary term in [ starting point ] as a perturbation of a critical background @xmath83 , @xmath84    let us first consider the case of a single boundary @xmath85 ; the perturbed disc partition function corresponds to @xmath86 where the @xmath87 are the perturbative couplings related to the operators @xmath88 and @xmath89 .",
    "this correlator can be expanded in the perturbation series , @xmath90 and we recover in the planar limit a disc correlator with insertion of zero , one , two , etc boundary operators .",
    "these operators @xmath88 should satisfy two requirements : they have to be local and scaling operators .",
    "the first requirement imposes that @xmath88 is a polynomial in @xmath25 .",
    "indeed , the insertion of powers of the matrix corresponds to the insertion of a finite edge on the boundary , which is renormalized toward a point in the continuum limit . to understand the implication of the second requirement ,",

    "when one of the coupling @xmath87 goes from zero toward infinity , the continuum boundary flows from @xmath12 to @xmath107 .",
    "we now consider the perturbation of the off - diagonal elements of @xmath108 between the two boundaries @xmath36 and @xmath109 . to simplify the notations",

    "we will follow a practical approach and determine the boundary operators directly in the mlg@xmath0 frame , i.e. after the resonance transformation . in this frame , the critical part of the matrix model correlators for a disc with two boundaries should satisfy the condition @xmath111 where @xmath112 is proportional to the liouville boundary two - point function in the continuum limit .",
