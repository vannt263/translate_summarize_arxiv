    "integration in arrays could give an improvement in the power performances , above @xmath1 @xcite .",

    "figure [ fig1]a shows qualitatively the appearance of a nonlinear current - voltage ( iv ) curve for the quasi particle tunneling in the josephson junction .",
    "the particular form of the iv curve resembles a distorted n and hence we refer to this particular form as @xmath0-shaped iv curve .",
    "note that the quasi particle tunnel current is a unique function of the applied voltage , but the inverse function is not unique .",

    "a nonlinear region that can not be explained shows up in the iv curve @xcite .",
    "the two qualitatively different cases of a nonlinear differential resistance , referred to as @xmath0-shaped and @xmath2-shaped regions , observed in experiments will be discussed in the next sections .",
    "we mention that besides the ndr at finite voltages , also absolute negative resistance @xcite and negative input resistance at zero voltages @xcite have been reported .     in this work",
    "we want to emphasize the role of nonlinearities and to show that even a very simple model can give rise to an interesting power emission profile . however , our model , being a high frequency model , can not capture effects at low timescale , such as thermal effects @xcite .",
    "we discuss below various examples of a negative differential resistance in josephson junctions .",
    "josephson junctions come in a variety of forms with different properties but the same generic behavior .",
    "some examples are : ( i ) the traditional low temperature ( @xmath3 ) josephson junction with qualitatively different behaviors depending on the dimensions of the junction , ( ii ) high @xmath3 intrinsic josephson junctions that are typically described as a stack of long josephson junctions leading to coupled sine - gordon equations and ( iii ) point contacts and microbridges that are the easiest to describe mathematically .",

    "<S> josephson junction systems with a negative differential resistance play an essential role for applications . as a well known example , long josephson junctions of the bscco type have been considered as a source of thz radiation in recent experiments . </S>",
    "<S> numerical results for the dynamics of the fluxon system have demonstrated that a cavity induced negative differential resistance plays a crucial role for the emission of electromagnetic radiation . </S>",
    "<S> we consider the case of a negative differential resistance region in the mccumber curve itself of a single junction and found that it has an effect on the emission of electromagnetic radiation . </S>",
    "<S> two different shapes of negative differential resistance region are considered and we found it is essential to distinguish between current bias and voltage bias . </S>",
