    "<S> using the qcd sum rules we test if the new narrow structure , the @xmath0 recently observed by the belle collaboration , can be described as a @xmath1 exotic @xmath2 molecular state . </S>",
    "<S> we consider the contributions of condensates up to dimension eight , we work at leading order in @xmath3 and we keep terms which are linear in the strange quark mass @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> the mass obtained for such state is @xmath5 gev . </S>",
    "<S> we also consider a molecular @xmath6 current and we obtain @xmath7 gev . we conclude that it is not possible to describe the @xmath0 structure as a @xmath8 molecular state .    in the recent years , many new states were observed by babar , belle and cdf collaborations . </S>",
    "<S> all these states were observed in decays containing a @xmath9 or @xmath10 in the final states and their masses are in the charmonium region . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , they certainly contain a @xmath11 pair in their constituents . </S>",
    "<S> although they are above the threshold for a decay into a pair of open charm mesons they decay into @xmath9 or @xmath10 plus pions , which is unusual for @xmath11 states . another common feature of these states is the fact that their masses and decay modes are not in agreement with the predictions from potential models . for these reasons </S>",
    "<S> they are considered as candidates for exotic states . </S>",
    "<S> some of these new states have their masses very close to the meson - meson threshold , like the @xmath12 @xcite the @xmath13 @xcite and the @xmath14 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , a molecular interpretation for these states seems natural .    concerning the @xmath14 structure , </S>",
    "<S> it was observed by cdf collaboration in the decay @xmath15 . </S>",
    "<S> the mass and width of this structure is @xmath16 , @xmath17 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> its interpretation as a conventional @xmath11 state is complicated because it lies well above the threshold for open charm decays and , therefore , a @xmath11 state with this mass would decay predominantly into an open charm pair with a large total width . </S>",
    "<S> this state was interpreted as a @xmath18 or @xmath19 @xmath20 molecular state in different works @xcite . in particular , using an effective lagrangian model , the authors of ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite have suggested that a @xmath21 molecular state should be seen in the two - photon process . following this suggestion the belle collaboration @xcite searched for the @xmath14 state in the @xmath22 process . </S>",
    "<S> however , instead of the @xmath14 , the belle collaboration found evidence for a new narrow structure in the @xmath23 mass spectrum at 4.35 gev . </S>",
    "<S> the significance of the peak is 3.2 standard deviations and , if interpreted as a resonance , the mass and width of the state , called @xmath0 is @xmath24 and @xmath25 @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the possible quantum numbers for a state decaying into @xmath26 are @xmath27 and @xmath19 . at these quantum numbers , </S>",
    "<S> @xmath28 is not consistent with the constituent quark model and it is considered exotic @xcite . in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite it was noted that the mass of the @xmath0 is consistent with the prediction for a @xmath29 tetraquark state with @xmath30 @xcite and a @xmath31 molecular state @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , the state considered in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite has @xmath32 with no definite charge conjugation . </S>",
    "<S> a molecular state with a vector and a scalar @xmath33 mesons with negative charge conjugation was studied by the first time in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , and the obtained mass was @xmath34 , also consistent with the @xmath0 mass , but with not consistent quantum numbers . </S>",
    "<S> a molecular state with a vector and a scalar @xmath33 mesons with positive charge conjugation can be constructed using the combination @xmath35 .    </S>",
    "<S> there is already some interpretations for this state . in ref .  </S>",

    "<S> we use the qcd sum rules ( qcdsr ) @xcite , to study the two - point function based on a @xmath39 current with @xmath1 , to test if the new observed resonance structure , @xmath0 , can be interpreted as such molecular state , as suggested by belle coll . @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the qcd sum rule approach is based on the two - point correlation function _ </S>",
    "<S> ( q)=id^4x  e^iq.x0 |t[j_(x)j_^(0)]|0 , where a current that couples with a @xmath1 @xmath39 state is given by : j_=1 , [ field ] where @xmath40 and @xmath41 are color indices .    since the current in eq .  </S>",

    "<S> ( [ lorentz ] ) , have respectively the quantum numbers of the spin 1 and 0 mesons </S>",
    "<S> . therefore , we choose to work with the lorentz structure @xmath44 , since it gets contributions only from the @xmath28 state .    </S>",
    "<S> the qcd sum rule is obtained by evaluating the correlation function in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ 2po ] ) in two ways : in the ope side , we calculate the correlation function at the quark level in terms of quark and gluon fields . </S>",
    "<S> we work at leading order in @xmath3 in the operators , we consider the contributions from condensates up to dimension eight and we keep terms which are linear in the strange quark mass @xmath4 . in the phenomenological side , the correlation function </S>",
    "<S> is calculated by inserting intermediate states for the @xmath20 molecular scalar state . parametrizing the coupling of the exotic state , @xmath45 , to the current , @xmath46 , in eq .  </S>",
