    "the  forest ( lynds 1971 , sargent 1980 , see rauch 1998 for a review ) arises naturally in cosmological structure formation scenarios where gravitational instability acts on small initial density perturbations . in hydrodynamic simulations of such models ( cen 1994 , zhang 1995 , hernquist 1996 , wadsley & bond 1996 , theuns 1998 ,",
    "see also the analytical modelling of e.g. , bi 1993 , reisenegger and miralda - escud 1995 ) , most of the absorption seen in high redshift qso spectra is generated by residual neutral hydrogen in a continuous fluctuating photoionized intergalactic medium .",
    "in such a picture , absorbing structures have a large physical extent .",
    "observational support for this has come from comparison of the  forest in adjacent qso lines of sight ( bechtold 1994 , dinshaw 1994 , 1995 , crotts & fang 1998 ) . for matter in this phase ,",
    "it is predicted and found in simulations that the underlying mass density field at a particular point can be related to the optical depth for  absorption ( see e.g. , croft 1997 ) and hence a directly observable quantity , the transmitted flux in the qso spectrum .",
    "much work has been devoted to studying the statistical properties of the mass density field and the generic predictions of the gravitational instability picture . with the  forest as a probe of the density",
    ", we avoid many of the uncertainties associated with the use of the galaxy distribution to test theories . in principle , it should be possible , by combining our theoretical knowledge of gravitational clustering with observations of  absorption , to test the gaussianity of the initial density field , the picture of  formation , and the gravitational instability scenario itself . in this paper , we will concentrate on one - point statistics , namely the one point probability distribution function ( pdf ) of the transmitted flux , and its moments .",
    "we will use as a tool the spherical collapse or shear - free model for the evolution of density perturbations which fosalba & gaztaaga ( 1998a hereafter fg98 , 1998b ) have shown to be a good approximation to the growth of clustering in the weakly non - linear regime and which we find works well in the density regime appropriate to the study of the  forest .",
    "two point statistics , which probe the scale dependence of clustering will be examined in an accompanying paper ( gaztaaga & croft 1999 , paper ii ) .    from observations of the  forest",
    ", we can measure the pdf of the flux and its moments .",
    "the high resolution spectra of the forest taken by the keck telescope ( hu 1995 , lu 1996 , rauch 1997 , kirkman & tytler 1997 , kim 1997 ) allow us to resolve structure in the flux distribution , and make high precision , shot noise - free measurements of these flux statistics . here",
    "we will use the statistical properties of the matter distribution , @xmath1 , to predict these observable quantities .",
    "there are a number of studies which predict the evolution of the clustering of density fluctuations , and in particular of the pdf .",
    "the zeldovich approximation ( za ) was used by kofman et al .",
    "( 1994 ) . althought",
    "the za reproduces important aspects of non - linear dynamics , it only results in a poor approximation to the pdf and its moments .",
    "this can be quantified by noticing , for example , that the hierarchical skewness @xmath2 in the za is @xmath3 ( at leading order in @xmath4 ) instead of the perturbation theory ( pt ) result @xmath5 ( see e.g. , peebles 1980 ) .",
    "one way to improve on this is to use the pt cumulants to derive the pdf from the edgeworth expansion ( juszkiewicz 1995 , bernardeau & kofman 1995 ) . in this case",
    "the pdf is predicted to an accuracy given by order of the cumulants involved .",
    "protogeros & scherrer ( 1997 ) introduced the use of a local lagrangian mapping ( that relates the initial and evolved fluctuation ) as a generic way to predict the pdf . in this case , the pdf is obtained simply by applying a change of variables ( the mapping ) to the pdf of the initial conditions .",
    "the best of these two approaches is obtained when the lagrangian mapping is taken to be that of spherical collapse ( fg98 ) , which recovers the pt cumulants to arbitrary order in the weakly non - linear regime .",
    "there is yet another possibility , which involves performing a perturbative expansion and directly relating the moments of the flux to the moments of the mass ( along the lines proposed in a different context by fry & gaztanaga 1993 ) .",
    "this approach does not use the density pdf , and could incorporate more exact calculations for the ( non - linear ) density moments .",
    "our plan for this paper is as follows . in section 2",
    "we outline the physical basis for the relation we adopt between  optical depth and the mass distribution . in section 3",
    "we describe our model for following the evolution of the pdf of the density and flux , using non - linear mapping relations presented in appendix a1 .",
    "the cumulants of the flux distribution predicted by fully non - linear dynamics are described in section 4 , together with the predictions of perturbation theory .",
    "the modelling of the effects of redshift distortions and thermal broadening is also described . in section 5 ,",
    "we compare our analytical results to those measured from simulated spectra , generated using n - body simulations . in section 6 , we discuss the effects of non - gaussian initial conditions , the redshift evolution of the one - point flux statistics , and the bias between flux and mass fluctuations .",
    "we also compare to other work on the statistics of the  forest flux .",
    "our summary and conclusions form section 7 .",
    "as mentioned in section 1 , the model we use to relate  absorption to the distribution of mass is motivated by the results of numerical simulations which solve the full equations of hydrodynamics and gravity , some including star formation in high density regions .",
    "it was found in these simulations ( e.g. , hernquist 1996 ) that most of the volume of the universe at high redshift ( @xmath6 , see dav 1999 for the situation at later times ) is filled with a warm ( @xmath7 k ) , continuous , gaseous ionized medium . fluctuations in this intergalactic medium ( igm ) tend to have overdensities within a factor of 10 of the cosmic mean and resemble morphologically the filaments , walls and voids seen on larger scales in the galaxy distribution at lower redshifts .",
    "the dominant physical processes responsible for the state of this igm and the  absorption produced by it were anticipated by semi - analytic modelling of the  forest ( e.g. , mcgill 1990 , bi , borner & chu 1992 ) . for completeness",
    ", we will summarize these processes below .",
    "the physical state of most of the volume of the baryonic igm is governed by the photoionization heating of the uv radiation background , and the adiabatic cooling caused by the expansion of the universe .",
    "the competition between these two processes drives gas elements towards a tight relation between temperature and density , so that @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the density of baryonic gas in units of the cosmic mean .",
    "this relation holds well in simulations for @xmath10 ( see e.g. , katz , weinberg & hernquist 1996 ) .",
    "hui & gnedin ( 1997 ) have explored the relation semi - analytically by considering the evolution of individual gas elements in the zeldovich approximation .",
    "they find that the value of the parameters in equation ( [ rhot ] ) depend on the history of reionization and the spectral shape of the radiation background , and should lie in the narrow range @xmath11 and @xmath12 .    the optical depth for  absorption , @xmath13 is proportional to the density of neutral hydrogen ( gunn & peterson 1965 ) . in our case , this is equal to the gas density @xmath14 multiplied by a recombination rate which is proportional to @xmath15 . by using equation ( [ rhot ] )",
    ", we find that the optical depth is a power law function of the local density : @xmath16 where @xmath17 is a distance along one axis , taken to the line - of - sight towards the qso ( we are working in real - space for the moment ) .",
    "because this result is simply a generalisation of gunn - peterson absorption for a non - uniform medium , it has been dubbed the fluctuating gunn - peterson approximation ( fgpa , see rauch 1997 , croft 1998a , weinberg 1998a ) .",
    "the fgpa amplitude , @xmath18 , is dependent on cosmology and the state of the gas so that ( e.g. , croft 1999 ) , @xmath19 here @xmath20 is the photoionization rate , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 is the ratio of the baryon density to the critical density . the fgpa slope , @xmath23 .    the fgpa has been tested in simulations ( croft 1997 , weinberg 1999 ) , and the predicted tight correlation found to hold well .",
    "the analysis in this paper will involve using equation ( [ tau ] ) to relate the optical depth to the underlying real - space mass density .",
    "we will make predictions for the observable quantity , transmitted flux in a qso spectrum , which we label @xmath24 : ( x ) & = & e^-a _ b(x)^. [ flux ] equation ( [ flux ] ) can be thought of as `` local biasing relation '' between the flux and mass distributions .",
    "it can be seen that in this relation , the only spatially varying quantity is @xmath25 ( ignoring global redshift evolution and assuming a smooth ionizing background ) .",
    "given that the physical processes included in the derivation of the fgpa relation are the dominant ones , then the clustering properties of the  forest should be determined mainly by the statistics of @xmath14 .",
    "the emphasis in this paper is therefore on applying our knowledge of the behaviour of density perturbations to the  forest .",
    "we will use analytical results for the non - linear evolution of density perturbations in an effort to understand the origin of the values of  forest observables .",
    "the ultimate aim is that with this understanding , measurements made from observational data can be used to directly test both the gravitional instability hypothesis , and the picture of the  forest outlined above , as well as throwing light on the nature of the primordial density fluctuations .",
    "an alternative to the approach we adopt here would be to use the local relation eq[[flux ] ] to directly reconstruct the density field , rather than to predict its cumulants or the cumulants of the flux .",
    "this reconstructed field could then be used to estimate the statistical properties of the density ( e.g. , cumulants ) in a straightforward way .",
    "this is not however simple to do in practice because of the saturation of flux in high density regions .",
    "although large changes in high density regions have little effect on the statistics of the flux ( i.e. the cumulants ) , they will totally change the statistics of the density .",
    "any reconstruction technique will therefore have to deal with this missing information somehow .",
    "one approach for dealing with this problem has been presented by nusser & haehnelt ( 1998 ) . in the present paper , we make use of the important fact that the power - law and exponential weighting of the density in the fgpa relation results in a flux distribution whose statistical properties are dominated by the small fluctuations , i.e. the linear or weakly non - linear regime .",
    "there are a number of assumptions concerning the relationsip between flux and mass which we should discuss before proceeding .",
    "first , the above equations apply to the density of gas , @xmath14 rather than the total density of matter , @xmath26 , which will be dominated by a dark matter component in the models we are considering . at the relatively low densities of interest here , the distribution of gas in simulations does however trace the dark matter well .",
    "pressure forces on gas elements tend to be small compared to the gravitational forces , and non - hydrodynamical n - body simulations can be used to produce very similar spectra to the simulations which include these pressure effects ( weinberg 1999 ) .",
    "simulations do have finite resolution limitations , though , and clustering in a dissipationless dark matter distribution with power extending to small scales can not be followed with infinite resolution . the n - body only calculations so far used ( e.g. , croft 1998a ) have a resolution comparable to the small scale smoothing produced by pressure effects .",
    "hydrodynamical simulations at high resolution ( e.g. , bryan 1998 ) can be used to study this smoothing . in the case of analytic work",
    ", one can first consider the linear regime . in this case , the power spectrum of fluctuations in the gas density , @xmath27 is a smoothed version of the dark matter power spectrum , @xmath28 , so that @xmath29^{2}}\\ ] ] where @xmath30 is the jean s wavenumber ( see e.g. , peebles 1993 ) . in tests of this result ,",
    "gnedin & hui ( 1998 ) have shown that after reionization , the effective smoothing length is generally smaller , and modelling with a different ( gaussian ) filter tends to give better results when compared with simulations .",
    "the situation in the non - linear regime will be more complicated .",
    "the jeans length scales as @xmath31 , but due to the temperature density relation of equation [ rhot ] , denser regions also tend to have higher temperatures , more thermal pressure , and more smoothing , so that the overall density dependence of the jean s length should be weak .",
    "gnedin & hui ( 1998 ) show that filtering the initial conditions of a dissipationless simulation with a single scale gives reasonable results compared to the full hydrodynamic case ( although worse than their `` hydro - pm '' technique , which involves adding a pressure term to the dissipationless simulation calculations ) . in our case , the analytic approximation for gravitational collapse which we use allows for filtering the evolved density with a top - hat filter in real - space ( see the next sections and appendix a1.2 ) . it may be possible to vary the smoothing length as a function of density , but for reasons of simplicity we use a constant smoothing radius for now . another possibility for the future might be self - consistent modelling of the hydrodynamic effects when following the evolution of density perturbations .",
    "this has been done numerically in 1d simulations of spherical collapse by haiman ( 1996 ) .",
    "second , the fgpa itself will break down in regions of high density , because of shock heating of gas , collisional ionization , star formation , and other processes .",
    "we can quantify this by appealing to the results of hydrodynamic simulations .",
    "as stated above , the relation has been directly tested by croft ( 1997 ) , who find that it works well at high redshifts , @xmath32 , on a point by point basis , for @xmath10 .",
    "when we consider statistics that we might want to measure from the flux distribution , the situation is even better .",
    "for example , we can see using the numbers given for @xmath18 above at @xmath33 and equation ( [ flux ] ) , that optical depth will saturate ( @xmath34 ) for @xmath35 .",
    "the physical processes occuring in regions with @xmath36 are therefore not likely to directly affect what we can measure",
    ". of course , there will be indirect effects , for example , supernova winds may inhomogeneeously heat the igm out into lower density regions . also , the reionization of heii , which is expected to occur around @xmath37 , may cause inhomogeneous heating if it is patchy enough ( miralda - escud and rees 1994 ) .",
    "although we expect the volume occupied by regions which do follow the fgpa to be overwhelming in the high - z universe , the statistical properties of the absorption predicted by analytical gravitational instability theory should be useful in testing the validity of this assumption .",
    "they should also help us decide if their is any appreciable contribution to clustering from spatial variations in the photoionization rate @xmath20 , due to the inhomogeneity in the uv background .",
    "any such variations are expected to be small in amplitude and to occur only on scales larger than we can probe directly at present ( see e.g. , zuo 1992 , fardal & shull 1993 , croft 1999 ) .",
    "third , we have so far only dealt with the density field in real - space , whereas measurements from qso spectra are made in redshift - space .",
    "both peculiar velocities and thermal broadening of absorption features should affect the statistics of @xmath24 to some degree .",
    "we will include both these effects in our predictions .",
    "we would like to make predictions for the one - point pdf of the flux @xmath24 and its moments .",
    "the one - point pdf of a given field @xmath24 is defined so that the probability of finding , at a random position @xmath17 , a value @xmath38 in the infinitesimal interval @xmath24 to @xmath39 , is @xmath40    to make these predictions we will first derive the corresponding probabilities @xmath41 , for the local matter overdensity @xmath42 , where @xmath26 is in units of the mean density @xmath43 .",
    "we will make indiscriminate use of either @xmath44 or @xmath1 as variables when describing density fluctuations .",
    "the second step is the assumption of a local relation with the form @xmath45 , ( motivated by equation [ [ flux ] ] ) .",
    "the pdf of the flux will then simply be obtained by performing a change of variables from the pdf of the density .",
    "we start by assuming a ( gaussian ) form for the pdf of the initial conditions , and then follow its evolution .",
    "as we will see , in our approach it is not necessary to assume gaussian initial conditions , and this procedure can be extended to some other non - gaussian models .",
    "we will do this with a model starting from @xmath46 initial conditions in section 6.1 .",
    "one important point to note about our predictions is that we are not creating artificial spectra but instead using an analytical model to evolve the density pdf and then predict the pdf of the flux directly . our predictions for the density distribution will depend on only two parameters , equivalent to the slope and amplitude of the linear correlation function on the smoothing scale , @xmath47 , and @xmath48 ( see sections 3 , 4 and appendix a1 ) .",
    "this will allow us to cover a wide range of possiblities , and make predictions that are as generic as possible .",
    "in this section we will also test the effects of varying the two parameters in the fgpa relation , @xmath18 and @xmath49 , which ( equation [ [ afacs ] ] ) contain information about the cosmic baryon density , ionizing background and reionization history of the universe .      in the limit of early times",
    ", we assume an nearly homogeneous distribution with very small fluctuations ( or seeds ) , with given statistical properties .",
    "we will concentrate on the case where the statistics of the initial density are well described by gaussian initial conditions , which correspond to a general class of models for the initial conditions .",
    "the one - point gaussian probability distribution of an initial field @xmath50 is given by : p_ic ( )   =  1   [ p1gic ]    as the overdensity must be positive , @xmath51 , we have that @xmath52 , and a gaussian pdf only makes physical sense when the initial variance is small : @xmath53 .",
    "because of gravitational growth , the evolution of @xmath50 will change the pdf from its initial form . for small fluctuations linear theory",
    "provides a simple way of predicting the time evolution of @xmath54 , where @xmath55 is the growth factor ( equal to the scale factor @xmath56 for @xmath57 ) , and @xmath58 is the initial field .",
    "we will denote this linear prediction by @xmath59 .",
    "for gaussian initial conditions the linear pdf is also gaussian with a variance @xmath60 , given by scaling the initial variance @xmath61 by @xmath62 , so that @xmath63 .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , there are a number of studies which predict the evolution of the pdf beyond linear theory . here",
    "we will consider a generic class of local mappings along the lines introduced by protogeros & scherrer ( 1997 ) .",
    "the idea is for us to relate the non - linear fluctuation @xmath64 ( in lagrangian space ) with the corresponding linear fluctuation @xmath65 using a universal ( local ) function . to simplify notation we choose to express this mapping as a relation between the non - linear overdensity @xmath66 and the linear fluctuation @xmath59 , so that    \\(q ) = .",
    "[ eq : mapping ]    one such mapping is the spherical collapse model ( sc ) or shear - free approximation . for gaussian ic , the sc approximation happens to give the exact statistical properties of the density ( cumulants of arbitrary order ) at leading order in perturbation theory ( as found by bernardeau 1992 in the context of the cumulant generating function ) , and provides a very good approximation to higher orders ( see fg98 ) .",
    "physically , this mapping corresponds to taking the limit where shear is neglected . in this case",
    "the equations for the growth of @xmath50 , in lagrangian space , are identical to those given by spherical collapse .",
    "so , in the perturbative regime , the sc is the best mapping possible , given the local assumption made in equation ( [ eq : mapping ] ) .",
    "the local transformation naturally occurs in lagrangian space @xmath67 ( comoving with the initial fluid element ) .",
    "the important point to notice here is that although the local mapping is not the exact solution to the evolution of @xmath50 ( which is in general non - local ) , it does give the correct clustering properties in the weakly non - linear regime . in the appendix",
    "we give some specific examples for the transformation @xmath68 .",
    "the one - point pdf induced by the above transformation , in terms of the initial one - point pdf @xmath69 , is p_l ( ) = p_ic(_l ) |d_l| , where @xmath70 $ ] .",
    "as mentioned before , the above expression corresponds to the probability distribution of the evolved field in lagrangian space , @xmath67 . to relate lagrangian and eulerian probabilities we use the law of mass conservation : @xmath71 , where @xmath72 is the overdensity in eulerian coordinates .",
    "we therefore have p ( ) = 1 p_ic(_l ) |d_l| , [ nlpdf ] where @xmath73 is a normalization constant .",
    "we will show some of these predictions in section [ sec : sim ] ( e.g. , fig .",
    "[ pdf2 ] ) .",
    "we next assume a local transformation which relates the underlying smoothed overdensity to some observable quantity @xmath24 :    = f ( ) [ bk ] this quantity can further be related to the linear density field , so that    = f[(_l ) ] .",
    "the pdf of @xmath24 will then related to that of the density by a simple change of variable : p ( ) = p ( ) |d| = 1 p_ic(_l ) |d_l| , [ fluxpdf ] where @xmath74 $ ] and @xmath75 $ ] .",
    "thus , given the transformations @xmath76 and @xmath68 , the above equations provide us with analytical ( or maybe numerical ) expressions for the pdf of @xmath24 .",
    "in the present work , we concentrate on the cumulants ( see section [ sec : pdf ] for a definition ) of the flux , rather than the pdf itself .",
    "the reason for this is that , given the local assumption , the cumulants are more accurately determined ( see section [ sec : pdf ] for more details ) .",
    "nevertheless , we will see in section [ sec : sim ] that the above prediction gives a good qualitative description of the pdf ( see e.g. , fig .",
    "[ fpdf ] ) .      the smoothed flux and its corresponding optical depth @xmath77 has been assumed to be a local function of the _ smoothed _ non - linear density @xmath26 .",
    "the optical depth @xmath13 at a given real - space position along the line of sight @xmath78 will lie at a redshift - space position @xmath79 in a qso spectrum :    s = r + v_r / h , where @xmath80 is the component of the smoothed peculiar velocity along the line of sight at @xmath78 .",
    "note that the redshift distortion is of the smoothed field , where the smoothing , due to finite gas pressure , occurs in real - space .",
    "the redshift mapping will conserve optical depth , @xmath81 , so that we have : _ s = |dr| = | 1 + 1 dv_r |^-1 .",
    "in general , the relation between @xmath82 and @xmath26 will be complex .",
    "however , in the sc model , spherical symmetry leads to a great simplification : = 1 v h , as , by symmetry , derivatives are the same in all directions ( this idea has also been used by fg98 and by scherrer & gaztaaga 1998 ) .",
    "we can now again use the local mapping to relate velocity divergence to the linear field : @xmath83 $ ] , as in equation ( [ theta ] ) .",
    "thus we have that the redshift optical depth is given by a different mapping : _ s ( ) = ( ) |1 + 1 ( ) |^-1 . [ tauz ]",
    "the redshift - space flux is simply : _",
    "s= exp[-_s ( ) ] , [ phiz ] and its pdf can be computed with a simple change of variables : p(_s ) = 1 p_ic(_l ) |d_l| .",

    "we note that for small values of the fluctuation amplitude , @xmath251 tends towards the values predicted by perturbation theory ( section 4.3 ) . for larger values , such as those likely to be encountered in observations , a fully non - linear treatment , such as the one presented here ,",

    "the results of fg98 indicate that the statistics of the weakly non - linear density moments are dominated by the local dynamical contribution to the evolution of the pdf , and shear forces are subdominant ( they tend to cancel out when taking the mean ) .",

    "this is an interesting result because although the sc model is better motivated from the theoretical point of view , the gza model is much simpler to implement . in particular",
    "the gza model provides us with analytical expressions for the pdf ( i.e. , equation [ [ gzapdf ] ] and fig .",
    "[ fpdf ] ) , which can be used in practice to make the predictions .",
    "as shown in fosalba & gaztaaga ( 1998b ) the sc approach to modelling non - linearities does not work as well for @xmath132 as for @xmath26 .",
    "in particular , it was found that the next to leading order ( or loop ) non - linear corrections are not as accurate , indicating that tidal effects are more important for @xmath132 .",
    "this could partially explain why the redshift distortion modelling ( see fig .",
    "[ zflux ] ) requires the addition of an extra velocity dispersion in order to match the results of simulations .",
    "the first attempts to constrain cosmology using the  forest focussed on comparisons between simulated data generated with specific cosmological models and observational data , using traditional line statistics .",
    "when the simulated and observed spectra are decomposed into a superposition of voigt - profile lines , the distribution of column densities of these lines and the distribution of their widths ( `` b - parameters '' ) can be reasonably well reproduced by gravitational instability models ( e.g. , dav 1997 , although see bryan 1998 ) . in the context of these models ,",
    "the line parameters do not have a direct physical meaning , as these statistics were intended to describe discrete thermally broadened lines .",
    "it is possible to use these traditional statistics to characterise the amount of small scale power in the underlying density field , for example ( see e.g. , hui , gnedin & zhang , gnedin 1998 ) .",
    "however , statistics which are more attuned to the continous nature of the flux distribution and the underlying density field have advantages , as well as promising to be more sensitive discriminants , continous flux statistics can be designed to be less affected by noise and choice of technique than profile fitting .",
    "as the modern view of the  is essentially an outgrowth of structure formation theory , it makes sense to borrow statistical analysis techniques used in the study of the galaxy distribution . unlike the galaxy distribution ,",
    "however , the  forest offers a truly continuous distribution of flux , with no shot noise ( albeit in 1 dimension ) , and a well motivated theoretical relationship between the observed flux and the underlying mass .",
    "so far , analysis of spectra using such continuous flux statistics has mainly involved specific cosmological models , and direct comparison of simulations with observations . the mean flux , @xmath93 is the most obvious flux statistic to calculate .",
    "its measurement from observations has been carried out by several authors ( e.g , press , rybicki & scheider , 1993 , zuo & lu 1993 ) , and there is an extensive discussion in the literature about what is usually quoted as the mean flux decrement , @xmath252 , or the mean effective optical depth , @xmath253    the probability distribution of the flux has been investigated by miralda - escude ( 1996 ) , croft ( 1996 ) , cen ( 1997 ) , rauch ( 1997 ) , zhang ( 1998 ) , and weinberg ( 1998 ) .",
    "other statistics such as the two point correlation function of the flux have been introduced ( zuo & bond 1994 ) , the power spectrum of the flux ( croft 1998a , hui 1999 , the two point pdf of the flux ( miralda - escud 1997 ) , and the number of times a spectrum crosses a threshold per unit length ( miralda - escud 1996 , croft 1996 , weinberg 1998 ) .",
    "methods have been developed to reconstruct properties of the underlying mass distribution , such as the matter power spectrum ( croft 1998a , hui 1999 , using our theoretical assumptions for the relation between mass and flux .",
    "a technique for carrying out a direct inversion from the flux to the mass distribution has been described by nusser and haehnelt ( 1998 ) . in the present paper ,",
    "we emphasise the use of statistics which have been used extensively in the study of galaxy clustering , in particular the higher order moments ( e.g. , gaztaaga & frieman 1994 ) . these statistics , and their behaviour",
    "when used to quantify the evolution of density perturbations in the quasil - linear regime have been the subject of much attention .",
    "it would seem that extending their use to the study of the  forest may offer us a good chance to combine our knowledge of gravitional instability with that of the igm and in doing so make progress in both disciplines .    on the predictions side",
    ", many pieces of analytic work have been carried out which incorporate the dominant physical processes involved in producing high - redshift  absorption ( processes summarized in section 2 ) .",
    "the studies most important differences have been in the schemes used to follow the evolution of density perturbations .",
    "these have included linear theory ( bi 1993 , bi , ge & fang 1995 ) the lognormal approximation ( gnedin & hui 1996 , bi & davidsen 1997 ) , and the zeldovich approximation ( mcgill 1990 , reisennegger & miralda - escud 1995 , hui , gnedin & zhang 1997 ) . unlike these approximations , the sc model used in this paper is able to reproduce exactly the perturbation theory results for clustering",
    ". this accuracy makes it useful for calculating high - order statistics of the flux , in our search for the signatures of gravitational instability .",
    "it is important to realize that we have not used the sc model to make simulated qso  spectra , but that we have used its predictions for the properties of the mass to predict the statistics of the  flux .",
    "with such an approach ( similar to that taken by reisennegger & miralda - escud 1995 ) we can quickly and easily vary parameters in order to explore for example the dependence of a particular statistic on redshift ( section 6.2 ) . some tasks which previously required numerical simulations , such as finding the bias between density and flux fluctuations ( e.g. , croft 1998ab ) ,",
    "can be carried out analytically .",
    "the fully non - linear analysis we have described in this paper will allow one to carry out many analyses of clustering where the precise relationship between the statistics of the mass and the flux is important .",
    "this includes attempts to constain the cosmic geometry from the clustering measured between adjacent qso lines of sight ( e.g. , mcdonald & miralda - escud 1999 hui , stebbins & burles 1999 . in such situations , a non - linear theory of redshift distortions in the  forest and of the bias between the fluctuations in the observed flux and the mass , such as we have presented in this paper should be very useful .",
    "we have presented a fully non - linear analytical treatment of the one - point clustering properties of the high - z  forest in the gravitational instability scenario .",
    "the formalism we have presented should prove to be a useful tool for studying the forest , and has immediate application to the calculation of two - point statistics ( see paper ii ) .",
    "the two main ingredients we have used are the spherical collapse model ( sc ) or shear - free approximation for the evolution of density perturbations , and the fluctuating gunn - peterson approximation for the relation between density and  optical depth .",
    "the predictions for the one - point clustering of the mass made using the sc model depend only on two parameters , @xmath48 and @xmath47 . these are , respectively , the linear variance of density fluctuations , and the local slope of the linear correlation function . in the fgpa ,",
    "the relation between the mass distribution and  forest optical depth is largely governed by one parameter , @xmath18 , which can be set by appealing to observational measurements of the mean flux .",
    "the predictions of the sc model for the density are typically quite non - linear ( @xmath254 or more ) .",
    "while these predictions are not expected to be accurate for the high density tail of the distribution , the weighting of the fgpa relation means that the statistics of the flux are governed by the ( quasi - linear ) density regime where the sc @xmath255 accurate .",
    "the  forest is therefore well suited to study using such an approximate analytical technique .",
    "we note that the analytical predictions can be used in tests of the picture of  forest formation and the applicability of the fgpa . with the extra information afforded by the two - point statistics and considering the evolution of clustering as a function of redshift",
    ", it will be possible to look for the signatures of any deviation from the theroretical picture .",
    "consistency tests for the gravitational instability scenario include checking the evolution of the moments as a function of redshift , the scaling of the hierarchical moments , and their dependence on scale .",
    "we plan to use our predictive techniques in future work to extract information from observations , using both one - point and two - point statistics . in the present paper , we have concentrated on developing an analytical framework for studying the clustering of the transmitted flux in the forest region of qso spectra .",
    "some of the results of our present exploration of one - point statistics include the following :    @xmath256 using our formalism we are able to estimate the bias between mass and flux fluctuations without resorting to simulations .",
    "+ @xmath256 we can make predictions for the clustering properties of the   forest flux in both gaussian and non - gaussian models .",
    "we find large differences between the two in an example case .",
    "+ @xmath256 in the limit of small fluctuations , our non - linear analytical treatment converges to the same results as those from perturbation theory calculations .",
    "+ @xmath256 for larger fluctuations , where perturbation theory is no longer valid , we find our treatment to give accurate results compared to statistics evaluated from n - body simulated spectra .",
    "these predictions are most accurate when the linear variance of the density field is @xmath257 and below . for values above this ,",
    "the qualitative behaviour of the high order moments is reproduced .",
    "+ @xmath256 we can follow the evolution of the one - point statistics of the flux as a function of redshift . we find that the difference between predictions for different cosmologies is small , so that comparison with observations should be useful in constraining the evolution of the ionizing background intensity . + @xmath256 if we normalise our predictions so that the mean flux is held fixed ( for example to the observed value ) , we find that the statistics of the flux are relatively insensitive to the effects of redshift distortions induced by peculiar velocities or thermal broadening .",
    "this is most valid for the higher order normalised hierarchical moments .",
    "+ the high-@xmath247  forest is amenable to study using analytical treatments , a fact which gives it great value as a probe of structure formation .",

    "the important point to notice here is that although the local mapping is not the exact solution to the evolution of @xmath50 ( which is in general non - local ) , it gives the correct clustering properties in the weakly non - linear regime .",
    "this is because of the symmetry involved in taking the ensemble average @xmath261 ( bernardeau 1992 ) .",
    "this is also a good approximation for next to leading terms ( fg98 ) and also for non - gaussian initial conditions ( gaztaaga & fosalba 1998 ) .",

    "the statistics of the ic must be given as an input to estimate the corresponding evolved , non - linear , values after gravitational growth .",
    "this is also true for the smoothed case , so that the shape and amplitude of the initial variance must be given or set by hand. consider first the case were we want the initial fluctuations smoothed within a radius @xmath288 , to have a power - law variance : ^2 = _ 0 ^ 2 ( r)^ , where @xmath292 and @xmath293 relates to the `` unsmoothed '' amplitude . in the linear regime",

    "( r)^/2 = _ l ( r)^/2 , where @xmath55 is the gravitational growth factor and @xmath294 is some ( unsmoothed ) initial seed whose variance is @xmath293 , so that in the limit @xmath295 we have @xmath296 .",
    "on the other hand , in the local picture of evolution , a given fluid element @xmath290 is isolated , so that for a mean density @xmath297 , the smoothed overdensity is : = m_0 = ( r_0)^3 , [ srho ] as the ic are perfectly homogeneous ( @xmath298 ) , and the mean density @xmath297 does not change with time .",
    "puting the above equations together we have : = ( _ l ) ^6/ , [ srhodl ] which shows that smoothing acts like a ( implicit ) lagrangian mapping .",
    "thus , given the unsmoothed mapping @xmath299 , we can find the corresponding smoothed mapping by solving the implicit relation :    = , [ smap ] where @xmath47 is the slope of the initial or linear smoothed variance : = d. [ slopedef ] this can be easily generalized to non power - law relations and reproduces the original result of bernardeau ( 1994 ) .          in principle , the smoothing in @xmath26 is difficult to implement analytically for the sc , because @xmath68 is given by the implicit relations eqs.[[sc1]]-[[sc2 ] ] .",
    "however , the smoothing can be carried out easily in terms of the smoothed @xmath59 , simply by noticing that from the above relation ( equation [ [ srhodl ] ] ) we have : _ l [ ] = _ l [ ] , [ hatdel ] where @xmath266 is such that @xmath300 $ ] .",

    "the unsmoothed case corresponds to @xmath110 .",
