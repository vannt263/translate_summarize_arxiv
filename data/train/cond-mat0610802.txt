    "the current upsurge of interest in metal - based as well as semiconductor - based spintronics materials mainly originates from their increasing applications in the giant magnetoresistance ( gmr ) as well as the tunneling magnetoresistance ( tmr ) based memory devices  @xcite .",
    "common to all these devices is the requirement of controlled transfer or injection of spin - polarized current from a ferromagnet into a normal metal  @xcite or a semiconductor  @xcite .",
    "for such a spin transport to be effective , it is mandatory to maintain a relative imbalance between spin - up and spin - down electrons that are available at fermi level , @xmath2 . by definition , degree of spin polarization , @xmath0 ,",
    "is described as the extent to which the transport current is spin polarized .",
    "depending on the degree and asymmetry of spin - splitting , different values of @xmath0 , ranging from @xmath3 for a conventional ferromagnetic metal such as fe to @xmath4 for the so - called half - metallic systems  @xcite have been reported . in the latter ,",
    "all the transport current is carried by either spin - up or spin - down electrons .",
    "heusler alloys  @xcite , chalcopyrites  @xcite are the best examples of half - metallic ferromagnets whose magnetic behaviour as well as electronic structure have been extensively studied both experimentally and theoretically .    in practice ,",
    "the spectroscopic techniques , such as spin - polarized photoemission  @xcite , point contact andreev reflection ( pcar )  @xcite and tunnel junction ( tj )  @xcite , are widely used to probe @xmath0 at @xmath2 of a ferromagnet . however , except for the case of half metallic systems , different experiments may measure different values of @xmath0 for the same candidate material  @xcite .",
    "the reason is that , in a realistic experiment , the observed tunneling current is dependent on both the mean free path of electrons in the ferromagnet , @xmath5 , and the characteristic size of the contact @xmath6 .",
    "if @xmath6 is smaller than the electron mean free path @xmath5 , the electrons flow through the contact ballistically . in the opposite case , when @xmath7 , they perform a diffusive motion .",
    "consequently , the obtained values of @xmath0 , in each regime , can be considerably different . in this connection",
    ", it is important to compare the measurements with the appropriate calculations , mimicking the experiment in question .    within the classical bloch - boltzmann theory  @xcite",
    ", @xmath0 can be defined as @xmath8 where @xmath9 are the spin - dependent current densities , passing through the contact . neglecting the state - dependent transmittance of the barrier at the point of contact ,",
    "mazin  @xcite has formulated a more practical definition for @xmath0 as , @xmath10 where , @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the density of states ( dos ) at @xmath2 and fermi velocity of electrons with spin @xmath13 ( @xmath14 or @xmath15 ) , respectively .",
    "interestingly , all the quantities in eq .",
    "[ mazin ] are related to the band structure of the ferromagnet .",
    "furthermore , this definition allows direct comparison between different experiments and theory . in the simplest case of @xmath16 , the spin polarization calculated from eq .",
    "[ mazin ] ( @xmath17 ) is in accordance with that measured by spin - resolved photoemission techniques .",
    "correspondingly , it can be shown that , the transport experiments , such as pcar and tj , measure a higher order of @xmath18 ( @xmath19 or @xmath20 ) which includes the fermi velocity ( see eq .  [ mazin ] ) . in the ballistic regime ( @xmath21 ) , following sharvin s approach  @xcite or landauer - btikker formalism  @xcite , one can easily prove that the conductance of the contact @xmath22 and , consequently @xmath23 are proportional to @xmath24  @xcite .",
    "thus , the experimentally observed @xmath0 in the ballistic regime is expected to be equal with @xmath25 . on the other hand , using bloch - boltzmann equation , one can prove that , @xmath22 and , consequently @xmath23 in the diffusive regime ( @xmath7 ) are proportional to @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the relaxation time  @xcite .",
    "hence , assuming the same @xmath28 in both spin channels , the spin polarization observed by transport techniques in diffusive regime , is expected to be in accordance with @xmath29 .",
    "computationally , it is rather difficult to calculate @xmath30 for @xmath31 .",
    "the problem is due to the presence of gradient term @xmath32=@xmath33 , which makes calculations very sensitive to the number of @xmath34points , used for sampling the brillouin zone .",
    "consequently , in most of the theoretical works , it is preferred to compare experimental data with the calculated @xmath17 .",
    "however , such a comparison may lead to a misleading conclusion in describing the transport properties of the material under consideration . in this work",
    ", we present a simple and general approach , based on the so called tetrahedron method  @xcite , for evaluating @xmath18 in both ballistic and diffusive limits with high accuracy .",
    "first , the details of the method will be explained and then the accuracy of @xmath18 values for fe and ni will be examined by comparing our results with the experiment . finally , as a case study ,",
    "the transport properties of the recently discovered soft ferromagnet cemnni@xmath1 are investigated , in order to find out the underlying reasons for the pronounced difference between the experimental  @xcite and theoretical  @xcite values of @xmath0 in this particular intermetallic compound .",
    "as a general definition , the expectation term of eq .",
    "[ mazin ] , @xmath35 , can be expressed as  @xcite , @xmath36 where , @xmath37 is the energy of an electron in the band @xmath38 with spin @xmath13 and the wave vector @xmath39 . at this point , to avoid any confusion , we neglect the subscripts @xmath38 and @xmath13 and simplify the integration part of eq.[ballusive ] as , @xmath40 where , a(*k * ) corresponds to @xmath41 .    for evaluation of the integral @xmath42 over fermi surface , @xmath43 , we consider the following scheme : first we define an equispaced grid in reciprocal space on which the lattice vectors of submesh are obtained by dividing a set of primitive reciprocal vectors by the integers @xmath44 , @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "then , utilizing the monkhorst - pack method  @xcite a set of irreducible @xmath47points from @xmath48 is chosen for which the eigenvalues of energy , @xmath49 , are calculated . for the @xmath47points , which are not in the irreducible part of reciprocal space , symmetry can be used to determine their corresponding @xmath49 in the irreducible zone .",
    "next , each subcell is divided into six tetrahedra of same volume .",
    "as illustrated in fig  [ fig : tetrahedron ] , we choose one main diagonal of a subcell as common edge of all six tetrahedra . in order to minimize interpolation distance ,",
    "the shortest main diagonal is chosen .",
    "additionally , each tetrahedron is defined by its four corners , one of which is , without any restriction of generality , at the origin , @xmath50 , and the remaining three are at @xmath51 @xmath52 . with some rearrangement , the four @xmath51 are ordered so that their calculated eigenvalues @xmath53 obey the inequality @xmath54 .",
    "finally , within each tetrahedron , @xmath55 is interpolated by a linear function , @xmath56 where , @xmath57 can be described in terms of @xmath53 and @xmath58 . in this order ,",
    "the triple @xmath59 , contragradient to @xmath58 are defined as , @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the volume of subcell , @xmath62 , and @xmath59 satisfy the constraint , @xmath63 .",
    "using eq .",
    "[ ri ] , @xmath57 can be expressed as , @xmath64    back to integral  [ tetint ] , @xmath65 can be written as a function of @xmath57 , @xmath66 . accordingly , @xmath42 over one tetrahedron becomes , @xmath67 and the integration reduces to the following simple form , @xmath68 where @xmath69 is the cross section of the plane @xmath55 with the tetrahedron ( see fig  [ fig : tetrahedron ] ) . inserting eq .",
    "[ ri ] into eq .",
    "[ bvector ] and using the shorthand notation @xmath70 for @xmath71 , one can easily prove that @xmath72 becomes , @xmath73 if @xmath74 , @xmath75\\left|{\\bf b}\\right|^{n }      \\label{line2}\\ ] ] if @xmath76 , and @xmath77 if @xmath78 .",
    "here , it is important to point out that , within the improved tetrahedron method , proposed by blchl et al .",
    "@xcite , the linear interpolation in eq .",
    "[ line2 ] can be modified as , @xmath79\\nonumber\\\\ % & &",
    "\\\\      \\label{line2b}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] accordingly , throughout this work eq .",
    "[ line2b ] has been considered instead .    at the last step ,",
    "summation over @xmath72 from contributing tetrahedra results in the evaluation of integral @xmath42 . here",
    ", it is crucial to point out that , the dependence of @xmath72 on the geometry of tetrahedrons for @xmath31 , implies that the summation should be carried out over all tetrahedra in the reciprocal space , otherwise a misleading error will occur in the evaluation of the integrals .    in the following ,",
    "we apply this prescription to calculate @xmath18 for a number of ferromagnetic materials , using their electronic band structure obtained from the first - principles calculations .",
    "while our method is quite general and applicable to any system , we first present some benchmark calculations of @xmath17 , @xmath25 and @xmath29 for bcc - fe ( a@xmath80  ) and fcc - ni ( a@xmath81  ) , and compare the results with the experimental data , available in the literature  @xcite .",
    "then , we compare the @xmath18 values for cemnni@xmath1 obtained from the current method with those reported in previous theoretical investigations  @xcite as well as experiment  @xcite . here",
    ", we focus on the transport spin - polarization of cubic cemnni@xmath1 ( a@xmath82  ) containing 4 formula units i.e. 4 ce , 4 mn and 16 ni atoms . for the generated irreducible @xmath83points ( see discussion above ) the eigenvalues , @xmath37 , of all the available energy bands , @xmath38 , at @xmath2",
    "are calculated in both spin channel @xmath13 and used for evaluating @xmath18 .",
    "all the first - principles calculations are carried out using the local spin density approximation ( lsda ) method with projector - augmented wave ( paw ) potential , as implemented in the vasp code  @xcite .",
    "details of the electronic structure calculations have been published elsewhere  @xcite .",
    "table  [ tab : spinp ] summarizes the @xmath0 values for fe , ni , and cemnni@xmath1 , as obtained from our calculations ( @xmath18 , @xmath84 ) , and as obtained from pcar and tj measurements ( @xmath85 and @xmath86 , respectively ) . here , we first concentrate on the transport properties of fe and ni . for both bulk",
    "ferromagnetic metals , the table indicates an excellent agreement between @xmath25 ( @xmath29 ) and @xmath85 ( @xmath86 ) values .",
    "such an agreement indicates that , the experimental measurements of @xmath85 and @xmath86 for both metals have been carried out in ballistic and diffusive regimes , respectively .",
    "fortunately , the details of the corresponding experiments explicitly confirm this statement  @xcite .",
    "lccccccc & & +   + [ 0.5pt ] structure & @xmath17 & @xmath25 & @xmath29 & @xmath87 & @xmath88 & @xmath85 & @xmath86 + [ 2pt ] + fe & @xmath89 & @xmath90 & @xmath91 & @xmath92 & @xmath93 & @xmath94 & @xmath95 + ni & @xmath96 & @xmath97 & @xmath98 & @xmath99 & @xmath100 & @xmath101&@xmath102 + cemnni@xmath1 & @xmath103 & @xmath104 & @xmath105 & @xmath106 & @xmath107 & @xmath108&@xmath109    furthermore , from table  [ tab : spinp ] , one immediately notices two different trend of spin polarizations between fe and ni . in the former ,",
    "the differences between @xmath17 , @xmath25 and @xmath29 values are moderate while in the latter , such differences are so considerable that leads to a change in the sign of @xmath29 .",
    "the reason can be explained in terms of the electronic band structure of transition metals at the fermi level . in general , the fermi surface of transition metals can be distinguished in two areas .",
    "the first area is characterized by the @xmath110electrons which can be regarded as highly mobile carriers with non - localized wavefunctions and high fermi velocity , @xmath12 .",
    "in contrast , the second area is made by electrons which are relatively localized in partially occupied @xmath111like states with a large effective mass and low @xmath12 .",
    "thus , it is expected that , the @xmath111like states dominate @xmath11 and , consequently , @xmath17 , while the  _ light _ \" @xmath110electrons contribute substantially to the averaged values of fermi velocity , @xmath112 . as a result , @xmath25 and @xmath29",
    "may change dramatically if such a contribution in one spin channel is much larger than that in the opposite one ( e.g. if @xmath113 ) .    for a better understanding ,",
    "we illustrate in figures  [ fig : fe ] and  [ fig : ni ] , both spin polarized total and @xmath110projected dos , @xmath114 and @xmath115 , respectively , as well as the sharvin conductance , @xmath116 , and the plasma frequency , @xmath117 for fe and ni , respectively .",
    "in fe , it is evident that , both @xmath114 and @xmath115 are relatively larger than their corresponding spin - down values .",
    "thus , the obtained spin polarizations in all limits are positive ( @xmath118 ) . additionally , figure  [ fig : fe]-a indicates a large @xmath119 hybridization in both spin channels , implying that the averaged fermi velocities , @xmath87 and @xmath88 should not be very different .",
    "hence , the weighting factors , @xmath120 and @xmath121 , in eq .",
    "[ ballusive ] do not considerably change @xmath25 and @xmath29 in comparison with @xmath17 , as noted in table  [ tab : spinp ] and can be seen in figure  [ fig : fe]-b .    on the other hand",
    ", ni behaves differently . in this case , the spin - up @xmath111bands are fully occupied and deeply located below @xmath2 , so that there is almost no spin - up @xmath111state at @xmath2 , whereas , the spin - down @xmath111bands are partially occupied and have a significant contribution to the @xmath122 ( see figure  [ fig : ni]-a ) .",
    "this leads to a large negative polarization of dos , ( @xmath123 ) . here",
    "again @xmath124 .",
    "however , unlike in fe , the difference between the averaged fermi velocities is so considerable that according to table  [ tab : spinp ] , @xmath87 is almost four times larger than @xmath88 .",
    "this can be attributed to the fact that in the absence of  _ heavy _ \" @xmath111electrons , @xmath125 is mainly @xmath110like and , hence , the transport carriers are expected to be very mobile with high @xmath12 , while in the spin - down channel , the carriers are dominantly @xmath111like and almost immobile in transport . in the other word , although the number of electrons at @xmath2 in spin - up channel is much smaller than that in spin - down channel ( @xmath126 ) but they have more tendency to contribute to the transport ( @xmath127 ) .",
    "consequently , such an effect results in a significant change in @xmath25 and @xmath29 values ( see figure  [ fig : ni]-b ) . due to the same reason",
    ", the sign reversal in @xmath29 is also expected .",
    "having confirmed the accuracy of our method , we next investigate the transport properties of cemnni@xmath1 .",
    "both experiment  @xcite and theory  @xcite indicate that , this intermetallic compound is a soft ferromagnet with a large magnetic moment ( @xmath128/mn ) and reasonably high curie temperature ( @xmath129 ) .",
    "however , there is a significant difference in the experimental and theoretical values of @xmath0 .",
    "pcar measurements by singh et al .",
    "@xcite yield a relatively large spin polarization , @xmath130 , whereas the previous first - principles calculations , using both lsda and lsda+u methods , have estimated much lower values for @xmath0 , varying from @xmath131 to @xmath132  @xcite .",
    "additionally , our calculations on this particular material reveal a metallic nature with a very low degree of spin polarization . according to table  [ tab : spinp ] ,",
    "both @xmath25 @xmath133 and @xmath29 @xmath134 are extremely far from the experimental data .",
    "this implies that , it is not possible to realize , through the calculations , whether the @xmath85 measurements have been carried out in ballistic or diffusive regimes .",
    "however , it may also imply that such a high degree of spin polarization is unlikely to be achieved in pure cemnni@xmath1 .    from the electronic structure point of view",
    ", the smallness of @xmath18 values is due to an insignificant difference between @xmath125 and @xmath122 as well as @xmath87 and @xmath88 .",
    "to elucidate this situation , we have shown both total and partial dos of cemnni@xmath1 around @xmath2 in figure  [ fig : dsp ] .",
    "the figure clearly indicates that @xmath125 is slightly smaller than @xmath122 and , hence , the calculated @xmath17 turns out to be a small negative value .",
    "also , it is evident from the corresponding partial dos , @xmath135 and @xmath136 , that the @xmath111 and @xmath137like states dominate @xmath11 in both spin channels .",
    "consequently , most of the electrons available at @xmath2 , either @xmath111 or @xmath137ones , are  _ heavy _ \" and can not effectively contribute to the spin - induced transport .",
    "thus , the averaged fermi velocities @xmath112 are expected to be very small and close to each other , as denoted in table  [ tab : spinp ] .",
    "interestingly , our calculations reveal that both @xmath138 and @xmath88 are even relatively ( considerably ) lower than the corresponding values in fe ( ni ) .",
    "the effects , described above , lead to this conclusion that the pure cemnni@xmath1 is more likely a _",
    "semi_-metal with poor spin induced transport properties .",
    "that is why the calculated @xmath17 , @xmath25 and @xmath29 are so small and somehow negligible . here",
    ", it is worth mentioning that , the slight difference between @xmath87 and @xmath88 in cemnni@xmath1 are due to the fact that the contribution of @xmath110like states to @xmath125 is slightly larger than that to @xmath122 ( see figure  [ fig : dsp]-a ) .",
    "it is important to point out that , although the obtained @xmath18 values at @xmath2 are substantially smaller than the experimental data , but for changes of the fermi level by approximately 0.1 ev , values close to experimentally ones for @xmath17 and @xmath25 are reached ( see figure  [ fig : dsp]-b ) .",
    "experimentally , this situation can occur if there is a small stoichiometric variation in the sample .",
    "for example , as noted in ref .",
    ", if during the process of preparation , small amount of mn ( e. g. @xmath139 ) is replaced by ni one may expect a considerable change in the electronic structure and hence the transport properties of the chemically disordered structure .",
    "in the other word , since the exact experimental conditions of synthesis of cemnni@xmath1 is still not completely understood , it might be possible to attribute the measured @xmath85 value to a sample , containing small amount of impurities , defects or chemical disorders .",
    "thus , we suggest further studies on the role of stoichiometric variations on the transport properties of cemnni@xmath1 .",
    "a general and accurate scheme based on tetrahedron method for determining the degree of spin polarization in ferromagnets has been presented .",
    "our approach has successfully shown to yield highly accurate spin polarization results both in ballistic and diffusive regimes , with the least number of _ k-_points and the modest computational efforts .",
    "the benchmark calculations on bulk fe and ni have proven the efficiency of the method in reproducing the experimental data in different regimes .",
    "it turned out that the spin polarization in a ferromagnet is dependent on both the number and the type of transport carriers in each spin channel .",
    "that is , the more the contribution of @xmath110electrons to the density of states in one spin channel , the higher is the degree of spin polarization in both ballistic and diffusive regimes .",
    "finally , in agreement with previous first - principles calculations , the obtained spin polarization in cemnni@xmath1 indicated a remarkable difference with the experimental data .",
    "the reason was attributed to the strong @xmath140 hybridization in both spin channels , leading to a reduction in contribution of @xmath110electrons to the spin induced current .",
    "it was suggested that the possible presence of off - stoichiometery in the sample might be responsible for such a discrepancy .",
