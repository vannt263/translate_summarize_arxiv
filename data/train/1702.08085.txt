    "in the present paper , we investigate the dynamics of the following nonlinear schrdinger ( nls ) model : @xmath0 here , @xmath1 is the unknown complex field , subscripts denote partial derivatives , and constants @xmath2 describe gain or loss ( see below ) .",
    "we supplement eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) with the periodic boundary conditions for @xmath3 : @xmath4 for given @xmath5 , and with the initial condition @xmath6 also satisfying the periodicity conditions  ( [ eq2 ] ) .",
    "equation  ( [ eq1 ] ) is one of the most fundamental nls models incorporating linear and nonlinear gain / loss effects .",
    "in particular , the parameter @xmath7 describes linear loss ( @xmath8 ) [ or gain ( @xmath9 ) ] , while @xmath10 describes nonlinear gain ( @xmath11 ) [ or loss ( @xmath12 ) ] .",
    "the presence of these effects is physically relevant in the context of nonlinear optics @xcite : in this context , @xmath7 describes a linear absorption ( @xmath8 ) [ or linear amplification ( @xmath9 ) ] , while @xmath10 stands for nonlinear amplification ( @xmath11 ) [ or gain saturation - two photon absorption ( @xmath12 ) ] . generally , for physically relevant settings , such terms play a crucial role in the stability of solitons potentially rendering them attractors for the dynamics .",
    "note that the integrable limit of @xmath13 , i.e. , the conservative nls equation , possesses soliton solutions ; in the case of the self - focusing nonlinearity considered herein , there exist bright soliton solutions that decay to zero at infinity .",
    "apart from bright solitons , and again in the integrable version of eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) , there exists still another important class of solutions : a rational solution , namely the peregrine soliton ( ps ) , as well as space- or time - periodic solutions , referred to as the akhmediev and kuznetsov - ma ( kmb ) breathers , respectively .",
    "these solutions have emerged from the seminal works of peregrine  @xcite , kuznetsov  @xcite , ma  @xcite , and akhmediev  @xcite , as well as dysthe and trulsen  @xcite . in recent years",
    ", the aforementioned wave structures are receiving increasing attention , due to their argued potential relevance towards the mathematical description of extreme events and rogue waves @xcite .",
    "the interest in these solutions is justified by many relevant experimental observations in various physical contexts , ranging from hydrodynamics @xcite and nonlinear optics @xcite , to superfluidity @xcite and plasmas @xcite .",
    "an important question concerns the robustness of rational solutions in the presence of integrable and non - integrable perturbations . in selected special cases ,",
    "it was found  @xcite , that the ps can still be identified in hirota - type variants of the original nls equation ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite for relevant work in higher - order nls models ) .",
    "however , in broader classes of non - integrable perturbed nls models , this remains a significant open problem .",
    "another approach towards exploring the robustness of these excitations relies on the connection with the kmb state .",
    "the latter , is periodic in the evolution variable and , in the limit of infinite period , reduces to the ps .",
    "the dynamical robustness of kmb against dispersive or diffusive , higher - order perturbations was studied by means of a perturbed inverse scattering transform approach @xcite . in the latter work , it was shown that kmb is rather robust against dispersive perturbations , but it is strongly affected by dissipative ones . in another related recent",
    "work @xcite , a floquet stability analysis of the kmb was performed in the integrable nls , attempting via the approach to the infinite period limit to shed light to the stability features of the ps state .",
    "more relevant to our concerns in the present work , are recent contributions studying the role of driving and linear loss .",
    "reference @xcite , for instance ( see also references therein ) , investigates the effect of wind and dissipation on the nonlinear stages of the modulational instability ( mi ) in the context of water waves @xcite .",
    "further extensions considering the case of strong wind ( whose effect is of the same order as the wave steepness ) , are given in ref .",
    "this approach , allows for the construction of approximate rational solutions for the considered model .",
    "the effects of slow / strong linear forcing in the statistics of extreme events , were also studied @xcite .",
    "it was highlighted therein , that when the forcing is short in time and effectively strong , it facilitates the occurrence of extreme wave conditions .",
    "at this point , it is important to note that the mi of background plane waves ( which host the rational solutions ) , may lead to homoclinic - type solutions , which can also considered as candidates for rogue waves @xcite .",
    "such phenomena have been observed and analyzed in a variety of extended nls models , that incorporate higher - order dissipative or dispersive effects ( pertinent studies also include the dysthe model @xcite ) .    in this work",
    ", we aim to examine a rather different question , related to the ps .",
    "in particular , its algebraic spatiotemporal localization , motivates us to study the dynamics of eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) for initial data with an algebraic decay rate .",
    "our plan is as follows .",
    "first , we identify analytically the regimes defined by the gain / loss parameters where the solutions may exhibit finite time collapse , vanishing decay , or nontrivial ( non - decaying ) dynamics .",
    "the latter are captured by an attracting set for all initial conditions in the infinite dimensional space .",
    "then , we proceed to examine , by means of direct numerical simulations , the evolution of algebraically decaying initial data in the prescribed dynamical regimes .",
    "our main findings are summarized below .    to begin , crucial differences are detected between the dynamics corresponding to asymptotically vanishing or non - vanishing initial data . for vanishing initial conditions , we observe the strong collapse / decay of the resulting waveforms @xcite .",
    "the collapse is manifested by the local increase of amplitude which grows towards the singularity , while decay is manifested by a flattening , leading towards convergence to the trivial state . on the other hand",
    ", nonvanishing initial conditions exhibit a weak type of collapse / decay . in weak collapse ,",
    "as time progresses , a fraction of the wave approaches the singularity with long tails left behind . in our case , these tails consist of a multi - hump , non - collapsing wave - train of solitonic structures , occupying a finite spatial interval of increasing length as time increases .",
    "collapse occurs through time - oscillations of increasing amplitude of the central localized waveform . in the decay regime ,",
    "a multi - peak wave pattern forms , and eventually the amplitude decays .",
    "the second finding is , that in all the above gain / loss parametric regimes , spatiotemporal algebraically decaying structures emerge transiently .",
    "the evolution of these structures is reminiscent , for a finite interval , of that of the ps of the integrable nls limit . to examine the spatiotemporal growth and decay rates of these extreme events ,",
    "we implement effective fitting arguments , as in ref .",
    "@xcite , comparing the profiles of the numerical solutions of the problem ( [ eq1])-([eq3 ] ) , with the evolving profiles of the ps of the integrable nls limit .",
    "both in the collapse and decay regimes , the appearance of these structures is associated with the weak collapse / decay of the solutions .    in the limit - set regime @xmath14 , we observe the generation of extreme events in distinct dynamical regimes : the suitable localization of the initial data results in the emergence of a ps - type structure at an early stage , seeding subsequently the mi .",
    "the monotonicity properties of the evolution of suitable functionals , combined with the continuous dependence on the initial data , is complemented by numerical findings on the evolution of the centered density , in partially rationalizing the observations of the ps - like structures .",
    "we remark that , in the full decay @xmath8 , @xmath12 , and limit - set regime @xmath9 , @xmath12 , the emergence of the above structures persists up to numerically detected critical values @xmath15 .",
    "the existence of such critical values , shows that the appearance of extreme events may occur when the nls model ( [ eq1 ] ) is sufficiently close to its integrable limit ( but not for arbitrary ranges of gain and loss ) .",
    "the summary of the above observations is that the dynamics of eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) serves as a case example suggesting that a corroboration of the appropriate spatial localization of the initial data , with suitable energy dissipation / source effects , could be a potential mechanism for the emergence of extreme events in nonintegrable nonlinear dispersive systems .",
    "the paper is structured as follows . in section  ii , we present an overview of analytical considerations on the problem ( [ eq1])-([eq3 ] ) . in section  iii ,",
    "we report the results of our numerical simulations .",
    "finally , in section  iv , we summarize and discuss the implications of our results with an eye towards future work .",
    "in this section , we describe analytically the global dynamical regimes driven by the gain / loss strengths @xmath7 and @xmath10",
    ". it will be also important for analyzing the dynamics , to comment on the modulation instability ( mi ) of continuous waves ( cw ) . since our analysis is also valid for weak solutions , it is important to recall the following local - in - time existence and uniqueness result , whose proof is now considered as standard @xcite :    [ thmloc ] let @xmath16 for any integer @xmath17 , and @xmath18 then there exists @xmath19 , such that the problem ( [ eq1])-([eq3 ] ) , has a unique solution @xmath20 moreover , the solution @xmath21 depends continuously on the initial data @xmath16 , i.e. , the solution operator @xmath22 is continuous .    here ,",
    "@xmath23 denote the sobolev spaces of @xmath24- periodic functions on the fundamental interval @xmath25 $ ] .",
    "we recall for the sake of completeness their definition : @xmath26 we also recall that @xmath27 , for @xmath28 , stands for the dual space of @xmath29 , i.e. , the space of bounded linear functionals on @xmath29 .",
    "the description of the gain / loss dynamical regimes is based on energy arguments .",
    "these arguments consider the evolution of an energy functional , namely : @xmath30 stemming from the `` power balance '' equation : @xmath31 satisfied by any sufficiently smooth , local - in - time solution of theorem  [ thmloc ] .",

    "furthermore , an extended dynamical system @xmath44 is defined , whose orbits are bounded for all @xmath45 . for any bounded set @xmath46 , @xmath32 , its @xmath47-limit set @xmath48 , is weakly compact in @xmath49 , and compact in @xmath50 .",

    ".    for our computations below it is relevant to mention that , in the collapse regime , the functional @xmath55 is strictly monotonically increasing , i.e. , @xmath56 on the other hand , in the decay regime , the average power @xmath57:=\\frac{1}{2l}\\int_{-l}^{l}|u(x , t)|^2dx$ ] is strictly monotonically decreasing , namely : @xmath58<p_{a}[u(0)],\\;\\;\\mbox{for all}\\;\\;t\\in [ 0,\\infty).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] it is also worth noticing that from the definitions of the analytical upper bounds for collapse times , ( [ a1a ] ) and ( [ a2a ] ) , it follows that @xmath59 $ ] is finite for @xmath60 .",
    "then , the limit @xmath53=+\\infty$ ] , suggests that if @xmath11 , then the critical value @xmath61 acts as a critical point separating the two dynamical behaviors : collapse in - finite - time for @xmath60 , and global existence for @xmath62 .",
    "in the present work , we have considered the dynamics of a nonlinear schrdinger ( nls ) model , incorporating linear and nonlinear gain / loss , and supplemented with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "the model finds applications in nonlinear optics , where it describes evolution of pulses or beams in optical media with gain and loss ( e.g. , linear gain or loss , two - photon absorption , etc ) .",
    "we started our exposition by outlining the parametric regimes for the existence of a nontrivial ( attracting ) limit set , decay , and finite time collapse .",
    "then , we examined numerically , in all the above regimes , the dynamics stemming from initial data with algebraic localization .",
    "the two broad classes of initial data considered were those decaying to zero and those converging to a finite background .",
    "collapse and decay were explored in both regimes and significant differences between them were found .",
    "in particular , for the former case of initial conditions the solution preserves its structural form during decay , or develops almost strong collapse . for the latter case of initial data",
    ", the solution decays without preserving its form , or is subject to a weak - type of collapse .",
    "the emerging profiles at the early stage of the evolution were analyzed by considering the combination of the monotonicity properties of suitably defined functionals and the modulational instability of the background .",
    "it was thus found that oscillatory central density dynamics can occur , as shown in our detailed numerical simulations .",
    "furthermore , in a broad array of gain / loss parametric regimes , we have identified the emergence of transient , spatiotemporally localized waveforms reminiscent of the peregrine soliton ( ps ) of the integrable nls limit .",
    "indeed , in a diverse array of scenarios , we have exhibited temporal , as well as spatial growth and decay rates that are highly proximal to pss for finite time intervals .",
    "this strongly suggests that the peregrine structures remain highly relevant for the dynamics beyond their `` exact '' realm of the integrable limit .",
    "that being said , upon sufficient departure from that parametric range , the gain / loss appear to overwhelm the dynamics and destroy the potential of manifestation of ps - type structures .",
    "thus , the above results suggest that the main message of this work is the following : for suitable initial data , even in the presence of energy gain and/or loss effects , extreme events reminiscent of the ideal peregrine soliton may still appear and play a critical role in the dynamics .",
    "this main finding , can be schematically depicted in two ways .",
    "the first , is illustrated in the top panel of fig .",
    "[ fig11 ] : an initial condition @xmath63 , may evolve towards a waveform reminiscent of the ps , achieving its maximum at @xmath64 . the weighted subspace @xmath65 of the infinite dimensional phase space @xmath66 for the extended dynamical system associated to eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) , describes the algebraic spatial localization of the initial condition .",
    "the second , can be portrayed in the `` phase diagram '' of the system shown in the bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ fig11 ] . a potentially existing ps - type solution [ dashed - dotted ( blue ) curve ] ,",
    "is marked by @xmath67 .",
    "it can be visualized as a `` homoclinic loop '' connecting the unstable background of density @xmath68 .",
    "the solution @xmath67 is an element in the weighted subspace @xmath69 , which is a potential domain of attraction for such solutions .",
    "an initial condition @xmath70 , can be selected to start nearby the orbit @xmath67 .",
    "this , follows a path @xmath71 [ continuous ( magenta ) curve ] , which remains close to the orbit @xmath67 , for a _ finite - time interval_.    in this picture , the ultimate fate of the path @xmath71 , depends on the selected parametric regime for @xmath7 , @xmath10 . in the decay regime , the path @xmath71 stays close to the orbit @xmath67 for a finite time interval , but then diverges through the branch @xmath72 [ continuous ( magenta ) curve ] , to the trivial state @xmath73 . in the collapse regime",
    ", the path @xmath71 stays close to the orbit @xmath67 for shorter times , and then diverges towards collapse , through the branch @xmath74 [ dotted ( red ) curve ] .",
    "finally , in the limit set regime , the path @xmath71 stays close to the orbit @xmath67 for a finite interval , and then , it converges to the nontrivial attracting set @xmath48 , through the branch @xmath75 [ dashed ( green ) curve ] .",
    "the present study , opens a number of questions for future investigations .",
    "an important one , concerns the development of analytical approximations to determine such ps - type solutions , or the derivation of analytical estimates on the spatiotemporal growth / decay rates observed numerically .",
    "this is part of the broader question regarding the persistence of rational solutions in models beyond the integrable limit , such as the one of the nls and , e.g. , of the massive thirring model  @xcite .",
    "another interesting and relevant direction , is to explore the possibility of generalizing this approach to other models , such as extended nls equations incorporating higher - order effects @xcite , or even to discrete setups @xcite .",
    "appreciating the robustness of rogue waves under both perturbations in initial data and perturbations in the models / parameters is thus currently a broader theme under consideration , and relevant conclusions will be reported in future work .",
