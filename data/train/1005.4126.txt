    "the accuracy of measurements of brightness of astronomical objects is affected by many factors .",
    "it is clear that they are influenced in different ways depending on the applied photometric techniques .",
    "one of these effects is the stellar scintillation caused by _ optical turbulence _ ( ot ) in the earth s atmosphere . unlike other variations of the atmospheric transparency ,",
    "the light fluctuations due to the scintillation do not correlate for the images separated by more than the isoplanatic angle ( @xmath1 in the optical range ) .",
    "therefore , errors introduced by this effect appear always and increase when the brightness of two stars is compared .",
    "this problem was noted and studied a long time ago @xcite .",
    "recently , interest in this problem manifested itself again , but in the overall context of a study and characterization of the ot in various astronomical observatories and prospective sites .",
    "in the paper @xcite a special index @xmath0 have been introduced to relate the vertical distribution of the turbulence and wind speed to the variations of the light flux as measured in a large telescope .",
    "monitoring of this parameter and its analysis is very useful for comparing different sites and for predicting or planning of photometric observations .",
    "however , the approach used in cited work implies prior restoration of the ot profiles from the mass  multi aperture scintillation sensor @xcite data and the use of additional information on wind speed . this is a very intensive procedure , besides burdened by additional errors    in this paper we propose a method to determine the index @xmath2 directly from the mass measurements without using additional information .",
    "the presented method is preceded by a theoretical consideration of the scintillation in the temporal domain .",
    "the approximation of weak perturbations implies the independence of the wavefront distortions produced in a turbulent layer from the turbulence located above it .",
    "this leads to the fact that the scintillation index @xmath3  the variance of relative fluctuations of the light intensity , is described by the sum of the scintillation indices produced by individual layers : @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the _ weighting function _ ( wf ) which depends on the size and shape of the receiving aperture and does not depend on the altitude distribution of the structural coefficient of the refractive index @xmath6 .",
    "wf represents a power of the scintillation generated by a layer of unit intensity located at a height @xmath7 .",
    "the mass method involves simultaneous measurement of the scintillation indices in 4 concentric apertures of different diameters , leading to 4 normal and 6 diffential scintillation indices .",
    "the vertical ot profile is restored from the measured indices and the theoretically calculated wfs @xcite .",
    "the calculation of the set of functions @xmath5 assumes that the light intensity measurement has a `` zero exposure '' , i.e. the averaging factor is related only to the receiving aperture .",
    "this is not quite true in real measurements , so the problem of finite time of the measurement was considered separately by @xcite .",
    "the question of the quantitative effect of averaging on the scintillation was considered in many papers , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "we consider below this problem using the terminology of the mass theory @xcite and the results given by @xcite and @xcite in order to obtain formulas more convenient for practical application .",
    "it is obvious that the variance @xmath8 of the relative fluctuations of the light intensity measured with finite exposure time is determined by the integrated effect of all turbulent layers on the line of sight , as in the case of zero exposure ( [ eq : is ] ) , but the wfs will be different .    assuming that the temporal evolution of the distorted wavefront is described by its translation ( taylor s @xcite hypothesis of the frozen turbulence ) by @xmath9 , we can describe the effect of temporal averaging by a convolution of the receiving aperture with a line of wind shift in the spatial domain @xcite . in calculating the wf as integral of the filtered spatial power spectrum of scintillation , an additional multiplication by the temporal averaging filter appears .",
    "the new wfs @xmath10 will depend not only on the layer altitude @xmath7 , as previously , but also on the wind speed @xmath11 and averaging time @xmath12 .",
    "@xmath13 where @xmath14 is the modulus of spatial frequency , @xmath15 is the aperture filter ( axi - symmetric for the mass apertures ) and @xmath16 is the additional spectral filter of the wind shear along the axis @xmath17 , which is the square of the fourier transform of the rectangular window of the size @xmath18 . in polar coordinates it can be written as @xmath19 where the function @xmath20 can be expressed through the bessel functions @xmath21 and @xmath22 and the struve functions @xmath23 and @xmath24 ( the definition of struve functions can be found in @xcite ) : @xmath25 the behavior of this function is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : tau1 ] .",
    "although the paper of @xcite does not provide the analytical expression of this function , its correct asymptotic was given .",
    "we only refine the interval of the asymptotic . for small @xmath26 , the function @xmath27 , as follows from its series expansion in the neighborhood of 0 .",
    "the quadratic approximation provides accuracy better than 0.02 until the @xmath28 . when @xmath29 , the function @xmath30 , and starting from @xmath31 the relative difference is less than 0.04 .",
    "the asymptotic behavior of the function at @xmath32 and @xmath29 can be used to describe the two limiting cases : the short exposure and long exposure regimes .",
    "the regime of short exposure @xmath33 have been analyzed in detail by @xcite .",
    "classical astronomical photometry almost always works in the approximation of the long exposure @xmath34 . in this situation",
    ", @xmath35 and one can use the asymptotics @xmath36 .",
    "then the wf looks like @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the value of the integral over spatial frequency .",
    "note that the integrand has no singularities and is integrable without any problems , as well as in the zero - exposure case .",
    "if @xmath39 , it tends to 0 , justifying the use of this approximation .",
    "it is evident that the wf @xmath10 has a simple structure and the scintillation power averaged over exposure @xmath12 is defined by the following expression : @xmath40 in terms of mass the method , this expression has a very convenient form that allows , in principle , to determine the vertical distribution of @xmath41 from measurements made in a long - exposure regime . note that the approximation of long exposure is valid at lower values of @xmath12 for small apertures , such as in the mass device .    in the limiting case of infinitely small aperture @xmath42",
    "can be obtained using the fact that @xmath43 and changing the variables @xcite . for the opposite case of large aperture @xmath44 ( fresnel scale @xmath45 )",
    ", the function @xmath38 can be calculated by replacing the fresnel filter @xmath46 with @xmath47 , as done by @xcite .",
    "turning to the dimensionless frequency @xmath48 , we find that @xmath49 or @xmath50 if @xmath51 and @xmath52 , this expression represents the index @xmath53 introduced in paper @xcite .    in the case of long exposures , the dependence of scintillation on airmass @xmath54 ( or zenith angle ) is obvious : @xmath55 .",
    "however , in the formulas ( [ eq : long1 ] ) and ( [ eq : long2 ] ) @xmath56 is the component of the wind velocity perpendicular to the line of sight . naturally , the wind speed is normally directed horizontally .",
    "if the azimuth of the wind differs from the azimuth of the line of sight by @xmath57 , then the perpendicular component is simply equal to the absolute speed . if the wind direction coincides with the plane of the line of sight , then perpendicular component is @xmath58 and the dependence of @xmath59 on the airmass increases to @xmath60 .",
    "the dependence of the scintillation power on azimuth was described by @xcite .",
    "the value @xmath53 is the variance of the stellar scintillation measured at 1  m telescope with 1  s exposure .",
    "the main point of the method for calculating the index @xmath0 ( needed for estimating the photometric accuracy on large telescopes ) directly from the mass data is that @xmath53 is represented as a linear combination of long - exposure scintillation indices at different apertures of the mass device . unlike the instantaneous indices @xmath3",
    ", they will be denoted as @xmath8 .    in the mass data processing",
    ", the so - called atmospheric moments are calculated .",
    "in particular , the second moment is @xmath61 the problem of approximation of the @xmath62 dependence is solved in the mass data processing by a linear combination of the wfs @xmath5 .",
    "the case under study here differs only in that the approximation of @xmath62 must be done with a set of @xmath38 functions , having the dimension of @xmath63 .",
    "a set of @xmath38 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : up ] .",
    "these functions are similar to the usual wfs , but are more smooth owing to the suppression of high spatial frequencies .",
    "it is clear that the time - averaged scintillation are much smaller .",
    "therefore , the values of the functions @xmath64 and @xmath65 differ by about 2 orders of magnitude . both sets of wfs are computed for the polychromatic case with the spectral curve of the original mass device and an a0v star .",
    "the curve for the a aperture differs slightly from the wf of an infinitely small aperture at @xmath66 m ( effective wavelength ) . strictly speaking , the limiting behavior for large apertures is also valid for the monochromatic case .",
    "for example , the real @xmath38 for the photometric band @xmath67 grows with @xmath7 more slowly .",
    "moreover , telescope central obscuration also slows the growth of @xmath38 .",
    "however , unlike the case of short exposure , these effects are small . even for a 0.3-m aperture ,",
    "the ratio of @xmath38 to @xmath68 differs from 1 by no more than 5% at 12  km altitude for the r band and with the central obscuration of 33% . in the case of a 0.5-m telescope ,",
    "all the differences do not exceed 2% at all altitudes .",
    "for a rough estimate of the @xmath0 index one can use an evaluation of @xmath8 from measurements in the d aperture of the mass device .",
    "although its diameter is about 11  cm and the central obscuration is more than 50% , the corresponding wf aproximates the quadratic dependence quite well .",
    "the maximum difference is achieved at high altitudes ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : appr ] ) and is @xmath6925% at the tropopause altitude .",
    "this means that the @xmath0 error will not exceed @xmath7015% .",
    "the accuracy of the quadratic approximation can be significantly improved by representing the wf of a 1  m telescope as a linear combination of functions @xmath38 . in table",
    "[ tab:0 ] the coefficients of this expansion are listed .",
    "the coefficients @xmath71 are obtained by the decomposition on the whole set of @xmath38 functions , @xmath72  only on the 4 functions corresponding to normal indices in apertures a , b , c and d. both approximations are shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : appr ] , where the ratios of the approximated function to @xmath68 are plotted .",
    "it is clear that both approximations provide a similar accuracy , better than 5% , over the entire range of altitudes 0.5  30  km , and better than 2% in the tropopause region . for the mass / dimm instrument",
    "the situation is slightly worse because the typical size of the aperture d is 8  cm and the central obscuration is larger .    in view of the linear relation between the indices and their corresponding wfs ( [ eq : long2 ] )",
    "the following formula is correct : @xmath73 and the calculation the @xmath0 index reduces to the measurement of the variance of the flux in the mass apertures averaged over 1  s.    lrrrrrrrrrr & a & b & c & d & ab & ac & ad & bc & bd & cd    ' '' ''     + @xmath71    ' '' ''    & -0.0200 & -0.0080 & 0.0160 & 0.0975 & 0.0057 & 0.0050 & -0.0060 & 0.0153 & 0.0106 & 0.0216 + @xmath72 & -0.0005 & -0.0090 & 0.0007 & 0.0907 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 +",
    "the required quantities are not calculated by the mass software during measurements . however , all the necessary information is stored in the output files .stm , where the intensities in apertures a , b , c and d averaged over 1-s exposure are recorded .",
    "note that these values in the file are given for the 1-ms exposure , in fact the counts are @xmath74 and , consequently , the contribution of the photon noise is small .",
    "unfortunately , for a typical 1 minute acquisition time there are only 60 measurements .",
    "therefore , the relative accuracy of the computed variance is approximately 25% . for more accurate values ,",
    "further averaging ( over 4-minute interval ) is needed .",
    "selection of valid data presents some problems because the fluctuations on 1-s temporal scale can include significant intensity changes of another origin  due to changes in transparency , clouds , or large guiding errors .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     a combination of the wfs @xmath38 that grows with @xmath7 slower than @xmath62 ( e.g. linearly ) can be found .",
    "however , since the wfs of the normal scintillation indices increase with altitude faster than @xmath75 , such approximation causes a noticeable increase in the noise .",
    "it is preferable to use the temporal index in the a aperture ( @xmath76 ) and the atmospheric moment @xmath77 , computed from the indices @xmath3 . in any case",
    ", the dominant layer will be located lower than in the case considered above and the ratio similar to the formula ( [ eq : estim ] ) is likely to reflect the wind speed in the tropopause .",
    "a method to obtain statistical prediction of photometric accuracy based only on the data from the mass instrument is proposed .",
    "comparison of the results obtained by this method and by integration of the ot and wind profiles @xcite can be used to verify wind models above astronomical sites .",
    "it is particularly interesting to perform such a comparison for the measurements with mass instrument performed in antarctica at dome c , as described in @xcite .",
    "there is some concern that their data censoring procedure , leaving only 16% of useful data , may bias the @xmath0 estimates .",
    "an ability to estimate wind speed at pressure level of 70  100  mbar directly from the mass data will help to check the applicability of the wind models and will avoid biases caused by replacing instantaneous values by their statistical estimates .",
    "additionally , we note here that 1-s averaging time in the case of mass apertures is too long .",
    "a regime of the long exposure with the relevant asymptotics starts at shorter exposures on the order of 0.1  0.2  s , and the use of such short time would markedly improve the accuracy and reliability of the temporal index .",
    "the behavior of wfs @xmath38 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : up ] ) indicates that by using a set of precise measurements of temporal indices and the restored @xmath6 profile , a reasonable solution of the system equations like ( [ eq : long1 ] ) for the unknowns @xmath78 may be achieved .",
    "realization of this possibility will permit 1 ) to obtain additional information about the current state of the turbulent atmosphere , and 2 ) to correct more precisely the mass / dimm data for the effects of finite exposure time .",
