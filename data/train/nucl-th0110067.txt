    "we imply the attractive interaction between pairs of nucleons on time - conjugate orbitals .",
    "it is widely accepted that the pairing interaction is responsible for creating a superconducting paired state , however the realistic interaction is much more diverse than bare pairing .",
    "the complex interplay of all interactions that still leads to a paired state is far from being understood .",
    "coherence between the pairs or even larger groups of nucleons can be formed in different quantum states , furthermore coherence may appear in the particle - hole ( @xmath1 ) channel with other components of interaction contributing to collective excitations ( in nuclei - shape vibrations and giant resonances ) and deformation of the mean field .",
    "all these effects are expected to dynamically and/or kinematically effect the paired state .",
    "there are also incoherent components of the interactions that introduce the stochastization of dynamics , but still can be influenced by the presence of collective features in dynamics .",
    "the appearance of a paired state is traditionally attributed to the strong short - range residual interactions between nucleons . however , in realistic nuclear systems all interaction matrix elements are correlated .",
    "there is no pure pairing interaction .",
    "it is well known in the theory of superconductivity , and in application to nuclear structure it has been shown by belyaev @xcite long time ago , that an interaction with only pairing matrix elements would contradict the fundamental principle of gauge invariance .",
    "recent studies of systems with two - body random interactions @xcite indicate that survival of collective phenomena such as pairing in realistic systems may hinge on these correlations between different types of matrix elements .",
    "these studies have shown that the paired ground state does not appear in systems governed by two - body random interactions ; furthermore , even weak but uncorrelated interactions of non - pairing type are very destructive with respect to the pairing state .",
    "mesoscopic nature is yet another important property of nuclear systems .",
    "it has strong effect on kinematics and geometry of collective modes , interplay between different excitations and phase transitions .",
    "finiteness was argued to be one of the main reasons for existence of the superconducting state in realistic nuclei @xcite .    in this work",
    "we show that observed pairing effects in nuclei do not result just from strong pairing matrix elements .",
    "paired state appears from a very complex interplay of all residual interactions and their dynamic and kinematic behavior . throughout this work we use a simple single @xmath0-level model with only one species of particle in order to discuss this interplay",

    "we introduce an important concept of kinematic pairing as specific pairing effects that appear from kinematic restrictions present in a mesoscopic many - body system ; they also contribute to dynamics of nucleon - phonon interaction @xcite . with numerical studies",
    "we show that those effects , ignored in the standard p+q model , result in a significant enhancement of pairing and directly influence the observable quantities , such as energy spectra , moments of inertia , and intensities of multipole transitions . for the systems with a nearly half - occupied shell , where the transition from oblate to prolate deformation takes place , pairing can be further enhanced due to the fact that in average the spherical shape tends to be restored in this region .",
    "the mean field is recognized as one of the most effective approaches in study of quantum many - body systems . along with the shape and symmetry properties of the average many - body potential ,",
    "the mean field also determines quantum numbers of elementary excitations , the quasiparticles .",

    "the intrinsic feature of interactions describing realistic systems is the presence of correlations between different interaction parameters .",
    "these correlations , along with kinematic features , such as discussed above and other dynamic couplings , is what makes the pairing effects survive and even dominate in the low - lying states of many realistic nuclei .",
    "as discussed above , the most general hamiltonian can be separated into three parts , quasiscalar , quasivector and a second rank tensor in quasispin . the perturbation theory based on pairing treats exactly all quasiscalar and quasivector components . since all odd multipoles are quasiscalars , only those non - pairing interactions that can be expressed in terms of the multipole operators of an even order , starting from @xmath184 are of interest as the most orthogonal to pairing .",
    "this leads to the hamiltonian @xmath185    the lowest possible @xmath186 multipole is responsible for quadrupole deformations and is usually the most energetically favorable .",

    "each of them separately is known to be responsible for collective phenomena , however acting simultaneously they lead to an interesting interplay .",
    "the study of pairing versus deformation within p+q model is usually carried out with hartree - bogoliubov ( hb ) technique @xcite .",
    "in fact the model is often defined as an arena for application of the hb method @xcite , ignoring exchange terms and previously discussed kinematic limitations .",

    "the fact that quadrupole part contributes to pairing as well as to all other components in the @xmath12 or @xmath1 channel , and that pairing makes a contribution to the quadrupole part is not seen explicitly . in order to observe these kinematic couplings we will reduce the form of the hamiltonian ( [ hpandq ] ) with projection operators to a unique form where conditions ( [ onel_rel ] ) are satisfied .",
    "we rewrite the hamiltonian ( [ hpandq ] ) in the following form @xmath190 removing the unphysical part with the projection operation , @xmath191 thus @xmath192 in particular , the monopole part is @xmath193 and there is a renormalization of the quadrupole strength which in the large @xmath194 limit behaves as @xmath195 in the particle - particle channel we have @xmath196 eq .",

    "the above expression indicates that if @xmath194 is very large then only @xmath205 and @xmath206 do not scale as @xmath207 , which leads to the usual p+q model @xcite with effectively decoupled quadrupole and pairing modes .",
    "this is not surprising because kinematic pairing as well as other kinematic couplings have mesoscopic geometry of nuclear systems as a source .    in the p+q model",
