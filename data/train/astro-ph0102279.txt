    "several other recent studies have attempted to ascertain the underlying total abundance patterns ( and thus the nucleosynthetic histories ) of some qsoals by adjusting the observed gas phase abundances for an assumed level and pattern of depletion ( e.g. , kulkarni , fall , & truran 1997 ; vladilo 1998 ) .",
    "such studies depend , however , on the assumption that the dust depletion patterns in the qsoals resemble those found in our own galactic ism  i.e. , that they are independent of metallicity .",
    "studies of the abundances and physical conditions in the ism of the magellanic clouds  nearby systems of low metallicity and low dust - to - gas ratio ( similar to some qsoals ) for which stellar abundance data are also available  can provide a significant test of that assumption .",

    "2000 ) , aligned , and co - added .",
    "sections of the individual spectra affected by noise bursts were excised before co - addition .",
    "no significant differences were found between spectra obtained during orbital night and those obtained during the day , so all the spectra were combined .",
    "as the sic channels were poorly aligned during these observations , we consider only the lif channels , which span the wavelength range from 988 to 1187  .",
    "the summed spectra were then re - binned to approximately optimal sampling at the achieved resolution r = @xmath14/@xmath15 @xmath12 12,000 ( @xmath16 @xmath12 25 km s@xmath8 ; see below ) , as shown in figure  [ fig : fullspectrum ] .",
    "the lif 1a segment is roughly centered on the stellar p cyg profile and the interstellar lyman @xmath17 absorption line ; numerous sharp interstellar and broader stellar absorption lines are evident in both segments ; the very broad , shallow depression centered on about 1155    is a known optical anomaly ( sahnow et al .",
    "regions near absorption lines of interest were normalized via low - order polynomial fits to the adjacent continuum regions .",
    "the s / n in the summed , re - binned spectrum , determined from those continuum fits , ranges from about 20 to 40 .",
    "examination of saturated lines and comparisons between daytime and night - time data indicate that both scattered light and airglow lines are negligible",
    ". additional spectra of sk 108 obtained subsequent to improvements in focus and channel alignment  thus characterized by somewhat higher resolving power and including both lif and sic channels  will be discussed in a future paper ( mallouris 2001 , in preparation ) .",

    "( 1977 ) and welty , hobbs , & york ( 1991 ) , in order to obtain column densities for the various species detected in the far - uv spectra . in the fits , we assume that the _ fuse _ instrumental profile may be approximated by a gaussian function , and we use the rest wavelengths and oscillator strengths tabulated by morton ( 1991 ; with updates in welty et al",
    ". 1999b ) . because of the relatively low spectral resolution achieved , the detailed component structure derived in paper i from the ghrs echelle spectra ( 9 galactic and 16 smc components , with @xmath18-values 2.0 - 4.5 km s@xmath8 ) can not be discerned in these _ fuse _ spectra .",
    "we therefore adopted the component structures derived from the higher resolution ( fwhm @xmath12 4.2 km s@xmath8 ) near - uv spectra of , , , and ( representing ranges in depletion behavior ) to model the unresolved absorption line profiles of similarly distributed atomic species seen in the _ fuse _ spectra . in view of the generally good correlation between @xmath1 ( ) and @xmath1(h@xmath2 ) found in the galactic ism ( federman 1981 ; welty & hobbs 2001 ) , we used the component structure derived from moderately high resolution ( r = 60,000 ) spectra of the d lines ( welty et al . , in preparation ) to model the absorption from the numerous transitions of molecular hydrogen , using the h@xmath2 rest wavelengths and oscillator strengths listed by morton & dinerstein ( 1976 ) .",
    "while we had hoped to at least determine total column densities for each of the five component groups , small - scale uncertainties in the _ fuse _ wavelength scale ( see below ) generally limited us to estimates for the total galactic ( g1 + g2 ) and total smc ( s1 + s2 + s3 ) column densities .",
    "consequently , the line widths ( @xmath18-values ) of all 25 components and the relative velocities and relative column densities of the galactic and smc components ( separately ) were fixed in the fits  which thus yielded velocity offsets and total column densities for both the galactic and the smc absorption .",
    "the fits to the numerous far - uv and h@xmath2 profiles also yielded both estimates for the resolution characterizing these _ fuse _ spectra and corrections to the default wavelength scale .",
    "the detailed component structure for should be particularly well determined , as it is based on a mutually consistent fit to ghrs echelle spectra of the lines at 2260 and 2586  , which differ from each other by a factor of 30 in @xmath19 ( paper i ) .",
    "fits to the profiles of additional lines in the far - uv ( generally of intermediate strength ) , assuming that component structure , therefore enabled us to estimate the resolution achieved in the _ fuse _ spectra : r @xmath12 12,000 , apparently uniform over the wavelength range of the lif 1a and 1b channels .",
    "we note that improvements to the focus in early 2000 have yielded significantly higher spectral resolution .",
    "the velocity offsets ( relative to the optical and near - uv spectra ) for the h@xmath2 and lines are shown in figure  [ fig : wave ] by crosses and open circles , respectively .",
    "the filled circles show the corresponding offsets for an improved wavelength solution implemented in the calfuse pipeline in 2000 april .",
    "the error bars represent the ( approximately ) 1@xmath20 uncertainties determined in the profile fits . for both wavelength solutions , the absolute velocities are systematically too small ( common to many _ fuse _ spectra ) , and the relative velocities can be uncertain by @xmath12 10 km s@xmath8 over relatively short wavelength intervals ( see also sahnow et al .",
    "there was no appreciable drift in the velocity offsets between the first and last exposures on sk 108  over a span of eight orbits . unless otherwise noted , the _ fuse _ early release object ( ero ) papers ( apjl , vol .",
    "538 ) use the same ( pre-2000 april ) scale used here , and so will have the same small scale errors .",
    "the error in the absolute velocities depends on the centering of the target in the 30   aperture used for all ero observations , and thus may differ for different data sets .",
    "further improvements to the _ fuse _ wavelength scale are being pursued .",
    "the _ fuse _ spectra of sk 108 exhibit absorption lines from a number of species which are dominant ions in primarily neutral ( ) gas .",

    "the reference abundances , the adopted column densities @xmath1(x ) and the relative abundances [ x / zn ] , for both the galactic and smc gas , are listed in table  [ tab : abund ] . because n , p , and ar are generally at most mildly depleted in the galactic ism ( meyer , cardelli , & sofia 1997 ; jenkins 1987 ; sofia & jenkins 1998 ) , we used the component structure ( paper i ) in fitting the lines for , and . as the @xmath142062 line is weaker than those far - uv lines , however , we have augmented the component structure to include additional components seen in the strong @xmath142586 line , with the column densities estimated via typical values of @xmath1()/@xmath1 ( ) for each of the five component groups .",
    "while the low spectral resolution and the small - scale uncertainties in the wavelength scale generally make it difficult to determine accurate abundances for each of the five component groups , the line profiles do in some cases suggest differences in abundance ratios among those groups .    :",
    "nine lines were observed , with 0.45 @xmath21 log(@xmath19 ) @xmath21 2.08 and at wavelengths from 1055 to 1144  . we fitted the line profiles using the component structures determined from the ghrs echelle spectra of the @xmath142260 and @xmath142586 lines of , with log(@xmath19 ) = 0.74 and 2.22 , respectively ( paper i ) .",

    "we used the augmented component structure to fit the lines ; uniform @xmath1()/@xmath1 ( ) ratios yield quite acceptable fits to both the galactic and smc absorption . the galactic column density toward sk 108 derived from the @xmath141152 line is a factor of 2 lower than that found from the @xmath141301 line , however .",
    "while this difference might be suggestive of saturation and/or component structure effects ( see below ) in the stronger @xmath141152 line , we note that a similar difference was found for the line of sight toward 23 ori ( welty et al .",
    "1999b ) , that such differences are within the uncertainties in the @xmath22-values ( morton 1991 ) , and that in any case the weaker smc absorption will be less saturated .",
    "if we increase the column densities derived from the @xmath141152 line by 0.15 dex ( taking average values from the two lines ) , the resulting relative abundances [ p / zn ] are essentially solar in both the galactic and smc gas .    : two lines of ( @xmath14989 and @xmath141020 ) are present in the _ fuse _ spectrum .",

    "even with that augmentation of the structure , however , the column densities derived from fits to the @xmath141020 line are factors of 2.53.5 smaller , for the smc and galactic components , than those found from fitting the weaker @xmath141808 line . while some of the difference may be ascribed to uncertainties in the @xmath22-value for the @xmath141020 line , saturation effects may also be present .",

    "fits to the weaker line yield column densities about 0.1 dex higher than the fits to the stronger line , suggestive of mild saturation effects . while a uniform @xmath1()/@xmath1 ( ) ratio yields good fits to the galactic absorption , some of the weaker outlying smc components ( 1012 , 2125 ) may have somewhat smaller such ratios than the rest of the smc components .",
    "the smc column densities in table  [ tab : neutral ] were derived assuming @xmath1()/@xmath1 ( ) is lower by a factor 10 in those lower column density components , where ar may be partially ionized ( see sec .",
    "[ sec - neutral ] ) .",
    "if the @xmath18-values for the individual components were smaller , the derived column densities would be somewhat higher .    :",
    "the three lines in the triplet at 1134  are strong and severely blended with each other  making it difficult to derive reliable column densities .",
    "the initial fits , using the augmented component structure , seemed to suggest that [ n / zn ] is significantly less than solar for both the galactic and smc gas ( @xmath24 to @xmath25 dex ) .",
    "the lines are very saturated , however , so the derived column densities should be considered as lower limits .",
    "in addition , the empirical curves of growth for ( both galactic and smc ) appear to have smaller effective @xmath18-values than the curves followed by most singly ionized species , and the profiles of the ( unblended ) galactic @xmath141134.1 and smc @xmath141134.9 lines appear to be slightly narrower than the profiles of comparably strong lines from and various singly ionized species ( fig .",
    "[ fig : neutral ] ; see also sec .",
    "[ sec - neutral ] ) .",
    "we therefore also tried fits in which the outlying galactic and smc components ( 1 , 79 , 1012 , 2125 ) have smaller @xmath1()/@xmath1 ( ) ratios by a factor 10 . such fits yielded both better agreement with the observed line profiles and somewhat larger overall column densities .",
    "observations of some of the weaker multiplets below 980    will enable tighter limits to be placed on @xmath1 ( ) .    for each of the species , , , and , there appears to be a systematic trend for lower column densities to be derived from the stronger far - uv lines , especially for the galactic absorption .",
    "while that is not the case for ( the adopted component structure yields good fits to both the weak @xmath142260 and the strong @xmath142586 lines ) , lines from less severely depleted species may follow a somewhat different curve of growth ( with different relative abundances in the various components ) which saturates at lower overall column densities ( cf .",
    "welty et al .",
    "1999b ) . as an additional test , we fitted the ghrs g160 m profiles ( r @xmath12 14,000 ) of the three lines at 1250 , 1253 , and 1259    ( which range over a factor of about 3 in strength ) , using the augmented component structure .",
    "again , the weakest line yielded the highest column densities , for both galactic and smc components ( table  [ tab : neutral ] ) , and even the values derived from the @xmath141250 line imply slightly lower [ s / zn ] ratios than would be expected if the depletions are similar to those found in warm disk clouds ( + 0.2 dex ) or halo clouds ( + 0.1 dex ) ( papers i and ii ) .",
    "we therefore suspect that the column densities derived from fits to the stronger uv lines of these mildly depleted species may be somewhat underestimated .",
    "as the @xmath18-values found in the fits to the ghrs echelle spectra are relatively large ( @xmath26 3 km s@xmath8 ) , the true structure may be more complex  more components , with smaller @xmath18-values . alternatively",
    ", the fits to the and lines suggest that fewer components ( perhaps with smaller @xmath18-values ) may contribute to those neutral species . in either case",
    ", the true column densities could well be higher .",
    "higher resolution spectra of lines from , , and would help to define the appropriate component structure for the stronger lines of species with very mild depletions . finally , we note that single component fits to the galactic absorption ( with @xmath18 @xmath12 1015 km s@xmath8 ) yield column densities up to a factor 2 smaller than those found using the detailed component structure ; the corresponding discrepancies for single component fits to the weaker , less saturated smc absorption ( with @xmath18 @xmath12 2027 km s@xmath8 ) are somewhat smaller .",
