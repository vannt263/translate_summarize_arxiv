    "the main purpose of this paper is to study the topology of the space of all ( generally unbounded ) self - adjoint fredholm operators , and to put the notion of spectral flow for continuous paths of such operators on a firm mathematical footing with clear concise definitions and proofs .",
    "the natural topology on the space of all such operators , denoted by @xmath0 , ( for a fixed separable hilbert space , @xmath1 ) is given by the graph distance topology .",
    "that is , we consider the topology induced by the metric : @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the projection onto the graph of @xmath4 in the space @xmath5 for @xmath6 .",
    "this metric is called the gap metric .",
    "the space of unbounded fredholm operators has been studied systematically in the seminal paper by cordes and labrousse @xcite .",
    "many users of the notion of spectral flow feel that the definition and basic properties are already well - understood . however , there are some difficulties with the currently available definitions which this paper aims to remedy .",
    "a feature of our approach is the use of the cayley transform , @xmath7 we show that the image @xmath8 is precisely the set @xmath9 and that the map @xmath10 induces an equivalent metric , @xmath11 , on @xmath0 via @xmath12 this cayley picture of @xmath0 leads us to a more careful study of the metric space @xmath0 by studying its image @xmath13 .",
    "in contrast to the space of bounded self - adjoint fredholm operators , we prove the surprising result that @xmath0 is ( path-)connected . in particular , the operator @xmath14 can be connected to @xmath15 in @xmath0 .    furthermore , using the cayley picture of @xmath0 , we are able to give two different ( but equivalent ) definitions of the spectral flow of a continuous path in @xmath0 and to show that these definitions are invariant under homotopy .",
    "we use neither kato s selection theorem nor any differentiability or regularity assumptions .",
    "thus , spectral flow induces a surjective homomorphism @xmath16 , from the fundamental group @xmath17 to @xmath18 .    on the other hand",
    ", the space @xmath19 of bounded operators in @xmath0 inherits its usual ( norm ) topology with the gap metric @xmath20 and @xmath19 has three connected components by a result of atiyah and singer . to add to the confusion",
    ", @xmath19 is also dense in @xmath0 .",
    "unfortunately , we have been unable to decide whether @xmath21 is injective or whether @xmath0 is a classifying space for the @xmath22-functor ( cf .",
    "remark below ) .",
    "finally , we consider a fixed compact riemannian manifold @xmath23 with boundary @xmath24 , a family @xmath25 of symmetric elliptic differential operators of first order and of dirac type on @xmath23 acting on sections of a fixed hermitian vector bundle @xmath26 with coefficients depending continuously on a parameter @xmath27 , and a norm - continuous family @xmath28 of orthogonal projections of @xmath29 defining well - posed boundary problems . here  dirac type \" means that each operator @xmath30 can be written in product form near any hypersurface ( for details of the definition see assumption ( 1 ) , equation below ) .    with a view to applications in low - dimensional topology and gauge theories ( see e.g. @xcite ) , we do not assume that the metric structures of @xmath23 and @xmath26 are of product form near @xmath24 .",
    "consequently the tangential symmetric and skew - symmetric operator components may depend on the normal variable near @xmath24 . solely exploiting elliptic regularity and the _ unique continuation property _ of operators of dirac type ,",
    "we show that the induced two - parameter family @xmath31 of self - adjoint @xmath32-extensions with compact resolvent is continuous in @xmath33 in the gap metric without any further assumptions or restrictions .",
    "the results of this paper have been announced in @xcite .",
    "let @xmath1 be a separable complex hilbert space .",
    "first let us introduce some notation for various spaces of operators in @xmath1 : @xmath34    if no confusion is possible we will omit `` @xmath35 '' and write @xmath36 etc .",
    "by @xmath37 etc .",

    "as explained , e.g. , in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 1 ) there are two natural metrics on @xmath40 , the riesz metric and the gap metric .",
    "the _ riesz metric _ is the metric such that the bijection @xmath41 is an isometry .",
    "that is , given @xmath42 then their riesz distance @xmath43 is defined to be @xmath44 .",
    "note that the image of @xmath45 is neither open nor closed in the closed unit ball of @xmath46 .",
    "note also that @xmath45 maps the space @xmath0 of ( generally unbounded ) self - adjoint fredholm operators onto the intersection of the space @xmath19 of bounded self - adjoint fredholm operators with @xmath47 , see also subsection .",
    "it is clear that @xmath45 is injective .",
    "we postpone the proof that @xmath45 as defined in is surjective ( see proposition below ) .",

    "this was also noted in ( * ? ? ?",

    "the next result shows that , as for the riesz topology , the gap topology can be obtained from a map into the bounded linear operators .",

    "* lemma 3.10 ) ) .",
    "the identities @xmath68 yield @xmath69 and we infer that the metric @xmath70 is ( uniformly ) equivalent to the metric @xmath55 given by @xmath71 in the last equality we have used that for any @xmath72 one has @xmath73 .",
    "this proves ( a ) .",
    "to prove ( b ) we note for @xmath62 the identities @xmath74 and @xmath75 these imply @xmath76 this shows that the gap metric and the metric @xmath60 are ( uniformly ) equivalent .",

    "it remains to identify the image of the cayley transform .",
