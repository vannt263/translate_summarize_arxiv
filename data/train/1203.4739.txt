    "let us consider the motion of a point inside a plane billiard table bounded by a closed convex curve .",
    "this point will always move along a straight line until it hits the boundary where it is reflected according to the well known principle : the angle of reflection is equal to the angle of incidence .    in order to get a billiard table with a sufficiently smooth boundary we can use the familiar method known as a the gardener s or the string construction .",
    "first we need to choose some convex polygon @xmath0 and then we proceed to wrap a loop of inelastic string around it , pulling the string tight at a point @xmath1 and then moving this point @xmath1 around .",
    "note that when this technique is applied to a closed line segment one obtains an ellipse .",
    "much is known about the billiard problem inside an ellipse : see for instance the books by chernov and markarian@xcite and tabachnikov@xcite , and also the articles by berry@xcite , korsch and zimmer@xcite and acquistapace@xcite just to name a few .",
    "another choice for the convex polygon which has received a fair amount of attention is that when @xmath0 is an equilateral triangle .",
    "references include hubacher @xcite , gutkin and katok @xcite , gutkin and knill@xcite , turner @xcite . here",
    "again the result is a convex domain whose boundary is comprised of portions of ellipses .    in fig .",
    "[ lab1 ] we illustrate the gardener s construction of a table @xmath2 for the case when @xmath0 is a regular hexagon .",
    "the point @xmath1 , as it moves around , traces out a curve @xmath3 which again consists of a certain number of elliptical arcs .    varying the length @xmath4 of the inelastic string one gets , of course , a whole family of billiard tables .",
    "we need to restrict our attention , however , to only one special value of @xmath4 .",
    "this choice is dictated by the smoothness we get for the boundary @xmath3 .",
    "so it is for it only for this particular case that we want to obtain a description , as complete as possible , of all the trajectories as the billiard ball ( point particle ) bounces elastically off the walls .        in closing this introduction",
    "let us just mention that the study of billiards and in particular the subject of billiards inside smooth convex curves is a very active area of research in the field of dynamical systems .",
    "the interested reader may consult some of the following books and research articles dealing with various important aspects of this topic ( see @xcite and @xcite respectively ) .",
    "the billiard table obtained by the string construction for an equilateral triangle , regardless of the string length used , is of class @xmath6 ( see hubacher @xcite ) . in general , this is also true for all the other billiard tables obtained from regular polygons by the string construction , including the regular hexagon .",
    "however , with a proper choice of the string length @xmath4 one can construct a table having greater regularity . to accomplish this",
    "let us first outline the setup and also the strategy behind the construction process for a whole family of `` smooth '' string billiards .",
    "to start we select @xmath0 as any convex regular @xmath7-gon ( @xmath8 ) .",
    "so right from the beginning we exclude both the equilateral triangle and the square from further considerations .",
    "the reason for that is because we need to be able to stellate @xmath0 .",
    "a stellated polygon can be derived from a regular polygon by adding identical ( congruent ) isosceles triangles to all its sides . instead of adding them all we add only one of those triangles to our given polygon @xmath0 .",
    "the perimeter of this resulting polygon is the sought for special value for the string length @xmath4 .",
    "shortly we shall find an explicit expression for it .",
    "a portion of a regular polygon having vertices @xmath9 with side length 2 is shown in left part of fig .",
    "the coordinates of the vertices , in terms of the interior angle @xmath10 , are as indicated below :    @xmath11",
    "\\\\ f_{2 }   & = [ 1 , 0]\\\\ f_{3 }   & = [ 1 - 2\\cos \\alpha , -2\\sin \\alpha]\\\\ f_{4 }   & = [ -1 - 2\\cos \\alpha+4 \\cos^2\\alpha , 2(-1 + 2\\cos \\alpha)\\sin \\alpha]\\\\ \\ldots \\\\ f_{n-1 }   & = [ 1 + 2\\cos \\alpha-4 \\cos^2\\alpha , 2(-1 + 2\\cos \\alpha)\\sin \\alpha ] \\\\ f_{n }   & = [ -1 + 2\\cos \\alpha , -2\\sin \\alpha]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    now let us add the isosceles triangle with top vertex @xmath12 to the side @xmath13 ( see left part of fig .",
    "[ lab2 ] ) . in this figure",
    "we have actually added several identical ( congruent ) isosceles triangles to the sides of the regular @xmath7-gon .",
    "they have vertices @xmath14 , whose coordinates are given below :",
    "@xmath15\\\\ g_{2 } & = \\left[\\frac{\\cos \\alpha -1}{\\cos \\alpha } , 0\\right ] \\\\ \\ldots \\\\",
    "g_{n } & = \\left[-\\frac{\\cos \\alpha -1}{\\cos \\alpha } , 0\\right]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    each of the equal sides of the isosceles triangle @xmath16 has length @xmath17    so finally we get the expression for the particular string length we were looking for : @xmath18    -gonal string billiard and enneagonal string billiard , width=576,height=268 ]    so much for the setup . in the right part of fig .",
    "[ lab2 ] we illustrate the result of the construction process described above for the case when @xmath0 is a regular nine - gon .",
    "that we get billiard tables with greater regularity than just @xmath6 is the contents of the following theorem .",
    "[ gardener ] the generalized gardener s construction with length of the string @xmath19 provides us with a family of billiard tables ( one for each convex regular @xmath7-gon , @xmath8 ) which are globally @xmath20    for the proof see  [ a1 ] .",
    "some immediate consequences from this construction process include the following :    * as opposed to the general case we need to concern ourselves with only one kind of ellipse . *",
    "the closed boundary curve we get is a smooth union of @xmath7 elliptical arcs . in the general case one",
    "gets twice that number . *",
    "since an ellipse will always have strictly positive curvature the curvature @xmath21 is a continuous , strictly positive function on @xmath3 .    from this point on",
    "we shall discuss one specific billiard only : the hexagonal string billiard .",
    "we shall now provide some specific details for it ( see fig .  [ lab3 ] ) .",
    "let @xmath0 be the regular hexagon with sidelength 2 .",
    "its vertices have the coordinates    @xmath22 since @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 the length of the string @xmath26 .",
    "each of the six elliptical arcs uses a unique pair of foci @xmath27 , where @xmath28 and @xmath29 are either both even or both odd . to reflect this in our notation",
    ", we have used arc @xmath30 for an arc focused at @xmath27 .    the equation for the arc @xmath31 is @xmath32 whereas the equation for the arc @xmath33 is given by @xmath34 at the common point @xmath35 the first derivative for both yields @xmath36 while the second derivative is @xmath37    as for the curvature @xmath21 of any elliptical arc , a simple calculation gives : @xmath38",
    "the orbits of billiards are sequences of line segments on the billiard table with the segments corresponding to the straight paths which the ball must follow within the region until it hits the boundary where it reflects elastically .",
    "each such orbit is determined by the choice of the initial location for the billiard ball as well as the direction for the shot .",
    "it is well - known that in a generic or typical billiard one can identify different types of trajectories : periodic , quasi - periodic ( librational ) , whispering - gallery ( rotational ) and chaotic .",
    "we shall try to describe and illustrate them in the context of the hexagonal string billiard .      in almost any study on billiards initial interest centers on periodic orbits :",
    "those in which the particle follows the same path endlessly . in general these paths can be recognized easily because they simply correspond to inscribed simple polygons or star polygons .",
    "when , for example , a convex billiard table has two perpendicular symmetry axes then we immediately get a period four orbit ( hasselblatt and katok  @xcite ) .",
    "our billiard has six axes of symmetry , so we get twelve points from their intersection with the boundary of the billiard table . selecting arbitrarily any of these points as the initial point and then connecting it to the next one by skipping over exactly @xmath39 intermediate points",
    "we are bound to get a closed figure .",
    "since this figure is always invariant under the symmetries , it follows that at each point of intersection with the table the angle of incidence is equal to the angle of reflection .",
    "now , according as @xmath40 the corresponding periodic orbits will close onto themselves after @xmath41 bounces , respectively , where @xmath42 denotes the greatest common divisor of @xmath7 and @xmath43 some of these basic periodic orbits for our billiard are shown in fig .",
    "[ lab4 ] .",
    "when dealing with periodic trajectories a very natural question is : how many are there performing @xmath7 bounces and at the same time going around the boundary @xmath44 times ?",
    "birkhoff  @xcite provided an astonishing answer to the previous question as early as 1927 ( see also tabachnikov @xcite ) :    for any @xmath45 and every @xmath46 , relatively prime , there exist two geometrically distinct @xmath47periodic trajectories with the rotation number @xmath44 .",
    "so , for example , the 2-,3- and 6-bounce orbits in fig .  [ lab4](a ) and those in fig .",
    "[ lab4](b ) are geometrically distinct .",
    "they are similar though , with a similarity ratio of @xmath48    from birkhoff s theorem we are lead to the conclusion that there are always at least @xmath49 distinct @xmath47periodic trajectories , where @xmath49 denotes euler s totient function .",
    "thus when @xmath50 we must have @xmath51 distinct @xmath52periodic trajectories .",
    "the reader can appreciate the eight unstable 17-sided star polygons that we constructed for the hexagonal string billiard in fig .",
    "[ lab5 ] .    , width=576,height=288 ]    it is clear that , because our billiard has six - fold symmetry , we can rotate these geometrically distinct @xmath47periodic trajectories by certain angles .",
    "the order of rotational symmetry is given by @xmath53 and so this yields a grand total of @xmath54 @xmath47periodic trajectories for each @xmath55    the first few values of this expression are given in the following table  [ tab : mytable ] .",
    ".total number of @xmath47gons .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      sometimes one also encounters certain orbits which explore only restricted parts ( segments ) of the boundary @xmath3 . every ( stable ) simple polygon or star polygon ( the two - bounce orbit included ) gives rise to an infinite number of these quasi - periodic orbits .",
    "they resemble the underlying polygons : it is as if these just fattened up .",
    "so that s why we will also refer to them simply as fat ( star ) polygons .",

    "they are characterized by the fact that they bounce all round @xmath3 densely filling a ring - like shaped region .",
    "there are many of these orbits in our billiard and we show several of them in fig .",
    "[ lab8 ] .          most billiards exhibit chaotic behavior to some extent ( circles and ellipses excluded ) .",
    "chaotic trajectories look disordered , erratic and there is no discernible pattern .",
    "they usually manifest themselves more clearly in the surface of section , which we will introduce later . for the moment",
    "let us just say that there is no evidence that our billiard has these kinds of orbits .",
    "one of the most important properties of elliptic billiards is the following result which essentially tells us that we can group the trajectories into three families .    a trajectory for the billiard inside an ellipse either    1",
    ".   always passes through the two foci alternately ( focal trajectory ) , or 2 .",
    "always intersects the open segment between the two foci ( inner trajectory ) , or 3 .",
    "never intersects the closed segment between the foci ( outer trajectory ) .",
    "( see siburg  @xcite , tabachnikov  @xcite , chernov and markarian  @xcite ) .    in a completely analogous fashion for the hexagonal string billiard we also have three families of trajectories : focal , inner , and outer .",
    "[ ppal ] consider a trajectory issuing from the point @xmath59 inside a hexagonal string billiard with vertices @xmath60    1 .",
    "if the segment @xmath61 of the billiard trajectory is on a supporting line of @xmath0 , then every segment @xmath62 will be on a supporting line of @xmath0 .",
    "if the segment @xmath61 of a billiard trajectory does intersect the hexagon @xmath0 then all segments @xmath62 will intersect it .",
    "3 .   if the segment @xmath61 of a billiard trajectory does not intersect the hexagon @xmath0 then no segment @xmath62 will intersect it .    a sketch for the proof of this result can be found in  [ b1 ] .",
    "another important result for the billiard inside an ellipse states that a billiard trajectory through the foci converges to the major axis of the ellipse .",
    "( see for example tabachnikov  @xcite , batschelet  @xcite , frantz  @xcite , hasselblatt and katok  @xcite , wilker  @xcite , moser and zehnder  @xcite ) .    in practice",
    "this means that any focal orbit quickly becomes indistinguishable from a repeated tracing of the major axis of the ellipse .    whereas a focal orbit in the case of the ellipse converges to the `` to and fro '' orbit ( the unstable two - bounce orbit ) , in that of the hexagonal string billiard it converges to either one of the equilateral triangles ( the unstable three - bounce orbits ) .    before stating the result in more precise terms we need an auxiliary result which provides bounds for the sizes of the angles between incoming and outgoing rays in focal orbits .",
    "( see fig .",

    "[ angle ] for a focal orbit of the hexagonal string billiard the angle between incoming and outgoing segments is limited to the range @xmath63    proof in  [ c1 ] .",

    "see  [ d1 ] for proof .",
    "several authors include in their work a brief discussion on the stability of certain @xmath47periodic orbits through the use of the so called deviation matrix @xmath75 .",
    "we also want to mention something about stability . for this purpose",
    "we have chosen the @xmath76 orbit , which can be seen on the top left part of fig .",

    "there are several different meanings of the word caustic in billiards .",
    "the one that seems the most appropriate for us is ( see gruber  @xcite , klee and wagon  @xcite , turner  @xcite ) :    a convex caustic for a convex table @xmath2 is a closed convex proper subset @xmath105 of @xmath2 such that whenever the initial segment of a billiard path in @xmath2 lies in a supporting line of @xmath105 , then every later segment also lies in a supporting line of @xmath105 .",
    "all billiard tables obtained by the string construction have a special caustic .",
    "the hexagon @xmath0 is such a caustic and we already established this in theorem[ppal ] .",

    "a poincar surface of section consisting exclusively of closed curves and periodic points suggests completely regular ( integrable ) behavior .",
    "the extreme cases of completely regular and of fully chaotic behavior are both a very uncommon occurrence .",
    "most often one finds that the poincar sos is filled with a mixture of both regular and irregular orbits ( see korsch and zimmer @xcite ) .",
    "so the question is : exactly , how exceptional is the hexagonal string billiard ?    the following are the most relevant properties of this billiard :    1 .",
    "the boundary of our billiard is twice continuously differentiable and has strictly positive curvature .",
    "our billiard is not a simple deformation or perturbation of the circular billiard .",
    "in addition to the planar region bounded by six elliptical arcs we also have a set of very special points : the foci , whose influence can not be ignored .",
    "our billiard exhibits three types of trajectories : focal , outer , and inner ( see theorem [ ppal ] ) .",
    "it has a special caustic and we can associate a forbidden region with any trajectory .",
    "the poincar surface of section is filled solely with periodic points and invariant curves , while chaotic area - filling orbits are totally absent .",
    "6 .   in the poincar surface of section",
    "there are no island chains .",
    "finally let us briefly mention a long - standing open problem , very often attributed to g. d. birkhoff , although originally stated by poritsky  @xcite(see also gutkin  @xcite ) , the so - called birkhoff - poritsky conjecture .",
    "it basically states that among all billiards inside smooth closed convex curves , only billiards in ellipses are integrable .",
    "this means that aside from the energy , there must exist a second conserved quantity .",
    "finding such a constant of motion is usually a very difficult task .",
    "however in the case of the elliptic billiard it is well - known : it is simply the product of the two angular momenta about the two foci ( see zhang et al .",
    "@xcite , berry  @xcite , korsch and zimmer  @xcite ) .",
    "so , we want to conclude with a question :    from all the evidence gathered for the hexagonal string billiard , can we still be certain that the elliptic billiard is the only integrable convex billiard ?",
    "for the extensive programming task involved in this project we have benefited greatly from carl eberhart s efforts , who simulates billiard - ball trajectories on both circular and elliptical tables in _ _ reflective paths in an ellipse__@xcite .",
    "we merely have adapted some of his ideas for our own particular purposes .",
    "we also want to thank martin sieber for providing us , almost instantly , with a hard to get and much needed reference .",

    "now we can consider two different types of rays issuing from @xmath59 : those strictly inside and those strictly outside the convex angle @xmath167 .",
