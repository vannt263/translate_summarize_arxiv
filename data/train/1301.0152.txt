    "hotelling s @xcite spatial model of competition , first introduced in 1929 , has had a large and varied influence on a number of fields .",
    "it has been applied not only in the original context of firms selecting geographic locations along  main street \" so as to maximise their share of the market , but also to that of producers deciding on how much variety to incorporate into their products @xcite .",
    "downs @xcite has adapted it with minor modifications to model an election : in particular , the ideological position - taking behaviour of political candidates in their effort to win votes .    the model in its simplest form features a number of candidates ( firms ) adopting positions on a one - dimensional manifold , usually taken to be the interval @xmath0 $ ] , along which the voters ideal positions ( consumers ) are distributed .",
    "the preferences of the voters over the candidates are then determined by the distance between their own ideal positions and those advocated by the candidates .",
    "the candidates adopt positions so as to maximise their share of the vote ( market ) . in the economic interpretation of this model where firms compete for market share , competition on price",
    "is excluded and customers buy from the closest firm to minimise transportation costs .    in the majority of the literature , the voters only have one vote , which they allocate to their favourite candidate .",
    "that is , the electoral system is taken to be plurality rule .",
    "the voters second , third and other preferences do not come into play .",
    "economically , this is akin to saying customers only patronise the nearest firm , with the distribution of the more distant firms being irrelevant to them .    in many situations ,",
    "however , preferences other than first do indeed matter .",
    "far from all elections are held under plurality rule : electoral systems , both in use and theoretical , are diverse .",
    "so too are the incentives that candidates are faced with under different electoral systems ",
    "what is the optimal strategy under one system may be subpar under a different one .",
    "one very general class of electoral systems that take into account more than just the voters single most preferred candidate are the scoring rules .    in an election held under a scoring rule",
    ", each voter submits a preference ranking of all @xmath1 candidates running for office , whereby @xmath2 points are assigned to the candidate in the @xmath3th position on the voter s ranking .",
    "thus , we specify a scoring rule by an @xmath1-vector of real nonnegative numbers , @xmath4 , with @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "well - known examples of scoring rules include plurality , borda s rule and antiplurality , given by score vectors @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 , respectively .",
    "different score vectors may define the same scoring rule .",
    "in particular , an affine transformation of the score vector @xmath10 , where @xmath11 and @xmath12 are real numbers , defines the same rule as @xmath13 .    in the election  according to stigler s thesis  the candidates adopt positions with the aim of maximising the total number of points received from all the electorate and",
    "hence , one would expect , the equilibrium strategies will depend on the particular scoring rule in use .",
    "this dependence is the focus of our investigation .",
    "this is not the only possible interpretation of the scoring rule .",
    "another plausible view , due to cox @xcite , is that the coordinates of the score vector represent probabilities : if we normalise the score vector @xmath13 so that the sum of its coordinates is 1 , @xmath2 can now be seen as the likelihood that a voter votes for the @xmath3th nearest candidate . indeed , ideological proximity is not the only factor at the ballot box : a single issue out of many may put a voter off a candidate who , on the whole , is of a similar ideological bent ; or , it could simply be down to personal charisma , experience , prejudice or any number of other similar nonpolicy reasons . in the economic interpretation , it is also natural to assume that consumers patronise more distant firms with some probability  occasionally , it turns out to be more convenient to purchase from a more distant firm simply because one happens to be passing through the vicinity , for example .",
    "the probability implied by such an interpretation is of an ordinal nature  there is no dependency on absolute distance , as occurs in most of the extant literature on probabilistic voting ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "as mentioned , most of the literature considers the case of plurality elections .",
    "exceptions are cox @xcite and myerson  @xcite , who consider a number of alternative electoral systems , including scoring rules .",
    "cox , in particular , provides a valuable characterisation of convergent nash equilibria ( cne ) , that is , equilibria in which all candidates adopt the same policy position ( see theorem [ cne ] of this paper for the precise formulation ) .",
    "he identifies three classes to which a scoring rule may belong :  best - rewarding \" rules which never possess cne ;  worst - punishing \" rules which , to the contrary , do allow cne in which all candidates adopt a position located within a certain interval ; and , an intermediate case between the two , for which a unique cne exists at the median voter s ideal position .    as one infers from the nomenclature , under each of these three classes of scoring rules candidates",
    "are faced with different incentives .",
    "myerson  @xcite  who introduced the terminology we are using  explains the competing incentives as follows : under a best - rewarding rule ,  the candidate gains more from moving up in the preferences of voters who currently rank her near the top \" ; on the contrary , under a worst - punishing rule  the candidate gains more from moving up in the preferences of voters who currently rank her near the bottom . \"",
    "cox stopped short of investigating the existence of nonconvergent nash equilibria ( ncne ) for general scoring rules , i.e. , those equilibria in which the positions adopted by the candidates are not all the same . for plurality , however , the situation is well - studied and a full characterisation of ncne is given by eaton and lipsey @xcite and denzau et al . @xcite .",
    "the nonexistence of ncne for antiplurality is also known , as cox @xcite points out . for general scoring rules , however , the picture is unclear , and little work has been done in this direction .",
    "cox conjectures @xcite that  nonconvergent equilibria are at best rare for [ worst - punishing ] scoring functions , but that they are fairly common for [ best - rewarding ] scoring functions . \"",
    "we look to fill this gap in the literature .",
    "since a general characterisation of ncne appears to be intractable , our approach is to consider the problem in large classes of rules satisfying various additional conditions . for several broad classes of scoring rules",
    ", we find that ncne do not exist at all or seldom exist . for rules having scores that are convex ( decrease more rapidly at the top end of the score vector than at the bottom end ) ,",
    "ncne are impossible except for some derivatives of borda rule ( theorem [ convexscores2 ] ) . for rules whose scores are concave ( decrease more rapidly at the bottom end of the score vector than at the top end ) we do not have such a perfect answer .",
    "our results for this class of rules are applicable to a larger class of weakly concave rules : we prove that if an ncne exists , then it should be highly asymmetric ( theorem  [ wpnoncne2 ] ) and we showed that such asymmetric equilibria for some weakly concave rules do indeed exist ( example  [ 8 - 4ncne ] ) .",
    "the existence of ncne for rules with concave scores remain an intriguing open question .",
    "we also look at a class of rules that are highly best - rewarding , that is , the reward for being ranked first by voters is particularly large relative to other rankings . for these rules",
    "as well , no ncne exist ( theorem [ highlybr ] ) .",
    "on the other hand , two other classes investigated , amongst others , do allow ncne and we can calculate many of them .",
    "we identify a class of rules allowing ncne with multiple candidates clustered more or less evenly along the issue space ( theorem [ multipositional ] ) .",
    "we also characterize ncne in which there are two symmetrically located clusters with the same number of candidates ( theorem [ bipositional ] ) .    in the special cases of four- and five - candidate elections , things are simpler and we are able to provide a complete characterisation of the rules allowing ncne ( theorems [ 4cand ] and [ 5cand2 ] ) .",
    "we also examine six - candidate elections ( theorem [ 6cand2 ] ) .",
    "the rest of this paper is organised as follows .",
    "first , we introduce notation and the main assumptions of our model in section  [ themodel ]",
    ". then , in section  [ preliminaries ] , we derive some preliminary results before moving on to investigate rules that do not allow ncne in section [ ruleswithnoncne ] .",
    "next , in section  [ ruleswithncne ] , we look at rules that do admit ncne . in section  [ specialcases ]",
    ", we turn our attention to the special cases of four- , five- and six - candidate elections . in section  [ comres ]",
    "we briefly outline the algorithm we used for finding ncne computationally . finally , we briefly review the related literature in section  [ relatedliterature ] , and section [ conclusion ] concludes .",
    "in our model there is a continuum of voters , assumed to have ideal positions uniformly distributed on the interval @xmath0 $ ] , the issue space , on which candidates adopt positions .",
    "since the two- and three - candidate cases are well - known  in the first we have the classical median voter result , and in the latter case no ncne exist ( see the end of this section)we assume there are @xmath14 candidates . candidate @xmath3",
    "s position is denoted @xmath15 and a strategy profile @xmath16^m$ ] specifies the positions adopted by all the candidates . for a given strategy profile @xmath17 , denote by @xmath18 the _ distinct _ positions that appear in @xmath17 , labelled so that @xmath19 . in an ncne , we will always have @xmath20 .",
    "let @xmath21 denote the number of candidates adopting position @xmath22 .",
    "then we have @xmath23 .",
    "given a strategy profile @xmath17 , we will often use the equivalent notation @xmath24 we also use the notation @xmath25=\\{1,\\ldots , n\\}$ ] and if @xmath26\\subseteq [ 0,1]$ ] is an interval with end points @xmath27 , its length is denoted @xmath28 and this is the measure of voters in the interval , since the distribution is uniform .",
    "we assume the voters are not strategic and have single - peaked , symmetric utility functions . hence",
    ", a voter ranks the candidates according to the distance between her own personal ideal position and the positions adopted by the candidates .",
    "if @xmath29 , that is , two or more candidates adopt position @xmath22 , then all voters will be indifferent between these candidates .",
    "however , the scoring rule requires that they submit a strict ranking . in this case",
    ", a voter separates these candidates in her ranking by means of a fair lottery .",
    "thus , for example , if @xmath22 is the position nearest to a given voter s ideal position , the voter allocates the first @xmath30 places in her ranking randomly , with each candidate at @xmath22 having a probability of @xmath31 of being assigned any one of these places .",
    "note that we assume voters can only ever be indifferent between candidates if they occupy the same position . candidate @xmath3",
    "s score , @xmath32 , is the total number of points received on integrating across all voters .",
    "the candidates are assumed to maximise @xmath32that is , they are score ( share ) maximisers .",
    "information is assumed to be complete and no candidate has an advantage ",
    "they all adopt positions simultaneously .",
    "we hope that the following example will aid the reader in understanding how scores are calculated for a given configuration of candidate positions .",
    "[ calculationexample ] consider a three - candidate election contested between candidates @xmath3 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 and held under a scoring rule @xmath35 .",
    "consider the profile @xmath36 , where @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "this situation is illustrated in figure [ examplepicture ] .",
    "the voters in the interval @xmath39 $ ] are indifferent between candidates @xmath3 and @xmath33 , but prefer them both to @xmath34 .",
    "the voters in the interval @xmath40 $ ] have @xmath34 as their unique favourite candidate , and they are indifferent between @xmath3 and @xmath33 . then @xmath3 and @xmath33 both receive the score @xmath41 the first term comes from the fact that all voters in @xmath42 flip a coin to decide whether to rank @xmath3 first and @xmath33 second , or the other way around . hence , @xmath3 receives @xmath43 from half these voters and @xmath44 from the other half .",
    "the second term follows from similar considerations with respect to the voters in @xmath45 .",
    "the score garnered by @xmath34 is @xmath46 no  sharing \" of votes occurs here , since no voters are indifferent between @xmath34 and another candidate .",
    "note that @xmath17 is not an ncne since profitable deviations are possible .",
    "candidate @xmath34 , for example , can move inwards towards the other two candidates to gain a larger score .",
    "the workings of a positional scoring rule can be illustrated on the following example .",
    "consider a profile profile @xmath47 shown below .",
    "the score of a candidate  1 positioned at @xmath48 in the given profile @xmath17 would be @xmath49 where the first summand represents the contribution to the score of voters from the interval @xmath50 $ ] , the second summand represents the contribution to the score of voters from the interval @xmath51 $ ] , and the third summand represents the contribution to candidate  1 s score from the remaining voters .",
    "often we will consider what happens to a candidate s score on making incremental deviations from her current position , or deviations to points infinitesimally close to other occupied positions .",
    "for example , given an initial profile @xmath52 , if we write that @xmath53 is the profile where candidate @xmath3 moves to @xmath54 , what we mean is that @xmath55 , where @xmath56 is taken to be small enough that there are no occupied positions between @xmath15 and @xmath54 ; moreover , when @xmath57 is small enough , for all @xmath58 $ ] we have @xmath59 if and only if @xmath60 .",
    "this means that after this move only candidates previously at the same location as @xmath15 change their positions in the voters rankings .",
    "as @xmath57 tends to zero , the measure of voters between @xmath15 and @xmath54 tends to zero .    given a scoring rule @xmath4 ,",

    "an important parameter of the rule will be the average score denoted @xmath68 .",
    "our equilibrium concept is the standard nash equilibrium in pure strategies . to define it we introduce the following standard notation .",

    "myerson and weber @xcite introduce the concept of a  voting equilibrium \" , where voters take into account not only their personal preferences but also whether contenders are serious , and compare plurality and approval voting in a three - candidate positioning game similar to ours .",
    "we focus only on candidate strategies .    as for the multicandidate aspect ,",
    "this paper is most closely related to denzau et al .",
    "@xcite and , before them , eaton and lipsey @xcite .",
    "the latter consider plurality rule , and the former extend these results to `` generalised rank functions '' .",
    "that is , the candidates objectives depend to some degree both on market share and rank ( say , the number of candidates with a larger market share ) . for a review emphasising multicandidate competition , see shepsle @xcite .",
    "many other more realistic refinements of the hotelling model have been constructed , incorporating uncertainty , incomplete information , incumbency and underdog effects , and so on .",
    "however , the price of added realism is that they are more complicated , and considering more than two candidates is often intractable . for a survey focusing on variations of the two candidate case ,",
    "see duggan @xcite or osborne @xcite .    as for the economic interpretation ,",
    "our results are related only to those models in which price competition and transport costs do not come into play , such as in , again , eaton and lipsey @xcite and denzau et al . @xcite .",
    "the most basic model incorporating price competition is a game of two interdependent stages , the location selecting stage and the price setting stage .",
    "the details can be found in many standard economics textbooks , such as vega - redondo @xcite .",
    "in this paper , we have investigated how the particular scoring rule in use influences the candidates position - taking behaviour .",
    "we have looked at the equilibrium properties of a number of different classes of scoring rules .",
    "we were able to identify several broad classes of scoring rules disallowing ncne completely .",
    "for other large classes , we found that ncne can exist and we calculated a number of them .",
    "as cox @xcite and myerson @xcite found previously , the parameter @xmath83 plays a prominent role in determining what kind of equilibria are possible  as @xmath83 increases , the amount of dispersion tends to increase also  though usually the value of @xmath83 is not the only factor of importance .",
    "the manner in which the scores in the score vector are decreasing is pivotal",
    " we saw , for example , that all rules with entirely convex scores and many with entirely concave scores fail to possess ncne .",
    "the conditions under which ncne do exist can at times be quite stringent , as is made clear by the four- and five - candidate cases . in his investigation of cne , cox @xcite found that the value @xmath86 appears as a cut - off point between existence and nonexistence of cne : they exist if and only if @xmath82 , i.e. , when the rule is worst - punishing . when there are four or five candidates , a similar phenomenon occurs with respect to ncne :",
    "only when @xmath192 may ncne exist , though , as mentioned above , it is not guaranteed .",
    "thus , the two kinds of equilibrium are mutually exclusive . when there are six or more candidates , however , this transition from cne to ncne is no longer clear - cut .",
    "there exist worst - punishing and intermediate rules that allow both types of equilibria , as seen in theorem  [ bipositional ] .",
    "a number of questions remain open .",
    "though we have investigated a wide variety of scoring rules , these are by no means all of them .",
    "the equilibrium behaviour of many rules  most notably concave ones  remains unknown . on the other hand , many of the rules most frequently appearing in the literature  plurality , borda , @xmath34-approval and so on  fall nicely into the cases we have considered .",
    "another point of interest : most ncne discovered in this paper by theoretical considerations have been ones in which the same number of candidates locate at each position .",
    "the mechanics behind less regular or asymmetric equilibria obtained as a result of computational experiments remains unclear .",
    "it is interesting that a class of weakly concave rules can have only highly asymmetric equilibria .",
    "hence a concave rule may have only asymmetric equilibria or none at all . at this point",
    "it is unknown whether any concave rules actually permit such asymmetric ncne .",
    "of course , there are a number of simplifications in our framework in comparison to cox s one .",
    "the main one is the assumption that the voters are uniformly distributed along the issue space , though this was partially justified in the first footnote of section [ themodel ] .",
    "@xcite characterisation of cne holds for an arbitrary nonatomic distribution of voter ideal points .",
    "the existence of ncne , however , is much more vulnerable to changes in the distribution . in a similar framework ,",
    "osborne @xcite finds that , for plurality rule , the uniform distribution is a special casealmost all \" other distributions exclude the possibility of ncne .",
    "it would be interesting to see whether our results can be adapted to other distributions .",
    "another limiting assumption is the unidimensionality of the issue space .",
    "cox @xcite provides a version of theorem  [ cne ] for a multidimensional space . whether our results on ncne can be extended to this situation",
    "is also not known .",
