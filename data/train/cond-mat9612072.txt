    "the high - t@xmath1 superconductors reba@xmath2cu@xmath3o@xmath4 ( rebco ) , where re denotes yttrium or one of the rare - earth atoms yb , er , y , sm , nd , or la , have been studied extensively , both theoretically and experimentally . among others ,",
    "the impact of the oxygen deficient cuo@xmath0 ( sometimes called cu(1 ) ) planes on superconductivity has been investigated .",
    "in particular , the charge transfer from the cu(1 ) planes to the superconducting cuo@xmath2 ( or cu(2 ) ) planes has been shown to play a crucial role . the cu(1 )",
    "planes consist of linear cu  o@xmath5o ",
    "cu chain fragments ( cfs ) .",
    "each cu atom is strongly coupled to the two apical oxygen atoms in adjacent ba - o planes .",
    "depending on the number , @xmath6 , of neighboring oxygen atoms in a cf , cu atoms may be @xmath7-fold coordinated .",
    "obviously , a threefold coordinated cu atom , cu@xmath8 , is located at the end of a chain fragment ; fourfold coordination ( cu@xmath9 ) is realized for a copper atom in the cf , while an isolated cu atom is twofold coordinated , cu@xmath10 .",
    "the concentration of differently coordinated cu atoms has been determined experimentally by means of nmr - nqr @xcite and x - ray absorption spectroscopy ( xas ) @xcite . using the soft xas method , it is possible to estimate the concentration of oxygen holes in sufficiently long cu - o chains .",
    "for example , for untwinned yba@xmath2cu@xmath3o@xmath11 , it has been found to be about 30% @xcite .",
    "@xmath12 , the superconducting phase transition temperature , as a function of oxygen content @xmath13 is known to display the prominent 60 k and 90 k plateaus for re = yb , y and er @xcite , i.e. , the compounds of comparatively small re ionic radii .",
    "the analog of the 60 k plateau is less pronounced for re = gd @xcite , and the plateaus are practically absent for the rebco compounds with re = nd @xcite and la @xcite .",
    "the distribution of chain lengths in the cf ensemble allows one to estimate the concentration of holes leaving the chains , @xmath14 , which is usually assumed to be proportional to @xmath12 , unless one is in the underdoping ( @xmath15 ) and overdoping ( @xmath16 ) regimes .",
    "underdoping corresponds to localization of transferred holes in cuo@xmath2 planes , while overdoping holds near the maximum of @xmath17 ( see @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "@xmath12 depends not only on @xmath13 but also on the temperature , @xmath18 , at which the cu(1 ) planes have been effectively equilibrated experimentally .",
    "@xmath18 is typically the annealing temperature for rapid quenches , or the room temperature , @xmath19 , if the cooling was done slowly ; below @xmath19 , the mobility of the oxygen atoms in the cuo@xmath20 planes is greatly reduced .",
    "varying @xmath18 up to 350@xmath21c in experiments on ybco , veal and co - workers @xcite showed that the 60 k plateau is sensitive to changes of @xmath18 .",
    "in fact , the plateau becomes less pronounced with increasing @xmath18 .",
    "a subsequent experiment @xcite confirmed these results , and demonstrated that the various annealing temperatures @xmath18 are accompanied by rearrangements in the ensemble of chain fragments .",
    "note , that the temperature considered in our theoretical analysis of the cu ",
    "o chains corresponds to @xmath18 in experiments .",
    "the cu - o chains in the cu(1 ) planes may form differently ordered phases , the orthorhombic , ortho - i , ortho - ii , and probably ortho - iii ( see , for instance , @xcite , as well as the tetragonal phases , which have been identified experimentally .",
    "the perfect ortho - i and ortho - ii structures together with a typical arrangement of oxygen atoms in the tetragonal structure are shown in figure [ figure1 ] .",
    "the transformation from the semiconducting to the metal state in ybco is usually ascribed to the tetragonal  orthorhombic transition .",
    "the underlying microscopic mechanism seems to be the delocalization of holes in the cuo@xmath2 planes resulting in a change of the oxygen hole chemical potential , which , in turn , influences the structural properties @xcite .",
    "some years ago , a lattice  gas model , the asymmetric next - nearest - neighbor ising ( asynnni ) model , has been proposed for describing the oxygen ordering in the cu(1 ) planes of ybco @xcite .",
    "it is based on three effective coupling constants as shown in figure [ figure2 ] .",
    "two of these couplings , the nearest neighbor oxygen repulsion @xmath22 ( @xmath23 ) and the next - nearest neighbor attraction @xmath24 ( @xmath25 ) mediated by a copper atom , favor ortho - i - like configurations .",
    "the third coupling , @xmath26 , the direct interaction between next - nearest oxygen atoms without intermediate cu atom , is supposed to be repulsive , thereby favoring formation of ortho - ii - like configurations .",
    "the phase diagram of the model is sketched in figure [ figure3 ] .",
    "as noted before , when comparing to experiments , the temperature should be interpreted as @xmath18 .",
    "the phase diagram of the asynnni model has been analyzed using various numerical approaches , such as cluster variation methods @xcite , monte carlo simulations for static @xcite as well as dynamic properties @xcite , and transfer - matrix finite - size techniques @xcite . among the approximate analytical approaches , one may mention a low - temperature expansion of the free energy @xcite and high - temperature expansions @xcite .",
    "the model allows to reproduce remarkably well the main features of the experimental phase diagram for ybco . as a note of caution",
    ", attention may be drawn , however , to experimental findings providing evidence for a possible discrepancy in the location of the phase boundary of the ortho - ii phase @xcite . according to these experiments , the disordering of the ortho - ii phase",
    ", oxygen content @xmath13 close to 0.5 , occurs at about 450 k. in the asynnni model the internal degrees of freedom of the cfs are ignored , such as the charge and spin distributions . to take them into account",
    ", one may start from an appropriate microscopic model of the cu - o chains and try to map it onto a corresponding lattice - gas model , possibly of asynnni - type .",
    "( microscopic models have been also employed by aligia @xcite to explain and predict some superstructures in the cu(1 ) planes ) .",
    "such an approach has been attempted before @xcite , motivated by the suggestion that , in the case of ybco , the asynnni model may be insufficient to describe phenomena in the part of the phase diagram where short cu - o chains dominate . for instance , the chemical potential isotherms @xcite are reproduced only poorly , whose singularities seem to be important near the tetragonal - to - ortho - i phase boundary where the average lenght of the chains does not exceed a few lattice constants . it had been suggested @xcite to describe the tetragonal phase in ybco at @xmath27 in terms of a phase separation . in particular , neutron and x - ray data had been interpreted , in the regime of phase separation , as signalling short chains with a herringbone structure .",
    "however , subsequently , the superstructure reflections were attributed to a parasitic phase @xcite .",
    "( nevertheless , there may be a chance to find herringbone structures or some other regular configurations of the very short chain fragments in labco , but not in ybco ; for possible patterns , see figure [ figure4 ] .",
    "indeed , it has been shown @xcite that those chain fragments are electric quadrupoles , and if they are dominant , then the herringbone structure would be energetically preferred ) .",
    "the motivation of the present study is to reconsider the asynnni model in view of the new experimental facts .",
    "we shall relate that lattice - gas model to a strongly correlated electron model , the emery model , for the cu - o chains .",
    "this will allow us to reinterpret the crucial coupling @xmath24 , which will turn out to depend , for instance , on temperature .",
    "in addition , a new parameter will be introduced , reflecting the relevance of the shortest chain fragments , i.e. cu - o - cu .",
    "using monte carlo simulations , properties of the resulting _ extended _ asynnni model will be computed , based on the statistical ensemble of chain fragments .",
    "the main considerations in relating the emery model to the asynnni model will be presented in the next section , followed by a section in which , based on the lattice - gas model , some interesting properties like the temperature dependence of the charge transfer from the cu - o chains in the cu(1 ) planes to the cu(2 ) planes for various rebco compounds as well as the distribution of differently coordinated cu atoms will be discussed .",
    "a short summary will conclude the article .",
    "following prior considerations @xcite , we shall describe briefly a possible charge transfer mechanism for the cu - o chains in the cu(1 ) planes . assuming a strong repulsion between neighboring oxygen sites , see figure [ figure2 ] ,",
    "linear cu - o chain fragments are formed with essentially no crossings . in a cf",
    ", oxygen and copper atoms form a strongly correlated system due to a strong hybridization of the oxygen @xmath28 orbitals with the @xmath29 orbitals of the copper atoms . if we ignored the oxidation process , the @xmath30 oxygen atoms in a cf of composition cu@xmath31o@xmath32 would be neutral , while the @xmath33 cu atoms would be in the monovalent state , as in the parent compound yba@xmath2cu@xmath3o@xmath34 . in reality",
    ", a charge transfer is expected to occur , which may be described formally as a two - step process .",
    "the first step corresponds to a charge redistribution in the cf , leading to only one divalent o@xmath35 ion in each cf ; schematically cu@xmath36@xmath37o@xmath37@xmath38@xmath37cu@xmath36@xmath37o@xmath37@xmath37cu@xmath36@xmath39@xmath37o@xmath37@xmath37cu@xmath40 cu@xmath41@xmath37o@xmath42@xmath38@xmath37cu@xmath41@xmath37o@xmath35@xmath43cu@xmath41@xmath38@xmath37o@xmath44@xmath37cu@xmath45 the second step involves a charge transfer from the monovalent oxygen ions in a chain fragment to the cu(2 ) planes or to other fragments .",
    "the resulting cf has the form cu@xmath46o@xmath47o@xmath48 , where @xmath49 holes have been transferred , assuming that each copper ion remains in the divalent state .",
    "it has been shown experimentally @xcite that for long chains in ybco @xmath50 . for short chains ,",
    "the optimal cf configurations have been estimated @xcite to be cu@xmath51o@xmath52o@xmath44 for @xmath53 , cu@xmath54o@xmath55o@xmath44 for @xmath56 and cu@xmath57o@xmath35o@xmath44 ( or cu@xmath57o@xmath55 ) for @xmath58 .",
    "accordingly , no hole ( one hole ) leaves the @xmath58 cf , one hole and two holes leave the @xmath56 and @xmath53 cf , respectively . generalizing this finding into a simple rule of thumb",
    ", one may estimate @xmath59 to be , for an arbitrarily long chain ,  @xmath60 , where nint denotes the nearest integer .",
    "@xmath61 is that optimal ratio , which is realized in _",
    "long _ cfs .      as the starting point for a microscopic description of the cu - o chains we use the one  dimensional emery model @xcite , applied to systems of finite length .",
    "the hamiltonian is @xmath62 where the sum runs over the o sites ( @xmath63 ) and the cu sites ( @xmath64 ) of a _",
    "finite _ chain , @xmath65 denotes neighboring lattice sites , and @xmath66 refers to the cu@xmath8 sites at the chain ends .",
    "@xmath67 and @xmath68 ( @xmath69 and @xmath70 ) are annihilation ( creation ) operators of a hole with spin @xmath71 on cu and o sites , respectively .",
    "@xmath72 is the hole ( spin @xmath71 ) occupation number and @xmath73 .",
    "this model ignores the contribution of the apical oxygen ions to the energy , which , indeed , play a minor role , because they are essentially divalent ( cf discussion in @xcite ) . because of the quantum origin of alternating cu - o chains , the hole occupation number on cu sites is not rigorously equal to 1 , as tacitly assumed when the charge transfer mechanism was discussed .",
    "this occupation number fluctuates , remaining slightly below 1 ( @xmath74 , as numerically estimated in @xcite ) .",
    "now , a good quantum number is the number of holes ( both , oxygen and copper ) , say @xmath75 in a cf of length @xmath30 .",
    "nevertheless , @xmath59 remains a quantum number , characterizing the hole transfer from a chain .",
    "the relation between @xmath76 and @xmath75 is given by @xmath77 there are strongly correlated models , e.g. , the kondo - reduced emery model ( see @xcite ) , which allow to treat cu ions of cfs as divalent , and oxygen ions as monovalent ( @xmath78 ) or divalent ( @xmath59 ) . note that we include in model ( [ 1 ] ) the shift of the on - site hole energy level , @xmath79 , which is due to non - equivalency of cu@xmath8 and cu@xmath9 ions .",
    "there may be alternate ways to take into account the @xmath79-term ; for instance aligia uses a model @xcite which includes the interaction of charges of neighboring atoms , @xmath64(cu ) and @xmath63(o ) , @xmath80 our description could be interpreted as a simplified version of the @xmath81-term , @xmath82 , where @xmath83 denotes the thermal expectation value for the occupancy of an oxygen site . in the case of re = nd or la , the ionic radii of the rare - earth ions are larger than in the other rebco compounds .",
    "consequently , the interatomic distance is also larger , but the hole hopping amplitude is smaller  in the chains , and in the planes .",
    "we shall discuss below why this circumstance may favor short chain fragments , depending on the oxygen hole chemical potential , @xmath84 , which varies in the rebco series .",
    "we consider the cu@xmath46o@xmath47o@xmath48 chain fragment , described by the emery model ( [ 1 ] ) .",
    "we may determine , say , numerically , its free energy ( here and in the following , the free energies are taken per oxygen atom ) , @xmath85 .",
    "indeed , performing statistical averaging with respect to the internal , fermionic , degrees of freedom ( @xmath59 and possible spin arrangements ) , and disregarding the configurational entropy , the free energy for long chains ( @xmath86 ) has been recently shown to have the form @xcite @xmath87 where @xmath88 and @xmath89 are coefficients which are given by the energy parameters of the emery model ; @xmath89 is , approximately , linear in @xmath90 . in specifying the parameters of the emery model",
    ", we largely follow refs.@xcite .",
    "@xmath91 is taken as the reference level .",
    "measuring the other energy parameters in units of @xmath92 , we set @xmath93 , @xmath94 and @xmath95 , similar to the values in the cuo@xmath2 planes of ybco . the rebco compounds are expected to differ mainly in the value of the hopping amplitude @xmath92 ( being approximately @xmath96 ev @xmath97 k for ybco ) .",
    "as noted before @xcite , the remaining two parameters , the chemical potential @xmath84 and @xmath79 , play an essential role in favoring long or short chains .",
    "@xmath84 equilibrates the hole exchange between the two oxygen hole reservoirs , cuo@xmath2 planes and cfs .",
    "@xmath79 stems from the non - equivalency of the cu@xmath8 and cu@xmath9 sites ( @xmath98 denotes the hole level on a cu@xmath8-site ) .",
    "although @xmath79 is positive , as seen from its relation to @xmath99 , its exact value is not known , neither from experiments nor from band - structure calculations .",
    "in ybco the oxygen atoms of the oxygen deficient planes tend to arrange themselves into long chains at low enough quenching temperatures ; probably even at quite low oxygen content .",
    "in contrast , in labco long chains are predominant only at @xmath100 @xcite . in the rebco compounds ,",
    "the various tendencies in the chain lenghts are expected to be caused by the various ionic radii of their rare - earth constituents ( see table [ ionicradii ] ) . in the model description ( [ 1 ] ) of those compounds , the crucial parameters are the hopping amplitude @xmath92 which depends on the re ionic radius , and the chemical potential which regulates the degree of filling of the 1d o - hole band . to see whether short or long cu - o chains are favored , we compute the free energy per oxygen atom as a function of the chain length . if it increases with length , then short chains are more likely , otherwise longer chains are preferred . for a given set of parameters",
    "one may calculate the free energy in the grand canonical ensemble , thus incorporating the chemical potential @xmath84 , which governs the concentration of holes in a chain . following this scheme one needs , in principle , the whole set of energy levels of the emery model .",
    "however , since the temperatures we are dealing with are much lower than the typical electronic energies , which are of order several thousand k , it is sufficient to include the lowest energy levels in the free energy calculations .",
    "these levels may be determined by using the lanczos algorithm @xcite , as we did in evaluating the free energy of chains with up to @xmath101 oxygen atoms ( plus 7 copper atoms ) . the detailed procedure for calculating the free energies",
    "is described in appendix a.",
    "the free energy of the chains described by the emery model , expression ( [ 0 - 3 ] ) , corresponds in the standard asynnni model to the energy of a cu - o chain with @xmath30 oxygen atoms , neglecting interchain interactions , i.e. @xmath102 a clear difference of @xmath103 and @xmath104 is that @xmath104 decreases monotonically with @xmath30 at @xmath105 , whereas , if the analogous condition @xmath106 is satisfied , @xmath103 exhibits a minimum at finite , but exponentially large value @xmath107 .",
    "it is estimated as exceeding a hundred at temperatures below 300@xmath108 c. hence , the logarithmic correction in the r.h.s . of eq.([0 - 3 ] ) may start playing an important role only at @xmath100 .",
    "@xmath89 in eq.([0 - 3 ] ) depends on temperature , while @xmath24 does not ( in both cases , we did not consider the configurational entropy ) .",
    "accordingly , accepting the emery model as the more fundamental description for the chain fragments , the asynnni model may be modified by introducing an effective , _ temperature  dependent _ coupling @xmath24 , corresponding to @xmath89 in the emery model .",
    "the difference in the coefficients @xmath88 and @xmath89 may not break the analogy with the asynnni model . in relevant experiments ,",
    "the cf ensemble is measured at a fixed oxygen content , thus @xmath88 contributes equally to any realization of cfs and may be rescaled , say , to the value of @xmath89 .",
    "note that eq.([0 - 3 ] ) holds only for sufficiently long chains .",
    "indeed , for short chain fragments , @xmath103 may show oscillations @xcite . to include these subtle features in a statistical description ( for example , in a monte carlo simulation ) , one may deal with the free energies of the short chains separately .",
    "the largest deviation from the expressions ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) occurs at @xmath109 .",
    "thence , to incorporate those oscillations in the simplest fashion , we consider an _ extended _ asynnni model , attributing to the chains with @xmath109 , cu - o - cu , an additional energy @xmath110 . for larger values of @xmath30",
    ", we keep the parameters of the standard asynnni model .",
    "accordingly , the free energy may be cast in the form @xmath111 to substantiate eqs.([0 - 3 ] ) and ( [ fn ] ) , we shall now present results of calculations of the free energy for the emery model of cu - o chain fragments .",
    "let us first roughly estimate a realistic value of @xmath79 . in figure",
    "[ uend ] , the free energy of the emery model is shown , using units appropriate for ybco ( we have chosen the chemical potential @xmath84 at each @xmath79 to assure that the concentration of oxygen holes in the _ longest _ chains we studied is @xmath112 0.3 ) . specifically , the energy parameters are taken in units of @xmath113 ev @xmath97 k , so that the temperature range of experimental interest ( @xmath18 between 300 k and 1200 k ) is between 0.02 and 0.08 . comparing the free energies for long chains to expression eq .",
    "( [ 0 - 4 ] ) ( disregarding , at this stage , @xmath114 ) one finds that @xmath115 corresponds to a moderately attractive @xmath24 , of several hundreds of kelvin in agreement with the experimentally observed disordering of the ortho - ii phase at about 450 k. otherwise , for example , for @xmath116 the free energy grows too rapidly with the chain length , corresponding to an effective repulsion @xmath24 of the order of a few thousands of kelvin ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "increasing @xmath79 leads first to a weaker repulsion , and finally an attractive @xmath24 .",
    "for instance , @xmath117 would imply a value for @xmath24 of the order of several thousand k , being a strong effective attraction .",
    "thereby , by tuning @xmath79 , one may stabilize either short chain fragments ( some realizations at @xmath118 are shown in figure [ figure4 ] ) or very long cu - o chains . while @xmath79 is expected to be essentially a constant for all rebco compounds , the chemical potential @xmath84 may vary , e.g. , with the oxygen content @xmath13 or the re element . in figure [ mu ]",
    "the free energy per oxygen is shown for several values of the chemical potential at the particular choice @xmath115 . with @xmath84 increasing ,",
    "the effective intra - chain interaction @xmath24 between the oxygen atoms in the cu - o chains changes from attraction to repulsion .",
    "this is happening in a fairly broad range , @xmath84=1.5 - 2.0 , where @xmath24 goes from a moderately attractive value ( @xmath119 ) to a moderately repulsive one ( @xmath120 ) .",
    "changing the re element in the rebco compounds implies changing @xmath84 and hence the intra - chain interaction . as will be discussed later",
    ", @xmath24 varies slowly , remaining @xmath121 in the range of relevant values of @xmath84 .",
    "in fact , @xmath114 introduces an important competing effect . in figure [ freefit ]",
    "we depict the free energy per oxygen atom versus @xmath30 for @xmath122 at different temperatures , choosing the chemical potential so that the concentration of oxygen holes is , for long chains , approximately 0.3 , as it is the case for ybco .",
    "@xmath123 is well compatible with that concentration .",
    "one may easily see that the lower the ( quenching ) temperature @xmath90 the larger the effective intra - chain oxygen - oxygen attraction will be .",
    "in addition , at low @xmath90 , the free energy shows an oscillatory behavior for small values of @xmath30 ( see , for example , figure [ freefit ] at @xmath124 ) .",
    "such oscillations are maximal at @xmath125 ( see also figure 1 in @xcite ) .",
    "it is obvious from figure [ freefit ] that the fitting of the free energy to that of the standard asynnni model , eq.([0 - 4 ] ) , is unsatisfactory even in the high temperature region .",
    "the @xmath109 case has to be fitted separately , defining @xmath114 in the extended asynnni model , eq.([fn ] ) .",
    "it should be emphasized , that the effective parameters of the hereby defined _ extended _ asynnni model , @xmath24 and @xmath110 , depend not only on the temperature , but also on @xmath79 .",
    "in addition , they depend on a specific filling of the 1d oxygen hole band , i.e. @xmath84 . the other two couplings of the full asynnni model , @xmath22 and @xmath26 , are of predominantly electrostatic origin , and may be supposed to be constant . of course",
    ", their values do not follow from the emery model .",
    "( at this point , attention may be drawn to another attempt to determine parameters of the ( standard ) asynnni model from first - principles , based , in that case , on linear muffin - tin - orbital calcualtions for ybco @xcite . in that analysis ,",

    "it is evident from figure [ freefitv2 ] that @xmath24 displays a pronounced linear dependence on @xmath90 ( cf , eq.([0 - 3 ] ) , where @xmath89 is also linear in @xmath90 ) , and @xmath24 is practically linear in @xmath79 at a given temperature . to fix @xmath79 ,",
    "one may compare results on the extended asynnni model to experiments .",
    "a possible procedure will be demonstrated now for ybco .",
    "there we estimate @xmath79 by locating the disordering transition of the ortho - ii phase of yba@xmath2cu@xmath3o@xmath126 with @xmath127 , known to occur experimentally at about 450 k @xcite . that transition temperature is found to depend rather sensitively on the choice of @xmath79 , and hence @xmath24 and @xmath110 in the framework of the extended asynnni model .",
    "the lattice gas model is analysed by using standard monte carlo ( mc ) techniques . to simulate the extended asynnni model , one first has to specify the couplings @xmath22 and @xmath26 .",
    "different values have been proposed and studied for the conventional asynnni model @xcite .",
    "here we adopt values which have been argued to reproduce the experimental structural phase diagram of ybco fairly well @xcite , namely , in terms of @xmath24 , @xmath128 as discussed above , @xmath24 is expected to depend on temperature much more strongly than @xmath22 and @xmath26 .",
    "thence , in fixing @xmath22 and @xmath26 , we choose the value of @xmath24 at the ortho - ii disordering temperature , @xmath129 ( note that we checked , by simulations , that choosing the room temperature @xmath19 , instead of @xmath130 , leads to rather minor changes of @xmath22 and @xmath26 , of a few percent , and affects the estimate for @xmath79 only mildly ) .",

    "the order parameter @xmath133 @xcite of the ortho - ii phase is found to drop abruptly at @xmath134 , see figure [ 3doii ] . from figures [ freefitv2 ] and [ freefitv2tilde ] , one obtains @xmath135 and @xmath136 . summarizing ,",
    "we have finally estimated , for ybco , @xmath137 and @xmath138 from the experimental values of @xmath130 and the hole concentration for long chains . in substituting yttrium by another re element , the chemical potential will be changed .",
    "this , in turn , will lead to different values of the effective parameters in the asynnni model .",
    "results of pertinent calculations are depicted in figure [ muvariv2 ] , taking @xmath137 . by changing @xmath84 in between 1.55 and 1.70 ,",
    "one induces only mild changes in @xmath24 , in between -0.15 and -0.1 .",
    "more importantly , we observe in that range a crossover in the tendency to form short or long cu - o chains . obviously , that tendency follows from the fact whether @xmath110 is smaller than @xmath24 , or vice versa . at @xmath138 ( characteristic for ybco )",
    ", the long chains are favored ; at @xmath84 @xmath139 , a compensation holds . at larger values of the chemical potential , short chains will be preferred .",
    "accordingly , for each rebco compound , one may predict the preference for short or long chains from the value of @xmath84 .",
    "although the chemical potential is not precisely known for the various re cases , one may safely assume that it increases with the ionic radius .",
    "as shown in table [ ionicradii ] , these radii vary appreciably .",
    "for instance , they are larger for nd and la than for y. a microscopic description for estimating @xmath84 should invoke the structure of the oxygen hole bands of the chain fragments ( 1d ) as well as of the cu(2 ) planes ( 2d ) .",
    "it has been assumed in @xcite that the 1d oxygen hole band is lower than the 2d band , with an overlap , as shown schematically in figure [ figure_12 ] , where @xmath84 is above the bottom of the 2d hole band . despite a potentially significant charge transfer from chains ( i.e. @xmath140 from each cf of length @xmath30 ) ,",
    "such a band structure is no contradiction .",
    "in fact , at small oxygen content @xmath13 , shorter cfs are preferred , the charge transfer gets effectively surpressed .",
    "the holes transferred from chains become partly localized on the impurity levels and partly 2d carriers , with a rather low , semiconducting , concentration . in the metallic state",
    "the chemical potential intersects the 2d band ; a sufficiently large hole transfer from chains to planes causes an electrostatic shift of the levels , and the 1d band raises with respect to the 2d band .",
    "based on such a description , the transformation from the semiconducting to the metallic state , by changing the oxygen content @xmath13 , can be qualitatively described @xcite . in principle",
    ", one could estimate the variation of @xmath84 with @xmath13 from a self - consistent scheme which would be very tedious , based upon experimental data which have not been established reliably , so far . in the following analysis , we shall , however , assume that the chemical potential is independent of @xmath13 .",
    "this will be sufficient to reproduce the main trends resulting from the change in @xmath84 in the rebco series . to describe the corresponding thermal properties of the chain fragments",
    ", we shall investigate the extended asynnni model , with the parameters @xmath110 and @xmath24 changing with the chemical potential . for @xmath22 and @xmath26",
    ", we shall always take the values for ybco , see above .",
    "because they are associated with coulomb forces on small distances , they are expected to vary only slightly , by a few percents , when substituting y by , say , nd or la . as we checked in simulations",
    ", such a variation will not affect the conclusions .",
    "the results of the monte carlo study will be compared to experimental findings for labco and ndbco @xcite .",
    "the simulations of the extended asynnni model describing rebco compounds have been performed for systems with l @xmath141 l cu sites , imposing full periodic boundary conditions .",
    "usually , l was taken to be 40 ; to estimate the role of finite size effects , a few runs were done with larger lattices .",
    "we employed kawasaki dynamics , keeping the oxygen content @xmath13 constant during a simulation , and choosing the initial and final site of an oxygen atom randomly . the new site ,",
    "if empty , is accepted with a probability given by the boltzmann factor of the change in energy of that possible move . an updating scheme which restricts the hopping of the oxygen atoms to neighboring lattice sites",
    "would be more realistic in mimicing dynamical processes , but slower .",
    "because we are here only interested in equilibrium properties , we employed the faster algorithm . by varying the oxygen content @xmath13 and the temperature @xmath90 , the structural phase diagram may be determined .",
    "figure [ phasediagram ] depicts the phase diagram for the case of ybco , using the values of the effective parameters discussed above .",
    "the phase boundaries have been estimated from the behavior of the order parameters of the various phases and the positions of the maxima in the specific heat , as before @xcite .",
    "the topology of the phase diagram is similar to that obtained for the standard asynnni model in prior computations , e.g. @xcite , including the ortho - i , ortho - ii , and tetragonal phases .",
    "perhaps most notably , the maximal phase transition temperature of the ortho - ii phase is , however , somewhat reduced , in accordance with the experimental findings . by analysing monte carlo equilibrium configurations",
    "one may easily identify the cu - o chain fragments and hence determine , for instance , the thermally averaged concentration of differently coordinated cu ions . in figure [ cu2 ]",
    "the concentration of cu@xmath10 ions , @xmath142 , is shown as a function of the oxygen content for various temperatures , in the ybco case .",
    "while at high temperatures @xmath142 decreases monotonically with increasing oxygen content , one finds a non - monotonic or plateau - like behavior when lowering the temperature , so that one may encounter the ortho - ii phase .",
    "obviously , in the perfect ortho - ii structure , at @xmath143 and sufficiently low temperatures , half of the cu atoms belong to the perfect cu - o chains extending throughout the lattice and half of them are in oxygen - free rows , see figure [ figure1](c ) .",
    "accordingly , the concentration of cu@xmath10 ions in such an ideal configuration is @xmath144 .",
    "experimental results of xas measurements at low and high temperatures @xcite are included in figure [ cu2 ] . agreement between experimental data and theoretical curves is quite satisfactory , except for the point at @xmath145 , low @xmath18 , which may , indeed , have been determined inaccurately in the experiment .",
    "the behavior of @xmath142 versus @xmath13 at @xmath146 k also agrees rather well with the experimental results using nmr - nqr @xcite .",
    "the concentrations of cu@xmath10 , cu@xmath8 and cu@xmath9 ( @xmath142 , @xmath147 , and @xmath148 ) obtained from the mc simulations at @xmath149 k in the case of ybco are shown in figure [ cufoldy ] , together with experimental data ( their accuracy has not been mentioned ) @xcite .",
    "a few experimental points deviate clearly from the theoretical curves .",
    "note , that the experimental data of @xcite plotted in figure [ cufoldy ] obey well the sum rule @xmath150 this identity assumes that all cu ions in the cu(1 ) planes can be identified as cu@xmath10 , cu@xmath8 or cu@xmath9 . with that assumption ,",
    "a second sum rule is evident @xmath151 these two sum rules allow to express two of the concentrations , say , @xmath147 and @xmath148 , by the remaining one , @xmath142 , and the oxygen content @xmath13 ; for instance , @xmath152 the concentrations are allowed to vary in the range defined by the following inequalities , @xmath153 a few points of the experimental set disagree significantly with ( [ rule2 ] ) , several points are beyond the limits defined by ( [ ineq ] ) .",
    "note that there is an uncertainty , reaching up to 0.1 according to @xcite , in determining the oxygen content in the range @xmath154 ( probably , in the region of phase separation ) .",
    "as mentioned above two concentrations can be determined by the remaining third concentration .",
    "taking the latter one as @xmath142 for @xmath155 , @xmath147 for @xmath156 , @xmath148 for @xmath157 , and again @xmath142 for @xmath158 ( @xmath148 would be beyond the limit of the inequality ) , we can fit nicely the revised set of experimental points to theoretical curves in figure [ cufoldy ] .",
    "similar measurements on the concentrations of differently coordinated cu ions have been reported for ndba@xmath2cu@xmath3o@xmath4 ( ndbco ) and laba@xmath2cu@xmath3o@xmath4 ( labco ) @xcite . as argued above",
    ", we propose that the effect of the increase of the ionic radius in nd and la compounds can be incorporated into the microscopic model by an increase in the chemical potential , leading to modified effective parameters in the extended asynnni model .",
    "although @xmath84 is expected to depend on the oxygen content @xmath13 for each rebco compound , we consider a constant @xmath84 for a given re , for reasons stated before .",
    "this simplification seems to be justified in order to detect the main trends .",
    "indeed , when increasing @xmath84 from 1.59 , for ybco , to 1.62 and 1.66 , for ndbco and labco , respectively , the simulated data on @xmath142 , @xmath147 , and @xmath148 agree rather well with the experimental results , see figures [ cufoldnd ] and [ cufoldla ] . for ndbco we can use @xmath147 for determining the other concentrations in the range @xmath159 , as in the ybco - case .",
    "for labco , @xmath147 and @xmath148 have not been accessible for direct measurements in the range @xmath160 ; in this case @xmath142 plays the determining role .",
    "there may be also five- and sixfold coordinated cu ions in cu(1 ) planes , due to a crossing of perpendicular chain fragments .",
    "for example , cu@xmath161 would appear , if an oxygen atom formed a 90@xmath21 configuration with two other oxygen atoms ( all three are supposed to be adjacent to the same cu atom ) .",
    "the energy loss due to a cu@xmath161 ( cu@xmath162 ) ion would be @xmath163 ( @xmath164 ) . from the simulations , the concentration of such ions is seen to be very small for all oxygen contents @xmath13 .",
    "a kink in a cf would be energetically somewhat more favorable , albeit being still rather costly , @xmath22 . at the kink ,",
    "a fourfold coordinated cu ion occurs , although it differs from the conventional cu@xmath9 ion .",
    "such a kink configuration can not easily be described by the emery model .",
    "another important quantity related to the chain fragments of the oxygen deficient cu(1 ) planes , is the charge ( hole ) transfer , @xmath14 , to the cuo@xmath2 planes .",
    "it depends on the chemical potential as well as on other external parameters such as @xmath13 and @xmath18 .",
    "@xmath165 , the expectation number of holes ( thermal averaging ) leaving a cf of length @xmath30 , should be @xmath140 ( see figure [ ch_tr ] , showing a rather non - trivial dependence on @xmath30 ) ; it is associated with the expectation number of oxygen and copper holes @xmath166 through ( [ n_m ] ) . for long cfs in ybco",
    ", one has @xmath167 ; but for short chain fragments , it may differ significantly .",
    "the average concentration of oxygen holes transferred from the chains , the charge transfer @xmath14 , may be approximated as , see @xcite , @xmath168 where @xmath169 is the average number of cfs of length @xmath30 .",
    "the factor of 1/2 appears , because holes from one cu(1 ) plane are supplied to two cu(2 ) planes .",
    "note that one can calculate the number of holes @xmath75 in the framework of the emery model , at least for fairly short chains , see appendix a , which may then be extrapolated to longer chains .",
    "figure [ chargetransfer ] shows the charge transfer versus oxygen content for a set of equidistant temperatures , obtained from simulating the extended asynnni model for the ybco case .",
    "one observes that below @xmath170 the charge transfer to cuo@xmath2 planes is extremely small . in this regime ,",
    "in the tetragonal phase , short chain fragments dominate , contributing much less to the charge transfer than the long chains .",
    "the preference for short chains could be reduced by going to very low ( quenching ) temperatures which , however , are usually not accessible experimentally ( recall that @xmath18 is bounded by @xmath19 from below ) .",
    "the tetragonal phase is still semiconducting , and the holes are mainly localized in cuo@xmath2 planes in the vicinity of the cf from which they originated .",
    "the formation of longer cfs leads to a significant increase of the hole transfer , giving rise to the semiconducting - to - metal transformation .",
    "the charge transfer displays a plateau - like behavior near @xmath127 , reflecting the well - known 60 k plateau in the transition temperature to the superconducting phase in ybco at that oxygen content .",
    "this aspect has been discussed in quite a few publications before .",
    "in many experiments the close relationship between the superconducting transition temperature @xmath12 and @xmath14 has been found @xcite .",
    "for instance , @xmath12 was argued to be linear @xcite or quadratic in @xmath14 @xcite . in both cases , the plateau in @xmath12 would correspond to one in @xmath14 .",
    "a second , so - called 90 k plateau in @xmath12 versus @xmath13 occurs at @xmath171 , where @xmath14 increases monotonically , while @xmath12 remains almost constant .",
    "overdoping is believed to be responsible for that plateau @xcite : @xmath12 practically saturates when @xmath14 becomes larger than the optimal hole concentration ( @xmath172 ) . in figure [ chargetransferall ]",
    "the charge tranfer @xmath14 versus oxygen content @xmath13 is depicted at @xmath173 k for three values of the chemical potential , mimicing , as before , ybco , ndbco , and labco , i.e. @xmath84 = 1.59 , 1.62 and 1.66 .",
    "one readily sees , in accordance with the experiments , that the low - temperature plateau in @xmath12 versus @xmath13 is expected to be much less pronounced in ndbco @xcite and absent in labco @xcite . in that figure",
    ", we also included monte carlo data for @xmath174 , mimicing a rebco compound where the rare earth ions would be even smaller than yttrium , like ybbco ( see table [ ionicradii ] ) .",
    "indeed , it was shown experimentally @xcite that the 60 k plateau in ybbco is even more manifest than in ybco , in accordance with the mc data .",
    "mc simulations allow to compute easily the average length of cu - o chain fragments , @xmath175 .",
    "results are displayed in figure [ chainlength ] .",
    "@xmath175 is given by the ratio ( total length of cfs)/(total number of cfs ) .",
    "the numerator is identical with the number of oxygen ions , while the denominator is , neglecting kinks and crossings of cfs , one half of the cu@xmath8 atoms .",
    "thence , one would obtain @xmath176 .",
    "that formula has been used in @xcite , to express the experimental findings for @xmath147 for ybco , ndbco , and labco in terms of @xmath175 . however",
    ", care is needed in doing that . in figure",
    "[ chainlength ] , we compare monte carlo results for @xmath175 invoking the approximate formula to those using the correct expression for the average chain lenght . indeed , the overall agreement is fair , but there are obvious differences near @xmath100 .",
    "the present paper has been motivated , _ first _ , by recent experimental data on cu - o chain fragments @xcite , and , _ second _ , by the wish of elaborating and concretizing the idea to relate a microscopic description of those fragments to a statistical analysis , i.e. to relate the quantum mechanics of individual chains to the statistical mechanics of their ensembles @xcite .",
    "our main considerations and findings may be summarized as follows .",
    "* we consider the emery model , which belongs to the family of strongly correlated fermionic ( hole ) models , incorporating into it the effect of chain ends ( @xmath79-term ) .",
    "we assume that the lowest , cu - like , band is completely filled , whereas the intermediate , o - like , band is partly occupied .",
    "the occupancy of the latter band is regulated by the chemical potential @xmath84 , which determines the equilibrium of the oxygen hole reservoirs in the cuo@xmath2 planes and cfs . * in accordance with experimental results ,",
    "the chemical potential level is assumed to be located in the 1d oxygen hole band of the cu - o chain fragments .",
    "the oxygen hole concentration in long cfs is determined by the chemical potential @xmath84 . *",
    "the oxygen hole number in a cf follows from the number of holes leaving the chain .",
    "there is essentially no charge transfer from short cfs of lengths @xmath109 and 2 .",
    "this explains the predominance of fairly short cfs in the semiconducting state of the rebco compounds . *",
    "the `` semiconductor - metal '' transformation is governed by the dependence of the chemical potential on the oxygen content @xmath13 .",
    "analysis of finite chains by means of the emery model shows that cfs of minimal length occur less often when @xmath84 decreases .",
    "this is expected to be accompanied by an increasing number of holes transferred from chains to planes .",
    "coulomb forces lead to the lowering of @xmath84 , which favors longer cfs , giving rise to an additional charge transfer , etc . * in our analysis , the rebco compounds have been characterised by different , but fixed values of @xmath84 .",
    "however , in reality , with @xmath13 increasing , @xmath84 is believed to decrease proportionally to @xmath14 , i.e. the hole doping of the cuo@xmath2 planes . using figure [ muvariv2 ]",
    ", these changes of @xmath84 could be incorporated into the calculations . *",
    "an important role in the emery model is played by @xmath79 ; the energy loss stemming from the ends of a cf determines the effective attraction or repulsion between the oxygen atoms in cfs .",
    "in fact , ignoring this term would result in a very strong o - o repulsion in the chains ( of the order of several hundreds mev in the case of ybco , where the concentration of oxygen holes in long cfs is about 0.3 ) .",
    "experimental data allow one to estimate @xmath79 to be @xmath177 in units of the hopping term @xmath92 of the emery model . *",
    "the free energy of the emery model has been calculated for individual cfs , characterized by their length @xmath30 , as a function of the chemical potential @xmath84 , @xmath79 , and the temperature @xmath90 . for specific rebco compounds , @xmath84 and @xmath79",
    "can be fixed using experimental data , e.g. , for the oxygen hole concentration and the disordering temperature of the ortho ",
    "ii phase . by comparison of the free energy , the values of the parameters of an _ extended _ asynnni model can then be estimated . in the framework of that model ,",
    "the structural phase diagrams of the rebco compounds can be conveniently studied , using , for instance , monte carlo simulations .",
    "* the larger the ionic radius of the rebco compound the higher the chemical potential , and the shorter the cu - o chain fragments . * analysing the extended asynnni model for various re constituents , we also computed macroscopic properties such as the concentration of differently coordinated cu ions and the charge transfer from the chain fragments .    in conclusion , the theoretical approach presented in this paper ( start from microscopic calculations ,",
    "identify effective parameters of a statistical model as well as , based on experimental results , their values , and finally perform simulations ) , allows to reproduce main trends in the statistical properties of cu - o chain fragments throughout the various rebco compounds .",
    "refinements and extensions , based on additional experimental data , are possible .",
    "we should like to thank h. ltgemeier for informing us about his experimental results . financial support by the russian foundation for basic research , the research council of norway ( programme for supercomputing ) , and by intas ( project 93 - 211 ) is gratefully acknowlegded .",
    "the hamiltonian of the emery model for a cf , characterized by @xmath30 and @xmath59 , deals with @xmath178 fermions which are spin-1/2 holes . positive integers @xmath59 ( @xmath179 ) describe the charge transfer from a cf .",
    "the eigenstates of this hamiltonian can be easily divided into blocks which correspond to different numbers @xmath180 ( @xmath181 ) and , at given @xmath180 , to different total spin projections ( @xmath182 ) .",
    "any block can be further subdivided into two blocks which consist of either symmetric or antisymmetric states with respect to the central cu atom of a cf .",
    "the size of actual blocks grows fastly with @xmath30 : cfs with @xmath183 oxygen atoms , plus 7 copper atoms , are still accessible for calculations of a substantial number of the low lying energy levels .",
    "our conjecture is that the cf properties , including the concentration of holes , depend on the chemical potential @xmath84 which , in turn , is a function of the hole doping .",
    "thus , we must calculate the grand canonical partition function : @xmath184/t},\\ ] ] where @xmath185 runs over all the states within the block at given @xmath180 and @xmath186 .",
    "the temperatures of interest do not exceed 1200 k , which is low on the energy scale of the model ( [ 1 ] ) .",
    "indeed , e.g. , including one thousand low lying energy levels at @xmath101 , we can properly evaluate the partition function ( doubling the number of low lying states , one does not change the free energy significantly ) .    according to @xcite ,",
    "one has @xmath187 , provided the copper hole occupation number is equal to one .",
    "we incorporate this fact , demanding the average total hole number @xmath188 for the longest chains ( @xmath101 oxygen and seven copper atoms ) , analysed using the lanczos algorithm @xcite .",
    "thus , @xmath189 is defined as @xmath190/kt}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath191 is then numerically determined from the constraint @xmath192 for @xmath101 .    in the framework of the lanczos algorithm @xcite ,",
    "applied to a block of the states @xmath193 , we can find , say , the @xmath194 lowest eigenvalues .",
    "@xmath195 iterations should guarantee convergence of @xmath194 eigenfunctions .",
    "there may be a problem with the lanczos algorithm : it fails to distinguish two or more degenerate eigenvalues .",
    "however , this is not a serious problem in our case , since the accidental degeneracy occurs only rarely in the emery model .",
    "this has been checked by calculating exactly the eigenvalues for cfs up to @xmath196 .    on leave from landau institute for theoretical physics , chernogolovka , moscow district 142432 , russia .",
