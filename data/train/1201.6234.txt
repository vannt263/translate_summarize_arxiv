    "while considering optimal symmetric @xmath43 cloning the optimized figure of merit is the average single - copy fidelity .",
    "we express the average fidelity as @xmath44 , where the operator @xmath45 is isomorphic to a completely - positive trace - preserving map  @xcite ( cptp ) which performs the cloning operation and @xmath46 , where @xmath47 is the density matrix of a qubit from the cloned set .",
    "the matrix @xmath48 is given explicitly for any phase - covariant cloner as : @xmath49 where @xmath50 and @xmath51 for @xmath52 , and the angle bracket stands for averaging over the input qubit distribution @xmath53 .",
    "we find the optimal cloning map @xmath45 by maximising the functional @xmath54 .",
    "first , let us note that the optimal cloning map @xmath45 must satisfy the following symmetry conditions imposed by the symmetry of a mirror phase - covariant set of qubits , i.e. , @xmath55 } [ r_z(\\phi)^*\\otimes r_z(\\phi)^{\\otimes2},\\chi]=0 $ ] and @xmath56=0 $ ] .",
    "second , we assume symmetric cloning , and therefore we require that both clones have the same fidelity .",
    "thus , we demand @xmath57=0 $ ] . moreover",
    ", we can show that elements of @xmath45 must be real since maximized fidelity depends linearly only on the real part of the off - diagonal elements",
    ". we must also remember that @xmath45 must preserve trace , i.e. , @xmath58=\\openone$ ] .",
    "all the above conditions imply the following form of the map @xmath45 being a mixture of two cptp maps : @xmath59 where @xmath60 and @xmath61 are free parameters . since we can write the cloning fidelity as @xmath62 it is apparent that in order to achieve maximal fidelity assuming @xmath63 we must set @xmath64 .",
    "now , we can derive the expression for @xmath65 demanding that @xmath66 .",
    "as one of the solutions we obtain @xmath67 where @xmath68",
    ". however , at this point we can not conclude that it is optimal .      as noted by audenaert and de moor  @xcite the problem of designing an optimal cloning machine can be solved by means of semidefinite programming .",
    "moreover , it was noted that as long as @xmath45 is a cptp map in a convex set , there are only global extrema . it can be shown that @xmath45 maximizes fidelity @xmath69 $ ] if the following conditions are satisfied : @xmath70 where @xmath71 is a positive semidefinite matrix of lagrange multipliers ensuring that @xmath45 is cptp map , i.e. , @xmath72 .",
    "the operator @xmath73 is derived by demanding that the variance of fidelity @xmath54 over @xmath45 should be equal to zero . if the condition ( [ eq : chi1 ] )",
    "is satisfied , then for any cptp map @xmath45 we obtain @xmath74 \\geq 0 $ ] .",
    "it also follows from the trace preservation condition that @xmath75 .",
    "hence , the fidelity @xmath54 is bounded by the trace preservation condition and @xmath76 $ ] .",
    "if inequality is saturated by @xmath45 , then @xmath45 represents the optimal cloning transformation .    for mpcc",
    "we have @xmath77\\,\\openone_{\\rm in}.\\ ] ] henceforth , it can be easily shown that @xmath78 .",
    "the eigenvalues of operator @xmath79 can be expressed in terms of @xmath48 matrix elements in the following way : @xmath80 where @xmath81 .",
    "all the eigenvalues are double degenerated . moreover , we have @xmath82 thus , @xmath83 and @xmath84 . since @xmath85 , @xmath86 , we conclude that @xmath87 is a positive semidefinite matrix .",
    "thus , we have shown that the conditions  ( [ eq : chi1 ] ) and  ( [ eq : chi2 ] ) are satisfied , which completes the proof .",
    "in our case the equation relating beam - splitter transmittances ( @xmath88 ) does not hold and we have @xmath89 . hence additional filtering operations are required in order to maintain the maximum achievable fidelity of the setup .",
    "this additional filtering manifests itself in two ways .",
    "first , one needs to unbalance the ancilla - dependent filtering performed by filters f in both bdas .",
    "we require @xmath90 and @xmath91 for the bda1 and bda2 , respectively , where @xmath92 note that @xmath93 in the ideal case for @xmath94 and @xmath95 for the applied pdbs .",
    "second , the realization of the mpcc with the pdbs where @xmath96 requires applying an additional unconditional filtering .",
    "this filtering is polarization - dependent and is performed regardless of the state of the ancillary photon .",
    "the polarization dependent transmittances @xmath97 and @xmath98 for the @xmath99 and @xmath100-polarized photons , respectively , need to satisfy the following relation : @xmath101 where @xmath102 ( @xmath103 for @xmath94 ) is a constant value fixed by the parameters of the pdbs ( in our case @xmath104 ) , and both @xmath97 and @xmath98 should have the largest possible values in order to maximize the efficiency of the setup .",
    "therefore , we apply an additional unconditional filtering only for the @xmath100-polarized photons since the optimal transmittances are @xmath105 and @xmath106",
    ". please note that for our pdbs @xmath107 and in the opposite case the best choice of the parameters is @xmath108 and @xmath109 .",
    "moreover , if there are any other systematic uniform polarization - dependent losses @xmath110 and @xmath111 we can compensate for them by setting @xmath112 .    to summarize the above - mentioned corrections , the overall filtering operations in the first mode are described by @xmath113 and in the second mode by @xmath114 where @xmath115 ( @xmath116 ) is kronecker s delta and is equal to 1 iff the polarization @xmath117 of the ancillary photon is @xmath100 ( @xmath99 ) .    to implement the required filtering , additional polarization - independent filters fa1 and fa2 are placed at the output modes .",
    "these two filters together with the filters in both bdas are sufficient to perform filtering operation described by eqs .",
    "( [ eq : filter1 ] ) and  ( [ eq : filter2 ] ) .",
    "the usage of additional filtering saves the maximum achievable fidelity at the expense of lowering the success probability of the scheme .",
    "using pdba transmittances and the parameter @xmath65 of the cloned state one can express the expected success probability of the scheme in the form of @xmath118 where @xmath42 .",
    "by using the same setup we implemented the generalized pcc ( see tab .",
    "[ tab : pcc ] ) which is a special case of the axisymmetric cloner described in ref .",
    "@xcite . in order to perform arbitrary axisymmetric cloning we set parameters of filters according to the following relations : @xmath119 and @xmath120 where @xmath121 is given by eq .",

    "please note that we could have also picked ancillary state at random ( as for the mpcc ) , but then we would have had to block all the output modes for half of the cases .",
    "in order to measure success probability we need to estimate the inherent technological losses of the scheme and the initial photonic rate .",
    "the technological losses occur as a result of detector efficiencies , fiber coupling losses or back reflections .",
    "the coincidence rate @xmath129 measured at the end of the working cloner can be expressed as    @xmath130    where @xmath37 denotes the success probability of the cloning scheme , @xmath131 denotes the transmittance of the setup due to technological losses and @xmath132 is the initial rate of photon pairs from the source . to compensate for the technological losses and the initial photon rate we use the following calibration procedure : pdbs is placed on a translation state allowing us to shift it slightly so that the reflected beam is no longer coupled .",
    "we use @xmath23 for the input state knowing that the beam splitter would decrease the coincidence rate by the factor of @xmath133 . in this configuration",
    "we remove all the neutral density filters and measure the calibration coincidence rate @xmath134 at the end of the scheme .",
    "one can clearly see that @xmath135 so the success probability of the cloning operation can be expressed by combining eqs .",
    "( [ eq : cc_rate ] ) and  ( [ eq : calib ] ) : @xmath136 this equation allows us to obtain the success probability of the cloning operation from the measurement of two coincidence rates : the first is the coincidence rate of the working cloner and the second is the calibration coincidence rate . note that eqs .",
    "( [ eq : psucc ] ) and  ( [ eq : pex ] ) describe the same quantity .",
