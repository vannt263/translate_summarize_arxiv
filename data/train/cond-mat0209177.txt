    "<S> the recent bose - einstein condensation of ultracold atoms with attractive interactions led us to consider the novel possibility to probe the stability of its ground state in arbitrary three - dimensional harmonic traps . </S>",
    "<S> we performed a quantitative analysis of the critical number of atoms through a full numerical solution of the mean field gross - pitaevskii equation . </S>",
    "<S> characteristic limits are obtained for reductions from three to two and one dimensions , in perfect cylindrical symmetries as well as in deformed ones .    </S>",
    "<S> 2 the predicted collapsing behavior of the condensed systems with attractive two - body atomic interactions  @xcite , first observed in experiments with @xmath0li  @xcite , was recently tested in experiments with @xmath1rb  @xcite . in the experiments described in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , and more recently in @xcite , by means of feshbach resonance techniques  @xcite , the two - body interaction was tuned from positive to negative values . besides the fact that the experimental results qualitatively agree with the theory , and confirm results of previous variational treatments  @xcite , they also show a consistent quantitative deviation of about 20% from the mean - field predicted critical number of atoms , @xmath2  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the asymmetry of the trap was shown in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite to be responsible for about 4% of the observed deviation .    in this respect </S>",
    "<S> , it is relevant to obtain precise and reliable numerical results for the mean - field calculations , in order to probe their consistency and possible limitations . </S>",
    "<S> the actual experimental atomic traps are in general harmonic and non - symmetric . </S>",
    "<S> extreme asymmetric traps have been recently employed in experimental investigations with condensates constrained to quasi - one ( 1d )  @xcite or quasi - two dimensions ( 2d )  @xcite , exploring theoretical analysis considered by several authors  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a non symmetric three - dimensional ( 3d ) trap is reported in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , with the frequencies given by @xmath3hz .    considering the general non - symmetric traps that have been employed </S>",
    "<S> , the accuracy of the comparison between experiments and the results of mean - field approximation relies in precise calculations using arbitrary three - dimensional traps . in case of attractive two - body interaction , </S>",
    "<S> the maximum critical number of atoms for a stable system is one of the interesting observables to study , which is also related to the collapse of the wave - function of the system . in these cases , where the two - body scattering length is negative and </S>",
    "<S> the kinetic energy can not be considered to be a small perturbation , the gross - pitaevskii mean field approximation has been applied , given reliable results in explaining the observations in the stable ( non - collapsing ) conditions  @xcite .    before presenting the mean - field equation for an arbitrary 3d case , </S>",
    "<S> let us analyze qualitatively the collapse phenomenon for asymmetric traps . </S>",
    "<S> the interaction energy is proportional to the square of the density , varying with the negative two - body scattering length . for traps with cylindrical ( or almost cylindrical ) shapes , </S>",
    "<S> there are two quite different situations : one , pancake - like , with the frequencies in the transverse directions being smaller than the frequency in the longitudinal direction ; the other , cigar - like ( quasi-1d ) , with the frequency in the longitudinal direction smaller than the frequencies in the perpendicular directions . for a true 1d system </S>",
    "<S> , one does not expect the collapse of the system with increasing number of atoms  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , it happens that a realistic 1d limit is not a true 1d system , with the density of particles still increasing due to the strong restoring forces in the perpendicular directions  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the relevance of the quasi-1d trap have been pointed out in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , to control the condensate motion . </S>",
    "<S> but , as we are going to see , the critical number of particles in the quasi-1d limit is smaller than the critical number of particles in the 2d limit , if we just exchange the longitudinal and perpendicular frequencies . </S>",
    "<S> the physical reason for that behavior is the increase of the average density in the cigar - like configuration relative to the pancake like one for the same number of atoms , implying in a strong collapsing force in the first case and consequently the cigar - like geometry is a more unstable configuration compared to the pancake like one . </S>",
    "<S> this conclusion is in apparent contradiction with the remark made in section iv of ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , saying that , considering the better collapse - avoiding properties ,  the cigar - shaped trap is the optimal one \" . </S>",
    "<S> we are going to discuss this problem in detail and clarify this issue .    in the following , </S>",
    "<S> we revise the gross - pitaevskii ( gp ) formalism , for an atomic system with arbitrary non - spherically symmetric harmonic trap . </S>",
    "<S> the bose - einstein condensate , at zero temperature , in the gp mean - field approximation is given by @xmath4 where @xmath5 , @xmath6 is the mass of the atom , @xmath7 is the chemical potential , and the wave - function @xmath8 is normalized to the number of particles @xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> the arbitrary geometry of the trap is parameterized by three different frequencies @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 . for convenience , </S>",
    "<S> it is appropriate to define the frequencies according to their magnitude , such that , in the present work we assume @xmath13 .    here we will be concerned only with systems that have attractive two - body interactions [ @xmath14 , in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ sch ] ) ] . in this case , it was first shown numerically , in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , that the system becomes unstable if a maximum critical number of atoms , @xmath2 , is achieved . </S>",
    "<S> we present precise results for a critical parameter @xmath15 , directly related to the maximum number of atoms , in a general non - symmetric configuration of the trap .    by rewriting eq.([sch ] ) in dimensionless units : @xmath16\\phi \\label{sch2},\\ ] ] where @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 , with @xmath20 the oscillator length @xmath21 is defined in terms of @xmath22 , which is taken as the geometrical mean value of the frequencies : @xmath23 for strong non - symmetric cases , particularly when comparing the two extreme cylindrical - shape geometries , @xmath24 ( pancake - shape ) and @xmath25 ( cigar - shape ) , it is expected a noticeable difference between the corresponding critical number of particles .    </S>",
    "<S> we define a parameter @xmath15 , related to the critical number of trapped atoms @xmath2 as in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite : @xmath26 this parameter is a maximum critical limit for stable solutions of the dimensionless eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ sch2 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> it will depend only on the ratio of the frequencies of the trap . within the precision given in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is @xmath15 for spherically symmetric traps . in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , the critical number was calculated for a nonsymmetrical geometry , but in a case that the frequency ratio is not too far from the unity ( @xmath29 ) , giving a result for the number of atoms almost equal to the spherical one .    in the experiments with </S>",
    "<S> @xmath1rb  @xcite , they have considered an almost cylindrical  cigar - type \" symmetry , with the three frequencies given by 17.47 hz , 17.24 hz and 6.80 hz . with this symmetry , </S>",
    "<S> they have obtained @xmath30 ( statistical ) @xmath31 ( systematic ) . in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , assuming the cylindrical symmetry @xmath32hz @xmath33 hz , it was obtained @xmath34 , a value about 4% lower than @xmath28 .    in our numerical approach , the calculation </S>",
    "<S> is performed by evolving the nonlinear equation ( [ sch2 ] ) through imaginary time  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the evolution is performed for an initial value of the normalization ( [ philbd ] ) till the wave function relaxes to the ground state . </S>",
    "<S> the wave function is renormalized after each time step . </S>",
    "<S> the process is repeated systematically for larger values of the normalization , until a critical limit is reached . at this critical limit </S>",
    "<S> the ground state becomes unstable . </S>",
    "<S> the time evolution is done with a semi - implicit second order finite difference algorithm . </S>",
    "<S> an alternating scheme is used in the @xmath35 and @xmath36 direction , with a split step in the @xmath37 direction . </S>",
    "<S> this procedure is done only for @xmath38 , taking advantage of the reflection symmetry of the ground state . </S>",
    "<S> we consider 100@xmath39 grid points and time step equal to @xmath40 , verifying that the algorithm is stable for long time evolution . as we increment the normalization , approaching the critical limit , the wave function starts to shrink . </S>",
    "<S> so , in order to maintain the precision , we introduce an automatic reduction of the grid sizes , @xmath41 , @xmath42 , and @xmath43 , gauged by the respective root mean - square - radius in each direction .    in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 1 we show our main results for the critical constant @xmath15 , covering many different geometries . </S>",
    "<S> we plot @xmath44 ( and @xmath15 in the rhs @xmath45axis ) as a function of @xmath46 , which is defined by @xmath47    we show several curves in which we kept constant the ratio @xmath48 ( solid - lines ) . </S>",
    "<S> the values of @xmath48 are indicated inside the figure , just below the corresponding plot . </S>",
    "<S> the dashed and dotted - lines correspond to cylindrical ( @xmath49 ) and deformed cylindrical ( @xmath50 ) symmetries for the trap , where @xmath51 is the deformation parameter , as it will be explained . in the left - hand - side ( lhs ) of these plots </S>",
    "<S> we have @xmath52 ( cigar - shape ) ; and , in the right - hand - side , @xmath53 ( pancake - shape ) . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath15 can be determined for any symmetry that was not shown , by interpolating the already given results . </S>",
    "<S> the results for the complete non - symmetric case are consistent with the previously obtained values in cylindrical symmetry  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the maximum value for the critical number @xmath15 is obtained for the spherically symmetric case ( @xmath54 ) .    as already observed , fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1 includes previous calculations in the limit of the quasi 1d ( cigar - shape ) and quasi 2d ( pancake - shape ) symmetries ( see dashed - line ) . </S>",
    "<S> however , for the sake of comparison with previous results obtained by several authors , we also present in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2 the cylindrical pancake - type ( @xmath55 ) and cigar - type ( @xmath56 ) results . in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2 , for cylindrical geometries , we compare our exact results , for @xmath57 as a function of @xmath46 , with the corresponding variational ones of refs.@xcite . the variational results ( dashed - lines ) </S>",
    "<S> are consistently a bit higher than the exact ones . for @xmath58 ( @xmath59 ) , </S>",
    "<S> the exact and variational results for the critical constant are @xmath600.676 and 0.776 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> they are consistent with the quasi-1d limits given in refs .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . when @xmath61 , the variational 2d limit @xmath62 of ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite is comparable with our exact result ( @xmath63 ) . _ in this case , the quasi-2d limit coincide with the true 2d limit _  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite .    considering the present analysis </S>",
    "<S> , we observe that @xmath2 in a cigar - like ( quasi-1d ) trap is smaller than @xmath2 in a pancake - like ( quasi-2d ) trap . and , as we deform a cigar - like trap , @xmath2 also increases . </S>",
    "<S> we need to clarify this matter , which is the subject of the next four paragraphs , because such result is apparently contradicting a remark made in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , saying that  the cigar - shaped trap is the optimal one \" .    as shown in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite and also in the present calculation , in a deformed cylindrical symmetry , the cigar shape ( with one of the frequencies smaller than the other two ) is more favorable to obtain a larger value of @xmath15 than the pancake - shape symmetry ( with one of the frequencies larger than the other two ) . </S>",
    "<S> see , for example , in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1 , the two extreme points of the curve with @xmath64 . </S>",
    "<S> this results from the definition of @xmath15 , eq .  ( [ k ] ) , in terms of the averaged oscillator length @xmath21 . </S>",
    "<S> however , the maximum value of @xmath15 can only be directly related with the maximum value of @xmath2 in case that @xmath22 is kept fixed . and , </S>",
    "<S> with @xmath21 fixed , @xmath2 is maximized for @xmath65 , corresponding to the spherically symmetric case ( @xmath66 ) . </S>",
    "<S> if we fix @xmath21 and @xmath48 , @xmath2 is maximized for a deformed cylindrical symmetry with @xmath67 , as one can see from fig . 1 .    considering exact cylindrical traps , by exchanging the frequencies ( which , obviously , does not keep constant the averaged frequency @xmath22 ) , it is valid the following ratio that was obtained in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite : @xmath68 this result favors the pancake - like symmetry ( @xmath69 ) , to obtain a larger value for @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> consider , for example , a cylindrical pancake - type trap with @xmath70 , in comparison with a cigar - type trap with @xmath71 . </S>",
    "<S> we notice that , in this case , @xmath72 , implying that with such pancake - like trap ( @xmath73 ) one can obtain about 60% more particles than with the corresponding cigar - like trap ( @xmath74 ) . </S>",
    "<S> let us consider the recent experiment with quasi-1d ( cigar - like ) trap used in the formation and propagation of matter wave solitons , with @xmath0li  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in this case , it was used axial and radial frequencies , respectively , equal to 3.2 hz and @xmath75625 hz  @xcite ; or , @xmath76 625 hz , @xmath77 3.2 hz and @xmath78 0.00513 . </S>",
    "<S> so , as shown in fig.2 , we are practically in the limit @xmath79 , which gives @xmath80 . considering that the scattering length was tuned to @xmath81 ( @xmath82 is the bohr radius ) , the maximum number of atoms in this quasi-1d trap is @xmath83 . if we exchange the radial and axial frequencies in this experiment , going from a cigar - like to a pancake - like trap , @xmath84 3.2 hz , @xmath85 625 hz and @xmath86 . in this case , @xmath87 . </S>",
    "<S> so , the critical number in the quasi-2d limit is about 66% larger than the corresponding number of atoms in the quasi-1d limit , and @xmath88 .    </S>",
    "<S> the discussion about the best way to distribute the frequencies to obtain the maximum number of atoms was first considered in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , arriving that the best is to do a spherical trap , for achieving maximum density . </S>",
    "<S> ( in their almost spherical trap they have obtained from @xmath75600 to @xmath751300 atoms , in an overall agreement with theoretical predictions * @xcite*. ) the point is that , to say what is the best configuration for the maximum number of atoms we must also say what is the _ constraint _ in the frequencies . if the constraint is to keep fixed the product @xmath89 than the maximum number will be given for the maximum @xmath15 [ as shown in eq.([k ] ) ] , that happens in a spherical symmetry , in agreement with ref.@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> but , if two frequencies are equal and given _ a priori _ , than the best configuration to increase @xmath2 is to make the third frequency equal to zero , in agreement with ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , if only one frequency is kept fixed , than the extreme pancake shape will contain more atoms , by making the remaining frequencies go to zero .    as a final remark about the maximization of @xmath2 </S>",
    "<S> , we note that , for attractive two - body interactions , the frequencies in all three directions can not be initially zero . in the experimental process of condensation </S>",
    "<S> , the atoms must be trapped while going from higher temperature @xmath90 to the critical one , @xmath91 . by making the frequencies too small </S>",
    "<S> , the @xmath91 will be smaller and the condensation harder to achieve [ as shown in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , @xmath92 , where @xmath93 is the total number of particles in the trap ] . </S>",
    "<S> once the condensate is achieved , we can switch off some of the frequencies , and obtain a finite maximum value for @xmath2 , as observed in fig . 2 for @xmath94 . in the present work , </S>",
    "<S> we are concerned with the case of zero temperature . </S>",
    "<S> effects of temperature on the collapse and on @xmath2 , for spherically symmetric case , have been discussed , for example , in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath2 is maximized by making @xmath22 as small as possible . </S>",
    "<S> however , a discontinuity exists when taking all the three frequencies exactly zero . without trap </S>",
    "<S> the collapse will occur for any number of particles .    </S>",
    "<S> we must stress that fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1 also includes novel non - symmetric cigar - type geometries @xmath95 and elliptical pancake - type geometries @xmath53 , where @xmath51 is the excentricity of the ellipsis . in particular , </S>",
    "<S> the dotted line in fig.1 gives the critical values of @xmath15 for @xmath96 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , one could replot , as in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2 , a series of curves whose limiting cases describe non - symmetric cigar- or pancake - like symmetries . in the 1d and 2d limits , one can obtain critical quasi-1d and quasi-2d numbers , for each @xmath51 .    one can also obtain an interesting result , for asymmetric cigar - shape traps , where @xmath97 , following the approach given in section ii of ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the assumption made in @xcite to reduce the 3d equation to a 1d equation can be justified in the limit when the forces in the transverse directions are the main responsible for the trapping potential . </S>",
    "<S> so , in the limit @xmath98 , we are able to generalize the solitonic 1d equation for a cigar - shaped trap , deformed by a given ratio @xmath99 between the transverse direction frequencies . in this case , @xmath100 can not be arbitrarily larger . </S>",
    "<S> also , by a scaling procedure applied to the equation for different values of @xmath51 , using our previous exact result , we have @xmath101 this generalizes the cigar - shape quasi-1d results of @xcite ( with @xmath51 such that we still have @xmath102 ) . the 1d solid line given in fig.2 </S>",
    "<S> is also applied to deformed cigar - shaped symmetries if we replace @xmath103 by @xmath104 in the @xmath45axis . </S>",
    "<S> this result may be relevant for asymmetric waveguide propagation as one can deform the cigar - type symmetry and control the collapsing condition . from eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ ncigar ] ) we observe that the maximum critical number @xmath2 will increase when deforming the cigar - like symmetry by a factor proportional to @xmath105 .    now , let us see the effect of deformation in the same example of the cigar - shaped geometry used in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , with @xmath0li gas . </S>",
    "<S> we use the same value of @xmath106 , with @xmath85 625 s@xmath107 , and take @xmath108 . as given in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ ncigar ] ) , we go from @xmath109 @xmath110 to @xmath111 @xmath112 , or @xmath113 @xmath114 . </S>",
    "<S> it means , an increase of @xmath759% when @xmath96 ; and @xmath7519% when @xmath115 . in case , @xmath116 , the approximation considered in the wave - function separation , as given in @xcite , is not valid . in such case </S>",
    "<S> we are reaching the other deformed pancake - like symmetry , where @xmath117 . </S>",
    "<S> however , in the pancake geometry , the effect of deformation in @xmath2 is negligible . by comparing the quasi pancake - like geometry with the quasi cigar - like geometry , </S>",
    "<S> the number @xmath2 in the cigar - like geometry is much more sensitive to deformations .    </S>",
    "<S> we have also studied the behavior of the root mean square radius for the case @xmath118 . </S>",
    "<S> we verified that , as the system approaches the critical point ( or collapse ) , the wave function tends to be more  </S>",
    "<S> spherical \" , confirming earlier conclusion made with a gaussian variational approximation  @xcite . in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3 , we show the corresponding results , for the three components of the mean - square - radius , @xmath119 @xmath120 . as shown , when @xmath121 , we have @xmath122 @xmath123 ; and , when @xmath124 such ratio is drastically reduced .    in summary , we have calculated systematically the critical number of particles , in systems that have negative two - body interactions , for traps with arbitrary geometries . the maximum critical number of particles @xmath2 can be derived from the given value of the parameter @xmath15 , given in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ k ] ) , once one has the scattering length , the mass of the atomic system , and the frequencies of the trap . </S>",
    "<S> the results are shown in figs . 1 and 2 . </S>",
    "<S> the value of @xmath15 , for any symmetry non explicitly given , can be easily derived from fig . 1 , by interpolation . </S>",
    "<S> it is also pointed out that the results shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2 , in the 1d cigar - like case , can be extended for slightly deformed cylindrical symmetries , by replacing the @xmath45axis label @xmath103 by @xmath125 .    </S>",
    "<S> our main results in the present work are : ( i ) the maximum number of particles , @xmath2 , for arbitrary 3d trap geometries is given through the results shown in fig.1 . </S>",
    "<S> ( ii ) the optimal trap configuration , to avoid the collapse with maximum @xmath2 , is found to be strongly dependent on the constraints of the frequencies of the trap . </S>",
    "<S> if we initially fix one of the frequencies , the best configuration of the trap is pancake - like , with the other two frequencies going to zero . </S>",
    "<S> analogously , if we initially fix two equal frequencies , the best configuration of the trap is cigar - like , with the third frequency close to zero . </S>",
    "<S> if we initially fix two different frequencies and try to vary the third frequency between the fixed ones , the best configuration is again pancake - like . we show that @xmath2 is much more sensitive to deformations of the trap in a cigar - like geometry than in a pancake - like geometry . finally , for small deformations @xmath51 of the cigar - like traps , where @xmath100 , releasing the longitudinal direction , the solitonic solutions , obtained in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite will be rescaled by the deformation . </S>",
