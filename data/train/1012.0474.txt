    "the standard cold dark matter ( scdm ) model @xcite was in good health until around the last decade of the previous century when it became apparent that the fractional density of matter falls well below the einstein - de sitter value , @xmath0 -see e.g. @xcite .",
    "the death blow came at the close of the century with the discovery of the current cosmic acceleration @xcite , something the said model can not accommodate by any means .",
    "however , to account for the acceleration in homogeneous and isotropic models one must either introduce some exotic energy component with a huge negative pressure ( dubbed dark energy ) or , more drastically , devise some theory of gravity more general than einstein relativity @xcite .",
    "thus , both solutions appear somewhat forced and not very aesthetical . here",
    "we argue that dark energy ( or something equivalent ) is demanded on thermodynamic grounds .",
    "in other words , we provide what we believe is a sound thermodynamic motivation for the existence of dark energy .",
    "our argument is based on that the natural tendency of systems to evolve toward thermodynamical equilibrium is characterized by two properties of its entropy function , @xmath1 , namely , it never decreases , @xmath2 , and is convex , @xmath3 @xcite . in the context of an ever expanding friedmann - roberson - walker ( frw ) cosmology",
    "this translates in that the entropy of the apparent horizon plus that of matter and fields enclosed by it must fulfill @xmath4 at any @xmath5 -the generalized second law ( gsl)- as well as @xmath6 as @xmath7 , where @xmath5 is the scale factor of the frw metric and the prime means @xmath8 .",
    "the apparent horizon in frw universes always exists ( which is not generally true for the particle horizon and the future event horizon ) and is known to posses not only an entropy proportional to its area @xcite but also a temperature @xcite . besides",
    ", it appears to be the appropriate thermodynamic boundary @xcite .",
    "before we proceed , it is fair to recall the ( at least theoretical ) existence of systems lacking any global maximum entropy state , such as antonov s sphere @xcite .",
    "the latter system consists in a sphere enclosing a number of particles that share some total energy .",
    "if the sphere radius happens to increase beyond some critical value , the system becomes unstable and the entropy function ceases to have a global maximum .",
    "we shall apply our argument under the assumption that the universe tends to a state of maximum entropy irrespective of whether it may eventually reach it or not .",
    "it would be odd and frustrating that such a universal principle as the second law of thermodynamics could not be applied to the universe as a whole , especially given the close connection between thermodynamics and gravity @xcite .",
    "section ii illustrates why dark energy ( or some or other modified gravity model ) is required on thermodynamic basis and study some dark energy models to see whether they fulfill the thermodynamic criteria .",
    "section iii applies the said criteria to some representative modified gravity models .",
    "finally , section iv summarizes and discusses our findings .",
    "as is customary , a naught subscript stands for the present value of the corresponding quantity .",
    "let us consider a frw universe .",
    "its entropy is contributed by two terms : the entropy of the apparent horizon which is proportional to its area , @xmath9 , and the entropy of the fluids enclosed by the horizon . here",
    "@xmath10 denotes the radius of the horizon and @xmath11 the hubble factor of the frw metric @xcite . as is well - known , @xmath12 where @xmath13 and @xmath14 stand for planck s length and boltzmann s constant , respectively .    in virtue of the first friedmann equation @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the total energy density",
    ", we can write @xmath17 as well as @xmath18 where we have used the conservation equation @xmath19 , where @xmath20 denotes the overall equation of state parameter , i.e. , not just of dark energy .",
    "from ( [ primea1 ] ) the area will augment in expanding universes if @xmath21 and decrease otherwise .    a further derivation with @xmath22 constant yields @xmath23 accordingly , @xmath24 for @xmath25 , and @xmath26 otherwise .",
    "thus , the above criterion disfavor the dominance of fluids at late times such that the overall equation of state is either of phantom type or larger than @xmath27 .",
    "we note in passing that when @xmath28 constant last equation generalizes to @xmath29\\ , .",
    "\\label{2primeawvar}\\ ] ]    let us consider the entropy associated to the fluid enclosed by the apparent horizon . if the fluid is just dust ( pressureless matter , subscript @xmath30 ) , i.e. @xmath31 and @xmath32 , the unphysical result that the temperature vanishes follows whence euler s equation , @xmath33 , can not be used to determine the entropy of cold matter ( i.e. , dust ) .",
    "we proceed instead as follows .",
    "every dust particle contributes a given bit -say @xmath14- to the fluid entropy .",
    "so , within the apparent horizon we will have @xmath34 being @xmath35 the number of particles there , and @xmath36 the ( conserved ) number density of dust particles .",
    "then , @xmath37 hence @xmath38 we note parenthetically that the entropy augments in the volume enclosed by the horizon because the latter encompasses more and more particles as the universe expands ( i.e. , as @xmath11 diminishes ) .",
    "thus , @xmath39 .",
    "we may now readily understand why sooner or later the universe should accelerate , i.e. , why it must be endowed with dark energy ( subscript @xmath40 , equation of state @xmath41 ) , or something dynamically equivalent at the background level ( as a suitably modified gravity ) .",
    "we note parenthetically that , at late times , dark energy is to dominate over all other energy components whereby @xmath42 as @xmath43 . were the universe dominated by radiation and/or matter for ever , @xmath44 could never become negative . and",
    "if the horizon entropy dominated the total entropy , then the universe would never tend to a state of maximum entropy ( compatible with the constraints of the system ) .",

    "it is readily seen that for @xmath50 ( solid and dashed lines ) the curvature evolves from positive to negative values and stays negative forever .",
    "by contrast , when the dark energy component is phantom , @xmath51 ( dot - dashed line ) the curvature goes from positive to positive values with an intermediate , transient , phase of negative values about the maximum . clearly , while in the two first instances the universe tends to thermodynamic equilibrium at late times in the case of phantom it does not .",

    "however , before proceeding we wish to remark that if the energy component is a scalar field in a pure quantum state , or the cosmological constant , it will have no entropy at all .",
    "nevertheless , we wish to consider the possibility of the scalar field being in a mixture state and accordingly entitled to have entropy ( obviously , this excludes the case @xmath76 ) .    for simplicity we will take @xmath77 and a single fluid component with @xmath78 constant .",
    "the entropy of the fluid filling the volume enclosed by the apparent horizon can be estimated by virtue of gibbs equation , @xmath79 with help of ( [ eq : friedmann1 ] ) and noting that @xmath80 @xmath81 using the second friedmann equation , @xmath82 and eq .",

    "one may object that if our reasoning were valid , the universe would have never ceased to inflate as it would mean a transition from acceleration , @xmath252 , to deceleration @xmath253 . clearly if the primordial inflation would have lasted for ever , big bang nucleo - synthesis",
    "would never have occurred , galaxies could nt have come into existence , and so on -something in stark contrast with observation . however , this reasoning is rather incomplete as it leaves aside the huge entropy generated during the reheating process at the end of inflation . in this explosive and quasi - instantaneous event",
    "the inflaton field relinquishes all its energy in the form of matter and radiation and , as a consequence , the universe sees its temperature enormously increased @xcite .",
    "since this huge amount of matter and radiation thermalizes ( a necessary condition for primordial nucleosynthesis ) both second derivatives , @xmath188 and @xmath254 , are negative and , as a result , we may well have that @xmath255 .",
    "obviously , this will depend on the specific inflationary model and the particular reheating process involved , but we are not aware of any general argument against the fulfillment of this inequality .",
    "specific calculations in this connection will be the subject of a future research .",
    "interestingly enough , cosmological models complying both with the gsl and the thermodynamic criterion that , at late times , the universe should approach thermodynamic equilibrium appear to be compatible with observational data .",
    "nevertheless , some models that do not comply with the said criteria ( as some phantom models and some modified gravity models ) seem also consistent with the said data .    our argument could be falsified if it were discovered that in the past ( but after the radiation - dominated period set in ) the universe experienced one ( or more ) transitions from deceleration to acceleration and back .",
    "cosmologies of the type have been proposed to explain the seemingly periodic distribution of galaxies with redshift -see , e.g. @xcite , @xcite- and as an expedient to solve the cosmic coincidence problem @xcite .",
    "however , recent studies on the impact of hypothetical transient periods of acceleration - deceleration on the matter growth @xcite and on the radiation power spectrum @xcite from the decoupling era , @xmath256 , to @xmath257 practically discard these periods in the redshift intervals considered .",
    "if eventually it gets confirmed that the present phase of acceleration is to last forever , it may be seen as an indication that the universe as a whole obeys the laws of thermodynamics ( with the reservation that not all models that accelerate at late times comply with them ) .",
    "if , on the contrary , the universe resumed a decelerated stage one should either call into question the validity of applying the said laws in a cosmological setting or wait for a later , and definitive , accelerating era .",
    "altogether , it is for the reader to decide which possibility looks the less queer : dark energy ( or modified gravity ) or a universe that will never approach thermodynamic equilibrium .",
    "the remaining possibility , either dark energy or modified gravity combined with an increasing departure from equilibrium , involves two oddities rather than one .    99 p.j.e .",
