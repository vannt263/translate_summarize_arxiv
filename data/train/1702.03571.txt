    "in 1994 , we initiated an extensive long term search for extrasolar planets around nearby f , g , k , and m dwarf stars using the keck observatory hires spectrometer on the keck i telescope atop mauna kea . over the years",
    ", the hires program has registered some notable successes , including the co - discovery of hd 209458b , the first transiting extrasolar planet @xcite , the first discovery of a neptune - mass planet outside the solar system @xcite , the first direct mass measurement ( without @xmath2 ambiguity ) of gliese 876d , the first super - earth @xcite , and many others .",
    "the first decade of the survey s productivity was memorialized in 2008 , with a then - complete compendium of the orbital characteristics of nearby exoplanets @xcite .",
    "now , as the survey moves into its third decade , we are electing to publish a catalog of all of the precision doppler velocity measurements that we have obtained at keck , with the hope that this data will be of value to the exoplanet community .    to date",
    ", this keck - based precision radial velocity survey of the lick - carnegie exoplanet survey team ( lces ) has amassed 60,949 precision radial velocities on a target list of 1,624 stars .",
    "figure 1 shows an h - r diagram of hipparcos stars within 100 pc ( purple points ) , and hires / keck target stars ( red points ) . with the exception of a few transiting or other planet signal cases discovered elsewhere",
    ", we have been targeting primarily nearby f , g , k , and m main sequence stars which have been heavily pre - selected for low activity ( expected stellar jitter ) based on @xmath3  chromospheric emission indices determined from emission reversals in the fraunhofer h and k lines of ca ii .",
    "we use the iodine cell technique pioneered by @xcite . all",
    "velocities reported herein were obtained with the hires spectrometer @xcite at the keck observatory .",
    "radial velocities were measured using an iodine gaseous absorption cell as a precision velocity reference , placed just ahead of the spectrometer slit in the converging beam from the telescope as described in detail by @xcite .",
    "the iodine gas in this absorption cell superimposes a rich forest of iodine lines on the stellar spectrum , providing a wavelength calibration and wavelength dependent proxy for the point spread function ( psf ) of the spectrometer .",
    "the iodine cell is sealed and temperature - controlled to 50.0 @xmath40.1@xmath5 c , so that the column density of iodine remains constant over decades .    for this survey ,",
    "the hires spectrometer was configured to operate at a nominal spectral resolving power of @xmath6 and wavelength range of 37008000  , however only the region from 50006200  ( with iodine lines ) was used in the doppler analysis .",
    "doppler shifts from the spectra are determined with the spectral synthesis technique described by @xcite . for this velocity analysis ,",
    "the iodine region of the echelle spectrum was subdivided into @xmath7700 wavelength chunks of 2  each .",
    "each chunk provided an independent measure of the wavelength , psf , and doppler shift .",
    "the final measured velocity is the weighted mean of the velocities of the individual chunks .",
    "the final uncertainty on each velocity is the standard deviation of all 700 chunk velocities about that mean .",
    "also derived are two chromospheric activity indices .",
    "the first is the well - known s - index , obtained from measurement of the emission reversal at the cores of the fraunhofer h and k lines of ca ii at 3968  and 3934  respectively .",
    "the second activity index , herein called the h - index , is a measure of the chromospheric emission component at the h@xmath8 balmer line of hydrogen at 6563  @xcite .",
    "hires was neither originally intended , nor specifically optimized for , extreme precision radial velocity work .",
    "rather , it was optimized as a general - purpose instrument , to provide moderately high resolution ( 50,000 - 70,000 ) echelle - style spectra with good sky background subtraction on faint targets ( v@xmath9 ) such as quasars . in the latter stages of hires",
    "assembly and test , however , we added an iodine gaseous absorption cell to facilitate precision radial velocity work .",
    "we drew on a combination of hires commissioning time and early allocations of uc - keck nights to develop a precision velocity data reduction pipeline , in anticipation that hires could be employed to facilitate exoplanet discovery .",
    "when nasa secured a 1/6 share of keck and issued calls for proposals to find exoplanets , we were able to garner enough nights on the heavily - shared keck facility to mount a significant exoplanet discovery program at keck , combining all of our uc - keck nights with those from the nasa - keck tac . while this program was remarkably successful from 1995 - 2004 , the original tektronix / site 2k x 2k 2048 ccd was actually an engineering - grade backup device from the lris instrument , and it limited the radial velocity precision achievable with hires .",
    "chief among its drawbacks were comparatively large ( 24-micron ) pixels , a non - flat ( convex ) focal plane , and a relatively poor and non - linear charge transfer efficiency ( cte ) .        in august-2004 , with partial nasa funding",
    ", we performed a major upgrade to hires .",
    "the tektronix / site ccd was replaced with a 3-chip mosaic of mit - lincoln lab 2k x 4k ccd s .",
    "these mit / ll devices feature higher quantum efficiency ( qe ) , smaller ( 15-micron ) pixels , higher and more linear cte , and a flat imaging surface . at the same time",
    ", we remade the final optical element of the hires super - camera @xcite to take full advantage of the now - flattened imager surface .",
    "figure 2 shows a view of the focal plane upgrade ( with its internal scattered light baffle removed to better show the ccds ) that we installed in august 2004 .",
    "the bottom , middle , and top ccd s were optimized respectively for highest qe in the uv , visible , and near - ir .",
    "the upgrade was done such that all iodine lines fall onto the middle ccd of the 3-chip mosaic , simplifying data reduction .",
    "also visible in figure 2 is the new fused silica lens that serves as the dewar window , and flattens the focal plane to match the flat ccd mosaic .",
    "the result of the upgrade was a marked improvement in limiting velocity precision , from @xmath7 4 - 5 m  s@xmath10  to 1 - 2 m  s@xmath10 .",
    "we refer hereafter to velocities obtained prior to august 2004 as  pre - fix \" velocities , and velocities obtained after august 2004 as  post - fix \" velocities .",
    "we find no significant velocity offset in our data reduction pipeline between pre - fix and post - fix velocities , and thus do not invoke any velocity offset parameter between pre- and post - fix data in our analyses .",
    "typical exposure times for target stars varied from a few minutes each , to a maximum of 10 minutes . in general ,",
    "exposure times were made long enough to provide some averaging over low - degree stellar p - modes , which exhibit typical time scales of @xmath11 minutes on g dwarfs @xcite . in cases where exposure times were shorter than 5 minutes",
    ", multiple sequential exposures were averaged to smooth over the p - modes .",
    "except for special cases involving high cadence issues , in general , each target was observed only once per night .",
    "maximum exposure times were capped at 10 minutes to avoid introducing additional error sources from increased incidence of cosmic rays , and from increased uncertainty in the determination of the photon - weighted mid - point of the exposure ( which determines the barycentric correction ) .",
    "each minute of error in the exposure midpoint produces a 2 m  s@xmath10  error in the barycentric correction .",
    "this correction depends on hour angle and declination as well . to optimize exoplanet detection",
    ", one must determine the true time centroid of an observation to a level of @xmath12 seconds to render barycentric correction error insignificant relative to an overall error budget totaling of order 1 m  s@xmath10  .",
    "in 1997 , to aid the exposure centroiding , we commissioned an exposure meter for hires that uses a propeller mirror to pick off a small fraction ( @xmath13 ) of starlight that has passed through the spectrometer slit and samples that light at a 1  hz rate . upon completion of the exposure , a photon - weighted midpoint for the exposure",
    "is calculated and used as the time mark for the barycentric correction @xcite .",
    "the exposure meter also is routinely used to terminate the exposure at any desired s / n level .",
    "figure 3 shows a histogram of the apparent v magnitudes of the stars in our target list .",
    "we generally avoided observing stars brighter than v @xmath11 at keck as these were easily done with the hamilton spectrometer @xcite on the lick shane 3-m . and ,",
    "to ensure at least some coverage of all targets on our large target list , we kept our individual exposures under 10 minutes maximum , which led to a faint magnitude limit of about v=14 .",
    "the median apparent magnitude of the survey s target list is v = 8.0 . when we reported velocity measurements in support of planet detections , we averaged the data over 2-hour bins .",
    "for the data presented in this paper , however , we present all velocities as unbinned .",
    "figure 4 shows a histogram of the ( b - v ) colors of the stars in our target list .",
    "our target list mk spectral types run from about f5v to m6v .",
    "we opted to largely forego surveying earlier than mid - f spectral types , due to decreasing stellar line density and increasing propensity for delta scuti type variations @xcite .",
    "such oscillations cause low - level quasi - periodic rv variations that can mimic keplerian signals .",
    "our latest spectral types are around m5.5v - m6v at the faint end limit .",
    "figure 5 shows histograms of the internal uncertainties ( pink ) of all the radial velocities and the expected stellar jitter ( blue ) for all program stars .",
    "each reported radial velocity is the average of the individual velocities extracted from @xmath14 spectral chunks across the iodine region of the echelle spectral format .",
    "the internal uncertainty for each velocity is simply the standard deviation of those velocities about that average .",
    "as such , it does not include any other unknown systematic errors that may be present in the reduction pipeline . the external error associated with any velocity",
    "will generally be larger . to maximize chances of exoplanet detection , we used knowledge of the chromospheric activity s - value to limit the survey primarily to the intrinsically quietest stars at any spectral type . in general , as can be seen from figure 5 , we limited our survey to stars with expected stellar jitter below about 5 m  s@xmath10 .",
    "our standard metric of chromospheric activity in target stars is the mt .",
    "wilson  s - value \" .",
    "the s - value quantifies the ratio of flux from 1   bins located at the centers of the ca ii fraunhofer h & k lines , as compared to two broader bandpasses lying 250  to either side of these lines @xcite .",
    "we computed this ratio for every spectrum taken of each of the stars in the hires data sample using the procedure described in @xcite .",
    "the results are then calibrated to standard mt .",
    "wilson s - values using those stars that overlap between our sample and the original mt .  wilson survey .",
    "we then used the ( b - v ) color of each star along with the median of its calibrated s - values to calculate its expected jitter ( blue histogram in figure 5 ) following the steps outlined in @xcite .",
    "the median expected stellar jitter of our sample is 2.13 m  s@xmath10 , while the median of our internal uncertainties is somewhat smaller at 1.56 m  s@xmath10  and thus well - matched to the expected stellar jitter levels from the sample .",
    "figure 6 shows a histogram of distances ( from hipparcos parallaxes ) of the program stars out to 150 pc .",
    "the survey is heavily biased toward the nearest stars , especially the nearest k and m dwarfs .",
    "the median distance of our program stars is 36 parsecs .",
    "figure 7 shows a cumulative distribution of observation time baselines for all program stars .",
    "80% of all target stars were observed over a time baseline of at least 1000 days , while 50% were observed for at least 3000 days .",
    "the longest time baselines for stars is 6300 days or about 17 years .",
    "figure 8 shows a histogram of the spectral resolution obtained for all survey spectra .",
    "as mentioned above , hires was designed primarily for moderately - high spectral resolution on very faint objects , and thus is not ideally suited to extreme precision radial velocities . as shown by @xcite , the radial velocity information content or ",
    "quality factor \" , @xmath15 of a stellar spectrum depends on spectral resolution . for resolutions lower than @xmath16 ,",
    "most of the lines are blended and @xmath15 scales roughly linearly with @xmath17 . for resolutions , @xmath18 ,",
    "the lines become better resolved and dependence on r flattens out with the slope of the relation linearly decreasing as 1/r .",
    "hires has a _ throughput _ ( a figure of merit for grating spectrometers defined as the product of spectral resolution times slit width in arc - seconds ) of about 39,000 arc - seconds .",
    "this value is geometrically fixed by the blaze angle of the echelle , the collimated beam diameter , and the telescope s primary mirror diameter . at that _ throughput _ , the 0.861 arc - second nominal slit guarantees that the resolution is never less than 45,300 ( no matter how over - filled the slit becomes from poor seeing ) .",
    "however , if the seeing is better than 0.861 arc - seconds , the spectral resolution for any exposure will be higher , especially if the guiding is stable and the exposure is short .    unlike fiber - fed approaches such as that pioneered by harps @xcite , where the seeing disk overfills the fiber aperture , and the fiber itself provides a high degree of image scrambling , thus assuring a stable width point spread function input to the spectrometer , hires uses a simple long slit , without any scrambling .",
    "the advantage of the long slit is less light lost at the slit , since the slit is typically much longer than the seeing disk s full - width at half - maximum ( fwhm ) , and thus light lost at the long slit scales only as slit width , rather than as the square of the diameter of the fiber for the fiber - fed case .",
    "however , the lack of image scrambling and its attendant point spread function ( psf ) stabilization requires that the psf be solved for explicitly as part of the rv reductions .",
    "the iodine cell s thousands of unresolved absorption lines serve as the proxy for the psf , allowing variations of the psf from one observation to the next to be adequately modeled and removed from the analysis so as not to contribute systematic errors in velocity .    at the same time , with hires , the fwhm of the seeing at keck is often less than the width of our standard 0.861 arc - second slit , in which case the spectral resolution becomes a function of the seeing . for cases of very bad seeing",
    ", when the seeing disk mostly overfills the slit , resolution could , in principle , degrade to the value 39,000/0.861 set by the _ throughput _ , or to about 45,000 .",
    "in practice , we rarely see resolutions less than @xmath19 .",
    "when the seeing is extremely good , and the exposure is short , resolutions as high as @xmath20 can be achieved , corresponding to an implied seeing fwhm of about 0.46 arc - seconds .",
    "the mean resolution across the 60,949 velocities of the survey is @xmath760,000 as shown in figure 8 , and implies a mean seeing at keck of about 0.65 arc - seconds over the @xmath720-year survey .",
    "figure 9 shows a time history of the spectral resolutions in this survey .",
    "the survey started out using decker b1 which has a width of 0.57 arc - seconds .",
    "on jd 2451983 ( march 14 , 2001 ) we mostly transitioned to using either deckers b5 or c1 , both of which have widths of 0.86 arc - seconds .",
    "as a consequence , the secondary peak near resolutions of about 72,000 in the histogram of figure 8 arises from these @xmath7 7000 observations taken before 2001 with the narrower slit .",
    "one additional consequence of not using an image scrambling fiber , and having a slit that is typically under - filled by the seeing disk , is that the achieved spectral resolution is also a function of air mass .",
    "increasing air mass generally causes an increase in the seeing disk fwhm , and also an increase in exposure times , resulting in more motion of the seeing disk on the slit during the exposure .",
    "figure 10 shows the dependence of achieved spectral resolution vs. elevation of the star at time of observation . for elevations above @xmath21 ,",
    "the resolution typically ranges from 49,000 to 75,000 depending on the seeing quality .",
    "below elevations of @xmath21 , the typical resolution degrades steadily with decreasing elevation ( increasing air mass ) .",
    "0.1 in    spectral resolution also affects the mean internal uncertainty , which represents the limiting precision of any single observation .",
    "this is shown in figure 11 , which plots the mean internal uncertainty of each velocity vs. the resolution of the spectrum from which the velocity was extracted . at our median resolution of about 58,000 ,",
    "the internal uncertainties are typically 0.8 m  s@xmath10@xmath22 m  s@xmath10  ( dependent also on stellar spectral type and stellar @xmath23 ) .",
    "but for resolutions above 75,000 , a large fraction of the median internal uncertainties are in the 1 - 2 m  s@xmath10  range .",
    "extrapolating that distribution to the r = 115,000 typical of harps and its variants implies that per observation median internal uncertainties of about 1 m  s@xmath10  could be achieved with hires if its resolution could be increased .",
    "this can be done straightforwardly by simply narrowing the slit , albeit at the expense of substantial light loss .",
    "[ b ! ]   0.2 in    when comparing the effectiveness of hires for precision radial velocity work against facilities such as harps ( that were explicitly optimized for such work at a resolution of 115,000 ) , hires is at a distinct disadvantage by at least a factor of two because of its factor of approximately two lower spectral resolution .",
    "harps is optimized for a much smaller 3.6-m telescope , and , even so , suffers the loss of typically 50% of the light at its 1 arc - second diameter fiber in nominal seeing .",
    "mounting a similar - sized harps - like instrument on a telescope as large as the keck 10-m would mean even more serious light loss at the entrance aperture .",
    "options for improving the _ throughput _ of hires are to invoke adaptive optics ( ao ) , and/or to use an image - slicer .",
    "doing adequate ao in the visible remains technically beyond the immediate near term for hires at keck . but adding an image slicer to hires to boost its spectral resolution without losing additional light at the slit should be feasible .",
    "work at hires to improve the spectral resolution for precision radial velocity acquisition has been reported by @xcite . these authors equipped hires first with an image - sliced fiber scrambler feed @xcite , and later with a fiber double - scrambler @xcite . in the second of the two articles ,",
    "spronck et al .",
    "report values for their single measurement precision ( smp- equivalent to our internal uncertainty ) obtained with the conventional slit - fed hires of 1.96 and 2.11 m  s@xmath10  for slit - fed observations of two test stars with hires .",
    "their smp on these two stars then improved to 1.49 m  s@xmath10  for both stars when hires was used with their dual fiber scrambler / slicer .",
    "our survey s median smp , ( figure 5 ) obtained from @xmath761,000 observations , is 1.56 m  s@xmath10 , with 50% of our velocities attaining significantly higher precisions of 0.5 - 1.0 m  s@xmath10 . from these results",
    "we infer that @xcite may retain a significant component of noise intrinsic to the data reduction pipeline and/or observing procedure , that is not yet mitigated by the higher spectral resolution and stabilization of the instrument line spread function enabled by the installed fiber scrambler / slicer .",
    "al s work demonstrates that gains can be obtained from image - slicing and psf - scrambling hires up to a harps - like resolution of 120,000 with a fiber scrambler / slicer , but sub - m  s@xmath10   measurement precision with this approach has yet to be demonstrated with hires .",
    "the usual proxy for monitoring stellar activity levels is the s - index and its corresponding derivative @xmath3 .",
    "the s - index is a measure of the emission at the cores of the fraunhofer h and k lines of singly - ionized calcium due to chromospheric activity .",
    "it is often useful in revealing the rotation period of the star , and any longterm activity cycles similar to the sun s 11-year activity cycle .",
    "chromospheric emission variations due to either or both stellar rotation and longterm activity cycles can produce radial velocity variations that can mimic , and therefore be mistaken for , keplerian motion of planets . any periodicity detectable in either broadband photometry or s - index that coincides with a planet candidate s period would cast serious suspicion on the latter s veracity . in some cases , the rotation period of the star can be detected solely from s - index data , even when broadband photometric variations reveal nothing .",
    "we include in this paper , for the first time in such a large collection of hires spectra , an additional measure of the stellar chromospheric activity ( hereafter called the h - index ) as measured from the h@xmath8 balmer line of hydrogen at 6563 .",
    "the motivation to use an additional activity index , besides the s - index , comes from the low flux of m dwarf stars in the ca h&k wavelength region ; these stars are intrinsically brighter at redder wavelengths .",
    "several other authors have also explored how h@xmath8 flux variations compare to other stellar activity indices , stellar properties , and radial velocity measurements , e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "we can build on their work with a much larger sample that is both uniform ( all from hires ) and spanning a wide spectral type range ( late f to early m ) .",
    "since this index is new to hires data , a brief description of its calculation and use is given here .",
    "a more detailed discussion of the hires h - index data is in preparation ( teske et al .",
    "2016 , in preparation ) .",
    "similar to the s - index , the h - index quantifies the amount of flux within the h@xmath8 line core compared to the local continuum .",
    "we use the @xcite prescription , which defines the h - index as the ratio of the flux within @xmath40.8    of the h@xmath8 line at 6562.808    to the combined flux of two broader flanking wavelength regions : 6550.87@xmath45.375   and 6580.31@xmath44.375  .",
    "we derive a wavelength solution specifically for the hires h@xmath8 echelle order from th - ar lamps ( rather than using the extrapolated wavelength solution from the iodine region of the spectrum ) and divide out a simple third - order polynomial fit to the continuum ( excluding the h@xmath8 line wings ) .",
    "the wavelength solution is refined in each individual spectrum with cross - correlation against the nso solar atlas , rebinned to the resolution of the object spectrum .",
    "this is necessary , as we do not a priori have the intrinsic stellar velocity measured for each spectrum . in a small subset of spectra ,",
    "this solar atlas cross - correlation does not work properly because the h@xmath8 line is in emission , or because the signal - to - noise of the spectrum is too low ( making the h@xmath8 absorption feature relatively weak ) .",
    "in these cases , the object spectrum does not match well to the deep h@xmath8 absorption feature in the solar spectrum , and this leads to an incorrect wavelength solution .",
    "after the cross - correlation step , a second continuum normalization is carried out by dividing the object spectrum by the solar atlas , smoothing this fit , and then multiplying the object spectrum by this smoothed fit .",
    "any wavelength mismatches between the object and solar atlas then create waves in the continuum .",
    "these issues cause anomalously large h - index values ; examination by eye of individual spectra suggests a cut - off of `` good '' versus `` bad '' h - index values between 0.062 and 0.064 .",
    "thus we advise caution when using or drawing any conclusions from h - index values above 0.062 ; this affects only @xmath71% of the stars presented here , most of which are late type .",
    "in addition , the h - index is presented only for post - fix hires spectra ( that were collected after the detector upgrade in august , 2004 ) , and only when the h@xmath8 region of the raw spectrum is not saturated ( @xmath24 52,860 counts , determined empirically ) .",
    "we show in figure 12 our median h - index and s - index measurements for each star , compared to its ( b - v ) and ( v - k ) colors .",
    "this is slightly different than the @xcite and @xcite results in that we see a clear , though not linear , relationship between h - index and color .",
    "we note , however , that these h - index values are not corrected for intrinsic stellar luminosity , so variability of the continuum flux with stellar mass , metallicity , or t@xmath25 may affect their interpretation @xcite .",
    "what is clear from figure 12 is that the h - index correlates much more tightly with stellar color ( and temperature ) than does the s - index .",
    "as most of our program stars were specifically chosen to be either main sequence or only slightly evolved sub - giants , this correlation also manifests as a strong correlation with absolute v - magnitude in figure 12 .    in figure 13",
    "we compare the s - index dispersion with the h - index dispersion . as expected , as the dispersion in the s - index for a given star increases , so does the dispersion in its h - index .",
    "the stars with the largest variation in both indices are late - type ( almost exclusively m dwarf ) stars .",
    "0.062 are to be treated with caution , as explained in section 4.,title=\"fig : \" ] 0.25 in    [ b ! ]",

    "is a complex task that involves , at the very least , accurate broadband photometry over long time scales .",

    "we show only a representative portion of the full table of signals .",
    "the complete version of table 2 is available through links in the on - line version of the paper .",
    "while many of theses signals are undoubtedly caused by planets in keplerian motion about the host star , issues of potential confusion with stellar rotation and/or jitter will require follow - up work with photometry . in multi - planet cases , detailed modeling of the dynamical stability of the system also need to be verified .",
    "no such attempt to do so has been made here .",
    "we performed the analyses of hires radial velocity data sets by using an automated markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) posterior sampling algorithm .",
    "this algorithm was constructed to both search for signals in the radial velocity time - series and to obtain estimates for keplerian and nuisance parameters of the statistical model ( see appendix a ) .",
    "we applied the adaptive metropolis ( am ) mcmc algorithm @xcite for parameter estimation and its generalized version , the delayed - rejection adaptive metropolis ( dram ) algorithm @xcite for searches of signals .",
    "the analyses proceeded as follows .",
    "first , we performed posterior samplings of a baseline model with @xmath26 ( where _ k _ is the number of signals in the model ) by applying the am algorithm to obtain parameter estimates .",
    "as in all parameter estimations with mcmc algorithms in the current work , after rejecting @xmath27 initial chain members ( considered to be the burn - in phase in which the chain identified the most probable regions in the parameter space ) we divided the remaining chain into three parts and tested non - convergence by applying the gelman - rubin statistics for all parameters @xcite . if the gelman - rubin statistic @xmath17 in eq .",
    "( 25 ) of @xcite was above 1.1 we rejected the chain because it showed evidence in favor of non - convergence and increased the chain length to obtain a more statistically representative sample .",
    "required chain lengths ranged from @xmath28 for @xmath26 to @xmath29 or more for @xmath30 .",
    "we then moved on recursively . assuming a detection of @xmath31 signals in the data and that the maximum _ a posteriori _ ( map ) estimates had been obtained with the am algorithm , we adopted a model with @xmath32 signals by setting the initial state of the chain such that all but the five keplerian parameters of the @xmath32th signal were set equal to their map estimates as obtained by using the model with only @xmath31 keplerian signals .",
    "the period parameter of the @xmath32th signal was set to a random value in the set @xmath33 $ ] , where we set @xmath341 day and @xmath35 is the baseline of the data set . the eccentricity ( @xmath36 ) , and amplitude ( @xmath37 )",
    "were set equal to zero . with this",
    "setting , our model accounted for the k detected signals and enabled the markov chains to sample the parameter space of the @xmath32th signal in a search for global maxima that could be interpreted as additional signals in the data .",
    "this is demonstrated in greater detail below by using the analyses of two data sets as examples ( sections [ sec : hd4208 ] and [ sec : hd150706 ] ) .",
    "the searches for signals were , however , difficult when there was a very significant keplerian signal in the data corresponding to e.g. a massive giant planet .",
    "in such cases , the markov chains identified the signal easily but all newly proposed values were rejected because they corresponded to considerably lower posterior values than the map estimate in the period space .",
    "this stopped the chain from visiting the whole period space , thereby preventing us from seeing whether there were even more significant maxima in other parts of the period space . in such cases , instead of using a likelihood function @xmath38 ,",
    "we instead used @xmath39 such that parameter @xmath40 was gradually decreased .",

    "we note that , although setting parameter @xmath40 to values below unity changes the likelihood function , the positions of the maxima remain unchanged enabling us to use such tempered samplings for the purpose of searching signals in the noisy radial velocity time - series .    if the sampling of the parameter space of the model with @xmath32 keplerian signals identified a probability maximum such that the ratio of the two maximum likelihood values @xmath42 indicated a significant increase with a 0.1% fap , corresponding to @xmath43 , we considered the signal to be significantly detected . in such a case",
    "we moved on to estimate the parameters of the model with @xmath32 signals .",
    "however , if such a maximum could not be found , we concluded that there is only evidence for @xmath31 signals in the data ( possibly @xmath26 ) .",
    "table 2 lists all signals in the keck data sets with likelihood ratio @xmath44 between models with @xmath31 and @xmath45 signals for which the ratio exceeds a value of 16.27 corresponding to a 0.1% fap threshold of a three - parameter model ( amplitude @xmath37 , period @xmath46 , and phase @xmath47 ) .",
    "if the likelihood ratio exceeds 20.52 ( corresponding to a 0.1% fap threshold for a full 5-parameter keplerian model ) the signal is labelled as `` candidate ''  otherwise it is called `` signal requiring confirmation '' ( src ) .",
    "some signals are interpreted as `` activity '' according to the criteria presented in the next subsection .",
    "we also analyzed the hires s - indices in order to assess whether the signals in the radial velocities could be interpreted instead as stellar activity .",
    "the s - indices were analyzed simply by calculating likelihood - ratio periodograms for a simple model containing a sinusoidal signal and a linear trend ( see appendix a ) .",
    "we ignored signals with periods below 2 days to avoid detecting daily and yearly aliases whose significance can occasionally exceed the significance of the true signal at longer periods .",

    "this value is a similar threshold to a 0.1% fap ( which we have chosen in keeping with the precedent established by @xcite but for five degrees of freedom ) , as is the case when comparing models with @xmath31 and @xmath32 keplerian signals .",
    "we thus interpreted signals exceeding the former threshold as _ signals requiring confirmation _",

    "4 .   the data set is not dominated by activity .",
    "although the first criterion is very clear in its meaning , the others are less so without additional details .",
    "the second criterion refers to the posterior samplings of the parameter space .",
    "any signal that has an amplitude that is not statistically significantly different from zero ( i.e. whose 99% credibility interval is limited from below by zero ) can not be considered a significant signal even if the first criterion above is satisfied .",
    "similarly , this is also the case when the exact period of the signal can not be determined reliably due to e.g. poor data sampling and a resulting ambiguity in the signal period .",
    "these criteria have been introduced in @xcite and applied in e.g. @xcite .    if a given signal with a period @xmath46 has a counterpart in the activity indicators ( s - index or h - index ) such that the period of the activity signal @xmath59 satisfies @xmath60 , we interpret the radial velocity signal as being likely connected to stellar activity ( rotation , magnetic cycle , etc . ) .",

    "the eccentricity prior can be considered a regularization function , also known as tikhonov - regularization @xcite and its application is thus justified even in the frequentist context .",
