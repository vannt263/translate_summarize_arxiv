    "axions could be produced in the sun via the so - called primakoff effect .",
    "the cern axion solar telescope ( cast ) experiment  ( zioutas _ et al . _",
    "@xcite ) uses a large hadron collider ( lhc ) prototype dipole magnet  ( bona _ et al . _",
    "@xcite ) providing a magnetic field of about 9 t which could reconvert these axions into photons when the magnetic field is transversal to the direction of axions propagation  ( sikivie  @xcite ) .",
    "the magnet aligns with the sun twice per day ( during sunset and sunrise ) for about 1.5 hours each side .",
    "the magnet is composed of two independent magnetic bores whose ends are covered by x - ray detectors ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : cast ] ) .",
    "three of the four apertures are actually covered by microbulk micromegas detectors .",
    "the cast research program is divided in two main phases ; phase i with vacuum inside the magnetic bore covering masses up to @xmath3ev  ( zioutas _ et al . _",
    "@xcite ) , and phase ii with a buffer gas inside to increase the sensitivity to higher axion masses ( @xmath4ev ) , being the magnetic bore gas density related to the enhanced axion mass  ( arik _ et al . _",
    "@xcite aune _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite ) . in order to achieve a competitive sensitivity on the axion - photon coupling ,",
    "long data taking periods are required , specially during the second phase in which the axion parameter space ( @xmath5 ) must be carefully swept in mass . once the magnet properties are fixed , the achievable sensitivity on the axion - photon coupling is strongly dependent on the low intrinsic background of the detectors and the effect of external background radiation .",
    "the first micromegas detectors produced for cast experiment were built by using a well established conventional fabrication process  ( giomataris  @xcite ) . in these detectors ,",
    "the micromesh , 3 @xmath6 m thick , is made of nickel using the electroforming technique .",
    "a grid of pillars made of insulating material were mounted on the strips surface composing a precise structure of about @xmath7 m thick where the micromesh is placed .    at the micromegas conventional technology the micromesh",
    "is placed over the strips readout by mechanical means , stretching it by using some screws that exert some pressure at the mesh boundaries .",
    "the new micromegas technologies , bulk  ( giomataris  @xcite ) and microbulk  ( papaevangelou  @xcite ; iguaz  @xcite ) , differ from the conventional technology in the fact that mesh and strips form a single entity , conferring robustness to the overall structure .",
    "some microscope pictures for bulk and microbulk detectors are shown in figure  [ fi : microscope ] .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     the first background measurements were carried out at the surface ( using the spare m13 detector from cast ) in the laboratory at the university of zaragoza , showing levels comparable to those obtained in the detectors operating in cast .",
    "several environmental parameters and electronics configurations were explored in search of correlation with background levels . only the configurations affecting the performance of the detector ( such as a reduced mesh electron transmission and/or a worse energy resolution ) showed a negative effect in the background level .",
    "once the set - up and the background levels at surface were characterized , the system was moved to one of the halls at the canfranc underground laboratory ( lsc ) .",
    "the lsc is situated under 2500 m.w.e .",
    "( meter water equivalent ) in the spanish pyrenees , where we know muons are reduced by a factor 10@xmath8  ( luzn @xcite ) .",
    "the effect of bringing the detector underground was observed at the trigger rate , before the offline x - ray selection is performed .",
    "the trigger rate was reduced to 0.2hz , by more than a factor 5 respect to surface .",
    "the direct comparison between the background measured at surface and at the lsc , at the same conditions , showed no significative difference ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : zgzvslsc ] ) .",
    "thus , proving the good discrimination capabilities of the detector which is clearly rejecting the majority of cosmic rays interacting at the surface set - up .",
    "afterwards , the m13 detector was replaced by the m10 detector which took data at the cast experiment in 2008 .",
    "the better performance of m10 in comparison with m13 could be appreciated by the lower background level achieved , emphasizing the importance of the detector performance on the discrimination capabilities .",
    "the background measured in the lsc could be compared directly with the data taken at the cast experiment in running conditions ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : zgzvslsc ] ) .",
    "the differences found between both spectra are coming from the differences in the shielding configurations ; while the underground set - up is a complete 4@xmath9-shielding , the shielding in cast limited by the pipe connection to the magnet , which produces a weakness in the protection against external radiation .",
    "in particular , the peaks observed at the cast background data can be attributed to the fluorescence peaks produced by external gammas in the materials surrounding the detector , mainly stainless steel ( cr , fe , ni at 5.4 , 6.4 and 7 kev ) and copper .",
    "these peaks are significantly reduced at the lsc by a more efficient gamma suppression at the inner region .",
    "after the characterization of the cast - like shielding , the shielding was increased by adding an additional wall of lead of 20 cm in all directions . by growing the shielding underground we are avoiding the negative effect that this kind of shielding could have at surface , due to the effect of secondaries which could be produced by interactions in the shielding itself .",
    "the upgrade was carried out in _ two _ steps , first covering bottom and lateral walls , and afterwards completing the shielding with the top wall ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : shielding_upgrades ] ) .    the two - steps shielding upgrade affected clearly at the background level achieved by the detector ( see fig .  [ fig : bkgprogression ] ) .",
    "once the shielding was completed a factor 6 reduction was obtained , and a level of about @xmath10kev@xmath1@xmath2s@xmath1 was reached .",
    "more impressive was the reduction observed at the trigger rate by a factor @xmath11 , indicating that the majority of the interactions in the chamber have an external origin .",
    "there were reasons to suspect that the background level achieved at this first stage was being limited by an internal contamination , due to the clear presence of a peak at the 5 - 6 kev region that could be produced by the @xmath12fe placed inside the cage , and that now was observable thanks to the lower background levels reached . in order to screen this contamination from the detector field of view ,",
    "an additional copper layer was placed on top of the detector window by using different configurations  ( toms  @xcite ) .",
    "the final result was the obtention of a more restrictive limit on the intrinsic background of the detector at a level of @xmath13kev@xmath1@xmath2s@xmath1 at the 2 - 7 kev energy range , value which was obtained after a total exposure time of 994 hours .",
    "we have presented the importance of low x - ray background detectors for rare event searches .",
    "the advances towards lower background detectors affects directly to the experiment involved increasing its sensitivity .",
    "we have shown that micromegas microbulk technology , with the proper shielding and conditions , can achieve even lower background levels than those that are actually providing data in the cast experiment , levels which have also shown considerable improvement during the different phases of the experiment ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : history ] ) .    moreover , a complete methodology and set - up to evaluate future low intrinsic radiation detectors has been well established .",
    "future work is in the course to produce new detectors with even lower radiative levels . this experimental search together with the understanding of the background nature and optimization of the shielding thanks to detailed geant4 simulations could provide the key to obtain even lower limits .",
