    "the collapse of the iron core via photo - disintegration of nuclei at the final evolutionary phase of a massive star results in the formation of a strong shock wave in the deep interior .",
    "the shock wave propagates in the envelope , finally reaches the surface , and outshines the emission from the progenitor .",
    "this phenomenon occurring at the beginning of a supernova explosion is called supernova shock breakout@xcite . a growing example of detections of the shock breakouts , e.g. , sn 2008d @xcite , snls-04d2dc @xcite , snls-06d1jd @xcite , promotes investigations into its property , detectability , and usage for cosmological studies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    among the example detections , the x - ray outburst xrf 080109",
    "was serendipitously detected during the follow - up observations of a previously discovered type ibc supernova , sn 2007uy @xcite .",
    "it was associated with another type ib / c supernova 2008d .",
    "the parent galaxy was a spiral galaxy ngc 2770 at the distance of 28 mpc .",
    "analyses of the observed x - ray spectrum and light curve have evoked a controversy on the origin of the emission .",
    "some authors attribute the origin of the x - ray emission to the emergence of a radiation - dominated shock wave from the envelope of the progenitor , i.e. , the supernova shock breakout .",
    "others consider that sn 2008d is a gamma - ray burst ( grb ) associated supernova and the x - ray emission is originated from the ejected matter moving at relativistic speeds .",
    "@xcite presented the x - ray light curve of xrf 080109 and results of the spectral analysis .",
    "the emission lasted for @xmath1 s and its peak luminosity was @xmath2 .",
    "the total energy of the outburst is @xmath3 .",
    "the x - ray spectrum is best fitted by a single power - law with the photon index of @xmath4 .",
    "assuming the presence of relativistic ejecta , they estimated the bulk lorentz factor at @xmath5 . because the scale length of the emission region , @xmath6 cm , is much larger than the expected radius of the progenitor star , @xmath7 cm , they excluded the possibility of the relativistic ejecta origin of x - ray photons . here",
    "@xmath8 denotes the speed of light .",
    "@xcite performed a spectral analysis of xrf 080109 and found that the x - ray spectrum is well fitted by a power law spectrum with the photon index of @xmath9 absorbed by matter with the total equivalent hydrogen column density of @xmath10 , leading to a conclusion that the shock breakout origin is unlikely because no black body component is found .",
    "@xcite also insisted on the relativistic ejecta origin because of little contribution from a black body component to the x - ray spectrum .",
    "however , @xcite claimed that the x - ray spectrum is well fitted by a black body combined with a power law spectrum with 50% bolometric contribution from the black body component .",
    "their best fit values for the photon index @xmath11 and the black body temperature @xmath12 are @xmath13 and @xmath14 kev , respectively .    while x - ray observations have not led to agreement on the origin of the x - ray emission , observations in other wavelength ranges support the shock breakout origin .",
    "@xcite have performed very - long - baseline interferometry ( vlbi ) observations at 30 and 133 days after the explosion .",
    "they succeeded in resolving the sizes of the source at both epochs and determined the @xmath15 upper limit to the expansion velocity to be @xmath16 , which rules out the presence of ultra - relativistic ejecta . from optical spectroscopic observations for sn 2008d in the nebular phase ,",
    "@xcite found a double - peaked [ ] line profile , which is strong evidence of an aspherical explosion .",
    "they argued that sn 2008d is a side - viewed bipolar explosion .",
    "if relativistic ejecta are responsible for the observed x - ray emission , x - ray photons will be emitted by synchrotron mechanism , which naturally explains the observed power - law ( or black body + power law ) x - ray spectrum .",
    "on the other hand , early investigations into the supernova shock breakout @xcite predicted thermal black body radiation for a uv / x - ray flash associated with the shock breakout .",
    "therefore , some additional processes producing non - thermal photons are required to explain the observed power - law spectrum in the framework of the shock breakout origin .",
    "the bulk comptonization is a process to produce non - thermal photons in the presence of a bulk flow of matter @xcite . a small fraction of photons are repeatedly scattered by electrons across the shock front and gradually increasing their energies .",
    "the first application of the process to the supernova shock breakout was done by @xcite , who calculated the propagation of photons around the front of a radiation - dominated shock by a monte - carlo method .",
    "however , the shock profiles assumed in their calculations might oversimplify the situation and effects of other radiative processes competing the electron scattering , e.g. , photoionization , radiative recombination , and free - free absorption , were not discussed .",
    "in addition , they did not construct a light curve from their model .",
    "hence we try to establish a more realistic model than @xcite by using an appropriate hydrodynamical model , the self - similar solution for the supernova shock breakout .",
    "the solution originally derived by @xcite describes the propagation of a shock wave in a planar atmosphere with equations of non - relativistic fluid dynamics .",
    "we treat the radiative transfer of thermal photons emitted by the shock front in the test - particle limit .",
    "then we construct not only spectra but also x - ray light curves from models with several different parameter sets .",
    "to derive the spectra , we neglect the contribution from photons inside the photosphere , which is defined as the position where the optical depth measured from the stellar surface becomes unity . using the results , we discuss the origin of the x - ray emission from xrf 080109 .",
    "this paper is structured as follows . in  2 , we describe formulation of the problem .",
    "the derivation of the self - similar solution for the shock breakout used in  2 is reviewed in appendix .",
    "an application of our model to xrf 080109/sn 2008d is presented in  3 . finally , ",
    "4 concludes this paper .",
    "in this section , we explain qualitative natures of the supernova shock breakout , describe details of our model , and formulate the problem .    the collapse of the iron core of a massive star results in the formation of a strong shock in the deep interior and the shock propagates toward the envelope .",
    "when propagating in the envelope , the shock is mediated by radiation . in the diffusion approximation ,",
    "the average velocity @xmath17 of photons diffusing in a medium with the optical depth @xmath18 is expressed by the speed of light divided by the optical depth , @xmath19 . here",
    "@xmath18 represents the optical depth from the outer edge of the envelope to the shock front . when the shock velocity @xmath20 is larger than the diffusion velocity , photons behind the shock front are trapped . on the other hand , when the shock velocity is smaller than the diffusion velocity , photons can overtake the shock front and observers can see these photons as a precursor of the shock front . therefore , when the relation @xmath21 is satisfied , namely , the optical depth decreases to the ratio of the speed of light to the shock velocity , @xmath22 , the shock breakout occurs .",
    "a semi - analytical description of time evolutions of hydrodynamical variables at the supernova shock breakout has been obtained by @xcite .",
    "the solution was extended to the ultrarelativistic case by @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the present authors extended the solution so that it can treat the energy deposition or loss at the shock front @xcite . in this work ,",
    "we use the self - similar solution discovered by @xcite to obtain velocity and density profiles behind the shock front . in the following subsections ,",
    "we review the approach of @xcite and describe the procedure to obtain the profiles .",
    "@xcite studied the propagation of a strong shock in a medium whose density profile @xmath23 can be written by a power of the distance @xmath24 measured from the outer edge of the envelope of the progenitor star , @xmath25 where @xmath26 and @xmath27 are constants characterizing the density structure of the envelope . because we are concerned with the radiative envelope of a massive star , we take @xmath28 as the fiducial value . the value of @xmath26 is treated later .",

    "the rankine - hugoniot relations for a strong shock determine the values of the velocity @xmath50 , the pressure @xmath51 , and the density @xmath52 immediately behind the shock front , @xmath53 the boundary condition at the shock front yields @xmath54 integrating eqs .",
    "( [ dfdx])-([dhdx ] ) from @xmath55 to @xmath56 for the eigen value of @xmath40 , we obtain the profiles of @xmath45 , @xmath46 , and @xmath47 .",
    "otherwise the solution could not reach @xmath57 .",
    "once we obtain the profiles , @xmath45 , @xmath46 , and @xmath47 , we can derive the time evolutions of hydrodynamical variables @xmath29 , @xmath30 , and @xmath31 by using the relations ( [ relation ] ) .",
    "to apply the solution to a specific problem , we need to fix the free parameters @xmath26 and @xmath39 introduced above .",
    "to fix them , we determine the position @xmath58 and velocity @xmath59 of the shock front at the shock breakout when the optical depth is equal to the ratio of the speed of light to the shock velocity .",
    "since we can calculate the optical depth @xmath18 by simply integrating the density profile ahead of the shock front , @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the mean molecular weight , @xmath62 the hydrogen mass , and @xmath63 is the thomson cross section , we obtain the value of @xmath26 for given @xmath58 and @xmath59 as , @xmath64 the parameter @xmath39 is obtained from the definition of the shock velocity ( [ vs ] ) , @xmath65 next , we define a value @xmath66 so that the optical depth @xmath18 becomes unity when the shock reaches the position @xmath67 . using eqs .",
    "( [ eq14 ] ) and ( [ eq15 ] ) , the position @xmath66 is expressed as @xmath68 which corresponds to the final velocity @xmath69 of the shock wave given by @xmath70 we stop the calculation for the photon propagation when @xmath71 .",
    "an example of the thus derived profiles of the velocity @xmath29 and density @xmath30 are shown in figure [ f1 ] .",

    "therefore , in the following calculations of the photon propagation around the shock front , we only use two profiles , the velocity and density profiles .",
    "the former is used to determine the bulk velocity of electrons scattering photons and the latter is used for the calculation of the optical depth . on the other hand ,",
    "the pressure profile indicates a roughly constant post - shock pressure @xmath77 .",
    "since the post - shock pressure is expected to be dominated by radiation pressure , @xmath78 , where @xmath79 is the radiation constant , we obtain the photon temperature of the order of @xmath80 kev , which is consistent with results of spectral analysis of xrf 080109 @xcite .",
    "then , we assume a uniform temperature profile with @xmath81 kev behind the shock .",
    "before we describe the procedure to deal with the photon propagation , we estimate relative contributions of some radiative processes important in the stellar envelope . for photoionization and radiative recombination",
    ", we estimate the time scale of each process for oxygen , which is one of the most abundant heavy elements .",
    "for radiative recombination , we compare the absorption coefficient with the scattering coefficient for compton scattering . in the following discussion",
    ", we assume the envelope of a compact star such as wolf - rayet stars because the velocity of the shock wave propagating in the envelope is expected to reach mildly relativistic speeds , which is required for the bulk comptonization to work well .",
    "first of all , we estimate the average electron number density @xmath82 of the envelope when the electron scattering is a dominant source of opacity .",
    "then , we suppose that the shock front is located at a distance @xmath83 from the outer edge of the envelope . using the average number density @xmath82",
    ", we can express the optical depth from the outer edge of the envelope to the shock front as @xmath84 . since the optical depth at the moment of the shock breakout",
    "is given by @xmath22 , the average electron number density of the envelope is estimated as , @xmath85 therefore , for a progenitor star with the radius @xmath86 , the number of electrons ahead of the shock front is estimated as @xmath87      next , we consider photoionization of heavy elements .",
    "x - ray photons emitted from the shock front ionize elements in the envelope .",
    "especially , heavy elements like oxygen and neon efficiently absorb the x - ray photons because the absorption edges of such elements are in the energy range of the x - ray photons .",
    "for example , the photoionization cross section of hydrogen - like oxygen ion for photons with energy @xmath88 is given by @xmath89 @xcite , where @xmath90 is the gaunt factor , @xmath91 is the fine structure constant , and @xmath92 is the bohr radius .",
    "the energy @xmath93 is the ionization potential for oxygen , @xmath94 therefore , for photons with the energy @xmath93 , the photoionization cross section is of the order of @xmath95 , which is much larger than the thomson cross section @xmath63 .",
    "namely , photoionization is a dominant opacity source until all the heavy elements become fully ionized .",
    "in fact , however , photoionization hardly deforms the x - ray spectrum because all the relevant elements become fully ionized immediately . to show this",
    ", we estimate the total emitted energy @xmath96 of non - thermal x - ray photons .",
    "assuming the photon temperature of @xmath97 kev and the emitting radius of @xmath98 cm , the luminosity @xmath99 of the thermal emission is obtained by the following formula , @xmath100 where @xmath101 is the stefan - boltzmann constant . since the time required for the shock wave to propagate across a shell with the width @xmath83 is given by @xmath102 , the total energy @xmath103 of the thermal emission is @xmath104 furthermore , introducing a parameter @xmath105 , we express the total emitted energy of non - thermal x - ray photons as @xmath106 .",
    "once the outburst energy @xmath96 is given , we can estimate the number of x - ray photons having the energy of a few kev and the number is of the order of @xmath107 photons , which is larger than the number of electrons estimated above ( [ nph ] ) when a substantial contribution of non - thermal photons , @xmath108 , is assumed . from the estimated value of the number of photons and the volume of the envelope , the number density yields @xmath109 using these values",
    ", we can evaluate the time scale for photoionization as @xmath110 which is much shorter than the time scale for the shock wave to propagate in the envelope .",
    "then , we estimate the time scale of radiative recombination for fully ionized oxygen . the time scale of radiative recombination for ions with the atomic number @xmath111 is expressed by @xmath112 the radiative recombination coefficient @xmath113 is given by @xmath114 @xcite . here",
    "the parameter @xmath115 is given by , @xmath116 using the above relations and the temperature of @xmath117 inferred from the spectral analysis of the x - ray spectrum @xcite , we obtain @xmath118 where @xmath119 is the number of oxygen atoms per nucleon . since the estimated time scale for radiative recombination is much longer than that of photoionization even for pure - o atmosphere ( @xmath120 ) , we can safely assume fully ionized matter in the envelope .",
    "@xcite provides results of the calculation of dielectric recombination rate coefficients for hydrogen - like ions .",
    "his results show that the dielectric recombination rate coefficient for the fully ionized oxygen is smaller than the radiative one for the temperature range of our interest .",
    "therefore , we can neglect the contribution of dielectric recombination .",
    "finally , we consider free - free absorption . the free - free absorption coefficient for ions with the charge @xmath111 is given by @xmath121 ( e.g. * ?",
    "* ) , where @xmath122 is the number densities of ions , @xmath123 is the frequency of the incident photon , and @xmath124 represents the gaunt factor . in the following ,",
    "we consider the contribution from oxygens .",
    "for the temperature derived by the spectral analysis of xrf 080109 , @xmath117 @xcite , the free - free absorption coefficient is estimated to be @xmath125 for @xmath126 , which is much smaller than the scattering coefficient for compton scattering , @xmath127 . here",
    "we have assumed that the gas is fully ionized and that the gaunt factor is unity . on the other hand , for the surface temperature of a massive star , @xmath128 k ,",
    "the free - free absorption coefficient for low energy photons is comparable to the scattering coefficient , @xmath129 for @xmath130 .",
    "however , since the effective optical thickness @xmath131 of the envelope , which is given by @xmath132 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is smaller than unity , @xmath133 , even for @xmath128 k and @xmath134 ev , most photons must escape from the envelope without being absorbed . as discussed in ",
    "[ photoionization ] , matter in front of the shock front is exposed by the x - ray photons and free electrons thereof must have higher temperatures .",
    "hence we may overestimate the effective optical thickness . for the progenitor stars of type ib or ic sne",
    ", the contribution from other elements , e.g. , helium and carbon , may be dominant .",
    "however , the difference of the composition of the envelope , does not alter the conclusion , @xmath135 .",
    "thus , we neglect effects of free - free absorption in the following calculations .      in this subsection , we describe our method for computing the generation and the propagation of photons in given velocity and density profiles .",
    "first of all , we generate seed photons having a black body spectrum with the photon temperature @xmath136 assumed to be @xmath137 .",

    "for seed photons , the angles @xmath140 and @xmath141 are determined so that the angular distribution of photons becomes isotropic . in our model ,",
    "the seed photons are assumed to be produced at the shock front at a constant rate .",
    "numerically , a fixed number of photons are injected at the shock front at every time step .    for the velocity and density profiles around the shock front",

    "the total number of seed photons is about @xmath152 .",
    "we calculate the path through which a photon propagates during a time interval @xmath153 using an optical depth @xmath154 defined as @xmath155 here we approximate the region around the photon as a uniform shell with the electron number density @xmath156 .",

    "the photon may be scattered by an electron within this time interval .",
    "the probability @xmath160 of this event is expressed by the optical depth as @xmath161 generating a random number @xmath162 ranging from zero to unity , it is determined whether the photon travels freely or is scattered by an electron .",
    "when the random number @xmath162 is larger than the probability @xmath160 , the photon travels freely . on the other hand ,",
    "when @xmath162 is smaller than @xmath160 , then the photon travels by a distance of @xmath163 before the scattering . in this case , we carry out the procedure for the scattering given in  [ scattering ] . after that",

    "* ) , we adopted this method and review the outline in this section .    at first ,",

    "we describe the procedure to derive light curves in this section .",
    "after we stop the calculation of the propagation of photons around the shock front , we evaluate the optical depth from the location of the photon to the surface @xmath183 .",

    "next , we calculate the propagation of the thus selected photons toward the surface according to the procedure described in  2.3 .",
    "then , for each photon , we obtain the angle @xmath185 between the direction of the propagation of the photon and the shock normal when the photon reaches the surface .",

    "we assume a spherical explosion . as a consequence ,",
    "the shock breakout occurs simultaneously and in the same way at every points on the surface of the progenitor star .",

    "the time @xmath35 is measured from the point when photons with @xmath186 are observed .",

    "taking the above two effects , i.e. , the optical depth and the light travel effect , into account , we derive light curves of x - ray photons emitted after supernova shock breakout .",

    "we performed calculation of models with @xmath207 and @xmath208 .",
    "the resultant energy spectra are shown in figure [ f6 ] .",
    "we found that these energy spectra also show power - law tails with the same index as the case for @xmath28 , which is a physically natural consequence .",
    "high energy photons comprising the power - law tail are produced by repeated crossing of the shock front @xcite .",
    "the probability that photons diffusing out from the shock front scattered back to the downstream is determined by the optical depth of the envelope , which is given by integrating the density profile , rather than the density profile itself .",
    "in addition , as long as the optical depth is larger than unity , most of photons must be scattered back to the downstream .",
    "slight differences of the density structure do not alter the bulk comptonization process .",
    "therefore , the results weakly depend on the parameter @xmath27 .    .",
    "each line represents the model with @xmath201 ( solid ) , @xmath202 ( dashed ) , @xmath73 ( dotted ) , and @xmath203 ( dash - dotted ) .",
    "the initial position of the shock is fixed ( @xmath72 cm ) .",
    "the radiative envelope of a massive star ( @xmath193 ) is assumed . ]      using the procedure described in  [ lc ] , we calculate light curves of x - ray photons produced at the shock front .",
    "one of the results is shown in figure [ f7 ] .",
    "the radius of the progenitor star is assumed to be @xmath209 cm , which is required to explain the observed duration of the outburst of a few hundred seconds .",
    "we mention an inadequacy of our light curve model .",
    "results of optical spectroscopic observations of the nebular phase of sn 2008d @xcite strongly indicate the aspherical nature of sn 2008d . on the contrary",
    ", our model assumes a spherical explosion , which leads to a consequence that the shock breakout simultaneously occurs at every point on the surface of the progenitor star . for an aspherical explosion ,",
    "the shock breakout does not occur simultaneously in different radial directions .",
    "the assumption of spherical symmetry is not appropriate when the duration of the shock breakout is comparable to that of the x - ray outburst .",
    "this effect modifies results of our light curve model .",
    "however , the investigation into this asynchronism requires two - dimensional hydrodynamical simulations of supernova explosions .",
    "therefore , we consider that the modeling of light curves of x - ray photons from an aspherical explosion is beyond the scope of this work",
    ". furthermore , the light curve of x - ray emission from xrf 080109 have large errors due to the paucity of photons .",
    "therefore , it is difficult to judge whether sn 2008d was a spherical or aspherical explosion using only our results assuming plane - parallel atmosphere .    .",
    "each line represents the model with @xmath210 ( solid ) and @xmath208 ( dashed ) .",
    "the initial velocity and the initial position of the shock are fixed ( @xmath73 and @xmath72 cm ) . ]      finally , we check the consistency of our model with the observational results . since we have assumed the black body radiation with the photon temperature of @xmath199 kev and the scale of the emitting region to be @xmath191 cm , the luminosity @xmath99 of the emission is of the order of @xmath211 erg / s .",
    "the time during which the shock wave emits thermal photons , @xmath212 is of the order of seconds .",
    "therefore , the total energy of the thermal emission is evaluated as @xmath213 erg . on the other hand , from the results of the simulation ( fig .",
    "[ f4 ] ) , the ratio of the energy of non - thermal x - ray photons with 0.3 - 10 kev to that of the thermal emission is evaluated as @xmath214-@xmath215 . using these values , we obtain the total emitted energy of non - thermal x - ray photons with 0.3 - 10 kev , @xmath216(3 - 4)@xmath217 erg , which agrees with the observed value very well . in other words , adopting the progenitor radius of @xmath209 cm , we can explain both the duration and the total energy of the observed x - ray emission .",
    "it should be noted that the above estimate has an uncertainty . to obtain the spectrum shown in fig .",
    "[ f4 ] , we use photons outside the photosphere ( @xmath196 ) .",
    "however , photons in the downstream of the shock must diffuse out later and contribute to the thermal part of the spectrum .",
    "especially , photons in the region where @xmath218 can escape from the shock front .",
    "therefore , we may overestimate the ratio @xmath105 by a factor of @xmath219 .",
    "kev@xmath220 kev ) calculated using the same model as in fig .",
    "different lines represent the numbers of photons in the energy ranges of @xmath198-@xmath197 kev ( solid ) , @xmath198-@xmath221 kev ( dashed ) , and @xmath221-@xmath197 kev ( dotted ) as functions of time . ]",
    "in this paper , we calculate the propagation of photons at the supernova shock breakout by using a monte - carlo technique in order to explain the power - law spectrum revealed by x - ray observations for xrf 080109/sn 2008d in the framework of the shock breakout origin of the x - ray photons .",
    "we use the self - similar solution for the propagation of a shock wave in a stellar envelope presented in @xcite to acquire the velocity profile and evaluate the optical depth for photons around the shock front .",
    "our hydrodynamical model is more realistic than that used in @xcite and allows us to obtain plausible constraints on the nature of the shock breakout occurred in sn 2008d .",
    "our simulations clearly demonstrate that a mildly relativistic shock velocity , @xmath222 , is required for the spectrum of photons emitted from the shock front to deviate from the black body spectrum due to repeated scatterings around the shock , i.e. , the bulk comptonization .",
    "the resultant spectra successfully reproduce the power - law spectrum with the exponent of @xmath223 seen in the x - ray spectrum of xrf 080109 .",
    "we also investigate whether some radiative processes , photoionization , radiative recombination , and free - free absorption , interrupt the formation of the power - law tail and find that none of them hardly changes the shape of the spectra as long as progenitor stars of type ib or ic supernovae are concerned .    assuming a spherical explosion , light curves of the x - ray photons are derived . to account for the duration of the x - ray emission from xrf 080109 , the progenitor radius of @xmath0 cm is needed .",
    "although this value is somewhat large compared to the typical radius of wolf - rayet stars , the shock breakout taking place in a dense stellar wind may explain the discrepancy .",
    "furthermore , our model successfully explain the total energy of the observed x - ray emission .",
    "because the density structure of the wind is not known , it is unclear whether our power - law approximation of the atmosphere is appropriate for the situation .",
    "however , the fact that our results weakly depend on the parameter @xmath27 suggests that the bulk comptonization can operate even in the dense wind and produce a power - law x - ray spectrum .",
    "our model does not include the contribution of photons from the downstream of the shock and the matter ejected at @xmath224 .",
    "however , as we noted in  3.1 , photons originating from far downstream have a black body spectrum .",
    "so they do not contribute to non - thermal photons .",
    "in the same way , photons emitted by the ejected matter are not important .",
    "in particular , after the shock breakout , the ejected matter cools rapidly due to adiabatic expansion .",
    "it must emit optical or uv photons rather than x - ray photons .",
    "therefore , both of them hardly change at least the high energy part of the energy spectra calculated using our model . as we noted above ,",
    "however , these thermal photons may decrease the ratio of thermal to non - thermal emission from the value obtained in  3.3 .",
    "it should be noted that our model to calculate the radiation from the supernova shock breakout may have a few inadequacies .",
    "the used self - similar solution can not deal with highly relativistic flows and the photon temperature is assumed to be equal to the gas temperature even after the shock breakout occurs .",
    "such caveats are improved by calculating the radiation from the supernova shock breakout by using more sophisticated simulation codes , e.g , a multi - group radiation hydrodynamics code .",
