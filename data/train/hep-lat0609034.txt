    "in the last several years the use of the overlap lattice fermion has become more popular because the conceptual and technical clarity that results from its exact chiral symmetry is seen to overcome its superficially higher computational cost as compared to conventional lattice formulations of the fermion .",
    "furthermore , the disparity in numerical intensity can be mitigated by using coarse lattice spacing , given that good scaling and localization properties are established .",
    "hernndez , jansen , and lscher  @xcite have shown numerically that neuberger s overlap operator is local on pure - glue backgrounds ( using the wilson gauge action on fine lattices ) .",
    "the decay rate ( inverse of the range ) @xmath1 of the overlap kernel can be interpreted as the mass of unphysical degrees of freedom .",
    "recently , golterman , shamir , and svetitsky  @xcite have argued that , in practice , these can be dangerously light .",
    "they provide an indirect estimate for pure - gauge ensembles ( for wilson , iwasaki , and dbw2 gauge actions ) at different lattice spacings . for cutoff",
    "@xmath2 they estimate @xmath3 , which is acceptably large . for @xmath4 , however , they raise an alarm with their estimate of @xmath5 for the wilson case , @xmath6 for iwasaki , and @xmath7 for dbw2 .    however , their estimate is indirect , and follows a chain of approximations at the end of which they assume that @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the `` mobility edge '' of a dirac spectrum .",
    "here we come to a very different conclusion using the most direct approach which takes advantage of the fact that it is not expensive to _ calculate _ , rather than _ estimate _ , @xmath10 .",
    "( by comparison , it would be much more expensive to calculate the overlap propagator @xmath11 which must be computed by nested iterations . )    in contrast to the results of golterman , shamir , and svetitsky  @xcite , who speculate that overlap simulations with a cutoff of @xmath0 ( such as  @xcite ) might have a range as long as 4 lattice units , here we show directly that such is not the case ; with appropriate choice of negative wilson s mass , the range is about 1 lattice unit ( in euclidean distance or 2 units of `` taxi - driver '' distance ) .",
    "all is well .",
    "a preliminary version of these results was presented in  @xcite .",
    "durr , hoelbling , and wenger  @xcite came to similar conclusions using the overlap operator with a uv filtered ( `` thick link '' ) wilson kernel .",
    "we use the renormalization - group - improved iwasaki  @xcite gauge action , on three different lattices ; for each , the lattice size , lattice spacing , and number of configurations used are tabulated in table  [ table : lattices ] .",
    ".[table : lattices ] lattice size , lattice spacing ( as set by the sommer parameter @xmath12",
    "@xcite ) , lattice spacing ( as set by @xmath13  @xcite ) , and number of configurations ( for scaling / locality ) .",
    "[ cols=\"<,<,<,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     so even at lattices as coarse as @xmath14 ( @xmath15 scale ) , the range is about 1 lattice unit ( measured using euclidean distance , or 2 units using taxi - driver distance ) .",
    "no unphysical degrees of freedom are induced at distances longer than the lattice cutoff .",
    "we include here a useful check of our calculations and expectations . with the same program used for the interacting - field case , we have calculated @xmath16 for source @xmath17 and",
    "sink @xmath18 for the free - field case , that is , with all @xmath19 matrices on the links set equal to the identity matrix .",
    "we compared the output with an alternative calculation in terms of fourier series and found complete agreement .",
    "as an aside , we then repeated the calculation of the overlap operator range for the free - field case .",
    "free field case for the @xmath20 lattice ( cut=1 ) .",
    "@xmath21 is displayed ( red points ) for all coordinates ; the average @xmath22 over all equivalent points with a given taxi - driver distance @xmath23 is shown in blue . ]    for the @xmath20 lattice , we display in fig .  [",
    "fig : free ] a plot for the free - field case similar to that of the interacting case ( fig .",
    "[ fig : taxi_16 ] ) , and using the same value to cut the data . an important difference , however , is that we display the value of @xmath21 for _ all _ points , that is , the maximum is not taken as in eq .",
    "[ taxi_def ] .",
    "one sees in fig .",
    "[ fig : free ] that , in contrast to the interacting case , the maximum values for each taxi - driver distance do not form a smooth envelope",
    ". presumably , this is a consequence of the lack of rotational invariance for the free case .",
    "this lack of smoothness makes it difficult to obtain a quantitative estimate of the range .",
    "a much smoother curve is obtained by taking the average ( mean ) @xmath22 , rather than the maximum , of all equivalent points which have the same taxi - driver distance .",
    "but alas , this is different from what has been presented for the interacting case .    to make a direct comparison of the interacting to the free case , we plot in fig .  [",
    "fig : ratio_free ] the ratio of @xmath24 for the interacting to @xmath25 for the free - field case . here , for each configuration , the average is taken over all coordinates which have a given taxi - driver distance @xmath23 .",
    "then an average and standard error are calculated over all configurations .",
    "ratio of interacting to free field case ( cut=1 ) . ]    for large taxi - driver distance @xmath23 , we expect an exponential decay @xmath26 , and thus expect the ratio to decay exponentially as @xmath27 where @xmath28 the graph is fit quite nicely with a long straight line giving a value @xmath29 .",
    "notice that a positive value indicates that @xmath30 .",
    "initially , this was not expected from preliminary mobility - edge arguments  @xcite .",
    "but it is now acknowledged that the connection between mobility edge and overlap range is severed already in the free - field case  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , a crude heuristic argument in support of the observation can be made .",
    "to wit , regard @xmath16 as a sum of contributions from various paths of links connecting source @xmath17 to sink @xmath18 . in the free case ,",
    "the product of these links is the identity . in the interacting case",
    ", it is a path - dependent matrix with norm less than one",
    ". then one would expect @xmath31 for each @xmath23 .",
    "if each decays exponentially at large @xmath23 , then one can not have @xmath32 without contradiction .",
    "at lattice 2004 , davies _ et al . _  @xcite collected world data to demonstrate that different quenched quark formulations",
    "could have a consistent continuum limit .",
    "`` aoki '' plot for various quenched data , as obtained from  @xcite .",
    "our data ( solid circles ) are labeled `` overlap '' . ]    the conclusion , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : aoki ] , is that they could .",
    "but we emphasize that the constrained fit demanded that there exist a global continuum limit ( by design ) .",
    "furthermore , the global continuum limit differed substantially from the continuum limit obtained solely from the wilson formulation where the discretization errors are the largest .",
    "the lesson learned is that with large discretization errors , it is quite possible to be misled when extrapolating to the continuum limit , even with high statistics and many lattice spacings .",
    "it is important to seek a formulation with very small discretization errors to be able to trust the continuum extrapolation .",
    "here we add our data `` overlap '' ( solid circles in fig .",
    "[ fig : aoki ] ) to the global quenched spectrum data and find that of all the formulations , its discretization errors are smallest , allowing for viable computation at surprisingly coarse lattice spacing .    as another example of the efficacy of the overlap formulation",
    ", we made a non - perturbative computation  @xcite of the renormalization constants of composite operators on the @xmath33 lattice using the regularization independent scheme .",
    "we found that the relations @xmath34 and @xmath35 agree well ( within 1% ) above the renormalization point @xmath36 .",
    "the @xmath37 and @xmath38 corrections of the renormalization are small ; the mass dependence is less than about 3% up to @xmath39 .",
    "it is viable to simulate quenched overlap fermions at surprisingly coarse lattice spacing .",
    "locality is well under control ; the range ( characteristic exponential decay length ) is about one lattice unit ( of euclidean distance , or about two lattice units of taxi - driver distance ) for lattice spacing as coarse as @xmath40 ( @xmath15 scale ) , such as that used in  @xcite , and trends to zero ( in physical units ) in the continuum limit .",
    "scaling is excellent ; the aoki plot is almost flat up to @xmath40 .",
    "the overlap fermion outperforms the other formulations , that is , discretization errors are the smallest for overlap .",
    "non - perturbative renormalization of operators show little mass dependence  @xcite ; e.g.  less than about 3% up to @xmath39 for the renormalization factors .",
