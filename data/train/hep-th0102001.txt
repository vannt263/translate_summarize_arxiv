    "asymptotically anti - de sitter ( ads ) spacetimes continue to attract a great deal of attention , primarily because of the recently conjectured ads conformal field theory ( cft ) correspondence principle .",
    "this principle posits a relationship between supergravity or string theory in bulk ads spacetimes and conformal field theories on the boundary .",
    "it offers the tantalizing possibility that a full quantum theory of gravity could be described by a well understood cft - yang - mills theory ( albeit with the asymptotic ads criterion ) .",
    "observables in the quantum gravity theory could be computed using quantum field - theoretic methods , and vice versa .",
    "although there is no proof of the conjecture , a dictionary is emerging that translates between different quantities in the bulk gravity theory and its counterparts on the boundary , including the partition functions and correlation functions of each .",
    "a set of quantities of particular interest are those associated with gravitational thermodynamics .",
    "it has long been known  that a physical entropy @xmath2 and temperature @xmath3 can be ascribed to a given black hole configuration , where these quantities are respectively proportional to the area and surface gravity of the event horizon(s ) @xcite .",
    "other black hole properties , such as energy , angular momentum and conserved charge can also be given a thermodynamic interpretation @xcite .",
    "more recently it has been shown that entropy can be associated with a broader and qualitatively different object called a misner string , which is the gravitational analogue of a dirac string @xcite .     in general",
    "the problem of defining and calculating gravitational thermodynamic quantities remains a lively subject of interest . because they typically diverge for both asymptotically flat and asymptotically ads spacetimes , a common approach toward evaluating them",
    "has been to carry out all computations relative to some other spacetime that is regarded as the ground state for the class of spacetimes of interest .",
    "this is done by taking the original action @xmath4  for gravity coupled to matter fields and subtracting from it a reference action @xmath5 , which is a functional of the induced metric @xmath6 on the boundary @xmath7 .  conserved and/or thermodynamic quantities are then computed relative to this boundary , which can then be taken to ( spatial ) infinity if desired .",
    "this approach has been widely successful in providing a description of gravitational thermodynamics in regions of both finite and infinite spatial extent @xcite .",
    "unfortunately it suffers from several drawbacks .",
    "the choice of reference spacetime is not always unique @xcite , nor is it always possible to embed a boundary with a given induced metric into the reference background .",
    "indeed , for kerr spacetimes , this latter problem forms a serious obstruction towards calculating the subtraction energy , and calculations have only been performed in the slow - rotating regime @xcite .",
    "an extension of this approach , which addresses these difficulties was recently developed based on the conjectured ads / cft correspondence @xcite .",
    "since quantum field theories in general contain counterterms , it is natural from the ads / cft viewpoint to append a boundary term @xmath8  to the action that depends on the intrinsic geometry of the ( timelike ) boundary at large spatial distances .",
    "this requirement , along with general covariance , implies that these terms be functionals of curvature invariants of the induced metric and have no dependence on the extrinsic curvature of the boundary .",
    "an algorithmic procedure @xcite exists for constructing @xmath8  for asymptotically ads spacetimes , and so its determination is unique .",
    "the addition of @xmath8  will not affect the bulk equations of motion , thereby eliminating the need to embed the given geometry in a reference spacetime . hence thermodynamic and conserved quantities",
    "can now be calculated intrinsically for any given spacetime .",
    "the efficacy of this approach has been demonstrated in a broad range of examples , all of them in the spatially infinite limit , where the ads / cft correspondence applies @xcite .",
    "however this limit is an idealization , and can never be satisfied in reality .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to investigate the effects of including @xmath8  for quasilocal gravitational thermodynamics for situations in which the region enclosed by  @xmath7 is spatially finite .",
    "there are several reasons for considering this .",
    "although the ads / cft correspondence is conjectured to be valid only at infinity ,  from a gravitational viewpoint the inclusion of additional boundary functionals is not uniquely dependent upon this correspondence and could in fact be carried out even if the conjecture is ultimately found to be invalid .",
    "it is , therefore of interest to explore the implications of @xmath8  outside of its original conceptual framework .",
    "furthermore , the inclusion of @xmath8  eliminates the embedding problem from consideration whether or not the spatially infinite limit is taken , and it is of interest to see what its impact is on quasilocal thermodynamics . since @xmath8 is a functional of the induced metric",
    ", it will in general depend upon parameters in the solution related to conserved quantities at infinity , and could conceivably alter the results obtained for quasilocal thermodynamics relative to a fixed background .",
    "of course @xmath8  itself is no longer unique , since one could add any functional of curvature invariants that vanished at infinity in a given dimension .",
    "however the expression for @xmath8  obtained by the algorithm given in ref .",
    "@xcite is the minimal one required to eliminate divergences , and therefore merits study .",
    "we specifically consider in this paper an investigation of the thermodynamic properties of the class of kerr and kerr ads black holes in the context of spatially finite boundary conditions , with the boundary action supplemented by @xmath8 . with their lower degree of symmetry relative to spherically symmetric black holes , these spacetimes allow for a more detailed study of the consequences of including @xmath8 for spatially finite boundaries .",
    "although the inclusion of @xmath8 was originally proposed for asymptotically ads spacetimes , it has been demonstrated that it can be extended to asymptotically flat spacetimes @xcite under certain topological constraints @xcite .",
    "we consider the implications of this extension for kerr black holes in spatially finite regions .",
    "the outline of our paper is as follows .",
    "we review the basic formalism in sec .",
    "[ genfor ] . in the next two sections we compute the quasilocal energy , mass , and angular momentum for the kerr and kerr - anti - de sitter black holes respectively .",
    "these quantities must be computed numerically for general values of the parameters , and we present our results graphically . we perform a simple stability analysis for each case , and compare this to previous analyses carried out at infinity @xcite .",
    "we finish our paper with some concluding remarks .",
    "the action is the sum of three kinds of terms .",
    "the first two are a volume ( or bulk ) term @xmath9   \\label{e3}\\ ] ] and a boundary term   @xmath10 chosen so that the variational principle is well defined .",

    "@xmath18 is the trace of the extrinsic curvature @xmath19 of any boundary(ies ) @xmath20 of the manifold @xmath11 , with the induced metric(s ) @xmath21 ; the manifold can have internal boundary components as well as a boundary at infinity , although only the latter will be needed in what follows . here",
    "@xmath22 is the matter lagrangian and @xmath23 the cosmological constant , which , in what follows , will be taken to be either zero or negative .",
    "in general @xmath24 and @xmath25 are both divergent when evaluated on solutions , as is the hamiltonian , and other associated thermodynamic quantities @xcite .  rather than eliminating these divergences by incorporating a reference term in the spacetime @xcite , a new term @xmath26",
    "is added to the action which is a functional only of boundary curvature invariants .",
    "although there are a very large number of possible invariants one could add in a given dimension , only a finite number of them can eliminate the divergences at spatial infinity , which arise from @xmath24 and @xmath25 . for an asymptotically ads spacetime , these can be determined by an algorithmic procedure @xcite .",
    "quantities such as energy , entropy , etc .",
    ", can then be understood as intrinsically defined for a given spacetime , as opposed to being defined relative to some abstract ( and non - unique ) background , although this latter option is still available . in four dimensions",

    "we shall study the implications of including the terms in ( [ e5 ] ) for kerr - ads black holes in spatially finite regions .",
    "although other counterterms ( of higher mass dimension ) may be added to @xmath8 , they will make no contribution to the evaluation of the action or hamiltonian due to the rate at which they decrease toward spatial infinity , and we shall not consider them in our analysis here .    a generalization of the prescription ( [ e5 ] ) to spacetimes that are not asymptotically ads is @xcite @xmath30 which is equivalent to eq .",
    "( [ e5 ] ) for small @xmath31 ( as well as fixed @xmath31 and large mean boundary radius ) , and which ( formally ) has a well defined limit for vanishing cosmological constant ( @xmath32 ) .",

    "of course these values of @xmath95 depend on the value of the radius @xmath106 which is chosen for the quasilocal surface .",
    "now we consider the quasilocal conserved charges of the kerr metric .",
    "the kerr metric has two killing vectors and therefore there exist two conserved quantities .",
    "the first one , which is due to the timelike killing vector @xmath132 , is associated with the conserved mass , @xmath133 of the system expressed as : @xmath134 where @xmath46 is the lapse function .",

    "we find that the value of @xmath11 due to the @xmath145 third term in eq .",
    "( [ km12 ] ) is very small compared to that of the first two terms .",
    "the second non - trivial conserved charge is the @xmath146 component of the angular momentum , @xmath147 which can be expressed as : @xmath148 where  @xmath149 is killing vector @xmath150 remarkably we find that the counter terms @xmath151 , while non - zero , give a vanishing contribution upon integration in ( [ km14 ] ) .",
    "hence the total angular momentum is due entirely to the first term , which is :    @xmath152    valid for any quasilocal surface of fixed @xmath88 .",

    "however quasilocal thermodynamic quantities are generally given by surface integrals over the boundary data rather than by products of constant surface data .",
    "in particular , it is not possible to choose the quasilocal surface to simultaneously be both isothermal and a surface of constant @xmath157 and neither is true for the quasilocal surface we have chosen ( one at fixed @xmath88 ) .",
    "furthermore it is by now well recognized that the entropy of a black hole depends only on the geometry of its horizon in the classical approximation , and is conversely independent of the asymptotic behavior of the gravitational field or of the presence of external matter fields .  for stationary black holes ,",
    "the entropy is one - quarter of the horizon area , yielding  @xmath158 in this case .",
    "we therefore shall regard the energy @xmath0 in eq .",
    "( [ km6 ] ) as the thermodynamic internal energy for the kerr black hole within the boundary @xmath88 , view it as a function of  @xmath106 , the entropy @xmath2 , and the angular momentum @xmath1 , and define the temperature and the angular velocity from their ensemble derivatives , integrated over the quasilocal boundary data .    for the temperature",
