    "one of the most important purposes of studying the nucleon - nucleon ( @xmath10 ) and hyperon - nucleon ( @xmath11 ) interactions in the quark model is to understand comprehensively the fundamental strong interaction in a natural picture , in which the quark - gluon degree of freedom is relevant to describe the short - range part of the interaction , while the medium- and long - range parts of the interaction are dominated by the meson - exchange processes .",
    "we have recently achieved a simultaneous and realistic description of the @xmath10 and @xmath11 interactions in the resonating - group ( rgm ) formalism of the spin - flavor @xmath0 quark model @xcite . in this approach the effective quark - quark ( @xmath12 )",
    "interaction is built by combining a phenomenological quark - confining potential and the colored version of the fermi - breit ( fb ) interaction with minimum effective meson - exchange potentials ( emep ) of scalar and pseudo - scalar meson nonets directly coupled to quarks .",
    "the flavor symmetry breaking for the @xmath11 system is explicitly introduced through the quark - mass dependence of the hamiltonian .",
    "an advantage of introducing the emep at the quark level lies in the stringent relationship of the flavor dependence appearing in the various @xmath10 and @xmath11 interaction pieces . in this way we can utilize our rich knowledge of the @xmath10 interaction to minimize the ambiguity of model parameters , which is crucial since the present experimental data for the @xmath11 interaction are still very scarce .    in this study",
    "we upgrade our model @xcite by incorporating such interaction pieces provided by scalar and vector mesons as the spin - orbit ( @xmath13 ) , quadratic spin - orbit ( @xmath14 ) , and the momentum - dependent bryan - scott terms .",
    "introduction of these pieces to the emep is primarily motivated by the insufficient description of the experimental data by previous models .",
    "first , some discrepancy of the @xmath10 phase shifts in previous models requires the introduction of vector mesons .",
    "for example , @xmath15 phase shift in the model fss @xcite is more attractive than experiment by @xmath16 around @xmath17 .",
    "this implies that the one - pion tensor force is too strong in our previous models . in the standard one - boson exchange potentials ( obep ) ,",
    "the strong one - pion tensor force is partially weakened by the @xmath4 meson tensor force .",
    "we use the @xmath14 force of vector mesons from the reasons given below .",
    "furthermore , some phase shifts of other partial waves deviate from the empirical ones by a couple of degrees . another improvement is required as for the central attraction . the @xmath2-matrix calculation using the quark - exchange kernel",
    "explicitly @xcite shows that energy - independent attraction , dominated by @xmath18-meson exchange , is unrealistic , since in our previous models the single particle ( s.p . ) potentials in symmetric nuclear matter show a strongly attractive behavior in the momentum region @xmath3 .",
    "we have shown in @xcite that this flaw can be removed by introducing the momentum - dependent higher - order term of scalar - meson exchange potentials , the importance of which was first pointed out by bryan and scott @xcite . in the higher energy region ,",
    "the @xmath13 term of the scalar mesons also makes an appreciable contribution , in addition to this momentum dependent term .",
    "another purpose of the present investigation is to examine the charge symmetry breaking ( csb ) and the coulomb effect from the viewpoint of the quark model .",
    "it is well known that the @xmath19 phase shift of the @xmath20 interaction is slightly less attractive than that of the @xmath21 interaction .",
    "this charge independence breaking ( cib ) is partially explained by the so - called pion - coulomb correction @xcite , which implies 1 ) the small mass difference of the neutron and the proton , 2 ) the mass difference of the charged pion and the neutral pion , and 3 ) the coulomb effect .",
    "furthermore , it was claimed long ago that the @xmath22 interaction should be more attractive than the @xmath23 interaction , since the binding energy of the @xmath24 ground state of @xmath25 is fairly larger than that of @xmath26 @xcite .",
    "the csb energy of 350 kev in these isodoublet hypernuclei is much larger than @xmath27 100 kev csb effect seen in the @xmath28-@xmath29 binding energy difference after the correction of the @xmath20 coulomb energy in @xmath29 is made . the early version of the nijmegen potential @xcite already focused on this csb in the obep including the pion - coulomb correction and the correct threshold energies of the @xmath7-@xmath8 coupling in the particle basis .",
    "the rgm calculation using the particle basis is rather cumbersome , since all the spin - flavor factors of the quark - exchange kernel should be recalculated by properly incorporating the @xmath30-components of the isospin quantum numbers .",
    "furthermore , there is a problem inherent in the rgm formalism : the internal energies of the clusters are usually not properly reproduced when a unique model hamiltonian is used .",
    "we have given in @xcite a convenient prescription to avoid this problem without spoiling the exact effect of the pauli principle .",
    "for the coulomb effect , we calculate the full exchange kernel without any approximation .",
    "the pion - coulomb correction and the correct treatment of the threshold energies in the particle basis are found to be very important for the detailed description of the low - energy observables in the @xmath8 - @xmath7 coupled - channel problem .    with these renovations of emep and the framework ,",
    "we have again searched for model parameters in the isospin basis to fit the most recent result of the @xmath10 phase shifts , the deuteron binding energy , the @xmath19 @xmath10 scattering length , and the low - energy @xmath11 total cross section data .",
    "this model is named fss2 since it is based on our previous model fss @xcite .",
    "the agreement of the phase - shift parameters in the @xmath10 sector is greatly improved .",
    "the model fss2 shares the good reproduction of the @xmath11 scattering data and the essential features of the @xmath7-@xmath8 coupling with our previous models @xcite . the single - particle ( s.p . ) potentials of @xmath31 , @xmath1 and @xmath9",

    "it is important to note that this confinement potential gives a vanishing contribution to the baryon - baryon interaction , since we assume @xmath42 harmonic oscillator wave functions with a common width parameter @xmath43 for the internal cluster wave functions .",

    "the @xmath53 parameters of the emep coupling constants are therefore @xmath104 , @xmath106 , and @xmath107 .",
    "the s - meson exchange emep in involves not only the attractive leading term , but also the momentum - dependent @xmath108 term and the @xmath13 term .",
    "the ps - meson exchange operator is the same as before , but the parameter @xmath109 is introduced only for the one - pion exchange , in order to reduce the very strong effect of the delta - function type contact term involved in the spin - spin interaction .",

    "we will not discuss this problem here , but take a standpoint to avoid this double counting problem for the short - range repulsion and the @xmath13 force , by simply choosing appropriate coupling constants for vector mesons .",
    "the magnetic term is usually important for the isovector @xmath4 meson , and yields the spin - spin , tensor and @xmath14 terms in the standard obep .",
    "the choice in is to keep only the @xmath14 term with the spin - spin term proportional to @xmath113 , the reason for which is discussed below .",
    "finally , the cross term between the electric and magnetic coupling constants leads to the @xmath13 force for the @xmath12 interaction .",
    "the antisymmetric @xmath13 ( @xmath114 ) force with @xmath115 is not generated from emep , because the flavor operator in is the gell - mann matrix and also because the mass difference between the up - down and strange quark masses is ignored in .",
    "we should keep in mind that these emep are by no means a theoretical consequence of the real meson - exchange processes taking place between quarks .",
    "first of all , the static approximation used to derive the meson - exchange potentials between quarks is not permissible , since the masses of s mesons and v mesons are more than twice as heavy as the quark mass @xmath116 300 - 400 mev .",
    "since the parameter @xmath117 is not small , the non - relativistic reduction is not justified . also , the very strong s - meson central attraction is just a replacement of the real processes of the @xmath118 exchange , the @xmath119 exchange , the @xmath120 excitations and so forth .",
    "the v mesons are supposed to behave as composite particles of the @xmath121 pairs .",
    "furthermore , the choice of terms in is quite ad hoc and phenomenological .",
    "we should consider as an effective interaction to simulate the residual interaction between quarks , which is not taken into account by the fb interaction .",
    "the calculation of the basic born kernel in for each term of becomes rather involved , if we use the standard technique of calculating the exchange kernel via the generator - coordinate kernel ( gcm kernel ) .",
    "this becomes especially tedious , when the @xmath12 interaction involves the non - static @xmath108 dependence and the second - order term of @xmath122 as in the @xmath14 force .",
    "we have developed in @xcite a new technique to calculate the born kernel directly from the two - body interaction in the momentum representation . in this technique , there is no need to calculate the gcm kernel . since the final expression is rather lengthy for the exchange kernel , it is relegated to appendix a. here we only show the direct term , which is particularly useful to see the main characteristics of the emep introduced in the present model : @xmath123 -{3 \\over 2(3m_{ud})^2}x^{ls}_{0d_+ } i\\bn \\cdot \\bs~\\right\\}\\ , \\nonumber \\\\ & & m^{\\rm ps}_d(\\bq_f , \\bq_i ) = -f^2 { 1 \\over m_{\\pi^+}^2 } { 4\\pi \\over \\bk^2+m^2}e^{-{1 \\over 3}(b\\bk)^2 } x^t_{0d_+ } \\left[~(\\bfsigma_1 \\cdot \\bk ) ( \\bfsigma_2 \\cdot \\bk ) -(1-c_\\delta)(m^2+\\bk^2){1 \\over 3 } ( \\bfsigma_1 \\cdot \\bfsigma_2)\\right]\\ , \\nonumber \\\\ & & m^{\\rm v}_d(\\bq_f , \\bq_i ) = { 4\\pi \\over \\bk^2+m^2}e^{-{1 \\over 3 } ( b\\bk)^2 } \\left\\{~(f^e)^2~x^c_{0d_+}\\left[~1+{3 \\over 2(3m_{ud})^2 } \\left(\\bq^2+{9 \\over 2b^2 } \\right ) ~\\right ] \\right .",

    "this repulsion is almost 300 mev if @xmath110 is assumed .",
    "furthermore , the value of @xmath109 has a strong influence on the internal energies of single baryons .",
    "it reduces the very large contribution of the pion to the @xmath31-@xmath120 and @xmath1-@xmath9 mass difference , the latter helping us to keep @xmath132 at the moderate value .",
    "( otherwise , we obtain @xmath162 . )",
    "if we do not introduce @xmath109 and the parameters @xmath139 , @xmath140 discussed below , the @xmath147 value can not be improved by more than @xmath163 .",
    "the contribution of @xmath164 and @xmath165 mesons was necessary in the previous models in order to make the @xmath166 central force relatively more repulsive than the @xmath167 central force .",
    "in the present framework , it turns out that the introduction of these @xmath164 mesons is not convenient for the subtle balance of the central and tensor forces .",
    "we therefore take out all these @xmath164-meson contributions .",
    "the well - known too strong repulsion of the @xmath10 @xmath167 central force from the color - magnetic interaction of the fb interaction @xcite is remedied by assuming two different masses for the isovector @xmath168 meson , i.e. , @xmath169 for the @xmath10 system and @xmath170 for the @xmath11 system ( see comment 3 ) in table i ) .",
    "4 .   as is discussed at the end of the preceding subsection",
    ", the present model fss2 is the @xmath14 dominant model .",
    "this implies that we use the @xmath14 force to reduce the too strong opep tensor force , instead of the tensor force itself .",
    "the main reason for this choice is that the @xmath10 mixing parameter @xmath130 is very difficult to reproduce if the cancellation of the one pion tensor force and the @xmath4-meson tensor force is too strong for the @xmath128-wave and @xmath129-wave coupling .",
    "another question is how this @xmath14 force is incorporated into the model .",
    "we find that the @xmath14 spin - spin term @xmath171 in plays a favorable role in improving the fit of the @xmath10 phase shifts .",
    "this term corresponds to the @xmath172 term in the hamada - johnstone potential @xcite .",
    "since the full introduction of this term results in too vigorous behavior , we introduce a reduction factor @xmath139 , which turns out around @xmath173 . the two - pole formula for the @xmath4-meson exchange potential , introduced in @xcite ,",
    "is found to give a favorable result .",
    "we further find that the short - range tensor force is still too weak .",
    "we avoid this difficulty simply by increasing the strength of the tensor term of the fb interaction with the factor @xmath140 .",
    "the value @xmath174 seems to be reasonable .",
    "if we carry out the parameter search with @xmath175 , the value of @xmath147 can not be improved by more than @xmath176 , mainly due to the disagreement of @xmath130 .",
    "we should note , however , that the introduction of the v mesons is a rather minor change from our previous models . with the exception of @xmath177 , the v - meson coupling constants in table i are around one , which is less than half of the coupling constants in the standard obep .",
    "in particular , the isospin dependent @xmath13 force from the @xmath4 meson is exactly zero , since @xmath178 is fixed at zero .",
    "the short - range repulsion in the @xmath10 interaction is still mainly described by the color - magnetic term of the fb interaction .",
    "the dominant effect of the v mesons is almost solely the @xmath4 meson @xmath14 force , which is the reason we call fss2 the @xmath14 dominant model .",
    "the following five parameters in table i are directly related to the reproduction of the low - energy @xmath11 cross sections ; @xmath132 , @xmath179 , @xmath180 , @xmath181 , and @xmath182 . among them , the angle of the singlet - octet meson mixing @xmath179 of the s mesons are used to control the relative strength of the central attraction of the @xmath10 and @xmath11 interactions .",
    "it was found before @xcite that , once the @xmath179 is determined to fit the low - energy @xmath22 cross section data , the attraction of the @xmath183 channel is too strong and the @xmath35 total cross sections are overestimated .",
    "we therefore use a larger value for @xmath179 ( which is denoted by @xmath180 ) only for the @xmath184 channel in order to reduce the attraction , which is the same prescription employed in the previous models @xcite .",
    "6 .   the largest ambiguity for determining the parameters related to the @xmath11 interaction lies in the strength of the central attraction in the @xmath185 @xmath154 channel @xcite .",
    "if the phase - shift rise of the @xmath154 state is less than @xmath186 , the low - energy @xmath36 elastic total cross section becomes too small .",
    "if this attraction is too strong , as in rgm - f @xcite , the @xmath154 phase shift shows a sudden decrease from @xmath187 to 60 - @xmath188 , and the behavior of the @xmath22 total cross sections at the @xmath8 threshold becomes a round peak , instead of the cusp structure @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the strength of the central attraction plays a crucial role even for the odd - parity state .",
    "the @xmath185 @xmath189 phase shift is attractive due to the exchange kinetic - energy kernel ; i.e. , the effect of the pauli principle @xcite .",
    "this attraction is reinforced by the @xmath13 force in the diagonal channel , and also by the @xmath114 force acting between this channel and the @xmath159 channel .",
    "this channel coupling also takes place between the @xmath185 channel and the @xmath7 channel .",
    "this channel coupling is mainly determined by the strength of the @xmath114 force , which is directly related to the magnitude of @xmath131 , but also considerably influenced by the strength of the central attraction in the @xmath185 channel . in @xcite , we have clarified that the central attraction of the previous models rgm - f and fss is so strong that the @xmath185 @xmath189 resonance is moved to the @xmath7 @xmath159 channel .",
    "the consequence of this behavior is the strong enhancement of the @xmath22 total cross sections in the cusp region . on the contrary ,",
    "the @xmath190-wave coupling in the model rgm - h is less strong , and the agreement of the @xmath22 total cross sections is much better .",
    "( see fig.10(a ) in @xcite and table ii in @xcite . ) here we assume that the resonance stays in the original @xmath185 @xmath189 channel , and try to find the parameter set which gives the maximum strength of the @xmath185 central attraction . in practice",
    ", we assume @xmath191 mev ( @xmath192 is the ratio of the compton wave - length of the up - down quarks to @xmath43 ) as in rgm - f and fss,-@xmath120 mass difference 293.3 mev only by the fb interaction , as seen from table iii . if we use the @xmath131 value about 1.3 times larger , the transition of the @xmath190-wave resonance to the @xmath7 @xmath159 channel takes place in the present model . ] and adjust the value of @xmath181 for the @xmath11 interaction , independently of the value in the case of @xmath10 interaction .",
    "if we use a smaller value for @xmath181 , the @xmath184 @xmath19 state becomes more attractive and the @xmath185 @xmath154 state becomes less attractive .",
    "another important change from the previous models fss and rgm - h is the relative strength of the @xmath19 and @xmath154 attraction in the @xmath7 interaction .",
    "the maximum phase - shift values of the @xmath19 and @xmath154 states in these models are about @xmath193 and @xmath194 , respectively , around @xmath195 .",
    "the big difference of almost @xmath186 is known to be unfavorable for the description of the @xmath196-shell @xmath1-hypernuclei .",
    "detailed few - body calculations for these hypernuclei have recently been carried out by several groups @xcite by using various effective @xmath7 interactions . in these effective @xmath7 interactions , the effect of the @xmath8 channel coupling",
    "is usually renormalized .",
    "these calculations imply that the phase - shift difference of a little less than @xmath16 seems to be most appropriate .",
    "we follow this suggestion and adjust the strength of the @xmath7 attraction such that the @xmath19 and @xmath154 phase - shift difference is less than @xmath16 and the low - energy @xmath22 cross sections are correctly reproduced .",
    "we can use the @xmath197-meson mass to adjust this phase - shift difference .",
    "namely , if @xmath198 is smaller , then the @xmath7 @xmath19 phase shift becomes more attractive and the @xmath154 phase shift becomes less attractive .    in order to give an outline of the framework , we summarize the difference of fss and fss2 in table ii , with respect to the meson species and interaction types of emep included in the models .",
    "table iii shows the quark and emep contributions to the baryon mass difference between @xmath31 and @xmath120 ( @xmath199 ) , and the mass difference between @xmath1 and @xmath9 ( @xmath200 ) , calculated in the isospin basis .",
    "we note that various meson contributions largely cancel each other and the net contribution is roughly given by the quark contribution from the color - magnetic term of the fb interaction .      in this subsection",
    "we discuss some new features required in the calculation in the particle basis .",
    "three different types of calculations are carried out in this paper .",
    "1 .   calculation in the isospin basis 2 .",
    "calculation in the particle basis without the coulomb force 3 .",
    "calculation in the particle basis with the coulomb force    for the @xmath10 interaction , the calculation in the particle basis is rather straightforward .",
    "we use the empirical baryon masses listed in table [ table4 ] and evaluate spin - flavor factors for the charged pion and the neutral pion separately in the isospin representation .",
    "the other spin - flavor factors for heavier mesons and the fb interaction are generated in the simple isospin relations .",
    "the coulomb force is introduced at the quark level by using the quark charges .",
    "the exchange coulomb kernel has the same structure as the color - coulombic term of the fb interaction .",
    "only complexity arises when we solve the ls - rgm equation in the momentum representation .",
    "the standard technique by vincent and phatak @xcite is employed to solve the lippmann - schwinger equation in the momentum representation , including the coulomb force .",
    "this technique requires introducing a cut - off radius @xmath201 for the coulomb interaction . in the rgm formalism",
    ", we have to introduce this cut - off at the quark level , in order to avoid violating the pauli principle .",
    "the two - body coulomb force assumed in the present calculation is therefore written as @xmath202 where @xmath203 is the heaviside step function and @xmath204 for the up quark and @xmath205 for the down and strange quarks .",
    "the coulomb contribution to the internal energies becomes zero for the proton and @xmath206 .",
    "more explicitly , this can be given by @xmath207 where @xmath208 is the hyperfine coupling constant and the direct spin - flavor factor is expressed as @xmath209 $ ] in terms of the total charge @xmath210 of the @xmath102-th baryon .",

    "the exchange coulomb kernel is also slightly modified from the exact coulomb kernel .",

    "the value @xmath201 should be sufficiently large to be free from any nuclear effect beyond @xmath201 . then the final @xmath128-matrix is calculated from the condition that the wave function obtained by solving the lippmann - schwinger equation with the modified coulomb force is smoothly connected to the asymptotic coulomb wave function .",
    "we take @xmath215 , although a much smaller value seems to be sufficient .",
    "note that , even in the @xmath21 and @xmath216 systems , we have small contributions from the coulomb interaction through the exchange coulomb kernel .",
    "the difference between the calculations 2 ) and 3 ) for the system of chargeless particles implies this effect .    for the @xmath11 interaction , more consideration",
    "is required for the treatment of the threshold energies .",
    "we note that the mass difference of @xmath217 and @xmath206 is about 8 mev and is fairly large .",
    "figure [ thres ] shows the comparison of threshold relations in the isospin and particle bases , evaluated in the non - relativistic kinematics .",

    "we believe that the present framework , incorporating both the quark and mesonic degrees of freedom into the model explicitly , is very versatile , since it is based on the natural picture that the quarks and gluons are the most economical ingredients in the short - range region , while the meson - exchange processes are dominant in the medium- and long - range part of the interaction . since our quark model describes the short - range repulsion ( which is observed in many channels of the baryon - baryon interactions ) in terms of the non - locality of the quark exchange kernel , the effect of the short - range correlation is rather moderate , compared with the standard meson - exchange potentials .",
    "this can be seen in the magnitude of the born amplitudes used in solving the lippmann - schwinger resonating - group equations ( ls - rgm ) @xcite and the bethe - goldstone equations @xcite , and also in the fairly reasonable reproduction of the single - particle ( s.p . )",

    "we upgrade our previous model fss @xcite in two respects .",
    "the first one is the renovation of the effective meson - exchange potentials ( emep ) acting between quarks .",
    "we extend our model to include not only the leading terms of the scalar and pseudo - scalar mesons but also the vector mesons with all possible standard terms usually used in the non - relativistic one - boson exchange potentials ( obep ) .",
    "the second point is the exact incorporation of the pion - coulomb correction in the particle basis .",
    "this includes the exact treatment of the threshold energies and the coulomb exchange kernel , as well as the separate evaluation of the spin - flavor factors of the charged- and neutral - pion exchange emep .",
    "this improvement is necessary in order to study the effect of the charge symmetry breaking in the @xmath10 and @xmath11 interactions .",
    "these two renovations require various mathematical techniques which are specifically developed in refs . @xcite and @xcite for these purposes .",

    "potentials in the high - momentum region . for vector mesons , we avoid the double - counting problem @xcite with the fermi - breit ( fb ) contribution by choosing small coupling constants around 1 especially for the flavor - singlet coupling constants @xmath502 and @xmath503 . since we have also chosen @xmath504 , the @xmath13 contribution from the vector mesons is very small . for the @xmath4- and @xmath505-meson contributions ,",
    "the selected value @xmath506 through the parameter search is a standard size usually assumed in obep .",
    "although the @xmath507 term usually gives the isovector spin - spin , tensor and quadratic spin - orbit ( @xmath14 ) terms , we only retain the @xmath14 term with the @xmath113-type spin - spin term .",
    "this choice is rather ad hoc , but favorable since we do not want to introduce too strong cancellation between the one - pion tensor force and the @xmath4-meson tensor force in the @xmath154 - @xmath242 coupling term of the @xmath10 interaction .",
    "since the @xmath32 cluster wave function yields a large cut - off effect for the singular part of the one - pion exchange potential ( opep ) , we also introduce a reduction factor @xmath109 for the spin - spin contact term of the opep central force , and multiply the short - range tensor term of the fb interaction by about factor 3 . with these phenomenological ingredients ,",
