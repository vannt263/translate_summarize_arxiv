    "<S> silicon ( si ) quantum dots ( qd ) have been among the most prominent candidates for implementing spin based qubits with a potential for scalability , due to their exceptional coherence times . to build a large - scale quantum computer with si qds </S>",
    "<S> , we must address any dot - to - dot variations that can cause randomness in qubit operations . in this work </S>",
    "<S> , we identify the presence of monoatomic steps at the si / sige or si / sio@xmath0 interface as a dominant source of variations in the electron @xmath1-factors , which will cause qubit - to - qubit variability in the single qubit spin resonance frequencies . using atomistc tight - binding calculations </S>",
    "<S> we show that the stark shift of the resonance frequencies , essential to selectively address individual spin qubits , also undergoes variations due to these steps . </S>",
    "<S> we compare our theoretical predictions with experiments on qds at a si / sio@xmath0 interface , in which we observe significant differences in stark shifts between qds in two different samples . </S>",
    "<S> we also experimentally observe variations in the @xmath1-factors of one - electron and three - electron spin qubits realized in three neighboring qds on the same sample , at a level consistent with our calculations . </S>",
    "<S> the dephasing times of these qubits also vary , most likely due to their varying sensitivity to charge noise . </S>",
    "<S> more importantly , from our calculations we show that with the help of the anisotropic nature of the spin - orbit interaction ( soi ) in a si qd , we can minimize and control these variations . </S>",
    "<S> ultimately , we predict an increase in the dephasing time of the si qd spin qubits by at least an order of magnitude , by aligning the external dc magnetic field towards specific crystal orientations .    </S>",
    "<S> a scalable quantum computing architecture requires reproducibility and control over key qubit properties , such as resonance frequency , coherence time , etc . </S>",
    "<S> variability in such parameters among qubits of a large - scale quantum computer would necessitate individual characterization and control@xcite of every qubit in that computer , while excessive variability could even make scaling impractical . in order to assess and possibly mitigate these issues we need to identify and understand potential sources of device - to - device variability in critical qubit behavior .    </S>",
    "<S> spin qubits hosted in silicon ( si ) quantum dots ( qd)@xcite have been showing promise as a potential building block for a large - scale quantum computer@xcite , because of their compatibility with already existing cmos technology and the long coherence times available due to the presence of negligible nuclear spins in isotopically purified @xmath2si@xcite . single@xcite and </S>",
    "<S> two qubit@xcite gates have been demonstrated already . to move forward with increasing number of qubits@xcite </S>",
    "<S> , we have to study possible sources of variability and randomness in these qubits .    </S>",
    "<S> the energy levels of interest in a si qd for qubit operations are two low lying valley states @xmath3 and @xmath4 , each split in two spin levels in the presence of a dc magnetic field , @xmath5 . until recently </S>",
    "<S> , the main focus has been to improve the valley splitting energy to create well isolated states . in metal - oxide - semiconductor </S>",
    "<S> based si qds , this is now routinely achieved@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , it turns out that the @xmath1-factor and thus the spin splitting ( @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the bohr magneton ) is valley dependent@xcite and as we will show experimentally , is sample - to - sample dependent .    in a si quantum well or dot , presence of structure inversion asymmetry ( sia ) introduces the rashba spin - orbit interaction ( soi)@xcite . though it is known that due to the lack of bulk inversion asymmetry ( bia ) , the dresselhaus soi is absent from bulk si , interface inversion asymmetry ( iia ) contributes a dresselhaus - like term in interface confined structures in si@xcite . both the rashba and dresselhaus soi </S>",
    "<S> modify the electron @xmath1-factors in a si qd and enable the stark shift of the @xmath1-factors through gate voltage tuning@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> different sign of the rashba ( @xmath8 ) and dresselhaus coefficients ( @xmath9 ) results in different g - factors among the two valley states@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the dresselhaus contribution is usually much stronger than rashba soi@xcite and dominates the @xmath1-factor renormalization @xcite .        </S>",
    "<S> [ fi1 ]    in a si qd under strong vertical electric field , the electron is usually confined to only one interface . a monoatomic shift in the location of this interface results in a sign inversion of the dresselhaus coefficient ( @xmath10 ) but </S>",
    "<S> the rashba coefficient ( @xmath11 ) remains unchanged@xcite . in practice , </S>",
    "<S> si / sige or si / sio@xmath0 interface certainly contains roughness , i.e monoatomic steps@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a non - ideal interface with monoatomic steps can be thought of as multiple smooth interface regions , where interfaces of neighboring regions are shifted by one atomic layer with respect to each other . </S>",
    "<S> thus the neighboring regions will result in an opposite sign of @xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> an electron wavefunction spread over multiple such regions will witness multiple local @xmath10s and the effective @xmath10 will be an weighted average of these @xmath10s . </S>",
    "<S> thus the presence of interface steps can change both the sign and magnitude of the effective dresselhaus contribution to the electron @xmath1-factors in a si qd@xcite .    here </S>",
    "<S> we show from atomistic tight - binding simulations of a si qd how the @xmath1-factors and their stark shifts can vary due to the presence of monoatomic steps at the interface . such variations in the @xmath1-factors and their gate voltage dependence is measured in gate defined quantum dots formed in a si / sio@xmath0 interface for two different samples ( a and b ) with similar architecture . in sample </S>",
    "<S> a , we were able to form three neighboring qds and in sample b , we were able to form only one qd . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , there are significant differences in the measured @xmath12 times among one - electron and three - electron qubits realized in these dots . </S>",
    "<S> we understand that the one - electron qubit corresponds to electron occupying the lower energy valley state @xmath3 , whereas the three - electron qubit corresponds to electron occupying the higher energy valley state @xmath4 . finally with the help of both atomistic and analytic calculations , </S>",
    "<S> we show that by changing the direction of the external magnetic field we can control the variability and stark shift of the g - factors and improve the dephasing times , @xmath12 .        </S>",
    "<S> [ fi2 ]    fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 1 shows how a monoatomic step at the interface of a si qd can affect the @xmath1-factors of the valley states and their electric field dependence , with an external magnetic field along the [ 110 ] crystal orientation , from atomistic tight - binding simulations . </S>",
    "<S> an electron wavefunction near an interface step is shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 1a . </S>",
    "<S> the distance between the dot center and the location of the edge of the interface step is denoted by @xmath13 . </S>",
    "<S> the dot radius is around 10 nm . </S>",
    "<S> so for @xmath14 - 10 nm the dot is completely on the left side of the step and has different @xmath1-factors compared to that for @xmath1510 nm , when the dot is completely on the right side of the step as seen in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 1b . </S>",
    "<S> for -10 nm@xmath1610 nm , the @xmath1-factors are weighted average of those of the two sides based on the dot location . </S>",
    "<S> to understand this atomistic calculation we look into an analytic model that relates @xmath17 in a si qd , with the rashba and dresselhaus soi@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> for @xmath5 along the [ 110 ] crystal orientation @xmath18}=-2\\frac{\\left| e \\right|\\left\\langle z \\right\\rangle } { \\mu_\\textup{b } \\hbar } { { \\alpha } _ { \\pm } } + 2\\frac{\\left| e \\right|\\left\\langle z \\right\\rangle } { \\mu_\\textup{b } \\hbar } { { \\beta } _ { \\pm } }    \\label{equ4}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here , @xmath19 is the electron charge and @xmath20 is the spread of the electron wavefunction along the vertical direction z ( [ 001 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> now , in a si qd , @xmath21@xcite , @xmath18}\\approx2\\frac{\\left| e \\right|\\left\\langle z \\right\\rangle } { \\mu_\\textup{b } \\hbar } { { \\beta } _ { \\pm } }    \\label{equ5}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    as previously discussed , @xmath10 has a different sign between the two sides of the step . </S>",
    "<S> when the location of the dot changes with respect to the step , the weighted average of the positive and negative @xmath10s change , which changes the g - factors .    </S>",
    "<S> figs . </S>",
    "<S> 1c and 1d show that the stark shift of the @xmath1-factors as a function of @xmath22 for both valley states are also affected by the presence of an interface step . </S>",
    "<S> the change in the @xmath1-factors with electric field @xmath23 can change in both sign and magnitude based on the location of the step with respect to the dot center . </S>",
    "<S> this behavior can also be explained from the change in the dresselhaus effect with an interface step and from equation [ equ5 ] . </S>",
    "<S> for example in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 1c , for @xmath24 -10 nm , the dot is completely on the left side of the step , where the @xmath3 valley state has positive @xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> thus an increase in @xmath25 with increasing @xmath22 increases the @xmath26 as well , hence a positive @xmath27 . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> when the dot is completely on the right side of the step , at @xmath24 10 nm , @xmath25 is negative . </S>",
    "<S> thus increasing @xmath22 increases @xmath28 but decreases @xmath26 and thus results in a negative @xmath27 . </S>",
    "<S> for -10 nm@xmath1610 nm , @xmath27 changes gradually with @xmath13 . </S>",
    "<S> we see a similar but opposite change for @xmath29 in fig .  1d .        </S>",
    "<S> [ fi3 ]    in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2 we show the schematic diagram of the devices measured experimentally and the observed variations in the @xmath1-factors and their stark shifts for two different samples . in sample </S>",
    "<S> a , we observe variations in one - electron ( @xmath3 ) and three - electron ( @xmath4 ) @xmath1-factors among three neighboring qds ( @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 ) , as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 2b . </S>",
    "<S> we could not achieve three - electron spin resonance for @xmath31 as it is strongly coupled to the other dots . </S>",
    "<S> fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 2c shows the stark shift of @xmath30 on sample a and one qd on sample b. we see here that the @xmath26 of @xmath30 has opposite dependence on @xmath22 compared to that of the qd in sample b. these observed variations in stark shifts and also in the @xmath1-factors qualitatively agree with the theoretically predicted variations shown in fig .  1 . thus we understand that these experimentally observed variations are due to different interface conditions associated with each of the qds .    </S>",
    "<S> we also observe variations in the measured @xmath12 times for both valley states of the three qds as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 3 . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath12 times shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 3f were extracted by performing ramsey experiments on all of the qubits in sample a , as shown in figs .  </S>",
    "<S> 3a - e .    </S>",
    "<S> the observed variations in @xmath12 can be explained from the measured ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 2c ) and predicted ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 1c , d ) variations in @xmath33 with interface steps . </S>",
    "<S> the larger the @xmath33 , the more sensitive the qubit is to charge noise . </S>",
    "<S> the dephasing time due to nuclear spin fluctuation is given in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . in absence of nuclear spin </S>",
    "<S> , we can relate @xmath12 times with charge noise in a similar way ,    @xmath34    here , @xmath35 is an effective fluctuation in the electric field seen by the dot due to charge noise and @xmath36 is the reduced planck constant . </S>",
    "<S> when we compare the @xmath12 times between the two valley states of @xmath30 , we see @xmath37 @xmath38 and from ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite we find , @xmath39 @xmath40 . </S>",
    "<S> this comparison also shows how @xmath41 almost linearly depends on @xmath33 as predicted by equation [ equ1 ] . </S>",
    "<S> thus variations in @xmath33 due to different interface conditions among different qubits will result in a variability in the dephasing time . </S>",
    "<S> adversely , the performance of a large scale quantum computer might be limited by the performance of the qubit that decoheres the fastest .    </S>",
    "<S> the calculations of fig .  1 and the experimental observations of figs .  2 and 3 bring forward the device - to - device variability issues that would require individual knowledge of each unique qubit and can impose a challenge to the implementation of a large scale quantum computer . </S>",
    "<S> any possible way of reducing the variability in @xmath17 , @xmath23 and @xmath12 is crucial to scale up the si qd spin qubits . </S>",
    "<S> also an increase in @xmath12 , regardless of the interface condition , will be a large step towards scalability . </S>",
    "<S> next we investigate ways to improve these issues .    one obvious way to suppress these variabilities and gain more control over the g - factors , their tunability and the dephasing times is to minimize interface roughness , which is a well known fabrication challenge . </S>",
    "<S> here we propose an alternate way to control these variabilities . </S>",
    "<S> as predicted in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , the @xmath1-factors in a si qd are anisotropic . </S>",
    "<S> we can study the anisotropy from a simplified expression@xcite ,    @xmath42    here , @xmath43 is the angle of the external magnetic field with the [ 100 ] crystal orientation . from equation [ equ2 ] </S>",
    "<S> we see that the contribution of the dresselhaus soi is anisotropic . </S>",
    "<S> thus by changing the direction of @xmath5 we can tune the dresselhaus contribution . for @xmath44 , the dresselhaus contribution will be negligible . </S>",
    "<S> for example , when @xmath5 is along [ 100 ] , @xmath45 and    @xmath46}\\approx-2\\frac{\\left| e \\right|\\left\\langle z \\right\\rangle } { \\mu_\\textup{b } \\hbar } { { \\alpha } _ { \\pm } }    \\label{equ3}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    comparing equation [ equ5 ] and [ equ2 ] we see that , @xmath47}}{\\delta g_{\\pm}^{[110]}}\\approx\\frac{{\\alpha } _ </S>",
    "<S> { \\pm } } { { \\beta } _ { \\pm } }    \\label{equ6}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] as the effect of the monoatomic steps are more dramatic on @xmath9 , the change in @xmath17 and @xmath23 with interface steps should be smaller for [ 100 ] compared to that for [ 110 ] . moreover , since @xmath48 @xcite , @xmath23 itself will be much smaller for [ 100 ] .        </S>",
    "<S> [ fi4 ]    in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 4 we show the changes in the @xmath1-factors with an interface step and electric field for @xmath5 along [ 100 ] . figs .  </S>",
    "<S> 4a and 4b show @xmath26 and @xmath29 respectively as a function of @xmath22 for different values of @xmath13 . </S>",
    "<S> it can be seen that the range of change with both @xmath22 and @xmath13 is much smaller compared to that in figs .  </S>",
    "<S> 1c and 1d , when @xmath5 is along [ 110 ] . in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 4c we compare the change in @xmath1-factors between [ 100 ] and [ 110 ] , with respect to @xmath13 for @xmath4928.5 mvm@xmath50 . </S>",
    "<S> though there are variations in @xmath26 and @xmath29 due to the change in the location of a dot from an interface step along [ 100 ] , as shown by the inset of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 4c , these variations are negligible compared to that along [ 110 ] . also @xmath23 is negligible , with a negligible variation with @xmath13 , along [ 100 ] compared to that along [ 110 ] as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 4d . </S>",
    "<S> such phenomenon is critical in a large scale quantum computer made of si qds . </S>",
    "<S> if the external magnetic field is along the [ 100 ] crystal orientation , all of the qubits will have negligible variations in @xmath17 and @xmath23 among them even with their varying interface conditions .    </S>",
    "<S> very small @xmath33 along [ 100 ] would result in very large @xmath12 times . from fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 4d , we calculated the average @xmath33 over different values of @xmath13 and find that , @xmath51\\right)|\\right)\\approx30 $ ] @xmath52\\right)|\\right)$ ] and @xmath53\\right)|\\right)\\approx50 $ ] @xmath54\\right)|\\right)$ ] . </S>",
    "<S> this large decrease in @xmath33 can significantly increase @xmath12 times . </S>",
    "<S> if a linear relationship between @xmath41 and @xmath33 holds as predicted by equation [ equ1 ] , the @xmath12 times can be larger than 1 ms , provided other noise sources do not contribute significantly . </S>",
    "<S> now , a decrease in @xmath33 might mean a reduced tunability of the @xmath1-factors which is necessary for selective addressing of individual qubits . </S>",
    "<S> but an increase in @xmath12 times will result in a narrower electron spin resonance ( esr ) linewidth , @xmath55@xcite , which would now require smaller difference in @xmath1-factors between qubits to individually address them . </S>",
    "<S> as the @xmath1-factors and @xmath23 have lesser variations with interface roughness along [ 100 ] , the @xmath1-factor difference between qubits can be more controlled . </S>",
    "<S> also a large enough @xmath12 time might allow for slower rabi oscillations and electric dipole spin resonance ( edsr ) might be achieved using just soi in a si qd , without the necessity of micro - magnets@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , by controlling the direction of the external magnetic field a desired trade off between large @xmath33 and large @xmath12 times can be achieved .    to conclude </S>",
    "<S> , we experimentally observe variations in the electron @xmath1-factors and their sensitivity to electric field , which also leads to variability in the dephasing times among si / sio@xmath0 qds . </S>",
    "<S> we identify that the source of the randomness is the presence of monoatomic steps at the interface . to gain control over these key qubit parameters one has to minimize interface roughness , which is challenging to achieve . </S>",
    "<S> we have shown here that even in the presence of interface steps we can control and minimize these variations by taking advantage of the anisotropic soi in a si qd . </S>",
    "<S> importantly , we can increase @xmath12 times if we align the external magnetic field along the [ 100 ] crystal orientation , rather than along [ 110 ] , where @xmath12 would be minimum . pointing the external b - field along [ 100 ] </S>",
    "<S> will also help to reduce the soi induced dephasing in si qd devices with integrated micro - magnets , as soi also contributes to the @xmath1-factors in these devices even in the presence of micro - magnets@xcite .    </S>",
