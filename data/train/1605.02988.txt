    "the state @xmath0 of a quantum system encodes all information that can be obtained on the system , namely the probabilities of all measurement outcomes are inferred from the quantum state .",
    "being a statistical concept , an a priori unknown quantum state can not be obtained from a single measurement , but can instead be reconstructed through measurements on an ensemble of identically prepared copies of the same state @xmath0 .",
    "such state reconstruction is known as quantum state estimation or quantum tomography .",
    "the problem of determining a state @xmath0 of the system from measurements on multiple copies goes back to fano  @xcite , who called _ quorum _ a set of observable sufficient to fully reconstruct the state . for a @xmath1-dimensional system ,",
    "the density matrix is determined by @xmath2 independent parameters  @xcite and therefore @xmath3 projective measurements are necessary to determine such parameters , since measuring one observable can give only @xmath3 parameters  @xcite . for @xmath4 we can reconstruct the state of a qubit from the polarization measurements along three coordinate axes @xmath5 , @xmath6 , and @xmath7 . for an electromagnetic field mode ,",
    "the quorum consists of a collection of quadrature operators measured through balanced homodyne detection , @xmath8 , with @xmath9 and @xmath10 position and momentum of the harmonic oscillator representing the field mode .",
    "since a quantum harmonic oscillator has infinite dimension , strictly speaking and infinite quorum is needed ( i.e. , infinite values of the continuous parameter @xmath11 ) , but a finite quorum is , under certain assumptions , in practice sufficient to reconstruct the density matrix  @xcite . in spite of the fact that quantum state tomography is an old problem  @xcite , interest in the field is still growing , mainly due to the development of quantum technologies for precision measurements , quantum communications , quantum cryptography , and quantum computing , all applications for which a reliable state determination is crucial .    in this paper , we propose a new method for the partial reconstruction of the state of a single mode of the electromagnetic field . as usual in quantum tomography , we suppose that we can prepare repeatedly the system in the same state and we wish to obtain information about such _ target state _ by means of the measurement of the expectation values of a suitable set of observables . our approach ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : stroboscopic ] for a schematic drawing ) is based on the _ coherent _ interaction of the field with a _ probe qubit _ ,",
    "supposed to be weak enough to be treated within the rotating wave approximation . assuming that we know the dynamics of the overall field plus qubit state , then we can use a _ stroboscopic _ approach .",
    "that is , from the measurements at different times of the qubit polarizations along three coordinate axes and from the fourier transform of the mean values of such measurements we can obtain partial information on the target field state . as we shall discuss in detail below , we can reconstruct the diagonal and the superdiagonal ( or equivalently the subdiagonal ) of the state .",
    "such information is in general sufficient for a full reconstruction in the case of pure states , since from the diagonal elements we can reconstruct the populations of the state and from the superdiagonal the relative phases .",
