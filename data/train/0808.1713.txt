    "a _ @xmath0-uniform hypergraph _ or _ @xmath0-graph _ @xmath4 consists of a vertex set @xmath5 and a set of edges each consisting of @xmath0 vertices",
    ". we will often identify @xmath4 with its edge set and write @xmath6 if @xmath7 is an edge of  @xmath4 . given a @xmath0-graph @xmath4",

    "the _ degree of @xmath11 _ is @xmath12 .",
    "the _ minimum degree _ of @xmath4 is the minimum size of such a neighbourhood , that is , @xmath13 .",
    "we say that a @xmath0-graph @xmath14 is a _ cycle of order @xmath1 _ if its vertices can be given a cyclic ordering @xmath15 so that every consecutive pair @xmath16 lies in an edge of @xmath14 and every edge of @xmath14 consists of @xmath0 consecutive vertices .",
    "a cycle of order @xmath1 is _ tight _ if every set of @xmath0 consecutive vertices forms an edge ; it is _ loose _ if every pair of adjacent edges intersects in a single vertex , with the possible exception of one pair of edges , which may intersect in more than one vertex .",
    "this final condition allows us to consider loose cycles whose order is not a multiple of @xmath8 .",
    "figure  [ fig : cycles ] shows the structure of each of these cycle types .",
    "a _ hamilton cycle _ in a @xmath0-graph @xmath4 is a sub-@xmath0-graph of @xmath4 which is a cycle containing every vertex of @xmath4 .",
    "rdl , ruciski and szemerdi  @xcite showed that for any @xmath17 there is an @xmath18 so that if @xmath19 then any @xmath0-graph @xmath4 on @xmath1 vertices with minimum degree @xmath20 contains a tight hamilton cycle ( this improved an earlier bound by katona and kierstead  @xcite ) .",
    "they gave a construction which shows that this result is best possible up to the error term @xmath21 .",

    "in fact , proposition  [ bestpos ] actually tells us more than this , namely that up to the error term , this minimum degree condition is best possible to ensure the existence of any ( not necessarily loose ) hamilton cycle in @xmath4 .",
    "this means that the minimum degree needed to find a hamilton cycle in a @xmath0-graph of order @xmath1 is @xmath25 .",
    "whilst finalizing this paper we learnt that hn and schacht  @xcite independently and simultaneously proved theorem  [ main ] , using a different approach .",
    "the result in  @xcite also covers the notion of a @xmath0-uniform @xmath26-cycle for @xmath27 ( here one requires consecutive edges to intersect in precisely @xmath26 vertices ) .",
    "more recently khn , mycroft and osthus  @xcite further developed the method of hn and schacht to include all @xmath26 such that @xmath28 ( the remaining values of @xmath26 are covered by the results of rdl , ruciski and szemerdi  @xcite ) .",

    "[ main ] we construct the loose hamilton cycle by finding several paths and joining them into a spanning cycle . here",
