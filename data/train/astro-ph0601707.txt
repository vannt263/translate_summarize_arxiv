    "recently , observations and theoretical considerations have linked long - duration grbs with ultra - bright type ib / c supernovae ( sne ; galama et al .",
    "1998 , 2000 ; bloom et al . 1999 ) .",
    "the first candidate was provided by sn 1998bw and grb 980425 , and the recent hete - ii burst grb 030329 has greatly enhanced the confidence in this association ( stanek et al .",
    "2003 ; hjorth et al .",
    "2003 ) . extremely high energy released in very short time scale suggests that grbs involve the formation of a black hole ( bh ) via a catastrophic stellar collapse event or possibly a neutron star merger , implying that an inner engine could be built on an accreting bh .    among a variety of mechanisms of powering grbs the blandford - znajek ( bz ) process ( blandford & znajek , 1977 ) has its unique advantage in providing `` clean '' ( free of baryonic contamination ) energy by extracting rotating energy from a bh and transferring it in the form of poynting flow in the outgoing energy flux ( lee et al . 2000 , hereafter lee00 ; li 2000c , hereafter li00 ) .    not long ago brown et al .",
    "( 2000 , hereafter b00 ) worked out a specific scenario for a grb - sn connection .",
    "they argued that the grb is powered by the bz process , and the sn is powered by the magnetic coupling ( mc ) process , which is regarded as one of the variants of the bz process ( blandford 1999 ; van putten 1999 ; li 2000b , 2002 ; wang , xiao & lei 2002 , hereafter w02 ) .",
    "it is shown in b00 that about @xmath0 are available to power both a grb and a sn . however , they failed to distinguish the fractions of the energy for these two objects .",
    "more recently , van putten and his collaborators ( van putten 2001 ; van putten & levinson 2003 , hereafter p03 ) worked out a poloidal topology for the open and closed magnetic field lines , in which the separatrix on the horizon is defined by a finite half - opening angle .",
    "the duration of a grb is set by the lifetime of the rapid spin of the bh .",
    "it is found that grbs and sne are powered by a small fraction of the bh spin energy .",
    "this result is consistent with observations , i.e. , duration of grbs of tens of seconds , true grb energies distributed around @xmath1 ( frail et al . 2001 ) , and aspherical sne kinetic energies of @xmath2 ( hoflich et al . 1999 ) .",
    "very recently , lei et al .",
    "( 2005 , hereafter lei05 ) proposed a scenario for grbs in type ib / c sne invoking the coexistence of the bz and mc processes . in lei05",
    "the grb is powered by the bz process , and the associated sn is powered by the mc process .",
    "the overall time scale of the grb is fitted by the duration of the open magnetic flux on the horizon .    besides the features of high energy released in very short durations most grbs are highly variable , showing very rapid variations in flux on a time scale much shorter than the overall duration of the burst .",
    "variability on a time scale of milliseconds has been observed in some long bursts ( norris et al .",
    "1996 ; mcbreen _ et al . _ , 2001 ; nakar and piran , 2002 ) .",
    "unfortunately , the origin of the variations in the fluxes of grbs remains unclear . in this paper",
    "we intend to discuss the mechanism for producing the variations in the fluxes of grbs by virtue of the screw instability in bh magnetosphere .",
    "it is well known that the magnetic field configurations with both poloidal and toroidal components can be screw - unstable . according to the kruskal - shafranov criterion",
    "the screw instability will occur , if the toroidal magnetic field becomes so strong that the magnetic field line turns around itself once or more ( kadomtsev 1966 ; bateman 1978 ) .",
    "some authors have addressed the screw instabilities in bh magnetosphere .",
    "gruzinov ( 1999 ) argued that the magnetic field with a bunch of closed field lines connecting a kerr bh with a disk can be screw - unstable , resulting in the release of magnetic energy with the flares at the disk .",
    "li ( 2000a ) discussed the screw instability of the magnetic field in the bz process , leading to a stringent upper bound to the bz power .",
    "wang et al . ( 2004 , hereafter w04 ) studied the screw instability in the mc process .",
    "they concluded that this instability could occur at some place away from the inner edge of the disk , provided that the bh spin @xmath3 and the power - law index @xmath4 for the variation of the magnetic field on the disk are greater than some critical values .",
    "in this paper we attempt to combine the screw instability of the magnetic field with the coexistence of the bz and mc processes . to facilitate the description",
    "henceforth we refer to the screw instability of the magnetic field occurring in the bz and mc processes as sibz and simc , respectively .",
    "it is shown that both sibz and simc can occur , provided that the following parameters are greater than some critical values : ( [ eq1 ] ) the bh spin , ( [ eq2 ] ) the power - law index describing the variation of the magnetic field at the disk , and ( [ eq3 ] ) the vertical height of the astrophysical load above the equatorial plane of the kerr bh .",
    "the features of several grb - sne are well fitted in our model .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) the overall duration of the grbs is fitted by the evolution of the half - opening angles .",
    "( [ eq2 ] ) the true energies of several grbs are fitted by the energy extracted in the bz process , and the energies of associated sne are fitted by the energy transferred in the mc process .",
    "( [ eq3 ] ) the variability time scales of tens of msec in the light curves of several grbs are fitted by two successive flares due to sibz .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in @xmath5 2",
    "we derived a criterion of sibz based on the kruskal - shafranov criterion and some simplified assumptions on the remote load . in @xmath5 3",
    "we discuss the time scale and energy extraction from a kerr bh in the context of the suspended accretion state . in @xmath5 4 we propose a scenario for the origin of the variation in the light curves of grbs based on the flares arising from sibz .",
    "finally , in @xmath5 5 , we summarize the main results and discuss some issues related to our model . throughout this paper the geometric units",
    "@xmath6 are used .",
    "in w04 the criterion of simc is derived based on the following points : ( [ eq1 ] ) the kruskal - shafranov criterion , ( [ eq2 ] ) the mapping relation between the angular coordinate on the bh horizon and the radial coordinate on the disk , and ( [ eq3 ] ) the calculations of the poloidal and toroidal components of the magnetic field at the disk .",
    "the criterion of sibz can be derived in an analogous way .",
    "however , the bz process involves unknown astrophysical loads , to which both the mapping relation and the calculations for the poloidal and toroidal components of the magnetic field are related . in order to work out an analytical model we present some simplified assumptions as follows .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) the magnetosphere anchored in a kerr bh and its surrounding disk is described in boyer - lindquist coordinates , in which the following kerr metric parameters are involved ( macdonald and thorne 1982 , hereafter mt82 ) .    @xmath7    ( [ eq2 ] ) the remote load is axisymmetric , being located evenly in a plane with some height above the disk . in figure 1 the open magnetic field lines connect the bh horizon with the load .",
    "the symbol @xmath8 and @xmath9 represent the critical field line and the height of the remote load above the equatorial plane for the occurrence of sibz , respectively .",
    "( [ eq3 ] ) in figure 1 the radius @xmath10 is the critical radius of simc , which is determined by the criterion of the screw instability given in w04 ,    @xmath11    in equation ( [ eq2 ] ) @xmath12 is the critical length of the poloidal field line for simc , and @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the poloidal and toroidal components of the magnetic field on the disk , respectively , and @xmath15 is the cylindrical radius on the disk and it reads    @xmath16    where @xmath17 is defined by novikov & thorne ( 1973 ) in terms of the radius of innermost stable circular orbit ( isco ) .",
    "( [ eq4 ] ) the angle @xmath18 in figure 1 is the half - opening angle of the magnetic flux tube on the horizon , which is related by the mapping relation between the angular coordinate on the bh horizon and the radial coordinate on the disk as follows ( wang et al . , 2003 , hereafter w03 ) ,",
    "@xmath19    where    @xmath20    in equations ( [ eq4 ] ) and ( [ eq5 ] ) @xmath21 is defined as a radial parameter in terms of @xmath22 , and @xmath4 is a power - law index for the variation of the poloidal magnetic field at the disk , i.e. ,    @xmath23    ( [ eq5 ] ) the suspended accretion state is assumed due to the transfer of angular momentum from the bh to the disk ( van putten & ostriker , 2001 ) .",
    "analogous to equation ( [ eq2 ] ) the criterion for sibz can be expressed as    @xmath24    where @xmath8 is the critical length of the poloidal field line for sibz , and @xmath25 and @xmath26 are the poloidal and toroidal components of the magnetic field on the remote load , respectively , and @xmath27 is the cylindrical radius of the remote load with respect to the symmetric axis of the bh .",
    "the toroidal field component @xmath26 can be expressed by ampere s law ,    @xmath28    where @xmath29 is the electric current flowing in the loop @xmath30 in figure 1 and it reads    @xmath31    the quantities @xmath32 and @xmath33 in equation ( [ eq9 ] ) are the bz power and the load resistance , respectively . the bz power has been derived in w02 as follows ,    @xmath34    where @xmath35 is a parameter depending on the bh spin , and @xmath36 is the ratio of the angular velocity of the field lines to that of the bh horizon . the quantity @xmath37 is defined by    @xmath38    where @xmath39 represents the magnetic field at the bh horizon in terms of @xmath40 .",
    "mt82 argued in a speculative way that the ratio @xmath41 will be regulated to about 0.5 by the bz process itself , which corresponds to the optimal bz power with the impedance matching .",
    "taking the impedance matching into account , we have the remote load resistance equal to the horizon resistance , and they read    @xmath42    where @xmath43 is the surface resistivity of the bh horizon ( mt82 ) .",
    "thus we have @xmath33 and @xmath44 expressed as    @xmath45    incorporating equations ( [ eq8])([eq13 ] ) , we can calculate @xmath26 in terms of the cylindrical radius @xmath27 .",
    "on the other hand , the poloidal magnetic field @xmath46 at the radius @xmath27 of the load can be determined by the conservation of the magnetic flux , i.e. ,    @xmath47    from equation ( [ eq14 ] ) we have    @xmath48    assuming that the height of the planar load above the equatorial plane of the kerr bh is@xmath49 , we have an approximate relation between the angle @xmath50 and the radius @xmath27 as follows ,    @xmath51    substituting equation ( [ eq16 ] ) into equation ( [ eq15 ] ) , we have    @xmath52    incorporating equations ( [ eq8 ] ) and ( [ eq17 ] ) with the criterion ( [ eq7 ] ) , we have    @xmath53    where the relation @xmath54 is used . the criterion ( [ eq18 ] )",
    "implies that sibz will occur , provided that the height of the load is greater than the critical height , i.e. , @xmath55 , and we have    @xmath56    as argued in w04 the angle @xmath18 can be determined by the criterion of simc with the mapping relation between the bh horizon and the disk , and it is a function of the bh spin @xmath3 and the power - law index @xmath4 , i.e. , @xmath57 . inspecting equations ( [ eq1 ] ) , ( [ eq10 ] ) and ( [ eq19 ] )",
    ", we find that @xmath58 is a dimensionless parameter also depending on the parameters @xmath3 and @xmath4 , i.e. , @xmath59 . by using equations ( [ eq2 ] ) and ( [ eq19 ] )",
    "we have the contours of @xmath57 and @xmath60 in @xmath61 parameter space as shown in figure 2 .",
    "inspecting figure 2 , we find the following features of the contours :    ( [ eq1 ] ) the values of @xmath18 increases and those of @xmath58 decreases with the increasing @xmath4 for the given bh spin @xmath3 , respectively .",
    "( [ eq2 ] ) the values of @xmath18 increases and those of @xmath58 decreases with the increasing @xmath3 for the given @xmath4 , respectively .",
    "( [ eq3 ] ) both simc and sibz will occur , provided that the parameters @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath58 are greater than some critical values . as shown in figure 2c the shaded region indicates the value ranges of @xmath3 and @xmath4 in which both @xmath62 and @xmath63 are constrained .",
    "thus the occurrence of simc and sibz is guaranteed by the value ranges of @xmath3 and @xmath4 in the shaded region .",
    "there are several scenarios to invoke the bz process for powering grbs , and the main differences among these scenarios lie in the environment of a spinning bh and the approaches to the duration of a grb .",
    "these scenarios are outlined as follows .",
    "* model i * : in lee00 the energy is extracted magnetically from a rotating bh without disk , and the duration of a grb is estimated as the time for extracting all rotational energy of the central bh via the bz process .    * model ii * : it is argued that the energy is extracted magnetically from a rotating bh with a transient disk , and the duration of a grb is estimated as the time for the disk plunged into the bh ( lee & kim 2002 ; wang et al .",
    "2002 ) .",
    "* model iii * : in li00 the energy is extracted magnetically from a rotating bh with a stationary torus in the state of suspended accretion , and the duration of a grb is estimated roughly as the time for extracting all rotational energy of the central bh via the bz process .    * model iv *",
    ": in b00 the energy is extracted magnetically from a rotating bh with a non - stationary disk in the state of suspended accretion , and the duration of a grb is determined by the presence of the disk .",
    "* model v * : in p03 the energy is extracted magnetically from a rotating bh with a torus in the state of suspended accretion , and the duration of a grb is determined by the instability of the disk .",
    "* model vi * : in lei05 the energy is extracted magnetically from a rotating bh with a thin disk in the state of suspended accretion , and the duration of a grb is determined by the lifetime of the half - opening angle .    *",
    "this model : * it is a modified version of model vi , in which the effects of simc and sibz are taken into account . compared with model vi some features and advantages",
    "are given as follows .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) the magnetic field configuration in model vi is built based on the conservation of the closed magnetic flux connecting the bh with the disk with the precedence over the open magnetic flux , resulting in the closed field lines connecting the half - open angle @xmath64 at horizon with the disk extending to infinity . in this model , however , the closed field lines are confined by simc within a region of a limited radius @xmath10 ( about a few schwarzschild radii as shown in table 4 ) , which is consistent with the collapsar model for grbs - sne .",
    "( [ eq2 ] ) as argued in the next section , the variability time scales of the light curves of grbs are modulated by two successive flares due to sibz .",
    "the main features of the above models for grbs are summarized in table 1 .    in model",
    "vi the duration of a grb is regarded as the lifetime of the half - opening angle @xmath64 , which is based on the evolution of the rotating bh .",
    "the same procedure can be applied to this model except that the angle @xmath64 is replaced by @xmath18 arising from simc .",
    "it is found that the characteristics of the bh evolution in this model are almost the same as given in model vi as shown by @xmath61 parameter spaces in figure 3 .    for several grb - sne",
    ", the observed energy @xmath65 and duration @xmath66 can be fitted by adjusting the parameters @xmath4 and @xmath67 .",
    "the energy @xmath68 can be predicted as shown in table 2 , where the values of @xmath4 , @xmath39 and @xmath68 fitted to five grbs invoking model vi and this model are shown in the left and right sub - columns , respectively .",
    "the fractions of extracting energy from a rotating bh via the bz and mc processes are defined respectively as @xmath69 and @xmath70 , and they read    @xmath71    where @xmath72 and @xmath73 are the energies extracting in the bz and mc processes , respectively .",
    "@xmath74    in equation ( [ eq21 ] ) @xmath75 is defined as the lifetime of the angle @xmath18 , which can be calculated by the same procedure given in lei05 . * * the mc power in equation ( [ eq21 ] ) is expressed as ( w04 )    @xmath76    where the parameter @xmath77 is the ratio of the angular velocity of the magnetic field lines to that of the bh .",
    "in model vi the bh spin @xmath78 corresponds to the time when the half - opening angle @xmath79 , and the bz power @xmath80 , while @xmath81 corresponds to the mc power @xmath82 . in this model @xmath78 and",
    "@xmath81 have the same meanings as given in model vi except that @xmath83 is replaced by @xmath18 .    as shown in table 3 ,",
    "the values of @xmath78 , @xmath69 and @xmath70 fitted to five grbs invoking model vi and this model are shown in the left and right sub - columns , respectively .    inspecting the data in the left and right sub - columns in table 2 and table 3 , we find that @xmath69 and @xmath70 in this model are greater and less than the counterparts in model vi , respectively .",
    "this result arises from the effects of simc and sibz : the half - opening angle @xmath18 in this model is greater than the half - opening angle @xmath64 in model vi as argued in w04 .",
    "as is well known , the bursts are divided into long and short bursts according to their @xmath84 .",
    "most grbs are highly variable , showing 100% variations in flux on a time scale much shorter than the overall duration of the burst .",
    "the bursts seem to be composed of individual pulses , with a pulse being the `` building block '' of the overall light curve .",
    "the variability time scale @xmath85is much shorter than the grbs duration @xmath84 , the former is more than a factor of 10@xmath86 smaller than the latter ( piran , 2004 ) .",
    "however , the origin of the variability in the light curves of grbs remains unclear .    in this paper , we combine the variability with the screw instability of the magnetic field in the bh magnetosphere , and suggest that the variability could be fitted by a series of flares arising from sibz , which accompanies the release of the energy of the toroidal magnetic field .",
    "an equivalent circuit @xmath87 for sibz is shown in figure 4a , which consisting of two adjacent magnetic surfaces @xmath88 and",
    "@xmath89 connecting the bh horizon and the remote load . an inductor is introduced in the equivalent circuit by considering that the toroidal magnetic field threads the loop @xmath87 , and the inductor is represented by the symbol @xmath90 in figure 4a .",
    "the inductance @xmath90 in the circuit is defined by    @xmath91    where @xmath29 is given by equation ( [ eq9 ] ) , and @xmath92 is the flux of the toroidal magnetic field threading the circuit .",
    "the flux @xmath93 can be integrated over the loop @xmath87 as follows ,    @xmath94    where the toroidal magnetic field measured by `` zero - angular - momentum observers '' is    @xmath95    where @xmath96 is the lapse function defined in equation ( [ eq1 ] ) ( mt82 ) .    since the geometric shapes of the magnetic surfaces are unknown , we assume that the surfaces are formed by rotating the two radial segments @xmath88 and @xmath89 , which span the angle @xmath97 as shown in figure 4b . thus the flux @xmath93 can be calculated easily by integrating over the region @xmath87 . incorporating equations ( [ eq23])([eq25 ] ) ,",
    "we obtain @xmath90as follows .    @xmath98    where @xmath99 is defined as @xmath100 .    although the detailed process of sibz is still unclear , we suggest that the energy release in one event of sibz is roughly divided into two stages : the processes for releasing and retrieving magnetic energy , respectively .",
    "the two processes can be simulated as the corresponding processes in the equivalent@xmath101circuit .",
    "the detailed analysis is given as follows .",
    "at the first stage the energy of the toroidal magnetic field is released as soon as sibz occurs , being dissipated on the load and plasma fluid in the way analogous to a discharging process in an equivalent @xmath102 circuit .",
    "the equation governing the discharging process in @xmath102 circuit is    @xmath103    where @xmath104 is the resistance of the plasma fluid in the bh magnetosphere .    at the second stage",
    "the energy of toroidal magnetic field is recovered due to the rotation of the bh , and the process for retrieving magnetic energy is modulated by a charging process in an equivalent @xmath102 circuit .",
    "the equation governing the charging process in @xmath102 circuit is    @xmath105    in equations ( [ eq27 ] ) and ( [ eq28 ] ) @xmath90 is the inductance in the circuit @xmath87 , and @xmath104 is the resistance of the plasma in the bh magnetosphere .",
    "incorporating equations ( [ eq12 ] ) and ( [ eq26 ] ) , we have    @xmath106    combining the initial conditions in the first and second stages , we have the solutions of equations ( [ eq27 ] ) and ( [ eq28 ] ) as follows ,    @xmath107    @xmath108    in equations ( [ eq30 ] ) and ( [ eq31 ] ) @xmath109 and @xmath110 are the initial and steady currents , respectively , while @xmath111 and @xmath112 represent the discharging and charging currents , respectively .",
    "the characteristic time scales in equations ( [ eq30 ] ) and ( [ eq31 ] ) are given respectively by @xmath113 and @xmath114 , and they read    @xmath115    @xmath116    from equations ( [ eq32 ] ) and ( [ eq33 ] ) we have the ratio of @xmath113 to @xmath114 given by    @xmath117    where @xmath118 is used in deriving equation ( [ eq34 ] ) .",
    "in contrast to disk plasma of perfect conductivity , the resistance @xmath104 can not be neglected based on the following considerations :    ( [ eq1 ] ) the plasma fluid becomes very tenuous after leaving the inner edge of the disk , augmenting significantly the resistance due to an increasing radial velocity onto the bh ;    ( [ eq2 ] ) the conductivity of the plasma fluid is highly anisotropic , i.e. , the conductivity in the cross - field direction is greatly impeded by the presence of the strong magnetic threading the bh ( punsly 2001 ) .",
    "although the value of @xmath104 is unknown , we can estimate roughly the variability time scales of grbs by combining equation ( [ eq34 ] ) with different cases given as follows .    * case i : * @xmath119 leads to @xmath120 , and the time scale of two successive flares arising from sibz is dominated by @xmath114 .",
    "* case ii : * @xmath121 leads to @xmath122 , and the time scale of two successive flares arising from sibz is about @xmath123 .    * case iii : * @xmath124 leads to @xmath125 , and the time scale of two successive flares arising from sibz is about @xmath126 .",
    "therefore the variability time scales are insensitive to the values of the unknown @xmath104 . from equation ( [ eq31 ] ) we obtain that the charging current attains 99.3% of @xmath110 in the relax time @xmath127 , implying the recovery of the toroidal magnetic field , and the variability time scales of grbs can be estimated as follows ,    @xmath128    @xmath129    @xmath130    in * case i * we have @xmath131 , implying that the magnetic energy is released much more rapidly in the first stage compared with the time for the recovery of the magnetic energy in the second stage",
    ". thus * case i * seems more consistent with the feature of the light curves , i.e. , an individual pulse is a fast - rise exponential decay ( fred ) with an average rise - to - decay ratio of 1:3 ( norris et al .",
    "1996 ) .",
    "by using equations ( [ eq29 ] ) , ( [ eq33 ] ) and ( 35)(37 ) we have the variability time scales in the light curves of four grbs in the three different cases as shown in table 4 .",
    "in addition , we obtain the curves of @xmath132 versus @xmath3 with the fixed values of @xmath4 for grb 990712 , grb 991208 and grb 021216 as shown in figure 5 .    inspecting table 4 , we find that the variability time scales of tens of msec in the light curves of grbs can be modulated by the two successive flares due to sibz , which accompany the bz process in powering the grbs .",
    "we also find that the variability time scales of the four grbs are generally three order of magnitude less than the corresponding durations @xmath66 , which are consistent with the observations .    from figure 5",
    "we find that the curves of @xmath133 versus @xmath3 are almost the same , increasing linearly in a rather small slope with the decreasing @xmath3 .",
    "the values of @xmath132 remains less than 20 msec during the occurrence of sibz for these grbs .",
    "in this paper we discuss the possibility of the modulations of sibz on the light curves of grbs .",
    "one of the puzzles is what mechanism leads to the recurrent occurrence of sibz , and prevents the magnetic field from settling to a screw - stable configuration .    as argued in mt82",
    "the bh magnetosphere consists of a series of magnetic surfaces connecting the horizon with the loads , and the total electric current @xmath134 flowing downward through an * _ m_*-loop is proportional to the toroidal magnetic field @xmath135 by ampere s law .",
    "it is argued that these magnetic surfaces can be regarded as an equivalent circuit , in which each loop consists of two adjacent magnetic surfaces ( w02 ) .",
    "the total electric current flowing downward through an * _ m_*-loop is exactly equal to the algebraic sum of the poloidal currents flowing in the loops ( w03 ) .    as shown in figure 1 the critical magnetic surface ( henceforth cms ) for sibz",
    "is represented by the critical line @xmath88 . according to the criterion ( [ eq7 ] ) only the toroidal magnetic field outside cms",
    "is depressed by sibz , while the toroidal and poloidal components of the magnetic field within cms are little affected . on the other hand ,",
    "the poloidal magnetic field outside cms still exists in spite of the occurrence of sibz , and the toroidal magnetic field outside cms will be recovered because of the twist of the poloidal magnetic field arising from the rotation of the bh .",
    "so , the rotation of the bh is the main mechanism for the recurrent occurrence of sibz in the bh magnetosphere .",
    "[ [ rotation - period - of - bh - and - time - scales - of - recovery - of - toroidal - magnetic - fields ] ] rotation period of bh and time scales of recovery of toroidal magnetic fields ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~    if we take bh mass as 10@xmath136 , the rotation period of the bh is only @xmath1371msec for the bh spin required by the criterion of sibz .",
    "this result implies that toroidal magnetic fields can not be recovered in one period of a rotating bh . how to explain the discrepancy between bh rotation and the time scales required for recovery of toroidal fields ?    in spite of lack of detailed knowledge of the screw instability , it is helpful to imagine the magnetic field line as an elastic string .",
    "the rotating bh always twists the field line , while the field line tries to untwist itself .",
    "once the toroidal component of the magnetic field is strong enough to satisfy the criterion , the screw instability will occurs , just as a twisted elastic string releases its energy under appropriate conditions . in our model",
    "we simulate the process for twisting the field line by a transient process for accumulating magnetic energy in the inductor @xmath90 in the equivalent @xmath102 circuit , which corresponds to the increase of the toroidal magnetic field , and the variability time scales of tens of msec in the light curves of several grbs are fitted as the time interval between two successive flares due to sibz .",
    "thus the threshold of toroidal magnetic field ( magnetic energy ) can not be recovered in only one rotation of bh , just as a threshold of twisting more than one turn is required for an elastic string to release its energy .",
    "recently , much attention has been paid to the issue of x - ray flashes ( xrfs ) , x - ray - rich gamma - ray bursts ( xrrs ) and grbs , since hete-2 provided strong evidence that the properties of these three kinds of bursts form a continuum , and therefore these objects are probably the same phenomenon ( lamb et al .",

    "the observations from hete-2 motivate some authors to seek a unified model of these bursts .",
    "the most competitive unified models of these bursts are off - axis jet model ( yamazaki , ioka , & nakamura 2002 ; lamb et al .",
    "2005 ) and two - component jet model ( berger et al .",
    "2003 ; huang et al . 2004 ) , in which xrfs , xrrs and grbs arise from the differences in the viewing angles .",
    "unfortunately , a detailed discussion on producing different viewing angles for xrfs , xrrs and grbs has not been given in the above works .",
    "our argument on sibz and simc may be helpful to understanding this issue .",
    "it is believed that a disk is probably surrounded by a high - temperature corona analogous to the solar corona ( liang & price 1977 ; haardt 1991 ; zhang et al 2000 ) .",
    "very recently , some authors argued that the coronal heating in some stars including the sun is probably related to dissipation of currents , and very strong x - ray emissions arise from variation of magnetic fields ( galsgaard & parnell 2004 ; peter et al .",
    "analogously , if the corona exists above the disk in our model , we expect that it might be heated by the induced currents due to simc and sibz .",
    "therefore a very strong x - ray emission would be produced to form xrfs or xrrs .",
    "although our model may be too simplified and idealized with respect to the real situation , it provides a possible scenario for the occurrence of the screw instability in bh magnetosphere , and it may be helpful to understanding some astrophysical observations .",
    "we hope to improve our model by combining more observations in the future .",
