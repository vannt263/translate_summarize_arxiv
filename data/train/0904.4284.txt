    "as is well known , impurities which trap electrons ( _ donors _ ) and holes ( _ acceptors _ ) are essential for exploiting semiconductors in solid state electronics and optical sensors . in the context of the physics of semiconductors , donors and acceptors are noteworthy for the manner in which the nature of the bound and continuum states of the charge carriers bound to them arise , on the one hand , and the band extrema with which they are associated , on the other .",
    "bound and continuum states of donors and acceptors have been studied intensively exploiting absorption , emission , and photoconductivity spectra .",
    "the focus in the present work is on acceptors in ii - vi semiconductors .",
    "consider a substitutional group ib element replacing a group iib cation [ e.g. , cu@xmath2 replacing zn@xmath3 in znte ( i.e. , cu@xmath4 ) ] in a ii - vi semiconductor .",
    "it borrows an electron from the valence band and creates a hole in order to complete the tetrahedral bonds with the nearest neighbor group vi anions of the host . at sufficiently low temperatures ,",
    "the hole is bound to the impurity ion via a screened coulomb attraction .",
    "the bound states of the hole are shown schematically in fig .",
    "the binding energy of this solid state analog of the hydrogen atom is very small compared to that of atomic hydrogen as a consequence of the large dielectric constant of the host semiconductor and the small effective mass of the bound hole . in the effective mass theory ( emt )  @xcite , including spin - orbit effects , these states are associated with the @xmath5 and @xmath6 valence band maxima located at the zone center .",
    "the wave function of the bound states are products of hydrogenic envelope functions and bloch functions characteristic of the valence band maxima .",
    "consistent with the @xmath7 symmetry of the substitutional acceptor , the bound states are characterized by @xmath8 , @xmath9 , or @xmath10 symmetry .",
    "the @xmath11 and @xmath12 ground states have @xmath10 and @xmath9 symmetry , respectively .",
    "the binding energies of the @xmath13-like and @xmath1-like states are determined by the effective mass parameters , or equivalently by the luttinger parameters  @xcite , and the dielectric constant of the host .",
    "in addition , the bound states might experience shifts originating in the departures from emt due to the so called central cell  corrections  @xcite . at low temperatures , the electric - dipole allowed transitions from the @xmath14 to the excited @xmath1-states , i.e. , the lyman lines can be observed .",
    "the ii - vi semiconductors usually prefer one type over the other , for example , znte is known to be p - type  @xcite .",
    "apart from the non - stoichiometric nature of these crystals which results in vacancies and interstitials , there are some major residual impurities dominating the crystal properties .",
    "it is of particular interest to obtain the detailed information on the electronic behavior of these impurities .",
    "it has been established that cu and ag are two common residual impurities in znte and cdte , which control the electrical and optical properties of these materials  @xcite .",
    "previous studies were performed on samples in which the impurities were introduced after growth by thermal diffusion  @xcite . while these impurities appear in as - grown znte and cdte crystals , studies on crystals with impurities introduced during growth are needed .",
    "the observation and discussion of the lyman spectra of cu , ag , and au acceptors in znte and cdte along with their phonon replicas is the subject of the present study . in the course of the investigation , a fascinating phenomenon called fano resonance  was observed in their lyman spectra . they are discussed in terms of parameters associated with the coupling of the discrete bound states of the acceptor as lo - phonon assisted replicas overlapping the continuum states .",
    "single crystals of znte and cdte were grown by vertical bridgman technique using a two - zone furnace with a linear temperature gradient of 5 @xmath15c / cm in the growth zone .",
    "@xcite cu , ag and au impurities were introduced by adding corresponding ingredient into the starting materials .",
    "the absorption spectra were recorded using an ultrahigh resolution bomem da.3 fourier transform infrared ( ftir ) spectrometer  @xcite capable of an ultimate unapodized resolution of 0.0026 @xmath16 .",
    "a hgcdte - infrared detector cooled with liquid nitrogen were employed . a janis 10dt supervaritemp  @xcite optical cryostat , with polypropylene windows along one axis and wedged znse inner and csi outer windows along the other axis , allowed measurements in the range of 1.8 - 300 k. the specimens were prepared for infrared absorption measurements by suitably polishing two approximately plane parallel surfaces , with a small wedge introduced to avoid channelling in the spectrum .",
    "the absorption spectrum of znte doped with cu recorded at temperature , @xmath17 k , is displayed in fig .",
    "the sharp excitation lines of the cu acceptors in the range 120 - 150 mev are due to the lyman transitions from the @xmath18 ground state to the @xmath19 ( @xmath20 ) excited states .",
    "they are followed by a photoionization continuum with its onset @xmath21 mev , representing transitions from the ground state of cu acceptor to the",
    "_ _ p__@xmath22 valence band of znte .",
    "the lines , superposed on the continuum , are interpreted as the lyman excitations in combination with one , two , three , and four quanta of the zone center longitudinal optical phonon ( lo ) of the znte host , starting at 158.6 , 184.52 , 209.98 , and 234.52 mev for the @xmath23 transition , respectively .",
    "the polar character of znte clearly singles out the special role of the lo phonon and its overtones , the microscopic mechanism for the coupling being the frhlich interaction  @xcite .",
    "the positions of the observed excitation lines along with the values reported by saminadayar _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite are listed in table  [ tab : znte1 ] .",
    "the absorption due to the photoionization continuum increases with photon energy initially , reaching a maximum @xmath24 mev and followed by a monotonic decrease .",
    "the physical process underlying the photoionization involves a product of the oscillator strength for the transitions from the @xmath0 initial state to final states in the heavy hole and light hole @xmath25 valence bands and their density of states .    in a similar fashion , fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] shows the absorption spectrum of znte doped with ag recorded at @xmath17 k. the lyman spectrum arising from the @xmath26 transitions for the ag acceptors are observed in the range 90 - 120 mev .",
    "the photoionization continuum starting at @xmath27 mev increases to a maxima at @xmath24 mev and then slowly decreases . as in the case of the cu acceptors ,",
    "the phonon replicas are observed up to the fourth overtone of the zone center lo phonon with onsets at 131.99 , 158.08 , 184.34 , and 209.52 mev for the @xmath23 transition .",

    "the present study is focused on the lyman spectra of group ib acceptors ( cu , ag , and au ) , substitutionally incorporated in znte and cdte by replacing the cations .",
    "the sharpness of the lyman transitions observed at the cryogenic temperatures indicates that wavefunctions of the acceptor - bound holes do not overlap .",
    "the cu and ag acceptors in both znte and cdte yielded sharp and intense transitions terminating at excited states preceding the photoionization threshold .",
    "the onset of the photoionization is in excellent agreement with the sum of the transition energy and the binding energy of its final state calculated in the emt  @xcite .    as in the cases of chalcogens in si  @xcite and 3d transition metal ions in iii - v semiconductors  @xcite ,",
    "the group ib impurities enter ii - vi semiconductors as deep defect centers .",
    "the emt can be used to determine the shallow states of these defects ( @xmath1-like states ) where the electron is bound to the defect by a screened coulomb potential , which give rise to a hydrogen - like energy spectrum . as can be seen in tables  [ tab : znte2 ] and  [ tab : cdte2 ] ,",
    "the binding energies for the same @xmath1-like states of cu , ag , and au are all very close to their theoretical values",
    ". however , the emt breaks down when the electron wave function has a non - negligible amplitude ( @xmath13-like states ) in the central cell region where it is affected by the short - range impurity potential , not accounted for in emt , and the difference between the experimental and theoretical values can be more than four times ( e.g. , in case of au acceptors in znte ) .",
    "the fano resonance interaction in semiconductors is one of the most interesting example of electron - phonon interactions  @xcite .",
    "the strong ionicity of the ii - vi semiconductors clearly favors this type of interaction ; up to fourth overtone of the fano replicas were observed in both znte and cdte as compared to three overtones in iii - vs  @xcite and one in si and ge  @xcite .",
    "the strength of the coupling between the discrete state and the photoionization continuum as reflected in the parameter @xmath28 is also considerably larger for the ii - vis than those for the iii - vs and si and ge .",
    "the group v elements enter the ii - vi semiconductors by replacing the ions and act as acceptors , for example , as replaces te in znte  @xcite .",
    "it is of great interest to explore the lyman series of these acceptors as well as their fano replicas . in their study",
    ", infrared absorption spectroscopy along with raman spectroscopy and photoluminescence would provide a more complete and accurate picture for the electronic and optical properties of these defects .",
