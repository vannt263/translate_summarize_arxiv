    "the study about scalar meson is an interesting topic for both theory and experiment . in order to uncover their mysterious structure ,",
    "intensive studies have been done for the b meson decays involving a scalar meson as one of the two final state mesons . such kind of decays have been studied by employing various factorization approaches , such as the generalized factorization approach @xcite , the qcd factorization ( qcdf ) approach @xcite , the perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) approach @xcite , and by using the qcd sum rule @xcite .    on the experimental side , from the first scalar meson @xmath9 observed in the decay mode @xmath10 by belle @xcite , and confirmed by babar @xcite later ,",
    "then many channels involving a scalar in the final state have been measured by belle @xcite and babar @xcite .",
    "for example , the decays @xmath11 were searched by barbar five years ago @xcite , especially the decay @xmath12 , which has been considered as a best candidate to distinguish the nature of the scalar @xmath2 @xcite . the authors of ref.@xcite argued that if the branching ratio of this channel can be measured accurately by the experiment , one can separate the four- and two - quark assignments , because the results of these two assignments have a difference of one order of magnitude .",
    "so in the past three years , barbar have given this channel twice measurements @xcite and get two almost identical upper limits .",
    "for our considered decays , only the experimental upper limits are available now for some of them @xcite : br(|b^0a^+_0(980)^- ) < 3.110 ^ -6,br(b^-a^-_0(980)^0 ) < 1.410 ^ -6 , br(b^-a^0_0(980)^- ) < 5.810 ^ -6 .    in this paper , we will study the branching ratios and cp asymmetries of @xmath13 and @xmath14 within perturbative qcd approach based on @xmath15 factorization . in the following",
    ", we use @xmath16 to denote @xmath2 in some places for convenience .",
    "it is organized as follows . in sect.[proper ] , the status of the study on the physical properties of @xmath16 , the relevant decay constants and light - cone distribution amplitudes are discussed . in sec.[results ] , we then analysis these decay channels using the pqcd approach . the numerical results and the discussions",
    "are given in the section [ numer ] .",
    "the conclusions are presented in the final part .",
    "many scalar mesons below 2gev have been found in experiments . we cannt accommodate these scalar mensons into one nonet , but need at least two nonets below and above 1 gev@xcite . among them , the scalar mesons below 1 gev , including @xmath17 and @xmath2 , are usually viewed to form an su(3 ) nonet ; while scalar mseons above 1 gev , including @xmath18 and @xmath19 form the other su(3 ) nonet .",
    "there are several different scenarios to describe these mesons in the quark model @xcite .",
    "for example @xmath2 meson , which has been suggested as @xmath20 lowest lying state @xcite(called scenario i ) or four - quark bound state @xcite(called scenario ii ) . in the scenario",
    "i , the former su(3 ) nonet mesons are treated as the @xmath20 ground stats , and the latter nonet ones are the first excited states ; in the scenario ii , the former nonet mesons are viewed as four - quark bound states , while the latter nonet ones are @xmath20 ground states .",
    "some people also consider that it is not made of one simple component but might have a more complex nature such as having a @xmath21 component@xcite , even the superpositions of the two- and four- quark states . in order to make quantitative predictions , we identify @xmath2 as the two - quark state in the calculation .    in 2-quark model , the decay constants for scalar meson @xmath16 are defined by : a_0(p)||q_2_q_1|0&=&f_a_0p _ , a_0(p)||q_2 q_1|0=m_a_0|f_a_0 . for the neutral scalar meson @xmath16",
    "can not be produced via the vector current ( restricted by the charge conjugation invariance or the g parity conservation ) , the vector decay constant @xmath22 .",
    "as to the charged scalar mesons @xmath23 , from the equation of motion : _ a_0 ^ -f_a_0 ^ -=|f_a_0 ^ - , _",
    "a_0 ^ -= , its vector decay constant is proportional to the mass difference between the constituent @xmath24 and @xmath25 quarks .",
    "it is easy to see the vector decay constant is very small , and will equal to zero in the su(3 ) limit .",
    "so we only need consider the scalar decay constant @xmath26 , which is scale dependent .",
    "fixing the scale at 1 gev , the value is @xmath27mev , which is calculated in qcd sum rules@xcite .",
    "the light - cone distribution amplitudes ( lcdas ) for the scalar meson @xmath16 can be written as : a_0(p)||q_1(z)_l q_2(0)_j|0&=&^1_0dx e^ixpz & & \\ { p___a_0(x ) + m_a_0^s_a_0(x)+m_a_0(n__+n___1)^t_a_0(x)}_jl,[lcda ] where @xmath28 and @xmath29 are light - like vectors : @xmath30 , and @xmath28 is parallel with the moving direction of the scalar meson @xmath16 .",
    "the normalization can be related to the decay constants : ^1_0 dx_a_0(x)=^1_0 dx^t_a_0(x)=0,^1_0 dx^s_a_0(x)=. the twist-2 lcda can be expanded in the gegenbauer polynomials : _",

    "under the two - quark model for the scalar meson @xmath16 supposition , we would like to use pqcd approach to study b decays into @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "the decay amplitude can be conceptually written as the convolution , ( b a_0)~ d^4k_1 d^4k_2 d^4k_3   , [ eq : con1 ] where @xmath37 s are momenta of light quarks included in each mesons , and @xmath38 denotes the trace over dirac and color indices .",
    "@xmath39 is the wilson coefficient which results from the radiative corrections at short distance . in the above convolution",
    ", @xmath39 includes the harder dynamics at larger scale than @xmath40 scale and describes the evolution of local @xmath41-fermi operators from @xmath42 ( the @xmath43 boson mass ) down to @xmath44 scale , where @xmath45 .",
    "the function @xmath46 describes the four quark operator and the spectator quark connected by a hard gluon whose @xmath47 is in the order of @xmath48 , and includes the @xmath49 hard dynamics .",

    "the function @xmath51 are the wave functions of @xmath36 and @xmath16 , respectively .",
    "since the b quark is rather heavy we consider the @xmath52 meson at rest for simplicity .",
    "it is convenient to use light - cone coordinate @xmath53 to describe the meson s momenta , p^= ( p^0 p^3 ) , _ t = ( p^1 , p^2 ) .",
    "using these coordinates the @xmath52 meson and the two final state meson momenta can be written as p_b = ( 1,1,*0*_t ) , p_2 = ( 1,0,*0*_t ) , p_3 = ( 0,1,*0*_t ) , respectively .",
    "the meson masses have been neglected .",
