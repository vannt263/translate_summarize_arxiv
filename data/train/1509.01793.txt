    "ultraluminous x - ray sources ( ulxs ; fabbiano 2006 ) discovered in other galaxies exhibit high x - ray luminosities @xmath1 erg @xmath2 , and are possibly the long sought after intermediate mass black holes ( imbhs ) radiating at sub - eddinton levels .",
    "recent studies have shown that , except for a few cases , many ulxs can be stellar mass black holes in an ultraluminous state under supercritical accretion @xcite . indeed , optical monitoring campaigns of two ulxs , m101 ulx-1 @xcite and ngc 7793 p13 @xcite , have confirmed both to be stellar mass black holes , while _ nustar _",
    "observations of m82 have discovered that a transient ulx , m82 x-2 , is actually powered by an accreting neutron star @xcite .",
    "m82 x-1 ( cxo j095550.2 + 694047 ) is the brightest ulx in the starburst galaxy , m82 , at a distance of 3.6mpc @xcite , and arguably the best imbh candidate in the local universe .",
    "m82 x-1 exhibits extremely high luminosities that can reach @xmath3 @xmath4 in the @xmath5 kev bands @xcite , suggesting an imbh of about @xmath6 if radiating at the eddington level .",
    "recently , pasham et al . (",
    "2014 ) re - analyzed 6-year _ rossi x - ray timing explorer _",
    "( _ rxte _ ) x - ray observations and revealed the high - frequency , 3:2 ratio , twin - peak quasi - periodic oscillations ( qpos ) of 3.3 hz and 5hz , which , in combination with the low - frequency qpo revealed by an _",
    "xmm - newton _ observation , suggests an imbh of @xmath7 under the relativistic precession model @xcite .",
    "interestingly , x - ray observations of m82 with the proportional counter array ( pca ) on board _ rxte _ over eight months has revealed regular modulations of about 20% with a period of about 62 days ( @xcite , hereafter kf07 ) .",
    "@xcite interpreted such a period as the orbital period for m82 x-1 , and consequently derived a giant or supergiant companion for m82 x-1 .",
    "however , the analysis of another 4.5-year _ rxte_/pca light curve of m82 has shown a sudden phase shift of the 62-day modulation , suggesting the 62-day x - ray period may be caused by a precessing accretion disk around the black hole ( @xcite , hereafter ps13 ) .    while previous studies have attributed the periodic modulations in the _",
    "rxte_/pca light curves to , the brightest x - ray source in m82 , it is not necessarily true because _ rxte_/pca has a very poor spatial resolution of @xmath0 , and the flux includes contributions from all x - ray sources in m82 ( @xmath8 ) and nearby galaxies .",
    "in contrast , the x - ray telescope ( xrt ) on board the _ swift _ satellite has a much better spatial resolution with a half power diameter of 18 , and may resolve the bright point sources in m82 . in this letter , we use _",
    "swift_/xrt observations over 1000 days to scrutinize the x - ray periodicity of m82 .",
    "the data analysis and results are presented in  2 , and the discussion follows in  3 .",
    "the _ swift_/xrt observations of m82 operated in the photon - counting mode are used in this work , which are retrieved from the heasarc archive .",
    "these include a total of 106 observations spanning from 2012 april to 2015 january .",
    "70 observations in @xmath9 are not used because they are badly contaminated by the supernova sn 2014j in m82 .",
    "inspection of these xrt observations confirms that x - ray photons from m82 x-1 and nearby sources dominate the field within @xmath10 of m82 .",
    "there are three other ulxs near m82 x-1 , e.g. , m82 x-2 , cxou j095551.2 + 694044 ( hereafter @xmath11 ) and cxou j095550.6 + 694944 ( hereafter x-4 ; ) with @xmath12 separations from each other .",
    "those four ulxs can only be clearly resolved by the _ chandra x - ray observatory _",
    "( see figure 1(a ) ) , unfortunately there are not enough _ chandra _ observations of m82 x-1 in order to perform periodicity analysis .",
    "in contrast , _ swift_/xrt has more than a hundred observations of m82 x-1 , and it can marginally resolve the four ulxs in a single observation ( figure 1(b ) ) , though the claimed half power diameter of the point spread function of xrt is 18 .",
    "the image spatial resolution of xrt is one pixel ( 2.36 ) , but the positional accuracy from centroiding can be higher when there are ample photons . to reveal of all the faint and bright x - ray sources with more accurate positions , we stacked the total 106 xrt observations . before image stacking ,",
    "one pixel was equally divided into @xmath13 parts , and each part ( a sub - pixel ) was assigned 1% of the pixel counts .",
    "then the total 106 images in sub - pixels were matched under wcs coordinates and stacked into one ( figure 1(c ) ) .",
    "this stacked image ( figure 1(c ) ) reveals that the four ulxs are not blurred into one unresolved source , but an asymmetric structure in which x-1 and the other three ulxs are separated .",
    "x-2 is the second brightest x - ray source in m82 , but it is not evident in figure 1(c ) because it is a transient and , for most of the time , it is in a quiescent state . among the 106 _ swift _ observations , only a dozen observations in which x-2 is brighter than x-3 and x-4 .",
    "x-3 is also a variable x - ray source , and is visible in 46 observations .",
    "x-4 was reported as a supernova remnant candidate @xcite , which is supposed to have relatively constant flux .",
    "furthermore , to inspect whether xrt can resolve x-1 from x-3 or not , 46 observations in which x-3 is brighter than the nearby background were selected , and stacked into one image ( figure 1(d ) ) .",
    "the rest of the 60 observations are stacked and shown in figure 1(e ) .",
    "these figures imply that x-1 can be roughly resolved from x-3 , while counts from x-2 , x-3 , and x-4 within 4mix up with each other and can hardly be resolved by xrt .",
    "thus , sources with separations larger than 4can marginally resolved by xrt , but not vice versa .",
    "[ f1 ]      based on the long - term observations , _",
    "swift_/xrt data can be used to test the 62-day modulation ( kf07 ) of m82 .",
    "source counts were extracted from a circular region 18 in radius centered on x-1 , with 73% of energy encircled @xcite .",
    "the background was defined by a circular region with a radius of 20 pixels ( 47 ) placed near m82 x-1 , but avoiding the contamination from other point sources .",
    "the 0.3 - 10 kev background - subtracted light curve , binned per observation , was used to look for the periodicity of x-1 with the lomb - scargle(l - s ) algorithm .",
    "the power of the periodogram was normalized by the total variance of the data @xcite .",
    "as shown in figure [ f2 ] ( a ) , the main peak appears at the period of @xmath14 days , and the error is estimated by calculating the fwhm of the main peak in the periodogram .",
    "the significance of the main peak in periodogram can be given by the false alarm probability ( hereafter fap ) assuming all of the datapoints were generated by stochastic noises .",
    "the fap based on the gaussian white noise of the main peak is less than 0.001 ( dashed horizontal lines in figure 2(a ) ) , i.e. , the confidence level of this period generated by a signal instead of the white noise background is more than 99.9% . while significant peaks under the white noise background may have low significance when taking the red noise component into consideration .",
    "in contrast to white noise , whose power is independent of frequency , red noise exhibits a power - law spectrum in the form of @xmath15 ( @xmath16 for white noise ) , which can lead to relatively large aperiodic peaks in the power spectrum at low frequencies .",
    "in actuality , the periodogram ( figure 2(a ) ) does not show evidence of increasing slope for red noise at long periods , but is rather flat with a best - fit power law index of @xmath17 . in spite of this , we estimated the significance of the observed data under a red noise background .",
    "100,000 red noise synthetic light curves with a mean and variance equal to the ones of the actual data were generated .",
    "each synthetic light curve has the same sampling time series as the actual data set and was used to conduct l - s periodograms ( see @xcite for more details ) .",
    "we found only two cases that power values at a period of @xmath14 days excess the power ( 12.24 ) of the observed highest peak .",
    "namely , the probability that a red noise produces a peak at the given period ranges higher than 12.24 is only @xmath18 .",
    "the fap of the highest peak at the inspected frequencies ( 40 - 80 days ) based on red noise is 0.0012 ( confidence of 99.88% ) @xcite .",
    "hence , the 62-day periodicity from _",
    "swift_/xrt data is significant enough to be produced by a real periodic signal , and confirms the @xmath19day modulation of m82 discovered by kf07 with _",
    "rxte_/pca .",
    "the phase shift of the 62-day period was reported by ps13 utilizing _ rxte_/pca observations . following the work in ps13",
    ", we folded the new _",
    "swift_/xrt light curve ( mjd 56022.9-mjd 57053.4 ) at 62 days to test the stability of the @xmath20day periodicity . the previous _ rxte _ light curves from ps13 consist of two segments , which cover mjd 53250.6 - 54225.4 ( segment 1 , the same data used in kf07 ) and mjd 54353.8 - 55195.8 ( segment 2 ) , respectively .",
    "start times of the _ swift _ light curve and the two _ rxte _ light curves were set to be the same ( mjd 53250.6 )",
    ". then the three light curves were folded at the period of 62 days ( see figure [ f2](b ) ) .",
    "the two rxte light curves indeed reveal a 0.4 phase offset as reported in ps13 . compared with rxte light curves , the _ swift",
    "_ light curve shows changes of about 0.2 in phase relative to _ rxte _ segment 1 , and 0.4 in phase relative to _ rxte _ segment 2 .",
    "it confirms the result in ps13 that the 62-day x - ray periodicity of m82 has phase changes , indicating that it is not stable .      since the 18radius circular region used in  2.1 encircles not only x-1 but many other x - ray sources , it is not clear whether the 62-day periodicity originates from a certain single source , like x-1 , or from summed contributions of several x - ray sources .",
    "hence , we used a smaller source region with a radius of 4 , which can separate x-1 from other x - ray sources , yet contains 30% of the energy encircled in the 18region used in  2.2 , to construct the periodicity map of m82 and analyze the origin of the 62-day modulation .",
    "we divided the region around m82 x-1 into a grid with steps of 0.5 pixel ( i.e. , 1.18 ) in x and y directions , and constructed light curves with photons from the sub - pixels ( as in  2.1 ) within a 4circular region centered at each grid point .",
    "l - s periodograms were calculated as in  2.2 , and the power for the strongest peak was chosen as the value for each grid point to construct the periodicity map as displayed in figure [ f3](a ) .",
    "this periodicity map exhibits two strong periods at @xmath21 days and @xmath22 days ( denoted by the red diamond and the blue triangle , respectively , in figure [ f3](a ) ) , which are positionally coincident with x-3 and x-4 respectively .",
    "in contrast , there is almost no significant periodicity near x-1 .",
    "the individual periodograms of x-1 , x-2 , x-3 , and x-4 with source regions of 4 in radii are displayed in figure [ f3](b ) .",
    "the highest peak in the periodogram of x-1 is at @xmath23 days , but with much lower confidence levels of 56% and 69% for white noise and red noise background respectively . except for x-1 ,",
    "the periodograms of x-2 , x-3 , and x-4 all show the @xmath24 day and @xmath25 day period , and the significance of the highest peaks in them are larger than 99% based on both white noise and red noise background .",
    "this implies that the @xmath24 and @xmath25 days peaks are generated by real periodic signals with high probability rather than white or red noises , and the photons from the two signals are mixed up in the region containing x-2 , x-3 , and x-4 ( dark part in figure [ f3](a ) ) , while they still can be distinguished from the counts of x-1 .",
    "thus the 62-day periodicity is most likely associated with the region 4southeast of x-1 , instead of x-1 as expected .",
    "by combining the _ rxte _ and _ swift _ light curves , we analyzed a longer term light curve .",
    "the analysis confirms phase changes of the 62-day period of m82 , indicating that this period is not stable .",
    "a detailed timing analysis of m82 shows two significant periodicities at 55 and 62 days in a region 4southeast of x-1 , which contains x-2 , x-3 , and x-4 .",
    "given the x - ray localization precision of xrt , the periodicity map can hardly resolve x-2 , x-3 , and x-4 clearly , but it can easily distinguish the three ulxs from x-1 .",
    "this indicates that the 62-day period is not from m82 x-1 , but most likely from the three ulxs .",
    "the instability of the 62-day period may be due to the comprehensive effect of several different periodic x - ray sources , instead of a precessing accretion disk .",
    "it is not yet clear which sources produce the @xmath24 and @xmath25 day periodicities .",
    "however , x-4 can be excluded first since it is a luminous young x - ray supernova remnant candidate @xcite , whose flux can not fluctuate periodically .",
    "x-2 ( also referred to as x42.3 + 59 ) is interpreted as a magnetized neutron star system with an orbital period of 2.5 days @xcite .",
    "superorbital periods of neutron star binaries can range from 25 days to 160 days @xcite .",
    "the @xmath26 days may be a superorbital period of x-2 , but it may be not valid because the x - ray luminosity of x-2 is several orders of magnitude larger than for the other neutron star binaries @xcite .    for x-3 , it is suggested as a background active galactic nucleus because of its soft excess below 2 kev @xcite .",
    "however , soft excess is also common in an obscured high - mass x - ray binary ( hmxb ; e.g. , igr j19140 + 0951 and igr j16207 - 5129 ; @xcite ) .",
    "x-3 has also been regarded as an hmxb @xcite . given the strong star - forming activities in m82 ,",
    "hmxbs are expected to dominate the bright x - ray sources @xcite . assuming the isotropic unabsorbed emission , the maximum 0.5 - 10 kev luminosity of x-3 is @xmath27 erg s@xmath28 @xcite , which is approximate to the ( maximum - minimum ) luminosity modulation of m82 ( @xmath29 erg s@xmath28 ; kf07 ) .",
    "therefore , x-3 is bright enough to dominant the periodicity in m82 if x-3 is an hmxb with an orbital period of 62 days .    in summary ,",
    "the limited spatial resolution of xrt is the bottleneck in this study , but it is already indicating that the 62-day periodicity of m82 may not come from x-1 . to obtain a reliable location of the periodicities , more monitoring of m82 is needed .     + we thank the anonymous referee for a number of helpful comments .",
    "we are grateful for the service of the _ swift _ data archive .",
    "we thank song wang , yu bai , stephan justham and qing gao et  al .  for useful discussions .",
    "we would like to specially thank d. j. pasham for providing _ rxte _ reduced data and helpful discussions .",
