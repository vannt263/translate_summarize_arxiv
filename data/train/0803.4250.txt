    "supersymmetry ( susy ) is one of the most promising candidates for physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) . the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) not only provides a solution to the gauge hierarchy problem in the sm but also has some attractive features , for example , the gauge coupling unification , the radiative electroweak symmetry breaking , and giving dark matter candidates as the lightest superparticle .",
    "however , the mssm has serious problems in susy breaking sector .",
    "if we introduce generic susy breaking terms , they induce very large amplitudes for flavor changing neutral current ( fcnc ) and @xmath0 violating processes to satisfy the various experimental constraints@xcite .",
    "to avoid the problems the universal soft sfermion masses are often assumed at some scale@xcite .    the assumption of the universal soft masses is not necessarily required .",
    "for example , since the fcnc constraints for the first two generation field are much severer than for the third generation fields , the universal soft masses sometimes have been imposed only for the first two generation sfermion , which are realized if we impose non - abelian horizontal symmetry , for example , @xmath7 , under which the first two generation fields are doublets and the third generation fields are singlets @xcite . however",
    ", if the diagonalizing matrix of the fermion has maki - nakagawa - sakata @xcite ( mns)-_like _ large mixings , such sfermion mass spectrum leads to very large fcnc to be consistent with the experimental bound .",
    "therefore , such nonuniversality should be introduced only for the sfermion whose fermionic superpartners have the diagnalizing matrix with the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa @xcite ( ckm)-_like _ small mixings .    in @xmath4",
    "susy grand unified theory ( gut ) , it is a reasonable assumption that the diagonalizing matrices of * 10 * have the ckm-_like _ small mixings , while those of @xmath8 have the mns-_like _ large mixing , because the * 10 * includes the doublet quarks , and @xmath8 includes the doublet leptons . under this assumption , only the sfermions included in the third generation of the * 10 * ( @xmath9 ) , can have different masses from the others without conflicting with experimental constraints from various fcnc processes .",
    "we summarize several characteristic features of the nonuniversal sfermion masses .",
    "first of all , the rotation matrices for * 10 * , which make fermions to mass eigenstates are expected to have the ckm-_like _ small mixings , since * 10 * involves quark doublet . therefore , large off - diagonal entries for the * 10 * sfermion mass matrices do not arise after this rotation , even if the initial soft masses are not universal .",
    "moreover , fcnc constraints among 1 - 3 or 2 - 3 generations are not so severe compared with those of 1 - 2 generations . therefore , we can expect that nonuniversality for the third generation does not conflict with the fcnc constraints .",
    "moreover , it is important that we can expect larger fcnc for the third generation fields than in the usual universal sfermion mass case as discussed in ref.@xcite .",
    "second , the naturalness of the higgs mass in mssm requires that the gaugino masses , the higgsino mass , and the stop masses must be around the weak scale . in the nonuniversality case",
    ", we can take the larger masses for all the sfermions except for the sfermions of the @xmath9 without conflicting with the naturalness arguments , because both ( left and right handed ) stops are included in the @xmath9 . in principle",
    ", we can take such mass larger than 1 tev , which can relax the various constraints from fcnc and electric dipole moments ( edm ) , etc .",
    "again , the fcnc related with the third generation fields can become relatively large , which may be detectable in future experiments .",
    "finally , such a sfermion mass spectrum can be realized in the anomalous @xmath10 susy - breaking models@xcite , flavor - mediated susy breaking models@xcite , radiatively driven models with specific boundary conditions@xcite , extra dimension models,@xcite and models with discrete symmetry,@xcite and is naturally derived from @xmath11 susy gut model @xcite with @xmath12 or @xmath13 horizontal symmetry @xcite .",
    "it is expected that fcnc processes among 2 - 3 generations , particularly , the @xmath14 or @xmath15 transition rate become relatively large in the nonuniversal sfermion mass model . in the previous paper @xcite , we studied @xmath16 and @xmath17 processes and showed that these lepton flavor violating processes can have very large branching ratios and that these processes may be discovered in near future experiments .",
    "however , in the quark sector , this model gives similar predictions for the various fcnc processes to those in the model with the universal sfermion masses because the off - diagonal elements of the squark mass matrix obtained from the nonuniversal sfermion masses are of the same order as those obtained by the renormalization group equations ( rges ) from the universal sfermion masses .",
    "the difference between these models appears in the @xmath0 violating processes because , in the nonuniversal sfermion mass model , there are new @xmath0 phases except for the kobayashi - maskawa ( km ) phase .",
    "therefore , it is interesting to study the @xmath0 violating processes in the nonuniversal sfermion mass model to distinguish these models .    in this paper",
    ", we focus on the 2 - 3 transition in the quark sector and analyze the @xmath0 asymmetries of @xmath1 and @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "these observables attracted attention a few years ago since the belle collaboration @xcite reported the large deviation from a sm expectation @xmath18 @xcite .",
    "their current experimental world averages are @xmath19 , @xmath20 @xcite and they are almost consistent with the sm expectation , but it is still important to measure these observables accurately in the search for new physics beyond the sm .",
    "particularly , the @xmath0 asymmetries of @xmath1 and @xmath5 are interesting for the model with the nonuniversal masses because of the following reasons .",
    "i ) since susy contribution to @xmath0 violation in @xmath14 transition can be large in this model while the sm has little @xmath0 phase in the @xmath21 processes , large deviations of @xmath0 asymmetries from the sm are expected .",
    "ii ) both experimental central values of @xmath1 and @xmath2 negatively deviate from the sm expectation .",
    "it is known that such deviations favor the models with only ll mixing ( not rr mixing ) in down - type squark sector @xcite .",
    "this gives a strong motivation to analyze the @xmath0 asymmetries of @xmath1 and @xmath2 in this nonuniversal sfermion mass model , because the @xmath22 contain left - handed down quarks and not right - handed down quarks .",
    "iii ) as in the processes of @xmath16 and @xmath23 , the deviations of @xmath0 asymmetries of @xmath1 and @xmath2 from the sm expectation strongly depend on the sfermion masses of the @xmath9 . therefore ,",
    "if the sfermion masses of the @xmath9 are measured in the large hadron collider ( lhc ) experiment , the predictions of the branching ratios of the lfv processes and the @xmath0 asymmetries can be more definite . even if the sfermion masses of the @xmath9 are not measured by lhc",
    ", we can check the consistency of this model by comparing with the lfv processes and the @xmath0 asymmetries .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    ", we will specify the model and discuss the flavor and @xmath0 violating couplings in this model . after giving definitions and notations to analyze @xmath0 asymmetries in  3 ,",
    "the results of numerical study are given in  4 . in ",
    "5 we will discuss some of the constraints of this model .",
    "we summarize this paper in  6 .",
    "in this section , we discuss flavor and @xmath0 violating couplings related with @xmath0 asymmetries of @xmath21 processes in the nonuniversal mass model .",
    "first , we assume that the sm gauge group @xmath24 is unified into @xmath4 and the mediation of susy breaking respects the @xmath4 gauge symmetry . or @xmath25 . ]",
    "we start from the following lagrangian at gut scale , @xmath26 where @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 ( @xmath30 ) are quark doublets , right - handed up quarks , and right - handed down quarks , respectively , and the fields with tildes denote sfermions . as mentioned in the introduction , we assume the following forms for the sfermion mass matrices . @xmath31 by redefining the superfields , we can diagonalize the up type yukawa matrix . @xmath32",
    "@xmath33 where @xmath34 and @xmath35 are the real and diagonal yukawa matrices and ckm matrix at gut scale , respectively .",
    "@xmath36 is a unitary matrix of quark doublets and it is roughly expected as @xmath37 where @xmath38 is cabibbo angle @xmath39 and we omit the @xmath40 coefficients and phases .",
    "then , @xmath41 is estimated as @xmath42 @xmath43 here , we use @xmath44 and the unitarity properties of @xmath36 .",
    "since we have already used the freedom of phase rotation of quark fields to reduce the number of phases in @xmath35 into one , the coefficients in @xmath36 have @xmath40 phases generically . therefore",
    ", the off - diagonal entries of @xmath45 and @xmath46 can have new @xmath40 phases .",
    "to calculate @xmath0 asymmetries of @xmath47 , we need the low energy sfermion mass matrices @xmath48 and @xmath49 , which are obtained by renormalization group equation ( rge ) .",
    "however , off - diagonal entries of sfermion mass matrices do not change significantly in rges between gut and weak scale , for example , @xmath50 \\times ( m_{\\tilde{q}}^2)_{32}(\\lambda_{gut } ) \\nonumber \\\\ & \\sim & 0.8 \\times ( m_{\\tilde{q}}^2)_{32}(\\lambda_{gut})\\ , .",
    "\\label{rgemq}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in our analysis , we do not fix the off - diagonal entries at gut scale ( we can estimate only their order . ) , so we absorb the high and low energy differences of the @xmath51 in ambiguity of @xmath52 . for other relevant off - diagonal entries ,",
    "the changes between gut and weak scale are rather small owing to small yukawa couplings .",
    "therefore , we calculate the diagonal components of these mass matrices by rges .",
    "finally , we go to the super ckm basis by rotating the superfields as @xmath53 at low energy .",
    "then , low energy sfermion mass matrices are obtained as @xmath54 @xmath55 does not have off - diagonal entries .",
    "note that since a component @xmath56 does not have a large @xmath0 phase , the first term in eq.([md ] ) does not contribute to the parameter @xmath57 $ ] .",
    "thus , the following approximate relation is obtained .",
    "{ \\rm im}[(m_{\\tilde{u}_l}^2)_{32 } ] \\sim ( m^2_{30}-m^2_0)\\lambda^2 \\sin \\theta_{susy } , \\label{cpvs}\\ ] ] where @xmath59 is a phase of @xmath60 .",
    "this relation means that if the gluino contribution is maximized by the susy phase , then the chargino contribution is also maximized .",
    "thus , strong interference between gluino and chargino contributions is expected in this model .",
    "in this section , we give a review of the well known method of effective field theory formalism to calculate the @xmath0 asymmetries of @xmath47 @xcite .",
    "their time dependent @xmath0 asymmetries are defined as @xmath61 where @xmath62 and @xmath63 represent the direct and mixing @xmath0 asymmetries , respectively , and their expressions are given as @xmath64}{|\\bar{\\rho}(\\pek)|^2 + 1 } , \\label{cs}\\ ] ] where @xmath65(or @xmath66 ) is the standard angle of the unitarity triangle , and parameter @xmath67 is defined as @xmath68 here , @xmath69 and @xmath70 are decay amplitudes of @xmath71 and @xmath72 , respectively , which can be calculated using the effective hamiltonian of @xmath73 transition at the low energy @xmath74 @xmath75 effective hamiltonian @xmath76 is expressed using the operator product expansion(ope ) as @xcite @xmath77 + \\ { q \\to \\tilde{q},\\ , c \\to \\tilde{c } \\ } , \\nonumber \\\\\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath78 , @xmath79 are the low energy wilson coefficients .",

    "the matrix elements @xmath91 are provided in appendix a. the low energy wilson coefficients @xmath92 can be obtained from the high energy coefficients @xmath93 ( @xmath94 ) by solving the renormalization group equations for qcd in the sm .",

    "their expressions are provided in appendix b. for simplicity , the matching scale is chosen as the @xmath97 , but we calculate the wilson coefficients in full theory , which includes the superparticles .",
    "we construct each coefficient using the sm contributions @xmath98 , charged higgs contributions @xmath99 , gluino contributions @xmath100 , and chargino contributions @xmath101 as follows : @xmath102 here , we ignored the contributions of @xmath103-@xmath104 and @xmath105-@xmath106 .",
    "since there are no flavor and @xmath0 violation in right - handed down - type squark sector in the nonuniversal mass model as mentioned in the previous section , the coefficient @xmath107 does not emerge .",
    "the @xmath108 and @xmath109 can also be neglected because the @xmath110 is suppressed by the factor @xmath111 compared with @xmath112 .",

    "@xmath115 the 1-loop order expression for the wilson coefficients in eq.([cs ] ) are provided in appendix b.    let us discuss the deviations of @xmath116 and @xmath117 from the sm expectation .",
    "first , we extract the strong phase from the amplitudes as @xmath118 .",
    "since the dominant contribution to the @xmath69 , which is provided from the sm is almost real , we can expand @xmath119 and @xmath120 with @xmath121 as follows .",
    "@xmath122 then using eq.([cs ] ) , we can derive @xmath123,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath124 , @xmath125 , and @xmath126 represent a deviation from the sm expectation .",
    "the first term provides the leading contribution to @xmath126 , and second term always provides the negative contribution .",
    "therefore , the maximum value of @xmath127 is given as positive @xmath128 .",
    "in this section , we show the numerical results of the deviation of @xmath0 asymmetries of @xmath113 and @xmath114 from the sm expectation .",
    "we are interested in the parameter region in which a tuning in the mssm higgs sector is relaxed owing to the light masses of stops , gluino and higgsinos , because one of the advantages of the nonuniversal mass model is that the light stops can be realized while the first two generation sfermions are heavy .",
    "therefore , we basically use the following parameter set through our analysis .",
    "@xmath129 where @xmath130 is the universal gaugino mass and @xmath131 is the higgsino mass .",
    "we took them as relatively small to relax the fine tuning in the mssm higgs sector .    at first glance",
    ", we may think that the above parameter region conflicts with the lep constraint for the higgs boson mass . however , the well - known lep constraint on the sm higgs boson mass , 114.4 gev can not be applied to the `` mssm '' lightest higgs boson if the mssm lightest higgs does not have relevant coupling to the z boson @xcite .",
    "in this situation , the large quantum correction to the sm-_like _ higgs boson from the large stop and gluino masses is not required .",
    "we checked that the above parameter region is numerically consistent with the lep constraint in the literature @xcite . in the above parameter region , since charginos and stops are relatively light , it is expected that not only gluino diagram but also chargino diagrams give relatively large contribution to the @xmath0 asymmetries .    in such a small @xmath132 coupling region",
    ", it is known that all mssm higgs bosons have relatively small masses@xcite .",
    "then , negative @xmath131 and large @xmath133 are disfavored by the constraints from @xmath134 , @xmath135 , @xmath136 , and @xmath137 processes .",
    "there are large contributions to the @xmath134 from the charged higgs - top loop diagram and the chargino - stop loop diagram in our parameter region .",
    "the typical orders of magnitudes of their amplitudes are of the same order as the sm one and the cancelation between them is therefore required .",
    "this cancelation is realized only in the positive @xmath131 case . at the same time , @xmath138 can not be arbitrarily large otherwise the top quark significantly decays into charged higgs boson and @xmath139 quark ( @xmath140 is mandatory@xcite ) .",
    "moreover , the contributions from the light higgs boson exchange to the @xmath141 and the @xmath142 are highly sensitive to large @xmath133 , because they are proportional to @xmath143 and @xmath144 , respectively.@xcite thus , the constraints from these processes disfavor the region in which @xmath145@xcite . from the above reasons , we do not consider the negative @xmath131 or large @xmath133 region in this paper .    before presenting the numerical results , we give a rough argument to show that we can discuss the magnitude of each contribution to @xmath146 separately . to separate each contribution ,",

    "thus , we plot the region in which the total value of the coefficient @xmath210 is consistent with the sm value @xmath211 at 10@xmath212 level .",
    "figure5 shows the complex plane of @xmath213 .",
    "we scan the @xmath59 in the range ( 0 - 2@xmath176 ) in this calculation .",
    "the grey arrow represents the contribution that includes the sm , charged higgs , and ckm originated chargino contributions , which can not have the @xmath0 violating phase except for a small km phase .",
    "as mentioned in the previous section , because of the cancelation between the charged higgs and the ckm originated chargino contribution in the positive @xmath131 case , the sum of these contributions becomes almost the same as the sm contribution as pointed out in ref.@xcite .",
    "originated chargino contributions .",
    "] on the other hand , the black arrow represents the sum of the gluino and @xmath163 originated chargino contributions that have a susy phase @xmath59 . as we can see from fig.5 ,",
    "@xmath214 is consistent with the @xmath134 constraint .",
    "we use the parameter set in ( [ pset ] ) and @xmath215.,width=226 ]    for the edm constraints , it has been pointed out that chromo edms ( cedms ) and edms strongly constrain the off - diagonal entries of sfermion mass matrices in ref.@xcite . in the parameter region",
    "adopted in our paper , most of susy contributions to the ( c)edms can be decoupled in the large @xmath216 limit .",
    "however , there is a non decoupling diagram contributing to the ( c)edms of up quark because both left and right - handed stops have small masses .",
    "this diagram makes a generically effective mass insertion parameter as    cr        @xmath217 / m_3 ^ 2 \\nonumber \\\\ & \\sim & \\frac{(m^2_{\\tilde{u}_l})_{13}}{m^2_{\\tilde{u}_l } } \\frac{a_t m_t}{m^2_{\\tilde{t}_l } m^2_{\\tilde{t}_r } } \\frac{(m^2_{\\tilde{u}_r})_{31}}{m^2_{\\tilde{u}_r } }   \\nonumber \\\\ & \\sim & \\frac{(m_{30}^2-m_0 ^ 2)\\lambda^3}{m^2 } \\frac{a_t m_t}{m_3 ^ 2 m_3",

    "for example , we can construct such models in a framework of spontaneous @xmath0 violation in @xmath11 gut with horizontal symmetry @xcite .",
    "finally , we comment on the significance of our results for the specific models . in the specific models , other tree - level contributions to the off - diagonal part of the sfermion mass matrices exist generically .",
    "especially , the correction to the 5bar squark fields can give a large effect to the result .",
    "in this paper , however , we do not discuss them because these contributions are dependent on the explicit models and in many cases they can be decoupled in the limit @xmath219 . if the condition @xmath219 is not satisfied it is possible to expect more deviation of the @xmath0 asymmetry of @xmath220 in such explicit models .",
    "we investigated the @xmath0 asymmetries of @xmath113 and @xmath114 in a nonuniversal mass model in which the third generation sfermion included in @xmath22 of @xmath4 have different masses ( @xmath221 ) from the others ( @xmath222 ) .",
    "we chose mssm parameters @xmath219 , @xmath130 and @xmath131 , which suppress the fcncs and edms for the first two generation fields without destabilizing the weak scale .",
    "then the chargino contribution is as important as the gluino contribution .",
    "the reasons are as follows . for the smaller @xmath131 parameter ,",
    "the gluino contribution , which is proportional to @xmath223 becomes smaller and the chargino contribution becomes larger .",
    "moreover , since both stops are included in @xmath22 , small @xmath224 makes one of the stops very light owing to the left - right mixing . owing to the @xmath225 symmetry",
    ", the chargino contribution has the same @xmath0 phase as the gluino contribution and the numerical calculation reveal their interference is constructive .",
    "as the result , @xmath226 becomes comparatively large .    other @xmath0 violating observables related to the @xmath21 processes , for example , @xmath0 violation in @xmath134@xcite and time dependent @xmath0 asymmetry of @xmath227@xcite , etc .",
    ", may deviate from the sm predictions .",
    "this is our future work .",
    "we found that the deviations of the cp asymmetries of @xmath113 and @xmath114 can be @xmath6 in this model .",
    "we checked that both deviations @xmath228 and @xmath229 have the same sign .",

    "<S> we analyze @xmath0 asymmetries of @xmath1 and @xmath2 in a supersymmetric grand unified theory in which only the third generation sfermions contained in @xmath3 of @xmath4 can have a different mass from the others . </S>",
    "<S> one of the advantages of this nonuniversal mass model is that the first two generation sfermion masses can be large whereas both ( left and right handed ) stops are light so as to stabilize the weak scale . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , we studied a minimal supersymmetric standard model parameter region in which a fine tuning in higgs sector is relaxed owing to light masses of stops , gluino and higgsinos . </S>",
