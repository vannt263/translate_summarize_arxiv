    "spectrographs of unprecedented precision will be required to meet the ambitious science goals of modern astronomy , in areas such as earth - like exoplanet detection via the radial velocity technique @xcite , and the sandage test of the real - time rate of expansion of the universe @xcite . to achieve the required precision",
    ", future spectrographs must operate at high spectral resolution ( r = @xmath1/d@xmath1 @xmath2 100,000 ) , must be precisely calibrated , and must be exceptionally stable during any given measurement .",
    "the requirement for high precision spectrographs , operating efficiently on larger telescopes over a range of wavelengths , poses a variety of challenges to the design and construction of suitable spectrographs .",
    "for example , there tends to be a strong coupling between the size of a telescope and the size of the instruments required to efficiently process the light it captures .",
    "this coupling stems from eq .",
    "[ eq1 ] , where it can be seen that the number of modes that form the point spread function ( psf ) of a telescope scales with @xmath3 @xcite .    @xmath4    where @xmath5 is the number of modes that form the telescope psf ( for each polarisation state ) , @xmath6 is the diameter of the telescope and @xmath1 is the wavelength of the light .",
    "@xmath7 is the angular width of the psf , obtained from a deconvolution of the diffraction - limited and seeing - limited images , but can be approximated as : @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the so - called ` astronomical seeing ' measured as the full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) of the long - exposure psf of the site in radians .",
    ". [ eq1 ] indicates that the number of modes that form a telescope psf increases rapidly with increasing telescope aperture , and thus implies that larger telescopes require spectrographs with larger input slit - widths to maintain throughput ( of course this is assuming that the f - ratio of the optical input to the spectrograph is held constant ) .",
    "a larger slit - width then results in a larger spectrograph to maintain the required spectral resolution .",
    "the larger the instrument , the more expensive it is , and the lower the quality of the optics .",
    "the current generation of @xmath10810 m class telescopes already require appropriately scaled spectrographs , in order to obtain the desired resolving power with efficient input coupling , and future @xmath11 30 m class extremely large telescopes would require even larger instruments @xcite .    one approach to address the coupling between telescope size and spectrograph size implied by eq .",
    "[ eq1 ] is to employ adaptive optics ( ao ) .",
    "a perfect ao system would , of course , produce a psf that was diffraction - limited regardless of the size of the telescope .",
    "state - of - the - art extreme ao systems are now able to produce near - diffraction - limited psf s ( @xmath2 90 % strehl ) on 8 m class telescopes at near - ir wavelengths in the h - band , but only over a narrow field of view @xcite . it is also not yet clear how well ao systems will work on the new extremely large telescopes currently under construction ; the european extremely large telescope ( e - elt ) , the thirty metre telescope ( tmt ) and the giant magellan telescope ( gmt ) , particularly at shorter wavelengths .",
    "one approach that may complement ao systems , and enable the design of simpler and smaller spectrographs for larger telescopes , is the so - called pimms ( photonic integrated multimode micro - spectrograph ) concept @xcite .",
    "the idea behind the pimms concept is to use a guided - wave transition , known as a ` photonic lantern ' @xcite , to efficiently couple the multimode telescope psf to an array of single modes .",
    "these single modes can then be re - arranged ( or _ reformatted _ ) into a linear array to form a pseudo - slit that acts as a diffraction - limited single - mode input ( along the dispersion axis ) to a spectrograph .",
    "importantly , although the length of the slit in the pimms concept increases as the number of modes in the psf increases , the size of the spectrograph in the plane of dispersion is independent of the telescope size .    a further and potentially powerful benefit of the pimms concept is its potential to enable fibre - fed spectrographs that are precisely calibrated @xcite and free of modal noise .",
    "modal noise is a phenomenon present in multimode optical - fibre - fed spectrographs , where changes in the modal pattern at the output of the fibre effectively result in variations in the spectrograph linefunction @xcite .",
    "interestingly , modal noise is expected to be completely absent in the single mode regime , since the output of the fibre can exhibit only one spatial profile ( neglecting polarisation effects ) , is worst in the two mode regime , and then becomes less severe due to statistical averaging as the number of modes in the fibre increases .",
    "if we assume that the fibre is designed to match the psf , then eq .",
    "[ eq1 ] would imply that unless we are operating at the diffraction - limit , using single mode fibres , modal noise can become an increasing problem as the wavelength of operation increases , and/or ao systems improve .",
    "modal noise has , for example , now been identified as being a critical issue in giano @xcite , a fibre - fed radial velocity spectrograph intended for operation at between 950 and 2500 nm on the 3.58 m telescopio nazionale galileo ( tng ) . under 0.6 arcsec",
    "seeing , the psf of the tng consists of @xmath1075 modes at 950 nm and just @xmath1012 modes at 2500 nm . given these numbers , it is not at all surprising that the performance of giano is susceptible to significant modal noise issues .",
    "previously we have demonstrated that a fully integrated three - dimensional photonic device , which we named a ` photonic - dicer ' @xcite , could be used to reformat the multimode psf from the canary ao system on the 4.2 m william herschel telescope ( wht ) into a diffraction - limited pseudo - slit .",
    "the device , which was fully fabricated using an advanced laser manufacturing technique known as ultrafast laser inscription ( uli ) @xcite , seamlessly and monolithically integrated a photonic lantern transition with a spatial reformatting section .",
    "the device was tested on - sky by feeding the photonic - dicer with h - band ( 14501610 nm ) stellar light directly from canary , and was found to exhibit an on - sky throughput of 20% @xcite , somewhat less than the 65% measured in the laboratory due to sub - optimal input coupling .",
    "although this work proved the feasibility of using uli fabricated photonic reformatting components for applications in pimms - type instruments , for high - precision instruments it will be highly desirable , if not essential , to de - couple the instrument from the telescope slewing , in order to maximise the stability of the instrument .",
    "this will almost certainly be achieved using an optical - fibre feed to transport the light from the telescope focal plane to the spectrograph .",
    "one potential option to enable this would be to connect the photonic dicer to a standard multimode fibre , but recent work at macquarie university has suggested that such an approach only induces a new form of modal noise that is due to strongly wavelength dependent coupling losses at the fibre - lantern interface ( cvetojevic et al . in prep ) .",
    "[ fig : label ]    with the issues above in mind , an alternative approach is to use a multicore fibre ( mcf ) photonic lantern to collect the psf from the telescope , and use the mcf to transport the light from the telescope focal plane to the spectrograph .",
    "such an approach has recently been implemented on the uk schmidt telescope @xcite , where the two - dimensional array of modes generated by the mcf lantern was then fed directly into a compact spectrograph using the ` tiger ' approach @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , as noted by betters et al . , the lantern used in this work was not correctly matched to the spectral range of the on - sky measurements , and the single - mode cores of the lantern were in fact few - moded at the measurement wavelength .",
    "thus , the full capabilities of implementing photonic - lantern - enabled single - mode spectrographs on - sky , on an astronomical telescope , remain unproven .    in this paper",
    ", we report the successful on - sky application of a ` hybrid ' photonic - reformatter technology based on an mcf photonic lantern and a uli fabricated reformatting component @xcite ( fig .",
    "[ fig : label ] ) that reformats an ao - corrected h - band telescope psf into a diffraction - limited pseudo - slit .",
    "the reformatting device presented here exhibited an on - sky throughput of 53@xmath04% over a wavelength range of 1530@xmath080 nm , very close to the 65% throughput measured in the laboratory over a wavelength range of 1550@xmath020 nm .",
    "we believe that such a hybrid approach , utilising the key capabilities of both mcf photonic lanterns and 3d waveguide technologies , may enable compact high - resolution multimode spectrographs that operate at the diffraction - limit and are free from modal noise .",
    "section  [ reformatter ] of the paper describes the design of the mcf lantern and the uli fabricated component that form the hybrid reformatter .",
    "section  [ canary ] provides a description of the experimental setup used for the on - sky test .",
    "section  [ results ] presents the results and analysis of the on - sky testing of both the hybrid reformatter and mcf lantern .",
    "finally section  [ conc ] summarises our findings and outlines our planned future work in this field .",
    "we aimed to develop a hybrid device that could operate efficiently using the canary ao system , an on - sky ao demonstrator system @xcite installed at the 4.2 m wht in la palma . to enable efficient operation",
    ", the hybrid reformatter must support at least the same number of modes as the number of modes that form the telescope psf .",
    "the number of modes that form the canary psf was calculated using eq .",
    "[ eq1 ] and eq .",
    "[ eq2 ] . for our calculations",
    ", @xmath6 is the diameter of the wht ( 4.2 m ) .",
    "the central wavelength ( @xmath1 ) of our planned on - sky measurements was 1530 nm @xcite , determined from the overlap between the passband of the h - band filter and the responsivity of the xenics xeva-1.7 320 ingaas camera used as a near - infrared imager for the experiment .",
    "under closed - loop operation ( see section [ canary ] ) , a typical ao corrected psf for the central wavelength in our experimental passband , has a strehl ratio of 20 - 30 % @xcite . by considering the shortest wavelength within the fwhm of the passband ( @xmath1=1450 nm ) and using the median seeing at the wht ( 0.7arcsec ) in eq .",
    "[ eq1 ] , the number of modes that form the ao corrected psf is 25 , under closed - loop ao correction .",
    "this is in contrast to the seeing - limited case , where the number of modes is @xmath1260 . given these calculations , the hybrid reformatter was designed to support in excess of 60 orthogonal modes in order to ensure that efficient input coupling is maintained even under varying atmospheric seeing .",
    "figures [ fig : label ] a & b present a schematic and photograph of the hybrid reformatter .",
    "the fibre optics section of the hybrid reformatter consists of a photonic lantern transition ( fig .",
    "[ fig : label]c ) formed from a multicore fibre ( fig .",
    "[ fig : label]d ) .",
    "the core arrangement in our 92-core mcf was a centred hexagon of 91 cores ( fig .",
    "[ fig : label]d ) with a single additional core asymmetrically placed at the edge of the pattern as a marker to uniquely identify the orientation of the fibre , facilitating alignment with the uli reformatter component .",
    "the mcf was made from fused silica , with step - index ge - doped cores , using the standard stack and draw fibre fabrication technique with full fabrication details reported in @xcite .",
    "the adiabatic transition for the lantern was made by tapering the mcf in an f - doped capillary as described in @xcite , to form a multimode input port with a core of cross - sectional diameter 43@xmath13 m and a numerical aperture of 0.22 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : label]c ) .",
    "the mcf was secured in a custom designed v - groove ( fig .",
    "[ fig : label]e ) in order to facilitate secure connection to the uli reformatting element .",
    "the reformatting element of the hybrid reformatter was designed to match the 92 single - modes generated by the mcf ( fig .",
    "[ fig : label]f ) and reformat them into a diffraction - limited pseudo - slit ( fig .",
    "[ fig : label]g ) . for this purpose ,",
    "the technique of uli was used to directly inscribe ( in the long axis ) the reformatter inside the volume of a 30@xmath1415@xmath141 mm substrate of borosilicate glass ( schott af45 ) @xcite with full inscription parameters reported in @xcite . at the input end of the reformatter , 92 single - mode waveguides ,",
    "each 6.2@xmath13 m in width , were arranged in a hexagonal geometry with a centre - to - centre separation of 17.6@xmath13 m ( fig .",
    "[ fig : label]f ) , to match the measured core separation of the manufactured mcf . at the pseudo - slit end of the reformatter",

    "the mcf lantern and uli reformatter component were securely bonded with uv cured adhesive to form the hybrid reformatter . as reported in more detail in @xcite , the throughput of the complete hybrid reformatter was tested in the laboratory over a wavelength of 1550@xmath020 nm to be 65@xmath02% for incoherent light .",
    "as canary is designed as an ao demonstrator it can be configured to many different modes of correction . in this case",
    "the system was configured to provide closed - loop ao correction using an on - axis natural guide star as a wavefront reference .",
    "a dichroic mirror transmits light @xmath21000 nm to the experiment with visible wavelengths reflected to a 36 sub - aperture shack - hartmann wavefront sensor ( wfs ) .",
    "a fast - steering mirror and 56-actuator deformable mirror ( dm ) are driven by the wfs measurements , providing a partially corrected psf at a wavelength of 1500 nm .",
    "a basic integrator feedback controller with a closed - loop gain of 0.3 was used to calculate the dm commands , with the wfs positioned behind the dm measuring the residual wavefront error after correction .",
    "[ fig3 ]    alignment and optimisation of the experimental system ( fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) was performed during the day using a range of sources available in the canary setup . in our case a 1550 nm laser beam coupled into a single - mode fibre was moved into the canary input focal plane , passed through the entire canary optical train , and the psf re - imaged onto the multimode input at the photonic - lantern end of the hybrid reformatter .",
    "the surface shape of the dm was modified by engaging the ao - correction loop and artificially applying static offset terms to the measured wfs signal .",
    "these offsets were automatically adjusted using the nelder - mead simplex method @xcite to alter the psf shape at the hybrid reformatter input and maximise the detected flux from its pseudo - slit output .",
    "the optimum measured wavefront values and corresponding dm shape were recorded and used as the correction reference for on - sky tests .    to investigate the effect of different degrees of ao correction on the hybrid reformatter",
    ", canary was operated in three modes .",
    "closed - loop mode provides the maximum degree of correction achievable , where both tip - tilt and higher - order wavefront aberrations were corrected with an update rate of 150hz . in tip - tilt mode the high - order ao correction of the optimised psf shape is removed by reducing the integrator loop gain to a low value ( typically 0.001 ) , with the psf location simply stabilised in real - time .",
    "open - loop mode applies the minimum correction of the three modes of operation by additionally reducing the tip - tilt correction gain .",
    "this allowed the psf to remain in the reference location for optimum coupling , but without high temporal frequency correction .",
    "as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , the on - sky experimental setup comprised two science arms and a separate reference arm .",
    "a beamsplitter ( bs1 ) was used to direct @xmath1010 % of the light within the canary psf to the reference arm , where a lens ( l7 ) formed an image of the psf onto the ingaas camera .",
    "the reference arm enabled the shape and photon flux within the psf to be ` self - referenced ' during observation , allowing the transmission of the hybrid reformatter to be measured regardless of variations in the psf . a 0.6 absorptive neutral density filter ( nd )",
    "was placed in this arm to ensure that the camera pixels did not saturate during data acquisition .",
    "h_-band spectral filter ( f ) was mounted at the entrance to the camera .",
    "a second beamsplitter ( bs2 ) was introduced to direct @xmath1081% of the remaining light into the secondary science arm where it was injected into the multimode end of a second mcf photonic lantern ( which we will call the secondary lantern ) using lens l4 .",
    "the final @xmath10  9 % of the light in the primary science arm was coupled into the hybrid reformatter using lenses l2 and l3 .",
    "the output ends of the secondary lantern and hybrid reformatter were adjacently positioned in the vertical axis such that both could be imaged _ via _ lenses l5 & l6 onto the camera simultaneously .",
    "the detector response of the ingaas camera was measured in the laboratory using a 1550 nm light emitting diode with a calibrated integrating sphere detector and found to be linear to within @xmath151% over the signal levels used throughout the experiments .        [ fig4 ]    canary provides an @xmath12f/11 beam with a plate scale value of 4.54arcsec / mm , but this is obviously altered by the input coupling optics in the two arms ( l2 to l4 in fig .",

    "the scaling of each arm was measured by taking images at the focus of each arm , while translating an ir source at another known focal plane within canary .",

    "multiple datasets were acquired , where each dataset comprised 100 near - infrared images .",
    "the camera exposure time for each image was 400ms .",
    "the background noise floor was determined through dark exposures and periodically acquiring datasets of sky background images . after acquiring an adequate number of datasets ,",
    "the hybrid reformatter and secondary lantern were removed from the primary science arm and the lens l5 was translated towards lens l3 , such that the psf could be imaged directly onto the camera through the primary science arm .",
    "additional datasets of 100 images were acquired in order to calibrate the instrument for the difference in the integrated power between the reference and primary science arms .",
    "this allowed the throughput of the hybrid reformatter to be calibrated using the star itself .",
    "the hybrid reformatter and the secondary lantern were tested on - sky at the wht on 2014 october 11 & 12 , with all data acquired between 20:30 and 22:45 gmt .",
    "the star selected for observation was tyc 3156 - 2223 - 1 ( gamma cygni ) from the tycho 2 catalogue @xcite , a @xmath16 magnitude star in the astronomical _ h_-band .",

    "the images presented here ( fig .  [ fig3 ] top ) have been averaged over 100 frames and show the pseudo - slit and secondary lantern outputs that were imaged onto the camera using the primary science arm , as well as the canary psf , which was imaged using the reference arm ( see fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) .",
    "the imperfect cleave forming the multicore end of the secondary lantern can also be seen in the images . in the case of closed - loop operation with full ao correction ,",
    "the transmission of the hybrid reformatter was measured to be 53@xmath04% . with reduced degree of atmospheric correction ,",
    "the device transmission was measured to be 47@xmath05% and 48@xmath05% in the case of tip - tilt and open - loop operation respectively .",
    "histograms of the transmission data obtained for the respective ao modes are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] bottom .    for experiments conducted on the night of 2014",
    "october 12 , the multicore end of the secondary lantern was re - cleaved to produce an improved image on the camera .",
    "as the experimental design did not allow for easy calibration of a reference psf image to be obtained in the secondary science arm , the absolute throughput of the secondary lantern was not determined .",
    "nonetheless , comparative measurements between the closed - loop and tip - tilt modes of ao operation were performed .",
    "these were taken in the same manner as the throughput measurements , with the calculated closed - loop and tip - tilt flux divided to provide a ratio of the two .",
    "these measurements revealed an averaged flux ratio of 2:1 , which is much lower than that expected , according to the area of the sampled psf in both cases . to examine this discrepancy ,",
    "an on - sky dither was performed whereby the tip - tilt mirror in the canary setup was used to move the psf by @xmath0 1.25 arcsec relative to the inputs of the hybrid reformatter and the secondary lantern , which have an effective angular size of 1.1 and 0.23 arcsec respectively .",
    "[ fig4 ] shows the results of the dither experiments for the respective devices , with each square representing the total flux of the tested device for each psf position .",
    "the centre of each plot shows the location ( in arcseconds ) of the centre of the psf as set on the bench , with the black circles representing the respective angular size of the device input .",
    "the dither plots clearly show that the actual area of maximum flux does not overlap with the expected area .",
    "this mismatch can be attributed to atmospheric refraction causing a chromatic shift between the corrected ( visible guide star ) path and the science ( near - infrared ) path and will be corrected in future experimentation .",
    "it can also be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] middle column , that the hybrid reformatter is relatively insensitive to dither position in both closed - loop and tip - tilt operating modes , with closed - loop providing approximately 35% improvement over tip - tilt correction at the optimum input position .",
    "the secondary lantern ( fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] right column ) is also insensitive in tip - tilt mode , though highly sensitive in closed - loop mode and demonstrates approximately 58% improvement in throughput between closed - loop and tip - tilt correction .",
    "this shows that if lanterns are designed for few modes they will need to be carefully matched to the ao system they sit behind . it should be noted that the dithers did not incorporate the simplexing routine that was applied during the throughput demonstration of the previous night , and so were not fully optimised for off - axis positions",
    "we have presented results from the on - sky tests of a photonic guided - wave device that spatially reformats an ao corrected telescope psf into a diffraction - limited pseudo - slit .",
    "this hybrid reformatter integrates a low - loss mcf photonic lantern that adiabatically converts the modes within the psf into a two - dimensional array of single - modes , with a uli fabricated reformatter component that spatially rearranges the single modes into a pseudo - slit waveguide that is single mode in the dispersion axis .",
    "our aim is that devices based on this concept will convert any modal - noise into amplitude and phase variations orthogonal to the dispersion axis of an instrument , and could enable high - resolution , high - stability spectrographs operating on large telescopes , or in situations where modal noise is a severe issue .",
    "the calibration tools and controls required to optimise coupling to an ao system were developed and the device performance tested for a range of modes of ao operation .",
    "the maximum on - sky throughput achieved was 53@xmath04% while the in - laboratory throughput was measured to be 65@xmath02% .",
    "this performance demonstrates a significant improvement over that achieved in our earlier demonstration of the fully integrated uli reformatter ( the photonic dicer ) .    to conclude , we believe the results presented here highlight the potential of efficiently implementing guided - wave reformatting devices in astronomy , specifically for coupling multimode light to spectrographs operating at the diffraction - limit .",
