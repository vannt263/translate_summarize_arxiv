    "with the advent of modern high - energy colliders the study of the quark gluon plasma ( qgp ) has advanced tremendously .",
    "one outstanding question that lingers , however , is to what extent can one use ideas stemming from perturbation theory for qgp phenomenology .",
    "one focal point in this regard has been high loop - order calculations of the equation of state of finite temperature and density qcd and comparison of these approximations to lattice qcd results .",
    "the perturbative calculation of qgp thermodynamics has a long history  @xcite and the perturbative expansion of the pressure of qcd at both zero  @xcite and non - zero chemical potential  @xcite are now known through order @xmath0 .",
    "however , one finds in practice that a strict expansion in the coupling constant converges only for temperatures many orders of magnitude higher than those relevant for heavy - ion collision experiments .",
    "the source of the poor convergence comes from contributions from soft momenta , @xmath1 .",
    "this suggests that one needs a reorganization of finite - temperature / density perturbation theory that treats the soft sector more carefully .",
    "there are various ways of reorganizing the finite temperature / chemical potential perturbative series . here",
    "we will focus on a method called hard - thermal - loop perturbation theory ( htlpt ) . for scalar field theories one can use a simpler variant called `` screened perturbation theory '' ( spt )  @xcite which was inspired in part by variational perturbation theory  @xcite .",
    "a gauge - invariant generalization of spt called htlpt was developed by andersen , braaten , and strickland over a decade ago  @xcite . since then htlpt has been used to calculate thermodynamic functions at one loop order  @xcite , two loop order  @xcite , and three loop order at zero chemical potential  @xcite as well as at finite chemical potential(s )  @xcite .",

    "the result for equal quark chemical potentials was first presented in ref .",
    "@xcite and the extension to flavor - dependent chemical potentials was presented in ref .",
    "@xcite . in both cases ,",
    "the resulting three - loop thermodynamic potential is renormalized using only known vacuum , mass , and coupling constant counterterms and the final result is completely analytic and gauge invariant .",
    "the resulting analytic thermodynamic potential can be used to obtain , for example , the pressure , energy density , entropy density , trace anomaly , speed of sound , and various quark number susceptibilities . as we will show below",
    ", there is good agreement between our nnlo htlpt results and lattice data down to temperatures on the order of 300 mev .",
    "below we present plots of some of our main results and refer the reader to ref .",
    "@xcite for the calculation details and a more detailed discussion of the systematic uncertainties , etc .",
    "in this section we present some of the final results from ref .  @xcite . for all results shown we used the one - loop running coupling .",
    "we fixed the scale @xmath3 by requiring that @xmath4 which is obtained from lattice measurements @xcite .",
    "for one - loop running , this procedure gives @xmath5 mev .",
    "we use two separate renormalization scales , @xmath6 and @xmath7 , for purely - gluonic and fermionic graphs , respectively .",
    "we take the central values of these renormalization scales to be @xmath8 and @xmath9 . in all plots",
    "the thick black lines indicate the result obtained using these central values and the light - blue band indicates the variation of the result under variation of both of these scales by a factor of two , e.g. @xmath10 .",
    "for all numerical results below we use @xmath11 and @xmath12 .    in fig .",
