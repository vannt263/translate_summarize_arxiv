    "in order to reveal nature of correlated electrons in condensed matters and to construct advanced models for those , one dimensional ( 1d ) electronic system as a basis of the models has been subjected for both experimental and theoretical investigations . in the experimental part",
    ", a variety of quantum phenomena has been indeed found for the quasi-1d compounds in past few decades ; tomonaga - luttinger - type electric conductivity for bavs@xmath1 @xcite , peierls instability for cugeo@xmath1 @xcite , charge- and spin - density waves for ( tmtsf)@xmath6asf@xmath7 and ttf - tcnq @xcite , spinon - holon separation for srcuo@xmath6 @xcite , haldane gap for ni(c@xmath6h@xmath8n@xmath6)@xmath6no@xmath6(clo@xmath9 ) @xcite , and superconductivity for ( tmtsf)@xmath6pf@xmath7 @xcite .",
    "these characteristic phenomena might reflect the nature of the correlated electrons , and intensive research on the materials played an important role to steadily advance understanding of the nature .",
    "we have recently been exploring novel quasi-1d compounds in order to find additional systems showing correlations among their magnetic , electronic transport properties , and crystal structure .",
    "the linear - chain cobalt oxide sr@xmath0pb@xmath1coo@xmath2 was recently discovered in a course of studies of quasi-1d magnetic materials and electrical - carrier - doped those @xcite .",
    "the polycrystalline sample of the compound was obtained by high - temperature solid - state reaction , and then subsequently investigated by x - ray diffraction , magnetic susceptibility , and thermogravimetric analysis ( tga ) studies .",
    "crystal structure was investigated in detail by powder - neutron - diffraction at 6 and 295 k. the compound was found isostructural to the 1d antiferromagnetic copper oxide sr@xmath0pb@xmath1cuo@xmath2 [ _ p_62_m _ , @xmath10 10.1089(6 )   and @xmath11 3.5585(2 )  ] , in which distorted cuo@xmath9 units are linearly connected by sharing those conner - oxygen @xcite . spin - singlet ground state , which potentially results from linear - alternation of quantum spins , was indeed suggested at the composition sr@xmath0pb@xmath12bi@xmath13cuo@xmath2 @xcite .",
    "although the title antiferromagnetic compound sr@xmath0pb@xmath1coo@xmath2 was therefore expected to present one dimensionally anisotropic magnetism , however curie - weiss(cw)-type magnetism was eventually observed even at low temperature ( @xmath14 5 k ) .",
    "the rather isotropic magnetic property probably indicates a lack of 1d - magnetic uniformity , which may be affected by high degree of structural disorder in chains , as in the bi - nondoped copper analogue @xcite . in this paper , the crystal structure and magnetic properties of the novel chain compound",
    "are reported and compared with those of the analogous copper oxides .",
    "the samples of the cobalt oxide were prepared as follows .",
    "a mixture of pure ( @xmath15 99.9 % ) and fine powders of srco@xmath1 , pbo , and co@xmath1o@xmath9 ( sr : pb : co = 5:3:1 molar ratio , @xmath167 g ) was placed in a dense - alumina crucible with a cap and heated in air at 750 @xmath17c for 19 hours .",
    "the sample was quenched at room temperature and then ground .",
    "thereafter , the powder was reheated at 850 , 900 , and 950 @xmath17c in turn for 66 hours in total .",
    "the preheated powder was then molded into several pellets , followed by heating at 970 @xmath17c for 73 hours in air .",
    "subsequently , some of the sintered pellets were annealed at 500 @xmath17c in mixed gas , 20 % oxygen in argon , at 100 mpa for 5 hours in a commercial apparatus ( hot - isostatic - pressing system , developed by kobe steel , ltd ) . to qualitatively analyze",
    "the polycrystalline samples , x - ray diffraction at room temperature with cuk@xmath18 radiation was employed . the x - ray apparatus ( rint-2000 system , developed by rigaku , co )",
    "was equipped with a graphite monochromator on the counter side and an auto - divergence - slit system .",
    "the oxygen content of the samples was measured in a commercial tga apparatus ( pyris 1 , developed by perkinelmer , inc ) by heating small amount of each sample ( powder , @xmath1620 mg ) in 3 % hydrogen in argon at a heating rate of 5 @xmath17c per minute to 700 @xmath17c and holding for 6 hours .    to investigate the crystal structure further",
    ", the sample annealed in the compressed gas was again studied by neutron diffraction .",
    "the neutron data at 6 and 295 k were obtained by the bt-1 high - resolution powder diffractometer at the nist center for neutron research .",
    "a cu(311 ) monochromator was employed to produce a coherent neutron beam ( @xmath19  ) with 15@xmath20 , 20@xmath21 , and 7@xmath22 collimators before and after the monochromator , and after the sample , respectively .",
    "the neutron diffraction patterns were measured between 8 and 160 degrees in diffraction angle at 0.05 degrees step . with the neutron profiles ,",
    "crystal structure parameters were refined to a high degree of agreement by rietveld calculations on the program gsas .",
    "the total numbers of reflection and data point were 172 and 3039 , respectively .",
    "neutron scattering amplitude in the calculations were set 0.702 , 0.940 , 0.253 , and 0.581 ( @xmath2310@xmath24 ) cm for sr , pb , co , and o , respectively @xcite .",
    "the magnetic properties of the samples were studied by a commercial apparatus ( mpms system ) between 5 and 390 k , developed by quantum design , inc .",
    "the magnetic susceptibility data were collected at 50 koe on cooling , and magnetization curves were recorded between -55 and 55 koe after cooling the each sample at 5 and 150 k. all the pellets thus obtained were too electrically insulating to be subjected for further electronic transport measurements ; beyond the 10 m@xmath25 limit of a conversional two - terminal tester at room temperature .",
    "the powder x - ray patterns of the annealed sample and the as - made sample are presented in figs.[xrd]a and [ xrd]b , respectively . recalled the hexagonal unit cell of the structure of the analogous copper oxide sr@xmath0pb@xmath1cuo@xmath2 ( _ p_62_m _ , @xmath26 10.1089(6 )   and @xmath27 3.5585(2 )  ) @xcite , a hexagonal unit cell was , at first , tested to qualitatively analyze the both patterns .",
    "almost peaks were clearly found to be at the expected positions from the hexagonal symmetry and lattice parameters , as marked by each @xmath28 notation ( fig.[xrd]a ) , except several small peaks indicated by solid stars .",
    "the lattice parameters were refined to @xmath26 10.11(1 )  and @xmath27 3.567(1 )  by a least squares fitting for the annealed sample pattern ( fig.[xrd]a ) , and @xmath26 10.12(1 )  and @xmath27 3.558(1 )  for the other ( fig.[xrd]b ) .",
    "the both patterns indicate quality of the samples . although the hexagonal model was eventually found reasonable to explain the almost x - ray peaks for the both cobalt oxides as well as the copper oxide , the star - marked minor peaks , however , remained to be uncharacterized , indicating possible presence of either small amount of impurities otherwise somewhat structural modulation .",
    "an attempt to prepare a much pure sample , which may not show the extra peaks , by means of optimizing the heating conditions and starting compositions has been made , however , that is unsuccessful thus far .    in order to measure the oxygen content of the cobalt oxide ,",
    "the tga study was made on the selected samples ; the data are shown in fig.[tga ] , where dotted and solid curves indicate weight change for the as - made and annealed samples , respectively .",
    "a clear weight loss was found above approximately 400 @xmath17c in the both measurements .",
    "based on the hypothesis that the observed weight loss is totally due to oxygen reduction , the oxygen quantity was then calculated to be 12.19 and 12.32 moles per the formula unit for the as - made and annealed samples , respectively .",
    "the high - oxygen pressure annealing does not appear to produce a significant increment of oxygen quantity in the as - made cobalt oxide .",
    "this fact is supported by the x - ray data ; rather small changes ( less than 0.25% ) in lattice parameters was found after the annealing . as the samples continue to louse those weight after the oxygen reduction completed ( null data secured the accuracy of the measurements ) , probably due to a volatility of lead , a small amount of extra loosing should be superimposed on the major steps , which may lead an over estimation somewhat into the oxygen - quantity calculations .",
    "the annealed sample was subjected to neutron diffraction study at 6 and 295 k to obtain details of the local - chain structure and degree of oxygen nonstoichiometry .",
    "the analysis of the neutron data using the rietveld technique fundamentally followed the way developed in the structural studies on the analogous copper oxide sr@xmath0pb@xmath1cuo@xmath2 @xcite . as a result",
    ", a good achievement was successfully obtained by the rietveld calculations on the neutron profiles ( fig.[ndp ] ) , suggests the average crystal structural model ( _ p_62_m _ ) is reliable with the cobalt oxide as well as the copper oxide @xcite . in the main panel of fig.[ndp ] , the observed and calculated profiles are presented at the best quality ( 57 % levels in agreement factors ) . shown below the profiles as a deference plot between those , quality of the refinement is indeed on a convincing level .",
    "the structure parameters at the best quality are listed in table [ table1 ] , and selected interatomic distances and bond angles were calculated from the parameters ( table [ table2 ] ) .",
    "lattice constants at 295 k of the hexagonal unit cell are @xmath10 10.1093(2 )   and @xmath11 3.562 51(9 )  , which essentially meet the x - ray parameters .    during the refinements ,",
    "temporary fits using unfixed isotropic - atomic - displacement parameters and occupancy factors for o(4 ) and o(5 ) had lead only incredible results , probably due to too low levels of those occupancy factors less than 0.1 . the situation was not improved even for the low temperature data .",
    "the isotropic atomic displacement parameters at the oxygen sites o(4 ) and o(5 ) were , therefore , fixed at a conceivable level , 2.0 @xmath29 ( 1.2 @xmath29 at 6 k ) ; calculations thereafter appeared to improve the situation . due to the same reasons , the occupancy factor of o(5 )",
    "was constrained to be equal to that of o(4 ) .",
    "the occupancy factors of o(2 ) and o(3 ) , the normally occupied sites , were fixed to be fully occupied in the final calculation because oxygen vacancy was found within one standard deviation of 1.00 . the possible",
    "mixing between sr and pb was tested in preliminary manner , however substantial degree of the mixing was not detected .",
    "the displacement parameter of co is unusually large , probably reflecting the local structure disorder as in the copper oxide @xcite .",
    "the occupancy factors in the partially occupied sites , o(1 ) , o(4 ) , and o(5 ) , are slightly higher than the expected values 2/3 , 1/12 , and 1/12 , respectively , from the oxygen - stoichiometric composition 12 moles per the formula unit .",
    "the oxygen quantity calculated from the present neutron parameters is 12.42 moles per the formula unit .",
    "although the estimation from the neutron data matches that of the tga data ( 12.32 moles ) within 1 % level , we believe the oxygen quantity may be slightly overestimated because the occupancy factors of o(4 ) and o(5 ) are too low to be accurate . as the neutron diffraction study on the copper oxide did not help to figure out the probable local - structure disorders and oxygen nonstoichiometry @xcite , further attentions on the present analysis , including calculations with anisotropically thermal parameters of metals , did not shed light on the problems , either .",
    "the oxygen composition of the cobalt oxide might be slightly superstoichiometric ( @xmath30 12.4 ) , but not far from the stoichiometric sr@xmath0pb@xmath1coo@xmath2 . to determine the oxygen quantity conclusively",
    ", further investigations would be required after much high - pure sample becomes available .",
    "schematic structural views of sr@xmath0pb@xmath1coo@xmath2 were drawn from the neutron data ( 295 k ) in figs.[structure]a and [ structure]b .",
    "it is clear that the cobalt compound has a linear - chain structure basis , in which cobalt  oxygen polyhedra form chains at inter - chain distance of 10.1   @xcite .",
    "a part of the chain along @xmath31axis is presented in fig.[structure]b .",
    "all of cobalt and oxygen sites are shown by the dotted circles smaller and larger , respectively , and a probable arrangement of those atoms is indicated by solid and filled circles .",
    "intolerably short bond distances ( table [ table2 ] ) between cobalt and oxygen atoms were precluded from making the arrangement .",
    "the irregular arrangement of cobalt atoms , as shown in fig.[structure]b , and probable presence of local displacements of atoms may account for the observed unusually large atomic displacement parameters in the average - structure data such as 3.8 @xmath29 and 2.9 @xmath29 for co and o(1 ) , respectively .",
    "the @xmath31axis constant ( 3.56251(9 )  ) reflects the average of co to co distances in the chains ; almost are close to @xmath163.56  ,  but few parts at @xmath162.61  may be somewhat involved .",
    "since the oxygen - coordination environment of all cobalt atoms is not unique , a degree of magnetic uniformity of the present chain compound might be as low as that of the copper oxide sr@xmath0pb@xmath1cuo@xmath2 , far rather than other well - studied spin - chain compounds @xcite .",
    "the low - temperature structure was investigated at 6 k ( inset of fig.[ndp ] ) in the same manner , and the obtained structure parameters , calculated interatomic distances and bond angles are summarized in tables [ table1 ] and [ table2 ] as well .",
    "the hexagonal unit cell slightly shrinks ( 0.21 % along @xmath32axis and 0.17 % along @xmath31axis ) by the cooling , while the co site splitting is much conspicuous than that at 295 k ( + 11.5 % in splitting distance ) as shown in figs.[chain]a and [ chain]b .",
    "any traces of magnetic ordering were not detected in the diffraction profiles .",
    "the magnetic - susceptibility data of the samples annealed ( open circles ) and as - made ( closed circles ) are shown in fig.[magnetic ] ; @xmath33 vs @xmath34 and @xmath33 vs @xmath35 are plotted in the main panel and the inset , respectively .",
    "the data of magnetic field dependence of the magnetization at 5 and 150 k are shown in fig.[mh ] . seen in the main panel of fig.[magnetic ] , the inverse magnetic susceptibility is linearly dependent on temperature above approximately 130 k for both samples .",
    "the cw law was , then , applied to analyze the two sets of the high - temperature portion of the data .",
    "the formula to fit the data by a least - squares method , as indicated by the solid lines ( main panel of fig.[magnetic ] ) , was @xmath36 where @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath3 , @xmath39 , and @xmath40 were weiss temperature , temperature - independent term , effective magnetic moment , boltzmann constant , and avogadro s constant , respectively . in a preliminary fit , the temperature - independent term @xmath41 was estimated to be on the order of 10@xmath42 emu / mol - co , which was negligibly small , and then we decided not to employ the second term in eq.[cw ] hereafter .",
    "the subsequent fits yielded @xmath3 of 3.64 @xmath4 per co and @xmath37 of -38.8 k for the annealed sample , and @xmath3 of 3.83 @xmath4 per co and @xmath37 of -44.5 k for the as - made sample , those parameters were characteristic of antiferromagnetic interaction .",
    "as the oxygen stoichiometry is approximate at about 3% level ( 12 to 12.4 moles per the formula unit ) , the formal valence of oxygen also becomes approximate about + 2 to + 2.8 , when the valence of lead is + 4 .",
    "due to the rather large degree of uncertainty of the valence of cobalt at about 40% level , it is unable to determine the electronic configuration of cobalt solely from the magnetic susceptibility data .",
    "further investigations , including spectroscopic studies , might help to make clear the issue .",
    "seen in fig.[magnetic ] , a characteristic maximum expected from 1d antiferromagnetism in @xmath33 vs @xmath35 plot for either bonner - fisher or spin - gap models was not observed at all , although the chains were substantially antiferromagnetic @xcite . below approximately 100 k ,",
    "the inverse magnetic susceptibility gradually starts to apart from the cw line to go down on cooling , indicative of gradual growth of a ferromagnetic component in short range . to study the low - temperature portion further ,",
    "the brillouin function was employed to make comparison with the magnetization data at 5 k ( fig.[mh ] ) .",
    "the function to calculate the ideal @xmath43 vs @xmath44 curve at 5 k for free spins ( @xmath45 ) was @xmath46 where @xmath47 .",
    "the effective @xmath45 was estimated to be @xmath161.39 for the annealed and @xmath161.48 for the as - made samples from calculations using the formula @xmath48 and the @xmath3 parameters , obtained by the cw fits .",
    "the computed curves for free spins at the both @xmath45 vales are shown in fig.[mh ] . due to the substantial antiferromagnetic interactions ,",
    "the magnetization at 50 koe for the cobalt oxides is reduced to approximately one third of that for the ideal - free - spin system .",
    "although the absolute weiss temperatures are much higher than the studied temperature 5 k , the magnetization depends on applied field with rather positive curvature than linear relationship , which may indicate somewhat an influence of the ferromagnetic spin coupling ( fig.[mh ] ) .",
    "these observations , including the deviation from the cw line on cooling , suggest that minor ferromagnetic interactions coexist with the antiferromagnetism , and might help to destroy the potential 1d - antiferromagnetic characters .",
    "since the chain involves local - structure disorder and potentially be modulated , characters of all probable magnetic bonds were unable to be uniquely determined in this way .",
    "the observed @xmath37 , which is apparently negative , is probably due to a balance between the major antiferromagnetic and the possible minor ferromagnetic interactions .",
    "the observed ferromagnetic component , otherwise , results from minor magnetic impurities .    in summary ,",
    "we have reported the average structure and the magnetic properties for the quasi-1d novel cobalt oxide . due to the probable presence of local - structure disorders such as the local displacement of cobalt and ligand oxygens , and the irregular arrangement of cobalt - oxygen polyhedra in short range , degree of magnetic coherence",
    "should not be as high as expected to the low dimensional magnetism .",
    "the local structure is too complicated to be clearly observed by the neutron diffraction which probes a positional average of the structure .",
    "further studies with local structural and magnetic probes , more sensitive to the microscopic magnetic environment , could clarify the probable coupling between the local - structure disorders and the rather unusual magnetism .",
