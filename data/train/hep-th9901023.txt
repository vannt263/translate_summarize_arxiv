    "1 + 1  dimensional models have pointed out many subtleties in the computation of one - loop fermionic quantum corrections to the energies of classical field configurations .",
    "many works , usually in the context of supersymmetric theories @xcite , have reached conflicting conclusions about the correct boundary conditions , regularization and renormalization procedures , and bound state and continuum contributions . since the one - loop energy is given by the cancellation of a divergent sum of zero - point energies against a divergent counterterm",
    ", one must be extremely careful to fix the counterterm with a definite renormalization scheme in order to obtain a physically meaningful result .    in this paper",
    "we extend the methods of ref .",
    "@xcite to this case .",
    "we again find that 1 + 1  dimensional models provide an excellent testing ground for our methods , and can give considerable insight into the causes and resolutions of the disagreements among the previous results . as in our previous works",
    ", we will use a continuum formalism based on phase shifts , their born approximations , and levinson s theorem . relying on such physical quantities results in a procedure that is both analytically unambiguous and numerically robust . as a result",
    ", we will be able to compare numerical results in generic , but not exactly soluble cases to analytic results in specific , exactly soluble cases .",
    "we will consider a majorana fermion coupled to a real scalar background field , with a definite choice of bosonic and fermionic potentials , though our method applies equally well for any other choice of potentials , as well as for complex scalars and dirac fermions ( including cases without @xmath0 or @xmath1 invariance ) .",
    "we will consider a continuous sequence of scalar field configurations that interpolates between a trivial background and a widely separated soliton / antisoliton pair , always with the same , trivial field configuration as @xmath2 . in this way we can unambiguously track physical quantities such as phase shifts and bound state energies , staying in the trivial sector of the theory throughout the process . in so doing , we obtain results numerically that continuously approach the results obtained analytically in ref .  @xcite .    in  ii we develop the methods we will need to compute phase shifts , which in turn allow us to compute the renormalized one - loop energy as a sum over zero - point energies @xmath3 . in ",
    "iii we apply these methods to the specific sequence of field configurations we have chosen and obtain numerical and analytical results . in  iv we summarize our results , and connect them to previous and future works .",
    "the appendix contains techniques parallel to those of ",
    "ii but for a single soliton instead of a soliton / antisoliton pair .",
    "we consider a majorana fermion @xmath4 interacting with a scalar background field @xmath5 , with the classical lagrangian density @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the lagrangian density for the @xmath5 background field .",
    "as discussed in the introduction , we can treat any bosonic potential . to be specific",
    ", we choose @xmath8 which has classical soliton ( antisoliton ) solutions satisfying @xmath9 giving @xmath10 for the most part , we will be treating @xmath5 as a classical background , so that its dynamics will be unimportant .",
    "however , we note that choosing the lagrangian density of eq .",
    "( [ lphi ] ) causes the bosonic and fermionic degrees of freedom to be related by supersymmetry for a background field that is a solution to the equations of motion ( such as a single soliton or an infinitely separated soliton / antisoliton pair ) . in",
    "what follows , we will find it instructive to compare the bosonic and fermionic small oscillations spectra .",
    "the supersymmetric model is discussed in more detail in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the one - loop corrections to the energy due to fermionic fluctuations will be given by the appropriately renormalized sum of the zero - point energies , @xmath3 , of the fermionic small oscillations .",
    "the spectrum of fermionic small oscillations in a background @xmath11 is given by the dirac equation , @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the fermionic potential and @xmath14 is the momentum labeling the scattering states .",
    "we will choose the convention @xmath15 and @xmath16 so that the majorana condition becomes simply @xmath17 .",
    "we note that since our lagrangian is @xmath1 invariant , all of our results for the spectrum of a majorana fermion can be extended to a dirac fermion simply by doubling",
    ".    our primary tool for analyzing the small oscillations will be the phase shifts .",
    "we can solve for the phase shifts of any fermionic potential @xmath18 that satisfies @xmath19 and @xmath20 as @xmath2 by generalizing the methods of ref .",
    "@xcite to fermions .",
    "this form will be useful for considering our example of a sequence of background field configurations that continuously interpolates between the trivial vacuum and a widely separated soliton - antisoliton pair . in the limit of infinite separation",
    ", the phase shift for the pair goes to twice the result for a single soliton . for comparison",
    ", we also do the computation for a single soliton directly in the appendix .",
    "we define the parity operator acting on fermionic states as @xmath21 , where @xmath22 sends @xmath23 .",
    "@xmath24 commutes with the hamiltonian , so parity is a good quantum number . as a result , we can separate the small oscillations into positive and negative parity channels , now restricted to @xmath25 in the continuum .",
    "we parameterize the fermion wavefunction by @xmath26 where @xmath27 and @xmath28 and @xmath29 are complex functions of @xmath30 .",
    "we then find the phase shift in each channel @xmath31 by solving eq .",
    "( [ diraceq ] ) subject to the boundary conditions @xmath32 we obtain @xmath33 where @xmath34 and @xmath35 satisfies @xmath36 with the boundary condition that @xmath35 and @xmath37 vanish at infinity .",
    "the total phase shift is given by summing the phase shifts in each channel , @xmath38 .",
    "our calculation also requires us to find the bound state energies , which we do by solving eq .",
    "( [ diraceq ] ) using ordinary `` shooting '' methods . however , once we know the phase shifts , levinson s theorem tells us how many bound states there will be .",
    "it works exactly the same way as in the bosonic case @xcite : in the odd parity channel , the number of bound states @xmath39 is given by @xmath40 while in the even parity channel the number of bound states @xmath41 is given by @xmath42 one can derive this result either by the same jost function methods used in the boson case , or by observing that at small @xmath43 , the nonrelativistic approximation becomes valid so the bosonic results carry over directly . for a particular potential there may exist a @xmath44 state in either of the two channels whose dirac wavefunction goes to a constant spinor as @xmath2 .",
    "( generically , for @xmath44 the components of the dirac wavefunction go to straight lines as @xmath2 , but not lines with zero slope . )",
    "just as in the bosonic case , such threshold states ( which we term `` half bound states '' ) should be counted with a factor of @xmath45 in levinson s theorem .    given the phase shifts and bound state energies , we can calculate the one - loop fermionic correction to the energy .",
    "we work in a simple renormalization scheme in which we add a counterterm proportional to @xmath46 , and perform no further renormalizations .",
    "the counterterm is fixed by requiring that the tadpole graph cancel .",
    "we must sum the zero - point energies @xmath47 of the small oscillations , subtract the same sum for the free case , and add the contribution of the counterterm . as in ref .",
    "@xcite , we use the density of states @xmath48 to write @xmath49 where @xmath50 and the sum over @xmath51 counts bound states with appropriate factors of @xmath45 as discussed above .",
    "next , we use eq .",
    "( [ lev1 ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ lev2 ] ) to rewrite this expression as @xmath52 the ( divergent ) contribution from the tadpole graph is given by the leading born approximation to @xmath53 .",
    "since we have chosen the counterterm to exactly cancel the tadpole graph , we can rewrite the counterterm contribution in terms of the born approximation , giving @xmath54 where the subtraction @xmath55 consists of the first born approximation to @xmath56 plus the part of the second born approximation related by @xmath57 symmetry , @xmath58 which can also be obtained numerically by iterating eq .",
    "( [ nueq ] ) . as expected , it is indeed proportional to @xmath59 .",
    "we study a sequence of background fields labeled by a parameter @xmath60 that continuously interpolates from the trivial vacuum @xmath61 at @xmath62 to a widely separated soliton / antisoliton pair at @xmath63 , @xmath64    @xmath65    fig .",
    "[ boundf ] shows the fermionic bound state energies as a function of @xmath60 . in the limit @xmath66 two bound states approach energy @xmath67",
    "these are simply the odd and even parity combinations of the single soliton bound state at @xmath67 .",
    "the third ( positive parity ) bound state approaches @xmath68 where the single soliton also has a bound state , but there is only _",
    "one _ such state ( with @xmath69 ) .",
    "this is consistent with the result obtained analytically in ref .  @xcite . as emphasized in ref .",
    "@xcite , for a single soliton we must thus count the zero mode with a factor of @xmath45 .    for any finite @xmath70 , levinson s theorem holds without subtleties ; there are no states that require factors of @xmath45 .",
    "thus for a large but finite @xmath70 , we find @xmath71 consistent with having two positive parity and one negative parity bound states ( see fig .  [ boundf ] ) . in the limit @xmath66 , an even parity `` half - bound '' threshold state enters the spectrum at @xmath72 just as in the bosonic case @xcite .",
    "also , in this limit , the lowest ( positive parity ) mode approaches @xmath73 , and is only counted as a @xmath45 as described above .",
    "finally , a negative parity mode enters the spectrum from below , also to be weighted by @xmath45 .",
    "thus the net change is to add half of a negative parity state , which via levinson s theorem requires the phase shift @xmath74 to jump from @xmath75 to @xmath76 as @xmath63 .",
    "this jump occurs by the same continuous but nonuniform process as in all cases where a new state gets bound , which is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ phasefa ] . just as in the bosonic case , in the limit of infinite separation",
    "the potential we have chosen becomes reflectionless , which requires @xmath77 .",
    "@xmath78    @xmath79    to contrast the behavior of the zero modes , fig .",
    "[ boundb ] shows @xmath80 for the bound states of the bosonic small oscillations @xcite . because we have chosen the bosonic potential to be consistent with supersymmetry , the bosonic and fermionic spectra are related .",
    "again as @xmath81 the bound state energies approach those of the single soliton , and the wavefunctions are formed from the odd and even combinations of the wavefunctions for the single soliton . however , we see that in the boson case both the mode at @xmath82 and the mode at @xmath68 are doubled , so there is no factor of @xmath45 in counting the bosonic zero modes . for @xmath60 above approximately @xmath83 , the system is unstable with respect to small oscillations in one direction in field space . this property",
    "is reflected in the lowest bound state having @xmath84 @xcite .",
    "just as in the fermionic case , in the limit @xmath66 , a `` half - bound '' state enters the spectrum at @xmath85 , and the phase shifts in the two channels become equal as the potential becomes reflectionless .",
    "@xmath86    fig .",
    "[ energyf ] shows the values of @xmath87 we obtain from eq .",
    "( [ totenergy ] ) as a function of @xmath60 . in the @xmath66 limit",
    ", we can also do the calculation analytically @xcite .",
    "we find a phase shift @xmath88 with born approximation @xmath89 and contributions from two bound states at @xmath90 and one at @xmath72 .",
    "we thus find @xmath91 which agrees with the numerical calculation . as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , the bosonic contribution to the energy is @xmath92 in this limit , giving a total of @xmath93 for the soliton / antisoliton pair in the supersymmetric model , in agreement with ref .",
    "we have shown how to compute one - loop fermionic contributions to the energies of symmetric background field configurations . taking these methods together with those of ref .",
    "@xcite , one can calculate the energy of a localized field configuration in any model of scalars and spinors in 1 + 1  dimensions .",
    "this procedure implements standard renormalization conditions without ambiguity and lends itself to robust and efficient numerical calculation .",
    "a natural extension of this work is to treat translationally invariant classical field configurations .",
    "long ago , christ and lee showed how to quantize the small fluctuations about momentum eigenstates formed by taking superpositions of _ solutions _ to the classical equations of motion at different positions @xcite .",
    "new problems arise when studying the effects of translation invariance upon fluctuations about time - independent classical field configurations that are not solutions to the classical equations of motion .",
    "work is underway to extend the above techniques to the nonlocal potentials encountered in this case @xcite .",
    "we wish to thank our colleagues , eddie farhi , dan freedman and jeffrey goldstone for comments and suggestions on this work .",
    "we thank lai - him chan for finding an error in our numerical calculations by comparing our results with those of @xcite .",
    "as a check on the calculations presented in the body of the paper , we present the properties ( phase shifts , eigenenergies , etc . ) for a single soliton directly . in this case",
    ", we have a potential that satisfies @xmath94 with @xmath95 as @xmath2 .",
    "we will use the bosonic potentials that we obtain by squaring the dirac equation to obtain a result that agrees with the previous method in the limit of a widely separated soliton / antisoliton pair .",
    "we find @xmath96 where @xmath97 and @xmath98 are bosonic potentials .",
    "since @xmath18 is antisymmetric , both @xmath99 and @xmath100 are symmetric .",
    "we decompose their solutions ( as bosonic potentials ) into symmetric and antisymmetric channels . for @xmath2 , we have @xmath101 where the arbitrary factors of @xmath102 are inserted for convenience later . by the ( first - order ) dirac equation , for all @xmath30 , @xmath103 and @xmath104",
    "so that the solutions to the dirac equation are @xmath105 and @xmath106 the phase relation between the upper and lower components of these wavefunctions must be different as @xmath2 since the mass term has opposite signs in these two limits .",
    "putting this all together gives , as @xmath2 , @xmath107 and thus @xmath108 and similarly @xmath109 the fermion phase shift in each channel is given by the average of the bosonic phase shifts of the two components @xmath110 so that @xmath111    we note that in this case there is always a zero - energy bound state given by @xmath112 because it is at zero energy , this state is shared with the antiparticle spectrum and thus only contributes with a weight of @xmath45 to levinson s theorem and the sum over small oscillations , as we found by following a soliton / antisoliton pair as a function of separation .",
    "the extra @xmath113 ( which goes to @xmath114 as @xmath115 ) is thus necessary to connect the fermionic phase shift to bosonic phase shifts , which have no such factors of @xmath45 associated with their zero modes .",
