    "one of the central problems of particle physics is to understand how the electroweak scale associated with the mass of the w boson is generated , and why it is so small as compared to the planck scale associated with the newton s constant . in the standard model ( sm ) the electroweak scale is generated through the vacuum expectation value ( vev ) of the neutral component of a higgs doublet @xcite .",
    "apart from the fact that this vev is an arbitrary parameter in the sm , the mass parameter of the higgs field suffers from quadratic divergences , making the weak scale unstable under radiative corrections .",
    "supersymmetry is at present the only known framework in which the weak scale is stable under radiative corrections @xcite , although it does not explain how such a small scale arises in the first place . as such",
    ", considerable importance attaches to the study of supersymmetric models , especially the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) , based on the gauge group @xmath1 , with two higgs doublet superfields .",
    "it is well known that , because of underlying gauge invariance and supersymmetry ( susy ) , the lightest higgs boson in mssm has a tree level upper bound of @xmath2 ( the mass of z boson ) on its mass @xcite .",
    "although radiative corrections @xcite to the tree level result can be appreciable , these depend only logarithmically on the susy breaking scale , and are , therefore , under control .",
    "this results in an upper bound of about @xmath3 gev on the one - loop radiatively corrected mass @xcite of the lightest higgs boson in mssm gev as compared to its one - loop value @xcite . ] . because of the presence of the additional trilinear yukawa couplings , such a tight constraint on the mass of the lightest higgs boson need not _ a priori _ hold in extensions of mssm based on the gauge group @xmath1 with an extended higgs sector .",
    "nevertheless , it has been shown that the upper bound on the lightest higgs boson mass in these models depends only on the weak scale , and dimensionless coupling constants ( and only logarithmically on the susy breaking scale ) , and is calculable if all the couplings remain perturbative below some scale @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "this upper bound can vary between @xmath5 gev to @xmath6 gev depending on the higgs structure of the underlying supersymmetric model .",
    "thus , nonobservation of such a light higgs boson below this upper bound will rule out an entire class of supersymmetric models based on the gauge group @xmath7 .",
    "the existence of the upper bound on the lightest higgs boson mass in mssm ( with arbitrary higgs sectors ) has been investigated in a situation where the underlying supersymmetric model respects baryon ( @xmath8 ) and lepton ( @xmath9 ) number conservation .",
    "however , it is well known that gauge invariance , supersymmetry and renormalizibility allow @xmath8 and @xmath9 violating terms in the superpotentioal of the mssm @xcite .",
    "the strength of these lepton and baryon number violating terms is , however , severely limited by phenomenological @xcite , and cosmological @xcite constraints . indeed ,",
    "unless the strength of baryon - number violating term is less than @xmath10 , it will lead to contradiction with the present lower limits on the lifetime of the proton .",
    "the usual strategy to prevent the appearance of @xmath8 and @xmath9 violating couplings in mssm is to invoke a discrete @xmath11 symmetry @xcite known as matter parity , or r - parity .",
    "the matter parity of each superfield may be defined as @xmath12 the multiplicative conservation of matter parity forbids all the renormalizable @xmath8 and @xmath9 violating terms in the superpotential of mssm .",
    "equivalently , the r - parity of any component _ field _ is defined by @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the spin of the field . since @xmath15 is conserved in any lorentz - invariant interaction , matter parity conservation and r - parity conservation are equivalent .",
    "conservation of r - parity then immediately implies that superpartners can be produced only in pairs , and that the lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) is absolutely stable .",
    "although the minimal supersymmetric standard model with r - parity conservation can provide a description of nature which is consistent with all known observations , the assumption of @xmath16 conservation appears to be _ ad hoc _ , since it is not required for the internal consistency of mssm .",
    "furthermore , all global symmetries , discrete or continuous , could be violated by the planck scale physics effects @xcite .",
    "the problem becomes acute for low energy supersymmetric models , because @xmath8 and @xmath9 are no longer automatic symmetries of the lagrangian , as they are in the standard model .",
    "it is , therefore , more appealing to have a supersymmetric theory where r - parity is related to a gauge symmetry , and its conservation is automatic because of the invariance of the underlying theory under this gauge symmetry .",
    "fortunately , there is a compelling scenario which does provide for exact r - parity conservation due to a deeper principle .",
    "indeed , @xmath16 conservation follows automatically in certain theories with gauged @xmath17 , as is suggested by the fact that matter parity is simply a @xmath11 subgroup of @xmath17 .",
    "it has been noted by several authors @xcite that if the gauge symmetry of mssm is extended to @xmath18 , or @xmath19 , the theory becomes automatically r - parity conserving .",
    "such a left - right supersymmetric theory ( slrm ) solves the problems of explicit @xmath8 and @xmath9 violation of mssm , and has received much attention recently @xcite .",
    "of course left - right symmetric theories are also interesting in their own right , for among other appealing features , they offer a simple and natural explanation for the smallness of neutrino mass through the so called see - saw mechanism @xcite .",
    "such a naturally r - parity conserving theory necessarily involves the extension of the standard model gauge group , and since the extended gauge symmetry has to be broken , it involves a `` new scale '' , the scale of left - right symmetry breaking , beyond the susy and @xmath7 breaking scales of mssm . in @xcite",
    "we showed that in the slrm with minimal particle content the upper bound on the mass of the lightest neutral higgs boson depends only on gauge couplings and those vevs which break the @xmath20 symmetry . here",
    "we will present a detailed analysis of the higgs sector of the left - right supersymmetric models , and consider some of the distinguishing features of the lightest higgs boson in these models . in the slrms",
    "there are typically also other light higgs particles .",
    "the light doubly charged higgs boson , which we will consider in detail as well , should provide a clear signal in experiments .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows . in section [ sec : tree ]",
    ", we review the various left - right supersymmetric models that we consider in this paper . in section [ sec : higgs ] , we obtain the tree level upper bound on the mass of the lightest cp - even higgs boson for the various slrms considered in section [ sec : tree ]",
    ". we use a general procedure to obtain this ( tree - level ) upper bound on the mass of the lightest cp - even higgs boson in models with extended gauge groups , such as slrms .",
    "we show that the upper bound so obtained in the renormalizable models is independent of the supersymmetry breaking scale , as well as the left - right breaking scale . in the case of models containing non - renormalizable terms , although the upper bound depends on the left - right breaking scale , the dependence is extremely weak , being suppressed by powers of planck mass .    in section [ sec : rad ]",
    "we calculate the radiative corrections to the upper bound on the mass of the lightest higgs boson , and show that the most important radiative corrections arising from quark - squark loops are of the same type as in the mssm based on @xmath21 .",
    "the radiatively corrected upper bound so obtained is numerically considerably larger than the corresponding bound in the mssm , but for most of the parameter space is below 200 gev . in section [ sec : decoup ]",
    "we consider the branching ratios of the lightest neutral higgs boson , and find that its couplings are similar to the corresponding higgs couplings in the standard model in the decoupling limit .    in section [ sec",
    ": double ] we discuss the mass of the lightest doubly charged higgs boson and the possibility of its detection at colliders . in section [ sec : conclusion ] , we present our conclusions . the full scalar potential of the minimal supersymmetric left - right model is presented in the appendix a.",
    "in this section we briefly review the minimal supersymmetric left - right model , and then discuss models which have an extended higgs sector , and finally discuss models with non - renormalizable interaction terms in the superpotential .",
    "the minimal slrm is based on the gauge group @xmath22 .",
    "the matter fields of this model consist of the three families of quark and lepton chiral superfields with the following transformation properties under the gauge group : @xmath23 where the numbers in the brackets denote the quantum numbers under @xmath22 .",
    "the higgs sector consists of the bidoublet and triplet higgs superfields : @xmath24 there are two bidoublet superfields in order to implement the @xmath7 breaking , and to generate a nontrivial kobayashi - maskawa matrix .",
    "furthermore , two @xmath25 higgs triplet superfields @xmath26 and @xmath27 with opposite @xmath17 are necessary to break the left - right symmetry spontaneously , and to cancel triangle gauge anomalies due to the fermionic superpartners .",
    "the gauge symmetry is supplemented by a discrete left - right symmetry under which the fields can be chosen to transform as @xmath28 thus , the @xmath29 triplets @xmath30 and @xmath31 are needed in order to make the lagrangian fully symmetric under @xmath32 transformation , although these are not needed phenomenologically for symmetry breaking , or the see - saw mechanism .    the most general gauge invariant superpotential involving these superfields can be written as ( generation indices suppressed ) @xmath33 the scalar potential can be calculated from @xmath34 where @xmath35 , @xmath36 , and @xmath37 represent the contribution of @xmath38-terms , the @xmath39-terms , and the soft susy breaking terms , respectively . the full scalar potential can be found in appendix a. the general form of the vacuum expectation values of the various scalar fields which preserve the @xmath40 gauge invariance can be written as @xmath41 we note that the triplet vacuum expectation values @xmath42 and @xmath43 represent the scale of @xmath25 breaking and are , according to the lower bounds @xcite on heavy w- and z - boson masses , in the range @xmath44 tev .",
    "these represent a new scale , the right - handed breaking scale .",
    "we note that @xmath45 and @xmath46 contribute to the mixing of the charged gauge bosons and to the flavour changing neutral currents , and are usually assumed to vanish . furthermore , since the electroweak @xmath47 parameter is close to unity , @xmath48 @xcite , the triplet vacuum expectation values @xmath49 and @xmath50 must be small .",
    "the yukawa coupling @xmath51 is proportional to the neutrino dirac mass @xmath52 .",
    "the light neutrino mass in the see - saw mechanism is given by @xmath53 , where @xmath54 is the majorana mass .",
    "the magnitude of @xmath51 is not accurately determined given the present upper limit on the light neutrino masses .",
    "on the other hand the yukawa coupling @xmath55 is proportional to the electron mass and is , thus , small .    in the minimal model described above",
    ", parity can not be spontaneously broken at the renormalizable level without spontaneous breaking of @xmath56-parity .",
    "this may be cured by adding more fields to the theory . in @xcite",
    "it was suggested that a parity - odd singlet , coupled appropriately to triplet fields , be introduced so as to ensure proper symmetry breaking .",
    "this leads to a set of degenerate minima connected by a flat direction , all of them breaking parity .",
    "when soft susy breaking terms are switched on , the degeneracy is lifted , but the global minimum that results breaks @xmath40 .",
    "because of the flat direction connecting the minima , there is no hope that the fields remain in the phenomenologically acceptable vacuum , which rolls down to global minimum after susy is softly broken .",
    "the only option that is left is to have a relatively low @xmath25 breaking scale , with spontaneously broken @xmath56-parity ( @xmath57 is non - zero ) .",
    "we note that present experiments allow for a low @xmath25 breaking scale .",
    "there is an alternative to the minimal left - right supersymmetric model which involves the addition of a couple of triplet fields , @xmath58 and @xmath59 , instead of a singlet higgs superfield , to the minimal model @xcite . in these extended models",
    "the breaking of @xmath25 is achieved in two stages . in the first stage",
    "the gauge group @xmath19 is broken to an intermediate symmetry group @xmath60 , and at the second stage @xmath61 is broken to @xmath62 at a lower scale . in this theory there is only one parity - breaking minimum , in contrast to the minimal model , which respects the electromagnetic gauge invariance .",
    "the superpotential for this class of models obtains additional terms involving the triplet fields @xmath63 and @xmath64 : @xmath65 where @xmath66 is the superpotential ( [ eq : superpotential ] ) of the minimal left - right model . in these models",
    "the see - saw mechanism takes its canonical form with @xmath67 , where @xmath52 is the neutrino dirac mass . in this case",
    "the low - energy effective theory is the mssm with unbroken @xmath56-parity , and contains besides the usual mssm states , a triplet of higgs scalars much lighter than the @xmath68 breaking scale .",
    "a second option is to add non - renormalizable terms to the lagrangian of the minimal left - right supersymmetric model , while retaining the minimal higgs content @xcite the superpotential for this class of models can be written as @xmath69    \\nonumber \\\\   & & + { \\lambda_{ijkl}\\over   m}{\\rm tr}\\,i\\tau_2 \\phi_i^t i\\tau_2 \\phi_j{\\rm tr}\\,i\\tau_2 \\phi_k^t i\\tau_2 \\phi_l + { \\alpha_{ijl}\\over m } { \\rm tr}\\ , \\delta_l   \\delta_l \\phi_i i\\tau_2 \\phi_j^t i\\tau_2    \\nonumber\\\\ & & +   { \\alpha_{ijr}\\over m } { \\rm tr}\\ , \\delta_r   \\delta_r   i\\tau_2 \\phi_i^t i\\tau_2 \\phi_j   + { 1 \\over m}{\\rm tr}\\,\\tau_2 \\phi_i^t \\tau_2 \\phi_j [ \\beta_{ijl } { \\rm tr}\\ , \\delta_l   \\delta_l + \\beta_{ijr } { \\rm tr}\\ , \\delta_r \\delta_r ] \\nonumber \\\\ & & +   { \\eta_{ij } \\over m } { \\rm tr}\\,\\phi_i   \\delta_r i\\tau_2",

    "\\label{nonsuperpot}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] it has been shown that the addition of non - renormalizable terms suppressed by a high scale such as planck mass , @xmath70 gev , with the minimal field content ensures the correct pattern of symmetry breaking in the supersymmetric left - right model .",
    "in particular the scale of parity breakdown is predicted to be in the intermediate region @xmath71 gev , and @xmath56-parity remains exact .",
    "this theory contains singly charged and doubly charged higgs scalars with a mass of order @xmath72 , which may be experimentally accessible .",
    "however , what is different is the nature of see - saw mechanism .",
    "whereas in the renormalizable version the see - saw mechanism takes its canonical form , in the non - renormalizable case it takes a form similar to what occurs in the non - supersymmetric left - right models , with the neutrino mass depending on the unknown parameters of the higgs potential .",
    "this in general leads to different neutrino mass spectra , which can be experimentally distinguished .",
    "given the fact that the higgs sector of slrm models contain a large number of higgs multiplets , and the vevs of some of the higgs fields involve possibly large mass scales compared to the electroweak and susy breaking scales , it is important to ask what is the mass of the lightest higgs boson in these models .",
    "the upper bound on the lightest higgs boson mass in the minimal model was derived in @xcite in the limit when @xmath73 , using the fact that for any hermitean matrix the smallest eigenvalue must be smaller than that of its upper left corner @xmath74 submatrix . in the basis",
    "in which the first two indices correspond to ( @xmath75,@xmath76 ) , we find for matrix elements @xmath77 ( see appendix [ sec:1 ] ) @xmath78 it follows that the upper bound on the lightest higgs boson mass in the minimal supersymmetric left - right model can be written as @xcite : @xmath79 where @xmath80 .",
    "the upper bound ( [ eq : treeupper1 ] ) is not only independent of the supersymmetry breaking parameters ( as in the case of supersymmetric models based on @xmath1 ) , but it is also independent of the @xmath25 breaking scale , which , _ a priori _ , can be large .",
    "the upper bound is controlled by the weak scale vacuum expectation value , @xmath81 , and the dimensionless gauge couplings ( @xmath82 and @xmath83 ) only . since the former is essentially fixed by the electroweak scale , the gauge couplings @xmath82 and @xmath83 determine the bound .",
    "we will see below that even when @xmath84 are non - zero , the upper bound on the lightest higgs mass at the tree level does not depend on either the right - handed breaking scale or the susy breaking scale .",
    "a general method to find an upper limit for the lightest higgs mass in models based on @xmath20 and maximally quartic potentials was presented in @xcite .",
    "we will apply this method to the case of slrms , with possible nonrenormalizable terms , in an appropriate manner .",
    "consider a set of scalar fields @xmath85 transforming under @xmath29 , and define a discrete transformation @xmath86 of these fields , where @xmath87 is the dimension of @xmath29 representation @xcite , but @xmath88 provides the best limit in the case of slrm . ] . by setting the @xmath88-even fields to their vevs",
    ", a normalized field can be defined in the direction of @xmath29 breaking , @xmath89 , where @xmath90 , and all the fields orthogonal to @xmath91 have zero vevs .",
    "since the original lagrangian is invariant under the transformatiom @xmath88 , the potential must be invariant under @xmath88 , so that the potential contains only even powers of @xmath91 , @xmath92 we take into account only the leading nonrenormalizable terms and thus @xmath93 is the largest power in the potential @xmath94 . if @xmath91 were the mass eigenstate , then by using the minimization condition the higgs mass would be @xmath95 . in the general case , this expression provides an upper bound on the mass of the lightest higgs boson , @xmath96    since only the @xmath29 doublet fields are relevant for obtaining this bound , adding extra singlets or triplets in the model has no effect on the bound .",
    "thus , there are three separate cases to be considered for deriving an upper bound on the mass of the lightest higgs boson in the models discussed in the last section , namely : ( a ) @xmath56-parity is broken ( sneutrinos get vevs ) , ( b ) @xmath56-parity is conserved because there are additional triplets , and ( c ) @xmath56-parity is conserved because there are nonrenormalizable terms .",
    "let us first consider the situation in the minimal model , case ( a ) .",
    "we define a new neutral scalar field in the direction of the breaking in the @xmath29 doublet space : @xmath97 where @xmath98 all the @xmath29 doublet fields which are orthogonal to @xmath99 have vanishing vevs .",
    "we calculate next the quartic term @xmath100 in the potential .",
    "it has contributions from both the f - terms and the d - terms , and we find that the upper bound on the mass of the lightest higgs boson in the minimal slrm is @xmath101 , \\label{eq : treeupper2}\\ ] ] where @xmath102 as is evident , the upper bound ( [ eq : treeupper2 ] ) is independent of susy and right - handed breaking scales , and depends only on the dimensionless gauge and yukawa couplings , and vacuum expectation values which are determined by the weak scale : @xmath103 the triplet vevs @xmath49 and @xmath50 must be small in order to maintain @xmath104 . in the limit when @xmath105 , the bound ( [ eq : treeupper2 ] ) reduces to the upper bound ( [ eq : treeupper1 ] ) .",
    "it is obvious that the addition of extra triplets does not change this bound .",
    "thus , the bound for the case ( b ) , the slrm with additional triplets to ensure that @xmath56-parity is not spontaneously broken , can be obtained from ( [ eq : treeupper2 ] ) by taking the limit @xmath106 .",
    "the total number of nonrenormalizable terms in case ( c ) is rather large .",
    "all the coefficients in nonrenormalizable terms are proportional to inverse powers of a large scale .",
    "thus the largest contribution comes from those terms which have the smallest number of large scales and the largest number of potentially large vevs from @xmath25 triplets .",
    "we recall that the terms of the form @xmath100 and @xmath107 in the potential are needed to determine the contributions to the mass bound .",
    "the nonrenormalizable terms have no effect on the contribution from @xmath39-terms .",
    "the leading terms in the superpotential which can give a @xmath100 and @xmath107 type f - term contribution are of the type @xmath108 i.e. one term with two and another with four bidoublet fields . here",
    "@xmath109 . with @xmath29 singlets",
    "fixed to their vevs , the corresponding @xmath38-terms are @xmath110 the contribution to the higgs mass bound from these nonrenormalizable terms is @xmath111 if the vev @xmath112 gev in these models , the contribution is numerically negligible .",
    "therefore the upper bound for this class of models is essentially the same as in the case ( b ) .",
    "since it is known that the radiative corrections to the lightest higgs mass are significant in the mssm , as well as its extensions based on the @xmath1 , it is important to consider the radiative corrections to the upper bound on the lightest higgs boson mass obtained in the previous section . in this section",
    "we discuss the one - loop radiative corrections to the upper bound on the lightest higgs mass in the minimal supersymmetric left - right model , which was obtained in last section .",
    "we shall use the method of one - loop effective potential @xcite for the calculation of radiative corrections , where the effective potential may be expressed as the sum of the tree - level potential plus a correction coming from the sum of one - loop diagrams with external lines having zero momenta , @xmath113 where @xmath114 is the tree level potential ( [ eq : scalarpotential ] ) evaluated at the appropriate running scale @xmath115 , and @xmath116 is the one loop correction given by @xmath117 where @xmath118 is the field dependent mass eigenvalue of the @xmath119th particle of spin @xmath120 . the dominant contribution to ( [ eq : deltav1 ] ) comes from top - stop ( @xmath121 ) system .",

    "the radiatively corrected upper bound ( [ eq : upperbound1 ] ) on the mass of the lightest higgs boson is plotted in fig.[mh1 ] as a function of the large scale @xmath158 up to which the supersymmetric left - right model remains perturbative .",
    "the upper bound comes from the requirement that all the gauge couplings of the slrm remain perturbative below the scale @xmath158 .",
    "we have taken into account the dominant radiative corrections coming from the quark and squark loops in our calculations . in fig.[mh1 ] we have taken two values of @xmath159 and @xmath160 . in the figure the upper bound is shown for two different values of the @xmath25 breaking scale , @xmath161 tev and @xmath162 gev , respectively , and for two values of soft supersymmetry breaking mass parameter , @xmath163 tev and @xmath164 tev .",
    "it is seen from this figure that if the difference between the @xmath25 breaking scale and the large scale @xmath4 is more than two orders of magnitude , the radiatively corrected upper bound on the mass of the lightest higgs boson remains below 250 gev . for large values of @xmath158",
    "the upper bound is below 200 gev . the upper bound increases with increasing @xmath165 and with increasing soft supersymmetry breaking parameters .",
    "it is considerably larger than the corresponding upper bound in the mssm .",
    "in order to study the phenomenology of the lightest higgs boson in the slrm , we must obtain its couplings to the fermions and see how these differ from the corresponding mssm couplings .",
    "the major difference between the two models arises due to the triplet higgs couplings to leptons .",
    "as discussed earlier , the lightest neutral higgs is composed mainly of the bidoublet fields , and we do not expect the triplet couplings to have a large effect on the lightest neutral higgs branching ratios . another difference in the higgs couplings in the slrm and the mssm arises because of the mixing between the higgs(ino ) and lepton sectors in models where @xmath56-parity is spontaneously broken . since the lightest chargino contains gaugino and higgsino admixture , one might expect that in some region of the parameter space the couplings are significantly different from the couplings in the mssm .",
    "we will take the lightest chargino to correspond to the @xmath166-lepton .",
    "it will be denoted by @xmath167 in the following .",
    "thus , it is important to study in detail the couplings of the lightest higgs boson to the @xmath167 .    in figure [ tau2 ]",
    "we have plotted the branching ratio of the lightest neutral higgs boson to @xmath168 , @xmath169 , and @xmath170 pair both in the mssm and in the slrm for large @xmath171 and a tree - level mass @xmath172 gev as a function of the second lightest neutral higgs boson mass .",
    "we note that for the second lightest neutral higgs with mass @xmath173 gev , the branching ratio to bottom pair almost vanishes while the branching ratio to a @xmath167 pair is enhanced .",
    "this behaviour occurs in a transition region where the composition of the light higgs bosons change rapidly , and the lightest higgs coupling to @xmath168 becomes negligible .",
    "similar phenomenon occurs for small @xmath171 .",
    "it is well known that in the left - right symmetric models problems with fcnc are expected if several light higgs bosons exist @xcite . in the supersymmetric case , the problem could be expected to be more severe , since the potential is more constrained .",
    "furthermore , in the four higgs - doublet model @xcite , which is also the number of doublets in the supersymmetric left - right model , it was found that the potential is always real , thus preventing spontaneous violation of cp .",
    "strong limits on the fcnc higgs were obtained in @xcite assuming that the only source for cp violation is the complex phase in the kobayashi - maskawa matrix and that the model is manifestly left - right symmetric . if these conditions are relaxed , for example by defining the symmetry transformation by eq .",
    "( 4 ) , a weakened lower limit for second lightest neutral higgs is obtained from the neutral meson mass difference .",
    "the limit is less severe for large values of @xmath171 , but remains of the same order than in the nonsupersymmetric left - right model .",
    "taking into account the uncertainties in calculating the mass difference , @xmath174 tev ) .",
    "thus the relevant limit to discuss is the one in which all the neutral higgs bosons , except the lightest one , are heavy .    in order to consider in detail the neutral higgs couplings to the @xmath167-leptons ,",
    "we ll need the interaction lagrangian .",
    "we have seen that at the tree level the lightest higgs can be written as @xmath175 where @xmath176 are the scalar bidoublet fields and @xmath177 are all the other fields . in the decoupling limit @xmath178",
    ", the relevant higgs - fermion interaction lagrangian can be written as @xmath179 where @xmath180 and @xmath181 .",
    "the mass eigenstates @xmath182 are found by diagonalizing the mass matrices by unitary matrices @xmath183 @xcite , @xmath184 the diagonal chargino mass matrix is @xmath185 we decompose the mass matrix @xmath186 and the diagonalizing matrices @xmath187 and @xmath188 as @xmath189 where the contribution of the terms proportional to @xmath190 in determining the @xmath166 lepton eigenstate is small .",

    "thus the diagonal couplings to @xmath167 are given by @xmath197 the chargino mass matrix can be written as @xmath198 , where @xmath199 and @xmath200 we have here assumed for simplicity that @xmath201 , and @xmath202 .",
    "the matrix @xmath203 has one zero eigenvalue corresponding to the @xmath166 mass , @xmath204=0 .",
    "the @xmath167 mass is @xmath205 for the sm one has @xmath206 .",
    "thus , in the decoupling limit , we obtain the following result for the ratio of the yukawa couplings @xmath207 and @xmath208 : @xmath209 since the matrix @xmath210 is diagonal . even if the @xmath167 s contained large fraction of gauginos or higgsinos , the couplings responsible for higgs decays to the charged leptons or quarks are the same as in the standard model , since the physically relevant parameter region is close to the decoupling limit .",
    "contrary to the mssm , one might have the lightest higgs decaying to a @xmath167-lepton and a heavier chargino . whether this decay mode is kinematically possible",
    "is much more model dependent than the decay to leptons , and we can not say anything general about it .",
    "we have seen that the neutral higgs sector contains one relatively light higgs boson , which however may be heavier as compared to the lightest higgs in the mssm , and which has mssm like couplings to the fermions of the model .",
    "thus , one can not tell from the properties of the lightest higgs boson , about the nature of the model . if a light higgs is found before any supersymmetric particles",
    "are observed , one would not even know whether it is the higgs boson of a supersymmetric model .",
    "altogether there are four doubly charged higgs bosons in the slrm , of which two are right - handed and two left - handed .",
    "the mass matrices of the left - handed triplets depend on the soft susy breaking parameters , left - triplet vevs , and the weak scale .",
    "thus , their masses are expected to be of the same order as the soft terms .",
    "the mass matrix for the right - handed scalars depends on the right - triplet vev instead of the left - triplet vev .",

    "this is also true in the slrm with enlarged particle content @xcite .",
    "thus a light doubly charged higgs would be a strong indication of a supersymmetric left - right model with minimal particle content .    in the case of broken r - parity",
    ", the mass matrix of the right - handed doubly charged scalars can be obtained from the potential in appendix a. the allowed parameter space is strongly constrained by demanding that all the eigenvalues of the mass squared scalar matrices remain positive . in order to find the relevant parameter region , we have studied the bounds on some of the masses in the model . although these may not be important as actual bounds , they restrict the parameter space . in the following we shall assume that @xmath211 . from the bound obtained from submatrix @xmath212 , we find the following constraint @xmath213 where @xmath214 . if the terms with bidoublet lepton yukawa couplings are ignored , and @xmath215 , eq .
