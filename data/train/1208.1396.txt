    "a two - level system is a key element in understanding the structure of matter and its interaction with electromagnetic fields .",
    "two - level systems manipulated by electromagnetic waves are the fundamental building blocks in many applications , such as nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) @xcite and electron paramagnetic resonance ( epr ) microscopy , atomic clocks @xcite and interferometers @xcite , magnetometry with atoms @xcite or nv centers in diamonds @xcite and quantum information processing with atoms , ions , quantum dots or superconducting qubits @xcite .",
    "the basic operation in two - level system manipulation is rabi rotation ( also called rabi flopping or rabi oscillation ) , which appears whenever a two - level system is subjected to a constant nearly - resonant driving field .",
    "measurement of rabi oscillations and their damping provides information about the coherence of the system .",
    "decoherence may follow from spontaneous emission @xcite , external or intrinsic noise @xcite and spatial inhomogeneities across the sample , which may be due to inhomogeneities of external fields or due to the dynamics of the two - level systems themselves during the oscillations ( e.g. dipole - dipole interactions ) @xcite .    a process which is analogous to the damping of rabi oscillations is the decoherence ( dephasing ) of free phase oscillations of two - level systems which are prepared in a superposition of the two energy eigenstates . in nmr this process",
    "is called free - induction - decay ( fid ) and used for characterizing the environment , and in atomic clocks and interferometers it involves the loss of visibility of ramsey fringes .",
    "this decoherence is usually caused by fluctuations or inhomogeneities in the energy splitting between the two levels . if these inhomogeneities are time - independent or vary slowly in time , then this incoherence may be reversed by using a spin - echo technique which reverses the evolution of the relative phase ( equivalent to the direction of spin precession ) . in this way it is possible to distinguish between the effect of static inhomogeneities and other sources of decoherence .    in dilute gases of alkali atoms , which are used for atomic clocks , interferometers and magnetic sensors ,",
    "dipole - dipole interactions are negligible such that spin decoherence is usually caused by fluctuations and inhomogeneities of external magnetic or electromagnetic fields , and by atomic collisions @xcite .",
    "these hindering effects of inhomogeneous fields are also relevant for single trapped atoms and ions if the fields vary significantly over the length scale of the particle localization . in this context",
    "it is important to understand the effect of temperature",
    ".    on the other hand , such inhomogeneous fields may be useful in the case of low velocity cold atoms , which can be locally manipulated by these fields .",
    "furthermore , cold atoms may be used for micron - scale sensing of local forces and fields .",

    "@xcite local forces were probed , while in ref . @xcite it was shown that probing local rabi oscillations of ultracold atoms driven by inhomogeneous fields can serve as a tool for mapping the intensity and direction of electromagnetic waves in the microscopic scale . in this context , it is important to understand the resolution limits of such methods of local manipulation or sensing when thermal motion mixes measurements at neighboring locations and reduces the visibility of spatial and temporal modulations of the atomic population .",

    "we conclude that detection error grows slowly with temperature .",
    "another aspect that can be derived from this work concerns the limitation of thermal atom manipulation by inhomogeneous fields where the field gradient is viewed as an imperfection .",
    "for example , our model can be used to infer the fidelity of a @xmath71 pulse applied to an atomic sample by a driving field which is inhomogeneous ( e.g. an atomic cloud passing through a mw cavity in an atomic clock ) .",
    "fidelity is defined by the overlap between a target state @xmath153 and an actual state @xmath154 .",
    "if the actual state is not pure then it is described by a density matrix @xmath155 .",
    "the fidelity is then given by @xmath156^{1/2}$ ] .",
    "for a @xmath71 pulse the target state is @xmath157 . for a given velocity",
    "the actual state is @xmath158|1\\rangle -i\\sin\\left[\\frac{1}{4}(\\pi+\\partial_x\\omega vt_0 ^ 2)\\right]|2\\rangle$ ] , where @xmath159 .",
    "the overlap between the actual state and the target state is @xmath160 . integrating the square of the overlap over the different velocities we obtain @xmath161\\right\\ } $ ] .",
    "when @xmath162 the fidelity is almost @xmath134 , while if @xmath163 the fidelity drops to a minimum value of @xmath164 , which represents the fidelity for a totally random qubit state .",
    "it follows again that @xmath70 acts as a critical time for atom manipulation in the presence of gradients and thermal velocities .    to conclude",
    ", we have developed a simple model for the damping of local rabi oscillations in the presence of driving field gradients and damping of ramsey fringe coherence in the presence of static state - selective field gradients . for a sample of freely propagating thermal atoms",
    "we have shown that in the presence of gradients of driving fields , local rabi oscillations of two - level atoms lose their coherence with an exponential quartic time dependence .",
    "equivalently , in the presence of gradients of static fields , the coherence of local population oscillations in a ramsey sequence reduces in the same way .",
    "the coherence time scales inversely with the square root of the field gradient and with the 4th root of the temperature .",
    "we have demonstrated the theoretical model in an experiment with laser cooled atoms and obtained an excellent agreement between the analytical solutions of the theory and the experimental results .",
    "our model and experimental demonstration lays the grounds for understanding of more general situations in which a sample of atoms interacts with local fields . on the one hand",
    ", the atoms can serve as a measurement tool for probing the amplitudes of local fields and their spatial dependence , in which case our model may be used to determine the accuracy limits of such a measurement . on the other hand",
    ", our model may contribute to the understanding of limitations on local qubit manipulation in systems of thermal qubits whose external motion may be described classically and when they are not localized well enough relative to the variation length - scale of the manipulating fields .",
    "the model may be extended to cases where the atomic gas is confined by a potential or in a vapor cell .",
    "further extensions of the model may also include the effects of atomic collisions or the behavior of atoms at ultracold temperatures where a degenerate gas is formed .",
