    "one of the main goals of microscopic nuclear structure calculations , which are based on realistic models for the nucleon - nucleon ( nn ) interactions , is to obtain a reliable prediction for the equation of state of nuclear matter under the extreme conditions , which one has to consider for astrophysical scenarios like a supernova or objects like a neutron star",
    ". for that purpose one considers nn interactions , which are adjusted to describe the properties of two nucleons in the vacuum , i.e. the nn phase shifts , and tries to develop a many - body theory which yields a good description for the bulk properties of `` normal '' nuclear matter , the saturation point of symmetric nuclear matter and properties of finite nuclei .",
    "a theory , which is able to link such a realistic nn interaction to the properties of nuclear matter at normal densities , should provide reliable results for the properties of nuclear matter at higher densities , temperatures and isospin - asymmetries , as they occur in the astrophysical objects mentioned above@xcite .",
    "a basic problem of such nuclear structure investigations is the existence of strong tensor short - range components in such a realistic nn interaction , which makes it necessary to account for corresponding correlations in the nuclear wave - function .",
    "in fact , simple hartree - fock or mean - field calculations using such realistic nn interactions yield unbound nuclei@xcite .",
    "rather powerful many - body techniques have been developed to account for correlations beyond the mean - field approximation and using rather sophisticated monte - carlo techniques one is able to derive the properties of light nuclei from such realistic nn interactions@xcite . in order to obtain a good agreement with the experimental data , however , one has to introduce a three - body force .",
    "an additional three - body force is also required , if one wants to reproduce the saturation point of symmetric nuclear matter within a non - relativistic many - body approach based on realistic nn interactions . on the other hand , however , it is known already for more than 15 years that the consideration of relativistic features , as it is done e.g. in the dirac brueckner hartree fock ( dbhf ) approximation yields results for the saturation point of symmetric nuclear matter , which are very close to the empirical data@xcite .",
    "this success is based on the relativistic structure of the nn interaction , a feature which is also present in the phenomenology of the walecka model@xcite .",
    "the nn interaction in this model is described in terms of the exchange of a scalar meson , @xmath0 , and a vector meson @xmath1 . calculating the nucleon self - energy , @xmath2 , from such a meson exchange model within a mean - field ( hartree ) approximation",
    ", one finds that the @xmath1 exchange yields a component @xmath3 , which transforms under a lorentz transformation like the time - like component of a vector , while the scalar meson exchange yields a contribution @xmath4 , which transforms like a scalar . inserting this self energy into the dirac equation for a nucleon in the medium of nuclear matter leads to single - particle energies , which are as small as the empirical value of -50 mev .",
    "this small binding effect , however , results from a strong cancellation between the repulsive @xmath3 and the attractive @xmath4 component . as has recently been shown in @xcite the appearence of these two large and cancelling scalar and vector fields in matter is not only a consequence of dirac phenomenology but has a deeper foundation in the structure of the nucleon - nucleon force , i.e. it is intimitely connected to the spin - orbit force in vacuum nn scattering .",
    "the scalar component @xmath4 , which is conveniently described in terms of an effective dirac mass , leads to a significant enhancement of the small component of the dirac spinors in the nuclear medium .",
    "it is this density - dependence of the dirac spinors , which is responsible for the fine - tuning in the nuclear structure calculation , which is necessary to obtain the empirical saturation point .",
    "non - relativistic studies , which can not account for this feature , may include this effect in terms of a three - body force .",
    "moreover , the excitation of anti - nucleons , automatically included in the relativistic formalism , gives rise to a class of three - body forces ( z - graphs ) which have to added in the non - relativistic formalism .",
    "doing so , the saturation points from non - relativistic brueckner calculations are shifted towards their relativistic counterparts @xcite .",
    "a neutron star , however , can not completely be described in terms of homogeneous nuclear matter in @xmath5-equilibrium at various densities .",
    "the crust of such a neutron star in particular is a challenge for theoretical nuclear structure physics as it incorporates the transition from isolated nuclei via a crystal - like structure of quasi - nuclei embedded in a sea of neutrons to phase of homogeneous baryon matter .",
    "these intermediate structures have been described by means of the wigner - seitz ( ws ) cell approximation employing the thomas - fermi approximation based on a purely phenomenological energy - density functional .",
    "such calculations predicted a variety of geometrical structures : spherical quasi - nuclei , which are favored at small densities , merge with increasing density to strings , which then may cluster to parallel plates and so on .",
    "these geometrical structures have been the origin for the popular name of this phase : pasta phase .",
    "a step towards a more microscopic study has been made by performing self - consistent hartree - fock calculations based on effective nucleon - nucleon interactions like the density - dependent skyrme forces@xcite .",
    "such calculations have been performed by bonche and vautherin@xcite and by a few other groups .",
    "these studies show that shell effects have a significant influence on details like the proton fraction of the baryonic matter in the inhomogeneous phase@xcite .",
    "they also provide the basis for a microscopic investigation of pairing phenomena , excitation modes and response functions as well as the effects of finite temperature .",
    "such self - consistent calculations for inhomogeneous matter have typically been performed assuming a ws cell of spherical shape .",
    "this geometry , however , does not support the description of triaxial structures , which are typical for the pasta phase .",
    "furthermore the transition to homogeneous matter can not be described in a satisfactory manner within such a spherical ws cell@xcite .",
    "therefore cubic ws cells have recently been considered for hartree - fock calculations using effective hamiltonians like the skyrme forces@xcite .",
    "these effective hamiltonians , however , are of purely phenomenological origin .",
    "they are adjusted to describe nuclear matter at normal density and finite nuclei",
    ". therefore one can not expect any predictive power of such calculations if one extends its region of application to higher densities , large proton - neutron asymmetries and finite temperatures .",
    "therefore in the present work we will perform relativistic mean field calculations employing a model for the lagrangian , which is based on microscopic dbhf calculations using realistic nn interactions .",
    "attempts to derive an effective lagrange density by fitting density - dependent coupling constants in such a way that a mean - field calculation reproduces details of a dbhf calculation have been made before@xcite .",
    "the calculations presented here are based on dbhf calculations of van dalen et al.@xcite for asymmetric nuclear matter .",
    "these results for the dbhf calculations for homogeneous asymmetric nuclear matter have successfully been used in bulk studies of neutron stars@xcite .",
    "therefore we have tried to ensure that the effective mean field parameterization reproduces the properties of the equation of state derived from this dbhf calculations at high densities with good accuracy .",
    "furthermore we introduce a small correction term , which ensures that the mean - field calculations yield a good description of binding energy and radii of finite nuclei as well . in this way we obtain an effective field theory , which is based on a realistic model for the nn interaction in the vacuum ,",
    "reproduces the details of microscopic dbhf calculations for asymmetric nuclear matter at high densities and yields good agreement with the empirical data for the saturation point of asymmetric nuclear matter as well as bulk properties of finite nuclei .",
    "therefore the resulting parameterization should be a good candidate to determine a reliable equation of state for baryonic matter in a large interval of densities .",
    "using this lagrangian we will present results of relativistic mean - field calculations in cartesian ws cells considering a range of densities in which the transition from isolated nuclei to homogeneous matter occurs .",
    "special attention will be paid to the effects of finite temperature on the formation of the geometrical structures .",
    "after this introduction section 2 contains a short review of the density dependent relativistic mean field ( ddrmf ) approach and its application to the description of infinite matter as well as finite nuclear systems and baryonic structures in a cartesian ws cell .",
    "the parameterization of the density dependent coupling constants and the fit to the dbhf results is described in section 3 .",
    "results for the inhomogeneous structures , which are typical for the crust of neutron stars are presented in section 3 .",
    "special emphasis is made to explore the effects of finite temperature and the differences as compared to studies using a purely phenomenological skyrme forces .",
    "the density dependent relativistic mean field ( ddrmf ) approach is an effective field theory of interacting mesons and nucleons . following the usual notation we consider scalar ( @xmath6 ) and vector mesons ( @xmath7 ) , which with respect to the isospin correspond to isoscalar ( @xmath8 ) and isovector ( @xmath9 ) , respectively .",
    "the lagrangian density consists of three parts : the free baryon lagrangian density @xmath10 , the free meson lagrangian density @xmath11 and the interaction lagrangian density @xmath12 : @xmath13 which take the explicit form @xmath14 with the field strength tensor @xmath15 for the vector mesons . in the above lagrangian density the nucleon field consisting of dirac  spinors in isospin space",

    "allowing for a density dependence of the baryon  meson vertices improves the capability of the model significantly , since it enables the latter to assimilate the self  energies of a dirac  brueckner  hartree  fock calculation .",
    "this means that the coupling constants @xmath24 depend on a density @xmath34 obtained from the nucleon field @xmath16 . in the literature",
    "we find a dependence on the scalar density or on the vector density @xcite .",
    "it turned out that the dependence on the zero component of the vector density , the baryon density @xmath35 , is the most suitable one since it describes finite nuclei better and has a natural connection to the vertices in the dbhf calculations @xcite .",

    "however , the free energy , which is the energy of consideration , is lower than the energy in the @xmath121 case and rises with a larger slope , which means that the finite temperature increases the pressure derived from the free energy .",
    "the energies resulting from the ddrmf calculations , which allow for non  homogeneous structure yield a gain in energy for densities below 0.05 @xmath116 .",
    "this means that a temperature of 5 mev lowers the critical density for the formation of local structures from 0.08 @xmath116 at @xmath121 to 0.05 @xmath116 at @xmath120 mev .",
    "at values below this critical density , the gain in the free energy at finite temperature turns out to be considerably smaller than in the zero temperature limit .",
    "this reflects the feature that finite temperature effects tend to suppress the formation of density fluctuations .",
    "note , that these small differences between the free energy of the homogeneous and inhomogeneous structures is to quite some extent due to the enhancement of the entropy in the inhomogeneous case .",
    "we observe the same features in skyrme hf calculations at finite temperature .",
    "finite temperature also reduces the variety of geometrical shapes in the skyrme hf as well as in the ddrmf approach ( see table  [ tab : shape_trans ] ) .",
    "[ fig : e - ddrmf_t5 ] also displays results from thomas - fermi calculations . in this case the temperature dependence is contained only in the the bulk contribution , i.e. the integrated nuclear ",
    "matter energy densities calculated at the finite temperature .",
    "the parameter for the surface energy @xmath128 is still adjusted to reproduce the properties of @xmath133pb at @xmath121 .",
    "as discussed above one could now try to fit this constant @xmath128 in such a way that we reproduce results for the energy , the free energy and proton abundances of the ddrmf approach .",
    "this readjustment leads to a value of 27 mev @xmath135 for the parameterization of eq.([eq : param1 ] ) . the value is lower by about 15% compared to the corresponding one at zero temperature .",
    "hence a slight reduction of the surface energy constant @xmath128 could improve the thomas  fermi approach at finite temperature .",
    "density dependent relativistic mean field ( ddrmf ) calculations have been performed to study the structure of baryonic matter in @xmath5-equilibrium with electrons in a region of densities between 0.01 and 0.1 nucleons @xmath116 .",
    "a parameterization of the density dependent meson - nucleon coupling constants has been developed , which is based on microscopic dirac brueckner hartree fock ( dbhf ) calculations and reproduces the saturation point of nuclear matter as well as the bulk properties of finite nuclei . since this",
    "parameterization yields a good description of normal nuclei , i.e. baryonic matter at normal density and small proton - neutron asymmetries but is also based on a realistic interaction which describes the scattering of two nucleons in the vacuum , it should give more reliable results for the baryonic structure at small densities and large proton - neutron asymmetries than corresponding calculations , which are based on purely phenomenological hamiltonians like the skyrme forces .",
    "the parameterization of the coupling constants in terms of analytic functions makes it easily accessible .",
    "the ddrmf calculations are performed for zero temperature as well as finite temperature in a periodic lattice of wigner - seitz ( ws ) cells of cubic shape .",
    "pairing correlations are taken into account within the framework of the finite temperature bcs approximation assuming a density - dependent pairing force of zero range .    at densities below 0.08 nucleons",
    "@xmath116 the ddrmf approach predicts non - homogeneous structures , which are similar to those predicted by thomas - fermi or skyrme hartree - fock calculations for the `` pasta - phase '' of matter in the crust of neutron stars .",
    "the structures obtained in the ddrmf calculations , however , are typically less pronounced than the corresponding structures resulting from skyrme hartree ",
    "fock calculations .",
    "this may be a consequence of the finite range of the interaction in ddrmf as compared to the zero - range skyrme forces .",
    "also it turns out that the gain in energy due to the formation of non  homogeneous density distributions is slightly smaller in the ddrmf as compared to skyrme hf . also the ddrmf yields a smaller symmetry energy at the low densities , which provides smaller proton abundances .",
    "the effects of finite temperature tend to reduce the disposition of the baryonic matter to form non  homogeneous structures .",
    "this is driven by the larger entropy of the non  homogeneous matter as compared to the homogeneous phase .",
    "this leads to a reduction of the critical density for the formation of non  homogeneous structures .",
    "it drops from 0.08 nucleons @xmath116 at @xmath121 to 0.05 nucleons @xmath116 at @xmath120 mev . at densities below the critical densities , the gain in the free energy of the non",
    " homogeneous as compared to the homogeneous realization is smaller and the resulting geometrical structures are less pronounced in the case of finite temperature .    an attempt has been made to reproduce the results of the microscopic skyrme hf and ddrmf calculation by means of the thomas - fermi ( tf ) approximation .",
    "main features like the critical densities for the formation of geometrical structures of various shapes , the energies and the proton abundances can be reproduced , if one considers a parameter for the surface term , which is reduced with increasing proton asymmetry and with temperature .",
