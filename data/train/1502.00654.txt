    "the process of magnetic reconnection underpins our understanding of many astrophysical phenomena .",
    "examples include solar flares , geomagnetic storms and saw tooth crashes in tokamaks @xcite .",
    "yet a complete understanding of this enigmatic plasma process remains illusive , despite decades of research .",
    "fundamentally , magnetic reconnection is the process whereby excess energy in a magnetic field is liberated by the reorganization of a magnetic field s connectivity in the from of plasma heating , bulk fluid motions and particle acceleration .",
    "classically , this is envisioned to occur in a single well defined region of high electric current , within which non - ideal effects dominate and the plasma becomes decoupled from the magnetic field @xcite .",
    "however , in recent years the importance of instabilities which fragment reconnection regions has been more fully appreciated .",
    "in particular , in two dimensions high aspect ratio current sheets have been shown to be highly unstable to tearing with the resulting dynamics dominated by the formation and ejection of magnetic islands @xcite , whilst 3d simulations have emphasized the importance of flux rope formation , braiding and the possible development of turbulence @xcite .",
    "observations of plasma blobs and bursty radio emissions in the extended magnetic field beneath erupting cme s as well as bursty signatures of reconnection in the earth s magnetotail appear to somewhat corroborate this picture @xcite .",
    "an important diagnostic of any reconnection scenario is the rate at which the process occurs . in two dimensions reconnection",
    "occurs only at x - points , with the rate of reconnection given simply by the electric field at this position .",
    "if the current layer is fragmented then the only topologically stable situation is one in which only a single x - point resides at the boundary between the global flux domains .",
    "the reconnection rate is then the electric field measured at this  dominant \" x - point ( e.g. @xcite ) .    in three dimensions ( 3d )",
    "the picture is more complex .",
    "when reconnection involves 3d nulls , separatrix surfaces divide up the magnetic field into regions of differing connectivity .",
    "the rate of reconnection can then be defined as the flux transfer across these surfaces @xcite , or past separators which sit at the intersection of different separatrix surfaces @xcite . if the non - ideal regions spanning the separatrix surfaces are fragmented then considering flux transfer across segments of a separatrix surface @xcite or along multiple separators @xcite if they exist allows the reconnection rate to be quantified .",
    "unlike 2d , where x - points other than the dominant x - point do not directly contribute to the reconnection rate ( although they may indirectly affect it ) , in 3d reconnection across a separatrix surface in multiple places or at multiple separators all contribute towards the total rate of flux transfer between the main topological domains .",
    "this leads to the surprising result that in 3d _ two _ measures of reconnection may be used when reconnection occurs in fragmented current layers .",
    "one that measures the total rate at which flux is reconnected ( taking account of recursively reconnected magnetic flux ) and a net measure of the combined effects of each of the fragmented non - ideal regions .",
    "the former is the true reconnection rate for any problem , but the latter may be of interest when the large scale effects of a reconnection site are being considered .",
    "furthermore , in 3d reconnection may also occur in the absence of magnetic null points . in this case",
    "the lack separatrix surfaces against which reconnection can be defined requires a more general approach to the problem .",
    "the theory of general magnetic reconnection ( gmr ) encompasses reconnection across separatrices @xcite as well as describing reconnection in situations without them .",
    "the theory of gmr has shown that for a single isolated non - ideal region the rate of reconnection is given by the maximum of @xmath1 on all field lines threading the non - ideal region @xcite .",
    "however , the question remains as to how to measure reconnection in fragmented current layers without the presence of separatrix surfaces or in situations where separatrix surfaces are difficult to identify .",
    "the aim of this work is to extend the framework of gmr to quantify the reconnection process in this case .",

    "plasma elements which begin on the same field line ( and so initially have the same value of @xmath4 and @xmath2 ) are subject to the same change in @xmath4 and @xmath2 and so will be found on the same field line at a later time .",
    "therefore , a necessary and sufficient condition for reconnection is that @xcite @xmath24 i.e. that there be gradients in @xmath19 from one field line to another .",
    "to understand the nature of any resulting connectivity change for a given problem it is useful to map the problem from 3d real space into flux coordinate ( @xmath23 ) space .",

    "we restrict ourselves here to scenarios where the multiple @xmath0 regions still only make up a small fraction of the volume under consideration .",

    "the way that this connection change is achieved depends upon the global constraints of the system under consideration . in general the formation of new connections along these loops",

    "extending this concept to multiple reconnection regions , each individual non - ideal region will behave locally like the single reconnection region shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : connection](a ) .",
    "the key difference is that now a subset of field lines thread through multiple reconnection regions .",
    "thus , circular plasma flows are induced on field lines leaving a reconnection region which then feed into other secondary regions further along the same field line .",
    "each secondary region superposes a circular plasma flow on to the flow pattern associated with the field lines which thread into it . in some cases",
    "this will enhance the induced flow at the exit of the patchy reconnection volume . in others it will act to reduce it .",
    "figure [ fig : connection](b ) shows a conceptual sketch of this idea .",
    "thus , steady state patchy reconnection within a localized volume gives rise to an induced localized rotating flow with multiple internal vortices on field lines threading out of the reconnection volume . as with the single reconnection region",
    "any background ideal plasma flow may be superposed on to this non - ideal flow .    in the opposite extreme of purely time",

    "this is particularly relevant to the solar corona , e.g. @xcite . in this case",
    "new connections can only be formed by a time dependent change in the magnetic field within @xmath3 .",
    "the circular nature of this connection change in situations with a single extrema in @xmath19 implies that helical magnetic fields are formed in the process , fig .",
    "[ fig : connection](c ) .",
    "when the volume under consideration contains several reconnection sites , each helical region of field may contain a subset of field lines which threads into other helical reconnection regions . fig .",

    "this shows that patchy time dependent reconnection can generate ( or relax ) braided magnetic fields which are thought to be important in the context of coronal heating @xcite",
    ".    in any given 3d reconnection scenario a combination of both manners of connection change are likely to occur .",
    "if a given magnetic field contains separatrix surfaces and separator lines then these topological structures can be used as a reference against which the rate of flux transfer may be measured .",
    "for instance , when reconnection occurs along a separator the rate of reconnection is simply given by the integral of @xmath0 along the separator line @xcite . however , in the absence of such structures a more general theory is required .",
    "@xcite developed such a theory for an isolated single reconnection region , @xmath3 , extending those of previous works @xcite . using a similar approach",
    "we now reproduce their results before generalizing the theory to quantify reconnection with multiple reconnection sites .    without an obvious reference surface against which to measure @xcite",
    "considered an arbitrary flux surface ( i.e. a surface comprised of magnetic field lines ) which intersects the single region of parallel electric field and contains the field line along which the integral of @xmath0 is maximal .",
    "when mapped into @xmath23-space this surface appears as a line , which they call the @xmath27 line .",
    "figure [ fig : gamma](a ) shows a sketch of this concept , where the contours depict the quasi - potential @xmath19 .",
    "now , this flux surface is comprised of field lines embedded in the ideal regions on either side of @xmath3 .",
    "generally , in each ideal region the evolution is comprised of a background ideal transporting component ( which by definition is the same on both sides ) and a non - ideal reconnecting component . without loss of generality",
    "we now focus on the non - ideal component by fixing the evolution of field lines threading _ into _ the non - ideal region to zero , i.e. @xmath28 .",
    "this is equivalent to using a coordinate system which moves with the plasma on field lines entering the non - ideal region , allowing the connection change to be entirely characterized by the evolution of the field lines threading _ out of _ the non - ideal region which evolve according to @xmath29 .",
    "if @xmath27 is then defined at some arbitrary time ( @xmath30 ) , then at some later time ( @xmath31 ) the differing evolution on either side of the non - ideal region splits @xmath27 into two new flux surfaces . in @xmath23 space",
    "these appear as two lines , shown in solid blue and dashed black in fig .",
    "[ fig : gamma](b ) .",

    "the two new surfaces overlap at the edge of the non - ideal region and at @xmath33 ( where @xmath34 ) since at these places @xmath35 .",
    "the magnetic flux reconnected up to this time is simply given by the flux bounded within one of the two flux tubes formed by these two new flux surfaces , denoted @xmath36 and @xmath37 ( fig .",

    "to quantify the true rate of reconnection requires that the connection change associated with each of these other extrema also be taken account of .",
    "this can be achieved by considering a flux surface for each additional extrema bounded on one side by the field line at which the extrema occurs and on the other by the field line situated at the nearest saddle point ( s.p . ) of @xmath19 ( corresponding to each additional `` o - point '' and its nearest `` x - point '' of the @xmath55 field ) .",

    "one would expect that such a flux surface must contain the field lines along which each of the extrema and saddle points of the @xmath19 profile occur .",

    "[ fig : vslice ] . as the quasi - potential @xmath19 is the same as the time dependent scenario at @xmath81 the two measures of reconnection rate are then also @xmath137 where @xmath27 can be chosen to lie along @xmath89 . in this extreme",
    "these quantities are measures of the total and net rate at which flux is swept past @xmath89 by the induced plasma flow on one side of the collective non - ideal regions , i.e. @xmath138 where @xmath139 denotes integration over either the positive or negative values only .",

    "( [ rrvel1 ] ) and integrated over the regions of negative velocity leads to @xmath142 note that integrating over the positive value gives the same result .",

    "( [ phitot ] ) and ( [ phinet ] ) are simply eqns .",
    "( [ rrtot ] ) and ( [ rrnet ] ) applied to this particular @xmath19 profile .",
    "thus , we have verified the two rates of reconnection for our idealized fragmented reconnection region in each of the two extreme cases of steady state and purely time dependent reconnection and by extension the continuum of cases in - between .",
    "the aim of this paper was to extend the theory of general magnetic reconnection to situations with fragmented current layers within a localized volume .",
    "we considered the manner in which new connections may be formed , derived expressions for the rate at which this occurs and verified these expressions with two simple examples .    in terms of facilitating the formation of new connections we showed that in the extreme of steady state reconnection a large scale rotational non - ideal flow with internal vortices is produced , whilst purely time dependent reconnection leads to spontaneously braided magnetic fields .",
    "however , it should be emphasized that the reverse is also true .",
    "that is , the existence of non - ideal regions is guaranteed by the right evolution of the magnetic field ( given the necessary non - ideal plasma conditions ) .",
    "in particular , if a magnetic field is initially braided with the field lines entering and leaving the volume held fixed , then multiple current layers must form to remove this braiding .",
    "this second scenario is readily observed by numerical experiments examining the non - ideal relaxation of braided magnetic fields ( e.g. @xcite ) .    by considering",
    "the closed paths along which these new connections formed we also showed that when current layers are fragmented _ two rates of reconnection _ can be defined which describe the process . @xmath62 which measures the true rate at which new connections are formed collectively by the multiple non - ideal regions and a second , @xmath63 measuring the net rate at which changes in the global field occurs .",
    "when applied to a single reconnection region both rates are equal .",
    "we chose to define @xmath62 such that it measures the total rate at which flux is locally and globally cycled when viewed in flux coordinate space .",
    "this requires evaluating the quasi - potential at the saddle points of @xmath19 as well as the extrema .",
    "we chose this rather than a simple sum over each extrema as summing over only the extrema overestimates the rate flux is cycled ( although if each non - ideal region has little overlap this may give a close approximation , e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "this occurs as each extrema taken on its own measures the net rate of transfer of flux between itself and the background ideal field .",
    "therefore , summing over all extrema double counts the flux being cycled around outer loops , such as those depicted in orange and yellow in fig .",
    "[ fig : arc ] . by involving the quasi - potential measured at the saddle points ,",
    "this double counting is avoided .",
    "it is also worth emphasizing that our total reconnection rate @xmath62 does not measure the sum of the reconnection rates of each individual reconnection region within the volume .",
    "the only way that this could be quantified would be to consider the local quasi - potential drop across each non - ideal region in turn .",
    "however , each region would have to be surrounded by ideal magnetic field for this to be meaningful .",
    "in fragmented current layers this is rarely the case as different current sheets partially overlap when merging or breaking apart . considering the collective behavior as we have done here is the only way to properly quantify such a system .",
    "given that we have introduced two different rates to describe this collective behavior , which should be used to characterise a given reconnection process ?",
    "it depends upon what is most of interest for the problem at hand .",
    "for instance , if one is considering the scaling of energy release compared with reconnection rate then the total rate is the better choice",
    ". it would also be the more relevant choice in situations where the rate at which flux is swept up by a fragmented reconnection region is of interest , as is thought to be related to photospheric brightening in solar flares ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "however , the net rate may be more useful when the multiple reconnection regions are fluctuating and transient ( as occurs during an increasing turbulent evolution of the magnetic field ) and there are some simple large scale symmetries against which flux transfer is wished to be know ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "ultimately the non - ideal physics associated with the plasma , any gradients in the mapping of the magnetic field and the way in which excess magnetic energy is built up will dictate where non - ideal regions form and if they subsequently fragment .",
    "the present analysis serves as a way of interpreting how the subsequent reconnection proceeds and how best to quantify it .",
