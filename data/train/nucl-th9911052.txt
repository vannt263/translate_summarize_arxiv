    "the presence of strong octupole correlations in nuclei is reflected in a significant lowering of the excitation energies of the negative parity states .",
    "this phenomena was observed in different nuclei @xcite . among them in @xmath1ra and @xmath2th isotopes which are considered as rotating octupole  deformed systems . in these nuclei",
    "low  lying negative parity states form the alternating parity bands together with the low  lying positive  parity states connected via strong e1 transitions .",
    "it is known that such rotational bands with @xmath3 , ... exist in molecules . however , in nuclei in contrast to molecules these bands are disturbed : the negative  parity states are shifted up in energy with respect to the positive  parity states .",
    "especially interesting is the angular momentum dependence of this parity splitting . at the beginning of the rotational band",
    "the positive and negative  parity states are split in energy by several hundreds of @xmath4 . even in octupole ",
    "deformed nuclei the parity splitting is 200300 @xmath4 . at higher values of the angular momentum",
    "the parity splitting decreases and the energies of both positive and negative  parity states start to have approximately the rotational angular momentum dependence appropriate to a @xmath0=0 band .",
    "thus , a unified alternating parity band is forming .",
    "however , not perfectly .",
    "namely , at some value of the angular momentum the parity splitting changes sign and the negative  parity states are lowered slightly below the positive  parity states .",
    "this effect is , however , 510 times smaller than the positive parity splitting observed at the beginning of the rotational band . with further increase of the angular momentum the value of this negative parity splitting decreases .",
    "thus , there are two different effects connected with parity splitting which manifest in the different ranges of the angular momentum scale . the large positive parity splitting at low angular momentum decreases with angular momentum where as the negative parity splitting which is 510 times smaller than the positive parity splitting appears at higher values of the angular momentum .",
    "to see both effects it is important to have the experimental data on both positive and negative  parity rotational states up to sufficiently high values of the angular momentum @xmath5 .",
    "beautiful data of this kind have been obtained recently by the liverpool group @xcite .",
    "the positive parity splitting was quantitatively interpreted in the framework of the model developed by us in @xcite for the angular momentum range available at that time . in the present paper",
    "we shall apply the model to the description of the new data of the liverpool group .",
    "we will show also how to generalize the model to incorporate the effect of the sign reversal of the parity splitting . as was discussed in @xcite the behaviour of the parity splitting from low to moderate values of @xmath5 , where the effect is largest ,",
    "can be explained in the framework of the one  dimensional model of the octupole motion conserving axial symmetry .",
    "we will show below that the smaller effect of the negative parity splitting can be explained by coriolis coupling of the negative parity states of the @xmath0=0 band to the octupole modes with @xmath60 .",
    "the model developed below is a phenomenological model . in principle ,",
    "parity splitting can be obtained naturally in the framework of the microscopic models with parity projection .",
    "for example , see the work by the madrid group @xcite , which employ selfconsistent mean field approach with parity projection .",
    "to explain the angular momentum dependence of the parity splitting at low @xmath5 the following model has been suggested in @xcite .",
    "it was assumed that at low to moderate angular momenta the parity splitting is connected with the octupole motion in a one  dimensional potential well depending on the collective variable @xmath7 which describes the axially symmetric octupole deformation . in nuclei with sufficiently strong octupole correlations or in octupole ",
    "deformed nuclei this potential has two minima which are symmetrically located at positive and negative values of @xmath7 .",
    "the two minima are separated by the barrier and the transition frequency corresponds to the parity splitting in the alternating parity bands .",
    "the height of the barrier depends on the angular momentum via a rotational energy term @xmath8 . due to dependence of the moment of inertia on the octupole deformation parameter @xmath7 @xcite the effective barrier height between two minima increases with angular momentum @xmath5 proportional to @xmath9 thus decreasing the probability of the barrier penetration . as a result",
    "the octupole deformation stabilizes and the parity splitting goes to zero . for physically reasonable shapes of the octupole potential",
    "it was shown that the parity splitting can be quite well described as an exponentially decreasing function of the barrier height .",
    "this result has been exploited to parameterize the angular momentum dependence of the parity splitting @xmath10 ( this quantity was introduced at first in @xcite ) in a simple fashion @xmath11 ( in the previous paper @xcite the notation @xmath12 has been used , however , instead of @xmath13 ) this formula has been suggested in @xcite .",
    "it contains two parameters and describes a smooth decrease of the parity splitting without changing of the sign of @xmath14 .",
    "the importance of the bands coupling effect for the description of the rotational alternating parity band was discussed in @xcite . in this section",
    "we consider phenomenologically a possible effect of the coriolis coupling of the @xmath16 and @xmath15 states .",
    "to do this we must have a model for the intrinsic state wave functions . a suitable formalism is the coherent state method @xcite . to use it",
    "we introduce at first creation and annihilation operators of the intrinsic phonons @xmath17 the intrinsic wave functions of the @xmath0=0 states with even angular momentum ( positive parity ) and odd angular momentum ( negative parity ) have different parities with respect to reflection .",
    "we will take the following expressions for them @xmath18 where @xmath19 . in ( [ coherent1_eq ] )",
    "the parameter @xmath20 is proportional to the octupole deformation parameter .",
    "when @xmath20 goes to zero we get @xmath21 thus , we get the limit of the harmonic octupole vibrations .",
    "it is seen that the states ( [ coherent1_eq ] ) with even and odd @xmath5 have a different parity with respect to the @xmath22 reflection , i.e. with respect to the @xmath23 transformation .",
    "it is easy to check and it is seen already from the limit ( [ states1_eq ] ) that odd angular momenta states have a larger average number of the @xmath24 octupole phonons than even angular momenta states .",
    "this circumstance is important for the consideration below . from this",
    "it follows that the coriolis matrix elements are larger for odd angular momenta states . for very large @xmath20 ( strong octupole deformation )",
    "this difference goes to zero .    for the intrinsic states with @xmath25 we use by analogy to ( [ coherent1_eq ] ) the following expression @xmath26",
    "the coriolis interaction has a standard form @xmath27 where @xmath28 it was suggested by bohr and mottelson @xcite to use the following expression for the matrix element @xmath29 in the case of the octupole excitations @xmath30 we will take , however , @xmath31 considering @xmath12 as a free parameter .",
    "however , @xmath32 .",
    "consider now a coriolis coupling of the @xmath24 and @xmath25 states for different angular momenta . in accordance with the arguments in section ii the odd @xmath5 , @xmath24 states ( [ coherent1_eq ] )",
    "are shifted up in energy with respect to the even @xmath5 , @xmath24 states by an amount of energy @xmath33 ( [ deltae_eq ] ) .",
    "we will assume that the @xmath0=1 phonon has an energy @xmath34 .",
    "in the nuclei considered below @xmath34 is much larger than @xmath35 , however .    for every value of the angular momentum we have two states : one with @xmath0=0 ( [ coherent1_eq ] ) and other with @xmath0=1 ( [ coherent2_eq ] ) .",
    "their energies are : 0 for @xmath0=0 and @xmath34+@xmath14 for @xmath0=1 and even angular momenta ( positive parity ) , and @xmath14 for @xmath0=0 and @xmath34 for @xmath0=1 and odd angular momenta ( negative parity ) .",
    "then , considering a coriolis interaction of the @xmath0=0 and @xmath0=1 states for different @xmath5 we have the following energy differences between mixing states : @xmath36 if @xmath5 is even and @xmath37 if @xmath5 is odd . thus , the energy denominators for the coriolis mixing are somewhat smaller for odd angular momenta compared to the even angular momenta . as a result",
    "the coriolis coupling becomes somewhat more strong for odd angular momenta states .",
    "this effect is similar to that found for odd nuclei @xcite where it explains a difference in the parity splitting in even @xmath38 and odd @xmath38 nuclei .",
    "consider now the matrix elements of the coriolis interaction ( [ coriolis1_eq ] ) between the @xmath0=0 ( [ coherent1_eq ] ) and @xmath0=1 ( [ coherent2_eq ] ) states .",
    "the square of this matrix element is proportional to an average number of the @xmath39 phonons in the corresponding states .",
    "as it is discussed above in this section the odd angular momenta states have a larger number of the @xmath39 phonons than even angular momenta states .",
    "therefore the coriolis interaction matrix elements are larger for odd angular momenta than for even angular momenta states . together with the somewhat less important fact that the energy differences between mixing states are somewhat larger for the odd @xmath5 states it means that the odd @xmath5 states of the alternating parity band will be shifted down more than the even @xmath5 states .",
    "this effect can explain the observed lowering of the odd i ( negative  parity ) states relative to the even @xmath5 states , i.e. sign reversal of the parity splitting at the large values of @xmath5 when the coriolis interaction becomes strong .",
    "when the octupole deformation is stabilized @xmath14 goes to zero , the difference in the coriolis matrix elements for odd and even @xmath5 states goes to zero as shown in ( [ split3_eq ] ) and we get an alternating parity band without staggering .",
    "let us introduce a quantity @xmath40 , which describes parity splitting in the ground state alternating parity band and , in contrast to @xmath14 , includes both barrier penetration and coriolis mixing effects . using the standard formulae for the two  level mixing we get the following expression for @xmath40 @xmath41}{\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{4}(1+\\frac{\\widetilde{\\delta e(i)}}{\\omega})^2   + \\frac{1}{\\omega   ^2}f^2_+(i)}+\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{4}(1-\\frac{\\widetilde{\\delta   e(i)}}{\\omega})^2 + \\frac{1}{\\omega ^2}f^2_-(i ) } } \\label{split1_eq}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath42 the quantity @xmath14 introduced in the preceding section includes only an effect of the barrier penetration . here",
    "@xmath43 ( @xmath44 ) is an average number of the @xmath24 octupole bosons in the @xmath5 even ( odd ) states . using the coherent states introduced above and the hamiltonian expressed in terms of the @xmath45 boson operators describing axially symmetric octupole motion and having a potential energy term with two octupole ",
    "deformed minima we can show numerically that when octupole deformation becomes relatively stable the following approximate expressions for @xmath46 can be used @xmath47^{b } \\right)\\nonumber\\\\ n_- ( i)\\simeq \\left [ \\frac{\\widetilde{\\delta e(i)}}{\\widetilde{\\delta   e(0)}}\\right ] ^{b } + n \\left ( 1-\\left [ \\frac{\\widetilde{\\delta   e(i)}}{\\widetilde{\\delta e(0)}}\\right ] ^{b } \\right ) \\label{split3_eq}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath48 .",
    "the results shown below are obtained with @xmath49=0.15 . however , when @xmath49=0.25 that fit is not changed essentially . in ( [ split3_eq ] )",
    "@xmath50 is a parameter depending on the parameters of the hamiltonian .",
    "we note that as follows from eqs .",
    "( [ split1_eq][split3_eq ] ) @xmath51 if @xmath52 .",
    "now the expression ( [ split1_eq ] ) for the parity splitting which includes the effects of the barrier penetration and of the coriolis mixing with the @xmath25 octupole vibrations is determined completely .",
    "it contains the following five parameters : @xmath53 , @xmath13 , @xmath54 , @xmath34 and @xmath50 . in the following section we will take two of these parameters , namely , @xmath34 and @xmath50 to be fixed for all considered nuclei . in some nuclei",
    "the value of @xmath34 is known.=20",
    "since positive and negative  parity states have different angular = momenta ( even and odd , correspondingly ) parity splitting can be determined only by interpolation of the experimental energies of the positive  parity states to odd angular momentum and vice versa .",
    "based only on the experimental energies we have used the following formula to determine experimental parity splitting @xmath55\\right.\\nonumber\\\\ \\left.-\\frac{1}{8}[e_{exp}(i+2)-2e_{exp}(i)+e_{exp}(i-2 ) ] \\right ) \\label{paritysplit_eq}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] if @xmath56 , and @xmath57\\right.\\nonumber\\\\ \\left.-\\frac{1}{8}[e_{exp}(4)-2e_{exp}(3)]\\right ) \\label{paritysplit1_eq}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for @xmath5=1 .",
    "we note that this formula differs slightly from the formula for @xmath58 which was used in @xcite .",
    "the quality of this formula can be verified by subtracting @xmath59 from the experimental energies @xmath60 @xmath61 the resulting function @xmath62 should be a smooth function of @xmath5 .",
    "we have calculated @xmath62 for all considered nuclei and found that @xmath62 is really a smooth function of @xmath5 .",
    "we consider the following nuclei : @xmath63ra and @xmath64th .",
    "the data are taken from @xcite .",
    "the experimental splitting @xmath58 is shown in figs .",
    "( 1 - 6 ) .",
    "it is compared to the theoretical splitting @xmath40 obtained from ( [ split1_eq][split3_eq ] ) . in calculating @xmath40",
    "we note that the value of @xmath34 is known for @xmath65ra ( 1053 kev ) and @xmath66ra ( 1048 kev ) .",
    "since these two energies are quite close we have taken @xmath34=1050 kev for all nuclei under consideration .",
    "we have also taken @xmath50=3 for all considered nuclei to reduce the number of the free parameters .",
    "this value is in a correspondence with the coherent states parameters obtained in @xcite .",
    "thus , to fit the experimental spectra we use 3 parameters for every nucleus , namely , @xmath53 , @xmath13 and @xmath67 .",
    "the results of the fit of the angular momentum dependence of the parity splitting @xmath40 are shown in figs.16 .",
    "the parameters used in the fit are presented in table 1 , where for completeness the values of the attenuation factor of the coriolis interaction are presented .",
    "if we estimate the value of @xmath68/@xmath69 fitting @xmath62 by the simple rotational formula @xmath70 we get for all considered nuclei the value of @xmath12 not exceeding 1.1 .",
    "we get the minimum value of @xmath12=0.6 for @xmath66ra .",
    "thus , the values of the coriolis strength parameter needed to fit the spectra are quite reasonable .",
    "the corresponding attenuation factor of the coriolis interaction takes the values between 0.28 and 0.44 .",
    "we have performed also the calculations with the same attenuation factor for all considered nuclei , which we have taken to be equal to 0.33 . in this case the results for parity splitting in @xmath64ra and @xmath65th are practically coincide with those shown in figs.2,3 and 5 .",
    "the results for @xmath66ra and @xmath71th deviate slightly from the preceding ones .",
    "however , these deviations do not exceed 6 kev for @xmath66ra and 5 kev for @xmath71th .",
    "the results obtained for @xmath72ra with common attenuation factor deviate from the best fit obtained for this nucleus more than for other considered nuclei .",
    "namely , these deviations take the values up to 20 kev .",
    "the results obtained with common attenuation factor 0.33 for @xmath73ra are presented in figs.1 and 4 .",
    "the value of @xmath53 characterize a stability of the octupole deformation in the ground state .",
    "this quantity is connected with the freequency of transition through the octupole barrier .",
    "the smaller the value of @xmath53 , the smaller the value of the transition freequency , the larger the barrier height separating two symmetrically located octupole minima with different signs of the octupole deformation . for nuclei considered in this paper @xmath53 takes the values between 200 kev and 300 kev .",
    "these values are the smallest ones among those known for the observed alternating parity bands . in ra isotopes",
    "the value of @xmath53 decreases initially when we go from @xmath66ra to lighter isotopes , indicating an increase of the strength of the octupole correlations .",
    "however , it increases again in @xmath72ra .",
    "probably , it is connected with the fact that @xmath72ra is a transitional nucleus with @xmath74=178 kev . in @xmath66ra @xmath74=68 kev .",
    "the same effect is observed in th isotopes . as is seen the largest deviations of the fit from the experimental data",
    "are obtained for @xmath72ra and @xmath71th .",
    "these two nuclei are rather transitional ones , however . @xcite .",
    "a model is developed to describe the angular momentum dependence of the parity splitting in the nuclei with strong octupole correlations .",
    "the model explains the positive parity splitting at the relatively low angular momenta and its dependence on @xmath5 as produced by a penetration of the barrier separating two symmetrically located octupole minima having different signs of the octupole deformation .",
    "it is demonstrated that the sign reversal of the parity splitting at higher values of @xmath5 can be interpreted as a result of the coriolis mixing with @xmath0=1 octupole mode",
    ". however , a consideration of this effect is qualitative and a more detailed treatment requires a microscopic approach . in some nuclei parity splitting changes the sign in second time @xcite although its absolute value decreases in average with @xmath5 increase .",
    "probably , it means that the coriolis mixing among several intrinsic states should be considered .",
