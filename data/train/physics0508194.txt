    "the emergence of hierarchies is a common phenomenon in societies and animal groups . in a pioneering work ,",
    "et al._@xcite have shown that a hierarchical society can emerge spontaneously from an equal society by a simple algorithm of fighting between individuals diffusing on a square lattice .",
    "on the basis of results of monte carlo simulation and an analysis by a mean field theory , they concluded that subcritical or supercritical bifurcations exist in the formation of the hierarchical structure as the density of individuals is varied . in their model , each individual is assumed to have some wealth or power which increases or decreases by winninng or losing in a fight .",
    "the essential processes of the model are diffusion , fighting and spontaneous relaxation of the wealth .",
    "various societies can be modelled by specifying each process and the emergence of the hierarchy depends strongly on the specifications.@xcite    in this paper , we investigate a variation of the model introduced by bonabeau _",
    "et al._@xcite , where the diffusion algorithm is modified to include the effect of the trend of society .",
    "namely , we study the emergence of hierarchies in a timid society , in which an individual always tries to avoid fighting and to fight with the weakest among the neighbors if he / she can not avoid fighting . by monte carlo simulation",
    ", we show that the emergence of the hierarchy is retarded in the timid society compared to the no - preference society investigated by bonabeau _",
    "et al . _ and",
    "that the transition to the hierarchical state occurs in two successive transitions of a continuous and a discontinuous ones .",
    "consequently , there exist three different states in the society , one equal and two hierarchical states . in the first hierarchical states , we see no winners but losers and people in the middle class . in the second hierarchical states , many winners emerge from the middle class .",
    "we also show that the distribution of wealth in the second hierarchical state is wider compared to the hierarchical state of the no - preference society .    in sec .",
    "2 , our model is explained in detail .",
    "results of monte carlo simulation are presented in sec .",

    "4 the characteristics of the hierarchical states is analyzed in detail .",
    "section 5 is devoted to discussion .",
    "we consider @xmath0 individuals diffusing on an @xmath1 square lattice , where every lattice site accomodates at most one individual .",
    "an individual is to move to one of nearest neighbor sites according to the following protocol . when individual @xmath2 tries to move to a site occupied by @xmath3 , @xmath2 and @xmath3",
    "fight each other . if @xmath2 wins , @xmath2 and @xmath3 exchange their positions , and if @xmath2 loses , they keep their original positions .",
    "we associate each individual a quantity which we call power or wealth .",
    "the power increases by unity for every victory and decreases by unity for every loss .",
    "the probability @xmath4 that @xmath2 wins the fight against @xmath3 is determined by the difference of their powers @xmath5 and @xmath6 as @xmath7 } , \\label{probability}\\ ] ] where @xmath8 is introduced as a controlling parameter . when @xmath9 , the stronger one always wins the fight and when @xmath10 , the winning probability of both ones are equal .",
    "we also assume that the power of individuals relaxes to zero when they do not fight , namely power @xmath11 at time @xmath12 is given by @xmath13 through@xcite @xmath14 .\\ ] ] here , the unit of time is defined by one monte carlo step during which every individual is accessed once for move and @xmath15 represents an additional controlling parameter .",
    "this relaxation rule indicates that people lose their wealth of a constant amount when their power is large , and when their power is small , they lose it at a constant fraction , namely they behave rather miserly .",
    "it also indicates that the negative wealth ( debt ) can relax to zero in the similar manner . note that this rerlaxation rule is critical to the emergence of hierarchical society.@xcite    we characterize the timid society by the preference of individuals in diffusion . in the timid society ,",
    "every individual favors not to fight and thus it moves to a vacant site if it exists .",
    "if no vacant sites exist in the nearest neighbors , then it moves to a site occupied by an individual whose power is the smallest among the neighbors .",
    "when more than two neighbors have the equal power , then an opponent is chosen randomly from them .",
    "we characterize the static status of the society by an order parameter @xmath16 which is defined by@xcite @xmath17 here , @xmath0 is the number of individuals , and @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the number of fights won and lost , respectively , by individual @xmath2 . note that @xmath20 corresponds to an egalitarian status and @xmath21 when the chance for victory @xmath22 is distributed uniformly in @xmath23 $ ] .",
    "after sufficiently long monte carlo simulation , variation of @xmath16 is stabilized and one can use it as an order parametrer .",
    "we also monitor the population profile by focusing on the winning probability .",
    "we classify individuals into three groups by the number of fights which an individual won ; winners are individuals who won more than 2/3 of fights and losers are individuals who won less than 1/3 of fights .",
    "individuals between these groups are called middle class .",
    "monte carlo simulation was performed for @xmath24 individuals on the square lattice with periodic boundary conditions from @xmath25 to @xmath26 .",
    "we obtained the order parameter @xmath27 and other quantities for @xmath28 monte carlo steps .",
    "as a function of @xmath29 with @xmath30 , for four different values of @xmath8 : @xmath31 @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 .",

    "we can see two clear transitions ; one at a lower critical density @xmath38 and the other at a higher critical density @xmath39 .",

    "winners and losers lose their memory of previous fight before they engage in the next fight , and thus they changes their status in time . in the hierarchical state , a winner keeps winning and a loser keeps losing .",
    "we discuss the difference between type i and type ii hierarchical society in the next section .",
    "the results strongly depend on @xmath15 .",

    "in order to investigate the structure of the hierarchical states , we analyze profile of population . the dependence of the population of each class is plotted against the density in fig .",
    "rapid changes of the populations signify emergence of different state of the hierarchical societies . in the egalitarian state @xmath40 ,",
    "all individuals belong to the middle class as expected . in the hierachical society",
    "i @xmath41 , some individuals become losers whose number increases as the density is increased , but no winners are seen . in the hierachical state ii @xmath45 , many winners appear and the population in the middle class is reduced significantly .     and @xmath46 . , height=302 ]    figures 5 ( a ) , ( b ) and ( c ) show the spacial distribution of individuals after @xmath28 monte carlo steps in the egalitarian , the first hierarchical and the second hierarchical states , respectively .",

    "6 . from this plot",
    ", we conclude that ( 1 ) in the hierarichical state i , people in the middle class with slightly higher winning probability increase , but no winners are seen and ( 2 ) in the hierarchical state ii , the most of winners have very high winning probability , while people in the losers and the middle class are distributed in a wide region of the winning probability ,    .,height=302 ]",
    "we have investigated the emergence of self - organized hierarchies in the timid society .",
    "our results show that the emergence of the hierarchical state in the timid society is retarded compared to the no - preference society .",
    "this delay is natural since individuals in the timid society tend to avoid fighting and thus the wealth is distriruted more or less evenly among individuals when the population is low .",
    "furthermore , the emergence of the hierarchical society in the timid society occurs in two steps , and the first transition is continuous and the second one is discontinuous .",
    "the strength of the hierarchy in the high density region is stronger in the timid society compared to the no - preference society .",
    "for the same choice of @xmath44 and @xmath37 , @xmath27 for the former case is twice as large as the latter@xcite .    to understand these behaviors , we first remind the fact that the the hierarchical society emerges when the power can not relax before the subsequet fight . in the timid society ,",
    "an idividual can avoid fighting when the density is low , and thus the ealitarian state is favored for low densities . in the timid society , weaker individuals have more chance to be challenged and thus to lose their power , and stronger ones has less chance to fight and their power stay near zero .",
    "this situation corresponds to the hierarchical state i. when the density is increased above the upper critical density , all individuals have more chance to fight and thus stronger individuals become much stronger .    99 e. bonabeau , g. theraulaz and j .- l .",
