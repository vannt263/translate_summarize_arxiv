    "cork twist_. a cork , as originally envisioned , is a contractible , smooth submanifold @xmath0 of a closed 4-manifold @xmath2 , with an involution @xmath1 of @xmath3 , such that cutting out @xmath0 and regluing it by the twist @xmath1 changes the diffeomorphism type of @xmath2 ( while necessarily preserving its homeomorphism type ) .",
    "we can think of @xmath0 as a control knob with two settings , toggling between two smoothings of @xmath2 .",
    "the first example of a cork was discovered by akbulut @xcite .",
    "subsequently , various authors ( @xcite , @xcite , see @xcite for more history ) showed that any two homeomorphic , simply connected ( smooth ) 4-manifolds are related by a cork twist . since then , much work has been done ( eg @xcite , @xcite ) to understand and apply cork twists .",
    "various people , going back at least to freedman in the 1990s , have asked whether higher order corks may exist  that is , knobs with @xmath4 settings for @xmath4 different diffeomorphism types , or possibly even infinitely many settings all realizing distinct types .",
    "recently , progress has been made by modifying known examples of corks : tange @xcite exhibited knobs with @xmath4 settings for any finite @xmath4 , displaying two diffeomorphism types on @xmath2 .",
    "independently , auckly , kim , melvin and ruberman @xcite constructed the desired finite order corks .",
    "more generally , they constructed @xmath5-corks for any finite subgroup @xmath5 of @xmath6 , where the control knob can be set to any element of @xmath5 to yield @xmath7 diffeomorphism types .",
    "however , both of these latter papers pose the infinite order case as a still unsolved problem , in spite of fruitless attacks by various mathematicians .",
    "the purpose of the present article is to exhibit a large family of infinite order corks , arising from a simple general construction .",
    "there is variation in the literature about the definition of a cork .",
    "all approaches share the following :    a _ cork _",
    "@xmath8 is a smooth , compact , contractible 4-manifold @xmath0 with a diffeomorphism @xmath9 .",
    "the cork will be called _ nontrivial _ if @xmath1 does not extend to a self - diffeomorphism of @xmath0 .",
    "if @xmath0 is smoothly embedded in a 4-manifold @xmath2 , cutting out @xmath0 and regluing it by @xmath1 to get @xmath10 will be called a _ twist _ by @xmath1 .    note",
    "that @xmath11 is then a cork for any @xmath12 , so we also talk about twisting by powers @xmath13 . by freedman @xcite , @xcite , @xmath1 necessarily extends to a self - homeomorphism of @xmath0 , so a cork twist does not change the homeomorphism type of a manifold .",
    "in some references , @xmath1 is required to be an involution , or extend to a finite cyclic ( or other finite ) group action on @xmath3 . since we are interested in @xmath14-actions , no additional hypothesis is needed .",
    "we can now state our main existence theorem , which is proved in section  [ cons ] .",
    "[ main ] there is a cork @xmath8 and a smooth embedding of @xmath0 into a closed , simply connected 4-manifold @xmath2 , for which the manifolds @xmath15 , @xmath12 , obtained by twisting by @xmath13 are homeomorphic but pairwise nondiffeomorphic .",
    "hence , the corks @xmath11 are distinct ( up to diffeomorphism commuting with the maps ) , and nontrivial unless @xmath16 .    in the terminology of @xcite ,",
    "the embedding @xmath17 is _ @xmath14-effective _ and exhibits @xmath8 as the first example of a _",
    "@xmath14-cork_.    the homology 3-sphere @xmath3 bounds infinitely many smooth , contractible manifolds that are all diffeomorphic , homeomorphic rel boundary and pairwise nondiffeomorphic rel boundary .",

    "there is a compact , contractible 4-manifold admitting infinitely many nondiffeomorphic smooth structures .",
    "this follows immediately from the previous corollary and @xcite .",
    "we obtain infinitely many examples of corks @xmath8 as in the theorem , distinguished by the homeomorphism types of their boundaries . however , our examples all have a simple form . for any knot @xmath18 ,",
    "let @xmath19 be its closed complement , and let @xmath20 be the oriented 4-manifold obtained from @xmath21 , where @xmath22 denotes the interval @xmath23 $ ] throughout the paper , by attaching a 2-handle along the meridian to @xmath24 in @xmath25 with framing @xmath26 .",
    "note that @xmath21 can be identified with the obvious ribbon complement of @xmath27 in @xmath28 , so this is a special case of removing a slice disk and regluing it with a twist .",
    "either perspective reveals the identity @xmath29 , and these are orientation - reversing diffeomorphic to @xmath30 .",
    "clearly , @xmath20 is the 4-ball when @xmath31 or @xmath24 is unknotted , but otherwise it is a contractible manifold whose boundary is irreducible and not @xmath32 .",
    "in fact , @xmath33 is obtained by @xmath34-surgery on @xmath35 , and contains two oppositely oriented copies of the complement @xmath19 .",
    "since these complements can be recovered from the 3-manifold @xmath33 by the jsj decomposition , it follows that such manifolds are never orientation - preserving homeomorphic unless the corresponding knots are the same up to orientation and the ( nonzero ) integers are equal . in our examples",
    ", @xmath24 is the double twist knot @xmath36 shown in figure  [ knot ] , where the boxes count full twists , right - handed when the integer is positive .",
    "the resulting oriented 4-manifolds @xmath37 , for @xmath38 and @xmath39 , are not orientation - preserving homeomorphic to each other unless the integers @xmath26 agree and the pairs @xmath40 agree up to order . in general , the incompressible torus @xmath41 in @xmath33 can be used to create self - diffeomorphisms of the latter : let @xmath42 be obtained by rotating the torus @xmath43 parallel to the canonical longitude of @xmath24 , through angle @xmath44 , @xmath45 $ ] , as we pass through @xmath46 , and extending as the identity .",
    "our simplest cork , @xmath47 is made in this manner from the figure - eight knot @xmath48 .",
    "its boundary is given by surgery with coefficient 1 on the connected sum of two figure - eight knots , with the obvious incompressible torus in the complement of this sum .",

    "our incompressible torus in @xmath20 can be also used to define other twists . instead of twisting parallel to the longitude",
    ", we could twist parallel to the meridian , or more generally , twist using any element of @xmath55 .",
    "thus , it is natural to ask both about other contractible manifolds and other twists :    \\(a ) is every pair @xmath56 , for @xmath24 a nontrivial knot , @xmath39 and @xmath1 a longitudinal twist as given above , a @xmath14-cork ?",
    "\\(b ) does twisting by other elements of @xmath57 ever extend these to @xmath58-corks ?",
    "akbulut @xcite previously studied the meridian twist for @xmath24 the trefoil and @xmath59 , trying to prove nontriviality .",

    "see that paper for further discussion and the translation of the main proofs of this paper into the language of handle calculus .",
    "the question is still open for meridian twists when @xmath61 and for longitudinal twists with knots @xmath24 outside our family @xmath62 , such as the trefoil .",
    "the author would like to thank cameron gordon , danny ruberman and andrs stipsicz for helpful comments .",
    "the closed manifolds @xmath15 in theorem  [ main ] are are made from the elliptic surface @xmath63 , for a fixed @xmath64 , by the fintushel - stern knot construction @xcite . recall ( eg @xcite ) that @xmath63 has a standard description in which it is built from @xmath65 ( a neighborhood of a regular fiber @xmath66 ) by adding handles .",
    "of most interest for present purposes , each of the two circle factors has @xmath67 parallel copies ( _ vanishing cycles _ ) to which 2-handles are attached with framing @xmath68 ( relative to the product framing of the boundary 3-torus ) .",
    "we will use three of these 2-handles . given a knot @xmath69 ,",
    "let @xmath70 denote its closed complement .",
    "the knot construction consists of removing @xmath65 from @xmath63 and replacing it by @xmath71 , gluing by a diffeomorphism of the boundary 3-torus that identifies the canonical longitude of @xmath72 with @xmath73 , and the meridian of @xmath72 and circle @xmath74 in @xmath71 with copies of the two circle factors of @xmath75 .",
    "as detailed in @xcite , freedman s classification @xcite , @xcite shows that the resulting manifold @xmath76 retains the homeomorphism type of @xmath63 ( which is simply connected with @xmath77 and signature @xmath78 , and is even if and only if @xmath4 is ) .",
    "however when @xmath79 , varying the knot @xmath72 results in diffeomorphism types that are distinguished by their seiberg - witten invariants if and only if the knots in question are distinguished by their alexander polynomials .",
    "the structure of the seiberg - witten invariants then also shows that each @xmath76 is irreducible . when @xmath80 the discussion becomes more technical , but these statements remain true for the @xmath81-twist knots @xmath82 with @xmath12 @xcite , except that the unknot @xmath83 yields the reducible manifold @xmath84 , a sum of copies of @xmath85 . for fixed @xmath64 ,",
    "let @xmath15 be obtained as above from the twist knot @xmath86 .",
    "since these knots are distinguished by their alexander polynomials , theorem  [ main ] follows once we locate a contractible @xmath87 with a twist @xmath1 for which each power @xmath13 gives the corresponding @xmath15 .",
    "let @xmath93 be the punctured torus depicted in figure  [ torus ] ( near the clasp of @xmath86 , the @xmath94 twist box in figure  [ knot ] ) with circles @xmath95 generating its homology .",
    "set @xmath16 for this , but note that the corresponding picture for any @xmath81 ( with the correct longitude ) is then obtained from the @xmath16 case by @xmath96-surgery on the circle @xmath88 . to examine this surgery more closely , identify a tubular neighborhood of @xmath89 in @xmath70 with @xmath97 , where @xmath98 $ ] and @xmath99 contains the outer part of the boundary of @xmath97 visible in the figure .",
    "let @xmath100 be a collar of @xmath101 in @xmath89 .",
    "then we can perform the required surgery by cutting out and regluing the solid torus @xmath102 .",
    "since the surgery coefficient has numerator 1 , we can take the gluing diffeomorphism to be the identity everywhere except on the annulus @xmath103 .",
    "that is , we get from the @xmath16 case to the case of arbitrary @xmath81 by slitting @xmath70 open along the annulus @xmath103 and regluing by @xmath104 for a suitable dehn twist @xmath105 of the annulus .",
    "hence , to transform @xmath106 to @xmath15 , we slit @xmath106 open along the 3-manifold @xmath107 and reglue by @xmath108 .",
    "( this operation can be viewed as a torus surgery , also called a logarithmic transformation , and would be a luttinger surgery if @xmath109 could be made lagrangian .",
    "the latter is ruled out , however , since @xmath15 has no symplectic structure unless @xmath110 . )",
    "our goal is to find a contractible manifold @xmath111 whose boundary contains @xmath112 .",
    "extending @xmath113 as the identity over the rest of @xmath3 then gives the required diffeomorphism @xmath1 completing the proof .",
    "our first approximation to @xmath0 is the manifold @xmath114 .",
    "then @xmath115 clearly contains @xmath112 , but @xmath116 is far from being contractible .",
    "in fact , @xmath116 is homotopy equivalent to @xmath117 , so it has @xmath118 and @xmath119 , but no higher dimensional homology .",
    "its fundamental group is generated by three circles @xmath120 , @xmath121 ( suitably attached to the base point ) , where for @xmath122 , @xmath123 and @xmath124 , for distinct points @xmath125 and @xmath126 . a basis for @xmath127 is given by the pair of tori @xmath128 , @xmath122 , where @xmath129 is parallel to @xmath130 in @xmath131 . to improve @xmath116 , observe in figure  [ torus ] that the circles @xmath95 in @xmath70 are both meridians of the knot @xmath83 .",
    "thus , the knot construction matches all three circles @xmath132 with vanishing cycles of @xmath63 .",
    "we obtain a new manifold @xmath133 by ambiently attaching a @xmath134-framed 2-handle @xmath135 to @xmath116 along @xmath120 for each @xmath121 .",
    "then @xmath136 is simply connected with @xmath137 , @xmath122 , still giving a basis for @xmath138 , and @xmath112 still contained in @xmath139 . to eliminate the last homology ,",
    "note that for @xmath122 , the core of the handle @xmath135 fits together with the annulus @xmath140 , forming a pair of disks @xmath141 disjointly embedded rel boundary in @xmath136 ( with @xmath142 ) . since each @xmath143 is empty , and @xmath144 is a single point of transverse intersection , deleting tubular neighborhoods of these disks from @xmath136 gives a manifold @xmath0 with no homology . to see that @xmath145 vanishes , use the core of the 2-handle @xmath146 to surger the tori @xmath137 to immersed spheres , without changing the intersections with the disks @xmath141 .",
    "these spheres then provide nullhomotopies for the meridians of the disks .",
    "thus , @xmath0 is a contractible manifold whose boundary contains @xmath112 , as required .    to identify the cork",
    "@xmath0 constructed in the proof of theorem  [ main ] , first consider any framed sphere @xmath147 in a manifold @xmath148 . if we add a handle @xmath149 to @xmath150 along @xmath151 , and then delete a neighborhood of the core of @xmath149 , extended down to @xmath152 using the annulus @xmath153 , the result is easily seen to be @xmath21 , where @xmath19 is made from @xmath148 by surgery on @xmath147 .",
    "we apply this trick with @xmath154 from the previous proof . attaching the handles @xmath155 to @xmath156 and deleting their cores @xmath157",
    "gives a manifold of the form @xmath21 that will become @xmath0 when @xmath146 is attached .",
    "the manifold @xmath19 is obtained from @xmath148 by surgery on the disjoint curves @xmath158 , with the framings induced from their identification with vanishing cycles of @xmath63 .",
    "these framings are @xmath68 relative to the oriented boundary of the fiber neighborhood in @xmath63 on which we performed the fintushel - stern construction , and hence , relative to @xmath115 . however , the circles @xmath159 lie on opposite faces of @xmath116 ( with @xmath22 coordinate @xmath160 ) , which inherit opposite orientations from @xmath148 .",
    "thus , the framing coefficients are @xmath161 relative to @xmath148 . to construct a surgery diagram of @xmath148",
    ", we cap off @xmath89 to get an embedding @xmath162 , with the latter exhibited as 0-surgery on the borromean rings @xmath163 .",
    "to recover @xmath148 , we remove its complementary solid torus in @xmath164 .",
    "this has the effect of undoing one dehn filling , leaving one component of @xmath163 unfilled .",
    "the curves @xmath165 correspond to canonical longitudes of this drilled out link component , and @xmath166 is a meridian of it .",
    "the surgery curves @xmath158 are then @xmath161-framed meridians of the other two components .",
    "blowing down changes the unfilled curve into a figure - eight knot @xmath48 in @xmath32 , whose complement is @xmath19 .",
    "attaching @xmath146 to @xmath21 along @xmath167 now gives @xmath168 , and @xmath169 is identified with the incompressible torus boundary of the figure - eight complement inside @xmath3 , with @xmath1 twisting longitudinally as required .",
    "now that we have realized @xmath170 as the cork @xmath0 in theorem  [ main ] , using 4-manifolds @xmath15 generated from @xmath63 ( so irreducible except for @xmath106 when @xmath80 ) , we can easily realize any @xmath51 with @xmath171 by giving up irreducibility : just blow up points on the cores of the handles @xmath135 to suitably lower their framings ( as measured in @xmath63 ) .",
    "this replaces the original manifolds @xmath15 by their @xmath172-fold blowups , which remain pairwise nondiffeomorphic . to realize @xmath173 , simply reverse the orientation on each @xmath15 . retaining irreducibility is no harder when the integers @xmath50 , @xmath52 and @xmath26 are all odd .",
    "simply choose @xmath4 large enough that @xmath63 contains @xmath174 disjoint spheres of square @xmath175 avoiding the submanifolds used in our construction .",
    "tubing the 2-handle cores into these spheres has the same effect as blowing up , without changing @xmath15 .",
    "when the integers @xmath50 , @xmath52 and @xmath53 are also allowed to be even but not 2 , we need an additional trick .",
    "every elliptic surface @xmath63 with @xmath79 has _ rim tori _ , which are homologically essential lagrangian tori that are disjoint from a section .",
    "let @xmath106 in the above construction be obtained from @xmath63 , for @xmath4 sufficiently large , by symplectic sum @xcite with @xmath176 along a rim torus in each . since @xmath106 is symplectic , it has a nontrivial seiberg - witten invariant , and the complement in @xmath106 of a fiber @xmath75 of the @xmath63 summand is simply connected ( because of the section of @xmath63 ) . by a useful result of sunukjian @xcite , these two conditions guarantee that when we perform the fintushel - stern construction on @xmath75 in @xmath106 , the resulting homeomorphic manifolds will not be diffeomorphic , provided that the knots have different alexander polynomials .",
    "our resulting @xmath14-family of distinct manifolds @xmath15 is still irreducible ( since the difference of any two basic classes has square 0 ) , but we have nine spheres of square @xmath177 coming from the sections of @xmath176 .",
    "using up to three of these spheres along with our previous even ones allows us to realize any positive values of @xmath50 , @xmath52 and @xmath53 except 2 .    [ even ]",
    "( a ) this argument misses the case with @xmath50 , @xmath52 or @xmath53 equal to 2 , for the technical reason that a disjoint sphere of square @xmath68 would mean our starting manifold was reducible .",
    "it seems reasonable to conjecture that irreducibility is still attainable by a different method in this case .",
    "\\(b ) each of our @xmath14-corks @xmath178 ( @xmath171 ) generates many other similar families of closed manifolds .",
    "we can vary the starting manifold @xmath106 and distinguish the resulting manifolds @xmath15 from each other by sunukjian s result , then distinguish various families from each other by their seiberg - witten invariants . alternatively , since our construction only uses a single clasp of the knots @xmath86 , we can apply the construction to other families of knots ( or links ) related by the twisting of a clasp described by figure  [ torus ] .",
    "\\(c ) our corks @xmath51 all have mazur type , built with a single handle of each index 0 , 1 and 2 .",
    "this is because they have the form @xmath20 for a 2-bridge knot @xmath24 ( namely @xmath179 ) .",
