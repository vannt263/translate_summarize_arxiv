    "the hi  column density distribution function @xmath0 is one of the most basic statistics of quasar absorption systems , similarly to the luminosity function of galaxies .",
    "the accuracy of observational data on @xmath0 has dramatically improved over the past several years , thanks to the large samples of damped ly@xmath1 systems ( dlas ) and sub - dlas discovered in large data sets of quasar spectra ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "their results indicate that the observed @xmath0 of dlas can be fitted well with either a double power - law or a schechter - type function",
    ".    it would be desirable to understand the physical origin of the shape of @xmath0 in a cosmological context of the standard @xmath6 cold dark matter model .",
    "the first such attempt was made by @xcite , who used a cosmological smoothed particle hydrodynamics ( sph ) simulation with a comoving box - size of 22.22@xmath7 , @xmath8 particles , and cosmological parameters @xmath9 .",
    "they found that their simulation underpredicted @xmath0 compared to the observational data by a factor of few or more , using a uniform ultraviolet background ( uvb ) @xmath10 at @xmath2 , where @xmath11 is the lyman - limit frequency and @xmath12ergs@xmath13@xmath14sr@xmath13hz@xmath13 .",
    "the uvb is usually treated with an optically thin limit regardless of gas density in cosmological hydrodynamic simulations owing to the computational limit .",
    "this simplified approximation may artificially increase the ionization fraction of gas , and gives rise to the discrepancy in @xmath0 .",
    "@xcite updated the work of @xcite using cosmological sph simulations with a comoving box size of 10@xmath7 , @xmath15 particles , and @xmath16 .",
    "interestingly , they also found a similar underprediction of @xmath0 compared to the observations , despite significantly higher resolution than that of @xcite .",
    "their simulations included a uniform uvb of @xcite spectrum , modified by @xcite to match the ly@xmath1 forest observations .",
    "we have attempted to resolve this discrepancy by modifying the models of star formation ( sf ) and supernova feedback ; e.g. , changing the sf threshold density , sf time - scale , feedback strengths , or adding metal - line cooling @xcite .",
    "however , none of these changes in the physical models resolved the discrepancy in @xmath0 fundamentally .    in this letter , we show that the effect of uvb is the key in determining the shape of @xmath0 at @xmath17 .",
    "in addition , we consider the effect of local stellar radiation on @xmath0 by performing a radiative transfer ( rt ) calculation . our paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : sim ] , we briefly describe the setup of our simulations , and present the results in section  [ sec : result ] .",
    "we then discuss the comparison with other recent works , and conclude in section  [ sec : discussion ] .",
    "we use the updated version of the tree - particle - mesh sph code gadget-3 ( originally described in * ? ? ?",
    "our conventional code includes radiative cooling by h , he , and metals @xcite , heating by a uniform uvb of a modified @xcite spectrum @xcite , sf , supernova feedback , a phenomenological model for galactic winds , and a sub - resolution model of multiphase interstellar medium ( ism ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in this multiphase ism model ,",
    "high - density ism is pictured to be a two - phase fluid consisting of cold clouds in pressure equilibrium with a hot ambient phase .",
    "cold clouds grow by radiative cooling out of the hot medium , and this material forms the reservoir of baryons available for sf .",
    "we use the `` pressure sf '' model described by @xcite ( which is based on the work by @xcite ) , but we have checked that the details of the sf model do not change the main conclusions of this paper .    for all the simulations used in this paper , we employ a box size of comoving 10@xmath7 and a total particle number of @xmath18 for gas and dark matter .",
    "the initial gas particle mass is @xmath19 , and the dark matter particle mass is @xmath20 .",
    "the comoving gravitational softening length is @xmath21 , so the physical resolution of our simulation is @xmath220.7@xmath23 at @xmath2 .",
    "@xcite showed that increasing the particle number from @xmath18 to @xmath15 did not change the shape of @xmath0 very much , therefore our results would not be strongly affected by the resolution effect .",
    "( but see further discussion in section  [ sec : discussion ] . ) the comoving box size of 10@xmath7 is somewhat small , however , the number of missed very massive haloes are relatively small , and the impact on @xmath0 is expected to be small . in fact @xcite showed that @xmath0 did not change very much with increasing box size , except that the lower @xmath24 end of @xmath0 decreased due to lower resolution . in this work , we have not corrected our results for the box size effect .",
    "the adopted cosmological parameters of all simulations are consistent with the latest wmap result @xcite : @xmath25 , where @xmath26 .",
    "with this setup , we run four simulations with different models of uvb : `` fiducial '' , `` no - uv '' , `` half - uv '' , and `` otuv '' ( optically thick uv ) runs . in the fiducial run , the gas is heated and ionized by the uniform uvb under the optically thin approximation . in the no - uv run ,",
    "the uvb strength is set to zero . in the half - uv run",
    ", the normalization of uvb is reduced by half . in the otuv run",
    ", we assume that the uniform uvb can not penetrate into the high - density gas with @xmath27 , but otherwise it is the same as the fiducial run at @xmath28 .",
    "we adopt the threshold density @xmath29@xmath5 , where @xmath30 is the sf threshold density above which the stars are allowed to form . in our simulations , the gas with @xmath31 is mostly neutral owing to the multiphase ism model .",
    "we originally arrived at the above value of @xmath32 by successively lowering its value from @xmath30 and checking the agreement with the observed @xmath0 , but will provide further justifications below .",
    "there is evidence that the above value of @xmath32 is physically appropriate .",
    "@xcite found that the hydrogen cloud becomes fully self - shielded above a critical density of @xmath33@xmath5 through rt calculations for a spherical top - hat sphere , and that the critical density has a mild dependence on the cloud mass and the uvb intensity .",
    "@xcite performed a three - dimensional uvb rt calculation with an isothermal sphere , and showed that the above value of @xmath32 approximately corresponds to the transition density from hii  to hi .",
    "@xcite postprocessed cosmological sph simulations with a ray tracing code and found that turning off uvb at @xmath34@xmath5 produces a favorable result .",
    "furthermore , we also confirmed that the above @xmath32 is appropriate by postprocessing our simulations with a rt code , which we will report in detail in a separate paper ( h. yajima et al .",
    ", 2011 , in preparation ) . for these reasons",
    ", we consider that the correct value of @xmath32 is in the range of @xmath35 to @xmath36@xmath5 , depending on the cloud mass and uvb intensity .",
    "for the four runs with different treatment of uvb .",

    "figure[fig : fn ] shows the @xmath0 in the four runs with different uvb treatment , which was calculated by the same method described in @xcite . in short",
    ", we set up a uniform grid around each dark matter halo , and project the gas density field onto a face of the grid to compute @xmath24 .",
    "figure[fig : fn ] clearly shows that the fiducial run underpredicts the @xmath0 , particularly at @xmath37 .",
    "the half - uv run is somewhat higher than the fiducial run , but still not enough to account for the observed number of columns at @xmath38 . on the other hand",
    ", the no - uv run completely overpredicts the observed @xmath0 at all column densities .",
    "the sudden decrease in @xmath0 from the no - uv run to the half - uv run shows that even a weak uvb can ionize the gas and the simulation can not account for the observed number of columns .",
    "the otuv run agrees very well with the observed data at @xmath39 .",
    "the comparison of these four runs suggests that the uvb affects the shape of @xmath0 significantly , and that applying the optically thin approximation at all densities is too simplistic to reproduce the observed @xmath0 properly .",
    "our simulations overpredict @xmath0 at @xmath40@xmath14 . but this could be because our simulations do not take into account the conversion of hi  into h@xmath41 , and the conclusion of this paper does not depend on this issue .    to obtain a better physical intuition on the effect of uvb , we plot the hydrogen neutral fraction ( @xmath42 ) and temperature against gas density for the four runs in figure  [ fig : phase ] .",
    "the difference of @xmath0 between the fiducial and the otuv run must be due to the different neutral fraction of gas at @xmath43 in the two runs .",
    "the fiducial run predicts a high degree of ionization at @xmath44 ( @xmath45@xmath5 ) .",
    "for example , the gas with @xmath46@xmath5 at @xmath47 has @xmath48 for the fiducial run . by referencing to @xmath0",
    ", the gas with this density should correspond to the dlas with @xmath49 , and @xmath48 is too low to match the observed data on @xmath0 .",
    "the half - uv run has a higher neutral fraction for the gases with @xmath44 , but still with @xmath50 .",
    "in contrast , most hydrogen in the no - uv run has @xmath51 , except for the small fraction of hot gas which is ionized by collisional ionization in shocked regions .",
    "eliminating the uvb completely is not a realistic assumption , and the no - uv run clearly overpredicts @xmath0 as expected .",
    "lastly , in the otuv run , the gas with @xmath27 has @xmath51 , which allows it to match the observed @xmath0 .",
    "figures[fig : fn ] and [ fig : phase ] clearly show that the optically thin approximation ionizes the gas with @xmath43 too much . in order to properly reproduce the observed @xmath0 with our simulations",
    ", the gas should be mostly neutral at @xmath27 .",
    "the effects of uvb can also be seen in the @xmath52 phase diagrams in the bottom panels of figure  [ fig : phase ] .",
    "the comparison of the fiducial and no - uv runs shows the well - known photoionization effect on the diffuse igm at low densities of @xmath53@xmath5 .",
    "compared to the fiducial run , the gas with @xmath43 in the otuv run is almost fully neutral with a lower temperature of @xmath54k .",
    "we will show in a separate paper ( h. yajima et al .",
    ", 2011 , in preparation ) that a full rt calculation supports the results shown in figure[fig : phase](d ) .",
    "the otuv run is remarkably successful in reproducing the observed @xmath0 at @xmath55 , but so far we have neglected the radiative effects of the stellar radiation from local stellar sources , which could heat and ionize the high - density gas in the star - forming regions .     at @xmath2 .",
    "the observational data points are the same as in figure  [ fig : fn ] .",
    "the two lines for the otuv with and without rt ( red dashed and blue solid lines , respectively ) are almost overlapping with each other . ]    in order to consider the effects of local stellar radiation , we postprocess our simulation with the authentic radiation transfer ( art ) code @xcite , which uses the ray - tracing technique .",
    "we have performed the rt calculation in a similar fashion to the one we did in @xcite , taking the rt grid cell size equal to the gravitational softening length . this way the resolution of the rt calculation is fixed for all halos .",
    "figure  [ fig : fn_rt ] compares the results from the otuv run with and without the rt calculation .",
    "the transferred stellar spectra are computed by using the p ' egase v2.0 @xcite based on the mass , formation time , and age of the star particles generated in the simulation .",
    "we find that the local stellar radiation does not have a significant impact on the shape of @xmath0 , as shown by the red long - dashed line in figure[fig : fn_rt ] , which is almost overlapping with the original otuv run without rt .",
    "this is because the stellar radiation can only increase the ionization fraction of gas near the ionization boundary where it makes a transition from neutral to highly ionized , and the high density neutral gas remains largely intact",
    ". we will report more details of the rt calculation results in a separate publication ( h. yajima et al .",
    "2011 , in preparation ) .",
    "using cosmological sph simulations , we examined the effects of uvb on @xmath0 , and clarified the reason why earlier simulations have underestimated this quantity compared to the observations .",
    "we find that the radiation sinks into the halo gas too deeply under the optically thin approximation of uvb , and the gas with @xmath55 is overly ionized .",
    "if we turn off the uvb above a physical density of @xmath56@xmath5 , then we reproduce the observed @xmath0 at @xmath2 very well .",
    "the exact value of @xmath32 would depend on the details of the spectral shape and the intensity of uvb , and the size of gas cloud @xcite .",
    "based on the comparison to other works , we consider that a value of @xmath57@xmath5 would be appropriate for current cosmological simulations .",
    "our results clearly show that the optically thin approximation was responsible for the failure in matching the observed @xmath0 in earlier simulations .",
    "recently , problems in the optically thin approximation have been pointed out in the context of the heii  reionization effect on the thermal history of igm @xcite and ly-@xmath1 emission @xcite .",
    "our present work is another example of inadequacy of optically thin approximation of uvb for modeling the ionization of gas near dlas .",
    "the rt effects , as well as the exact shape of uvb , have significant impact on the details of galaxy formation history including dlas ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "although cosmological rt simulations are beginning to be performed , it is still difficult to do a self - consistent ray - tracing rt calculation concurrently with the hydrodynamics due to limited computational speed . under this circumstance",
    ", it would still help to have a physically plausible working model of self - shielding for cosmological simulations .",
    "our result provides a useful proxy for the threshold density ( @xmath32 ) above which the self - shielding effect kicks in .",
    "we also examined the effects of local stellar radiation by postprocessing the simulation with a ray - tracing code .",
    "the effect is not as strong as the uvb , and it only slightly decreases @xmath0 .",
    "we will report the further details of this ray - tracing work and its effect on dla cross section in a separate publication ( h. yajima et al .",
    "2011 , in preparation ) .    to put it in another way",
    ", our results suggest that the shape of @xmath0 and the ionization structure of sub - dlas and dlas would be great probes of uvb at high redshift , and that the dla gas is closely related to the transition region from optically - thin ionized gas to optically - thick neutral gas within dark matter halos .",
    "further comparisons on the physical properties of dlas , sub - dlas , and lyman limit systems between simulations and observations would give us useful insight on the nature of uvb .",
    "in section  [ sec : sim ] we argued that our results are not strongly affected by the numerical resolution of our current simulations , based on the results of @xcite .",
    "however the simulations of @xcite did not include the self - shielding treatment of the otuv run , so to really test the resolution effect , we would have to run a new otuv simulation with @xmath15 particles , which we plan to perform in the near future and address the resolution effects more directly .",
