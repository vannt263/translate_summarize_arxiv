    "such operators arise naturally in non - equilibrium statistical mechanics as the generators of markov processes which model the dynamics of classical open systems  @xcite .",
    "a standard example of hypoelliptic equation is the fokker - planck equation  @xcite , @xmath0 this equation is the forward kolmogorov equation for the langevin stochastic differential equation @xmath1 where @xmath2 denotes a standard brownian motion in @xmath3 , @xmath4 the friction coefficient and @xmath5 the inverse temperature .",
    "several properties of the fokker - planck equation have been studied including spectral properties and convergence to equilibrium  @xcite , homogenization  @xcite , short time asymptotics  @xcite and semiclassical limits  @xcite .",
    "related problems have been studied for the fokker - planck equation corresponding to the generalized langevin equation under a markovian approximation  @xcite .",
    "recently , the theory of hypocoercivity  @xcite has been developed for studying the convergence to equilibrium of kinetic equations .",
    "this theory applies to evolution equations of the form @xmath6 where @xmath7 are some operators defined on an appropriate hilbert space @xmath8 , which is usually the @xmath9 space weighted by the invariant measure of the underlying markov process , with @xmath10 being skew - adjoint in this space , @xmath11 . under appropriate assumptions on the commutators between the operators @xmath7 and higher order commutators , it is possible to prove the exponential return to equilibrium for these evolution equations . regarding the fokker - planck operator , quantitative estimates on the rate of convergence",
    "can be obtained via the analysis of the spectral gap .",
    "however , it is not possible in general to determine exactly the spectrum and one of the few instances when this is possible is the case of quadratic potentials  @xcite .    in the present work ,",
    "we consider evolution equations associated with general quadratic operators @xmath12 and address the problem of the exponential return to equilibrium for these systems .",
    "quadratic operators are pseudodifferential operators defined in the weyl quantization @xmath13 by symbols @xmath14 , with @xmath15 and @xmath16 , which are complex - valued quadratic forms @xmath17 these operators are differential operators with simple and fully explicit expression .",
    "indeed , the weyl quantization of the quadratic symbol @xmath18 , with @xmath19 , @xmath20 , is the differential operator @xmath21 notice that quadratic operators are non - selfadjoint operators and that those with symbols having non - negative real parts are accretive . since the classical work by j.  sjstrand  @xcite , a complete description for the spectrum of elliptic quadratic operators is known and has played an important rle in the analysis of partial differential operators with double characteristics .",
    "elliptic quadratic operators are quadratic operators whose symbols satisfy the ellipticity condition @xmath22 in a recent work  @xcite , the spectral properties of non - elliptic quadratic operators , that is operators whose symbols may fail to satisfy the ellipticity condition on the whole phase space @xmath23 , were investigated .",
    "for any quadratic operator whose symbol has a real part with a sign , say here a symbol with non - negative real part @xmath24 it was pointed out the existence of a particular linear subvector space @xmath25 in the phase space @xmath23 , @xmath26 , intrinsically associated to the symbol @xmath27 and called singular space , which plays a basic rle in the understanding of the properties of this non - elliptic quadratic operator .",
    "in particular , this work  @xcite ( theorem  1.2.2 ) gives a complete description for the spectrum of any non - elliptic quadratic operator @xmath28 whose symbol @xmath27 has a non - negative real part , @xmath29 ; and satisfies an assumption of partial ellipticity along its singular space  @xmath25 , @xmath30 under those assumptions , the spectrum of the quadratic operator @xmath28 is showed to be composed of a countable number of eigenvalues with finite multiplicity and the structure of the spectrum is similar to the one known for elliptic quadratic operators  @xcite .",
    "this condition of partial ellipticity is weaker than the condition of ellipticity in general , @xmath31 , and allows to deal with more degenerate situations .",
    "an important class of quadratic operators satisfying condition ( [ sm2 ] ) are those with zero singular space @xmath32 . in this case , the condition of partial ellipticity trivially holds and these differential operators have been showed to be hypoelliptic @xcite ( theorem  1.2.1 ) .",
    "more precisely , they enjoy specific subelliptic properties with a loss of derivatives with respect to the elliptic case depending directly on the structure of their singular spaces .",
    "we refer the reader to  @xcite for a complete presentation of these subelliptic properties and examples of such subelliptic quadratic operators .    in the present work",

    "more specifically , we shall see that the first eigenvalue in the bottom of their spectra has always algebraic multiplicity one with an eigenspace spanned by a ground state of exponential type .",
    "we shall also give an explicit formula for the spectral gap which is computable via a simple algebraic calculation ; and finally answer the question of long time behavior of the associated evolution equations by proving the property of exponential return to equilibrium for these quadratic systems .",
    "let us finally mention that the singular space theory @xcite apply in various settings and that certain applications to the study of chains of oscillators and the generalized langevin equation are discussed at the end of this article .",

    "one can notice from ( [ 10 ] ) that a hamilton map is always skew - symmetric with respect to @xmath45 .",
