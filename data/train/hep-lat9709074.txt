    "( [ qchi1 ] ) .    in @xcite @xmath3 was evaluated at zero and finite temperature for @xmath1 yang - mills theory .",
    "the value obtained at zero temperature was in agreement with the prediction of eq .",

    "the value of @xmath3 at finite temperature displayed a sharp drop beyond the deconfinement transition .",
    "here we give a short review of a similar calculation for the @xmath0 gauge group @xcite .",
    "in addition we discuss the comparison with the geometric method , and we show that , after a proper renormalization of the latter , the two procedures give consistent results @xcite .",
    "let @xmath9 be any definition of the topological charge density on the lattice .",
    "the lattice topological susceptibility @xmath10 is defined as @xmath11 the lattice regulated @xmath9 is related to the continuum @xmath12 @xmath13 by a finite renormalization @xcite @xmath14 where @xmath15 in the usual notation .    since @xmath10 does not obey in general the prescription  @xcite leading to eq .",

    "( [ z ] ) there is also an additive renormalization @xmath16 where @xmath17 contains mixings with operators of dimension @xmath18 .    in order to extract the physical signal @xmath3 from eq .",
    "( [ m ] ) , we need a determination of the renormalization constants @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "we will determine them using the non  perturbative method of ref .",

    "the @xmath24-smeared field theoretical @xmath25 is defined as @xmath26 @xmath27 is the plaquette in the @xmath28 plane constructed with @xmath24-times smeared links @xmath29  @xcite .",
    "we call @xmath30 and @xmath31 the additive and multiplicative renormalization constants for the @xmath24-smeared operators .",

    "@xmath34 is shown in figure 1 by the stars : it is one order of magnitude bigger than the field theoretical determinations and no scaling is observed . by using the same method as for the field theoretical determination , we have measured the multiplicative renormalization @xmath36 , finding @xmath37 within errors . at the same time",

    "this correlator , for @xmath44 lying along a coordinate axis , is shown in figures 2 for the smeared charges and in figure 3 for the geometrical charge .",
    "the peak at @xmath43 for the geometric charge is @xmath45 orders of magnitude larger than for the @xmath24-smeared charges , indicating that @xmath38 is much bigger than @xmath46 , and is @xmath47 of the observed @xmath10 .",
    "the data show again a drop at the transition .",
