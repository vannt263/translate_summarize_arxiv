    "<S> we review the direct cp and t violation in the three - body baryonic @xmath0 decays in the standard model . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we emphasize that the direct cp violating asymmetry in @xmath1 is around 22@xmath2 and the direct @xmath3 violating asymmetry in @xmath4 can be as large as @xmath5 , which are accessible to the current b factories at kek and slac as well as superb and lhcb .    direct cp violation has been measured in both @xmath6 and @xmath7 systems @xcite , but it has not been observed and conclusive in @xmath8 and @xmath9 systems @xcite , respectively . on the other hand , t violation has been only seen in the @xmath6 process @xcite , related to the indirect cp violating parameter @xmath10 , whereas no t violating effect has been found in either @xmath8 or @xmath0 systems yet . in the standard model ( sm ) , it is clear that the unique phase of the cabbibo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) matrix @xcite is responsible for both observed cp and t violating effects . in this talk </S>",
    "<S> , we would like to explore the possibility to detect the direct cp and t violation in the @xmath0 systems in the current b - factories as well as the future ones such as superb and lhcb . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we concentrate on the three - body charmless baryonic processes . </S>",
    "<S> our goal of the talk is to test the ckm paradigm of cp violation and unfold new physics .    in the framework of local quantum field theories , </S>",
    "<S> t - violation implies cp - violation ( and vice versa ) , because of the cpt invariance of such theories . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , no violation of cpt symmetry has been found  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> still , it will be worthwhile to remember that outside this framework of local quantum field theories , there is no reason for the two symmetries to be linked  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , it would be interesting to directly investigate t violation in b decays , rather than inferring it as a consequence of cp - violation . </S>",
    "<S> the characteristic observables of the direct cp and t violation are rate asymmetries and momentum correlations , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> for example , in ( conjugate ) processes such as @xmath11 ( @xmath12 ) , the direct cp asymmetry arises if both the weak ( @xmath13 ) and strong ( @xmath14 ) phases are non - vanishing , given by a_cp&=&(b|*b*m)-(|b|m ) ( b|*b*m)+(|b|m ) , [ cpa ] whereas the direct t violation is related to the correlations known as triple product correlations ( tpc s ) , such as @xmath15 , given by _ </S>",
    "<S> t & = & 1 2(a_t-|a_t ) . where @xcite a_t = ( _ * b*(_*b*_m ) > 0 ) - ( _ * b*(_*b*_m ) < 0 ) ( _ * b*(_*b*_m ) > 0 ) + ( _ * b*(_*b*_m ) < 0 ) , [ atp ] and @xmath16 is the corresponding asymmetry of the conjugate process . it is interesting to note that to have a non - zero value of @xmath17 , both weak and strong phases are needed , whereas in the vanishing limit of the strong phase , @xmath18 is maximal . furthermore , there is no contribution @xcite to @xmath18 from final state interaction due to electromagnetic interaction </S>",

    "<S> we note that for the decay amplitudes in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq1 ] ) we have neglected the small contributions @xcite from @xmath39 involving the @xmath40 time - like baryonic form factors  @xcite , where @xmath41 can be ( axial-)vector or ( pseudo)scalar currents . however , in our numerical analysis we will keep all amplitudes including the ones neglected in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq1 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> numerically , the ckm parameters are taken to be @xcite @xmath42 and @xmath43 with @xmath44 , @xmath45 , the values of @xmath46 are @xmath47  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we remark that @xmath34 contain both weak and strong phases , induced by @xmath48 and quark - loop rescatterings . </S>",
    "<S> explicitly , at the scale @xmath49 and @xmath38=3 , we obtain a set of @xmath50 , @xmath51 , and @xmath52 as follows : @xmath53\\times 10^{-4 } \\;,\\nonumber\\\\ a_6&=&\\big[(-595.5\\mp 9.1\\eta-3.9\\rho)+i(-83.2\\pm 3.9\\eta-9.1\\rho)\\big]\\times 10^{-4}\\;,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for the @xmath54 ( @xmath55 ) transition .    from eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq1 ] ) , we derive the simple results for the direct cp asymmetries of the @xmath56 modes as follows : @xmath57 where @xmath58 denote the values of the corresponding antiparticles . </S>",
    "<S> it is easy to see that @xmath59 are independent of the phase spaces as well as the hadronic matrix elements . as a result , </S>",
    "<S> the hadron parts along with their uncertainties in @xmath59 are divided out in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ acp2 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> we note that the cp asymmetries in eq . </S>",

    "<S> , we have included the current experimental data as well as the decay modes of @xmath61 . </S>",
    "<S> we note that the possible fluctuations induced from non - factorizable effects , time - like baryonic form factors and ckm matrix elements for @xmath59 are about @xmath62 ( 0.04 ) , 0.003 ( 0.01 ) and 0.01 ( 0.01 ) , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the uncertainties from time - like baryonic form factors are constrained by the data of @xmath63 and @xmath64 @xcite and the errors on the ckm elements are from @xmath65 and @xmath48 given in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it is interesting to point out that the large value of @xmath66=22% is in agreement with the babar data of @xmath67 . </S>",
    "<S> however , taken at face value ; the sign of our prediction @xmath68 is different from those by babar @xcite and belle @xcite collaborations . </S>",
    "<S> since the uncertainties of both experiments are still large it is too early to make a firm conclusion .    for the direct t violation in the three - body charmless baryonic </S>",
    "<S> b decays @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we concentrate on @xmath4 by looking for the tpc of the type @xmath69 . </S>",
    "<S> it is interesting to note that  @xcite : [ exbr ] br ( b^0 | p^- ) = ( 3.290.47 ) 10 ^ -6 br(b^- |p ) & < & 4.6 10 ^ -7 . </S>",
    "<S> the enhancement of three - body decay over the two - body one is due to the reduced energy release in @xmath0 to @xmath70 transition by the fastly recoiling @xmath70 meson that favors the dibaryon production @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> theoretical estimations baryonic b decays are made @xcite , in consistent with the experimental observations .    in the factorization method , </S>",
    "<S> the decay amplitude of @xmath71 contains the @xmath72 transition and @xmath73 baryon - pair inducing from the vacuum . </S>",
    "<S> the contributions to the decay at the quark level are mainly from @xmath74 , @xmath75 and @xmath76 operators . from these operators and the factorization approximation , the decay amplitude is given by @xcite @xmath77 where @xmath78 , @xmath79 and @xmath34 are defined in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ a146 ] ) . from eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ m6 ] ) , the t - odd transverse polarization asymmetry @xmath80 is found to be @xmath81 where @xmath82 and @xmath83 are combinations of form factors , given by  @xcite @xmath84\\;,\\   % \\nonumber\\\\ a\\;=\\;f^{b \\to \\pi}_1(t)g_a(t)\\;,\\nonumber\\\\ s&=&\\frac{m_b^2-m_\\pi^2}{m_b - m_u}f^{b \\to \\pi}_0(t)f_s(t)\\;,\\ % \\nonumber\\\\ p\\;=\\;\\frac{m_b^2-m_\\pi^2}{m_b - m_u}f^{b \\to \\pi}_0(t)g_p(t)\\;.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] it is noted that the @xmath85 ( @xmath86 ) term is from vector - scalar ( axialvector - pseudoscalar ) interference and there is no t - odd term from @xmath87 due to the same current structures . in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ abfg ] ) , @xmath88 are the well known mesonic @xmath89 transition form factors @xcite , while @xmath90 , @xmath91 , @xmath92 , @xmath93 and @xmath94 are the @xmath95 time - like baryonic form factors , defined in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . based on the qcd counting rules @xcite and </S>",
    "<S> @xmath96 flavor symmetry , at @xmath97 one has that f_1(t)+ f_2(t)~g_a(t)~h_a(t)~f_s(t)~g_p(t)~ct^2 . in this limit @xmath98 and thus no t violation </S>",
    "<S> is expected . however , at the finite @xmath99 there are some high power terms of the @xmath99 expansion . </S>",
    "<S> a simple scenario of the power expansions for the baryonic form factors is as follows:@xcite [ ss ] f_1(t)+ f_2(t)=(ct^2+dt^3)^- , & & g_a(t)=(ct^2)^- , + f_s(t)=n_q(ct^2+dt^3)^- , & & g_p(t)=n_q(ct^2)^- ,  where @xmath100 , @xmath101 and @xmath102 and @xmath103 and @xmath104 are two new form factors .    </S>",
    "<S> we now evaluate the numerical values for the tpcs in this simple power expansion scenario in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ ss ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> our results of @xmath105 ( @xmath106 ) and @xmath107 are shown in table [ attable1 ] .    </S>",
    "<S> [ attable1 ]    as an illustration , in the table we have also turned off the strong phase ( @xmath108 ) by taking the imaginary parts of the quark - loop rescattering effects to be zero . from the table , we see explicitly that @xmath18 is indeed nonzero and maximal in the absence of the strong phase . </S>",
    "<S> we note that in our calculations we have neglected the final state interactions due to electromagnetic and strong interactions , which are believed to be small in three - body charmless baryonic decays @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we also note that @xmath109 in @xmath110 can be induced but it is too small to be measured . </S>",
    "<S> it is interesting to point out that in order to observe @xmath105 ( @xmath16 ) in @xmath111 ( @xmath112 ) being at @xmath113% , we need to have about @xmath114 @xmath115 pairs at @xmath116 level . </S>",
    "<S> this is within the reach of the present day @xmath0 factories at kek and slac and others that would come up . </S>",
    "<S> it is clear that an experimental measurement of @xmath18 is a reliable test of the ckm mechanism of cp violation and , moreover , it could be the first evidence of the direct t violation in b decays . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we remark that we have also explored the direct cp and t violation in @xmath117 @xcite and we have found that the direct cp violating effect is small but the t violating one is as large as that in @xmath118 .    in summary , we have shown that the direct cp violating asymmetry in @xmath1 is around 22@xmath2 and the direct @xmath3 violating asymmetry in @xmath4 can be as large as @xmath5 , which are accessible to the current b factories at kek and slac as well as the future ones such as superb and lhcb . </S>"
