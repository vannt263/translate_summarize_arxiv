    "three of these planets were known from radial - velocity surveys of the solar neighborhood , and were subsequently observed to transit .",

    "our collaboration is conducting the  ( tres ) : tres1 was the first nearby transiting planet to be discovered photometrically @xcite .",
    "such photometric surveys yield numerous transit candidates , of which the majority are astrophysical false positives that are discarded by follow - up photometric and spectroscopic observations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "however , eliminating a blend , wherein a bright star forms a chance superposition or a hierarchical triple with a faint eclipsing binary , can require a careful analysis @xcite .",
    "we present here the discovery of the planet , and describe the process by which we confirmed its planetary nature and deduced its bulk properties .",
    "transits of the parent star  were first observed by ( palomar observatory , california ) and psst ( lowell observatory , arizona ; @xcite ) , part of the network of 10cm telescopes .",
    "the third telescope @xcite in tenerife , spain , did not observe because it was undergoing an upgrade at the time .",
    "the two telescopes monitored a @xmath9 field of view ( fov ) centered on the star from ut 2005 june 16 to september 3 .",
    "the analysis of tres images has been described in detail in @xcite and @xcite . in summary",
    ", we analyzed the sleuth and psst images separately .",
    "after calibration , we obtained a list of the field stars in each image , and determined their equatorial coordinates .",
    "we applied our image spatial interpolation and subtraction routines based in part upon @xcite to obtain the differential magnitude of each star in each image .",
    "we decorrelated and binned the stellar light curves , before applying the transit - search algorithm of @xcite to identify stars showing statistically - significant , periodic transit - like events .",
    "we quickly selected  as a prime candidate .",
    "the sleuth @xmath5 and psst @xmath6 photometric time series obtained near - transit and folded with a period @xmath10d are shown in figure  [ fig : treslc ] .",
    "five full transits and three partial transits were observed by sleuth .",
    "psst observed two full transits and one partial event , events that were also observed by sleuth .",
    "we were therefore confident that the events were not the result of instrumental error .",
    "the depth of 1.4% was consistent with the transit of a jupiter - sized object across a solar - type star , and the duration of only 1.5h implied a near - grazing eclipse .",
    "we searched for the counterpart of  in publicly - available catalogs , and identified the star as .",
    "the 2mass @xmath11 is consistent with a sun - like star .",
    "the ucac2 proper motion ( @xmath12 ) is also consistent with , but slightly less than , the expectation for a nearby dwarf .",

    ", we observed it in johnson @xmath14 and cousins @xmath6 on the nights of ut 2006 august 29 and 30 with the 105cm hall telescope at lowell observatory .",
    "we calibrated the data using six standard fields @xcite , and the results are given in table  [ tab : tres2 ] .",
    "we observed  using the cfa digital speedometers @xcite on ut 2005 october 18 , 20 , 23 , november 13 and 2006 june 13 .",
    "these spectra are centered on 5187 , and cover 45  with a resolving power of @xmath15 . by cross - correlating these spectra with synthetic spectra created by j.  morse using kurucz model stellar atmospheres ( j.  morse & r.  l.  kurucz , 2004 , private communication ) , we computed the radial velocity ( rv ) at each epoch . within the measurement error ( @xmath16 ) , the rvs are constant with a mean velocity of @xmath17 and a scatter of @xmath18 .",
    "this limits the mass of the companion to be less than 8@xmath19 . from a similar cross - correlation analysis ,",
    "we estimate ( assuming a solar metallicity ) the stellar effective temperature @xmath20 , surface gravity @xmath21 , and the projected rotational velocity @xmath22 ( table  [ tab : tres2 ] ) .",
    "these estimates are consistent with the g0v spectral type implied by the photometry .",
    "we gathered rapid - cadence , high - precision photometric observations in @xmath7 and @xmath4 on ut 2006 august 10 with the ccd camera at the iac80 , an 80cm telescope of the observatorio del teide , tenerife , spain .",
    "the ccd camera has a fov of @xmath23 , corresponding to @xmath24  pixel@xmath25 .",
    "after calibrating the images , we carried out aperture photometry with vaphot @xcite on the target and several reference stars of similar brightness in the fov .",
    "we constructed an ensemble average of the calibrators , divided the target by the resulting time series , and renormalized the resulting light curve by the median of its value prior to the transit event .",
    "simultaneous @xmath6 observations were gathered with the telast 0.35m telescope , also located at the teide observatory , and were analyzed in a similar fashion .",
    "this telescope is able to follow the target to larger airmass permitting greater time coverage , but the resulting light curve showed a residual trend that was likely due to an imperfect extinction correction . to correct for this",
    ", we fit a cubic polynomial in time to the out - of - transit data , extended the fit across the complete dataset , and divided the data by this function . for each dataset , we estimated the measurement errors from the rms variation of the data preceding first contact .",
    "the light curves are presented in figure  [ fig : treslc ] .    in order to confirm the planetary nature of the companion and measure its mass",
    ", we carried out rv observations using keck / hires @xcite with its @xmath26 absorption cell @xcite .",
    "eleven star+iodine spectra and one template spectrum were collected ut 2006 august 24 , permitting good sampling of critical orbital phases .",
    "we reduced the data using the makee package written by t. barlow .",

    "our analysis procedure to derive relative rvs incorporates the full modeling of temporal and spatial variations of the hires instrumental profile ( @xcite , see also @xcite ) .",
    "we model each echelle order containing @xmath26 lines independently , and then calculate the internal uncertainties for this star ) for each observation as the rv scatter about the mean divided by the square root of the number of spectral orders . the rv precision achieved by our code",
    "is described in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the rv measurements are listed in table  [ tab : rvtres2 ] .",
    "the best - fit orbital solution , constrained to have zero eccentricity ( as expected from theoretical arguments for a short - period planet ) , and with the @xmath29 and transit epoch @xmath30 determined from the photometric data , yields a velocity semi - amplitude @xmath31 and an instrumental @xmath32-velocity of @xmath33 .",
    "the fit has a @xmath34 ( @xmath35 ) and the rms of the residuals is @xmath36 , in excellent agreement with the internal errors .",
    "figure  [ fig : rvtres2 ] shows the rv data overplotted with the best - fit model , as well as the residuals to the fit .",
    "the parameters of the orbital solution are listed in table  [ tab : tres2b ] .",
    "we find a minimum mass for the planet of @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is the orbital inclination and @xmath39 is the stellar mass . in ",
    "3 we estimate these two quantities to obtain @xmath40 . as a further check on the consistency between the photometric and rv datasets , we fix @xmath29 , set @xmath41 , and solve for @xmath42 ( as well as @xmath43 and @xmath32 ) .",
    "we find @xmath44 , which is consistent with , but less precisely determined than the value predicted from the photometry ( table  [ tab : tres2b ] ) .",
    "to investigate the possibility that the rv variations are due not to a planetary companion but rather to distortions in the spectral line profiles arising from contamination of the spectrum by an unresolved eclipsing binary @xcite , we examined the line bisectors carefully for signs of time - varying asymmetries .",
    "we cross - correlated each of our keck spectra against a synthetic spectrum matching the measured properties of the star .",
    "line bisectors were then computed from the cross - correlation function averaged over spectral orders not affected by the iodine lines , which is representative of the average spectral line profile .",
    "bisector spans were calculated as the velocity difference between points selected near the top and bottom of the bisectors @xcite .",
    "if the velocity variations were the result of a stellar blend , we would expect the bisector spans to vary in phase with the photometric period with an amplitude similar to that seen in the rvs @xcite .",
    "instead , we did not detect any variation exceeding the measurement uncertainties .    as an additional check we carried out detailed modeling of the tres photometry following @xcite to test the hypothesis that the light curve is the result of blending of the main g0 star with an unseen eclipsing binary .",
    "the properties of the three stars ( parameterized in terms of their mass ) were taken from model isochrones subject to the @xmath20 and @xmath21 constraints on the main star .",
    "an excellent fit to the tres @xmath5band light curve was obtained for a triple system composed of a g  dwarf primary blended with an eclipsing binary with individual components of spectral type m0 and m4m5 . in this model ,",
    "the flux ratio between the g  dwarf primary and the brightest ( m0 ) component of the blended binary is less than 2% , which would be undetectable in our spectra .",
    "however , the color difference between the g0 and m0 stars is such that we would expect the @xmath4 data to present an eclipse depth half of that in the tres bandpass , in contrast to what is observed ( figure  [ fig : treslc ] ) .",
    "( although we note in  [ sec : discuss ] that a modest color - dependent extinction error may be present in the @xmath4 data , it is both the opposite sign and of too small an amplitude to permit the blend decribed here . ) more generally , any blend scenario is strongly disfavored by the observed rv orbit and corresponding lack of bisector variability .",
    "we conclude from these tests that a blend scenario is strongly inconsistent with the data , and therefore that the star is indeed orbited by a jovian planet .",
    "in order to determine @xmath39 and its uncertainties , we compared our estimates of @xmath20 and @xmath21 with evolutionary models from @xcite , assuming solar metallicity . for each isochrone , we identified the range of @xmath39 for which the @xmath20 and @xmath21 lay within our 1@xmath45 errors .",
    "we took the best - fit model as our estimate of @xmath39 , and the span of permitted models ( over all ages greater than 500  myr ) to be our uncertainty .",
    "we then used the resulting value , @xmath46 , and the spectroscopic orbit (  2 ) to estimate @xmath47 .",
    "we also evaluated the stellar radius @xmath48 in a similar fashion , and found results that were consistent with , but less tightly constrained than that from the light - curve modeling ( below ) .",
    "the uncertainty contributed by that in the evolutionary models is less than 0.02 solar masses .",
    "based on the absolute visual magnitude ( @xmath49=4.5 ) predicted by the best - fit model , we estimate the distance to be approximately 230pc .",
    "we estimate the reddening in the direction of  to be @xmath50 and the extinction to be @xmath51mag from comparison of its observed colors with the intrinsic colors predicted by the model .    to estimate @xmath48 , @xmath38 , and the planetary radius @xmath52 , we simultaneously fit our light curves using the analytical transit curves of @xcite and the color - dependent quadratic limb - darkening parameters from @xcite , which were matched to the spectroscopically - estimated properties of the star .",
    "we identified the best - fit solution by fixing the value of @xmath39 at its best estimate , @xmath53 , and minimizing the @xmath54 to all the photometry .",
    "we note that the available time series are well - described by the model , with the exception of the iac80 @xmath4 , for which the in - transit data fall below the model .",
    "we speculate that those data , which were gathered at high airmass , may have been imperfectly corrected for extinction , which is a larger effect at @xmath4 than the other band passes .",
    "the best - fit solution obtains @xmath55 ( @xmath56 ) , and its values for @xmath57 are listed in tables  [ tab : tres2 ] and [ tab : tres2b ] .",
    "the uncertainties in these quantities are dominated by our uncertainty in @xmath39 .",
    "to derive 1@xmath45 errors for each of @xmath58 , we change the value of that parameter and fix it at a new value , and then allow the other two parameters to float , as well as allow for a value of @xmath39 within our uncertainty .",
    "( the uncertainties in @xmath29 and @xmath30 are sufficiently small so as not to contribute significantly to the errors in @xmath48 , @xmath52 , and @xmath38 . )",
    "we repeat this procedure until the best - fit solution produces an increase in the @xmath54 corresponding to a 1@xmath45 change .",
    "our estimate of the planetary radius , @xmath59 , implies a mean density of @xmath60 , indistinguishable from that of tres-1 ( using the values from * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , despite the fact that  is nearly twice as massive .",
    "we also note that the impact parameter , @xmath61 , is the largest of any known transiting exoplanet .",
    "we intend to improve our estimates of the planetary and stellar parameters by undertaking a more detailed analysis of the stellar spectrum as we did for tres1 @xcite , and by gathering very high - precision @xmath62-band photometry ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "such data will permit us to look for transit timing variations indicative of additional planets in the  system @xcite .",

    "_ will observe nearly 600 transits of .",
    "the precision with which _ kepler _ will observe these transits will enable an extremely sensitive search for additional planets in the system through their dynamical perturbations .",
    "moreover , the large impact parameter means that very subtle changes in its value could be detected .",
    "such variations are predicted @xcite to occur as a result of either additional planets , or the stellar quadrupole moment .",
    "_ kepler _ may also detect the reflected light from  @xcite and hence determine the long - sought geometric albedo and phase function of a hot jupiter .",
    "the large impact parameter also makes  particularly favorable for determining the angle between the stellar spin - axis and the orbital axis via the rossiter ",

    "@xcite discuss the use of _ spitzer _ irac observations spanning the time of secondary eclipse to resolve the surfaces of extrasolar planets .",
    "the large impact parameter of the  orbit is ideal for this application , since it grants access to both longitudinal and latitudinal flux variations across the dayside hemisphere of the planet .",
