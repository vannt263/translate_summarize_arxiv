    "the schwarzian derivative @xmath0 of an analytic locally univalent function plays an important role for finding sufficient conditions for univalence .",
    "z. nehari @xcite found conditions implying univalence expressed in terms of the schwarzian derivative : if @xmath1 , then @xmath2 is univalent in the unit disc @xmath3 . also if @xmath4 , the same conclusion follows .",
    "for deriving his outstanding results nehari used a useful connection between the zeros of solutions of linear second order differential equations and univalence @xcite .",
    "later pokornyi @xcite stated without proof the condition @xmath5 .",
    "nehari then proved this condition @xcite .",
    "in addition nehari extended these results and proved a more general theorem @xcite , @xcite concerning criteria for univalence . in his theorem",
    "he also investigated the sharpness of his conditions .",
    "this pioneering works of nehari opened a new line of research in geometric function theory .",
    "one very significant development is due to ahlfors and weill @xcite , see also @xcite . in this paper",
    "the authors considered not only univalence criteria but in addition they were intersted in quasiconformal extension to the full complex plane c. in another direction connection with harmonic mappings and minimal surfaces was made by chuaqui , osgood and others @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .    in the present paper",
    "we confine ourselves to finding new sufficient conditions for univalence by extending some of previous ideas .",
    "in addition we deepen the discussion of sharpness . in this connection",
    "we mention our paper @xcite which deals with singular sturm comparison theorem .    as an example",
    "we show that our results lead to an improvement of the evaluation of the radius of univalence of the  error function \" .",
    "nehari s pioneering work appeared in @xcite .",
    "this work opened a fundamental line of research .",
    "his idea was to use a connection between the number of zeros of solutions of second order linear differential equations in a given domain in the complex plane and univalence of the quotient of two independent solution of this equation : if @xmath6 are two linearly independent solutions of a linear , homogeneous second order differential equation in a domain @xmath7 and every linear combination @xmath8 has at most one zero in @xmath7 , then their quotient @xmath9 is univalent in @xmath7 .",
    "the well known schwarzian derivative operator appeared naturally in his line of reasoning and nehari made use of the properties of this operator to arrive at his sufficient conditions for univalence .",
    "we now recall some of the basic properties of the schwarzian derivative ( @xmath10 by our notation ) : @xmath11 some other commonly used notations are @xmath12 .",
    "one basic property of the @xmath13 is : given a mbius map @xmath14 , @xmath15 , we have @xmath16 . another useful property is for a composition of two functions @xmath17 : @xmath18if the above @xmath2 is in particular a mbius map @xmath19 then by @xmath20 , @xmath21    suppose we are given the linear differential equation @xmath22 where @xmath23 is an analytic function in the unit disc @xmath24 .",
    "in addition , we shall need frequently the real valued differential equation @xmath25 where @xmath26 is a continuous function in the interval @xmath27 .",
    "let @xmath6 be any two linearly independent solutions of ( [ eq : diffequ ] ) .",
    "then it is a useful fact that @xmath28 nehari combined the above properties to arrive at his remarkable result    * theorem a * ( nehari , @xcite ) _ suppose that + ( i )  @xmath26 is a positive and continuous even function for @xmath27 , + ( ii )  @xmath29 is nonincreasing for @xmath30 , + ( iii )  the differential equation @xmath31 has a solution which does not vanish in @xmath27 . + then any analytic function @xmath32 in @xmath24 satisfying @xmath33 is univalent in the unit disc @xmath24 . _    in what follows we use the term ",
    "nehari s function \" to denote a positive even function @xmath26 such that @xmath34 is nonincreasing for @xmath30 .",
    "see @xcite .    as nehari pointed out already in @xcite , the functions @xmath35 and the corresponding solutions @xmath36 of the respective equations ( [ eq : real - diffequ ] ) have all the needed properties to conclude the sufficient conditions for univalence in @xmath24 .",
    "soon after that , e. hille @xcite made the remarkable observation that the condition @xmath37 is sharp .",
    "in fact he showed more than that .",
    "namely , if @xmath38 then for two solutions @xmath39 of the equation @xmath40 , the quotient @xmath41 satisfies @xmath42 but takes on the value 1 infinitely often in @xmath24 . on the other hand , if @xmath43 the quotients of solutions of the corresponding differential equation @xmath44 are finitely valent in @xmath24 .",
    "thus there is a clear difference between the two cases ( [ eq : hille ] ) and ( [ eq : pi^2 ] ) .",
    "in what follows we will pay attention to the question of sharpness and in particular we will investigate when the counterexamples are finitely or infinitely valent",
    ".    * definition . *",
    "_   we shall say that analytic function @xmath23 is  self majorant \" in the unit disc @xmath24 if @xmath45 _ if all coefficients in the expansion of @xmath23 around zero are positive , @xmath23 is automatically self majorant but the opposite is not true in general , as it follows by elementary examples .",
    "the three first sufficient conditions implying univalence , namely @xmath46 correspond , to differential equations of type ( [ eq : real - diffequ ] ) where the respectively involved functions @xmath47 are all self majorant since the coefficients in their power series expansion are all positive .",
    "this is not the case for nehari s more general conditions @xcite for univalence in @xmath24 , @xmath48 which correspond to the solutions @xmath49 and @xmath50 of the respective equations ( [ eq : real - diffequ ] ) .    in case",
    "the analytic function @xmath23 is self majorant , we have an additional significant information about the analytic differential equation ( [ eq : diffequ ] ) : if @xmath26 satisfies the assumptions of theorem a and , in addition , @xmath23 is self majorant , then for two linearly independent solutions @xmath6 of solutions of ( [ eq : diffequ ] ) , the function @xmath51 satisfies @xmath52 hence @xmath53 is itself univalent . if , for a given solution @xmath54 of ( [ eq : diffequ ] ) we choose the independent solution @xmath55 then the quotient @xmath56 is itself univalent .",
    "hence in such a case univalent functions are naturally generated by the solutions of the differential equation ( [ eq : diffequ ] ) .    in the spirit of n. steinmetz @xcite , we define :    * definition . *",
    "_   we shall say that the univalence criterion ( [ eq : sf < p ] ) is sharp if @xmath57 for @xmath27 and @xmath58 imply that @xmath32 is not univalent in @xmath24 .",
    "_    steinmetz proved the following result :    * theorem b * ( n. steinmetz , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 3 ) ) _ if @xmath23 is self majorant and @xmath59 for a positive solution @xmath60 of ( [ eq : real - diffequ ] ) , then the univalence criterion ( [ eq : sf < p ] ) is sharp .",
    "conversely , if @xmath61 , then the univalence criterion ( [ eq : sf < p ] ) is never sharp .",
    "_    in a recent work @xcite the authors of the present paper proved a singular form of the classical sturm comparison theorem for equations of the form @xmath62 .",
    "we have shown there that if @xmath26 is continuous in @xmath63 but not necessarily bounded at the endpoints @xmath64 , then @xmath65 ensure the validity of the sturm comparison theorem .",
    "the assumptions ( [ eq : principal ] ) are closely related to that of @xcite , which has to be satisfied in order to ensure the sharpness of the univalence condition .",
    "one may ask why should not the definition of sharpness assume the inequality @xmath66 ?",
    "the following counter example explains our choice : the differential equation @xmath67 has the solutions @xmath68 , and the quotient of its solutions @xmath69 is koebe s univalent function",
    ". however , let @xmath70 and the quotient of solutions of hille s equation ( [ eq : hille ] ) with @xmath71 is infinitely many valent .",
    "we close this section with an example where @xmath23 is not self majorant and the criterion ( [ eq : sf < p ] ) is not sharp .",

    "( this is a particular case of ( [ eq : nehari - mu-2 ] ) with @xmath74 ) . analyzing more carefully this condition we see that the condition ( [ eq : nehari - mu-3 ] ) is not sharp .",
    "indeed , @xmath75 is an analytic function in the unit disc and because of the maximum principle , @xmath76 can not be achieved at any internal point of the unit disc .",
    "consequently , it follows from ( [ eq : nehari - mu-3 ] ) that @xmath77 . but this condition is not sharp , as we have the better sufficient condition @xmath78 .",
    "note that the function @xmath79 is not self majorant .",

    "however , for the function @xmath84 , assumption ( [ eq : sf < p ] ) , i.e. , @xmath85 is false for nonreal values of @xmath86 in the unit disc and theorem a is not applicable .",
    "nevertheless this @xmath32 is univalent in the unit disc .",
    "nehari s more general conditions ( [ eq : nehari - mu-1 ] ) , ( [ eq : nehari - mu-2 ] ) for univalence @xmath87 may be viewed as families of conditions depending on one parameter .",

    "hence , once again we deduce that there is only one possibility , namely , @xmath529 .",

    "in fact , this is a somewhat surprising conclusion as it is not included in the statement of theorem 2 .",

    "it is easy to see that @xmath211 contradicts @xmath527 and thus can not occur with our assumption .",
    "indeed , this follows at once from @xmath532 , @xmath533 .",
    "see ( [ eq : example2-condition ] ) . on the other hand a priori it is possible to have both @xmath243 and @xmath527 without contradicting ( [ eq : example2-condition ] ) nevertheless the above analysis shows that the `` uniqueness argument '' implies @xmath529 , i.e. , @xmath534 .",

    "this means that @xmath536 is not monotone in the interval ( 0,1 ) .",
    "indeed , monotonicity for @xmath537 would supply a function @xmath538 @xmath539 , contradicting the uniqueness argument ."
