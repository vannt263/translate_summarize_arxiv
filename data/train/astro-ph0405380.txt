    "the crab pulsar , the product of a core - collapse supernova in 1054 ce , broadcasts its presence through a surrounding pulsar wind nebula ( pwn ) that is one of the most luminous radio and x - ray sources in the galaxy . its probable medieval sibling , thought to have been born in the supernova of 1181 ce , is more modest .",
    "its radio pwn , 3c58 , is less luminous than the crab by an order of magnitude , and its x - ray nebula is 2000 times weaker . in part , these differences are due to the birth properties of the two pulsars : the crab s initial spin period of @xmath1  msec means that nearly @xmath2  ergs has been dumped into its pwn in the last 950 yrs ; it maintains a current spindown power of @xmath3 erg s@xmath4 .",
    "in contrast , psr j0205 + 6449 in 3c58 requires a birth period of @xmath5  ms to explain its current period of 65  ms ( murray et al . 2002 ) , and provides only @xmath6  erg s@xmath4 to its pwn today  a factor of nearly 20 smaller than the crab , albeit the second highest spin - down power known for a pulsar in the galaxy .",
    "differences in the energetics of the powering neutron stars may well not be the only characteristic that distinguishes 3c58 from the crab nebula .",
    "despite apparently being younger , 3c58 is considerably larger and yet exhibits lower expansion velocities among its optical filaments .",
    "optical observations ( fesen 1983 ) reveal knots and filaments which show velocities @xmath7 to @xmath8 , and radio expansion measurements ( bietenholz , kassim , & weiler 2001 ) yield a similar result .",
    "thus , the current expansion rate is considerably less than the undecelerated velocity @xmath9 required to yield the current size of 3c  58 if the age is only 820 yr .",
    "this has led some authors to suggest that 3c58 is not the remnant of sn1181 .",
    "however , a recent review of chinese and japanese manuscripts ( stephensen & green 2002 ) lends strong support to the association ; of the known snrs within a @xmath10 region that best corresponds to the supernova position inferred from these early records , only 3c  58 has properties consistent with a very young object .",
    "the presence of the second most energetic pulsar known further reinforces the connection .",

    "the pulsar is at the center , and is surrounded by a elongated compact nebula with a curved jet extending to the west .",
    "complex filamentary loops fill the interior region , and a softening of the spectrum with radius is evidenced by the red outer regions  an effect resulting from both synchrotron aging of the electrons and the presence of a soft thermal shell .",
    "x - rays were first detected from 3c58 by the einstein observatory ( becker , helfand , and szymkowiak 1982 ) .",
    "these observations showed the centrally peaked brightness distribution and power law spectrum expected from a crab - like remnant , confirming the classification of this source by wilson and weiler ( 1976 ) .",
    "the surface brightness profile of the nebula suggested the presence of a central point source , but it was twenty years before the pulsar was finally discovered at x - ray ( murray et al .",
    "2002 ) and radio ( camilo et al . 2002 ) wavelengths .",
    "rosat , asca , xmm , and chandra observations of 3c58 added further details to our picture of the pwn , resolving the central enhancement ( helfand , becker and white 1995 ) , measuring the steepening of the x - ray spectrum with increasing radius ( torii et al . 2000 ) , finding evidence for a shell of thermal emission ( bocchino et al .",
    "2001 ) , and setting a limit on the neutron star temperature ( slane , helfand and murray 2002 ) .",
    "the rich detail hinted at by the image obtained in the latter publication inspired us to propose a very deep observation of the nebula .",
    "the result of that observation is presented here .    in section 2",
    ", we describe the observations , while section 3 includes details of our spatial and spectral analysis .",
    "we then go on to discuss the large - scale structure of the nebula ( @xmath11 ) , the geometry of the inner nebula ( @xmath12 ) , improved limits on the neutron star temperature ( @xmath13 ) , the jet - like extension emanating from the pulsar ( @xmath14 ) , the remarkable filamentary loop structures revealed in the image ( @xmath15 ) , and the thermal shell emission ( @xmath16 ) .",

    "the circular filamentary region in the south is also observed in the x - ray and radio images .",
    "3c  58 was observed for 350  ks with the acis detector onboard the _ chandra_observatory between 22 - 26 april 2003 .",
    "the aimpoint was placed on the s3 chip of the detector , and a 1/2-subarray mode was selected in order to minimize pileup from the compact central source while still imaging most of the pwn .",
    "the observation was divided into three segments ( obsids 4383 , 4382 , and 3832 in time order ) to accommodate interruptions by the radiation zones in the _ chandra _  orbit .",
    "an error in on - board commanding resulted in the final segment being carried out with the spacecraft dither turned off for the full 170  ks duration , resulting in no exposure in regions corresponding to gaps between the ccd chips or to bad column regions in the ccds for this segment .",
    "standard cleaning of the data to remove episodes of high background , which affected @xmath18 of the middle segment , resulted in a final exposure of 317  ks .",
    "the x - ray image , shown in figure 1 and described in detail below , reveals a complex structure consisting of loops , elongated features , and broad diffuse emission .",
    "the exposure - corrected x - ray image of 3c  58 is shown in figure 1 .",
    "here we have blocked the raw image by a factor of two , smoothed with a 1-bin ( 0.5  arcsec ) gaussian , and divided by the exposure map .",
    "the upper and lower edges of the image are set by the boundaries of the subarray readout .",
    "faint vertical lines in the image are small artifacts related to the lack of dither in one observation segment , as described above . to produce the `` x - ray color '' image shown , color planes were created for three energy bands : 0.51.0  kev ( red ) , 1.01.5  kev ( green ) and 1.512  kev ( blue ) .",
    "as we discuss below , the color image reveals distinct energy - related structure , including an outer shell of soft emission .",
    "the central region of 3c  58 is dominated by emission from the pulsar psr  j0205 + 6449  ( murray et al .",
    "2002 ) which produces an extended structure , with elongation in the n - s direction , perpendicular to the long axis of the main nebula .",
    "slane , helfand , & murray ( 2002 ) interpret this emission as a tilted ring - like equatorial structure associated with the pulsar wind termination shock , where the fast - moving pulsar wind merges with the much slower expansion of the nebula itself .",
    "they also noted the presence of a jet - like feature protruding @xmath19  arcseconds to the west , perpendicular to the inferred equatorial axis .",
    "this feature is particularly evident in figure 1 , and presumably corresponds to the rotation axis of the pulsar .",
    "a striking feature of the x - ray morphology is the presence of numerous loop - like structures with radii of @xmath20  arcsec .",
    "the size - scale of these remarkable features , and their geometric distribution , are presumably signatures of a complex and tangled nebular magnetic field structure in the nebula .",
    "we discuss their physical characteristics in more detail in section 4 .    as illustrated in figure 2 ,",
    "the radio morphology of 3c  58 is quite similar to that observed in x - rays . while not immediately evident in the radio image , a comparison with the _ chandra _  image reveals radio structures that coincide with each of the x - ray loops .",
    "moreover , the overall extent of the nebula is nearly the same in the two spectral bands , as is the structure of several other large - scale features such as the large loop in the eastern portion of the nebula .",
    "the nearly identical morphology is in complete contrast to the crab nebula , for example , in which the x - ray emission is confined to a much smaller region due to the short synchrotron lifetime of the high energy electrons . for 3c  58 ,",
    "the x - ray emitting particles persist nearly all the way to the edge of the radio nebula ( figure 3 ) , indicating that synchrotron losses are not significant up to very high electron energies .",
    "x - ray spectra were extracted from various regions of 3c  58 , with corresponding background spectra taken from a region of the ccd beyond the boundary of the nebula .",
    "prior to extraction , a time - dependent gain correction was applied to the data using the tgain_corr software developed by a. vikhlinin .",
    "weighted spectral response and effective area tables for the extended emission regions were generated with the acisspec routine in ciao 3.0.2 .",
    "the reduced effective area at low energies caused by contaminants that have condensed on the acis filter has been accounted for in the effective area tables .",
    "the emission from 3c  58 is dominated by a power law component , typical of synchrotron emission . however , as described below , a faint thermal component is clearly detected in the outer regions of the pwn , and also contributes to the interior regions . using a two component model consisting of a power law and a thermal plasma in ionization equilibrium ( see section 4.6 ) , we performed joint fits to spectra from the annular regions indicated in figure 2 .",
    "we obtain a best - fit column density of @xmath21 .",
    "fitting individual regions separately ( both the annuli and also wedge - shaped regions shown in figure 2 ) we do not find any significant evidence of spatial variations in @xmath22 for regions in which the count rate is to low to effectively constrain the absorption , we adopt this value .",
    "the uncertainties quoted here , and throughout the paper ( unless otherwise noted ) , refer to 90% confidence intervals determined from chi - squared fitting of the data to the specified models .",
    "the spectral index varies throughout 3c  58 .",
    "we find , in particular , that the average spectral index increases with radius , as expected for synchrotron losses as the electrons diffuse away from the central regions , and consistent with the results based on studies of 3c  58 with _ asca _",
    "( torii et al .",
    "2000 ) and _ xmm - newton _ ( bocchino et al . 2001 ) .",
    "such an effect is also seen in g21.50.9 ( slane et al . 2000 , warwick et al .",
    "2001 ) and other young pwne . in 3c  58",
    "the x - ray nebula extends nearly all the way to the edge of the radio nebula , indicating that the spectral break falls just below the soft x - ray band ; only high energy electrons are significantly burned - off before reaching the outer regions of the nebula . in figure 4",
    "we plot the radial variation of the power law index in 3c  58 , obtained by extracting spectra from annular regions centered on the pulsar .",
    "here we have used only energies from @xmath23  kev in the fit in order to eliminate any contributions from a soft thermal component ( see section 4.6 ) .    for the jet - like region protruding from the pulsar , we extracted spectra from the entire structure as well as three distinct regions extending across the feature .",
    "fixing the column density for each region at the value derived above , we find a spectral index of @xmath24 with no significant evidence for variations along the jet ( see table 1 ) .",
    "as noted above , one of the remarkable features revealed by the deep acis observation of 3c  58 is the presence of loop - like filaments throughout the nebula .",
    "we have investigated the spectra from several individual filaments , and have compared these with the emission in the `` void '' regions interior to the loops to search for evidence of variations that might be expected if the synchrotron - emitting particles age as they diffuse from the loop regions . while we find spectral index differences between loop - like filaments in the interior and exterior regions of the nebula , the void regions have spectra similar to those of the corresponding filaments ( table 1 ) , although the larger uncertainties on these values prevent us from ruling out softer spectra from regions outside of the filaments , as might be expected if particles are diffusing away from regions of acceleration . the jet - like feature extending westward from the pulsar appears to merge with a loop structure to the southwest , possibly suggesting that the former is not actually a jet .",
    "however , the spectrum of this feature is flatter than for the adjacent loop , indicating that the jet is a distinct feature .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     treating 3c  58  as a prolate ellipsoid , we estimate a total volume of @xmath25 .",
    "the region from which the shell spectrum has been extracted is complicated ; we estimate its volume as roughly one - third that of the entire pwn , but this quantity is quite uncertain .",
    "based on this estimate , the volume emission measure from the spectral fit implies a density of @xmath26 for the thermal material .",
    "this corresponds to a mass of @xmath27 in this volume , and roughly two times this amount for the entire shell ( since less than half of the shell volume is contained in the spectral extraction region ) .",
    "spectral fits for the inner regions of 3c  58 reveal emission from this same plasma component ; this mass estimate is thus a lower limit .",
    "the enhanced abundance of ne and mg indicates that the shell is composed of ejecta .",
    "this is consistent with the picture wherein the optical filaments in 3c  58   result from interactions between the expanding bubble and the supernova ejecta .",
    "however , the mass estimated above appears to be in conflict with the assumed age for 3c  58 .",
    "chevalier ( 2003 ) notes that the amount of mass swept up by the pwn is @xmath28 for most supernova density distributions ; here @xmath29 is the radius of the pwn . for 3c  58",
    "this leads to a predicted swept - up mass nearly 500 times smaller than that inferred from the spectral fits .",
    "a more detailed study of this thermal component is currently underway using a large _ xmm - newton _ dataset obtained from numerous calibration observations , and we defer further discussion of this emission component and its implications for the dynamics and evolution of 3c  58 to a future publication .",
    "deep _ chandra _  observations of 3c  58  reveal a rich x - ray structure consisting of what appear to be magnetic loops .",
    "these structures predominate in the interior , just outside the pulsar termination shock , but are also found in outer regions . the structures are well correlated with radio features , but not , in general , with the optical filaments in 3c  58 .",
    "they appear to have a different origin from the optical and radio filaments in the crab nebula , possibly originating from kink instabilities in the inner toroidal field .",
    "this notion may find additional support from radio polarization data , which appear to show a significant change in the field morphology away from the central regions , but improved radio observations are required to confirm this .",
    "the observed radial variation in the x - ray spectral index is shallower than expected from the kc84 model , possibly also indicating that the field structure differs from that assumed , although the discrepancy could arise from factors other than a modification of the toroidal field .",
    "the detection of a thermal shell confirms the earlier reports by bocchino et al .",
    "( 2001 ) based on xmm data . the emission is enriched in ne and mg , indicating that it is swept - up ejecta from the progenitor .",
    "the total mass of x - ray emitting ejecta is relatively uncertain due to the poorly defined volume and filling factor , as well as the dominant contribution from synchrotron emission throughout most of the pwn .",
    "it is at least several @xmath30 .",
    "the x - ray spectrum of psr  j0205 + 6449  in 3c  58  is not well described by a single power law .",
    "evidence consistent with a hard spectrum ( @xmath31 ) associated with the pulsed component observed with the hrc and rxte is revealed , as is the apparent detection of thermal emission from a hydrogen atmosphere of a neutron star . at the most conservative level ,",
    "new limits on any blackbody - like emission imply a surface temperature @xmath0  k which is far below predictions of standard models based on neutrino cooling through the modified urca process , forcing one to consider either direct urca cooling due to an increased proton fraction or the presence of exotic particles in the interior .    immediately surrounding the pulsar",
    ", the x - ray emission reveals an elongated structure that appears to be a tilted toroid along with a jet extended to the west and some evidence of a counterjet . in this regard ,",
    "the inner portions of 3c  58 appear similar to the crab nebula  if not in brightness , then in overall structure .",
    "the inferred position of the termination shock is inside the position of the radio wisp discovered by frail and moffett ( 1993 ) , presumably indicating that this wisp bounds the outer torus .",
    "the x - ray spectrum of the jet shows no evidence of synchrotron aging , allowing us to to infer a flow velocity @xmath32 , similar to that for the crab jet .",
    "the large - scale morphology of 3c  58 , with its elongation in a direction perpendicular to the inferred pulsar rotation axis , is consistent with models for pwne with embedded toroidal magnetic fields , but the radial variation in spectral index and the radio polarization observations seem to indicate that the field is more complicated than this , perhaps consistent with the small - scale loops described above .",
    "more sensitive radio polarization measurements are required to investigate this further , and deeper optical observations are also of interest to investigate more fully the relationship between optical filaments and the observed x - ray and radio structures .",
