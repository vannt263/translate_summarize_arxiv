    "low - gravity atmospheres , like those of young gas - giant planets , display distinct characteristics compared to their higher - gravity counterparts , even at the same effective temperatures @xcite . both cloudiness and dis - equilibrium chemistry",
    "are enhanced as a result of the prevailing low pressure in the atmospheres of the young low - mass objects : clouds because the photosphere is beneath the temperature - pressure location where refractory elements begin to condense to liquid and solid phases ; and dis - equilibrium chemistry because the longer chemical timescales implied by the low pressure ( and density ) can not keep up with vertical mixing timescales that deliver warm material from deeper layers ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "as demonstrated in the cases of 2 m  1207  b @xcite and hr  8799  b , c , and d @xcite , dis - equilibrium chemistry , vertical mixing , and cloudiness are important factors in understanding the observed features of cool young / low - gravity atmospheres @xcite .",
    "clouds and dis - equilibrium ch@xmath2/co chemistry have a large effect on l - band spectra because the p-,q-,and r - branch methane bandheads trace the abundance of ch@xmath2 , and cloudiness affects the general slope of the spectrum @xcite .",
    "l - band measurements augmenting near - ir ( y , j , h , and k band ) spectra can also help to break degeneracies ( e.g. , between metalicity and gravity ) when performing fits to model atmospheres @xcite .",
    "atmospheric properties are crucial for understanding the nature and origin of directly imaged companions . the hr  8799 system contains four directly imaged companions with a non - hierarchical orbital architecture that closely resembles a planetary system , albeit much more massive then typical @xcite . yet with uncertain companion masses ( @xmath3 ) it is possible ( though unlikely ) that at least some of the companions exceed the @xmath4 minimum mass for deuterium burning .",
    "pso  j318.5 - 22 , a @xmath5 isolated member of the @xmath6  pic moving group , occupies the same locus of color - magnitude space as hr  8799  b , c , d , e , and 2 m 1207 b , but this object is not a planet because it was likely born in isolation @xcite .",
    "pso  j318.5 - 22 and other low - mass brown dwarfs in the field appear to form through an extension of the star - formation process to very low masses @xcite . similarly , 2 m  1207  b likely formed as an extension of the binary - star formation process @xcite .",
    "the orbital architecture of the hr  8799 system suggests a distinct formation mechanism , such as core - accretion or gravitational - instability in a circum - stellar disk @xcite .",
    "thus it appears nature is capable of producing fundamentally different objects , with distinct formation processes that nevertheless have overlapping  planetary \" masses .",
    "spectroscopy constrains the formation mechanisms of directly imaged companions by revealing the composition of their atmospheres @xcite .",
    "if companion atmospheres gain a significant fraction of their mass via the accretion of solids in a disk , then they should show increased metalicity . the core - accretion process for gas - giant planet formation can produce metal enhanced planetary atmospheres compared to the host star @xcite .",
    "gravitational fragmentation of a massive protoplanetary disk can also result in a metal enriched atmosphere @xcite .",
    "furthermore , because of the radial temperature gradient in protoplanetary disks , certain chemical species will be removed from the gas phase at radii corresponding to their freeze - out temperatures .",
    "this will result in distinct elemental ratios in the planetary atmosphere which may be diagnostic of the radial position at which a given planet formed in a disk ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) . on the other hand ,",
    "if a companion is produced via gravitational fragmentation of the initial dense molecular cloud core , no large compositional differences are expected .",
    "the utility of spectroscopy for discriminating between formation modes relies on compositional differences being manifest in the atmospheres of directly imaged companions and may be affected by different assumptions regarding how material from deep within an object can be transported to the outer envelope ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    the magellan adaptive - optics system ( magao ; * ?",
    "* ) , with its adaptive secondary mirror , provides low - background l - band images at the diffraction limit of the 6.5 m magellan clay telescope ( providing a point - spread function with a width of 121 milliarcseconds ) . the mid - infrared camera , clio2 ( like clio , * ? ? ?",

    "* but with an upgraded hawaii-1 array ) that operates behind the magao system , is equipped with a prism that yields increasing spectral resolution from @xmath7@xmath8 across the l - band .",
    "given the sensitive high - spatial resolution capabilities of magao , clio2 spectroscopy is a powerful tool for providing the l - band spectroscopic constraints necessary for a complete understanding of directly imaged low - mass companion atmospheres .",
    "magao / clio2 complements ongoing near - ir surveys for the detection and spectral characterization of new companions , such as the gemini planet imager exoplanet survey @xcite , and surveys with the sphere instrument at the vlt @xcite , which are not sensitive in the l - band .    in this paper",
    ", we establish the l - band spectroscopic mode of magao / clio2 and report first results on low - mass directly imaged companions . in section [ obssec ] we describe our sample of targets and summarize near - ir constraints on the nature of their atmospheres .",

    "given the sensitivity of the magao wavefront sensor and of clio2 , we also selected targets to have guidestar i - band magnitudes @xmath18 and companion l - band magnitudes @xmath19 to facilitate obtaining adequate signal to noise in less than one night of observing .",
    "we focused on targets with well characterized near - ir spectra for direct comparison to our results .",
    "one of our targets , 2mass  j01033563 - 5515561(ab)b ( hereafter 2 m  0103(ab )  b ) , which orbits a 0.2@xmath20 m6-m6 binary - star system , does not have near - ir spectra available in the literature .",
    "we added this target to bolster our low - mass sample and to test the performance of magao while guiding on a close nearly equal - magnitude binary .",
    "the magao system is built around a 585 actuator adaptive secondary mirror that minimizes the number of optical elements necessary for correcting the blurring effects of earth s atmosphere .",
    "compared to alternative implementations that position an adaptive element at a re - imaged pupil plane , adaptive - secondary systems provide higher throughput and lower thermal background @xcite .",
    "the system provides correction for up to 300 modes at up to 989 hz .",
    "the pyramid wavefront sensor used by magao facilitates easy adjustments both in the number of modes corrected and the loop speed to help keep the ao loop locked on faint guidestars or in periods of poor seeing .",
    "the prism in clio2 provides increasing spectral resolution with wavelength . at j",
    "band the typical resolution is r@xmath21 and at m band it is r@xmath22 .",
    "we used a 260 milliarcsecond slit to minimize the bright mid - infrared sky emission in our spectra . for observations with the psf smaller than the slit ,",
    "the size of the psf is the relevant parameter for determining the spectral resolution .",
    "thus , our observed spectral resolution changes with ao performance and wavelength . during the two runs reported here , we realized r=50200 and r=150300 across the l - band .    due to the very different dispersions in the near- and mid - ir , there are different timescales for detector saturation in each band . in order to reduce practical complications related to saturation and cross - talk on the clio2 detector",
    ", we observed through a blocking filter that only passes light from @xmath23  @xmath24 .",
    "two camera lenses provide clio2 with two plate scales , a coarse mode with 27.5 milliarcseconds pixel@xmath25 , and a fine mode with 15.9 milliarcseconds pixel@xmath25 @xcite . as part of our effort to define best practices for the use of the magao / clio2 spectroscopy mode",
    ", we used a different plate scale for each of our runs .",
    "this also accommodated the observation of wider binaries .",
    "the optics used to set the plate scale modify the position of the spectral trace on the clio2 detector .",
    "the fine mode situates the trace on the left side of the detector , and the coarse mode positions the trace on the right side , which has more high dark current pixels and produces noisier spectra as a result .",
    "we used the fine plate scale and observed both twa  5 and during our first run . for our second run",
    ", we used the coarse plate scale and observed @xmath12  tel  b , ab  pic  b , and 2 m  0103(ab )  b. we saved frames differently for each run , saving single images per nod position during the first run and multiple images per nod during the second run .",
    "this difference slightly changes our reduction procedure for each dataset , as discussed below .    for each object , we aligned the binary position angle of our targets to be parallel to the clio2 slit so that we could collect spectra of both primary and companion sources simultaneously .",
    "this orientation allows us to use the primary star as a telluric calibrator for the companion . because the slit position and angle are not repeatable , and because clio2 does not have a slit viewer , we developed the following alignment procedure .",
    "first , after acquiring our targets with the slit and prism out of the beam , we noted the position of the primary star and the position angle of the companion .",
    "next , we introduced the slit and nudged the telescope horizontally until the primary star could be seen in the center .",
    "we then measured the angle of the slit on the detector and calculated the necessary slit rotation offset to align the target pa with the slit .",
    "the calculated rotation offset was implemented in small steps , @xmath26 , without opening the ao loop . by keeping the ao loop closed on the primary star",
    "while we offset the rotator to align our targets , we ensured that the star remained on the rotation axis , stationary in the slit .",
    "once both objects were aligned in the slit , we introduced the prism . in order to track variable background sky emission",
    ", we nodded our targets every 13 mins . when we could , we nodded along the slit so that we were always integrating on the target . at some rotation angles ,",
    "when the entire weight of the wavefront sensor apparatus rested on just one motor , we had to nod off the slit because the motors were insufficiently powered to provide the desired nod vector .",
    "currently both the previous weaker 1.6 amp motors have been replaced by 3.0 amp motors to hold the full weight .    on 2014",
    "november 15 , we observed @xmath12  tel during twilight because the source was setting .",
    "since the sky was bright in the optical , we were unable to perform the normal telescope collimation steps .",
    "we ran the ao loop closed with only 10-modes for five minutes in order to offload as much focus to the telescope as possible , and then increased the number of modes to begin observing .",
    "twilight background light on the wavefront sensor still limited the accuracy of ao corrections and poor ao - performance was realized for this source .",
    "our data reduction process began by subtracting nod pairs .",
    "for the data from april this was simply an a - b and a b - a subtraction , where a and b represent our two nod positions .",
    "for the data from november , when we saved 6 images per nod position , we did @xmath27 and @xmath28 , @xmath29=16 .",
    "we then rotated each image to produce horizontal spectral traces . for the november data",
    ", we also applied a vertical shift to align each of the 6 images per nod , and co - added them .",
    "typical rotations were @xmath30 and typical vertical offsets were @xmath31 pixels .",
    "we created a master spectral trace for each object by combining the traces from each nod sequence . for our april observations we combined the traces using a simple mean . for our november observations ,",
    "since we saved multiple images per nod position , we were able to measure the image variance in each pixel in each nod , so we derived a weight - image for each nod inversely proportional to the image variance before combining . for all of our sources we also bootstrapped the stacking procedure , randomly selecting individual frames ( with replacement ) , before stacking .",
    "this provides a variance image for use in determining optimal weights for spectral extraction ( see below ) , and the raw data for bootstrapping the extraction , wavelength calibration , and telluric correction steps necessary for generating errorbars for our spectra .    for close companions",
    ", spectra may be contaminated by the wings of the primary if the primary flux at the position of the companion is larger than the background noise .",
    "twa  5  b and 2 m  0103(ab )  b are the closest in our sample , requiring attention to this effect .",
    "to remove the light of the primary from the spectrum of the secondary , we created a model of the primary star trace using a high signal - to - noise image of a telluric calibrator spectrum observed just after observing the target .",
    "we rotated and shifted the telluric trace to overlap the trace of the primary .",
    "we then scaled each column of the telluric image so that the pixels in the core and first airy ring best - fit the corresponding pixels in the image of the primary .",
    "this provided us with a model of the trace of the primary without the secondary .",
    "we smoothed this model with a circular gaussian kernel with @xmath32 pixels , and then subtracted it from the image before extracting the companion spectrum . in figure [ twaproffig ]",
    "we show the average spatial profile of twa  5  b before and after correction .    for the 2 m  0103 system , we achieved much lower signal - to - noise than for twa  5 .",
    "therefore our model trace was also noisy .",
    "since the magnitude of the correction for 2 m  0103(ab )  b was much smaller than the noise , we decided not to subtract a noisy model from the images before extraction .",
    "we used the wavelength dependent spatial profiles of primary stars and our bootstrap generated variance maps to define optimal weights @xcite for extraction .",
    "we found that including the first airy ring in the spatial profile was important to avoid fringing in our spectra because spectral traces exhibit a fringe pattern where the core and airy rings oscillate out of phase . for 2 m  0103(ab )  b , the circumbinary source , the primary spatial profile was corrupted by light from the nearby secondary . in this case we used the spatial profile of the telluric calibrator star observed shortly after we observed the target .",
    "we derived our wavelength calibration based on the location of telluric absorption features in our spectra .",
    "first , we verified that the wavelength solution does not change  modulo horizontal offsets due to the variable slit position  with position on the detector .",
    "then , for each night , we shifted and stacked all the telluric calibrator spectra using an inverse variance weighted mean to create a high signal - to - noise template spectrum of the telluric absorption .",
    "to identify telluric absorption features in our stacked telluric spectra , we used a high - resolution atran @xcite synthetic transmission spectrum tuned for cerro pachon and made available by the gemini observatory .",
    "our approach was iterative , first smoothing the synthetic transmission spectrum to match a best - guess of the linearly increasing spectral resolution delivered by the instrument and then comparing the smoothed synthetic spectrum to our observed spectrum to derive a second - order polynomial transformation to take pixel position to wavelength .",
    "we then performed a two - parameter grid search to better identify the appropriate linearly increasing resolution parameters for the synthetic spectrum .",
    "this process was repeated until the wavelength solution and spectral resolution parameters converged .",
    "figure [ resolutionfig ] shows our stacked telluric calibrator spectra for each run and the atran telluric transmission spectrum smoothed using the best - fit linearly increasing resolution parameters .    the best fit for 2014 april 7 ( 15.9 mas / pixel mode ) was r=50200 .",
    "the best fit for both 2014 november 14 and 15 ( 25.7 mas / pixel mode ) was r=150300 .",
    "the functional forms of the wavelength solutions for each run , modulo horizontal pixel offsets , are @xmath33 for our april run , with an rms scatter of 0.012 @xmath0 m , and @xmath34 for our november run , with an rms scatter of 0.007 @xmath0 m .",
    "we wavelength calibrated the science target spectra by fitting for the best horizontal offset between target and calibrator , using a cubic interpolation scheme to perform the shift .",
    "two of our targets , , and 2 m  0103(ab )  b , did not have high enough signal - to - noise to provide an adequate fit for the best horizontal offset .",
    "for these sources , we calculated the appropriate horizontal offset using the measured rotation angle of the slit and the separation from the primary .",
    "we verified using our other targets that this approach yields the correct offset to within 12 pixels .",
    "our telluric calibration strategy used primaries to correct companions , and a - stars to correct primaries .",
    "we started by correcting primaries .",
    "we divided by the a - star spectrum obtained closest in time to a target spectrum and then multiplied by @xmath35 to correct for the intrinsic black - body shape of the hot calibrator ( this introduces @xmath36 error ) . since most primaries have a more complicated intrinsic spectrum , before correcting companion spectra we fit for the best synthetic atmosphere spectrum from the grids of bt - settl atmospheres ( solar metallicity models from both the 2012 and 2015 grids were used ; * ? ? ?",

    "* ) and ( primary spectral type m1v ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we did not obtain an adequate telluric calibrator spectrum . in these cases we used spectral types from the literature to select the appropriate model for the intrinsic shape of the primary spectrum , using the spectral - type ",
    "t@xmath37 relationship of @xcite .",
    "for each object we determined the best fit model atmosphere from the latest bt - settl grid @xcite .",
    "many of our companions have had bt - settl 2012 models @xcite fit to their near - ir spectra , so we also fit to that grid to facilitate a direct comparison .",
    "we used models with effective temperatures ranging from 1200 k to 7000 k , restricting ourselves to models with solar metallicity and with surface gravity between log(g)=3.5 and log(g)=5.0 .",
    "figure [ grav ] illustrates how we chose this range of gravities . at ages greater than 5 myr , even 2  @xmath38 objects should have surface gravity greater than log(g)=3.5 .",
    "likewise , even 100 myr old brown dwarfs at 80  @xmath38 should have surface gravity less than log(g)=5.0 .",
    "these restrictions fold in our prior knowledge on the age of our targets into the fitting process . after smoothing model spectra to the resolution of clio2",
    ", fitting was done via @xmath39 minimization using the inverse of our bootstrap errorbars as weights .",
    "our fits ignored the spectral regions between 3.173.26  @xmath0 m and 3.293.35  @xmath0 m because these regions are affected by strong telluric absorption and are most susceptible to calibration errors .",
    "the best fits for each object are shown in figure [ spec ] .",
    "the range of allowed model atmosphere parameters consistent with our data depends on an accurate estimation of our observational uncertainty . as discussed in section [ extractsec ] , we measured the magnitude of random errors in our data using the bootstrap method , but fixed - pattern noise  from flat field effects and bad pixels  adds systematic error to our spectra . to account for this , we scaled up the size of our errorbars using a single empirically determined scale factor for every spectrum .",
    "this scale factor was determined as follows .",
    "we selected our highest signal - to - noise spectra , excluding the unresolved binary sources twa  5  a and 2m0103ab .",
    "this left us with ab pic a , @xmath12 tel b , and twa 5 b. we then scaled the size of the errorbars for each source until the best - fit model atmosphere provided a reduced @xmath39 of 1 .",
    "we found scale factors ranging from 3.8 to 5 .",
    "we adopted the value of 5 corresponding to the scale factor for ab pic a because it is more conservative ( larger errors lead to larger allowed ranges for model parameters ) and because it corresponds to a hotter , more massive star where atmospheric model parameters are more mature and better tested .",
    "the size of our scaled uncertainties are indicated with gray swaths in figure [ spec ] .    in figure [ chifigs ]",
    ", we show @xmath39 as a function of temperature and gravity for each of our sources .",

    "pic  b and 2m01013(ab )  b the @xmath39 curves in figure [ chifigs ] show two minima with similar values .",
    "this will result in very large weighted variances .",
    "the 2015 and 2012 grids provide mostly similar fits to our spectra , and these fits reveal atmospheric parameters consistent with those deduced by fits to 12.5 @xmath0 m spectra .",
    "two of our sources , ab  pic  b and 2m0103(ab )  b , are fit by significantly different parameters when using the 2015 and 2012 grid .",
    "figure [ chifigs ] shows that the difference is due to a change in the shape of model spectra @xmath47 .",
    "this can be seen by noting that @xmath39 values for the hotter best - fit models from the 2012 grid remain unchanged in the 2015 grid , yet significantly better fits are obtained at 1500  k. both objects exhibit a jump in the observed flux level near 3.4  @xmath0 m that persists to the blue - end of the spectrum , resulting in a generally blue slope .",
    "we discuss these two targets in more detail in section [ absec ] .",

    "34  @xmath0 m spectra do exhibit distinct features compared to late m - dwarfs and early l - dwarfs because of increased methane opacity and decreased cloud opacity at cooler temperatures . the latest spectral type source in our sample , cd-35  2722  b , which is classified as l3 based on nir spectral indicators @xcite , appears redder than the best fit l5 field dwarf spectrum , with most of our measurements below the dwarf spectrum at the blue end of the band , and most of our measurements above the dwarf spectrum at the red end .",
    "this example suggests the importance of l - band spectroscopy for objects with later spectral type than mid - l , where the first hints of ch@xmath2 absorption are expected to arise @xcite .",
    "the low surface gravity prevalent in young planetary mass atmospheres is responsible for the presence of clouds and dis - equilibrium chemistry at effective temperatures @xmath71 to @xmath72  k , where older more massive t - dwarfs appear cloud free and methane rich @xcite .",
    "here we observe a warmer more - massive population of young companions .",
    "most of our atmospheric fits are consistent with the fits found by previous authors using nir spectra .",
    "the similarity of our l - band derived atmospheric parameters compared to near - ir results demonstrates the functionality of the magao / clio2 spectroscopic mode and the general success of model atmospheres to capture the most important physics responsible for the appearance of spectra at these effective temperatures , where clouds are expected and ch@xmath2 absorption is not .",
    "our data allow us to constrain the onset of peculiarities where young low - gravity objects appear to have l - band spectra distinct from field objects",
    ". this range must be below @xmath73  k , the effective temperature found here for ab  pic  b and 2 m  0103(ab )  b. this interval of effective temperatures includes the l - t transition for field brown dwarfs , emphasizing that the discrepancies in 34  @xmath0 m spectra may be related to the cloud clearing and chemical processes responsible for the evolution from l - dwarf to t - dwarf .    [ [ section ] ]    @xcite assigned a spectral type of l3 with intermediate surface gravity for based on an average of several indicators .",
    "those authors noted exhibited significantly higher gravity than 2mass  j03552337 + 1133437 , which has similar infrared spectral type and age @xcite . among our targets , fits to bt - settl models suggest that exhibits the highest surface gravity , consistent with previous studies and the relatively old age of the object compared to the rest of our sample .",
    "was classified as an l4 by @xcite based on the similarity of its j , h , and k - band spectra to 2mass  j2224438 - 015852 , an object whose very red color is distinct from other field dwarfs and implies large amounts of atmospheric dust @xcite . has a bluer nir color than 2mass  j2224438 - 015852 @xcite , suggesting somewhat different cloud structure .",
    "our spectrum of is redder than the l5 field dwarf template spectrum we compared it to and best - fit model atmospheres are cooler than reported for nir fits .",
    "these results are driven by a blue slope to our spectrum .",
    "since we do not have a telluric calibrator for the primary star in the system , we assumed the intrinsic shape of the star ( based on its spectral type ) when we calibrated the substellar companion . to check whether the blue slope of and our fitted parameters for this object could be due to selecting an overly red intrinsic spectrum for the primary , we repeated our telluric calibration procedure using a model corresponding to two spectral subtypes earlier than originally used .",
    "this did not result in a hotter best - fit model atmosphere .",
    "is the oldest target in our young sample ( @xmath74 myr , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and has the highest surface - gravity .",
    "if its red 34  @xmath0 m spectral slope does indicate thinning clouds , our observations suggest that this source may be cooler and of later type than previously thought , but this would need to be confirmed with higher signal - to - noise observations .",
    "as we pointed out in section [ fitsec ] , the bt - settl 2012 and 2015 grids provide very different best - fit effective temperatures for ab  pic  b and 2 m  0103(ab )  b. each of these targets is better fit with a 1500  k model from the 2015 grid while fits to the 2012 grid show 2600  k and 2900  k models are preferred for ab  pic  b and 2m0103(ab )  b , respectively .",
    "however , models with different effective temperatures have different predicted total fluxes . for an age of 30 myr ,",
    "the bt - settl evolutionary models predicts l absolute magnitudes of 8.7 mags and 7.5 mags for 2600  k and 2900  k effective temperatures , respectively @xcite .",
    "these are both significantly brighter than the absolute l magnitudes reported by @xcite for ab  pic  b ( @xmath75 ) and 2m0103(ab )  b ( @xmath76 ) . according to the models ,",
    "the observed fluxes correspond to objects with effective temperatues @xmath77 .",
    "both ab  pic  b and 2 m  0103(ab )  b exhibit an increase in flux in the spectral region between @xmath78@xmath79  @xmath0 m . while part of this range includes a region of strong telluric absorption which challenges precise calibration ,",
    "a significant portion is outside the strongest telluric features .",
    "none of the atmospheric models predict such a feature and the high effective temperatures suggested by the bt - settl 2012 fits are probably incorrect , caused by the average blue slope of the spectra due to the anomalous blue feature .    for 2 m  0103(ab )  b , the feature may be due to a combination of lower signal - to - noise and difficulties in observing and calibrating associated with orbiting a close binary ( e.g. , reduced ao performance ) . however , for ab  pic  b , we achieved higher signal - to noise across the spectrum .",
    "the spectrum of ab  pic  b was corrected for telluric emission using the spectrum of ab  pic  a , which was positioned within the slit with ab  pic  b and observed simultaneously ; any atmospheric changes during the course of the observation should have been tracked perfectly by the primary .",
    "furthermore , our model atmosphere fit for ab  pic  a is exactly as expected for the spectral type ( k1v ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , suggesting we have properly calibrated ab  pic  a and identified the correct model for its intrinsic spectral shape when correcting ab  pic  b. given the quality of the telluric correction of ab  pic  a , we also checked whether correcting ab  pic  b with the same a - star calibrator provided a different result . regardless of whether hd  32007 or ab  pic  a is used for telluric calibration , the increased flux short of 3.4 @xmath0 m persists .",
    "we also verified that the feature is present in both a - nods and b - nods independently and in the first half of our integrations as well as in the second half .",
    "if the increase in our spectrum is physical , the larger - than - expected flux in the spectral region corresponding to methane opacity could indicate an atmospheric inversion or possibly an aurora ( e.g. ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , strong h@xmath1 emission , often associated with aurorae ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , is not present at 3.5 and 3.7 @xmath0 m .",
    "polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon molecules ( pahs ) are known to have broad emission bands centered at 3.3 and 3.4 microns .",
    "however , fluorescent pahs in the vicinity of ab  pic  b and 2 m  0103(ab )  b are unlikely given the system ages .",
    "while ab  pic  a is known as a faint euv and x - ray source @xcite , this seems unlikely to cause strong pah excitation .",
    "additional follow up observations of ab  pic  b in the l - band are warranted to better understand the blue feature seen in our data .",
    "we commissioned the l - band spectroscopic mode of clio2 behind the magao system .",
    "we observed five young systems with directly imaged low - mass companions .",
    "the recovered spectra of primary stars match templates for their literature spectral types , confirming the fidelity of the observations .",
    "the spectra of companions are consistent with expectations based on fits to shorter wavelength data .",
    "this result constrains the temperature range where the l - band seds of young directly imaged planets begin to diverge from older field dwarfs to @xmath80  k. this range includes the the l - t transition for field dwarfs , providing further evidence that observed discrepancies are due to clouds and non - equilibrium co / ch@xmath2 chemistry due to vertical mixing .",
    "the l - band spectrum of is redder than field dwarfs and suggests some cloud settling in this @xmath74  myr old object but low signal to noise limits our ability to draw any firm conclusions .",
    "we also see an increased flux feature from 2.953.4  @xmath0 m in the spectra of 2 m  0103(ab )  b and ab  pic  b. the feature coincides with methane bandheads , and if physical , could indicate a thermal inversion .",
