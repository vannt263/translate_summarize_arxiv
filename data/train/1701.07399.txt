    "after tracing out the large system as described in the main text , we are left with the probe qubit with the density matrix @xmath92 where @xmath93 is the _ unknown parameter _ to be estimated , and @xmath94 is a control pulse to be optimised for optimal qfi . for any parameter value @xmath2 ,",
    "the optimal measurement is given by @xmath95 where the symmetric logarithmic derivative @xmath96 is determined by the coefficients @xmath97 it is easy to verify that the hermitian operator @xmath16 admits a projective measurement with two outcomes @xmath98 and projectors @xmath99 .    in the estimation procedure described in the main text , the measurement of @xmath100 with an optimal control pulse @xmath101 for the @xmath102th _ guessed value _",
    "@xmath32 is performed on the state @xmath27 , which is the _ true _ quantum state generated with that pulse .",
    "hence the probabilities for the two outcomes of the measurement of @xmath100 are given by @xmath103 by repeating the measurement on @xmath104 copies of the true state , we would estimate the expectation value @xmath105 we simulate this experiment by generating random outcomes from a binomial distribution with sample size @xmath106 and the true ( unknown ! ) probabilities @xmath107 calculated from the above formula .",
    "this gives us frequencies @xmath108 which we then use in place of the true probabilities @xmath109 in the above formula to calculate updated estimate @xmath110 described in the main text .      the optimal control software _ qtrl _",
    "@xcite generally optimises control pulses by minimising a given fidelity , which by default is chosen to be a suitable distance from a target quantum object ( either a state or a unitary operator ) . for the purpose of the present work",
    ", we needed to implement a completely different fidelity , namely the negative of the qfi @xmath21 described in the main text .",
    "since the optimisation is based on a gradient search , the implementation requires the computation of both the function @xmath111 and its gradient .",
    "we now proceed to detail how these are obtained .",
    "we note that even though we applied the scheme to the specific heisenberg spin chain , the composed optimisation program is general , and can in principle be used in any setting involving a large system estimated via an embedded single qubit probe .",
    "first of all , we need to specify how the probe is embedded .",
    "this is done simply by defining how the qubit pauli matrices act on the total system consisting of both the probe and the large system .",
    "for instance , if the qubit is a subsystem ( i.e. , a tensor factor ) , the action of the @xmath112th pauli matrix is just @xmath113 , where the nontrivial action is on the probe system and the identity acts everywhere else . in our case , working in a single excitation sector , it is necessary to consider direct sum instead ; hence we allow arbitrary embeddings @xmath114 .",
    "as described in the main text , the final state is determined by a control pulse @xmath115 , through @xmath116 , where the total transformation is a unitary @xmath117 given by the product of unitary propagators of the form @xmath118 . here",
    "the generator @xmath119 depends on the target parameter @xmath2 and a single constant @xmath120 characterising the strength of the applied control . by tracing out everything except the probe qubit",
    ", we obtain the bloch vector @xmath121 of the probe , which gives us the qfi @xmath21 via eq .",
    "( 1 ) of the main text .",
    "the control optimisation refers to maximising @xmath21 with respect to the pulse @xmath13 .",
    "more generally , the program can handle generators of the form @xmath122 , i.e. , with several control pulses , but we present the following with a single pulse so as to avoid cluttering the notation .    in order to compute @xmath21 , we need the components of the bloch vector @xmath121 of the final probe state , together with their derivatives : @xmath123 where @xmath124 and the expectation values on the right - hand side are understood componentwise in the obvious fashion . using the chain rule we can write the relevant derivative as @xmath125 which we get once we have a method of computing @xmath126 and @xmath127 for arbitrary @xmath120 .",
    "we now proceed to look at the gradient .",
    "we use the shorthand notation @xmath128 and suppress the parameter dependence for simplicity . by differentiating the formula ( 1 ) in the main text , we find @xmath129 where @xmath130 . in order to evaluate this function , we need two new quantities @xmath131 since @xmath132 only appears in the @xmath112th propagator ( while @xmath2 is in each one ) , we have @xmath133 hence , in order to compute both @xmath134 and its gradient , we need the four quantities @xmath126 , @xmath135 , @xmath127 , and @xmath136 . while the first two had already been implemented in _ qtrl _ , we needed to construct the @xmath2-derivatives specific to the estimation context .",
    "following @xcite , we observe that all these derivatives can be conveniently computed simultaneously as follows .",
    "we write @xmath137 for each @xmath138 , and successively differentiate the evolution equation to get @xmath139 this can be written as the single block matrix equation @xmath140 with @xmath141 where @xmath142 since @xmath143 , we immediately get @xmath144 that is , we can extract all the required derivatives from the first column of the blocks of the matrix @xmath145 .",
    "the computation of this matrix exponential therefore completes the calculation of both the qfi and its gradient ."

    "<S> we start with @xmath84 . as in the two - spin case </S>",
    "<S> , we observe roughtly three stages : first the excitation propagates across the chain , reaching the end at around @xmath86 . while the information on @xmath2 is accumulated , the populations remain more or less the same with some fluctuations , and eventually the excitation is brought back to the probe spin . </S>",
    "<S> we observed that this behaviour is fairly typical also with other parameters and longer chains . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , the system often returns to the initial state @xmath87 by the time the measurement is performed on the probe spin . </S>",
    "<S> as we already discussed in the two - spin case , the final state @xmath87 does not explicitly depend on the target parameter @xmath2 ; we learn about @xmath2 by the failure of the return of the excitation .    from the numerics </S>",
    "<S> it appears that the initial state @xmath88 gives the best estimation results . in order to understand this , </S>",
    "<S> let us exclude a couple of suggestive alternatives : one might think that a superposition state of the probe such as @xmath89 would be good for sensing the phase @xmath90 . </S>",
    "<S> such a final pure state , as a reduced state of the probe spin , is not available for the initial state @xmath87 , since the probe spin is entangled with the rest of the chain when the probe spin is partially populated . </S>",
    "<S> it is also understandable that initial states @xmath91 with small @xmath62 are not useful , since the excitation transferred to the target spin is small .    _ </S>",
    "<S> _ discussion and outlook.__we started with a natural setup for controlled parameter estimation in a quantum many - body system and found that its optimal performance is closely related to achieving perfect state transfer @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> although the methods developed here were used for a specific system , they are completely general . </S>",
    "<S> this means that we can immediately employ the program to study spin networks and experimental setups , paving the way to an optimal interplay of control and estimation in quantum technologies .    </S>",
