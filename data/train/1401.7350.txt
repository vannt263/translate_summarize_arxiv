    "but quantum systems are never isolated ; they interact with their environment , and this gives rise to perturbations that can strongly affect their behavior .",
    "such interaction affects all the phenomena enumerated above , as well as other phenomena including dephasing in metals @xcite , nuclear - spin - dependent ground - state dephasing in diamond nitrogen - vacency centers @xcite , broadening and shift of atomic clock transitions @xcite , and decoherence in quantum information processes @xcite .",
    "the dynamics of a quantum system coupled to an environment ( a bath ) is often treated in terms of the reduced density matrix of the system obtained by tracing out the bath degrees of freedom in the state of the system plus bath @xcite . upon assuming that the initial density matrix is of a product state form ,",
    "making the born - markov approximation and the rotating wave approximation ( rwa ) @xcite , the resulting master equation for the reduced density matrix is of lindblad form @xcite .",
    "an alternative treatment models the coupling of the quantum system and the bath by introducing stochastic fields that act on the system , where the stochastic fields are generated by a complex environment @xcite .",
    "the statistical properties of the stochastic fields are determined by the properties of the environment .",
    "the environment can sometimes be modeled as a ensemble of approximately independent fluctuating fields in steady state ( e.g. , in thermal equilibrium ) . in this approximation , the resultant stochastic field felt by the system is a superposition of a large number of components . due to the central limit theorem @xcite , the stochastic fields can be represented by gaussian , stationary stochastic processes which are completely specified by their first two moments . moreover ,",
    "if the timescales of the bath are small compared to those of the system , the stochastic processes can be approximated to be gaussian white noise .",
    "the averaged ( over stochastic realizations ) quantities obtained for gaussian white noise are equivalent to the averages obtained using a lindblad master equation approach @xcite ( see sec .  [",

    "is called the _ schrdinger - langevin stochastic differential equation formalism _ ( slsde ) @xcite . in principle , the bath could be affected by the system ( back - action ) .",
    "this back - action would modify the properties of the noise felt by the system and effectively appear as a self - interaction mediated by the environment . however , if the perturbation caused to the environment by the quantum system is weak , back - action can be neglected @xcite .",
    "the neglect of back - action is similar to one of the approximations ( the born approximation ) made in the born - markov approximation of the master equation approach .",

    ", the differences between ( b ) and ( c ) are small .",
    "no difference between ( b ) and ( c ) results due to the @xmath3-component of the noise field , whose noise hamiltonian commutes with the rwa transformation ; moreover , there is some compensation which takes place between the @xmath159 and @xmath167 components .",
    "much of our experience with quantum dynamics comes from applying it to two - level systems driven by an electromagnetic field .",
    "but such systems are never truly isolated , and their interaction with their environment affect their mysterious quantum properties , i.e. , their quantum coherence .",
    "such interaction is at the heart of the fundamental limitations of quantum metrology and quantum information processing . using the schrdinger - langevin stochastic differential equation ( slsde ) formalism",
    ", we studied the dynamics of a two - level quantum system driven by single frequency electromagnetic field , with and without making the rotating wave approximation ( rwa ) .",
    "if the transformation to the rotating frame does not commute with the stochastic hamiltonian , i.e. , if the stochastic field has nonvanishing components in the transverse direction , the rwa modifies the stochastic terms in the hamiltonian .",
    "the decay terms in a master equation ( i.e. , the liouville  von neumann density matrix equation ) will also be affected .",
    "we found that for gaussian white noise , the master equation for the density matrix is easily derived from the slse , with and without the rwa .",
    "for the rwa , both the ssle and the derived master equation have lindblad terms with coefficients that are time - dependent ( i.e. , the master equation is time - local @xcite ) when the non - commutation of the rwa transformation and the noise hamiltonian is properly accounted for .",
    "but since @xmath61 effectively vanishes for white gaussian noise , it is not necessary to take the non - commutation into account , independent of the strength of the noise ( @xmath100 ) , and we obtain an analytic expression for the density matrix of the system , eq .",
    "( [ eq : rho_an ] ) , which fully describes the dynamics of the two - level system in the presence of the noise . on the other hand , for the non - markovian ornstein ",
    "uhlenbeck noise case , the rwa dynamics must be calculated taking the non - commutation of the rwa transformation and the noise hamiltonian into account when @xmath168 .",
    "decoherence and dephasing of two - level systems can be probed by measuring the population decay ( @xmath169 ) and the transverse relaxation time ( @xmath170 ) in magnetic resonance studies @xcite .",
    "one well - studied physical system in which such studies have been carried out is the negatively - charged nitrogen - vacancy ( nv ) color center in diamond .",
    "an nv center consists of a substitutional nitrogen atom adjacent to a missing carbon atom within the diamond crystal lattice @xcite .",
    "the negatively charged nv center has a discrete electronic energy level structure and a ground electronic state of symmetry @xmath171 , where this state designation refers to an irreducible representation of the @xmath172 group .",
    "the three electronic magnetic sub - levels of the triplet ground state are @xmath173 , where @xmath174 and @xmath175 , with the @xmath3 axis ( quantization axis ) taken along the nv axis .",
    "the three @xmath174 ground state levels are split by a spin - spin ( crystal field ) interaction that raises the energy of the @xmath176 states with respect to the @xmath177 state by @xmath178 ghz .",
    "the nv system can behave like a two - level system if one of the three states is not allowed to be populated .",
    "the main sources of decoherence are from the paramagnetic impurity spin bath , which dominates at high nitrogen concentration , and interactions with the spin 1/2 @xmath179c nuclei @xcite .",
    "population decay , @xmath169 , is dominated by raman - type interactions with lattice phonons at high temperature ( room temperature and above ) , orbach - type interaction with local phonons at lower temperatures @xcite , and at temperatures below about 100 k , density - dependent cross - relaxation effects between nv centers and between nvs and other impurities . at these low temperatures ,",
    "the resulting @xmath169 can be dramatically tuned using an external magnetic field @xcite . for dilute samples ,",
    "the contribution of nv  nv dipolar interactions to the magnetic resonance broadening can be approximated by assuming that each nv center couples to neighboring nv centers , to substitutional nitrogen ( p1 ) centers , which have a spin of 1/2 , and with @xmath179c nuclei , which have a nuclear spin of 1/2 and a natural abundance of about 1% .",
    "dipolar coupling with other nv centers leads to a spin - relaxation contribution on the order of @xmath180 , where @xmath181 is the nv concentration @xcite . for [ nv ]",
    "= 15 ppm , this corresponds to @xmath182 s@xmath183 , where @xmath184 is the spin relaxation rate to to the @xmath179c nuclei .",
    "since the dynamics of the @xmath179c nuclear spin is slow , it can be modeled , to good approximation , as quasi - static guassian noise .",
    "since the spin dynamics of the nv centers and pi centers in diamond are fast , the contribution of nv  nv and nv  p1 interactions can be modeled , to good approximation , as gaussian white noise . as demonstrated in ref .",
    "@xcite , cw hole - burning and lock - in detection can be used to eliminate the linewidth contribution from slowly fluctuating @xmath179c nuclei while rapidly fluctuating magnetic fields from nearby substitutional nitrogen ( p1 ) centers and nv centers continue to contribute to a reduced linewidth .",
    "hence , by adjusting the external magnetic field strength and the concentrations of nv centers , p1 centers and @xmath179c , the volatilities @xmath185 , the stochastic magnetic field correlation times @xmath2 and the detuning from resonance @xmath186 can be modified .",
    "if only two of the three triplet ground state levels @xmath173 are populated , the methods developed in this manuscript can be applied directly ; if all three levels are populated , it is straightforward to generalize the spin 1/2 treatment here to @xmath174 . in either case , the conclusions we obtained are quite general and are expected to apply to the nv diamond system .",
    "one would , of course need to know the correlation times and the strength of the noises affecting the nv centers .",
    "specifically , if the correlation time @xmath2 of the noise ( of the bath coupled to the system ) is of order of the frequency of the electromagnetic field @xmath1 that couples the levels , the non - commutativity of the rwa transformation and the noise hamiltonian must be taken into account , even when the criteria for validity of the rwa for the system are satisfied . for diamond nv centers ,",
    "the resonant frequency @xmath1 for transitions from @xmath187 to @xmath188 is of order ghz ( with no external magnetic field , it is 2.87 ghz ) , so for @xmath189 , @xmath2 must be of order milliseconds . when @xmath162 , the non - commutativity need _ not _ be taken into account .",
