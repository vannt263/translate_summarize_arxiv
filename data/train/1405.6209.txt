    "controlling probability transfer in quantum systems is a central challenge faced in several emerging quantum technologies  @xcite . here",
    "we develop an approach based on a complex network theory viewpoint of quantum systems  @xcite , in which probability transfer is directed by the controlled breaking of time - reversal symmetry , creating a so - called _ chiral quantum walk _",
    "@xcite .",
    "the practical importance of time - reversal symmetry breaking stems from the fact that it is equivalent to introducing biased probability flow into a quantum system .",
    "it thus enables directed state transfer without requiring a biased ( or non - local ) distribution in the initial states , or coupling to an environment  @xcite .",
    "this work establishes , in terms of the geometry and edge - weights ( or gates ) of the underlying graph , conditions on what makes a hamiltonian ( or circuit ) time - asymmetric .",
    "as well as allowing us to classify the time - symmetry of well - known hamiltonians and circuits , this knowledge allows us to develop active methods to break time symmetry and bias probability transfer , including using circuits to simulate time - symmetry breaking hamiltonians .    as a demonstration ,",
    "the most basic time - asymmetric process is identified and realized experimentally using room - temperature liquid state nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) on a @xmath0-qubit system .",
    "we show that time - asymmetry and thus biased probability transport can be controlled with limited access to the system , namely by using local @xmath1-rotations paired with a naturally occurring ( or in our case , emulated ) time - symmetric evolution . through",
    "symmetry - breaking we achieve state transfer probabilities approaching unity .    since their recent introduction  @xcite , continuous time chiral quantum walks",
    "have been studied in the context of energy transport in ultracold atoms and molecules  @xcite , in non - equilibrium physics  @xcite , as a tool for quantum search @xcite , and as a method to achieve near perfect state transfer  @xcite .",
    "our theory extends the contemporary analysis of time - asymmetry such that it can now apply to gate sequences  of which the existing theory of time - symmetry becomes a special case  and presents a network classification of the effect .",

    "there are two ways in which we consider the walk @xmath4 to be time - symmetric .",

    "it further implies what we call _ probability time - reversal symmetry _ ( pts ) : symmetry of the inter - node transition probabilities going forward and backward in time , @xmath12 .",
    "this is equivalent to a lack of directional bias in the transport between any pair of nodes in the same time direction : @xmath13 .",
    "breaking amplitude time - reversal symmetry is a necessary , but not sufficient , condition for breaking probability time - reversal symmetry . in studying internode transport",
    ", pts is the relevant feature .",
    "it leads to a richer classification of processes and is the focus of this work .",
    "we first consider a unitary propagator @xmath14 generated by some time - independent hamiltonian @xmath15 . in our network - based picture , with nodes labeled by  @xmath6 , we view the matrix elements @xmath16 representing hamiltonian @xmath15 as forming a complex hermitian adjacency matrix . here",
    "@xmath17 and @xmath3 take only real values . for a non - zero value @xmath18 , two nodes @xmath6 and @xmath19",
    "are said to be connected by an edge @xmath20 , and the complex valued edge - weight is given by the value of @xmath18 .",
    "a special case is an edge that connects @xmath6 to itself , called a self - edge .",
    "since it represents the expectation value of the energy in state @xmath21 , the weight @xmath22 of a self - edge must take a real value .",
    "furthermore , self - edges are only needed if states @xmath21 have different energies @xmath22 , otherwise they may be omitted without changing the underlying physics . taken together ,",
    "the nodes and edges define a support graph , corresponding to the hamiltonian  @xmath15 , that we will use to classify the time - symmetry of  @xmath4 .",
    "we begin by noting that if @xmath23 , i.e.  all edge - weights are real , then both amplitude and probability time - reversal symmetry hold .",
    "we will now search for other probability time - symmetric hamiltonians .",
    "a large class of such hamiltonians are obtained by considering mapping @xmath24 ( or equivalently @xmath25 ) , where @xmath26 is a diagonal unitary .",
    "such a mapping will in general affect amplitude time - symmetry . however , it can not affect transition probabilities as @xmath27 , and hence can not affect probability time - asymmetry .",
    "thus , we will call these mappings _ quasi - gauge symmetry transformations_.    all hamiltonians that are obtained from a hamiltonian with real edge - weights by such gauge transformations are thus probability time - symmetric . to give an example , if the graph underlying  @xmath15 is a tree ( of which a linear chain is a special case ) , there always exists  @xcite a  @xmath26 which removes all phases from the edge - weights : @xmath28 .",
    "such hamiltonians hence never break probability time symmetry .",
    "this gives us our first class of time - symmetric evolutions : those generated by hamiltonians whose internode couplings form a tree structure ( this may include self - edges ) .",
    "the class of probability time - symmetric networks is richer than those obtained by gauge transformations from real hamiltonians . to find the other members of this class",
    ", we must consider the interference between walks along different paths .",
    "we start by breaking the evolution into commuting even and odd functions of @xmath15 : @xmath29 .",
    "the probability time - symmetry condition @xmath30 can now be expressed as @xmath31 the physical interpretation of eq .",
    "is clear : @xmath32 corresponds to transitions along paths of odd length , and @xmath33 to transitions along paths of even length .",
    "together these terms account for all possible paths between @xmath6 and  @xmath19   nodes , the cayley - hamilton theorem asserts the existence of a vanishing polynomial with highest degree at most @xmath34 .",
    "this implies that transitions of higher order can be expressed in terms of @xmath34-long paths . ] . a path from @xmath6 to itself",
    "is called a cycle . for graph geometries where between each pair of nodes @xmath35",
    "there are only exclusively even or exclusively odd paths ( equivalent to there being no odd - length cycles in the graph ) , probability time - symmetry must always hold as eq .",
    "is always satisfied .",
    "such graphs are called bipartite , where the nodes can be partitioned to two disjoint sets and non - zero edge - weights @xmath36 only connect nodes of different sets   be an arbitrary node , and denote by @xmath37 the set of nodes that are connected to @xmath38 with paths of even lengths and by @xmath39 the nodes that are connected to @xmath38 with paths of odd lengths .",
    "the union of @xmath37 and @xmath39 contain all the nodes , the intersection of @xmath37 and @xmath39 is empty , and any node in @xmath37 is directly connected only to nodes in @xmath39 and vice versa ; hence the graph is bipartite . ] .",
    "note that this disallows self - edges , since such edges could be used to make cycles of arbitrary length .",
    "bipartite graphs can also be understood in terms of gauge transformations , as their structure implies the existence of a gauge transformation @xmath40 , which immediately implies the probability time - symmetry condition @xmath41 .",
    "this leaves us with two overlapping classes of time - symmetric network geometries , trees with self - edges and bipartite graphs , where the overlap is the class of trees without self - edges or , equivalently , bipartite graphs without simple cycles . the remaining graph geometries are potentially time - asymmetric , with the degree of asymmetry determined by the values assigned to the edge - weights .",
    "these findings are summarized with examples in table  [ tab : graph - table ] .",
    "consider now instead a unitary propagator  @xmath4 formed by a palindi should be romic circuit consisting of two - site gates , @xmath42 . here",
    "the arrows indicate that the second part of the circuit is the reverse of the first , ensuring the circuit is palindromic , since non - palindromic sequences trivially break time - symmetry and thus do not support control over time - symmetry breaking .",
    "each circuit is associated with its support graph , which has an edge if and only if there is a gate in the circuit directly connecting the two sites .    in accordance with the majority of physical implementations ,",
    "each gate @xmath43 with @xmath44 acts on two sites connected by the edge  @xmath45 .",
    "like before , we explicitly break apart the two complex off - diagonal elements of each gate hamiltonian , writing @xmath46 , where @xmath47 .",
    "we now identify time - symmetric circuits as we did for hamiltonians .",
    "our starting point is the case in which each gate is amplitude time - symmetric , @xmath48 , or equivalentlyi should be @xmath49 .",
    "this ensures amplitude time - symmetry of the whole palindromic sequence @xmath11 , and thus also probability time - symmetry  .",
    "once again , we find other time - symmetric circuits by considering gauge transformations @xmath50 away from this class of circuits .",
    "analogous to tree hamiltonians discussed in the previous section , consider minimal spanning tree circuits , those with only one gate per edge of a tree - like support graph .",
    "there is always a gauge transformation that makes every gate amplitude time - symmetric , @xmath51 , thus implying that @xmath4 must itself be probability time - symmetric .    likewise",
    ", analogous to bipartite hamiltonians , any circuit with a bipartite support graph with vanishing diagonal hamiltonian terms @xmath52 is gauge equivalent to its inverse , and thus naturally exhibits pts .        [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     the connection between time - reversal symmetry in circuits and in hamiltonian evolution can be made even stronger : any hamiltonian evolution can be a simulated by a palindromic circuit of the second - order trotter type . for simplicity , consider the hamiltonian evolution @xmath53 with @xmath54 , where @xmath55 , for some directed edge - set  @xmath56 .",
