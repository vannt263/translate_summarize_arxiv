    "thin film structures prepared from low and high temperature superconducting ( htsc ) materials , based on the proximity effect , were widely discussed in literature @xcite , @xcite,@xcite @xcite .",
    "is it possible a proximity coupling to accur between the grains through normal metal inclusions in bulk htsc samples ?",
    "it is difficult to answer to this question having in mind low value and high anysotropy of coherence length ( @xmath2 ) in htsc .",
    "nevertheless there were found some indications for the existence of the proximity effect in bulk samples @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the more frequently used experiments proving the existence of proximity junction like i - v and @xmath3 curves , temperature dependence of normal layer coherence length ( @xmath4 ) or exponential decay of @xmath5 with increasing of the normal layer thickness , l , are not applicable to the case of bulk samples .",
    "the aim of this work is to indicate that the critical current in bulk samples with normal metal inclusions can be governed by the proximity effect .",
    "this is very important from practical point of view because similar conditions can exist in ag - sheathed tapes and wires .",
    "the investigated samples were prepared by the solid state reaction method described in detail previously @xcite .",
    "five samples with different @xmath1 additions ( 2 wt% , 5 wt% , 10 wt% , 15 wt% and 20 wt% ) and one without @xmath1 additions were examined .",
    "the specimens were characterized by x - ray diffraction analysis using dron 4 m powder diffractometer with @xmath6 radiation and scanning electron microscope philips 515 with edx analysis .",
    "temperature dependence of critical current at zero magnetic field was measured in a specially designed device .",
    "the necessary temperature was maintained by thermoregulator within @xmath7 k with an accuracy of @xmath8 k. the appearance of @xmath9 voltage is accepted as a critical current criterion .",
    "the `` screening '' method ( according to @xcite ) was used for the mutual inductance determination .",
    "@xmath10 samples with starting composition 1:2:3 usually contain a small amount of @xmath11 impurity phase @xcite , @xcite .",
    "x - ray diffraction analysis of our undoped samples also detected the presence of @xmath11 .",
    "the impurity phase is not observed for the @xmath1 doped samples .",
    "a very small shift ( less than 0.05 degree ) of the main orthorhombic peaks was observed for the @xmath1 doped samples .",
    "this shift corresponds to the change of @xmath12 lattice parameter from 11.8329 a for undoped sample to 11.8256 a for 20 wt% @xmath1 doped sample .",
    "such deviation , however , can not be due to @xmath1 incorporation in 1:2:3 unit sell because it is shortenning and very small .",
    "@xmath1 is melted during the process of sample synthesis and incorporates significant amount of oxygen .",
    "it is more reasonable to think that the inclusion of this oxygen in 1:2:3 phase is able to produce the observed reduction in @xmath12 lattice parameter .",
    "sem investigations also support the @xmath1 segregation .",
    "edx analysis in the superconducting grains shows nominal compositions close to 1:2:3 stoihiometry and no @xmath1 within detectable limits has been found .",
    "@xmath1 additions are statistically uniformly distributed through the specimen between the grains .",
    "therefore we assume that @xmath1 inclusions do not enter the crystallographic structure of @xmath10 . during the synthesis process",
    "@xmath1 moves out of growing grains and segregates on the grain boundary regions .",
    "similar results were observed for the @xmath1 doped @xmath13 samples @xcite , @xcite and @xmath14 phase @xcite .     for doped and undoped samples different grain boundary conditions exist .",
    "the variations of the grain boundary content significantly influences the critical current of the samples .",
    "grain boundaries of undoped samples mainly contain the insulating impurity phase .",
    "it is reasonable to expect that current path occurs through the superconductor  insulator  supeconductor ( s - i - s ) system . in doped samples , with the increasing of the @xmath1 content , the current flows predominantly through the @xmath1 coupled grains .",
    "these samples can be considered as a superconductor  normal metal  superconductor ( s - n - s ) system on the level of individual grains . in case of individual junction",
    "the @xmath15 dependence over temperature range below @xmath16 provides a clear inside into the nature of the junction .",
    "this dependence can be used to distinguish @xmath17 devices from other junction types .   in our samples",
    "we have normal metal barriers with different thickness and electron mean free path is not limited from the thickness of the normal interlayer as in the thin film structures .",
    "the average dimension of the @xmath1 particles determined from the width of the @xmath1 x - ray diffraction pick is of order of 30 nm for the sample with 20 wt% .",
    "the normal metal coherent length @xmath4 determines the mean size of the cooper pair in the normal metal barier .",
    "assuming that the carrier mean free path @xmath18 in the normal metal is determined from the dimensions of the @xmath1 particles both limits : `` clean '' ( @xmath19 ) and `` dirty '' ( @xmath20 ) will be present at nitrogen temperatures in our unusual for the proximity studies samples .",
    "but only @xmath17 junctions in `` dirty '' limit will support the transport current fascilitating the grains connection in the specimens .",
    "in fact normal metal thickness , l , has to be of order of @xmath4 for achieving a intergranular current close to intragranular one . by decreasing the temperature , t",
    ", normal metal cocherence length will increase according to the relation @xcite : @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the fermi velocity of normal metal and @xmath23 is the boltzman constant . at nitrogen temperatures @xmath4 will be about 15 nm and will increase up to 66 nm at 4 k for @xmath18 equal to the average partical size of @xmath1 .",
    "some of the @xmath17 transitions being in `` clean '' limit at nitrogen temperature will turn to `` dirty '' limit at lower temperatures .",
    "this will increase to some extent the number of @xmath17 connections able to support high intergranular current .",
    "the systematic theoretical investigation of the behavior of @xmath17 thin film structures was carried out first by de gennes@xcite .",
    "an expression has been derived for @xmath5 as a function of temperature t and l : @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the superconducting gap of the normal interlayer interface , @xmath26 is the cross section of the individual @xmath17 transition , @xmath27 is the normal layer resistance , @xmath16 is the superconductor transition temperature and @xmath28 is the electron charge .",
    "( [ eq : jctl ] ) was derived using dirty limit ( @xmath20 ) boundary conditions .",
    "following delin at all @xcite for an @xmath17 structure prepared from a high @xmath16 superconductor and a noble metal as interlayer , @xmath29 will have the form : @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the superconductor energy gap far from the interface region and @xmath32 is the so called interface parameter .",
    "the value of @xmath32 is given by the ratio @xmath33 where @xmath34 and @xmath35 are the normal metal and superconductor density of states , respectively , and @xmath36 and @xmath37 are their resistivities , respectively . for high  @xmath16 superconductor  noble metal ( @xmath1 ) junction @xmath38 ( @xmath39 and for ybco @xmath40 ) and @xmath41 ( @xmath42 and for ybco @xmath43 at 77k ) therefore @xmath44 ( @xmath45 ) .",
    "substituting eq.([eq : xx ] ) and eq.([eq : delta ] ) in eq.([eq : jctl ] ) and assuming a bcs temperature dependence of the energy gap @xmath46 in the htsc material : @xmath47 an useful expression for @xmath48 is obtained : @xmath49.\\ ] ] eq.([eq : jctl1 ] ) present the temperature dependence of the critical current across the @xmath17 structure .",
    "we will use this equation to explain our experimental results . dividing both sides of eq.([eq : jctl1 ] ) by the sample cross section , in the left side we obtain the critical current density through the sample .",
    "it is seen that temperature dependence of the critical current density is following : @xmath50 the term @xmath51 will dominate this dependence because the exponential and @xmath52 terms have a weak influence .",
    "this is shown in the fig.1 .",
    "it present @xmath53 experimental dependencies for the @xmath1 doped samples .",
    "the experimental data for sample with 20 wt% @xmath1 are fitted twice : fit 1 - by the @xmath51 term only , and fit 2 - by the temperature dependence according to ( [ eq : jt ] ) .",
    "both fits show very close results which give us reason to use the simple one ignoring in fact @xmath54 .",
    "it was found also that the quadratic fit ( straight lines ) gives the least mean square deviation from the data for 5 to 20 wt% @xmath1 doped samples , when the fits of type @xmath55 with @xmath56 were examined .   for the sample with 2 wt% @xmath1 experimental results",
    "can be fitted better with linear temperature dependence .",
    "the quadratic fit is also possible . at this concentration",
    "it is difficult to create the current path entirely through the @xmath1 connected grains .",
    "more frequently the connection occurs through the insulating phase and this dependence resembles @xmath57 vs. @xmath58 for undoped samples . for the comparison , on the fig.2 @xmath57 vs. @xmath58 is presented for undoped sample .",
    "the line gives the best linear fit to the data .",
    "the temperature dependence of current across the @xmath59 jousephson junction is described by the ambegaokar - baratoff dependence @xcite . for values @xmath60 but close to @xmath16 a linear temperature dependence occurs . by lowering the temperature the current reachs the saturation .",
    "in fact @xmath1 additions change the mechanism of current flow on the basis of the proximity effect and its value increased .     in the fig.3 @xmath61 vs. @xmath62 plots",
    "are shown for @xmath1 doped samples .",
    "it is seen that with increasing of the @xmath1 content the slopes of the lines increase and a tendency to a saturation can be noticed too . according to eq.([eq",
    ": jctl1 ] ) @xmath26 and @xmath63 quantities can be influenced by the @xmath1 amount .",
    "for our samples @xmath26 has a meaning of an effective cross section . with increasing of the @xmath1 amount both quantites @xmath26 and @xmath63 could increase too . at small @xmath1 concentrations the firs one prevails raising the value of critical current density in the sample . at higher concentration @xmath26",
    "goes to a saturation and @xmath63  increasing begins to dominate , lowering the probability for the proximity connection between the grains .",
    "this leads first to a saturation and then to a current decreasing when @xmath64 .",
    "this can serve as a basis of explanation of the observed saturation tendency in our case and the lowering of the critical current density reported by some authors @xcite , @xcite , @xcite when the @xmath1 additions come nearer to some critical concentration .",
    "this concentration is technologically dependent .   in the fig.4",
    "normalyzed mutual inductance is presented as a function of temperature for the non doped sample and sample with 20 wt% @xmath1 additions .",
    "it is seen that in wide temperature interval below @xmath16 the sample with @xmath1 has a lower mutual inductance than non doped . as the mutual inductance is proportional to the density of superconducting electrons , @xmath65@xcite .",
    "it is lowered in the sample with @xmath1 due to the lowering of @xmath65 in normal metal inclusions .",
    "@xmath1 particles with different thickness @xmath63 exsit in the sample . by lowering the temperature below @xmath16",
    ", they will be able to connect superconducting grains when their thickness @xmath63 becomes of order of @xmath4 according to eq.([eq : xx ] ) .",
    "these investigations are important from the point of view of practical applications of htsc materials in wires and tapes .",
    "for example the `` powder in tube '' method , which is widely used for tapes preparation , ensure the existence of htsc materials / silver interface . during the heat treatment process of the tape preparation ,",
    "@xmath1 diffusion between the superconducting grains on the interface region is possible .",
    "investigations of transport current distributions in @xmath1 sheathed @xmath14 based tapes showed that high current densities are observed in a thin layer ( @xmath66 width ) located close to the silver , which is roughly 10 - 15 % of the total superconducting area @xcite . therefore , when the preparation technology ensures the formation of @xmath1 particles with dimensions of order of @xmath4 , the current path through the specimens will be determined by the proximity effect .",
    "grain boundaries containing normal metal with various thickness can exist in doped samples .",
    "the current path , however , will be through the boundaries with the thickness of order of @xmath4 .   in conclusion",
    "we investigate bulk 1:2:3 htsc material with normal metal ( @xmath1 ) inclusions with an average dimension of order of @xmath4 .",
    "it was shown that the current path in these samples is based on the proximity coupling between the grains .",
    "we establish that @xmath53 dependence below @xmath16 is quadratic which is typical for @xmath17 structures .",
    "mutual inductance measurements also support this type of intergranular current . by using the theory developed for thin film structures we analyze the experimental results for the samples with different @xmath1 amount .",
    "when the @xmath1 additions increased the number of proximity coupled grains and normal metal thickness increased , too .",
    "if the first one dominates the critical current in the sample will increase , while the domination of the second leads to a saturation or current decreasing when @xmath64 .",
    "the value of the current through connected in series @xmath17 transitions is limited by the grains with the smallest cross section , a , and the largest thickness , l.",
