    "clusters of heterogeneous materials show a much richer behavior than their homogeneous counterparts . in many bulk compounds ,",
    "doping can significantly affect some global property , and alloying is a common way to tailor a completely new kind of material . at the mesoscale level",
    ", size is another complicating factor , giving rise to further changes with respect to the macroscopic object . to a large extent , most expectations of nanotechnology have been put into the electronic and catalytic properties of small atomic clusters .",
    "therefore , it should not be surprising that numerous theoretical studies of mixed clusters were devoted to bimetallic clusters .",
    "in particular , there has been a significant amount of work at the level of sophisticated electronic structure calculations,@xcite but these were often limited to small sizes due to the numerical effort involved . on a different scale of chemical complexity , many studies have been carried out using explicit , empirical force fields in order to investigate the segregation properties of these clusters .",
    "there are several driving forces toward mixing or segregation in binary systems :    * the difference in atomic sizes ; * the difference in surface energies ; * minimization of the overall strain ; * the number of interactions between unlike atoms .",
    "these factors can often compete with each other .",
    "for instance , minimizing surface energies does usually not increase with the number of interactions between different atoms .",
    "also , even though this is not our prime interest here , it should be noted that kinetic factors can be crucial in this problem.@xcite    in particular , vach and coworkers have found from experiments and simulations of mixed rare - gas clusters that some anomalous enrichment effects could be observed due to the growth by pick - up of these systems.@xcite very recently , radial segregation and layering have been observed in large ar / xe clusters formed in an adiabatic expansion by tchaplyguine _",
    "et al._@xcite using photoelectron spectroscopy measurements .",
    "these data have also been theoretically interpreted by amar and smaby.@xcite    fortunately , mixed rare - gas systems can be quite safely described using simple pairwise potentials such as the lennard - jones ( lj ) potential .",
    "more accurate potentials are of course also available , even though we will have no need for them in the present , mostly methodological work .",
    "hence they are much more convenient to study in a broad size range , not only for their structure but also their dynamics or thermodynamics .",
    "it is known from previous studies that the topography of the potential energy surfaces of homogeneous lj clusters can be very peculiar , as for the sizes 38 or 75.@xcite the multiple - funnel structure of these energy landscapes makes it especially hard to locate the most stable structures ( global minima ) or to simulate the finite - temperature behavior of these clusters in an ergodic way .",
    "the effects of mixing different rare - gas atoms on cluster structure and thermodynamics have been studied for the specific size 13 by frantz on the examples of ar ",
    "kr mixtures@xcite as well as ne ",

    "have also investigated these latter compounds.@xcite a systematic work of ar  xe mixed clusters of 13 and 19 atoms has been carried out by munro and coworkers,@xcite including some global optimization and monte carlo simulations .",
    "mixed clusters involving lighter species such as h@xmath1 and d@xmath1 have been investigated using path - integral monte carlo simulations ( pimc ) by chakravarty.@xcite more recently , sabo , doll and freeman reported a rather complete study of the energy landscapes@xciteand melting phase change@xcite in mixed ar  ne clusters . in this work quantum delocalization and",
    "the effects of impurities on cluster properties were also accounted for using pimc techniques .",
    "the main conclusion of these studies is that atomic heterogeneity can be responsible for a drastic increase in complexity of the energy landscapes of rare - gas clusters .",
    "this complexity is manifested by numerous new low - lying minima in competitive funnels , characterized by the same overall geometrical arrangement but different permutations of unlike atoms .",
    "following jellinek and krissinel,@xcite we will refer to such isomers as `` homotops . ''",
    "the presence of several homotops on a given energy landscape often induces solid - solid transitions , which can be detected by some feature in the heat capacity,@xcite even though they can be washed out by quantum effects.@xcite as shown by munro _",
    "et al._,@xcite the various funnels corresponding to different homotops of a same geometry are separated by significant energy barriers .",
    "this explains the difficulty or even failure of simulation methods to achieve ergodic sampling of these systems , albeit small.@xcite a similar situation is found in lennard - jones polymers,@xcite where a large number of isomers are based on the same geometrical arrangement , differing only in the path linking the monomers .    beyond the actual rare - gases , binary lennard - jones compounds",
    "have been investigated in both the cluster and bulk regimes .",
    "clarke and coworkers looked at phase separation of small particles with equal compositions.@xcite based on monte carlo simulations , they sketched a phase diagram in the general structure of liquid clusters .",
    "bulk binary lennard - jones systems have been seen to provide relatively simple numerical models for glass formation.@xcite most often , the lj interactions in such studies have been tuned in a non - additive way in order to hinder crystallisation . in another related work , lee and coworkers@xcite",
    "have investigated the role of atomic size ratio in binary and ternary metallic alloys .",
    "interestingly , severaly links between the physics and chemistry of clusters and those of supercooled liquids and glasses have been established since the pioneering work by frank.@xcite the initial suggestion that the local order in simple liquids is not crystalline but icosahedral@xcite ( more generally polytetrahedral ) has since been verified experimentally@xcite and theoretically.@xcite from the clusters viewpoint , the favored finite - size structures of good model glassformers have been shown by doye and coworkers to be polytetrahedral.@xcite    the 38-atom homogeneous lennard - jones cluster is known to show some glassy properties , especially slow relaxation to the ground state,@xcite due to the competition between two stable funnels on the energy landscape , corresponding to truncated octahedral and icosahedral shapes , respectively . due to entropic effects,@xcite a solid - solid transition occurs between the two funnels , at temperatures lower than the melting point .",
    "the crystal - like configuration of this cluster makes it a good candidate to further investigate the relationship between cluster structure and criteria for glassification .    because homogeneous lj@xmath0 constitutes a relatively difficult task for global optimization algorithms , binary clusters of the same size",
    "can be expected to be much worse . in this paper",
    ", we propose a simple but efficient way to deal with the multiple new minima introduced by unlike atoms within a general monte carlo global minimization scheme .",
    "this algorithm will then be applied to the 38- and 55-atom cases , in mixtures of xe with either ar or kr atoms . in the next section ,",
    "we present the method and test it on the simple cases of the 13- and 19-atom clusters . in sec .",
    "[ sec : res ] we give our results obtained at sizes 38 and 55 and we correlate them to the different glassforming abilities of the bulk mixtures .",

    "global optimization of cluster structure@xcite is currently best achieved using either genetic algorithms@xcite or the monte carlo+minimization method,@xcite also known as basin - hopping ( bh).@xcite the case of homogeneous lennard - jones clusters is among the most documented of cluster physics , and an up - to - date table of putative global minima can be found in ref .  .",
    "even though it can never be guaranteed that global minimization has been successful , it is likely that all important structural forms of lj clusters have been found up to more than 100 atoms .",
    "these include icosahedral , truncated octahedral , decahedral as well as tetrahedral arrangements .    compared to homogeneous clusters ,",
    "the available data on heterogeneous systems is rather scarce . besides the specific works by frantz on the 13-atom ne  ar and kr  ar clusters,@xcite munro _ et al .",
    "_ used a parallel version of the bh scheme , similar to the replica - exchange monte carlo method,@xcite where several trajectories are run simultaneously at various temperatures.@xcite although these authors looked at moderately large clusters , they reported significant difficulties to locate global minima at specific compositions , as in xe@xmath2ar@xmath3 or xe@xmath4ar@xmath5 , for instance.@xcite      a natural problem occuring using the basin - hopping method is that many of the low - lying minima are expected to be related to each other via particle exchange .",
    "such a process only occurs via large deformations of the remaining cluster , hence it is quite unprobable . as in condensed matter",
    "physics,@xcite allowing exchange moves between particles as a possible monte carlo step may result in notably faster convergence , provided that the interactions are not too dissimilar .",
    "actually , optimization of mixed clusters on the lattice formed by the homogeneous system has already been studied by robertson and coworkers.@xcite here we do not wish to restrict to such situations .    in the framework of global optimization methods ,",
    "the local minimization stage removes the possible energetic penalty associated to replacing a small atom by a bigger one .",
    "we can thus expect some increased efficiency of the algorithm in case of multiple homotops .",
    "now we convert the extra numerical cost of running parallel trajectories at various temperatures into running them at various compositions , at the same fixed temperature @xmath6 for all compositions . for a x@xmath7y@xmath8 compound ,",
    "each of the @xmath9 trajectories is then labelled with the number @xmath10 of x atoms , running from 0 to @xmath9 .",
    "exchange moves between adjacent trajectories ( from @xmath10 to @xmath11 ) thus need to incorporate the transmutation of two atoms ( one for each configuration ) into the other atom type to preserve composition . as in most monte carlo processes , the probability of attempting such moves",
    "must be set in advance as a parameter .",
    "the global optimization algorithm can thus be summarized into its main steps . keeping the above notations for atom types , and denoting @xmath12 the configuration at step @xmath13 of trajectory @xmath10 , we start the optimization process using fully random configurations , but locally optimized .    1 .   with probability @xmath14",
    ", it is decided whether an exchange between adjacent trajectories will be attempted or not .",
    "if so , then the two trajectories involved in the exchange are determined randomly .",
    "2 .   for each composition",
    "@xmath10 not concerned by any exchange , a new configuration @xmath15 is generated from @xmath16 using either several particle exchanges or large atomic moves .",
    "the probability to select particle exchanges is denoted @xmath17 , and the number of simultaneous exchanges is allowed to fluctuate randomly between 1 and @xmath18 . if atomic moves are selected , then each atom is displaced randomly around its previous location in the three directions by a random amount of maximum magnitude @xmath19 . in both cases , @xmath20 is obtained after local minimization .",
    "3 .   in case of an exchange between adjacent trajectories , the two configurations @xmath12 and",
    "@xmath21 corresponding to these trajectories are then swapped , one x atom of @xmath12 being transmuted into y , and one y atom of @xmath21 being transmuted into x. again , the configurations @xmath15 and @xmath22 are obtained after local minimization .",
    "each new configuration is accepted with the usual metropolis acceptance probability at temperature @xmath6 .",
    "the algorithm has two main parameters , namely @xmath14 and @xmath17 .",
    "the maximum number of particle exchange moves , @xmath23 , was set to 4 in this study .",
    "we expect that better results could be obtained by adjusting this parameter appropriately , probably taking higher values for larger clusters or for compostitions close to 50% .",
    "the amplitude of atomic displacement , @xmath19 , is set to half the equilibrium distance in the x@xmath1 dimer for @xmath24 , half the equilibrium distance in the y@xmath1 dimer for @xmath25 , and is interpolated linearly between these two values for @xmath26 . in the present work , the exchange probabilities were taken as @xmath27 and @xmath28 , hence allowing a rather large probability of sampling among homotops of a same structure .",
    "low - energy structures for mixtures of xenon with either argon or krypton atoms have been first investigated for the sizes @xmath29 and @xmath30 , as there are quantitative global optimization data available for ar  xe clusters from the jordan group.@xcite we have adjusted the lj values used by leitner _ et al._@xcite to reproduce the clusters energies found by munro and coworkers.@xcite . with respect to argon , the present data for @xmath31 and @xmath32 are thus @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 , and @xmath40 .",

    "[ fig : structex ] is perticularly informative : xe atoms are located scarcely among the icosahedral cluster , and relieve the structure from too much strain at the expense of only few xe  xe interactions . in this case , cluster structure is driven by the number of unlike interactions .",
    "it is also worth noting that a few compositions are especially weakly strained ; this occurs when the global minimum is octahedral , but also in the range @xmath85 . for these latter clusters , the core / surface segregation and the number of unlike interactions are both optimal .",

    "the strain reduction produced by size disparity in 38-atom ar ",
    "xe clusters helps in stabilizing these kinds of structures , which are otherwise replaced by multilayer ( or mackay ) geometries in the homogeneous clusters .",

    "the transition between homotops usually occurs prior to melting .",
    "thermal equilibrium within the cubic funnels thus involves several homotops ( and `` restricted '' solid - solid transitions ) , and the corresponding thermodynamical state could be probably simulated using specifically designed exchange moves between outer particles within a monte carlo scheme .",
    "a few clusters melt before exhibiting any transition between homotops .",
    "this occurs for instance at @xmath119 , 13 or 15 .",

    "on the other hand , kr  xe clusters at the same sizes further favor cubic order .",

    ", we have used the bond order parameter @xmath130 introduced by steinhardt and coworkers.@xcite the two parameters @xmath129 and @xmath130 allow us to follow in monte carlo time the cooling processes for all materials in a simultaneous way , independently of thermodynamical characteristics such as the melting temperature .    the correlation between @xmath129 and @xmath130 for ten cooling simulations of each of the three bulk binary compounds is represented in fig .",

    "tests on simple ar@xmath42xe@xmath43 and ar@xmath42xe@xmath51 clusters show that the method is quite efficient , in addition to being easy to implement . for these systems",
    ", we have found that the choice of a very low temperature works best as it allows some significant time to be spent for optimizing the search for homotops on a same common lattice .",
    "putative global minima for ar@xmath63xe@xmath42 and kr@xmath63xe@xmath42 clusters have been investigated for all compositions .",
    "the structure of ar  xe compounds is mainly polytetrahedral , except at very low doping rates .",

    "we see some significant trend toward core / surface phase separation in ar ",
    "xe clusters with @xmath138 and in all kr  xe clusters .",
    "however , these demixing behaviors are not due to the same factors , as xe atoms favor outer sites to reduce strain in ar  xe icosahedra , while they occupy interior sites to maximize the number of bonds in kr  xe truncated octahedra .",
    "conversely , ar@xmath63xe@xmath42 clusters with @xmath83 exhibit a higher degree of mixing . analysing",
    "the strain in these stable structures confirms the presence of a structural transition near @xmath139 in these systems .",
    "polytetrahedral morphologies were also found as the most stable structures of many mixed ar  xe clusters with 55 atoms , as soon as the relative number of xe atoms was large enough .",
    "the general conclusion thus seems that the extra strain introduced by mixing these different elements penalizes the highly ordered ( cubic or 2-layer icosahedron ) structures .    within the harmonic superposition approximation",

    "this mainly reflects the special stability of the octahedral structures , and has the probable consequence that actual melting points increase somewhat .",
    "these predictions could probably be checked with numerical simulations . for most compositions ,",
    "the transitions between different homotops of the truncated octahedron are seen to be potentially induced by relatively small temperatures .",
    "therefore particle exchange moves will be necessary in order that simulations remain close to ergodic .",
    "following previous results by other researchers,@xcite we have found some further evidence that criteria for glass formation in bulk materials may also lie in the parameters , which are responsible for stable cluster structures . since the atomistic simulation of the dynamical vitrification process can generally be much harder than obtaining stable configurations of atomic clusters , we expect the approach followed in the present theoretical effort to be also useful in the community of glasses and supercooled liquids .",

    "<S> tests on the 13- and 19- atom clusters show a significant improvement over the conventional basin - hopping method , the average search length being reduced by more than one order of magnitude . </S>",
    "<S> the method is applied to the more difficult case of the 38-atom cluster , for which the homogeneous clusters have a truncated octahedral shape . </S>",
    "<S> it is found that alloys of dissimilar elements ( ar  xe ) favor polytetrahedral geometries over octahedra due to the reduced strain penalty . </S>",
    "<S> conversely , octahedra are even more stable in kr </S>",
    "<S>  xe alloys than in kr@xmath0 or xe@xmath0 , and they show a core - surface phase separation behavior . </S>",
    "<S> these trends are indeed also observed and further analysed on the 55-atom cluster . finally , we correlate the relative stability of cubic structures in these clusters to the glassforming character of the bulk mixtures . </S>"
