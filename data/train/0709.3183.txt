    "this paper considers a model for phase change materials , i.e. alloys that can undergo reversible phase changes in response to anneals .",
    "possible modelling techniques for polycrystalline processes in reversible phase - change alloys such as gst ( @xmath4 ) range from molecular dynamic simulations at one end of the spectrum to empirical models at the other .",
    "the former are thermodynamically realistic but highly computer - intensive ; the latter are fast , but hard to relate to material properties .",
    "hence models used in practise tend to lie somewhere between the two , for example , monte carlo simulations @xcite , jmak and master equation based models @xcite or probabilistic cellular automata .",
    "we describe the material as a 2d lattice of discrete ` sites ' where each site is either crystalline or amorphous and there is an underlying orientation that varies continuously ; these sites are on the lengthscale of monomers , though they do not correspond directly to individual monomers . as such our method for generating complex anneals , combines elements of probabilistic cellular automata ( pca ) models , polycrystalline phase field models @xcite and uses thermodynamics from master equation models @xcite . as we use a gillespie algorithm for time - stepping we refer to it as a ` phase field gillespie ' model .",
    "in particular we retain a high level of simplicity because of discrete time and lattice space model , while retaining thermodynamic realism and hence keep fitting parameters to a minimum .",
    "recall that crystallisation can be thought of as a two - stage process ; nucleation ( where a small crystallite needs to overcome an energy barrier dominated by interfacial energy ) and growth ( where the crystallite grows according to the availability of neighboring monomers and dominated by bulk energy ) .",
    "we assume each site has a set of locally - determined rate constants for transitions into a new state .",
    "these rates depend only on the current state of the site and that of its immediate neighbours . for the rates of growth and dissociation for gst we use thermodynamics from @xcite .",
    "the gillespie algorithm @xcite can be used to simulate the evolution under the assumption that the events are independent , instantaneous and never simultaneous .",
    "each step of the algorithm has two parts ; firstly it determines a random time to next event and secondly it determines which event occurs .",
    "this enables one to perform fast and physically plausible simulations of a number of crystallisation - related phenomena , including incomplete crystallisation , melting and complex spatio - temporal anneals .",
    "as there are many possible events , one must efficiently use data - structures to ensure that the simulations run at a high speed and hence perform simulation of complex anneals in 2d on a standard desktop computer .",
    "after the algorithm for the phase field gillespie simulator is described in section  [ secpfg ] , section  [ secresults ] presents the results of some bulk anneals of gst using this simulator , showing that the simulator can model nucleation effects , non - trivial anneals and melting .",
    "we include examples where the temperature depends on space and/or time ; one can see a variety of effects and a good quantitative agreement with experimental temperature - dependent incubation times for gst .",
    "finally section  [ secdiscuss ] discusses some possible extensions and limitations of the method .",
    "we consider a homogeneous ( though not necessarily isotropic ) material in 2d . the state of the material is described on a discrete regular lattice of grid points @xmath5 on the length scale of the individual monomers .",
    "each site is assumed to be either ` crystalline ' or ` amorphous ' .",
    "more precisely , at each grid point , @xmath6 , the state is described by two quantities :    * @xmath7  a discrete ` phase ' variable that is either @xmath8 ( amorphous ) or @xmath2 ( crystalline ) . *",
    "@xmath9  a continuous ` orientation ' variable that varies over some range @xmath10 and gives a notional representation for the local orientation of the material .",
    "in particular we can determine that two adjacent crystalline sites are within the same crystal if and only if @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "the model we describe is a stochastic model that estimates rates of possible local changes to the state of the system ( i.e. changes that affect only one site ) and uses a gillespie algorithm @xcite to evolve the system in time .",
    "a gillespie algorithm is optimal in that it will generate timesteps at a rate corresponding to the fastest rate that requires updating , though it is typically more complex to implement than monte carlo simulations @xcite .",
    "although there are adaptations of the algorithm to other contexts @xcite we use the original version of gillespie .",
    "we consider the following possible instantaneous events at a site @xmath13 :    * * nucleation *  the site @xmath14 and an adjacent site , originally both amorphous , become a crystallite at a rate @xmath15 .",
    "* * growth *  the site @xmath14 , originally amorphous , becomes attached to an adjacent crystal of orientation @xmath16 at a rate @xmath17 . * * dissociation *  the site @xmath14 , originally crystalline , detaches or dissociates from the crystal of which it is a part to become amorphous at a rate @xmath18 , and assumes a random orientation .",
    "we approximate the rate coefficients for nucleation , growth and dissociation ( @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 ) at each grid point by considering the change in bulk and surface energies of crystallites adjacent to that site .",
    "we define the set of neighbours of @xmath13 @xmath22 the set of amorphous neighbours of @xmath14 @xmath23 and finally the set of crystalline neighbours of @xmath14 with a given orientation @xmath16",
    "@xmath24 note that @xmath25 .",
    "the rates are considered in a similar way to the derivation of master equation rates as in @xcite and outlined below .",
    "we assume that ` interactions ' between neighbours occur at a temperature - dependent rate @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the activation energy and @xmath28 is the boltzmann constant .",
    "the prefactor @xmath29 is used as a fitting parameter to normalise the results ; see @xcite .",
    "if adjacent sites have an ` interaction ' we define @xmath30 we assume local thermal equilibrium , meaning that the rate of the reverse transformation at an interaction is @xmath31 .",
    "this rate varies with temperature as the bulk and surface energy vary .",
    "we compute the change in surface area of the crystallites on adding site @xmath14 to a neighbouring crystal of orientation @xmath16 by a linear approximation @xmath32\\ ] ] where @xmath33 is the surface area of a single site .",
    "this means that changing an isolated site in the middle of a crystal of orientation @xmath16 will result in a change @xmath34 ( as @xmath35 ) , while creating a new crystal in the middle of a field of amorphous material will result in a change @xmath36 ( as @xmath37 ) .",
    "putting this together ( and noting that only by interaction with amorphous neighbours can a site nucleate ) we get rate for nucleation that is @xmath38 the growth rate for an amorphous site to join a crystalline neighbour with orientation @xmath16 is : @xmath39 finally , the dissociation rate for a crystalline site to become amorphous is : @xmath40      we now detail the operation of the pfg algorithm using the rates above .",
    "initially , the whole domain is assumed to be an ` as deposited ' amorphous state with a random distribution of @xmath9 values and @xmath41 , though one can restart the algorithm from any given state .    for a square lattice we use eight neighbors , @xmath42 , weighted according to their distance from the site .",
    "the new state of the site is then given by @xmath43 and @xmath44 , using the stochastic simulation algorithm of gillespie @xcite as follows .",
    "this simulates up to a time @xmath45 .    1 .",
    "start at time @xmath46 with given @xmath7 and @xmath9 .",
    "2 .   generate rate coefficients for all grid points @xmath47 @xmath48 @xmath49 for nucleation , growth and dissociation respectively .",
    "we refer to these using a single index @xmath50 where @xmath51 .",
    "3 .   compute the sum @xmath52 + \\sum c^{\\rm di}_{ij}\\ ] ] where @xmath53 is the set of orientations of neighbours to @xmath14 .",
    "4 .   generate two independent random numbers @xmath54 uniformly distributed on @xmath55 and compute @xmath56 increment time to @xmath57 . if @xmath58 then * stop*. 5 .",
    "identify the event @xmath50 corresponding to @xmath14 , @xmath59 and @xmath60 with @xmath61 such that @xmath62 6 .",
    "update the value of @xmath9 and @xmath7 . more precisely ,",
    "perform the following updates according to corresponding reactions ( nucleation , growth or dissociation ) that occur : 1 .",
    "* nucleation * at @xmath14 ; pick a @xmath63 at random and set @xmath64 2 .",
    "* growth from neighboring crystal * with @xmath65 into the amorphous site @xmath14 ; set @xmath66 3 .   * dissociation * at @xmath14 ; set @xmath67 where @xmath68 is an independent random number uniformly distributed in the range of possible orientations @xmath10 . 7 .",
    "for the next iteration , copy @xmath69 and @xmath70 and update the values of @xmath47 @xmath48 @xmath49 .",
    "return to step 3 and recompute @xmath71 .",
    "note that the main computational effort is the selection of the event ( step 5 ) based on @xmath72 ; to minimize the number of operations needed to determine this we use a recursive bisection search and an efficient sorting of possible events .",
    "also in the recomputation of rates ( step 7 ) one can limit the updates to those sites that have changed and their neighbours .",
    "finally , the computation of @xmath73 ( step 3 ) in subsequent steps can considerably be accelerated by using only addition and subtraction of those rates that have changed .",
    "for the remainder of this paper we model the phase change material gst used for read / write optical and electrical data storage devices , as in @xcite .",
    "such a material has a fine balance between bulk and surface energies of crystals , meaning that one can find non - trivial nucleation and growth dynamics that varies with @xmath74 .",
    "let @xmath75 be the melting temperature ; if we assume that the free energy change associated with crystallisation of a single site varies linearly with @xmath76 and the energy change associated with change in surface @xmath77 is @xmath78 with @xmath79 constant , then the rate @xmath80 can be written as @xmath81.\\ ] ] following @xcite , we assume that @xmath82 where constants are @xmath83 , the interfacial energy density between amorphous and crystalline phases @xmath84 the molecular surface area of the material .",
    "we use @xmath85 and @xmath86 where we use time units of microseconds for convenience .",
    "the other constants are as follows :    * @xmath87 is the enthalpy of fusion from the data obtained from differential scanning calorimeter experiments on gst .",
    "* @xmath88 is the molecular volume of gst and @xmath89 assuming approximately spherical shape .",
    "* @xmath90=@xmath91 is the melting temperature * @xmath92 is boltzmann s constant .    using these values",
    "we obtain @xmath93 . in our simulations",
    "we assume we have @xmath94 sites with periodic boundary conditions applied in both directions ; i.e. @xmath95 .",
    "the parameters for the phase field gillespie algorithm outlined above give realistic quantitative agreement with crystal growth in gst over a range of temperatures .",
    "we simulate using an @xmath94 grid with @xmath96 .",
    "note that the crystalline fraction @xmath97 for such a grid can be calculated as @xmath98 where clearly @xmath99 and @xmath100 corresponds to a fully crystalline state .",
    "we show in figure  [ fig_anneal1 ] the increase in the crystalline fraction @xmath97 as a function of time starting at fully amorphous for @xmath101 ; after an initial incubation the fraction quickly increases to saturate near @xmath100 .",
    "the insets show that the growth occurs subject to random fluctuations from the algorithm .",
    "near @xmath100 there is still a nontrivial process of detachment and reattachment of sites from crystals that leads to grain coarsening over a long timescale .",
    "figure  [ fig_ims_131c ] shows the progress of this anneal at three stages ; soon after inception , at approximately 20% progress and in a polycrystalline state , while figure  [ fig_freqs ] shows the development of the distribution of crystal sizes as the anneal progresses .",
    "the incubation time ( defined here as the time to 20% crystallinity from fully amorphous ) is shown against temperature in figure  [ fig_incubation ] and for comparison the results from data from experiments @xcite as well as for the master equation model @xcite are plotted .",
    "we note that the phase field gillespie simulations show a temperature dependence that is close to experimental results of @xcite both in form and value . as with the master equation model",
    ", there is effectively only one fitting parameter in the model , the prefactor @xmath29 and this is fixed independent of temperature .",
    "one can easily adapt the algorithm to the case where the temperature , and therefore the rates of the reactions , depends on the spatial location ; the algorithm is exactly as presented before except that @xmath74 now depends @xmath102 on site and time .",
    "as an example , in figure  [ fig_spatial ] shows the development of a band of gst material that is held at @xmath103 on the left boundary and @xmath104 on the right boundary for a period of time . on the left hand side",
    "the growth is very slow while on the right the nucleation energy is more difficult to overcome , meaning that initial growth is fastest in the intermediate region .",
    "a final example is given in figure  [ fig_spatio - temporal ] where a sample is subjected to a complex sequence of spatio - temporal anneals ; see caption for details .",
    "the phase field gillespie algorithm introduced in the paper incorporates features from a few different models of crystallisation , and can be thought of as a thermodynamically motivated caricature of a molecular simulation .",
    "we highlight a few features that could be investigated to make more physically realistic models :    * the current model is based on a 2d grid meaning that the interpretation of the volume and surface area of the monomers at each site should depend on interfacial energies , or alternatively this could be adapted to a 3d grid with suitable boundary conditions .",
    "* we assume the energies of the crystallites do not depend on orientation .",
    "it would be relatively easy to include anisotropy , meaning that crystallites should grow depending on their orientation .",
    "* we have so far only considered the behavior of the crystallisation by imposing a temperature that may be uniform , or may have spatial non - uniformities .",
    "it would be of interest to investigate the coupling of this to phase , for example as occurs in electrical heating of gst . in this case",
    "onset of percolation results in lower resistance and hence increase heating .",
    "nonetheless the current model can evidently produce reasonably realistic and numerically efficient simulations of crystallisation behaviour even for complex spatio - temporal anneals and as such we believe the model is worthy of further investigation .",
    "we also suggest that these techniques will be useful for modelling phase change devices that use reversible transitions in gst alloys to perform computations and for multi - state storage @xcite .",
