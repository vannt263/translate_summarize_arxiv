    "in quantum mechanics two non - commuting observables can not be simultaneously measured with arbitrary precision .",
    "that is , there is an irreducible lower bound on the uncertainty in the result of a simultaneous measurement of non - commuting observables .",
    "this fact , often called the heisenberg uncertainty principle @xcite .",
    "the uncertainty principle specified for a given pairs of observables finds its mathematical manifestation as the uncertainty relations .",
    "the first rigorous derivation of the uncertainty relation from the quantum mechanical formalism applied for the basic non - commuting observables is due to kennard @xcite .    in accordance with the present understanding",
    "the quantum system is described by a complex function @xmath0 , which is linked with the function of the probability density of finding a particle at the position @xmath1 at the time @xmath2 by the equation @xmath3 .",
    "on the other hand , the corresponding fourier transform @xmath4 is connected with the probability of finding a particle with momentum @xmath5 at the time @xmath2 by the equation @xmath6 .",
    "for the mathematical expression of the uncertainty principle we must more precisely define how to measure the sharpness of the probability density function of an observable . in the mathematical formulation of the uncertainty principle we consider two hermitian operators @xmath7 and @xmath8 which represent physical observables @xmath9 and @xmath10 in a finite @xmath11-dimensional hilbert space .",
    "let @xmath12 and @xmath13 , @xmath14 , be corresponding complete sets of normalized eigenvectors .",
    "the probability distribution of the observables @xmath9 and @xmath10 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 described by the wave - function @xmath17 are given by the equations @xmath18 respectively .",
    "the principle of uncertainty says that if @xmath9 and @xmath10 are non - commuting observables , then their probability distributions can not be both arbitrarily peaked .",
    "in other words , the uncertainty principle states that two complementary observables can not have the same eigenfunctions .    the formulation of the uncertainty principle by means of dispersions of non - commuting observables is usually given in the form of the robertson relation @xcite : @xmath19 \\vert \\psi \\rangle \\vert\\ ] ] where @xmath20 and @xmath21 denote the standard deviation of distributions ( 1 ) : @xmath22^{1/2 } , \\ \\",
    "b= [ \\langle b^{2}\\rangle - \\langle b \\rangle ^{2}]^{1/2}.\\ ] ] it has been pointed by many authors ( see refs .",
    "@xcite ) that the robertson form of uncertainty relation has two serious shortcomings ; ( i ) the right - hand side of eq.(2 ) is not a fixed lower bound , but depends on the state @xmath17 . if the observables @xmath9 and @xmath10 is in its eigenstate then @xmath23 = 0 $ ] and no restriction on @xmath24 or @xmath21 is imposed by the left - hand side of the inequality ( 2 ) .",
    "( ii ) the dispersion may not represent the appropriate measure for the uncertainty of an observables if its probability distribution exhibits some sharp distant peaks .    therefore , to improve on this situation entropic uncertainty relations",
    "have been proposed which rely on the shannon entropy @xcite as a measure of uncertainty",
    ". a much more satisfactory measure of quantum uncertainty is given by the information entropy of given probability distribution .",
    "an entropic uncertainty relation represents the sum of the entropies of two non - commuting observables @xmath9 and @xmath10 @xmath25 where @xmath26 and @xmath27 denote information entropies of observables @xmath9 and @xmath10 , respectively .",
    "the @xmath28 is a positive constant which represent the lower bound of the right - hand side of the inequality of ( 3 ) .",
    "the information uncertainty relation ( 3 ) were first conjectured by everett @xcite in the context of _ many worlds interpretation _ of quantum mechanics and hirschman @xcite in 1957 , and proved by bialynicki - birula and mycielski @xcite , and independently by beckner @xcite .    for the continuous observables for example @xmath1 and @xmath5 which are described by the wave - functions @xmath29 and @xmath30 ,",
    "position space information entropy @xmath31 and momentum space information entropy @xmath32 are defined by @xmath33 @xmath34 respectively .",
    "for position @xmath1 and momentum @xmath5 the inequality ( 3 ) for @xmath11-dimensional hilbert space reads @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the lower bound for the inequality ( 3 ) . for @xmath37 , the entropy sum is bounded from below by the value @xmath38    note that these entropies have been used for numerous practical purposes such as , for example , to measure the squeezing of quantum fluctuation @xcite and to reconstruct the charge and momentum densities of atomic and molecular systems @xcite by means of maximum - entropy procedures .",
    "in present study we deal with position and momentum information entropies of the one - dimensional morse potential as an example , and will discuss whether it satisfy the entropic uncertainty relation ( 6 ) or not .",
    "the morse potential , introduced in the 1930 s @xcite , is one of a class of potential @xcite for which solutions of the schrdinger equation are known .",
    "the morse potential is widely used in the literature as a model for bound states , such as the vibrational states of molecules . for the applications",
    "the potential is defined as a function of the variable @xmath1 which ranges from @xmath39 to @xmath40 , and is given in terms of two parameters @xmath41 and @xmath42 by @xmath43 where @xmath41 is the dissociation energy , @xmath44 corresponds to its depth , and @xmath42 is related to the range of the potential and @xmath1 gives the relative distance from the equilibrium position of the atoms . at the @xmath45",
    ", it has a negative ( attractive ) minimum of depth @xmath41 , and it goes smoothly to zero in the limit of large @xmath1 . for @xmath1 less than @xmath46",
    "this potential becomes positive ( repulsive ) , and as @xmath1 decrease even further , the potential becomes increasingly large .",
    "the solution of the schrdinger equation associated with the potential ( 7 ) is given by @xcite @xmath47 where @xmath48 are associated laguerre functions , the argument @xmath49 is related to the physical displacement coordinate @xmath1 by @xmath50 with @xmath51 , and @xmath11 is normalization constant : @xmath52 and @xmath53 $ ] with @xmath54 $ ] denoting the largest integer smaller than @xmath55 , so that the total number of bound states is @xmath56 $ ] .",
    "we note that the @xmath57 is potential dependent , @xmath58 is related to energy @xmath59 and by definition @xmath60 , @xmath61 .",
    "the parameters @xmath57 and @xmath58 satisfy the constraint condition @xmath62 end they are related to the potential @xmath41 and energy @xmath59 through @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the reduced mass of the molecule .",
    "normalizable states fulfil @xmath65 and the corresponding eigenvalues ( i.e. , energy spectrum ) are given by @xmath66 where @xmath67 .",
    "the position and momentum space information entropies for the one - dimensional potential can be calculated by using eqs.(4 ) and ( 5 ) , respectively .",
    "the analytical derivation of the position and momentum space information entropies for morse potential is quite cumbersome .",
    "however , quite recently position and momentum space information entropies of the morse have been analytically obtained by dehesa et al . for the ground state of the wave - function @xcite .",
    "they also discussed behavior of the ground state entropy for values of the potential parameter @xmath41 .",
    "therefore , the present article is devoted to the numerical study of the information entropies for morse potential take into account the parameters of the wave - function ( 8) .",
    "instead evolution of position and momentum space information entropies , we plot entropy densities @xmath68 and @xmath69 for both position and momentum space , respectively .",
    "the entropy densities @xmath70 and @xmath71 provide a measure of information about localization of the particle in the respective spaces .    in order to demonstrating the entropy distribution in the well , we have plotted position and momentum space entropy densities in figs.1(a)-(d ) and figs.2(a)-(d ) , respectively , for arbitrary @xmath72 and @xmath57 values .",
    "it seems that in the both figures the number of minima and their depths depend on @xmath72 and @xmath57 . however , entropy distributions exhibit interesting behavior , for example , the distribution of the position space entropy density has asymmetric shape as can be seen in figs.1(a)-(d ) , whereas , the distribution of the momentum space entropy density in momentum space are quite symmetric as can be seen in figs.2(a)-(d ) .    in table1",
    "we have presented the numerical results of information entropies @xmath31 , @xmath32 and the entropy sum @xmath73 for arbitrary @xmath72 and @xmath57 .",
    "it is clearly seen from table1 that bbm inequality is satisfied for the morse potential . for all @xmath72 values , as @xmath57 increases",
    ", the entropy sum @xmath73 tends to be saturated to bound value which is defined by bbm inequality .",
    "physically , for increasing @xmath57 , the depth of the potential increases and it increasingly resembles the oscillator potential , which saturates above inequality .",
    "the significance of bbm inequality is that it presents an irreducible lower bound to the entropy sum .",
    "the conjugate position and momentum space information entropies have an inverse relationship with each other .",
    "a strongly localized distribution in the position space corresponds to widely delocalized distribution in the momentum space . with one entropy increasing , the other entropy decreases but only to the extent that their sum stays above the stipulated lower bound of @xmath74 ) .",
