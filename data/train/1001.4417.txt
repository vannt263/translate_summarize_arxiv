    "dynamical processes in networks , such as synchronization , have been attracting much interest @xcite .",
    "a striking characteristic of many networks is that they are often formed from very simple units ( _ e.g. _ a neuron either spikes or is silent , at a certain level of description ) but can collectively exhibit a wide range of dynamics .",
    "a central question is then how dynamically simple units can produce rich collective dynamical behavior when they are coupled together in a network . in this letter",
    "we offer a solution to this question in the context of synchronization of coupled map networks .",
    "previous work on synchronization of coupled maps focused on diffusive coupling with non - negative weights .",
    "however , in diffusively - coupled networks the synchronized network shows the same dynamical behavior as one single isolated unit ; thus , no new collective behavior is emerging here .",
    "new collective behavior could , for instance , be produced by time delays , which may remarkably make it easier for networks to synchronize @xcite .    here however , instead of time delays , we consider non - diffusive coupling schemes .",
    "one particular non - diffusive coupling scheme , the so - called _ direct coupling scheme _ is motivated by biological findings ( see @xcite and the references therein ) and has been used in studies of amplitude response of coupled oscillators @xcite , although not investigated as extensively as diffusive coupling in synchronization research . in this letter , we use a direct coupling scheme to study the emergence of new collective dynamical behavior .",
    "in particular , we show the emergence of synchronized chaotic behavior in a network of non - chaotic units . to our knowledge",
    "this is the first time that such a phenomenon is observed and analyzed in depth in mathematical network models .",
    "in contrast , synchronized chaotic behavior in a network of chaotic units @xcite and non - synchronized chaotic behavior in a network of non - chaotic units @xcite are well established phenomena .",
    "a further feature of this work is that we take the succeeding , typically in the literature neglected , facts into account .",
    "many biological networks share the following two properties @xcite : @xmath0 the connection structure is , in general , not symmetric . @xmath1",
    "the influence of neighboring units can be excitatory or inhibitory , which is modelled by positive and negative weights .",
    "it is thus essential to incorporate these characteristics in network models in order to understand the dynamical behavior of biological networks .",
    "consequently , we consider networks with arbitrary network topologies , namely , not necessarily symmetrically coupled networks with possibly both positive and negative weights . on the other hand , we restrict ourselves to networks of identical units .",
    "we mention , e.g. , @xcite , as a recent study of diffusively - coupled units with small parametric variations .    in order to emphasize a general aspect , we consider in the next section networks with pairwise coupling and present a general synchronization criterion .",
    "later on , we will focus on directly coupled networks and study the emergence of new behavior .",
    "in our coupled map network model , each node is a dynamical system whose evolution is described in discrete time @xmath2 by iterations of a scalar map @xmath3 , _ i.e. _  by an equation of the form @xmath4 the interconnections are specified by a weighted , directed graph @xmath5 on @xmath6 vertices .",
    "the weight @xmath7 of the connection from vertex @xmath8 to vertex @xmath9 can be positive , negative or zero .",
    "we assume that the network has no self - loops , that is , @xmath10 for all @xmath9 .",
    "the in - degree of vertex @xmath9 is @xmath11 .",
    "the activity at vertex or unit @xmath9 at time @xmath12 is given by : @xmath13 where @xmath14 and @xmath15 are differentiable functions with bounded derivatives , and @xmath16 is the overall coupling strength .",
    "the function @xmath3 describes the dynamical behavior of the individual units whereas @xmath17 characterizes the interactions between different pairs of units .",
    "we are interested in synchronized solutions of eq .",
    "( [ pairwise ] ) , where the activity of all units is identical , that is , @xmath18 for all @xmath9 and @xmath2 .",
    "it follows from eq .",
    "( [ pairwise ] ) that a synchronized solution @xmath19 satisfies @xmath20 this equation already shows that the synchronized solution @xmath19 can be quite different from the dynamical behavior of an isolated unit described by @xmath3 .",
    "by contrast , in diffusive - type coupling , _",
    "@xmath21 for all @xmath22 , the interaction @xmath17 vanishes when the network is synchronized ; therefore , the synchronized solution is identical to the behavior of the individual units , and no new dynamics can emerge from synchronization . before we explore different examples of new collective behavior",
    ", we investigate the robustness of the synchronized state against perturbations .",
    "the network is said to ( locally ) synchronize if @xmath23 for all @xmath24 starting from initial conditions in some appropriate open set .",
    "the propensity of the network to synchronize depends on the properties of the functions @xmath3 and @xmath17 and the underlying network structure .",
    "the latter can be encoded in terms of the eigenvalues of the graph laplacian @xmath25 for directed weighted graphs , defined as @xcite @xmath26 we label the eigenvalues of @xmath27 as @xmath28 . since we assume that the in - degrees are non - zero , we may write @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the ( @xmath31 ) identity matrix , @xmath32 is the diagonal matrix of vertex in - degrees and @xmath33 is the weighted adjacency matrix of the underlying graph .",
    "zero is always an eigenvalue of @xmath25 ; we denote it @xmath34 , and @xmath35 is the corresponding eigenvector .",
    "since all components of @xmath36 are identical , perturbations along the @xmath36-direction again yield a synchronous solution . to study the remaining directions ,",
    "we define the _ k - th mixed transverse exponent _",
    "@xmath37 for @xmath38 as : @xmath39 where @xmath40 and @xmath41 denotes the ith partial derivative of @xmath17 and @xmath42 is chosen such that @xmath43 for all @xmath44 .",
    "if no such @xmath42 exists we set @xmath45 . note that these exponents are evaluated along the synchronous solution ( [ 9 ] ) .",
    "they combine the dynamical behavior of the individual units and the interaction function with the network topology .",
    "the maximal mixed transverse exponent governs the synchronizability of the network , that is , system ( [ pairwise ] ) locally synchronizes if @xmath46 this result is rigorously derived in our companion paper @xcite .",
    "in the sequel , we restrict ourselves to functions @xmath47 . when @xmath48 , pairwise coupling reduces to direct coupling , i.e. , @xmath49 and the mixed transverse exponent ( [ chi_k ] ) reduces to @xmath50 by rearranging terms on the right hand side in ( [ 1 ] ) as @xmath51 this becomes formally equivalent to a system of the form @xmath52 with @xmath53 for all @xmath22 , i.e. , a diffusively coupled map network .",
    "thus , the conditions for synchronization of directly coupled networks ( [ chidirect ] ) can be deduced from the diffusive coupling case ( [ diffusive ] ) of @xcite . however , the formal equivalence obscures the roles of the system parameters and the particular coupling functions , which are important in applications .",
    "for instance , in neuronal networks , gap junctions at electrical synapses provide connections of diffusive type , whereas chemical synapses provide connections with direct coupling .",
    "the distinction is crucial for understanding the effects of different types of synapses .",
    "as already mentioned , diffusively - coupled networks have been widely studied . for the remainder of this work , we restrict ourselves to direct coupling .",
    "the definition of @xmath54 intertwines the effects of the resulting synchronized dynamics and the network topology .",
    "however , if @xmath17 is a multiple of @xmath3 , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath55 for some constant @xmath56 , then these effects can be separated as the synchronization condition ( [ 5 ] ) takes the form @xmath57 where @xmath58is the lyapunov exponent of @xmath59 . here",
    "@xmath42 is chosen such that @xmath60 for all @xmath44 . in the sequel ,",
    "let @xmath61 denote the disk in the complex plane centered at @xmath56 having radius @xmath62 .",
    "it is easy to see that ( [ 8 ] ) is equivalent to the condition that all eigenvalues , except @xmath63 , are contained in @xmath64 , where @xmath65and @xmath66 if , for example , the synchronized solution @xmath67 is chaotic ( _ i.e. _  has a positive lyapunov exponent ) , then the first term in ( [ 8 ] ) has to be sufficiently negative to compensate the positive lyapunov exponent in order to ensure that the system ( [ 1 ] ) locally synchronizes .",
    "this in turn requires that the eigenvalues @xmath68 for @xmath69 be bounded away from zero , and the coupling strength @xmath70 lie in an appropriate interval .",
    "before turning to biologically motivated functions @xmath3 and @xmath17 , we demonstrate the emergence of synchronized chaotic behavior for the case of the tent map where an analytical treatment is possible .",
    "the tent map is given by @xmath71 for @xmath72 $ ] .",
    "its lyapunov exponent is @xmath73 ; thus , it is chaotic for @xmath74",
    ". let @xmath75 and @xmath76 with @xmath77 and choose the coupling constant @xmath78 . by choosing different values for the target value @xmath79",
    "we can generate different synchronized dynamical behavior @xmath80 whose lyapunov exponent equals @xmath81 . since the absolute value of the derivative of @xmath82 is constant , from ( [ 8 ] ) we have that the system ( [ 1 ] ) locally synchronizes if @xmath83 for @xmath84 .",
    "for example , for @xmath85 and @xmath86 , the synchronized dynamics is chaotic although the individual units are not .",
    "furthermore , in this case condition ( [ 6 ] ) is satisfied if all eigenvalues of the graph laplacian , except @xmath63 , are contained in @xmath87 .",
    "we now apply the foregoing ideas to models of neuronal networks .",
    "we point out that the equations usually considered in neural network theory , @xmath88 can be derived from ( [ 1 ] ) with @xmath89 and @xmath90 .",
    "thus the dynamics of @xmath91 are determined by the dynamics of @xmath92 and hence our results also apply to networks given in the form ( [ y ] ) .",
    "a neuronal network consists of neurons linked by synaptic connections , which are directed and weighted . for an excitatory synapse",
    "the weight is positive , and the presynaptic neuron increases the activity of the postsynaptic neuron according to its weight , whereas for an inhibitory one the weight is negative , and the postsynaptic activity is decreased .      in this model , the individual dynamics",
    "is governed by ( [ map ] ) with @xmath93 , where @xmath94 represents dissipation and @xmath95 is a bias term , which could also include _",
    "e.g. _  an external input . the interactions between the neurons are modeled by the sigmoidal function @xmath96 , where @xmath97 with @xmath98 .",
    "the resulting synchronized solution satisfies @xmath99 this is a generalization of the dynamics considered for @xmath100 in @xcite . in fig .",
    "[ fig.2 ] the lyapunov exponent of eq .",
    "( [ 4 ] ) is plotted for a set of parameter values .",
    "although the dynamical behavior of the individual units is very simple ( there is a globally attracting fixed point ) , the collective behavior can be non - trivial and even chaotic .",
    "note that dynamical behavior can be controlled by varying the coupling coefficient @xmath70 .",
    "we now fix @xmath101 so that the synchronized behavior is chaotic . in fig .",
    "[ fig.6 ] the mixed transverse exponent @xmath102 is plotted as a function of @xmath103 , which is here taken to be real for simplicity of graphical depiction .",
    "the figure shows that the network locally synchronizes if approximately @xmath104 since in that case @xmath105 for all @xmath106 .",
    "we illustrate the dynamics in an all - to - all coupled network of leaky neurons .",
    "the eigenvalues fall into the range given by ( [ 7 ] ) when @xmath107 . to see this , recall @xcite that the laplacian of an all - to - all coupled network on @xmath6 units has one eigenvalue equal to zero and all other eigenvalues equal to @xmath108 hence , globally coupled networks having more than four vertices should synchronize to a common trajectory , which , according to fig .",
    "[ fig.2 ] , is chaotic , whereas smaller networks do not synchronize .",
    "this is confirmed by the simulation results of fig .",
    "[ fig.7 ] .      as a second model of a neuronal network",
    "we consider a sigmoidal neuron dynamics with @xmath109 . in this case",
    "the neuron behaves like one with bias term .",
    "we take the interactions between the neurons to be also given by a sigmoidal function @xmath110 .",
    "the resulting synchronized dynamics satisfies @xmath111 for the special case @xmath112 , the dynamics of eq .",
    "( [ 3 ] ) has been analytically shown to be chaotic if @xmath113 @xcite . here",
    "we consider a whole range of @xmath70-values .",
    "the bifurcation diagram of eq .",
    "( [ 3 ] ) is plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig.3 ] , for a set of parameter values .",

    "[ fig.5 ] the mixed transverse exponent @xmath102 is plotted as a function of the complex eigenvalue @xmath103 , where the blue color shows regions of synchronization .",
    "figure [ fig.9 ] shows the onset of synchronization to chaos in a random directed network of 100 sigmoidal neurons , where the probability of a directed link from a vertex to another is taken to be 0.25 for a positive link and 0.01 for a negative link . as in the leaky neuron model , monotonic individual dynamics",
    "is replaced by collective chaotic behavior , this time in a random directed network having both excitatory and inhibitory links . by adjusting the global coupling strength @xmath70",
    ", one can observe a wide variety of synchronized dynamical behavior .",
    "besides the emergence of chaos in networks of simple units , our theory can also be used to show the possibility of simple synchronous dynamics in a network of chaotic units . in other words ,",
    "chaos is replaced by simpler behavior in the network .",
    "the field of chaos control is extensive and includes several well - established methods ; for an overview see @xcite and the references therein . in our case",
    ", the network achieves chaos suppression through synchronization of its units .    as an example we study chaos suppression in a network of coupled chaotic logistic maps .",
    "it is well - known that the logistic map @xmath114 \\mbox { and } x\\in [ 0,1],\\ ] ] undergoes a period doubling route to chaos as the parameter @xmath115 is increased from 0 to 4 @xcite . in the sequel we will consider two different values for the parameter @xmath115 . for @xmath116",
    "the logistic map possesses an attracting fixed point and the lyapunov exponent is given by @xmath117 .",
    "thus @xmath118 is dynamically simple . on the other hand for @xmath119",
    "the logistic map is maximally chaotic with a lyapunov exponent @xmath120 .",
    "consider a network of chaotic logistic maps , with @xmath121 and @xmath122 . in this case",
    "the synchronous solution is given by @xmath123 .",
    "so the whole synchronized network displays simple dynamical behavior , although all units in the network are chaotic .",
    "it follows from ( [ c * ] ) and ( [ r * ] ) that the network synchronizes if all eigenvalues @xmath68 , for @xmath124 , are contained in @xmath125 .",
    "as we have seen , the synchronous solution can be simple although all units of the network are chaotic . in this case",
    "it is possible to state a sufficient condition for synchronization without the explicit calculation of the laplacian eigenvalues .",
    "it follows from gershgorin s disk theorem @xcite that all eigenvalues of @xmath25 are contained in @xmath126 , where , and equality holds if and only if the weights are all nonnegative or all nonpositive .",
    "note that @xmath62 can be much larger than 1 if there exist vertices in the graph with small in - degree ( @xmath127 ) , due to cancellations of positive and negative weights . ]",
    "@xmath128 on the other hand , by ( [ c * ] ) and ( [ r * ] ) , the system synchronizes if all eigenvalues @xmath68 , for @xmath124 , of @xmath25 are contained in @xmath64 .",
    "consequently , a sufficient condition for synchronization is given by @xmath129 we consider the case where @xmath130 . in @xcite",
    "we prove that ( [ disk ] ) holds if and only if @xmath131 note that ( [ independent ] ) can only be satisfied if the resulting synchronous behavior is not chaotic , since the right - hand - side of ( [ independent ] ) is non - positive .",
    "hence , if the synchronized solution @xmath19 is not chaotic , it is possible to use the spectral bound @xmath62 , instead of the whole spectrum of @xmath25 , to give a sufficient condition for synchronization .",
    "the advantage is that from ( [ r ] ) one can immediately estimate the effect of changing the network weights without lengthy eigenvalue calculations .",
    "in diffusively - coupled networks , the whole synchronized network displays the same behavior as any single individual unit ; hence , complex behavior can not emerge through synchronization of dynamically simple units .",
    "in contrast , as we have shown in this letter , the direct - coupling scheme leads to new collective dynamical behavior when the network synchronizes .",
    "we have given an analytical condition for synchronization in terms of the spectrum of the generalized graph laplacian and the dynamical properties of the individual units and coupling functions .",
    "in particular , we have shown that synchronous chaotic behavior can emerge in networks of simple units , and conversely , chaos can be suppressed in networks of chaotic units through synchronization .",
    "these results represent a further step towards answering a fundamental question in complexity , namely , how complex collective behavior emerges in networks of simple units .",
    "the setting presented here allows for studying synchronization in general network architectures .",
    "such generality is important for applications because the connection structure of many real - world networks is unidirectional and the influence of neighboring units can be excitatory or inhibitory , as in neuronal networks .",
    "we have applied our theoretical findings to two neuronal network models , and have shown that , by changing a single parameter such as the coupling constant , the network can exhibit quite a rich range of dynamical behavior in its synchronized state .",
    "the results presented here provide insight on how new dynamical behavior may be induced in neuronal networks by changing the synaptic coupling strengths in a learning process ."
