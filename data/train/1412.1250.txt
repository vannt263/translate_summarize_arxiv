    "in the last two decades , it has become clear that most local spheroidal galaxy components ( elliptical galaxies and the bulges of spiral galaxies ) contain a super massive black hole ( smbh ) in their centres .",
    "the proportionality between black hole ( bh ) and spheroid mass suggests a direct link between the growth of the black hole as an active galactic nucleus ( agn ) and the stellar mass of the spheroid ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite ) . identifying the main mechanisms for formation and evolution of galaxies , and their interrelation to that of the growth of their central black holes is a major issue in astrophysics and cosmology . in this work ,",
    "we have studied a sample of x - ray - obscured qsos , described by @xcite and @xcite , and studied by @xcite , @xcite and @xcite , at z@xmath51 - 3 when most of the sf and bh growth are ocurring in the universe .",
    "these qsos have strong submm emission , much higher than typically found in qsos at similar redshifts and luminosities .",
    "@xcite found detections at @xmath6 significance at 850@xmath7 m ( scuba ) .",
    "here , we endeavour to get the physical properties of the central qsos ( luminosities , bh masses , eddington ratios , etc . ) and their host galaxies ( sfr , @xmath8 , @xmath9 , etc . ) and their mutual relationships ( or lack thereof ) . in addition",
    ", we will try to fathom their place in agn - host galaxy co - evolution models .",
    "we have constructed the spectral energy distributions ( sed ) of all our objects , in @xmath10 .",
    "all objects clearly show at least two components : an uv - nir contribution attributable to direct accretion disk emission ( as expected from their type 1 nature ) , intrinsically absorbed in the cases of rx  j0941 and rx  j1218 ; and a reprocesed thermal component in the mir region from warm optically thick dust further away from the nucleus ( the torus ) . in all of them",
    "we also observe an additional fir / submm component associated to cooler dust , heated by star formation ( sf ) .",
    "we thus confirm the presence of strong fir emission due to sf in these objects , at the ulirg / hlirg level ( compared to e.g. mrk 231 ) .",
    "our next goal is to make fits to our data with different templates to extract quantitative information about our objects .",
    "we have selected the _ sherpa : ciao s modeling _ & _ fitting package _",
    "@xcite module for the python platform to perfom the fitting .",
    "seds were fitted in @xmath10 versus rest - frame @xmath11 .",
    "we use relatively simple empirical and theoretical templates , aiming at reproducing the general shape of the seds of our objects . we do not attempt to extract detailed physical information about our objects from those templates , since our data do not warrant such undertaking , and the underlying physics is likely to be more complex than that considered in the models .",
    "we have modelled the distinct constituents with three different components :    * an agn accretion disk component : * this template models the direct emission from the accretion disk of the agn ( sub - parsec scales ) .",
    "we use the pure disk newagn4 template from @xcite , affected by intrinsic extinction ( see below ) .",
    "the only free parameter is the normalization of the template .",
    "we have normalized the template to its integral in the 0.12 - 100  @xmath7 m range ( standard limits used to estimate the accretion disk luminosity ) . from the fits",
    "we directly obtain the value of the disk luminosity in that range , @xmath12 .    * a torus component : * this template models the re - emission from the warm and hot dust ( on tens of parsecs scales , beyond the sublimation radius , see @xcite ) that is warmed by the accretion disk emission .",
    "we have used both an empirical template from @xcite ( dusttor , based on an average quasar spectrum ) and three dusty clumpy torus models from @xcite found by @xcite to represent the average properties of type 1 qsos ( torus1 , torus2 and torus3 ) .",
    "similarly , we have normalized them to their integral in the 1 - 300  @xmath7 m range ( again , standard limits used for the torus luminosity ) , so the only free parameter is @xmath13 .    * a sf component : * we have used a subset of the @xcite spherical smooth models , found by @xcite to encompass the observed seds of star - forming galaxies at least up to @xmath14 .",
    "the full @xcite models have five free parameters to obtain their 7000 templates .",
    "the subset of templates recommended by @xcite ( around 2000 templates ) are divided into 11 sub - grids , depending on the maximum radius and different star populations . for each source",
    ", we found the best - fit template for each of these 11 sub - grids",
    ". we did not attempt to extract detailed physical information from the particular best - fit templates , since instead we were looking for physically - motivated templates that reproduced the spectral shape of the data .",
    "therefore , the only parameter that we obtained from these fits , was the integrated fir luminosity ( 40 - 500@xmath7 m ) @xmath15 .    for each source ( see below ) we have chosen the family of models with the lowest @xmath16 .",
    "table  [ lumresults ] shows the average values of the luminosities and extinction values among each best - fit family for each source and the minimum value of @xmath16 for each best - fit family .",
    "we have estimated the uncertainties in those values from the standard deviation .",
    "we believe that these values and their uncertainties are fair estimates of the luminosities of each component and of the effects of the photometric errors and our lack of an accurate physical model for what is really happening in each source .      +     +        [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ discu ]    previous works have found some evidence of a correlation between the sf of the host and the agn obscuration in the x - rays ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "later studies with deeper surveys both in the x - ray and infrared ranges have failed to repoduce these results ( e.g @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "we have therefore looked for a correlation between n@xmath17 ( from @xcite ) and sfr in our sources ( fig .",
    "[ figallfits ] fith row right column ) , finding a tentative positive correlation between these parameters .",
    "this is interesting , since it would imply a coupling of the ionized gas absorbing the x - rays at the scale of the accretion disk or the blr with the gas forming stars in the host galaxy bulge , about three orders of magnitude farther away . at face value",
    ", this would be compatible with a positive feedback scenario , @xcite in which the ionized outflowing gas would trigger star formation in the interstellar medium of the host galaxy , with the highest column density gas corresponding to stronger feedback .",
