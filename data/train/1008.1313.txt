    "although the difference between @xmath193 ( amd ) and @xmath193 ( shell ) in @xmath14c is not as large as the one in @xmath0be , it seems that there exist some clustering effects also in @xmath14c .",
    "the jlab data of @xmath0be and @xmath14c and the theoretical slopes are plotted at two different density points of the amd and shell models .",

    "in the usual convolution calculation , the spectral function is given by the averaged nuclear density distribution , and thus the inhomogeneity of the nuclear density is washed out . in such calculation , the average nuclear density of @xmath0be is lower than that of @xmath14c or @xmath15he as shown in fig .

    ", the anomalous @xmath0be result is  explained \" as a normal one by the maximum local density ; however , it does not mean that physics mechanism is clarified .",
    "what we emphasize here is that the emc ratio or the nuclear structure function itself could consist of the mean conventional part and the remaining one depending on the maximum local density .",
    "the remaining part is surely associated with the inhomogeneity of the nuclear density , before taking the average of nuclear wave function , given by the nuclear cluster structure .",
    "it could be nuclear - medium modification of the nucleonic structure function .",
    "it is well known that the cluster structure is well developed in be and that the light mass region with @xmath197 is very suitable to study the cluster structure .",
    "therefore , it is reasonable that , although the cluster - structure effect in the emc ratio is not seen in the medium and large nuclei so far , we can now observe it in the beryllium isotope region . such cluster structure will be investigated in the light - mass region by future jlab experiments @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to find that _ the  anomalous \" jlab data for @xmath0be can be explained if it is plotted by the maximum local density at the cluster positions _ because the @xmath0be ( amd ) data is very close to the curve in fig .",
    "[ fig : drdx-2 ] . on the other hand ,",
    "the @xmath0be data remains anonymous if it is plotted by the shell - model density because the @xmath0be ( shell ) data significantly deviates from the curve .",
    "such a tendency also exists in @xmath14c but it is not as serious as the @xmath0be case . if the average nuclear density of @xmath0be is used in showing the slope data , the clustering effects are not clearly reflected . here , it is important to point out that the @xmath0be data agrees with the other nuclear data if they are plotted as a function of the maximum density .",
    "this fact implies that _ the physics mechanism associated with the high densities , for example due to the clusters in @xmath0be , could be the origin for explaining the nuclear - modification slopes of the @xmath16 structure functions .",
    "_ one of the possible mechanisms is the modification of internal nucleon structure caused by nuclear medium effects at the high density regions .",
    "nuclear modifications of structure function @xmath2 were investigated for finding a possible signature of clustering structure in nuclei .",
    "the convolution model was used for describing nuclear structure functions , where momentum distributions of the nucleon were calculated in the amd and shell models . according to the amd",
    ", the @xmath0be nucleus has a clear clustering structure of two @xmath1-like clusters with a surrounding neutron .",
    "because of the cluster formation in @xmath0be , high - momentum components increase in the nuclear wave function of the amd in comparison with the distribution of the shell - model one .",
    "although there are some differences between the structure functions of @xmath0be in the amd and shell models , the differences are rather small in our simple convolution picture . therefore , an anomalous emc effect found for @xmath0be at jlab should come from other effects such as the internal nucleon modification due to the high - density regions created by the clustering .",
    "* for the first time , the nuclear structure functions @xmath16 are calculated in a model with clustering structure in nuclei .",
    "then , they are compared with the structure functions of the shell model to clarify the clustering effects . *",
    "the clustering configuration in the @xmath0be nucleus produces high - momentum components in the nuclear wave function .",

    "the anomalously large nuclear effect for the slope @xmath13 of the @xmath0be nucleus observed at jlab can be explained if the slope is plotted by the maximum local density calculated in the theoretical model ( amd ) with clustering structure .",
    "* since the nuclear - modification slopes are explained by the maximum densities of nuclei , the physics mechanism of the anomalous nuclear effect could be associated with the high densities in the clusters of @xmath0be .",
    "this fact implies that internal nucleon modifications due to the high densities could be the origin of the @xmath0be anomaly , although careful estimations should be made on effects of short - range nucleon - nucleon correlations .",

    "<S> for understanding an anomalous nuclear effect experimentally observed for the beryllium-9 nucleus at the thomas jefferson national accelerator facility ( jlab ) , clustering aspects are studied in structure functions of deep inelastic lepton - nucleus scattering by using momentum distributions calculated in antisymmetrized ( or fermionic ) molecular dynamics ( amd ) and also in a simple shell model for comparison . according to the amd , </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath0be nucleus consists of two @xmath1-like clusters with a surrounding neutron . </S>",
    "<S> the clustering produces high - momentum components in nuclear wave functions , which affects nuclear modifications of the structure functions . </S>",
    "<S> we investigated whether clustering features could appear in the structure function @xmath2 of @xmath0be along with studies for other light nuclei . </S>",
    "<S> we found that nuclear modifications of @xmath2 are similar in both amd and shell models within our simple convolution description although there are slight differences in @xmath0be . </S>",
    "<S> it indicates that the anomalous @xmath0be result should be explained by a different mechanism from the nuclear binding and fermi motion . </S>",
    "<S> if nuclear - modification slopes @xmath3 are shown by the maximum local densities , the @xmath0be anomaly can be explained by the amd picture , namely by the clustering structure , whereas it certainly can not be described in the simple shell model . </S>",
    "<S> this fact suggests that the large nuclear modification in @xmath0be should be explained by large densities in the clusters . </S>",
    "<S> for example , internal nucleon structure could be modified in the high - density clusters . </S>",
    "<S> the clustering aspect of nuclear structure functions is an unexplored topic which is interesting for future investigations . </S>"
