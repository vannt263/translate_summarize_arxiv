    "<S> @xcite , where how ibc in driven systems corrects adiabatic pumping was first studied . </S>",
    "<S> this is especially encouraging because our derivation here refers to a nondriven system and also takes an entirely different route than ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . the alternative derivation in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite clearly indicates that @xmath63 is of a dynamical , not a geometrical origin . </S>",
    "<S> the found ibc effect is seen to persist well in the presence of dephasing , insofar as its explicit form is only modified by dephasing via @xmath64  [ see the expression of @xmath65 defined below eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ tcfinal ] ) ] . </S>",
    "<S> lastly , in obtaining @xmath66 we already assumed that the off - diagonal elements @xmath67 have decayed to zero  @xcite . hence naively setting @xmath68 alone in the expression for </S>",
    "<S> @xmath66 does not suffice to recover any unitary limit . because this last subterm does not even depend on the pumping protocol  ( no derivatives with respect to @xmath3 is involved ) </S>",
    "<S> , this subterm largely originates from a current inherent in the initial state itself , whose contribution to the pumping is accumulated only for a dephasing time scale . </S>",
    "<S> overall , the four subterms presented in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ tcfinal ] ) can now be used to predict , both qualitatively and quantitatively , the features of adiabatic transport emanating from rather general nonequilibrium states . _ adiabatic pumping in a chern - insulator model . </S>",
    "<S> _ we use the qi - wu - zhang model hamiltonian  @xcite , @xmath69\\sigma_z , \\label{qwzm}\\ ] ] which contains the main feature of chern insulators  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this system can describe spin-@xmath70  ( @xmath71 are pauli matrices ) fermions with spin - dependent nearest - neighbor hoppings on a square lattice , with @xmath72 being an energy bias parameter . </S>",
    "<S> though originally @xmath39 and @xmath3 refer to two quasimomenta along different directions , here we may also view the above hamiltonian as a @xmath0d system with @xmath3 being an experimentally tunable system parameter . </S>",

    "<S> the spectrum of @xmath36  [ hence also of @xmath43 ] is indeed symmetric in @xmath39 . </S>",
    "<S> remarkably , eq .  ( [ tcfinal ] ) applied to this two - band model yields particularly simple expressions for @xmath61 and @xmath62 , with @xmath77 where @xmath78 , as defined before , is now given by @xmath79/2 $ ] . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath80 in eq .  </S>",

    "<S> clearly then , without ibc , the adiabatic pumping solely determined by @xmath61 and @xmath62 is of geometrical nature , but modified by dephasing . </S>",
    "<S> the whole story of adiabatic transport under a pumping protocol is however completed by @xmath63 and @xmath66 , whose explicit expressions follow eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ tcfinal ] ) and are not given here .    </S>",
    "<S> to verify our theory , we numerically evolve various initial states at each quasimomentum value using the above - mentioned pure - dephasing lindblad master equation . </S>",
    "<S> we then obtain @xmath83 by integrating the numerically found @xmath47 over @xmath39 and @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> consider first an initial state uniformly filling the bottom band only . in this case </S>",
    "<S> there is no ibc , so the pumping is entirely determined by @xmath61 and @xmath62 in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ fab ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : pcic ] , theory and numerics are in perfect agreement . for the topologically nontrivial case with @xmath84  ( top panel ) , </S>",
    "<S> @xmath83 decreases from a quantized chern number  ( @xmath85 ) to zero as the dephasing rate @xmath15 increases . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the topological relevance to adiabatic pumping is gradually suppressed by dephasing . for the topological trivial case with @xmath86  ( bottom panel ) , however , @xmath83 first decreases and then increases with @xmath15 . </S>",
    "<S> we stress that this dephasing - induced pumping is still directly connected with the @xmath87 metric . </S>",
    "<S> the non - monotonous dependence of @xmath83 on the dephasing rate @xmath15 is easily understandable from the expression of @xmath61 , which reflects a competition between the dephasing - modified ( effective ) band gaps and dephasing - modified nonadiabatic transition rates .    </S>",
    "<S> we next consider initial states that coherently populate the two bands . as the first example </S>",
    "<S> , the initial density matrix is chosen as @xmath88 \\otimes\\left[\\langle\\psi_k^{(1)}(0)|+\\langle\\psi_{k}^{(2)}(0)|\\right]$ ] . </S>",
    "<S> this initial state populates the two bands equally with a uniform distribution in @xmath39 , with @xmath89 . </S>",
    "<S> so @xmath61 and @xmath62 described in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ fab ] ) have no contributions to adiabatic pumping . nevertheless , the effect of ibc on the transport is nonzero , with the agreement between theory and numerics presented in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : pcc](a ) . </S>",
    "<S> it is seen that as dephasing strengthens , @xmath83 increases first and then decreases , reflecting a competition between dephasing and ibc . in particular , the ibc induced transport is significant even when the dephasing rate @xmath15 is comparable to the characteristic scale of the system s band gap . turning to a second density matrix as the initial condition , i.e. , @xmath90 $ ] @xmath91 @xmath92 $ ] . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath61 term for this case turns out to make no contribution . </S>",
    "<S> both theoretical and numerical results for this example are shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : pcc](b ) . </S>",
    "<S> there , we have separately plotted the contributions associated with @xmath62 , @xmath63 , and @xmath66 . </S>",
    "<S> though the overall dependence of @xmath83 on @xmath15 shows one valley only , it is seen that each of the three terms responds to dephasing in different manners . </S>",
    "<S> that is , it is necessary to know all these terms in order to better understand the overall pumping .    </S>",
    "<S> _ concluding remarks . _ </S>",
    "<S> quantum adiabatic pumping with rather general nonequilibirum initial states and in the presence of dephasing is contributed by two components of different nature , with one of them depending on initial bloch state populations and the other determined by interband coherence . </S>",
    "<S> though our theory uses a very simple pure - dephasing lindblad master equation , the explicit results obtained here should be useful towards understanding the dynamics of quantum pumping in more realistic situations . by using different initial states or different pumping protocols , it is possible to isolate each of the two pumping components . </S>",
    "<S> we highlight the interband coherence effect , as it persists well in the presence of dephasing . </S>",
    "<S> note that the interband coherence effect on pumping  [ @xmath63 in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ tcfinal ] ) ] is determined by @xmath93 at the start , so its magnitude can be extensively manipulated by varying the switch - on behavior of a pumping protocol . </S>",
    "<S> this promises an interesting and relatively robust means to coherently control the pumping dynamics albeit dephasing .    </S>",
