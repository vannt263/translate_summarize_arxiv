    "one of the most profound observations in theoretical physics is the relationship between finite - temperature quantum theories and zero - temperature quantum theories which are compactified on a circle .",
    "indeed , the fundamental idea behind this so - called `` temperature / radius correspondence '' is that the free - energy density of a theory at finite temperature @xmath2 can be reformulated as the vacuum - energy density of the same theory at zero temperature , but with the euclidean time dimension compactified on a circle of radius @xmath3 .",
    "this connection between temperature and geometry is a deep one , stretching from quantum mechanics and quantum field theory all the way into string theory .",
    "this extension to string theory is truly remarkable , given that the geometric compactification of string theory gives rise to numerous features which do not , at first sight , have immediate thermodynamic analogues or interpretations .",
    "for example , upon spacetime compactification , closed strings accrue not only infinite towers of kaluza - klein `` momentum '' states but also infinite towers of winding states .",
    "while the kaluza - kelin momentum states are easily interpreted in a thermal context as the matsubara modes corresponding to the original zero - temperature states , it is not _ a priori _ clear what thermal interpretation might be ascribed to these winding states . likewise , as a more general ( but not unrelated ) issue , closed - string one - loop vacuum energies generally exhibit additional symmetries such as modular invariance which transcend field - theoretic expectations .",
    "while the emergence of modular invariance is clearly understood for zero - temperature geometric compactifications , the need for modular invariance is perhaps less obvious from the thermal perspective in which one would simply write down a boltzmann sum corresponding to each string state which survives the gso projections .",
    "both of these issues tended to dominate the earliest discussions of string thermodynamics in the mid-1980 s .",
    "historically , they were first flashpoints which seemed to show apparent conflicts between the thermal and geometric approaches which had otherwise been consistent in quantum field theory .",
    "however , it is now well understood that there are ultimately no conflicts between these two approaches  @xcite .",
    "indeed , modular invariance emerges naturally upon relating the integral of the boltzmann sum over the `` strip '' in the complex @xmath4-plane to the integral of the partition function over the fundamental domain of the modular group  @xcite .",
    "likewise , thermal windings emerge naturally as a consequence of modular invariance and can be viewed as artifacts arising from this mapping between the strip and the modular - group fundamental domain .",
    "there is , however , one additional feature which can generically arise when a theory experiences a geometric compactification : because of the topologically non - trivial nature of the compactification , it is possible for a non - zero gauge flux to pierce the compactification circle .",
    "in other words , the compactification might involve a non - trivial wilson line .",
    "viewed from the thermodynamic perspective , this corresponds to nothing more than the introduction of a chemical potential .",
    "however , as we shall see , this is ultimately a rather unusual chemical potential : it is not only imaginary but also temperature - dependent .",
    "such chemical potentials have occasionally played a role in studies of finite - temperature field theory ( particularly finite - temperature qcd  @xcite ) .",
    "however , with only a few exceptions , such chemical potentials ( and the wilson lines to which they correspond ) have not historically played a significant role in discussions of finite - temperature string theory .    at first glance , it might seem reasonable to hope ( or simply postulate ) that wilson lines should play no role in discussions of finite - temperature string theory . however , wilson lines play such a critical role in determining the allowed possibilities for self - consistent geometric compactifications of string theory that it is almost inevitable that they should play a significant role in finite - temperature string theories as well .",
    "indeed , the temperature / radius correspondence essentially guarantees this .",
    "thus , it is natural to expect that theories with non - trivial wilson lines will be an integral part of the full landscape of possibilities for string theories at finite temperature  , that they will be part of the full `` thermal string landscape '' .",
    "a heuristic argument can be invoked in order to illustrate the connection that might be expected between wilson lines and string theories at finite temperature . as we know ,",
    "thermal effects treat bosons and fermions differently and thereby necessarily break whatever spacetime supersymmetry might have existed at zero temperature .",
    "in string theory there are tight self - consistency constraints which relate the presence or absence of spacetime supersymmetry to the breaking of the corresponding gauge symmetry , and these connections hold even at zero temperature . for example",
    ", the @xmath1 heterotic string in ten dimensions is necessarily supersymmetric , and it is inconsistent to break this supersymmetry without simultaneously introducing a non - trivial wilson line ( or in this context , a gauge - sensitive orbifold twist ) which also breaks the @xmath1 gauge group .",
    "indeed , the two are required together . even for the @xmath0 gauge group ,",
    "a similar situation arises : although there exist two @xmath0 heterotic strings , one supersymmetric and the other non - supersymmetric , the @xmath5 orbifold which relates them to each other is not simply given by the susy - breaking action @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the spacetime fermion number .",
    "rather , the required orbifold which twists the supersymmetric @xmath0 heterotic string to become the non - supersymmetric @xmath0 heterotic string is given by @xmath8 where @xmath9 is a special non - zero wilson line which acts non - trivially on the gauge degrees of freedom .",
    "this example will be discussed further in sect .",
    "indeed , such a wilson line is needed even though we are not breaking the @xmath0 gauge symmetry in passing from our supersymmetric original theory to our final non - supersymmetric theory .",
    "such examples indicate the deep role that wilson lines play in zero - temperature string theory , and which they might therefore be expected to play in a finite - temperature context as well .    in this paper , we shall undertake a systematic examination of the role that such wilson lines might play in string thermodynamics",
    ". we shall concentrate on the zero - temperature heterotic and type  i strings in ten dimensions , and survey the possible wilson lines which might be introduced in their finite - temperature extensions .",
    "as we shall see , this gives rise to a rich structure of possible thermal string theories , and we shall demonstrate that these new thermal string theories can be interpreted as extrema of a continuous thermal free - energy `` landscape '' .",
    "in fact , some of these new thermal theories even have non - traditional hagedorn temperatures , an observation which we shall discuss ( and explain ) in some detail",
    ". our analysis will also uncover a unique finite - temperature extension of the heterotic @xmath0 and @xmath1 strings which involves a non - trivial wilson line , but which  like the traditional finite - temperature extension without wilson lines  is metastable in this thermal landscape .",
    "such new theories might therefore play an important role in describing the correct thermal vacuum of our universe .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in order to set the stage for our subsequent analysis , in sect .",
    "ii we provide general comments concerning string theories at finite temperature and in sect .",
    "iii we discuss the possible role that wilson lines can play in such theories .",
    "we also discuss the equivalence between such thermal wilson lines and temperature - dependent chemical potentials . in sect .",
    "iv , we then survey the specific wilson lines that may self - consistently be introduced when constructing our thermal theories , concentrating on the two supersymmetric heterotic strings in ten dimensions as well as the supersymmetric type  i string in ten dimensions . in sect .",
    "v , we demonstrate that non - trivial wilson lines can also affect the hagedorn temperatures experienced by these strings , and show how such shifts in the hagedorn temperature can be reconciled with the asymptotic densities of the zero - temperature bosonic and fermionic string states . then , in sect .",
    "vi , we extend our discussion in order to consider continuous thermal wilson - line `` landscapes '' for both heterotic and type  i strings .",
    "it is here that we discuss which wilson lines lead to `` stable '' and/or `` metastable '' theories . finally , in sect .",
    "vii , we conclude with some general comments and discussion .",
    "an appendix summarizes the notation and conventions that we shall be using throughout this paper .",
    "we begin by discussing the manner in which a given zero - temperature string model can be extended to finite temperature .",
    "this will also serve to establish our conventions and notation . because of its central role in determining the thermodynamic properties of the corresponding finite - temperature string theory , we shall focus on the calculation of the one - loop string thermal partition function @xmath10 .",
    "the situation is slightly different for closed and open strings , so we shall discuss each of these in turn .      in order to begin our discussion of closed strings at finite temperature",
    ", we begin by reviewing the case of a one - loop partition function for a closed string at zero temperature . our discussion will be as general as possible , and will therefore apply to all closed strings , be they bosonic strings , type  ii superstrings , or heterotic strings . for closed strings ,",
    "the one - loop partition function is defined as z_model ( )   tr   ( -1)^f  ^h_r q^h_l [ pf ] where the trace is over the complete fock space of states in the theory , weighted by a spacetime statistics factor @xmath6 . here",

    "( [ pf ] ) , it is straightforward to construct its generalization to finite temperature . as is well known in field theory , the free - energy density @xmath16 of a boson ( fermion ) in @xmath14 spacetime dimensions at temperature @xmath2 is nothing but the zero - temperature vacuum - energy density @xmath17 of a boson ( fermion ) in @xmath14 spacetime dimensions , where the ( euclidean ) timelike dimension is compactified on a circle of radius @xmath18 about which the boson ( fermion ) is taken to be periodic ( anti - periodic )",
    ". we shall refer to this observation as the `` temperature / radius correspondence '' .",
    "this correspondence generally extends to string theory as well  @xcite , state by state in the string spectrum .",
    "however , for closed strings there is an important extra ingredient : we must include not only the `` momentum '' matsubara states that arise from the compactification of the timelike direction , but also the `` winding '' matsubara states that arise due to the closed nature of the string .",
    "indeed , both types of states are necessary for the modular invariance of the underlying theory at finite temperature . as a result",

    "the final expressions for our finite - temperature string partition functions @xmath19 must also be modular invariant , satisfying the constraint @xmath20 .",
    "because our thermal theory necessarily includes two groups of momentum quantum numbers ( namely those with @xmath21 as well as those with @xmath22 ) which are treated separately ( corresponding to spacetime bosons and fermions respectively ) , modular invariance turns out to imply that winding numbers @xmath23 which are even will likewise be treated separately from those that are odd . as a result",

    "@xcite ) . as is well known , this correspondence is most directly formulated in quantum field theory ( as opposed to string theory ) and ultimately rests upon the algebraic similarity between the free - energy density of a thermal theory and the vacuum - energy density of the zero - temperature theory in which the euclidean timelike direction is geometrically compactified on a circle .",
    "this similarity can be demonstrated as follows .",
    "let us begin on the thermal side , and consider the thermal ( grand - canonical ) partition functions corresponding to a single real @xmath14-dimensional bosonic field and a single @xmath14-dimensional fermionic field of mass @xmath27 : z_b , f(t )  =   _ ( 1 e^-e_p / t)^1 [ pfs3 ] with @xmath93 . in eq .",

    "( [ iden ] ) , we have followed standard practice and dropped terms beyond the infinite products as well as terms which compensate for the dimensionalities of the arguments of the logarithms .",
    "we therefore find that f_b , f(t )  =   _ n = -^ log  +   ...

    "[ lambdadef ] here @xmath6 indicates the spacetime statistics of the quantum field ( @xmath97 for a bosonic field , @xmath98 for a fermionic field ) .",
    "moreover , if we imagine that the time dimension is compactified on a circle of radius @xmath99 ( so that the integral over @xmath100 can be replaced by a discrete sum ) , and if the quantum field in question is taken to be periodic ( p ) or anti - periodic ( a ) around this compactification circle , then eq .

    "p , a  =   12r ( -1)^f _ n=-^   [ lambdanext ] where @xmath101 , @xmath102 . given these results , it is now possible to make the `` temperature / radius correspondence '' : comparing eq .",
    "( [ freees ] ) with eq .",
    "( [ lambdanext ] ) , we see that we can identify the free - energy density @xmath16 of a boson ( fermion ) in @xmath14 spacetime dimensions at temperature @xmath2 with the zero - temperature vacuum - energy density @xmath103 of a boson ( fermion ) in @xmath14 spacetime dimensions , where a ( euclidean ) timelike dimension is compactified on a circle of radius @xmath18 about which the boson ( fermion ) is taken to be periodic ( anti - periodic ) .",
    "given this derivation of the temperature / radius correspondence , it may at first glance seem that the identification of bosons and fermions with integer and half - integer modings around the thermal circle is sacrosanct .",
    "however , let us consider what happens when we repeat this derivation in the presence of a non - trivial gauge field @xmath104 on the geometric ( zero - temperature ) side .",
    "when we calculate the vacuum energies of our bosonic or fermionic quantum field in the presence of a non - trivial gauge field @xmath104 , we must use the kinematic momenta @xmath105 where @xmath106 is the charge ( expressed as a vector in root space ) of the field in question .",
    "of course , if the field @xmath104 is pure - gauge ( , with vanishing corresponding field strength ) and our spacetime geometry is trivial , then this change in momenta from @xmath107 to @xmath108 will have no physical effect .",
    "_ however , if we are compactifying on a circle , there is always the possibility that our compactification encloses a gauge - field flux .",
    "_ as in the aharonov - bohm effect , this then has the potential to introduce a non - trivial change in modings for fields around this circle , even if the gauge field @xmath104 is pure - gauge at all points along the compactification circle .",
    "indeed , such a flat ( pure - gauge ) background for the gauge field @xmath104 is nothing but a wilson line .    to be specific , let us first consider the situation in which our compactification circle of radius @xmath99 completely encloses a @xmath109 magnetic flux of magnitude @xmath110 which is entirely contained within a radius @xmath111 . at all points along the compactification circle , this then corresponds to a @xmath109 gauge field @xmath104 whose only non - zero component is the component @xmath112 along the compactified dimension .",
    "because of the non - trivial topology of the circle , we then find that the shift from @xmath107 to @xmath108 for a state with @xmath109 charge @xmath113 induces a corresponding shift in the corresponding modings :  nr  +   12r  .",

    "this , then , explains how a non - trivial wilson line can produce unexpected modings due to the non - trivial compactification geometry .",
    "however , we still wish to understand the appearance of such a wilson line thermally .",
    "what is the thermal analogue of the non - trivial wilson line ? or , phrased somewhat differently , what effect on the thermal side can restore the temperature / radius correspondence if a non - trivial wilson line has been introduced on the geometric side ?",
    "it turns out that introducing a non - trivial wilson line on the geometric side corresponds to introducing a non - zero chemical potential on the thermal side .",
    "in fact , this chemical potential will be imaginary . to see this ,",
    "let us reconsider the partition functions of complex bosons and fermions in the presence of a non - zero chemical potential @xmath121 where @xmath122 .",
    "in general , a complex bosonic field will have a grand - canonical partition function given by z_b(t )  =   _ * p * [ parfb ] where the two factors in eq .",

    "a similar result holds for complex fermions and anti - periodic fields , with the same chemical potential .",
    "we thus conclude that the introduction of a non - trivial wilson line on the geometric side corresponds to the introduction of an imaginary , temperature - dependent chemical potential on the thermal side .",
    "this result is well known in field theory  @xcite , and has also recently been discussed in a string - theory context  @xcite .    before concluding",
    ", we should remark that the above discussion has been somewhat field - theoretic .",

    "this result is certainly true in quantum field theory , and also holds by extension for open - string states .",
    "however , closed - string states can carry not only momentum quantum numbers @xmath27 but also winding numbers @xmath26 which parametrize their windings around the thermal circle .",
    "this is important , because in the presence of a non - zero winding mode @xmath26 , a non - trivial wilson line shifts not only the momentum @xmath27 but also the charge vector @xmath106 of a given state , so that eq .",

    "( [ shiftnumbershet ] ) reduces to eq .",
    "( [ momentumshift ] ) for @xmath126 .",
    "we have already seen in sect .",
    "ii that the manner in which a zero - temperature string theory is extended to finite temperature depends on the choice as to which zero - temperature states are to be associated with integer momenta @xmath32 around the thermal circle , and which are to be associated with half - integer momenta @xmath49 .",
    "once this decision is made , the thermal properties of the resulting theory are completely fixed .",
    "moreover , we have seen in sect .",
    "iii that there is considerable freedom in making this choice , depending on whether ( and which ) wilson lines might be present . indeed , in principle , each choice of wilson line leads to an entirely different thermal theory . while all of these thermal theories necessarily reduce back to the starting zero - temperature theory as @xmath35",
    ", they each represent different possible finite - temperature extensions of that theory which correspond to different possible chemical potentials which might be introduced into their corresponding boltzmann sums .",
    "indeed , viewed from this perspective , we see that the traditional boltzmann choices merely correspond to one special case : that without a wilson line , for which the corresponding chemical potential vanishes .    as an example , let us consider the supersymmetric @xmath0 heterotic string . at zero temperature , the partition function of this theory is z_model  =   z^(8)_boson   ( _ v-_s ) ( _ i^2 + _ v^2 + _ s^2 + _ c^2 )  , [ start ] and without a wilson line we would normally decompose this into the separate thermal contributions @xmath30 and @xmath41 by making the associations z^(1 ) & = & z^(8)_boson _ v ( _ i^2 + _",
    "v^2 + _ s^2 + _ c^2 )   + z^(2 ) & = & -z^(8)_boson _ s ( _ i^2 + _ v^2 + _ s^2 + _ c^2 )  .",
    "[ nowilson ] indeed , this is precisely the decomposition discussed in sect .",
    "ii , which leads to the standard boltzmann sum . however , there are in principle other ways in which the zero - temperature partition function in eq .",
    "( [ start ] ) might be meaningfully decomposed .",
    "for example , let us consider an alternate decomposition of the form z^(1 ) & = & z^(8)_boson _ v ( _ i^2 + _",

[ note , in this connection ,",
    "that the @xmath127 character combination @xmath128 is nothing but the @xmath0 character @xmath129 , and likewise @xmath130 is nothing but @xmath131 .",
    "] however , as we have seen in sect .",
    "iii , such `` wrong '' modings can be easily understood as the effects of a non - trivial wilson line .",
    "indeed , looking at eq .",
    "( [ shiftnumbershet ] ) , we see that the results in eq .",
    "( [ alternate ] ) are obtained directly if our wilson line @xmath125 is chosen such that @xmath132  ( mod  @xmath133 ) for states in spinorial representations of @xmath0 , while @xmath134  ( mod  @xmath133 ) for states in vectorial representations of @xmath0 .",
    "given that @xmath135 for vectorial representations of @xmath0 and @xmath136 for spinorial representations of @xmath0 , we see that a simple choice such as @xmath137 can easily accomplish this .",
    "however , at this stage , we have no knowledge as to whether or not such a wilson line represents a legitimate choice for the @xmath0 heterotic string . for example , we have no idea whether such a wilson - line choice is compatible with a worldsheet interpretation in which the possible choices of wilson lines are tightly constrained by numerous string self - consistency constraints .",
    "moreover , along the same lines , we do not know what other wilson lines might also be available .    in order to explore all of the potential possibilities",
    ", we shall therefore proceed to survey the set of all possible wilson lines which might be self - consistently introduced when attempting to extend a given zero - temperature string theory to finite temperatures . as we shall see , however , the situation is somewhat different for closed strings and type  ii strings .",
    "we shall therefore consider these two cases separately .",
    "in general , there are two classes of closed strings which are supersymmetric and hence perturbatively stable : type  ii superstrings and heterotic strings . in ten dimensions , however ,",
    "the type  ii superstrings lack gauge symmetries ; thus no possible wilson lines can exist in their extensions to finite temperatures .",
    "for this reason , when discussing closed strings , we shall concentrate on the ten - dimensional supersymmetric @xmath0 and @xmath1 heterotic strings .",
    "note , however , that in lower dimensions , all of the closed strings will accrue additional gauge symmetries as a result of compactification  indeed , this holds for type  ii strings as well as heterotic .",
    "thus , in lower dimensions , the sets of allowed wilson lines in each case are likely to be much more complex than we are considering here .",
    "in general , the temperature / radius correspondence provides us with a powerful tool to help determine the allowed wilson lines that may be introduced when forming our thermal theory : we simply replace the temperature @xmath2 with @xmath138 and consider the corresponding problem of introducing a wilson line into the geometric compactification of our original zero - temperature theory .",
    "for example , if we are seeking the set of allowed wilson lines that can be introduced into the construction of the finite - temperature ten - dimensional @xmath0 heterotic theory , we can instead investigate the allowed wilson lines that may be introduced upon compactifying the zero - temperature @xmath0 theory to nine dimensions . in principle",

    "however , for closed strings , it turns out that t - duality leads to a significant simplification : while the @xmath139 ( or @xmath35 ) limit reproduces our original string model in the original @xmath14 spacetime dimensions , and while taking @xmath140 leads to a string model in @xmath141 spacetime dimensions , the formal @xmath142 ( or @xmath143 ) limit actually yields a new string theory which is back in @xmath14 spacetime dimensions !",

    "as indicated above , these cases all share the same  contribution as well . like the torus contribution ,",

    "[ type1plot](a ) that it is positive rather than negative and does not diverge , even at @xmath176 .",

[ type1plot](b ) for @xmath127 . in this case , the discontinuous divergence at @xmath179 is solely due to the _ closed - string _ tachyon coming from the torus amplitude in fig .",
    "[ type1plot](a ) .",
    "however , for all other cases with @xmath180 , we also have a relatively huge cylinder contribution which is negative for @xmath175 , with @xmath181 smoothly as @xmath182 .",

    "thus the @xmath126 case ( , the case with vanishing wilson line ) has the most negative cylinder contribution and correspondingly the most negative total free - energy density from amongst the choices with gauge groups @xmath171 .",

    "this feature is already well known in the string - thermodynamics literature : it is a direct result of the open - string tachyon at @xmath185 , and suggests that the hagedorn temperature is actually a limiting temperature for type  i strings rather than the location of a phase transition .",
    "as we have seen , one of the most prominent aspects of thermal string theories is the existence of a hagedorn transition at which the string free - energy density diverges .",

    "the sudden appearance of such new `` thermally massless '' states at a critical temperature @xmath208 is the signal of the appearance of the long - range order normally associated with a phase transition , and the fact that such states generally become tachyonic immediately above @xmath208 reflects the instabilities which are also normally associated with a phase transition .    as a result , in order to derive the hagedorn temperature of a given theory , it is sufficient to search for states within the thermal partition function @xmath10 whose masses decrease as a function of temperature , reaching ( and perhaps even crossing ) zero at a certain critical temperature .",
    "we shall refer to such states as `` thermally massless '' at the critical temperature . since thermal effects always provide a positive contribution to the squared masses of any states , such states must intrinsically be tachyonic at zero temperature .",

    "as we have seen , the type  i string _ a priori _ has a richer set of allowed wilson lines , yet none of these has the required properties .",
    "given the existence of these ` b ' theories , many questions naturally arise .",
    "for example , it is well known that the zero - temperature supersymmetric @xmath0 type  i and heterotic strings are related to each other under strong / weak coupling s - duality relations .",
    "one naturally wonders , therefore , whether such s - duality relations extend to finite temperatures .",
    "however , as we have seen , the `` landscape '' of the @xmath0 heterotic string at finite temperature includes not only the @xmath273 theory but also the @xmath274 theory . it would therefore be interesting to understand how this `` doubling '' phenomenon can be reconciled with the existence of a unique thermal @xmath0 theory on the type  i side  @xcite .",
    "another important question concerns whether there might be some other way ( , through dynamical means , or perhaps through self - consistency arguments ) in order to develop a thermal `` vacuum selection '' criterion and thereby assert that only one of these theories is preferred or allowed , and the other excluded .",
    "this question will be examined in refs .",
    "it is well known , for example , that the @xmath273 theory has a number of unexpected and disturbing features , the least of which is the fact that the @xmath143 limit of this theory is again supersymmetric .",
    "this is also true of the @xmath275 theory .",
    "this property is completely surprising , given our expectation that finite - temperature effects should treat bosons and fermions differently , and is very different from what occurs for type  i and type  ii thermal theories .",
    "indeed , this behavior leads to several disturbing features ( see , , the discussion in ref .",
    "by contrast , the @xmath274 theory is relatively natural from this point of view : the @xmath143 limit of this theory lacks spacetime supersymmetry , but preserves the underlying @xmath0 gauge symmetry . even in the @xmath1 case ,",
    "the ` b ' theory has a non - supersymmetric @xmath143 limit yet breaks the gauge symmetry as minimally as possible .",
    "thus , if we could somehow argue that the ` b ' theories are the unique correct thermal heterotic theories , we would then reach the remarkable conclusion that all string theories in ten dimensions , whether open or closed , whether type  i or type  ii or heterotic , actually have a unique hagedorn temperature . in other words , we would be in the aesthetically pleasing situation in which we could assert a existence of a single hagedorn temperature for string theory as a whole .",
    "this issue is discussed further in refs .",
    "in this paper , we investigated the consequences of introducing a non - trivial wilson line ( or equivalently a non - trivial chemical potential ) when formulating string theories at finite temperature .",
    "we focused on the heterotic and type  i strings in ten dimensions , and surveyed the possible wilson lines which might be introduced when extending these strings to finite temperature .",
    "we found a rich structure of resulting thermal string theories , and showed that in the heterotic case , some of these new thermal theories even have hagedorn temperatures which are shifted from their usual values .",
    "remarkably , these shifts in the hagedorn temperature are not in conflict with the densities of bosonic and fermionic states which are exhibited by their zero - temperature counterparts .",
    "we also demonstrated that our new thermal string theories can be interpreted as extrema of a continuous thermal free - energy `` landscape '' .",
    "finally , as part of this study , we also uncovered a pair of unique finite - temperature extensions of the heterotic @xmath0 and @xmath1 strings which involve a non - trivial wilson line , but which are nevertheless metastable in this thermal landscape .",
    "as we have argued , these new thermal theories ( the so - called ` b ' theories discussed in sect .",
    "vi.c ) represent _ bona fide _ alternatives to the traditional thermal heterotic strings , and may be viewed as equally legitimate candidate finite - temperature extensions of the zero - temperature @xmath0 and @xmath1 heterotic strings in ten dimensions .",
    "indeed , as we have seen , the analysis in this paper also illustrates that the @xmath273 and @xmath274 heterotic theories are on equal footing as potential heterotic analogues of the thermal @xmath0 type  i string .",
    "clearly , many outstanding questions remain .",
    "for example , in this paper we have found that for each of the supersymmetric heterotic strings in ten dimensions , there exists a unique non - trivial wilson line which leads to a metastable theory .",
    "however , it would be interesting to understand more generally for which string theories this will be the case .",
    "likewise , we have found that these new wilson lines lead to an increased hagedorn temperature .",
    "it is therefore natural to wonder whether there might exist situations in which metastable wilson lines manage to avoid the hagedorn transition entirely .",
    "it is also important to realize that in the type  i case , our analysis has essentially focused on those wilson lines associated with the open - string sector . in ten dimensions ,",
    "this was a legitimate restriction , as one can not introduce wilson lines in the closed - string sector of ten - dimensional type  i strings .",
    "however , it would clearly be of great interest to examine the situation in lower dimensions . in lower dimensions , perturbative type  ii strings",
    "can have non - trivial gauge groups which are generated by compactification . as a result",
    ", there can be non - trivial wilson lines that are associated with such type  ii compactifications , and therefore the potential type  i orientifolds of such models can quickly become quite numerous .",
    "in particular , the set of candidate thermal extensions of a given type  i string model might include models which are distinct in terms of their closed - string sectors as well as their open - string sectors .    of course , our analysis in this paper is subject to a number of important caveats .",
    "first , we have been dealing with one - loop string vacuum amplitudes , and likewise considering only the tree - level ( non - interacting ) particle spectrum .",
    "thus , we are neglecting all sorts of particle interactions .",
    "gravitational effects , in particular , can be expected to change the spectrum quite dramatically , and have recently been argued to eliminate the hagedorn transition completely by deforming the resulting spectrum away from the expected exponential rise in the degeneracy of states .",
    "however , the purpose of this paper has been to show that even within the non - interacting string theory which has been studied for more than two decades , the introduction of non - trivial wilson lines can have significant effects on the resulting thermal theories .",
    "this work has clearly focused on the thermal behavior of string theories at temperatures _ below _ the hagedorn transition . as such",
    ", it is not clear that these results will shed any light on that feature which remains the most mysterious aspect of string thermodynamics : the nature of the hagedorn transition itself .",
    "however , the involvement of non - trivial wilson lines may eventually have ramifications in this regard that are not yet apparent .",
    "in this paper we have restricted our attention to the thermal properties of _ perturbative _ type  i and heterotic strings , especially when non - trivial wilson lines are introduced into the mix .",
    "however , it would clearly be of great interest to consider the implications of these results at the non - perturbative level , once d - branes and other non - perturbative structures are included . in particular",
    ", it would be interesting to study the possible implications of these results for the thermodynamics of d@xmath276-branes  @xcite as well as for the cosmological applications of finite - temperature d - branes  @xcite . in this connection",
    ", it would also be interesting to understand the thermal consequences of our observations within the recent brane - world scenarios , as these frameworks involve a subtle dynamical interplay between bulk ( closed - string ) physics and brane ( open - string ) physics .",
    "likewise , it would also be interesting to extend our results to non - flat backgrounds in order to address important questions such as the thermodynamics of black holes , the ads / cft correspondence , and so forth .    continuing this line",
    ", it would also be interesting to understand the implications of these results for the existence of strong / weak coupling duality relations at finite temperature .",
    "it is certainly aesthetically pleasing that the heterotic and type  i hagedorn temperatures can be brought into agreement through the introduction of non - trivial wilson lines , and this immediately raises the question whether the zero - temperature heterotic / type i dualities can be extended to finite temperature .",
    "in particular , although the perturbative type  i string lacks states transforming as @xmath0 spinors  which is ultimately the reason why the @xmath273 and @xmath274 theories are equivalent on the type  i side  such states do emerge non - perturbatively  @xcite . thus we can expect that the non - perturbative type  i theory will have a thermal behavior which is even closer to that of the perturbative heterotic string , and for which a non - trivial wilson line might be examined as well .",
    "these issues will be examined in more detail in ref .",
    "@xcite .    but above all",
    ", perhaps the most pregnant issue is the existence of the so - called ` b ' theories , and the roles these theories may ultimately play in the general structure of string theory at finite temperature . given that the ` a ' and the ` b ' theories appear to be equally compelling as finite - temperature extensions of the traditional zero - temperature heterotic strings , it remains to investigate whether there might be a thermal vacuum selection principle that favors one over the other ( see , , refs .",
    "@xcite ) . moreover , if no such selection principle exists , it will be important to study the different physics to which they each lead , and the possibility of phase transitions between them .",

    "<S> we find a rich structure of possible thermal string theories , some of which even have non - traditional hagedorn temperatures , and we demonstrate that these new thermal string theories can be interpreted as extrema of a continuous thermal free - energy `` landscape '' . our analysis also uncovers a unique finite - temperature extension of the heterotic @xmath0 and @xmath1 strings which involves a non - trivial wilson line , but which  like the traditional finite - temperature extension without wilson lines  is metastable in this thermal landscape .    </S>",
