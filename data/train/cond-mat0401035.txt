    "although the critical temperature of ising model on edge - dual network is higher than the one in the random network , both quantities become infinite in the same point , that is when the second moment of the degree distribution of random network , @xmath213 , becomes infinite .",
    "this fact reflects the robustness of edge - dual networks against thermal fluctuations , a property which can be attributed to the large number of triangles and the special structure of the edge - dual networks .",
    "we also derived the critical behavior of ising model on edge - dual network of an uncorrelated random scale free network .",
    "the results show that this behavior is significantly different from the one seen in the uncorrelated random networks ."
