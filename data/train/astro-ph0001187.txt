    "the observed brightness / steepness trend of the radio knots would then apparently rule out effective electron acceleration in the knots , because such a process implies a hardening ( see e.g. berezhko & vlk @xcite ) , rather than a steepening of the particle spectra , typically to the power - law index @xmath29 .",
    "there does exist however a natural way to modify the spectra of radio electrons , if we abandon the standard approach of a spatially uniform source for treatment of these electrons .",
    "spectral modifications become unavoidable if we take into account _ energy - dependent _ propagation and escape of relativistic particles from the regions of higher concentration in an inhomogeneous medium .",
    "the efficiency of this process depends on the spatial gradients in the energy distribution @xmath30 of particles , and timescales of the spectral modifications can be as short as the escape time @xmath31 .",

    "5 we study the opposite scenario , which assumes that the enhancement of the electron density in zone 1 is caused not by active acceleration of particles there , but rather only by compression of the background population of relativistic electrons in the shell .",

    "@xcite ) and cos  b detectors .    with the recent upper limits of the egret telescope , @xmath35 ( esposito et al .",
    "@xcite ) , this constraint on @xmath32 is significantly strengthened .",
    "in fig.2 we present the fluxes of the bremsstrahlung and synchrotron radiations calculated for 3 values of the mean magnetic field : @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "for the mean gas density ( in terms of ` h - atoms ' ) we take @xmath39 , corresponding to @xmath40 of matter in the shell ( fabian et al .",

    "@xcite , reed et al .",

    "the chosen @xmath45 explains the fluxes of hard x - rays above 10kev as synchrotron emission for the case of @xmath46 .",
    "however , this value of @xmath32 is unacceptable because the bremsstrahlung flux produced by gev radio electrons is too high .",
    "the egret upper limit for the @xmath47-ray flux of cas  a requires at least @xmath48 .",
    "simultaneously we have to assume a significant flattening in the source spectrum of electrons below 100mev in order to avoid contradictions with the observed x - ray fluxes at 100kev . for a single power - law distribution of electrons extending with @xmath49 down to the mev region , the lower limit to the magnetic field",
    "is @xmath50 .",
    "note however , that for @xmath51 the radiative energy losses of the electrons establish a spectral break at optical or lower frequencies , in which case the spatially homogeneous single - zone model fails to explain the observed hard x - ray fluxes by synchrotron radiation .",
    "a more realistic model for cas  a has to account for the inhomogeneities in the radio brightness distribution and for the observed spread in the power - law exponents of the radio spectra of individual structures within @xmath52 .",
    "the simplest approximation for a non - uniform radio source corresponds to a ` two - zone ' model , where the source with total volume @xmath53 consists of 2 different regions , or zones , with volumes @xmath54 and @xmath55 , with 2 different spatial densities ( concentrations ) of radio electrons @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "propagation effects may result in a significant difference between the two - zone and single - zone models only if these densities are essentially different .",
    "therefore the principal definition for these two zones is that the concentration of electrons in zone 1 is much higher than in zone 2 , @xmath58 .",
    "the energy distributions of the electrons in these zones can be different .",
    "therefore in the power - law approximation @xmath59 the exponents @xmath60 and @xmath61 can be different . because the spectral ratio @xmath62 may thus depend on energy ,",
    "it is convenient to specify that the condition @xmath58 relates first of all to electrons with energies @xmath63 which are typically responsible for radio emission in the ` 1 ghz ' band .    in order to apply the two - zone model to cas  a",
    ", we have to foresee some observational manifestations of the radio emission of zones 1 and 2 .",
    "it is reasonable to expect that not only the electron densities , but also the mean magnetic fields @xmath64 and @xmath65 in the two zones differ , with the magnetic field presumably being higher in the regions of higher electron densities . therefore , the radio emissivities in these zones will be strongly contrasting , with regions belonging to zone 1 characterized by a much larger emissivity than regions in zone 2 .",
    "it is also plausible that zone 1 components should be rather compact , with a small volume filling factor in the source , or otherwise the overall emission would be strongly dominated by this single zone .",
    "application of this criterion to cas  a immediately places all bright fragments of the radio ring in zone 1 .",
    "other constituents of zone 1 are the radio knots ( and bow shocks ) most of which are characterized by a strongly enhanced emissivity .",
    "we note however that in reality the knots embrace a wide range of emissivities , and because the simplified two - zone approach allows only 2 different electron densities ( and emissivities ) , some compact structures with relatively low brightness should be more correctly classified as belonging to zone 2 .",
    "this may have a physical basis  enhanced emissivity due to mild compression of magnetic fields , but without strong excess in the electon densities .",
    "zone 2 then consists of the rest of the ( spherical ) shell between the radio ring and the outer edge of cas  a , i.e. the main body of the radio plateau , but also includes some low - brightness radio knots .    for purposes of practical classification of low - intensity knots it may prove useful to resort also to the second potentially observable distinction between zones 1 and 2  different mean spectral indices @xmath66 and @xmath67 of their intrinsic emission . due to a faster escape of higher energy electrons from the regions of high concentration",
    ", one could generally expect that the radiation spectra produced in zone 1 should be _ steeper _ , @xmath68 ( see below sect .",
    "because the spectral index of the total emission @xmath69 is to be maintained , an immediate conclusion is that the radiation spectrum of the diffuse zone 2 should be noticeably _ flatter _",
    ", than the mean , i.e. @xmath70 .",
    "because of the complicated morphology , a quantitative treatment of the spectral indices of different types of structures is problematic in practice . in order to assess the characteristic values for @xmath71",
    ", we note that the line of sight integrated radio brightness seen towards individual radio knots shows a broad range of spectral indices from @xmath72 to @xmath73 , as measured by ar96 between @xmath74 and @xmath75 .",
    "these spectral indices however do not always correspond directly to the _ intrinsic _ spectral indices of the knots , due to background contamination from the plateau .",
    "although the detailed least square fitting procedure for spectral index measurements used in ar96 ( their sect .",
    "2.4 ) largely removes this problem for knots with high contrast to the plateau , for faint knots at the limit of confusion with the plateau , the spectral index will be biased towards the ( presumably flatter ) index of that emission . in this regard",
    ", the result of ar96 presented in their fig.6d appears as very informative .",
    "it shows that most of the radio knots found at large angular distances @xmath76 ( the _ projected _ @xmath77 ) belong to the steep - spectrum population : from 62 such knots in total , 45 have indices @xmath78 , and 22 ( i.e. @xmath79 ! ) belong to the ` extreme ' end of the observed spectral indices @xmath80 . because at these projected distances the brightness of the plateau is generally reduced with projected radius @xmath81 .",
    "it is plausible ( though not quantitatively investigated ) that this trend is due to the population of steep spectra radio knots detected by ar96 , which at lower angular resolution would contribute more flux than the plateau at angular distances @xmath82 ; the intrinsic spectrum of the plateau emission might be then flat . ] , this may indicate that the intrinsic spectral index of the radio knots on average could be much steeper than the mean @xmath83 , and that the spectral index @xmath84 of the ` extremely steep ' population of the observed knots might be not so extreme , but rather a representative value for the intrinsic index of the knots .",
    "an ( indirect ) indication of this suggestion could be also another result shown in fig .",
    "6d of ar96 : 83 from 123 knots found at angular distances close to the radio ring , @xmath85 , where the brightness of the plateau is relatively high , belong to the population of knots with an ` intermediate ' steepness @xmath86 .",
    "as discussed below in sect .",
    "6 , the model does not exclude a physical reason for such geometrical correlation between the knot index and its proximity to the ring .",
    "however , this effect can be explained also as a result of a line - of - sight mixture of _ comparable _ fluxes of the steep - spectrum knots with intrinsic @xmath87 and of the flat - spectrum diffuse plateau emission with @xmath88 ( see this sect .",
    "below ) . moreover ,",
    "if we believe that the real geometry of the shell is quasi - spherical , it is difficult to suggest any other reasonable explanation , except for invoking the flux contamination effect , why only 2 knots from those 123 show the index @xmath89 , whereas the expected number of ` extremely steep ' knots to be located at deprojected radii @xmath90 but at the angular distances close to the `` ring '' should have been comparable with ) , we would still expect significantly more than 2 knots to be seen within projected distances @xmath85 ] the number @xmath92 .",
    "we can conventionally define that all knots which have a moderate brightness and show spectral index @xmath93 belong to zone 2 .",
    "then , given the tendency for brighter knots to be steeper ( ar96 ) , this classification would retain most of the radio knots ( at least in terms of their overal flux ) in zone 1 . at the same time , excluding thus the flat - spectrum knots from zone 1 , for the average intrinsic spectral index of the remaining population of knots one can reasonably suppose @xmath94 or so .",
    "it is possible that the intrinsic spectral index of the zone 1 components identified with the bright fragments of the radio ring is also close to this value .",
    "the low frequency measurements of woan & duffet - smith ( @xcite ; hereafter wds90 ) at angular resolution @xmath95 show that the average spectral index of the bright large radio components correlated with the ring is @xmath96 , i.e. again significantly larger than the mean @xmath83 of the total emission . if we accept that the contribution of the diffuse emission , zone 2 , may be flat , the intrinsic spectral index of the fragmented radio ring should be even larger . then @xmath97 may be a reasonable value for the average spectral index of the entire zone 1 . for qualitative discussions in this section we will use @xmath98 .",
    "we note however that our model does not pretend to predict characteristic spectral indices with the accuracy of the second digit after the comma .",
    "the first zone will thus include a number @xmath99 individual components , i.e. basically the bright fragmented radio ring , the ` radio ' bow shocks , and the main part of all radio knots . besides",
    ", zone 1 could also contain some regions of high concentration of electrons and high emissivities which are not immediately distinguished on the intensity maps either because of their very small sizes or because of strong contamination by , and confusion with the diffuse plateau emission .",
    "the latter may be the case if we believe that the fragmented `` radio ring '' actually represents a chain of large but geometrically flat ( thin ) structures of the `` radio sphere '' which are observed mostly ` edge - on ' . then at angular distances interior to the ring , @xmath100 or so , such fragments observed ` face - on ' may easily merge with the plateau emission and show up as diffuse ` clouds ' of only moderately enhanced brightness ( see fig .",
    "1 ) .    the flux produced in zone 1 can be estimated if we remember that at 5 ghz the ( _ background subtracted _ ) flux of the radio ring fragments makes up @xmath101 , and that radio knots produce @xmath102 of the total flux ( tuffs @xcite ) .",
    "the latter value should be somewhat reduced for the flux of knots to be removed from zone 1 and classified in zone 2 . on the other hand",
    ", it seems quite possible that up to @xmath103 of the total flux should be assigned to the ` unseen ' population of zone 1 ( especially , to face - on structures of the `` radio sphere '' ) .",
    "therefore , we can estimate the overall flux @xmath104 of zone 1 as @xmath105 of the total , concluding that the fluxes of zone 1 and zone 2 at 5 ghz are about the same , @xmath106 .",
    "the spectral index @xmath67 in the diffuse zone 2 can be then predicted if we note that the total flux has the form @xmath107 in order for the mean spectral index between @xmath108 and @xmath109 to be equal to @xmath110 , one needs a flux ratio @xmath111 then for @xmath112 , @xmath113 , and @xmath114 , we find @xmath115 .",
    "it may somewhat vary assuming slightly different @xmath116 or @xmath66 ( or @xmath83 , which can be also slightly less than 0.77 , see fig.2 ) .",
    "in particular , @xmath117 may be rather close to 0.6 if we allow for the idea that the ` unseen ' face - on structures of the `` radio sphere '' could contribute into zone 1 a third of what is contributed by the edge - on `` radio ring '' .",
    "remarkably , these values of @xmath117 correlate well with the lower range of spectral indices of the flat - spectrum radio knots .",
    "this suggests that flat - spectrum radio knots , with spectral indices close to 0.6 ( or flatter than 0.7 as classified above ) may indeed represent the regions of moderate local compression of the magnetic field and/or relativistic electrons of the diffuse shell , and therefore may give information about the spectrum of the background population of electrons there .",
    "thus , the model suggests a rather flat intrinsic spectrum of the radio plateau in the range @xmath118 , which corresponds to the spectral index of electrons @xmath119 .",
    "for zone 1 , @xmath120 implies a rather steep electron spectrum with @xmath121 .",
    "taking into account the enhanced brightness of the compact zone 1 , we will refer to zone 1 structures as the compact bright steep - spectrum radio ( cbsr ) components .",
    "even though still highly simplified , this two - zone approach suggests a qualitative interpretation of several observed radio features of cas  a. in particular , it allows us to solve the problem of the low - frequency turnover below 20mhz .",
    "although the measurements of kpde at @xmath122 show evidence for thermally absorbing low - temperature gas in the central @xmath123 region of cas  a , the thermal absorption can not result in any noticeable effect in the shell where @xmath124 . on the other hand , in the case of a spatially homogeneous source ( the shell ) with a mean field @xmath125 , the process of synchrotron self - absorption results in a turnover of the radio spectrum only at frequencies below 5mhz ( see fig.2 ) . to explain the observed turnover below @xmath126 , in a single - zone approach one needs @xmath127 .",
    "but this assumption boosts the magnetic field energy up to @xmath128 , and therefore is hardly acceptable .",
    "the situation essentially changes if one takes spatial inhomogeneities in the distribution of radio electrons and magnetic fields into account .",
    "indeed , in the framework of the proposed two - zone approach the radio flux at frequencies well below 1 ghz is dominated by the steep - spectrum component , i.e. one has to require synchrotron self - absorption mainly of the zone 1 flux at @xmath129 .",
    "because of the very high density of the radio electrons and of the magnetic field in compact zone 1 components , synchrotron self - absorption there should be expected at frequencies significantly higher than in the single - zone model .    in order to estimate the model parameters needed for synchrotron self - absorption to occur below @xmath126",
    ", we note that for a power - law distribution of electrons @xmath130 the synchrotron luminosity can be expressed as @xmath131 where @xmath132 with @xmath133 .",
    "@xmath134 is a weak function of @xmath135 that changes within @xmath136 for @xmath137 , and we will assume @xmath138 . with the same accuracy ,",
    "the synchrotron absorption coefficient is given by @xmath139 where @xmath140 is the volume in units of @xmath141 .",
    "the volume of zone 1 can be represented in the form @xmath142 , where @xmath143 is the mean thickness of individual cbsr components along the line of sight and @xmath144 is their overall surface in the plane of the sky . requiring the synchrotron opacity to be significant at @xmath129 ( which implies @xmath145 at @xmath146 )",
    "we obtain @xmath147 for the external radius of the plateau region @xmath148 this leads to an area filling factor @xmath149 where @xmath150 . for @xmath151 in zone 1",
    "( see sect .",
    "4 ) , the ratio @xmath152 . from fig.1",
    "it is apparent that the area filling factor of all bright radio features is indeed of the order of 10% .    from eq.(5 )",
    "it follows that the characteristic length scale for @xmath153 cbsr components of the zone 1 should be of order @xmath154 . if we separate the radio knots from the larger fragments of the radio ring , and take into account that the flux @xmath155 of the knots constitutes about a third of @xmath104 , the mean radius of the knots can be estimated as @xmath156 . at the distance 3.4kpc this",
    "corresponds to the angular sizes of about @xmath157 , very similar to what is really observed .",
    "the superposition of flat and steep spectral components , with @xmath106 around @xmath75 , results in a flattening of the total radio spectrum at higher frequencies .",
    "observations of mezger et al .",
    "( @xcite ) do indicate a noticeable flattening of the cas  a spectrum in the wavelength range from @xmath158 to 1 mm , with power law index @xmath159 that possibly extends up to the near - ir region if the flux of continuum emission measured at @xmath160 by tuffs et al .",
    "( @xcite ) is synchrotron in origin ( see fig.2 ) .",
    "another important effect related to such composite fluxes consists in the possibility to give a new interpretation of the claimed secular flattening of the radio spectra ( dent et al .",
    "@xcite ; osullivan & green @xcite ) .",
    "namely , the flattening of the radio spectra in time could be easily explained as being due to different rates of decline of the fluxes of the two zones , with the plateau emission dropping more slowly .",
    "observations at 5ghz have shown that the cbsr components are fading more rapidly than the total emission , which then requires that the plateau must be fading less rapidly ( see table 6.1 of tuffs @xcite ) .",
    "if the plateau indeed were to have a flatter spectral index than the cbsr components , this would result in a flattening of the spectral index of cas a with time .",
    "note that previously , in the framework of the single - zone approach , the secular flattening could be explained only by the assumption of a gradual flattening of the spectrum of electrons either at higher energies or in time ( scott & chevalier @xcite , chevalier et al .",
    "@xcite , cowsik & sarkar @xcite , ellison & reynolds @xcite ) .",
    "another advantage of a spatially inhomogeneous model is its ability to explain the basic characteristics of the observed nonthermal radiation in terms of very efficient acceleration processes operating in cas  a , which generally result in a source function of accelerated particles with hard spectral indices @xmath161 ( e.g. efficient fermi acceleration at strong shock fronts ) .",
    "even though the spectral index formally corresponding to the mean @xmath162 is @xmath163 , the assumption of @xmath164 much harder than @xmath165 becomes possible if one takes into account the energy dependent propagation and escape of electrons from regions of high concentration on timescales @xmath166 .",
    "for example , assuming that the sites of efficient particle acceleration are located in zone 1 , one could expect that the electron energy distribution @xmath167 formed there on timescales @xmath168 would have the power - law index @xmath169 . on the other hand the leakage from zone 1 corresponds to injection of relativistic electrons into surrounding zone 2 with the rate @xmath170 where @xmath171 . with a reasonable source function index @xmath172 and energy - dependent",
    "escape with @xmath173 , the values of @xmath174 and @xmath175 needed for interpretation of the cas  a radio data could be reproduced .",
    "thus , the energy distribution of electrons @xmath176 in the compact regions of efficient acceleration , which results in the enhanced density of relativistic electrons , may be actually much steeper than @xmath177 in the surrounding volume .",
    "interestingly , although the electron distribution @xmath177 in the plateau region would show the hard spectral index of acceleration @xmath178 , in principle no acceleration of electrons needs occur there at all .",
    "it is important to note , however , that on a qualitative level the same power - law indices @xmath61 and @xmath60 for both zones could be expected also in the case when relativistic electrons were accelerated in zone 2 , while the electron density in cbsr structures would be enhanced due to local compression of the electrons , but not efficient acceleration in zone 1 . to distinguish between these 2 basic scenarios ,",
    "quantitative modelling is needed .",

    "the results of numerical calculations are shown in fig.8 .",
    "the total flux seems to fit the data practically equally well as in fig.4 earlier .",
    "however , a closer look to these figures reveals significant differences .",
    "first of all , in fig.8 the agreement with the radio data is reached due to a much higher contribution of zone 1 to the overall flux .",
    "in particular , at 5ghz the partition of the fluxes corresponds to @xmath375 , instead of @xmath376 .",
    "secondly , although here we have assumed high @xmath377 , the calculations show that the spectral index of the electrons swept up from zone 2 , @xmath378 , was steepened in zone 1 only to values @xmath379 , well below the ` expected ' value 2.95 .",
    "obviously , this is far insufficient for explanation of the observed steep spectral indices of the radio knots .",
    "the reason for difficulties arising in the scenario that assumes only passive compression , but not active acceleration of electrons in zone 1 , can be understood from fig.9 where we show the spatial densities @xmath380 of the electrons in zones 1 and 2 .",
    "the dot - dashed line shows the spectrum of the electrons which would be formed in the zone 1 if one neglects the term @xmath381 in eq.(14 ) .",
    "this spectrum is steep .",
    "but when the effect of spatial density gradients between the two zones is taken into account correctly , the situation dramatically changes .",
    "the energy dependent propagation can result in a significant steepening of the source spectra only in the regions of higher spatial densities of relativistic particles .",
    "otherwise diffusive exchange of particles tends to equalize @xmath291 with @xmath292 resulting in @xmath382 independently of @xmath244 , until the radiative losses become important .",
    "thus , for an effective modifications of the initial source spectrum of the radio electrons the condition @xmath383 should be satisfied .",
    "the ratio of electron densities expected at 1gev can be estimated from eqs .",
    "( 25 ) and ( 26 ) ( assuming @xmath384 ) as : @xmath385 for the parameters used in fig.8 this equation predicts @xmath386 , in agreement with numerical calculations , which is smaller by a factor of @xmath387 than similar ratio in fig.3 .",
    "calculations show that it is not easy to increase this ratio significantly , remaining within the ` adiabatic compression ' scenario .",
    "thus , a self - consistent explanation of the observed radio fluxes of cas  a is very problematic , unless we assume an effective acceleration of electrons in the cbsr components in order to build up sizeable gradients in the spatial distribution of the radio electrons in the source .",
    "the spatially non - uniform source model , even in its simplest two - zone form , allows us to unify into a single picture many observational data on the broad - band nonthermal radiation of cas  a. the following is the summary of observational features of cas  a which could be explained in the framework of this model .",
    "the brighter radio structures tend to be steeper ( ar96 ) to the extent that the energy density of relativistic electrons there would be higher . in principle , even assuming the same hard power law index for the acceleration , e.g @xmath388 , and @xmath389 for the escape of the electrons , it is possible to explain the observed variations of the spectral indices of individual compact radio structures from @xmath390 to @xmath391 .",
    "such variations can be connected with two effects .",
    "( a )   the intrinsic index of some knots will be flatter than the maximum possible @xmath392 if the local gradient @xmath393 is not sufficiently high , and if the characteristic escape time @xmath394 of gev electrons from these knots is larger than @xmath395 .",
    "the impact of the latter effect can be seen in figs .",
    "10 and 11 , where we show the fluxes and spectral indices calculated in the modified two - zone model approach , subdividing the cbsr structures in two groups and assuming 2 different spatial / temporal scales for larger ( ` ring ' ) and smaller ( ` knot ' ) components in zone 1 .",
    "( b )  the intrinsic spectrum of individual knots could be steep , up to @xmath396 , but the observed spectrum may be flatter , depending on the degree of flux contamination by the flat - spectrum radiation from the diffuse plateau along the line of sight to the knot .",
    "this effect may be relevant mainly to those cases when the background subtraction is problematic ( e.g. , for the structures with insufficiently high contrast to the plateau ) .",
    "the strong correlation between the spectral index and the projected position of radio knots observed by ar96 could be connected with both effects ( a ) and ( b ) .",
    "indeed , the brightness of the diffuse plateau seems to decrease from the radio ring towards the outer edge of the shell more rapidly than one would expect merely on the base of the projection effect in a spherical geometry ( see fig.7 from arlpb ) .",
    "this implies that the density @xmath397 of radio electrons could be higher at distances closer to the ring",
    ". then the steepest knots would be found predominantly closer to the edge of the plateau , because ( i ) the local ratio @xmath393 might be higher far from the reverse shock , and ( ii ) contribution of the flat spectrum plateau emission to the steep spectrum flux of the knots is smaller in directions to the projected periphery of the shell .",
    "the cutoff of the radio spectrum below 20mhz is explained by the synchrotron self - absorption of the flux of zone 1 .",
    "this interpretation is possible basically because the model predicts that the intrinsic fluxes of the compact bright structures are much steeper than the spectra in the diffuse plateau .",
    "then at low frequencies the flux of cbsr components should dominate the total radio emission .",
    "therefore synchrotron self - absorption of only this flux , which becomes possible due to high density of particles ( and fields ) in those compact structures , is sufficient to comply with the data .",
    "it is worth noticing that due to variations of the physical parameters in the individual cbsr components contributing to zone 1 flux , one could generally expect that the synchrotron absorption of that flux would be in reality smoother than it is shown in fig .  4 where we have assumed the same parameters for all counterparts of zone 1 .",
    "the position of the characteristic cutoff frequency for an individual component @xmath398 is found from the condition @xmath399 where @xmath400 is its opacity . from eqs .",
    "( 3 ) and ( 4 ) it follows that @xmath401 , with @xmath402 where @xmath403 is the knot flux ( luminosity ) at some fixed frequency ( say 1ghz ) . because of the very strong dependence of @xmath404 on @xmath405 , a significant broadening of the synchrotron turnover frequency for the ensemble of cbsr components ( say by a factor 2 ) would be expected only if the _ luminosity - weighted _",
    "dispersion @xmath406 of the parameter @xmath407 is very large ( @xmath408 ) .",
    "the fact that the observed turnover is sharp may then imply a quite reasonable possibility  that the distribution of the parameters @xmath409 is not far from ` gaussian noise ' . in that case one",
    "would normally expect @xmath410 ( or perhaps even less , given the expected correlation of @xmath403 and @xmath411 ) , so the synchrotron turnover position would be effectively dispersed , or broadened , only by a factor roughly @xmath412 , i.e. about @xmath413 around the mean position .",
    "note that the overall flux in fig.10 , where 2 significantly different sizes for the large and small components are assumed , show practically the same sharp cutoff below 20mhz as in fig.4 .",
    "observations at low frequencies by kpde , at a resolution of about @xmath414 , show that the spectral index of cas  a between 333mhz and 1.38ghz is approximately constant , @xmath415 , at angular radii @xmath416 , but that it is quickly increasing to @xmath417 as @xmath418 . in principle , this effect might be connected with the steep spectrum radio knots which have been detected by ar96 but can not be resolved in the low frequency maps of kpde .",
    "because of the rapid decline of the plateau brightness at large angular distances from the ring , the cbsr components ( the radio knots and bow shocks ) increasingly contribute to the ` diffuse ' overal flux closer to the periphery",
    ". we do not exclude that perhaps in the framework of a more spatially structured model ( that would allow large scale inhomogeneities in the plateau region itself ) one could expect also some steepening of the intrinsic diffuse flux .",
    "however , given much slower and less efficient spectral modifications for the large scale inhomogeneities , the propagation effects alone would be able to explain only rather moderate steepening of the intrinsic plateau emission .",
    "if the acceleration is efficient so that the primary spectrum is really hard , the steepening to values @xmath419 seems to require a dominating contribution of the compact structures in the overall flux detected by kpde .",
    "the two - zone model suggests a possible interpretation for the ` discrepancy ' between the spectral index @xmath420 found by kpde at the radius of the bright radio ring , and observations of wds90 who found @xmath421 if _ only _ the bright components at approximately the same radial distances are considered .",
    "both results might be understood if we take into account that the spectral index found by kpde corresponds to the flux of two zones integrated along the geometrical circles of different fixed radii , and hence would be more affected by the flat plateau flux than the result found in wds90 ( compare the heavy and thin solid lines in fig.11 ) .    the flattening of the radiation spectrum observed at millimeter wavelengths ( mezger et al .",
    "@xcite ) is a natural consequence of the ` flat + steep ' representation of the total flux in the two - component approach , with approximately equal contributions from these components around 5ghz .",
    "the two - zone model also predicts that the flux measured by tuffs et al .",
    "( @xcite ) around @xmath422 should be predominantly synchrotron in origin .",
    "the unusual dependence of the secular decline of radio fluxes on frequency , which is at a constant level at @xmath423 but seems dropping at higher frequencies , is explained by varying contributions of the flat and steep spectrum components at different frequencies .",
    "this interpretation suggests that on average the net flux of the bright compact components in cas  a drops faster than the diffuse plateau emission , in agreement with observations of tuffs ( @xcite ) .    the synchrotron origin of the x - rays above 10kev can be explained if electrons in the compact cbsr components are accelerated to energies of few tens of tev .",
    "these energies can be reached , e.g. , by diffusive shock acceleration in the bohm limit , which seems seems a plausible mechanism for production of relativistic electrons at the reverse shock presumably connected with the bright radio ` ring ' . in principle , for the radio knots as well the diffusive acceleration at the bow shocks could result in the high electron energies needed for x - ray emission .",
    "perhaps , another possibility for acceleration of electrons in the radio knots could be connected with reconnection of the magnetic field lines strongly amplified , as shown by jones et al .",
    "( @xcite ) , in thin turbulent layers behind the bow shocks of dense gas ` bullets ' at the stage of their fast disruption by rayleigh - taylor and kelvin - helmholtz instabilities .",
    "hard spectral indices for accelerated particles weaken the constraints on the energetics of relativistic electrons in cas  a. for example , in the case of @xmath424 , and @xmath425 and @xmath426 used in fig.4 , the total energy @xmath427 .",
    "the energy @xmath428 needed in the case of @xmath429 for a uniform shell with the same magnetic field @xmath430 is by a factor of 10 larger .",
    "the radio fluxes of the prototype young snr cas  a show a large variety of spectral and temporal features which are very difficult to incorporate into one self - consistent picture , if one remains in the framework of a single - zone ( i.e. uniform ) model approach and thus has to attribute the spectral indices deduced from radio observations to the source spectra of accelerated electrons , since radiation losses can not modify the energy distribution of radio electrons during the lifetime of cas  a. the interpretation of the radio data essentially changes if we take into account that energy dependent propagation of relativistic particles is able to modify their energy distribution in a spatially inhomogeneous source on timescales much shorter than the radiative loss time .",
    "the efficiency and extent of these modifications depend on the strength of the gradients in the spatial distribution of the particles in the source .",
    "the simplest spatially inhomogeneous model is the one where the radio source is subdivided into two zones with different energy distributions of relativistic electrons and different magnetic fields .",
    "the basic assumption of the model is that the number density of radio electrons in the compact bright radio components ( predominantly included in zone 1 ) is much higher than in the surrounding diffuse shell between the reverse shock and the blast wave ( zone 2 ) .",
    "the fulfillment of this assumption is contingent on an efficient acceleration of electrons in these radio bright components . in principle ,",
    "acceleration of electrons in the diffuse shell is not needed at all .",
    "note , however , that the model does not exclude a contribution from such acceleration provided that it is not so powerful as to noticeably reduce the gradients in the spatial density of electrons established by acceleration in the cbsr components , which would otherwise diminish the efficiency of spectral modifications in zone 1 .",
    "the possibility for exchange of particles between these zones on an energy dependent timescale @xmath431 , with @xmath432 , allows us to suggest a single hard power law injection spectrum of electrons with an index @xmath433 , implying an efficient acceleration process .",
    "then , depending on the relativistic electron density contrast and physical parameters of individual component @xmath398 , the leakage of electrons from those cbsr components can result in the steepening of the injection spectrum up to @xmath434 , in agreement with the maximal spectral indices of the knots @xmath435 .",
    "the energy distribution of radio electrons @xmath177 in the extended plateau will show the hard power - law index of injection , @xmath436 . as a general remark we note that energy - dependent propagation in any non - uniform medium would always tend to flatten the energy distribution of particles in the regions with _ lower _ density , i.e. which are typically more extended .",
    "the two - component decomposition of the overall flux , with @xmath437 at 5ghz , predicts that the sites of current or very recent acceleration will become more pronounced in the high resolution ( few arcsec ) maps at lower frequencies , where the contribution of the diffuse plateau to the overall flux will decrease .",
    "this should result in a significant increase of the brightness contrast for the remaining compact structures ( which belong to zone 1 ) , reaching its maximum around 40mhz ( i.e. at the minimum frequencies not affected by synchrotron self - absorption ) .    at frequencies @xmath438 the bright compact structures will quickly disappear , but the plateau emission , in the form of a weak diffuse shell , may become dominant again .",
    "this shell would probably have an apparent radius less than @xmath439 if the emissivity of the shell is indeed strongly decreasing towards the blast wave , implying very low brightness at large radii .",
    "correlations between the spectral index and the geometrical thickness of the radio knots of similar brightness could be expected on the high resolution maps of cas  a taken at 1.4 - 5ghz .",
    "the radio knots with a smaller thickness , but the same brightness , would tend to be steeper since the escape times in those knots could be smaller .",
    "note however that the escape time is not the only parameter affecting the efficiency of spectral modifications .",
    "in particular , the ` steepness - compactness ' correlation could be different for knots in the fading stage ( which are ` older ' , with declining injection of new particles ) and in the brightening stage .",
    "besides , such a correlation could be significantly affected by different magnetic fields in the knots .",
    "nevertheless , the search for correlations between spectral index and compactness of the knots seems worthwhile .    at frequencies above 10ghz",
    "the brightness contrast will decrease , and the cbsr structures may appear less pronounced .",
    "the total emission will be dominated by the diffuse flat - spectrum plateau , and the spectral index may decrease to @xmath440 ( see fig.11 ) . the structure of zone 2 , in particular the outer edge of the shell , will be better discernible .",
    "an important prediction concerns the character of the long term evolution of the radio pattern of cas  a. one can expect that during the next @xmath441 , when the total emission will become dominated by the diffuse plateau and the compact radio structures may become less common , the remnant will have a much more uniform radio shell with a spectral index @xmath442 , and cas  a may become similar to tycho s snr ( e.g. see klein et al .",
    "interestingly , the overall efficiency of electron acceleration at that time might be even lower than at present , while the radio spectrum will be significantly harder reflecting the spectrum of the acceleration which is taking place presently .",
    "more generally , the energy dependent propagation of radio electrons in a spatially inhomogeneous medium can explain the trend ( see e.g. green @xcite ; jones et al .",
    "@xcite ) that young clumpy shell - type snrs often exhibit radio spectra that are significantly steeper than those of older ones showing a typical spectral index @xmath443 .    at x - ray frequencies the appearance of cas  a",
    "may be very different in the soft x - ray and hard x - ray domains . at photon energies below @xmath444",
    "the radiation is dominated by thermal emission of the gas in the extended region from the reverse shock up to the blast wave .",
    "apart from the thermal diffuse emission we could expect a noticeable contribution of the nonthermal x - rays from compact radio structures . this radiation could be more easily distinguished from the thermal emission in the case of compact bright radio knots at the periphery of cas  a , if the x - ray spectra would appear relatively flat in the 1 - 5kev region ( see figs .  4 and 11 ) and the line emission would be deficient .",
    "these observations will be possible with the high spectral and angular resolutions of xmm and astro - e .    in hard x - rays",
    "above 10kev the appearance of cas  a may significantly change . in the case of a nonthermal origin of this radiation , all acceleration sites of the highest energy electrons",
    "may become clearly visible .",
    "note , however , that the angular resolution of the detectors needed to reveal significant spatial changes at these energies must be better than @xmath445 .",
    "the observation of such hard nonthermal x - ray fluxes from the compact radio knots and radio ring would impose an upper limit on the magnetic field in these structures @xmath446 , with the probable value expected in the range @xmath447 .",
    "the model predictions for magnetic fields in the diffuse shell are @xmath448 .        in summary ,",
    "the steepness of radio spectra of bright and compact structures in clumpy radio sources is not an indication of inefficient acceleration , but rather a natural consequence of very efficient acceleration which builds up high spatial gradients of relativistic electrons in those sources increasing the efficiency of spectral modifications due to their energy dependent escape .",
