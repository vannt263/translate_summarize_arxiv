    "one of the fundamental parameters characterising any stellar population is its mass function , and in particular its _ initial _ mass function ( imf ) , defined simply as the number of stars per unit mass that are actually formed in any system . determining the form of the imf is vital to our understanding of star formation in our own and other star - forming galaxies , since it allows us to model the chemical and physical evolution of these systems .    despite ongoing debate ( eg .",
    "leitherer 1998 ) it is not clear whether the imf varies widely between galaxies or even within different star formation regions of our own galaxy . since starburst galaxies are generally dusty , ir indicators of the imf are preferable since they provide considerable improvement in sensitivity since the extinction is lower than in the optical , and perhaps as important , any error in the derived extinction value has a correspondingly smaller effect on any observed line ratio when the lines are close in wavelength .",
    "indeed any method that relies on absolute flux values or widely separated line pairs is likely to lead to significant errors in the derived results when the extinction is large .",
    "there are limited methods for directly measuring the current imf from stellar features at these wavelengths , so indirect methods are required .",
    "most work has relied on inferring the nature of the stars present by comparing the ionisation structure of the enveloping nebular gas with the predictions of detailed photoionisation models .",
    "there has been extensive use of strong mid and far - ir forbidden line data in modelling hii regions in this fashion .",
    "however , such data is difficult to obtain for a large sample of galaxies , the atomic data is typically less certain for forbidden transitions and extinction corrections are complicated by the presence of the silicate absorption feature at 9.7@xmath1 m and our poor understanding of the extinction law at longer wavelengths .",
    "consequently there has not been widespread application of that method .",
    "given the problems inherent with the longer wavelength forbidden line data , it was natural that attention should turn instead to the near infrared .",
    "the brightest lines in general below 2.5@xmath1 m are permitted hi and hei lines . in principle",
    ", the comparison of hei and hi lines tests the relative volumes occupied by he@xmath5 and he@xmath6 relative to h@xmath6 , and hence places constraints on the form of the emergent uv radiation field shortwards of the hi lyman limit given the higher ionisation potential of helium .",
    "this is certainly true for any lines that arise solely from recombination .",
    "the brightest hei line longward of 1.1@xmath1 m is the 2.058@xmath1 m hei 2@xmath0p2@xmath0s transition .",
    "this has led to considerable attention being given to the use of the ratio of hei 2@xmath0p2@xmath0s with hi br@xmath3 at 2.166@xmath1 m ( eg .  doyon , puxley & joseph 1992 and references therein ) .",
    "however , the 2.058@xmath1 m hei 2@xmath0p2@xmath0s transition is determined by the population in the 2@xmath0p state .",
    "this is largely driven by resonance scattering of the 584  hei 2@xmath0p1@xmath0s transition rather than a simple recombination cascade .",
    "these resonance photons can be absorbed by dust or hydrogen reducing the population in the 2@xmath0p state .",
    "they also depend implicitly on the neutral helium fraction present since they are a resonance from the ground state .",
    "in addition , microscopic velocity structure can lead to a sufficient shift in the wavelength emitted so that the photon can not be reabsorbed by helium at all .",
    "initially it was thought that these secondary effects were relatively small and easily calculable .",
    "however , shields ( 1993 ) showed from a full photoionisation treatment that the strength of the 2@xmath0p2@xmath0s line was much more dependent than previously thought on the neutral helium fraction , and indeed predicted that as the stellar effective temperature , t@xmath7 , increases much beyond 40000k that this line actually gets weaker as most helium in the hii region is turned into he@xmath6 .",
    "more accurate atomic data and photoionisation models have confirmed this general picture ( ferland 1999 ) .",
    "observational confirmation of this prediction was evident from the extragalactic work of lumsden , puxley & doherty ( 1994 ) and doherty et al .",
    "( 1995 ) , and the study of planetary nebulae by depoy & shields ( 1994 ) . however , the former papers deal with complex clusters of ob stars for which we have no accurate knowledge of the effective temperature .",
    "the latter used slitless spectroscopy of extended planetary nebulae , resulting in very low resolution spectra in which only the brightest lines were visible .",
    "therefore , although we know the trend in the observed data appears to be in accord with the photoionisation models , there have been no attempts to really constrain the model results in any detail .    crucially , it was still unclear whether or not the hei 2@xmath0p2@xmath0s to hi br@xmath3 ratio can be used as a tracer of the high mass end of the imf .",
    "we therefore decided to carry out observations of objects whose stellar temperature could be defined more accurately than is the case for typical obscured compact hii regions .",
    "we observed a sample of 23 planetary nebulae ( pn ) to derive as full a set as possible of the observable line parameters for both the hei 2@xmath0p2@xmath0s line and hi br@xmath3 .",
    "pn are ideal for this test since they are predominantly excited by only a single central star ( unlike hii regions ) , and a sample covering a wider range of effective temperature is much easier to construct .",
    "our sample of pn was chosen ( i ) to be compact on the sky , ( ii ) to have good quality line measurements in the eso planetary nebula catalogue ( acker et al.1992 ) and ( iii ) to have a spread in ra to make observation easier . where possible we chose those objects with predicted stoy temperatures less than 60000k ( kaler & jacoby 1991 ) in preference to hotter objects , but the final sample contains a selection of pn with predicted temperatures well above this value as well .",
    "the sample is therefore largely heterogeneous , since our selection criteria do not really distinguish , for example , between nearby low temperature and luminosity pn , and more distant high excitation and luminosity pn .",
    "in addition , we did not impose any morphological selection on the sample , so there are objects ranging from spherical to bipolar present . for most of our sources",
    "there are no published peimbert types , and even those with published types are often contradictory . it is likely therefore that at least some of our objects are type i pn , with the consequence that they will probably have enhanced helium abundances ( eg peimbert & torres - peimbert 1983 ) . since we can not distinguish these pn accurately however , we do not split our sample into peimbert types .",
    "this is not a particular problem for this project however , since all we require is a set of pn with a reasonable spread in effective temperature , which are bright enough that we can derive line ratio measurements easily .",
    "we can test for abundance effects by examining the behaviour of the hei 2@xmath0p2@xmath0s line with other helium recombination lines .",
    "the only real problem with the inclusion of pn which are not spherical is that the photoionisation modelling reported in section 5 will not be an ideal match .",
    "we do not expect that this will significantly effect the conclusions we reach however .",
    "in addition to our own near infrared spectra we also sought high quality optical data in order to provide more accurate constraints on the photoionisation models .",
    "for the most part this comes from a search of the literature , and from the electronic catalogue of kaler , shaw & browning ( 1997 ) . for some of the pn in our sample we obtained low resolution 43007400  ccd spectra with the red arm of isis on the william herschel telescope on the night of 30 july 1996 in poor weather .",
    "this allowed us to check the reliability of the published data in the literature as well . in particular ,",
    "we have chosen not to rely on the fluxes from the acker et al.catalogue in our work beyond the aspect of sample selection wherever possible .",
    "the bright lines are often saturated , and the faint hei lines we require in our analysis are often undetected making the catalogue largely unsuitable if there is an alternative .",
    "we also excluded a large amount of the oldest ( pre-1980 ) data since there were clear indications that it disagreed completely with our own ccd data where there were objects in common .",
    "where necessary we placed all data onto a common extinction corrected intensity scale using the extinction law given in seaton ( 1979 ) . since all of the objects ( with the exception of crl  618 ) have low  moderate optical extinction , we also made the implicit assumption that @xmath8 in our analyses .",
    "since there are no direct means of determining the extinction from the near infrared data alone , we felt this was the safest option .",
    "assuming @xmath9leads to errors in the observed hei 2@xmath0p2@xmath0s to hi br@xmath3 ratio of @xmath10 or @xmath11 , which are essentially negligible for this sample .",
    "the complete sample is listed in table 1 .",
    "we give the optical references we have used there .",
    "also given there are the averaged fluxes of [ oiii ] 5007 , hei 6678  and heii 4686  relative to h@xmath12 taken from those references .",
    "we attribute 10% errors to the relatively weak 6678line , and 5% errors to the others , to account for potential differences in optical and infrared beamsizes when making comparisons of the actual lines .",
    "these errors are not included in the analysis of the optical data on its own , since there is no aperture effect to correct for . from these data",
    "we have calculated the stoy temperatures ( from the [ oiii]/h@xmath12 ratio and equation 1 of kaler & jacoby 1991 ) , electron densities ( from the [ sii ] 6717/6731  line ratio ) and electron temperature ( from either the [ oiii ] 4363/5007  ratio or the [ nii ] 5755/6548  ratio where these exist ) .",
    "these are also given in the table .",
    "although the density derived from the [ sii ] doublet is potentially unrepresentative of the density in the he@xmath6 region of the nebula , it is the only indicator that is available for the majority of our sample , and we therefore adopt it throughout .    unfortunately , as is clear from table 1 , we are lacking in pn with stoy temperatures between 40000 and 60000k .",
    "this was not clear at the time of observation since the predicted values from the eso planetary nebula catalogue ( acker et al . )",
    "did not show this effect .",
    "it is only with the adoption of higher quality , and more strictly global , flux values from the literature that it became obvious .",
    "we have included two objects whose identification as pn is uncertain , m  1 - 78 and crl  618 .",
    "the first of these is sometimes listed as a possible hii region , largely on grounds of excitation and extinction .",
    "however , there are other confirmed pn with similar characteristics so we have included it in our sample anyway .",
    "crl  618 is more strictly a proto - planetary nebula , since the central source is still obscured , and there is a clear bipolar outflow . since it will eventually become a pn however , we include it in our sample .",
    "it should be noted that the optical data for this object is generally from the bipolar lobes , so may not reflect the actual excitation of the core .",
    "we obtained separate low resolution k band spectra ( @xmath13 ) spanning @xmath141.92.5@xmath1 m , and high resolution echelle spectra around the 2.16@xmath1 m hi br@xmath3 and 2.058@xmath1 m hei 2@xmath0p2@xmath0s lines ( @xmath15 ) using cgs4 , the facility infrared spectrograph on the united kingdom infrared telescope .",
    "the data were mainly obtained on the nights of 8 and 9 january 1997 , but additional data were also obtained on 15 july 1995 , 27 and 28 september 1995 , and 4 , 5 and 6 july 1997 . in all cases",
    "we used a two pixel wide slit for the grating spectra , corresponding to 3 arcseconds on the sky .",
    "we used a one pixel wide slit for the echelle data to preserve the highest possible velocity resolution .",
    "proper sampling of the spectrum is obtained by stepping the array a fraction of a pixel between ` sub - exposures ' which are later combined in software to provide the final spectrum .",
    "anamorphic distortion within the spectrograph makes the width of the slit with the echelle grating close to 1 arcsecond .",
    "the separate echelle data of the two lines were obtained primarily for two reasons : first , to derive velocity profiles for the pn to test for the effects of turbulence on the hei 2@xmath0p2@xmath0s to hi br@xmath3 ratio as expected from theory ; second , as a means of correcting the low resolution fluxes obtained around 2.058@xmath1 m where there is a sequence of deep narrow atmospheric absorption lines due to co@xmath16 .",
    "however , the echelle data alone can not be used to derive reliable estimates of the ratio of the hi br@xmath3 and hei 2@xmath0p2@xmath0s lines because we used the narrowest possible slit to maximize the spectral resolution .",
    "this means that any small inaccuracy in positioning the telescope can have a significant impact on the derived line ratio given the compact nature of the pn .",
    "it is clearly preferable to derive ratios from lines observed in the same spectrum , so wherever possible we use the low resolution data for this .    the grating spectra were observed in a standard manner , nodding the telescope to keep the source always on the spectrograph slit .",
    "the beam separation was between 20 and 30 arcseconds for all data .",
    "the data were reduced by dividing by an internal flat field , and coadding all the nod pairs .",
    "the data obtained during january 1997 suffered from a problem with the slit mechanism which was tilted markedly relative to the axes of the array .",
    "these data were straightened to make the wavelength perpendicular to the columns of the array .",
    "the spectra were then extracted , and the negative beam subtracted from the initial positive one .",
    "this procedure ensures that residual sky contamination is minimal .",
    "the low resolution data were wavelength calibrated in the standard fashion using an argon arc lamp .",
    "flux calibration of the low resolution data was obtained using observations of a set of a - type stars from the bright star catalogue .",
    "we adopted @xmath17 corrections from johnson ( 1966 ) and used the @xmath18 magnitudes from the bright star catalogue itself .",
    "this technique is reliable in providing approximate absolute fluxes ( accurate to @xmath1430% ) and very good ( @xmath19% ) relative fluxes within each spectra which are sufficient for our requirements .",
    "the br@xmath3 absorption feature present in the a - type standards was interpolated over using a lorenzian line profile .",
    "the echelle data were largely obtained in a similar manner , with the exception of the 1997 data .",
    "the tilted slit in january 1997 meant that more than one echelle order was present in the final image , so that only the central 20 rows were actually useful for our observations .",
    "therefore we adopted the same strategy as used for mapping extended hii regions described in lumsden & hoare ( 1996 ) , and acquired only one ` sky ' frame for each set of up to 5 ` object ' frames .",
    "given the lack of strong sky lines near the emission lines from the pn this procedure provides a reasonable sky subtracted data - set .",
    "we used the same technique in july 1997 for simplicity .",
    "for all echelle data there is also a residual distortion in the wavelength calibration due to the fact that the projection of the slit onto the array is actually curved .",
    "we used oh night sky lines to ` straighten ' the spectra for this and the more extreme distortion caused by the tilted slit .",
    "we also used the oh lines to provide wavelength calibration for the br@xmath3 data .",
    "the hei data were calibrated using an internal argon arc lamp .",
    "we also acquired spectra of standard stars for the echelle to map the atmospheric absorption features .",
    "we used a type standards for the 2.058@xmath1 m data and k type for the 2.166@xmath1 m data , since both are relatively featureless in these wavelength ranges at high resolution . in practice",
    "there are only weak atmospheric absorption features around 2.166@xmath1 m so there is little problem with this data .",
    "however , around 2.058@xmath1 m the wavelength region is strongly attenuated by a sequence of deep narrow ( almost unresolved ) atmospheric absorption features due to co@xmath16 in the upper atmosphere .",
    "although the echelle data can be corrected for this absorption using the standard star observations it reveals a potential problem with the accuracy of the flux calibration in this narrow wavelength range for the low resolution data .",
    "the basic argument is simple : given a narrow emission line as seen in these pn , the actual data as observed through the telescope can range from almost unaffected by the atmospheric absorption to almost completely absorbed .",
    "however , the spectra of the standard stars as measured at low resolution average over these absorption features , so that the correction they give to the low resolution data is wrong in most cases .",
    "we used the basic procedures outlined by doherty et al .",
    "( 1994 ) to correct the observed low resolution hei 2@xmath0p2@xmath0s fluxes for this atmospheric attenuation .",
    "however , rather than using a model of the atmospheric absorption as they did we used the actual observed echelle standard star spectra .",
    "first we correct the echelle spectra for changes in the observed radial velocity due to the time of observation .",
    "the correction is then derived by smoothing the object and standard echelle spectra to the resolution of the grating data .",
    "the smoothed standard star spectrum is used to correct the smoothed pn echelle spectrum , and the flux of the hei line measured .",
    "the original pn echelle spectrum is corrected by the original standard star spectrum as well , and the flux measured of the full resolution data .",
    "the ratio of the measured fluxes from the full resolution data with the smoothed data then give the required correction factor .",
    "the actual values are given in table 2 .",
    "it is worth noting here that no such corrections were applied to the depoy and shields ( 1994 ) data , potentially leading to errors in their results of up to 30% from this factor alone .",
    "the spectra acquired with the echelle grating are shown in figures 1 and 2 .",
    "the full set of low resolution spectra will be published separately in a paper that discusses the other spectral features present . however , a representative sample showing the trend with effective temperature are shown in figure 3 . in all cases",
    "we have summed up the data over the whole object in forming these spectra .",
    "the observed hi br@xmath3 fluxes are listed in table 2 , along with the ratios of the strongest helium lines with br@xmath3 .",
    "the tabulated values of hei 2@xmath0p2@xmath0s against hi br@xmath3 are all corrected for atmospheric absorption using the method given in section 3 .",
    "all ratios are taken from the low resolution data with the exception of the hei 7@xmath20g4@xmath20f transition at 2.16475@xmath1 m , which was measured from the echelle spectra .",
    "this is the strongest of the hei satellite lines to br@xmath3 , and is visible in most of our echelle spectra .",
    "the ratio given for that line is against the observed br@xmath3 flux from our echelle spectra .",
    "this line can also be compared with the other hei lines , since they would all arise from the same region of the pn .",
    "it should not however be compared with the heii line strengths , since they will come from a different region in the pn , and the possible differences in slit position and size again may come into play .",
    "also visible in some of the br@xmath3 echelle spectra are the other hei transitions of 7@xmath21f4@xmath21d at 2.16229@xmath1 m and 7@xmath22f4@xmath22d at 2.16137@xmath1 m , and the heii 148 transition at 2.1653@xmath1 m .",
    "it should be noted that the low resolution br@xmath3 data have not been corrected for any underlying heii emission ( the bright satellite hei lines are sufficiently well resolved not to contribute to the measured fluxes ) .",
    "examination of the echelle spectra shows that these lines are insignificant for most of the sample , and even for the higher excitation pn contribute at most 5% of the flux .",
    "the one exception is hu  1 - 2 , which shows evidence for a bipolar flow and enhanced helium abundance indicating it may be a type i pn . for this case , the heii lines may contribute up to 10% of the observed low resolution br@xmath3 flux .",
    "we also used the echelle data to derive line widths for the hi br@xmath3 and hei 2@xmath0p2@xmath0s lines .",
    "we used gaussian fits in all cases .",
    "the results are given in table 3 .",
    "where the fit deviated noticeably from a single gaussian , we note this below in section 4.3 , and in the table by including the separate gaussian components required to achieve a good overall fit .",
    "we also measured the widths of isolated oh night sky lines to determine the instrumental resolution , since these lines are significantly narrower than this .",
    "the instrumental widths changed by no more than 10% between the different observing sessions ( the worst data being that obtained in january 1997 due to the problems with the slit mechanism ) . in all cases , the hei data is higher resolution than the equivalent br@xmath3 data .",
    "the intrinsic linewidth for each observation was derived assuming the intrinsic and instrumental widths added in quadrature .",
    "the values give in table 3 have been corrected for the instrumental resolution .      the observed linear correlation between the [ oiii ] 5007 / h@xmath12 line ratio and the stoy temperature found by kaler & jacoby ( 1991 ) implies that we can look for trends in our data in an entirely model independent fashion by examining the correlation between infrared line ratios and the [ oiii]/h@xmath12 ratio .",
    "the basic results of our survey then are shown in figure 4 .",
    "figure 4(a ) shows the ratio of the hei 7@xmath20g4@xmath20f and br@xmath3 against the [ oiii ] 5007 / h@xmath12 line ratio .",
    "the result is the expected one in the sense that the volume of the he@xmath6 region rises rapidly with effective temperature ( [ oiii ] line strength ) until it fills the entire pn . in figure 4(b ) we show the ratio of hei 2@xmath0p2@xmath0s and br@xmath3 against the [ oiii ] 5007 / h@xmath12 line ratio . here",
    "there is a much less well defined trend with increasing [ oiii]/h@xmath12 ratio , as expected if the results from previous photoionisation models are correct .",
    "in particular we note two key points : this ratio peaks at lower effective temperature than the hei 7@xmath20g4@xmath20f to br@xmath3 ratio and it decreases with increasing [ oiii]/h@xmath12 ratio beyond this peak , both of which are in accord with the models presented by ferland ( 1999 ) .",
    "we can test whether we have introduced any bias in these results from combining the optical data from the literature with our observed infrared data by further examining the behaviour of helium - to - hydrogen line ratios in the optical and infrared separately . in figure 5(a ) we plot the ratio of 6678  hei 3@xmath0d2@xmath0p transition with h@xmath12 against hei 7@xmath20g4@xmath20f with br@xmath3 . smits ( 1996 ) determined values of expected line emissivities for high-@xmath23 states such as the hei 7@xmath20g4@xmath20f lines , as well as the more common optical lines in the general recombination case , including collisional effects amongst the lowest levels .",
    "benjamin , skillman & smits ( 1999 ) expanded this treatment of the collisional effects to higher levels , and detail the resultant emissivities of the better known lines , but otherwise recover the same data for the pure recombination case .",
    "the two solid lines in figure 5(a ) show the full range of possible theoretical values for @xmath24@xmath25 and t@xmath26k from the smits ( 1996 ) data .",
    "all of the 3@xmath0d2@xmath0p and 7@xmath20g4@xmath20f lines should be dominated by recombination processes .",
    "line opacity and collisional excitation , which can affect the lower lying triplet states significantly , should be relatively unimportant here . figure 5(a )",
    "clearly indicates that this is the case , since there is a well defined linear relation between the two ratios which is in reasonable agreement with the predicted theoretical values .",
    "it is interesting to compare this with figure 5(b ) , in which we plot the same optical ratio against the ratio of hei 4@xmath20s3@xmath20p with br@xmath3 . again",
    "the straight lines show the expected theoretical values for the range @xmath24@xmath25 and t@xmath26k ( assuming no collisional excitation ) .",
    "there is a larger theoretical dispersion in this instance , largely due to a stronger dependence of the hei 4@xmath20s3@xmath20p line fluxes on electron temperature . despite this",
    ", there is a clear trend for some points to lie well away from the theoretical values , in the sense that the 4@xmath20s3@xmath20p blend is brighter than expected from recombination alone .",
    "these are clearly objects in which the population of the 4@xmath27s level of hei is enhanced",
    ". this can be due to either collisional excitation ( largely from 2@xmath27s4@xmath22s ) or opacity in the 2@xmath27s@xmath28p series ( leading to corresponding enhancements in the s ",
    "p series ) .",
    "the relative contribution of the two can be estimated from the atomic data ( eg lumsden & puxley 1996 ) and for the typical conditions of the pn in this survey they contribute almost equally since it is primarily density that drives both effects .",
    "the role of collisions have also been calculated more exactly for hei emission in general by benjamin , skillman & smits ( 1999 ) as noted above .",
    "they find enhancement of order 50% in the 4@xmath22s3@xmath22p line is possible for the physical conditions being considered , in accord with our data .",
    "the pn that lie away from the linear trend are obvious from table 2 from a comparison of the hei 4@xmath20s3@xmath20p and hei 7@xmath20g4@xmath20f fluxes , since these should be similar in the presence of recombination alone .",
    "however , there does not appear to be a clear correlation between these objects and their electron density as would be expected .",
    "this suggests that the estimated densities from the [ sii ] doublet are not entirely reliable . in particular ,",
    "all of the pn showing heii emission appear to show this effect . in such objects of course",
    "the s@xmath6 zone will lie at the edge of the nebula , which may not be representative of the nebula as a whole . in many cases",
    "there is evidence for higher densities in the literature , as estimated from [ oii ] lines .",
    "this is consistent with the simple model in which the [ sii ] emission arises at the edge of the nebula since o@xmath6 has a higher ionisation potential than s@xmath6 .",
    "as noted in the introduction purely local velocity broadening of the 5842@xmath0s1@xmath0s hei resonance line can reduce the likelihood of absorption by neutral helium ( cf ferland 1999 ) , and hence reduce the ratio of the hei 2@xmath0p2@xmath0s and hi be@xmath3 lines . in the on - the - spot approximation for emission and absorption of this resonance line , only local broadening processes count , since no 584  photon will travel a sufficient distance for a global velocity field to be an important factor .",
    "we therefore need a measure of the local broadening if we are to compare our data with the correct photoionisation model .",
    "therefore we have assumed a simple model to decompose the observed line width into local and global velocity broadening with the pn .",
    "we assume that the intrinsic line width is determined by three possible factors : the expansion velocity of the nebula , the thermal line width , and turbulence , the first of these being the only purely global broadening mechanism .",
    "we also assume that the expansion velocity has a particularly simple form , namely a constant value everywhere in the nebula .",
    "although unrealistic in practice , the variation in expansion velocity is generally sufficiently small that we can ignore it here .",
    "the profile locally will appear gaussian , with the broadening as given by equation 2 below .",
    "along a line of sight directly through the centre of the shell we would then see the classic split line profile composed of two gaussians offset from each other by twice the expansion velocity .",
    "however since the the objects are compact ( mostly unresolved ) on the sky we see total velocity field in the beam .",
    "the velocity profile is ` infilled ' from those regions of the nebula where the velocity field is more perpendicular to the line of sight than tangential , so that the double profile will not be evident in the actual observed data .",
    "if we integrate this velocity profile over the whole extent of the pn , then we can derive the observed profile , which is given by ( for an unresolved source ) @xmath29 @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the emissivity as a function of position in the nebula ( which we assume here is constant ) , @xmath32 is the expansion velocity so that @xmath33 if @xmath34 is the vector defining our line - of - sight , and @xmath35 for a nominal t@xmath36k , and no turbulence , @xmath37kms@xmath38 for hi and @xmath39kms@xmath38 for hei . in the absence of expansion , the line profile will be gaussian , and the broadening is given solely by equation 2 .    for most of the objects considered here ,",
    "the actual derived profile is sufficiently similar to a gaussian that we can not uniquely determine the split between turbulence and global expansion .",
    "we can estimate the thermal line width directly from the derived electron temperature in each region to remove that uncertainty . in practice",
    "therefore the best discrimination comes from a comparison of the differences in the observed widths for the hi and hei lines .",
    "we calculated the widths of the lines for varying values of v@xmath40 and v@xmath41 and sought the ` best ' match from this grid of data .",
    "an example for t@xmath36k is shown in figure 6 .",
    "for the hi and hei separately we find the set of curves that match the observed data . these then give the derived v@xmath41 and v@xmath40 values shown in table 4 . since a family of curves is possible in almost all cases only upper limits to v@xmath41 and v@xmath40 can be derived .",
    "clearly , however , these are not joint limits , since when v@xmath41 is large v@xmath40 must be small and vice - versa .",
    "for some of the objects there is a discrepancy between the values derived from the hi and hei lines . in some cases",
    "this is due to the fact that the he@xmath6 and h@xmath6 zones do not overlap because the effective temperature of the exciting star is too low .",
    "for these objects we use the limits on the hei line alone . for a small sample of objects",
    "there are no reliable solutions within the context of our simple model .",
    "comments on these objects are given below , together with other notes on individual pn .",
    "bd+30@xmath423639 : there is considerable structure in bd+30@xmath423639 ( cf sahai & trauger 1998 ) .",
    "the split in the two components seen in the hei line give v@xmath43kms@xmath38 in terms of our simple model , so no turbulent broadening is required .",
    "this expansion velocity is not however compatible with the hi line data .",
    "it seems likely that our simple model is not a good approximation for this source .",
    "however , even given this , there appears little need to invoke a large turbulent velocity component .",
    "crl  618 : the spectra acquired for this paper were centred on the brighter of the two outflow lobes visible in the optical .",
    "the actual hii region is in fact completely obscured at optical wavelengths .",
    "our data agree with previous published near infrared data ( hora , latter & deutsch 1999 ) , which also seems to have been centred on the visible lobe rather than the actual core .",
    "we have further low resolution data that will be published separately of the core showing strong hi emission , and stronger hei emission than present in the lobes .",
    "however , since we have only obtained echelle spectra of the lobe position we only quote the result for the hi and hei line strengths there .",
    "it is possible that most of the emission we detect in the lobes is actually scattered light from the obscured central regions , since crl  618 is known to have significant polarisation .",
    "trammell , dinerstein & goodrich ( 1993 ) show that , in the optical , all the recombination lines and high excitation forbidden lines are scattered into our line of sight .",
    "we therefore do not attempt to determine turbulent or expansion components to the velocity from the observed data ( which would imply very large velocities ) , and for sake of the photoionisation model simply assume v@xmath4410kms@xmath38 .",
    "hu  1 - 2 : this object shows clear signs of a bipolar outflow in the echelle spectra , rather than straightforward expansion , since the velocity field flips from red to blue shifted moving south across the position of the central star .",
    "the double peaked line profile that results is clearly visible in both echelle spectra .",
    "the difference in line width probably reflects a differing acceleration in the he@xmath45 and he@xmath46 zones in the outflow .",
    "the observed widths limit v@xmath4710kms@xmath38 .",
    "m  1 - 1 : only a two component gaussian fit gave a good match to the data .",
    "the velocity separation of the two peaks is @xmath1458kms@xmath38 , indicating an expansion velocity of @xmath1430kms@xmath38 .",
    "the predicted turbulent velocity component is then small , since most of the remaining line broadening must be thermal . because of the weakness of the hei 2@xmath0p2@xmath0s line in the low resolution data we did not observe this object with the echelle at 2.058@xmath1 m .",
    "there are no satellite hei lines visible in the br@xmath3 data either .",
    "ngc  7027 : this is the only one of our sample to show spatially resolvable velocity structure .",
    "the structure most closely resembles an expanding shell in agreement with the radio data of roelfsema et al .",
    "given this we can further limit the velocity components so that v@xmath48kms@xmath38 and v@xmath4710kms@xmath38 .",
    "we used cloudy version 90.05 ( ferland 1996 ) to model the emission line spectra for a grid of pn with differing physical parameters .",
    "the main parameters we considered were effective temperature , central star luminosity , electron density and the velocity structure .",
    "all models used the standard cloudy planetary nebula abundances with their corresponding dust grain abundance .",
    "we considered effective temperatures in the range 25000150000k .",
    "we used two sets of model atmospheres .",
    "first , to ensure that we have the same model for all temperatures , we used a simple blackbody approximation .",
    "then , to test whether a different model might affect the results , we used the standard kurucz ( 1992 ) models with @xmath49 for the more restrictive temperature range of 25000 - 50000k .",
    "the only alternative models of stellar atmospheres potentially applicable to low effective temperature pn in the version of cloudy used are due to mihalas ( 1972 ) .",
    "we did not consider these however when it became clear that the blackbody models were a sufficiently good match to our data ( see section 5.2 ) .",
    "there is observational and theoretical evidence that pn central stars with low effective temperatures all have approximately the same bolometric luminosity .",
    "observational evidence comes from studies of pn in the magellanic clouds ( cf figure 11 in dopita et al .",
    "the theoretical model tracks of vassiliadis & wood ( 1993 ) also show that below 50000k there is little dispersion in the luminosity - effective temperature domain . from vassiliadis & wood ( 1993 )",
    "we adopt a value of 5000  as a mean bolometric luminosity , but consider 3000 and 7000  as well , since these match the spread in the range of observed and theoretical values for pn central stars below about 100000k .",
    "the range of electron density and turbulent / expansion velocity considered are taken directly from the observed data .",
    "we computed models with @xmath503000 , 6000 , 12000 , 24000 and 48000@xmath25 , and v@xmath510 , 5 , 10 and 15kms@xmath38 .",
    "lesser effects that need to be considered are due to metallicity / abundance and the final radius chosen .",
    "this latter parameter is really only important for the pn with hot central stars , since , for small outer radii , the nebula can be density rather than ionisation bounded , resulting in reduced he@xmath6 zones .",
    "this is apparent in some of the observed data for those pn with hot central stars .",
    "since it only affects the high temperature end of the models , we adopt @xmath52pc as an appropriate value for our sample ( cf the values in cahn , kaler & stanghellini 1992 ) , and accept that this may mean that we overestimate the model hei line strength at high effective temperature .",
    "the inner radius has little effect on the strengths of the lines we are interested in , and we adopt @xmath53pc .",
    "we do not consider metallicity effects further here , since there is no direct evidence from the observational data that it is a significant effect .",
    "for example , dddm  1 is a known halo pn , which has lower metallicity than the other pn in the sample , but whose helium - to - hydrogen line ratios show little deviance from the rest of the sample .",
    "our selection used the relation between the [ oiii ] 5007  to h@xmath12 ratio and stoy temperatures for the pn central stars as derived by kaler and jacoby ( 1991 ) to determine approximate stellar effective temperatures for our sample .",
    "however , these temperatures are not completely reliable measures of the actual underlying t@xmath7 , since the method is only sensitive to effective temperatures below 60000k .",
    "this can be seen clearly in figure 7 , where we show the original data used by kaler & jacoby , together with their fit to the same data , and the results from our photoionisation modelling .",
    "it is encouraging that the blackbody stellar models reproduce the spread in the observed data reasonably well . in this case",
    "it appears that the identification of the underlying effective temperature with the stoy temperature is sound up to 60000k .",
    "this is in spite of the fact that a black body is not a good match to the actual spectrum of a pn central star .",
    "however , previous workers have also found that their use gives a good match between model and observation ( cf .  the discussion in dopita & meatheringham 1991 ) .",
    "by comparison , the kurucz model atmospheres which are shown as the dashed line in figure 7 do not reproduce the observed relation at all , particularly at the lower end of our effective temperature range ( note also that the kurucz models only exist for t@xmath5450000k ) .",
    "we therefore did not consider the further use of these models .",
    "the primary mechanism giving rise to the spread in [ oiii ] 5007  to h@xmath12 ratio at a fixed temperature is the electron density .",
    "collisional enhancement at a fixed temperature can change the ratio by 30% over the range of densities considered ( the largest value of the ratio occurring at @xmath55@xmath25 ; at higher values the ratio declines again ) , whereas the central star luminosity contributes at most a 15% change , and the velocity structure is essentially irrelevant .    as can be seen , the [ oiii]/h@xmath12 ratio rises almost linearly with temperature , as the o@xmath56 region in the nebula increases in size , until about t@xmath5760000k .",
    "however , beyond this temperature , the o@xmath56 region saturates , and eventually decreases with increasing t@xmath7 as o@xmath58 becomes dominant . in addition",
    ", for our sample of compact pn , it is possible that the nebula is density rather than ionisation bounded .",
    "this effect tends to become significant for temperatures above that at which the he@xmath45 region first appears ( @xmath59 ) . for a compact nebula , the available gas reservoir at this point may be less than that required to absorb all the emitted radiation below 912 . in this case , the flux from the lower ionisation species near the edge of the nebula will clearly drop first .",
    "the effect is the same as that which leads to the well known difference between hydrogen and helium zanstra temperatures in pn at high temperature ( cf kaler & jacoby 1991 and references therein ) .",
    "therefore for those pn showing evidence of heii emission we deduced a calibration between the 4686  heii line strength and t@xmath7 from the models .",
    "first , we extended the effective temperature range by calculating a small set of models spanning the range 150000400000k , with l@xmath605000 , @xmath61@xmath25 and v@xmath515kms@xmath38 .",
    "variations in the luminosity and density lead to changes of less than 25% in the 4686  heii to h@xmath12 ratio .",
    "we interpolated these data to find effective temperatures for the real pn .",
    "there was one problem with this approach , since the model heii 4686  to h@xmath12 ratio never increased beyond 0.55 ( near 300000k : again this is a reflection of the fact that the he@xmath45 zone is now becoming density bounded ) .",
    "three of our pn show values larger than this however .",
    "this may be a reflection of either a density bounded nebula or non spherical geometry .",
    "for the sake of this paper we simply ascribe to these pn a lower limit on the effective temperature of 250000k .    in figure 8",
    "we show how the hei 2@xmath0p2@xmath0s to hi br@xmath3 ratio varies as a function of effective temperature .",
    "we have explicitly split the dependence on ( a ) density , ( b ) turbulent velocity and ( c ) stellar luminosity to show how the ratio is affected by each .",
    "the results are as expected",
    ". the ratio increases with increasing density because of collisions from the metastable 2@xmath0s state enhancing the population of the 2@xmath0p state .",
    "as the microscopic velocity width increases , the 584  2@xmath0p1@xmath0s resonance line weakens , leading to a decrease in the population of the 2@xmath0p state . as the stellar luminosity increases the ionisation parameter at the inner edge of the cloud also increases , leading to a marginal increase in the he@xmath45 region compared to a lower luminosity star , once that star is hot enough to actually excite this state , and a decline in the fraction of he@xmath5 and he@xmath6 .",
    "since he@xmath5 is required to scatter the 584  photons , the direct consequence is a reduction in the ratio for effective temperatures beyond about 40000k . from figure 8",
    "it is also clear that the models with the ` extreme ' high and low ratios are those with high density , and low turbulent velocity and central star luminosity and low density , and high turbulent velocity and central star luminosity respectively .",
    "since the luminosity dependence is only weak however , we will ignore it in the following , and consider only our mean central star luminosity of l@xmath62 .",
    "all of the strong hi and hei lines are calculated directly by cloudy , but the two weaker k band hei lines are not .",
    "since the 2.16475@xmath1 m 7@xmath20g4@xmath20f line must be dominated by recombination processes , and the 6678  3@xmath0d2@xmath0p is known to be ( eg benjamin et al .",
    "1999 ) , the ratio of these two lines must in theory be roughly constant .",
    "figure 5(a ) shows that this is true observationally .",
    "we can therefore use the data from smits ( 1996 ) to correct the model 6678  flux into a model 2.16475@xmath1 m flux .",
    "the actual correction for t@xmath36k and @xmath63@xmath25 is that the model hei 7@xmath20g4@xmath20f to hi br@xmath3 ratio is 1.23 times the model hei 3@xmath0d2@xmath0p to h@xmath12 ratio ( where we have also used the data on hi from storey & hummer 1995 ) .",
    "this values rises to 1.31 for t@xmath64k and @xmath63@xmath25 .",
    "the value depends only slightly on electron density but much more strongly on electron temperature .",
    "unfortunately , the behaviour of the 2.113@xmath1 m 4@xmath20s3@xmath20p line is not as simple to translate from the cloudy results , given the comments in section 4.2 .",
    "we therefore chose not to compare it to the model , but rather to use its ratio with the 7@xmath20g4@xmath20f line as an indicator of collisional or line opacity effects , and hence of high electron density ( @xmath65@xmath25 ) .",
    "as noted in section 4.2 , these objects can be found in table 2 by a comparison of the hei 4@xmath20s3@xmath20p and 7@xmath20g4@xmath20f fluxes . objects with significantly larger 4@xmath20s3@xmath20p fluxes than 7@xmath20g4@xmath20f fluxes must have enhanced 4@xmath22s populations , and hence high electron density .    in figure 9(a ) we plot the observed hei 7@xmath20g4@xmath20f to hi br@xmath3 ratio and in figure 9(b ) the observed hei 6678  3@xmath0d2@xmath0p to h@xmath12 ratio as taken from the literature .",
    "we also plot a typical result from our photoionisation models ( the actual results change by less than 5% as a function of density , luminosity or velocity , and 10% as a function of electron temperature ) .",
    "we have not labelled the individual pn here since clearly both sets of data are in good agreement with the models .",
    "therefore we can be confident that the ratio of a pure recombination hei and hi line does behave in the fashion expected , and that such a ratio could be used as a measure of effective temperature in the 3040000k range .",
    "in figure 10 we plot the observed hei 2@xmath0p2@xmath0s to hi br@xmath3 ratio against effective temperature ( taken to be the greater of t(stoy ) or t(heii ) from table 1 ) .",
    "the solid lines are the model results for the ` extreme ' models for a central star with a luminosity of 5000  as discussed in the previous section .",
    "the lower curve is a model with @xmath66@xmath25 and v@xmath67kms@xmath38 and the upper curve is a model with @xmath68@xmath25 and v@xmath69kms@xmath38 .",
    "we have labelled the individual pn to make identification easy .",
    "we have compressed the temperature scale to show the detail at t@xmath70k , but note that the high excitation pn that are not plotted all lie above the predicted model curve . finally in figure 11 we plot the observed hei 2@xmath0p2@xmath0s to hei 7@xmath20g4@xmath20f ratio , since this removes any metallicity dependence .",
    "we have plotted the same models as in figure 10 .    from figure 10",
    ", it is clear that the models systematically underpredict most of the high effective temperature pn .",
    "these objects do show evidence for high density ( either from their [ sii ] ratios , or from the strength of the hei 4@xmath20s3@xmath20p line ) .",
    "some must have low turbulent velocities ( m  1 - 20 for example ) , but there does not appear to be a clear trend of the ratio with this parameter ( remembering from figure 8 that even turbulent velocities at the 10kms@xmath38 level will suppress the hei 2@xmath0p2@xmath0s line by 25% at high t@xmath7 ) . indeed",
    "3 of the sources shown in figure 10 and 11 ( m  1 - 20 , k  3 - 62 and m  1 - 4 ) lie above the maximum predicted theoretical values for the ratios shown , and the same trends also carry through to the higher effective temperature pn not plotted in figures 10 and 11 . from figure 11",
    "it is also clear that enhanced helium abundance can not explain the observed data for these objects , since they also tend to lie above the model predictions there . for effective temperatures near and above 60000k",
    "it is also clear from figure 8 that density has only a small role in determining the hei 2@xmath0p2@xmath0s line strength .",
    "therefore higher density than that used in our modelling is also unlikely to account for these data .",
    "the only obvious explanation for all these results is that the population of the hei 2@xmath0p level is not as small for these pn as predicted by cloudy .",
    "it is not the ionisation structure that is wrong though , since the model does predict the strength of the neutral [ oi ] 6300  line correctly ( at a level between 1 and 5% of h@xmath12 for these pn ) .",
    "therefore it seems that the only alternative is that the hei ly@xmath71 destruction probability as used in cloudy is an overestimate ( see ferland 1999 for a fuller discussion of this factor ) .",
    "the behaviour of the low temperature pn ( those with t@xmath5428000k ) may be easier to understand .",
    "three of the five objects sit within the model bounds , though they again show deviations from the model since bd+30@xmath423639 should have high density and no turbulence , yet is the lowest of the three .",
    "more importantly , two objects lie below the predicted ratio .",
    "for all these objects we must of course be cautious as to whether the temperature scale is accurate . a shift of 3000k in temperature ( the effective error on the kaler & jacoby relation ) , would be sufficient to explain all the data .",
    "it should also be borne in mind that we may have ` errant ' observational values for crl 618 given the comments in section 4.3 .",
    "also these pn are unlikely to be well matched by black body stellar atmospheres ( bd+30@xmath423639 is a wc star after all ) . the predicted ratio from the kurucz models we calculated dropped off more sharply with decreasing effective temperature for example ( in the same sense that the [ oiii]/h@xmath12 ratio declines more sharply than for a black body stellar atmosphere , as shown in figure 7 ) .",
    "finally we come to the group of objects between 28000 and 40000k .",
    "again there seems to be no direct correlation between the limits on the turbulent velocities and the observed line ratio in contradiction with the models .",
    "the two most discrepant points here though are m  1 - 6 and m  1 - 14 . at least for the these",
    "there is observational evidence for moderately high density .",
    "m  1 - 6 may simply have the wrong assigned effective temperature as well , since it is the only object for which we have had to rely on the acker et al .",
    "( 1992 ) catalogue for the 5007  [ oiii ] flux .",
    "in addition , there is some evidence here for an enhanced helium abundance , since figure 11 shows that some of the pn that sit above the maximum model value in figure 10 lie well within the model boundaries of the hei 2@xmath0p2@xmath0s to hei 7@xmath20g4@xmath20f ratio .",
    "m  1 - 6 , m  1 - 9 and m  1 - 14 are possible examples where this is true ( and we note that the first two of these pn are listed as having large helium abundances , and being peimbert type i objects , by shibata & tamura 1985 ) .",
    "we also note however that there are other objects with similar effective temperatures that have even higher observed hei 2@xmath0p2@xmath0s to hi br@xmath3 ratios than m  1 - 14 , such as the ultracompact hii region , g45.12 + 0.13 , which again has high density ( lumsden & puxley 1996 ) .",
    "therefore , two plausible arguments present themselves here : either there is some enhancement to the helium abundance over the 10% assumed in our modelling ( as might be expected for peimbert type i pn ) or the population of the hei 2@xmath0p level is collisionally enhanced above the maximum values derived using cloudy ( perhaps due to the limited number of triplet states considered in cloudy ) . at these values of the effective temperature",
    "however there is no need to invoke a change in the hei ly@xmath71 destruction probability .",
    "it is clear from the results we have presented here that the behaviour of the hei 2@xmath0p2@xmath0s line is sufficiently complex that it is not a reliable indicator of stellar effective temperature .",
    "the variation of 30% or more in both observed and model predictions for a fixed temperature mean that only a very general picture of the effective temperature can be gained from this ratio .",
    "it is possible that in certain restricted circumstances , such as objects with known density and turbulent velocity fields , that it may provide secondary information about the effective temperature however .",
    "figure 11 provides an example of how it might be used in combination with another hei recombination line to constrain the temperature of objects above 40000k , where the hei / hi recombination line ratio alone is no longer varying rapidly .",
    "however , for this to be reliable the discrepancies between model and data seen in our results will need to be explained .",
    "there are factors that we have not accounted for that may help explain some of observations .",
    "a change in the dust - to - gas ratio , clumping within the ionised gas or a density rather than ionisation bounded nebula could plausibly explain some of the discrepancies we see .",
    "we would certainly not recommend the use of this line however as a primary indicator of stellar effective temperature .",
    "by contrast , the behaviour of the hei 7@xmath20g4@xmath20f line , which should be due solely to recombination , is as expected , and in agreement with the models .",
    "although this line is not in itself of particular value , since it is blended with hi br@xmath3 at intermediate spectral resolution , it does show that the use of such hei lines is in accord with the original intent of doyon et al .",
    "in particular , the 1.7007@xmath1 m 4@xmath22d3@xmath22p transition is also expected to be due mostly to recombination , is in a clear part of the atmospheric h band window , and is well separated from other emission lines .",
    "this line has been discussed in the past in this context ( eg , lumsden & puxley 1996 , vanzi & rieke 1997 ) .",
