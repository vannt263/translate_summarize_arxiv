    "among biometrics , fingerprints are probably the best - known and widespread because of the fingerprint properties : universality , durability and individuality .",
    "unfortunately it has been shown that fingerprint scanners are vulnerable to presentation attacks with an artificial replica of a fingerprint .",
    "therefore , it is important to develop countermeasures to those attacks .",
    "numerous methods have been proposed to solve the susceptibility of fingerprint devices to attacks by spoof fingers .",
    "one primary countermeasure to spoofing attacks is called `` liveness detection '' or presentation attack detection .",
    "liveness detection is based on the principle that additional information can be garnered above and beyond the data procured and/or processed by a standard verification system , and this additional data can be used to verify if an image is authentic .",
    "liveness detection uses either a hardware - based or software - based system coupled with the authentication program to provide additional security .",
    "hardware - based systems use additional sensors to gain measurements outside of the fingerprint image itself to detect liveness .",
    "software - based systems use image processing algorithms to gather information directly from the collected fingerprint to detect liveness .",
    "these systems classify images as either live or fake .",
    "since 2009 , in order to assess the main achievements of the state of the art in fingerprint liveness detection , university of cagliari and clarkson university organized the first fingerprint liveness detection competition .",
    "the first international fingerprint liveness detection competition ( livdet ) 2009 @xcite , provided an initial assessment of software systems based on the fingerprint image only . the second",
    ", third and fourth liveness detection competitions ( livdet 2011 @xcite , 2013 @xcite and 2015 @xcite ) were created in order to ascertain the progressing state of the art in liveness detection , and also included integrated system testing .",
    "this paper reviews the previous livdet competitions and how they have evolved over the years .",
    "section 2 of this paper describes the background of spoofing and liveness detection .",
    "section 3 details the methods used in testing for the livdet competitions as well as descriptions of the datasets that have generated from the competition so far .",
    "section 4 discusses the trends across the competitions reflecting advances in the state of the art .",
    "section 5 concludes the paper and discusses the future of the livdet competitions .",
    "the concept of spoofing has existed for some time now .",
    "research into spoofing can be seen beginning in 1998 from research conducted by d. willis and m. lee where six different biometric fingerprint devices were tested against fake fingers and it was found that four of the six were susceptible to spoofing attacks @xcite .",
    "this research was approached again in 2000 - 2002 by multiple institutions including ; putte and kuening as well as matsumoto et al .",
    "putte et al .",
    "examined different types of scanning devices as well as different ways of counterfeiting fingerprints @xcite .",
    "the research presented by these researchers looked at the vulnerability of spoofing . in 2001 , kallo ( et al . )",
    "looked at a hardware solution to liveness detection ; while in 2002 , schuckers delved into using software approaches for liveness detection @xcite .",
    "liveness detection , with either hardware - based or software - based systems , is used to check if a presented fingerprint originates from a live person or an artificial finger . usually the result of this analysis is a score used to classify images as either live or fake .",
    "many solutions have been proposed to solve the vulnerability of spoofing @xcite .",
    "bozhao tan et al .",
    "has proposed a solution based on ridge signal and valley noise analysis @xcite .",
    "this solution examines the perspiration patterns along the ridge and the patterns of noise in the valleys of images @xcite .",
    "it was proposed that since live fingers sweat , but spoof fingers do not , the live fingerprint will look `` patchy '' compared to a spoof @xcite .",
    "also it was proposed that due to the properties of a spoof material , spoof fingers will have granules in the valleys that live fingers will not have @xcite .",
    "pietro coli et al .",
    "examined static and dynamic features of collected images on a large data set of images @xcite .",
    "there are two general forms of creating artificial fingers , the cooperative method and non - cooperative method . in the cooperative method",
    "the subject pushes their finger into a malleable material such as dental impression material , plastic , or wax creating a negative impression of the fingerprint as a mold , see figure [ fig : mold ] .",
    "the mold is then filled with a material , such as gelatin , playdoh or silicone .",
    "this cast can be used to represent a finger from a live subject , see figure [ fig : fakefinger ] .",
    "the non - cooperative method involves enhancing a latent fingerprint left on a surface , digitizing it through the use of a photograph , and finally printing the negative image on a transparency sheet .",
    "this printed image can then be made into a mold , for example , by etching the image onto a printed circuit board ( pcb ) which can be used to create the spoof cast as seen on figure [ fig : latentpcb ] .",
    "most competitions focus on matching , such as the fingerprint verification competition held in 2000 , 2002 , 2004 and 2006 @xcite and the icb competition on iris recognition ( icir2013 ) @xcite .",
    "however , these competitions did not consider spoofing .",
    "the liveness detection competition series was started in 2009 and created a benchmark for measuring liveness detection algorithms , similar to matching performance . at that time , there had been no other public competitions held that has examined the concept of liveness detection as part of a biometric modality in deterring spoof attacks . in order to understand the motivation of organizing such a competition",
    ", we observed that the first trials to face with this topic were often carried out with home - made data sets that were not publicly available , experimental protocols were not unique , and the same reported results were obtained on very small data sets .",
    "we pointed out these issues in @xcite .",
    "therefore , the basic goal of livdet has been since its birth to allow researchers testing their own algorithms and systems on publicly available data sets , obtained and collected with the most updated techiques to replicate fingerprints enabled by the experience of clarkson and cagliari laboratories , both active on this problem since 2000 and 2003 , respectively .",
    "at the same time , using a  competition \" instead of simply releasing data sets , could be assurance of a free - of - charge , third - party testing using a sequestered test set .",
    "( clarkson and cagliari has never took part in livdet as competitors , due to conflict of interest . )    livdet 2009 provided results which demonstrated the state of the art at that time @xcite for fingerprint systems .",
    "livdet continued in 2011 , 2013 and 2015 @xcite and contained two parts : evaluation of software - based systems in part 1 : algorithms , and evaluation of integrated systems in part 2 : systems .",
    "fingerprint will be the focus of this paper . however , livdet 2013 also included a part 1 : algorithms for the iris biometric @xcite and is continuing in 2015 .",
    "since 2009 , evaluation of spoof detection for facial systems was performed in the competition on counter measures to 2-d facial spoofing attacks , first held in 2011 and then held a second time in 2013 .",
    "the purpose of this competition is to address different methods of detection for 2-d facial spoofing @xcite .",
    "the competition dataset consisted of 400 video sequences , 200 of them real attempts and 200 attack attempts @xcite .",
    "a subset was released for training and then another subset of the dataset was used for testing purposes .    [ cols=\"<,>,>,>,>,>,>,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     table [ tab : easynessdegree ] shows the subjective evaluation on the easiness of obtaining a good spoof from the combination of the same materials of table [ tab : qualitydegree ] .",
    "this evaluation depends on the solidification time of the adopted material , the level of difficulty in separating mold and cast without destroying one of them or both , the natural dryness or wetness level of the related spoof .",
    "tables [ tab : qualitydegree ] , [ tab : easynessdegree ] show that , from a practical viewpoint , many materials are difficult to manage when fabricating a fake finger . in many cases , the materials with this property",
    "also exhibit a low subjective quality level .",
    "therefore , thanks to this lesson , the livdet competition challenge participants with images coming from the spoofs obtained with the best and most `` potentially dangerous '' materials .",
    "the materials choice is made on the basis of the best trade off between the criteria pointed out in tables [ tab : qualitydegree ] , [ tab : easynessdegree ] and the objective quality values output by quality assessment algorithms such as nfiq .",
    "what reported has been confirmed along the four livdet editions .",
    "in particular the ferrfake and ferrlive rates for each differing quality levels support the idea that the images quality level is correlated with the error rate decrease .",
    "the error rates for each range of quality levels for dermalog in livdet 2011 fingerprint part 1 : algorithms is shown in figure [ fig : ferrderm ] , as an example .",
    "the graphs showcase from images of only quality level 1 up to all quality levels being shown .",
    "as lower quality spoof images were added , ferrfake generally decreased .",
    "for all images which included the worst quality images , the error rates were less consistent likely due to the variability in low quality spoofs .",
    "the percentage of images at each quality level for two representative datasets for livdet 2011 , 2013 , and 2015 , respectively , are given in figures [ fig : imageperc ] , [ fig : spoofperc ] , and [ fig : quality2015 ] .",
    "the crossmatch dataset had high percentages of the data being in the top two quality levels in both livdet 2011 and 2013 .",
    "the swipe dataset had many images that were read as being of lower quality which could be seen in the data itself because of the difficulty in collecting spoof data on the swipe device .",
    "since its first edition in 2009 , the fingerprint liveness detection competition was aimed to allow research centres and companies a fair and independent assessment of their anti - spoofing algorithms and systems .    we have seen over time an increasing interest for this event , and the general recognition for the enormous amount of data made publicly available .",
    "the number of citations that livdet competitions have collected is one of the tangible signs of such interest ( about 100 citations according to google scholar ) and further demonstrates the benefits that the scientific community has received from livdet events .",
    "the competition results show that liveness detection algorithms and systems strongly improved their performance : from about 70% classification accuracy achieved in livdet 2011 , to 90% classification accuracy in livdet 2015 .",
    "this result , obtained under very difficult conditions like the ones of the consensual methodology of fingerprints replication , is comparable with that obtained in livdet 2013 ( first two data sets ) , where the algorithms performance was tested under the easier task of fingerprints replication from latent marks .",
    "moreover , the two challenges characterizing the last edition , namely , the presence of 1000 dpi capture device and the evaluation against  unknown \" spoofing materials , further contributed to show the great improvement that researchers achieved on these issues : submitted algorithms performed very well on both 500 and 1000 dpi capture devices , and some of them also exhibited a good robustness degree against never - seen - before attacks .",
    "results reported on fusion also shows that the liveness detection could further benefit from the combination of multiple features and approaches . a specific section on algorithms and systems fusion",
    "might be explicitly added to a future livdet edition .",
    "there is a dark side of the moon , of course .",
    "it is evident that , despite the remarkable results reported in this paper , there is a clear need of further improvements .",
    "current performance for most submissions are not yet good enough for embedding a liveness detection algorithm into fingerprint verification system where the error rate is still too high for many real applications . in the authors opinion , discovering and explaining benefits and limitations of the currently used features is still an issue whose solution should be encouraged , because only the full understanding of the physical process which leads to the finger s replica and what features extraction process exactly does will shed light on the characteristics most useful for classification .",
    "we are aware that this is a challenging task , and many years could pass before seeing concrete results .",
    "however , we believe this could be the next challenge for a future edition of livdet , the fingerprint liveness detection competition .",
    "the first and second author had equal contributions to the research . this work has been supported by the center for identification technology research and the national science foundation under grant no .",
