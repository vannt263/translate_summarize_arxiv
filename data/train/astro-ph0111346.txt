    "that the absorption increases quickly with redshift is not by itself surprising : ionization equilibrium tells us that the neutral hydrogen density is proportional to the gas density squared , which is proportional to @xmath7 at the cosmic mean . the evolution of the ionizing background and gas temperature will modify this redshift dependence , but the rapid evolution of absorption remains a robust outcome . what is interesting , as becker et al .",

    "these predictions allow us to directly infer the neutral fraction of the igm from the observed absorption ( the relation between the two depends on the nature of clustering of the igm ) , and so can further inform our interpretations of the recent @xmath0 results .",
    "how neutral is the igm at @xmath0 , and how different is the neutral fraction compared to lower redshifts ?",
    "these are the questions we would like to address quantitatively , making use of the gravitational instability model of the igm .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "first , we start with a brief description of the gravitational instability model for the igm and the simulation technique in  [ method ] . in  [ meantlya ] , we derive the neutral hydrogen fraction @xmath10 , and equivalently the level of ionizing flux @xmath11 , at several different redshifts leading up to @xmath0 from the observed mean lyman - alpha ( ly@xmath12 ) transmission .",
    "this exercise using the ly@xmath12 spectrum is similar to the one carried out in mcdonald & miralda - escud ( 2001 ) , except for the addition of new high redshift data .",
    "transmission is also similar to a number of earlier papers where the primary quantity of interest is the baryon density ( e.g. rauch et al . 1997 , weinberg et al .",
    "1997 , choudhury et al .",
    "2000 , hui et al .",
    "2001 ) . here",
    ", we fix the baryon density and study the ionizing background or the neutral fraction instead ( see  [ method ] ) . ]",
    "we then examine in  [ lyman beta ] the constraints on the same quantities @xmath10 and @xmath11 from the observed mean lyman - beta ( ly@xmath13 ) transmission , ly@xmath13 being particularly useful at high ly@xmath12 optical depth , because the ly@xmath13 absorption cross - section is a factor of @xmath14 smaller than the ly@xmath12 cross - section . the goal here is to use ly@xmath13 absorption to obtain constraints on @xmath10 and @xmath11 that are as stringent as possible . in ",
    "[ lyman beta ] , we also examine the sensitivity of our conclusions to the power spectrum normalization .    an intriguing question is : instead of focusing on the mean transmission , can one make use of the fact that the observed spectrum at @xmath0 contains a continuous and long stretch ( @xmath15 ) with little or no detected flux to obtain more stringent limits on the neutral fraction or @xmath11 ?",
    "the idea is that since the igm gas density naturally fluctuates spatially , it seems a priori unlikely to have no significant upward fluctuation in transmission for many pixels in a row  unless of course the neutral fraction @xmath10 is indeed quite high .",
    "we will show in  [ los constraint ] this provides constraints that are slightly weaker to those obtained using the mean transmission .",
    "in all the simulations discussed in this paper , the ionizing background is assumed uniform spatially , just as in the majority of high redshift igm simulations .",
    "a natural worry is that as the universe becomes more neutral at higher redshifts , the ionizing background would be more non - uniform .",
    "one way to test this is to use several lines of sight , available at @xmath16 , and compare the observed line - of - sight scatter in mean transmission against the predicted scatter based on simulations with a uniform background .",
    "we discuss this in ",
    "[ variance of mean t ] , estimate the level of ionizing background fluctuations , and make predictions for the scatter at @xmath0 . here",
    ", we also introduce a technique to handle the problem of limited box - size .",
    "readers who are not interested in details can skip to  [ conclusions ] where we summarize the constraints obtained .",
    "we also discuss in  [ conclusions ] the issue of continuum placement , and how the associated uncertainties can be estimated . while the work described in this paper was being carried out , several papers appeared which investigate related issues ( barkana 2001 , razoumov et al .",
    "2001 , cen & mcdonald 2001 , gnedin 2001 , fan et al .",
    "where there is overlap , our results are in broad agreement with these papers .",
    "we present a comparision with other authors at the end of  [ lyman beta ] .",
    "our approach here is most similar to that of cen & mcdonald ( 2001 ) .",
    "in addition to obtaining constraints on the ionizing background from the ly@xmath12 and ly@xmath13 transmission as was considered by cen & mcdonald , we consider the possible constraint from the gunn - peterson trough itself , examine the dependence on power spectrum normalization , and develop a method to predict the scatter in mean transmission by relating it to the power spectrum , which might be of wider interest .",
    "we also place a slightly stronger emphasis on the neutral fraction , which is more robustly determined compared to the ionizing background or photoionization rate .",
    "the ly@xmath12 optical depth is related to the igm density , assuming ionization equilibrium , via @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the gas overdensity ( @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the gas density and @xmath21 its mean ) , @xmath22 is the equation of state index for the igm , where @xmath23 is the gas temperature and @xmath24 is its value at the cosmic mean density ( see hui & gnedin 1997 ) .",
    "we caution that close to reionization , these quantities may not be a function of @xmath18 alone .",
    "the igm may be heated inhomogenously , causing spatial fluctuations in @xmath24 and @xmath22 . ] , and @xmath25 is given by ( see e.g. hui et al . 2001 and references therein ) :      where @xmath27 ( @xmath28 is the total density of neutral and ionized hydrogen , and @xmath29 is the neutral hydrogen density ) is the neutral hydrogen fraction at mean density ( @xmath30 ) . is given by @xmath10 times @xmath31 . throughout this paper ,",
    "whenever we quote values for @xmath10 , we refer to the neutral hydrogen fraction at the cosmic mean density @xmath30 . ] here @xmath32 is the hubble parameter at redshift @xmath33 , @xmath34 is the hubble parameter today , @xmath35 km / s / mpc , @xmath36 is the baryon density in units of the critical density .",
    "the value of @xmath37 for @xmath38 above corresponds to that appropriate for a cosmology with @xmath39 and @xmath40 at @xmath41 , where @xmath42 and @xmath43 are the matter and vacuum densities in units of the critical density today .",

    "two more ingredients should be mentioned to complete the specification of our model for the ly@xmath12 absorption ( see e.g. hui et al .",
    "1997 for details ) .",
    "first , the optical depth as a function of velocity is computed by taking the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ taualpha ] ) in velocity space ( i.e. taking into account peculiar velocities ) and smoothing it with a thermal broadening window .",
    "second , the gas density and velocity fields are predicted by some cold dark matter ( cdm ) cosmological model using numerical simulations .      throughout this paper , we assume @xmath55 , as supported by recent cosmic microwave background measurements ( netterfield et al .",
    "2001 , pryke et al . 2001 ) and the nucleosynthesis constraint from primordial deuterium abundance ( burles et al .",
    "we also assume throughout @xmath56 , @xmath57 , and @xmath58 .",
    "variations of these parameters within the current bounds do not contribute significantly to the uncertainties of the constraints obtained in this paper ( see hui et al .",
    "2001 ) .",
    "the temperature @xmath24 and equation of state index @xmath22 at the redshifts of interest in this paper are somewhat uncertain .",
    "there are no direct measurements of the thermal state of the igm at our redshifts of interest , @xmath59 .",

    "it is also important to emphasize that _ the inference of @xmath10 from observations , unlike the case for @xmath11 , is not subject directly to uncertainties in the temperature @xmath24_. this is because observations constrain @xmath25 from which we can obtain @xmath10 without knowing @xmath24 ( see eq . [ [ aalphanew ] ] ) . )",

    "we find that in practice , the exact width of the thermal broadening kernel does not affect very much quantities such as the mean transmission , which is what we will be interested in .",
    "second , @xmath24 also affects the gas dynamics via the pressure term in the equation of motion . as we will discuss below",
    ", the effect of varying @xmath24 also appears to be small in this regard . ]    to generate realizations of the density and velocity fields for a given cosmology , we run hydro - particle - mesh ( hpm ) simulations ( gnedin & hui 1998 ) .",
    "the hpm algorithm is essentially a particle - mesh code , modified to incorporate a force term due to gas pressure in the equation of motion .",

    "we found that assuming @xmath74 versus @xmath75 results in negligible difference in our results , in particular concerning the mean decrement and the probability distribution of transmission .",

    "we adopt @xmath77 ( croft et al . 2000 , mcdonald et al .",

    "( 2000 ) : @xmath78 at @xmath79 at a velocity scale of @xmath80 .",
    "we , however , caution that the error - bar given is somewhat dependent on the assumed error of the mean transmission measurements , which is sensitive to the accuracy of the continuum - fitting procedure ( see e.g. zaldarriaga et al .",
    "2001 for a slightly different assessment of the error - bar ) .",
    "the power spectrum in this model has a similar shape to that of favored cosmological models , but slightly lower amplitude ( croft et al .",
    "2000 ) . in  [ lyman beta ] we demonstrate that our main conclusion , that the neutral fraction increases dramatically near @xmath0 , is insensitive to our assumptions about the amplitude of the power spectrum . in practice , we examine models with different normalizations by running a simulation with outputs at several different redshifts : each redshift then corresponds to a different power spectrum normalization , and linear interpolation is performed to reach any desired normalization . here .",
    "quantities such as the mean transmission which we are interested in here are generally sensitive to power on only a small range of scales .",

    "our simulations have a box size of @xmath83 mpc / h , with a @xmath84 grid .",

    "we have verified that the same is true up to @xmath86 , in the sense that the transmission probability distribution has converged for our choice of simulation size and resolution .",
    "finally , we should say a few words about simulations of the ly@xmath13 region . in regions of the quasar spectrum that are between @xmath87 and @xmath88 , where @xmath89 is the redshift of the quasar",
    ", two kinds of absorption can exist : one is ly@xmath13 due to material at redshift @xmath90 , the other is ly@xmath12 due to material at redshift @xmath91 .",
    "in other words , in such a region , the observed optical depth would be given by @xmath92 where @xmath93 and @xmath94 arises at different redshifts .",
    "the ly@xmath12 optical depth can be computed as before .",
    "the ly@xmath13 optical depth @xmath93 can be computed using eq .",
    "( [ taualpha ] ) , except that @xmath25 is replaced by @xmath95 : @xmath96 the factor of @xmath97 reflects the fact that the ly@xmath13 transition has a cross - section that is @xmath97 times smaller than ly@xmath12 .        using eq .",
    "( [ taualpha ] ) and ( [ aalphanew ] ) , we compute the @xmath10 , which also fixes @xmath11 ( eq . [ [ xhi ] ] ) , necessary to match the observed ly@xmath12 mean transmission @xmath98 at @xmath99 ( see table 1 for a summary of the measurements ) . the results of our calculation are presented in fig .",
    "[ meantalpha ] .",
    "this plot also contains a point at @xmath100 which is the result of matching the mean transmission in the ly@xmath13 forest , as we describe in  [ lyman beta ] .",

    "( [ xhi ] ) , one can see that such a trend for the neutral fraction is equivalent to assuming constant @xmath11 ( or more accurately , constant @xmath104 ; see eq .",
    "[ [ xhi ] ] ) .",
    "as one can see , ignoring for now the ly@xmath13 point , the neutral fraction does appear to have a modest jump around @xmath0 : it increases by a factor of @xmath105 from @xmath103 to @xmath100 , while it changes at most by @xmath106 from @xmath107 to @xmath103 . a similar trend ( but opposite in sign ) can be seen in the ionizing flux @xmath11 .",
    "the 1 @xmath108 error - bar here takes into account the measurement error in mean transmission , and the range of power spectrum normalization stated in ",
    "[ method ] . as we have explained in  [ method ] , while @xmath10 is not sensitive to the assumed temperature of the igm ( @xmath24 ) , our constraints on @xmath11 are directly influenced by it . as emphasized before , we assume @xmath61 k. in other words , our constraints on @xmath11 are really constraints on the quantity @xmath109 ( see eq . [ [ xhi ] ] ) .",
    "it is therefore straightforward to rescale our constraints on @xmath11 if the temperature were a little bit different .",

    "[ method ] . ]",
    "it is an interesting question to ask whether the apparent jump in the ionizing flux can instead be attributed to a jump in the temperature . in general",
    ", the temperature is expected to evolve slowly with redshift after reionization ( hui & gnedin 1997 ) .    regarding the measurement error",
    ", we should also emphasize that the becker et al.s 2 @xmath108 error actually includes the possibility of having zero transmission at @xmath110 .",
    "this means that at 2 @xmath108 , we would only have a lower limit on @xmath10 , or an upper limit on @xmath11 , for the highest redshift point in fig .",
    "[ meantalpha ] , allowing the possibility that the igm is neutral at @xmath0 , @xmath111 .      in this section",
    "we consider the constraints placed by becker et al.s measurement of the mean transmission in the ly@xmath13 region .",
    "absorption in the ly@xmath13 region has two components : @xmath112 , where the ly@xmath12 optical @xmath94 and the ly@xmath13 optical depth @xmath93 originate at different redshifts .",
    "ly@xmath13 absorption due to material at @xmath86 coincides in wavelength with ly@xmath12 absorption due to material at @xmath113 . because the points of origin are so widely separated ,",
    "they can be effectively treated as statistically independent i.e. @xmath114 .",
    "becker et al . measured @xmath115 at @xmath0 by dividing the net mean transmission @xmath116 in the ly@xmath13 region by the mean transmission in ly@xmath12 at @xmath85 .",
    "they obtained @xmath117 .",
    "clearly , this measurement is consistent with a completely neutral igm .",
    "however , the interesting question is : what kind of lower limit does it set on the neutral fraction , and does it improve upon the lower limit from the mean ly@xmath12 absorption ?",
    "we carry out a calculation that is analogous to what is described in ",
    "[ meantlya ] , except for the key difference that in computing @xmath93 from the simulated density and velocity fields , we employ @xmath95 which is a factor of @xmath97 smaller than @xmath25 ( see eq . [ [ taualpha ] ] & [ [ abeta ] ] ) .",
    "the results of our calculation are shown in fig .",
    "[ meantalpha ] , as the highest redshift points in the plot , which have error bar arrows pointing towards a completely neutral igm and a vanishing ionizing background .",
    "it can be seen that the ( @xmath118 ) lower limit on @xmath10 is @xmath119 .",
    "this is a factor of @xmath120 larger than the neutral fraction required to match the upper limit on the mean transmission in ly@xmath12 for our fiducial normalization , and a slightly stronger constraint than that obtained in section [ meantlya ] , including the uncertainty in power spectrum normalization .",
    "similarly , the upper limit on @xmath11 is @xmath121 .",
    "the moral here is that because the ly@xmath13 absorption cross - section is a factor of @xmath97 smaller than the ly@xmath12 cross - section , ly@xmath13 offers a more sensitive probe of the neutral fraction , especially when the ly@xmath12 optical depth is high .",
    "the neutral fraction at @xmath0 is thus a factor of @xmath122 higher than that at redshift @xmath123 , where it is @xmath124 .",
    "this dramatic change in the neutral fraction is suggestive , probably indicating that the reionization epoch is nearby .",
    "furthermore , this conclusion is not sensitive to our assumptions about the amplitude of the power spectrum .",
    "although the neutral fraction at redshift @xmath100 is itself sensitive to the amplitude of the power spectrum , we find that the factor by which the neutral fraction increases from @xmath103 to @xmath100 depends only weakly on the amplitude . in fig .",
    "[ xbreak ] we plot both the neutral fraction at @xmath100 and the jump in the neutral fraction for a range of different power spectrum normalizations .",

    "as one can see in the plot , the lower limit on the neutral fraction at @xmath100 varies from @xmath127 to @xmath128 as @xmath129 varies from @xmath130 to @xmath131 .",

    "we have not discussed it here , but a calculation of the size of these fluctuations would be very interesting . such a calculation will depend both on the mean free path of the ionizing photons as well as the spatial distribution of ionizing sources .",
    "the latter is probably quite uncertain , but useful estimates might be made ( e.g. razoumov et al . 2001 ) .",
