    "in order to understand the physics behind the interaction of strong laser pulses with matter , it is necessary to have well - characterized interacting pulses . with current technology",

    "@xcite ) , the same task becomes particularly challenging at higher intensities , where any direct measurement is prone to damaging the equipment .",
    "therefore , different proposals were put forward to determine properties of ultra - strong and short laser pulses ( e.g. , the laser peak intensity  @xcite or the carrier - envelope phase  @xcite ) . as we will argue in this paper , a sensitivity of compton scattering to the driving train of pulses",
    "can be traced back to the properties of pulses comprising the train .",
    "this can be based on the _ generalized klein - nishina ( gkn ) formula _ , which we derive in this paper .",
    "the original klein - nishina formula  @xcite for the compton scattering with the electron initial four - momentum @xmath2 [ @xmath3 , where ` _ _ dot _ _ ' means the relativistic scalar product , @xmath4 , has the form @xmath5 where @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the four - momenta of the initial and final photons , respectively , @xmath8 , @xmath9 , and @xmath10 . in this equation",

    ", the relativistically invariant parameter , @xmath25 determines the intensity of the electromagnetic plane wave .",
    "both @xmath26 and @xmath27 are the classical quantities , whereas the term proportional to @xmath28 in accounts for the quantum recoil of electrons during the compton process .",
    "such a recoil of electrons does not take place in the corresponding classical process , that is called the thomson scattering .",
    "this allows to introduce into the klein - nishina formula the classical thomson frequency , @xmath29 such that @xmath30 note that , for a given geometry of the process and for a given initial electron momentum , the thomson frequencies are equally separated from each other . the same is not true for the compton frequencies .",
    "this scaling law , which relates the quantum compton frequency @xmath22 to its classical analog , the thomson frequency @xmath31 , has been discussed recently for long laser pulses @xcite .",
    "its extension to short laser pulses together with the investigation of polarization and spin effects , and the synthesis of ultra - short pulses have been presented in  @xcite .",
    "the klein - nishina formula can be also expressed in the form @xmath32 which , for the given geometry of the scattering process and for the given frequency of the emitted compton photon , allows to determine the nonlinearity of the process , @xmath33 .",
    "note that the quantum nature of this formula is hidden in @xmath34 .",
    "therefore , we recover the classical result in the limit when @xmath35 .",
    "similar formulas can be derived for multichromatic plane - wave - fronted fields with commensurate frequencies .",
    "if the compton process occurs in a short and intense laser pulse , the situation is different .",
    "it follows from the time - frequency uncertainty principle that , if the driving pulse lasts for time @xmath36 , the frequency scale over which the system undergoes a significant change can not be smaller than roughly @xmath37 . for this reason ,",
    "the individual peaks in the compton frequency spectrum are hardly visible if the process occurs in few - cycle pulses ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "now , the question arises : is it possible to design a short laser pulse such that the individual peaks in the laser - induced compton spectrum are clearly distinguished from each other , with unambiguously prescribed to them integer orders @xmath33 ?",
    "although the answer to this question is in general negative , for suitably designed pulses , one can achieve the limit imposed by the aforementioned uncertainty relation .",
    "the idea of how to avoid the spectral broadening follows from the fraunhoffer diffraction theory as applied to the diffraction gratings , or from the frequency comb generation , and is based on the application of modulated laser pulses @xcite .",
    "we will demonstrate in this paper that , by using this technique , it is possible to achieve the clear spectral resolution of individual peaks in the compton spectrum , even if driven by few - cycle laser pulses .",
    "the compton scattering by short laser pulses is very sensitive to the precise form of the driving pulse .",
    "it was pointed out in  @xcite that this sensitivity can be used to characterize the driving laser fields . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the angular distributions of compton radiation were traced back to the carrier - envelope phase of the driving pulse .",
    "as we will point out , the spectrally resolved peaks in the compton distribution allow for determining properties of the driving train of pulses .",
    "this is done by mapping the positions of the compton peaks to the gkn formula , that we derive in this paper for an arbitrary , finite train of pulses .",

    "the distance between the peaks is roughly @xmath194 .",
    "[ single12gcase21s20150228],width=245 ]    , but for @xmath195 .",
    "since the peaks are denser , in the lower panel only part of the spectrum is presented .",

    "[ single12gcase21s20150228 ] , we present the compton spectrum induced by a single - cycle pulse .",
    "the spectrum consists of the broad supercontinuum which extends from nearly @xmath197 up to @xmath198 .",
    "if we repeat this pulse , @xmath161 , we observe the formation of the diffraction peaks for integer values of @xmath188 ( lower panel ) , which proves the validity of the gkn formula . for larger values of @xmath129 ,",
    "the positions of the main peaks stay the same but their widths become more narrow . the energy separation between the adjacent peaks is nearly the same ( @xmath199 ) .",
    "note that the pulse train under consideration is the superposition of two plane waves of frequencies @xmath200 and @xmath201 .",
    "also , the peak intensity of the laser field is not very large , as it does not exceed @xmath202 .",
    "this suggests that our theoretical predictions could be verified experimentally , for instance at the eli facility  @xcite .    for pulses with more oscillations ,",
    "the situation is similar . in fig .",
    "[ triple12gcase21s20150228 ] , we show this for @xmath195 .",
    "the only difference is that now the distribution of the diffraction peaks is denser , with the energy separation of roughly @xmath196 .",
    "as above , the main peaks ( for @xmath161 there are only the main diffraction peaks and the weaker secondary ones show up for @xmath176 , as presented in fig .",
    "[ long124case21c20150228 ] ) correspond to the clearly prescribed integer values of @xmath188 .",
    "this , again , proves the validity of the gkn formula derived in this paper .",
    "it follows from eq .",
    "that , knowing the geometry of the compton scattering and the electron initial energy , measuring frequencies of only three consecutive peaks in the spectrum ( for @xmath164 ) leads to the determination of the two important parameters of linearly polarized pulses which comprise the train : @xmath203 and @xmath204 .",
    "if the form of the envelope is known such measurements allow to determine the peak intensity of incident pulses , which is characterized by the parameter @xmath27 .",
    "another possibility is to map the positions of the compton peaks to the carrier envelope phase , assuming that the envelope type and the peak intensity is known .",
    "similar measurements for two different geometries can extract the values of @xmath205 and @xmath103 ( @xmath16 ) for elliptically polarized driving pulses and , hence , also their polarization properties .",
    "we have demonstrated that , by using a train consisting of a finite number of identical pulses , one can generate the compton radiation with well - resolved peaks . in other words ,",
    "we propose the mechanism to reduce the spectral broadening of the emitted radiation which typically occurs if a few - cycle pulse interacts with the electron ( see , for instance , refs .",
    "this is a complementary proposal to the one presented in ref .",
    "@xcite , where a single but chirped initial pulse was used in order to compensate for the spectral broadening . based on this result ,",
    "we have derived the generalized klein - nishina formula .",
    "the gkn formula   predicts the positions of well - resolved peaks in the compton spectrum , when driven by a finite train of pulses .",
    "we argue that , by analyzing the positions of the peaks in the frequency domain of compton photons , it is possible to determine laser pulse parameters , @xmath205 and @xmath103 for both linear polarizations .",
    "this means that the proposed method can be applied , for instance , to determine polarization properties of such pulses and either their peak intensity or their carrier - envelope phase .",
    "note that a similar analysis can be carried out for other fundamental processes of strong - field quantum electrodynamics , like the laser - induced breit - wheeler and bethe - heitler pair creation .",
