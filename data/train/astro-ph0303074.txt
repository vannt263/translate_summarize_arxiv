    "millimetre - band ( mm - band ) molecular absorption systems along the line - of - sight to quasars provide a powerful probe of cold gas in the early universe . @xcite",
    "have used molecular absorption lines to study a variety of properties of the absorbers themselves ( e.g.  relative column densities , kinetic and excitation temperatures , filling factors etc . ) . besides information about the absorbers",
    ", important cosmological parameters can be extracted from such data .",
    "constraints on the cosmic microwave background temperature can be obtained by comparing the optical depths of different rotational transitions [ e.g.  co(12 ) , co(23 ) etc . ]",
    "( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "also , if the background quasar is gravitationally lensed , time delay studies can yield constraints on the hubble constant ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "however , these studies have so far been limited by the paucity of mm - band molecular absorbers .",
    "only 4 such systems are currently known : @xmath1 toward txs 0218@xmath2357 @xcite , @xmath3 toward pks 1413@xmath2135 @xcite , @xmath4 toward txs 1504@xmath2377 @xcite and @xmath5 toward pks 1830@xmath6211 @xcite .",
    "quasar absorption lines can also be used to search for possible variations in the fundamental constants .",
    "detailed studies of the relative positions of heavy element optical transitions in 49 high redshift ( @xmath7 ) absorption systems favour a smaller fine structure constant ( @xmath8 ) at the 4.1@xmath9 significance level @xcite .",
    "the observed fractional change in @xmath10 [ @xmath11 is very small and systematic errors have to be carefully considered .",
    "however , a thorough search for systematics has not revealed a simpler explanation of the optical results @xcite .",
    "independent constraints at similar redshifts are required and recent attention has focused on molecular absorption systems .",
    "comparison of molecular rotational ( i.e.  mm - band ) and corresponding hi 21-cm absorption line frequencies has the potential to constrain changes in @xmath10 with a fractional precision @xmath12 per absorption system  an order of magnitude gain per absorption system over the purely optical methods .",
    "the ratio of the hyperfine ( 21-cm ) transition frequency to that of a molecular rotational line is @xmath13 for @xmath14 the proton @xmath15-factor @xcite .",
    "thus , any variation in @xmath16 will be observed as a difference in the apparent redshifts , @xmath17 ) . @xcite and @xcite have obtained constraints on @xmath18 consistent with zero @xmath16-variation from spectra of pks 1413@xmath2135 and txs 0218@xmath2357 .",
    "currently , the major uncertainty in this mm / hi comparison is that intrinsic velocity differences between the mm and hi absorption lines are introduced if the lines - of - sight to the mm and radio continuum emission regions of the quasar differ , as is certainly the case for pks 1413@xmath2135 and txs 0218@xmath2357 @xcite .    [ cols=\"<,^,>,^,<,<,<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     a _ statistical _ sample of mm / hi comparisons is therefore required to provide a reliable , independent check on the optical results for @xmath10-variation .",
    "one systematic approach to finding more mm - band molecular absorbers is to scan the frequency space toward a sample of millimetre - loud quasars .",
    "indeed , the absorber toward pks 1830@xmath6211 was identified in this way by @xcite . with the assumption that molecular absorption will be associated with significant optical extinction",
    ", one should select optically faint quasars to increase the probability of detecting molecular absorption . in this paper",
    "we present wide - band millimetre - wave spectra of the four millimetre - loud quasars which have not yet been optically identified : non - detections in the apmapmcat ] and dss catalogues imply @xmath19 . in the following section",
    "we describe the observations and data reduction and present the wide - band spectra . in section [ sec : abs ] we search for possible millimetre absorption systems close to our detection limits .",
    "we make our conclusions and discuss the future of our search technique in section [ sec : disc ] .",
    "we observed the quasars listed in table [ source ] in february 2002 with the 15-m sest at la silla , chile .",
    "the receivers were tuned to single - sideband mode and typical system temperatures , on the @xmath20-scale , were @xmath21250k for the sesis rx100 and rx150 receivers and @xmath21340k and 480k for the iram rx115 and rx230 respectively .",
    "the backends were acousto - optic spectrometers with 1440 channels and a channel width of 0.7mhz .",
    "we used dual - beam switching with a throw of @xmath2112  in azimuth , and pointing errors were typically @xmath22 rms on each axis .",
    "we used the sesis and iram rx230 receivers for the majority of our integrations , providing the advantage of a wide ( 1ghz ) bandwidth ( the iram rx115 has a 0.5ghz bandwidth ) . since the backend response decreases sharply toward the edges of the band , we overlapped the bands by observing at intervals of 0.8ghz to ensure uniform signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) in the final , combined spectra .",
    "the lowest frequency we could tune the rx100 receiver to was 78.8ghz and , although the nominal range is 78116ghz , the backend configuration did not allow tuning to 81.2 , 82.0 or 82.8ghz .",
    "similarly , we could not tune the rx150 receiver to 141.7 or 142.5ghz .",
    "for each 1ghz - wide spectrum , we averaged typically 10 two - minute ( reference - subtracted ) scans of the source and subtracted a low order polynomial fit from the data to provide a flat continuum . to convert the data from the @xmath20-scale to the jy - scale we fitted a third - order polynomial to the aperture efficiency of sest as a function of frequency :",
    "@xmath23 the intensity was calibrated using the chopper - wheel method which should be accurate to @xmath2410% .",
    "however , we found significant variations in the total flux density between each two - minute scan . therefore , in fig .  [ fig : fluxes ] we present the mean flux density , @xmath25 , for each of the 1ghz - wide spectra with error bars representing the rms from the contributing scans .",
    ", for each 1ghz - wide portion of spectrum .",
    "the error bars represent the rms derived from typically 10 scans at each frequency , @xmath26 .",
    "power - law fits with the given parameters were used to define the continuum flux to which the spectra in figs .",
    "[ fig:0500][fig:1213 ] have been normalized.,width=317 ]                    for each channel , we generated a 1@xmath9 error from the rms in a window of width @xmath27 channels centred on that channel .",
    "we found that @xmath28 provided reliable rms values but the results in section [ subsec : results ] were insensitive to this parameter . in the 0.2ghz regions where different 1ghz - wide spectra overlapped , we re - sampled the variance - weighted average using the largest channel width of the contributing spectra .",
    "finally , the combined spectra and 1@xmath9 error arrays were normalized to the flux density , @xmath25 , of the quasars .",

    "the data have been boxcar - smoothed over 3 channels ( we analyse the unsmoothed spectra in section [ sec : abs ] ) . from fig .",
    "[ fig:0500 ] it is clear that we only barely detect the continuum of b 0500@xmath2019 .",
    "however , b 0648@xmath6165 , b 0727@xmath6115 and b 1213@xmath6172 have s / n as high as @xmath2110 per ( unsmoothed ) 0.7mhz channel .",

    "no candidate absorption systems ( i.e. two independent features attributable to transitions with a common redshift ) could be identified where both features had a significance @xmath93 .",
