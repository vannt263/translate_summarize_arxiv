    "understanding how confinement influences the static and dynamic properties of fluids has relevance for several different areas of physical chemistry and for materials science and engineering .",
    "for example , ascertaining the nature of adsorption at solid adsorbants and in nano and mesoporous media is of practical interest in many industrial processes @xcite . similarly understanding static and dynamic wetting phenomena on the nanoscale is important for developments in nanofluidics and possibly in nanobiotechnology @xcite .",
    "fundamental studies of the effects of confinement have naturally focused on simple confining geometries . thus much",
    "is now known about the phase behaviour of fluids confined in symmetric geometries such as between two identical planar walls or in a cylindrical pore @xcite : confinement causes shifts of phase boundaries from those in bulk and can give rise to entirely new phases which have no bulk fluid analogue .",
    "far less is understood about fluids confined asymmetrically .",
    "the properties of such a system are of interest , for example , in microfluidics , in the self - assembly of molecules and in nanolubrication . in biology ,",
    "protein molecules are comprised of both hydrophilic and hydrophobic sites so an understanding of the forces arising from confining a fluid between substrates with different ( competing ) adsorbing properties may play a role in determining how proteins fold @xcite .",
    "layering arises from packing effects in fluids adsorbed at walls .",
    "the best studied situation is that of gas adsorption at a single attractive wall .",
    "enhanced attraction between the fluid and a solvophilic wall can result in a region of fluid near to the wall that is very much higher in average density than the bulk fluid ( a gas ) and layering transitions can occur as , one by one , new high density layers are adsorbed at the solvophilic wall as the chemical potential @xmath4 is increased towards bulk gas ",
    "liquid coexistence @xmath5 at a fixed ( low ) temperature . in this paper",
    "we show that layering transitions may also occur on increasing the separation , @xmath0 , between two parallel walls that exert competing solvophilic and solvophobic confining surface fields .",
    "the first - order layering transitions are seen as jumps in the adsorption isotherm as @xmath0 increases , at fixed @xmath4 close to @xmath5 , and there is sufficient space for another adsorbed liquid layer to develop .",
    "layering transitions were discovered experimentally using volumetric and gravimetric adsorption techniques .",
    "sharp steps in the adsorption isotherms at low temperatures for various gases adsorbed on graphite indicated the possibility of a series of first - order phase transitions @xcite .",
    "exfoliated graphite has proved a particularly suitable substrate due to its large , homogeneous surface area .",
    "more sophisticated techniques such as ellipsometry , neutron diffraction and x - ray scattering have extended the number of layering transitions observed , e.g. , eight for ethylene on graphite @xcite , nine for oxygen @xcite and ten for nitrogen @xcite and have allowed the identification of phase transitions within the adsorbed layers @xcite .",
    "some of the early experiments have been reviewed by thomy _",
    "et al _ @xcite and later summarised @xcite .",
    "an important issue is whether or not the discrete ( first - order ) jumps in adsorption correspond to transitions between liquid , as opposed to solid , adsorbed phases ; in many cases the transitions persist to temperatures above the bulk triple point .",
    "a theoretical perspective on layering transitions is given in refs . .",
    "early theoretical studies of layering transitions focused on lattice - gas models for the fluid @xcite .",
    "@xcite performed a systematic investigation of adsorption on attractive substrates and found first order layering transitions for sufficiently strongly attractive substrates .",
    "the transitions terminate in ( two - dimensional ising like ) critical points at temperature @xmath8 for the @xmath9th transition and as @xmath10 , @xmath8 approaches the roughening temperature @xmath11 of the lattice - gas . for strongly attractive substrates the wetting transition temperature @xmath12 lies below @xmath11 and wetting",
    "occurs via an infinite sequence of layering transitions as bulk liquid ",
    "gas coexistence is approached . for weaker substrates",
    "the layering transitions coalesce into a single thin - film to thick - film ( prewetting ) transition whose critical point lies slightly out of bulk coexistence , above but close to @xmath12 .",
    "however , the imposed discrete structure of the lattice - gas model overemphasizes the layer - like structure of adsorbed films .",
    "because of the particle - hole symmetry , layering transitions are even seen in drying films , i.e. in adsorption from a bulk liquid at a repulsive or a very weakly attractive substrate ; this is unrealistic @xcite .",
    "the physical relevance of the lattice - gas model is restricted to the situation where dense films are adsorbed such that hard - core interparticle repulsion leads to the formation of liquid - like layers .",
    "continuum , off - lattice models are clearly more relevant for real fluids , and layering transitions have been investigated using classical density - functional theories ( dft ) and in simulation . in a pioneering dft study ebner and",
    "saam @xcite found , using a non - local free - energy functional for a model of argon at a weakly adsorbing solid @xmath13 substrate , a single first - order transition from an adsorbed film of thickness one or two ( atomic ) layers to one of several layers .",
    "this transition was later identified as an example of cahn s generic prewetting .",
    "ball and evans @xcite employed a weighted density approximation for the hard - sphere part of the helmholtz free - energy functional to investigate simple model fluids adsorbed at strongly attractive structureless ( planar ) walls . they found a large number of layering transitions ( nine or ten ) at temperatures between about @xmath14 and @xmath15 , where @xmath7 is the bulk critical temperature .",
    "subsequently fan and monson @xcite investigated a system in which the fluid molecules interact with a shifted force lennard - jones ( lj ) 12 - 6 potential and are adsorbed at a weakly attractive , planar 9 - 3 wall .",
    "for this system they found prewetting followed by a sequence of layering transitions as @xmath4 was increased towards @xmath5 at temperatures above the bulk triple point temperature of the fluid .",
    "these authors@xcite found good qualitative agreement between the adsorption isotherms obtained from their monte carlo simulations and those they obtained using a version of dft similar to that of ball and evans @xcite .",
    "more recently layering transitions were found in dft studies of the asakura - oosawa ( ao ) model of colloid - polymer mixtures adsorbed at a planar hard wall @xcite . as a result of depletion attraction",
    "the hard wall favours the phase ( liquid ) that is rich in colloid and transitions occur on adsorbing from the bulk colloid - poor phase ( gas ) .",
    "the polymer reservoir packing fraction , @xmath16 , plays a role equivalent to inverse temperature . depending on the colloid - polymer size ratio ,",
    "three or four layering transitions followed by what appears to be a first - order wetting transition were found as @xmath16 decreased along bulk coexistence . unlike the layering transitions observed in simple liquids at attractive walls , these entropically driven transitions @xcite occur far from the bulk triple point .",
    "monte carlo simulations @xcite for the same ao model also find layering transitions and although the phase diagram is not identical to that obtained from dft calculations @xcite similar features emerge .",
    "moreover , the density profiles of colloid and polymer species found in simulation are close to those from dft .    when a fluid is confined between two identical walls or inside a cylindrical pore its phase behaviour may change markedly from in bulk . for solvophilic walls the bulk gas ",
    "liquid coexistence line is shifted to a lower chemical potential ; this is termed capillary condensation .",
    "the same type of confinement also causes the prewetting and layering transition lines found for the single wall to shift to different locations in the @xmath4 , @xmath17 phase diagram and to compete with capillary condensation @xcite .",
    "ball and evans @xcite used dft to study layering of model fluids confined in cylindrical pores and found that the layering transitions occur at lower pressures compared to the single wall system .",
    "the sequence of transitions between stable layered states was truncated by the onset of capillary condensation , i.e. the pore was filled by liquid at a certain chemical potential and for larger @xmath4 the layering transitions were metastable .",
    "grand canonical monte carlo ( gcmc ) simulations of a l - j fluid in cylindrical pores @xcite found similar results .",
    "layering transitions were also observed for a simple model of methane adsorbed in symmetric slit - like pores using gcmc and molecular dynamics ( md ) simulations @xcite ; as the wall separation @xmath0 increased a greater number of stable layering transitions was found since then capillary condensation occurs closer to @xmath5 @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we investigate layering in a l - j like fluid adsorbed in a slit - like pore where the two confining walls are competing , i.e. one wall is solvophilic and the other is solvophobic .",
    "the work of parry and evans @xcite established that the phase behaviour of fluids under such confinement can be very different from that found when the two walls are identical . for the case where the solvophobic wall is dry ( contact angle @xmath1 ) , phase coexistence is suppressed until temperatures below @xmath12 , the wetting transition temperature of the solvophilic wall . in the temperature range",
    "@xmath18 there is a single ` soft - mode ' phase characterized by a density profile that has low density gas near to the solvophobic wall and high density liquid near to the solvophilic wall . for large @xmath0 and @xmath4 near @xmath5",
    "there is a strongly fluctuating delocalized gas ",
    "liquid interface@xcite centered near @xmath19 . in a recent paper @xcite we performed a detailed dft investigation of the ` soft mode ' or ` delocalized interface ' phase of a model fluid similar to the one we consider here .",
    "that study focused on a single temperature @xmath20 and very large values of @xmath0 so that we could investigate the predictions of an effective interfacial hamiltonian approach for the scaling properties of thermodynamic quantities in the ` soft - mode ' phase of a model fluid subject to dispersion forces ; we deliberately retained the long - range ( @xmath21 ) tails of the interatomic potentials .",
    "the thrust of our present study is very different .",
    "we concentrate on lower temperatures , close to the bulk triple point @xmath22 and separations @xmath0 typically @xmath23 atomic diameters .",
    "two types of solvophobic wall are considered : ( i ) the wall  fluid potential is purely repulsive , as in ref .  , and",
    "therefore this wall is always dry and ( ii ) the wall  fluid potential has a weak attractive piece so that the wall is partially dry , i.e. , we choose parameters in order that the contact angle @xmath2 is large , in the range @xmath24 .",
    "we find that the phase behaviour and properties of the confined fluid differ dramatically between cases ( i ) and ( ii ) .",
    "one of the motivations for our present study was to ascertain how @xmath25 , the solvation force , i.e. the excess pressure or force per unit area between two walls arising from confinement of the fluid , differs from the well - studied case of identical walls . in the latter case @xmath25",
    "is usually attractive at large @xmath0 , although the precise form can depend on the details of the wall  fluid and fluid ",
    "fluid potentials and the thermodynamic state point of the fluid @xcite .",
    "determining the form of @xmath25 is important generally for understanding solvent - mediated interactions , especially in colloidal systems .",
    "for example the aggregation of colloidal particles depends on the solvent - mediated effective potential between two big colloids which can be obtained from @xmath25 using the derjaquin approximation @xcite .",
    "we note that much current research is concerned with the near - critical regime of the solvent where the solvation force acquires a so - called critical casimir contribution which has a universal scaling form that depends on the proximity to the solvent critical point , expressed in terms of the ratio of @xmath0 to the diverging bulk correlation length , and on the nature of the confining walls . for identical walls",
    "the scaling function for the critical casimir force is attractive while for competitive ( opposing ) walls it is repulsive .",
    "the development of the surface force apparatus ( sfa ) by israelachvili and co - workers @xcite and of atomic force microscopy ( afm ) techniques led to many experimental investigations of @xmath25 ; see for example the review @xcite .",
    "a notable early sfa experiment by horn and israelachvili @xcite in 1980 on an inorganic liquid between mica cylinders found oscillatory behaviour with the maxima of @xmath25 decaying exponentially with increasing separation .",
    "one year earlier lane and spurling @xcite and van megen and snook @xcite reported oscillatory @xmath25 in mc simulations of a lj fluid confined between identical planar ( solvophilic ) walls . since these pioneering investigations there have been many studies of oscillatory @xmath25 and it is clear that the oscillations arise from the packing of the atoms in the confined fluid , i.e. the same physics that is responsible for the layered structure of the density profile close to the walls . note that some evidence for layering transitions has been found in afm measurements of the shear response of a confined fluid , e.g. , for water between a glass tipped probe and a mica surface @xcite .",
    "much less is known about the solvation force under asymmetric confinement , a subject of our present study .",
    "an experiment by zhang _",
    "@xcite measured , in the sfa , the response to shear deformations of water confined between a hydrophilic and hydrophobic surface ( a janus interface ) .",
    "giant fluctuations in the viscous response were seen which the authors @xcite suggested were due to the presence of a wandering liquid ",
    "gas interface between the two surfaces of the type predicted theoretically by parry and evans @xcite .",
    "motivated by the experimental results , mccormick @xcite performed lattice gas simulations of ` water ' between a hydrophobic and a hydrophilic plate .",
    "he found large fluctuations in the contact density at the hydrophobic plate which were attributed to a fluctuating liquid ",
    "gas interface .",
    "subsequent grand canonical monte carlo simulations by pertsin and grunze @xcite for tip4p water showed large fluctuations in the number of ` water ' molecules present between hydrophilic and hydrophobic walls and the form of the density profiles indicated the presence of a wandering liquid  gas interface for the case of a purely repulsive hydrophobic wall .",
    "these studies provided some of the motivation for our current investigation .    in this paper",
    "we first study the adsorption behaviour of a model fluid , described in section [ sec : model ] , at a single solvophilic wall , over a range of temperatures from below the bulk triple point ( @xmath26 ) up to @xmath27 .",
    "we have identified the equilibrium layering transitions for @xmath28 and at coexistence by comparing the grand potential of states with different numbers of layers at each state point . unlike previous dft studies",
    "we have traced accurately the locations of the first three layering transition lines up to their critical points and have produced a phase diagram in the @xmath29 plane .",
    "focusing on the @xmath6 isotherm we show examples of density profiles at the layering transitions and plot the adsorption as bulk liquid  gas coexistence is approached .",
    "our dft method is described in section [ sec : dft ] and results are given in section [ sec : semi - inf ] .    in section [ sec : confined_results ] we confine our model fluid between two competing walls with sufficiently small wall separations that the , purely repulsive , solvophobic wall ( system ( i ) ) influences the layers of liquid next to the solvophilic wall .",
    "we find that the chemical potential at which the layering transitions occur depends on the wall separation @xmath0 and we have determined the full phase diagram as a function of chemical potential @xmath4 and wall separation @xmath0 at one temperature @xmath6 . in this system there is no capillary condensation as bulk liquid ",
    "gas coexistence is approached from the gas side with the interesting consequence that layering transitions can occur at bulk coexistence and even on the liquid side @xmath30 .",
    "we investigate ( sec .",
    "[ sec : fs ] ) the variation of the solvation force @xmath25 with wall separation @xmath0 for a liquid confined between identical , solvophilic walls , comparing and contrasting the results with those for @xmath25 obtained for the same model system confined in two different asymmetric slits .",
    "firstly a purely repulsive wall  fluid interaction ( i ) was chosen so that the solvophobic wall is completely dry in the semi - infinite system and secondly we consider a weakly attractive wall  fluid potential ( ii ) so that the wall is solvophobic but does not exhibit complete drying .",
    "the same solvophilic wall potential was used in all three systems . in section [ sec : pg ] we compare density profiles for the same model system obtained using our dft with those from the simulations of asymmetrically confined ` water ' performed by pertsin and grunze @xcite .",

    "note that our previous study@xcite showed that the presence of a fluctuating liquid gas interface , at @xmath136 , also yields a repulsive solvation force ; in this case the long - ranged dispersion interactions result in @xmath25 decaying as @xmath145 for large @xmath0 .",
    "our results do not support the hypothesis in ref .   that the noisy shear response they observed was due to a fluctuating liquid  gas interface and , like pg@xcite , we conclude that another explanation of the sfa results must be sought .",
    "shortly after the publication of the article by zhang _ et . al . _",
    "@xcite , lin and granick@xcite explained that many of the sfa experiments in granick s laboratory might have been influenced by the presence of pt nanoparticles resulting from cleaving the mica ; see also de gennes@xcite .",
    "also prompted by the results of zhang _ et .",
    "@xcite , mccormick @xcite investigated a simple lattice gas model for ` water ' confined between hydrophilic and hydrophobic walls in which the hydrophobic wall had a contact angle of @xmath146 . a liquid ",
    "gas interface position was defined to be located at the average of the distances of the nearest liquid cell and furthest gas cell from the hydrophobic wall .",
    "the time and space averaged position of this interface was at @xmath147 , suggesting one or two layers of gas next to the hydrophobic wall .",
    "large fluctuations in the location of this interface were observed which mccormick argued provided evidence for a fluctuating liquid  gas interface .",
    "this result appears to be in contrast with our results for system ( ii ) , a slightly more hydrophobic wall ( @xmath143 ) where equilibrium density profiles ( fig .  [ fig : ptwprofsta ] ) showed layers of liquid next to the hydrophobic wall and therefore no liquid  gas interface .",
    "thus there appears to be some inconsistency between our results and those obtained for the lattice gas @xcite .",
    "this may be related to the manner in which the liquid  gas interface was defined in the simulations by mccormick@xcite .",
    "the physical situation that should be relevant for sfa measurements on water between hydrophilic and hydrophobic surfaces is that described by pg s",
    "density profile@xcite labelled 1 in our fig .",
    "[ fig : ptwprofpg ] and the equilibrium profiles at @xmath108 or @xmath15 , in fig .",
    "[ fig : ptwprofsta ] . in the light of pg s observation@xcite of a large root mean square fluctuation in the number of molecules and mccormick s observation@xcite of strong fluctuations in the lattice gas occupancy at contact it is tempting to speculate that the local susceptibility ( or local compressibility ) @xmath148 , as considered , for example , in ref .  , is large for @xmath50 in the vicinity of the hydrophobic or solvophobic wall even when that wall is only partially dry , i.e. the contact angle is large but @xmath149 .",
    "indeed there is growing evidence , from simulations of a variety of water models , that water near such a hydrophobic substrate exhibits enhanced density fluctuations .",
    "recent papers by acharya _",
    "et.al._@xcite and mittal and hummer @xcite provide a comprehensive set of relevant references .",
    "we shall return to these issues in a future publication .",
    "finally we return to case ( i ) where the solvophobic wall is purely repulsive and therefore dry .",
    "fixing chemical potential @xmath4 and varying wall separation @xmath0 leads to a similar sequence of layering transitions as setting @xmath150 and varying @xmath4 .",
    "the physical explanation for this observation lies in the fact that a layer of gas develops at the solvophobic wall and this appears to mimic the role of the gas reservoir ( with @xmath28 ) in the semi - infinite solvophilic system .",
    "the presence of the gas layer permits the development of a gas  liquid interface in the confined fluid ",
    "see fig .",
    "[ fig : ptwprofs ] . it would be interesting to establish more formal connections between the two physical situations .",

    "picard iteration ( details of the numerical methods used can be found in chapter 3 of ref .  )",
    "is usually a robust and reliable means of minimizing @xmath151 $ ] .",
    "however , this was slow to converge because of the oscillatory nature of the density profile close to the solvophilic wall .",
    "there was also the additional problem of the large number of metastable states associated with different numbers of layers of liquid . in order to overcome these difficulties ,",
    "the grand potential @xmath152 $ ] was first obtained for a large number of non - equilibrium density profiles @xmath153 .",
    "these density profiles were the result of allowing a fixed number of iterations ( e.g. @xmath154 ) from different initial profiles . the first starting profile ( @xmath155 )",
    "was chosen to have either i ) constant density equal to that of the bulk gas @xmath76 or ii ) a ` sharp - kink ' profile with density equal to that of the liquid at bulk coexistence , @xmath156 , between @xmath39 and @xmath157 and that of the bulk gas for @xmath158 .",
    "subsequent starting profiles were created from the previous final profile by adding a thin layer , @xmath159 , ( e.g. @xmath160 ) of liquid density at @xmath161 .",
    "this method was found to be more satisfactory than using a different ` sharp - kink ' starting profile each time because it took advantage of the presence of peaks in the density profile near to the wall that had already formed so that the correct shape profile was reached in fewer iterations .",
    "once the shape of the profile was correct the liquid ",
    "gas interface moved only very slowly towards a stable or metastable position .",
    "the grand potential @xmath152 $ ] could then be plotted ( fig .",
    "[ fig : exgp0_56 ] ) as a function of the excess adsorption of the resulting density profiles : @xmath162}{a}=\\int{dz [ \\tilde{\\rho}(z;t,\\mu)-\\rho_b(t,\\mu)]}. \\label{eq : gibbsabs}\\ ] ] the excess adsorption per unit area , @xmath163/a$ ] , provides a measure of the distance of the liquid  gas interface from the wall @xmath164 .",
    "the minima in the grand potential @xmath165 $ ] correspond to positions of the liquid ",
    "gas interface with different numbers of layers of liquid .",
    "accurate values for the grand potential at its minimum points could then be found by allowing the appropriate profiles to converge fully and layering transitions were identified by comparing the grand potential energy of the density profiles at the different minima .",
    "the global minimum at a given chemical potential corresponds to the equilibrium state and a layering transition occurs when there are two equal minima , see fig .  [ fig : exgp0_56 ] for adsorption at a single solvophilic wall .",
