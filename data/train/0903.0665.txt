    "estimates of the cosmic baryon fraction , defined as the ratio of baryonic to total mass in the universe , can be combined with constraints on the integrated mass function of galaxies to infer that most baryons in the universe are in a hot , diffuse form at the present epoch @xcite .",
    "cosmological simulations suggest that 3040  per  cent of all baryons reside in intergalactic filaments of shock - heated gas with temperatures @xmath5  k , the so - called warm / hot intergalactic medium , whim ( e.g.@xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "x - ray absorption studies have provided observational evidence for such a component along the line of sight towards a number of quasars ( e.g.@xcite ) .    while most of the whim baryons are predicted to reside in structures of low overdensity , outside the dark matter halos of individual galaxies and groups of galaxies @xcite , a potential repository for some of the `` hidden '' baryons in the universe",
    "could be extended halos of hot ( @xmath6 k ) gas around individual galaxies , including spirals ( e.g.  @xcite ) . for massive galaxies ,",
    "cosmological simulations suggest that the total mass of these `` external '' galactic baryons is comparable to that of stars and cold gas in the galaxies themselves @xcite . in a cosmological context ,",
    "observational support for such a scenario comes from the angular correlations between the galaxy distribution and the soft x - ray background , which indicate the presence of soft x - ray emission from whim surrounding individual galaxies @xcite .",
    "the presence of extended hot gaseous halos around optically bright elliptical galaxies is well established from x - ray observations ( e.g.@xcite ) .",
    "the idea that disk galaxies could also be embedded in such halos is integral to many semi - analytical models of disk galaxy formation ( e.g. , @xcite ) . in these models , galaxy dark matter halos",
    "are assumed to grow as predicted by spherical infall models , with gas accreting continuously along with the dark matter . during infall into the dark matter potential ,",
    "the gas is heated , potentially to the halo virial temperature , subsequently cooling radiatively . if cooling is rapid , as is the case for characteristic gas temperatures @xmath7  k and hence relatively shallow potential wells , no accretion shock develops outside the evolving galactic disk . in these models , present - day spirals of total mass @xmath8  m@xmath9 accrete gas which is predominantly in a cold , non  x - ray emitting phase at temperatures much lower than the virial temperature of their halo @xcite .",
    "this cold accretion mode would be particularly pronounced at high redshift , and would imply that most of the halo radiation is emitted as ly@xmath0 emission close to the disk . indeed , observational support for this scenario",
    "is accumulating at both low and high redshift ( e.g. , @xcite ) .    at higher galaxy masses and gas temperatures ,",
    "the gas would emit at x - ray wavelengths but would cool less efficiently , and is then assumed in the models to flow in more slowly than in the fast - cooling regime .",
    "a hot x - ray emitting halo can develop , in which the infalling gas is eventually deposited where dictated by its angular momentum . as in the cold accretion mode , the gas may ultimately condense to form stars in a rotationally supported disk . in practice , thermal instabilities could act to locally reduce the cooling time of hot halo gas , so in addition to a classical central cooling flow , cooling may also proceed via fragmentation of halo gas into smaller clouds throughout the halo",
    ". the net result may be the formation of a multi - phase halo containing warm ( @xmath10  k ) , pressure - supported clouds embedded in a large - scale hot corona .",
    "these clouds may then rain down onto the disk , possibly akin to some of the high - velocity hi clouds seen around the galaxy ( e.g. , @xcite ; but see also @xcite ) . in the scenario proposed by @xcite , condensation and infall of such clouds",
    "would be very important for fueling mw - sized galaxy disks , although at least some numerical work suggests that this mode of accretion is subdominant at @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "the general picture of massive disk galaxies embedded in hot gaseous halos has been backed by cosmological hydrodynamic simulations of galaxy formation ( e.g. , @xcite ) , thus lending support to the general validity of the simplifying assumptions underlying semi - analytical models .",
    "for example , the simulations presented by @xcite showed the x - ray luminosity @xmath12 of hot halo gas to scale strongly with disk circular velocity @xmath13 ( defined here as the rotation velocity at 2.2  times the disk scale - length ; see @xcite for details ) , with @xmath14 , as also expected from semi - analytical models of galaxy formation .",
    "it is relevant to note , however , that all the massive galaxies in the @xcite study were formed in the old `` standard '' ( @xmath15 , @xmath16 ) cold dark matter cosmology , with a fixed primordial metal abundance and an assumed cosmic baryon fraction well below the currently accepted value .",
    "thus , it seems timely to explore the hot halo predictions of more sophisticated higher - resolution simulations assuming the currently prevailing @xmath17cdm cosmology .",
    "this is one of the goals of this paper .",
    "the existing theoretical results clearly suggest that x - ray observations could provide a useful means of mapping any material accreting onto massive spirals at the present epoch .",
    "direct observational verification of the above scenario has remained elusive , however . in a first study aimed at detecting cosmologically accreted gas halos around spirals ,",
    "@xcite compared _ rosat _ x - ray observations of three massive , highly inclined spirals to predictions of simple cooling flow models .",
    "the failure of these authors to detect any hot gas around the galaxies translated into upper limits on the halo x - ray luminosity which , for their best - constrained case of ngc2841 , was found to be a factor of 30 below their model prediction .",
    "while their models were deliberately simplified versions of general semi - analytical ones , the result persists that some hydrodynamical simulations and simple analytical models overpredict actual halo luminosities ( @xcite ; @xcite and references therein ) , though the exact magnitude of this discrepancy has yet to be established .",
    "extended x - ray halos _ have _ been detected around numerous late - type star - forming spirals ( see @xcite ; @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "however , these galaxies typically have at least moderately high star formation rates ( @xmath18  m@xmath19  yr@xmath3 ) , with the detected halo x - ray emission coinciding with extraplanar h@xmath0 and radio continuum emission .",
    "the standard interpretation is that these multi - phase halos have been generated by star formation activity in the disk , with supernovae expelling hot , x - ray emitting gas , warm and/or photoionized h@xmath0-emitting material , and radio synchrotron emitting cosmic ray electrons from the disk @xcite . unlike the expectation for gravitationally heated gas , the x - ray luminosity of the gas in the halos of these galaxies",
    "is found to correlate with various measures of the disk star formation rate and with the energy input rate by supernovae ( sn ) , but  even when including the diffuse x - ray luminosity of the disk  not with baryonic or hi mass in the disk ( @xcite ; see also @xcite ) .",
    "diffuse x - ray emission has also been detected around massive early - type ( sa  sb ) spirals such as ngc4594 ( the `` sombrero '' galaxy ) @xcite . in these cases ,",
    "the emission is not obviously associated with star formation in the disk , but the total diffuse x - ray luminosity from the disk and halo still falls well below expectations from cosmological accretion on the basis of the @xcite results .",
    "it has been speculated that much of the detected extraplanar emission in these galaxies is heated by sn  ia activity in the disk rather than by gravity ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "summarizing , the hot halos observed so far around spirals seem to result mainly as a consequence of stellar feedback in the disk rather than infalling intergalactic material .",
    "a possible exception is the milky way itself , a moderately star - forming galaxy for which indirect arguments can be used to ascertain the presence of an extended reservoir of hot gas possibly related to a gaseous halo ( e.g.@xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . despite this",
    ", it remains unclear whether any of this putative halo gas is actually cooling out to accrete onto the milky way disk , and if so , to what extent it can replenish the gas currently being consumed in the disk by star formation .    sensitive x - ray observations of carefully selected systems are required to settle the question of whether substantial hot gas halos associated with infalling material exist around quiescent spirals at all .",
    "this would provide an important consistency check on the assumptions underlying existing disk galaxy formation models .",
    "motivated by this , we initiated a _",
    "search for hot x - ray gas surrounding massive , quiescent disk galaxies . as part of this program ,",
    "the discovery of hot halo gas around ngc5746 , with a total x - ray luminosity of @xmath20  erg  s@xmath3 , was reported by @xcite . in the present paper ,",
    "we re - visit this issue in more detail using updated _ chandra _ calibration data , describe our corresponding _",
    "results for the less massive galaxy ngc5170 , and present new results from cosmological simulations of galaxy formation and evolution , for direct comparison to the observations .",
    "contrary to the claim in @xcite , significant extraplanar emission surrounding ngc5746 is not detected in our updated analysis .",
    "in   [ sec , sample ] we outline our target selection and the analysis of x - ray and optical data .",

    "a hubble constant of @xmath21  km  s@xmath3  mpc@xmath3 is assumed throughout .",
    "the distances to ngc5746 and ngc5170 as listed in ned are then 26.8 and 24.8  mpc , respectively , with 1  arcmin corresponding to @xmath22 and @xmath23  kpc . unless otherwise stated , uncertainties are reported at the 68  per  cent confidence level .",
    "the primary objective of this study is to map and characterize any diffuse x - ray gas surrounding quiescent disk galaxies .",
    "our starting point was therefore the simulation results of @xcite , in particular the result that halo x - ray luminosity @xmath12 should scale strongly with disk circular velocity @xmath13 .",
    "hence , our target sample was drawn by searching the ned and hyperleda databases for nearby spiral galaxies with circular velocity @xmath24 km s@xmath3 . according to the results of @xcite , this",
    "should ensure that the target galaxies are massive enough to generate and retain a large - scale x - ray halo detectable within reasonable _ chandra _ exposure times .",
    "a further advantage of large @xmath13 lies in the fact that the efficiency with which sn outflows can escape the disk and complicate the interpretation of our results may be expected to decrease with increasing disk mass .",
    "in addition , we required our targets to meet the following criteria : i ) inclination @xmath25 , to enable a clean separation between disk and halo gas ; ii ) distance @xmath26  mpc , for similar reasons , and to obtain a sufficiently strong x - ray signal ; iii ) galactic latitude @xmath27 , to have a low column density of absorbing foreground galactic hydrogen , given that any halo emission is expected to be fairly soft and thus subject to significant absorption by intervening material ( this criterion excluded a galaxy like ngc2613 , studied by @xcite ) ; iv ) the galaxies should not be a member of a known x - ray bright group or cluster , nor show any significant signs of interaction , so as to include only undisturbed galaxies and avoid significant contamination from hot gas residing in an ambient intragroup/-cluster medium ; v ) in order to also minimize contamination from outflows of hot gas , the galaxies should be relatively quiescent , i.e.  not show evidence for significant activity related to a starburst or an active galactic nucleus ( agn ) .",
    "this excluded galaxies such as ngc891 , which displays extraplanar x - ray , h@xmath0 , and radio emission associated with stellar feedback activity ( see @xcite and references therein ) , and the strongly bulge - dominated seyfert ngc4594 ( the sombrero ) , which hosts a @xmath28  m@xmath19 low - luminosity agn @xcite .    imposing these strict criteria",
    ", only one galaxy remained , ngc5746 .",
    "we therefore relaxed the requirement on @xmath13 to include a second target , ngc5170 , which , although still massive , could act as a consistency check on our analysis procedure . ngc5746 is an sbb spiral with a circular velocity @xmath29  km  s@xmath3 ( hyperleda database ) , and ngc5170 an sc spiral with a significantly lower @xmath13 of @xmath30  km  s@xmath3 @xcite .",
    "we note that our selection was not restricted to particular hubble types , but given the @xmath31  km  s@xmath3 criterion , the selection method is likely to bias against late - type spirals .",
    "since such galaxies are likely to display higher star formation activity at present than early - type ones , this criterion is in turn likely to favor relatively quiescent spirals , as desired",

    "point source searches were carried out with the ciao task ` wavdetect ' using a range of scales and detection thresholds , and results were combined .",
    "a total of 126 ( ngc5746 ) and 111 ( ngc5170 ) point sources were detected in the two observations , of which 20 and 17 sources , respectively , are located inside the @xmath38 ellipses .",

    "the frames were bias - subtracted , flat - fielded , and median - combined using standard iraf procedures . using the @xmath79-band image of each galaxy , we estimated and subtracted the continuum emission contribution to the h@xmath0 image as follows .",
    "the two combined images were normalized to the same exposure time , and the @xmath79-band image was smoothed with a gaussian kernel to match the broader point spread function of the h@xmath0 image .",
    "the smoothed @xmath79-band image was then scaled to match the narrower width of the h@xmath0 filter and subtracted from the h@xmath0 image . for ngc5746 ,",
    "the background in the resulting continuum - subtracted h@xmath0 image had a large - scale gradient caused by stray light from a star just outside the field of view .",
    "we modeled this using the sextractor software @xcite with options set to save a full resolution interpolated background map .",
    "parameters were optimized to generate a map sufficiently fine to represent large scale variations , and sufficiently coarse so as not to include local non - background structures ( such as an h@xmath0 halo around the galaxy ) .",
    "the resulting background map was then subtracted from the h@xmath0 image .",
    "in order to aid the search for diffuse x - ray emission around either galaxy , smoothed , exposure - corrected 0.32  kev images were created for both using two separate methods .",
    "one involved smoothing the images with a simple gaussian kernel , while in the other we generated background - subtracted images following the procedure outlined in @xcite . in either case , the resulting images were exposure - corrected using similarly smoothed exposure maps . the overall impression conveyed by these images is qualitatively similar , suggesting very little diffuse emission beyond the optical disk of either galaxy .",
    "given the expected weakness of any halo signal , we here only discuss the simple gaussian smoothed images , so as to accommodate any concerns that adaptive smoothing may introduce spurious features for these low ",

    "[ fig , overlays ] shows our h@xmath0 images of the central @xmath80  arcmin region around each galaxy , with the gaussian smoothed x - ray contours overlayed , and with the optical extent of the galaxies outlined by their respective @xmath38 ellipses .",
    "clearly , both diffuse and point - like x - ray emission is detected within the optical disks of both galaxies , but there is no immediate indication of any diffuse x - ray or h@xmath0 emission extending well beyond the disks .    in order to perform a more quantitative search for diffuse x - ray emission around the galaxies , and confirm the overall impression conveyed by fig .",
    "[ fig , overlays ] , we generated 0.32  kev surface brightness profiles of the unsmoothed , exposure - corrected emission .",
    "point sources , chip gaps , and emission inside @xmath38 were masked out .",
    "radial profiles extracted within @xmath81  kpc ( @xmath82  arcmin for ngc5746 ) are shown in figure  [ fig , surfbright ] , binned into ten equal - sized radial bins for improved s / n , and with the background level in the data evaluated from a surrounding ( @xmath837.5  arcmin ) point source  excised annulus .",
    "these profiles support the conclusion that no significant detectable x - ray emission surrounds either galaxy on large scales .",
    "we confirmed that this result does not depend on the specific choice of radial binning scheme .",
    "while the ngc5170 profile shows emission outside @xmath38 which is everywhere consistent with a constant level equal to the estimated mean background level , the profile for ngc5746 does show some deviations from a uniform level .",
    "excess emission is detected in the radial bin immediately outside the optical disk at @xmath84 significance , suggesting the presence of faint extraplanar emission at @xmath8510  kpc from the galactic center .",
    "we investigate this in more detail in the inset in fig .",
    "[ fig , surfbright]a , which displays the ngc5746 profile extracted in bins perpendicular to the disk .",
    "this plot confirms that the excess is not an artifact of the adopted binning scheme , while also indicating that the excess may be largely confined to the eastern side of the disk .",
    "however , since the signal is only nominally significant at the @xmath86 level and is comprised of only 15  net photons , we do not consider it robust evidence of diffuse halo emission associated with ngc5746 .",
    "it is also worth remarking that a comparably significant _ deficit _ of emission is seen at larger radii ( @xmath874  arcmin ) , suggesting that the excess may be a spurious feature introduced by local fluctuations in the background level , perhaps caused by the presence of point sources just below our detection limit .    inside the circular aperture underlying fig .",
    "[ fig , surfbright ] , i.e.  with the @xmath38 ellipse excluded , we detect a total of 38  net photons in 0.32  kev for ngc5746 , corresponding to emission at just @xmath88 above the background .",
    "the corresponding result for ngc5170 shows a _ deficit _ of 101  photons ( significant at @xmath89 ) relative to the surrounding background .",
    "qualitatively similar results are obtained in narrower energy bands such as 0.51.5  kev , in which the number of source photons is obviously lower but the acis - i s / n from any absorbed @xmath90  kev plasma should be higher .",
    "hence , the immediate conclusion is that no statistically significant diffuse x - ray emission is detected outside the optical disk of either galaxy on these scales .    in other cases where",
    "diffuse x - ray emission has been reported around spirals , this emission is typically accompanied by extended h@xmath0 and radio halos , with similar overall morphologies ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "although there is no indication in fig .",
    "[ fig , overlays ] of significant extraplanar h@xmath0 emission around ngc5746 , we investigate this possibility in more detail in fig .",
    "[ fig , hasurf ] , where we show the surface brightness profile of the h@xmath0 emission perpendicular to the disk of this galaxy .",
    "as can be seen , there is no evidence for significant amounts of h@xmath0 gas outside the optical extent of the disk .",
    "note that the dip in the h@xmath0 profile 10  arcsec east of the @xmath38 center is due to a dust lane also visible in broad - band optical images . for ngc5170",
    ", a similar study has been performed by @xcite , who find no evidence for extraplanar diffuse h@xmath0 emission surrounding this galaxy in an h@xmath0 exposure of similar depth to ours .",
    "there is also no indication of significant extraplanar _",
    "emission around either galaxy in the public nrao vla sky survey ( nvss ) 1.4  ghz data of @xcite . for ngc5746 ,",
    "this conclusion is further supported by the nvss flux density profile extracted from these data , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig , hasurf]b .",
    "these results provide further testimony to the low star formation activity of both our galaxies , and support the assumption based on fig .",
    "[ fig , strickland ] that our constraints on x - ray emission associated with any gas accreting onto these galaxies are not subject to serious contamination by emission from disk outflows .",
    "the absence of significant detectable diffuse emission around ngc5746 contrasts with the earlier result of @xcite in which a @xmath78 detection of halo emission was claimed , with a 0.32  kev luminosity @xmath91  erg  s@xmath3 and a plasma temperature of @xmath92  kev .",
    "although the modest significance of the detection renders this result tentative rather than conclusive , the difference with respect to our present conclusion demands an attempt at an explanation .",
    "we speculate that this discrepancy arises due to a change in the calibration of the time - dependent degradation of the low - energy acis ccd quantum efficiency , a possibility also advocated by @xcite .",
    "this degradation is believed to be caused by a build - up of molecular ice on the _ chandra_/acis optical blocking filters or ccd s , an effect which was known but still not well understood at the time of our original analysis in @xcite .",
    "the properties of the contaminant has remained the focus of continued measurements and is considerably better understood at present . in particular , a model of the _ spatial _ dependence of the contaminant was introduced with the calibration data in caldb v.  3.0 .",
    "however , the analysis of @xcite was performed using caldb v.  2.26 , with which the contamination could only be appropriately corrected for in the case of an on - axis source . as contamination is observed to increase towards the edges of the acis array , not correctly accounting for this spatial variation will introduce a spurious signal in exposure - corrected low - energy acis - i images , appearing as faint diffuse emission whose surface brightness decreases with distance from the ccd aimpoint .",
    "it will also lead one to underestimate the soft x - ray background at large off - axis angles .",
    "we conducted a few tests to explore whether this effect could account for the halo signal detected by @xcite . at a photon energy @xmath93  kev , close to the flux peak energy of a @xmath94  kev thermal plasma ( the halo temperature inferred by @xcite ) , the additional optical depth towards the edges of the ccd arrays can be 0.30.5 for data taken around the time of our observations ( see previous footnote ) , implying an apparent reduction in surface brightness at large off - axis angles to 6075% of the on - axis value .",
    "the best - fit ( halo plus background ) surface brightness model reported by @xcite in fact declines at large distances from the ngc5746 disk to about 75% of the value seen immediately outside the optical disk ( at @xmath95 ) , consistent with the expectation for the spatial variation of the contaminant .    as a further test of this hypothesis , we re - consider the spectral analysis described by @xcite , in which a double - subtraction approach was employed for the extraction of a background spectrum .",
    "this involves extracting a background spectrum for the same detector region as the source region , using blank - sky background data prepared in a similar manner to the source data .",
    "this procedure is then repeated for a large - radius annulus , in order to obtain a residual background spectrum that helps to account for any difference in soft x - ray background between source- and blank - sky data .",
    "this residual spectrum is then added to the source - region blank - sky spectrum to produce a composite background spectrum .",
    "we here repeated the exact same procedure as in @xcite , while employing the more recent calibration files included with caldb 3.4.1 . in order to mimic the effect of underestimating the soft x - ray background at large radii , as implied by our hypothesis ,",
    "the normalization of the soft residual spectrum was artificially scaled down so as to achieve @xmath96 net counts in the source region as reported by @xcite .",

    "these values are strikingly similar to those obtained by @xcite .    in summary ,",
    "both the spatial and spectral properties of the diffuse x - ray halo around ngc5746 reported by @xcite are consistent with the hypothesis that the apparent halo signal was an instrumental artifact caused by the spatial variation in the degradation of the low - energy acis quantum efficiency , an effect which our original analysis could not take into account .",
    "the question then arises as to why this calibration problem did not lead to a similar spurious detection of a hot halo around ngc5170 , given that the two galaxies were observed with acis - i within one month of each other and with comparable exposure times .",
    "the low signal - to - noise ratio outside the disk in both data sets , including that of the original halo `` detection '' around ngc5746 , precludes robust conclusions in this regard however , so we can only offer some general considerations .",
    "we note that we find no statistically significant differences in the background level between the two data sets in any of a dozen different energy bands or large - radius background regions considered , so global background differences are unlikely to play a major role .",
    "the slightly different data preparation criteria applied in our updated analysis could have some impact though , changes in the calibration data aside . for example , our lightcurve screening employs somewhat larger time bins , and has removed a previously undetected minor flare at the end of the ngc5170 observation .",
    "our current point source search is also slightly more sophisticated , and has resulted in the identification of ten additional point - like sources in the ngc5170 data ( but none such for ngc5746 ) , of which seven are outside the disk . in combination with the slightly shorter exposure time obtained for ngc5170 , these issues may have played a role in suppressing any faint spurious signal that could mimic diffuse x - ray emission around this galaxy .",
    "in addition , we can not exclude the possibility that the spurious halo signal around ngc5746 had an additional contribution not present in the ngc5170 data , e.g.  from faint unresolved sources , such as the one hinted at immediately east of the ngc5746 disk in figs .",

    "hence , we base our constraints on the amount of accreted hot halo gas on the net count rate limits evaluated inside the circular apertures underlying fig .",
    "[ fig , surfbright ] , i.e.  a region extending to @xmath81  kpc from immediately outside the @xmath38 ellipse of each galaxy .    in order to convert observed count rate limits into constraints on the halo x - ray flux , we assume that the spectrum of any hot halo gas can be described by a thermal plasma with a given temperature , metal abundance , and volume filling factor ( adopting the apec model in xspec v11.3 ) . in the absence of direct observational information on these quantities , we resort to more indirect observational constraints and to simulation results . for example , cosmological simulations predict a remarkably tight correlation between the temperature of infalling hot gas and @xmath13 of the disk (   [ sec , comparison ] below ; see also @xcite ) , with @xmath100 being in good agreement with a simple expectation for the virial temperature @xmath117 of the underlying dark matter halo .",

    "these situations are manifestly distinct from the case of a gravitationally confined hot halo composed of infalling shock - heated material as seen in our simulations , but it is the amount and properties of any such material that is the focus of our attention .",
    "we further note that outside the galactic disks themselves , the emission - weighted metal abundance of the x - ray gas in these simulations displays a mean and standard deviation of @xmath122  z@xmath46 , which is consistent with observational results for the low - redshift intergalactic medium @xcite , for the outskirts of groups @xcite and clusters of galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite ) , and for the intergalactic filaments from which these structures accrete material @xcite .",
    "hence , for the purpose of our spectral analysis , we here consider a fiducial value of @xmath123  z@xmath19 for the halo metal abundance ( while noting that the _ mass - weighted _ abundance in the simulations is substantially lower , as discussed in   [ sec , temperatures ] ) .",
    "finally , for the volume filling factor @xmath124 of hot gas , a value of unity is assumed for simplicity , since our simulations (   [ sec , comparison ] ) indicate high values of @xmath1251 .    using these assumptions and the appropriate acis - i response files ,",

    "the aim of this section is to explore the predictions of more sophisticated higher - resolution simulations assuming the currently prevailing @xmath17cdm cosmology , and test whether these can accommodate the observational constraints obtained for both our galaxies .      for this purpose ,",
    "we have employed cosmological treesph simulations of galaxy formation and evolution in a flat ( @xmath145 ) @xmath17cdm cosmology .",
    "the code , described in detail in @xcite and @xcite , incorporates energetic stellar feedback in the form of starburst - driven galactic winds .",
    "contrary to our earlier simulations used by @xcite to predict halo properties ( as discussed in ",
    "[ sec , intro ] and   [ sec , sample ] ) , the present simulations also incorporate self - consistent chemical evolution of the gas , including non - instantaneous recycling .",
    "they have also been evolved in time according to the entropy equation solving scheme of @xcite , rather than being based on the thermal energy equation , a modification which provides increased numerical accuracy in lower - resolution regions .",
    "in addition , the present simulations assume a cosmic baryon fraction of @xmath146 and have all been run from an initial redshift of @xmath147 with a mass resolution eight times higher than those described by @xcite . at 0.5  gyr before @xmath11 , each hot gas particle in the simulations was further split into 64 equal - mass particles to provide additional resolution of the hot gas phase , a procedure very similar to the one described by @xcite based on the same cosmological simulations .",
    "the final gas - phase resolution is thus 512 times that of the @xcite simulations , with the best resolved individual galaxies at @xmath11 featuring a total of @xmath148 hot gas particles within the central @xmath149  kpc , a hot gas mass resolution of @xmath150  m@xmath9 , and an sph smoothing length of @xmath151  kpc . as discussed by @xcite ,",
    "this resolution is sufficient to track thermal instabilities in the hot halo gas that may lead to the formation of warm ( @xmath10  k ) clouds within the ambient halo .",
    "although the simulation code includes stellar feedback , optionally enhanced to mimic agn outflows , powerful starburst - driven winds only occur in the simulations at early times ( @xmath1525 ) , where they help to solve the angular momentum problem , the missing satellites problem , and possibly other problems related to the cold dark matter scenario ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . at @xmath153 ,",
    "the sn  ii feedback is quite moderate in our simulations ; for a typical @xmath154  km  s@xmath3 disk galaxy , the star formation rate at @xmath11 is @xmath155  m@xmath19  yr@xmath3 , comparable to the modest star formation rate of the milky way disk .",
    "the feedback of the individual star particles in the simulations is furthermore spatially and temporally uncorrelated ( this is particularly true for sn  ia , whose mechanical , but not chemical , feedback is consequently neglected ) , so galactic winds do not easily develop at low redshift ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "hence , a comparison between the simulation output at @xmath11 and our two relatively quiescent galaxies seems justified .",
    "it is worth emphasizing that the feedback strength in the simulations is calibrated to reproduce the optical and morphological properties of observed galaxies .",
    "the x - ray emission is thus predicted without any additional adjustable parameters .    for the calculation of x - ray properties of the simulated galaxies",
    ", we followed the general procedure outlined by @xcite .",
    "for each of the simulated galaxies at @xmath156 , a catalog of sph gas particle positions , densities , temperatures , and masses was created .",
    "each sph particle was treated as an optically thin thermal plasma , and the associated x - ray luminosity calculated at the relevant position in a given photon energy band using the meka plasma emissivity code @xcite .",
    "total x - ray luminosities were then computed by summation over all particles in the volume of interest .",
    "the greatly increased numerical resolution of the present simulations at @xmath11 allowed us to bypass the additional smoothing over the individual gas particles employed by @xcite .",
    "however , as mentioned above , the increased resolution also facilitates the formation of small clouds within the hot halo via local thermal instabilities . since the presence of such relatively dense and cold clouds may unphysically boost the x - ray output of the hot gas in its immediate vicinity ( due to the local smoothing of particle properties inherent in sph techniques ) , hot gas particles within @xmath157 of `` cold '' ( @xmath158  k ) gas were discarded from the x - ray calculations .",
    "the removed gas generally constitutes an insignificant fraction ( @xmath159% ) of the total hot gas mass considered .",
    "a few comparisons between ngc5746 and results from an earlier version of these simulations were performed in @xcite . here",
    "we present a more detailed comparison based on the updated _ chandra _ analysis of ngc5746 , while also including the results for ngc5170 and for other , more actively star - forming , spirals as taken from the literature .",
    "further comparisons are made to our previous results described in @xcite , with the x - ray properties of the latter here re - calculated for the adopted aperture and energy band .",
    "however , in order to provide as fair a comparison as possible between the two simulation samples , we only consider the subset of the @xcite galaxies that was formed formed in simulations assuming the same flat ( @xmath160 , @xmath161 ) @xmath17cdm cosmology as adopted in our new simulations , and which assumed @xmath162 ( along with a fixed primordial chemical gas composition ) .",
    "note , as mentioned above , that this excludes all the @xcite galaxies with @xmath163  km  s@xmath3 , so a direct comparison of the toft et  al .",
    "results to our observed galaxies is not attempted here .",
    "one of the hot halo properties that can be most straightforwardly compared to observations is the diffuse x - ray luminosity . for all simulated galaxies , we derived the halo @xmath12 within the aperture also adopted for the ngc5746 halo analysis ( i.e.  a spherical volume extending to @xmath81  kpc , with the @xmath38 ellipse excluded as described in   [ sec , prop ] ) .",
    "the results are presented in figure  [ fig , lxvc ] , which shows a clear trend in hot halo @xmath12 with galaxy mass , measured by @xmath13 , for the simulated galaxies .",
    "also shown are the observational constraints on the halo luminosities of ngc5170 and ngc5746 .",
    "the simulation results are generally consistent with the constraints obtained for our observed galaxies , and we conclude that , within the adopted apertures , the lack of detectable extraplanar x - ray emission around either target agrees with these updated predictions for emission from cosmologically accreted gas",
    ".    there seems to be reasonable agreement between the results of @xcite and those of our newer simulations , but with a tendency towards a somewhat lower @xmath12 at a given @xmath13 for the latter .",
    "for example , for milky way ",
    "sized galaxies ( @xmath13 in the range 200250  km  s@xmath3 ) , the mean halo luminosity for the @xcite galaxies is @xmath164  erg  s@xmath3 , 75% higher than the corresponding result for the more recent simulations .",
    "we attribute this in part to the increased numerical resolution of the latter , as discussed in more detail later .",
    "nevertheless , the pseudo - bolometric ( 0.0110  kev ) halo luminosities @xmath165 in our new simulations remain consistent with the @xmath166 relationship found by @xcite , with an orthogonal regression fit in log@xmath12log@xmath13 space yielding @xmath167 for the new simulations .",
    "it is interesting to note that this dependence on the characteristic stellar velocity of the system mirrors that of the diffuse gas in _ early - type _ galaxies , whose x - ray luminosity roughly obeys @xmath168 ( based on the faber - jackson relation and the @xmath12@xmath169 relation of @xcite ) .",
    "the amount of hot x - ray gas surrounding the galaxies in our simulations depends not only on the mass of each galaxy s dark matter halo but also on the detailed accretion history of this halo .",
    "numerical calculations indicate that accretion histories of galaxy - sized halos can be highly disparate even for isolated galaxies of comparable mass ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "hence , any dependence of hot halo properties on @xmath13 can a priori be expected to be subject to considerable scatter . indeed , despite the clear trend in @xmath12 with @xmath13 for the simulated galaxies , it is important also to emphasize the considerable variation in predicted halo @xmath170 at a given circular velocity in fig .",
    "[ fig , lxvc ] . for example",
    ", the two most massive galaxies in our new simulation sample display a factor of five variation in 0.32  kev @xmath12 within the adopted aperture and yet are separated in `` mass '' by only @xmath171  km  s@xmath3 , comparable to typical observational uncertainties on @xmath13 .",
    "this large variation at a given @xmath13 is clearly an issue to keep in mind when comparing predicted and observed halo luminosities , or when attempting to predict hot halo fluxes for actual galaxies on the basis of simulation results .    in order to also facilitate comparison of the simulation predictions to other observational results ,",
    "we have compiled available constraints from the literature on extraplanar emission seen around other spirals , although we make no claims as to the completeness of this compilation ( note though that we have not included the results of @xcite , because it is not entirely clear to what extent , if any , these spirals show _ extraplanar _ emission ) .",
    "these results are also included in fig .",
    "[ fig , lxvc ] , but we stress that the halo luminosities in these cases have not necessarily been derived within the same aperture as adopted for ngc5746 and our simulated galaxies . for example , the results of @xcite were all derived at a distance @xmath172  kpc from the disk midplane . if instead adopting this aperture , the increase in @xmath12 predicted for our simulated galaxies is at the 1040  per  cent level , with no systematic dependence on @xmath13 .",
    "we expect similar corrections for the apertures used for the additional galaxies in the @xcite sample , where halo x - ray properties were constrained outside the h@xmath0 disk , again typically at @xmath172  kpc from the midplane .",
    "these changes are relatively small , well within the scatter seen for the simulated galaxies .    the @xcite results in fig .",
    "[ fig , lxvc ] include unresolved emission within regions of the optical disk ( though with the prominent dust lane in the sombrero galaxy excluded ; @xcite ) .",
    "hence , the true halo luminosities of these galaxies should be somewhat lower than indicated in this figure , although the apertures employed by li et  al .",
    "extend to smaller radii than adopted for ngc5746 and hence our simulated galaxies .",
    "we include these two data points in fig .",

    "the inferred hi mass in the disk of @xmath195  m@xmath46 , added to a stellar mass of @xmath196  m@xmath46 as estimated from the optical parameters in table  [ tab , galdata ] using the prescription of @xcite , implies that @xmath197% of the baryons in ngc5746 are in a hot phase within @xmath81  kpc . for ngc5170 ,",
    "the corresponding constraint is @xmath198% , based on a stellar mass of @xmath199  m@xmath46 and an hi mass of @xmath200  m@xmath46 @xcite .",
    "these fractions are expected to grow drastically with galactocentric distance , however , as most of the diffuse hot baryons associated with our simulated galaxies reside beyond the @xmath81  kpc aperture probed here .",
    "as discussed in detail in @xcite , the total mass of hot halo gas within the virial radius may equal or exceed the mass of cold baryons in the disk of a simulated @xmath186  km  s@xmath3 galaxy . for our observed galaxies ,",
    "this possibility is still allowed by our constraints in figure  [ fig , mgas ] , provided that the radial distribution of any hot halo gas around our galaxies is not significantly steeper than in these simulations .",
    "deeper x - ray observations would be required to test this scenario in detail , but observational verification of this prediction would clearly help in resolving the well - known `` missing baryon '' problem in disk galaxies .    as a final comparison between the simulations and our observational constraints , fig .",
    "[ fig , mgas]@xmath201 shows the results for the mean cool - out rate @xmath202 of hot gas within the ngc5746 aperture .",
    "again , a temperature cut at @xmath189  kev was imposed on the simulations , but @xmath203 was otherwise estimated in the same manner as for the observed galaxies (   [ sec , prop ] ) , i.e.  with hot gas cooling times @xmath139 derived assuming the metal - dependent cooling curves @xmath135 of @xcite .",
    "the figure reveals substantial scatter at any given @xmath13 and no clear systematic variation with this quantity .",
    "the simulation predictions again remain consistent with our observational results as listed in table  [ tab , halos ] .",
    "the difference between the @xcite and newer simulations is largely due to lower mean cooling times for the hot gas in the former , for the reason discussed above .",
    "it is important to note , however , that the estimated values of @xmath204 should not be identified with the actual accretion rate of hot halo gas onto the disk , in part because these estimates do not include the gas condensing out of the hot halo phase due to small - scale thermal instabilities ( see , e.g. @xcite ) , but more importantly because our @xmath203 does not take into account the gas cooling _ inside _ the inner boundary of the adopted aperture . in practice ,",
    "the derived values of @xmath203 should be considered lower limits to the true disk accretion rates in the simulations . for a detailed discussion of actual accretion rates for the simulated galaxies ,",
    "we refer to @xcite and @xcite .",
    "such a discussion is beyond the scope of this work , also because it is not straightforward to compare these rates to our observational constraints in table  [ tab , halos ] .",
    "we emphasize that the observational part of this study was initiated on the basis of the predictions of @xcite , which suggested that the performed observations of ngc5746 would be sufficiently sensitive to reveal the presence of an accreted hot halo .",
    "our newer simulations predict somewhat lower hot halo luminosities outside the disk , in consistency with the inferred absence of detectable hot halo gas around both ngc5746 and ngc5170 .",
    "it is nevertheless clear that observational results for massive galaxies are within factors of a few of the theoretical predictions for halo luminosity and gas mass , and can potentially begin to test the input physics in cosmological simulations .",
    "for example , the predicted hot gas mass for @xmath205  km  s@xmath3 galaxies is within a factor of 23 of the upper limit derived for ngc5746 .",
    "numerical effects aside , inferred halo x - ray luminosities of even more massive galaxies such as ngc4594 ( cf .  fig .",
    "[ fig , lxvc ] ) clearly leave limited scope for changes in the simulation input physics that would raise the predicted present - day halo @xmath12 , though with the caveat that the simulations show some `` cosmic variance '' at a given @xmath13 .",
    "further high - sensitivity observations may begin to seriously challenge the theoretical models and provide useful constraints on , for example , the galactic feedback prescriptions implemented in state - of - the - art numerical work .",
    "compared to the earlier results presented by @xcite , it is also clear that the x - ray luminosity and cool - out rate of hot halo gas are somewhat lower in the more recent simulations .",
    "one possible reason is the higher mass resolution of the latter , which helps to suppress the importance of a problem associated with the spatial smoothing inherent in sph techniques , namely the possibility that the properties of hot gas particles can become strongly affected by those of much colder and denser particles in their immediate vicinity . as a rough test of the impact of improving the hot gas mass resolution ,",
    "we re - simulated our lowest - mass ( @xmath206  km  s@xmath3 ) galaxy from @xmath147 at 64 times the @xcite resolution , with each hot gas particle then subsequently split into eight equal - mass ones at a later stage . at high @xmath207 , this version is thus eight times better resolved than the one shown in fig .",
    "[ fig , lxvc ] , and the halo @xmath12 is here found to be 50% lower . an additional test for a more massive galaxy , the @xmath208 version of the @xmath209  km  s@xmath3 disk in fig .",
    "[ fig , lxvc ] , showed little change in halo @xmath12 at higher resolution , however .",
    "this suggests that higher resolution may decrease the predicted @xmath12 somewhat , but the reduction is moderate ( well within the factor 45 in `` cosmic variance '' that is evident in fig .",
    "[ fig , lxvc ] ) , and @xmath12 may be close to convergence at the high - mass end .",
    "we do not currently have higher - resolution versions of our most massive galaxies at @xmath11 due to the prohibitive cpu times required , so more detailed tests of the impact of numerical resolution will remain the subject of future work .",
    "two other effects also act to reduce the present - day hot halo luminosity in the updated simulations , namely the higher assumed cosmic baryon fraction @xmath146 ( vs.  @xmath210 for the comparison galaxies of @xcite considered here ) and the higher metal abundance resulting from implementing chemical evolution in the simulation code .",
    "this may at first seem counter - intuitive , but the increased radiative cooling efficiency implied by both these modifications actually results in less hot and dense gas remaining in the halo at @xmath11 for a given @xmath13 ( see also @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "note that both the hot gas fraction and the total `` external '' ( non  disk ) baryon fraction inside the virial radius are reduced at fixed @xmath13 when assuming higher @xmath211 , not only because the accreted shock - heated gas can leave the x - ray phase more rapidly , but also because the virial radius itself decreases at a given @xmath13 as a consequence @xcite .    despite the reduced x - ray output in the current simulations",
    ", we readily acknowledge the points raised by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "their comparison of observational results obtained for ngc2613 and ngc4594 to the 0.22 kev luminosities of @xcite indicate that the latter overpredict total ( disk plus halo ) intrinsic x - ray luminosities by at least a factor of 10 for these massive galaxies .",
    "this discrepancy is at least in part related to the common over - cooling problem in hydrodynamical simulations , a problem which also plagues the current simulations at some level @xcite .",
    "however , driven by the requirement to avoid confusing any halo emission with emission produced by unrelated processes , we have to some extent circumvented that issue here by only considering the x - ray properties of gas outside the optical disk .",
    "note also that both the @xcite and present simulations do not incorporate the effects of intrinsic x - ray absorption by cold gas and dust in the disk , which can naturally be substantial for edge - on galaxies and may be non - trivial to properly correct for across the full optical extent of the galaxy in observational studies .    while our results suggest that increased numerical resolution may help to alleviate the issue of over - cooling somewhat , it is also possible , as hypothesized by @xcite , that some over - cooling in the simulations is related to incomplete treatment of feedback from sn  ia , if these can provide large - scale distributed heating .",
    "as mentioned , _ mechanical _ feedback from sn  ia is not included in the present simulations , but @xcite suggest that numerous sn  ia in early - type spirals ( such as ngc2613 , 4594 , and 5746 ) could generate a bulge wind which would be sufficiently powerful to suppress the cooling of any infalling halo material and lower its x - ray luminosity .",
    "observational verification of the presence of sn  ia  driven winds in spirals would certainly provide an important new ingredient to be incorporated in numerical simulations .",
    "our x - ray data of ngc5746 and ngc5170 do not allow a direct observational test of this scenario , apart from requiring such outflows to have x - ray luminosities below the inferred halo upper limits .",
    "the discussion pertaining to fig .",
    "[ fig , strickland ] , although based on somewhat simplistic assumptions , suggests that direct supernova blow - out of disk material is unlikely to be important in our two galaxies even if including sn  ia .",
    "our galaxies may therefore not represent optimal targets for an observational test of this scenario .",
    "@xcite also proposes another possible solution to the over - cooling problem , noting that the halo gas may be chemically inhomogeneous but generally very low in metallicity .",
    "while metal - rich clouds can cool out rapidly and fall towards the disk , most of the halo gas may thus radiate inefficiently and would be difficult to detect in either emission or absorption . although an interesting possibility , it is not obvious that this explanation may necessarily help to solve the over - cooling problem . as discussed above , the metal - free halos in the @xcite simulations are actually _ more _ x - ray luminous at a given @xmath13 at zero redshift than those in our more recent simulations . other factors such as",
    "the assumed cosmic @xmath211 in the simulations may play a role for this result , as already mentioned , but this difference between metal - enriched and metal - free halos persists even when considering halos in simulations run with identical cosmological parameters and numerical resolution @xcite . allowing for chemical enrichment in our simulations systematically reduces the predicted present - day halo luminosity for a given @xmath13 .    on the observational front",
    ", it is generally well established that disk galaxies have experienced considerable stellar mass growth since @xmath212 ( e.g.  @xcite and references therein ) , and both observational and theoretical evidence suggests that gas consumption , rather than major merger activity , has played the dominant role in driving this growth @xcite .",
    "the hot halos discussed in this paper could potentially have supplied most of the fuel required for the continued growth of disks , provided that cool - out of such gas is not strongly inhibited by , for example , disk feedback processes . despite the absence of a detectable large - scale x - ray corona around either of our target galaxies , hot coronal gas surrounding both targets",
    "could still be present below our detection limits .",
    "it remains unclear , however , to what extent any such gas is currently cooling out to replenish the gas consumed by star formation in their disks , and if so , whether this proceeds mainly as a central cooling flow or through condensation and infall of small clouds across a wide range of galactocentric distances within a hot halo . for ngc5746",
    ", our naive constraint on the cool - out rate of hot halo gas outside the optical disk , @xmath213  m@xmath46  yr@xmath3 , suggests that large - scale cooling from a hot halo can not balance the sfr in the disk of @xmath49  m@xmath46  yr@xmath3 .",
    "it is important to reiterate , however , that the estimated cooling rates should be considered lower limits to the total rate at which halo gas may leave the hot phase and accrete onto the disk (   [ sec , mass ] ) , so our results are not necessarily inconsistent with the possibility that a hot halo around ngc5746 can supply the disk with material at rates comparable to the sfr . for ngc5170 ,",
    "the weaker upper limit on @xmath203 is a factor of @xmath214 above the inferred sfr , again precluding any definitive conclusions in this regard .    as suggested by a number of theoretical models , and , indeed , by the simulations presented here ( see @xcite ) , local thermal instabilities within a hot halo can also produce small pressure - supported clouds that would fall towards the disk on time - scales well below the cooling time of the ambient hot gas .",
    "this would contribute to feeding ongoing star formation and could potentially represent the dominant accretion mode for milky way ",
    "sized spirals @xcite .",
    "however , hi observations of nearby spirals generally suggest that infall of cold gas does not occur at rates sufficient to sustain star formation in the disk @xcite . hence",
    ", infall of additional , possibly hot , material ( at an average rate of @xmath215  m@xmath46  yr@xmath3 ) seems required to balance gas consumption by star formation , in line with the findings of @xcite .",
    "of particular relevance here is the study of @xcite , who searched for evidence of an extended hi component around ngc5746 associated with infalling cold clouds .",
    "while the presence of vertically extended hi was detected , the majority of this gas is best interpreted as a warp rather than as an extended hi halo such as has been reported around a number of other nearby spirals @xcite .",
    "a number of high-@xmath216 neutral clouds were also seen , possibly representing infalling material , though association with a disk  halo flow can not be excluded for most of these .",
    "no corresponding study has , to our knowledge , been conducted for ngc5170 .",
    "thus , given the present data , it remains debatable whether the current sfr in galaxies such as ngc5746 can be balanced by infall of halo material .",
    "cold gas accretion alone seems insufficient both in ngc5746 and in other nearby spirals , and our upper limit on the hot gas infall rate does not include gas cooling out within the disk region itself , so the interpretation of the observational x - ray results is not straightforward .",
    "it is apparent , however , that cooling of hot halo gas outside the optical @xmath38 ellipse may not be able to balance star formation in ngc5746 .",
    "interestingly , @xcite offer a different accretion scenario that may reconcile the discrepant accretion and sfr estimates in nearby spirals without invoking substantial direct cool - out of hot halo material . in their model , accretion has an important contribution from supernova  ejected fountain clouds which sweep up ( hot or cold ) ambient halo gas before returning to the disk , losing angular momentum in the process .",
    "their combined fountain plus accretion models provide a better match to the extraplanar hi velocity distribution in a few well - studied edge - on spirals than a fountain model alone , and yield accretion rates comparable to the sfr in these galaxies .",
    "direct observational verification of this scenario may prove difficult , however , and cosmological simulations still lack the resolution to adequately capture such processes .",
    "we have used x - ray data to re - visit our earlier claimed detection @xcite of a large - scale diffuse x - ray halo surrounding the massive edge - on spiral ngc5746 .",
    "an analogous analysis of the less massive ngc5170 has been completed for comparison .",
    "our updated _ chandra _ analysis employs calibration data which accounts for the positional dependence of the contaminant on the _ chandra _ optical blocking filters ( unlike the @xcite analysis , which could not take this into account ) , and has failed to reveal a statistically significant detection of extraplanar x - ray emission around either galaxy .",
    "we find that both the spatial and spectral hot halo properties of ngc5746 as reported by @xcite are consistent with being due to the spatial variation of the degradation in the acis ccd quantum efficiencies .",
    "both our target galaxies show no signs of significant nuclear or star formation activity .",
    "this is supported by our h@xmath0 imaging of both galaxies and by radio data taken from the literature , suggesting that the constraints on extraplanar x - ray emission obtained for both galaxies can be used to also place constraints on the properties of intergalactic , shock - heated material accreting onto their disks as predicted by disk galaxy formation models and cosmological hydro - simulations .",
    "if assuming halo gas close to the expected virial temperature as suggested by such theoretical work , we constrain the total 0.32  kev luminosity of the halos within @xmath81  kpc from the optical disk to @xmath217 ( ngc5746 ) and @xmath112  erg  s@xmath3 ( ngc5170 ) at @xmath1 significance .",
    "the corresponding hot gas masses are @xmath218 and @xmath219  m@xmath46 , respectively .",
    "we have performed a detailed comparison of these constraints to results of recent cosmological simulations of galaxy formation and evolution .",
    "these simulations represent an update of our earlier work in @xcite , and predict hot halo luminosities and gas masses which are consistent with the limits obtained for both ngc5746 and ngc5170 . outside the optical disk ,",
    "the simulations show hot halo luminosities which are somewhat lower than the @xcite results , specifically by a factor of two for milky way ",
    "sized galaxies , mainly due to increased numerical resolution , the assumption of a higher baryon fraction , and the inclusion of chemical feedback .",
    "we find that `` cosmic variance '' in simulated halo properties can be quite substantial , with halo @xmath12 potentially varying by a factor 45 for galaxies of comparable mass as measured by their disk circular velocity @xmath13",
    ".    published results for all other galaxies with detected extraplanar emission can generally accommodate our simulation predictions , but observational results for high - mass spirals are clearly providing strong constraints on theoretical models for disk galaxy evolution .",
    "based on the inferred halo temperatures and luminosities , we confirm that the hot halo emission so far observed around other spirals is in general predominantly related to activity in the disk rather than being caused by infalling , externally accreted material .",
    "an unambiguous detection of externally accreted x - ray emitting gas around spirals is still pending .",
    "deeper x - ray observations of carefully selected targets are required to detect such halos , but , encouragingly , our simulations suggest that this remains within reach of current x - ray instrumentation .",
    "based on a rather modest _",
    "chandra _ exposure of less than 40  ks , we have constrained an x - ray luminosity and hot gas mass around ngc5746 which are both within a factor of a few of the simulation predictions for a galaxy of this mass .",

    "<S> models of disk galaxy formation commonly predict the existence of an extended reservoir of accreted hot gas surrounding massive spirals at low redshift . as a test of these models , we use x - ray and h@xmath0 data of the two massive , quiescent edge - on spirals ngc5746 and ngc5170 to investigate the amount and origin of any hot gas in their halos . </S>",
    "<S> contrary to our earlier claim , the _ chandra _ analysis of ngc5746 , employing more recent calibration data , does not reveal any significant evidence for diffuse x - ray emission outside the optical disk , with a @xmath1 upper limit to the halo x - ray luminosity of @xmath2  erg  s@xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> an identical study of the less massive ngc5170 also fails to detect any extraplanar x - ray emission . by extracting hot halo properties of disk galaxies formed in cosmological hydrodynamical simulations , we compare these results to expectations for cosmological accretion of hot gas by spirals . for milky way  </S>",
    "<S> sized galaxies , these high - resolution simulations predict hot halo x - ray luminosities which are lower by a factor of @xmath4 compared to our earlier results reported by toft et  al .  </S>",
    "<S> ( 2002 ) . </S>",
    "<S> we find the new simulation predictions to be consistent with our observational constraints for both ngc5746 and ngc5170 , while also confirming that the hot gas detected so far around more actively star - forming spirals is in general probably associated with stellar activity in the disk . </S>",
    "<S> observational results on quiescent disk galaxies at the high - mass end are nevertheless providing powerful constraints on theoretical predictions , and hence on the assumed input physics in numerical studies of disk galaxy formation and evolution . </S>"
