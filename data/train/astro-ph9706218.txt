    "the luminous seyfert 2 galaxy ngc 1068 lies at the forefront of attempts to unify the broader class of `` active galaxies '' within a single physical framework @xcite .",
    "thus , it is surprising that so little is known of the large - scale gas motions in this nearby galaxy and , in particular , their connection with the nuclear activity .",
    "ngc 1068 was observed on the night of dec .  8 , 1985 using the hawaii imaging fabry - perot interferometer ( hifi ) at the cfh 3.6 m telescope .",
    "the observations were made using an etalon with 85  free spectral range and a reflective finesse of 60 .",
    "ngc 1068 was observed through two 50  fwhm blocking filters with central wavelengths @xmath06615 and @xmath06585 to cover  and the neighbouring lines of @xmath16548,6583 .",
    "observations were also taken for the  lines over the period dec .  5 - 7 , 1985 but",
    "cirrus and variable weather conditions have compromised these data .",
    "the fabry - perot system is placed at the f/8 cassegrain focus and has an output beam of f/2 after focal reduction . at the time of the observations ,",
    "the best available imaging detector was the ti @xmath2 3-phase ccd whose 15@xmath3 pixels subtend 0.43  on the sky giving a @xmath4 field - of - view .",
    "the data have a velocity resolution of 65  fwhm .",
    "the  and blue  lines were sampled at 40 , while the red  line was sampled more coarsely at 78 .",
    "the etalon produces a total velocity coverage of @xmath54000  free of order confusion although only half this range was observed .",
    "the spatial resolution of the data is 1  in regions of high signal - to - noise ratio ( e.g. the starburst ring ) , and roughly 2 in the diffuse gas .",
    "= 6.2truecm = 6.2truecm    = 6.2truecm = 6.2truecm    = 6.2truecm      deep optical and  images of ngc 1068 ( fig .",
    "[ oval ] ) show an outer @xmath6shaped ring and a bright central disk with diameter @xmath520 kpc oriented perpendicular to the outer ring .",
    "the innermost @xmath7 band contour has the same dimension as the stellar bar seen at @xmath8 ( fig .",
    "[ bar ] ) . in fig .",
    "[ kinematics ] , we present the velocity field for the ionized gas over the inner disk . the velocity field is shown for a field of view of 100  and reveals a series of concentric `` kinematic spiral arms '' which appear superimposed on ordered , large - scale rotation . as shown in fig .",
    "[ gasrot ] , the large - scale disk appears to undergo flat rotation beyond a radius of 1.5 kpc with a kinematic major axis that is consistent with the photometric position angle of the outer ring . across the inner 40 ,",
    "the z - symmetric velocity contours are the hallmark of highly radial orbits along a bar ( e.g.  huntley 1978 ) .",
    "thus , the observed elliptic streaming is consistent with the presence of the stellar bar detected at near - infrared wavelengths @xcite .      in fig .",
    "[ kinematics]@xmath9 , the velocity field of the ionized gas is derived from the weighted sum of the  and  kinematics .",
    "ngc 1068 has probably the most completely observed velocity field of any barred spiral galaxy due to a ` diffuse ionized medium ' which pervades the inner disk @xcite .",
    "the large - scale disk clearly undergoes ordered rotation . however ,",
    "notice the bisymmetric streaming features @xmath10 to the east and west of the nucleus , which are particularly apparent in the residual velocity field ( fig .",
    "[ kinematics]@xmath11 ) after subtracting a rotating disk model .",
    "these are retarded with respect to the circular motion by 10  on average reaching 30  in places , which probably corresponds to 30  up to 50 in the plane of the galaxy .",
    "additional kinematic spiral anomalies at larger radius are more diffuse . the characteristic z - symmetry of an oval distortion ( cf .",
    "14 of roberts , 1979 ) can be traced all the way into the nucleus from the southwest , where the southeastern spiral feature is less noticeable . to the north ,",
    "the spiral feature exhibits continuity in velocity as it crosses the elliptic ring .",
    "the western kinematic feature has a counterpart in the flux map ( fig .",
    "[ streamer ] ) .    the ,  ( 21  cm ) , and @xmath12co ( @xmath13 ) rotation curves are presented in fig .  [ gasrot ] .",
    "there is good agreement between the co @xcite and the  kinematics although rather less agreement with the data ( vla observations supplied by h.  liszt ) .",
    "however , the  data use a 15  beam and the data have yet to be corrected for beam smearing and absorption in the centre .",
    "the velocity field shows extensive evidence for strong density wave streaming on all scales . in the  data , there is a sharp transition region between 0  and 10  where the pa changes smoothly between 225@xmath14 and 80@xmath14 @xcite .",
    "a similar effect is seen in the  data between 70  and 100  where the pa changes smoothly from 91@xmath14 to 106 . for the  and co ring fits ,",
    "the adopted inclination was 40@xmath14 although the orbit pa was a free parameter .    by subtracting the simple model of elliptic streaming overlayed on flat rotation",
    ", we have discovered bisymmetric spiral streamers in both the ionized line flux and kinematics that penetrate from @xmath51 kpc to within 100 pc of the agn .",
    "we find evidence for this effect in both the co line flux and kinematics , albeit at lower spatial resolution @xcite . by implication ,",
    "it is likely that the observed non - circular motions are confined to the galactic plane and arise from bar - driven density waves . in collaboration with harvey liszt ( national radio astronomical observatory ) , we find tentative evidence that , while the @xmath021 cm and co kinematics are largely consistent , the  kinematics show substantial deviations from the cold phase at many positions within the inner disk away from the spiral streamers .",
    "several studies of the gaseous response to rotating bar potentials can be found in the literature ( e.g. , huntley , 1978 ; athanassoula , 1992 ) .",
    "one of the main results is the occurrence of shocks at characteristic positions .",
    "one of these is an often tightly wound , trailing , and bisymmetric spiral starting at both ends of the bar , exactly as observed for ngc 1068 ( fig .",
    "[ bar]@xmath11 ) . associated with the shock is dust and cool gas visible in co emission as spiral arms in fig .",
    "[ bar]@xmath9 .",
    "another place where shocks typically appear is along the bar usually somewhat offset from the major axis in the leading direction . for ncg 1068 ,",
    "helfer & blitz ( 1995 ) detected co emission along the bar which indeed appears offset from the stellar bar s major axis towards the leading edge ( fig .",
    "[ bar]@xmath9 ) .",
    "moreover , the models often have a central concentration of gas orbiting on near - circular , so - called x2-orbits , also evident in co observations of ngc 1068 .",
    "thus , _ qualitatively _ , this fits nicely into the overall picture of the bar rotating prograde with respect to the disk .",
    "however , theoretical studies also revealed a sensitive dependence of position and strength of the shocks to overall quantities such as pattern speed , bar strength , central mass concentration , and sound speed of the gas .",
    "for a _ quantitative _ understanding of the gaseous morphology and kinematics in ngc 1068 , a more detailed study is therefore highly desirable incorporating all information that is available on those quantities . in particular ,",
    "the nir light ought to be a good tracer of the underlying ( stellar ) mass distribution .",
    "using nir light as mass tracer to construct the gravitational potential for barred galaxies is by now a common technique ( e.g. , quillen , 1994 ) .",
    "a little complication , which arises in the case of ngc 1068 , is the presence of a central point source due to dust heated by the central agn and emitting in the nir . here",
    ", we used three @xmath8-band images , ( a ) a very high - resolution ( 02 fwhm ) image of the centre , ( b ) a high - resolution image ( 04 fwhm ) of the stellar bar , and ( c ) a low resolution image ( 2  fwhm ) of the whole disk .",
    "the latter of these was supplied by h.  thronson @xcite , while images a and b where obtained with sharp at the ntt ( 3.5 m ) using short exposures ( 0.1 and 0.5 seconds , respectively ) in conjunction with a shift - and - add technique @xcite .",
    "a scaled psf ( an image of a star obtained under the same conditions ) accounting for the point source was subtracted from image a , of which subsequently the azimuthally averaged luminosity profile was evaluated . to correct image b for the central point source , it was first split into non - axisymmetric and axisymmetric ( azimuthally averaged ) parts ; second",
    ", inside 28 the latter was replaced by the profile obtained from image a ; and finally , these were added back to the non - axisymmetric part .",
    "this procedure gave a high - resolution map of the stellar nir emission inside 30 .",
    "finally , the map was extended with image c ( though with lower resolution ) to @xmath15 corresponding to @xmath16 .",
    "= 6.2truecm = 6.2truecm    from this map a mass model was derived as follows : ( i ) a spherical model for the central ( apparently round ) bulge was subtracted ; ( ii ) the remaining disk was de - inclined assuming pa=106  and @xmath17=40 @xcite ; ( iii ) the resulting surface density was vertically thickened by the profile @xmath18 with @xmath19=200 pc ; and ( iv ) the spherical model for the central bulge was added back .",
    "similarly , dark mass components such as a central black hole and a halo may be added .",
    "the scale height of 200 pc is in agreement with a ratio of @xmath20 between scale height and length typical for disk galaxies in the infrared @xcite .    clearly , many parameters entering the above procedure are a priori not very well determined , e.g. , the scale height and black hole mass . in particular , the dominance of the hot dust in the centre causes considerable uncertainty in the central stellar light distribution .",
    "here we have used a @xmath21-model @xcite for the bulge component , the volume density of which , @xmath22 is proportional to @xmath23 for @xmath24 much smaller than the scale radius @xmath25 and falls off as @xmath26 at large radii .",
    "our parameters , @xmath27 and @xmath28 , are not well constrained by the @xmath8 band photometry . for the future",
    ", we plan to improve on this point by taking into account also the @xmath29 and @xmath30 band which are less sensitive to emission from the hot dust in the centre . these data , in combination with the @xmath8 image ,",
    "may also be used to correct for dust absorption along the bar , which can be a problem particularly near the shocks .    the volume density in the plane of the galaxy resulting from this procdure is shown in fig .",
    "[ mass - model]@xmath9 . as can be seen from the spacing of the contours ,",
    "the scale length of the central bar is significantly smaller than that of the outer oval .",
    "for gas kinematics and hydro - dynamical simulations , only the potential ( and forces ) in the plane @xmath31 are of interest . for the disk",
    "this has been evaluated from the expansion of the density in azimuthal harmonics up to order @xmath32 .",
    "the gravitational potential of the bulge model is given by @xmath33 \\qquad      & \\gamma\\neq2 \\\\ & \\\\",
    "\\displaystyle \\ln{r\\over r+r_0 } & \\gamma=2    \\end{array } \\right.\\ ] ] fig .",
    "[ mass - model]@xmath11 shows isocontours of the potential due to disk and bulge .    in the future we plan to numerically evaluate the gaseous response to the mass model and compare the resulting gas distribution and kinematics with those observed ( cf .  the previous sections ) .",
    "whether or not these data allow us to pin down all the unknown quantities ( e.g. , the central mass concentration ) remains to be seen .",
    "however , the simulations published in the literature suggest that gas observation do  and thus _ must _ be used in order",
    "to  constrain these quantities .",
    "in the context of standard spiral density waves , the expected large - scale shocks lead to a phase shift between the gas response and driving stellar bar",
    ". the resulting mass inflow may dominate standard viscous accretion . on much smaller scales , it is unlikely that such shocks can be sustained .",
    "therefore , the shock mechanism is likely to be important at intermediate scales ( 0.1 to a few kpc ) .",
    "the mass inflow rate can then be computed in terms of the gas properties , the underlying mass distribution , and the pattern speed . in future",
    "we shall attempt a self - consistent fit to these parameters , particularly the shock strength , which will require gas dynamic modeling .",
    "ultimately , we would like to address the implications of these observations for fueling nuclear activity .",
    "a mass model is a precursor to running a full hydro - dynamical simulation .",
    "we thank h.  liszt for allowing us to present unpublished vla observations of the  distribution , and b.  garca - lorenzo who supplied the stellar velocities for fig .",
    "[ gasrot ] .",
    "we would also like to thank h.  thronson for the large - scale @xmath8 band image .",
