    "driven stochastic diffusive flow of particles in narrow channels is widely used as a prototype process to study dynamic scaling .",
    "the central interests in such processes reside with the structure of non - equilibrium stationary ( nes ) states , the dynamical pathways to those nes states , and the scaling properties of dynamic phase transitions . driven stochastic processes often undergo dynamic phase transitions inside their nes states as a function of control parameters .",
    "this is true even in one dimension where equilibrium phase transitions are forbidden .",
    "one - dimensional ( 1d ) processes serve thus as ideal platforms to unearth novel general principles affecting the dynamic scaling properties and the structure of nes state distributions . the maximum entropy principle familiar from thermal equilibrium , leading to the gibbs distribution , does not apply to driven systems .",
    "we need to formulate new principles , if possible , to predict the structures of nes states  @xcite .",
    "such principles can emerge from the study of a wide array of specific processes , in particular using numerical simulations and/or exact solutions .    in this paper",
    ", we address how clustering induced by nonlocal stick - slip events affects 1d driven stochastic diffusive flow .",
    "our model is a generalization of the conventional asymmetric exclusion process ( asep )  @xcite .",
    "we allow nonlocal forward hopping events across empty stretches of road , which introduces an instability towards an ` empty - road ' ( er ) phase .",
    "clustering and queuing has been studied recently in different generalizations of asep . in the conventional asep , particles hop stochastically in a preferred direction along a loop , without being able to pass each other and with the occupation of each site limited to one . that asep stationary state",
    "is surprisingly trivial , completely disordered .",
    "however , it is very sensitive to defects and boundary conditions .",
    "the sensitivity to reservoirs in open boundary type set - ups was discovered first . in that set - up the stationary state",
    "is known exactly by the so - called matrix product ansatz  @xcite .",
    "the two reservoirs at the edges of the channel compete with the bulk for control over the bulk density @xmath0 and the average flow rate .",
    "this gives rise to phase transitions between bulk and reservoir controlled phases .",
    "the latter can be viewed as elementary forms of queuing ( traffic jams ) .",
    "the density profiles near reservoirs have exponential or power - law tails .",
    "the scaling properties remain rather simple and are qualitatively understood from the fact that the asep bulk stationary state is fully uncorrelated , while fluctuations spread as @xmath1 with @xmath2 , and travel with group velocity @xmath3 ( see e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) .    introducing bulk impurities to asep ,",
    "e.g. , a single slow - bond in the bulk , represents the next level of complexity in queuing .",
    "such a single static defect creates more intricate types of jamming than edges , because , unlike reservoirs , information and correlations can travel across the obstacle .",
    "recently we demonstrated that the scaling properties of the slow - bond queuing transition are non - trivial .",
    "we established the existence of an intermediate phase with a pure power - law shaped queue , and showed that the transition into the macroscopic jammed phase does not take place until a finite strength of the obstruction  @xcite .",
    "a next step in the queuing and clustering saga is to allow such impurities to be mobile and participate in the dynamics .",
    "macroscopic clustering represents jamming . for example , in the two species process by arndt _ et al . _",
    "@xcite particles of opposite charge hop in opposite directions and the passing of species creates jamming .",
    "the stationary states of such processes show strong clustering .",
    "the possibility of phase separation into macroscopic clustered states is discussed at length in the literature both numerically  @xcite and analytically  @xcite as well as the link to the zero - range process ( zrp )  @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we study queuing caused by a different mechanism . in our generalization of asep",
    ", clustering is induced by nonlocal hopping events .",
    "a particle can jump with probability @xmath4 to the nearest - neighbor site ( if empty ) or with probability @xmath5 all the way forward to the site immediately behind the particle in front of it .",
    "we use open boundary conditions with reservoirs at both edges .",
    "starting - off as uniform at @xmath6 , the stationary state becomes increasingly lumpy with well - defined clusters as @xmath5 increases .",
    "then , at a critical value @xmath7 , this clustered liquid becomes unstable and the road empties out .",
    "the location and the nature of this phase transition are our main concerns .",
    "the transition turns out to be discontinuous or critical .",
    "clustering and coarsening prove to be essential in explaining both .",
    "clustering is quite common in driven stochastic flow .",
    "it appeared for example in the two species type process by arndt _",
    "et al_.  @xcite .",
    "those clusters were successfully described by the zrp  @xcite , which have zero drift . in our process , the nonlocality induces clustering with nonzero drift .",
    "more importantly , that aspect induces first- and second - order phase transitions , and the scaling properties of those are governed by the clustering .    this process and its phase transitions also relate to various viscous and/or dissipative stick - slip type phenomena , where the particle number is the only locally conserved variable .",
    "potential applications include traffic and/or granular flow  @xcite , the motion of stick and flow in sandpiles  @xcite , phase separation in steady sedimentation of colloidal crystals  @xcite , electronic and/or molecular transport in nanoscale systems  @xcite , phase ordering in rough films  @xcite , the motion of molecular motors driven by atp  @xcite , the motion of a depinned flux lattice in a current - carrying superconductor  @xcite and so on .",
    "nonlocal hopping can be used to mimic the dynamic features associated with , e.g. , the competition between maximum and minimum speed / drift in traffic / granular flow , inertia of falling grains inside avalanche processes in sandpiles , and the role of gravity in dynamic and static sedimentation .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section  [ model ] , we present numerical results for the phase diagram , clustering , and the nature of the phase transitions . in section  [ free ] ,",
    "we setup a self - consistent free cluster analysis , in which the stationary state is described in terms of a collection of freely drifting clusters , i.e. , self - organized mesoscopic collective objects that absorb and emit individual particles constantly .",
    "the first - order segment of the phase transition line is explained as the result of a turn - about in the drift velocity of those free clusters .",
    "the critical segment of the transition line is caused by starvation and the fluctuations in the density near the entry reservoir become crucial . to describe this ,",
    "we extend in section  [ mother ] the self - consistent cluster analysis to the mother cluster , which is the cluster attached to the entry point reservoir .",
    "this analysis explains the numerical details of the critical transition presented in section  [ numerical ] , and discussed in section  [ separate ] .",
