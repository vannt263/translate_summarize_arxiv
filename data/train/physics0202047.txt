    "( [ fp ] ) , does not react back on the velocity field .",
    "this is the case , for instance , in a neutrally stratified boundary layer ( occurring , e.g. , under windy conditions with a complete cloud cover ) where buoyancy forces are negligible compared to the other terms in the navier - stokes ( ns ) equations ruling the velocity field dynamics . in this case",
    ", temperature behaves as a passive scalar as a good approximation .",
    "+ as a matter of fact , during the diurnal cycle neutral stratification is rarely observed in the abl ( garratt , 1999 ) .",
    "more frequently , one observes stable conditions ( occurring , e.g. , at night in response to surface cooling by longwave emission to space ) or unstable , convective , ones ( occurring , e.g. , when strong surface heating produces thermal instability or convection ) . the role of temperature is active in both cases , that amounts to say that temperature drives the velocity field dynamics through the buoyancy contribution ( usually modeled by means of the well - known boussinesq coupling ) .",
    "the latter contribution is now the leading one in the ns equations .",
    "the main feature characterizing both active and passive scalar dynamics is the presence of strong fluctuations in the temperature field .",
    "such fluctuations affect the whole range of scales involved in the temperature dynamics , from the largest scales of motion to the smallest ones where diffusive effects become important .",
    "this huge excitation of degrees of freedom , gives meaning to the term `` scalar turbulence '' recently used to denote the dynamics of temperature fluctuations ( shraiman and siggia , 2000 ) .",
    "the first unpleasant consequence of persistent fluctuations is the failure of any attempt to construct dimensional theories for the statistics of temperature fluctuations ( frisch , 1995 ) , quantitatively defined as temperature differences @xmath11 between points separated by @xmath12 : @xmath13 .",
    "the common strategy for dimensional approaches consists to define _ typical _ length / time scales and _ typical _",

    "one has , in other words , ` single - scale fluctuations ' ; that amounts to say that it is irrelevant which part of the probability density function of temperature differences is sampled to define a typical fluctuation .    rather than the above simple scenario predicted by dimensional theories ,",
    "turbulent systems show an infinite hierarchy of ` independent ' fluctuations ( frisch , 1995 ) , that amounts to say the strong dependence on the order @xmath20 considered to define the typical fluctuation .",
    "more quantitatively , turbulent systems exhibit a nonlinear behavior of @xmath22 vs @xmath20 where the infinite set of exponents , @xmath22 , select different classes of fluctuations",
    ". the departure of the actual curve of @xmath22 vs @xmath20 from the linear ( dimensional ) prediction is named `` intermittency '' or `` anomalous scaling '' ( frisch , 1995 ) .",
    "intermittency is probably the most representative property characterizing a turbulent system .",
    "our aim here is to provide a statistical characterization of temperature fluctuations in a convective boundary layer dominated by well - organized plumes , simulated by a large eddy simulation model ( moeng , 1984 ) .",
    "+ we shall focus , in particular , on the statistical characterization of two different classes of fluctuations : weak temperature fluctuations , mainly occurring in the inner plume regions and strong temperature fluctuations , associated to the plume interfaces ( see fig .  1 ) .",
    "as we shall show , weak fluctuations are associated to linear behavior of scaling exponents @xmath22 vs @xmath20 for small @xmath20 s , while strong fluctuations ( captured by large @xmath20 s ) cause the so - called intermittency saturations , i.e. the curve @xmath22 vs @xmath20 tends a to a constant value , @xmath25 , for @xmath20 large enough .",

[ geom ] ) to the fractal dimension of the set hosting large temperature excursions : @xmath26 , where @xmath27 and @xmath28 are the usual dimension of the space and the fractal dimension of the large temperature fluctuation set , respectively .",
    "+ despite the complexity of temperature fluctuation dynamics in a convective boundary layer ( cbl ) , reflected in the strong intermittency of the system , only two exponents are necessary to capture most of the statistics of temperature fluctuations . + it is worth emphasizing that the same statistical characterization has been recently found for two dimensional idealized models of both passive ( see frisch et al ( 1999 ) , celani et al ( 2000 ) and celani et al ( 2001a ) ) and active scalar turbulence ( see celani et al ( 2001b ) ) simulated by means of both direct numerical simulations and lagrangian methods ( see , e.g. , frisch et al ( 1998 ) ) .",

    "the aim of this section is to provide a quick summary of the statistical tools we have exploited to characterize temperature fluctuations in a cbl .",

    "[ risu ] , separations @xmath1 will be taken along @xmath33-@xmath34 planes in the direction forming an angle of @xmath36 with the geostrophic wind direction .",
    "we shall thus denote our pdf simply as @xmath37 .",
    "the choice for the direction @xmath36 has been done in order to reduce the contamination of the scaling exponents by anisotropic effects .",
    "more details on this ` magic ' angle can be found in celani et al .",
    "( 2001a ) .    by definition , weak fluctuations ( i.e. small values of @xmath38 with respect to a typical fluctuation defined as @xmath39^{1/2}$ ] )",

    "+ the above considerations can be easily paraphrased in terms of the moments , @xmath41 , known as structure functions .",
    "large fluctuations are captured by large @xmath20 s , while weak fluctuations by small @xmath20 s .",

    "+ the scaling exponents @xmath60 thus tend to a constant value @xmath56 for orders , @xmath20 s large enough .",
    "such behavior justifies the word ` saturation ' to denote the laws ( [ resca ] ) and ( [ pawer ] ) .",
    "in order to gather statistical informations on the turbulent structure of a cbl , we used the les code described in moeng ( 1984 ) and sullivan et al ( 1994 ) .",
    "such model has been widely used and tested to investigate fundamental problems in the framework of boundary layers ( see , e.g. , moeng and wyngaard ( 1989 ) , moeng et al .",
    "( 1992 ) , andrn and moeng ( 1993 ) , moeng and sullivan ( 1994 ) , among the others ) .",
    "+ for this reason we confine ourselves only on general aspects of the les strategy .",
    "details can be found in the aforementioned references .",
    "the key point of the les strategy is that the large scale motion ( i.e. motion associated to the large turbulent eddies ) is explicitly solved while the smallest scales ( typically in the inertial range of scales ) are described in a statistical consistent way ( i.e. parameterized in terms of the resolved , large scale , velocity and temperature fields ) .",
    "this is done by filtering the governing equations for velocity and potential temperature by means of a filter operator .",
    "applied , e.g. , to the potential temperature field @xmath3 , the filter is defined as the convolution : @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the filtered variable and @xmath63 is a tridimensional filter function .",
    "the field @xmath3 can be thus decomposed as @xmath64 applying the filter operator both to the navier ",
    "stokes equations and to the equation for the potential temperature , and exploiting the decomposition ( [ decom ] ) ( and the analogous for the velocity field ) in the advection terms one obtains the corresponding filtered equations . for the sake of brevity , we report the sole filtered equation for the potential temperature : @xmath65 where @xmath66 are the subgrid turbulence fluxes of virtual temperature ( in short sgs fluxes ) .",
    "they are related to the resolved - scale field as @xmath67 @xmath68 being the sgs eddy coefficient for heat .",
    "a similar expression holds for the subgrid turbulence fluxes of momentum ( see moeng , 1984 ) that are defined in terms of the sgs eddy coefficient for momentum ( @xmath69 ) .",
    "+ the above two eddy coefficients are related to the velocity scale @xmath70 , @xmath71 being the sgs turbulence energy the equation of which is solved in this model , and to the length scale @xmath72 ( valid for the convective cases ) @xmath73 , @xmath74 , and @xmath75 being the grid mesh spacing in @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "namely : @xmath76 @xmath77",
    "in the present first study , our attention has been focused on the simulation b ( hereafter referred to as sim b ) by moeng and sullivan ( 1994 ) .",
    "sim b is a buoyancy - dominated flow with a relatively small shear effect , where vigorous thermals ( see again fig .  1 ) set up due to buoyancy force .",
    "+ the sole difference of our simulation with respect to the moeng and sullivan s simulation is the increased spatial resolution , here of @xmath78 grid points . + a preliminary sensitivity test at the lower resolution @xmath79 ( as in moeng and sullivan ( 1994 ) )",
    "did not show significant differences in the results we are going to present .",
    "sensitivity tests at higher resolutions are still in progress and seem to confirm our preceding conclusion .",
    "our choice for a convective boundary layer lies on the fact that , in such regimes , dependence of resolved fields on sgs parameterization should be very weak , and thus les strategy appears completely justified .",
    "indeed , in convective regimes , sgs motion acts as net energy sinks that drain energy from the resolved motion .",
    "this is another way to say that energy blows from large scales of motion toward the smallest scales and the cumulative ( statistical ) effect of the latter scales can be successfully captured by means of simple eddy - diffusivity / viscosity sgs models .",
    "uncertainties eventually present at the smallest scales directly affected by sgs parameterizations ( that are not the concern of the analysis we are going to show ) do not propagate upward but are promptly diffuse ( and thus dissipated ) owing to the action of the aforementioned eddy - diffusivity / viscosity character of sgs motion .",
    "genuine inertial range dynamics can thus develop and , as we shall see , the typical features characterizing an inertial range of scales ( e.g. , rescaling properties of statistical objects ) to appear .",

    ", readers can refer to moeng and sullivan ( 1994 ) .    to perform our statistical analysis",
    ", we first reached the quasi - steady state .",
    "it took , as in moeng and sullivan ( 1994 ) , about six large - eddy turnover times , @xmath91 .",
    "after that time , a new simulation has been made for about @xmath92 and the simulated potential temperature field saved at @xmath93 intervals for the analysis .",
    "our data set was thus formed by 74 ( almost independent ) potential temperature snapshots .    each simulation hour",
    "required about 24 computer hours on an alpha - xp1000 workstation .",
    "let us start our statistical analysis from the large temperature fluctuations .",
    "these are controlled by the pdf tails of temperature differences , @xmath42 , and , as we are going to show , they are compatible with the laws ( [ resca ] ) and ( [ pawer ] ) , that means intermittency saturation . + to show that , it is enough to see whether or not there exist a positive number , @xmath56 , such that the quantities @xmath94 collapse on the same curve , @xmath52 , for different values of the separation @xmath12 . indeed , as showed in sec .",

    "in the graph ( a ) , @xmath48 is reported without any @xmath12-dependent rescaling ; in ( b ) we show @xmath97 for @xmath98 .",
    "the data collapse occurring on the tails of the curves of graph ( b ) is the footprint of intermittency saturation .",
    "+ in figs .  3 and 4 we show the analogous of fig .  2 but for @xmath99 and @xmath100",
    "also in these cases , the exponent giving the data collapse is @xmath98 .",
    "similar behaviors have been observed for all @xmath35 s within the mixed layer . + as a conclusion , from the evidences of figs .  2 , 3 and 4",
    ", it turns out that the saturation exponent @xmath56 does not depend on @xmath35 within the mixed layer .",
    "it is thus a property of the entire mixed layer and , for this reason , it will be simply denoted by @xmath25 .",
    "let us now corroborate the scenario of intermittency saturation by looking at the cumulated probability ( [ cum ] ) .",
    "+ for the saturation to occur , such probability has to behave as a power law with exponent @xmath25 ( see ( [ pawer ] ) ) .",

    "the continuous lines have the slope @xmath104 as measured from figs .  2 and 3 .",
    "the fact that there exist a region of scales , @xmath12 , where that slope is parallel to the slope of the cumulated probabilities means , again , intermittency saturation with a unique ( i.e.  characterizing the whole mixed layer ) exponent . + it is worth noting that figures similar to figs .",
    "5(a ) and 5(b ) have been obtained also for smaller values of @xmath105 , e.g. , @xmath106 and @xmath107 .",

    "is also shown .",
    "note that the maximum contribution to the moments six and eight comes from fluctuations @xmath0 in the region where @xmath114 ( i.e. , @xmath115 ) is well resolved , i.e. , our statistics appears reliable up to the order eight .",
    "once @xmath25 is known , we evaluated from ( [ resca ] ) the unknown function @xmath52 . such function",
    "is shown in fig .  7 for two different values of @xmath35 within the mixed layer .",
    "differences among the two curves are evident , signaling that @xmath52 contains a dependence on the elevation @xmath35 . such dependence can be associated to the relatively small shear present in our convective simulation ( see sec .",
    "[ simula ] ) . + further simulations spanning intermediate abl ( i.e.  where both shear and buoyancy are important ) have however to be performed in order to confirm the above last conclusion .",
    "it is worth stressing that the scales @xmath12 at which we observe scaling behaviors are always larger than @xmath116 grid - points ( i.e.  sufficiently far from the scales directly affected by sgs parameterizations ) .",
    "our attention being focused in a region sufficiently far from boundaries , this is another point in favor for the possible sgs independence of our results .",
    "let us now conclude this section with a geometric point of view for the intermittency saturation ( see also celani et al , 2001a ) .",
    "as we shall see , the saturation exponent @xmath25 is related to the fractal dimension , @xmath28 , of the set hosting the strong temperature fluctuations .",
    "+ to do that , let us schematize in a very rough way our strong ( i.e.  larger than some @xmath117 ) temperature fluctuations in the form of quasi - discontinuities ( i.e.  step functions ) .",
    "each quasi - discontinuity will define a point ( we are performing the analysis on planes at constant @xmath35 ) of given coordinate in our two - dimensional plane .",
    "the ensemble of all points defines the set , @xmath118 , hosting strong temperature fluctuations .",
    "roughly , @xmath118 is formed by the intersection of our two - dimensional plane with the plume interfaces across which strong temperature jumps occur . +",
    "a useful indicator to characterize geometrically our set , @xmath118 , is the fractal dimension , @xmath28 , ( see , e.g. , frisch ( 1995 ) for a presentation oriented toward turbulence problems ) .",
    "we briefly recall the standard way to define @xmath28 .",
    "+    * take boxes of side , @xmath12 , and cover the whole plane at fixed @xmath35 .",
    "denote with @xmath119 the total number of those boxes ; * define the function @xmath120 as the number of boxes containing at least one point of @xmath118 ; * for @xmath12 sufficiently small , one expects power law behavior for @xmath120 in the form : @xmath121 , which defines the fractal dimension of @xmath118 .",
    "given the fractal dimension , @xmath28 , it is now easy to compute the probability , @xmath122 $ ] , of having strong ( i.e.  larger than some @xmath117 ) temperature jumps within a certain distance @xmath12 . indeed , by definition",
    ", we have : @xmath55 \\equiv\\frac{\\mbox{favorable cases}}{\\mbox{possible cases}}= \\frac{n(r)}{n_{tot}}\\sim \\frac{r^{-d_f}}{r^{-2}}=r^{2-d_f}\\;\\;\\ ; . \\label{frac}\\ ] ] from ( [ pawer ] ) and ( [ sat ] ) the identification @xmath123 immediately follows . notice",
    "that if one does not restrict the attention on the sole planes at constant @xmath35 , but focuses on the whole three dimensional space , the above relation becomes @xmath124 where @xmath125 is the fractal dimension of the new set @xmath118 .",
    "let us now pass to investigate the statistics of well - mixed regions of the temperature field , corresponding to the inner parts of plumes that are likely to be present in our cbl ( see again fig .  1 ) .",
    "+ in these regions , fluctuations turn out to be very gentle and , as an immediate consequence , statistics is expected to be controlled in terms of single - scale fluctuations ( see the introduction ) . the best candidate to characterize , from a statistical point of view , weak fluctuations is thus the rescaling form given by ( [ pdf - resc1 ] ) .",
    "+ to investigate whether or not our data are compatible with such rescaling , it is enough to verify whether there exist a number , @xmath47 , ( _ a priori _ dependent on the elevation @xmath35 within the mixed layer ) such that , looking at @xmath126 vs @xmath127 for different values of @xmath12 , all curves collapse one on the other for each value of @xmath35 . + our data support this behavior for the pdf cores ( as expected , the rescaling ( [ pdf - resc1 ] ) holds solely for weak fluctuations ) , as it can be observed in fig .",
    "2(c ) ( for @xmath95 ) , in fig .  3(c ) ( for @xmath108 ) and fig .  4(c ) ( for @xmath103 ) .",

    "+ the main results of our study can be summarized as follows .",
    "* large temperature fluctuations , occurring across plume interfaces , turn out to be strongly intermittent .",
    "this is the cause of the observed break down of mean field theories  la kolmogorov , predicting a linear behavior of the scaling exponents , @xmath22 , of the structure functions of temperature differences , vs the order @xmath20 .",
    "we found , on the contrary , a pdf rescaling which corresponds to a nonlinear shape of @xmath22 vs @xmath20 , with @xmath130 for @xmath20 large enough .",
    "this behavior is named _",
    "intermittency saturation _ , i.e.  the strongest violation of dimensional predictions .",
    "+ hence , the concept of ` typical fluctuation ' does not make sense : it is necessary to specify which part of the pdf of temperature differences is sampled for the definition of ` typical fluctuation ' .",
    "* weak temperature fluctuations , characterizing the inner plume region where temperature is extremely well - mixed , have a self - similar character .",
    "this amounts to say that , despite the fact that many scales are excited in the well - mixed regions , the concept of ` typical fluctuation ' here makes sense . in this case",
    "a simple rescaling characterizes the pdf core , which corresponds to a linear behavior of the curve @xmath22 vs @xmath20 for small @xmath20 s .",
    "the slope of the straight line @xmath22 vs @xmath20 is @xmath131 . *",
    "exponents @xmath24 and @xmath25 appear to be independent on the elevation within the mixed layer .",
    "they are thus an intrinsic property of the entire mixed layer . *",
    "statistics and geometry turn out to be intimately related .",
    "a simple relationship holds indeed between @xmath25 and the fractal dimension , @xmath28 , of the set hosting the large temperature fluctuations : @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the usual dimension of the physical space . + as for @xmath25 , @xmath28 appears an intrinsic , i.e.  @xmath35-independent , property of the entire mixed layer .",
    "it is worth stressing that the present scenario holds also for idealized , two - dimensional , models of scalar turbulence both passive ( see frisch et al ( 1999 ) , celani et al ( 2000 ) and celani et al ( 2001a ) ) and active ( see celani et al ( 2001b ) ) , simulated by means of direct numerical simulations .",
    "this fact naturally points toward the possible generality of the present statistical characterization for the entire class of scalar transport problems .",
    "finally , let us discuss a possible application of our results within boundary layer physics , and , more specifically , in the les approach .",
    "as well known , one of the most challenging problem in the les strategy is to find a proper way to describe the dynamical effect of small - scale unresolved motion on the resolved large scale dynamics .",
    "recently , new approaches have emerged as alternatives to the eddy viscosity and similarity models ( see , e.g. , meneveau and katz , 2000 ) .",
    "they construct the small - scale unresolved part of a total field ( e.g. , the velocity field ) by extrapolating properties of the ( resolved ) coarse - grained field .",
    "a specific form for the subgrid scale field is thus postulated exploiting scale - invariance ( i.e.  inertial range scaling behavior ) of the coarse - grained field .",
    "note that , standard approaches postulate the form of the stress tensor rather than the structure of the unresolved field .",
    "+ the mathematical tool which permits to perform such an interpolation is known as `` fractal interpolation '' ( see meneveau and katz ( 2000 ) and references therein ) where the free parameter of the theory is the fractal dimension of the field .",
    "+ up to now , many efforts have been devoted to exploit such strategy for the velocity fields .",
    "the latter exhibit however a multifractal structure ( roughly speaking , an infinite set of fractal dimensions characterizes the whole field ) and thus the fractal dimension parameter is a sort of ` mean field ' description . +",
    "the suggestion arising from our results is that the same technique exploited for the velocity field appears successfully applicable in the convective case to the temperature field as well .",
    "indeed , our results support a fractal structure of the temperature field .",
    "the situation seems to be even better than that for the velocity field .",
    "as we have stressed in the preceding sections , solely two exponents characterize most of the statistical properties of temperature fluctuations .",
    "we thus propose to schematize temperature fluctuations as a bi - fractal object ( i.e. , the simplest multifractal object ) described by our two exponents @xmath24 and @xmath25 , and to generalize `` fractal interpolation '' to this case .",
    "+ to do that , it seems necessary to investigate how the exponents we found for the analyzed experiment change by varying , e.g. , the weight of buoyancy with respect to shear .",
    "we are currently working on this point and , as far as we remain on convective experiments , it seems that only small variations appear . + it should also be interesting to investigate what happens to the above scenario in stable stratified boundary layers . in that cases les approach",
