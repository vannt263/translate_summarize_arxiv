    "this has potential applications in ultralow power non - volatile magnetic logic and memory @xcite because switching a multiferroic nanomagnet with stress dissipates far less energy than switching it with a magnetic field or spin transfer torque produced by a current @xcite . as a result",
    ", stress - mediated switching can reduce energy dissipation in magnetic reversal to the point where non - volatile memory and logic systems can be run by harvesting energy solely from the environment without needing a power source or battery !",
    "this opens up unique applications in situations where energy is a premium  such as in implanted medical devices , structural health monitoring systems , `` wearable '' electronics , and space based applications .",
    "a multiferroic nanomagnet is made of a _ magnetostrictive _ layer and a _ piezoelectric _ layer in intimate contact with each other ( see figure  [ fig : multiferroic ] ) .",
    "a voltage applied across the piezoelectric layer generates in it a mechanical strain that is mostly transferred to the magnetostrictive layer by elastic coupling and produces an extension @xcite if the latter layer is much thinner than the former . if we mechanically constrain the magnetostrictive layer from expanding or contracting along a certain in - plane direction , e.g. along the minor axis of the ellipse in figure  [ fig : multiferroic ] , then this will generate uniaxial stress along the major axis through the @xmath0 coupling in the piezoelectric .",

    "the polarity of the applied voltage @xmath1 is determined by the sign of the magnetostrictive coefficient of the material used as the magnetostrictive layer .",
    "the polarity should be such that the stress generated favors aligning the magnetization vector along the in - plane hard axis rather than the easy axis.,width=288 ]    let us assume that the shape of the nanomagnet is that of an elliptical cylinder as shown in figure  [ fig : multiferroic ] and that the initial orientation of the magnetization is close to the major axis of the ellipse ( z - axis ) , which is the magnet s easy axis . in that case",
    ", a 90@xmath2 rotation will place the magnetization vector along the minor axis , which is the in - plane hard axis .",
    "subsequent removal of stress can relax it back to the easy axis , but in a direction anti - parallel to the initial direction , resulting in a @xmath3180@xmath2 rotation or `` flip '' @xcite . ref .",
    "[ ] showed that the energy dissipated in this process is extremely small ( @xmath3200 @xmath4 at room temperature ) for optimum choice of materials , even when the switching takes place in @xmath31 nanosecond and the stress is turned on abruptly and instantaneously .",
    "in fact , a tiny voltage of few mv applied abruptly can generate enough stress to flip the magnetization @xcite in 1 nanosecond , which results in the miniscule dissipation of @xmath3200 @xmath4 .    in this paper",
    ", we are concerned with the following issue .",
    "the applied voltage can not generate strain in the magnetostrictive layer instantaneously .",
    "if we ramp up the voltage gradually with a rise time longer than the response time of strain , then strain may be able to follow the voltage quasi - statically . in that case , by controlling the ramp rate of the voltage , we can control the rise time of the strain .",
    "this may have significant effects on both the switching delay and the energy dissipated in the switching process .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to investigate this possibility .",
    "intuitively , one would expect that if the stress is always ramped up to a constant value regardless of the ramp rate , then the time taken to flip the magnetization ( switching delay ) , will decrease monotonically with increasing ramp rate .",
    "the only caveat is that at high stress levels , a very fast ramp rate may cause ripples and ringing in the temporal evolution of the magnetization vector , which may prolong the switching process . the actual situation turns out to be a little more complicated because the switching dynamics exhibits rich and complex behavior as a result of the interplay between the in - plane and out - of - plane excursions of the magnetization vector under application of stress .",
    "this complex interplay has two effects : ( 1 ) it makes the switching delay exhibit a non - monotonic dependence on the ramp rate when high stresses are encountered , and ( 2 ) it makes the switching delay saturate quickly with increasing stress at a constant ramp rate . in this paper",
    ", we have studied this intriguing dynamics by solving the landau - lifshitz - gilbert ( llg ) equation which governs the temporal evolution of the magnetization vector of a single domain nanomagnet .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : llg_analytical ] , we first derive the torque exerted by any applied stress on the magnetization vector of the magnetostrictive layer , and then solve the llg equation analytically in the spherical coordinate system to yield equations that govern the time evolution of the magnetization vector .",
    "these equations describe how the polar angle @xmath5 and the azimuthal angle @xmath6 of the magnetization vector change with time .",
    "they are solved numerically to obtain the dynamics of magnetization rotation . in section  [ sec : energy_landscape ] , we derive the energy landscapes of the nanomagnet ( energy as a function of magnetization orientation ) in the stressed and relaxed conditions since they are a valuable aid in understanding the time evolution of the magnetization vector . in section  [ sec : results ] , we present the simulation results , while in section  [ sec : discussions ] we discuss the implications of these results and present the conclusions .",
    "consider an isolated nanomagnet in the shape of an elliptical cylinder whose elliptical cross section lies in the y - z plane with its major axis aligned along the z - direction and minor axis along the y - direction .",

    "in other words , a negative @xmath76 will tend to _ increase _ @xmath43 with time .",
    "since our initial value of @xmath43 is 179@xmath2 and the final value is 1@xmath2 , we would prefer that @xmath43 will always decrease  and never increase  with time in order to complete the switching in the shortest time .",
    "therefore , a negative value of @xmath76 , or equivalently @xmath12 lying in the interval [ @xmath79 , is counterproductive since that makes @xmath43 increase with time , causing the magnetization to rotate in the _ wrong _ direction , opposite to the preferred direction .",
    "this hinders switching and increases the switching delay .",
    "therefore , we will always prefer that @xmath76 remains positive , or equivalently @xmath12 remains in the interval [ 0@xmath2 , 90@xmath2 ] or [ 180@xmath2 , 270@xmath2 ] .",
    "on the other hand , it is clear from equation ( [ eq : phi_dynamics ] ) that a positive @xmath76 makes a positive contribution to the rate @xmath81 , which will tend to increase @xmath12 with time and make it exceed 90@xmath2 .",
    "these two counteracting influences of @xmath76 determine the actual switching dynamics and the resulting switching delay .",
    "another point to note is that when the applied stress is sufficiently high , the stress term @xmath38 dominates the term @xmath82 in equations ( [ eq : theta_dynamics ] ) and ( [ eq : phi_dynamics ] ) .",
    "the term involving @xmath82 should remain positivein equation ( [ eq : theta_dynamics ] ) in order to help @xmath78 remain negative so that the magnetization vector can rotate in the right direction . in order to keep @xmath38 negative",

    "e.g. terfenol - d ) , this requires that the stress is negative , while for materials with negative magnetostriction ( e.g. nickel or cobalt ) , the stress should be positive .",

    "this happens because the thickness of the nanomagnet is much smaller than the other two dimensions , which makes the shape anisotropy energy barrier much taller in the former case than in the latter case .",
    "the stress that can be generated in the magnetostrictive layer by the strained piezoelectric layer is usually sufficient to rotate the magnetization axis when @xmath90 , because the shape anisotropy barrier that has to be overcome is small .",

    "on the other hand , out - of - plane excursion of the magnetization vector generates an additional torque that aids switching .",
    "thus , some out - of - plane excursion is beneficial , but if the magnetization vector strays out of plane , it encounters a larger energy barrier that prevents switching .",

    "normally , one would expect the switching delay to decrease continuously with increasing excess stress , but in reality it saturates beyond a certain stress so that increasing stress further offers only marginal advantage .",

    "note that both ramp rates make @xmath43 come very close to 1@xmath2 in about 0.9 ns , but the faster ramp rate causes the magnetization vector to pull back from the final destination and vacillate before reaching the final destination .",

    "figure  [ fig : delay_ramp_nickel ] shows switching delay as a function of the ramp s rise ( and fall ) time for various stresses . at higher stress levels ( 80 - 107 mpa ) , the switching delay actually _ decreases _ with increasing rise ( and fall ) time ( a counter - intuitive result ) because of the ripples that are generated when the stress is ramped up to high values very fast .",
    "thus , the out - of - plane dynamics of the magnetization vector plays a vital role in switching .    for lower stress levels ( 60 -70 mpa ) ,",
    "the switching delay increases slightly with increasing rise ( or fall ) time .",

    "therefore , even a fast ramp does not cause too many ripples and delay the switching when the stress is sufficiently low . in that case",
    ", a slower ramp will lead to slightly slower switching and that is what we observe .",
    "strangely , at slow ramp rates ( e.g. rise ( and fall ) time = 150 ps ) and low stress levels , a slightly lower stress can cause considerably more precession than a slightly higher stress which leads to very strong dependence of switching delay on the magnitude of stress at low stress levels . in order to illustrate this",
    ", we plot the switching dynamics for 150 ps rise ( and fall ) time in figures  [ fig : dynamics_nickel_60mpa_150ps ] and  [ fig : dynamics_nickel_80mpa_150ps ] , for stresses of 60 mpa and 80 mpa .",
    "there are ripples and considerable precessional motion when the stress is 60 mpa and virtually no ripple and very little precessional motion when the stress is 80 mpa .",
    "thus , by increasing the stress slightly from 60 mpa to 80 mpa , the switching time can be reduced by a factor of four  from slightly above 6 ns to slightly above 1.5 ns .",

    "[ fig : delay_energy_nickel_stress ] , note that the ` @xmath102 ' energy dissipated in the switching circuit is 1 - 2 orders of magnitude higher for nickel than for terfenol - d for the same switching delay .",
    "since the voltage @xmath1 is proportional to stress , the ` @xmath102 ' energy is quadratically proportional to stress .",
    "since the magnetostrictive coefficient of terfenol - d is considerably higher than that of nickel , terfenol - d requires much less stress to generate the same stress anisotropy energy and hence requires much less stress to switch .",
    "this results in a significant reduction of ` @xmath102 ' energy dissipation in the case of terfenol - d .",
    "the total energy dissipation is however dominated by the energy @xmath109 dissipated internally in the nanomagnet due to gilbert damping .",
    "this energy is actually smaller in nickel than in terfenol - d , because the gilbert damping constant of nickel is more than twice smaller than that of terfenol - d .",
    "as long as we are switching adiabatically , @xmath109 will be the primary source of dissipation , and in that case , the material with the lower gilbert damping constant will be superior since it will reduce total dissipation .",
    "_ the situation may change completely if we are switching abruptly_. in that case , the ` @xmath102 ' energy may very well be the major component of dissipation .",
    "if that happens , then the material with the larger magnetostrictive coefficient will be better since it will need less stress to switch and hence less voltage and less ` @xmath102 ' dissipation .",
    "in other words , nickel is better than terfenol - d ( from the perspective of energy dissipation ) when switching is adiabatic , but the opposite may very well be true when the switching is abrupt .",
    "if speed is the primary concern , then what matters is the product of the magnetostrictive coefficient and the young s modulus .",
    "since the maximum strain that can be generated in the magnetostrictive layer is fixed and determined by the pzt layer , the maximum stress anisotropy energy that can be generated in the magnet depends on the aforesaid product .",
