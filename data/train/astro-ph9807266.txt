    "indirect evidence for the existence of massive black holes ( mbhs ) in active galactic nuclei ( agns ) has been growing over the years ( e.g. rees 1984 ) .",
    "however , the most conclusive evidence for the existence of massive black holes has been recently obtained in the milky way ( e.g. genzel et al . 1997 ) , and in ngc  4258 ( miyoshi et al . 1995 ) , a weakly - active galaxy .",
    "this new evidence is based on high spatial resolution observations of stellar and gas kinematics .",
    "similar estimates could not be employed in quasars and bright seyfert galaxies as the stellar kinematics close to the black hole is hopelessly lost behind the glare of the active nucleus .",
    "a rough estimate of the black hole mass in agns can be obtained based on the size and the typical velocities in the broad line region ( blr , e.g. dibai 1981 ; wandel & yahil 1985 ; joly et al .",
    "1985 ; padovani & rafanelli 1988 ; koratkar & gaskell 1991 ) . however , this method is susceptible to various systematic errors , and there is currently no independent way to estimate its accuracy .",
    "compact massive dark objects , most likely mbhs , were inferred in the cores of many nearby normal galaxies based on stellar kinematics and the observed light distribution ( see review by kormendy & richstone 1995 ) . in a recent comprehensive study of the stellar dynamics of a large sample of nearby galaxies magorrian et al .",
    "( 1998 ) found that a mbh may exist in the cores of nearly all bulges .",
    "they also confirmed the strong correlation between the black hole mass and the bulge mass , consistent with @xmath1 .",
    "if quasars reside in normal galaxies , then their black hole mass and bulge mass should also follow this correlation .",
    "it is not possible to explore this correlation directly in quasars since stellar velocity distributions in the host bulges have not been measured yet .",
    "however , since there is a strong correlation between @xmath2 and @xmath3 in galaxies ( faber et al .",
    "1997 ) , one can instead test if quasars follow the @xmath4 versus @xmath3 correlation found for normal galaxies .",
    "rather accurate determinations of quasar host galaxy luminosities were recently obtained by bahcall et al .",
    "( 1997 ) for a representative sample of 20 bright low redshift quasars using the _ hubble space telescope ( hst)_. in this _ letter _",
    "i show that the quasar host galaxy luminosity appears to be significantly correlated with the h@xmath5-deduced black hole mass , @xmath6 , and that this correlation is very similar to the @xmath3 versus @xmath4 relation determined by magorrian et al . for nearby normal galaxies .",
    "this similarity provides a `` calibration '' for the @xmath4 estimates in agns .",
    "the @xmath6 estimation method , its application to the bahcall et al .",
    "sample , and the correlation analysis results are given in  2 , and the implications are discussed in  3 , together with some predictions of host luminosities which can be tested with _",
    "hst _ in the near future .",
    "the black hole mass can be estimated using the the velocity dispersion of the h@xmath5 emitting clouds in the blr and the size of this region , together with the assumption that the clouds motion are virialized , i.e. , @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the size of the -emitting region in the blr and @xmath10 is the observed  velocity dispersion .",
    "kaspi et al .",
    "( 1996 ) find @xmath11  pc , where @xmath12 is the @xmath13 luminosity in units of @xmath14  erg  s@xmath15 , assuming @xmath16  km  s@xmath15  mpc@xmath15 .",
    "this relation is equivalent to @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the bolometric luminosity in units of @xmath19  erg  s@xmath15 ( using @xmath20 , e.g. fig.7 in laor & draine 1993 ) , and @xmath21  km  s@xmath15  mpc@xmath15 which is used throughout the paper .",
    "the @xmath22 scaling is also indicated by the weak luminosity dependence of agn emission line spectra , and is also expected based on dust sublimation which occurs at @xmath23 ( laor & draine 1993 ; netzer & laor 1993 ) .",
    "thus , just based on @xmath10 , taken here as the observed h@xmath5 fwhm , and @xmath18 , one obtains the following estimate for the black hole mass from eqs.1 & 2 , @xmath24 where @xmath25 , and + @xmath26  fwhm/3000  km  @xmath15 .",
    "quasar hosts have been studied extensively from the ground ( e.g. mcleod & rieke 1994a , 1994b ; dunlop et al .",
    "however , separating out the quasar host galaxy clearly requires a high angular resolution , and thus measurements with the _ hst _ can provide the most accurate determination of quasar host properties .",
    "i use the sample of 20 luminous low redshift ( @xmath27 ) quasars studied by bahcall et al . with the hst wide field / planetary camera-2 ( wfpc2 ) .",
    "this sample is likely to represent the properties of nearby bright quasars .",
    "in addition , the large sample size , the uniform and detailed reduction , and the detection of all quasar hosts , make this sample the best one available for exploring the @xmath4 versus @xmath7 relation in quasars .",
    "some of the host galaxies morphologies were identified by bahcall et al . as elliptical , and for these galaxies",
    "@xmath28 ( taken from the best fit 2-d model in their table 5 ) .",
    "other hosts were identified as spirals , or interacting , and the value of @xmath3 for these objects , required for a direct comparison with the magorrian et al .",
    "results , is not available .",
    "an estimate of @xmath3 for the objects which are best fit by an exponential disk is obtained by subtracting the @xmath29  kpc annular magnitude ( their table 8) from the total magnitude ( their table 5 ) , yielding @xmath30(inner host ) .",
    "the mean @xmath31(host@xmath32inner host ) is 0.5 mag , which is smaller than @xmath33(total@xmath32bulge)@xmath34  mag for early type spiral galaxies ( simien & de vaucouleurs 1986 ) , suggesting that @xmath30(inner host ) overestimates @xmath3 .",
    "although , @xmath30(host ) may be underestimated , since the fit does not included a bulge component .",
    "table 1 lists the bahcall et al .",
    "quasars used for the correlation analysis together with their @xmath35 , @xmath30(bulge ) for objects with a de vaucouleurs fit , or @xmath30(inner host ) for objects with an exponential disk fit , h@xmath5 fwhm , bolometric luminosity , @xmath4 ( ) as deduced from equation 3 , and the host morphology from bahcall et al .",
    "the h@xmath5 fwhm is obtained from boroson & green ( 1992 ) which provide high quality and uniformly reduced spectra of all 87 @xmath36 pg quasars ( schmidt & green 1983 ) , of which 14 overlap with the bahcall et al . sample . continuum fluxes are available for all of these 14 pg quasars in neugebauer et al .",
    "( 1987 ) , which provides accurate and uniformly reduced continuum spectrophotometry for most pg quasars .",
    "the luminosity at 3000  is converted to @xmath37 using @xmath38(3000 ) ( see fig.7 in laor & draine ) .",
    "there is no uniform data set with the continuum flux and h@xmath5 fwhm for 5 additional quasars from the bahcall et al . sample .",
    "different papers quote parameters that can differ by @xmath39% for a given object .",
    "these objects were therefore not included in the analysis as they may be subject to significant systematic deviations .",
    "the upper panel in figure 1 shows @xmath30(bulge / inner host ) [ hereafter @xmath30(b / ih ) ] versus @xmath4 for the 19 bahcall et al .",
    "only the 14 quasars marked with filled squares were used in the analysis .",
    "the spearman rank order correlation coefficient is @xmath40 which has a probability of 0.005 to occur for unrelated parameters .",
    "a simple least squares fit to the data gives @xmath41 three quasars which are best fit by an exponential disk , pks  1302 - 102 , pg  1307 + 085 , and pg  1444 + 407 ( bahcall et al . table 5 ) , may have an elliptical morphology ( table 1 ) .",
    "a least squares fit for the 14 quasars using the three quasars de vaucouleurs fit @xmath42 yields the coefficients @xmath43 and @xmath44 .    the middle panel in fig.1 shows the @xmath30(bulge ) vs. @xmath4 relation for nearby normal galaxies from magorrian et al .",
    "the dashed line represents the relation @xmath45 as deduced from the @xmath46 and @xmath47 relations found by magorrian et al . , and the standard relation @xmath48 .    the quasar correlation is flatter than the magorrian et al .",
    "correlation ( @xmath49 vs. @xmath50 ) .",
    "this may be partly due to the fact that all the quasar hosts at @xmath51 are disk galaxies , where @xmath30(inner host ) may overestimate @xmath30(bulge ) (  2.2 ) .",
    "the lower panel in figure 1 compares directly the distributions of the 32 magorrian et al . galaxies and of the 19 quasars in the @xmath4 versus @xmath30(b / ih ) plane .",
    "the two distributions overlap surprisingly well .",
    "the overlap of the distributions of quasars and of normal galaxies in the @xmath4 versus @xmath30(b / ih ) plane is the main result of this paper .",
    "this overlap is remarkable as bright quasars and nearby galaxies are apparently different types of objects , and since the @xmath4 estimates in quasars and in nearby galaxies are based on very different methods ( the blr versus stellar dynamics ) .",
    "the overlap is also surprising given the crudeness of the @xmath4 estimates for both populations . as stressed by magorrian et al .",
    ", their data are fit with a simplified , axisymmetric , stellar dynamics model , and a more general model may yield @xmath4 which could be off by an order of magnitude , or may even not require a `` massive dark object '' at all . the @xmath6 estimate is even cruder .",
    "large systematic errors could be induced if the blr velocity field or the optical - uv continuum are anisotropic , if the scaling of @xmath9 with @xmath52 does not hold in bright quasars , or if the h@xmath5 dynamics is affected by non gravitational forces ( e.g. radiation pressure , magnetic fields ) .",
    "the overlap suggests a number of interesting implications .",
    "first , concerning the blr : 1 .",
    "the h@xmath5 dynamics are most likely dominated by gravity ; 2 . the h@xmath5 velocity field and the observed optical - uv emission are not likely to be strongly anisotropic , and 3 .",
    "the @xmath9 versus @xmath52 relation most likely holds in quasars .",
    "second , concerning the @xmath6 estimate ; the overlap allows a `` calibration '' of this mass estimate and suggests it is probably accurate to within @xmath0 on log scale .",
    "third , concerning quasar hosts ; 1 .",
    "the scatter in the @xmath6 versus @xmath30(b / ih ) correlation suggests that @xmath30(b / ih ) can be estimated to within @xmath0  mag based on the quasar luminosity and  line width .",
    "the overlap of the two distributions suggests that quasar hosts are similar to normal , nearby galaxies , and thus that @xmath30(b / ih ) is generally not strongly affected by processes such as a nuclear starburst , or distortions due to a tidal interaction .",
    "this correlation may also be useful for surveys of the large scale structure of the universe ( 2df , sdss ) .",
    "quasars can be used as bright markers of galaxies out to high @xmath35 whose bulge luminosity and mass can be deduced from the quasar emission spectra , allowing studies of clustering as a function of mass .",
    "the correlation found here , @xmath53 ( or @xmath54 ) translates using eq.7 to @xmath55 ( or @xmath56 ) , which is steeper than the magorrian et al .",
    "relation @xmath57 .",
    "the slope of the quasar relation has a relatively large uncertainty due to the small range in @xmath4 available ( @xmath58 ) , but it is interesting to note that at the high mass end ( @xmath59 ) the magorrian et al .",
    "galaxies appear to follow the quasar relation quite well ( see fig.1 ) . at the low black hole mass end one",
    "has the two best @xmath4 estimates available , in the galaxy and in ngc  4258 , where @xmath60 ( miyoshi et al .",
    "1995 ; genzel et al . 1997 ) and @xmath61 ( bahcall & soneira 1980 ; rc2 catalogue + simien & de vaucouleurs 1986 ) .",
    "these galaxies follow the quasar relation significantly better than the magorrian relation ( see fig.1 ) .",
    "thus , the data in the range @xmath62 appears to agree better with the steeper quasar relation .",
    "the quasar relation is also interestingly close to the haehnelt , natarajan & rees ( 1998 ) prediction of @xmath63 .",
    "there are some objects , such as m  32 , which appear to agree better with the nearby galaxies relation ( fig.1 ) . a number of seyfert  1 galaxies with @xmath64 , as deduced by reverberation mappings ( peterson et al .",
    "1998 ) , are 1 - 2 mag brighter than expected based on the quasar relation ( ho 1998 ) .",
    "subtraction of the agn light from the host light would bring them closer to the quasar relation .",
    "the distribution of quasars in the absolute quasar @xmath65 band magnitude @xmath66 versus the absolute host @xmath67 band magnitude @xmath68 plane appears to be bounded such that @xmath69 ( e.g. mcleod & rieke 1995 , their figure 6 ) .",
    "mcleod ( 1998 ) suggested that the reason for this bound is that objects where @xmath70 `` have a maximum allowed black hole mass for their galaxy mass and that the black hole is accreting at the eddington rate . ''",
    "this idea is broadly consistent with the correlation found here .",
    "for example , a quasar with @xmath71  mag typically has @xmath72  mag ( using @xmath73  mag for our 14 pg quasar hosts , with @xmath68 from mcleod & rieke 1994b ) .",
    "equation 4 then gives @xmath74 ( or @xmath75 ) .",
    "a magnitude of @xmath76  mag translates to @xmath77)=45.55 , and @xmath78 , which corresponds to 0.44 or 0.75 of @xmath79 .",
    "the above estimates are rather rough since the @xmath68 versus @xmath80 correlation has a significant scatter .    how can the analysis presented here",
    "be improved ?",
    "the crude `` inner host '' estimate for the bulge luminosity , used here for disk galaxies , can be improved by fitting a disk+bulge model to the _ hst _ images .",
    "this may be feasible for early type spiral hosts where the typical effective radius of the bulge is @xmath81  kpc ( simien & de vaucouleurs ) , or @xmath82 for the bahcall et al .",
    ". however , it will not be feasible for late type spiral hosts , where @xmath84  kpc , and a sample of lower @xmath35 agns will be required .",
    "one also needs to measure the h@xmath5 fwhm and luminosity simultaneously to guard against variability , and to obtain a more accurate estimate of the ionizing luminosity to use in the @xmath9 relation ( eq.2 ) .",
    "obscuration effects are well established in agns , and these may increase the scatter , if not accounted for . in particular , objects with a very narrow h@xmath5 line may have their blr partly obscured , or may be strongly dominated by emission from the narrow line region . using",
    "the variable h@xmath5 component profile can overcome such biases .",
    "future observations with _",
    "hst _ can address the following questions : 1 .",
    "does the black hole mass vs. host bulge luminosity correlation extends to quasars with higher and lower black hole masses ?",
    "2 . can the scatter in the correlation be reduced with a more careful analysis , or is it intrinsically large , as suggested for galaxies ? and 3 .",
    "does @xmath85 , as suggested here , or is @xmath57 as suggested by magorrian et al . ?",
    "the pg quasars sample may be particularly useful for such future explorations with _",
    "hst _ since a high s",
    "/ n homogeneous spectroscopic data base is already available from neugebauer et al . and boroson & green .",
    "using this data set and eqs.3 & 4 one can predict that of the 87 @xmath86 pg quasars , some of the lowest luminousity hosts should be found in pg  1244 + 026 , pg  1404 + 226 , and pg  1448 + 273 ( predicted @xmath80=@xmath87 to @xmath88 ) , while some of the highest luminousity hosts should be found in pg  1704 + 608 , pg  1425 + 267 , and pg  2308 + 098 ( @xmath89 to @xmath90 ) .",
    "one can also predict that the hosts of pg  2304 + 042 and pg  2209 + 184 should be 2 - 3 magnitudes brighter than the hosts of pg  1244 + 026 and pg  1448 + 273 respectively , although the former and later quasars have , respectively , similar luminosities .",
