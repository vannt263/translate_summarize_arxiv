    "massless field theories in reduced dimensions are often burdened with infrared singularities that make computation and interpretation difficult .",
    "the problem is particularly acute in gauge theories , where mass , and hence an infrared cutoff , can not be generated in perturbation theory .",
    "it is not unusual for these divergences to appear at a given order in perturbation theory , but to disappear once appropriate diagrams are summed . for example the famed resolution of the infrared divergence in the degenerate electron gas relies on summing infinitely many ring diagrams@xcite .",
    "another example is provided by massless qed in three dimensions ( qed3 ) .",
    "the perturbative vacuum polarisation form factor satisfies @xmath0 thus the @xmath1 fermion bubble insertion correction to the fermion self - energy behaves as    d^3 q e^2 |q| ~_ir where @xmath2 is an infrared cutoff .",
    "this divergence is cancelled by a nonanalytic @xmath3 , rendering the theory well - behaved@xcite .    finally , we recall that finite temperature qcd in four dimensions suffers from the linde problem , wherein infrared divergences appear at order @xmath4 in gluonic loop diagrams@xcite . the resolution of this problem",
    "is not known .",
    "a variety of novel features and applications have spurred interest in qed3 .",
    "for example a chern - simons - like photon mass is possible in three dimensions@xcite _ cs = _",
    "f^a^. this term breaks p and t invariance .",
    "it also generates fermion mass at one - loop in perturbation theory .",
    "if one considers the case of @xmath5 massless two - component fermions then it has been argued that chiral symmetry is indeed broken but that the vacuum remains invariant under parity@xcite .",
    "this has recently been supported by a numerical solution of the truncated schwinger - dyson equations@xcite .",
    "interestingly , it appears that fermion screening at @xmath6 is sufficient to restore a chirally symmetric vacuum@xcite .",
    "thus this theory illustrates how large mass hierarchies can be dynamically generated , which is of interest to bsm physics@xcite .",
    "qed3 is popular as a model field theory for three dimensional condensed matter systems .",
    "examples include applications to high @xmath7 superconductors , where the relevant dynamics is thought to be isolated to copper - oxygen planes in the cuprate@xcite .",
    "it is also considered as a gauge formulation of the 2 + 1 dimensional heisenberg spin model@xcite and as a possible model for graphene@xcite and quantum versions of spin - ice@xcite . naturally , the behaviour of the theory at finite temperature and density is of great interest in these applications .",
    "infrared divergences are exacerbated at nonzero temperature because perturbative diagrams are dominated in the infrared limit by the lowest available matsubara frequency , which is zero in bosonic sums .",
    "thus , even though qed3 is infrared finite at zero temperature , problems may arise again at nonzero temperature .",
    "this issue has engendered some confusion in the literature .",
    "some authors have noted that an infrared divergence exists , but have ignored it@xcite , or imposed an infrared cutoff@xcite , or assumed that higher order corrections remove the divergence@xcite .",
    "many authors simply evade the issue entirely by employing the approximation@xcite    id_(,q ) id_00(0,q ) .",
    "we shall argue that infrared divergences are endemic to qed3 at finite temperature .",
    "furthermore , the problem is not alleviated by finite fermion masses .",
    "nevertheless , observables are finite and the theory is well - defined .",

    "the coupling @xmath8 has units of mass and the theory is superrenormalisable . in three dimensions it is possible to form two- and four - dimensional representations of the dirac algebra .",
    "the two - component theory does not have a chiral symmetry and the massive and massless theories have the same symmetry@xcite . as mentioned in the introduction",
    ", this theory does admit the possibility of spontaneous photon and fermion mass generation  and hence parity symmetry breaking .",
    "the four - component theory with @xmath5 fermions is @xmath9 symmetric , and can break to @xmath10 if fermion mass is dynamically generated .",
    "we will show that infrared divergences occur in both versions .",

    "we note that this argument generalises directly to three dimensions .",
    "this result is important because it implies that there is no dynamical screening in the magnetic sector .",

    "when @xmath38 degenerate fermions are present it is possible to maintain parity invariance of the vacuum ( which is expected@xcite ) if @xmath5 fermions develop positive dynamical mass and @xmath5 fermions develop negative dynamical mass .",
    "thus it is expected that @xmath39 and @xmath40 on quite general grounds .    a theorem due to coleman and hill stipulates that @xmath41 receives no further corrections at zero temperature@xcite .",

    "two external photon lines contribute @xmath43 to any diagram beyond one - loop and so can not contribute to a function that is proportional to @xmath44 .",
    "nonzero contributions can only arise from graphs in which the two external photon lines end on a loop that has no other photon lines attached to it .",
    "thus all corrections to the photon mass beyond one loop order vanish .",
    "evidently the argument generalises directly to nonzero temperature so that eq [ pi2-temp - eq ] is true to all orders .    finally , for two - component fermions @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 need not be zero .",
    "however , all three are zero at one - loop order .",
    "furthermore the conditions of the ( generalised ) coleman - hill theorem apply to @xmath20 and @xmath21 implying    _ 4(0,q0 ) = 0 , _",

    "it is clear that a finite fermion mass does not change this conclusion .",
    "however , a finite photon mass regulates the transverse part of the propagator , leaving only the divergence in the gauge term .",
    "at first sight the appearance of endemic infrared divergences is problematic ; however , we now demonstrate that these divergences do not appear in observables .",
    "consider first the case where the photon has a mass ; the infrared divergence is then associated with the gauge parameter . thus gauge invariance of observables",
    "implies that observables are also independent of the infrared cutoff .",
    "furthermore , @xmath57 is zero at the physical pole location , thus eq . [ ir - eq ] implies that the pole location is independent of the gauge parameter and the infrared cutoff .",
    "in fact because the order of the infrared divergence due to the gauge and magnetic portions of the photon propagator is the same and because the prefactors are constants , one can simply absorb the magnetic divergence into the gauge parameter , thereby showing that all observables are infrared safe .",
    "an all - orders argument for the existence of infrared divergences in the fermion propagator of qed3 at finite temperature has been presented .",
    "the argument relies on gauge invariance and analyticity of @xmath42-point functions at nonzero temperatures .",
    "these properties imply that @xmath29 , @xmath28 , @xmath20 , and @xmath21 all scale as @xmath58 for small momenta .",
    "the ward identity can be used to isolate infrared divergences to the full photon propagator , revealing that the lack of magnetic screening in three dimensions leads to a logarithmic infrared divergence unless parity is explicitly broken with a photon mass .    nevertheless , because the divergences are associated with the exact photon propagator and are of the same form as that arising due to the gauge term",
    ", they must cancel in observables .",
