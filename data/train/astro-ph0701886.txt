    "the recently released data of the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap ) confirmed the earlier cobe - dmr s observation about the deficiency in fluctuation power at the largest angular scales  @xcite .",
    "the amount of the quadrupole mode of the cmb temperature fluctuations is anomalously low if compared to the prediction of the @xmath0cdm model .",
    "the usual explanation to this low quadruple moment is to invoke the so - call  cosmic variance \" , i.e. at large scales the cmb experiments are limited by the fact that we only have one sky to measure and so can not pin down the cosmic average to infinite precision no matter how good the experiment is .",
    "given the large uncertainties due to the cosmic variance , we might never know whether the phenomenon of the low cmb quadrupole constitutes a truly significant deviation from the standard cosmological expectations .",
    "though the cosmic variance implies that we simply live in a universe with a low quadrupole moment for no special reason , the lack of power on the largest scale can be treated as a physical effect that demands a judicious explanation .",
    "there exists various viable mechanisms for generating this large - scale anomaly .",
    "so far , all the efforts can be classified into three essential categories : ( 1 ) a possible non - trivial topology(for example , see j .-",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite and the references therein ) ; ( 2 ) a cut - off due to causality ( for example , see a. berera",
    "_ et al . _",
    "@xcite and the references therein ) ; ( 3 ) initial hybrid fluctuations ( for example , see lee & fang  @xcite ) . recently the colored noise has been considered to explain the anomaly in the context of stochastic inflation  @xcite . instead of a heaviside window function used in the stochastic approach to inflation  @xcite , ref.[6 ] adopts a gaussian window function with a width characterizing the size of the coarse - grained domain  @xcite which is then arbitrarily chosen to be comparable to the hubble radius .",
    "this smooth window function eventually yields a blue tilt of the power spectrum on large scales which can be tuned to fit the wmap large - scale anisotropy data .",
    "nevertheless , in this classical approach they inevitably resort to an _ ad hoc _ smoothing window function and therefore the width of the window function remains undetermined .    from the field",
    "theoretical point of view , on the other hand , interactions between the inflaton and other quantum fields in the very early universe may be inevitable .",
    "such interactions essentially convert the potential energy stored in the inflaton field into radiation during  @xcite or after inflation  @xcite .",
    "consequently , the evolution of inflationary density perturbations will be altered depending upon the details of the mechanisms  @xcite .",
    "therefore , the interactions between the inflaton and other fields have not only provided us an opportunity to grasp the underlying physics of the inflation , but also explored the possibility of generating primordial density fluctuations with statistical properties deviated from the scale - invariance and the gaussianity .",
    "to mimic the quantum environment , we consider a slow - rolling inflaton @xmath1 coupled to a quantum massive scalar field @xmath2 , with a lagrangian given by  @xcite @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the inflaton potential that complies with the slow - roll conditions and @xmath5 is a coupling constant .",
    "thus , we can approximate the space - time during inflation by a de sitter metric given by @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the conformal time and @xmath8 with @xmath9 being the hubble parameter . here",
    "we rescale @xmath10 at the initial time of the inflation era , @xmath11 . following the influence functional approach  @xcite",
    ", we trace out @xmath2 up to the one - loop level and thus obtain the semiclassical langevin equation for @xmath1 , given by @xmath12 where the dot and prime denote respectively differentiation with respect to @xmath7 and @xmath1 .",
    "the effects from the quantum field on the inflaton are given by the dissipation via the kernel @xmath13 as well as a stochastic force induced by the multiplicative colored noise @xmath14 with @xmath15 the kernels @xmath16 in eqs .",
    "( [ lange ] ) and ( [ noise ] ) can be constructed from the green s function of the @xmath2 field with respect to a particular choice of the initial vacuum state which we will specify later , given by @xmath17    to solve eq .",
    "( [ lange ] ) , let us first drop the dissipative term which we will discuss later . then , after decomposing @xmath1 into a mean field and a classical perturbation : @xmath18 , we obtain the linearized langevin equation , @xmath19 where the effective mass is @xmath20 and the time evolution of @xmath21 is governed by @xmath22 . the equation of motion for @xmath2 from which we construct its green s function can be read off from its quadratic terms in the lagrangian  ( [ model ] ) as @xmath23 where @xmath24 .",
    "the solution to eq .",
    "( [ varphieq ] ) is obtained  @xcite as @xmath25 , \\label{varphisol}\\ ] ] where the homogeneous solutions @xmath26 are given by @xmath27 here @xmath28 and @xmath29 are hankel functions of the first and second kinds respectively and @xmath30 .",
    "in addition , we have from eq .",
    "( [ sigmaeq ] ) that @xmath31,\\ ] ] where the constants @xmath32 and @xmath33 are subject to the normalization condition , @xmath34 , and @xmath35 .",
    "now , the power spectrum of the perturbation @xmath36 can be obtained by employing eqs .",
    "( [ noise ] ) and ( [ varphisol ] ) as @xmath37 where the noise - driven power spectrum is given by @xmath38 f(z_1 ) f(z_2 ) , \\label{pseq } % \\end{eqnarray}\\ ] ] where @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath0 is the momentum cutoff introduced in the evaluation of the ultraviolet divergent green s function in eq .",
    "( [ grfct ] ) , and @xmath42 is given by  @xcite @xmath43    we plot @xmath44 at the horizon - crossing time given by @xmath45 versus @xmath46 in fig .",
    "the figure shows that the noise - driven fluctuations depend on the onset time of inflation and approach asymptotically to a scale - invariant power spectrum @xmath47 at large @xmath48 .",
    "note that if @xmath49 , @xmath50 will be comparable to that of the known scale - invariant quantum fluctuation of the inflation which is given by @xmath51  @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the scale - invariant density power spectrum induced by @xmath52 , the noise - driven density power spectrum @xmath53 induced by @xmath50 is blue - tilted on large scales . assuming a dominant @xmath53 and using the set of cosmological parameters measured by wmap  @xcite , we have run the cmbfast numerical codes  @xcite to compute the cmb anisotropy power spectrum as shown in fig .",
    "we can see that the known result of the scale - invariant power spectrum at small scales can be achieved by properly choosing the initial time of inflation .",
    "meanwhile , the suppressed large - scale density perturbation can account for the low cmb low-@xmath54 multipoles .",
    "the above results do not include the intrinsic fluctuation of inflaton .",
    "to take that into account , an additional white noise term @xmath55 in the free field case must be involved on the right hand side of the langevin equation eq .",
    "( [ lange ] ) as @xmath56 accordingly , the effective mass of the @xmath2-field in eq .",
    "( [ sigmaeq ] ) is modified as @xmath57 , where @xmath58 represents the active quantum fluctuation with a scale - invariant power spectrum given by @xmath51  @xcite .",
    "the total density power spectrum then is given by @xmath59 where @xmath60 is determined by the slow - roll kinematics .",
    "under the circumstances , the power spectrum of the noise - driven inflaton fluctuations is not affected . however , the cmb anisotropy in the @xmath0cdm model are modified accordingly , as shown in fig .",
    "[ cl2 ] where the kinematic condition @xmath61 has been set to constant .    the passive fluctuation induced by the quantum noise not only suppresses the cmb power on large scales",
    ", it also impresses on the trajectory of spectral index .",
    "if we rewrite the total density power spectrum as @xmath62 the energy scale of inflation inferred from measurements of the density power spectrum will be lower than the standard slow - roll prediction by a factor @xmath63 . the spectal index is then given by @xmath64 apparently , the additional term containing @xmath50 in eq .",
    "( [ index ] ) offers a new dynamical source for breaking the scale invariance .",
    "it is worthwhile to study the overall effect of the corrections induced by the dissipation , the static mass approximation , and the static mean field approximation to the spectral index .",
    "especially , we expect a running spectral index at large @xmath48 due to dissipational effects on the fluctuations at late times . furthermore , we have made a gaussian approximation to derive the two - point function of the colored noise in eq .",
    "( [ noise ] ) . actually , the noise - induced density fluctuations are intrinsically non - gaussian .",
    "so , it is interesting to go beyond the gaussian approximation and consider the three - point function @xmath65 , which would directly lead to non - zero @xmath66 without invoking higher - order terms .",
    "we have proposed a new scenario in which the inflaton is viewed as a phenomenological classical field . in this model ,",
    "the mean field drives the kinematics of inflation , while its fluctuations are dynamically generated by the colored quantum noise as a result of the coupling of the inflaton to a quantum environment .",
    "this model is a better fit to the wmap anisotropy data than the @xmath0cdm model .",
    "moreover , the observed low cmb quadrupole may unveil the initial condition for inflation .",
    "these results are derived by solving approximately the langevin equation  ( [ lange ] ) of the inflaton which is coupled to a massive quantum field .",
    "the noise term then generates a stochastic force which drives the inflaton fluctuations .",
    "it is worth studying the overall effect of the corrections induced by the dissipation , the static mass approximation , and the static mean field approximation to the spectral index of the density power spectrum .",
    "furthermore , the density power spectrum driven by the colored noise may be non - gaussian .",
    "although we are based on a simple inflaton - scalar model , our results should be generic in any interacting model .",
    "we have considered a quantum scalar field with mass of the order of the hubble parameter during inflation .",
    "in fact , one can consider a scalar field with much higher mass .",
    "so it is mandatory to perform a full analysis of the cosmological effects due to the quantum environment in a viable interacting inflation model such as the hybrid or @xmath67 model .",
