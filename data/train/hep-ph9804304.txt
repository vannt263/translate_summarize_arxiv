    "that the constituent quark model can work remains something of a mystery .",
    "a simple realization of the model treats baryon states as spin - flavor su(@xmath0 ) wave functions and treats interactions that lead to the decay or production of the states as single - quark operators .",
    "a group theoretical strategy can be adopted in connection with this model , so that instead of calculating specific dynamics , one just finds the structure of the hopefully few allowed one - body operators that can contribute , and then fits the coefficients of these operators to a subset or all of the data and attempts to make predictions .",
    "one might think that there would be large corrections to this type of model , for example via multiquark strong interactions that could not simply be absorbed into the binding potential .",
    "recently , it has been noted that large-@xmath1 quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) can be used to show that corrections to the simplest operators are in a number of cases suppressed by powers of @xmath6 .",
    "these cases include analyses of operators that contribute to the axial current matrix elements and the masses of the su(@xmath0 ) ground state baryons , and to operators that would modify the su(@xmath0 ) wave functions even for low spin states @xcite",
    ".    however , a different large-@xmath1 result has been noted in the decays of the negative parity p - wave baryons , the * 70 * -plet of su(@xmath0 ) , into ground state baryons plus pions . here",
    "one may write down all the independent one - quark and multiquark operators that are allowed @xcite .",
    "one finds that , while some of the two - body operators are suppressed by a power of @xmath6 for low spin states , a well - defined subset of the two - body operators are unsuppressed relative to the one - body operators in the large @xmath1 limit .",
    "the reason for the lack of suppression is clear .",
    "the two - body operators themselves contain a suppresion by a factor of @xmath6 , but coherent effects in the matrix elements can give a compensatory factor of @xmath1 .",
    "there is still something of a mystery , however .",
    "an explicit numerical analysis of the decays of the * 70 * -plet into a pion plus a member of the * 56 * -plet , the ground state , showed that the coefficients of the two - body operators are small .    in this paper , we shall investigate the radiative decays of the * 70 * -plet , or equivalently their radiative production .",
    "in particular we will be interested in the guidance that we can get from large-@xmath1 qcd regarding which operators give the leading contributions to the decay matrix elements .",
    "the study of the radiative * 70 * -plet decays using su(@xmath0 ) wave functions and just one - body operators is long since textbook material @xcite .",
    "there are 3 one - body operators , and hence 3 coefficients that may be used to describe the 19 independent decay amplitudes of the * 70 * -plet into nucleons . the simple description , as we shall review below , works reasonably well for most decays .    one might expect sizable corrections from two - body operators to the simple picture . again , two - body operators are operators where a second quark is interacting with the quark that absorbs the photon , and doing so in ways that can not be just incorporated into the binding interaction .",
    "the two - body operators involve strong interaction corrections to a simple photon interaction , and are not in a regime where one would expect the corrections to be perturbative",
    ". they could be big .    in terms of the large-@xmath1 limit ,",
    "since only one quark is excited in the * 70 * -plet , it is elementary to show that matrix elements of the one - body operators are of order 1 in the @xmath1 expansion . now consider the matrix elements of the two - body operators .",
    "the two - quark operators themselves are of order @xmath6 , including factors of the qcd coupling in with the operator . however , because of the many possible choices for the second quark when a matrix element is taken , there is a possible @xmath7 coherence factor .",
    "this leads to the result that certain two - quark operators are also overall @xmath8 in the large @xmath1 expansion .",
    "so in any analysis of the * 70 * -plet decays it would seem an oversight to exclude the two - body operators .",
    "we should test the significance of the two - quark operators by including them in fits to data , and see if their presence can be shown .",
    "( we shall find that the reverse is true . )    before describing our work in more detail , let us make two comments .",
    "one is that some of the two - body operator matrix elements are indeed suppressed by @xmath6",
    ". this can happen if they are proportional to quark spin , in which case they add up to the total quark spin of the state , which for low spin states does not compensate for the @xmath9 size of the operator before the matrix element is taken .",
    "the other is that spin - spin interaction effects can , for high spin states , build up and significantly modify the su(@xmath10 ) form of the wave function .",
    "the effect is small for low spin states . hence if the @xmath11 can be treated as a low spin state , which a spin-3/2 state surely is in the context of large @xmath1 , the su(@xmath10 ) wave functions should be good for it . extrapolating to @xmath12",
    ", we shall treat the @xmath11 as a good su(@xmath0 ) state , but shall also keep in mind that this may be less well justified for the @xmath11 than for the nucleon .    in section  [ sectiontwo ]",
    "we explain the applications of the high @xmath1 limit to radiative decays of the excited baryons and give other information about our calculation , section  [ sectionthree ] gives our numerical results , and section  [ sectionfour ] gives our conclusions .",
    "_ formalism . _",
    "our basic approach is the same as that of refs .",
    "we assume that we can represent the large-@xmath1 baryon states in the tensor product space of the spin and flavor indices of the @xmath1 valence quarks .",
    "our states therefore have the same spin , flavor , and orbital angular momentum structure as representations of nonrelativistic su(@xmath0)@xmath13o(@xmath14 ) .",
    "if we were to consider the limit where the quarks are heavy compared to @xmath15 , this assumption clearly would be correct , since the nonrelativistic quark model description of the baryon states can be then derived from qcd .",
    "the spin - flavor states with the same spatial wave functions are degenerate in the limit of large quark masses , and form complete su(@xmath0)@xmath13o(@xmath14 ) multiplets .",
    "although it appears that this description would break down completely for baryons containing quarks that are much lighter than @xmath15 , one must keep in mind that the splittings between states of low spin within a given multiplet are not only suppressed by @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the quark mass , but also by @xmath6 .",
    "thus , in the large-@xmath1 limit , we expect that the states with lowest spin within each spin - flavor multiplet should be well described in the same tensor product space that is appropriate for large @xmath17 .",
    "we only need assume that there is no discontinuity in the description of the baryon states as we gradually lower the quark mass .",
    "the approximate symmetry described above is an unusual one , in that overall it is badly broken within every multiplet .",
    "however , since the dimension of each multiplet grows with @xmath1 , while the symmetry breaking effects scale as @xmath6 , it is at least possible to make reliable predictions at the low - spin end of each multiplet .",
    "as we describe below , we will ultimately work with @xmath18 baryon wave functions , where the distinction between the  top \" and  bottom \" of a multiplet is not completely clear . to avoid any ambiguity",
    ", we choose to work with complete spin - flavor representations , keeping in mind that our results may be less reliable for the states of highest spin .    assuming this basis , we can write the hartree - fock interaction hamiltonian as @xmath19 @xmath20 where @xmath21 is any quark operator of interest .",
    "the @xmath22 and @xmath23 factors are the individual quark wave functions in the * 56 * and * 70 * -plet baryons , respectively .",
    "the asterisk on the @xmath24 @xmath23 wave function indicates that it is the one corresponding to the orbitally - excited quark .",
    "notice that eq .",
    "( [ eq : ham ] ) sums over all possible multiquark interactions involving @xmath25 quarks , and then over all possible values of @xmath25 . by witten s power counting arguments",
    ", we expect a general @xmath25-body interaction to scale as @xmath26 @xcite .",
    "since a transition between the * 70 * and * 56 * -plet baryons always involves the deexcitation of the orbitally - excited quark , the lowest - order operators will be one - body , acting only on the excited quark line .",
    "higher - body operators will involve the orbitally - excited quark as well as one or more of the other valence quarks , and be suppressed by powers of @xmath6 .    the most useful way of thinking about the interaction hamiltonian in eq .",
    "( [ eq : ham ] ) is in terms of its spin and flavor transformation properties . assuming @xmath27 quark flavors , each large-@xmath1 baryon state can be viewed as a @xmath28 dimensional vector , while @xmath29 can be though of a @xmath30 matrix acting in this space . while we can not explicitly evaluate this matrix ( by computing the hartree wave functions and performing the integration in eq .",
    "( [ eq : ham ] ) ) we can determine the form of @xmath31 , up to unknown coefficients , from symmetry considerations .",
    "the argument goes as follows :    since the wave functions @xmath22 and @xmath23 are computed from the portion of the hartree potential that is zeroth order in spin and flavor symmetry breaking , these wave functions are spin - flavor independent and spherically symmetric .",
    "thus , they are proportional to identity matrices in the spin - flavor space , and can be replaced by ordinary functions @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the radial coordinate .",
    "the last equality follows from the observation that the hartree potential generated by order @xmath1 quarks should remain unaffected by the excitation of a single quark .",
    "the wave function of the excited quark , on the other hand , has the form @xmath34 where @xmath35 is a spherically - symmetric function , and @xmath36 is a spherical harmonic ; the @xmath4 polarization vectors @xmath37 are given by @xmath38 the interaction hamiltonian is therefore an integral of the operator @xmath21 times @xmath39 spherically symmetric , spin - flavor independent functions , times @xmath40 .",
    "thus , we can evaluate an @xmath25-body contribution to @xmath31 by first determining the spin - flavor transformation properties of the qcd operator @xmath21 under the su(@xmath10)@xmath41su(@xmath10)@xmath42 spin - flavor symmetry of the zeroth - order part of hartree hamiltonian .",
    "notice that this corresponds to a different su(@xmath10 ) symmetry for every quark line .",
    "we then write down the most general set of operators transforming in the same way , out of the spin and flavor generators , @xmath43 and @xmath44 , the polarization vector @xmath37 , and the momentum @xmath45 of the light decay product .",
    "we discuss the construction of these operators in greater detail below .",
    "we may evaluate any matrix elements of interest by letting the operators act on the tensor representations of the baryon states ; the undetermined coefficients can then be fit to the corresponding experimental data .",
    "what makes this approach nontrivial is that certain types of operators that are subleading in @xmath6 may nonetheless have matrix elements that are as important as those of the leading operators .",
    "for example , the matrix element of a two - body operator that contributes to a * 70 * -plet baryon decay necessarily involves a spin - flavor matrix acting on the excited quark line , as well as a spin - flavor matrix acting on a nonexcited quark line , summed over the @xmath46 ground state quarks .",
    "if this sum is coherent , it will scale as @xmath1 , and the matrix element of this two - body operator will be of the same order as those of the leading one - body operators .",
    "thus , by determining what types of sums are potentially coherent on the low - spin baryon states , we can restrict the set of operators that appear in the low - energy effective theory . since the one - body operators are often identified with the naive quark model predictions ,",
    "our large @xmath1 arguments imply that there are additional operators , with distinct spin - flavor transformation properties , that may be of equal importance in describing the experimental data .",
    "a fit to the data will then determine whether this is actually the case .",
    "the different spin - flavor matrices and their properties were summarized in ref .",
    "@xcite , and we provide them again for convenience :    @xmath47 constant terms  these always add coherently when summed over quark lines , but have no nontrivial spin - flavor structure .",
    "thus , these terms are irrelevant .",
    "@xmath47 spin terms - these involve the sum @xmath48 where @xmath49 is a pauli matrix .",
    "these are of order one on the low spin states @xcite , and are thus associated with a factor of @xmath6 relative to the leading terms .",
    "@xmath47 flavor terms  these involve the sum @xmath50 where @xmath44 is a gell - mann matrix , for flavor su(@xmath14 ) .",
    "these terms can add coherently , depending on the flavor quantum numbers of the large @xmath1 baryon state .",
    "below , we will use this approach to write down the operators relevant in computing the @xmath51 helicity amplitudes .",
    "after we have determined the set of operators whose matrix elements are potentially of leading order , we will evaluate the matrix elements using the baryon wave functions corresponding to @xmath18 .",
    "this allows us to avoid any ambiguity in determining which states in a large-@xmath1 baryon multiplet should be identified with the physical states observed in nature . note",
    "that this feature makes our approach different from refs .",
    "@xcite , where a reasonable embedding of the physical baryon states within the large-@xmath1 multiplet is assumed .",
    "_ operators . _",
    "since we are interested in the @xmath52 coupling , we have at the quark level the qed vertex , @xmath53 where the charge @xmath54 is a matrix in su(@xmath14 ) flavor space , @xmath55diag@xmath56 .",
    "thus , at lowest order in flavor symmetry breaking , our operators will involve one factor of the matrix @xmath54 , acting on the flavor indices of the baryon states .",
    "other quark - level operators arise when the operator above acts on one quark line , with gluon exchange involving other lines . from the start",
    ", we will work in coulomb gauge , where @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",

    "we assume that the derivatives in these operators are suppressed by the scale @xmath15 , which we have left implicit , for notational convenience .",

    ", the other operators we present completely span the space of possible two - body interactions .",
    "a three - body operator would involve two sums over the @xmath80 quark lines ; at lowest order in @xmath54 , at least one of these sums would be of the form @xmath81 , which is subleading in @xmath6 , by the rules described earlier in this section .",
    "note that we can generate additional operators if we include pions in our theory , since the pion - quark - quark coupling involves the spin - flavor structure @xmath82 , and can yield a coherent effect when summed over @xmath46 quark lines .",
    "however , in our framework such couplings match onto pion - baryon interactions in the low - energy effective theory , and thus any new spin - flavor operators arise as only as loop effects , which should be small .",
    "this interpretation is consistent with our numerical results , which indicate that our operator list above is sufficient to give an excellent description of the data .",
    "the helicity amplitudes @xmath83 and @xmath84 which we would like to study are defined via the photoproduction differential cross section of the @xmath2 baryons .",
    "there are @xmath85 independent helicity amplitudes ( not connected by isospin ) for * 70 * -plet production off @xmath86 or @xmath25 targets .",

    "the factor @xmath94 is the sign of the @xmath95 amplitude by which the @xmath2 is detected in photoproduction experiments .",
    "this takes into account the proper sign convention that experimenters use when they extract the helicity amplitudes from their data , and also renders our results independent of the sign conventions of the states .",
    "we evaluate the matrix elements in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : a12 ] ) and ( [ eq : a32 ] ) by allowing the our one- and two - body operators to act on tensor representations of the baryon states .",
    "it is important to point out that we have restricted our set of two - body interactions to include only those operators whose matrix elements in ( [ eq : a12 ] ) and ( [ eq : a32 ] ) are linearly independent over the set of nonstrange * 70 * -plet states . in this subspace , we find that the combination of our large-@xmath1 power counting rules , and the constraint of conservation of angular momentum restricts the number of two - body interactions to 11 ; we then found 3 additional , nontrivial operator relations that reduced this set to the 8 operators shown above , @xmath96 , and @xmath97 .",

    "the improvement is so dramatic , we are left with the suspicion that one of the helicity amplitudes is affected by physics that we do not include in our analysis .",
