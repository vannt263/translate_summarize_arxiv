    "the great success achieved by current systems of imaging atmospheric cherenkov telescopes ( iacts ) has led ground - based gamma - ray astronomy to enter a period of great development , with the next generation of instruments being designed to reach unprecedented sensitivities and angular resolution in a more extended energy range , particularly with lower energy thresholds ( @xmath0 ) .",
    "one of the main motivations for the construction of iacts with low @xmath0 is the study of distant extragalactic sources .",
    "gamma - rays from such sources are attenuated by their interactions with the background radiation present in the intergalactic medium . due to this effect , the spectrum is severely suppressed , e.g. the energy cutoff for an extragalactic object with redshift @xmath1 can be as low as @xmath2 gev @xcite . for a general discussion of the physical motivations to lower the energy threshold of iacts",
    "see , e.g. @xcite .",
    "current systems of iacts like hess , magic and veritas have energy thresholds of @xmath3 gev with very large collection area . for a customized trigger system",
    ", the energy threshold of magic can be as low as @xmath4 gev . at these energies gamma - rays",
    "can also be detected by instruments on satellites .",
    "the fermi lat gamma - ray detector is able to detect photons in the energy range from @xmath5 mev up to more than @xmath6 gev @xcite .",
    "its large field of view makes it a very efficient detector for the discovery of new sources .",
    "however , the collection area in satellites is very limited so the sensitivity worsens very rapidly above tens of gev .",
    "thus , although the energy range of fermi overlaps with ground - based iacts , the sensitivity at energies of few gev is low for both detectors .",
    "the most advanced project considering a low @xmath0 is the cherenkov telescope array ( cta ) , the largest international effort for the next generation of iacts with an order of magnitude better sensitivity than current systems @xcite .",
    "in particular , @xmath0 for cta was planned to be @xmath7 gev , although a more realistic value for the present design is @xmath5 gev",
    ". there are also specific proposals whose main technical objective is to lower the energy threshold , like stereo array @xcite , eco-1000 @xcite and @xmath8 @xcite . for the @xmath8 array",
    "it is shown that an @xmath0 in the range @xmath9 gev can be achieved by 5 iacts placed at 5 km of altitude . to test the feasibility of measurements at high altitudes ,",
    "the omega project is also under consideration @xcite .",
    "cosmic ray protons and electrons are the most important background sources for the discrimination of gamma - ray showers developed in the earth s atmosphere .",
    "electron initiated showers are practically indistinguishable from those initiated by gamma - rays and thus their importance for gamma - ray astronomy . for energies below @xmath5 gev , it is predicted that electrons could be differentiated from gamma - ray initiated showers @xcite .",
    "protons are almost two orders of magnitude more numerous than cosmic electrons at energies below @xmath7 gev , increasing toward higher energies as the electron spectrum is steeper than the one corresponding to protons @xcite .",
    "however , protons need quite a bit more energy to produce the same amount of cherenkov light , specially at the lowest energies , going from a factor @xmath10 ( at @xmath11 tev ) to @xmath12 ( at few gev ) @xcite .",
    "additionally , the trigger system of iacts discriminate against protons , although this is less effective at the lowest energies due to fluctuations in the shower development and a drop in image intensity . in the end , for the lowest energies , electrons become the dominant component of the differential trigger rate for a low - energy - threshold iact system @xcite .",
    "all proton events passing the analysis cuts are considered as gamma - rays , and thus their reconstructed energy will be lower than the true energy .",
    "this causes the electron dominance to diminish , making the reconstructed flux of both electrons and protons comparable at the lowest energies @xcite .",
    "cosmic ray electrons and positrons constitute @xmath13 of the total cosmic ray flux arriving at earth in the gev - tev energy range .",
    "it is believed that the high energy component of the electron flux is directly produced by galactic sources such as supernova remnants and pulsars @xcite .",
    "electrons can also be produced by interactions of cosmic ray protons or light nuclei with the interstellar medium gas .",
    "electrons undergo energy losses during their propagation in the interstellar medium .",
    "the main processes are : synchrotron radiation in the galactic magnetic field , inverse compton scattering with photons from stars and the cosmic microwave background , bremsstrahlung with interstellar matter , and ionization . for energies grater",
    "than @xmath7 gev , the electron flux is dominated by the local environment because the attenuation length is reduced to the kpc scale @xcite .",
    "depending on the location on earth , the geomagnetic field can act as a shield for charged particles , suppressing the flux of low energy electrons and , in this way , diminishing their contribution to the background for iacts .",
    "a first study of the geomagnetic field effects on the cosmic electron rate was performed by cortina and gonzlez @xcite , in the context of the magic telescopes , for several geographical positions around the world by using the dipolar approximation of the magnetic field of the earth .",
    "a better description of the geomagnetic field is provided by the international geomagnetic reference field ( igrf ) @xcite , which is given as a multipole expansion up to 10@xmath14 or 13@xmath14 order , depending on the version under consideration . in this case , the problem can not be solved analytically , and thus numerical methods are used . in particular , the backtracking technique is used to find the allowed and forbidden trajectories @xcite .",
    "the shielding of charged particles is not the only effect caused by the magnetic field of the earth at a given location .",
    "extensive air showers develop in the atmosphere generating negatively and positively charged particles , particularly electrons and positrons being the most important for iacts .",
    "these particles are deflected in opposite directions by the component of the geomagnetic field normal to the shower axis .",
    "this spread causes an additional dispersion in cherenkov images recorded by iacts and , consequently , diminishing the background separation efficiency .",
    "there are extensive studies in the literature about this effect ( e.g. @xcite ) , which depends not only on the location on earth but also on the telescope pointing direction .",
    "while this and other effects might be of more importance than the shielding effect , they are not considered in this paper .    in this work",
    "we study the suppression of the cosmic electron flux due to geomagnetic field effects for locations in the southern hemisphere .",
    "moderate to high altitude sites with clear skies are available only in south africa and south america .",
    "thus , we consider here three candidate sites in the southern hemisphere ( which are being considered for the installation of cta ) : el leoncito ( 31:47 s , 69:28 w ) , san antonio de los cobres ( sac , ( 23:50 s , 66:16 w ) ) , both in argentina @xcite , and the hess site in namibia @xcite .",
    "we also study in detail the case of 5@5 , for which we consider the sites llano de chajnantor in the atacama desert , northern chile @xcite , and sac which is very close to the latter ( less than @xmath15 km southwest ) .",
    "the electron flux has been measured by several experiments ( see @xcite for a compilation of experimental data ) .",
    "the most recent measurements with better statistics are from fermi lat @xcite and pamela @xcite .",
    "fermi lat covers the energy range from 7 gev to 1 tev , whereas the corresponding pamela range is from 1 gev to 0.625 tev .",
    "although above @xmath7 gev the pamela spectrum seems to be softer than fermi lat s , they are consistent within uncertainties . for energies below 10 gev the data from older experiments fall within the range of the pamela and heat @xcite results .",
    "the latter can be taken as the extreme minimum case for the measured electron flux arriving at earth . for energies below @xmath7 gev",
    ", the discrepancies on the electron flux measured by different experiments can be explained , in part , by solar modulation effects suffered by incident electrons .    in this work ,",
    "the flux measurements from fermi lat , pamela and the low energy part ( @xmath16 gev ) of heat are considered .",
    "figure [ elflux ] shows the experimental data , where the error bars indicate statistical plus systematic uncertainties .        for the numerical calculation an analytical expression of the electron and positron flux ( @xmath17 )",
    "is used , which is obtained by fitting the data shown in figure [ elflux ] with the following function , @xmath18 where @xmath19 is in gev , @xmath20 is in @xmath21 , and both @xmath22 and @xmath23 sets of parameters are not independent , but related by the conditions that make the flux and its derivative continuous at @xmath24 gev .",
    "figure [ elflux ] shows both fits considered here as the maximum and minimum cosmic electron fluxes : the first corresponding to the combination of pamela and fermi lat data ( @xmath25 : solid line ) , and the second to the combination of fermi lat and the low energy part of heat data ( @xmath26 : dashed line ) .",
    "table [ tabflux ] summarizes all parameters resulting from the fits , as specified in equation ( [ flux ] ) .",
    "it is considered that any other measured flux falls in between these two fits so that all possibilities are covered within uncertainties .",
    "the relevance of the goodness of these fits is discussed in next section .",
    "nevertheless , to evaluate the geomagnetic field effects at a given site , the fit @xmath25 is finally chosen as it is the more recent and better measured electron flux available at present .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     note that the effective area of a given array of iacts depends on the zenith angle of the incident gamma - ray . in order to isolate the dependence of the electron rate with the geomagnetic field , this effect",
    "is not included in the calculations .",
    "instead , it is discussed in section [ 5at5 ] in the context of a particular case , the 5@5 array .",
    "as mentioned above , there are regions on the arrival direction space for which the positron component is important .",
    "although the positron fraction is small at energies close to the @xmath0 considered here , the positron rate can be important in regions of large values of @xmath27 ( small values of @xmath28 ) , rising the importance of the positron component .",
    "figure [ fposelesac ] shows contour plots in aitoff projection of @xmath29 for sac , as a function of azimuth and zenith angles , and using the electron flux @xmath25 .",
    "as expected , the positron contribution is more important in the west region and for large values of zenith angles .",
    "the maximum value of @xmath29 is 0.82 , corresponding to the arrival direction @xmath30 and @xmath31 . in the east region , where @xmath27 takes the smallest values and @xmath28 the largest ones",
    ", @xmath29 is smaller than @xmath32 .     as a function of azimuth and zenith angles for sac , and using the electron flux @xmath25.,width=306 ]    the dependence of @xmath33 with the energy threshold",
    "is also studied .",
    "only the arrival directions corresponding to the maximum and minimum of @xmath33 obtained above for @xmath34 gev are used . note that the result for any other arrival direction fall between these two cases .",
    "figure [ fevseth ] shows @xmath33 as a function of energy threshold for the electron flux @xmath25 .",
    "solid lines correspond to @xmath35 and dashed lines to @xmath36 . from the same figure it can be seen that , if the energy threshold of a given cherenkov telescope is larger than @xmath37 gev and @xmath38 , @xmath39 for all sites , i.e. the geomagnetic field do not help suppressing the electron background for any of the three locations . for arrays with energy threshold smaller than @xmath40 gev ( @xmath37 gev ) and @xmath41 ( @xmath38 ) , the best site ( concerning just the suppression of the electron background ) is sac .",
    "again , the results obtained for el leoncito are quite similar to those of sac . for the namibia site ,",
    "the suppression of the electron flux due to the geomagnetic field begins to be important for energy thresholds smaller than @xmath7 gev , depending on the value of @xmath42 .",
    "as a function of @xmath0 for the three sites under consideration .",
    "only the arrival directions corresponding to the maximum and minimum of @xmath33 obtained for @xmath34 are used ( see text ) .",
    "the electron flux used corresponds to the fit of the pamela and fermi lat data .",
    "solid lines correspond to @xmath35 and dashed lines correspond to @xmath36.,title=\"fig:\",width=302 ] +   as a function of @xmath0 for the three sites under consideration .",

    "the electron flux used corresponds to the fit of the pamela and fermi lat data .",
    "solid lines correspond to @xmath35 and dashed lines correspond to @xmath36.,title=\"fig:\",width=302 ]",
    "the proposed 5@5 array consists of 5 iacts installed at an altitude of 5 km or more @xcite . as mentioned above , the site originally proposed for the array installation",
    "is `` llano de chajnantor '' , chile , at an altitude of @xmath43 5 km and @xmath44 200 km northwest of sac .",
    "note that there are several locations at 5 km of altitude very close to sac which are suitable for the installation of 5@5 , near the location of a new astronomical facility under consideration @xcite .",
    "the effective detection area of 5@5 , for the zenith angle @xmath45 , is calculated as @xcite , @xmath46 the effective area of any array of cherenkov telescopes changes with the zenith angle @xcite .",
    "the distance of the telescope to the shower maximum increases , to a good approximation , proportionally with @xmath47 . as a consequence ,",
    "the cherenkov photons produced during the shower development illuminate a larger area for large zenith angles . due to this effect the effective area increases with increasing @xmath48 by a factor @xmath49 .",
    "also , the number of cherenkov photons that reach the telescopes decreases with increasing @xmath48 as @xmath50 .",
    "this causes the energy threshold to increase by a factor @xmath49 .",
    "therefore , the effective area as a function of energy and zenith angle can be approximated by @xcite , @xmath51 the left panel of figure [ aja ] shows @xmath52 for the 5@5 array as a function of energy for zenith angles @xmath53 and @xmath54 , as estimated by combining equations ( [ aeff5at5 ] ) and ( [ aeff5at5theta ] ) .        in order to study the influence of the geomagnetic field on the cosmic electron rate measured by 5@5 , when it is placed in sac",
    ", the parameter @xmath33 defined by equation ( [ ec2 ] ) is also used here .",
    "the calculation is performed with ( @xmath55 ) and without ( @xmath56 ) including the zenith angle dependence of the effective area : @xmath57 where , @xmath58 here @xmath59 .",
    "now the variables in the integrals run from zero as the collection area includes the energy threshold .",
    "figure [ fe5at5sac ] shows contour plots in aitoff projection of @xmath60 ( top panel ) and @xmath55 ( bottom panel ) , as a function of arriving direction of electrons , obtained for the 5@5 array placed in sac and for the electron flux obtained by fitting pamela and fermi lat data ( @xmath25 ) .",
    "the values of @xmath56 are larger than those obtained for the case studied in the previous section , when a step - function effective area with energy threshold @xmath34 gev was assumed ( table [ tabfe ] ) .",
    "indeed , the maximum and minimum values obtained in this case for 5@5 are @xmath61 and @xmath62 , for @xmath35 .",
    "this is due to the fact that for the case of 5@5 the product @xmath63 has a maximum at @xmath64 gev , as it can be seen from the right panel of figure [ aja ] , whereas for the ideal case the maximum is reached at @xmath65 gev .",
    "( top panel ) and @xmath55 ( bottom panel ) as a function of azimuth and zenith angles for the 5@5 array placed in sac , and using the electron flux @xmath25.,title=\"fig:\",width=306 ]    ( top panel ) and @xmath55 ( bottom panel ) as a function of azimuth and zenith angles for the 5@5 array placed in sac , and using the electron flux @xmath25.,title=\"fig:\",width=306 ]    when the dependence of the effective area with zenith angle is included , @xmath55 changes even more with respect to the ideal case , as it is seen from the bottom panel of figure [ fe5at5sac ] .",
    "in fact , in the region around @xmath66 and @xmath67 , @xmath55 takes values close to one .",
    "this can be understood from the behavior of @xmath68 , shown in figure [ aja ] , and @xmath69 for sac ( see top panel of figure [ ef ] ) . for @xmath67",
    ", @xmath27 decreases from @xmath70 gev at @xmath71 to @xmath72 gev at @xmath66 , then the numerator of @xmath55 ( equation ( [ ec6 ] ) ) is an increasing function of @xmath48 . also from figure [ aja ]",
    "it can be seen that the numerator of @xmath55 is a decreasing function of @xmath48 . as a consequence",
    ", @xmath55 increases with @xmath48 reaching values close to one near @xmath73 . for @xmath74 ,",
    "@xmath75 increases from @xmath70 gev to @xmath4 gev as @xmath48 goes from @xmath76 to @xmath54 , then , the numerator of @xmath55 decreases with @xmath48 .",
    "however , the denominator in equation ( [ ec6 ] ) decreases fast enough to make @xmath55 an increasing function of the zenith angle .",
    "similar results are obtained by using the electron flux @xmath77 . on the other hand , @xmath56 and @xmath55 obtained for `` llano de chajnantor ''",
    "are slightly smaller than the ones obtained for sac ( less than 5% considering all directions ) because , as mentioned above , the distance between these two locations is very small compared with the scale of variation of the geomagnetic field .",
    "note that for the case of 5@5 , the importance of the positron component decreases when the dependence of the effective area with the zenith angle is included .",
    "this is due to the increase of the energy threshold of the system with zenith angle .",
    "in particular , the maximum value reached by @xmath78 is @xmath79 , corresponding to the arrival direction @xmath80 and @xmath31 .",
    "in this work we have studied the suppression of the low energy region of the cosmic electron flux , due to the effect of the geomagnetic field , which is relevant to estimate the background for future generations of ground - based gamma - ray detectors at the lowest energy end of the sensitivity curve .",
    "we have studied this effect regardless its relative significance compared to other effects that might be relevant for cherenkov telescopes .",
    "we have estimated the cosmic electron suppression for sites that are , or have been , proposed for the installation of new cherenkov telescopes systems in the southern hemisphere .",
    "we have considered three sites , two in argentina ( el leoncito and san antonio de los cobres  sac ) and one in namibia . to perform these studies",
    "we have used numerical methods based on the backtracking technique and a multipole representation of the geomagnetic field expanded up to order 10 . considering a step function for the collection area ,",
    "we have found that the largest values of the electron energy , below which the flux is dramatically suppressed , correspond to the site sac .",
    "the values obtained for el leoncito are , on average , slightly smaller than those corresponding to sac .",
    "we have also found that for the namibia site such values of energy are smaller by a factor of two , or even more , depending on the arrival direction of the cosmic electron .",
    "we found that the total cosmic electron flux in sac is suppressed by 90 - 97% for an energy threshold of 3 gev , and by 0 - 75% for an energy threshold of 10 gev , depending on the arrival direction .",
    "for an energy threshold of 19 gev ( 27 gev ) none of these locations shields the electron background for arrival zenith angles up to @xmath81 ( @xmath54 ) .",
    "we have also studied in more detail the case of the proposed 5@5 array , including its simulated collection area as a function of energy . for this case",
    "we have considered two sites : llano de chajnantor in the atacama desert , chile , and sac in the argentinean puna , where several nearby locations at 5 km of altitude can be chosen .",
    "we have found that the geomagnetic field effect severely reduces the expected electron rate arriving at those locations by approximately 70 - 90% of the total cosmic electrons , depending on the direction of arrival .",
    "this suppression is slightly larger for the llano de chajnantor site , by less than 5% .",
    "the authors are members of the carrera del investigador cientfico of conicet , argentina .",
    "we thank the anonymous referees for very helpful comments .",
    "this research was partially funded by a grant awarded by anpcyt , argentina .",
    "figure [ ehpossac ] shows contour plots in aitoff projection of @xmath82 for sac , as a function of azimuth and zenith angles .",
