    "in general , binary systems composed by a white dwarf ( wd ) orbited by a brown dwarf ( bd ) as a companion are rare : the  ( bps cs 29504 - 0036 ) system @xcite , consisting of a wd and a bd orbiting in a 116 min close circular path , belongs to such a class .",
    "bd must have survived a previous phase in which it was engulfed by the red giant progenitor of wd @xcite experiencing orbital drag which notably shrank its orbit , originally much wider .    in @xcite a dynamical determination of its quadrupole mass moment @xmath1 from deviations of the third kepler law was claimed obtaining an unlikely large value for it : @xmath13 kg m@xmath14 , with @xmath15 , where @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the wd s mass and equatorial radius . in this paper",
    "i clarify the meaning of such a result and show how it can be used to constrain the inclination angle @xmath0 .",
    "my analysis furnishes a physical justification of the use of the third kepler law in modeling the orbital period of this particular system , without assuming it uncritically a priori .",
    "moreover , it also corrects an error concerning @xmath0 in @xcite in which @xmath5 deg is quoted , yielding an orbital separation of 0.65r@xmath7 .",
    "such values for @xmath0 and @xmath18 are reported in other works being used for investigations on various aspects of the  system like , e.g. , the determination of @xmath1 itself @xcite and the heating of bd @xcite .",
    "the phenomenologically measured period amounts to @xcite p_b = 0.0830.0002  d : in principle , it accounts for all the dynamical effects affecting our binary system to the measurement accuracy .",
    "let us , now , contrast it to the purely keplerian period p^(0)=2,where @xmath18 is the relative semimajor axis , and @xmath16 and @xmath19 are the masses of wd and bd , respectively , in order to see if it is compatible with @xmath20 , within the errors , or if some significant discrepancy occurs .",
    "such a comparison does , indeed , make sense because the  ingredients \" entering have all been determined in a way which is independent of the third kepler law itself , apart from the inclination @xmath0 which will , thus , be treated as a free parameter .",
    "indeed , the mass of wd @xcite , m=(0.390.035)m_,was non - dynamically inferred from its effective temperature @xmath21 and surface gravity @xmath22 @xcite- measured , in turn , from an analysis of the hydrogen absorption lines of the optical spectrum of wd @xcite - using well tested and reliable models of white dwarfs . then , from = x_m=,where @xmath23 are the projected semiamplitudes of the radial velocities , phenomenologically measured from the spectroscopic radial velocity curves , @xmath24 are the projected barycentric semimajor axes and @xmath0 is the inclination of the orbital plane to the plane of the sky , it is possible to measure the ratio of the masses @xmath25 as @xcite = = 0.1340.006:i have used @xcite @xmath26 from the value of @xmath16 and the mass of the bd follows @xcitem=(0.0520.007)m_.now , from a = ( 1+),it is possible to express @xmath27 in terms of known quantities , apart from the inclination @xmath0 which will be treated as an independent variable on which i want to put some dynamical constrains . note that in @xcite the value @xmath5 deg is released yielding an orbital separation @xmath28r@xmath7 which , in turn , was used to obtain an equilibrium temperature of bd of @xcite t_eq^(bd)=t^(wd)2000k . as we will see , such a value for @xmath0 is probably wrong .",
    "let us investigate the ratio as a function of @xmath0 . from figure [ periodo ]",
    "it can be noted that outside the interval @xmath29 deg such a discrepancy becomes significative at more that 1-sigma level changing its sign as well : inside such a range it is , instead , compatible with zero .",
    "may such a discrepancy have a physical meaning , so that the associated figures for @xmath0 can be considered realistic values for it ?",
    "discrepancy @xmath30 between the measured orbital period @xmath20 and the computed keplerian one @xmath27 , normalized to its error @xmath31 , as function of the inclination @xmath0 .",
    "it becomes significant , at more than 1-sigma level , for @xmath2 deg and @xmath32 deg.,width=491,height=415 ]    deviations from the third kepler law could be induced by dynamical effects neglected in modeling the orbital period .",
    "however , post - newtonian corrections of order @xmath11 @xcite are negligible because much smaller than the experimental error @xmath33 d. another possible candidate is the post - keplerian , newtonian effect of the quadrupole mass moment @xmath1 of wd @xcite .",
    "let us explore this possibility in order to see if it is viable ; such an analysis will also better clarify the strange result obtained in @xcite for @xmath5 deg .",
    "we will see that it can yield us useful insights about the inclination of the considered binary system .    by using of appendix q = -(m+m)a^2(1-e^2)^3/2,in figure [ qu ] i plot @xmath34 and @xmath35 versus @xmath0 , where @xmath36 is given by - of appendix .     the adimensional quantities @xmath34 ( upper panel ) and @xmath35 ( lower panel ) as functions of the inclination @xmath0 .",
    "the upper curve in the lower panel is determined by @xmath37 , while the lower curve in the lower panel is determined by @xmath38 , so that the admissible values for @xmath35 lie in the region delimited by such two curves .",
    ", width=491,height=415 ]    it can be noted that @xmath1 , assumed as responsible of the discrepancy between @xmath20 and @xmath27 , becomes , in fact , a determined quantity at more than 1-sigma level outside about @xmath39 deg : wd would be highly oblate ( @xmath40 ) for @xmath2 deg and highly prolate ( @xmath41 ) for @xmath3 deg .",
    "the physical meaning of such an outcome is , however , suspect because @xmath35 , where @xmath42 is the wd s radius @xcite would get as large as 150 - 200 .",
    "such large values of @xmath35 are unlikely ; wd s quadrupole moment ( normalized to @xmath43 ) are expected to be smaller than 1 @xcite . in principle",
    ", it could be argued that the determined @xmath1 is , in fact , an `` effective '' quantity which accounts for other , unknown dynamical effects .",
    "a more conservative interpretation of our results is that the inclination of the orbital plane of the  system is confined in that interval in which the third kepler law is an adequate description of the orbital dynamics and @xmath1 is compatible with zero",
    ".    i will , now , work within such a framework .",
    "since i have information on @xmath16 independent of the third kepler law itself , i can use them to further constrain @xmath0 .",
    "indeed , by equating @xmath20 to @xmath27 and using and i have i = \\{^1/3}=392  deg.such a value is incompatible with @xmath5 deg quoted in @xcite at more than 2-sigma level . the relative semimajor axis , computed with and , becomes a = ( 0.590.05)r_,yielding an equilibrium temperature for bd of t_eq^(bd)=(2087154)k .",
    "it is interesting to see what are the dynamical constraints on @xmath16 , obtained by modeling the orbital period with the third kepler law , and compare them to the spectroscopic ones yielding .",
    "indeed , from , and i get gm = ( 1+)^2()()^3,used to draw figure [ massawd ] in which the region delimited by @xmath44 is displayed as a function of @xmath0 .",
    "the allowed values for @xmath16 ( solar masses ) , obtained by modeling the orbital period with the third kepler law , lie in the region delimited by the upper curve ( @xmath45 ) and the lower ( @xmath46 ) curve.,width=491,height=415 ]    note that the admitted range of mass values for @xmath5 deg is @xmath47 , which does not overlap with the spectroscopic one of .",
    "in this paper i got dynamical constraints on some orbital and physical parameters of the a / b  binary system consisting of a white dwarf and a brown dwarf as a companion . by using the correction to the third kepler law due to the quadrupole mass moment @xmath1",
    ", i was able to put constraints to the inclination angle @xmath0 of the system . by discarding those values of @xmath0 which would yield significant deviations from the third kepler law associated to unlikely large @xmath1",
    "i obtained @xmath4 deg .",
    "the spectroscopically inferred range of admissible values for the mass @xmath16 of the white dwarf is compatible with our determination of @xmath0 which also yields an orbital separation of @xmath6r@xmath7 and an equilibrium temperature of the brown dwarf of @xmath8k .",
    "an incorrect value quoted in @xcite of @xmath5 deg yields , as a consequence , @xmath28r@xmath7 and @xmath48k .",
    "one of the six keplerian orbital elements in terms of which it is possible to parameterize the orbital motion in a binary system is the mean anomaly @xmath49 defined as @xmath50 , where @xmath51 is the mean motion and @xmath52 is the time of periastron passage .",
    "the mean motion @xmath53 is inversely proportional to the time elapsed between two consecutive crossings of the periastron , i.e. the anomalistic period @xmath20 . in newtonian mechanics , for two point - like bodies , @xmath51 reduces to the usual keplerian expression @xmath54 , where @xmath18 is the semi - major axis of the relative orbit and @xmath55 is the sum of the masses . in many binary systems , as , the period @xmath56 is accurately determined in a phenomenological , model - independent way , so that it accounts for all the dynamical features of the system , not only those coming from the newtonian point - like terms , within the measurement precision .    here",
    "i wish to calculate the contribution of the quadrupole mass moment @xmath1 to the orbital period in a more general and accurate way than done in @xcite by retaining the orbital eccentricity . according to @xcite ,",
    "the acceleration induced by the quadrupole mass moment @xmath1 can be cast into the form a_q= .    the quadrupole mass term @xmath57 is small with respect to the usual newtonian monopole term @xmath58 , so that it can be treated perturbatively .",
    "in order to derive its impact on the orbital period @xmath20 , let us consider the gauss equation for the variation of the mean anomaly in the case of an entirely radial disturbing acceleration @xmath59 t = n - a ( ) + af , where @xmath60 is the true anomaly , reckoned from the periastron .",
