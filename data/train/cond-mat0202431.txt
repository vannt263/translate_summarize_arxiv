    "statistical mechanical theories have been applied to the field of neural networks such as combinatorial optimization and associative memories . recently ,",
    "they have also been applied to the field of information science such as error - correcting codes , image recovery , and cdma @xcite .",
    "for example , the maximum _ a posteriori _ probability ( map ) and the maximum posterior marginals ( mpm ) in the framework of the bayesian estimation correspond to finding the ground state and the equilibrium state of the corresponding spin system , respectively .",
    "from this point of view , information processing can be treated as some kind of relaxation process of spin systems .",
    "the transient dynamics of systems should therefore be discussed from the information theoretic point of view .    in general",
    ", however , theoretical treatment of the dynamics is extremely difficult compared with the equilibrium statistical mechanics of frustrated systems into which many problems concerning the information processing are mapped .",
    "although a lot of works has been done to analyze the transient dynamics @xcite , it is well known that achieving the tractable rigorous treatment is hopeless regarding the dynamics of frustrated systems . in this paper , we discuss a correlation type associative memory model having frustrated couplings , and rigorously derive an exact macroscopic description of the transient dynamics for this model .",
    "there are two types of associative memory models : autoassociative memory models and sequential associative memory models . in the case of autoassociative memory models",
    "@xcite , their storage capacity and phase diagram have been analyzed by equilibrium theories @xcite . in the case of sequential associative memory models , there is no equilibrium state , since the network retrieves different patterns sequentially . as we mentioned above ,",
    "since associative memory models definitely belong to information processing systems , it is important to analyze the information process , that is , the retrieval process of the stored patterns .",
    "although the path - integral method based on the generating function @xcite has the potential ability to provide a rigorous solution for an associative memory model , the theory is formal and intractable because the complexity of the numerical calculation is exponentially large with respect to the time step .",
    "accordingly , the theory can only describe the short time region and equilibrium state .",
    "recently , dring et al .",
    "@xcite presented the path - integral method regarding a sequential associative memory model .",
    "however , they did not discuss the transient properties of the retrieval process , but only analyzed properties of the stationary state , i.e. , the storage capacity and the phase diagram @xcite . on the other hand , the statistical neurodynamics",
    "@xcite is an approximation theory capable of analyzing the long - term behavior of the transient dynamics . here",
    ", the input to the spin or neuron can be divided into two terms .",
    "the first one is a signal term , which is a signal to retrieve , and the second one is a crosstalk noise term , which prevents retrieval . in the statistical neurodynamics , one assumes that the crosstalk noise obeys the gaussian distribution with mean 0 and a time dependent variance , and derives macroscopic recursive equations for the amplitude of the signal term and the variance of the crosstalk noise .",
    "therefore , the basin of attraction and other dynamic properties can be discussed through the statistical neurodynamics . for the autoassociative memory model , nishimori and ozeki tried to numerically check the gaussian assumption using large - scale computer simulations , and found that the assumption holds only when the retrieval process succeeds @xcite .    in this paper , we derive an exact solution of the transient dynamics for the sequential associative memory model through the path - integral method , and derive an approximated solution through the statistical neurodynamics .",
    "we then compare the results of the two theories , and try to clarify their relationship .",
    "this paper is constructed as follows . in the second section , the sequential associative memory model that we use",
    "is defined . in the third section",
    ", we introduce the formal macroscopic state equations obtained by dring et al . using the path - integral method . in the fourth section",
    ", we derive an exact macroscopic description of the transient dynamics by the path - integral method . in the fifth section",
    ", we also derive macroscopic state equations by the statistical neurodynamics , and prove that both the path - integral method and the statistical neurodynamics give the same equations for the sequential associative memory model . in the sixth section ,",
    "the transient dynamics are verified by comparing these theories with computer simulations .",
    "let us consider a sequential associative memory model that consists of @xmath0 spins or neurons .",
    "we consider the case of @xmath1 .",
    "the state of the spins takes @xmath2 and updates the state synchronously with the following probability : @xmath3    & = & \\frac12\\left[1+\\sigma_i(t+1)\\tanh\\beta h_i(t)\\right ] ,    \\label{eqn : dynamics } \\\\",
