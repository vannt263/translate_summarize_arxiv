    "consider a chain assembled from @xmath0 random links with independent , identically distributed breaking strengths @xmath1 , which have probability density @xmath2 .",
    "it is easy to calculate the probability density @xmath3 for the strength of the chain being less than @xmath1 . in some contexts ,",
    "however , the relevant question is a different one : what are the strengths of chain segments of length @xmath0 which are obtained by repeatedly breaking a very long chain ?",
    "such chain segments are expected to be stronger than their randomly assembled counterparts , because they have been produced by a process which has eliminated the weakest links . here",
    "we calculate the distribution of the strength of a chain segment of length @xmath0 which has been produced by repeated breaking a very long chain , of length @xmath4 , say .",
    "specifically , we break the chain of length @xmath4 at its weakest link , then break each fragment at its weakest link and continue the process .",
    "we collect the links of length @xmath0 produced by this process , and determine the probability density of their strengths , @xmath5 .",
    "in this paper we obtain formulae which are precise asymptotic results for the limit where @xmath6 .",
    "the calculation of this distribution involves the use of prior information : we know that the chain segment of length @xmath0 and breaking strength @xmath1 was produced by breaking a longer and weaker chain , of length @xmath7 and breaking strength @xmath8 .",
    "what makes the problem difficult is that the prior information , in the form of the values of @xmath7 and @xmath8 , is itself uncertain .",
    "it is hard to solve this problem for the case of a chain which has previously been broken only once . in the case of a chain which has been broken many times , the distributions of @xmath8 and",
    "@xmath7 themselves depend on previous breakages .",
    "the problem appears to be very difficult when the chain has previously been broken many times .",
    "we consider the case where the chain is very long , and we anticipate that there is an asymptotic form for the strength distribution which is independent of the initial length @xmath9 .",
    "we use a self - consistent calculation and obtain @xmath5 in closed form in terms of the cumulative strength distribution of an individual link , @xmath10 , and the corresponding probability density @xmath11 : @xmath12\\exp[-n p(x)]\\ .\\ ] ] ( we use @xmath13 to mean that @xmath14 and @xmath15 are asymptotically equal in the limit as @xmath16 . ) for comparison , the corresponding probability density for the strength of a randomly assembled chain is @xmath17\\ .\\ ] ] figure [ fig : 1 ] shows the comparison between equation ( [ eq : 0 ] ) and a histogram of data from a numerical simulation of the chain - breaking process , for a particular choice of link strength distribution @xmath2 .",
    "shows @xmath5 for three different values of @xmath0 , namely @xmath18 ( red ) , @xmath19 ( green ) and @xmath20 ( blue ) , for @xmath21 .",
    "shown are results of computer simulations ( histogram ) and those of ( [ eq : 0 ] ) which for the case described here takes the form @xmath22 { \\rm e}^{-2x}+1/2\\ } { \\rm e}^{-n(1-(1+x){\\rm e}^{-x})}$].,width=264 ]    we were motivated to study this chain - breaking process because it models fragmentation process in which the distribution of strengths of fragments ( rather than the distribution of fragment sizes ) is the principal concern .",
    "we are not aware of any earlier investigations of the strength distribution of fragments .",
    "the chain - breaking process is of interest because it is a fundamental model for such processes , which has an explicit solution for the distribution @xmath5 .",
    "the model also has direct application to the degradation of long chain polymers .    in section 2",
    "we consider the distribution of the sizes of fragments of a repeatedly broken chain , and section 3 describes elementary results for randomly assembled chains . in section 4",
    "these expressions are used to obtain a recursion for a sequence of distributions which are related to @xmath5 .",
    "finally section 5 shows how the limiting distribution of this sequence is obtained self - consistently , and used to derive equation ( [ eq : 0 ] ) above .",
    "first we discuss the distribution of sizes of chain fragments .",
    "after @xmath23 steps of splitting the chain , we have @xmath24 fragments . let @xmath25 be the number of segments of lengths @xmath0 at step @xmath23 , and let us consider the case where these numbers are so large that it is sufficient to calculate expectation values and ignore the statistical fluctuations of @xmath25 ( this assumption is valid in the limit as @xmath26 ) . using the fact that the position of the weakest link has equal probability to be at any site , these numbers satisfy a recursion relation @xmath27 rather than following this iteration for a single chain being broken , it is easier to consider a steady state @xmath28 , with destruction of one additional chain being initiated at each step .",
    "thus we seek to solve @xmath29 we find @xmath30 for @xmath16 for some constant @xmath31 .",
    "by way of preparation we discuss elementary results on the distribution of strengths for a chain with completely random links .",
    "let @xmath32 be the probability that a chain of length @xmath0 breaks at a tension which is less than @xmath1 .",
    "for @xmath33 , we have @xmath34 . the probability that a chain of @xmath0 links is unbreakable at tension @xmath1 is @xmath35^n$ ] . in the limit",
    "where @xmath6 , the power may be approximated by exponentiation : we find @xmath36 $ ] ( which gives ( [ eq : -1 ] ) upon differentiation ) .",
    "we also require the conditional probability @xmath37 that a chain of length @xmath0 breaks at tension @xmath1 if we know that it is definitely not broken by a tension @xmath8 . in this case we know that the probability of the strength of an individual element being less than @xmath1 is @xmath38/[1-p(x_0)]$ ] , so that @xmath39^n\\ ] ] provided that @xmath40 ( and zero otherwise ) .",

    "our objective is to obtain the probability density @xmath5 that a chain of length @xmath0 , which has been produced by repeatedly breaking a very long chain , has breaking strength @xmath1 .",
    "we determine this distribution of strengths by calculating a related distribution .",
    "consider the subdivision of the chain , starting from a very long chain of length @xmath4 .",
    "when this is repeatedly split , for convenience we always discuss the leftmost segment . at the @xmath23th stage of subdivision , this segment having length @xmath43 is produced by breaking a link of strength @xmath44 .",
    "let the probability density for the strength of this broken link be @xmath45 .",
    "the corresponding probability for the @xmath23th split to occur at a tension less than @xmath44 for a segment of length @xmath43 is @xmath46 .",
    "we shall obtain a recursion formula which expresses @xmath47 in terms of this distribution .",
    "the chain fragment at stage @xmath48 is produced by breaking a segment of length @xmath43 , in which all of the links are known to be stronger than @xmath44 .",
    "both of these items of prior information have uncertain values .",
    "consider first the distribution of values of @xmath43 , for a given value of @xmath49 .",
    "we have already seen ( equation ( [ eq : 2 ] ) ) that repeated random sub - division of an interval produces a steady - state distribution of lengths @xmath50 .",
    "subdivision of an interval of length @xmath51 produces an interval of length @xmath49 with probability @xmath52 .",
    "the probability distribution for @xmath43 is therefore proportional to @xmath53 for @xmath51 ( and zero otherwise ) . for @xmath54 ,",
    "the normalised distribution of @xmath43 is therefore @xmath55 the probability @xmath56 is obtained from @xmath57 by averaging over the probability densities of both @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "( note that the latter probability density is related to the unknown function that we wish to calculate . ) : @xmath58 differentiating ( [ eq : 8 ] ) with respect to @xmath59 and substituting the known expressions for @xmath60 and @xmath61 we obtain @xmath62\\bigr)\\rho_i ( x_i\\vert n_i)\\ .\\ ] ]",
    "we assume that the distribution @xmath63 becomes independent of the generation index @xmath23 when we consider the subdivision of a very long chain .",
    "this leads to a self - consistency condition for the probability density @xmath64 . approximating the sum in equation ( [ eq : 9 ] ) by an integral , and replacing @xmath65 and @xmath66 by the asymptotic , self - consistent function @xmath67 yields @xmath68\\bigr)\\rho_\\infty ( x_0\\vert n_0)\\ .\\ ] ]",
    "we assume that the corresponding probability @xmath69 is of the form @xmath70 for some function @xmath71 ( which increases monotonically from @xmath72 to @xmath73 ) . writing @xmath74 , the derivative @xmath75 of @xmath71 satisfies @xmath76 f(n_0w_0)\\ .\\ ] ] we express this integral equation in terms of @xmath77 , and differentiate .",
