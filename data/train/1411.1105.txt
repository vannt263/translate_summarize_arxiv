    "the celebrated theorem of cheeger and mller establishes the equality of reidemeister and analytic torsion on an odd - dimensional closed manifold equipped with a flat euclidean bundle .",
    "this was originally conjectured by ray - singer @xcite , proven by cheeger and mller @xcite and subsequently extended by mller @xcite and bismut - zhang @xcite .",
    "the importance and usefulness of the theorem stems from the fact that the reidemeister torsion , or r - torsion , is a combinatorial invariant of simplicial complexes while the analytic torsion is a smooth invariant defined via the spectrum of the hodge laplacian .",
    "this connection is behind many applications in topology , number theory , and mathematical physics .",
    "one particularly interesting aspect of this theorem is that it allows us to use analysis to study the size of the torsion in cohomology .",
    "for example , if @xmath0 is a complex of free abelian groups and @xmath1 then the reidemeister torsion ( after some canonical choices , see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* example 1.3 ) ) is given by @xmath2 this relationship has been recently exploited to study the growth of torsion in group homology by studying the analytic torsion of locally symmetric spaces @xcite . + since locally symmetric spaces often have a natural compactification to a stratified space , it is natural to look for an analogue of the the cheeger - mller theorem in this context .",
    "on such a space , the natural cohomology to consider is the intersection cohomology of goresky - macpherson @xcite . in 1987",
    ", dar @xcite introduced the intersection @xmath3-torsion on stratified spaces , an analogue of the @xmath3-torsion defined in terms of intersection cohomology and a choice of perversity .",
    "dar also proposed that the intersection @xmath3-torsion should be related to the analytic torsion of some appropriately chosen incomplete iterated edge metric adapted to the singularities of the stratified spaces .",
    "there are many recent advances on this question @xcite , but still no relation obtained even in the simplest case where the stratified space has only isolated conical singularities .    in @xcite",
    ", we proposed instead to relate the intersection @xmath3-torsion on a stratified space of depth one to the analytic torsion of a fibred cusp metric using the geometric microlocal analysis methods of melrose .",
    "specifically , let @xmath4 be the interior of a manifold with boundary @xmath5 and assume that the boundary participates in a fiber bundle of closed manifolds @xmath6 let @xmath7 be a boundary defining function for @xmath8 that is , a smooth function on @xmath5 that vanishes precisely at @xmath9 and with non - vanishing differential there .",
    "a metric @xmath10 on @xmath4 is a fibered cusp metric , or @xmath11-metric , if it is asymptotically of the form @xmath12 where @xmath13 is a submersion metric on @xmath14 we say @xmath10 is an ` even ' @xmath11-metric if @xmath15 and @xmath16 are functions of @xmath17 see @xcite for more details .",

    "we prove that this analytic torsion can be expressed in terms of the reidemeister torsion of @xmath5 relative to @xmath25 and in terms of the reidemeister torsion @xmath26 of dar @xcite of the singular space @xmath27 obtained from @xmath5 by ` coning - off ' the fibers of the fiber bundle @xmath28    [ thm : dcheegermuller ] let @xmath29 be an odd - dimensional riemannian manifold with fibered cusp ends and an even @xmath11-metric .",
    "let @xmath30 be a unimodular representation meaning that @xmath31 endow the associated flat vector bundle @xmath32 with an even bundle metric @xmath23 and assume that it is ` strongly acyclic at infinity ' in that @xmath33 then the logarithm of the analytic torsion satisfies @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the mapping cylinder of @xmath36 and @xmath37 is an orthonormal basis of @xmath38-harmonic forms with respect to the metrics @xmath10 and @xmath23 inducing a basis for @xmath39 .",
    "the strong acyclicity condition at infinity , which is satisfied in many situations , greatly simplifies the analysis , since then there are no non - zero small eigenvalues forming under the degeneration , the spectrum of the hodge laplacian of the fibered cusp metric is discrete and the corresponding heat kernel is trace class .    in the present paper",
    ", we specialize to cusp metrics , which are fibered cusps for which @xmath40 is a point , and we replace the strong acyclicity condition at infinity on @xmath41 with a much weaker ` witt condition ' for which small eigenvalues do appear . with this weaker condition",
    "the hodge laplacian typically has continuous spectrum ( albeit bounded away from @xmath42 ) and the heat kernel is no longer trace class .",

    "in fact , while for @xmath50 the metrics @xmath51 are smooth riemannian metrics on @xmath52 as @xmath53 the metric degenerates along @xmath48 and becomes a cusp metric on @xmath54 . in the limit",
    ", the de rham operator @xmath55 associated to @xmath51 has two model operators .",
    "on @xmath56 we obtain @xmath57 the de rham operator of the limiting cusp metric .",

    "in particular we proved that there are finitely many eigenvalues of @xmath64 that converge to zero as @xmath65 we call these the _ small eigenvalues _ and denote the product of the non - zero small eigenvalues by @xmath66 ( and the square of this product by @xmath67 ) .",
    "if @xmath68 is polyhomogeneous in @xmath69 the metric @xmath51 is of ` product - type ' and the flat bundle is witt in that @xmath70 then the determinant of the laplacian satisfies @xmath71    the acyclicity condition at infinity that we imposed in the fibered cusp setting implies that the last two terms in do not contribute to the analytic torsion . to remove the acyclicity condition in the cusp setting and",
    "compute the limit of analytic torsion as @xmath53 , we will establish that @xmath72 is polyhomogeneous in @xmath73 and compute its finite part as @xmath53 ( corollary [ poly.1 ] ) , and we will compute the determinant of the model operator @xmath74 (  [ sec : atdb ] , especially ) .",
    "another consequence of removing the acyclicity condition is that the analytic torsion should be thought of not as a number , but as a function that assigns a number to each basis of the cohomology @xmath75 so we will also compute the behavior of a basis of harmonic forms as @xmath53 ( ) .",
    "these pieces together determine the limit of analytic torsion as @xmath65 in theorem [ rt.10 ] we determine how the reidemeister torsion of @xmath43 is related to the reidemeister torsion of @xmath76 all together we establish the following theorem in corollary [ ff.20 ] .",

    "the canonical identification gives a basis @xmath84 for @xmath85 using these bases to define the corresponding @xmath3-torsions , we have the following formula : @xmath86 where @xmath87 is the cone over @xmath48 .",

    "for instance , if @xmath89 , one can just take the trivial representation . on the other hand , notice that if we require , as in dar s original definition , that the flat vector bundle @xmath45 be defined on the stratified space @xmath27 , then @xmath45 is automatically trivial on @xmath48 and the witt condition can not be achieved when @xmath90 .",
    "however , as we describe in @xcite , the intersection @xmath3-torsion can also be defined for flat vector bundles defined only on the smooth stratum of a stratified space of depth one . with this extra degree of freedom",

    "their proof requires a careful study of small eigenvalues , which in their context refers to near - zero eigenvalues on a truncated hyperbolic manifold .",
    "we have heard from venkatesh that one can in principle deduce a formula for the ratio of reidemeister torsion and analytic torsion from the proof of their relative cheeger - mller theorem .",
    "a theorem close to ours in the hyperbolic setting is an interesting cheeger - mller theorem due to pfaff @xcite .",
