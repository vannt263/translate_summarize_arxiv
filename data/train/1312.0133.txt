    "caching is a key component in information - centric networks ( icn )  @xcite . in - network",
    "caching not only reduces an isp s outgoing traffic , but also reduces traffic within an isp network .",
    "byte hit rate ( bhr ) is a common metric for evaluating savings in inter - isp traffic , however , there is no widely accepted metric for evaluating savings in intra - isp traffic .",
    "footprint reduction ( fpr )  @xcite has been proposed as one such metric and is the one we use in this paper .",
    "we show that bhr by itself is insufficient in capturing the performance of a network of caches ; this is often overlooked by existing work .",
    "this paper shows that there is a subtle interplay between bhr and fpr and that in some cases these two metrics oppose each other .",
    "we argue that a _ cooperation policy _ among routers can mediate this tradeoff between bhr and fpr and show that two parameters can tune the desired operating region : maximum number of duplicates for each content item ( @xmath1 ) and the radius for cooperation ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "to improve bhr , a cooperation policy covering a large radius enhances network storage utilization by reducing the number of duplicates ( _ cache diversity _ in  @xcite ) .",
    "however , large - scale cooperation causes communication overheads and increases intra - isp traffic because requests may be redirected many times . despite efforts in designing a cooperation policy  @xcite , a proper model for its impact on bhr and fpr is still missing .",
    "we characterize cooperation policy by its search strength ( @xmath2 ) and capability of reducing duplicates ( @xmath1 ) .",
    "we show how different @xmath2 and @xmath1 values lead to different tradeoffs between bhr and fpr , and discuss their implication .",
    "there is considerable interest in exploiting topological properties in cache networks .",
    "initial efforts  @xcite indicate centrality as a promising metric , but questions like how to measure the topological impact on performance and mechanism of the interplay between topology , and caching strategy still remain open .",
    "we use a cache cooperation policy to couple content with topology and show that this coupling explains how topological properties impact caching performance ; the tightness of the coupling indicates degree of topology s impact .",
    "our contributions in this paper are as follows :    1 .",
    "we highlight the importance of fpr as a performance metric for in - network caching , and show how bhr and fpr conflict each other at the pareto frontier .",
    "we propose a cooperation policy model to show the relationship between cooperation policy , content , and topology .",
    "we also categorize different cooperation types .",
    "we propose a novel way to measure the impact of topology , and perform a thorough numerical analysis to show how it influences system performance .",
    "consider a network of @xmath3 routers , @xmath4 of which directly receive user requests and are _",
    "edge routers_. a router denoted by @xmath5 is equipped with a storage capacity of @xmath6 bytes .",
    "we assume @xmath7 distinct files , denoted by @xmath8 and being @xmath9 bytes in size .",
    "all files are stored permanently at the content provider ( cp ) represented as the @xmath10 router ( @xmath11 ) .",
    "denote the request probability of @xmath8 by this file s _ popularity _",
    "@xmath12 , and denote the popularity vector by @xmath13 $ ] .",
    "when a request for @xmath8 arrives to an edge router @xmath14 , @xmath14 first searches @xmath8 in its cache .",
    "if @xmath14 possesses it , @xmath14 transmits @xmath8 to the user ; this a _",
    "hit_. otherwise , in case of a _ miss _ , @xmath14 contacts routers in its _ r - hop neighborhood _ to see if any of them has @xmath8 ; this is the _ cooperation policy_. we call the set of all routers located at most @xmath0-hops away from @xmath14 as the _ searchable set _ of @xmath14 , denoted by @xmath15 .",
    "if @xmath8 is stored in @xmath15 , it is retrieved to @xmath14 from the closest router ( if multiple routers holding @xmath8 ) and forwarded to the user .",
    "let @xmath16 be the set of all routers on the path between a leaf router @xmath14 and the cp ( excluding the cp ) .",
    "if no router in @xmath15 stores the item , the request is routed to the next router in @xmath16 and searched there as well as in the new searchable set ; there may be overlap between searchable sets of two neighboring routers , depending on @xmath0 .",
    "we define the _ reachable set _ of a router denoted by @xmath17 as the set of all routers in the searchable sets of routers in @xmath16 .",
    "if no router in @xmath17 has @xmath8 , it is downloaded from the cp and routed to the user following the backward path .",
    "performance of a cooperation policy is determined by contents in the searchable set which is a function of @xmath2 .",
    "the diversity of contents cached in this set increases caching efficiency which then calls for a caching scheme avoiding duplicate copies in the set  @xcite .",
    "however , popular content may better be cached in multiple routers to be more accessible from all network edge routers .",
    "we model this tradeoff with parameter @xmath1 which is the maximum number of content replicas in the network . in reality",
    "every file would have its own maximum number of copies which emerges automatically if @xmath2 is fixed ; we use a fixed @xmath1 to illustrate system behavior across the whole parameter range . using these two parameters",
    ", we name a cooperation policy with parameters @xmath18 and @xmath0 as _ ( k , r)-cooperation policy _ which can be classified into four as follows :    1 .",
    "type i , * small @xmath2 , small @xmath1 * : weak cooperation due to limited access to other caches and limited availability of popular content ; the system is not using all its resources .",
    "type ii , * small @xmath2 , large @xmath1 * : this is en - route caching .",
    "the most popular content is pushed to the network edge .",
    "type iii , * large @xmath2 , small @xmath1 * : network storage is effectively a single cache .",
    "popular content is in network core .",
    "type iv , * large @xmath2 , large @xmath1 * : strong cooperation .",
    "bhr and fpr can not be improved at the same time since caching system is fully - utilized and reaches its pareto frontier .    the complexity of cooperation can be calculated via communication and computation overhead  @xcite .",
    "initially , all routers exchange their set of stored contents with routers in their searchable set . assuming that each content is unit size and dropping the router index",
    ", this initialization step requires @xmath19 messages and results in @xmath20 message exchanges in the worst case . upon a change in the cache of a router",
    ", this router informs all its @xmath0-hop neighbours about the evicted and admitted items .",
    "this per change announcement requires @xmath21 message in the worst case . in terms of computation",
    ", the cooperation does not involve any processing rather than discovering which of the replicas is closest to a specific router .",
    "therefore , computation overhead is @xmath21 .",
    "assume a centralized entity deciding which items are stored at each router @xmath5 when a user requests item @xmath22 at time @xmath23 .",
    "this entity knows the content distribution @xmath24 $ ] where @xmath25 is 1 if @xmath26 is stored at node @xmath27 , and zero otherwise .",
    "an optimal caching strategy ( @xmath28 ) determines whether to cache @xmath22 in the routers between the edge router @xmath29 receiving the request and router @xmath30 storing @xmath22 , and which items to evict in case of full cache occupancy .",
    "we refer the set of all these intermediate nodes on the path between @xmath29 and @xmath30 as @xmath31 .",
    "@xmath28 minimizes the total cost of serving user requests by exploiting its knowledge of current content distribution @xmath32 , file popularities ( @xmath33 ) , and file size ( @xmath34 ) information .",

    "let our decision variable @xmath38 be 1 if @xmath14 downloads @xmath26 from @xmath37 .",
    "the cost function reflects the distance between the two entities and can be calculated using shortest path algorithms . for a ( k , r)-cooperation policy ,",
    "as the routers not in @xmath17 are not reachable from this edge router , we set @xmath39 if @xmath40 . for harmony of notation",
    ", we re - define the content distribution by @xmath41 $ ] ( and drop @xmath23 if we do not refer to a specific time ) .",
    "@xmath28 is formulated as : @xmath42 our objective ( [ obj : mincost ] ) calculates the cost of serving user requests over all the edge routers and minimizes this cost by favoring the most popular files .",

    "we calculate the betweenness centrality ( @xmath57 ) of each router in order to analyze its impact on cached content in a specific router under various @xmath58 pairs .",
    "we define _ coupling factor _ ( cpf ) as the pearson correlation between @xmath57 and average popularity per bit in a node s cache ; it measures topological impact on system performance .",
    "the rationale is that optimal system performance is achieved by placing content at specific locations in a network according to its popularity and that @xmath57 is a good metric to characterize a node s position in a graph .",
    "strong correlation between the two indicates that content is tightly `` coupled '' with topology and topological properties influence system performance .    in the simulations , 30% of the edge routers",

    "the solution to @xmath28 provides the optimal cache profiles for given @xmath1 and @xmath2 ( e.g. , point @xmath59 in fig .  [",
    "fig : eval:1:pareto ] ) , but it does not indicate the best values for these two parameters , i.e. , we can improve performance by tuning @xmath1 and @xmath2 , because the system may be underutilized . however , our optimization model can be used to find pareto frontier of the performance ( green arc @xmath60 in fig .",
    "[ fig : eval:1:pareto ] ) .",
    "when we reach the pareto frontier , we can not improve bhr or fpr without hurting the other .",

    "how and where it falls on the frontier depends on how it balances bhr and fpr .",
    "content popularity and topology strongly correlate with each other only close to the pareto frontier . whether the correlation is positive or negative depends on how the cooperation policy favors one of the two metrics .",
