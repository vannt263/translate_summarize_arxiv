    "in recent years , statistical mechanics has played an important role in quantitative investigation of the social , economic , and psychological phenomena  @xcite .",
    "some social phenomena bear the resemblance to the physical processes in a sense that the macroscopic complex patterns emerge from the interaction of a large number of microscopic constituents . along this line ,",
    "one of the interesting subjects to physicists is opinion dynamics , most of which are concerned either with agent based model studies  @xcite or with the analysis of real data such as election results  @xcite . for the model studies the effect of interaction structure has been considered in terms of the complex network theory  @xcite .",
    "more recently , various coevolving networks with the agents interacting on those networks have been proposed and studied  @xcite .",
    "the coevolution of networks with agents may be justified for a broad range of social phenomena , because each agent may construct or reconstruct his or her own neighborhoods in response to the interaction with other agents .    in this paper",
    ", we study a coevolving helping network model , known as the rescue model  @xcite .",
    "this model was motivated by the _ bystander effect _ observed in social psychology : the witnesses are less likely to intervene in the emergency situation when there are more witnesses .",
    "the bystander effect was introduced by latan and his colleagues in the late 1960 s  @xcite . since then",
    ", the prosocial and helping behavior was investigated extensively from micro- to macro - level perspectives  @xcite .",
    "the meso - level perspective corresponds to the study of helper - recipient dyads .",
    "we would like to see how the collective helping behavior at the level of society emerges from the repeated helper - recipient interactions .",
    "we adopt the coevolutionary dynamics consisting of two stages such as ( a ) an agent s behavior depending on the relations with other involved agents and ( b ) the relation update resulting from the agent s behavior .",
    "the assumptions of the model are based on the results of social psychological experiments in the laboratory  @xcite : first , the witnesses who had an acquaintance with the victim were faster to report the victim s distress than did the other witnesses .",
    "second , the witnesses who had friends among themselves responded to the emergency situation faster .",
    "thus the relations among the involved agents definitely affected their helping behaviors . for simplicity , we assume that the various relations among agents , such as friendship or short acquaintances , can be modeled by a simple ( unweighted and undirected ) link between nodes of a network , where a node represents an agent .",
    "we interpret the link as one node s expectation of help by the other node .",
    "the link density of a network can be interpreted as the aggregate expectation of help in a society .",
    "a new link between the intervening witness ( helper ) and the victim ( recipient ) may be created as a result of the successful intervention . or the existing link between them may be severed when the intervention fails , because the failure may reduce the future expectation of help between each other . furthermore , to build the feasible model we adopt the cost - reward model for the witness s arousal to the emergency  @xcite",
    "one of the basic assumptions is that the degree of arousal that a witness perceives is a monotonically increasing function of the perceived severity and clarity of the emergency . here",
    "we will use the more explicit term , i.e. the degree of willingness to intervene , rather than the degree of arousal .    in the previous works on the rescue model  @xcite",
    ", the authors investigated the effect of the number of involved witnesses @xmath0 on the collective helping behavior .",
    "they reported a _",
    "non - monotonic _ variation of the link density ( aggregate expectation of help ) with @xmath0 at some moderate values of the model parameters , which are partly consistent with the field study results  @xcite . in this work",
    ", we present the full phase diagram through the comprehensive analytic study of the model with small @xmath0 in the whole parameter space .",
    "we identify the various kinds of active and inactive phases and analyze the nature of phase transitions .",
    "furthermore , we study the fluctuations which are responsible for finite - size effects and correlations .",
    "numerical simulation results for large @xmath0 reveal various kinds ( _ normal , reverse , complex _ ) of bystander effects depending on the parameter values .",
    "we propose the underlying mechanism for these bystander effects , which is consistent with the numerical and analytical results .",

    "we briefly introduce the coevolving helping network ( chn ) model  @xcite . in the chn , a node represents an agent and a link between two nodes represents a _",
    "friendly _ relation between two agents .",
    "the links are unweighted and undirected , so the network is defined by the symmetric adjacency matrix @xmath1 where @xmath2 if two nodes @xmath3 and @xmath4 are connected by a link and @xmath5 otherwise .    at each time step ,",
    "an accident ( emergency ) occurs involving a randomly chosen agent @xmath6 ( victim ) and also randomly chosen @xmath0 agents ( witnesses ) from a population of @xmath7 agents ( nodes ) .",
    "the set of @xmath0 agents for the victim @xmath6 is denoted by @xmath8 .",
    "each accident carries the degree of its severity represented by @xmath9 , which is randomly drawn uniformly from @xmath10 .",
    "each witness @xmath11 needs to overcome , at least , its nonnegative potential cost @xmath12 to intervene in an accident ( rescue attempt ) .",
    "furthermore , the possibility of the rescue attempt by the witness should be enhanced by the friendly relation between the victim and the witness as well as the number of friends of the witness in the other @xmath13 witnesses .",
    "summing up all together , we may write the degree of willingness @xmath14 of the witness @xmath3 to intervene in the accident occurred at time @xmath15 on the victim @xmath6 as @xmath16 -c_i.\\label{eq : xvi } x_{iv}(t)=q+a \\rho_{iv}(t ) + b \\sum_{j\\in \\lambda_v^i } [ 2\\rho_{ij}(t)-1 ] -c_i , \\label{eq : xvi}\\ ] ] where @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and @xmath19 denotes the set @xmath8 excluding the witness @xmath3 .",
    "the interaction term between witnesses enhances @xmath14 if the witness @xmath3 has more friends than strangers in @xmath19 , and vice versa .",
    "the magnitude of the interaction term increases with @xmath0 as it can vary from @xmath20 ( all other witnesses are friends of the witness @xmath3 ) to @xmath21 ( all other witnesses are strangers to the witness @xmath3 ) .",
    "so we expect that the interaction term may dominate the evolving dynamics over all other terms for sufficiently large @xmath0 .",
    "we select the witness @xmath11 with the largest value of @xmath14 as the intervener  @xcite .",
    "if there are more than one witnesses with the largest @xmath14 , one of them is selected randomly .",
    "the intervention attempt would succeed if @xmath22 and fail otherwise , which is followed by the link ( relation ) update between the victim and the intervener .",
    "if successful , the friendly relation will be set up or maintained between the victim and the intervener .",
    "otherwise , they become or remain strangers to each other .",
    "the link update dynamics is summarized as @xmath23 , \\label{eq : evol}\\ ] ] where @xmath24 is a heaviside step function with @xmath25 for @xmath26 and @xmath5 for @xmath27 .",
    "we choose the time step @xmath28 for convenience where @xmath29 is the total number of possible links between @xmath7 nodes . at the next time step ,",
    "the above procedure is repeated and the time @xmath15 is incremented by 1 after @xmath30 such iterations .",
    "we focus on the link density @xmath31 and the hole density @xmath32 as the order parameters , respectively : @xmath33 which should be proportional to the aggregate mean expectation of help ( intervention ) in a society , which can be one of the important social features .",
    "finally , in this work , we assume @xmath34 for all @xmath3 for simplicity , which may be valid for a sufficiently homogeneous population .",
    "the @xmath37 case is special .",
    "every witness s degree of willingness is identical as @xmath38 and the intervener is randomly selected among witnesses , regardless of the number of witnesses @xmath0 .",
    "the probability for the successful intervention ( @xmath39 ) should be equal to @xmath40 for @xmath41 .",
    "thus , probabilistically , the number of links increases by 1 with the rate @xmath42 and decreases by 1 with the rate @xmath43 . for @xmath44 , @xmath45 and @xmath46 .    in the mean - field",

    "it is easy to show that @xmath31 behaves as @xmath54 with the steady - state density @xmath55 as @xmath56 which implies that there is a nonequilibrium phase transition at @xmath57 from an active phase ( @xmath58 for @xmath59 ) into an inactive phase ( @xmath60 for @xmath61 ) .",

    "it is straightforward to analyze the rate equation , which yields the steady - state density and its long - time dynamics .",

    "of course , the region iv is unphysical , so we focus on the three other regions and the transition lines between them .    approaching the i - iii transition line ( @xmath105 ) inside the active phase , the order parameter scales as @xmath106 with @xmath107 $ ] , @xmath108 , and @xmath109 .",
    "near the i - ii transition line ( @xmath110 ) , the hole density @xmath111 plays a role of the order parameter , which scales as @xmath112 with @xmath113 , @xmath114 , and @xmath115 .",
    "note that the steady - state link density @xmath116 becomes smaller as @xmath0 increases .",
    "in fact , one can easily show from eq .",
    "( [ rho2 ] ) that this holds for the whole region of the active phase , see fig .  [ fig : order ] .",
    "it implies that the society becomes less friendly ( lower link density ) with large @xmath0 ( more crowded society like big cities ) in the long - time limit ( _ normal _ bystander effect ) .",
    "therefore , one may regard the normal bystander effect as the result of iterative intervention attempts at the level of society .    from the dynamic rules ( transition rates ) of our model , eq .  ( [ tran_rate ] )",
    ", it is easy to understand how this happens .",
    "a new link may be created only when there are no existing links between a victim and any of @xmath0 witnesses , which we call the _ @xmath0-hole constraint_. ( note that this applies only when @xmath88 . )",
    "the probability of finding this situation is proportional to @xmath117 , which monotonically decreases with @xmath0 .",
    "so one can expect that the steady - state link density should be smaller with larger @xmath0 .",
    "however , with interactions between witnesses ( @xmath118 ) , the @xmath0-hole constraint is not absolutely necessary to create a new link , which will be discussed later .",
    "furthermore , suppose we are allowed to control @xmath119 , for example , decrease @xmath119 by giving all agents the same incentive for intervention .",
    "the efficiency of our policy might be measured by the slope of the link density , i.e. @xmath120 . as can be easily seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : order ] , the policy becomes quite effective near the paradise phase and more effective for larger @xmath0 .",
    "however , it will be less efficient near the isolation phase and much lesser for larger @xmath0 .",
    "these results imply that the incentive policy would not work well in unfriendly and crowded communities like big and rapidly developed cities , but may work efficiently in friendly and crowded communities like a guild .",
    "now , we study the long - time dynamics in various regions . in the regions",
    "i and iii , the link density decays exponentially : @xmath121 with the characteristic time @xmath122 such that @xmath123 in the active phase and @xmath124 for @xmath125 or @xmath0 for @xmath126 , respectively in the isolation phase . along the i - iii transition line",
    ", the link density still decays exponentially with @xmath127 , which implies that this transition line is not critical but absorbing , i.e.   the @xmath57 line belongs to the isolation phase . approaching the i - ii transition line ( @xmath110 ) , the relaxation time diverges as @xmath128 with the relaxation time exponent @xmath129 for @xmath130 .",
    "so the incentive policy works efficiently in this region , but its effect will show up quite slowly .    in the region ii ( paradise phase ) , the long - time decay dynamics follows a much slower power - law : the hole density @xmath131 with the decay exponent @xmath132 for @xmath130 except that @xmath133 for @xmath91 . with larger @xmath0 ,",
    "the dynamics becomes extremely slower .",
    "the i - ii transition line belongs to the paradise phase , meaning that the system exhibits the same power - law decay dynamics .    as in eq .",

    "so there can be infinitely many absorbing states where each node has some unconnected links ( holes ) and the number of those holes is less than @xmath0 for all nodes .",
    "then , as there are no configurations satisfying the @xmath0-hole constraint at all nodes , a link creation attempt is impossible and the system is frozen dynamically .",
    "the hole density in such absorbing states should be proportional to @xmath175 or equivalently @xmath176 in this region ( @xmath177 ) , which is also confirmed numerically . in addition , there is a discontinuous jump in the hole density for finite systems across the i - ii transition line , due to the presence of this frozen dynamics in the paradise phase .     and ( b ) @xmath167 at @xmath163 and @xmath94 in the active phase ( @xmath178 ) . ]",
    "we now consider more realistic cases with the interaction term ( @xmath179 ) . in this case , each witness s degree of willingness in eq .",
    "( [ eq : xvi ] ) is enhanced if he has more friends than strangers among the other witnesses and vice versa .",
    "then , one may naively expect that the interaction drives a high link - density network to become a higher one , and a low link - density network to become a lower one .",
    "as a result , both the isolation phase and the paradise phase would expand into the active phase .",

    ", the interaction term may loosen the constraint for large @xmath0 and thus the naive picture can be restored . in fact , the @xmath0-hole constraint becomes loose for @xmath182 , when one of the witnesses without a link to the victim may take a higher degree of willingness than one with a link to the victim .",

    "the last line of @xmath242 is the boundary line between regions where the @xmath0-hole constraint is strictly valid and becomes loose .",
    "the divided regions are grouped into five phases including one new phase ( _ inactive ` mixed ' _ phase ) in the central region ( fig .",

    "the system reaches either the isolation phase or the paradise phase , depending on the initial conditions and the stochastic dynamics .",
    "this is similar to the absorbing phase belonging to the _ directed ising _ universality class  @xcite with two symmetric absorbing states .",
    "but , here , there is no symmetry between absorbing states .",
    "our main interest lies in the active phase and the surrounding inactive ( isolation and paradise ) phases . as expected , we find that the active phase shrinks due to the expansion of both inactive phases .",

    "the interaction term dominates and thus the paradise phase invades into the active phase . for @xmath244 where the @xmath0-hole constraint is loose , the active phase shrinks more and the i - ii phase boundary is given by the @xmath247 line .",
    "the hole density in the phase ii decays as @xmath248 with @xmath249 for @xmath243 and @xmath233 for @xmath244 . for general @xmath0",

    "generalization to higher @xmath0 is straightforward .",
    "near the i - iii boundary , we find @xmath109 , which holds for any @xmath0 .",
    "we investigate various bystander effects at the level of society / community for general @xmath0 , in relation to the empirical data analysis by social psychologists .",
    "our model is set up , based on the experimental results in the laboratory , but the specific values of control parameters can not be directly inferred from these results .",
    "we compare our model study with corresponding field studies  @xcite , in order to understand its social implications properly .",
    "the control parameters ( @xmath259 ) can be regarded as given or intrinsic to a society / community , hence depending on various factors of its socioeconomic condition and also on the taxonomy of helping behavior as well  @xcite . for the taxonomy of helping ,",
    "social psychologists introduced three independent dimensions : doing ( direct help ) versus giving ( indirect help ) , spontaneous versus planned , and serious versus nonserious .",
    "_ helping measures _ , such as helping rate , were observed from field studies performed in the streets of @xmath260 cities and towns in australia  @xcite and of @xmath261 cities in u.s .",
    "@xcite .",
    "for example , in one of experiments the experimenter walking on a street drops a pen accidentally in front of a solitary pedestrian , and continues walking , then sees whether the pedestrian picks the pen and bring it to the experimenter or simply ignores .",
    "the helping rate may correspond to the success rate in our model , which is defined as the number of successful interventions divided by the total number of interventions .",
    "in general the success rate is a monotonic function of the link density @xmath81 , i.e. the aggregate expectation of help in a community .",
    "therefore we can interpret @xmath81 as a helping measure of a community .",
    "the helping behavior in this experiment belongs to the direct , spontaneous , and nonserious type with a low potential cost ( small @xmath119 ) , while the rescue attempts in emergency situations are classified into the direct , spontaneous , and serious type with large @xmath119 .",
    "the socioeconomic factors ( _ community variables _ ) include the population size , population density , cost of living , unemployment rates , and etc .",
    "here the number of witnesses @xmath0 per accident corresponds to the population density ( crowdedness ) and the system size @xmath7 to the population size , respectively .",
    "while the population density and the population size are highly correlated in reality ( big cities are usually crowded ) , we considered them as being independent to each other for generality .",
    "the previous empirical studies showed that the most relevant factors for the helping rate are the population density and the population size .",
    "the strong negative correlation between the helping rate and the population density / size was found .",
    "this implies the normal bystander effect , i.e. @xmath81 decreasing with @xmath0 in our model .",
    "however , in some nonserious experiments , the helping rate first decreases and then increases as the population size ( or density ) increases  @xcite , and a slightly positive correlation between the helping rate and the population density was also found  @xcite .",
    "these unusual bystander effects can be supported by various behaviors of @xmath81 observed in our model study ( see below ) .",
    "the experiments in the field studies have been done for measuring the aggregate expectation of help in a given society , not for simulating our model dynamics .",
    "we assume that the helping network in the society has evolved by our model dynamics and has become already stationary at the time of the experiments . by comparing the experimental data with the stationary results of our model",
    ", one may check the validity of our coevolving helping network ( chn ) model and also predict some social features in real social systems .",
    "especially , we focus on the various bystander effects found in the field studies .",
    "now we discuss the @xmath0-dependent behavior of the link density @xmath81 , based on the numerical results for the chn model , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : rhokc ] . the behaviors can be categorized into three : ( i ) the _ normal _ bystander effect ( nbe ) , i.e. @xmath81 decreasing with @xmath0 , ( ii ) the _ reverse _ bystander effect ( rbe ) , i.e. @xmath81 increasing with @xmath0 , and ( iii ) the _ complex _ bystander effect ( cbe ) , i.e. @xmath81 decreasing and then increasing with @xmath0 .",
    "with @xmath180 fixed , for each value of @xmath183 , there appear two critical values of the potential cost @xmath119 , separating the three different be s .",
    "we observe the nbe phase for @xmath262 , the cbe phase for @xmath263 , and the rbe phase for @xmath264 , respectively .    to understand how the various be s appear as the potential cost @xmath119 varies",
    ", we first consider the simplest case of @xmath35 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : xvi ] ) . for large @xmath119 ,",
    "the possibility of successful intervention becomes small .",
    "this negative effect in the link density ( small @xmath81 ) is accelerated with @xmath0 , because the @xmath0-dependent interaction term becomes negative .",
    "therefore , we expect that @xmath81 decreases with @xmath0 ( nbe ) in the stationary state . for small @xmath119 , the tendency toward successful intervention is accelerated with @xmath0 in a positive way .",
    "so we expect the rbe .    to be more specific , the dynamics can be simplified by the mean field ( mf ) approximation of @xmath265 at @xmath35 : @xmath266-c,\\ ] ] then the stationarity condition yields @xmath267 with @xmath268 .",
    "one can easily see the nbe phase for @xmath269 , and the rbe phase for @xmath270 .",
    "numerical simulation results are consistent with this mf picture , except that @xmath271 .",
    "the positive @xmath183 enhances the possibility of selecting the witness @xmath3 connected to the victim @xmath272 as an intervener , and hence the @xmath0-hole constraint comes into play . the @xmath0-hole constraint , in general , suppresses the link density @xmath81 .",
    "so we expect that the nbe phase is not affected , because @xmath183 only accelerates the decay of @xmath81 with @xmath0 faster .    however , the rbe phase may be modified significantly in the region where the @xmath0-hole constraint becomes important . here , the interaction term proportional to @xmath20 competes with @xmath183 . for sufficiently large @xmath0",
    ", we may ignore @xmath183 compared to the interaction term , and then @xmath81 increases with @xmath0 .",
    "however , for small @xmath0 , the effect of positive @xmath183 becomes strong so the @xmath0-hole constraint may make @xmath81 to decrease with @xmath0 up to some value of @xmath0 .",
    "one may expect that this non - monotonic behavior of @xmath81 with @xmath0 ( cbe ) appears between the nbe and the rbe phase ( fig .",
    "[ fig : rhokc](d ) ) .",
    "note that there is a big jump in the phase boundary at @xmath242 .",
    "as discussed in the previous section , the @xmath0-hole constraint becomes loose for @xmath244 , and becomes strong for @xmath243 . as a result ,",
    "the link density decreases discontinuously as one crosses the @xmath242 point ( see , e.g. ,  fig .",
    "[ fig : rhosk3 ] ) .",
    "so it is easily expected that the nbe phase expands and the rbe phase shrinks . moreover",
    ", the rbe phase effectively disappears for @xmath243 , because it is almost squeezed down to the @xmath93 line where the paradise phase ( @xmath273 ) starts to appear .",
    "the complex and reverse bystander effects found in our model can support the unusual bystander effects found for the nonserious experiments ( small @xmath119 ) .",
    "moreover , when the relation between witnesses is more important than the witness - victim relation ( @xmath183 is smaller than @xmath180 ) , our model predicts that the cbe and the rbe are more commonly observed in nonserious experiments . to confirm the robustness of cbe and rbe in reality , more empirical / experimental studies are necessary",
    "we have studied how the collective helping behavior and bystander effects at the level of society emerge from the repeated helper - recipient interactions by means of the coevolving helping network model .",
    "its dynamic rules are based on the results of social psychological experiments . by analyzing the dynamics of the network link density ( aggregate expectation of help ) and its steady states and fluctuations , we present the full phase diagram with various active and inactive phases and explore the nature of phase transitions between them .",
    "close to the transition between the active and paradise phases , the critical behavior turns out to depend on the number of witnesses per accident @xmath0 .",
    "this is due to the link creation suppressed by the @xmath0-hole constraint , which also governs the algebraic decaying behavior in the paradise phase .",
    "we have numerically found various kinds ( normal , reverse , and complex ) of collective bystander effects for large @xmath0 and proposed the underlying mechanism .",
    "the normal and complex ( non - monotonic ) bystander effects are consistent with the field study results for the cases with serious and nonserious helping situations , respectively . in addition",
