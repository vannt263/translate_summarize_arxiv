    "we may give an alternative characterisation of parallelogram polyominoes in terms of non - intersecting paths in the plane .",
    "this alternative charaterisation will prove useful in defining the statistics and mappings used in the paper .",
    "consider a rectangular grid in @xmath38 of width @xmath3 and height @xmath4 . on this grid",
    "consider two paths , both starting from the southwest corner and arriving at the northeast corner , travelling on the grid , performing only north or east steps , with the further restriction that they touch each other only at the starting point and at the ending point .",
    "such a pair of paths uniquely defines a parallelogram polyomino .",
    "the region between the two paths is called the _ interior _ of the ( parallelogram ) polyomino .",
    "the two paths defining the parallelogram polyomino of figure [ fig1 ] are coloured in red and green , and the interior has been shadowed .     a parallelogram polyomino having a @xmath39 times @xmath40 bounding box . ]    in what follows we will encode a parallelogram polyomino as an _ area word _ consisting of natural numbers ( _ unbarred numbers _ ) and natural numbers with a bar on top ( _ barred numbers _ ) , in the following way .",
    "we will label every north step of the upper ( red ) path with a barred number , and every east step of the lower ( green ) path with an unbarred number .",
    "this is done in two stages .    first ,",
    "for each east step of the lower path we draw a line starting with the east endpoint and going northwest until reaching the upper path : we label this step with the number of squares crossed by this line .",
    "second , we label each north step of the upper path with the number of squares in the interior of the polyomino to the east of it which were not crossed by any of the lines that we drew during the previous stage .",
    "an example of this labelling is shown in figure [ fig2 ] , where we put a black dot in the non - crossed squares .",
    "the parallelogram polyomino of figure  [ fig1 ] with its perimeter labelled . ]",
    "once we have done this labelling , we read the labels in the following order : starting from southwest and going to northeast imagine moving a straight line of slope @xmath41 over the polyomino .",
    "when we encounter vertical steps of the upper path or horizontal steps of the lower path we write the corresponding labels .",
    "if we encounter both types of steps at the same time then we write the label of the upper path first .",
    "the area word of the example in figure [ fig2 ] is @xmath42 .",
    "notice that the sum of these numbers ( disregarding the bars ) gives the @xmath0 of the polyomino , which is the number of squares between the two paths .",
    "this is the first of the statistics that are relevant to us . in the example",
    "the @xmath0 is 30 .",
    "next we will define the @xmath2 statistic .",
    "consider the total order on the labels @xmath43 given a polyomino with area word @xmath44 , we define its @xmath2 as the number of pairs @xmath45 with @xmath46 and @xmath47 is the immediate successor of @xmath48 in the fixed order . in the example of figure [ fig2 ] , the number of such pairs containing @xmath49 is @xmath50 and",
    "the @xmath2 of the polyomino is 35 .",
    "the last statistic that we introduce is the @xmath1 . consider the following path in a given polyomino : begin with a single east step from the southwest corner , and then move north until reaching the east endpoint of a horizontal step of the upper path ; at this point we `` bounce '' , i.e. we start moving east , until we reach the north endpoint of a vertical step of the lower path ; at this point we `` bounce '' again , start moving north , and we repeat this procedure until we reach the northeast corner .",
    "this path is called the _ bounce path_.",
    "once we have the bounce path , starting from southwest corner , we label each step of the first sequence of vertical steps with @xmath51 , then each step of the second of such sequences with @xmath52 , and so on ; we label each step of the first sequence of horizontal steps with @xmath49 , then each step of the second of such sequences with @xmath53 , and so on .",
    "see figure [ fig3 ] for an example of this labelling .     the labelled bounce path . ]",
    "the @xmath1 of a polyomino is the sum of the labels of its bounce path , disregarding the bars .",
    "the @xmath1 of the parallelogram polyomino in figure [ fig3 ] is 41 .",
    "these three statistics give rise to a pair of bi - statistics on @xmath14 whose generating functions @xmath54 and @xmath55 are studied in this paper .",
    "the polynomials @xmath56 where first introduced in @xcite by two of the authors of the present work . in the same paper , it was conjectured that these were polynomials symmetric in @xmath8 and @xmath9 , and as expressions symmetric in @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "in this section we present a bijection @xmath57 between the set @xmath14 and a set of dyck paths having length @xmath58 .",
    "we then prove a result which shows how to read the area word of a parallelogram polyomino from its corresponding dyck path under @xmath57 . from this",
    "we will get a characterization of the area words of polyominoes from @xmath14 which will be used in the proof of theorem [ thm : adinba ] .",
    "we finally observe that this description provides a way to computationally work with the set of area words of @xmath14 by working with the easier to construct set of dyck paths .",
    "recall that a _",
    "dyck path _ can be thought of as a path consisting of northeast or southeast steps lying between parallel horizontal lines , such that the path starts with a northeast step , it never crosses the starting horizontal line , and returns to it at the end .",
    "its _ length _ is simply the number of its steps it contains .",
    "figure [ fig4 ] shows an example of a dyck path having length 38 .",
    "notice that a dyck path is uniquely determined by the sequence of rises and falls we encounter as we move along the path from left to right .",
    "we will next describe a bijection between the polyominos in @xmath14 and the set of dyck path of length @xmath58 with @xmath3 rises in even positions and @xmath4 rises in odd positions , which do not return to the starting horizontal line until the end .",
    "this bijection appears in @xcite in a somewhat different language .",
    "the idea is to read the steps of the upper and lower paths of a parallogram polyomino @xmath59 alternatingly and form the dyck path @xmath60 by using two rules .",
    "we perform a rise of the dyck path for either a north step of the upper path or an east step of the lower path , and perform a descent of the dyck path for either an east step of the upper path or a north step of the lower path . using this construction ,",
    "the polyomino in figure [ fig1 ] is sent to the dyck path shown in figure [ fig4 ] .",
    "the dyck path corresponding to the polyomino of figure [ fig1 ] . ]    it should be clear that this mapping sends the parallelogram polyomines to the stated subset of dyck paths . the fact that the dyck path does not return to the starting horizontal line before the end corresponds to the fact that the upper and the lower paths do not intersect each other between the starting and ending points .",
    "the inverse operation is straightforward to describe and verify .",
    "we can easily read the area word of a parallelogram polyomino @xmath59 from the corresponding dyck path @xmath61 as we will now describe .",
    "consider the dyck path in figure [ fig4 ] when reading the next proposition .",
    "it consists of northeast and southeast steps lying between parallel lines which determine certain rows .",
    "let @xmath62 with @xmath60 .",
    "if we label the rows of @xmath63 with @xmath64 from bottom to top , then reading the labels of the rows of the rises from left to right we get the area word of the polyomino @xmath59 .    to prove this proposition",
    ", we will use induction on the number of pairs of steps of the upper and lower paths starting form the southwest corner . at each step of this induction",
    "we will consider the _ partial box _ that includes the partial paths , i.e. the smallest rectangle that includes them ( see figure [ fig4_1 ] ) .",
    "then we imagine to complete the paths inside the partial box by moving along the edges to reach the northeast corner , and we read the labels of the resulting polyomino on the partial paths .     the highlighted area is the partial box after the first @xmath65 steps of both the green path and the red path . ]    we claim that this gives exactly the corresponding part of the area word of the original polyomino .",
    "the key observation is the following claim .    in the last pair of steps , the label of a north step of the upper path is always the distance from the right edge of the previous partial box , with a bar on top ; while the label of a east step of the lower path is always the distance from the upper edge of the partial box .    after proving this claim ,",
    "it remains only to observe that the distance from the right edge of the previous partial box of the north steps of the upper path corresponds to the number of odd rows from the bottom line in the corresponding dyck path ; while the distance from the upper edge of the partial box of the east steps of the lower path corresponds to the number of even rows from the bottom line .",
    "this completes the proof of the proposition .    at the beginning the upper path",
    "is forced to go north and the lower path is forced to go east .",
    "the partial box at this point consists of a single square , and we clearly have the partial area word @xmath66 : this is always the beginning of an area word for a polyonimo , and it corresponds to the first two rises in the corresponding dyck path , as it should be .",
    "now suppose that everything works up to a certain pair of steps , and let us make the next pair of steps .",
    "we have four cases ( see figure [ fig5 ] ) :     the four cases .",
    "the previous partial box is violet , while the new one is black . ]    : the upper path moves east , and the lower path moves north .",
    "then there are no labels to add , and the previous labels remain unchanged , since the partial box remains unchanged .    : both the upper and the lower paths move north",
    ". then the label of the north step of the upper path is clearly the distance from the right edge of the partial box , which is the same distance from the one of the previous partial box .",
    "the previous labels clearly remain unchanged .",
    ": both the upper and the lower paths move east",
    ". then the label of the east step of the lower path is the distance to the upper edge of the partial box .",
    "the previous labels of the upper path remain unchanged , since in each row we added just a box crossed by the diagonal corresponding to the new east step of the lower path .",
    "the previous labels of the lower path also remain unchanged , since we did not move the upper edge of the partial box .    :",
    "the upper path moves north , and the lower path moves east .",
    "then the label of the north step of the upper path is the distance from the right edge of the partial box minus 1 , since the first box becomes crossed by the diagonal of the east step of the lower path .",
    "but this is equal to the distance from the right edge of the previous partial box .",
    "the label of the east step of the lower path is clearly the distance from it to the upper edge of the partial box .",
    "the previous labels of the upper path remain unchanged , since in each row we added just a box crossed by the diagonal corresponding to the new east step of the lower path .",
    "the previous labels of the lower path also remain unchanged , since the diagonals of the previous horizontal steps all hit the upper path in the same spots as before .    as an immediate consequence",
    ", we get a characterization of the words in the ordered alphabet @xmath67 which are area words of elements of @xmath14 .",
    "we state this characterization here as a corollary .",
    "[ cor : charactareawords ] consider the alphabet @xmath67 , with the letters in the given order .",
    "a word @xmath68 in this alphabet is the area word of an element of @xmath14 if and only if the following conditions hold :    1 .",
    "@xmath69 , and this is the only @xmath49 that appears in the word ; 2 .",
    "there are exactly @xmath3 of the @xmath48 s which are from the set of numbers without a bar @xmath70 , and exactly @xmath4 of the @xmath48 s which are from the set of numbers with a bar @xmath71 ( in particular @xmath72 ) ; 3 .   for all @xmath73 ,",
    "the letter @xmath74 is less than or equal to the immediate successor of the letter @xmath48 , in the given order on the alphabet .",
    "we mention here that this bijection also gives an easy way to construct the polyomino from its area word : draw the corresponding dyck path ( this is immediate ) , and then look at the odd and even steps to construct the polyomino .",
    "this section is dedicated to proving the following theorem .    [ thm : adinba ] for all @xmath21 and @xmath22 , @xmath23    in order to prove this theorem it suffices to give a bijection from @xmath14 to @xmath36 which sends the bi - statistic @xmath5 to the bi - statistic @xmath37 .",
    "the bijection that we will now describe is similar in spirit to the one used in the proof of the analogous ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 3.15 ) .",
    "let @xmath62 .",
    "starting from @xmath59 , we read the labels of its bounce path , getting a word consisting of barred and unbarred numbers .",
    "then , starting from the bottom - left corner , for each turn of the bounce path , we look at the part of the path ( upper or lower ) that includes it . for example in the polyomino of figure [ fig3 ] , the first turn of the bounce path is between @xmath49 and the next @xmath51 in the labelling of the bounce path .",
    "the containing path consists of the first 4 steps ( counted from the southwest corner ) of the upper path .",
    "we label the vertical steps of the containing path with the labels used for the vertical steps in that part of the bounce path , and the horizontal steps of the containing path with the labels used for the horizontal steps in that part of the bounce path",
    ". see figure [ fig6 ] for an example .     the containing path and the new labels are blue .",
    "]    we then read the new labels by following the containing path from northeast down to southwest . in the example we read @xmath75 .    during the remainder of the construction",
    "we will preserve the relative positions of these labels .",
    "we then repeat the algorithm with the second turn of the bounce path of @xmath59 . in the example this occurs between the last @xmath51 and the first @xmath53 in the bounce path .",
    "this time the containing path consists of the steps of the lower path between the second and the eighth .",
    "we repeat the procedure that we used before , and the word that we get reading the new labels will prescribe the relative positions of the @xmath51 s and the @xmath53 s . in the example ( see figure [ fig7 ] ) we get the prescriptions @xmath76 .",
    "this together with the other prescription gives a partial word @xmath77 .",
    "in general we will construct this partial word in a way that it can be the word of a parallelogram polyomino while respecting all the prescriptions .",
    "this will always be possible since the first step of the containing path that we read will always be labelled by the smallest of the two types of labels that we are considering : this is due to the definition of the bounce path .     the containing path and the new labels are violet . ]",
    "we keep doing this until all the labels of the bounce path of @xmath59 have been included . at the end",
    "we will get a word of another parallelogram polyomino . in the example , at the next step we get the prescriptions @xmath78 , which gives the partial word @xmath79 ; then we get the prescriptions @xmath80 , which gives the partial word @xmath81 ; then we get the prescriptions @xmath82 , which gives the partial word @xmath83 ; then we get the prescriptions @xmath84 , which gives the partial word @xmath85 ; then we get the prescriptions @xmath86 , which gives the partial word @xmath87 ; and finally we get the prescriptions @xmath88 , which gives the final word @xmath89 .",
    "it is clear from the construction and the characterization of corollary [ cor : charactareawords ] , that in this way we get the area word of a polyomino @xmath90 in @xmath36 .",
    "moreover @xmath90 clearly has @xmath0 equal to the @xmath1 of the original polyomino @xmath59 , again by construction .",
    "figure [ fig8 ] illustrates @xmath90 for when @xmath59 is the polyomino of figure [ fig1 ] .",
    "the outcome of applying @xmath91 to the polyomino of figure [ fig1 ] . ]    we need to show that the @xmath2 of @xmath90 is equal to the @xmath0 of @xmath59 .    to see this , recall how we constructed the word of the new polyomino : for consecutive types of labels , we prescribed the relative positions by reading the corresponding containing path . but in the containing path , those pairs of vertical and horizontal steps which contribute to the @xmath2 of the polyomino correspond each to a square in its area .",
    "it remains to show that @xmath91 is a bijection . to see this",
    ", we can consider the inverse function : given a parallelogram polyomino , write in weakly increasing order its area word , and draw it as a bounce path with labels .",
    "then reading the relative positions of consecutive types of labels you can reconstruct piecewise both the upper and lower paths .",
    "this completes the proof .",
    "let us observe some remarkable consequences of this result .",
    "first of all , notice that iterating this bijection a second time , we get a bijection @xmath92 from @xmath14 to itself which sends @xmath1 to @xmath2 .",
    "moreover , applying the inverse and composing it with the flip along the southwest to northeast line that pass through the southwest corner ( which obviously preserves the @xmath0 ) we get a bijection from @xmath14 to itself which sends @xmath2 to @xmath0 .    in conclusion",
    ", we see that all our three statistics are equidistributed both inside the same @xmath3 times @xmath4 rectangle and with the polyominoes in the flipped @xmath4 times @xmath3 rectangle .",
    "in this section we prove that both @xmath56 and @xmath93 satisfy a certain recursion . as an immediate byproduct",

    "given two disjoint sequences of numbers @xmath189 and @xmath190 , we denote by @xmath191 the set of _ shuffles _ of @xmath189 and @xmath190 , i.e. the sequences consisting of the numbers from @xmath192 in which all the elements of @xmath189 and @xmath190 appear in their original order , so that @xmath193 .    for any @xmath16 and @xmath17 in @xmath194 , we call @xmath195 the set of parking functions @xmath166 of size @xmath196 such that @xmath197 . finally , we set @xmath198 we may state now the result of haglund ( see @xcite for a proof , and @xcite for the necessary background ) .",

    "the sum of all these polynomials as @xmath96 and @xmath97 range over their possible values is equal to @xmath212 . with this new generalization in mind",
    ", it is clear that equation [ newequiv ] holds true if @xmath213 our proof of this identity is similar to what haglund did in @xcite .",
    "we will show that @xmath214 also satisfies the recursion in theorem [ thm : recursion ] , with the 4-tuple @xmath215 replaced with @xmath216 , i.e. @xmath217 & = t^{n+m-1}q^{s+1}\\sum_{k=1}^{m - s-1}\\sum_{h=0}^{n - r-1 } q^r { r+s \\brack r}_q { r+k-1 \\brack k}_q ( qt)^{m+n - r - s-2}\\mathsf{para}_{n - r-1,m - s-2}^{(h , k-1)}(q , t),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which simplifies to @xmath218 the initial conditions are @xmath219 and @xmath220    in order to see how the recursion [ eq : pfrecursion ] works for parking functions , we first make a simplification .",
    "it follows immediately from the definitions that , since the reading word of the parking functions we are interested in is a shuffle of the sequences @xmath207 and @xmath221 , the pairs of dominoes with both upper numbers in @xmath189 or both in @xmath190 do not contribute to the dinv .",
    "the only pairs that contribute are the ones where one of the upper numbers is in @xmath189 and the other is in @xmath190 . since all the elements of @xmath189 are smaller than all the elements of @xmath190 , we can simply consider dominoes in which the upper number is @xmath51 ( if the corresponding element was in @xmath189 ) or @xmath52 ( if the corresponding element was in @xmath190 ) , with the dinv defined in the same way .    for example",
    "the parking function @xmath222 @xmath223 whose reading word is @xmath224 would correspond to @xmath225 whose reading word is @xmath226 in both cases the dinv is @xmath227 , and the area is @xmath228 .",
    "* _ using this identification _ * , what we do is the following : given an element @xmath166 of @xmath204 , we remove the dominoes whose lower number is @xmath132 , and we decrease the lower number of the remaining dominoes by @xmath51 , keeping them in the given order .    in our example , applying this procedure to @xmath166 we get @xmath229 in doing this , observe that we will always get a parking function which starts with a domino @xmath230 , which is always followed by a domino with lower entry @xmath132 , since @xmath166 can not contain a sequence of three consecutive dominoes with strictly increasing lower numbers .",
    "this first domino contributes @xmath132 to both area and dinv and we can therefore remove it . in doing this",
    "we get an element of @xmath231 , where @xmath129 is the number of @xmath232 dominoes in @xmath166 , and @xmath30 is the number of @xmath233 dominoes in @xmath166 .    conversely , given an element of @xmath231 , we can prepend it with a @xmath230 domino , increase all the lower numbers by 1 , and then insert @xmath96 @xmath234 dominoes and @xmath97 @xmath230 dominoes .",
    "this gives us an element of @xmath204 .",
    "in doing so , we are forced to put a @xmath234 in front of the first @xmath233 which we just prepended .",
    "other inserted dominoes must satisfy the following constraints : a @xmath234 domino is followed by a domino in @xmath235 , if any , and a @xmath230 domino is followed by a domino in @xmath236 , if any .",
    "let us now look at how the area and the dinv change with respect to the operation that we have just described .",
    "the area of the new parking function is equal to the area of @xmath166 minus @xmath237 , which is taken care of by the factor @xmath238 on the right hand side of .",
    "the dinv is going to be the dinv of @xmath166 minus the dinv created by the dominoes that we have removed .",
    "first of all , there are the pairs of dominoes @xmath230 and @xmath234 in @xmath166 , whose relative position creates dinv : this dinv is taken care of by the factor @xmath239 on the right hand side of . then there is the dinv created by the dominoes @xmath233 in @xmath166 with the dominoes @xmath234 in @xmath166 : this is taken care by the factor @xmath240 , since the first domino @xmath233 is necessarily preceded by a @xmath234 .",
