    "in recent experiments and numerical simulations it has been found that significant transport might be mediated by coherent structures such as streamers , blobs and vortices through the formation of rare avalanche - like events of large amplitude @xcite .",
    "these events cause the probability distribution function ( pdf ) to deviate from a gaussian profile on which the traditional mean field theory such as transport coefficients is based .",
    "specifically , the pdf tails manifest the intermittent character of transport due to rare events of large amplitude that are often found to substantially differ from gaussian distribution , although pdf centres tend to be gaussian .",
    "therefore , a comprehensive predictive theory is called for in order to understand and subsequently improve intermittent transport features e.g. confinement degradation in tokamaks .",

    ", zonal flows play an important role in fusion plasmas @xcite .    in geophysical fluid dynamics , zonal flows",
    "are believed to cause a similar reduction in transport in atmospheres @xcite under certain limiting conditions @xcite .",
    "this comes as no surprise , given the analogy between drift waves in the dissipationless limit and rossby waves in nearly incompressible , shallow rotating fluids ; both systems are described by the charney - hasegawa - mima ( chm ) equation @xcite .    numerical studies where sheared flow is externally prescribed @xcite lead to energetics that are qualitatively different from those obtained in the drift - wave / zonal - flow feedback mechanism @xcite . in the chm model @xcite sheared flow may be imposed by prescribing the background density gradient @xcite .",
    "the known solutions of the chm equation , namely bipolar and monopolar vortices @xcite , form in the plasma . here",
    "the term vortex is used to describe a localized extremum in the electrostatic potential that is evolved through the chm equation . in this",
    "paper fluid simulations using the chm equation are designed so that zonal flows    are prescribed externally ,    moving in the poloidal direction and with various configurations in the radial direction . at initialisation bipolar vortices form , but only monopolar vortices survive due to the interaction between vortices as well as the destructive effects of the sheared flow @xcite .",
    "the fluid simulations produce quasi - stationary time series ( poloidally averaged and sampled at different radial points ) of the electrostatic potential and corresponding vorticity that describe the chm flows @xcite .",
    "we apply a standard box - jenkins modeling for each time series .",
    "this mathematical procedure effectively removes deterministic autocorrelations from the time series , allowing for the statistical interpretation of the stochastic residual part . in this particular case",
    "it turns out that an arima(3,1,0 ) model ( autoregressive integrated moving average ) @xcite accurately describes the stochastic process .",
    "the stochastic residual of the time series of potential and vorticity exhibit gaussian statistics or distributions with elevated exponential tails .",
    "we utilize analytical results from nonperturbative stochastic theory , the so - called instanton method @xcite for computing pdfs in turbulence as a comparison to the numerical data .",
    "the analytically derived pdfs are rather insensitive to the details of the linear physics of the system @xcite and thus display salient features of the nonlinear interactions .",
    "the numerically generated time traces are analysed using the arima model and fitted with the analytical models accordingly .",
    "we find in the regions with strong nonlinear characteristics an emergent universal scaling of the pdf tails of exponential form @xmath0 as suggested by recent theoretical work in ref .",
    "relevant for the direct cascade dynamics .",
    "however , in many cases for the chm zonal flows we find gaussian pdfs in similarity to what was seen from the theoretical model in ref . , whereas for some mid radial points the system exhibit sub - exponential pdfs @xmath1 with @xmath2 , where the dynamics is strongly influenced by the zonal flow resulting in strong intermittency .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : section [ sec : chm ] introduces the chm model and section [ sec : level3 ] the statistical method used in the analysis .",
    "the numerical results are presented in section [ sec : results ] after which they are discussed and the paper is concluded by a summary of the main results .",

    "the plane is periodic in the @xmath5 direction and finite in the @xmath4 direction .",

    "the characteristic length is the thermal larmor radius @xmath18 and the characteristic time is taken as @xmath19 .",
    "equation ( [ eq : chm ] ) has two global invariants : the generalised energy @xmath20 and the generalised enstrophy @xmath21 .",
    "a second - order modified euler predictor - corrector time scheme is used to solve equation ( [ eq : chm ] ) .",
    "the periodic @xmath5 direction is treated spectrally while the @xmath4 direction as well as the nonlinearity of equation ( [ eq : chm ] ) are finite differenced @xcite .",
    "the chm equation s nonlinear term is calculated using a conservative scheme for vector nonlinearities @xcite .",
    "the @xmath4 boundary conditions are fixed with @xmath22 at all time .",

    "the chm equation produces a solution containing many pairs of bipolar vortices that evolve into larger monopolar vortices , the latter existing for most of the numerical run . in order to do a statistical analysis on these fluctuations , time series of the algebraic averages in the poloidal ( @xmath5 ) direction of the normalised electrostatic potential @xmath24 and normalised vorticity @xmath25",
    "are obtained at positions along the radial ( @xmath4 ) axis , denoted as @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "the normalised vorticity is obtained using @xmath28",
    "in this paragraph we will quantify the intermittency in the simulated time series by computing the pdfs of the residuals or the stochastic component of the time traces and compare these with analytical predictions . here",
    ", we briefly outline the implementation of the instanton method . for more details ,",
    "the reader is referred to the existing literature @xcite . in the instanton method",
    "the pdf tail is first formally expressed in terms of a path integral by utilizing the gaussian statistics of the forcing , in a similar spirit as in refs . .",
    "here and throughout this paper , the term forcing is meant to describe the inherent unpredictability of the dynamics and will be assumed to be gaussian for simplicity .",
    "a general class of solutions is presented in ref . .",
    "the integral in the action ( @xmath29 ) in the path integral is evaluated using the saddle - point method in the limit @xmath30 representing the tail values .",
    "the parameter @xmath31 is proportional to some power of the quantity of interest such as the potential or flux . in mathematical terms",
    ", this corresponds to evaluating the integral along an optimum path among all possible paths or functional values .",
    "the instanton is localized in time , existing during the formation of coherent structure .",
    "the saddle - point solution of the dynamical variable @xmath32 of the form @xmath33 is called an instanton if @xmath34 at @xmath35 and @xmath36 at @xmath37 .",
    "note that , the function @xmath38 here represents the spatial form of the coherent structure .",
    "thus , the intermittent character of the transport consisting of bursty events can be described by the creation of the coherent structures . the dynamical system with a stochastic forcing is enforced to be satisfied by introducing a larger state space involving a conjugate variable @xmath39 ,",
    "whereby @xmath6 and @xmath39 constitute an uncertainty relation . furthermore , @xmath39 acts as a mediator between the observables ( potential or vorticity ) and instantons ( physical variables ) through stochastic forcing . based on the assumption that the total pdf can be characterized by an exponential form and that it is symmetric around the mean value @xmath40 ,",
    "the expression @xmath41 is found , where the potential @xmath6 plays the role of the stochastic variable , with @xmath42 determining its statistical properties .",
    "here @xmath43 is a constant containing the physical properties of the system . using the instanton method",
    "we find different statistics in different situations . in a vorticity conserving system the intermittent properties of the time series in simulations are attributed to rare events of modon like structures that have a simplified response for the vorticity , @xmath44    here @xmath45 and the vortex speed is @xmath21 .",
    "in this situation it has been predicted @xcite that the system has exponential tails in the direct cascade , @xmath46 , indicating a value of @xmath47 as in ref . .",
    "in the references the statistics of the momentum flux is found to be a stretched exponential with @xmath48 . however , when the nonlinear interactions are weak , as well as in the case of an imposed zonal flow we find gaussian statistics where @xmath49 as is elucidated on in ref . .",
    "in the analysis we will make use of different types of distributions to retro - fit the pdfs of simulation results mainly using the laplace distribution ( @xmath50 ) and the gaussian distribution ( @xmath51 ) .",
    "we focus on the time traces ( averaged in the @xmath5-direction ) at five equidistant radial points located at @xmath52 ( in units of @xmath53 ) .",
    "each set of data describes the time evolution of the potential and vorticity to which we apply a standard box - jenkins modeling  @xcite .",
    "this mathematical procedure effectively removes deterministic autocorrelations from the system , allowing for the statistical interpretation of the residual part , which a posteriori turns out to be relevant for comparison with the analytical theory . in our set - up ,",
    "it turns out that an arima(3,1,0 ) model accurately describes the stochastic procedure , in that , one can express the ( differenced ) potential time trace in the form @xmath54 where the fitted coefficients @xmath55 describe the deterministic component and @xmath56 is the residual part ( noise or stochastic component ) . in the time",
    "traces the mean values differ by several orders of magnitude and a convenient way of starting the comparison between different cases is to apply rescaling of the data . in the rescaling procedure",
    "we multiply the original time trace with a constant factor , thus the mean and variance values are directly affected .",
    "however , the skewness and kurtosis are kept constant by construction .",
    "the benefits gained from rescaling are that we may compare a large number of different cases at different radial points and that the tails are retained and the arima model is preserved , thus in this sense the original and rescaled data is statistically equivalent .",
    "the original simulation data sets are down - sampled and consists of typically @xmath57 entries .",
    "in this section the numerical results from all the different stream configurations are presented in tandem with the statistical analysis .    throughout the paper",

    "in this paper simulations of unforced charney - hasegawa - mima ( chm ) flows have been performed where we have imposed constant background density profiles on the chm equation . in this manner",
    "we generated a single zonal flow , anti - parallel flows with slow and fast moving plasma adjacent to each other , as well as parallel and anti - parallel flows with a space between the flow streams .",
    "in the single flow stream a chain of monopolar vortices form along the stream with their widths determined by the stream width and with polarities opposite from their neighbours .",

    "after initialisation bipolar vortices form that merge and destroy each other until only monopolar vortices survive , which leads to enstrophy changes during the initial phase .",
    "the amplitudes of the vortices also change to a stable value during this phase , hence an initial change in energy .",
    "once the initial phase is over , the energy and enstrophy conservation is good for the one stream . in the case of the two stream scenarios the energy and enstrophy",
    "are conserved to a lesser extent in some numerical runs and to a larger extent in others .",
    "this is because vortices keep on being created and destroyed as they interact in a random manner with each other and the sheared flow .",
    "we have sampled time series at points in the radial direction ( poloidally averaged ) of the electrostatic potential and corresponding vorticity generated by the simulations .",
    "our aim is to evaluate the intermittent characteristics of the time series by using a standard box - jenkins modeling .",
    "this mathematical procedure effectively removes deterministic autocorrelations from the time series , allowing for the statistical interpretation of the stochastic residual part .",
    "the numerically generated time traces are compared with predictions from a nonperturbative theory , the so - called instanton method for computing probability density functions ( pdfs ) in turbulence .",
    "more specifically the numerically generated time traces are analysed using the arima model and fitted with analytical models accordingly . in the simulations presented here we find that an arima(3,1,0 ) model presents an adequate description of the stochastic process .",
    "the time series of the arima modeled stochastic residual of cases described in section [ sec : results ] ( a , b , c ) of the potential and vorticity exhibit in general a uni - modal pdf with gaussian features or a pdf with exponential tails . in summary",
    ", the pdf @xmath86 with @xmath87 or exponential statistics are found with ( @xmath50 ) .",
    "the different configurations are represented by an imposed slow and a fast zonal flow as well as parallel and anti - parallel flows .",
    "the rationale for using the arima model is to uncover the stochastic process hidden in the numerically generated time trace .",
    "the arima process is specifically designed to identify correlations in a time trace by utilizing a differencing procedure and thus provides us with an efficient model how to subtract the correlations in time from the full signal .",
    "the objective of this work is to identify the particular stochastic process that is generating the time trace .",
    "the one important restriction of this procedure is that the stochastic process has to be stationary with respect to the mean and variance . for an arbitrary stochastic process , there exist formal tests to check whether stationarity holds . in this particular example of",
    "chm zonal flows with a constant background density profile generating the process , this is fulfilled except for a short interval at the start of the simulation .",
    "one non - trivial aspect of the statistics of the electrostatic potential in the chm system is conservation of energy and enstrophy that may lead to a gibbsian equilibrium distribution .",
    "however with the imposed shear flow through the varying density gradient , non - vanishing triad interactions redistribute energy between the modes , contributing to a situation where the pdfs deviate from the gaussian form at some radial locations . for a general discussion",
    "see krommes@xcite .",
    "the cascade processes or redistribution energy and enstrophy can also be directly seen in the simulations as deviations in the conserved quantities .    to this end ,",
    "in general we find an emergent universal exponential scaling of the distribution functions ( laplace distribution with @xmath50 ) that accurately describes the statistics of the time series of the electric potential and vorticity .",
    "analysing the profiles along the @xmath4 coordinate of the kurtosis of the potential and vorticity time series we find striking similarity suggestive of the relation in eq .",
    "( [ modrel ] ) .",
    "exceptions to the named distributions occur where strong nonlinear interactions are present in the dynamics where the pdfs are sub - exponential with @xmath88 and high values of the normalized fourth moment ( kurtosis ) is found .",
