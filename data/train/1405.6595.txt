    "elliptic flow , @xmath0 , is a crucial observable of heavy - ion collisions : the large magnitude of @xmath0 at rhic  @xcite and lhc  @xcite provides the strongest evidence that a low - viscosity fluid is formed in these collisions  @xcite .",
    "elliptic flow is determined to a good approximation by linear response to the initial eccentricity @xmath1 , which quantifies the spatial azimuthal anisotropy of the fireball created right after the collision  @xcite .",
    "this initial eccentricity comes from two effects : first , the overlap area between the colliding nuclei has the shape of an almond in non - central collisions , where the smaller dimension of the almond is parallel to the reaction plane .",
    "this results in an eccentricity which becomes larger as impact parameter increases , and whose magnitude is model dependent  @xcite .",
    "second , even in central collisions , there is a sizable eccentricity due to quantum fluctuations in wave functions of incoming nuclei  @xcite , and to the probabilistic nature of energy deposition in nucleon - nucleon collisions .",
    "the magnitude of these eccentricity fluctuations is again a model - dependent issue , which involves the dynamics of the collision at early times  @xcite .",
    "the goal of this paper is to show that the distribution of the initial eccentricity is to some extent independent of model details .",
    "more precisely , it can be written to a good approximation as a universal function of two parameters , where one of the parameters corresponds to the reaction plane eccentricity , and the other parameter characterizes the magnitude of fluctuations .",
    "information on the initial state is thus encoded in two numbers .",
    "the initial eccentricity @xmath1 is defined in every event from the initial energy density profile ( see below sec .  [",
    "sec : ellipticpower ] ) and thus carries information about how energy is deposited in the early stages of the collision .",
    "there are several models of the initial density profile and its fluctuations , which are typically implemented through monte carlo simulations .",
    "the monte carlo glauber model is used in many event - by - event hydrodynamic calculations  @xcite : in this model , one assumes that the energy is localized around each wounded nucleon .",
    "other monte carlo models of the initial state are inspired by saturation physics  @xcite and have also been used as initial conditions in hydrodynamic calculations  @xcite .",
    "another approach is to use an event generator from particle physics  @xcite or a transport calculation  @xcite to model the initial dynamics .",
    "each monte carlo model returns a probability distribution for @xmath1 at a given centrality .",
    "a simple parametrization of the distribution of @xmath1 , usually referred to as the bessel - gaussian distribution  @xcite , was proposed in  @xcite .",
    "it works well for nucleus - nucleus collisions at moderate impact parameters , but fails for more peripheral collisions and/or small systems such as proton - nucleus collisions .",
    "the reason why it fails can be traced back to the fact that it does not take into account the fact that , by definition , @xmath2 in every event .",
    "a new power distribution was recently introduced  @xcite which well describes eccentricity distributions when there are only flow fluctuations ( see also @xcite ) , and satisfies @xmath2 by construction . in sec .",
    "[ sec : ellipticpower ] , we propose a generalization of this result : we take into account the eccentricity in the reaction plane by distorting the power distribution into an elliptic power distribution .",
    "this new , two - parameter distribution reduces to the power distribution for an azimuthally - symmetric system . in sec .",
    "[ sec : mcmodels ] , we use the elliptic power distribution to fit the distribution of @xmath1 in pb+pb collisions calculated by monte carlo methods for several models and for all centralities .",
    "we also show that the elliptic power distribution reproduces the magnitude of eccentricity fluctuations , and the cumulants of the distribution of @xmath1 .",
    "the initial anisotropy in harmonic @xmath3 is defined in every event by  @xcite @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the energy density near midrapidity shortly after the collision , and @xmath6 are polar coordinates in the transverse plane , in a centered coordinate system , where @xmath7 is the orientation of the reaction plane . in most of this paper ,",
    "we focus on the second harmonic @xmath8 .",
    "@xmath1 is often referred to as the `` participant eccentricity '' and @xmath9 as the `` participant plane '' .",
    "this terminology refers to monte carlo glauber models  @xcite , in the context of which these concepts were first introduced  @xcite .",

    "( [ defepsilon ] ) implies @xmath14 , which in turn implies @xmath15 : the participant plane coincides with the reaction plane .",
    "this is no longer true in the presence of fluctuations .",
    "figure  [ 2d ] ( a ) displays the distribution of @xmath16 , for @xmath8 , obtained in a monte carlo glauber simulation of pb+pb collisions in the 75 - 80% centrality range . in this simulation , centrality is defined according the to number of participants .",
    "the maximum of the distribution is at a positive value of @xmath12 , reflecting the large reaction plane eccentricity .",
    "fluctuations around the most probable value are large .",
    "they display characteristic features :    1 .",
    "the width around the maximum is larger along the @xmath17 axis than along the @xmath18 axis .",
    "the distribution of @xmath12 is left skewed with a steeper decrease to the right of the maximum toward a cut - off at @xmath19 .",
    "the usual bessel - gaussian parametrization  @xcite assumes that fluctuations are gaussian and isotropic and therefore misses both features ( see fig .",
    "[ 2d ] ( c ) ) .",
    "these features can be traced back to the constraint that the support of the distribution is the unit disk @xmath20 .",
    "our goal in this paper is to derive a generic distribution with these features .      in ref .",
    "@xcite , an exact expression for the distribution of @xmath16 for @xmath8 was derived under the following assumptions :    * the energy profile is a superposition of @xmath21 pointlike , identical sources : @xmath22 , where @xmath23 denotes the transverse position of the sources . *",

    "we treat both the _ ellipticity _ @xmath30 and the _ power _ @xmath31 as fit parameters . in particular , we allow for arbitrary real , positive values of @xmath31 ( as opposed to integer or half - integer ) .    for @xmath32 , the distribution eq .",
