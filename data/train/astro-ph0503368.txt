    "in the present appendix we will describe the procedure to obtain the exact result for the acceleration caused by a distribution of matter in a infinitely thin ring going from @xmath27 ua to @xmath31 ua with a surface density distribution : @xmath62 .",
    "the method is straightforward , using newton s law of gravitation , we calculate the acceleration caused by the distribution of matter on a test particle ; the case of interest for us , is only when the position of the test particle ( the pioneers ) is on the plane of the disk , therefore we need only two dimensions to do the calculations .        where @xmath67 is the surface density of the mass element .",
    "then all we have to do is to sum the contribution of all the mass elements in the ring .",
    "to do so , we use the following simplifications : if we assume that @xmath68 , then the symmetry of the problem allow us to put , choosing a cartesian coordinate system , @xmath69 and @xmath70 , where @xmath71 and @xmath72 are the coordinates of the mass element @xmath63 in polar coordinates . the total contribution to",
    "the acceleration in the direction of @xmath73 is zero given the symmetry of the ring ; for the component in the direction @xmath74 the integral over the whole distribution ( @xmath75 going from @xmath76 to @xmath77 and @xmath71 going from @xmath33 to @xmath78 ) gives the radial acceleration caused on the test particle as a function of it s radial position . to perform these calculations we made a numerical program in fortran 77 .",
    "the resulting acceleration as a function of the position @xmath22 of the test particle , appears in fig .",

    "<S> in this work we study the gravitational influence of the material extending from uranus orbit to the kuiper belt and beyond on objects moving within these regions . </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that a density distribution given by @xmath0 ( for @xmath1 ) generates a constant acceleration towards the sun on those objects , which , with the proper amount of mass , accounts for the blue shift detected on the pioneers space crafts . </S>",
    "<S> we also discuss the effect of this gravitational pull on neptune , and comment on the possible origin of such a matter distribution .    </S>",
    "<S> mankind is now in direct contact with regions beyond the solar system . </S>",
    "<S> the space probes launched in the @xmath2 already passed the orbit of the last solar system planet , pluto , and are still working ! </S>",
    "<S> it is really a homage for their designers . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , the pioneer probes 10 and 11 were designed in such a cunning way that their position , via the doppler effect , can be determined with great accuracy ( the tracking system have the sensitivity to measure frequency changes at the level of @xmath3/s , @xcite ) .    when these probes were still within the solar system , at 20 ua , that is , between uranus , which has a mean distance from the sun of 19.13 ua , and neptune , at 30 ua , the frequency received at earth start showing an unaccounted effect , a blue shift that is usually interpreted as a constant acceleration with a magnitude of a=8.741.3310 ^ -8 , [ pioneer]and directed towards the sun @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the cause for such a blue shift was unknown but more remarkable was the fact that such phenomenon kept being present . in figure 1 , we show a diagram of the solar system showing the pioneers trajectories and positions . </S>",
    "<S> this figure is a reproduction taken from the original at @xcite .     </S>",
    "<S> the pioneers trajectories in the solar system @xcite.,width=264 ]    there have been a number of possible explanations for the cause of the blue shift , and there is now an important number of works that discard any internal effect of the probes as the cause , such as heat reflected off the probes and possible gas leaks , ( see @xcite , @xcite and @xcite ) , implying that it is due to an external cause . </S>",
    "<S> now the pioneers are farther than @xmath4 ua , well beyond pluto s orbit , @xmath5 ua , and the effect is still there . </S>",
    "<S> following occam s razor , the simplest explanation is that a * constant * force , independent of the distance , is producing the measured blue shift .    in this way , the facts are that our first encounter with the external regions of the solar system and beyond are showing the presence of something out there which affects the motion of bodies . </S>",
    "<S> it is interesting to mention that this effect started clearly as the probes passed uranus orbit , still within the solar system , and it has not being observed , so far , in the trajectories of the planets in that region , neptune and pluto .    </S>",
    "<S> any number of explanations have being put forward to account for this effect , including dark energy ( see for example @xcite ) , quantum oscillations of the spacetime , branes ( @xcite ) and you name it . </S>",
    "<S> ( for other interesting alternatives see @xcite , @xcite and @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> our point of view is try first to explain the phenomenon with local , everyday physics , and if this is not enough , then use other alternatives . also , it is clear that dark energy contribution to the motion of bodies at local scales is very much smaller than the one detected at the pioneers trajectories . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , the effects of dark energy start to being noticeable only at galaxy cluster scales ! ( see , for instance , @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> however , it is remarkable that , taking the accepted value for the cosmological constant , considering it as the source of the dark energy , @xmath6 , with @xmath7 , the ratio of dark energy density to the critical density of the universe , @xmath8 the hubble constant today ( we take @xmath9 @xcite ) , and @xmath10 the speed of light , we get @xmath11 , and if we want to construct an acceleration associated with it , we obtain that @xmath12 , a value close to the one observed on the pioneers @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , as mentioned , the cosmological effects are negligible at solar systems scales , so this is just a remarkable coincidence .    in the present work we develop a more local and common idea . </S>",
    "<S> the solar system started from the proto - planetary cloud which , by gravitational collapse , formed the sun and planets but some material remained in the form of small structures , tiny rocks , and dust , revolving around the sun , forming belts . </S>",
    "<S> those tiny rocks within the orbits of the planets , were ultimately swept by them , and the ones beyond form belts , two mayor regions beyond neptune s orbit : the kuiper belt , going from @xmath13 ua to @xmath4 ua , where it joints with the ort cloud , which extends up to 4000 ua @xcite , and internal belts within the orbits of the four major external planets . </S>",
    "<S> we study the gravitational pull generated by those belts on the objects moving within them and conclude that , if their density distribution goes as @xmath14 , a constant acceleration pull is produced , directed towards the center , which could account for the observed blue shift on the pioneer probes .    as an illustration , </S>",
    "<S> let s take the simplest case of a solid spherical distribution of matter , an object moving within a media of a given density distribution @xmath15 , will be accelerated according to the following newtonian law : = -4 g ( ) , with @xmath16 the gravitational constant , @xmath17 , and @xmath18 the acceleration of the object . </S>",
    "<S> thus , _ </S>",
    "<S> sda=-4g_v()d^3r , with @xmath19 the normal vector to the surrounding surface to the volume @xmath20 . </S>",
    "<S> considering that the acceleration is only radial : @xmath21 , and taking a spherical shell of radius @xmath22 , as the surface of integration , we get a_p=-4g_0^r(r)r^2dr , [ eq : a_p]from which is clear that , in order to have a constant acceleration , the density on the media must go as : ( r)=[eq : rho ] moreover , we can compute the proportionality constant @xmath23 , from the observed value of the pioneers acceleration ; obtaining that : = = 0.21 and then , the density of the sphere needed to produce such an acceleration is , for example at @xmath24 ua where it s claimed that the anomaly starts : @xmath25 . however , this solid sphere is not the answer to the problem because it starts form @xmath26 , i.e. from the sun , and the anomaly does nt appear until @xmath24 ua . the next possibility is a spherical shell starting at @xmath24 ua with the same density distribution as in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : rho ] ) . in this case </S>",
    "<S> the acceleration within the shell is not constant : for the region inside @xmath24 ua the acceleration is zero , for the region inside the shell , we can calculate the acceleration by taking the difference between the influence of two spheres centered in the sun ; the smaller one with a radius @xmath27 ua and a mass @xmath28 produces a radial acceleration in a test particle located at @xmath29 given by : a_1=-=- the bigger sphere with radius @xmath22 produces an acceleration whose magnitude is given by eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : a_p ] ) : @xmath30 ; therefore , the acceleration inside the shell for a test particle is : a_p=-2g(1- ) .     </S>",
    "<S> deacceleration caused in a test particle located at @xmath22 due to a spherical shell starting from @xmath27 ua to @xmath31 ua , the acceleration is in units of @xmath32.,width=188 ]    for this case the resulting acceleration is not independent of the radius but as @xmath22 gets larger compared to @xmath33 the acceleration approaches a constant value . </S>",
    "<S> if we fix this value to eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ pioneer ] ) , then the value of @xmath23 and @xmath34 are the same as in the case of the solid sphere . even when the acceleration is not constant within the sphere , this case ca nt be discarded because of the uncertainty in the value of the anomaly ( around @xmath35 , see eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ pioneer ] ) ; see also fig . 2 of @xcite ) ; from figure [ fig : shell ] we can see that for an important region inside the sphere the calculated acceleration is in accordance with the anomaly taking into account the uncertainty in the observational data .    </S>",
    "<S> the third case is a cylindrical ring , with height @xmath36 and borders at @xmath27 ua and @xmath31 ua and a surface density @xmath37 ( in this case , @xmath22 is the radius in cylindrical coordinates ) , and the solution is not as trivial as the two previous . in the appendix </S>",
    "<S> we describe the method used to calculate the acceleration of an infinitely thin disk ( @xmath38 ) , the result appears in figure ( [ fig : disk ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> the following important features can be seen in the figure : the acceleration is almost constant between @xmath39 ua and @xmath40 ua with a change of less than @xmath41 ; near the edges of the ring a significant change in the acceleration takes place , this is due to the fact that @xmath18 is singular at the edges .     acceleration caused in a test particle located at @xmath22 due to an infinitely thin disk going from @xmath27 ua to @xmath31 ua </S>",
    "<S> , the acceleration is in units of @xmath42.,width=264 ]    the first feature of the results show us that a constant acceleration can be produced in a large region inside the ring by such a simple model . </S>",
    "<S> the region of this constancy can be extended backwards ( from @xmath39 ua to @xmath24 ua as the pioneer anomaly requires ) by extending backwards the ring , it has to start then at @xmath43 ua . </S>",
    "<S> however it s important to mention that in order to give a better estimate of where this ring could start in reality , it s necessary to have more precise data that the one reported for the pioneer anomaly , specially in the zone when the anomaly starts to be significant , because it s in this region where the larger uncertainty in the data is present ( see figure 2 of @xcite ) .    regarding the second feature </S>",
    "<S> , we can say that the singularities can disappear taking a smooth but fast change in the surface density in the edges and not a cut - off as the one we used in the calculations , this is is of course a more realistic case . </S>",
    "<S> it s also important to say at this point that when the 2d case we have chosen here is taken to 3d for a a cylindrical ring of height @xmath36 the results does nt change significantly , the calculation has been made somewhere else @xcite ( see figures 5 and 8 of the paper ) , for this case , in the region of constant acceleration , the change in magnitude between the 2d and 3d models is almost null , the main difference is near the edges where the spikes become less extreme for the 3d case .    in order to obtain the magnitude we need for the acceleration , the surface density at @xmath44 ua of the thin ring must be , according to eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : a_p ] ) in the appendix : ( 20ua)=0.81 in the realistic case of 3d this ring becomes a cylindrical ring of height @xmath36 that has a volumetric density given by @xmath45 , then for @xmath44 ua , and assuming @xmath46 ua we have : @xmath47 .    </S>",
    "<S> the total mass of a belt with such a density , considering a disk with a thickness of @xmath48 ua , and ranging from @xmath24 to @xmath49 ua , gives * @xmath50 * , two order of magnitudes larger than the current estimates on the kuiper s belt mass @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> a first possible explanation for this discrepancy , which is obtained considering that the belt is formed out of pure dust , could be the presence of tiny ice rocks and gas which have not been accounted for by those studies . in the same work , @xcite </S>",
    "<S> , the authors did consider , as in our present work , the gravitational influence of the kuiper belt as a possible explanation to the acceleration seen on the pioneers , but discarded that influence based on two reasons : first that the acceleration profile is not constant across the data range , ( this is because they did not consider a density distribution going as @xmath51 ) , and second that the total mass exceeded the current estimations , @xmath52 , for the dust in the kuiper belt region from @xmath13 to @xmath49 ua .    nevertheless , even though such mass distribution does explain the deacceleration observed in the pioneers , it is unlikely that baryonic matter could be responsible for this effect , there would have to be a very high amount of small objects implying a large collision rate and optical and infrared signatures that have not been detected . </S>",
    "<S> thus , in order to keep the model and mantain that the observed deacceleration is due to gravitational pull , the other possible candidate is the dark matter within the solar system . </S>",
    "<S> the fact that the galaxies , including ours of course , are surrounded by dark matter halos is already a well established fact . </S>",
    "<S> the numerical simulations , namely the nfw , predicts the dark matter halo and give a well known density distribution @xcite . evaluating that density at the position of our solar system , and considering that the gravitational influence of the sun extends to the ort cloud ( around @xmath53 ua ) </S>",
    "<S> , we see that there are about @xmath54 of dark matter whose dynamics is dictated by the sun . </S>",
    "<S> it is still an open question on how this solar dark matter halo reacts to that influence . when the proto solar system was being formed , the solar dark matter halo was pulled inwards and it could be that the final configuration is an spherical shell or a belt in a region close to the sun with properties similar to the ones described in the last paragraphs , giving in this way the mass needed to explain the observed deacceleration on both spacecrafts .    * given the properties requiered for the dark matter particles , the natural candidates are wimps ( weakly interacting massive particles ) . indeed , </S>",
    "<S> one most favoured wimp to be the dark matter particle is the neutralino , predicted by one of the extensions of the standard model of particles , the minimal supersymmetryic standard model ( mssm ) , which complies with the characteristics needed for a dark matter particle , namely mass of the order of @xmath55 , making it a member of the cold dark matter pradigm , very small cross section , @xmath56 , electrically neutral and stable ( @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> detection of the neutralino is nowadays an exciting field of research , neutralinos may be detected either directly through their interactions with ordinary matter or indirectly through their annihilation decay products . in the first case </S>",
    "<S> , several experiments on earth are looking for signals associated with dark matter scattering with baryonic matter ( nucleus recoils for example ) ( @xcite ) with no conclusive result yet . </S>",
    "<S> the interpretation of this data depends on the spatial distribution of density and velocity for dark mater in the earth neighborhood which is poorly known . </S>",
    "<S> the model presented here could serve as an attempt to give a prediction for the density distribution of dark matter using the data of the pioneer s anomaly , but only for regions beyond @xmath57 , therefore it has no effect for direct detection experiments on earth . </S>",
    "<S> indirect detection is based on looking for signals of the remnants resulting from dark matter annihilation , the neutralino being a majorana particle can annihilate with itself . </S>",
    "<S> the production of these remnants , positrons , photons , neutrinos , etc . </S>",
    "<S> , can be enhanced in regions of high dark matter density such as the center of galaxies ( for an excellent review on this topic see @xcite ) . *    * the properties of the neutralino fit very well with the model presented in this work . </S>",
    "<S> their presence influence the dynamics of the objects mostly through gravitational interaction and has a negligible dispersion with ordinary matter . and </S>",
    "<S> it is for this last reason that there could not be a measurable contribution to the pionner anomaly due to dispersion effects . *    </S>",
    "<S> also , it is important to point out that the belt would also affect neptune s orbit , modifying its period in the following way ( using the approximation of circular orbits ) : t^2=4 ^ 2 ( ) , that is , neptune also feels the acceleration due to this matter distribution . </S>",
    "<S> such acceleration changes neptune s period in @xmath58 seconds _ per _ period , implying a shift in neptune s center of mass of @xmath59 kilometers after each revolution . </S>",
    "<S> it is a very tiny quantity but future probes could be designed in such a way as to be able to measure these effects .    </S>",
    "<S> the radial density profile ( going as @xmath60 ) needed to explain a constant acceleration towards the sun , can be explained by models of solar system formation ( in the case of baryonic matter only ) . in @xcite </S>",
    "<S> , the authors made an analysis of the dust population in the outer solar system region ; making a computational approach ( see fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : kuiper ] ) considering source objects from the jupiter - family comets and the kuiper belt . </S>",
    "<S> they obtained a radial distribution of dust for the region between 20 to 70 ua , that has a sharp peak near 20 ua and from there falls like @xmath51 , just as our model predicts . </S>",
    "<S> after that , it has a smaller peak near 50 ua ( see fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : densidad ] of this paper that is a reproduction of fig . </S>",
    "<S> 5 of @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> this result is encouraging for our model but given the large amount of mass needed to reproduce the actual deacceleration measured by the pioneers , it would have to be remade with the inclusion of dark matter to see if the density profile remains the same with the required amount of mass .    </S>",
    "<S> numerical simulation of the density distribution of matter at the solar system in the ecliptic plane @xcite.,width=264 ]    numerical simulation of the radial density distribution of matter at the solar system in the ecliptic plane @xcite.,width=302 ]    following this scheme , the mass density distribution that appears after the orbit of uranus , is a result of an inward transport of material from the kuiper belt into this orbit due mainly to the gravitational influence of neptune and uranus . if the radial distribution goes in fact like @xmath51 ( at least between 20 to 100 ua ) , as the kind of models presented by gorkavyi _ </S>",
    "<S> et al . _ </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , and with a total mass of @xmath61 , then the so called pioneer anomaly can be explained by the gravitational force that this distribution produce on every test particle inside it , as was shown previously , making the observed blue shift not an anomaly , but a natural consequence of the gravitational pull due to the material present in these regions .    * indeed , the actual dark matter distribution within the solar system is still an open question . </S>",
    "<S> a numerical simulation has to be performed to give an appropriate description on this subject , taking into account the effects of the formation and evolution of the solar system on the dark matter solar halo . </S>",
    "<S> the outcome of these analysis would determine whether or not the matter distribution proposed in the present model is plausible . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , it is important to determine the influence due to the outer planets . </S>",
    "<S> this would answer the question if a gap of @xmath24 au starting from the sun an then a region with density falling like @xmath60 that has not been trashed away by neptune is possible . </S>",
    "<S> the gravitational influence of the outer planets on the baryonic matter has formed solar belts in these regions , which probably has a matter distribution similar to the one required for dark matter . *    </S>",
    "<S> also , we want to comment that while this work was being finished , we learned that nieto _ et . </S>",
    "<S> al _ </S>",
    "<S> @xcite were also considering the effect of the material in the kuiper belt on the space probes . </S>",
    "<S> however , in their approach they studied the drag force of this material on the probes , obtaining a different density distribution , mainly that the density should be constant in order to explain the constant acceleration pull observed on the pioneers .    finally , we remark that it is very important to perform new and more detailed studies on the density distribution and total mass of the matter belts in the regions beyond uranus orbit to verify , or discard , the explanation for the pioneer acceleration presented in this work . * in order to do so , we consider it is necessary to send several probes to the outer regions of the solar system , like the tau probe ( thousand astronomical unit ) , in several directions , including those perpendicular to the solar system plane , and equipped with the needed instruments in order to determine , via the deacceleration effects , the nature and characteristics of the phenomenon which causes these effects , and then see if it is compatible with a dark matter distribution . *    we acknowledge that the required amount of mass needed to reproduce the magnitude of the pioneers deacceleration is indeed very large considering the actual estimates of mass in such a region , however the idea proposed in this work is appealing due to it s simplicity and has already generated some attention in the scientific community ( see for example the works that have appeared while this work was being considered for publication , @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> we think that the proposal described above considering dark matter as a possible explanation for the unaccounted mass is worth to follow and , as we mentioned above , it would be interesting to perform numerical simulations for the solar system formation which include dark matter in order to study its final distribution .    </S>",
