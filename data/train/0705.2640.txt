    "integer partition problem has a long history going back to euler . the classical question asks : in how many ways @xmath2",
    "can one partition an integer @xmath3 into nonzero integer parts @xmath4 such that @xmath5 for all @xmath6 ?",
    "for example ,",
    "@xmath7 : @xmath8 .",
    "pictorially , one can represent the part @xmath9 as the height of the @xmath10-th column with nonincreasing heights such that the total height under the columns is @xmath3 .",
    "hardy and ramanujan proved @xcite that for large @xmath3 , @xmath11 , with @xmath12 .",
    "similarly , one can ask the number of ways of partitioning the integer @xmath3 into _ distinct _ integer summands , i.e. , @xmath13 such that @xmath14 with strictly decreasing heigth . for example",
    ", the integer @xmath15 can be partitioned into distinct summands in only two ways , @xmath16 . in this restricted case",
    "it is known that asymptotically for large @xmath3  @xcite , @xmath17 where @xmath18 .",
    "another way of representing integer partitions makes clear the connection with a gas of noninteracting quantum particles .",
    "let @xmath19 be the number of columns of height @xmath20 in a given partition , i.e. the number of times the summand @xmath21 appears in a given partition . for example , in the partition @xmath22 , one has @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 for all @xmath26 .",
    "then , @xmath27 where @xmath28 for @xmath29 represent equidistant single particle energy levels and @xmath30 represents the occupation number of the @xmath21-th level . in the unrestricted problem , the occupation number @xmath31 ( bosons ) whereas in the restricted problem @xmath32 ( fermions ) .",
    "therefore , @xmath33 is the total energy of the system and @xmath34    if in addition , one restricts the number of summands to be @xmath35 , then the number @xmath36 of ways of partitioning @xmath3 into @xmath35 parts is simply the micro - canonical partition function of a gas of quantum particles with total energy @xmath3 and total number of particles @xmath35 @xmath37 evidently , @xmath38 .",
    "even though the sum @xmath2 has similar asymptotic behavior for large @xmath3 for bosons and fermions , i.e. , @xmath39 ( up to a constant prefactor ) , we will show in this paper that @xmath36 , as a function of @xmath35 for a fixed @xmath3 , has rather different behavior for bosons and fermions .",
    "thus a gas of non - interacting bosons or fermions occupying a single particle equidistant spectrum ( @xmath28 ) both have a combinatorial interpretation in terms of partitions of an integer @xmath3 into @xmath35 parts .",
    "* bose statistics corresponds to the case of unrestricted partitions @xmath31 . *",
    "fermi statistics corresponds to the case of restricted partitions with distinct summands @xmath40 .    a natural question , that we address in this paper , is how to provide a combinatorial description of a quantum gas obeying exclusion statistics .",
    "exclusion statistics is a generalization of bose and fermi statistics  @xcite .",
    "it has been found explicitly in quantum models of interacting particle systems , notably in the two dimensional lowest - landau - level ( lll ) anyon model @xcite ( i.e. the anyon model projected into the lll of a strong magnetic field ) and the one dimensional calogero model  @xcite .",
    "note that the calogero model can be obtained as a particular limit of the lll - anyon model  @xcite , the latter being a particular exactly solvable projection of the anyon model : it follows that exclusion statistics is deeply rooted in the more general concept of anyon statistics  @xcite . unlike the bose and fermi statistics which describes noninteracting particles , a combinatorial description of exclusion statistics is a priori quite nontrivial since the underlying physical models with exclusion statistics describe truly interacting @xmath35-body systems .",
    "we show in this paper that a combinatorial interpretation of exclusion statistics involves a generalization of the partition problem known as the minimal difference partition ( mdp ) problem . in mdp ,",
    "one partitions a positive integer e into @xmath35 nonzero parts , @xmath41 ( with @xmath42 for all @xmath43 ) such that each summand exceeds the next by at least an integer @xmath0 , i.e. @xmath44 for all @xmath45 .",
    "therefore , @xmath46 corresponds to unrestricted partitions ( bosons ) and @xmath47 to restricted partitions ( fermions ) into distinct parts . even though the parameter @xmath0 in mdp is an integer",
    ", one can analytically continue the results to noninteger values of @xmath0 and we will show that for @xmath48 , the mdp corresponds to a gas of quantum particles obeying exclusion statistics .    apart from establishing this equivalence between the mdp problem and exclusion statistics , we also provide a detailed analysis of the asymptotic behavior of @xmath49 , i.e. , the number of ways the integer @xmath3 can be partitioned into @xmath35 parts in the mdp problem , for all @xmath50 .",
    "this analysis tells us how the variable @xmath35 fluctuates from one partition to another for fixed @xmath3 . indeed , defining @xmath51 as the total number of partitions of @xmath3 and treating all such partitions equally likely , the ratio @xmath52 is the probability distribution of the random variable @xmath35 , given @xmath3 .",
    "we show that this distribution , properly centered and scaled , has rather different limiting shapes for @xmath46 and @xmath53 . while for @xmath46 the scaled distribution is asymmetric and has a gumbel shape , for @xmath53 ( including the fermionic case @xmath54 ) the scaled distribution is symmetric and has a gaussian shape .    at this point",
    ", it may be useful to summarize our main mathematical results for the asymptotic behavior of @xmath55 .",
    "for the bosonic case ( @xmath46 ) , the limiting shape of the distribution was first derived by erds and lehner using rigorous methods involving upper and lower bounds  @xcite . in this paper",
    "we calculate the limiting shapes of @xmath55 for all @xmath50 .",
    "moreover , our method allows us to compute the probabilities of _ atypical large _ fluctuations which go beyond the range of validity of the limiting distributions .    for @xmath46",
    "we show that @xmath56 , as a function of @xmath35 for fixed @xmath3 , has a peak at a characteristic value @xmath57 for large @xmath3 , where @xmath58 , and the random variable @xmath35 _ typically _ fluctuates around @xmath59 over a scale @xmath60 .",
    "moreover , in the vicinity of @xmath59 over a range @xmath61 , the distribution @xmath56 has a scaling form ( or a limiting law ) . in terms of the cumulative probability , @xmath62 where the scaling function @xmath63 has an asymmetric gumbel form , thus recovering the erds - lehner result  @xcite @xmath64 . \\label{gumbel2}\\ ] ]    in contrast , for @xmath53 , the distribution @xmath55 has quite a different asymptotic behavior .",

    "more precisely , we show that in the vicinity of @xmath66 , the cumulative probability @xmath68 has a scaling form @xmath69 is a universal scaling function independent of @xmath0 ( @xmath70 ) .",
    "the two nonuniversal scale factors @xmath71 and @xmath72 however depend explicitly on @xmath0 and can be computed exactly . for example , for fermions ( @xmath54 ) , we recover the erds - lehner result for the mean @xmath73 and get a new result for the variance @xmath74^{1/2}. \\label{fermi2}\\ ] ]    thus , as far as the limiting shape of the scaled distribution of @xmath55 is concerned , it is a universal gaussian for all @xmath53 .",
    "the fermionic case @xmath54 is thus a representative of all @xmath53 and can be considered as an attractive fixed point along the @xmath0-axis ( see fig .",
    "( [ fig : fp ] ) .",
    "in contrast , the bosonic case @xmath46 represents a repulsive fixed point where the shape is gumbel .",
    "the limit laws above describe the probabilities of _ typical _ fluctuations of @xmath35 around its characteristic value @xmath66 ? in this paper , we have also investigated the probability of _ atypical large _ fluctuations of @xmath35 away from @xmath66 and calculated the corresponding large deviation functions exactly . like the limit laws , the large deviation properties for @xmath53 turns out to be rather different from the @xmath46 case , thus confirming the fixed point picture of fig .",
    "[ fig : fp ] .",
    "curiously though , we show that the large deviation function for any @xmath53 is related to that of @xmath46 via an exact nonlinear relation .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2 ,",
    "we precisely define the mdp problem , provide an exact derivation of the generating function of @xmath49 and establish a nonlinear relation between @xmath49 with @xmath53 and @xmath75 . in section 3 , we show how the mdp problem with @xmath48 corresponds to exclusion statistics . in section 4",
    ", we provide detailed asymptotic analysis of @xmath49 for all @xmath50 and obtain the limiting shapes of the scaled distribution @xmath55 and also calculate exactly the associated large deviation functions .",
    "finally , we conclude with a summary and open problems in section 5 .",
    "in the minimal difference partition ( mdp ) problem , one partitions an integer @xmath3 into @xmath35 nonzero parts , @xmath76 ( with @xmath42 for each @xmath77 ) such that each part exceeds the next one by at least an integer @xmath0 , i.e. , @xmath44 for all @xmath78 ( see fig . [",

    "however , here we provide a simple derivation of this result that brings out in a direct way a nontrivial connection between the cases @xmath53 and @xmath46 which will be used later for the analysis of the asymptotic behavior .",

    "let us now define a new set of heights @xmath81 for @xmath43 .",
    "thus , @xmath82 for all @xmath80 and @xmath83 .",
    "the new heights thus satisfy the constraint @xmath84 for all @xmath80 and their total height is given by @xmath85 therefore , the primed heights correspond to a partition configuration of the integer @xmath86 into @xmath35 parts with @xmath53 .",
    "this exact correspondence then provides us with the following identity valid for all @xmath35 @xmath87 thus if one can compute the partition function @xmath75 for the bosonic case ( @xmath46 ) , this identity can be used to obtain exact results for any arbitrary @xmath53 , including the fermionic case @xmath54 .",

    "in this section we show that the mdp problem with integer parameter @xmath0 , continued analytically to the range @xmath93 corresponds to a quantum gas of interacting particles obeying exclusion statistics .",
    "this correspondence is established at two levels : ( i ) at a microscopic level where we show in subsection 3.1 that the @xmath49 of the mdp problem corresponds precisely to the micro - canonical partition function of the one dimensional calogero model in an external harmonic potential and ( ii ) at a more general thermodynamical level in section 3.2 .",
    "the aim of this subsection is to show that there is an exact one to one correspondence between the energy levels of the one dimensional calogero model in an external harmonic well and the partition configurations of the mdp problem , continued analytically to @xmath93 in the sense explained below .    the calogero model ( for a review see @xcite , @xcite ) describes an interacting quantum particle system on a line where the particles attract each other by an inverse square potential . in order to have a proper thermodynamic limit",
    ", one can either put the @xmath35 particles in a finite box of size @xmath94 and then take the @xmath95 , @xmath96 limit keeping the density @xmath97 fixed .",
    "alternatively , one can keep the particles on the infinite line , but switch on an external harmonic potential of strength @xmath98 . in the latter case",
