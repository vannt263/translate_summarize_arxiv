    "the motion of a rigid body which is not submitted to gravitational force , this is known as the euler case , is one of the few tops which are completely integrable .",
    "these systems have been studied by lots of famous mathematicians like jacobi and klein to mention only two .    a new approach to integrable systems in general ( finite and infinite dimensional ) is provided by the method of finite gap integration which uses lax pairs with a spectral parameter .",
    "this has been introduced by the work of novikov , dubrovin , matveev , its , kriechever , and others .",
    "once such a lax pair is found , one can start to use algebro - geometric methods to describe the system .",
    "accounts of what has been acheived up to now can be found in [ 2 ] .    in the last ten to twenty years completely integrable discrete systems gained more and more attention . among the early works in this field i only mention [ 5 ] , [ 6 ] , [ 7 ] , [ 8 ] .",
    "a collection of new articles relevant within this context is [ 9 ] .",

    "[ 1 ] we studied another lax pair for the discrete euler top where the spectral parameter varies on an elliptic curve .",
    "this makes the finite gap integration more difficult . to my knowledge",
    "the first solution of such a system was given by a.i .",
    "bobenko in [ 12 ] .",
    "the present paper can be seen as an addendum to [ 1 ] .",
    "it describes the finite gap integration for the system introduced there .",
    "in [ 1 ] a discrete version of the euler top was studied .",
    "these notes now are concerned with the finite gap integration of this system .",
    "let s recall the notation :    the top itself is given by the inertia tensor ( in diagonal form ) :",

    "see [ 1 ] for more considerations on @xmath24 ( e.g. how @xmath24 has to look like so that the discrete map becomes a poisson map ) .",
    "this paper is concerned with finding explicit solutions for this system with the help of prym theta functions and abelian differentials .",
    "the methods used here are similar to those in [ 2 ] .",
    "to perform the finite gap integration , we first have to get the spectral curve . from ( [ lax ] )",
    "it is clear that for each fixed @xmath26 the eigenvalues of @xmath27 are independent of @xmath28 .",

    "@xmath137 and @xmath138 thus both have a pole at @xmath291 . from proposition [ thetaprop ] and the behaviour of @xmath268 when shifted by @xmath292 ,",

    "\\(iv ) follows immediately from the periodic behaviour of @xmath268 .",
    "finally , since @xmath228 as well as @xmath280 are pullbacks via the quotient map @xmath296 , and @xmath238- and @xmath239-periods for @xmath228 are @xmath297 and for @xmath280 zero , we get :    @xmath298    hence :    @xmath299    which proves ( v ) .",
