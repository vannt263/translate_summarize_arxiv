    "by symmetry , it suffices to consider the case where @xmath403 is c - simplicial and @xmath404 is not .",
    "the fact that @xmath403 is c - simplicial means that it can be assigned a color that must be from @xmath504 and thereby obtain a 7-coloring of @xmath505 .",
    "since @xmath404 is not c - simplicial means that the neighbors of @xmath391 among @xmath493 have the colors @xmath502 and @xmath503 precisely .",
    "we now consider the following three cases :        @xmath403 has color @xmath182 : here @xmath351 and @xmath391 can not be connected since both @xmath403 and @xmath391 have color @xmath182 . in this case",
    "assign the colors @xmath508 to the vertices @xmath492 , thereby obtaining a legitimate 7-coloring of @xmath500 .",
    "remark : to test the legitimacy of the extended colorings we note first of all that the vertices @xmath351 , @xmath360 and @xmath391 always keep their color from the one provided by @xmath0 .",
    "in addition , the colors of the neighbors of @xmath351 among @xmath509 are the same , unless @xmath403 is not c - simplicial , which gives concrete information about the colors of the other neighbors of @xmath351 .",
    "similarly the colors of the neighbors of @xmath391 among @xmath509 are the same , unless ( as for @xmath403 ) @xmath404 is not c - simplicial , which again gives concrete information about the colors of the remaining neighbors of @xmath391 .",
    "assume @xmath1 is a minimal criminal , which must therefore be fully restricted .",
    "since @xmath33 , each 1-ss face @xmath127 of @xmath1 has a parent @xmath157 and a grandparent @xmath158 in @xmath110 .",
    "hence , @xmath158 ( that is @xmath510 ) is a leaf in @xmath511 ( or a single vertex ) .",
    "since @xmath1 is fully restricted , the configuration @xmath459 in @xmath1 is induced by a 5-cycle on vertices @xmath461 in clockwise order and is of type ( a ) , ( b ) or ( c ) mentioned earlier .",
    "assume @xmath158 is bounded by @xmath512 where @xmath513 .",
    "if @xmath158 ( that is @xmath510 ) is not a single vertex but a leaf in @xmath511 , then let the edge @xmath514 of @xmath1 be the dual edge of the unique edge with @xmath510 as and endvertex in @xmath511 . in any case",
    "( whether @xmath510 is a leaf or a single vertex in @xmath511 ) at least one of the edges @xmath515 must be identified with an edge @xmath469 of a configuration @xmath459 of type ( a ) , ( b ) or ( c ) .    if there is an edge @xmath516 bounding @xmath158 and a configuration @xmath459 in such a way that the edge @xmath469 is identified with @xmath516 ( i.e.  @xmath517 and @xmath518 ) and such that either @xmath519 or @xmath520 , then either the degree - two vertices @xmath401 or @xmath465 has @xmath441 neighbors in @xmath0 respectively .",
    "this means that a 7-coloring of either @xmath458 or @xmath521 can be used to extend to a 7-coloring of @xmath1 .",
    "therefore @xmath1 can not be a minimal criminal in this case .",
    "we note that in order for @xmath522 for all configurations @xmath459 , then _ every _",
    "edge @xmath516 for @xmath523 must be identified with an edge @xmath469 of a configuration @xmath459 .",
    "that is to say , none of the edges @xmath516 can bound the infinite face of @xmath1 . since @xmath513 we must , in particular , have that the edges @xmath476 and @xmath524 must be identified with edges @xmath469 of configurations @xmath459 each of type ( a ) , ( b ) or ( c ) .",
    "if @xmath525 , then ( as mentioned in previous paragraph ) both configurations , to the left and right of @xmath352 in the plane embedding of @xmath1 , contain a degree - two vertex with @xmath441 neighbors in @xmath0 . in order for @xmath526 then the @xmath459 configuration to the left of @xmath352 in @xmath1 , must be of type ( b ) or ( c ) and the configuration @xmath459 to the right of @xmath352 must be of type ( a ) or ( c ) .",
    "we now finally discuss these cases separately . here",
    "`` case ( x , y ) '' will mean that configuration @xmath459 of type ( x ) is to the left of @xmath352 and configuration @xmath459 of type ( y ) is to the right of @xmath352 .",
    "we have observed that yields an optimal for coloring squares of outerplanar graphs whenever @xmath22 or @xmath191 . on many of the examples that we have constructed",
    "it also gives optimal colorings .",
    "it is therefore a natural question to ask whether it always obtains an optimal coloring .",
    "if not , one may ask for the case of chordal graphs , where we have seen that is also optimal for @xmath369 and @xmath260 .",
    "further evidence may be gathered by observing that it yields optimal colorings of @xmath329 , @xmath330 and @xmath217 , since their squares are chordal .",
    "suppose that the vertices of ( [ fig : subfig : f6 ] ) in figure  [ fig : f456 ] are ordered so that first come the white vertices in the order shown on the figure ( either from left - to - right or in a circular order ) .",
    "then , greedy will first color the white vertices with the first two colors .",
    "now , the remaining six vertices must receive different colors , and none of them can use the first two colors , resulting in an 8-coloring .",
