    "in high - order harmonic generation ( hhg ) , the intensity maxima of a strong driving laser pulse tunnel - ionize an atom or molecule . once an electron is in the continuum , its acceleration is controlled by the electric field profile @xmath0 . the electron is initially driven outwards , but then the field reverses , driving it back for a high - energy recollision with the core , approximately three - quarters of a cycle later @xcite , in which an attosecond burst of extreme ultraviolet ( xuv ) radiation is generated .",
    "indeed , each half - cycle of the driving pulse initiates this sequence of events , so a train of xuv bursts a few hundred attoseconds long is produced . while a train is useful for probing ultrafast dynamics , a primary goal of attosecond science is the generation of single bursts of xuv radiation , and various gating schemes have been employed to achieve this .",
    "one scheme already in use is polarization gating ; in this technique , the sense of circular polarization reverses smoothly through the driving pulse , passing only briefly through linear polarization at which point an attosecond burst is generated .",
    "another technique is to `` gradient - gate '' the hhg interaction , which can be done most simply by an additional driving field at double the frequency , suitably phased with respect to the fundamental field ; this is just the case of two - color pumping . in the present paper ,",
    "we push the concept of gradient - gating to its limits by considering how to achieve the steepest gradients possible . in principle , this can be done with carrier - wave steepening and shocking , a process first identified by rosen @xcite in 1965 .",
    "he showed that for a instantaneous third - order ( @xmath1 ) nonlinearity , field gradients could become infinite ( i.e. shocks could form ) after a finite distance of propagation .",
    "as we demonstrate in section [ s - shocking ] , the theory can be extended to include arbitrary combinations of nonlinear terms , which opens up possibilities for controlling the symmetry of the pulse at the same time as generating a gradient - gate .",
    "we then proceed to discuss the previously unaddressed second - order @xmath2 case , which turns out to give wave forms particularly useful for hhg .",
    "unfortunately it is very difficult to generate carrier - wave self - steepened ( css ) pulses because dispersion overwhelms the steepening process @xcite . in section [ s - practical ] , we therefore discuss the possibility of synthesizing the steepened profiles by combining a suitably phased sub - set of the harmonics present in a true css profile ; optical wave form synthesis of this kind is already exploited in other contexts ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "such a synthesis is in any case the logical extension of both the two - color pumping scheme and the gradient - gate concept .    in section [ s - hhg ] ,",
    "we compare simulations of hhg driven by standard pulses and by synthesized css - like wave forms . in the latter case",
    ", we demonstrate the importance of the relative phasing of the spectral components by comparing the results to those based on phase - flattened ( i.e. field - maximized ) pulses with equivalent spectral content .",
    "we also show that the efficacy of the synthesized profiles for hhg is progressively enhanced as the number of harmonics is increased .",
    "high - pass filtering then leads to the production of attosecond xuv bursts , and the presence of even harmonics in @xmath2 css - like pulses is shown to increase the degree of isolation of the bursts .",
    "a genetic algorithm is used to show that sawtooth profiles are ideal for driving hhg , which is in line with the general conclusions of this study , as summarised in section [ s - conclusion ] .",
    "the self - steepening of an optical pulse envelope was first studied by demartini _",
    "et al . _ in 1967 @xcite , and is a well - known phenomenon associated with self - phase modulation .",
    "surprisingly , however , the possibility of shock formation on the optical carrier was considered even earlier in a 1965 paper by rosen @xcite , who showed that , for a third order ( @xmath1 ) nonlinearity , a field discontinuity ( or shock ) can develop under certain circumstances after a finite distance of propagation . before a carrier shock forms , or before its onset is halted by ( e.g. ) dispersion or the nonlinear response time , the carrier - wave undergoes self - steepening .",
    "this phenomenon received little attention from the optics community for more than 30 years , until it was revisited in the 1990s by flesch _",
    "@xcite , who performed finite - difference time - domain ( fdtd ) simulations of the process ; more recently , the role of dispersion was examined in more detail @xcite .",
    "the theory of carrier shocking and self - steepening is an important way of determining the profiles of pulses with a maximized field gradient , and so is needed when considering the limits of a gradient - gated hhg scheme .",
    "although a fertile field for theoretical work , css pulses are difficult to realize experimentally because of the deleterious effect of dispersion . nevertheless , the theory provides important information when maximizing the gradient - gating effect in hhg .",
    "we use the method of characteristics ( moc ) @xcite to predict the shocking distance for a pulse in a dispersionless medium containing an arbitrary combination of nonlinear terms .",
    "the theory is based on the one - dimensional ( 1d ) , sourceless , plane - polarized maxwell s equations for a field propagating in the @xmath3 direction , and a material response characterized by the electrical displacement field   @xmath4 where @xmath5 refers to the @xmath6-th order nonlinear susceptibility of the medium , which is assumed to be instantaneous .",
    "this extends the model used by kinsler @xcite , since it allows for combinations of all orders of nonlinearity . propagating pulses with a field profile @xmath0 using this model leads to self - steepening of the carrier - wave .",
    "eventually , a localized _ infinite _ field gradient occurs on the wave form at a distance   @xmath7 .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] some exotic features of this prediction are discussed in @xcite ; a longer derivation is given in appendix [ s - moc ] .",
    "to verify the predictions of eqn .",
    "( [ eq : moc_n ] ) , we used the pseudospectral spatial domain ( pssd ) method @xcite to propagate pulses for various orders of nonlinearity .",
    "the numerical shocks were detected using the local discontinuity detection ( ldd ) method @xcite , which is useful for shock detection within a discretized system .",
    "we also used a hybrid propagation technique , combining directional variables @xcite and a wideband envelope @xcite , to check the results of the steepened and shocked wave forms . in all cases , the ldd ( numerical ) shocking distances obtained from our simulations were in good agreement with those predicted by eqn .",
    "( [ eq : moc_n ] ) .",
    "[ fig : profiles ] illustrates typical css pulses for low - order nonlinearities , and displays some striking properties . in particular , figs .",
    "[ fig : profiles ] ( a ) and [ fig : profiles ] ( c ) ( for @xmath2 and @xmath8 ) both have an underlying sawtooth shape , where the unit of repetition is a whole cycle .",
    "this is because both even _ and _ odd harmonics are present in the spectrum , and the inversion symmetry of the initial pulse is broken ; positive lobes of @xmath0 lean to later times , and negative lobes to earlier times , since ( for @xmath2 ) the change in characteristic velocity is proportional to @xmath9 , and ( for @xmath8 ) to @xmath10 .",
    "in contrast , fig .  [",
    "fig : profiles ] ( b ) ( for @xmath1 ) shows both positive and negative lobes leaning to later times , since the change in characteristic velocity is proportional to @xmath11 .",
    "because odd nonlinearities produce a cascade containing _ only _ odd harmonics , every half cycle is similar and the pulses preserve inversion symmetry .",
    "another noteworthy feature is that , for higher - order nonlinearities , the steepening becomes increasingly localized to within the most intense carrier oscillation(s ) .",
    "we now present a brief review of self - steepening and shocking for @xmath2 nonlinearities .",
    "we focus on this case because it has not previously been addressed and because of the relevance to hhg discussed later in section [ s - hhg ] . of course ,",
    "nonlinearities of higher order than third also exist ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , but usually they are much less important . the @xmath1 case has already been extensively addressed in the literature @xcite . for a @xmath2 nonlinearity on its own , eqn .",
    "( [ eq : moc_n ] ) indicates that the shocking distance depends primarily on the inverse field gradient so that @xmath12 .",
    "a profile for a ( nearly shocked ) @xmath2 css pulse in a dispersionless medium can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : profiles](a ) , with its characteristic sawtooth profile .",
    "it exhibits two distinct regions ; one containing a ramp - like smooth progression from negative to positive field values taking up the majority of the cycle , and the second with a rapid positive to negative transition over the remaining small fraction of the cycle .",
    "if we plotted the wave form for a continuous wave field , rather than a pulse , we would see the field evolving towards a sawtooth - like profile ( e.g. as seen in @xcite ) .",
    "the build - up of harmonic content during the reshaping and steepening of the time domain profiles is vividly illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : shock2 ] .",
    "note that the spectra differ from those produced under @xmath1 self - steepening where only odd harmonics are produced .",
    "the nature of the harmonic cascade in fig .",
    "[ fig : shock2 ] indicates that , if it were possible to achieve strong self - steepening experimentally , this would in itself be a route to hhg .",
    "we will return to this point in the next section .    as for the @xmath1 case @xcite ,",
    "the @xmath2 process is also sensitive to the pulse length and the carrier envelope phase ( cep ) offset ; these parameters are also important when driving hhg .",
    "[ fig : profiles](a ) shows that for a cep of @xmath13 , the carrier has a positive gradient at the center of the pulse .",
    "however , steepening occurs for negative gradients in the @xmath2 case , and hence the high gradients occur near the zeros half a cycle away on either side .",
    "since these are reduced by envelope fall - off , @xmath14 increases as the pulse width is reduced for @xmath13 .",
    "in contrast , when @xmath15 , steepening occurs at the center of the pulse , and @xmath14 is then independent of pulse duration . the dependence of @xmath16 on cep for different pulse widths is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : lengthsandwidths ] . this can be compared with the more complicated cep dependence seen in fig .",
    "4 of @xcite , where @xmath17 .",
    "the theory of section [ s - shocking ] was based on the ideal case of a dispersionless medium with instantaneous nonlinearity . the question of whether sufficiently self - steepened pulses could be generated in _",
    "real _ nonlinear materials has been addressed for the @xmath1 case in @xcite , where considerations such as linear dispersion @xcite and the strength and response time of the nonlinearities were evaluated .",
    "similar issues arise in the @xmath2 case , and so we will not repeat them here .",
    "we note that for many @xmath2 materials , the polarization of the generated harmonics is different from that of the driving field , bringing in the further complication of birefringence .",
    "however , materials do exist that support processes where the polarizations are the same ( e.g. @xmath18 in lithium niobate @xcite ) , which could ( in principle ) generate a harmonic cascade in a single polarization .    in practice ,",
    "the limitations imposed by dispersion and material damage mean that generating strongly self - steepened pulses would be an extremely challenging task , although some success might be achieved if relatively weak self - steepening were sufficient .",
    "we therefore consider the possibility of _ synthesizing _ css - like pulses by combining a sub - set of harmonic components using the phase offsets and amplitudes obtained from numerically - generated css profiles .",
    "it turns out to be possible to approximate @xmath2 and @xmath1 css - like wave forms using field strengths and phases for the @xmath19-th harmonic ( @xmath20 ) based on the formulae   @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the harmonic order , @xmath23 or @xmath24 for the @xmath2 and @xmath1 cases respectively , and @xmath25 is a fitting factor . with @xmath26 ,",
    "these equations give a reasonable match to the css wave form with the spectrum fourth from the top in fig .",
    "[ fig : shock2 ] , which is close to shocking .",
    "we note that higher - order harmonics comprise only a small fraction of the total css pulse energy .",
    "however , only a small number of harmonics would be used in a synthesized pulse . quite apart from the experimental complexity involved in combining a large number of harmonics",
    ", the hhg experiment would be pointless if the high - order harmonics were available already in the driving pulse !",
    "as we will show in section [ s - hhg ] , sufficient gradient enhancement can be achieved with a driving pulse containing only two or three additional harmonic components .",
    "as described in the introduction , the bursts of xuv radiation produced in the electron ionization - recollision process that occurs when an intense few - cycle laser pulse interacts with an atom , contain a wide range of high - order harmonics .",
    "hhg experiments aiming to produce isolated attosecond bursts are typically based on few - cycle driving pulses , but a number of sophisticated techniques have also been deployed , including the use of two - color driving fields @xcite , polarization - gating @xcite , and chirp control @xcite .",
    "a typical hhg spectrum from an atomic gas consists of a broad plateau of harmonics extending to high orders , which falls off rapidly above a cut - off energy @xmath27 . for monochromatic driving fields @xcite ,   @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the ionization potential of the atom",
    ", @xmath30 is the ponderomotive potential of the laser field , and @xmath31 is the maximum field strength .",
    "the atom used for all the simulations in this paper was neon , which has a @xmath32 of @xmath33ev .",
    "( [ eq : e_mono ] ) suggests that @xmath27 can be increased either by increasing @xmath31 or by using an atomic species with a higher @xmath29 .",
    "however , raising @xmath31 also enhances the ionization rate , and this in turn can deplete the ground state , causing defocusing of the laser beam and a reduction in hhg .",

    "( [ eq : e_mono ] ) in the case of a monochromatic field . for electrons that both ionize and recombine at the position of the core ,   @xmath39    although a general interpretation of eqn .",
    "( [ e_sfa ] ) is complicated , the electron trajectories that are of most importance for hhg are those for which the initial momentum of the electron ( @xmath40 ) is close to zero . in this case , @xmath41 , so that eqn .",
    "( [ e_sfa ] ) simplifies to @xmath42 ^ 2/2 $ ] .",
    "usually @xmath43 is small , so it is broadly true to say that @xmath27 depends on the peak value of @xmath44 . and since the second time derivative of @xmath45 and , concomitantly , the first time derivative of @xmath46 tend to follow @xmath45 , the implication is that maximizing the _ gradient _ of the field will raise the allowed peak value of @xmath44 . since css - like pulses",
    "have strongly steepened field gradients , they should therefore produce hhg with a raised cut - off energy @xmath27 and an increased number of harmonics .      to create a two - color driving field , a second harmonic component",
    "is added so that   @xmath47 where we will assume that @xmath48 for simplicity .",
    "the addition of the second harmonic term causes inversion symmetry of the profile to be lost .",
    "if @xmath49 , the positive and negative lobes of the field have different peak amplitudes , leading to different levels of tunnel ionization on alternate half cycles , and associated variations in the intensity and cut - off of the hhg spectrum . on the other hand ,",
    "when @xmath50 , it is the positive and negative _ slopes _ of @xmath46 that differ , along with the positive and negative excursions of @xmath45 and @xmath51 .",
    "once again , the effect is to maximize @xmath27 every other half - cycle @xcite , but the effect is now substantially stronger than in the @xmath52 case .",
    "more complex fields can be synthesized by adding further harmonics , with each additional component providing a significant boost to the field gradient . however , as we shall see in subsection [ s - hhg - extra ] below , the benefits are eventually subject to the law of diminishing returns .",
    "pulse profiles containing even as well as odd harmonics invariably exhibit characteristics that alternate from one half - cycle to the next .",
    "this feature is clearly evident in fig .",
    "[ fig : waves - chi2-new ] where the wavelet transform of the hhg generated by a @xmath2 css - like pulse spectrally truncated above the sixth harmonic is displayed ; details are given in the caption .",
    "the figure should be compared with fig .",
    "[ fig : waves - normal - new ] . if a high - pass filter ( such as a molybdenum - silicon multilayer mirror ) is applied to the signal of fig .",
    "[ fig : waves - chi2-new ] , the lower peaks can be removed , leaving the highest peak(s ) in greater isolation .",
    "as such , these filters are useful for the generation of a single xuv burst , or when creating burst trains for stroboscopic imaging @xcite .      increasing",
    "the number of harmonics naturally increases the experimental complexity , and arranging for their correct phasing makes the situation even more complicated .",
    "it is therefore important to check that css - like pulses are better for hhg because of their steep field gradients , rather than simply because of their greater harmonic content .",
    "is the mere presence of many harmonics ( irrespective of their phase ) the crucial thing , or will a restricted range of harmonics , correctly phased to maximize the gradient , perhaps yield a better result with less experimental effort ? to address this issue , we compare hhg spectra for different types of driving pulse in fig .",
    "[ fig : attosec - spect - new ] .",
    "reading from top to bottom , spectra are shown for    : :     a synthesized css - like pulse containing third and fifth harmonics    ( labeled @xmath1 css ) ;  : :     a synthesized css - like pulse containing second , third and fourth    harmonics ( labeled @xmath2 css ) ;  : :     a `` field - maximized spectrum '' ( fms ) pulse containing identical    spectral content to the @xmath2 css pulse , but with    phases @xmath53 , to create a maximized field rather than    a maximized gradient ;  : :     a normal quasi - monochromatic pulse similar to the one used to create    fig .",
    "[ fig : waves - normal - new ] .",
    "the benefit of a gradient - maximized pulse over both the normal and fms pulses is demonstrated vividly in the figure .",
    "the highest @xmath27 is clearly obtained for the @xmath2 css pulse .",
    "further , a comparison of @xmath2 css , @xmath2 fms , and the normal spectra reveals that the css pulses have the most gradual cut - off .",
    "the conclusion is that optimum performance results from the character of the css profiles and not merely their harmonic content .",
    "[ fig - attosec ] shows the temporal profiles of attosecond xuv bursts obtained by appropriate filtering of the four hhg spectra of fig .",
    "[ fig : attosec - spect - new ] . in each case",
    ", the filtering was adjusted to minimize the full width at one _ quarter _ maximum , a procedure that created the cleanest pulses .",
    "it is clear that a @xmath2 css driving pulse produces the shortest and most isolated xuv bursts , although the intensity is lower than in the @xmath2 fms case where there is one strong and one weak burst per cycle .",
    "the @xmath1 css pulse produces _ two _ short xuv bursts per cycle , with a relatively high intensity .",
    "we note that the oscillations in the tails of the @xmath1 css spectra in fig .",
    "[ fig : attosec - spect - new ] are associated with the presence of more than one xuv burst , as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig - attosec ] .      as mentioned earlier ,",
    "moving from standard single - color to two - color pumping adds experimental complexity , and the situation will naturally be exacerbated if additional harmonics are included .",
    "it is therefore important to study how effectively the extra experimental investment is reflected in improved hhg performance",
    ".    figs .",
    "[ fig : synthesis2 ] and [ fig : synthesis3 ] demonstrate what happens when hhg is driven by @xmath2 and @xmath1 css - like pulses as the number of harmonic components is increased . in each case",
    ", there is clearly a strong initial reduction in the burst durations as extra harmonics are added .",
    "the fwhm decreases roughly linearly up to about the fifth harmonic , but the graphs flatten out thereafter .",
    "the intensity of the bursts drops off rapidly too , although this is not necessarily a serious consideration ; after all , much intensity is also lost in polarization - gating schemes .",
    "different filtering strategies ( e.g. allowing lower frequencies through ) can provide shorter xuv bursts than shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : synthesis2 ] , but this usually results in stronger satellite pulses .      the fact that @xmath2 css pulses succeed in maximizing the hhg cut - off energy @xmath27 at a given pulse energy is due to the way in which the particular electric field profile controls the motion of the ionized electrons . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : chi2schematic ] , the outward journey and initial deceleration of the electrons in group a are determined by the shallow ramp of the field as it rises gently from negative to positive .",
    "the high return acceleration is managed by the high - field region , and the subsequent steep field decrease allows the electrons to recollide with the core within minimal deceleration , whilst simultaneously resetting the field amplitude so that the process can repeat .",
    "the overall effect is to create trajectories that minimize the distance traveled , while ensuring the highest possible recollision energies along with a high @xmath27 .",
    "the high - energy recollisions take place largely during the brief high - gradient part of the field profile ; and give rise to the narrow peaks in fig .",
    "[ fig : waves - chi2-new ] , which then become the short duration xuv bursts of fig .",
    "[ fig - attosec ] after high - pass filtering .",
    "a genetic algorithm @xcite used in combination with classical simulations of electron trajectories , has confirmed that the sawtooth - like @xmath2 css profiles are uniquely efficient for hhg . using parametrized field profiles , we sought to optimize the recollision energy while holding both the pulse energy per cycle and the periodicity fixed .",
    "the algorithm consistently predicted that the optimum wave form was a linear ramp starting at a field @xmath54 and increasing to @xmath55 .",
    "this corresponds to the last three quarter - cycles of a sawtooth wave form ; indeed in fig .",
    "[ fig : chi2schematic ] we can see that sfa predictions for the css - enhanced trajectories agree with the classical picture and start at about a quarter cycle in . adding a dc bias or sufficiently low - frequency field to a @xmath2 css - like profile",
    "might therefore make fuller use of the whole ramp section of the wave form , further increasing @xmath27 .    a second family of ionization/ recollision trajectories ( group b in fig .",
    "[ fig : chi2schematic ] ) are initiated during the high - field region of the optical cycle .",
    "however , these recollisions occur in a region of lower field , produce lower recollision energies , and are spread over a longer time interval .",
    "they lead to more intense but longer hhg emission , with a low @xmath27 , represented by the broader and lower peaks in fig .",
    "[ fig : waves - chi2-new ] .    returning to figs .",
    "[ fig : synthesis2 ] and [ fig : synthesis3 ] , we see that the change in burst duration ( or intensity ) for each additional harmonic component is not necessarily straightforward or monotonic .",
    "this serves to illustrate that that hhg dynamics are complicated , and that the general principle of maximizing the field gradient could be optimized by further use of a genetic algorithm .",
    "indeed , any hhg model could be optimized for a specific outcome ",
    "e.g. for the shortest - duration xuv burst .",
    "it would also allow the potential benefits of spectral inputs other than the harmonic cascade used here to be evaluated .",
    "we have shown how to optimize hhg using gradient - gating of the interaction , and that css pulses ( or in practice their synthesized counterparts ) are the most efficient way of providing the localized steep field gradients needed .",
    "an important conclusion is that the gradient - gated hhg enhancement can be achieved using as few as three or four correctly phased extra harmonic components .",
    "the study was assisted by our generalized theory of optical carrier - wave self - steepening . by describing wave forms generated by a @xmath2 nonlinear interaction ,",
    "the theory showed how their advantageous symmetry properties could be used to generate shorter , more isolated xuv bursts . by using a genetic algorithm with selection based on the recollision energy of classical electrons",
    ", we confirmed that indeed the sawtooth - like @xmath2 css pulses do have an optimal form that increased the hhg cut - off energy @xmath27 for any given pulse energy .    in summary",
    ", we have shown that the use of css - like driving pulses for hhg has the potential to generate shorter , more isolated xuv bursts , as well as suggesting possibilities for other hhg optimization schemes .",
    "our starting point is the pair of 1d sourceless , plane polarized maxwell s equations for a field propagating in the @xmath3 direction , namely : @xmath56 where @xmath57 , @xmath58 and @xmath59 are the electric , magnetic and electrical displacement fields respectively .",
    "we neglect the tensor nature of the nonlinear coefficients since the polarization of the generated field can be the same as that of the incoming field in some situations . under these circumstances , and writing @xmath60 for convenience , we have :   @xmath61 where @xmath5 refers to the @xmath6-th order nonlinear susceptibility of the medium , which is assumed to be instantaneous .",

    "the objective is to turn a first - order partial differential equation ( pde ) into an ordinary differential equation by changing the co - ordinates . in our case , the second - order pde in eqn .",
    "( [ eq : waves ] ) separates into two first - order pdes .",
