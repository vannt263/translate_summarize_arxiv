    "since many years different alternative approaches to gravity have been proposed in the literature such as mond @xcite , scalar - tensor @xcite , conformal @xcite , yukawa - like corrected gravity theories @xcite , and so on ( see papers @xcite for reviews ) .",
    "very recently , it has been proposed @xcite , in the framework of higher order theories of gravity  also referred to as @xmath0 theories  a modification of the gravity action with the form    @xmath1,\\ ] ]    where @xmath0 is a generic function of the ricci scalar curvature and @xmath2 is the standard matter lagrangian .",
    "for example , if @xmath3 the theory coincides with general relativity ( gr ) with the @xmath4 term .",
    "in particular , @xcite considered power law function @xmath0 theories of the form @xmath5 . as a result , in the weak field limit @xcite",
    ", the gravitational potential is found to be @xcite : @xmath6~ , \\label{potential}\\ ] ] where @xmath7     as a function of @xmath8 for fourth order gravity.,scaledwidth=70.0% ]    the dependence of the @xmath9 parameter on the @xmath8 power is shown in fig .",
    "[ beta_dependence ] . of course , for @xmath10 it follows @xmath11 , while for @xmath12 the parameter @xmath9 reduces to zero and the newtonian gravitational field is recovered . on the other hand , while @xmath9 is a universal parameter , @xmath13 in principle is an arbitrary parameter , depending on the considered system and its typical scale .",
    "consider for example the sun as the source of the gravitational field and the earth as the test particle .",
    "since earth velocity is @xmath14 km s@xmath15 , it has been found that the parameter @xmath13 varies in the range @xmath16 au .",
    "once @xmath13 and @xmath9 has been fixed , @xcite used them to study deviations from the standard paczynski light curve for gravitational microlensing @xcite and claimed that the implied deviation can be measured  @xcite .",
    "it is clear that for gravitational microlensing one could detect observational differences between gr and an alternative theory ( the fourth order gravity in particular ) , so that one should have different potentials at the scale @xmath17 ( the einstein radius ) of the gravitational microlensing . for the galactic microlensing case",
    "@xmath17 is about 1 au .",
    "this is a reason why the authors @xcite have selected @xmath13 at a level of astronomical units to obtain observable signatures for non - vanishing @xmath9 .",
    "the aim of the present paper is to show that solar system data ( light bending and planetary periods ) put extremely strong constraints on both @xmath13 and @xmath9 parameters making this alternative theory of gravity not so attracting .",
    "as stated above , we now discuss some observational consequences of the fourth order gravity , depending on the choice of the parameters @xmath9 and @xmath13 .",
    "a constraint on the proposed theory can be derived by considering the light bending effect in the sun limb .",
    "it is well - known that in the parameterized post - newtonian formalism the bending angle through which a electromagnetic light ray from a distant source is deflected by a body with mass @xmath18 is @xcite @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the impact parameter , @xmath21 is the solar elongation angle ( between the sun and the source as viewed from earth ) and @xmath22 is the post - newtonian parameter . for gr , @xmath23 and for light rays at sun s limb , @xmath24 .",
    "recently , @xcite measured the bending angles for distant compact sources and concluded that light bending angles follow gr with a very high precision ( @xmath25 ) .",
    "in other words , this means that the deflection of the light path is well described by the gr theory .",
    "in particular , as radio observations of distant sources have shown @xcite , the observed and expected bending angles are related by @xmath26 . in the framework of the fourth order gravity theory , the deflection angle of light rays at sun s limb depends on both the parameters @xmath9 and @xmath13 .",
    "we explore this dependence in fig .",
    "[ deflection ] , by requiring that the expected value for the bending angle is , at least , within @xmath27 ( grey region ) or within @xmath28 ( light grey region ) the observed value .",
    "inspecting the same figure , it is clear that only @xmath9-values nearby zero ( corresponding to a completely arbitrariness of @xmath13 ) are consistent with the observed deflection angles .",
    "we therefore emphasize that @xmath9-values considered in @xcite and @xcite ( i.e. @xmath29 ) are ruled out by light deflection data .     and",
    "@xmath13 ) arising from the deflection angle of light rays close to the solar limb .",
    "the grey and light grey regions embed the part of the parameter space allowed by solar system observations at the @xmath27 and @xmath28 confidence level , respectively .",
    "it is noticing that for scale reason we have not plotted values of @xmath13 up to @xmath30 au .",
    "for these cases , the observations can be restored only for @xmath31.,scaledwidth=70.0% ]      a stronger constraint on the fourth order gravity theory can be obtained from the motion of the solar system planets .",
    "let us consider as a toy model a planet moving on circular orbit ( of radius @xmath32 ) around the sun . from eq .",
    "( [ potential ] ) , the planet acceleration @xmath33 is given by @xmath34~. \\label{accel}\\ ] ] accordingly , the planetary circular velocity @xmath35 can be evaluated and , in turn , the orbital period @xmath36 is given by @xmath37^{-1/2}~ , \\label{period}\\ ] ] where @xmath38^{1/2}$ ] is the usual keplerian period . in order to compare the orbital period predicted by the fourth order theory with the solar system observations , let us define the quantity @xmath39 being @xmath40 the factor appearing on the right hand side of equation ( [ period ] ) and multiplying the usual keplerian period .",
    "there is a question about a possibility to satisfy the planetary period condition  vanishing the eq .",
    "( [ factor ] )  with @xmath9 parameter which is significantly different from zero .",
    "vanishing the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ factor ] ) we obtain the relation @xmath41 so that eq .",
    "( [ factor2 ] ) should be satisfied for all the planetary radii .",
    "this is obviously impossible since the fourth order theory defines @xmath9 as a parameter , while the specific system under consideration ( the solar system in our case ) allows us to specify the @xmath13 parameter .",
    "hence the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ factor2 ] ) is fixed for the solar system , implying that it is impossible to satisfy eq .",
    "( [ factor2 ] ) even with two ( or more ) different planetary radii .    ) is given , as a function of @xmath9 , in the case of mercury ( dashed line ) , venus ( dotted line ) , earth ( solid line ) for different @xmath13 ( it is clear that @xmath42 for @xmath43 ) . if @xmath44 there is @xmath45 satisfying eq .  ( [ factor2 ] ) , but the @xmath9 values depend on fixed @xmath13 and @xmath32 and they are different for a fixed @xmath13 and different @xmath32 , so that it is impossible to satisfy eq .",
    "( [ factor2 ] ) if the number of planets is more than one .",
    "moreover , if we have at least one radius @xmath46 , there is no solution of eq .",
    "( [ factor2 ] ) . ]    just for illustration we present the function @xmath40 as a dependence on @xmath9 parameter for fixed @xmath13 and planetary radii @xmath32 ( see fig . [ planets ] ) . as one can see from eq .",
    "( [ factor2 ] ) ( and fig .  [ planets ]",
    "as well ) for each planetary radius @xmath44 there is @xmath45 satisfying eq .",
    "( [ factor2 ] ) , but the @xmath9 value depends on fixed @xmath13 and @xmath32 , so that they are different for a fixed @xmath13 and different @xmath32 .",
    "moreover , if we have at least one radius @xmath47 , there is no solution of eq .",
    "( [ factor2 ] ) .",
    "both cases imply that the @xmath9 parameter should be around zero .    in fig .",
    "[ figperiods ] ( left panel ) , the factor @xmath40 is given as a function of @xmath9 for the two limiting values of @xmath13 , @xmath48  au ( dashed line ) and @xmath49  au ( solid line ) , considered in @xcite .",
    "as one can note , only for @xmath9 approaching zero it is expected to recover the value of the keplerian period . in the above mentioned figure",
    ", the calculation has been performed for the earth orbit ( i.e. @xmath50 au ) .",
    "current observations allow also to evaluate the distances between the sun and the planets of the solar system with a great accuracy .",
    "in particular , differences in the heliocentric distances do not exceed 10 km for jupiter and amount to 180 , 410 , 1200 and 14000 km for saturn , uranus , neptune and pluto , respectively @xcite .",
    "errors in the semi - major axes of the inner planets are even smaller ( see e.g. table 2 in @xcite ) so that the relative error in the orbital period determination is extremely low . as an example",
    ", the orbital period of earth is @xmath51 days with an error of @xmath52 days , corresponding to a relative error of @xmath53 less than @xmath54 .",
    "these values can be used in order to constrain the possible values of both the parameters @xmath9 and @xmath13 introduced by the fourth order gravity theory . this can be done by requiring that @xmath55 so that , in the case of earth , @xmath56 which can be solved with respect to @xmath9 once the @xmath13 parameter has been fixed to some value . for @xmath57  au and @xmath58  au ( i.e. the two limiting cases considered by @xcite ) we find the allowed upper limits on the @xmath9 parameter to be @xmath59 and @xmath60 , respectively ( since @xmath61/4 $ ] ) .",
    "these results can also be inferred from the middle and right panels of fig .",
    "[ figperiods ] .     is given as a function of @xmath9 ( left panel ) for the two limiting values of @xmath13 , @xmath48 au ( dashed line ) and @xmath49 au ( solid line ) , respectively .",
    "as one can note , only for @xmath9 approaching 0 it is expected to recover the value of the keplerian period . here",
    ", the calculation have been performed at earth ( i.e. @xmath50 au ) . in the middle and right panel , the quantity @xmath62 is given as a function of @xmath9 for @xmath58 au and @xmath57 au .",
    "note that only for values of @xmath9 close to @xmath63 the solar system observation can be restored ( see text for more details ) . ]    a more precise analysis which takes into account the planetary semi - major axes and eccentricities leads to variations of at most a few percent with respect to the results in fig .",
    "[ figperiods ] , since the planetary orbits are nearly circular .",
    "therefore , in spite of the fact that orbital periods of planets are not generally used to test alternative theories of gravity ( since it is taken for granted that the weak field approximation of these theories gives the newtonian limit ) , we found that these data are important to constrain parameters of the fourth order gravity theory .",
    "gr and newtonian theory ( as its weak field limit ) were verified by a very precise way at different scales .",
    "there are observational data which constrain parameters of alternative theories as well . as a result , the parameter @xmath9 of fourth order gravity should be very close to zero ( it means that the gravitational theory should be very close to gr ) . in particular , the @xmath9 parameter values considered for microlensing @xcite , for rotation curves @xcite and cosmological sn type ia @xcite are ruled out by solar system data .",
    "no doubt that one could also derive further constraints on the fourth order gravity theory by analyzing other physical phenomena such as shapiro time delay , frequency shift of radio photons @xcite , laser ranging for distant objects in the solar system , deviations of trajectories of celestial bodies from ellipses , parabolas and hyperbolas and so on .",
    "but our aim was only to show that only @xmath64 values are not in contradiction with solar system data in spite of the fact that there are a lot of speculations to fit observational data with @xmath9 values significantly different from zero .",
