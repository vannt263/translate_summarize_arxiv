    "models for fluids with only repulsive interactions have been studied in the literature for quite a long time @xcite , both on a lattice and in the continuum .",
    "although attractive interactions are essential to produce liquid - gas transitions , models with only repulsive interactions may show transitions which resemble the melting of a solid phase .",
    "if the repulsive interactions are of the hard - core excluded volume type , all allowed configurations of the system have the same energy and thus the model is athermal .",
    "the continuous versions of these models are known as hard sphere models , and a fluid - solid transition was found in their phase diagram .",
    "it is worth recalling that in the seminal work by metropolis et al . , where monte carlo simulations were introduced , the hard sphere gas was studied @xcite .",
    "athermal lattice models with excluded volume interactions have also been widely studied before . in these models",
    "the localization of particles is constrained to sites of a lattice . a model where a particle excludes others from only its site corresponds to an ising lattice gas without the interaction term , and no phase transition",
    "if a particle placed on a site of the square lattice excludes other particles from its four first neighbor sites , at low densities the sites of both sublattices are equally occupied , but as the density is increased one of the sublattices will be preferentially occupied by the particles .",
    "one may associate the disordered low density phase to a fluid and the ordered phase to a solid , so that the transition may be seen as a melting of a solid phase .",
    "this model has been thoroughly investigated by a variety of techniques @xcite .",
    "on the square lattice , the universality class of the transition was object of some discussion in the literature @xcite .",
    "accurate estimates of the thermodynamic behavior of the model using transfer matrix and finite - size scaling techniques show a continuous transition between the disordered and the ordered phase , which is in the ising universality class @xcite , as one should expect from symmetry considerations .",
    "this model may be generalized by increasing the range of the excluded volume interactions , and discontinuous phase transitions are found if this range is large enough .",
    "we refer to recent simulational investigations of this family of models where comprehensive surveys of the literature may be found @xcite . although the transfer matrix formalism may lead to precise estimates for the critical behavior of such athermal models , monte carlo methods with cluster algorithms may also furnish good results . as examples , we mention the ising lattice gas with first neighbor exclusion on the cubic @xcite and triangular @xcite lattices .    here",
    "we consider another generalization of the lattice gas with first neighbor exclusion , introducing also small particles which exclude only the site they occupy .",
    "this mixed lattice gas was studied , using series expansion techniques on the square lattice , by poland @xcite .",
    "he found evidences for a tricritical point in the phase diagram of the model : while for low densities of small particles the transition is continuous , it becomes discontinuous as the density is increased .",
    "a slight modification of this model , where the large particles occupy elementary squares of the lattice and the small particles are located on the center of edges , has been exactly solved in the grand canonical formalism . in a particular case of this model ,",
    "when the fugacities of the small ( @xmath0 ) and large ( @xmath1 ) particles obey the relation @xmath2 , frenkel and louis were able to show that it may be mapped on the ising model with vanishing magnetic field and thus its solution in two dimensions is known @xcite .",
    "it should be mentioned that the fact that a model very similar to the original can be mapped on the ising model at a particular point of the critical line is a strong additional evidence that the transition is in the ising universality class . in particular , for @xmath3 the frenkel - louis model corresponds to the model with only large particles when their fugacity is unitary .",
    "a variant of this model was proposed and studied by lin and taylor @xcite . in this model ,",
    "the small particles are triangles such that one of their sides occupies an edge of the lattice and the opposite vertex is located at the center of an elementary square , so that up to four small particles may be placed in an elementary square of the lattice .",
    "if finite interaction energies between the large ( square ) particles on first - neighbor sites and between large ( square ) and small ( triangle ) particles which share a lattice edge are introduced , this model shows a lower critical solution point .",
    "we also notice that a decorated lattice model for hydrogen - bonded mixtures which can be mapped on the three - dimensional ising model and which shows both upper and lower critical solution points has been studied by wheeler and anderson @xcite .",
    "more recently , the solution in the grand - canonical formalism of the model on a bethe lattice with arbitrary coordination number was obtained @xcite .",
    "the general features of the phase diagram are consistent with the findings of poland @xcite . in the parameter space defined by the two activities @xmath1 and @xmath0 of large and small particles , respectively ,",
    "a continuous transition is found for small values of @xmath0 , and it becomes discontinuous if @xmath0 is sufficiently large . since the slope of the critical line is negative at low values of @xmath0 , becoming positive at higher values , a re - entrant behavior of the transition is seen in this region of the phase diagram . at even higher values of the activity of small particles ,",
    "the transition becomes discontinuous and thus a tricritical point is found .",
    "another interesting feature of the model is that the isobaric curves , where the total density of particles is considered as a function of the density or the activity of small particles , shows a minimum in the fluid phase .",
    "we recall that perhaps the most studied situation in nature where a density anomaly is found happens in water close to the freezing point , where a maximum of the isobaric curves of the density as a function of the temperature is seen .",
    "the bethe lattice solution of the mixed lattice gas model leads to a minimum of the density as a function of another field - like thermodynamic variable : the activity of small particles .",
    "although the physical situation in water is of course quite distinct from the model we study here , it is noteworthy that several recent studies of simple effective models for water suggest that the density anomaly may be due to effective interparticle interaction potentials with two length scales @xcite , a feature which is also present in the mixed lattice gas model .    through transfer matrix and finite - size scaling calculations ,",
    "we show here that the thermodynamic behavior of the model on the square lattice is qualitatively the same found in the bethe lattice solution .",
    "our results suggest that the critical line is in ising universality class , similarly to the model with large particles only , and that the tricritical point belongs to the tricritical ising ( blume - emery - griffiths - beg ) class .    in sec .",
    "[ defmt ] , we define the model more precisely and describe its transfer matrix solution on strips of finite widths , for both periodic and helical boundary conditions .",
    "we also discuss the factorization of this transfer matrix in a product of sparse matrices , which reduces the computational effort to handle them .",
    "our results for the phase transitions and other thermodynamic properties of the model in the two - dimensional limit may be found in sec .",

    "the partially overlapping dot - dashed boxes are the states ( @xmath7 and @xmath8)for helical boundary conditions , and the corresponding matrix element is @xmath9 , since a single empty site is added.,width=321 ]    we will use the transfer matrix formalism to study the model with both particles placed on a square lattice",
    ". this will be accomplished by solving the model on strips of finite width @xmath10 . for periodic boundary conditions ,",
    "the states of the transfer matrix will be defined by the configuration of the @xmath10 lattice sites in the same row of a cylinder . as an example , for @xmath11 we have a total of 26 states , but this number reduces to 9 if the rotation symmetry is considered .",
    "these states , with their multiplicity indicated between curly brackets , are : @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , and @xmath20 . in our notation",
    ", @xmath21 represents an empty site , while @xmath9 and @xmath22 correspond to sites occupied by small and large particles , respectively . to avoid frustration in the solid phase ,",
    "we restrict ourselves to even widths .",
    "the transfer matrix is obtained considering two adjacent rows of @xmath10 sites in a particular configuration of particles and checking if the excluded volume interactions are satisfied .",
    "if this is the case , the corresponding element of the transfer matrix will be given by @xmath23 , where @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the total numbers of small and large particles in both rows , respectively , and @xmath26 is the number of ways ( considering the excluded volume ) of placing the row @xmath27 over the row @xmath28 , by keeping @xmath28 fixed and rotating @xmath27 . defining the matrix elements in this way assures that the transfer matrix is hermitian . for @xmath11 ,",
    "some elements of the transfer matrix , with the states ordered as presented above , are given by : @xmath29    besides adopting periodic boundary conditions , we also considered helical boundary conditions , where the rightmost site of a row is linked to the leftmost site of the row above .",
    "both boundary conditions are illustrated in fig .",
    "as happens for periodic boundary conditions , for helical boundary conditions , the states are determined by the configuration of two sets of @xmath10 sites , where the second one is shifted by one site only to the right of the first set , as is also shown in fig .",
    "thus , while for periodic boundary conditions at each application of the transfer matrix @xmath10 new sites are added to the lattice , for in the helical case a single site is added .",
    "this has the advantage of leading to a sparser matrix , since @xmath30 sites of both configurations are coincident . in fig .",
    "[ bc ] , two successive site sets , used to define the transfer matrix elements for helical boundary conditions , are enclosed by dashed and dotted rectangles .",
    "the numbers of states for lattices of successive widths are related by simple recursion relations .",
    "let us call @xmath31 the number of states in a strip of width @xmath10 and free boundary conditions , such that the first site is in the configuration @xmath32 and the last site in the configuration @xmath33 .",
    "since @xmath34 , we have a total of 9 of these numbers of configurations , where 6 are independent due to reflection symmetry .",
    "the total number of configurations will be @xmath35 , for free boundary conditions .",
    "for periodic boundary conditions , the occupancy of the sites @xmath9 and @xmath10 should obey the excluded volume constraint , so that the number of states in this case will be given by @xmath36 , where the prime restricts the sum to terms such that @xmath37 .",
    "the numbers of states obey a set of nine linear recursion relations :    @xmath38    iterating these recursion relations with the starting values @xmath39 , we may obtain the numbers of states for increasing values of the widths for both boundary conditions , which are shown in tab .",
    "the states for helical boundary conditions coincide with the ones for free boundary conditions .",
    "it is easy to reduce these recursion relations to a single one : @xmath40 with the remaining numbers of states being given by @xmath41 , and @xmath42 .",
    "the characteristic polynomial associated to the linear recursion relation ( [ rr1 ] ) will be : @xmath43 , which has three real roots .",
    "although of course the roots may be found analytically , we will not give the expressions here since they are rather long .",
    "the approximate numerical values are @xmath44 , @xmath45 , and @xmath46 .",
    "therefore , in general , we have that : @xmath47 where the coefficients are determined by the initial conditions . to obtain the actual numbers of states for finite widths , it is more practical to iterate the recursion relations directly , but explicit expressions such at ( [ ns1 ] ) are useful to obtain the asymptotic number of states for @xmath48 , which is dominated by the leading root of the characteristic equation , @xmath49 .",
    "the coefficient of this asymptotic behavior will be different for free and periodic boundary conditions .",
    "this may be compared with the result for the model with large particles only , where we have , for periodic boundary conditions @xcite , that the numbers of states @xmath50 are given by a fibonacci sequence starting with 1 and 3 @xmath51^l   \\approx   1.6180 ^l$ ] .",

    "these curves may be obtained fixing the value of the dominant eigenvalue of the transfer matrix ( this corresponds to a fixed value of the pressure ) , so that @xmath1 and @xmath56 may be found as functions of @xmath0 . since at larger widths",
    "the finite size effects in these calculations are rather small , we have done them for strips of width @xmath57 without extrapolations .",
    "the locations of these minima originate a curve similar to the temperature of maximal density ( tmd ) curve delimiting the density anomaly in water - like fluids @xcite , so we will call these minima as md ( minimal density ) points .",
    "notice that in the case of water , the curves which exhibit a maximum are the isobars of the density as a function of the temperature .",
    "here we also have isobars , but the density is expressed as a function of an activity , which is also a field - like variable in the thermodynamic sense , or of the conjugated density , which is a monotonic function of the activity . the md curves seem to start at @xmath58 as @xmath59 and then they are increasing functions of @xmath0 .",
    "although it is very difficult to calculate the minima close to the tricritical point , it seems that the curves end exactly at this point . for small @xmath0 ,",
    "the md s obtained for different strip sizes have negligible corrections , but close to the tricritical point they present an appreciable @xmath10-dependence .",

    "this is expected , since the classical value of the tricritical exponent associated to the behavior of the order parameter @xmath56 is @xmath62 and the estimates for this exponent in two dimensions , one below the upper tricritical dimension @xmath63 , is smaller than 1 @xcite .",

    "the model with only large particles is well studied in the literature @xcite and displays a continuous transition between a fluid phase where sites of the lattice are occupied at random to a solid phase where one of the two sub - lattices is preferentially occupied by the particles .",

    "the phase diagrams we found both in activity variables and densities spaces are qualitatively similar to the ones we found before in the bethe lattice solution @xcite , but some characteristics close to the tricritical point are distinct , since at two dimensions non - classical tricritical exponents are expected , leading to changes as compared to the mean - field behavior , as was discussed above .",
    "it is interesting to compare our results with the ones obtained by poland using high density series expansions @xcite .",
    "our estimate for the density of small particles at the tc point ( @xmath67 ) is higher than the value obtained by poland ( @xmath68 ) , but our estimate for the density of large particles at this point ( @xmath69 ) is consistent with the one he found ( @xmath70 ) .",

    "thus , the same re - entrant behavior found in the bethe lattice solution of the model @xcite is also found in our results for the square lattice .",
    "this shows that , when their density is low , the small particles facilitate the ordering of the large ones - namely , they acts as an effective entropic attractive force among the large particles - regardless the structure of the underlying lattice .",
    "it may be mentioned that in a study of the isotropic - nematic transition for polydisperse rods , the critical curve also has a non - monotonic behavior in the space of two fugacities , although the mean length of the rods changes monotonically along the curve @xcite .",
    "our estimates for the central charge are consistent with the ising universality class on the whole critical line , in accordance with the very precise results obtained with similar techniques by guo and blte for the model at the particular point of the critical line with large particles only @xcite and with results of a similar model which may be mapped , in a particular case , on the ising model @xcite .",
