    "the prevalence of black holes in present - day galaxy bulges , and the proportionality between black hole and spheroid mass @xcite implies that the formation of the stars in a present - day galaxy spheroid was fundamentally connected to the growth of the black hole as an active galactic nucleus ( agn ) .",
    "in fact , an evolutionary connection between the star - forming and agn - dominated phases of galaxies has long been posited ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "it is now known that a significant fraction of cosmic star formation took place in submillimetre galaxies ( smgs ) : dusty , ultraluminous , and highly obscured galaxies at high redshift @xcite .",
    "although some distant qsos have been detected as submillimetre sources in pointed observations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the overlap between the qso and smg populations is relatively small @xcite . in an attempt to uncover the relationship between quasi - stellar objects ( qsos ) and smgs , @xcite observed matched samples of x - ray absorbed and unabsorbed qsos at 850@xmath4 m with scuba .",
    "these observations revealed a remarkable dichotomy in the submillimetre properties of these two groups of sources : a substantial fraction ( @xmath2 50 per cent ) of x - ray absorbed qsos are submillimetre galaxies , while x - ray unabsorbed ( i.e. normal ) qsos are not .",
    "this suggests that the two types are linked by an evolutionary sequence , in which the x - ray absorbed qsos correspond to the transition between the main star - forming phase and the qso phase of a massive galaxy @xcite . the space density and luminosities of the x - ray absorbed qsos",
    "indicate that this transitional phase is relatively brief , @xmath215 per cent of the duration of the luminous qso phase .",
    "however , the physical driver for this transition between obscured star - forming galaxy and luminous qso is unknown .",
    "furthermore , the nature of the x - ray absorption in the x - ray absorbed qsos remains puzzling .",
    "these objects are characterised by hard , absorbed x - ray spectra , but they have optical / uv spectra which are typical for qsos , with broad emission lines and blue continua . assuming that their hard x - ray spectral shapes result from photoelectric absorption from cold material with solar abundances , the column densities are of order @xmath5  @xmath6 .",
    "the x - ray absorption could be due to gas located within the agn structure , or from more distant material in the host galaxy . wherever the absorber is located",
    ", it appears to contain very little dust : for a galactic gas / dust ratio , the restframe ultraviolet spectra would be heavily attenuated by such large columns of material .    therefore in order to investigate the x - ray absorption in these objects , we have obtained deep ( 50100ks ) _ xmm - newton _  observations of five x - ray absorbed qsos from our sample of hard - spectrum _ rosat _ sources @xcite that were detected as powerful submillimetre sources with scuba @xcite .    throughout this paper",

    "we restrict the reference sample to those rixos qsos at @xmath76 , which corresponds to a similar luminosity range to our x - ray - absorbed qso sample , because rixos has a similar x - ray flux limit to the _ rosat _  hard spectrum survey from which our targets were drawn .",

    "indeed , this value of @xmath48 is larger than any @xmath48 in the rixos reference sample or the sdss sample of @xcite , suggesting that the model with a cold absorber and the continuum slope fitted as a free parameter would also require a highly unusual spectral energy distribution for rxj124913 . while rxj094144has rather typical values of @xmath48 in table  [",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; indicating that the ionized absorbers lie within the ionization cones of the agn , assuming the standard agn geometric unification scheme in which the central regions are surrounded by a dusty , obscuring torus @xcite .",
    "the presence of ionized absorption within our x - ray absorbed qsos is therefore in keeping with a normal pole - on orientation for these objects .",
    "the ionized column densities , and the degree of soft x - ray attenuation , of our x - ray absorbed qsos are considerably higher than are found in the majority of nearby seyferts : with the exception of rxj163308  for which the x - ray absorber properties are poorly constrained , all of our sample have best fit log  @xmath39 @xmath85 , whereas only 3 of the 23 agn in the sample studied by @xcite , have log  @xmath39 @xmath85 .",
    "nonetheless , a few nearby objects such as ngc3783 do have comparable column densities and ionization states @xcite .",
    "the ionized absorbers in seyferts typically contain ions covering a large range of ionization , and where good data are available they almost always require multiple phases with different ionization parameters to model their spectra @xcite . moving to higher luminosity objects ,",
    "ionized absorbers appear to be common in qsos , with the studies of @xcite and @xcite suggesting that around 50 per cent of low redshift qsos show some evidence for ionized absorption in their x - ray spectra . however , column densities of ionized material similar to those found in our sample of x - ray absorbed qsos are relatively rare , with @xcite finding that only 2 of their sample of 40 nearby qsos have ionized absorbers with best fit log  @xmath39 @xmath85 . in the small number of nearby qsos which have well - characterised ionized absorbers with @xmath86@xmath6 , notably pg1114 + 445 @xcite , pds456 @xcite , h@xmath87 @xcite , and pg1211 + 143 @xcite ,",
    "the absorbers are found to have multiple ionization phases , in common with the well - studied seyfert warm absorbers .    on this basis",
    ", we can expect that the parameters determined for the single phase absorbers in our sources are therefore likely to be representative only of the dominant phase of absorption , and the high-@xmath88 absorption which we have detected is likely to be accompanied by significant soft x - ray absorption due to material with log @xmath89 .",
    "in fact the multi - ionization - phase nature of the ionized absorbers is implied by the absorption lines detected in their uv spectra .",
    "the best fit ionized x - ray absorber models for all 5 objects produce insignificant civ absorption lines ( ew @xmath90 ) , in contrast to the large ew lines ( @xmath1 ) that are measured in their rest - frame uv spectra , implying that at least two ionization phases of absorber are required to produce both uv and x - ray absorption . note that while absorption from civ is seen in about half of qsos @xcite , civ absorption lines with equivalent widths @xmath1  are relatively rare .",
    "only 3 out of 114 non - bal qsos studied by @xcite show civ absorption with such large ew . combined with the statistic that @xmath2 15 percent of qsos have civ bals , which by definition have civ ew @xmath1@xcite we can conservatively estimate the incidence of civ absorption lines with ew@xmath1  to be 20 per cent .",
    "the probability of all 5 of our x - ray absorbed qsos having such absorption lines if they were drawn randomly from the population is therefore @xmath91 , and hence the connection of the civ absorbers with the x - ray absorption is quite secure .",
    "our finding that the x - ray absorbers in our sample are highly ionized allows us to address the puzzling absence of strong uv attenuation by dust , despite the large column densities of x - ray absorbing gas .",
    "1 galaxies with warm absorbers also show this property : the column densities of x - ray absorbing gas can be large but they have bright ultraviolet continua with broad emission lines , e.g. ngc3783 has @xmath92 @xcite as well as a strong uv continuum and broad uv emission lines with little reddening @xcite .    as a corollary to the apparent similarity between the ionized absorbers found in our x - ray absorbed qsos and some nearby seyferts , we might wonder whether star formation is associated with such x - ray absorption in objects such as ngc3783 , as it is in x - ray absorbed qsos .",
    "a systematic investigation of this issue is beyond the scope of this paper , but it is interesting to note that ngc3783 has a 2 - 10 kev x - ray luminosity of @xmath93  ergs  s@xmath8 and an infrared luminosity of @xmath94  l@xmath95 @xcite , so that if we scaled its sed to match the x - ray luminosities of our x - ray absorbed qsos its infrared luminosity would be in the regime of ultraluminous infrared galaxies , commensurate with a substantial star formation rate .",
    "it is interesting to compare the x - ray absorbed qsos with another population of unusual qsos : those that are classified as soft x - ray weak .",
    "these objects are characterised by large values of @xmath96 , and represent around 10% of optically selected qsos @xcite .",
    "@xcite found a strong correlation between @xmath96 and the equivalent width of civ absorption , which is found to be @xmath97  in the majority of soft x - ray weak qsos .",
    "this was interpreted by @xcite as evidence that soft x - ray weak qsos are such because they are absorbed in the soft x - ray band . as shown in section [ sec : uvlines ] , the qsos in our sample all have civ absorption lines with ew@xmath98 , similar to the civ lines found in soft x - ray weak qsos .",
    "more recently , _",
    "xmm - newton _  observations of soft x - ray weak qsos have indicated that this absorption is primarily due to ionized gas @xcite , with ionization parameters ranging from log  @xmath99 to log  @xmath100 and column densities ranging from @xmath101  @xmath6 to @xmath102  @xmath6 .",
    "these column densities and ionization parameters are remarkably similar to those of our x - ray absorbed qsos .",
    "given these similarities , we might expect that intense star formation would be as common in soft x - ray weak qsos as it is in x - ray absorbed qsos . to our knowledge",
    "there has been no systematic study of the star formation rates in soft x - ray weak qsos , but there are certainly well known examples of soft x - ray weak qsos which are rapidly forming stars , notably mrk  231 and iras  @xmath33 @xcite .",
    "we now consider the location , physical nature , and implications of the ionized absorbers found in our sample . to estimate the location we assume that the absorber is in the form of an outflowing wind originating at a distance @xmath103 from the continuum source with density @xmath104 . from the definition of the ionization parameter @xmath105 where @xmath106 is the 1 - 1000 rydberg ionizing luminosity in erg  s@xmath8 ,",
    "such a wind will have an ionization parameter @xmath88 that is constant with radius @xmath107 . to take account that the winds from agn are likely to be clumpy or filamentary , we characterise the outflow with a macroscopic volume filling factor @xmath108 .",
    "the column density of the absorber is dominated by material close to the base of the outflow , and hence @xmath103 can be taken as the characteristic distance of the absorber from the continuum source . integrating the density along the line of sight ,",

    "we see that @xmath103 is in all cases smaller than , or consistent with , @xmath121",
    ".    it would therefore be natural to assume that the absorbers originate in the agn themselves , rather than in their host galaxies .",
    "this solution is attractive , because it is compatible with the lack of optical extinction in these objects : if the absorber is driven as a wind , either from the accretion disc or from evaporation of the inner edge of the molecular torus , then dust will be sublimated before ( or as ) it enters the flow . with this in mind , it is instructive to obtain upper limits for the distance of the absorbing gas from the nucleus at which it could remain ionized by the agn radiation field , using equation [ eq : rabs ] and taking the limit case of filling factor @xmath122 . doing so , we find that the x - ray absorbers in rxj094144 , rxj121803  and rxj124913  must lie within a few hundred parsecs of the ionizing source , within or close to the agn rather than being distributed throughout the host galaxy .",

    "we can obtain the mass outflow rate of the wind using equation 18 from @xcite : @xmath132 where @xmath133 is the rest mass of a proton and @xmath134 is the outflow velocity , and @xmath135 is the solid angle of the outflow . combining equations [ eq : ion ] and [ eq : blustin ] we obtain : @xmath136 we take @xmath137 and as before we assume @xmath138 .",
    "we take the opening angle of the outflow @xmath139 steradians , corresponding to the opening angle of the torus inferred from the type 1 / type 2 number ratio in nearby seyferts @xcite . for the velocity @xmath134",
    "we assume that the x - ray absorbing ionized outflow is associated with the fastest outflow identified in the restframe ultraviolet ( table [ tab : uvlines ] ) .",
    "this is a reasonable estimate , since the highest ionization absorbers are typically ( though not always ) the highest velocity systems in individual seyfert galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "at the same time it is a conservative estimate ( i.e. may underestimate the mass outflow rate ) for two reasons : firstly , the signal to noise ratios of our optical spectra ( particularly for rxj094144  and rxj121803 ) are not high enough that we can be confident we have identified all of the absorption line systems , and secondly our estimates of the systemic velocities are based on the uv broad emission lines , which themselves are frequently observed to have a net outflow velocity of order 1000 km  s@xmath8 @xcite .",
    "the derived values of log  _ m_@xmath140_m_@xmath123 are listed in table [ tab : physics ] . in the case of rxj094144 , the civ absorption line that is identified in the rest - frame uv spectrum is redshifted with respect to the uv emission lines ,",
    "so its true velocity with respect to the system is too uncertain for us to attempt to estimate the mass outflow rate .",
    "the mass outflow rates derived for rxj005734 , rxj124913  and rxj163308  are about 10 times their mass accretion rates , while in rxj121803  the accretion and outflow rates are comparable .      at this point",
    "it is worth considering how these results bear on the broader picture of how x - ray absorbed qsos relate to the evolution of massive black holes and their host galaxies . in @xcite",
    "we argued that the submillimetre properties of x - ray absorbed qsos imply an evolutionary sequence in which submillimetre galaxies evolve into qsos , with the x - ray absorbed qsos representing a brief , transitional phase between these two stages .",
    "the discovery that submillimetre galaxies typically contain more heavily absorbed , lower luminosity agn than x - ray absorbed qsos , supports this evolutionary picture @xcite .",
    "in @xcite we further proposed that the x - ray absorbed qsos are in the process of driving the interstellar media out of their host galaxies via radiatively driven winds , in accord with the models developed by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "now , with our _ xmm - newton _  observations we have shown that the x - ray absorption in these objects is indeed due to substantial , ionized , qso - driven winds .",
    "the space density of x - ray absorbed qsos is @xmath141 per cent that of unabsorbed qsos @xcite , implying that if all qsos go through an x - ray absorbed phase in their evolution , this phase lasts only @xmath141 per cent as long as the unabsorbed phase .",
    "these relative lifetimes may be a natural consequence of the high mass outflow rates in the x - ray absorbed qsos : for the majority of our x - ray absorbed qsos we estimate a mass outflow rate which is @xmath142 times higher than the accretion rate , implying that the fuel supply will be depleted 10 times faster in an x - ray absorbed qso than in an unabsorbed qso for the same accretion rate and fuel reservoir . however , this argument is more complicated if the two types of qso fit within the evolutionary sequence discussed above , because in this case the fuel supply for an unabsorbed qso will consist only of the fuel that remains after the x - ray absorbed phase . nonetheless , if material is ejected at @xmath2 10 times the accretion rate for @xmath2 15 per cent of the ( x - ray absorbed + unabsorbed ) qso lifetime , the total mass of material ejected by the qso will be of the same order as that accreted .",
    "the origin of the ionized , absorbing gas is then a fundamental issue for the physics of x - ray absorbed qsos and their evolution . assuming that x - ray absorbed qsos have the usual agn structure envisaged in geometric unification schemes , the two obvious sources of material are the accretion disc and the dusty torus .",
    "if the wind is driven from the accretion disc , the ejected material must pass through the accretion disc during the x - ray absorbed phase ; in this case it is difficult to understand why this happens on a timescale which is short compared to the lifetime of the qso . on the other hand ,",
    "if the ionized wind is driven from the torus then the timescale for the x - ray absorbed phase corresponds to the time required to erode the inner part of the torus and so enlarge substantially its opening angle ; as shown by @xcite this timescale can be much shorter than the lifetime of the qso .",
    "for accretion at the eddington rate , the escape velocities at the distances of the inner edge of the torus ( as given in table  [ tab : physics ] ) are between 900 and 1500 kms@xmath8 , and scale inversely with the square root of the accretion rate in eddington units .",
    "hence , of our x - ray absorbed qsos , only the balqso rxj124913  has outflow velocities which are too high to plausibly be associated with an outflow from the inner edge of the torus , implying an accretion disc origin for its outflow .",
    "viable agn feedback models which reproduce the @xmath143 relation generally incorporate the feedback in the form of kinetic energy given to gas within the immediate ( @xmath2100 pc ) environment of the agn ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which then interacts with gas on a larger scale to terminate star formation in the host spheroid .",
    "it is generally agreed that of order 5 per cent of the agn radiative output must be fed back as kinetic energy in order for the models to succeed @xcite .",
    "we can make a simple estimate for the kinetic energy of the outflows compared to the radiative output of the x - ray absorbed qsos as follows .",
    "we take the total energy radiated during the x - ray absorbed phase to be @xmath144 where @xmath131 is the radiative efficiency , @xmath130 is the speed of light and @xmath145 is the mass accreted during the x - ray absorbed phase .",
    "the kinetic energy built up by the outflow is @xmath146 where @xmath147 is the mass supplied to the outflow during the x - ray absorbed phase and @xmath134 is the velocity of the outflow .",
    "the fraction of the radiated output of the qso which is fed back to the surrounding gas as kinetic energy of the outflow is then @xmath148 if we take @xmath149_m_@xmath140 _",
    "m_@xmath150 for the x - ray absorbed phase ( as we find for the majority of our x - ray absorbed qsos ) , and a typical outflow velocity of 8000 km s@xmath8 ( see table [ tab : uvlines ] ) , we obtain @xmath151  per cent .",
    "the value of @xmath152 so derived is independent of the radiative efficiency @xmath131 , because the @xmath131 in equation [ eq : feedback ] cancels with that in equation [ eq : outflow ] from which _",
    "m_@xmath140_m_@xmath123 is obtained . on the other hand , the uncertainty on _",
    "m_@xmath140_m_@xmath123 is in truth very large ( @xmath153 a factor of 10 ) , depending on the unknown filling factor @xmath116 , and the square of the outflow velocity @xmath134 , which may not be the same for the x - ray absorbing phase as the uv absorber .",
    "nonetheless , @xmath154  per cent is quite consistent with the level of feedback required to terminate star formation and produce the @xmath143 relation , implying that the ionized outflows in x - ray absorbed qsos could plausibly be the mechanism through which star formation is terminated in massive galaxies .",
    "we have presented x - ray spectra from _ xmm - newton _  epic and rest - frame ultraviolet spectra from ground - based telescopes for five x - ray absorbed , submillimetre - luminous qsos .",
    "all five qsos exhibit strong civ absorption lines in their ultraviolet spectra with equivalent width @xmath1 .",
    "the x - ray spectra can be modelled successfully in terms of @xmath155 with either cold or ionized absorbers .",
    "the cold x - ray absorber model requires that the qsos have unusually flat x - ray continuum shapes and unusual optical to x - ray spectral energy distributions , while the ionized absorber model does not require abnormal underlying continuum properties .",
    "this finding , coupled with the presence of strong civ absorption lines in the uv leads us to favour the ionized absorber model over the cold absorber model .",
    "assuming that the x - ray absorbing gas is outflowing with the same velocities as the civ absorbers , we are able to investigate the likely location , mass outflow rates and energetics of the ionized absorbers . we find that the x - ray absorbing gas is likely to be located within 10pc of the continuum source , and so is associated with the active nucleus rather than the surrounding host galaxy s interstellar medium .",
    "we estimate that the fraction of radiated power that is converted into kinetic luminosity of the outflowing winds is typically @xmath2 4 per cent , in agreement with estimates for the kinetic feedback from qsos that is required to produce the @xmath3 relation .",
