    "in mobile communication services , there is interaction among _ mobile network operators ( mnos ) _ , _ users _ , and _ the regulator _ ( figure [ structure ] ) .",
    "each mno makes an investment in its network to improve the quality of service ( qos ) and sets a service price to maximize its profit .",
    "the users decide which mno is more appropriate to subscribe to the network service considering the service price and the qos .",
    "finally , the regulator aims to maximize the welfare of all users .",
    "therefore , there should be some equilibrium points for the service price and network investment ( qos ) between mnos and users .",
    "theoretically , finding such equilibrium points is not easy .",
    "the situation becomes even more complicated when there are multiple mnos competing with each other .",
    "maximizing profit is the primary concern of mnos , which might be achieved by having a high price level and low investment on the network . on the other hand , users wish to maximize their utility by consuming high qos with a low service price .",
    "the qos is directly related to the network investment from mnos . therefore , there is a conflict of interests among these players and the role of the regulator is very important . from the regulatory perspective , solely maximizing profit by mnos should be avoided if it is at the cost of sacrificing user welfare significantly .    for making efficient regulations ,",
    "we firstly investigate characteristics of the competitive mobile communication services .",
    "an important question for mnos is how much of the network capacity should be provisioned and how high the service price should be .",
    "price competition between two operators was previously studied by walrand @xcite , where the network capacity was assumed to be given . here , we analyze how each mno determines the optimal investment on the network and the service price as a response to the strategy of its competitor . for this purpose",
    ", we apply cournot and bertrand competition models @xcite-@xcite .    in the cournot model , mnos compete with each other deciding the extent of investment on their networks . on the other hand , in the bertrand model ,",
    "mnos engage in price competition to attract more subscribers for a given network capacity .",
    "we combine the cournot and bertrand models so that the network capacity is determined in the cournot phase and afterwards the service price is determined in the bertrand phase .",
    "the cournot and bertrand models are interlinked and we achieve joint optimization of the network capacity and service price . our main viewpoint of this joint optimization is in investigating the dynamics of competition between mnos and also in finding an optimal role of the regulator .",
    "the dynamics of price competition among network operators was studied in some previous works @xcite-@xcite .",
    "particularly , in @xcite , we showed that there would be a price dynamics that network operators increase and decrease their service prices periodically . in the real world , however , network operators billing systems are very similar in the same country or state and the price dynamics does not seem to occur .    for discussing the reality of the price dynamics ,",
    "let us consider the monthly charging structure in the mobile communication service . in most countries ,",
    "many mnos give a _ subsidy _ to attract new subscribers ( potential users or their competitors subscribers ) @xcite .",
    "the subsidy is offered as part of a contract that includes a stipulated time period .",
    "therefore , we should consider the subsidy amount for examining the price competition among mnos .    to show that there can be a kind of price dynamics by subsidization in the real world , we plot quarterly marketing expenses as percentage of sales of the major mnos ( skt , kt and lgu+ ) in south korea as an example ( figure [ subsidy ] ) .",
    "note that the investigated marketing expenses are mostly used for subsidization . in the figure , the mnos increase and",
    "decrease their marketing expenses repeatedly , and this can be interpreted as the service price dynamics by subsidization . then , why do the mnos use subsidization as an indirect method for increasing or decreasing their service prices ?",
    "the mnos can not increase the service prices easily due to regulations .",
    "on the other hand , there are few regulations on subsidization and people are relatively generous about change of the subsidy amount because it is believed that subsidization is a means of lowering the cost of new subscriber s entry to the mobile communication services @xcite . therefore ,",
    "the mnos compete with each other by adjusting their subsidy amounts , making the price dynamics in the real world .",
    "unfortunately , theoretic backgrounds of price dynamics are not known to us , and as a result , effective network planning and regulative actions are hard to make in the competitive market .    in this paper",
    ", we analyze the price dynamics between mnos using the two stage competition model , where the mnos increase and decrease their service prices periodically without an equilibrium point .",
    "this kind of price dynamics is not desirable to any player due to the instability .",
    "for example , it is unfair that users payments for the mobile communication service are different in different start times of the subscription even though they are served by the same mno .",
    "based on our analysis , to avoid such instability , we suggest a simple regulation rule that guarantees an equilibrium point of price levels , which is pareto - optimal .      in @xcite , the author shows that service price and qos are inter - related in communications networks , and suggests paris metro pricing ( pmp ) for internet .",
    "pmp is a kind of price discrimination over different qos levels ; the higher qos , the higher price . in that paper , the author finds that the service price and qos will converge to an equilibrium point after a number of interactions .",
    "pmp is further extended by walrand @xcite , who formulates an internet pricing model under price and qos constraints . in that work",
    ", the author investigates how much pmp improves the operator s profit compared to a single optimal service price .",
    "the author also analyzes price competition between two homogeneous network operators , the network capacities of which are fixed . in @xcite , we show the dynamics of price competition ( _ price war _ ) using the walrand model @xcite , and suggest a regulation for price level convergence .",
    "the price war in communication service is observed in @xcite-@xcite .",
    "particularly , in @xcite and @xcite , if one operator lowers its price to increase revenue or to monopolize the entire market , then the other operators will also lower their price to match the price leader .",
    "the price down competition will occur repeatedly among all operators , eventually damaging every operator with a revenue decrease .",
    "competition among network operators occurs not only by price differentiation .",
    "the capacity of the network is another important variable .",
    "this is because users will select a network operator based on decision criteria including not only service price but also qos level , and the qos is directly related to the network capacity .",
    "therefore , each operator jointly optimizes the service price and network capacity .",
    "all of the previous work mentioned above focuses only on price competition , assuming the network capacity is given as an external value . in @xcite , the authors consider competition among multiple network operators with single- or two - service classes . in that work ,",
    "service prices are fixed and price competition does not occur . to attract more users , the operators decide only the network capacity .",
    "suppliers of a homogeneous good / service compete with each other by deciding their amount of output .",
    "this is called cournot competition ( quantity competition ) @xcite .",
    "generally , the market price decreases as the total amount of output increases . on the other hand",
    ", bertrand competition refers to price competition where the suppliers compete with each other by controlling the product price @xcite . in the bertrand competition model",
    ", consumers buy all of a particular product from the supplier with the lowest price .",
    "we analyze mobile communications markets using cournot and bertrand competition models @xcite-@xcite . in @xcite-@xcite , we suggest spectrum policies and subsidization schemes for improving user welfare in mobile communications . in @xcite , we investigate the effect of allocation of asymmetric - valued spectrum blocks on mobile communications markets .",
    "however , our previous works focus on spectrum allocation and have not dealt with price dynamics in mobile communications .      using the two stage model @xcite",
    ", we will show that mnos sequentially decrease their service prices ( i.e. , increase subsidies ) as in @xcite and @xcite , but one mno suddenly increases its price when the competitor s price is lower than a certain threshold .",
    "therefore , the price levels increase and decrease periodically without an equilibrium point .",
    "we call this _ price war with long jumps _ , which is not desirable to any player .",
    "the main contributions and results of this paper are summarized below .    *",
    "_ description of price dynamics _ : in the real world , mnos tend to compete with each other changing their service prices by subsidization ( see figure [ subsidy ] ) . using a two - stage cournot and bertrand competition model with network congestion , we mathematically analyze the competition between mnos .",
    "based on a game - theoretic approach , we show that there exists price ( subsidy ) dynamics in the mobile communication service , which well explains the subsidy dynamics in figure [ subsidy ] . * _ regulation for price convergence _ : to avoid instability and inefficiency , we propose a simple regulation that limits the number of price level changes . we show that the regulation guarantees an equilibrium point of price levels that is pareto - optimal .",
    "we also introduce more realistic regulations that bring the same effect of the price regulation . *",
    "_ regulation under a two - stage cournot and bertand model _ : using the two - stage model , we calculate an equilibrium point of the network capacity and the service price . from the result",
    ", we suggest a regulator s optimal action ( exacting taxes ) corresponding to user welfare or the regulator s revenue .",
    "this is an extension of our previous work @xcite to the two - stage model .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we describe our system model .",
    "section iii presents our optimization problem in two - stage duopoly competition . in section iv",
    ", we derive a solution to the optimization problem in the bertrand stage and explain how two operators prices vary .",
    "we suggest a simple regulation that drives the price levels to converge on an equilibrium point . in section",
    "v , we combine the bertrand model with the cournot model . using a backward induction method ,",
    "we solve the optimization problem in the cournot stage and find an equilibrium point . from the results ,",
    "we describe characteristics of the communications service market and introduce the role of the regulator .",
    "finally , section vi concludes the paper .",
    "consider a service area covered by two competitive mnos .",
    "there are @xmath0 users for the mobile communication service .",
    "nonnegative values @xmath1 and @xmath2 , respectively , denote the first and the second mno s capacity , which determine the quality of service ( qos ) of the networks .",
    "mnos determine the optimal @xmath1 and @xmath2 values in the cournot stage . in the bertrand stage ,",
    "mnos compete by controlling @xmath3 and @xmath4 , the first and the second mno s price for the service .",
    "these service prices include the subsidy amounts ( i.e. , the initial service price minus the subsidy amount ) .",
    "therefore , the mnos can control the service prices by adjusting the subsidy amounts even if there are some regulations that prohibit the initial price level changes . without loss of generality , we assume @xmath3 and @xmath4 are normalized values over the interval @xmath5 $ ]",
    ". each mno can provide only one price to all users at a given time .",
    "the qos of a network depends on the congestion level of the network .",
    "we denote the qos of each mno s network by @xmath6 and @xmath7 , respectively . without loss of generality ,",
    "the values of @xmath6 and @xmath7 are also normalized over the interval @xmath5 $ ] .",
    "a value closer to 0 denotes a higher congestion level ( lower qos ) .",
    "each user decides whether to subscribe to the communication service or not by selecting its serving mno .",
    "some users prefer high qos ( low congestion ) even though they have to pay more . on the other hand",
    ", some other users will accept a low qos if the service price is low , as was also noted by paris metro pricing @xcite .",
    "willingness - to - pay and the qos required by users are positively correlated . to model user behavior",
    ", we define the _ user type _ as in @xcite and @xcite . the user type @xmath8 is a variable over @xmath5 $ ] that quantifies the user s willingness - to - pay . at the same time , it quantifies the qos level required by the user . has a dual role as willingness - to - pay and qos requirement .",
    "this seems to be open to dispute because those two criteria can not merged into one - dimensional parameter space . in this paper , however , we assume that each user s willingness - to - pay and qos requirement are highly correlated and can be modeled as a one - dimensional parameter for the mathematical tractability . ]",
    "the value @xmath8 is close to @xmath9 when the user is willing to pay a high price for high qos . at the other extreme ( @xmath10 ) ,",
    "the user prefers low qos with a low price .",
    "since it is difficult to figure out the user type value of each user , we assume that it is a random variable ( e.g. , uniform distribution in @xmath5 $ ] ) .",
    "consider a user with user type value @xmath8 .",
    "for the user to subscribe to the communication service offered by mno @xmath11 , both the price and qos levels should be satisfied .",
    "in other words , @xmath12 and @xmath13 , where we regard the first and second inequalities as the _ price condition _ ( pc ) and _ qos condition _ ( qc ) , respectively .",
    ", then the utility from the service is equal to @xmath8 .",
    "otherwise , the utility is zero .",
    "therefore , a user with user type @xmath8 subscribes to mno @xmath11 s communication service only if both @xmath14 and @xmath13 are satisfied . ]",
    "the pc is commonly used in microeconomics @xcite , but it is not sufficient to model communication service , where some users whose pcs are satisfied may not use the service because the qos is lower than expected due to congestion . if multiple mnos satisfy both conditions , then the user will select the mno offering the lowest price .",
    "we use a linearly decreasing qos model as in @xcite and @xcite , which mirrors the perception of service quality @xcite : @xmath15 where @xmath16 and @xmath17 denote the number of users accessing the first and the second mno , respectively .",
    "we define the reference capacity , which makes the qos level equal to zero when all users access one of the mnos . @xmath1 and @xmath2 are normalized values by the reference capacity . in other words , if @xmath18 ( @xmath19 ) and @xmath20 ( @xmath21 ) , then the qos level is @xmath22 ( @xmath23 ) .",
    "the user demand is expressed as follows : @xmath24 where @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 denote the minimum and the maximum values of @xmath8 among the users accessing the first and the second mno , respectively .",
    "@xmath29 denotes a probability density function of @xmath8 .",
    "equation ( [ eq : demand ] ) is a demand function derived from integration of the willingness - to - pay distribution .",
    "figure [ integral_interval ] illustrates a perfectly segmented market and non - segmented market .",
    "assume @xmath30 .",
    "in the perfectly segmented market ( @xmath31 ) , the values of @xmath25 and @xmath27 are determined by pc , and @xmath32 and @xmath28 are determined by qc . on the other hand , in the non - segmented duopoly market ( @xmath33 ) , @xmath34 is determined by @xmath35 .",
    "this is because if there are users whose pc and qc are satisfied by both mnos ] , both pc and qc are satisfied by both mnos . ] , then the users whose user types are within @xmath36 $ ] will access the second mno with the lower price , @xmath4 .",
    "figure [ two_stage ] explains our two - stage model . in the cournot stage , mnos decide their capacity considering the investment cost .",
    "each mno can not change its network capacity in the short - term after observing a competitor s network investment .",
    "thus , this capacity competition can be modeled as a simultaneous game .",
    "hereafter , let @xmath11 denote the decision maker index and @xmath37 denote the competitor s .",
    "then , we formulate the optimization problem of mno @xmath11 in the cournot stage as follows : @xmath38 where @xmath39 and @xmath40 denote revenue and cost functions of mno @xmath11 .",
    "note that the mno s revenue depends not only on its own capacity , but also on its competitor s .",
    "the revenue function is determined by the result of the bertrand stage .    in the bertrand stage",
    ", mnos compete with each other by controlling their prices for the given capacity determined in the cournot stage . here",
    "the price includes the subsidy .",
    "thus high price implies low subsidy , and low price implies high subsidy .",
    "each mno can change its price repeatedly after observing a competitor s .",
    "thus , this price competition can be modeled as an infinite sequential game .",
    "we exclude the case of pricing equal to that of the competitor .",
    "then , we formulate the optimization problem of mno @xmath11 in the bertrand stage , which is divided into two cases : using either a higher or lower price than the competitor s .    * _ using a lower price ( @xmath41 ) _ : @xmath42    in this case , the number of users for mno @xmath11 is independent of the competitor s price , which is just like the monopoly led by the low pricing mno .",
    "thus , the upper and lower limits of the integral in the constraint are replaced by @xmath43 and @xmath44 as in figure [ integral_interval ] .    * _ using a higher price ( @xmath45 ) _ : @xmath46    in this case , the competitor affects the number of users of mno @xmath11 .",
    "if the competitor guarantees pc and qc of a user , then the user will access the competitor network . noting that @xmath47 is determined by the qc , the upper limit of the integral is given by @xmath43 . on the other hand ,",
    "@xmath48 is determined by @xmath49 as explained in figure [ integral_interval ] .",
    "a common method for analyzing a multi - stage game is the backward induction method .",
    "this method is used to find the equilibrium that represents a nash equilibrium in every stage ( or subgame ) of the original game .",
    "we start with the bertrand stage . the capacities @xmath50 and @xmath51 are assumed to be given , and will be optimized in the next section describing the cournot stage .",
    "hereafter , we assume that the user type @xmath8 is uniformly distributed .",
    "this assumption was also used in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we will show how the price dynamics changes with more general distributions of user type @xmath8 in the last of this section .",
    "we derive the optimal price of mno @xmath11 , which is summarized in the following lemmas :    * lemma 1 * : _ in the case that the mno s price @xmath52 is lower than its competitor s price @xmath53 , the optimal solution @xmath54 is : @xmath55 _ _ where @xmath56 is a minimum unit of price level changes and very small positive value .",
    "_    * proof * : under the assumption that @xmath8 is uniformly distributed , we get the following equation from the constraint of the optimization problem for the lower price case : @xmath57 we calculate @xmath58 and the objective function @xmath59 from equation ( [ eq : demand_lower ] ) as follows : @xmath60 the objective function is a quadratic function whose maximum is at @xmath61 .",
    "therefore , if @xmath62 , then the optimal solution will be @xmath63 . otherwise , the optimal solution will be @xmath64 .",

    "likewise , mno @xmath153 can not increase its revenue without decreasing the revenue of mno @xmath152 because the only method to increase the revenue of mno @xmath153 in the perfectly segmented condition ( @xmath161 ) is to decrease @xmath162 and @xmath163 simultaneously .",
    "therefore , the point that satisfies the conditions in lemma 5 is pareto - optimal .",
    "@xmath65    lemma 5 indicates that the mnos prices should be sufficiently separated ( i.e. , perfectly segmented market ) for pareto - optimality . the equilibrium point under our suggested regulation ( lemma 4 ) satisfies the conditions in lemma 5 .",
    "therefore , the equilibrium point is pareto - optimal .",
    "this finding is summarized below .",
    "* proposition 2 * : _ a regulation that limits the number of price level changes makes the price levels converge to an equilibrium point that is pareto - optimal .",
    "_    the price war with long jumps occurs due to the mnos short - sighted way of thinking .",
    "however , the mnos can not use a myopic strategy under proposition 2 .",
    "we can find similar regulations of proposition 2 .",
    "in south korea , the market - dominating enterprise ( skt ) can not change its service price without government permission .",
    "this is similar to giving the other mnos ( kt and lgu+ ) the last opportunity for a price level change .",
    "the price regulation also can be implemented by restricting subsidization . in other words , notifying mnos that subsidization will be banned after a certain time is equal to the regulation that limits the number of price level changes .",
    "for instance , korea communications commission ( kcc ) actually prohibited subsidization by mnos from 2003 to 2008 .",
    "this kind of subsidy regulation also can be observed in finland @xcite .",
    "another way that brings the same effect of such price regulation is to regulate the time interval between price level changes .",
    "if mnos can not change their service price or subsidy levels for a long time , then they will use far - sighted strategies , which leads to the equilibrium point described in lemma 4 .    to verify our analysis ,",
    "we conduct simulations , which show the price level changes of both mnos . in the simulations , the minimum unit of price level changes and each mno s network capacity",
    "are set to @xmath164 and @xmath165 .",
    "also , we set each mno s initial price to @xmath166 and apply the price regulation that limits the number of price level changes to @xmath167 .",
    "figure [ price_war_uniform ] illustrates the results , where both mnos initially decrease their prices repeatedly but one mno suddenly increases its price when the competitor s price is lower than some threshold ( i.e. , price war with long jumps ) . after the price regulation ,",
    "the prices converge on an equilibrium point , which coincides with our analysis .",
    "so far , we assume that user type @xmath8 of ( [ eq : demand ] ) is uniformly distributed .",
    "we will now see how the price dynamics changes with more general distributions of @xmath8 by means of simulations . for this",
    ", we adopt three additional distributions of @xmath8 in @xcite as follows : @xmath168 using these distributions , we can reflect network scenarios consisting of high population of users having low , high and middle user type , respectively .",
    "figure [ price_war_nonuniform ] shows the results , where price war with long jumps occurs like the uniform user type case .",
    "moreover , in the non - uniform user type cases , the prices always converge on an equilibrium point after the price regulation .",
    "the equilibrium price tends to be biased towards the high density of user type .",
    "in this section , we combine the result of the bertrand stage with that of the cournot stage . that is , using the results of section iv , we rewrite the optimization problem ( equation ( [ eq : cournot_opt_problem ] ) ) of the cournot stage and solve it .",
    "the main motivation of this section is to completely understand the competitive actions of each mno , and thus to derive the optimal response of the regulator .      without loss of generality ,",
    "we assume that the last opportunity for a price level change is given to mno @xmath37 . using the revenue equations ( equations ( [ eq : closed_demand_lower ] ) and ( [ eq : objective_higher ] ) )",
    ", we calculate the revenue function @xmath169 at the equilibrium price of the bertrand stage ( lemma 4 ) .",
    "we use the linearly increasing cost function as in @xcite .",
    "that is , @xmath170 , where @xmath171 is the unit cost per capacity .",
    "then , we can rewrite the optimization problem ( equation ( [ eq : cournot_opt_problem ] ) ) of the cournot stage , which is divided into two cases .    * _ case 1 _ @xmath172 : @xmath173    * _ case 2 _ @xmath174 : @xmath175    to solve these optimization problems , we need some mathematical knowledge given in the lemmas below .",

    "thus , we compare the squares of them as follows : @xmath204 note that the second equality holds because we use an equation @xmath205 from the first order condition of the optimization problem . from the above calculations ,",
    "we conclude that if @xmath206 ( i.e. , @xmath207 ) , then there would be an equilibrium . using these results and lemma 4",
    ", we can calculate the equilibrium as in proposition 3 .",
    "@xmath65    we call @xmath208 of ( [ eq : gamma ] ) the _ feasibility function _ because we can discriminate between feasible and infeasible markets using this function .",
    "if the unit cost @xmath171 is expensive and does not satisfy equation ( [ eq : gamma ] ) , then the market will be infeasible ( i.e. , market failure ) and , @xmath209 and @xmath210 are negative values .",

    "we observe that @xmath214 is always higher than @xmath215 , and mno @xmath37 always invests more than mno @xmath11 .",
    "this means the users with high user type ( i.e. , high qos requirement and high willingness - to - pay ) are targeted by mno @xmath37 . on the other hand ,",
    "mno @xmath11 can make a profit by making a relatively small investment because its target users have low user types .",
    "an interesting observation is that the price gap between both mnos decreases as the unit cost per capacity increases in figure [ equilibrium_figure]-(c ) .",
    "this is because the high cost makes both mnos reduce their investment levels and concentrate on lucrative targets ( i.e. , the users whose user types are near @xmath216 ) .",
    "the regulator s key concern is to improve user welfare @xcite , @xcite .",

    "if the user consumes neither of mnos network services , then its utility will be zero .",
    "the regulator can achieve its purpose by exacting _",
    "taxes _ from the mnos or giving _ subsidies _ to them .",

    "the figure shows that user welfare decreases as @xmath220 increases . even though this result is predictable",
    ", the regulator can use it to forecast results of exacting taxes or giving subsidies .    from the regulatory perspective",
    ", another important thing is to secure finances .",
    "we plot the regulator s revenue as a function of @xmath220 in figure [ regulator_revenue ] . intuitively , the regulator runs a deficit when it gives subsidies ( i.e. , @xmath225 ) to improve user welfare .",
    "therefore , the regulator should strike a balance between securing finances and improving user welfare . figure [ regulator_revenue ] also shows that very high taxes lead to the revenue loss .",
    "this is because the burden of high taxes makes mnos cut their investments .",
    "if the regulator s goal is to maximize its revenue , then @xmath220 should be set to @xmath226 .",
    "mnos tend to compete with each other changing their service prices by subsidization in the real world ( see figure [ subsidy ] ) . in this paper , to theoretically explain the price dynamics in the mobile communication service , we used a two - stage cournot and bertrand competition model that is well understood in microeconomics .",

    "based on our results in the cournot stage , we describe characteristics of the duopoly market and suggest the regulator s optimal actions ( exacting taxes ) corresponding to user welfare and the regulator s revenue . although our analytic results are derived under some assumptions for mathematical tractability , it will provide good intuition for understanding the price dynamics and imposing regulations in the mobile communication service ."
