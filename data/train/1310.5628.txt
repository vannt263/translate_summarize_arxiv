    "the polynomial heisenberg algebras are deformations of the oscillator algebra , where the differential ladder operators are of order @xmath0 and the commutator between them is a polynomial of order @xmath1 in the hamiltonian . due to this algebraic structure",
    ", the hamiltonian spectrum turns out to be the juxtaposition of several equidistant energy ladders .",
    "let us note that systems described by second order polynomial heisenberg algebras ( for @xmath2 ) are connected to the painlev iv ( piv ) equation @xcite .",
    "conversely , if a system characterized by third order differential ladder operators and their extremal states are found , thus one can find solutions to the piv equation in a simple way .",
    "the supersymmetric partners of the harmonic oscillator hamiltonian provide explicit realizations of the polynomial heisenberg algebras @xcite .",
    "in particular , for first order susy the involved supercharges are linear in the momentum and such hamiltonians have third order ladder operators @xcite , i.e. , they fulfill the commutation relations associated to a second order polynomial heisenberg algebra , thus they will lead to solutions to the piv equation @xcite .    on the other hand , hamiltonians obtained from the harmonic oscillator through second order susy with supercharges which are quadratic in the momentum possess , in general , fifth order differential ladder operators . however , it is possible to identify a subfamily of these hamiltonians which , in addition to have these fifth order operators , possesses also third order ones and , consequently , lead to new solutions of the piv equation @xcite .",
    "the same property can be found for a subset of @xmath3-th order susy partner hamiltonians of the oscillator , which have the two kinds of differential ladder operators , those of order @xmath4 and third order ones , the last leading also to solutions to the piv equation .    using the previously mentioned technique , plenty of non - singular explicit solutions to the piv equation , either real or complex ,",

    "it would be important to address a systematic analysis of the corresponding singular solutions . in this paper",
    "we will start this study by allowing the existence of one fixed singularity .",

    "we shall describe also the induced spectral modifications and the second order polynomial heisenberg algebra characterizing the new hamiltonians , which will naturally lead to new solutions to the piv equation .    in order to achieve our goals , in section 2 we will review briefly the supersymmetric quantum mechanics and the way in which hamiltonians which are intertwined with the harmonic oscillator realize the second order polynomial heisenberg algebras , connecting them later with the piv equation and some of its solutions . in section 3",
    "we will study the harmonic oscillator with and infinite potential barrier at the origin , and we will apply to it the first and second order susy techniques . in section 4",
    "we will obtain several solutions to the piv equation , either non - singular or with a singularity at @xmath5 , by using the extremal states of the susy partners of the harmonic oscillator with an infinite potential barrier .",

    "supersymmetric quantum mechanics describes systems characterized by a supersymmetric hamiltonian @xmath6 and two supercharges @xmath7 , @xmath8 , all of them hermitian operators satisfying the following supersymmetry algebra with two generators : @xmath9=0 , \\qquad \\{q_i , q_j\\}=\\delta_{ij}h_{\\scriptsize \\mbox{ss } } , \\quad i , j=1,2,\\ ] ] where @xmath10=fg - gf$ ] and @xmath11 are the commutator and anticommutator of the operators @xmath12 and @xmath13 respectively .",

    "moreover , this transformation can be decomposed into first and second - order ones , the second - order transformations involving @xmath24 and @xmath25 in an irreducible way , i.e. , they also can be produced by two first - order transformations but the intermediate potential would be complex @xcite . for the purposes of this paper it is enough to assume that @xmath22 , @xmath26 , and the same will be done further on for any other factorization of this kind .    in order to realize the standard supersymmetry algebra of ( [ 0.3.3 ] ) let us choose @xmath27 so that @xmath28 since @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the previous @xmath3-th order differential intertwining operators , this representation is known as @xmath3-susy qm .",
