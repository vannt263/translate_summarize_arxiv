    "fluorescence spectroscopy and lifetime measurements are powerful tools in the study of biological samples;@xcite however , these techniques suffer from limited sensitivity at low fluorophore concentrations typically employed .",
    "the presence of a metallic surface can dramatically alter the emission properties of a locally situated fluorophore , resulting in enhanced fluorescence emission and greater photostability by reducing the excited state lifetime.@xcite plasmon - induced fluorescence modifications are currently being investigated for a wide variety of nanostructured systems , such as metal - island films,@xcite lithographically patterned nanoparticle arrays,@xcite and individual gold nanospheres.@xcite the strong dependence of these effects on fluorophore - metal separation has been used to increase both lateral and longitudinal resolution in confocal microscopy , with important consequences for biological imaging.@xcite    raman spectroscopy provides an enticing alternative to fluorescence , as it has many potential advantages and it is able to provide high - resolution information with chemical specificity . as such , the technique is finding increasing application in biological systems,@xcite as it allows rapid diagnosis using spectral deconvolution techniques such as principal component analysis . however , the very weak intrinsic cross - section of the raman scattering process ( some 14 orders of magnitude less than fluorescence cross - sections ) makes it impractical for many biological applications that require low laser powers and short integration times .",
    "this raman signal can be enhanced by many orders of magnitude via surface enhanced raman scattering ( sers ) in the vicinity of noble metal nanoparticles.@xcite devices that utilise this effect can act as ultra - sensitive biosensors , with diverse applications in all areas of pathogen detection.@xcite    here , we report the results of high spatial resolution time - resolved measurements on individual self - assembled ag nanoparticles . using fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy ( flim ) , we have observed localized enhancements in the emission intensity and additional fluorescence lifetime components from vicinal fluorophores . by correlating the initial emission intensity and lifetime resulting from these modified decay channels ,",
    "we attribute these enhancements to a greater photon recycling rate due to coupling with surface plasmons . high resolution spatial maps of raman scattering show an enhancement in signal over the nanoparticles of more than 5 orders of magnitude .",
    "aqueous 500 nm diameter latex spheres were drop - cast onto a piranha treated glass slide , resulting in the formation of a monolayer / bilayer close - packed lattice as the water evaporated.@xcite a 0.5 nm layer of chromium was then deposited onto the slide by thermal evaporation in a vacuum chamber ; this increases the adhesion of silver which was subsequently deposited to a thickness of 25 nm .",
    "the latex spheres were removed by sonication in chloroform , leaving a continuous periodic array of ag nanoparticles over a typical area of 20 mm@xmath0 .",
    "figure [ afm](a ) shows an atomic force microscopy ( afm ) image of a boundary region of nanoparticles , formed from a single layer of latex spheres ( left hand side ) . there is a small region of residual latex spheres in the top right corner .",
    "figure [ afm](b ) shows individual particles within the array , which have a base length of @xmath1150 nm and height of 25 nm . in some regions ,",

    "extinction spectroscopy ( perkin - elmer lambda 800 ) was used to determine the local surface plasmon resonances ( lspr ) of the ag nanoparticles .",
    "figure [ afm](d ) shows ensemble extinction spectra from single and double layer regions .",
    "the single layer structures have two strong absorption resonances corresponding to dipole ( 720 nm ) and quadrupole ( 460 nm ) lspr modes,@xcite whereas the double layer structures have only one peak at 440 nm due to their ellipsoidal geometry.@xcite        rhodamine 6 g ( r6 g ) dye was deposited onto the nanoparticles by vacuum sublimation to produce a uniform coverage of sub - monolayer thickness .",
    "the sample was prepared for high resolution optical measurements by applying a thin layer of index - matching polymer solution ( mowiol 4 - 88 ) to a glass slide and affixing this on top of the nanoparticle array . during this procedure",
    "the r6 g was incorporated into the polymer layer , creating a homogeneous distribution of fluorophores across the sample with a thickness of several microns .",
    "this was verified by spectroscopic analysis of excess polymer from the edge of the slide .",
    "fluorescence lifetime and intensity images were obtained using a scanning confocal epifluorescence microscope ( leica tcsp2 , 100x oil objective , 1.4 na ) with a synchronous time correlated single photon counting module ( becker and hickl spc-830 ) .",
    "excitation was with a 488 nm continuous - wave ( cw ) ar@xmath2 laser ( intensity ) or 467 nm 20 mhz pulsed diode laser ( lifetime ) , at a power far below fluorescence saturation in both cases .",
    "raman spectra and images were obtained using a renishaw spectrometer with a high precision prior h101 scanning stage . to reduce fluorescence background ,",
    "excitation was at 752 nm using a tunable cw ti : sa laser with a 100x oil objective .",
    "figure [ fluorescence](a ) is the transmitted white light image of a boundary region between nanoparticles formed by a single layer of latex spheres ( left ) and a double layer ( right ) .",

    "these maps show highly localized fluorescence enhancement from molecules close to nanoparticles .",
    "spectral analysis has verified that the emission originates from r6 g and is not caused by photoluminescence from the silver nanoparticles or scattered laser light . the r6 g fluorescence enhancement measured from the nanoparticles , relative to that from the glass ,",
    "is approximately fourfold and tenfold for ( c ) and ( d ) , respectively .",
    "the actual enhancement in the vicinity of the nanoparticles will be much larger than that measured : enhancement is only expected to occur over a very small range of metal - fluorophore distances ( @xmath120 nm),@xcite hence there is a significant unmodified fluorescence background from the other fluorophores in the excited confocal volume .",
    "this is discussed further below .",
    "there are two main causes of fluorescence _ enhancement _ from molecules close to metal nanoparticles : when optically excited at its plasmon resonance , a nanoparticle can dramatically enhance the local electromagnetic field intensity , resulting in an increase in a molecule s excitation rate.@xcite the excited - state molecular dipole can also couple with surface plasmon electrons in the metal creating an additional radiative decay channel.@xcite      for cw measurements it is not possible to separate the contributions to the fluorescence enhancement arising from the modified excitation and decay channels ; however , this is not the case with time - resolved measurements .",

    "in free - space @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the radiative emission rate , @xmath6 is the total lifetime of the molecule , and @xmath7 is the sum of the non - radiative decay rates .",
    "the presence of a metal creates an additional decay channel @xmath8 for an excited molecule , so the total radiative decay rate becomes @xmath9 .",

    "[ lifetime1](d ) and ( e ) .",
    "the 3.4 ns component has a gradual variation in intensity due to non - uniform illumination , but is otherwise continuous across the nanoparticle boundary .",

    "there is an identical long - lived component originating from unmodified fluorophores in the polymer layer ; this has a monoexponential decay @xmath163 ns and implies that there are no significant concentration - induced non - radiative channels.@xcite a flim map of this region was acquired for a 30 min integration period .",
    "bins of @xmath17 pixels ( @xmath18 nm ) were used to give decay transients with total preexponential counts of @xmath1@xmath19 .",
    "biexponential fits were then applied to give spatially resolved maps of constituent lifetimes @xmath20 and their corresponding intensities @xmath21 .",
    "a histogram of the extracted lifetime components is shown in fig .",
    "[ lifetime](d ) : this comprises a sharply peaked component @xmath22 from the unperturbed fluorophores , and a broader fast component @xmath11 arising from fluorophores with modified decay rates .",
    "figures [ lifetime](e ) and ( f ) show maps of the preexponential intensities for the two modal lifetime components ; the 0.5 ns component is localized ( resolution limited ) around the nanoparticles , whereas the 3.6 ns component has a uniform intensity ( standard deviation @xmath23 ) consistent with the homogeneous coverage of fluorophores ( c.f .  figs .",
    "[ lifetime1](d ) and ( e ) ) .    for this sample , the r6 g ( in polymer ) layer thickness is comparable to the axial confocal excitation depth ; hence",

    "molecules in very close proximity to a metal show strong fluorescence quenching due to dominant non - radiative energy transfer.@xcite we have taken measurements on samples without the additional polymer layer ; these show almost complete quenching of the r6 g fluorescence over the ag nanoparticles , and an instrumental - response limited lifetime .",
    "this strong distance - dependent weighting means that , for the current sample , the _ enhanced _ fluorescence with a lifetime @xmath11 is from a thin shell of molecules around the nanoparticles where the competing quenching and enhancement mechanisms result in a maximum net emission intensity.@xcite    , @xmath22 ) obtained from biexponential pixel fits of the scan area .",

    "the preexponential factor @xmath24 depends on several fixed experimental parameters and also directly depends on the radiative decay rate @xmath28.@xcite thus , we expect a direct correlation between @xmath24 and the measured decay rate .",

    "a large number of fluorophores show an order of magnitude increase in decay rate relative to the unmodified background ( @xmath31 ns@xmath32 ) , with a commensurate enhancement in initial intensity , as shown in fig.[fluorescence](d ) .",
    "these results are consistent with reports of single - molecule lifetime modification using a scanning nanoantenna.@xcite in cw measurements , the nanoparticle - induced enhancement in integrated intensity can not be accounted for by an increase in @xmath3 .",
    "instead it originates primarily from a greatly increased photon recycling rate for fluorophores with a strong radiative coupling to surface plasmons .",

    "as no signal is obtained from the r6 g on glass , it is not possible to calculate an absolute value for the enhancement factor ; however , a lower limit of @xmath33 can be estimated using the noise level in the glass spectrum .",
    "this has been verified by obtaining high resolution spatial maps of the raman signal over the nanoparticles .",
    "figure [ raman](c ) shows the integrated intensity under the 1500 cm@xmath32 raman line , for a region of nanoparticles similar to [ raman](b ) .",
    "the huge localized enhancement in raman signal is due to the increase in the local electric field intensity around an individual nanoparticle:@xcite the total sers enhancement has an @xmath35 dependence on electric field due to enhancement of the incident laser field and enhancement of the emission field at the raman frequency .",
    "this means that localized differences in the surface plasmon modes result in the creation of optical  hot spots \" , as has been previously reported for metal films.@xcite",
    "in conclusion , we have demonstrated highly localized modification of fluorescence intensity and lifetime on ordered arrays of ag nanoparticles .",
    "flim maps of r6 g fluorescence show an additional plasmon - induced radiative decay channel for a thin shell of molecules around individual nanoparticles .",
    "this leads to an order of magnitude increase in ensemble photon recycling rate with a proportionate enhancement in fluorescence intensity .",
    "the strong distance dependence of these effects suggests that metal enhanced fluorescence may offer a means of selectively mapping the location of specific target molecules within a larger excitation volume , such as fluorophore - tagged proteins in cell membranes .",
    "furthermore , spatially resolved maps of raman scattering from r6 g show localized enhancement from individual nanoparticles of more than five orders of magnitude .",
