    "quantum computing has a huge advantage over a classical one for a simulation of physical experiments , as well as for implementation of certain algorithms @xcite .",

    "topologicaly protected quantum computations is a promising way to overcome this problem.@xcite the latter employ non - abelian states , that are not local and are not affected by an environment . @xcite the simplest realization of these states are majorana fermions . since the early proposals a large number of solid state realizations were envisioned , based on topological insulators @xcite , semiconductor heterostructures @xcite , noncentrosymmetric superconductors@xcite , and quantum hall systems at integer plateau transitions@xcite , as well as one - dimensional semiconducting wires deposited on an s - wave superconductor @xcite .",
    "the signatures of majorana states were detected in the recent experiments@xcite .",
    "besides having the protected memory units ( q - bits ) , the implementation of quantum computers requires an initialization , manipulation and read out .",
    "these processes involve unitary transformations of the degenerate ground states achieved by braiding of majorana fermions .",
    "for one dimensional realization of majorana modes the braiding is achieved by building a network of wires@xcite .",
    "these wires are connected by y - junctions ( see fig . [",
    "fig : yjunction ] ) , that are controlled by the external gates @xcite , supercurrents @xcite , or magnetic fluxes@xcite .    unfortunately , the set of existing ( albeit in theory ) gates is incomplete , and can not be completed using majorana fermions alone .",
    "the conventional proposals lack the so - called @xmath2 gate , so that the desired topological computation remains elusive .",
    "the existing constructions for the latter gate rely on the non - protected manipulations , with the error correction protocol@xcite .",
    "since the complete dephasing - proof realization is not yet found , it makes sense to consider a different compromise . in the present work we discuss the manipulation via x - junctions , schematically shown in fig.[fig : xjunction ] .",
    "such junctions naturaly arise in the circuit theory of quantum computing and are realized experimentally @xcite .",
    "the parameter space of the underlying hamiltonian with four localized majorana states , is considerably larger than the previously studied case of y - junction .",
    "this allows us to implement additional gates at the price of dealing with the general form of interaction between four majorana fermions .",
    "generally , any state with an even number of majorana fermions has no topological protection .",
    "nevertheless , we show below that the parameters of x - junction can be specially tuned in such a way that the ground state remains degenerate and the states are not affected by dephasing .",
    "it means that mastering a good control of the junction amounts to reducing the dephasing level to an arbitrary low level .",
    "we hope , that this may be a practical way to implement dephasing - proof quantum computation .",

    "the case of x - junction , eq . is characterized by two points on the sphere , @xmath15 , @xmath38 , which parametrize the hamiltonian with two non - split majorana states .",

    "it should be stressed that there is no way to realize @xmath2 state within this setup in a topologically protected manner , and one inevitably ends up in a situation in which all three tunneling amplitudes are finite ( @xmath52 ) @xcite .",
    "the sizable hopping @xmath22 between @xmath53 s appears if the distance between them is shorter that the characteristic correlation length .",
    "if majorana fermions @xmath54 are all close to @xmath55 it implies that the distance between @xmath56 and @xmath57 is of the same order",
    ". therefore one can not neglect the coupling between @xmath56 and @xmath57 , which is absent in eq . .",
    "in this case we generally expect that the hopping amplitudes between all @xmath53 s are non - zero .",
    "this impedes the quantum computation , because the degeneracy of the ground state has been removed , unless the coupling constants are tuned in a special way .",

    "we consider a system of four connected wires with majorana end modes , shown in fig.[fig : xjunction]a , that host eight majorana states .",
    "however the interaction between four majorana fermions at the center is parametrically stronger than with the majorana states at the ends and should be considered at the first stage , as described for y - junction in appendix c of ref .",
    "@xcite . if there are no special symmetries imposed on the system the degeneracy of the central states is completely lifted , and the remaining degrees of freedom are four weakly coupled majorana states @xmath58 .",
    "their hamiltonian ( after suppressing prime symbol ) is given by @xmath59 where @xmath60 is a skew - symmetric matrix .",
    "the special case of pairwise equality ( @xmath61 ) corresponds to eq .  .",
    "of course one can not rule out the accidental symmetry which may result in a setup where six majorana states remain gapless .",
    "though this situation is possible from a mathematical point of view , it is highly unlikely to occur , unless it is specially tuned .",
    "therefore we assume that the nearby majorana states at the center of the junction are gapped , while four at the far ends remain gapless .",
    "such tuning can be accomplished by applying external gates and magnetic flux , as was discussed in details in refs .",
    "clearly , the distance between majorana states restricts a minimal size of the gates .",
    "it is therefore reasonable to assume that the larger distance between end majoranas , @xmath62 in fig .",

    "one transforms the line integral to the area integral @xmath105 as we see , the geometric phase is a sum of two contribution . in the limit of @xmath106 ,",
    "@xmath107 one reproduces eq .  .",
    "in general case , however , there is a large freedom in choosing the trajectories , that are consistent with quantum computations .",

    "examining eq .",
    ", we see that the corresponding berry s phase is essentially given by the previous formula with the replacement @xmath108 .",
    "it means that in this type of evolution the difference @xmath109 between @xmath31 and @xmath110 plays no role , and does not contribute to berrys phase .",
    "this property might prove to be useful in error correction protocols such as , e.g. , proposed in @xcite .",
    "in the second protocol we consider , the value of @xmath111 is fixed , and the overall berry s phase is given only by the first integral in , which is one half of the expression . in particular , the desired value of @xmath112 is provided by the previous trajectory around the octant of the sphere , fig .",

    "in this paper we studied the manipulation of majorana fermions coupled by x - junction . unlike a more conventional y - junction geometry",
    ", this setup requires a special tuning , in order to maintain the degeneracy of its ground state .",
    "the bright side of this method is a big parameter space that allows to perform necessary unitary transformations . within this space",
    "there is a surface , where two majorana bound states remain non - split .",
    "this surface is preserved under a group of unitary transformations , that factorizes into right and left isoclinic groups . provided that the coupling of the junctions are changed in accordance with this symmetry the acquired phase is unaffected by the dephasing , and the junction can be used as a quantum gate .",
    "we proposed a few examples of adiabatic manipulations , that are consistent with this requirement , and calculate the corresponding berry s phase .",
    "in particular , the trajectories generating the vlaue @xmath116 , as well as other simple fractions of @xmath117 , are demonstrated .",
    "the natural extension of this analysis are junctions with five and more connectors . in this case",
    ", the system has a higher symmetry , and one expects more ways to perform the dephasing - free unitary transformations .",
    "aiming at applications , we understand that in possible realization the dephasing due to noise in the control gates could be quite substantial so that the x - junction would not be very different from any other non - topological qubit .",
    "the previously discussed y - junction configuration is not immune to decoherence , which enters mainly via the @xmath2 gate .",
    "thus it would be interesting to know if the x - junction , with generally absent topological protection , could compete in this respect with the y - junction geometry .",
    "particularly it is yet to be seen , whether one can design a physical realization , that locks the junction on to dephasing - free surfaces on the hardware level .",
    "since the couplings in the hamiltonian are influenced by external noise , it implies a design where noise affects a few couplings in a correlated manner .",
    "unfortunately at this point , we were not able to propose a design based on realistic elements , where this locking takes place",
    ". however , even though a topologically protected quantum computation remains evasive , it may happen that dephasing time for a particular device will be sufficiently long for application .",
