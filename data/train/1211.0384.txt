    "physics of the bilayer quantum hall ( qh ) system is enormously rich owing to the intralayer and interlayer phase coherence controlled by the interplay between the spin and the layer ( pseudospin ) degrees of freedom@xcite . at the filling factor @xmath2 there arises a unique phase , the spin - ferromagnet and pseudospin - ferromagnet phase , which has well been studied both theoretically and experimentally .",
    "one of the most intriguing phenomena is the josephson - like tunneling between the two layers predicted in refs.@xcite , whose first experimental indication was obtained in ref.@xcite .",
    "other examples are the anomalous behavior of the hall resistance reported in counterflow experiments@xcite and in drag experiments@xcite .",
    "they are triggered by the supercurrent within each layer@xcite .",
    "quite recently , careful experiments @xcite were performed to explore the condition for the tunneling current to be dissipationless .",
    "these phenomena are driven by the goldstone mode describing an interlayer phase coherence .",
    "it exhibits the linear dispersion relation in the zero tunneling - interaction limit ( @xmath1 ) .    on the other hand , at @xmath0",
    "the bilayer qh system has three phases , the spin - ferromagnet and pseudospin - singlet phase , the spin - singlet and pseudospin ferromagnet phase , and a canted antiferromagnetic phase@xcite ( abridged as the caf phase ) , depending on the relative strength between the zeeman energy @xmath3 and the tunneling energy @xmath4 .",
    "the pattern of the symmetry breaking is su(4)@xmath5u(1)@xmath6su(2)@xmath6su(2 ) , associated with which there appear four complex goldstone modes@xcite .",
    "a part of them has been studied in refs.@xcite .",
    "we have recently analyzed the full details of these goldstone modes in each phase@xcite .",
    "the caf phase is the most interesting , where the spins are canted coherently and making antiferromagnetic correlations between the two layers .",
    "moreover , one of the goldstone modes becomes gapless and has a linear dispersion relation@xcite as @xmath1 .",
    "it is an urgent and intriguing problem what kind of phase coherence this goldstone mode develops .    in this paper , we show that it is the entangled spin - pseudospin phase coherence , and we explore associated phase coherent phenomena .",
    "we employ the grassmannian formalism@xcite , where the basic field is the grassmannian field consisting of two complex - projective ( @xmath7 ) fields .",
    "the cp@xmath8 field emerges when composite bosons undergo bose - einstein condensation@xcite .",
    "the formalism provides us with a clear physical picture of the spin - pseudospin phase coherence in the caf phase .",
    "furthermore , it enables us to analyze nonperturbative phase coherent phenomena , where the phase field @xmath9 is essentially classical and may become very large .",
    "we show that the supercurrent flows within the layer when there is inhomogeneity in @xmath9 .",
    "this is precisely the same as in the @xmath2 bilayer qh system .",
    "indeed , the supercurrent leads to the same formula@xcite of the anomalous hall resistivity for the counterflow and drag geometries as the one at @xmath2 .",
    "what is remarkable is that the total current flowing the bilayer system is a supercurrent carrying solely spins and not charges in the counterflow geometry .",
    "we note that the supercurrent flows both in the balanced and imbalanced systems at @xmath2 but only in imbalanced systems at @xmath0 .",
    "in the bilayer system an electron has two types of indices , the spin index @xmath10 and the layer index @xmath11 .",
    "they can be incorporated into 4 types of isospin index @xmath12 f@xmath13,f@xmath14,b@xmath13,b@xmath14 .",
    "the electron field @xmath15 has four components , and the bilayer system possesses the underlying algebra su(4 ) with the subalgebra @xmath16(2)@xmath17(2 ) .",
    "we denote the three generators of the @xmath16(2 ) by @xmath18 , and those of @xmath19(2 ) by @xmath20 .",
    "there are remaining nine generators @xmath21 , which are the generators of the r - spin operators .",
    "their explicit forms are given in appendix d in ref.@xcite .",
    "all the physical operators required for the description of the system are constructed as the bilinear combinations of @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "they are 16 density operators @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , and @xmath27 , where @xmath28 describes the total spin , @xmath29 measures the electron - density difference between the two layers .",
    "the operator @xmath30 transforms as a spin under @xmath31 and as a pseudospin under @xmath32 .",
    "it is @xmath30 that plays the key role in the entangled spin - pseudospin phase coherence in the caf phase .",
    "the kinetic hamiltonian is quenched , since the kinetic energy is common to all states in the lowest landau level ( lll ) .",
    "the coulomb hamiltonian is decomposed into the su(4)-invariant term @xmath33 and the su(4)-noninvariant term @xmath34 .",
    "the additional potential terms are the zeeman , tunneling , and bias terms , @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is the bias voltage which controls the density imbalance between the two layers .",
    "the total hamiltonian is @xmath37 .",
    "we project the density operators to the lll .",
    "what are observed experimentally are the classical densities , which are expectation values such as @xmath38 , where @xmath39 represents a generic state in the lll .",

    "this effective hamiltonian is valid at @xmath51 .",
    "the ground state is obtained by minimizing the effective hamiltonian ( [ su4hamil ] ) for homogeneous configurations of the classical densities .",
    "the order parameters are the classical densities for the ground state .",
    "they are explicitly given in ref.@xcite for the @xmath0 system .",
    "in the limit @xmath1 , they read @xmath52 and all others being zero .",
    "here , @xmath53 is the imbalance parameter with @xmath54 being the electron density in the front ( back ) layer .",
    "both the spin and the pseudospin are polarized into the @xmath55-axis in this limit .",
    "we have analyzed the excitations around the classical ground state@xcite .",
    "there emerge four complex goldstone modes associated with the spontaneous symmetry breaking su(4)@xmath5u(1)@xmath6su(2)@xmath56su(2 ) . when @xmath57 and @xmath58 , the su(4 ) symmetry is exact and all of them are gapless , but they get gapped by these interactions .",
    "we are interested in the limit @xmath1 since we expect the enhancement of the interlayer phase coherence just as in the @xmath59 system .",
    "we have already shown that there exists one gapless goldstone mode with a linear dispersion relation in a perturbation theory@xcite .    in this paper",
    "we employ the grassmannian formalism@xcite to make the physical picture of this goldstone mode and its phase coherence clearer , and to construct a nonperturbative theory in terms of the density difference field @xmath60 and its conjugate phase field @xmath61 .",
    "the grassmannian field @xmath62 consists of two @xmath7 fields @xmath63 and @xmath64 at @xmath0 , since there are two electrons per one landau site . due to the pauli exclusion principle",

    "it is a straightforward task to carry out the perturbative analysis of the effective hamiltonian ( [ su4hamil ] ) in terms of the grassmannian field and obtain the same results as given in ref.@xcite .",
    "we concentrate solely on the gapless mode in the limit @xmath1 .",
    "we parametrize the @xmath7 fields as @xmath73 for @xmath74 , and @xmath75 for @xmath76 .",

    "the ground - state expectation values are @xmath78 , @xmath79 , with which the order parameters are reproduced from ( [ isospin ] ) .",
    "it is notable that the fluctuations of the phase field @xmath61 affect both spin and pseudospin components of the @xmath80-spin .",
    "this is very different from the spin wave in the monolayer qh system or the pseudospin wave in the bilayer qh system at @xmath2 .",
    "hence we call it the entangled spin - pseudospin phase field @xmath61 .    by substituting ( [ isospin ] ) into ( [ su4hamil ] ) ,",
    "apart from irrelevant constant terms the resulting effective hamiltonian is @xmath81 where @xmath82 , @xmath83 , and @xmath84 is the capacitance parameter at @xmath2 .",

    "it may be regarded as a classical hamiltonian as well , where ( [ cr ] ) should be replaced with the corresponding poisson bracket .",
    "the effective hamiltonian ( [ effechamil ] ) for @xmath61 and @xmath60 reminds us of the one that governs the josephson - like effect at @xmath2 .",
    "the main difference is the absence of the tunneling term , as implies that there exists no josephson - like tunneling . nevertheless , the supercurrent is present within the layer , which is our main issue .",
