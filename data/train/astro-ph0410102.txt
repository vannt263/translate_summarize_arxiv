    "white dwarf envelope models with steady hydrogen burning have been calculated for realistic compositions of white dwarf envelopes in classical novae , and their evolution has been approximated as a sequence of steady states .",
    "three chemical compositions for one novae have been considered , corresponding to models from @xcite with 25% , 50% and 75% mixing between the solar accreted matter and the degenerate core .",
    "results show that , for a given white dwarf mass and composition , the envelope evolves in the hr diagram increasing its effective temperature along a plateau of quasi - constant luminosity , while its mass slowly decreases due to hydrogen burning .",
    "when the envelope mass is reduced to the minimum value for steady hydrogen burning , the source turns - off .",
    "this occurs just when the maximum effective temperature is reached .",
    "both the luminosity and the envelope mass during the plateau depend on the white dwarf mass and hydrogen mass fraction .",
    "the behaviors of luminosity and envelope mass as a function of white dwarf mass and hydrogen mass fraction can be approximated by the expressions    @xmath0    @xmath1",
    "we have compared @xcite results on the soft component of v1974 cyg ( nova cygni 1992 ) during the plateau phase with our steady hydrogen burning white dwarf envelope models . in fig .",
    "[ figures ] , the @xmath2 contours of the spectral parameters found by balman , krautter , & gelman ( 1998 ) are plotted over the photospheric radius - effective temperature results from our envelope models with 25% and 50% mixing . for each model , the lower panels show the corresponding envelope mass with the time intervals ( in days ) for quasi - static evolution .",
    "it is clear that the large error bars on the photospheric radius , due to the uncertainty on the distance , prevent any clear comparison with the value predicted by the models .",
    "nevertheless , the comparison of the observed evolution of the effective temperature alone with the models indicates that the soft x - ray emission of v1974 cyg is compatible with the evolution of an envelope with steady hydrogen burning , on either a 0.9 m@xmath3 white dwarf with 50% mixing , or 1.0 m@xmath3 with 25% mixing .",
    "note that this comparison based on the effective temperature is independent from the distance determination .    in any case",
    ", the envelope mass for stable hydrogen burning ( @xmath4 m@xmath3 ) is much smaller than the mass needed to trigger the nova outburst for these masses and compositions ( @xmath5 m@xmath3 , jos & hernanz 1998 ) . as the ejected fraction , according to hydrodynamical models , is not sufficient to reduce the envelope mass down to the values for stable hydrogen burning , it is clear that some extra mass loss mechanism must be present after the outburst ."
