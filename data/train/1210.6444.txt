    "during development , vertebrate embryos pass through a `` phylotypic '' stage , during which their morphology is most similar between different species .",
    "this gave rise to the hourglass model , which predicts the highest developmental constraints during mid - embryogenesis .",
    "in the last decade a large effort has been made to uncover the relation between developmental constraints and the evolution of genome .",
    "several studies reported gene characteristics that change according to the hourglass model , e.g. , sequence conservation , age or expression . here , we first show that some of the previous conclusions do not hold out under detailed analysis of the data .",
    "then , we discuss the disadvantages of the standard evo - devo approach , i.e. , comparing descriptive statistics of all genes across development . results of such analysis are biased by genes expressed constantly during development ( housekeeping genes ) . to overcome this limitation we use a modularization approach , which reduces the complexity of the data and assures independency between the sets of genes which are compared .",
    "we identified distinct sets of genes ( modules ) with time - specific expression in zebrafish development and analyzed their conservation of sequence , gene expression and regulatory elements , as well as their age , and orthology relationships .",
    "interestingly , we found different patterns of developmental constraints for different genes properties . only conserved regulatory regions",
    "follow an hourglass pattern .",
    "developmental constraints have been suggested to play an important role in shaping the evolution of embryonic development in animals .",
    "briefly , the concept of developmental constraints assumes that the scope of developmental mechanisms limits the set of phenotypes that may evolve .",
    "thus , morphological similarities between embryos of different species could reflect these underlying constraints @xcite .",
    "two main models of embryonic developmental constraints have been put forward .",
    "the _ early conservation _ model predicts that the highest developmental constraints occur at the beginning of embryogenesis .",
    "this corresponds to von baer s third law @xcite , postulating that embryos of different species progressively diverge from one another during ontogeny .",
    "however , in modern times , the highest morphological similarity between embryos of different species was observed in the _ phylotypic stage _",
    "( i.e. , mid - embryogenesis ) @xcite . consequently , duboule @xcite and raff @xcite proposed the so - called _ hourglass _ model , which has since become widely accepted ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "it predicts the highest developmental constraints during mid - embryogenesis .    at the genomic level ,",
    "the hourglass model was originally linked to the expression of hox genes in animals @xcite .",
    "more recently , the emphasis has shifted to the relation , if any , between developmental constraints and the evolution and function of the genome ( reviewed in @xcite ) .",
    "different studies have reported several characteristics supporting the hourglass model in animals on the genomic level .",
    "hazkani - covo et al .",
    "@xcite reported the highest protein sequence similarity between mouse and human for genes expressed in mid - development .",
    "in two influential papers , domazet - loo and tautz @xcite reported that the genes expressed in mid - development of zebrafish are older than genes expressed early or late , while kalinka et al .",
    "@xcite showed that genes expressed in mid - development of fruit flies have the highest expression conservation .",
    "similarly , irie and kuratani @xcite reported the highest expression conservation between zebrafish , frog , chicken and mouse , for genes expressed in mid - development .",
    "very recently , the hourglass model was argued to hold also for plants embryogenesis with respect to gene age and sequence conservation @xcite .",
    "however , some of these results do not hold out under a detailed analyses ( see box 1 and supplementary materials ) . for example , applying a standard log - transformation @xcite to microarray signal intensities used in @xcite changes the reported pattern such that it no longer supports the hourglass model ( figure 1 ) .",
    "moreover , other studies have also found genetic patterns supporting an early conservation model @xcite .    in most of the studies of developmental constraints",
    "the authors compared descriptive statistics of all genes across all developmental time - points ( e.g. , median expression @xcite , weighted mean age @xcite , mean expression correlation @xcite ) .",
    "such an approach introduces dependencies between the sets of genes which are compared , and consequently can produce results biased by genes expressed at many time - points .",
    "for example , housekeeping genes contribute to the average gene expression at all time points , and hence dilute trends . to overcome this essential problem ,",
    "we have used a _ modularization _",
    "approach , which we applied to the recently published transcriptome data of zebrafish development @xcite .",
    "we decomposed the genes into independent sets , i.e. , _ modules _ , that contained genes overexpressed solely in one of seven developmental stages : cleavage / blastula , gastrula , segmentation , pharyngula , larva , juvenile and adult .",
    "this decomposition allowed us to compare only sets of genes that have specific functions during embryonic development .",
    "for each of the seven modules , we studied five properties of its genes : 1 ) gene sequence conservation , 2 ) gene age , 3 ) gene expression conservation , 4 ) gene orthology relationships , and 5 ) regulatory elements conservation .    here ,",
    "we show that different levels of molecular evolution follow different patterns of developmental constraints .",
    "first , the regulatory elements are most conserved for transcription factors expressed at mid - development , consistent with the hourglass model .",
    "contrary to what has been reported previously @xcite , we did not detect the hourglass pattern for gene sequence , age and expression .",
    "second , constraints on gene duplication and on new gene introduction are the strongest in early development , supporting the early conservation model ( consistent with @xcite ) .",
    "finally , all gene properties displayed the least conservation in late development and adult , which is in agreement with both models of developmental constraints .",
    "our goal was to analyze the developmental constraints acting on different gene properties .",
    "to this end we identified and analyzed groups of genes co - expressed during distinct developmental stages .",
    "we applied the iterative signature algorithm ( isa ) @xcite to the zebrafish expression data published by domazet - loo and tautz @xcite , which measured the dynamics of the transcriptome during development with a resolution of 60 time points .",
    "the isa is a modularization algorithm that finds genes with similar expression profiles and groups them into so - called transcription modules . in order to detect modules of genes with specific expression during the zebrafish development , we initialized the isa with seven idealized expression profiles that corresponded to successive developmental stages ( see supplementary materials and supplementary figure s10 ) .",
    "we obtained seven modules , each containing genes overexpressed during one of the following developmental stages : cleavage / blastula , gastrula , segmentation , pharyngula , larva , juvenile and adult ( figure [ fig:0 ] ) .",
    "overall , the modules covered the entire development .",
    "the phylotypic stage in which the hourglass model predicts the highest evolutionary constraint corresponds to the segmentation and pharyngula modules .",
    "we will refer to these two modules as phylotypic modules .",
    "the cleavage / blastula and gastrula modules will be referred to as early modules , and larva , juvenile and adult modules as late modules .",
    "the adjacent modules partially overlapped in their gene content . in order to allow for unbiased cross - module comparisons , genes belonging to two modules",
    "were kept in the one with the highest isa gene score ( see methods ) ; this concerned @xmath0 genes in total .",
    "the seven modules , i.e. , cleavage / blastula , gastrula , pharyngula , segmention , larva , juvenile and adult , contained @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 genes , respectively ( see supplementary table s3 for the lists of the genes ) .",
    "overall , @xmath8 different genes were present in these modules , which implies a significant reduction of the number of genes being analyzed in comparison to the original data ( @xmath9 genes on the microarray ) . in particular , the isa removed the bias related to the genes expressed uniformly across development ( like housekeeping genes ) .",
    "we verified the function of genes in modules detected by the isa by comparing them to relevant known lists of genes .",
    "we found that the cleavage / blastula module was significantly enriched in maternal genes identified in @xcite ( 36 genes vs. 19 expected by chance ; hypergeometric test , @xmath10 ) , and the gastrula module was highly significantly enriched in post - midblastula transition ( post - mbt ) genes identified in @xcite ( 78 genes vs. 25 expected by chance ; hypergeometric test , @xmath11 ) .",
    "we confirmed the relevance of the segmentation and pharyngula modules by verifying that they were enriched in hox genes ( 24 and 7 genes vs. 1 expected by chance , respectively ; hypergeometric test , @xmath12 and @xmath13 , respectively ) , which is consistent with their role in mid - development @xcite .",
    "we did not have any gold standard for genes expressed at the late stages of development .",
    "however , since the early and phylotypic modules were enriched in genes with relevant functions , we are confident that the same is true for the late modules .",
    "moreover , go enrichment analysis confirmed that genes from the modules were enriched in functions relevant to the respective developmental stages .",
    "for example , the cleavage / blastula module was enriched in genes involved in protein phosphorylation and dephosphorylation processes , which is consistent with kinase - dependent control of cell cycle and regulation of mid - blastula transition ( mbt ) in vertebrates @xcite .",
    "the pharyngula module was enriched in genes associated with cell differentiation , and anatomical structure development . finally , the adult module was enriched in genes involved in responses to environment , although not significantly ( supplementary table s2 ) .",
    "we checked whether the sequences of genes from different modules evolved under different selective pressure . to this end , we calculated the non - synonymous to synonymous substitution ratios ( @xmath14 ) for genes in the modules and asked if the ratio was significantly lower for any of them . with the early conservation model , we would expect the lowest @xmath14 values for genes from early modules . whereas with the hourglass model",
    ", we would expect the lowest @xmath14 values for genes from the phylotypic modules . in the cleavage / blastula module",
    "the median @xmath14 was not different from the median @xmath14 for all genes ( equal to 0.15 ) . in the other four modules covering embryonic development the median",
    "@xmath14 was lower than the median @xmath14 for all genes ( figure [ fig:1]a ) , and the difference was significant for all but the segmentation module ( randomization test , @xmath15 for the gastrula , pharyngula and larva modules ) . in the juvenile module , the median @xmath14 was significantly higher than the median @xmath14 for all genes ( randomization test , @xmath16 ) . in the adult module ,",
    "the median @xmath14 was also higher than the median @xmath14 for all genes , but the difference was not significant .",
    "when analyzing separately sites under purifying selection or evolving neutrally , we also find weaker purifying selection during post - embryonic stages ( see supplementary materials and supplementary figure s11 ) .",
    "these results were consistent with the study by roux and robinson - rechavi @xcite , who also reported equally low @xmath14 values during the entire zebrafish embryogenesis , and a small increase in mid - larva , juvenile and adult .",
    "in contrast , hazkani - covo et al .",
    "@xcite reported an hourglass pattern for protein distance between mouse and human genes expressed during development .",
    "however , the trend was not significant . in @xcite some evidence for early conservation was reported in mouse . projecting the genes from zebrafish modules to mouse - human orthologs",
    ", we found equal conservation across development ( supplementary figure s12 ) .",
    "overall , data analyses support similar evolutionary constraints on sequences of genes expressed during whole embryogenesis of zebrafish , while for mouse more developmental data is needed to be conclusive .      the differences in age of genes expressed during different stages of the development",
    "have been suggested to be a good indicator of evolutionary constraints @xcite .",
    "thus , we investigated the age of genes belonging to different modules .",
    "we dated each gene by its first appearance in the phylogeny and assigned it to one of the five age groups : 1 ) fungi / metazoa , 2 ) bilateria , 3 ) coelomata+chordata , 4 ) euteleostomi and 5 ) clupeocephala+__danio rerio__. next , for each module we calculated the age distribution of its genes , i.e. , the number of genes belonging to each age group , and compared it with the age distribution of all genes .",
    "for all but the cleavage / blastula module we detected significant age variations which differed across modules ( figure [ fig:1]b ; chi - square goodness of fit test , all @xmath17 ) .",
    "the oldest genes which belong to the fungi / metazoa class were overrepresented in the gastrula module ( 36.7% of genes in the module vs. 25.7% of all genes ) .",
    "the younger bilateria genes were overrepresented in the phylotypic modules ( 45.5% and 52.1% of genes in the segmentation and pharyngula modules , respectively , vs. 34.4% of all genes ) .",
    "the youngest genes were overrepresented in the late modules ( e.g. , for eutelostomi genes : 25.7% , 35.1% and 35.6% of such genes in larva , juvenile and adult modules , respectively , vs. 18% of all genes ) .",
    "in contrast , domazet - loo and tautz @xcite reported that genes expressed in early and late development tend to be younger than genes expressed in mid - development , supporting the hourglass model . yet , that result does not hold for log - transformed gene expression levels ( box 1 ) , and is not recovered with measures of gene age other than the transcriptome age index ( see supplementary materials and supplementary figure s6 ) . with the modular approach we observed that the age of expressed genes decreased throughout ontogeny .",
    "this pattern suggests that the oldest evolutionary stages tend to express the oldest genes .",
    "both gene duplication and gene loss can impact phenotypic evolution @xcite .",
    "the outcome of these events can be summarized by the resulting gene family size . consequently , constrained developmental stages should display less changes in gene family size than other stages . to test this hypothesis , for each zebrafish module we calculated the number of its genes that were in 1 ) one - to - one , 2 ) one - to - many , 3 ) many - to - many , and 4 ) no orthology relation to mouse genes ( i.e. , no ortholog detectable by the criteria used in ensembl compara @xcite ) .",
    "we compared the observed distributions with the distribution of the ortholog relationships for all genes .",
    "we detected significant variations of the ortholog relationship for the cleavage / blastula module and for all three late modules ( chi - square goodness of fit test , all @xmath18 ) .",
    "moreover , the pattern of variation itself differed across different modules .",
    "the number of one - to - one orthologs decreased throughout development ( figure [ fig:1]c ) .",
    "it was significantly higher than expected only in the cleavage / blastula module ( @xmath19 of genes in the module vs. @xmath20 of all genes ) .",
    "in contrast , the number of genes with no orthologous relationship increased throughout development ( figure [ fig:1]c ) .",
    "it was significantly higher than expected only in the juvenile and adult modules ( 38.2% and 38.4% of genes in the two modules , respectively , vs. 20.4% of all genes ) , consistent with the excess of  young \" genes .",
    "a similar pattern was observed for many - to - many orthologs ( 10.4% and 7.8% of genes in the two modules , respectively , vs. 3.9% of all genes ) . finally , the number of one - to - many orthologs was higher than expected only in the larva module ( 45.6% of genes in the module vs. 30.3% of all genes ) , and did not differ from expectation in all other modules .",
    "these results were consistent with @xcite in which the genes retained in duplicates after the teleost - specific whole genome duplication were reported to have low expression early in the development .",
    "here , we recovered an analogous pattern with the modular approach , showing that the genes expressed early in the development are retained in duplicates less often than genes expressed later .",
    "note that our observation is not limited to whole genome duplication .",
    "in addition , we detected the highest number of novel genes amongst genes expressed late in the development .",
    "changes in gene expression are one of the main sources of morphological variation @xcite .",
    "the developmental constraints on gene expression might differ from those on the gene sequence @xcite .",
    "thus , for each module , we compared the mean expression profile of its genes with the mean expression profile of their one - to - one orthologs in mouse .",
    "we used two different data sets @xcite with expression values of mouse genes during the development .",
    "the use of two data sets was necessary , because there does not exist a single experiment covering the entire mouse development .",
    "the incompatibility of the two microarrays impaired the statistical strength of the analysis .",
    "for this reasons the results reported here should be regarded rather as qualitative than quantitative .    since homology can not be defined for individual developmental stages between zebrafish and mouse , we first mapped every time point to its broad metastage defined in bgee @xcite ( figure [ fig:2 ] ) .",
    "next , we calculated the mean expression level in every metastage .",
    "this resulted in six expression values for each gene during the development of mouse and zebrafish : zygote , cleavage , blastula , neurula , organogenesis , and post - embryonic stage .",
    "note that the mouse microarrays did not cover the gastrula stage at all . for each module we calculated the pearson s correlation between the mean expression of its genes and their mouse orthologs across the six metastages . for the cleavage / blastula module",
    "no correlation was detected , probably due to the incompatibility of the two mouse microarrays .",
    "nevertheless , there exists a plausible , biological interpretation of the differences in gene expression between the early stages of zebrafish and mouse development .",
    "zebrafish and mouse form two different embryological structures during blastulation , a blastula and a blastocyst , respectively .",
    "the blastocyst is a mammalian innovation that consists of an embryoblast ( that develop into structures of the fetus ) and a trophoblast ( that form the extraembryonic tissue ) .",
    "in contrast , there is no extraembryonic tissue in zebrafish .",
    "overall , the lack of correlation between gene expression for the early stages of mouse and zebrafish development could be explained by these structural differences . for other modules the correlation was positive ( figure [ fig:1]d ) ,",
    "however due to the low number of data points in the analysis , no correlation values were significant ( all @xmath21 ) .",
    "these results stood in contrast with the report by irie and kuratani @xcite who showed the highest conservation of gene expression in mid - development .",
    "however , a re - analysis of their data suggested that this observation was not significant ( see supplementary materials and supplementary figure s9 ) . also , both their and our studies shared problems related to the use of two data sets from different sources to cover mouse development .",
    "this and the lack of a straightforward homology between ontogenies of different species made it difficult to conclude on the conservation of gene expression during vertebrate development .",
    "cis_-regulatory hypothesis asserts that most morphological evolution is due to changes in _",
    "cis_-regulatory sequences @xcite .",
    "a reasonable prediction of this hypothesis is slower _",
    "cis_-element turnover in morphologically conserved developmental periods .",
    "we examined the presence of highly conserved non - coding elements ( hcnes ) @xcite and of transposon - free regions ( tfrs ) @xcite in the proximity of genes from each module . in the analysis of hcnes",
    ", we counted their number between zebrafish and mouse ( detected with @xmath22 identity ) in regions of @xmath23 base pairs upstream from the transcription start site .",
    "we found that only genes from the phylotypic modules were significantly enriched in hcnes ( hypergeometric test , @xmath24 , and @xmath25 for segmentation and phayrngula modules , respectively ) .",
    "we tested the sensitivity of the results by changing the analyzed regions length to @xmath26 and @xmath27 base pairs upstream from the transcription start site , by looking for hcnes in introns , and using hcnes detected with identity of @xmath28 . in all cases",
    ", we obtained similar results ( see supplementary table s1 ) . in the analysis of tfrs",
    ", we counted the number of genes from each module that have been associated with tfrs in zebrafish .",
    "importantly , these tfrs were reported to be conserved between vertebrates as distant as zebrafish and human .",
    "we found that only genes from the pharyngula module were significantly enriched in tfrs ( hypergeometric test , @xmath29 ) .",
    "the highly conserved non - coding elements and transposon - free regions are often associated with developmental regulatory genes , and with transcription factors ( tfs ) in particular @xcite . in order to confirm this association , we calculated the fractions of genes with hcnes or with tfrs in their proximity .",
    "we observed that for both features this fraction was higher for tfs than for all genes .",
    "importantly , we observed that only the phylotypic modules were enriched in tfs ( figure [ fig:1]e ) .",
    "this partially explained the enrichment in hcnes and tfrs for genes expressed in mid - development .",
    "in addition , hcnes were more often present in the proximity of tfs from the pharyngula module than in the proximity of tfs in general ( figure [ fig:1]e ; @xmath30 of tfs from the pharyngula module had at least one hcne in their proximity , and only @xmath31 of all tfs had at least one hcnes in their proximity ) . also tfrs were more often present in the proximity of tfs from the phylotypic modules than in the proximity of tfs in general ( figure [ fig:1]e ; @xmath32 and @xmath33 of tfs from the segmentation and pharyngula modules , respectively , had tfrs in their proximity , and only @xmath34 of all tfs had tfrs in their proximity ) . consequently",
    ", the enrichment in hcnes and tfrs for genes expressed in the phylotypic stage seems to be related to the regulation of developmental processes .",
    "interestingly , only few hox genes from phylotypic modules were associated with hcnes ( four hox genes from segmentation module ) , and with tfrs ( six hox genes from segmentation module , and one hox gene from pharyngula module ) .",
    "in addition , we checked for genes that preserved their specific ancestral order in the genome across metazoans ( so called conserved ancestral microsyntenic pairs , @xcite ) and are known to be involved in the regulation of development .",
    "we found that they were slightly overrepresented in the segmentation module , but only at the limit of statistical significance ( see supplementary materials ) .    finally , we checked for core developmental genes in each module ( see @xcite for the list of genes ) .",
    "these genes are known to be involved in the regulation of development , and to have highly conserved regulatory regions within different taxa , including , nematodes , insects and vertebrates @xcite .",
    "we detected a significant enrichment in these genes only in the pharyngula module ( @xmath35 core genes ; hypergeometric test , @xmath36 ) , supporting the hourglass model .",
    "our goal was to study developmental constraints acting on various gene properties in vertebrates .",
    "overall , we analyzed and compared five gene characteristics , namely the conservation of gene sequence , gene expression , and regulatory elements , as well as age and orthology relationships .",
    "to this end we identified distinct sets of genes with time - specific expression in zebrafish development , i.e. , genes over - expressed in one of the seven consecutive stages : cleavage / blastula , gastrula , segmentation , pharyngula , larva , juvenile and adult .",
    "we believe that the change in expression level is a reliable indicator of gene involvement in different stages , although genes might also play a role outside the stages of their highest expression .",
    "moreover , the modules contained genes overexpressed in relation to other stages , regardless of the absolute values of their expression .",
    "thus , lowly expressed genes were also considered by the modularization algorithm , as long as they displayed some variance in expression levels over developmental time .",
    "several features do not show any significant pattern over embryonic development , often in contradiction to previous reports .",
    "there is notably no evidence for change in selective pressure acting on sequences of protein - coding genes ( i.e. , @xmath14 ) over development ( in contrast to @xcite ) .",
    "unfortunately , the available data does not allow a strong conclusion concerning the conservation of expression ( in contrast to @xcite ) , despite the probable importance of this feature in the evolution of development . in this respect , the situation in vertebrates stands in contrast to the relatively clear results in flies @xcite , where the evolution of expression has been shown to be most constrained in mid - development .",
    "gene orthology relations support the early conservation model .",
    "we show that early stages are less prone to tolerate both gene duplication ( consistent with @xcite ) and gene introduction .",
    "the deficit in duplication in early development could also be due to a lack of opportunities for neo- or sub - functionalization in the anatomically simpler stages , which is not exclusive with strong purifying selection .",
    "the interpretation of transcriptome age is less straightforward .",
    "our observations suggest that the oldest evolutionary stages tend to express of the oldest genes .",
    "it is possible that early stages are evolutionarily oldest , and that this is why they are enriched in oldest genes .",
    "consequently , it is the presence of young genes in a module that would mark relaxed developmental constraints during the corresponding stage .",
    "however , neither early nor phylotypic modules are enriched in young genes ( euteleostomi and clupeocephala+__danio rerio _ _ ) , which suggests similar developmental constraints in early and mid - ontogeny . in any case , we do not find any support for the hypothesis that the phylotypic stage would be characterized by the oldest transcriptome ( in contrast to @xcite ) .",
    "while the modularization approach does not support several previous hypotheses of genomic traces of the phylotypic period , it allows us to distinguish a strong signal of conservation of gene regulation in mid - development .",
    "while this had not yet been reported in genomic studies , it is consistent with early descriptions of the phylotypic stage as characterized by hox genes body patterning activity @xcite . of note , the patterns that we observe are robust to the removal of hox genes ( data not shown ) , so they are more general than this original observation .",
    "we observed an excess of hcnes only for genes expressed in the pharyngula module , and an excess of tfrs only for genes expressed in the phylotypic modules .",
    "the enrichment in hcnes and tfrs has been related to developmental regulatory genes , and to transcription factors ( tfs ) in particular @xcite . indeed , we observed that more tfs were expressed in mid - development than in other stages .",
    "also , we showed that a significant proportion of tfs expressed in mid - development had conserved regulatory regions ( i.e. , hcnes and tfrs ) , in contrast to tfs expressed early or late .",
    "consequently , the enrichment in hcnes and tfrs for genes expressed in mid - development can be explained by both a higher number of tfs and a higher number of hcnes and tfrs for these tfs , than for genes expressed earlier or later .",
    "moreover , the pharyngula module was associated with core developmental genes .",
    "overall , these results suggest that mid - developmental processes have extremely high conservation of regulation .",
    "this conservation could translate into observed common traits of the phylum expressed at the phenotypic level during mid - development .",
    "in addition , core developmental genes are known to be present in different taxa ( e.g. , nematodes , insects and vertebrates ) , in each of which they have a conserved regulation that evolved in parallel @xcite .",
    "this could explain why the phylotypic stage is observed not only in vertebrates @xcite , but also in other phyla , e.g. , in arthropods @xcite .",
    "finally , for all of the features which we have considered there is at least some trend towards weaker evolutionary constraints in the latest stages : @xmath14 is higher in post - embryonic stages and there are less sites under purifying selection ( supplementary figure s11 ) ; correlation of expression is lowest for maternal , larval and adult genes ; young genes and genes with duplications in fishes or other vertebrates are overrepresented in late modules ; and genes expressed in juveniles and adults have the less hcnes and tfrs .",
    "although not all of these trends are significant , no feature shows stronger conservation in late development or adult .",
    "thus , while different aspects of gene evolution show constraints at different times of development , there appears to be a generally faster evolution of all aspects of larval , juvenile and adult genes . whether this is due to lower constraints ( i.e. , less purifying selection ) or to stronger involvement in adaptation ( i.e. , more diversifying selection ) , remains an open question .    in summary , we studied evidence for , or against , any particular pattern of developmental constraints by considering sets of genes with time - specific expression patterns . comparing",
    "such independent sets of genes with a clear function during embryogenesis resulted in cleaner and more fine - grained characterization of evolutionary patterns than previously reported .",
    "notably , we showed that different levels of molecular evolution follow different patterns of developmental constraints .",
    "the sequence of regulatory regions is most conserved for genes expressed in mid - development , consistent with the hourglass model .",
    "gene duplication and new gene introduction is most constrained during early development , supporting the early conservation model . whereas , all gene properties coherently show the least conservation for the latest stages , consistent with both the early conservation and the hourglass models .",
    "microarray data of zebrafish development were downloaded from ncbi s gene expression omnibus @xcite ( gse24616 ) .",
    "this study was performed on the agilent zebrafish ( v2 ) gene expression microarray . in total ,",
    "expression profiles for 60 developmental stages ( from unfertilized egg to adults stages ) were measured .",
    "the last ten stages ( 55 days - 1 year 6 months ) were measured separately for male and female .",
    "two replicates were made per time point , resulting in @xmath37 microarrays in total .",
    "for each microarray , values of gproccessedsignal were log10 transformed and normalized as follows . separately for each replicate , we equalized the expression signals between microarrays using the spike - ins reference , to account for different amounts of rna present throughout development .",
    "to this aim , we first quantile normalized the expression signal of all spike - ins from all microarrays .",

    "( box )    recent results of domazet - loo and tautz @xcite suggest that the oldest transcriptome set is expressed at the phylotypic stage , and that younger sets are expressed during early and late development , which support the hourglass model . to study the relationship between gene expression , ontogeny and phylogeny , the authors proposed a measure called the `` transcriptome age index '' , or tai .",
    "the tai was defined as the mean of the phylogenetic ranks ( `` phylostrata '' ) across genes , weighted by their microarray signal intensity values at each developmental stage .",

    "we found that applying a standard log - transformation to the intensity values changes the pattern , which then indicates older genes being expressed preferentially in early development ( figure 1 ) .",

    "<S> developmental constraints have been postulated to limit the space of feasible phenotypes and thus shape animal evolution . </S>",
    "<S> these constraints have been suggested to be the strongest during either early or mid - embryogenesis , which corresponds to the early conservation model or the hourglass model , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> conflicting results have been reported , but in recent studies of animal transcriptomes the hourglass model has been favored . studies usually report descriptive statistics calculated for all genes over all developmental time points . </S>",
    "<S> this introduces dependencies between the sets of compared genes , and may lead to biased results . here </S>",
    "<S> we overcome this problem using an alternative modular analysis . </S>",
    "<S> we used the iterative signature algorithm to identify distinct modules of genes co - expressed specifically in consecutive stages of zebrafish development . </S>",
    "<S> we then performed a detailed comparison of several gene properties between modules , allowing for a less biased and more powerful analysis . </S>",
    "<S> notably , our analysis corroborated the hourglass pattern only at the regulatory level , with sequences of regulatory regions being most conserved for genes expressed in mid - development , but not at the level of gene sequence , age or expression , in contrast to some previous studies . </S>",
    "<S> the early conservation model was supported with gene duplication and birth that were the most rare for genes expressed in early development . finally , for all gene properties we observed the least conservation for genes expressed in late development or adult , consistent with both models . </S>",
    "<S> overall , with the modular approach , we showed that different levels of molecular evolution follow different patterns of developmental constraints . </S>",
    "<S> thus both models are valid , but with respect to different genomic features . </S>"
