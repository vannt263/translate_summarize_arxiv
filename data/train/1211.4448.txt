    "<S> we investigate a simple model to explain inflation , neutrino masses and dark matter simultaneously . </S>",
    "<S> this is based on the so - called radiative seesaw model proposed by ma in order to explain neutrino masses and dark matter by introducing a @xmath0-odd isospin doublet scalar field and @xmath0-odd right - handed neutrinos . </S>",
    "<S> we study the possibility that the higgs boson as well as neutral components of the @xmath0-odd scalar doublet field can satisfy conditions from slow - roll inflation and vacuum stability up to the inflation scale . </S>",
    "<S> we find that a part of parameter regions where these scalar fields can play a role of an inflaton is compatible with the current data from neutrino experiments and those of the dark matter abundance as well as the direct search results . </S>",
    "<S> a phenomenological consequence of this scenario results in a specific mass spectrum of scalar bosons , which can be tested at the lhc , the international linear collider and the compact linear collider . </S>"
