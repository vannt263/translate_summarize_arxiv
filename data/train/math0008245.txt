    "an important property of the class of @xmath0dimensional manifolds with cubings of non - positive curvature is that they contain ` canonical ' immersed incompressible surfaces ( cf @xcite ) . in particular",
    "these surfaces satisfy the @xmath1plane and @xmath2line properties of hass and scott ( cf @xcite ) and so any @xmath3irreducible @xmath0manifold which is homotopy equivalent to such a @xmath0manifold is homeomorphic to it ( topological rigidity ) . in this paper",
    "we study the behaviour of these canonical surfaces under dehn surgery on knots and links .",
    "a major objective here is to show that in the case of a cubed manifold with tori as boundary components , there is a simple criterion to tell if a canonical surface remains incompressible after a particular dehn surgery .",
    "this result is very much in the spirit of the negatively curved dehn surgery of gromov and thurston ( cf @xcite ) and was announced in @xcite .",
    "many examples are given in @xcite .",
    "the key lemma required is a combinatorial version of dehn s lemma and the loop theorem for immersed surfaces of the type considered by hass and scott with an extra condition  the triple point property .",
    "we are able to give a simplified proof of the rigidity theorem of hass and scott for @xmath0manifolds containing immersed incompressible surfaces with this additional condition .    by analogy with the combinatorial dehn s lemma and the loop theorem , we are also able to find a combinatorial characterisation of the crucial idea of hierarchies in @xmath0manifolds , as used by waldhausen in his solution to the word problem @xcite . in particular ,",
    "if a list of embedded surfaces is given in a @xmath0manifold , with boundaries on the previous surfaces in the list , then a simple condition determines whether all the surfaces are incompressible and mutually boundary incompressible .",
    "this idea can be used to determine if the hierarchy persists after dehn surgery  for example , if there are several cusps in a @xmath0manifold then we can tell if dehn surgery on all but one cusp makes the final cusp remain incompressible ( cf @xcite ) .",
    "one should also note the result of mosher @xcite that the fundamental group of an atoroidal cubed @xmath0manifold is word hyperbolic .",
    "also in @xcite it is shown that any cubed @xmath0manifold which has all edges of even degree is geometric in the sense of thurston .",
    "this research was supported by the australian research council .",
    "in this section we introduce the basic concepts and definitions needed for the paper .",
    "all @xmath0manifolds will be compact and connected .",
    "all surfaces will be compact but not necessarily connected nor orientable .",
    "all maps will be assumed smooth .    a properly immersed compact surface not equal to a @xmath4sphere , projective plane or disk is _ incompressible _ if the induced map of fundamental groups of the surface to the @xmath0manifold is injective .",
    "we say that the surface is _ boundary incompressible _ if no essential arc on the surface with ends in its boundary is homotopic keeping its ends fixed into the boundary of the @xmath0manifold .    by the work of schoen and yau @xcite , any incompressible surface can be homotoped to be least area in its homotopy class , assuming that some riemannian metric is chosen on the @xmath0manifold so that the boundary is _ convex _",
    "( inward pointing mean curvature ) .",
    "then by freedman , hass , scott @xcite , after possibly a small perturbation , the least area map becomes a self - transverse immersion which lifts to a collection of embedded planes in the universal cover of the @xmath0manifold .",
    "moreover any two of these planes which cross , meet in proper lines only , so that there are no simple closed curves of intersection .",
    "we will always assume that an incompressible surface is homotoped to satisfy these conditions .",
    "alternatively , the method of pl minimal surfaces can be used instead of smooth minimal surfaces ( cf @xcite ) .",
    "however it is interesting to arrive at this conclusion from other considerations , which we will do in section [ s : topo ] , for the special surfaces associated with cubings of non - positive curvature",
    ". we will denote by @xmath5 the collection of planes covering a given incompressible surface @xmath6 in @xmath7 .",
    "@xmath6 satisfies the _",
    "@xmath8plane property _ for some positive integer @xmath8 if any subfamily of @xmath8 planes in @xmath5 has a disjoint pair .",
    "@xmath6 satisfies the _ @xmath2line property _ if any two intersecting planes in @xmath5 meet in a single line .",
    "finally , the _ triple point property _ is defined for surfaces @xmath6 which already obey the @xmath2line property .",
    "this condition states that for any three planes @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 of @xmath5 which mutually intersect in lines , the three lines cross in an odd ( and hence finite ) number of triple points .",
    "the triple point property rules out the possibility that the common stabiliser of the three intersecting planes is non - trivial .",
    "indeed , the cases of either three disjoint lines of intersection or three lines meeting in infinitely many triple points are not allowed .",
    "a non - trivial common stabiliser would require one of these two possibilities .",

    "irreducible _ if every embedded @xmath4sphere bounds a @xmath0cell .",

    "each link of a vertex of the cell structure is a triangulated @xmath4sphere so that any loop of edges of length three bounds a triangle , representing the intersection with a single cube , and there are no cycles of length less than three , other than a single edge traversed twice with opposite orientations .    note the conditions on the cubing are just a special case of gromov s cat@xmath12 conditions .",
    "the _ canonical surface _",
    "@xmath13 in a cubed @xmath0manifold is formed by gluing together the finite collection of squares , each obtained as the intersection of a plane with a cube , where the plane is midway between a pair of parallel faces of the cube .    1 .",
    "we consider cubed @xmath0manifolds which are closed or with boundaries consisting of incompressible tori and klein bottles . in the latter case",
    ", the boundary surfaces are covered by square faces of the cubes .",
    "such cubings are very useful for studying knot and link complements .",
    "2 .   in @xcite",
    "it is sketched why the canonical surface is incompressible and satisfies the @xmath1plane , @xmath2line and triple point properties .",
    "we prove this in detail in the next section for completeness .",
    "3 .   regions complementary to @xmath13 are cones on unions of squares obtained by canonically decomposing each triangle in the link of a vertex into @xmath0 squares .",
    "the complementary regions of @xmath13 in ( 3 ) are polyhedral cells .",
    "each such polyhedron @xmath14 has boundary determined by a graph @xmath15 whose edges correspond to arcs of double points of @xmath13 and whose vertices are triple points of @xmath13 . by construction , there is a unique vertex @xmath16 in the original cubing which lies in the centre of @xmath14 : the graph @xmath15 is merely the graph on @xmath17 dual to the triangulation determined by the link of @xmath16 in the cubing .",
    "the conditions on the cubing translate directly into the following statements concerning the graph @xmath15 . *",
    "every face has degree at least @xmath1 . *",
    "every embedded loop on @xmath17 meeting @xmath15 transversely in exactly two points bounds a disk cutting off a single arc of @xmath15 .",
    "* every embedded loop on @xmath17 meeting @xmath15 transversely in exactly three points bounds a disk which contains a single vertex of degree @xmath0 of @xmath15 .",
    "so the part of @xmath15 inside this disk can be described as a ` y ' .",
    "we will use @xmath13 to denote a subset of @xmath7 , ie , the image of the canonical surface and @xmath18 to denote the domain of a map @xmath19 which has image @xmath20 .",
    "a similar notational convention applies for other surfaces in @xmath7 .",
    "in this section we verify the properties listed in the final remark in the previous section .",
    "[ t:1 ]    the canonical surface @xmath13 in a cubed @xmath0manifold @xmath7 is incompressible and satisfies the @xmath1plane , @xmath2line and triple point properties .",
    "moreover @xmath13 is covered by a collection of embedded planes in the universal covering of @xmath7 and two such planes meet at most in a single line .",
    "also two such lines meet in at most a single point .",
    "we show first that @xmath13 is incompressible .",
    "of course this follows by standard techniques , by thinking of @xmath7 as having a polyhedral metric of non - positive curvature and using the cartan ",
    "hadamard theorem to identify the universal covering with @xmath21 ( cf @xcite ) .",
    "since @xmath13 is totally geodesic and geodesics diverge in the universal covering space , we see that @xmath13 is covered by a collection of embedded planes @xmath5 .",
    "however we want to use a direct combinatorial argument which generalises to situations in the next section where no such metric is obvious on @xmath7 .",
    "suppose that there is an immersed disk @xmath22 with boundary @xmath23 on @xmath13 .",
    "assume that @xmath22 is in general position relative to @xmath13 , so that the inverse image of @xmath13 is a collection @xmath24 of arcs and loops in the domain of the map @xmath25 with image @xmath22 .",
    "@xmath24 can be viewed as a graph with vertices of degree four in the interior of @xmath26 .",
    "let @xmath16 be the number of vertices , @xmath27 the number of edges and @xmath28 the number of faces of the graph @xmath24 , where the faces are the complementary regions of @xmath24 in @xmath29 .",
    "we assume initially that these regions are all disks .",
    "an euler characteristic argument gives that @xmath30 and so since @xmath31 , there must be some faces with degree less than four .",
    "we define some basic homotopies on the disk @xmath22 which change @xmath24 to eventually decrease the number of vertices or edges .",
    "first of all assume there is a region in the complement of @xmath24 adjacent to @xmath23 with two or three vertices . in the former case",
    "we have a @xmath4gon @xmath32 of @xmath29 with one boundary arc on @xmath23 and the other on @xmath24 .",
    "so @xmath32 has interior disjoint from @xmath13 and its boundary lies on @xmath13 . but by definition of @xmath13 , any such a @xmath4gon can be homotoped into a double arc of @xmath13 . for the @xmath4gon",
    "is contained in a cell in the closure of the complement of @xmath13 .",
    "the cell has a polyhedral structure which can be described as the cone on the dual cell decomposition of a link of a vertex of the cubing .",
    "the two arcs of the @xmath4gon can be deformed into the @xmath2skeleton of the link and then define a cycle of length two . by definition",
    "such a cycle is an edge taken twice in opposite directions .",
    "we now homotop @xmath22 until @xmath32 is pushed into the double arc of @xmath13 and then push @xmath22 slightly off this double arc .",
    "the effect is to eliminate the @xmath4gon @xmath32 , ie one arc or edge of @xmath24 is removed .",
    "next assume there is a region @xmath33 of the complement of @xmath24 bounded by three arcs , two of which are edges of @xmath24 and one is in @xmath23 .",
    "the argument is very similar to that in the previous paragraph .",
    "note that when the boundary of @xmath22 is pushed into the @xmath2skeleton of the link of some vertex of the cubing then it gives a @xmath0cycle which is the boundary of a triangle representing the intersection of the link with a single cube .",
    "therefore we can slide @xmath22 so that @xmath33 is pushed into the triple point of @xmath13 lying at the centre of this cube .",
    "again by perturbing @xmath22 slightly off @xmath13 , @xmath33 is removed and @xmath24 has two fewer edges and one fewer vertex .    finally to complete the argument we need to discuss how to deal with internal regions which are @xmath2gons , @xmath4gons or @xmath0gons . now @xmath2gons can not occur , as there are no @xmath2cycles in the link of a vertex .",
    "@xmath4gons can be eliminated as above .",
    "the same move as described above on @xmath0gons has the effect of inverting them , ie , moving one of the edges of the @xmath0gon past the opposite vertex .",
    "this is enough to finish the argument by the following observations .",
    "first of all consider an arc of @xmath24 which is a path with both ends on @xmath23 and passes through vertices by using opposite edges at each vertex ( degree @xmath1 ) , ie , corresponds to a double curve of @xmath34 .",
    "if such an arc has a self intersection , it is easy to see there are embedded @xmath4gons or @xmath2gons consisting of subarcs . choosing an innermost such a @xmath4gon or @xmath2gon , then there must be ` boundary ' @xmath0gons ( relative to the subdisk defined by the @xmath4gon or @xmath2gon ) if there are intersections with arcs .",
    "now push all @xmath0gons off such a @xmath2gon or @xmath4gon , starting with the boundary ones .",
    "then we arrive at an innermost @xmath2gon or @xmath4gon with no arcs crossing it and can use the previous method to obtain a contradiction or to decrease the complexity of @xmath24 .",
    "similarly if two such arcs meet at more than one point , we can remove @xmath0gons from the interior of an innermost resulting @xmath4gon and again simplify @xmath24 .",
    "finally if such arcs meet at one point , we get @xmath0gons which can be made innermost .",
    "so in all cases @xmath24 can be reduced down to the empty graph , with @xmath23 then lying in a face of @xmath13 .",
    "so @xmath23 is contractible on @xmath13 .",
    "it remains to discuss the situation when some regions in the complement of @xmath24 are not disks . in this case , there are components of @xmath24 in the interior of @xmath35 .",
    "we simplify such an innermost component @xmath36 first by the same method as above , working with the subdisk @xmath37 consisting of all the disks in the complement of @xmath36 and separated from @xmath23 by @xmath36 .",
    "so we can get rid of @xmath36 and continue on until finally all of @xmath24 is removed by a homotopy of @xmath22 .",
    "note that once @xmath22 has no interior intersections with @xmath13 then @xmath22 can be homotoped into @xmath13 as it lies in a single cell , which has the polyhedral structure of the cone on the dual of a link of a vertex of the cubing .",
    "this completes the argument showing that @xmath13 is incompressible .",
    "next we wish to show why @xmath13 has the @xmath1plane , @xmath2line and triple point properties . before discussing this , it is helpful to discuss why the lifts of @xmath13 to the universal covering are planes , without using the polyhedral metric .",
    "suppose some lift of @xmath13 to the universal covering @xmath38 was not embedded .",
    "we know such a lift @xmath9 is an immersed plane by the previous argument that @xmath13 is incompressible .",
    "it is easy to see we can find an immersed disk @xmath22 with boundary @xmath23 on @xmath9 which represents a @xmath2gon .",
    "there is one vertex where @xmath23 crosses a double curve of @xmath9 .",
    "but the same argument as in the previous paragraph applies to simplify the intersections of @xmath22 with all the lifts @xmath9 of @xmath13 .",
    "we get a contradiction , as there can not be a @xmath2gon with interior mapped into the complement of @xmath13 .",
    "this establishes that all the lifts @xmath9 are embedded as claimed .",
    "it is straightforward now to show that any pair of such planes @xmath39 which intersect , meet in a single line . for if there is a simple closed curve of intersection , again the disk @xmath22 bounded by this curve on say @xmath9 can be homotoped relative to the other planes to get a contradiction . similarly if there are at least two lines of intersection of @xmath9 and @xmath40 then there is a @xmath4gon @xmath22 with boundary arcs on @xmath9 and @xmath40 .",
    "again we can deform @xmath22 to push its interior off @xmath5 giving a contradiction .",
    "this establishes the @xmath2line property .",
    "the @xmath1plane and triple point properties follow once we can show that any three planes of @xmath41 which mutually intersect , meet in a single triple point . for then if four planes all met in pairs , then on one of the planes we would see three lines all meeting in pairs . but",
    "this implies there is a @xmath0gon between the lines and the same disk simplification argument as above , shows that this is impossible .",
    "there are two situations which could occur for three mutually crossing planes @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "first of all , there could be no triple points at all between the three planes . in this case the @xmath0gon @xmath22 with three boundary arcs joining the three lines of intersection on each of the planes can be used to give a contradiction .",
    "this follows by the same simplification argument , since the @xmath0gon can be homotoped to have interior disjoint from @xmath41 .",
    "secondly there could be more than one triple point between the planes .",
    "but in this case , in say @xmath9 , we would see two lines meeting more than once .",
    "hence there would be @xmath4gons @xmath22 in @xmath9 between these lines .",
    "the interiors of such @xmath4gons can be homotoped off @xmath41 and the resulting contradiction completes the argument for all the properties claimed in the theorem .    1 .",
    "in the next section we will define a class of @xmath0manifolds which are almost cubed .",
    "these do not have nice polyhedral metrics arising from a simple construction like cubings but the same methods will work as in the above theorem .",
    "this is the basis of what we call a combinatorial version of dehn s lemma and the loop theorem .",
    "2 .   in @xcite ,",
    "other generalisations of cubings are given , where the manifold behaves as if ` on average ' it has non - positive curvature .",
    "again the technique of the above theorem applies in this situation , to deduce incompressibility of particular surfaces .",
    "3 .   a key factor in making the above method work",
    "is that there must always be faces of the graph @xmath24 which are @xmath4gons or @xmath0gons .",
    "in particular the euler characteristic argument to show existence of such regions breaks down once @xmath22 is a @xmath1gon !",
    "an immersed surface @xmath13 is called _ filling _ if the closures of the complementary regions of @xmath13 in @xmath7 are all cells , for all least area maps in the homotopy class of @xmath13 , for any metric on @xmath7 .",
    "it is trivial to see that for the canonical surface @xmath13 in a cubed @xmath0manifold @xmath7 , all the closures of the complementary regions are cells .",
    "a little more work checks that @xmath13 is actually filling .",
    "in fact , one way to do this is to observe that any essential loop in @xmath7 can be homotoped to a geodesic @xmath23 in the polyhedral metric defined by the cubing .",
    "then this geodesic lifts to a line in the universal covering @xmath38 .",
    "a geodesic line will meet the planes over @xmath13 in single points or lie in such a plane .",
    "note that the lines of intersection between the planes are also geodesics .",
    "so if the given geodesic line lies in some plane , then by the filling property , it meets some other line of intersection in a single point .",
    "hence it meets the corresponding plane in one point .",
    "a homotopy of @xmath13 to a least area surface @xmath42 relative to some metric , will lift to a proper homotopy between collections of embedded planes @xmath41 and @xmath43 in the universal covering .",
    "this latter homotopy can not remove such essential intersections between the given geodesic line and some plane ( all points only move a bounded distance , whereas the ends of the line are an unbounded distance from the plane and on either side of it ) .",
    "so we conclude that any essential loop must intersect @xmath13 .",
    "therefore a complementary domain to @xmath42 must have fundamental group with trivial image in @xmath44 .",
    "the argument of @xcite shows that for a least area map of an incompressible surface , all the complementary regions are @xmath45injective .",
    "so such regions must be cells , as a cubed manifold is irreducible .",
    "note that @xmath3irreducibility for a cubed manifold can also be shown directly , since we can apply the same argument as above to simplify the intersections of an immersed sphere or projective plane with the canonical surface and eventually by a homotopy , achieve that the sphere or projective plane lies in a complementary cell .",
    "in @xcite it is observed that a @xmath0manifold has a cubing of non - positive curvature if and only if it has a filling incompressible surface satisfying the @xmath1plane , @xmath2line and triple point properties .",
    "this follows immediately from the work of hass and scott @xcite",
    "our aim here is to define a class of @xmath0manifolds which are almost cubed and for which one can still verify that the canonical surface is imcompressible and satisfies similar properties to that for cubings .",
    "in fact the canonical surface here satisfies the @xmath1plane , @xmath2line and triple point properties , but not necessarily the filling property .",
    "so as in @xcite , the closures of the complementary regions of @xmath13 are @xmath45injective handlebodies .",
    "these surfaces naturally arise in @xcite , where we investigate surgeries on certain classes of simple alternating links containing such closed surfaces in their complements .",
    "suppose that @xmath13 is an immersed closed surface in a compact 3manifold @xmath7 .",
    "we say that the closure of a connected component of the complement in @xmath13 of the double curves of @xmath13 , is a _ face _ of @xmath13 .",
    "suppose that @xmath22 is an immersed disk in @xmath7 with boundary @xmath23 on an immersed closed surface @xmath13 and interior of @xmath22 disjoint from @xmath13 .",
    "assume also that there are no such disks @xmath22 in @xmath7 for which @xmath23 crosses the double curves of @xmath13 exactly once .",
    "we say that _ @xmath22 is homotopically trivial relative to @xmath13 _ , if one of the following three situations hold :    1 .",
    "if @xmath23 has no intersections with the double curves of @xmath13 , then @xmath22 can be homotoped into a face of @xmath13 , keeping its boundary fixed .",
    "any @xmath4gon @xmath22 ( ie , @xmath23 meets the singular set of @xmath13 in two points ) is homotopic into a double curve of @xmath13 , without changing the number of intersections of @xmath23 and the double curves of @xmath13 and keeping @xmath23 on @xmath13 .",
    "any @xmath0gon @xmath22 is homotopic into a triple point of @xmath13 , without changing the number of intersections of @xmath23 and the double curves of @xmath13 and keeping @xmath23 on @xmath13 .",
    "note that these conditions occur in johannson s definition of boundary patterns in @xcite , @xcite .",
    "[ t:2 ]    assume that @xmath13 is an immersed closed surface in a compact 3manifold @xmath7 .",
    "suppose that all the faces of @xmath13 are polygons with at least four sides .",
    "also assume that any embedded disk @xmath22 with boundary @xmath23 on @xmath13 and interior disjoint from @xmath13 , with @xmath23 meeting the double curves two or three times , is homotopically trivial relative to @xmath13 and there is no such disk with @xmath23 crossing the double curves once .",
    "then @xmath13 is incompressible with the @xmath1plane , @xmath2line and triple point properties .",
    "moreover @xmath13 lifts to a collection of embedded planes in the universal cover of @xmath7 and each pair of these planes meets in at most a single line .",
    "if three planes mutually intersect in pairs , then they share a single triple point . also",
    "the closures of components of the complement of @xmath13 are @xmath45injective .",
    "finally if @xmath13 is incompressible with the @xmath1plane , @xmath2line and triple point properties then @xmath13 can be homotoped to satisfy the above set of conditions .",
    "the proof is extremely similar to that for theorem [ t:1 ] so we only remark on the ideas .",
    "first of all the conditions in the statement of theorem [ t:2 ] play the same role as the link conditions in the definition of a cubing of non - positive curvature .",
    "so we can homotop disks which have boundary on @xmath13 to reduce the graph of intersection of the interior of the disk with @xmath13 . in this way ,",
    "@xmath4gons and @xmath0gons can be eliminated , as well as compressing disks for @xmath13 .",
    "this is the key idea and the rest of the argument is entirely parallel to theorem [ t:1 ] .",
    "note that the closures of the complementary regions of @xmath13 are @xmath45injective , by essentially the same proof as in @xcite .",
    "the only thing that needs to be carefully checked , is why it suffices to assume that only embedded disks in the complementary regions need to be examined , to see that any possibly singular @xmath46gons , for @xmath47 , are homotopically trivial and there are no singular @xmath2gons .",
    "suppose that we have a properly immersed disk @xmath22 in a complementary region , with boundary meeting the set of double curves of @xmath13 at most three times and @xmath22 is not homotopic into a double arc , a triple point or a face of @xmath13 . if this disk is not homotopic into the boundary of the complementary region , we can apply dehn s lemma and the loop theorem to replace the singular disk by an embedded one .",
    "moreover since the boundary of the new disk is obtained by cutting - and - pasting of the old boundary curve , we see the new curve also meets the set of double curves of @xmath13 at most three times .",
    "so this case is easy to handle : it does not happen .",
    "next assume that the singular disk is homotopic into the boundary surface @xmath48 of the complementary region .",
    "( note we include the possibility here that the complementary region is a ball and @xmath48 is a @xmath4sphere ) .",
    "let @xmath23 be the boundary curve of the singular disk and let @xmath49 be a small regular neighbourhood of @xmath23 in @xmath48 .",
    "thus @xmath23 is null homotopic in @xmath48 .",
    "notice that there are at most three double arcs of @xmath13 crossing @xmath49 .",
    "now fill in the disks @xmath32 bounded by any contractible boundary component @xmath50 of @xmath49 in @xmath48 , to enlarge @xmath49 to @xmath51 .",
    "since @xmath23 shrinks in @xmath48 , it is easy to see by van kampen s theorem , that @xmath23 contracts also in @xmath51 .",
    "also if @xmath50 meets the double arcs of @xmath13 , we see the picture in @xmath32 must be either a single arc or three arcs meeting at a single triple point , or else we have found an embedded disk contradicting our assumption . for we only need to check that @xmath50 can not meet the double arcs in at least four points .",
    "if @xmath50 did have four or more intersection points with the singular set of @xmath13 , then one of the double arcs crossing @xmath49 has both ends on @xmath50 .",
    "but this is impossible , as there would be a cycle in the graph of the double arcs on @xmath48 , which met the contractible curve @xmath23 once .",
    "finally we notice that there must be some disks @xmath32 which meet the double arcs ; in fact at least one point on the end of each double arc in the boundary of @xmath49 must be in such a disk .",
    "for otherwise it is impossible for @xmath23 to shrink in @xmath51 , as there is an essential intersection at one point with such an arc .",
    "( this immediately shows the possibility that @xmath23 crossed the double curves once can not happen ) .",
    "so there are either one or two disks @xmath32 with a single arc and at most one such disk with three arcs meeting in a triple point .",
    "but the latter case means that @xmath23 can be shrunk into the triple point and the former means @xmath23 can be homotoped into the double arc of @xmath13 in @xmath51 by an easy examination of the possibilities .",
    "hence this shows that it suffices to consider only embedded disks when requiring the properties in theorem [ t:2 ] .",
    "this is very useful in applications in @xcite .    to show the converse , assume we have an incompressible surface which has the @xmath1plane , @xmath2line and triple point properties",
    "notice that in the paper of hass and scott @xcite , the triple point property is enough to show that once the number of triple points has been minimised for a least area representative of @xmath13 , then the combinatorics of the surface are rigid .",
    "so we get that @xmath13 has exactly the properties as in theorem [ t:2 ] .",
    "theorem [ t:2 ] can be viewed as a singular version of dehn s lemma and the loop theorem .",
    "for we have started with an assumption that there are no embedded disks of a special type with boundary on the singular surface @xmath13 and have concluded that @xmath13 is incompressible , ie @xmath45injective . in @xcite other variants on this theme are given .",
    "we say that @xmath7 is _ almost cubed _ if it is @xmath3irreducible and contains a surface @xmath13 as in theorem [ t:2 ] .",
    "it is interesting to speculate as to how large is the class of almost cubed @xmath0manifolds .",
    "we do not know of any specific examples of compact @xmath3irreducible @xmath0manifolds with infinite @xmath45 which are not almost cubed .",
    "suppose that @xmath7 is a compact @xmath3irreducible @xmath0manifold with boundary , which is almost cubed , ie , there is a canonical surface @xmath13 in the interior of the manifold .",
    "assume also that the complementary regions of @xmath13 include collars of all components of the boundary .",
    "suppose that a handlebody is glued onto each boundary component of @xmath7 to give a new manifold @xmath52 .",
    "if the boundary of every meridian disk , when projected onto @xmath13 , meets the double curves at least four times , then @xmath52 is almost cubed .",
    "this follows immediately from theorem [ t:2 ] , by observing that since the boundary of every meridian disk meets the double curves at least four times , there are no non - trivial @xmath46gons in the complement of @xmath13 in @xmath52 for @xmath53 and no @xmath2gons . hence @xmath52 is almost cubed , as @xmath13 in @xmath52 has similar properties to @xmath13 in @xmath7 .",
    "examples satisfying the conditions of the corollary are given in @xcite .",
    "in particular such examples occur for many classes of simple alternating link complements . in @xcite ,",
    "the class of well - balanced alternating links are shown to be almost cubed and so the corollary applies .",
    "our aim in this section is to give a similar treatment of hierarchies , to that of cubings and almost cubings .",
    "the definition below is motivated by the special hierarchies used by waldhausen in his solution of the word problem in the class of haken @xmath0manifolds @xcite .",
    "such hierarchies were extensively studied by johannson in his work on the characteristic variety theorem @xcite and also in @xcite .",
    "a _ hierarchy _ is a collection @xmath54 of embedded compact @xmath4sided surfaces @xmath55 , which are not @xmath4spheres , in a compact @xmath3irreducible @xmath0manifold , with the following properties :    1 .",
    "each @xmath56 has boundary on the union of the previous @xmath57 for @xmath58 .",
    "if an embedded polygonal disk @xmath22 intersects @xmath54 in its boundary loop @xmath23 only and @xmath23 meets the boundary curves of @xmath54 in at most @xmath0 points , then @xmath22 is homotopic into either an arc of a boundary curve , a vertex or a surface of @xmath54 , where @xmath59 is mapped into @xmath54 throughout the homotopy .",
    "3 .   assume an embedded polygonal disk @xmath22 intersects @xmath54 in its boundary loop @xmath23 only and @xmath23 has only one boundary arc @xmath60 on the surface @xmath57 , where @xmath61 is the largest value for surfaces of @xmath54 met by @xmath23 .",
    "then @xmath60 is homotopic into the boundary of @xmath57 keeping the boundary points of @xmath60 fixed .    1 .",
    "note that waldhausen shows that for a haken @xmath0manifold , one can always change a given hierarchy into one satisfying these conditions by the following simple procedures : * assuming that all @xmath57 have been picked for @xmath62 , then first arrange that after @xmath7 is cut open along all the @xmath57 to give @xmath63 , the boundary of @xmath56 is chosen so that there are no triangular regions cut off between the ` boundary pattern ' of @xmath63 ( ie , all the boundary curves of surfaces @xmath57 with @xmath62 ) and the boundary curves of @xmath56 .",
    "this is done by minimising the intersection between the boundary pattern of @xmath63 and @xmath64 . *",
    "it is simple to arrange that @xmath56 is boundary incompressible in @xmath63 , by performing boundary compressions if necessary .",
    "so there are no @xmath4gons between @xmath56 and @xmath57 for any @xmath62 .",
    "* finally one can see that there are no essential triangular disks in @xmath63 , with one boundary arc on @xmath56 and the other two arcs on surfaces @xmath57 for values @xmath65 , by the boundary incompressibility of @xmath56 as in the previous step .",
    "notice we are not assuming the hierarchy is complete , in the sense that the complementary regions are cells ( in the case that @xmath7 is closed ) or cells and collars of the boundary ( if m is compact with incompressible boundary ) .",
    "3 .   the next result is a converse statement , showing that the conditions above imply that the surfaces do form a hierarchy .",
    "[ t:3 ]    assume that @xmath66 is a sequence @xmath54 of embedded compact 2sided surfaces , none of which are @xmath4spheres , in a compact @xmath3irreducible @xmath0manifold @xmath7 with the following properties :    1 .",
    "each @xmath56 has boundary on the union of the previous @xmath57 for @xmath58 .",

    "the argument is very similar to those for theorems [ t:1 ] and [ t:2 ] above , so we outline the modifications needed .",
    "suppose there is a compressing or boundary compressing disk @xmath22 for one of the surfaces @xmath56 .",
    "we may assume that all the previous @xmath57 are incompressible and boundary incompressible by induction .",
    "consider @xmath24 , the graph of intersection of @xmath22 with the previous @xmath57 , pulled back to the domain of @xmath22 .",
    "then @xmath24 is a degree three graph ; however at each vertex there is a ` @xmath48 ' pattern as one of the incident edges lies in some @xmath57 and the other two in the same surface @xmath67 for some @xmath68 .",
    "we argue that the graph @xmath24 can be simplified by moves similar to the ones in theorems [ t:1 ] and [ t:2 ] .",
    "first of all , note that by an innermost region argument , there must be either an innermost @xmath69gon , @xmath4gon or a triangular component of the closure of the complement of @xmath24 .",

    "there is clearly an outermost @xmath4gon region in @xmath22 .",
    "next the second collection of arcs is either disjoint from this @xmath4gon or there is an outermost @xmath0gon . at each stage , there must always be an outermost @xmath4gon or @xmath0gon .",
    "( of course any simple closed curves of intersection just start smaller disks which can be followed by the same method .",
    "if such a loop is isolated , one gets an innermost @xmath69gon which is readily eliminated , by assumption ) .    by supposition",
    ", such a @xmath4gon or @xmath0gon can be homotoped into either a boundary curve or into a boundary vertex of some @xmath57 .",
    "we follow this by slightly deforming the map to regain general position .",
    "the complexity of the graph is defined by listing lexicographically the numbers of vertices with a particular label .",
    "the label of each vertex is given by the subscript of the first surface of @xmath72 containing the vertex .",
    "( cf @xcite for a good discussion of this lexicographic complexity ) .",
    "the homotopy above can be readily seen to reduce the complexity of the graph .",
    "note that the hypotheses only refer to embedded @xmath46gons but as in the proof of theorem [ t:2 ] it is easy to show that if there are only trivial embedded @xmath46gons for @xmath73 , then the same is true for immersed @xmath46gons , using dehn s lemma and the loop theorem .",
    "similarly , the hypothesis ( 3 ) of the theorem can be converted to a statement about embedded disks , using dehn s lemma and the loop theorem , since cutting open the manifold using the previous surfaces , converts the polygon into a @xmath4gon .",
    "this completes the proof of theorem [ t:3 ] .",
    "consider the borromean rings complement @xmath7 in the @xmath0sphere .",
    "we can find such a hierarchy easily as follows :    start with a peripheral torus as @xmath70 , ie , one of the boundary tori of the complement @xmath7 .",
    "next choose @xmath71 as an essential embedded disk with boundary on @xmath70 , with a tube attached to avoid the intersections with one of the other components @xmath74 of @xmath75 , the borromean rings .",
    "now cut @xmath7 open along @xmath70 and @xmath71 to form a collar of @xmath70 and another component @xmath76 .",
    "it is easy to see that @xmath76 is a genus @xmath4 handlebody and @xmath75 has two components @xmath74 and @xmath77 inside this , forming a sublink @xmath78 .",
    "moreover these two loops are generators of the fundamental group of @xmath76 , since they are dual ( intersect in single points ) to two disjoint meridian disks for @xmath76 .",
    "finally the loops are readily seen to be linked once in @xmath76 .",
    "now we can cut @xmath76 open using a separating meridian disk with a handle attached , so as to avoid @xmath78 .",
    "this surface @xmath79 can also be viewed as another spanning disk with boundary on @xmath70 having a tube attached to miss the other component @xmath77 of @xmath78 .",
    "so there is a nice symmetry between @xmath71 and @xmath79 .",
    "finally we observe that when @xmath7 is cut open along @xmath70 , @xmath71 and @xmath79 to form @xmath80 , this is a pair of genus two handlebodies , each of which contains one of @xmath74 and @xmath77 as a core curve for one of the handles , plus the collar of @xmath70 .",
    "so we can choose @xmath81 and @xmath82 to be non - separating meridian disks for these handlebodies , disjoint from @xmath75 , so that @xmath83 consists of collars of the three boundary tori .",
    "notice that the ` boundary patterns ' on each of these tori , ie , the boundary curves of the surfaces in the hierarchies , consist of two contractible simple closed curves and four arcs , two of which have boundary on each of these loops .",
    "the pairs of arcs are ` parallel ' , in that the whole boundary pattern divides each torus into six regions , two @xmath69gon disks , two @xmath1gon disks and two annuli ( cf figure 4 in @xcite ) .    as a corollary",
    "then to theorem [ t:3 ] , we observe that any non - trivial surgery on each of the two components @xmath77 and @xmath84 of @xmath75 gives meridian disks @xmath85 and @xmath86 which meet the boundary pattern at least four times .",
    "hence these surfaces form a hierarchy for the surgered manifold and so all such surgeries on @xmath77 and @xmath84 have the result that the peripheral torus @xmath70 remains incompressible .    1 .",
    "this can be proved by other methods but the above argument is particularly revealing , not using any hyperbolic geometry .",
    "a similar example of the whitehead link is discussed in @xcite and it is interesting to note the boundary pattern found there ( figure 4 ) is exactly the same as here .",
    "3 .   a very significant problem is to try to use the above characterisation of hierarchies to find some type of polyhedral metric of non - positive curvature , similar to cubings .",
    "this would give a polyhedral approach to thurston s uniformisation theorem for haken manifolds @xcite .",
    "in this section we give a different approach to the result of hass and scott @xcite that if a closed @xmath3irreducible @xmath0manifold is homotopy equivalent to a cubed @xmath0manifold then the manifolds are homeomorphic .",
    "this can be viewed as a polyhedral version of mostow rigidity , which says that complete hyperbolic manifolds of finite volume which are homotopy equivalent are isometric , in dimensions greater than @xmath4 .",
    "we refer to this as topological rigidity of cubed @xmath0manifolds .",
    "our aim here is to show that this rigidity theorem can be shown without resorting to the least area methods of freedman hass scott @xcite , but can be obtained by a direct argument more like waldhausen s original proof of rigidity for haken @xmath0manifolds @xcite .",
    "note that various generalisations of hass and scott s theorem have been obtained recently by paterson @xcite , @xcite using different methods .",
    "[ t:4 ] suppose that @xmath7 is a compact @xmath0manifold with a cubing of non - positive curvature and @xmath52 is a closed @xmath3irreducible @xmath0manifold which is homotopy equivalent to @xmath7",
    ". then @xmath7 and @xmath52 are homeomorphic .",
    "note that the cases where either @xmath7 has incompressible boundary or is non - orientable , are not so interesting , as then @xmath7 and @xmath52 are haken and the result follows by waldhausen s theorem @xcite .",
    "so we restrict attention to the case where @xmath7 and @xmath52 are closed and orientable .",
    "* step 1 * by theorem [ t:1 ] , if @xmath13 is the canonical surface for the cubed manifold @xmath7 and @xmath87 is the cover corresponding to the fundamental group of @xmath13 , then @xmath13 lifts to an embedding denoted by @xmath13 again in @xmath87 . for by theorem [ t:1 ] ,",
    "all the lifts of @xmath13 to the universal covering @xmath88 are embedded planes and @xmath89 stabilises one of these planes with quotient the required lift of @xmath13 .",
    "let @xmath90 be the homotopy equivalence and assume that @xmath28 has been perturbed to be transverse to @xmath13 .",
    "denote the immersed surface @xmath91 ) by @xmath92 .",
    "notice that @xmath28 lifts to a map @xmath93 between universal covers and so all the lifts of @xmath92 to @xmath94 are properly embedded non - compact surfaces .",
    "in fact , if @xmath95 is the induced cover of @xmath52 corresponding to @xmath87 , ie , with fundamental group projecting to @xmath96 , then there is an embedded lift , denoted @xmath92 again , of @xmath92 to @xmath95 , which is the inverse image of the embedded lift of @xmath13 .",
    "the first step is to surger @xmath92 in @xmath95 to get a copy of @xmath13 as the result",
    ". we will be able to keep some of the nice properties of @xmath13 by this procedure , especially the @xmath1plane property .",
    "this will enable us to carry out the remainder of the argument of hass and scott quite easily . for convenience",
    ", we will suppose that @xmath13 is orientable .",
    "the non - orientable case is not difficult to derive from this ; we leave the details to the reader .",
    "( all that is necessary is to pass to a @xmath4fold cover of @xmath87 and @xmath95 , where @xmath13 lifts to its orientable double covering surface . )    since @xmath28 is a homotopy equivalence , so is the lifted map @xmath97 .",
    "hence if @xmath92 is not homeomorphic to @xmath13 , then the induced map on fundamental groups of the inclusion of @xmath92 into @xmath95 has kernel in @xmath98 .",
    "so we can compress @xmath92 by dehn s lemma and the loop theorem .",
    "on the other hand , the ends of @xmath87 pull back to ends of @xmath95 and a properly embedded line going between the ends of @xmath87 meeting @xmath13 once , pulls back to a similar line in @xmath95 for @xmath92 . hence @xmath92 represents a non - trivial homology class in @xmath95 and so can not be completely compressed . we conclude that @xmath92 compresses to an incompressible surface @xmath99 separating the ends of @xmath95 .",
    "now we claim that any component @xmath100 of @xmath99 which is homologically non - trivial , must be homeomorphic to @xmath13 .",
    "also the inclusion of @xmath100 induces an isomorphism on fundamental groups to @xmath95 .",
    "the argument is in @xcite , for example , but we repeat it for the benefit of the reader . the homotopy equivalence between @xmath95 and @xmath13",
    "induces a map @xmath101 which is non - zero on second homology .",
    "so @xmath28 is homotopic to a finite sheeted covering .",
    "lifting @xmath100 to the corresponding finite sheeted cover of @xmath95 , we get a number of copies of @xmath100 , if the map @xmath102 is not a homotopy equivalence . now",
    "the different lifts of @xmath100 must all separate the two ends of the covering of @xmath95 and so are all homologous .",
    "( note as the second homology is cyclic , there are exactly two ends ) .",
    "but then any compact region between these lifts projects onto @xmath95 and so @xmath95 is actually compact , unless @xmath13 is non - orientable , which has been ruled out .    finally to complete this step",
    ", we claim that if @xmath100 is projected to @xmath52 and then lifted to @xmath103 , then the result is a collection of embedded planes @xmath104 satisfying the @xmath1plane property .",
    "notice first of all that all the lifts @xmath105 of @xmath92 to @xmath94 satisfy the ` @xmath1surface ' property .",
    "in other words , if any subcollection of four components of @xmath105 are chosen , then there must be a disjoint pair .",
    "this is evident as @xmath92 is the pull - back of @xmath13 and so @xmath105 is the pull - back of @xmath41 .",
    "then the @xmath1plane property clearly pulls - back to the ` @xmath1surface ' property as required .",
    "now we claim that as @xmath92 is surgered and then a component @xmath100 is chosen , this can be done so that the @xmath1surface property remains valid . for consider some disk @xmath22 used to surger the embedded lift @xmath92 in @xmath95 . by projecting to @xmath52 and lifting to @xmath94",
    ", we have a family of embedded disks surgering the embedded surfaces @xmath105 .",
    "it is sufficient to show that one such @xmath22 can be selected so as to miss all the surfaces @xmath11 in @xmath105 which are disjoint from a given surface @xmath10 containing the boundary of @xmath22 , as the picture in the universal covering is invariant under the action of the covering translation group .",
    "this is similar to the argument in @xcite .",
    "first of all , if @xmath22 meets any such a surface @xmath11 in a loop which is non - contractible on @xmath11 , we can replace @xmath22 by the subdisk bounded by this loop .",
    "this subdisk has fewer curves of intersection with @xmath105 than the original .",
    "of course the subdisk may not be disjoint from its translates under the stabiliser of @xmath11 .",
    "however we can fix this up at the end of the argument .",
    "we relabel @xmath11 by @xmath10 if this step is necessary .",
    "suppose now that @xmath22 meets any surface @xmath11 disjoint from @xmath10 in loops @xmath23 which are contractible on @xmath11 .",
    "choose an innermost such a loop .",
    "we would like to do a simple disk swap and reduce the number of such surfaces @xmath11 disjoint from @xmath10 met by @xmath22 .",
    "note we do not care if the number of loops of intersection goes up during this procedure .",
    "however we must be careful that no new planes are intersected by @xmath22 .",
    "so suppose that @xmath23 bounds a disk @xmath33 on @xmath11 met by some plane @xmath106 which is disjoint from @xmath10 , but @xmath22 does not already meet @xmath106 .",
    "then clearly @xmath106 must meet @xmath33 in a simple closed curve in the interior of @xmath33 .",
    "now we can use the technique of hass and scott to eliminate all such intersections in @xmath10 . for by the @xmath1surface property , either such simple closed curves are isolated ( ie not met by other surfaces ) or there are disjoint embedded arcs where the curves of intersection of the surfaces cross an innermost such loop .",
    "but then we can start with an innermost such @xmath4gon between such arcs and by simple @xmath4gon moves , push all the arcs equivariantly outside the loop . at each stage",
    "we decrease the number of triple points and eventually can eliminate the contractible double curves .",
    "the conclusion is that eventually we can pull @xmath22 off all the surfaces disjoint from @xmath10 .    finally to fix up the disk @xmath22 relative to the action of the stabiliser of @xmath10 , project @xmath10 to the compact surface in @xmath95 .",
    "now we see that @xmath22 may project to an immersed disk , but all the lifts of this immersed disk with boundary on @xmath10 are embedded and disjoint from the surfaces in @xmath105 which miss @xmath10 .",
    "we can now apply dehn s lemma and the loop theorem to replace the immersed disk by an embedded one in @xmath95 .",
    "this is obtained by cutting and pasting , so it follows immediately that any lift of the new disk with boundary on @xmath10 misses all the surfaces which are disjoint from @xmath10 as desired .",
    "this completes the first step of the argument .    *",
    "step 2*the remainder of the argument follows that of hass and scott closely . by step 1",
    "we have a component @xmath100 of the surgered surface which gives a subgroup of @xmath107 mapped by @xmath28 isomorphically to the subgroup of @xmath108 corresponding to @xmath89 .",
    "also @xmath100 is embedded in the cover @xmath95 and all the lifts have the @xmath1plane property in @xmath103 .",
    "all that remains is to use hass and scott s triple point cancellation technique to get rid of redundant triple points and simple closed curves of intersection between the planes over @xmath100 .",
    "eventually we get a new surface , again denoted by @xmath100 , which is changed by an isotopy in @xmath95 and has the @xmath2line and triple point properties .",
