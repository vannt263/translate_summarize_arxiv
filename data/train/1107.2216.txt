    "in this paper we shall address the broad topic of one - loop quantum corrections to kink masses in ( 1 + 1)-dimensional real scalar field theory models .",
    "kinks are solitary waves that arise in non - linear models .",
    "this kind of solution resembles at the classical level an extended particle , i.e. , they are localized , finite - energy objects .",
    "some particles in nature , mostly baryons , seem to be extended , although they are sometimes approximated by point particles in theoretical calculations . in 1961",
    "skyrme pointed out that , in a certain extension of the non - linear sigma model now called the skyrme model , there exist both 3d dispersive and solitary waves among their solutions @xcite . because the model attempted to describe low - energy hadron phenomenology , and",
    "because solitary waves are formed from a heavy classical lump of energy , the idea is natural : upon quantization , dispersive waves become light mesons -pions- and solitary waves give rise to heavy baryons -protons , neutrons- .",
    "this bold idea prompted the task of investigating solitary waves in the quantum domain , a task mainly performed in the seventies , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "the first theoretical studies in this issue were accomplished by dashen , hasslacher and neveu by studying the quantum @xmath5 and sine - gordon kinks . in 1974",
    "they succeeded in computing the one - loop correction to the classical mass of these solitary waves by developing the @xmath6-expansion of these ( 1 + 1)-dimensional field theories . from the work of these authors in papers",
    "@xcite emerged the dashen - hasslacher - neveu ( dhn ) formula for the kink mass quantum correction .",
    "the dhn formula demands knowledge of the spectrum of the variational second - order ( hessian ) differential operators valued at the kink / soliton solutions . in the s - g and @xmath5 models these operators are schr@xmath7dinger operators of p@xmath7schl - teller type ,",
    "whose spectral problem is solvable .",
    "moreover , the second - order fluctuation operators around the sg and @xmath8 kinks are respectively the first and the second of p@xmath7sch - teller hamiltonians in the hierarchy of transparent - reflection coefficient equal to zero- models of this type .",
    "this provides sufficient spectral information to achieve exact computation of the one - loop quantum correction to the kink masses through the dhn formula : 1 ) @xmath9 , 2 ) @xmath10 .",
    "apart from these two models the dhn formula has little computational value .",
    "the reason is that the hessian differential operator valued on the kink solution that emerges in other models has an unknown spectrum in general .",
    "therefore , computation of the one - loop quantum correction to the kink mass in a generic model required the development of a new procedure ; see the reference @xcite to find a summary of the work of our group on this issue during the last ten years .",
    "in fact , we started the new approach simultaneously with renewed interest about the problem of the quantization of classical lumps at the end of the last century .",
    "the new impetus came from the quantization of supersymmetric kinks , where the contributions associated with fluctuations of the bosonic and the fermionic fields balance each other , which avoids the need to identify the spectrum of the hessian operators involved in this problem .",
    "however , new subtleties concerning the effect of the boundary conditions come into play .",
    "several groups at stony brook / wien , @xcite , minnesota @xcite and mit @xcite addressed mixed issues in the problem by studying the impact made by using different types of boundary conditions - pbc , dirichlet , robin- , regularization methods -energy cutoff , mode number cutoff , high - derivatives- , and/or performed phase shift analysis , in connection with possible modifications due to the quantum effects of the central charge of the susy algebra @xcite .",
    "the stony brook / wien group formed by rebhan , van nieuwenhuizen , and wimmer , together with goldhaber , investigated the computations of mass shifts induced by one - loop fluctuations on supersymmetric kinks @xcite .",
    "the extreme elusiveness of this issue did not prevent those authors from identifying the old dhn formula as being based on a regularization method that sets a cutoff in the number of fluctuation modes to be counted , rather than the conventional energy cutoff .",
    "another group from minnesota university addressed the same problem by using high - derivative regularization , with susy being preserved by boundary conditions to find similar results .",
    "phase - shift analysis by an mit group -jaffe , graham , and collaborators- also led to some advances , in this case in a purely bosonic setting @xcite .",
    "our goal in this paper is threefold .",
    "first , we construct a better structural derivation of the dhn formula and provide the one - loop kink mass shifts of the sg- and @xmath8-kinks after a regularization by means of a cutoff in the number of modes .",
    "the same results are achieved by a treatment of the dhn formula based on the heat kernel / zeta function regularization of ultraviolet divergences .",
    "second , the method of zeta function regularization was invented by dowker and critchley and , independently by hawking , circa 1976 @xcite .",
    "the partition function of euclidean quantum field theories is a functional integral that , up to one - loop order in the @xmath6-expansion , is the inverse of the square root of the determinant of a differential operator of laplace type times the exponential of the classical euclidean action over @xmath6 . in our framework , the pertinent differential operators are those ruling small quantum fluctuations in the classical kink backgrounds . generically , the spectral information in these situations is grossly insufficient for identifying the generalized zeta function in terms of known spectral functions .",
    "fortunately , in the mid sixties de witt @xcite had already proposed the use of the high - temperature expansion of the kernel of the generalized heat equation related to the differential operator of laplace type to unveil the meromorphic structure of the generalized zeta function .",
    "to achieve this goal , one takes advantage of the link between generalized heat and zeta functions via mellin transforms , such that the residua at the poles of the generalized zeta function are proportional to the seeley coefficients of the heat kernel expansion @xcite .",
    "we shall use all this theoretical machinery in order to construct a formula for the one - loop quantum correction to the kink mass in a generic ( 1 + 1)-dimensional real scalar field theory as a truncated series in the seeley coefficients of the hessian heat function .",
    "third , the effectiveness of this method relies on the computation of the seeley coefficients .",
    "this is not an easy task and requires the solution of difficult recurrence relations between the seeley densities and integration of these densities over the whole real line . in this paper",
    "we shall improve our symbolic method implemented on a pc computer in a mathematica environment in two ways : 1 ) we shall adapt in an optimum way the range of the inverse temperature in the integral mellin transform to the number of seeley coefficients kept in the truncated formula .",
    "2 ) we shall use the first - order equations to skip the integration over the whole spatial line traded by integration in the field space between the two vacua connected by the kink .",
    "these two advances offers not only great computational advantage but also higher precision .",
    "the error in the computation of the one - loop sg - kink is diminished from @xmath11 to the @xmath2 and for the @xmath8-kink the reduction is from @xmath12 to the @xmath3 ! ! !",
    "but this is not all : several other models for which the spectral information is not available can now be treated and the one - loop mass shift calculated . among them the double sine - gordon model @xcite , the razavy potential @xcite , the bglm model @xcite and others .",
    "especially interesting is the application of the method to a family of trigonometric models interpolating between the sine - gordon and the re - scaled sine - gordon models",
    ". a family of deformations of the @xmath4 model @xcite will be also analyzed .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows . in section  . 2 and  .",
    "3 we shall review the standard lore about kink topological defects and their one - loop fluctuations .",
    "this review will allow us to fix the notation and to remark on some important features of this kind of solutions .",
    "section  .",
    "4 will be devoted to the dhn formula . a cutoff in the number of modes and ,",
    "alternatively , the generalized or spectral zeta function procedure will be used in the regularization of intermediate divergent quantities .",
    "we shall apply this formula to the @xmath13 and sine - gordon model examples . in section  .",
    "5 the seeley - gilkey - dewitt - abramidi heat kernel expansion will be introduced to express the generalized zeta function as an asymptotic series .",
    "we stress that the computation of the seeley coefficients only requires the form of the potential .",
    "again , we address the @xmath8 and sine - gordon model examples in order to check the accuracy of these formulas .",
    "section  .",
    "6 is devoted to obtaining the asymptotic formula to be summarized in a symbolic algorithm , whereas in section  .",
    "7 we construct an efficient program for that algorithm .",
    "we test the algorithm on the @xmath13 and sine - gordon models , gaining a feedback about the method .",
    "finally , in section ",
    ".8 we shall apply the program to several interesting scalar field theory models and families of models .",

    "there will be a discrete symmetry group @xmath47 and the set @xmath48 is the union of one or several orbits of the action of @xmath47 on any of the vacua : @xmath49 , where @xmath50 , is the little group in the @xmath51 orbit .",
    "the vacuum moduli space is in turn the set of orbits : @xmath52 .",
    "each field configuration in @xmath37 must comply with the asymptotic conditions @xmath53 in order to guarantee the finiteness of the energy ( [ energy ] ) .",

    "there can not exist static homogeneous solutions . in these sectors there are , however , spatially dependent static solutions of ( [ pde ] ) of solitary wave type : non dispersive non - linear waves , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "for static field configurations the pde ( [ pde ] ) reduces to the ode : @xmath61 the ode ( [ ode ] ) can be seen as the equation of motion of a mechanical system : understand @xmath33 as the particle coordinate , @xmath62 as the particle time , and @xmath63 as the particle potential energy .",

    "we are now ready to construct a program by means of a symbolic software application such as mathematica .",
    "the key process is to implement formula ( [ numericalcorrection ] ) in this algorithm . in order to obtain an estimation of @xmath370 we must compute the @xmath314 , @xmath371 , seeley coefficients .",
    "this computation requires the integration of the @xmath338 , @xmath371 , densities over the whole real line .",
    "previously , we need to identify @xmath372 densities @xmath373 using the recurrence relations ( [ capitalacoefficients ] ) in order to evaluate @xmath374 . for instance , the calculation of @xmath375 demands the computation of 441 densities of this type .",

    "the following results are obtained :    [ cols= \" < \" , ]     we remark an interesting behavior . at the @xmath408 limit the potential reduces to @xmath409 , i.e. , the pure @xmath4 lohe / khare model ; a new vacuum point @xmath410 arises , and the vacuum orbit becomes : @xmath411 .",
    "the @xmath412 goes to a configuration where the @xmath413 kink solution splits into two kinks , one connecting the vacua @xmath414 and @xmath410 and the other connecting @xmath410 and @xmath415 , each one close to the kink of the lohe / khare model , see figure 6 .",
    "note that as the parameter @xmath416 vanishes solutions ( [ solutionphi6 ] ) involve two separated lumps of energy .",
    "we observe in table 4 that the quantum correction to these particular kinks tends to infinity .",
    "the reason for this stems from the fact that the vacua that are connected by this kink give rise to different meson masses : @xmath417=4 $ ] and @xmath418=1 $ ] , see @xcite and references therein to see a treatment of this problem .",
    "in this paper and several earlier ones , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , we have elaborated a computational procedure to calculate one - loop kink mass shifts summarized in formula ( [ numericalcorrection ] ) supplemented with a very sophisticated use of symbolic mathematica software .",
    "the derivation of this formula is based on the high - temperature heat - kernel expansion plus the mellin transform , thus ending in some series of asymptotic type .",
    "the old dhn approach to this problem led , after zero point renormalization by subtraction of the vacuum from the kink energy mode - by - mode , to formula ( [ dhn ] ) which can be regularized either by a cutoff in the number of modes ( [ dhncr ] ) or by means of the generalized zeta function procedure : ( [ zolqc ] ) . except for the sine - gordon and @xmath8 kinks these formulas are useless from a computational point of view because of the lack of information about the spectra of the differential operators governing the fluctuations around other interesting kinks .",
    "more precisely , what we have achieved in this work is some conceptual advance in the understanding of formula ( [ numericalcorrection ] ) derived ( and exploited ) in the papers quoted above that hugely augmented the precision of the symbolic algorithm in our results on sine - gordon and @xmath8 one - loop kink mass shifts .",
    "more importantly , the asymptotic approach has been applied to other systems supporting kinks considered in the literature with a very high level of confidence and effectiveness .",
    "these results are even more remarkable because , to the best of our knowledge , there are no other ways of computing , even approximately , the one - loop kink mass shifts in these models . as a final remark on the advances reported here",
    "we stress a very appealing property of our improved method : very few data are necessary for the computation of one - loop kink mass shifts in this way . only the potential and the vacua connected by the kink",
    "are needed . the number of terms kept from the series is optimized in parallel to the choice of the integration range in the mellin transform .",
    "we plan to keep improving the asymptotic method by applying the procedure to more complex situations :    1",
    ".   the first target would be the computation of one - loop kink mass shifts when the kinks interpolate among vacua belonging to different points in the vacuum moduli space . in the @xmath4-model , this is always the case and the idea is to incorporate the improvements achieved here to the calculation of the @xmath4-kink mass shift performed in @xcite .",
    "there are many more models carrying this type of kink susceptible to analysis within the framework of the improved asymptotic approach .",
    "2 .   in kink - field theories with more than one scalar real field there are lots of very interesting kinks that can have one- two- or @xmath108-components different from zero .",
    "the one - loop kink mass shifts of the celebrated montonen - sarker - trulinger - bishop model @xcite-@xcite are computed in @xcite .",
    "now we have the possibility of remarkably improving the precision of our results . +",
    "another field theoretical system of this type is a two - component scalar field theory proposed by bazeia et al . in @xcite , who identified some isolated kinks .",
    "the solitary - wave solutions were unveiled by shifman and voloshin in @xcite , whereas we related these kinks to critical trajectories in some integrable or quasi - integrable dynamical systems in @xcite .",
    "the one - loop kink mass shifts were discussed in @xcite and again we expect to get closer to the exact answer by applying the improved asymptotic approach .",
    "bps states in the @xmath419-supersymmetric @xmath171-dimensional wess - zumino model are kink solutions of first - order equations derived from holomorphic superpotentials .",
    "derived in @xcite , they are crucia elements in the classification of @xmath419-supersymmetric integrable systems . in @xcite",
    "we discussed these special solitary waves from a real analytical point of view in order to compare them with the more traditional kinks arising in the models mentioned above .",
    "it seems natural to try the one - loop computation of mass shifts for these kinks restricting the theory to the bosonic sector : it is known that @xmath419 supersymmetry forces the quantum corrections to the bps masses to be zero . 4 .   finally , we look forward , in a longer perspective , to improving the results on one - loop mass shifts of self - dual nielsen - olesen vortices achieved in @xcite and @xcite in the abelian higgs model .",
    "simili modo , important improvements in the results on one - loop mass shifts of the planar self - dual topological solitons calculated in @xcite in the semi - local abelian higgs model should be expected .",
    "we warmly thank our collaborators in previous research on this topic w. garcia fuertes , m. gonzalez leon and m. de la torre mayado for illuminating conversations about different aspects of this subject ."
