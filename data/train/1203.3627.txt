    "<S> recently , the @xmath11 and @xmath12 collaborations have found some hints of a relatively light higgs boson with a mass somewhere between 120 and 130 @xmath13 [ 1 ] . </S>",

    "<S> the top quark is the heaviest elementary particle known up to today . </S>",
    "<S> its mass might has a different origin from the masses of other quarks and leptons , a top quark condensate , @xmath14 , could be responsible for at least part of @xmath15 . much theoretical </S>",
    "<S> work has been carried out in connection to the top quark and @xmath15 , some specific new physics models are proposed ( for review , see [ 2 ] and references therein ) . an interesting model involving a role for the top quark in dynamical @xmath15 </S>",

    "<S> the topcolor , a new @xmath16 interaction , that couples strongly to the third generation quarks , makes small contributions to @xmath15 and gives rise to the main part of the top quark mass . </S>",
    "<S> technicolor @xmath17 provides the bulk of @xmath15 via the vacuum expectation value @xmath18 of a technifermion bilinear . </S>",
    "<S> the light fermions can get masses from the extended technicolor @xmath19 . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath1 model is one of well - motivated new physics models and has all essential features of the topcolor scenario .    </S>",
    "<S> higgsless models [ 4 ] have emerged as a novel way of understanding the mechanism of @xmath15 without the presence of a scalar particle in the spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> recently , combing higgsless and topcolor mechanisms , a deconstructed higgsless model was proposed , called the top triangle moose @xmath0 model [ 5 , 6 ] . in this model , @xmath15 results largely from the higgsless mechanism while the top quark mass is mainly generated by the topcolor mechanism . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath20 model alleviates the tension between obtaining the correct top quark mass and keeping @xmath21 small that exists in many higgsless models , which can be seen as the deconstructed version of the @xmath1 model .    </S>",
    "<S> the new physics models belonging to the topcolor scenario genetically have two sources of @xmath15 and there are two sets of goldstone bosons . </S>",
    "<S> one set is eaten by the electroweak gauge bosons @xmath22 and @xmath23 to generate their masses , while the other set remans in the spectrum , which is called the top - pions ( @xmath24 and @xmath3 ) . </S>",

    "<S> . however , most of works are done in the context of the @xmath1 model .    </S>",
    "<S> more phenomenology analysis about the top - pions and top - higgs predicted by the @xmath20 model is needed . </S>",
    "<S> although photoproduction of the charged top - pions has been studied in ref.[7 ] , which proceeds via the subprocess @xmath27 mediated by the flavor changing couplings . </S>",
    "<S> the high energy photon beams are generated by using the compton backscatting of the initial electron and laser photon beams . </S>",

    "<S> these new particles can be produced via @xmath7 collision , which has not been detailed studied in the literature , as we know . </S>",

    "<S> the electroweak gauge structure of the @xmath20 model is @xmath33 . the nonlinear sigma field @xmath34 breaks the group @xmath35 down to @xmath36 and field @xmath37 breaks @xmath38 down to @xmath39 . </S>",
    "<S> to separate top quark mass generation from @xmath15 , a top - higgs field @xmath40 is introduced to the @xmath20 model , which couples preferentially to the top quark . to ensure that most of the @xmath15 comes from the higgsless side , the @xmath41 of the fields @xmath34 and @xmath37 are chosen to be @xmath42 , in which @xmath43 is </S>",

    "<S> conclusion and discussion *    a common feature of the new physics model belonging to the topcolor scenario is the prediction of the charged top - pions in the low energy spectrum , regardless of the dynamics responsible for @xmath15 and light quark masses . </S>",
    "<S> it is well known that , for the heavy charged scalar , which is heavier than the top quark , the subprocesses @xmath221 and @xmath222 are one kind of important production channels at the @xmath10 . at the @xmath6 , </S>",
    "<S> the charged scalars can be produced via @xmath7 collision , which has not been detailed studied in the literature , as we know . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> , we consider photoproduction of the charged top - pions predicted by the @xmath20 and @xmath1 models , which proceed via the subprocesses @xmath145 and @xmath223 at the @xmath6 .    </S>",
    "<S> our numerical results show that , in the frameworks of both the @xmath20 model and the @xmath1 model , the charged top - pions @xmath50 can be abundantly produced via @xmath7 collision , as long as they are not too heavy . in the @xmath1 model , </S>",
    "<S> the production cross section is only sensitive to the model - dependent parameter @xmath127 , while it is sensitive to the free parameters @xmath75 and @xmath127 in the @xmath20 model . for @xmath224 , the cross section of the process </S>",
