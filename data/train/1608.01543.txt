    "<S> we draw attention to the fact that a hermitian matrix is always diagonalizable and has real discrete spectrum whereas the hermitian schrdinger hamiltonian : @xmath0 , may not be so . </S>",

    "<S> textbooks do not highlight this distinction . </S>",
    "<S> however , if @xmath2 has real discrete spectrum , by virtue of the expansion theorem , one can convert the eigenvalue problem @xmath3 into a matrix and get eigenvalues @xmath4 by diagonalizing the matrix . </S>",
    "<S> we show , that the thus obtained @xmath4 could be accurate , provided @xmath2 is devoid of scattering states . </S>",
    "<S> we suggest that this could be a simple and apt way to introduce the method of linear combination of atomic orbitals ( lcao ) for finding the spectra of molecules . in textbooks , usually </S>",
    "<S> the method of matrix - diagonalization appears meagerly as a degenerate perturbation theory for more than one dimensions .    </S>",
    "<S> matrices [ 1,2 ] are beautiful mathematical entities which date back in 18 - 19th century have a special place in quantum mechanics which started in the beginning of the 20th century . </S>",
    "<S> the latter has borrowed and shared the results from the former but the textbooks do not discuss the subtle differences between the two hamiltonians [ 3 - 5 ] . </S>",
    "<S> the present article brings out two dissimilarities between the two and utilizes their similarity to make a simple and apt route to discussing the quantum mechanical method of linear combination of atomic orbitals ( lcao ) at an introductory level . in lcao </S>",
    "<S> [ 3,4 ] , one calculates the spectrum of molecules by writing their eigenstates as linear combination of atomic states .    </S>",
    "<S> consider the matrix eigenvalue equation [ 1,2 ] : ( i ) @xmath5 . if @xmath6 is hermitian or real symmetric matrix , it always has real eigenvalues and it is always diagonalizable which means that we can always find another square matrix @xmath7 such that : ( ii ) @xmath8 , where @xmath9 matrix is a diagonal matrix having @xmath10 $ ] as diagonal elements and @xmath7 is composed by collecting @xmath11 linearly independent eigenvectors @xmath12 . here @xmath13 are real eigenvalues which are the roots of the determinantal equation : ( iii ) @xmath14 . additionally the eigenvectors are orthonormal : ( iv ) @xmath15 and complete : ( v ) @xmath16 . </S>",
    "<S> all these properties are irrespective of whether eigenvalues / roots @xmath13 are repeated or not .    other types of square ( non - hermitian ) matrices ( see appendix ) may also have real eigenvalues and they are diagonalizable if they have distinct eigenvalues or in case of @xmath17 repeated roots , if one can construct @xmath17 linearly independent non - null vectors . </S>",

    "<S> since allowed energy values have to be real so here we demand @xmath27 to be real ( hermitian in a simple way ) . in text books </S>",
    "<S> it is generally proved that real potential along with dbc will have real eigenvalues . </S>",
    "<S> however , the fact that only specific profiles of @xmath27 can possess eigenvalues is ignored .    </S>",
    "<S> it is here we emphasize the use of a series of semi - classical ideas that can decide _ a priori _ whether @xmath27 will have any discrete eigenvalue . </S>",
    "<S> these semi - classical pointers are : @xmath28 needs to have a minimum . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath29 for @xmath30 to be an eigenvalue , the equation @xmath31 needs to have two real roots @xmath32 called classical turning points . </S>",
    "<S> \\{3 } next , @xmath33 @xmath34 . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath35 ( see fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1(a ) ) . finally , the action integral @xmath36 @xmath37 } dx\\ ] ] has to take one of the values @xmath38 . </S>",
    "<S> these conditions also are only necessary but not sufficient . </S>",
    "<S> despite meeting these many conditions the schrdinger equation may allow @xmath39 as an eigenvalue of @xmath27 , making @xmath30 to be only an approximate eigenvalue . </S>",
    "<S> it may be readily checked that @xmath40 can not have discrete energy bound states but @xmath41 do have them    thus , for real discrete spectrum unlike matrices for schrdinger hamiltonians , the condition of hermiticity [ 6 ] may not be sufficient . </S>",
    "<S> another difference between the two is that a matrix possesses only discrete spectrum and it does not have continuous spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> however , the schrdinger s hamiltonian can have both types of spectra : discrete and continuous .    </S>",
    "<S> red , green and blue ( rgb ) are supposed to be fundamental ( basic ) states of colors so any linear combination of them say @xmath42 creates a new color if @xmath43 and @xmath44 . </S>",
    "<S> so any color is a vector @xmath45 in the space of rgb . since every color could be codified as a vector ( information ) so it could be transmitted and consequently we have color tvs . on the other hand , a taste or a smell </S>",
    "<S> can not be transmitted as we do not know their basic states . </S>",
    "<S> every bit of music , we create or hear , it seems it is some combination of the fundamental notes of octave . in mathematics , </S>",
    "<S> any real and finite function @xmath46 defined in @xmath47 $ ] could be represented very well excepting at the end points as a linear combination of @xmath48 and @xmath49 . </S>",
    "<S> this linear combination is known as fourier series [ 1 ] : @xmath50 , \\quad n=1,2,3 ... \\ ] ] so @xmath46 will be well represented by @xmath51 , in @xmath52 , the basic states @xmath53 are orthogonal as : @xmath54 @xmath55 and @xmath56 are calculated as @xmath57 in quantum mechanics suppose a particle is in a potential well @xmath27 . </S>",
    "<S> let its bound state eigenvalues and eigenfunctions be @xmath58 and @xmath59 , respectively ; such that @xmath60 </S>",
    "<S> . now any time the state @xmath61 which is the solution of the time - dependent schrdinger equation @xmath62\\psi(x , t)=0,\\ ] ] can be written as [ 3 - 5 ] @xmath63 provided @xmath2 is time independent . </S>",
    "<S> when time dependence in not required , any state @xmath64 of the particle in @xmath27 can be written as [ 3 - 5 ] @xmath65 the eqs . </S>",
    "<S> ( 7 ) and ( 8) are known as the expansion theorem of quantum mechanics . </S>",
    "<S> somehow these two statements do not actually glorify the expansion theorem as much as it should be . </S>",
    "<S> on par with the fourier theorem , we can say that any eigenstate @xmath66 of a hamiltonian @xmath67 can be expanded as a linear combination of the complete orthogonal eigenstates @xmath59 of the hamiltonian @xmath2 where @xmath68 . </S>",
    "<S> so in the eigenvalue equation @xmath69 let us put @xmath70 to write @xmath71 multiplying both sides by @xmath59 and integrating w.r.t @xmath72 , from @xmath73 to @xmath74 , we get @xmath75 using the orthonormality condition that @xmath76 , we can write @xmath77 c_k=0,\\ ] ] where @xmath78 . now if we run @xmath11 from 1 to @xmath79 , these are @xmath79 linear simultaneous homogeneous equations in @xmath79 variables @xmath80 : @xmath81 , where @xmath82 is @xmath83 matrix and @xmath84 is a column vector </S>",
    "<S> . this equation will have non - zero and non - trivial solutions when @xmath85 , this gives the secular or characteristic equation @xmath86 according to the fundamental theorem of algebra a polynomial with real coefficients has either real or non - real complex conjugate roots . this determinantal equation ( 13 ) despite being a real polynomial equation in @xmath20 will have all @xmath79 roots as real by virtue of the fact that @xmath67 is hermitian matrix . </S>",
    "<S> these roots are nothing but approximate eigenvalues @xmath4 of ( 9 ) and these will become more and more accurate when we increase @xmath79 . </S>",
    "<S> since in this method we are considering the complete discrete energy eigenstates @xmath59 of the hamiltonian @xmath2 assuming that the hamiltonian @xmath67 does not have continuous energy ( scattering states ) spectrum so this method is expected to be accurate for the hamiltonians @xmath67 not having scattering states . </S>",
    "<S> in other cases this method would be approximate .    in textbooks , </S>",
    "<S> usually an equation identical to ( 13 ) appears in a restricted sense namely as the degenerate perturbation theory [ 3 - 5 ] for more than one dimensions . for instance , the first excited state ( @xmath87 ) of hydrogen atom is four fold - degenerate ; the quantum numbers @xmath88 have the values ( 0,0 ) , ( 1,0 ) , ( 1,1 ) and ( 1,-1 ) . in stark effect , </S>",
    "<S> when the hydrogen atom is perturbed by an external electric field @xmath89 ; a linear combination of the electronic states of hydrogen atom is taken as @xmath90 as a solution of the total hamiltonian @xmath91 . </S>",
    "<S> then the diagonalization of the @xmath92 yields four eigenvalues @xmath93 , consequently half of the four - fold degeneracy is removed [ 5 ] . in distinction to this , in this paper , we are professing the calculation of eigenvalues of a one - dimensional hamiltonian by the matrix- diagonalizaton . </S>",
    "<S> though , at research levels , this is practiced commonly but in textbooks it is presented meagerly only as a degenerate perturbation theory .    </S>",
    "<S> fortunately , in one - dimensional quantum mechanics , we have two complementary systems having complete set of bound eigenstates , these are a particle between two rigid walls at @xmath94 ( finite support , infinitely deep well ( idw ) ) and the other one is of infinite support called harmonic oscillator ( ho ) . in following discussions and calculations </S>",
    "<S> we work with units where we set @xmath95 . for the idw , </S>",
    "<S> the normalized basic states are [ 3 - 5 ] @xmath96 for ho : @xmath97 ( @xmath98 ) , the normalized basic states are [ 3 - 5 ] @xmath99 in this paper , we consider two hamiltonians @xmath100 and @xmath101 , where @xmath21 ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1(b ) ) and @xmath102 is the same dirac delta potential well between two rigid walls ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1(c ) ) . </S>",
    "<S> it is known that @xmath67 has one discrete eigenvalue ( @xmath103 ) bound state along with positive energy continuum of scattering states [ 3 ] . </S>",
    "<S> but @xmath104 has only discrete energy spectrum of infinitely many bound states [ 7 ] . </S>",
    "<S> the energy eigenvalues of @xmath105 are given [ 6 ] by @xmath106 ( even parity states ) , @xmath107 ( odd parity states ) . when @xmath108 , @xmath109 is an eigenstate . </S>",
    "<S> when @xmath110 the negative energy bound state is found by solving @xmath111 . here </S>",
    "<S> @xmath112 and @xmath113    in the idw basis we have @xmath114 where @xmath115 , if both @xmath17 and @xmath11 are odd integers , otherwise it is 0 . </S>",
    "<S> so the matrix element @xmath116 for the hamiltonian of dirac delta potential between two rigid walls ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1(c ) ) in idw basis can be written as @xmath117 for ho basis by using the creation and annihilation operators [ 3 - 5 ] , we can write @xmath118,\\ ] ] and @xmath119 where utilizing the available [ 8 ] nonvanishing values of even ordered hermite polynomials @xmath120 , we obtain @xmath121~\\gamma[(1-n)/2 ] } , \\quad \\mbox{if both}~ m ~\\mbox{and}~ n ~ \\mbox{are even } \\\\ </S>",
    "<S> \\nonumber & = & 0 , \\quad\\mbox{otherwise}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] so the matrix elements for the dirac delta well ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1(b ) ) can be written as @xmath122 in order to find the discrete spectrum of @xmath104 we diagonalize the matrix @xmath123 by taking @xmath79 as 10 , 50 , 100 , 500 and 1000 and follow first four eigenvalues for four values of @xmath124 . </S>",
    "<S> for all the cases we fix @xmath125 . </S>",
    "<S> see in the table that @xmath126 and @xmath127 show fast convergence as @xmath79 increases from 10 to 1000 . for </S>",
    "<S> @xmath128 or much less values these eigenvalues match with the exactly calculated eigenvalues accurately upto two decimal places . </S>",
    "<S> this means that for a better accuracy @xmath79 needs to be increased further . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , for all the values of @xmath124 , @xmath129 and @xmath130 coincide with exact values @xmath131 and @xmath132 which are independent of @xmath124 as the eigenvalues come from the condition @xmath107 .    </S>",
    "<S> contrary to this , for @xmath67 the diagonalization of @xmath133 displays slow convergence of its only eigenvalue @xmath134 as @xmath79 is increased from 10 to 1000 up to even two decimal places and increasing @xmath79 further does not change @xmath126 significantly . eventually , the exact value of @xmath103 is not obtainable . </S>",
    "<S> this we attribute to the presence of scattering states over the attractive dirac delta potential for the continuum of positive energies . </S>",
    "<S> this is the characteristic feature of the matrix as they are insensitive to the scattering states . </S>",
    "<S> it is instructive to remark that exact value of @xmath135 has been obtained when a delta potential @xmath136 was perturbed by a delta barrier @xmath137 using the contribution of scattering states [ 9 ] in the second order perturbation theory .    </S>",
    "<S> the diagonalization of a @xmath83 matrix gives @xmath79 eigenvalues even if the potential has just one or a finite number of discrete eigenvalues . in these cases we have to consider the lowest eigenvalues as the correct ones . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , for @xmath67 , only the first eigenvalue turns out to be negative for any value of @xmath79 . </S>",
    "<S> even if a schrdinger hamiltonian does not possess discrete spectrum but diagonalization of its corresponding matrix will yield @xmath79 eigenvalues . </S>",
    "<S> now the question as to how to discard these ( so called ) eigenvalues is intriguing . </S>",
    "<S> we find that either every eigenvalue does not show the convergence as we increase @xmath79 or all the eigenvalues converge to zero when @xmath79 is made very large .    </S>",
    "<S> yet another point to ponder is that in a hermitian matrix the eigenvalues may repeat ( degeneracy ) or not . </S>",
    "<S> however , for the hermitian schrdinger hamiltonian the degeneracy is essentially absent in one - dimension , it may occur in two or three dimensions . </S>",
    "<S> this is why , whenever we obtain the eigenvalues of a one dimensional hamiltonian by the method of matrix diagonalization eigenvalues do not repeat . for higher dimensions , in textbooks the method of diagonalization </S>",
    "<S> is presented meagerly only as a degenerate perturbation theory . in this regard , </S>",
    "<S> the example of stark effect [ 3 - 5 ] of hydrogen atom is outlined above where @xmath109 repeats twice .    to summarize , in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we have shown that for real discrete eigenvalues the condition of hermiticity is sufficient only for a matrix hamiltonian but it may not be so for a schrdinger hamiltonian . </S>",
    "<S> we have pointed out that matrices unlike schrdinger hamiltonians do not possess continuous spectra . </S>",
    "<S> based on the expansion theorem we have shown that if a schrdinger hamiltonian possess discrete spectrum of bound states , it can be converted to a matrix of order @xmath83 whose diagonalization for a sufficiently large dimension ( @xmath79 ) can yield the discrete spectrum accurately , provided the schrdinger hamiltonian does not entail scattering states . </S>",
    "<S> otherwise this method would be approximate . </S>",
    "<S> we find that this is the primary route to introduce the method of linear combination of atomic orbital ( lcao ) . </S>"
