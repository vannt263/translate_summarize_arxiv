    "graphene has an unusual band structure created by the interaction of electrons on the two sublattices , labeled a and b in ( figure  [ fig : theory]a ) : the conduction and valence bands are conical , and they meet at a point in @xmath3-space , the dirac point , like the band structure for a massless relativistic particle .",
    "the ability to tune the charge density in graphene from positive values for electrons through zero to negative densities for holes , with no energy gap , means that the fermi wavelength can be comparable to the mean free path , and the charge density can be broken up into puddles of electrons and holes by disorder .",
    "coherent electron waves traveling through disordered conductors show weak localization  @xcite and universal conduction fluctuations ( ucf )  @xcite ; both effects are created by the interference of electron waves .",
    "weak localization results from the coherent backscattering of waves from a disordered potential ( figure  [ fig : theory]c ) , while ucf are created by the interference of waves traveling along all possible paths ( figure  [ fig : theory]d ) .",
    "the set of paths that interfere is bounded by the diffusive coherent length @xmath4 .",

    "[ fig : theory ] ]    in this work , we use a liquid - he - cooled scanning probe microscope to probe weak localization in graphene by mapping the effect of a single spm - tip - created scatterer on coherent electron transport . while much can be learned from bulk transport measurements , a nanoscale probe that perturbs the system on the same size scale as the disorder potential and the electron wavelength provides important new information  @xcite . by scanning the location of the scatterer created by the spm tip , we spatially map the change @xmath6 in conductance @xmath7 caused by the tip , producing a conductance image @xmath8 that represents a `` fingerprint '' of the intrinsic disorder , at a particular density @xmath9 and magnetic field @xmath10 .",
    "the magnitude of the conductance fluctuations is @xmath11 , their lateral size is @xmath12s of nm , comparable to the fermi wavelength , and the images repeat , as found for ucf conductance images of graphene in zero applied magnetic field  @xcite .",

    "weak localization is observed as a dip in the magnetoconductance @xmath7 at @xmath0 , with a characteristic width @xmath1 .",
    "we study weak localization by averaging over either a range of back gate voltages @xmath15 to vary the charge density , or over a set of different tip positions at a fixed @xmath15 .",

    "graphene has an unusual bandstructure .",
    "a graphene sheet is composed of a single layer of carbon atoms in a hexagonal lattice , with two atoms in each unit cell forming sublattices labeled a and b in figure  [ fig : theory]a .",
    "the band structure has two valleys : each valley has a conduction and a valence band that meet at a single point in the brillouin zone , known as the dirac point , with no energy gap ( figure  [ fig : theory]b ) .",
    "the electron and hole energies increase linearly with momentum @xmath16 near their meeting point , and they are nominally isotropic , yielding pairs of conical bands that are symmetric about the dirac point . because of the two atoms in each unit cell , there is an additional degeneracy in the electronic states of graphene known as chirality , with the eigenstates of opposite chirality arising from the two equivalent sublattices .",
    "scattering between the two valleys in graphene and the effects of chirality must be considered in understanding weak localization in graphene , as discussed below .",
    "the phenomenon of weak localization can be understood by considering interference between time - reversed paths of backscattered electrons in a disordered material  @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : theory]c illustrates a pair of time - reversed paths that contribute to backscattering : both paths have an incoming wavevector @xmath17 , and an outgoing wavevector @xmath18 .",
    "the only difference between them is that one traverses the loop in a clockwise direction , and the other traverses the loop in a counterclockwise direction .",
    "as an electron travels along each path , it accumulates phase according to the dirac equation in the case of graphene , or the schrdinger equation in more conventional materials .",
    "this phase is controlled by the integral of the electron momentum and the magnetic potential along the path , as well as the geometric phase acquired in graphene . in conventional materials such as metals and semiconductors with no spin - orbit coupling , the geometric phase difference between these paths around a closed loop is zero , yielding constructive interference at @xmath0 that enhances backscattering , causing a net reduction of the conductance ( hence , weak localization ) . in graphene , the accumulation of geometric phase depends on whether elastic scattering breaks the chiral symmetry of the electron state or scatters electrons between valleys ; these processes lead to both constructive and destructive contributions to the interference , as discussed below .",
    "an applied magnetic field acts to destroy weak localization by altering the phase of electrons traveling in opposite directions along time - reversed paths . in a perpendicular magnetic field @xmath10",
    ", a phase shift @xmath19 is picked up in both paths in figure  [ fig : theory]c given by the magnetic flux penetrating the effective area @xmath20 enclosed by the diffusive loop , where @xmath21 is the magnetic flux quantum - the sign depends on the direction of propagation around the loop . as the magnetic field",
    "is increased , the interference present at @xmath0 is destroyed , allowing one to observe weak localization experimentally as a dip in magnetoconductance at @xmath0 , with width @xmath1 determined by the average effective area @xmath20 enclosed by pairs of backscattered paths .    in the discussion above , we have assumed that the transport is entirely coherent , whereas realistically , inelastic scattering also occurs that randomizes the phase of an electron wave .",
    "if inelastic scattering occurs at a rate @xmath22 and we assume an elastic scattering rate @xmath23 , then we can define a diffusive coherence length @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the electron diffusion constant ; @xmath2 is the average distance over which an electron remains coherent .",
    "the coherence length @xmath2 sets an upper limit to the size of diffusive loops that give rise to weak localization ( see figures  [ fig : theory]c and [ fig : theory]d ) , resulting in a characteristic magnetic field @xmath26 required to destroy weak localization , by producing a @xmath27 phase shift between time - reversed paths in an area @xmath28 .",

    "has been observed in epitaxially - grown graphene samples  @xcite . in exfoliated graphene samples ,",
    "however , such as the ones considered here , the negative weak localization correction is typically dominant at low temperatures  @xcite , implying the existence of a significant source of chirality - breaking scattering , possibly from lattice defects in the graphene .",
    "we observe a negative weak localization conductivity correction in all samples studied , and obtain qualitatively good fits to equation  [ eq : wlgraphene ] with fit parameters similar to those in ref .",

    ", we will use equation  [ eq : wlwidth ] to estimate @xmath2 from measurements of @xmath1 below .",
    "in addition to weak localization , the interference of electron waves traveling along different paths creates universal conductance fluctuations ( ucf ) with standard deviation @xmath43 independent of sample size or the degree of disorder  @xcite .",
    "this coherent correction to the conductivity depends sensitively on the positions of the scatterers .",
    "we have recently shown  @xcite that moving a single scatterer created by an spm tip by a distance comparable to the electron wavelength is sufficient to cause the full range of conductance fluctuations in zero magnetic field , in agreement with theoretical predictions  @xcite .    for ucf at finite b , the change @xmath14 in magnetic field needed to reduce the correlation of the conductance by a factor of two is  @xcite @xmath44 note that @xmath45 because weak localization arises from the phase difference accumulated along two counter - propagating paths around a diffusive loop , whereas ucf comes from a single loop .",
