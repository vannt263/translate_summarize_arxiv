    "recent years have witnessed a booming development in two - dimensional materials since the experimental discovery of graphene  @xcite . besides graphene , such two - dimensional materials as monolayer phosphorus and monolayer transition - metal dichalcogenides ( tmdc ) exhibit many novel physical properties which do not exist in their bulk counterparts .",
    "the two - dimensional materials are promising for applications in many fields , such as field - effect transistors  @xcite , phototransistors  @xcite , p - n junctions  @xcite , supercapacitors  @xcite , and batteries  @xcite .",
    "the experimental realization of two - dimensional mon@xmath2 material  @xcite means that the two - dimensional material field has been extended to the transition - metal dinitrides ( tmdn ) . very interestingly",

    "it is found that the ferromagnetism in the 2d mon@xmath2 will change into antiferromagnetism when appropriate biaxial strain is applied  @xcite .",
    "the mon@xmath2 is also proved to be an appealing two - dimensional electrode material with high storage capacity  @xcite . on the other hand , the three - dimensional materials of rhenium dinitride ren@xmath0 have been synthesized by metathesis reaction under high pressure  @xcite , and x - ray diffraction(xrd ) shows the samples have the same structure as the three - dimensional mos@xmath0-like honeycomb structure .",
    "a first - principles calculation of the stiffness constants indicates that this structure is not mechanically stable and a monoclinic structure was suggested instead  @xcite , but a more systematical first - principles investigation shows that the three - dimensional mon@xmath2-like structure is dynamically stable for ren@xmath0 and there is a three - dimensional tetragonal structure with lower total energy  @xcite .",
    "in addition , experiment indicates that the three - dimensional ren@xmath2 may be layered in terms of its compressibility  @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , there has been no exploration for two - dimensional materials of ren@xmath2 monolayers .    here ,",
    "through first - principles calculation we study the two - dimensional crystal structures of ren@xmath2 and their electronic , mechanical , magnetic , and optical properties for two - dimensional ren@xmath2 materials .",
    "we obtain two stable two - dimensional structures , namely honeycomb - like and tetragonal monolayers , whose stability is confirmed by calculated phonon spectra and in - plane stiffness constants .",
    "the energy bands , density of states ( dos ) , magnetic ordering , orbital occupations , and effect of the spin - orbit coupling are investigated .",
    "both of them are metallic , and the 2d hexagonal phase has ferromagnetism based on nitrogen . the strain - dependent magnetic properties and the optical properties of the two - dimensional materials are also studied to explore possible applications .",
    "more detailed results will be presented in the following .",
    "the first - principles calculations are done with the projector - augmented wave ( paw ) potential method  @xcite as implemented in the vienna ab initio simulation package software ( vasp )  @xcite .",
    "for all of our spin - polarized and spin - unpolarized computational cases , we take the generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) , accomplished by perdew , burke , and ernzerhof ( pbe )  @xcite , for the exchange - correlation functional .",

    "all atomic positions are fully optimized with the conjugate gradient optimization until all the hellmann - feynman forces on each atom are less than 0.001 ev /  and the total energy difference between two successive steps is smaller than 10@xmath5 ev . furthermore",
    ", phonon dispersion calculation in terms of the density functional perturbation theory , by using the phonopy program  @xcite , is performed to ensure the structural stability of the monolayers .",
    "we take the 4@xmath34@xmath31 supercell for calculating the phonon spectra of the 2d structures . in order to make further confirmation , band dispersion calculations with heyd - scuseria - ernzerhof ( hse ) hybrid functional  @xcite",
    "are carried out , with the mixing rate of the hf exchange potential being 0.25 .",

    "we realize two - dimensional ren@xmath0 materials through the 2d honeycomb and tetragonal structures of ren@xmath0 monolayer .",
    "other 2d crystal structures have been considered , but are rejected due to lacking structural stability . the 2d honeycomb ( p6@xmath6/mmc ) and tetragonal ( p@xmath7m2 , # 115 ) structures are both made up with three atom planes as shown in fig .  [ fig1 ] .",

    "[ fig3 ] has already revealed that the largest spin exchange splitting occurs in the n-@xmath32 dominated energy bands .",
    "the total energy difference between the antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic configurations of the honeycomb structure is equivalent to 59 mev , which indicates that the spin exchange interaction is quite strong .",
    "very interestingly , the ferromagnetic honeycomb structure will change when we apply a biaxial stress on it , and it will transit to an antiferromagnetic spin configuration at the critical point .",
    "in contrast , there is no phase transition under biaxial strain for the 2d tetragonal structure .",
    "when the biaxial strain is increasing , the distance between two nitrogen layers , @xmath9 , decreases slowly until the critical point .",
    "when the strain reaches to 14@xmath1 , the dive of the distance @xmath9 reveals the occurrence of the structural phase transition .",
    "our calculation reveals that under this strain , the antiferromagnetic configuration has the lower energy than the ferromagnetic one and the elf plot shows that the direct bond between the top and bottom nitrogen atoms occurs .",
    "there is no such phenomena for the tetragonal structure under biaxial strain .",
    "we have obtained the relation between stress and strain for the two 2d structures under biaxial strain by using the relation , @xmath41 , where @xmath42 is the biaxial strain , @xmath43 the volume of the unit cell , and @xmath44 the total energy of the system .",

    "it is clear that there is a large difference between the in - plane and out - of - plane curves in each of the optical functions .",
    "these reflect the two - dimensional features in the electronic structures for the 2d phases .    in the visible light region ( @xmath55ev ) , the absorption coefficient of the honeycomb structure is almost zero for @xmath56ev , while the tetragonal structure s absorption coefficient ranges from 8@xmath57@xmath58 to 46 @xmath57@xmath58 , which shows quite good absorption for photovoltaic applications .",
    "the energy loss spectrum reveals the collective excitations , and the existence of many peaks for the honeycomb structure indicates the existence of plasmon resonances .",

    "their structural stability has been established by their dft phonon spectra and mechanical properties .",
    "the 2d hexagonal phase exhibits ferromagnetism that is robust ( with a magnetic energy of 59 mev ) against magnetic fluctuations , and can undergo a phase transition under biaxial strain .",
    "the stress - driven transition also changes the ferromagnetism to antiferromagnetism .",
    "there is an easy magnetic plane in the honeycomb monolayer plane , which implies that the magnetism is like the well - known 2d heisenberg xy spin model which can host interesting topological spin structures .",
    "the tetragonal phase is 0.33 ev ( per formula unit ) lower than the hexagonal phase , but the hexagonal phase has much larger bulk , shear , and young s muduli than the tetragonal phase . for the tetragonal phase , the n p bands are fully filled and therefore the electronic states near the fermi level originate from re d orbitals only .",
    "consequently , the tetragonal phase is a three - bands typical metal , and the hexagonal phase is a ferromagnetic semi - metal .",
