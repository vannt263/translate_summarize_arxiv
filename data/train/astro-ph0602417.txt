    "at least 10% of all neutron stars are born as magnetars , with magnetic fields @xmath6  g. their activity is powered by the decay of the ultrastrong field and lasts about @xmath7  years .",
    "they are observed at this active stage as either soft gamma repeaters ( sgrs ) or anomalous x - ray pulsars ( axps ) ( see woods & thompson 2006 for a recent review ) .",
    "twelve active magnetars are currently known , and all of them have similar parameters : spin period @xmath8  s , persistent x - ray luminosity @xmath9  erg / s , and surface temperature @xmath10  kev .",
    "the large - scale ( dipole ) component of the magnetic field @xmath11  g has been inferred from the measurement of rapid spindown in several axps , and more recently in two sgrs ( kouveliotou et al .",
    "1998 , 1999 ) .",
    "however , there is evidence for even stronger magnetic field inside the star , as was originally deduced from considerations of magnetic field transport ( thompson & duncan 1996 ) . in particular , the occurence of enormously energetic x - ray flares in sgrs points to internal magnetic fields approaching @xmath12  g ( hurley et al . 2005 ) . bursting",
    "activity has also been detected in two axps ( kaspi et al .",
    "2003 ) , which strongly supports the hypothesis that active rearrangement of the magnetic field takes place in axps as well as sgrs , although at differing rates .",
    "besides the sporadic x - ray outbursts , a second , persistent , form of activity has been discovered by studying the emission spectra of magnetars . until recently",
    ", the spectrum was known to have a thermal component with temperature @xmath13  kev , interpreted as blackbody emission from the star s surface .",
    "the soft x - ray spectrum also showed a tail at @xmath14  kev with photon index @xmath15 .",
    "intriguingly , the hardness of the @xmath14 kev spectrum correlates with long - term activity as a transient burst source ( marsden & white 2001 ) .",
    "this deviation from pure surface emission already suggested that energy is partially released above the star s surface .",
    "recently , observations by rxte and integral have revealed even more intriguing feature : magnetars are bright , persistent sources of 100 kev x - rays ( kuiper et al . 2004 ; molkov et al . 2005 ;",
    "mereghetti et al . 2005 ; den hartog et al .",
    "2006 ; kuiper et al . 2006 ) .",
    "this high - energy emission forms a separate component of the magnetar spectrum , distinct from the soft x - ray component that was known before .",
    "the new component becomes dominant above 10  kev , has a very hard spectrum , @xmath16 , and peaks above 100  kev where the spectrum is unknown .",
    "the luminosity in this band , @xmath17  erg  s@xmath18 , even exceeds the thermal luminosity from the star s surface .",
    "these hard x - rays can be emitted only in the exterior of the star and demonstrate the presence of an active plasma corona .",
    "our goal in this paper is to understand the origin and composition of the magnetar corona .",
    "the starting point of our analysis is the fact that an evolving magnetar experiences strong deformations of its crust , due to a shifting configuration of the internal magnetic field .",
    "these `` starquakes '' shear the magnetic field that is anchored in the crust , thereby injecting an electric current into the stellar magnetosphere .",
    "this process bears some resemblence to the formation of current - carrying structures in the solar corona , although there are important differences which shall be discussed below .",
    "we investigate how the starquakes and twisting of the magnetosphere can lead to the formation of a plasma corona around a magnetar .",
    "the persistence of magnetospheric twists can explain several observed properties of the axps and sgrs ( thompson , lyutikov , & kulkarni 2002 ; hereafter tlk ) .",
    "tlk investigated the observational consequences using a static , force - free model , idealizing the magnetosphere as a globally twisted dipole .",
    "they showed that a twist affects the spindown rate of the neutron star : it causes the magnetosphere to flare out slightly from a pure dipole configuration , thereby increasing the braking torque acting on the star .",
    "the force - free configuration is independent of the plasma behavior in the magnetosphere .",
    "it does rely , however , on the presence of plasma that can conduct the required current @xmath19 .",
    "this requires a minimum density @xmath20 .",
    "tlk showed that even this minimum density significantly modifies the stellar radiation by multiple resonant scattering , which can explain the tail of the surface emission at @xmath14  kev .    in this paper",
    ", we formulate the problem of plasma dynamics in the closed twisted magnetosphere and find a simple solution to this problem , which allows one to understand the observed energy output of the magnetar corona and the evolution of magnetic twists .",
    "plasma behavior around neutron stars has been studied for decades in the context of radio pulsars , and that problem remains unsolved .",
    "the principle difference with radio pulsars is that their activity is caused by _",
    "rotation _ , and dissipation occurs on _ open magnetic lines _ that connect the star to its light cylinder .",
    "electron - positron pairs are then created on open field lines ( e.g. ruderman & sutherland 1975 ; arons & scharlemann 1979 ; harding & muslimov 2002 ) . by contrast , the formation of a corona around a magnetar does not depend on rotation of the neutron star .",
    "all observed magnetars are slow rotators ( @xmath21  hz ) , and their rotational energy can not feed the observed coronal emission .",
    "( the bolometric output of some magnetars is @xmath22 times larger than the spindown luminosity , as deduced from the rotational period derivative ! ) the open field lines form a tiny fraction @xmath23 of the magnetic flux threading the neutron star .",
    "practically the entire plasma corona is immersed in the _ closed _ magnetosphere and its heating must be caused by some form of dissipation on the closed field lines .",
    "in contrast with canonical radio pulsars , the magnetar corona admits a simple solution .",
    "plasma near a neutron star is strongly constrained compared with many other forms of plasma encountered in laboratory and space , and therefore easier to model .",
    "the relative simplicity is due to the fact that the magnetic field is strong and fixed  its evolution timescale is much longer than the residence time of particles in the corona .",
    "furthermore , particles are at the lowest landau level and move strictly along the magnetic field lines , which makes the problem effectively one - dimensional .",
    "finally , the magnetic lines under consideration are closed , with both ends anchored in the highly conducting stellar material .",
    "the basic questions that one would like to answer are as follows .",
    "how is the magnetosphere populated with plasma ?",
    "the neutron star surface has a temperature @xmath24  kev and the scale - height of its atmospheric layer ( if it exists ) is only a few cm .",
    "how is the plasma supplied above this layer and what type of particles populate the corona ? how is the corona heated , and what are the typical energies of the particles ?",
    "if the corona conducts a current associated with a magnetic twist @xmath25 , how rapid is the dissipation of this current , i.e. what is the lifetime of the twist",
    "? does its decay imply the disappearance of the corona ?",
    "an outline of the model proposed in this paper is as follows .",
    "the key agent in corona formation is an electric field @xmath26 parallel to the magnetic field .",
    "@xmath26 is generated by the self - induction of the gradually decaying current and in essence measures the rate of the decay .",
    "it determines the heating rate of the corona via joule dissipation . if @xmath27 then the corona is not heated and , being in contact with the cool stellar surface , it will have to condense to a thin surface layer with @xmath24  kev .",
    "the current - carrying particles can not flow upward against gravity unless a force @xmath28 drives it . on the other hand ,",
    "when @xmath26 exceeds a critical value , @xmath4 avalanches are triggered in the magnetosphere , and the created pairs screen the electric field .",
    "this leads to a `` bottleneck '' for the decay of a magnetic twist , which implies a slow decay .",
    "the maintenance of the corona and the slow decay of the magnetic twist are intimately related because both are governed by @xmath26 . in order to find @xmath26",
    ", one can use gauss law @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the net charge density of the coronal plasma .",
    "this constraint implies that @xmath31 and @xmath30 must be found self - consistently .",
    "we formulate the problem of plasma dynamics in a twisted magnetic field and the self - consistent electric field , and investigate its basic properties .",
    "the problem turns out to be similar to the classical double - layer problem of plasma physics ( langmuir 1929 ) with a new essential ingredient : @xmath4 pair creation .",
    "we design a numerical experiment that simulates the behavior of the 1-d plasma in the magnetosphere .",
    "the experiment shows how the plasma and electric field self - organize to maintain the time - average magnetospheric current @xmath32 demanded by the magnetic field , @xmath33 .",
    "the electric current admits no steady state on short timescales and keeps fluctuating , producing @xmath4 avalanches .",
    "this state may be described as a self - organized criticality .",
    "pair creation is found to provide a robust mechanism for limiting the voltage along the magnetic lines to @xmath34  gev and regulate the observed luminosity of the corona .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "we start with a qualitative description of the mechanism of corona formation , and show that it can be thought of as an electric - circuit problem (   2 ) .",
    "a careful formulation of the circuit problem and the set up of numerical experiment are described in   3 . in ",
    "4 we find that the circuit without @xmath4 creation does not provide a self - consistent model .",
    "pair creation is found to be inevitable and described in detail in   5 . in   6",
    "we discuss the transition layer between the corona and the relatively cold surface of the star .",
    "the maintenance of a dense plasma layer on the surface is addressed in   7 .",
    "observational implications and further developments of the model are discussed in   8 .",
    "a tightly wound - up magnetic field is assumed to exist inside magnetars ( e.g. thompson & duncan 2001 )",
    ". the internal toroidal field can be much stronger than the external large - scale dipole component .",
    "the essence of magnetar activity is the transfer of magnetic helicity from the interior of the star to its exterior , where it dissipates .",
    "this involves rotational motions of the crust , which inevitably twist the external magnetosphere that is anchored to the stellar surface .",
    "the magnetosphere is probably twisted in a catastrophic way , when the internal magnetic field breaks the crust and rotates it .",
    "such starquakes are associated with observed x - ray bursts ( thompson & duncan 1995 ) . the most interesting effect of a starquake for us here is the partial release of the winding of the internal magnetic field into the exterior , i.e. , the injection of magnetic helicity into the magnetosphere .",
    "since the magnetic field is energetically dominant in the magnetosphere , it must relax there to a force - free configuration with @xmath35 .",
    "the effective footpoints of the force - free field lines sit in the inner crust of the star . at this depth currents",
    "may flow across the magnetic lines because the deep crust can sustain a significant ampre force @xmath36 : this force is balanced by elastic forces of the deformed crust .",
    "the ability of the crust to sustain @xmath37 quickly decreases toward the surface , and it is nearly force - free where , where quantity @xmath38 is measured in c.g.s . units . ]",
    "@xmath39  g/@xmath40 ( thompson & duncan 2001 ) .",
    "the build - up of stresses in the crust from an initial magnetostatic equilibrium has been studied recently by braithwaite & spruit ( 2006 ) .",
    "the ejection of helicity may be thought of as directing an interior current ( which previously flowed across the field and applied a @xmath41 force ) into the force - free magnetosphere .",
    "the ejected current flows along the magnetic lines to the exterior of the star , reaches the top of the line and comes back to the star at the other footpoint .",
    "the currents emerging during the starquake may percolate through a network of fractures in the crust",
    ". then large gradients in the field are initially present which can be quickly erased .",
    "a relatively smooth magnetospheric twist of scale @xmath42 will have the longest lifetime .",
    "globally twisted magnetic fields are observed to persist in the solar corona over many alfvn crossing times .",
    "twisted magnetic configurations have also been studied in laboratory experiments . in particular , the toroidal pinch configuration has been studied in detail and is well explained as a relaxed plasma state in which the imparted magnetic helicity has been nearly conserved ( taylor 1986 ) .",
    "the toroidal pinch relaxes to the minimum - energy state which has a uniform helicity density : @xmath43 with @xmath44 .",
    "this state is achieved because the experiment has toroidal geometry and the current is isolated from an external conductor .",
    "the relaxation process is then free to redistribute the current between neighboring magnetic flux tubes via small - scale reconnection , which leads to a uniform @xmath45 .",
    "the geometry is different in the case of a magnetar ( or the sun )  the field lines are anchored to the star and their configuration depends on the footpoint motion ( for related calculations of the relaxed state of a driven plasma see , e.g. , tang & boozer [ 2005 ] ) .",
    "the long lifetime ( @xmath46  year ) of a twisted configuration around magnetars is supported by observations of long - lived changes in the spindown rate and x - ray pulse profiles ( woods & thompson 2006 ; tlk ) as well as persistent nonthermal x - ray emission .",
    "the shape of a twisted force - free magnetosphere may be calculated given the boundary conditions at the footpoints .",
    "an illustrative model of a globally twisted dipole field was considered by tlk .",
    "it has one parameter  twist angle @xmath47  and allows one to see the qualitative effects of increasing twist on the magnetic configuration .",
    "the current density in this configuration is [ eq : j ] ( r , ) = c4 * * ^2 ( r > ) , where @xmath48 are spherical coordinates with the polar axis chosen along the axis of the dipole . even for strong twists , @xmath49 ,",
    "the poloidal components @xmath50 and @xmath51 are found to be close to the normal dipole configuration , although the magnetosphere is somewhat inflated .",
    "the main difference is the appearance of a toroidal field @xmath52 .",
    "the global structure of a real twisted magnetosphere may be complex .",
    "the displacement @xmath53 of the magnetosphere s footpoints during a starquake may be described as a 2d incompressible motion with @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "suppose that the yielding behavior of the crust produces a motion @xmath56 that is localized within a plate @xmath57 , and this plate is connected by magnetospheric field lines to another plate on the opposite side of the star .",
    "then @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the boundary of @xmath57 .",
    "hence @xmath60 must change sign within @xmath57 .",
    "for example , for an axially symmetric rotational motion , the ejection of current in the center of the plate is accompanied by initiation of an opposite current on its periphery that screens the ejected current from the unmoved footpoints with @xmath61 .    in this paper , we study the plasma dynamics in a flux tube @xmath62 with a given twist current @xmath63",
    ". the magnetosphere may be thought of as a collection of such elementary flux tubes , whose currents @xmath64 vary from footpoint to footpoint .",
    "the variation of @xmath65 is expected to be gradual , so that the characteristic thickness of a flux tube with a given @xmath65 is comparable to @xmath66 .",
    "the emerging currents are easily maintained during the x - ray outburst accompanying a starquake .",
    "a dense , thermalized plasma is then present in the magnetosphere , which easily conducts the current .",
    "plasma remains suspended for some time after the starquake because of the transient thermal afterglow with a high blackbody temperature , up to @xmath67  kev .",
    "the cyclotron resonance of the ions is at the energy @xmath68  kev and , during the afterglow , the radiative flux at the resonance is high enough to lift ions from the surface against gravity ( ibrahim et al . 2001 ) .    eventually the afterglow extinguishes and the radiative flux becomes unable to support the plasma outside the star .",
    "the decreasing density then threats the capability of the magnetosphere to conduct the current of the magnetic twist . a minimal `` corotation '' charge density @xmath69",
    "is always maintained because of rotation of the star with frequency @xmath70 ( goldreich & julian 1969 ) , but it is far smaller than the minimal density that is needed to supply the current @xmath71 ( eq .  [ eq : j ] ) : [ rhoco ] |_co|||/c ~1 ( r_maxc)1 .",
    "here @xmath72 is the maximum radius of a dipolar field line that passes through coordinates @xmath73 .",
    "the current , however , will be forced to continue to flow by its self - induction , and the magnetosphere finds a way to re - generate the plasma that can carry the current ( see   2.2 ) .",
    "so , the twisted force - free configuration persists .    the stored energy of non - potential ( toroidal ) magnetic field associated with the ejected current is subject to gradual dissipation . in our model",
    ", this dissipation feeds the observed activity of the corona .",
    "the stored energy is concentrated near the star and carried by closed magnetic lines with a maximum extension radius @xmath74 .",
    "thus , most of the twist energy will be released if these lines untwist , and we focus in this paper on the near magnetosphere @xmath74 .",
    "consider a magnetic flux tube of polar angle @xmath75 and has a cross section @xmath76 . ] with cross section @xmath77 and length @xmath78 which carries a current @xmath79 .",
    "the stored magnetic energy of the current per unit length of the tube is ~ s. the decay of this energy is associated with an electric field parallel to the magnetic lines @xmath80 : this field can accelerate particles and convert the magnetic energy into plasma energy .",
    "conservation of energy can be expressed as ( ) = - -(c ) , as follows from maxwell s equations with @xmath81 ( e.g. landau & lifshitz 1975 ) .",
    "the first term on the right - hand side is the joule dissipation caused by @xmath80 .",
    "the second term  the divergence of the poynting flux  describes the redistribution of magnetic energy in space .",
    "[ fig1 ]    the decay of the twist is related to the voltage between the footpoints of a magnetic line , [ eq : phi_e ] _",
    "e=_a^c e. here a and c are the anode and cathode footpoints and @xmath82 is the line element ; the integral is taken along the magnetic line outside the star ( fig .",
    "the product @xmath83 approximately represents the dissipation rate @xmath84 in the tube .",
    "( the two quantities are not exactly equal in a time - dependent circuit . )",
    "the instantaneous dissipation rate is given by = _",
    "a^c e(l ) , where @xmath85 is the instantaneous current at position @xmath86 in the tube .",
    "the current is fixed at the footpoints a and c , @xmath87 ; it may , however , fluctuate between the footpoints .",
    "note that the true scalar potential @xmath88 is different from @xmath89 and not related to the dissipation rate .",
    "@xmath88 is the 0-component of the 4-potential @xmath90 which is related to the electric field by = -- .",
    "if anode and cathode are connected by an ideal conductor then @xmath91 while the voltage @xmath89 may not vanish .",
    "the voltage @xmath89 is entirely maintained by the self - induction that accompanies the gradual untwisting of the magnetic field .",
    "thus , @xmath89 reflects the gradual decrease of the magnetic helicity in the tube , = t_a^c * a * v = -_a^c * eb * s(l ) l. ( here @xmath92 is the volume element . )",
    "it also determines the effective resistivity of the tube : @xmath93 .",
    "the self - induction voltage passes the released magnetic energy to charged particles , and a higher rate of untwisting implies a higher energy @xmath94 gained per particle .",
    "a huge magnetic energy is stored in the twisted tube , and a quick untwisting would lead to extremely high lorentz factors of the accelerated particles",
    ".    there is , however , a bottleneck that prevents a fast decay of the twist : the tube responds to high voltages through the copious production of @xmath4 pairs .",
    "runaway pair creation is ignited when electrons are accelerated to a certain lorentz factor @xmath95 .",
    "( we describe the microphysics of pair creation in   5 . )",
    "the created @xmath4 plasma does not tolerate large @xmath26  the plasma is immediately polarized , screening the electric field .",
    "this provides a negative feedback that limits the magnitude of @xmath89 and buffers the decay of the twist .",
    "a minimum @xmath89 is needed for the formation of a corona .",
    "two mechanisms can supply plasma : ( 1 ) ions and electrons can be lifted into the magnetosphere from the stellar surface .",
    "this requires a minimum voltage , e_e ~gm_i r_ns ~200 , corresponding to @xmath26 that is strong enough to lift ions ( of mass @xmath96 ) from the anode footpoint and electrons from the cathode footpoint .",
    "( 2 ) pairs can be created in the magnetosphere if e_e ~_mc^2 = 0.5 _ , which can accelerate particles to the lorentz factor @xmath97 sufficient to ignite @xmath4 creation .",
    "a third possible source  thermal @xmath4 production in a heated surface layer  will be discussed in   6 ; the corresponding minimum voltage is currently unknown .",
    "if @xmath89 is too low and the plasma is not supplied , a flux tube is guaranteed to generate a stronger electric field . the current becomes slightly charge - starved : that is , the net density of free charges becomes smaller than @xmath98 .",
    "the ultrastrong magnetic field , whose twist carries an enormous energy compared with the energy of the plasma , does not change and responds to the decrease of @xmath71 by generating an electric field : a small reduction of the conduction current @xmath71 induces a displacement current @xmath99 .",
    "the longitudinal electric field @xmath26 then quickly grows until it can pull particles away from the stellar surface and ignite pair creation .",
    "the limiting cases @xmath100 ( no decay of the twist ) and @xmath101 ( fast decay ) both imply a contradiction .",
    "the electric field and the plasma content of the corona must regulate each other toward a self - consistent state , and the gradual decay of the twist proceeds through a delicate balance : @xmath26 must be strong enough to supply plasma and maintain the current in the corona ; however , if plasma is oversupplied @xmath26 will be reduced by screening . a cyclic behavior is possible , in which plasma is periodically oversupplied and @xmath26 is screened .",
    "our numerical experiment will show that such a cyclic behavior indeed takes place .",
    "three facts facilitate our analysis of plasma dynamics in the electric circuit of magnetars :    \\1 .",
    "the ultrastrong magnetic field makes the particle dynamics 1-d .",
    "the rest - energy density of the coronal plasma is @xmath102 , where @xmath103 is the mass of a plasma particle .",
    "it is much smaller than the magnetic energy density @xmath104 : their ratio is @xmath105 .",
    "the magnetic field lines are not perturbed significantly by the plasma inertia , and they can be thought of as fixed `` rails '' along which the particles move .",
    "the particle motion is confined to the lowest landau level and is strictly parallel to the field .",
    "the particle motion is collisionless in the magnetosphere .",
    "it is governed by two forces only : the component of gravity projected onto the magnetic field and a collective electric field @xmath26 which is determined by the charge density distribution and must be found self - consistently .",
    "the star possesses a dense and thin atmospheric layer .. ] near the base of the atmosphere , the required current @xmath106 is easily conducted , with almost no electric field .",
    "therefore the circuit has simple boundary conditions : @xmath27 and fixed current .",
    "the atmosphere is much thicker than the skin depth of the plasma and screens the magnetospheric electric field from the star .",
    "our goal is to understand the plasma behavior above the screening layer , where the atmospheric density is exponentially reduced and an electric field @xmath26 must develop . the induced electric field @xmath31 and conduction current @xmath71 satisfy the maxwell equation , [ eq : maxw _ ] = + . here",
    "@xmath71 is parallel to the direction of the magnetic field .",
    "projection of equation  ( [ eq : maxw _ ] ) onto the magnetic field gives [ eq : jb ] = 4(-j ) , || , where we have taken into account the force - free condition @xmath107 .",
    "if the conduction current @xmath108 is smaller than @xmath65 , then @xmath109 and an electric field appears that tends to increase the current .",
    "alternatively , if @xmath110 then an electric field of the opposite sign develops which tends to reduce the current .",
    "thus , @xmath108 is always regulated toward @xmath64 .",

    "the timescale of this regulation , @xmath111 , is very short .",

    "thus the timescale of the current response to deviations of @xmath108 from @xmath65 is simply the langmuir plasma timescale @xmath116 , which is very short .",

    "the corresponding electron plasma frequency ( @xmath120 ) is @xmath121  hz . the current relaxes to @xmath65 on the timescale @xmath122  s , which is tiny compared with the light crossing timescale of the circuit .",
    "local deviations from charge neutrality tend to be erased on the same plasma timescale",

    "we will use the above definition of @xmath133 , however , one should keep in mind that plasma oscillations in the corona may have a smaller frequency because of relativistic effects .",

    "the continuity equation for @xmath144 charges reads + = 0 , where @xmath86 is the coordinate along the field line .",
    "suppose the circuit is steady , @xmath145 , and no strong deviation from neutrality occurs , i.e. @xmath146 everywhere .",
    "then one finds @xmath147 , that is the ratio of velocities must remain constant along the field line . hence @xmath148 and @xmath149 must _ both _ vanish at the footpoints",

    "we note that the approximation of 1d circuit , @xmath161 , excludes the excitation of transverse waves in the magnetosphere , which in reality can exist .",

    "the created pairs have kinetic energies @xmath465 , so they may elevate , overflow the gravitational barrier , and maintain the current .      in order to see how atmospheric pair production could affect the circuit ,",
    "we have done a few numerical simulations using the following toy model .",
    "we assume that the atmosphere responds to the heat flux from the corona by producing @xmath4 pairs .",
    "therefore , in addition to the ion - electron atmosphere , we now maintain a thermal @xmath4 atmosphere .",
    "its density at each boundary is regulated in the experiment so that it is proportional to the flux of lost energy through the boundary .",
    "if the atmospheric pairs were cold , the circuit would be in the same regime as in their absence .",
    "the fact that positrons are now available at the boundaries to carry the current instead of ions does not lead to any significant reduction of the voltage : it still evolves to the state with @xmath466 , in which energetic @xmath4 are supplied via the resonant - scattering channel .",
    "we have checked this by running the models with cold @xmath4 atmospheres .",
    "the key property of atmospheric pairs is , however , that they are created hot enough to feed the current thermally ( cf .   4.1 ) .",
    "their expected kinetic energy is comparable to the height of the gravitational barrier (   6.3.2 ) and they can overflow the barrier .",
    "therefore , the required current @xmath65 can be conducted at a small voltage @xmath467 .",
    "the thermally - driven regime was indeed established in our experiment with a realistic @xmath468 .",
    "the established voltage then depends on the efficiency of pair supply in response to the energy flux from the corona .",
    "we define the efficiency @xmath469 as the fraction of the energy flux through the boundary that is returned to the corona in the form of @xmath4 kinetic and rest - energy .",
    "we find that the voltage @xmath89 across the circuit adjusts so that the flux of released energy , @xmath470 , can generate the minimum flux of atmospheric pairs to feed the coronal current , @xmath471 .",
    "then voltage is related to @xmath469 roughly as @xmath472 .",
    "for example , a maximum efficiency @xmath473 would reduce the voltage to @xmath474 .",
    "we have done the corresponding experiment that confirmed this estimate .",
    "the voltage was found to fluctuate significantly , but it did not get high enough to initiate the resonant channel of @xmath4 production ( @xmath385 in the simulation ) . the ion current was small , @xmath475 .",
    "when @xmath469 is reduced , a higher voltage is required in the circuit according to the relation @xmath476 .",
    "this estimate is applicable as long as @xmath477 , so that @xmath467",
    ". a further reduction of @xmath469 does not lead to an increase of voltage : then the circuit is mainly fed by pairs created via the resonant channel , and @xmath342 as described in   5 .",
    "the thermal pair creation in the atmosphere then has a negligible effect on the circuit .",
    "we have also studied one modification of this experiment by allowing only the anode to supply pairs with efficiency @xmath478 . in this case , the @xmath4 atmosphere created by the anode filled the whole tube , and conducted the current .",
    "ions lifted from the anode surface contributed a small fraction to the current @xmath479 .",
    "the established voltage was @xmath480 times higher than in the model with pair supply at both ends .",
    "however , the circuit was able to operate without igniting the resonant pair creation ( which we checked by setting @xmath481 ) .",
    "this shows that the thermally - driven regime can operate even when pair creation takes place at one footpoint of the magnetic tube .    in summary",
    ", the coronal current may be fed by atmospheric @xmath4 instead of the pair discharge via the resonant channel if @xmath482 .",
    "the numerical coefficient in this condition increases if one of the surfaces ( anode or cathode ) dominates the pair supply .",
    "in addition to the heating by the relativistic beam that comes from the corona , the atmosphere may experience anomalous heating in response to the strong electric current .",
    "this type of heating is known to occur in astrophysical and laboratory plasmas when the drift speed of the current - carrying electrons , @xmath483 , exceeds the sound speed @xmath484 ( e.g. bernstein & kulsrud 1961 ) .",
    "if the electron current can be described as a shift of a maxwellian distribution with respect to the ions in velocity space , @xmath485 , a positive gradient @xmath486 appears in the electron distribution function viewed from the rest - frame of the ion component .",
    "the positive gradient exists at @xmath487 and will amplify slow plasma modes with phase speed along the magnetic field @xmath488 .",
    "the dispersion relation of ion - sound waves gives @xmath489 and they are easily amplified when @xmath490 .",
    "the excited ion - sound turbulence creates the anomalous resistivity and heating .    with an increasing level of turbulence , @xmath491 , the mean free path of the electrons @xmath436 decreases according to equation  ( [ eq : ell ] )",
    "this implies a higher resistivity and a lower thermal conductivity .",
    "thus , a reduced @xmath436 leads to a strong anomalous heating and the suppression of heat conduction out of the layer .",
    "it is then possible that the layer is overheated , loses hydrostatic balance , and expands in a runway manner .",
    "we now estimate the critical @xmath436 for this to happen .",
    "we neglect the radiative losses in this estimate .",
    "the ohmic heating rate per unit area of the layer is f_ohmh , where @xmath492 , @xmath493 is electrical conductivity , and @xmath494 is electron thermal speed . the conductive heat loss @xmath495 is given by equation  ( [ eq : fc ] ) , and we find [ fluxrat ] = ( ) ^2 ( ) ^2 ( ) ^-2 .",
    "hence the layer must be overheated if [ lratio ] < 210 ^ -3 _ e^-3/2_c . here",
    "@xmath496 (   6.2 ) , and the temperature is limited by pair creation to @xmath497 ( see   [ pairatm ] ) .",
    "one can see that the ohmic overheating requires a high level of plasma turbulence , when the mean - free path is strongly reduced compared to the coulomb value .",
    "this level is achievable in principle because it is still below the upper limit @xmath498 that corresponds to the minimum @xmath499 .",
    "indeed , ^1/2 ( ) ^1/2 = ( ) ^1/2 ( ) ^1/2 210 ^ -7 .",
    "note that anomalous heating becomes interesting only when the thermal heat flux is strongly suppressed . in other words , @xmath500 may compete with @xmath495 and overheat the layer only when @xmath495 is small .",

    "@xmath505 , its total power would not exceed @xmath506  erg  s@xmath18 .",
    "this is two orders of magnitude smaller than the observed luminosity of the corona , and hence the anomalous heating of the atmosphere is unlikely to generate the observed activity .",
    "the marginally stable state @xmath507 has an electrostatic potential drop @xmath508 across the layer , which equals the energy gained by an electron crossing the layer .",
    "since @xmath208 is limited by pair creation , the maximum potential drop that can be sustained by the layer is @xmath509 .",
    "this is at least 2 orders of magnitude lower than the voltage @xmath335 that is developed in the corona with @xmath4 discharges .",
    "if the turbulence in the transition layer reaches the level required for runaway heating , the plasma may be supplied to the corona at a much lower voltage compared with the pair discharge described in   5 .",
    "pair creation in the atmosphere ( see   [ pairatm ] ) would tend to reduce its mean molecular weight and increase @xmath228 . when the expressions for @xmath500 and @xmath495 are modified to include the pair density , @xmath510 , one finds that the critical value of @xmath511 for runaway heating ( eq .  [ lratio ] ) increases as @xmath512 .",
    "the critical value of pair density is @xmath513 , at which the diffusive flux of hot @xmath4 out of the atmosphere dominates the corona and shortens out the electric circuit .",
    "one finds the relation [ eq : ohmpair ] = ( ) ^2 .",
    "if the atmosphere is the main source of charges for the coronal current then @xmath514 is expected .",
    "ohmic heating is unimportant in such an `` electrically regulated '' atmosphere if @xmath515",

    "perhaps a cyclic overheating with pair enrichment would occur .",
    "the effects discussed in this section indicate the possibility of an alternative way of forming the corona , through heating and pair creation in the atmosphere .",
    "this would require a high level of turbulence in the atmospheric plasma , and it is unclear whether this level is reached .",
    "observations of the high - energy tail of the x - ray spectrum may help constrain the composition and temperature of the transition layer .",
    "the existence of an ion current in the magnetosphere implies the transfer of mass from the anode footpoint of a magnetic line to its cathode footpoint .",

    "yr , a significant mass is transferred through the magnetosphere , @xmath522   g. it is much larger than the mass of the stellar atmosphere , and the atmosphere is quickly removed from the anode part of the stellar surface .",
    "there is , however , a mechanism which can re - generate the atmosphere and regulate its column density .",
    "a thin atmosphere is unable to stop the energetic particles flowing from the corona and these particles will hit the crust and knock out new ions . in a steady state , the atmosphere column density can adjust so that the rate of ion supply equals the rate of their transfer through the corona",
    ". then the rate of crust excavation at the anode footpoints is proportional to the ion current through the corona .",
    "excavation depends on the chemical composition of the uppermost crust of the neutron star .",

    "the knock out of light elements by the beam is still possible in this case because of spallation reactions .",

    "light elements  hydrogen and helium  may be present only above a certain depth that may be estimated as follows .",
    "the column mass density @xmath524 above a given depth in the crust is related to pressure @xmath525 at this depth through the equation of hydrostatic equilibrium , g = p = eb_ns2 ^ 2 p_f^2 2 .",
    "here it is taken into account that the pressure is dominated by degenerate electrons that are confined to their lowest landau state ( @xmath526 in the density range of interest ) ; @xmath527 and @xmath528^{1/2}$ ] is the fermi energy .",
    "a conservative upper bound on the depth of a hydrogen layer is obtained by balancing @xmath529 with the threshold for electron captures on protons , @xmath530  mev .",
    "this corresponds to @xmath531  g  @xmath119 . at larger depths , free protons",

    "a more realistic upper bound takes into account that hydrogen is burned into helium , and the maximum depth of a helium layer is limited by the triple - alpha reaction @xmath533c , which is very temperature - dependent .",
    "the interior of a magnetar probably sustains a temperature of @xmath534  k at an age of @xmath535  yr ( e.g. arras , cumming , & thompson 2004 ) . in the presence of a light - element atmosphere , the crust temperature remains close to the central temperature at depths @xmath536  g  @xmath119 ( e.g. potekhin et al . 2003 ) . at such densities and temperatures helium ( and hydrogen ) can not be present  its lifetime would be only @xmath537  yr where @xmath538 is the electron fraction .",
    "helium may survive only in an upper layer of density @xmath539  g  @xmath119 , where temperature is below @xmath540  k.    the maximal layer of light elements will be drained rapidly from the anode surface and deposited at the cathode surface in the presence of a magnetic twist .",

    "it is faster than hydrogen consumption through diffusion to a deeper layer of carbon ( chang , arras , & bildsten 2004 ) .",
    "we conclude that the anode surface of the star should be made of heavier elements  carbon or iron .",
    "a gaseous atmosphere of light elements may be maintained above such a condensed , heavy - element surface due to the beam of energetic particles from the corona .",
    "when the coronal beam enters the crust , it is stopped by two - body collisions , and collective processes become negligible . in particular , the growth length of beam instability @xmath407 ( eq .  [ [ eq : lbeam ] ] ) is much larger than the mean free path to two - body collisions ( their ratio scales as @xmath547 and is large in condensed matter because @xmath391 is large ) .",

    "thus , a pair cascade develops as a beam with initial @xmath564 propagates into the crust , giving more @xmath4 with lower lorentz factors @xmath565 .",
    "this branch of the cascade operates for a large fraction of the de - excitation photons .",
    "photons that can not immediately convert off the field ( a fraction @xmath566 ) will wait until they interact with an ion in the crust ( photon splitting is slow compared with photon - ion interaction ) .",

    "collisions initiate a cascade similar to that in the crust : the beam particles collide with ions and emit photons that convert to pairs . off the field . ( 2 ) splitting of e - mode occurs faster than photon - ion interaction .",

    "the crustal spallation rate will be reduced if the beam is decelerated to @xmath585 before reaching the solid surface .",
    "this requires @xmath586 generations of pair - creation , and so the optical depth to coulomb collisions should be @xmath480 .",

    "atm~ ~100b_15 ^ -1 .",
    "if @xmath587 , the crust will not supply the ion flux implied by our circuit solution with @xmath342 .",

    "the thickness of the plasma layer that is accumulated near the cathode surface is limited by burning processes and diffusion to greater depths ( chang et al .",

    "remarkably , this complicated global behavior may be described as essentially one - dimensional electric circuit that is subject to simple boundary conditions @xmath589 on the surface of the star and can be studied using a direct numerical experiment .",
    "the established voltage across the entire magnetospheric circuit is marginally sufficient to accelerate an electron ( or positron ) to the energy where collisions with ambient x - ray photons spawn new pairs .",
    "this physical condition determines the rate of energy dissipation in the corona .",
    "the voltage is maintained by small deviations from charge neutrality in the coronal plasma as required by gauss law .",
    "the generation of this voltage is precisely the self - induction effect of the gradually decaying magnetic twist , and the energy release in the corona is fed by the magnetic energy of the twisted field .",
    "canonical radio pulsars are usually assumed to have a magnetosphere that is almost everywhere potential , @xmath590 , except for narrow bundles of open field lines that connect the polar caps of the star to its light cylinder .",
    "the plasma content of the magnetosphere then depends on its rotation : the charge density @xmath591 must be maintained to screen the electric field induced by rotation ( goldreich & julian 1969 ) . in this picture",

    "previous studies of plasma near neutron stars focused on open magnetic lines .",
    "it was shown that pair discharge can be sparked near the polar cap ( ruderman & sutherland 1975 ; arons & scharlemann 1979 ; muslimov & tsygan 1992 ) , and the created pairs carry the current @xmath592 toward the light cylinder .",
    "recent calculations of the discharge ( harding & muslimov 2002 ) employ an approximate analytic prescription for the decay of the electric field with distance from the star .",
    "( self - consistent calculations of the electric field and pair creation are now available for the outer gap , see takata et al . 2006 . )",
    "the global dynamics of the plasma on open magnetic lines is poorly understood because of the complicated behavior at the light cylinder , so only one boundary condition is known  at the polar cap .",
    "the solution presented in this paper applies to currents along _ closed _ magnetic lines of the inner magnetosphere . in this case , it is easier to find the global solution for the plasma dynamics because both boundary conditions are defined at the two footpoints of the magnetic lines .",
    "this problem has important applications to the magnetar physics for two reasons : ( 1 ) the observed radiative output is generated in the closed magnetosphere  the dissipation rate on the open field lines is orders of magnitude smaller and can not explain the observed emission .",
    "( 2 ) a current is naturally created on closed magnetic lines because they are twisted by the starquakes of magnetars , and our solution shows that such twists have a long lifetime .",
    "one may compare the twist of open magnetic lines at the polar cap , as sustained by the rotation of the star , @xmath593 , with the twist that can be created in the closed magnetosphere by the starquakes .",

    "such a beam must be stopped by coulomb collisions and relativistic bremsstrahlung in the solid crust .",

    "the footpoints of magnetic lines of the solar corona are constantly pushed and twisted because the outer envelope of the sun is convective and in constant motion .",
    "in addition , magnetic flux tubes are observed to emerge from the solar convection zone with a twist already implanted in them . by contrast , the neutron star s rigid crust is subject only to rare and sporadic yielding events ( starquakes ) . because the crust is stably stratified , the transfer of a toroidal magnetic field to the exterior occurs through a differential rotation of the crustal material along the gravitational equipotential surfaces .",
    "the magnetic twists have long lifetimes between starquakes , and their evolution differs from the evolution of twists in the solar corona .",
    "once a current @xmath608 is created in the magnetosphere of a neutron star , it lives a long time because the net current @xmath609 is enormous and maintained by its self - induction .",
    "the gradual decay of the current induces an e.m.f . along the magnetic field lines , which forces the plasma and electric field to self - organize into a quasi - steady electric circuit .",
    "the ease with which charges can be supplied by @xmath4 production when the induced voltage exceeds @xmath2  gev implies a `` bottleneck '' for the decay of the twist (    2 and 5 ) .",
    "the evolution of the magnetic field between the starquakes involves a gradual release of the twist energy through joule dissipation and spreading of the twist toward the magnetic polar axis .",
    "the latter process causes a gradual flaring of the poloidal field lines .",
    "explosive magnetic reconnection similar to solar flares is likely to be triggered by starquakes , but not during the following slow - dissipation stage .",
    "the external magnetic field of a magnetar is likely to have less small - scale structure compared with the solar corona .",
    "the small - scale braiding of magnetic lines followed by reconnection and dissipation is one of the possible heating mechanisms for the solar corona ( parker 1979 ) .",
    "precisely what creates this structure is unclear : it could be driven by the hydrodynamic turbulence that is excited at the top of the solar convection zone or by the taylor relaxation of a helical magnetic field ( e.g. diamond & malkov 2003 ) . in magnetars ,",
    "the small - scale structure of magnetic field can be expected to dissipate quickly after the starquakes if it is created in these events .",
    "the dissipation timescale is longest for the large - scale twists expected from large - scale motions of the crust .",
    "indirect evidence that small - scale instabilities are less important comes from the observed distribution of energies of sgr bursts : the cumulative energy in bursts @xmath610 is weighted toward the largest events ( cheng et al .",
    "1996 ; gogus et al . 2001 ) .",
    "by contrast , several recent measurements of the distribution of solar flare energies suggest a power - law @xmath611 with @xmath612 , and are therefore consistent with the basic picture of coronal heating by ` nano - flares ' ( walsh & ireland 2003 ) .",
    "the rapid cooling of the transverse motion of charged particles in the ultra - strong magnetic field of magnetars makes the particle distribution functions one - dimensional .",
    "this reduces the number of relevant plasma modes in the corona .",
    "the coronal plasma of magnetars is continually lost to the surface and re - generated . by contrast , the solar corona is in hydrostatic equilibrium .",
    "its density @xmath613 is much higher than the minimum needed to maintain the current , and the mean drift speed @xmath614 of the coronal currents is much below the electron and ion thermal speeds .",
    "so , the _ mean _ current does not experience a strong anomalous resistivity .",
    "strong plasma turbulence is expected in localized current sheets and can develop explosively , giving rise to the solar flares . in the magnetar corona , a strong turbulence",
    "is maintained routinely , everywhere where current flows .",
    "the very mechanism of the current supply involves a strongly non - linear phenomenon  @xmath4 discharge .",
    "the magnetar corona is dominated by relativistic @xmath4 pairs . as indicated by our numerical experiments , ions lifted from the surface",
    "contribute a modest fraction , perhaps @xmath615% , to the charge flow .      from the plasma physics point of view",
    ", there is an interesting connection between the magnetospheric circuit and the double - layer problem that was first studied by langmuir ( 1929 ) and later by many authors ( for reviews see radau 1989 ; block 1978 ) .",
    "the magnetospheric current flows along a magnetic tube with footpoints on a cold conductor and is subject to the boundary condition @xmath616 at the footpoints .",
    "we argued that the tube curvature is not essential to understanding many features of the circuit , and studied the charge flow in a straight tube where gravity is replaced by a force @xmath617 that attracts plasma to the anode and cathode boundaries .",
    "the longitudinal electric field must develop between the two boundaries because of gravity .",
    "this is a significant difference from the normally invoked mechanisms for double - layer formation ( such as current - driven instability ) . in our case , gravity traps the thermal particles at the magnetic footpoints and impedes the flow of the current that is required by the self - induction of the twisted magnetic field .",
    "thus , perfect conditions for double - layer formation are created . and indeed , our numerical experiment showed the formation of a huge relativistic double layer between the footpoints , of size @xmath78 .",
    "this result is obtained if the current can be maintained only by particles lifted from the anode and cathode surfaces .",
    "it could have dramatic consequences for the magnetar physics because of the huge dissipation rate in the double layer : the energy of magnetic twist would be quickly released in a powerful burst .",
    "however , there is one more ingredient in the problem , which again makes the magnetar circuit different from the previously studied double layers : new charges ( @xmath4 ) can be created by accelerated particles in the tube .",
    "this process qualitatively changes the problem because voltage is now limited by @xmath4 discharge (   5 ) . as a result",
    ", the circuit enters the new state of self - organized criticality where voltage repeatedly builds up and is screened by the @xmath4 creation .",
    "this allows the current to flow and maintain the required @xmath343 .",
    "the poloidal field lines are inflated compared with a pure dipole , so that a larger magnetic flux connects the star to its light cylinder @xmath618 .",
    "this implies a higher spin - down torque .",
    "thus , the twisting leads to a higher spindown rate @xmath619 .",
    "the minimum particle density needed to maintain the currents , @xmath620 , is high enough to make the magnetosphere semi - opaque .",
    "the main source of opacity is resonant cyclotron scattering .",
    "if the magnetic field lines are twisted , then the optical depth to scattering happens to be @xmath621 ( independent of @xmath622 , @xmath171 , and nature of the flowing charges ) .",
    "scattering by the magnetospheric charges must modify the x - ray spectrum and pulse profile .",
    "tlk also pointed out that if the magnetospheric current is carried by ions and electrons lifted from the stellar surface by a minimum voltage @xmath623 , then one expects a dissipation rate comparable to the observed persistent luminosity of magnetars .",
    "the density of the plasma corona is found to be close to its minimum @xmath620 as conjectured by tlk .",
    "it is largely made of @xmath4 pairs rather than electron - ion plasma .",
    "this suggests that the optical depth of the corona is determined mostly by the cyclotron resonance of @xmath4 .",
    "all species of particles ( @xmath402 , @xmath403 , and even ions ) flow with relativistic bulk speeds and large temperatures @xmath624 .",
    "the cyclotron resonance is very broad , which will have important implications for radiative transfer through the corona .",
    "note , however , that our calculations focused on small radii @xmath625 where most of the energy release occurs . at larger radii @xmath626 , where electron cyclotron energy is in the kev range ,",
    "@xmath4 feel a strong radiative drag force and can decelerate to a small velocity .",
    "we defer a detailed analysis of this part of the corona to another paper .",
    "the voltage @xmath627  gev along the twisted magnetic lines of the corona is regulated by the threshold for @xmath4 discharge , and its exact value depends on @xmath171 and the spectrum of target photons involved in @xmath4 creation , especially on its high - energy tail at @xmath628  kev (   5 ) . by coincidence ,",
    "the mean electric field developed along the magnetic lines , @xmath629 , is marginally sufficient to lift ions from the anode footpoint .",
    "therefore , in addition to @xmath4 pairs , some ions are present in the corona .",
    "their abundance depends on the exact @xmath89 and is about 10% for @xmath630  gev ( see fig .",
    "the coronal ions may produce interesting features in the magnetar spectrum and likely to play a key role in the low - frequency emission (   8.4.2 ) .",
    "the rate of energy dissipation in the twisted magnetosphere is given by @xmath631 where @xmath594 is the net current through the corona .",

    "the energy stored in it is @xmath639 .",
    "this energy dissipates in a time @xmath640 the exact numerical coefficient in this equation again depends on the concrete magnetic configuration .",
    "for example , the energy stored in the global twist of a dipole is @xmath641 ( tlk ) , where @xmath642 is the energy of a normal dipole . in this case",
    ", one finds @xmath643 .",
    "the characteristic timescale of decay is determined by voltage @xmath89 and the corona luminosity @xmath644 .",
    "note that a stronger twist ( brighter corona ) lives longer .",
    "given a measured luminosity and its decay time , one may infer @xmath89 and compare it with the theoretically expected value .",
    "since @xmath89 does not change as the twist decays in our model , one can solve equation  ( [ eq : tdecay ] ) for @xmath645 and @xmath646 .",
    "this gives [ eq : ldecay ] l_diss(t)=510 ^ 35()^-2 ( t_0-t )  erg  s^-1 , where time @xmath647 is expressed in years .",
    "the final decay of the twist should occur at a well - defined time @xmath648 .",
    "the finite time of decay implies that the emission called `` persistent '' in this paper is not , strictly speaking , persistent .",
    "if the time between large - scale starquakes is longer than @xmath649 , the magnetar should be seen to enter a quiescent state and the observed luminosity should then be dominated by the surface blackbody emission .",
    "the voltage @xmath89 implies a certain effective resistivity of the corona , @xmath93 .",
    "this resistivity leads to spreading of the electric current _ across _ the magnetic lines .",
    "equivalently , the magnetic helicity is redistributed within the magnetosphere .",
    "this spreading is described by the induction equation @xmath650 .",
    "the magnitude of @xmath651 depends on the gradient of @xmath26 transverse to the twisted magnetic field lines .",

    "if a twisting event happens near the magnetic equator , it initially does not affect the extended magnetic lines with @xmath656 .",
    "its impact on spindown may appear with a delay as long as @xmath657 .",

    "their ratio is @xmath658 and depends sensitively on geometrical factors .",
    "it is possible that starquakes occurring far from the poles will have little effect on the spindown .",
    "even a small ion current implies a large transfer of mass through the magnetosphere over the @xmath22-yr active lifetime of a magnetar .",
    "essentially all hydrogen and helium that could be stored in the upper crust is rapidly transferred from the anode surface to the cathode surface , thereby exposing heavier elements ( e.g. carbon ) that are strongly bound in molecular chains .",
    "a continuing flux of protons can , nonetheless , be maintained in the circuit .",
    "the bombarding relativistic electrons from the corona cause the gradual disruption of ions just below the solid surface .",
    "they trigger a cascade of @xmath4 pairs and gamma - rays that knock out nucleons and occasionally @xmath659-particles from the heavier nuclei",

    "our study of the transition layer between the corona and the star (   [ sc : layer ] ) suggests that the energy dissipated in the corona is radiated below it in two forms ( see also thompson & beloborodov 2005 ) .",

    "an outburst , which occured between november 2002 and january 2003 , was followed by the gradual decay of soft x - ray emission on a time - scale of a few years , and now the source is returning to the quiesent state .",
    "it would be especially interesting to observe the evolution of the hard x - ray component , which is not detected in the relatively weak axp  j1810 - 197 .    during periods of high activity ,",
    "when bursts occur frequently , the growth of the magnetospheric twist may be faster than its decay .",
    "the twist may grow to the point of a global instability .",
    "when the magnetic lines achieve @xmath737 the magnetosphere becomes unstable and relaxes to a smaller twist angle .",
    "a huge release of energy must then occur , producing a giant flare ; a model of how this can happen is dicussed by lyutikov ( 2006 ) .",
    "it is possible that the 27  december  2004 giant flare from sgr  1806 - 20 was produced in this way  a prolonged period of unusually high activity preceded the flare .",
    "if the flare indeed released the external twist energy , then the current through the magnetosphere should have decreased after the flare , and the coronal luminosity now should be smaller than it was prior to the flare .    a possible way to probe",
    "the twist evolution is to measure the history of spindown rate @xmath619 of the magnetar .",
    "the existing data confirm the theoretical expectations : the spin - down of sgrs was observed to accelerate months to years following periods of activity ( kouveliotou et al .",
    "1998 , 1999 ; woods et al . 2002 ) .",
    "a similar effect was also observed following more gradual , sub - eddington flux enhancement in axps ( gavriil & kaspi 2004 ) .",
    "this `` hysteresis '' behavior of the spindown rate may represent the delay with which the twist is spreading to the outer magnetosphere .    since the density of the plasma corona is proportional to the current that flows through it , changes in the twist also lead to changes in the coronal opacity .",
    "the opacity should increase following bursts of activity and affect the x - ray pulse profile and spectrum .",
    "such changes , which persist for months to years , have been observed following large x - ray outbursts from two sgrs ( woods et al . 2001 ) .",
    "we focused in this paper on the inner magnetosphere , that is , on field lines that do not extend beyond a radius @xmath602 .",
    "this part of the magnetosphere is expected to retain most of the toroidal field energy , and to dominate the non - thermal output of the star .",
    "the outer corona may be qualitatively different because it is subject to a strong `` cyclotron drag '' : the resonantly scattered x - rays can escape ( rather than convert to @xmath4 ) , thus providing an efficient sink of energy .",
    "this drag will cause a local change of the electric field in the circuit ( tlk ; thompson & beloborodov 2005 ) . at yet larger radii , beyond @xmath738",
    "km from the star , ions may populate higher landau levels @xmath549 .",
    "then a new degree of freedom appears in the problem : the transverse motion of the ions .",
    "\\2 . like the solar transition region ,",
    "the transition layer at the base of a magnetar corona may respond to the coronal dissipation by increasing the supply of plasma .",
    "in particular , pair creation in the transition layer needs further investigation because pairs may feed the coronal current (   [ pairatm ] ) .",
    "the state of this layer and its effect on the corona is determined by the level of plasma turbulence ( see    [ cond ] and [ anom ] ) .",
    "this layer may partially insulate the star from the hot corona because plasma turbulence suppresses thermal conduction . by trapping the generated heat ,",
    "the layer may overheat and expand to the corona .",
    "the transition layer also plays a crucial role in the energy balance of the corona because it produces radiation that can escape the magnetar .",
    "a significant part of the released energy is emitted in the hard x - ray band .",
    "the rest of the released energy is deposited in an optically thick surface layer and reprocessed into blackbody radiaton with @xmath739 kev .",
    "an accurate calculation of the ratio of the two emission components ( hard x - ray to blackbody ) that are fed by the corona remains to be done .",
    "the role of transverse waves in the corona , which were suppressed in our numerical experiment , will need to be studied .",
    "the waves produce a three - dimensional pattern of magnetic - field fluctuations @xmath740 and their study will require 3-d or 2-d simulations .",
    "our plasma model of the corona may be generalized to include the effects of rotation .",
    "this can be done by changing the neutrality condition @xmath741 to @xmath742 .",
    "note that @xmath743 may be easily maintained by a small polarization of the current - carrying plasma because @xmath744 ( see eq .  [ [ rhoco ] ] ) .",
    "it can be taken into account by adding an extra source term @xmath745 to the poisson equation ( cf .",
    "eq .  [ eq : gauss1 ] ) , @xmath746",
    ". then @xmath26 vanishes if @xmath742 along the magnetic line , so that @xmath743 is the new equilibrium charge density .",
    "it is important to understand the resistive redistribution of the twist in the magnetosphere , in particular its spreading toward the open field lines , because it is a promising source of torque variability in active magnetars ( tlk ) .",
    "this would require the construction of a global , time - dependent model of the currents in the magnetosphere .",
