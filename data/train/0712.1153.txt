    "@xmath0he confined or adsorbed in nanoporous media is an interesting model system of strongly correlated bosons under external potential .",

    ", we have made measurements of heat capacity and isochoric pressure@xcite . in this paper , we summarize the recent experimental results and propose an interpretation that will provide a novel perspective to the physics of @xmath0he in porous media : the confinement of @xmath0he to nanopores fluctuates the phase of superfluid order parameter , and the phase fluctuations results in the localization of bose - einstein condensates and a quantum phase transition .",
    "here we summarize the results of the measurements of pressure and heat capacity , and describe in more detail about the torsional oscillator studies , focusing on the temperature dependence of the superfluid fraction .",
    "the details of the results have been described elsewhere@xcite .",
    "we have employed a porous gelsil glass@xcite , which is manufactured by the sol - gel process .",
    "gelsil has three - dimensionally ( 3d ) interconnected nanopores , similarly to vycor .",
    "the nominal pore diameter of our glass samples is 2.5 nm .",
    "since various pore sizes are available , gelsil has been recently used in helium studies .",
    "the controllability and wide variety of the pore size were not available in vycor .",
    "it was first employed for @xmath0he study by miyamoto and takano ( mt)@xcite .",
    "they found that the superfluid transition in a 2.5-nm gelsil sample was depressed to 0.9 k at ambient pressure .",
    "we have constructed a heat capacity cell having a capacitance pressure gauge@xcite .",
    "this cell enables us to measure the pressure and heat capacity for the same glass sample .",
    "the sample cell contains four gelsil disk samples ( 5.5 mm diameter , 2.3 mm thick ) which are taken from the same batch as the one used in the torsional oscillator experiments .    in the pressure study@xcite , we measure pressure @xmath11 along isochores",
    ". the rates of cooling and warming of the cell are also recorded simultaneously .",
    "both data show some signatures that are related to freezing and melting of @xmath0he in the nanopores .",
    "the freezing and melting occur at different temperatures and in finite temperature ranges , unlike the first order transition of bulk @xmath0he .",
    "we have identified @xmath11 at which @xmath0he starts and terminates to freeze and thaw .",
    "the four data sets are plotted in fig .",
    "[ phasediagram ] .",
    "the reduction of freezing and melting temperatures observed above 3.7 mpa . below 3.4 mpa",
    ", no signatures indicating freezing and melting were observed .",
    "the liquid - solid boundary below 0.8 k should therefore be located between 3.7 and 3.4 mpa , meaning that the freezing line is nearly flat and the entropy difference between the solid and nonsuperfluid phases is small .",
    "this fact strongly suggests that the nonsuperfluid phase is a sort of an ordered state .    to clarify the nature of the low - entropy nonsuperfluid state , we have conducted the heat capacity measurement@xcite . in fig .",
    "[ crhos](a ) is shown the heat capacity data , in which @xmath0he in the nanopores is liquid . a broad , but",
    "substantial peak is found in each heat capacity .",
    "the peak temperature @xmath5 indicated by arrows and the peak height decrease as @xmath3 increases .",
    "we plot @xmath5 on the phase diagram of fig .",
    "[ phasediagram ] .",
    "obviously , the `` @xmath5 line '' is located about 0.2k below the @xmath12 line , and is parallel to the @xmath12 line .",
    "the heat capacity peak is reminiscent of the superfluid size effect in @xmath0he in various restricted geometries@xcite .",
    "however , the system exhibits no superfluid transition at and just below @xmath5 .",
    "this is clearly seen in fig .",
    "[ crhos](b ) , the data of the frequency shift in the torsional oscillator measurement . in fig .",
    "[ crhos](b ) , small upturns seen in both data around 2 k are due to the superfluid transition of the bulk liquid in the open space of the cell .",
    "the large , abrupt increase at lower temperatures indicates the superfluid transition of @xmath0he confined in the nanopores .",
    "the superfluid transition temperature @xmath1 is much lower than @xmath5 , and it decreases progressively with increasing pressure . the remarkable difference in the behaviors of two characteristic temperatures",
    "is obviously seen in fig .",
    "[ phasediagram ] .",
    "torsional oscillator technique@xcite is based on a simple relationship that the frequency shift @xmath13 is proportional to the superfluid density @xmath14 .",
    "therefore , @xmath15 should contain essential information for understanding the nature of superfluidity . in the next section we focus on the behavior of @xmath16 .",
    "here we mention some features in the @xmath15 curves in two density regions : ( 1 ) adsorbed films to filled - pore states , ( 2 ) pressurized states at @xmath17 mpa .",
    "the adsorbed film shows the superfluid response when the coverage exceeds the critical coverage @xmath18 .",
    "the superfluid transition temperature @xmath1 increases almost linearly with the superfluid coverage @xmath19 , and has a maximum at @xmath20 , at which the pore is filled with @xmath0he .",
    "it should be noted that the amount of the nonsuperfluid ( i.e. `` inert '' ) layers adjacent to the pore walls are larger than that of superfluid liquid under ambient pressure .",
    "the `` effective '' pore diameter for the superfluid part is therefore reduced to about 1.5 nm .    from the slope of @xmath21 in the nonsuperfluid and superfluid states",
    ", we obtained the ratio of undetected superfluid mass to total superfluid mass , the so called @xmath22 factor , to be 0.1 .",
    "this value is much smaller than 0.33 in the case of vycor , but larger than the obtained value by mt for the similar gelsil glass , 0.06 .",
    "these results indicate that the nanopores in gelsil are more tortuous than the pores in vycor .",

    "[ filmrhosn](a ) .",
    "there exists substantial difference in the temperature dependence of @xmath30 among three experiments .",
    "our gelsil data lies between the vycor data and gelsil data by mt , and possess the features of these two systems . in the vycor case",
    ", @xmath31 is proportional to @xmath32 at low temperatures , and show a bulk - like critical behavior near @xmath1@xcite .",
    "the @xmath32 behavior suggests that one - dimensional phonons are the dominant low - energy excitations . in the gelsil experiment by mt@xcite",

    "a @xmath2-linear behavior emerges . in order to see the crossover from the nearly parabolic to linear temperature dependence ,",

    "the coefficients @xmath39 and @xmath40 obtained from the linear - parabola fitting @xmath41 for the data taken at nine pressures.,width=321 ]",
    "we have proposed in the previous publications that the qpt behavior , i.e. the anomalous reduction in superfluid @xmath1 , results from the localization of bose - einstein condensates in the nonsuperfluid state@xcite .",
    "we believe that this conjecture is now proven by the heat capacity measurement@xcite .    the idea of the localized bec ( lbec ) is shown in a cartoon of fig .",
    "[ lbec ] : when liquid @xmath0he is confined in the nanopores , the bec transition temperature should be reduced below bulk @xmath42 due to the size effect . around a certain temperature below @xmath42 ,",
    "many becs grow from large pores or intersections of pores , in which @xmath0he atoms can exchange frequently their positions .",
    "the size of the becs is roughly limited to the pore size . the atom exchange between the becs via the narrow regions of the pores are interrupted , because @xmath0he atom has a hard core . for the movement of one @xmath0he atom ,",
    "the surrounding @xmath0he atoms act as a potential .",
    "the lack of the atom exchanges causes fluctuations in phase of the superfluid order parameter .",
    "therefore , no phase coherence exists among the becs , and the whole system has also no global phase coherence and does not exhibit superfluidity that can be detected by macroscopic and dynamical measurements such as torsional oscillator . as the temperature is further decreased , the phase coherence between the localized becs grows , and macroscopic superfluidity , which is detected by torsional oscillator technique , is realized when most of the becs coalesce .    a cartoon showing the formation of localized becs ( lbec ) ( shown as white ) in a porous glass substrate ( dark grey ) .",
    "@xmath0he atoms form many small bec s at the wider regions ( especially intersections of the pores ) , where the atoms can exchange actively .",
    "the phase of each bec is illustrated by thick arrows . since no phase coherence exist among the lbecs due to the hard core of @xmath0he suppressing the spatial exchanges at the narrower regions ( light grey ) , the whole system exhibits no superfluidity on macroscopic length scale . as temperature",
    "is lowered , thermal phase fluctuations are diminished , and the system should undergo a macroscopic superfluid transition at some temperature @xmath1.,height=188 ]    the heat capacity peak provides a definite evidence for the formation of lbecs at @xmath5 . broad peak structure in heat capacity is a common feature of @xmath0he in restricted geometries , and was recognized as a manifestation of superfluidity and bec .",
    "the temperature dependence of the heat capacity ( the shape of the peak ) of @xmath0he in gelsil agrees semi - quantitatively with that in restricted geometries such as vycor . in our @xmath0he - gelsil system , however , the superfluid @xmath1 is much lower than the peak temperature @xmath5 , so the nanoscale bec occurs around @xmath5 without macroscopic superfluid transition .",
    "heat capacity peak without macroscopic superfluidity has been observed in liquid @xmath0he droplets formed in metal foils @xcite . in this case",
    "each droplet that is several nanometers in diameter is perfectly independent , and the droplets never exhibit superfluidity in macroscopic sense .",
    "the situation of @xmath0he in nanoporous gelsil is rather similar to this droplet system .    in the abovementioned lbec scenario ,",
    "the smallness of the pore size is only essential to the qpt behavior .",
    "it has been pointed out that disorder or randomness in porous structures produces boson localization called bose glass state@xcite . in the bose glass state ,",
    "the condensates localize at the local minima of the random potentials , and macroscopic phase coherence is lost by the localization of atoms as in the case of narrowness - induced lbec .",
    "kobayashi and tsubota have recently studied superfluidity of @xmath0he confined in a 3d random model potential taking account of the feature of our 2.5-nm gelsil@xcite .",
    "they found that superfluidity disappears above 4.2 mpa due to the localization of the becs .",
    "it is in close agreement with our observation .      in the lbec state ,",
    "phase of the superfluid order parameter in each lbec is fluctuating .",
    "this phase fluctuation can contribute to the superfluid properties below @xmath1 .",
    "we propose that the @xmath2-linear behavior in the super-(or normal ) fluid density observed at high pressures ( fig .",
    "[ coefficient ] ) is the manifestation of the phase fluctuations that are induced thermally ( classically ) .",
    "the effects of phase fluctuation has been studied in josephson junction arrays @xcite and granular metal films@xcite , which show a superconductor - insulator quantum phase transition by controlling some experimental parameters such as magnetic field .",
    "it has also been proposed in the field of high-@xmath1 cuprates that the phase fluctuations play an important role on the properties of underdoped regimes .",
    "emery and kivelson ( ek)@xcite argued that low carrier - density superconductors such as high-@xmath1 cuprates are characterized by a small phase stiffness , and consequently the large phase fluctuations dominate notably the superconducting properties of underdoped regimes .",
    "the emergence of the `` pseudo - gap '' states is caused by the local cooper pairing without global phase coherence throughout the sample , and the onset of long range phase order determines the true superconducting transition that is detected by macroscopic means .",
    "this proposed mechanism is exactly the same as the lbec picture in the @xmath0he - nanopore system .",
    "the lbec state just corresponds to the ek pseudogap state .",
    "the superfluid systems that are controlled by phase fluctuations possess the following characteristics@xcite :    1 .",
    "the superfluid density @xmath43 is low , i.e. the phase stiffness ( helicity modulus ) is small even at 0 k. 2 .",
    "the local order occurs at higher temperature than the long - range phase ordering .",
    "if the phase fluctuation is thermally excited , @xmath43 is proportional to @xmath2 at low @xmath2 .",
    "4 .   the long - range ordering @xmath1 is proportional to @xmath43 .    in high-@xmath1 cuprates ,",
    "the @xmath2-linear behavior was observed by the measurement of penetration depth@xcite .",
    "although it is also attributed to the @xmath44-wave nature of the gap function , xy models with classical phase fluctuations reproduce quite well the overall temperature dependence of @xmath43@xcite .",
    "the smallness of @xmath43 and the proportionality between @xmath43 and @xmath1 was also confirmed and stressed as an important characteristic of various exotic superconductors by uemura _",
    "_ et al.__@xcite .",
    "the proposed `` universal '' relation between @xmath1 and muon relaxation rate was later reinterpreted by ek as an upper bound of @xmath1 given by the phase - order temperature@xcite .",
    "all the abovementioned features of the phase - fluctuation model are actually observed in the @xmath0he - gelsil system we studied . as is shown in figs .",
    "[ crhos ] and [ coefficient ] , the @xmath2-linear behavior in @xmath43 becomes prominent at pressures higher than 2.3 mpa .",
    "this behavior strongly suggests the existence of classical phase fluctuations which dominates the normal fluid component .",
    "it is also noted that the overall shape of the @xmath15 curve bears striking resemblance to the superfluid density of measured in cuprates and the calculated one in the 3d xy model@xcite .",
    "moreover , a plot of @xmath1 versus @xmath43 ( the so - called uemura plot@xcite ) in fig .",
    "[ tc_df ] clearly have tendencies that at @xmath45 mpa @xmath43 becomes small and approximately proportional to @xmath1 .",
    "the emergence of @xmath2-linear term in @xmath43 correlates to the change in the slope of @xmath46 curve .",
    "the accuracy in the determination of @xmath2-linear coefficient and @xmath46 relation near @xmath10 are degraded in our current torsional oscillator measurement because of the small @xmath43 ( small signal - to - noise ratio ) and the coupling of oscillation to fourth sound .",
    "measurements of @xmath43 by other techniques such as fourth sound resonance method will be essential .",
    "superfluid transition temperature @xmath1 of pressurized liquid as a function of the frequency shift @xmath13 at 10 mk .",
    "this plot corresponds to the uemura plot for unconventional superconductors@xcite.,height=245 ]    the idea of lbec gives a new perspective to a number of experimental studies of @xmath0he in restricted geometries .",
    "the detailed torsional oscillator and specific heat studies by reppy and coworkers@xcite shows that the superfluid transition occurs at slightly lower temperature than the temperature of the broad specific heat peak . at superfluid @xmath1 ,",
    "an extremely small peak is additionally observed . as well as in the gelsil case ,",
    "the broad peak is attributed to the formation of lbecs and the macroscopic superfluid transition occur at @xmath1 . the lbec picture in the @xmath0he - vycor system is also supported by the neutron and ultrasound experiment conducted by glyde , mulders and coworkers , in which the roton signals are observed above @xmath1 determined by ultrasound .",
    "thus , the `` separation '' of bec and superfluid transition should be a universal characteristic of @xmath0he in nanoporous media .    the @xmath2-linear superfluid density was observed in @xmath0he filled in packed powders@xcite and in 2.5-nm gelsil@xcite at ambient pressures . in these studies",
    "the @xmath2-linear behavior was attributed to the effect of `` zero - dimensional '' ( 0d ) phonons . however , the 0d phonons in the 3d connected nanopores are hard to imagine .",
    "it is rather reasonable to interpret as the effect of phase fluctuations .",
    "then a question arises : why is the @xmath2-linear behavior much more prominent in packed powder and mt s gelsil than ours ?",
    "it is conjectured that difference in pore structure influence the boson localization and thus the phase fluctuations .",
    "further studies including detailed characterization of porous materials are obviously intriguing .",
    "in summary , we have determined the anomalous phase diagram of @xmath0he confined in the 2.5-nm gelsil nanopores .",
    "it is ultimately proven by torsional oscillator and heat capacity studies that bec and superfluidity take place at separate temperatures .",
    "key physics to understand the phase diagram and superfluid properties is localization of bose - einstein condensates caused by confinement or disorder",
    ". striking similarity to the superfluid behavior in high-@xmath1 cuprates may also be an important clue to elucidate the mechanism of quantum phase transition .",
    "the entire phase diagram will be understood basically in terms of the phase fluctuation model that was proposed by emery and kivelson in the interpretation of phase diagrams of high-@xmath1 cuprates .",
