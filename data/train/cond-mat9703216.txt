    "transport through small quantum dots has attracted considerable interest over the last couple of years .",
    "these quantum dots , small structures formed in a two - dimensional electron gas by applying appropriate gate voltages , are characterized by small capacitances to the substrate and to the leads connecting them to external voltage sources .",
    "hence there is a sizeable charging energy @xmath0 that has to be provided if electrons are to tunnel from the leads to the dot .",
    "transport is blocked at small voltages , a phenomenon dubbed the _ coulomb blockade _ since it is a direct consequence of the coulomb interaction and the geometry of the dot .",
    "another aspect that comes up for semiconductor quantum dots as opposed to small metallic islands is their discrete single - particle spectrum caused by size quantization .",
    "many aspects of the coulomb blockade are now well understood .",
    "recently , a new issue has come up , viz .",
    ", time - dependent transport through small quantum dots .",
    "high - frequency ac voltages can be applied to mesoscopic structures ( e.g. , in the form of microwaves ) .",
    "they lead to photon - assisted tunneling , i.e. , electrons can overcome the coulomb blockade by absorbing photons from the external field .",
    "this has become a very active area recently both experimentally @xcite and theoretically @xcite .    in this work",
    ", we will study transport through an ultrasmall quantum dot with discrete energy levels to which a time - dependent field is applied .",
    "the electron interaction in the dots is taken into account by the coulomb blockade model .",
    "the dots are weakly coupled to source and drain reservoirs by tunnel junctions .",
    "time - dependent gate voltages lead to photon - assisted tunneling .",
    "in contrast to earlier theoretical work @xcite we also take into account transitions between discrete energy levels of the dot .",
    "in addition , we propose a novel electron pump consisting of two serially coupled single - level quantum dots strongly coupled by time - dependent fields .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section [ model ] we introduce the hamiltonian of a single interacting quantum dot with a time - dependent field , connected by tunnel junctions to source and drain reservoirs .",
    "we discuss the model and its solution by introducing a generalized version of the rotating - wave approximation ( rwa ) . in the following section , we describe briefly the master equation technique we use to calculate the transport current . in this paper , the tunneling is always taken into account by performing a first - order perturbation expansion in the tunneling matrix element .",
    "this is equivalent to consider sequential tunneling , assuming the dot to be weakly coupled to the reservoirs such that higher - order tunneling processes can be neglected . in section [ twolevel ]",
    "we describe the case of a dot with two discrete energy levels , which can be solved analytically .",
    "our results for the current are presented in section [ results ] and compared with recent experiments @xcite .    in section [ floquet ]",
    "we present a double - dot electron pump , which uses a time - dependent interdot barrier as the pumping mechanism .",
    "we use the floquet - matrix technique to find a numerical solution to the problem , valid even in situations in which the rwa is not applicable .",
    "as a model for an interacting quantum dot in a time - dependent periodic field coupled to two reservoirs by tunnel junctions we will use the time - dependent hamiltonian . here",

    "the energies @xmath7 include a time - dependent shift of the fermi energy of the electrons in the leads due to the applied periodic field , and @xmath8 denotes its coupling strength to the reservoir @xmath6 .",
    "the hamiltonian for the interacting electrons in the dot is given by @xmath9 where @xmath10 create / annihilate electrons with spin @xmath5 occupying level @xmath11 of the discrete , equidistant energy levels with level spacing @xmath12 in the dot ( @xmath13 for a quantum dot with @xmath14 levels ) .",

    "the tunneling part is given by @xmath30 where @xmath31 denotes the tunneling matrix element .    the time - dependent schrdinger equation ( @xmath32 ) @xmath33 can not be solved in a closed form due to the time - dependent off - diagonal matrix elements @xmath34 in eq .",
    "( [ hdot ] ) . for @xmath35",
    "one can approximate @xmath34 by @xmath36 this is equivalent to omitting rapidly oscillating terms of frequency @xmath37 , which is much larger than @xmath38 as long as ( [ cond ] ) is fulfilled .",
    "this can be understood as a generalization of the rotating - wave approximation , which is well - known in the theory of time - dependent two - level systems ( e.g. , in nuclear magnetic resonance @xcite or quantum optics @xcite ) .",

    "this leads to a master equation for the occupation probabilities @xcite @xmath67 of the occupation number states @xmath68 .",
    "the states @xmath68 represent the occupation numbers of the energy levels of the diagonalized system . in the time - averaged dc - case",

    "however , to really understand the resulting i - v - curves , it is helpful to have a closer look at the analytically solvable case with only two energy levels in the dot .",
    "the matrix ( [ hmatrix ] ) reduces to @xmath77 with @xmath78 .",
    "the transformation that renders the non - diagonal elements time - independent is given by @xmath79 applying @xmath80 to the schrdinger equation leads to @xmath81 calculating @xmath82 and the new energies @xmath83 is now straightforward , they are given by @xmath84 where @xmath85 is the rabi frequency and @xmath86 . after calculating @xmath82",
    "we can write down the creation / annihilation operators @xmath61 for an electron that occupies energy level @xmath87 ( @xmath88 ) as well as the corresponding time - dependent tunneling matrix elements @xmath89 . defining the quantity @xmath90 for @xmath91",

    "it turns out that there are two possible ways for an electron to tunnel through the dot , corresponding to the two terms with @xmath94 in the tunneling matrix elements ( fig .",
    "[ fig : dot_two ] ) .",
    "the transport peaks present in the absence of a time - dependent field are split in a two - peak group ( with peaks at distance @xmath95 ) that also shifts its position due to the @xmath96-dependence of the energies @xmath83 .",
    "for a dot with two spin - degenerate levels four groups of current peaks will appear in the i - v - curve , separated from each other by @xmath97 .",
    "if the field - induced inner transitions between the levels are neglected ( all @xmath98 ) , there is one main peak per group accompanied by bessel - type sidebands at separations @xmath99 ( with @xmath100 ) .",
    "these side peaks are due to photon - assisted tunneling ( pat ) @xcite .",
    "the existence of these side peaks has been recently verified experimentally @xcite .",
    "if inner transitions are taken into account , our calculations show that the single main peak will shift with increasing @xmath101 .",
    "in addition , @xmath102 peaks will appear at distances @xmath99 ( with @xmath103 ) , see also fig .",
    "[ fig : dot_two ] .",
    "this leads to a totally different picture of the current - peak positions and heights , the weight of the peaks shifts as well as their positions .    to visualize only the influence of inner transitions , we set @xmath104 , i.e",
    ", there is no pat , and plot the peak group corresponding to a dot occupied by one additional electron as a function of the increasing strength of the inner transitions ( increasing @xmath101 ) .",
    "two cases , one with two and one with three degenerate energy levels are shown ( fig .",
    "[ fig : peaks ] ) .",
    "the shift of the main peak and the appearance of the one ( two ) additional peak(s ) as described above is clearly visible .",
    "of course it is also possible to include the inner transitions in the master equation in a perturbative way . to do this",
    ", transition rates between the levels ( similar to those describing the tunneling of electrons to and from the dot ) have to be calculated in first - order perturbation theory .",
    "then the peaks do not shift with increasing @xmath101 , because the master equation is written in the basis of the unperturbed states .",
    "but also the effect on the peak heights is significantly smaller than in our modified rotating - wave approximation approach . in fig .",
    "[ fig : vgl ] this is illustrated by plotting again the peak group for a dot with two levels and one extra electron .",
    "again we set @xmath104 , i.e. , neglecting pat .",
    "for a fixed , relatively small value of @xmath96 , the peak shift is not significant .    in recent transport measurements on ultrasmall",
    "quantum dots with applied microwaves such a peak group was studied @xcite .",
    "a dot with two levels contributing to transport was used .",
    "the first side peak rises more strongly with increasing microwave power than expected from the pat model . in fig .",
    "[ fig : messung ] we compare the measured i - v - curves with our results . for small values of @xmath96 our model is in good agreement with the experiment for both microwave frequencies .",
    "in particular it describes correctly the strong increase of the right side peak .",
    "the numerical calculations have been done using non - degenerate levels because in the experiments a strong magnetic field ( @xmath105 ) ( which was supposed to suppress plasmon excitations ) lifted the spin degeneracy .",
    "the single quantum dot with two discrete energy levels connected by a matrix element @xmath106 can be mapped to a double dot system where two dots with one energy level are strongly coupled with each other .",
    "but in the formalism discussed above it would not be possible in this case to choose the gate voltages and the microwave frequency arbitrarily , due to the restrictions imposed by the rotating - wave approximation .",
    "also , the time - dependence of the two gate voltages would have to be the same for both dots .    in this section",
    "we discuss a double dot system with time - dependent gate voltages that differ by a relative phase @xmath107 .",
    "the dots are strongly coupled by a time - dependent tunneling barrier .",
    "such a system connected to reservoirs as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ddot ] can work as a electron pump , resulting in a current even if no transport voltage is applied .",
    "we generalize the work of stafford and wingreen@xcite to the case where the height of the tunneling barrier also depends on time .",
    "the time - dependent schrdinger equation is solved by the floquet - matrix approach@xcite . in general , according to floquet s theorem , a differential equation with periodic coefficients like equation ( [ schrgl ] ) has solutions of the form ( for a dot with @xmath14 levels ) @xcite @xmath108 ) result in an eigenvalue problem for the states @xmath109 @xmath110 the states @xmath109 have the same periodicity as the dot hamiltonian , i.e. , @xmath111 . due to this",

    "it is now possible to transform the tunneling hamiltonian and calculate the current by the master equation technique analogous to the previous sections .",

    "figure [ fig : pumpe ] illustrates the situation where the microwaves couple only to the interdot barrier .",
    "there are current peaks if the photon energy equals an integer fraction of the quasi - energy level splitting . because the quasi - energies themselves depend on the amplitude @xmath96 ( analogous to the rwa calculations above ) , the current peaks shift to higher photon energies with increasing @xmath96 .",
    "this plot illustrates the effect created purely by a time - dependent barrier .",
    "however , in a real experiment the microwaves would also couple to the gate electrodes and the interdot coupling would have a finite time - independent part , i.e. , @xmath135 .",
