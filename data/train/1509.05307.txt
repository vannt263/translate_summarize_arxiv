    "quantum information protocols , such as quantum teleportation , quantum cryptography or quantum key distribution @xcite , rely on faithful transmission of quantum information between several parties .",
    "however , in any practical scenario , during the transmission , errors take place .",
    "the influence of the errors in a quantum information context is described via the theory of noisy quantum channels @xcite .",
    "quantum channels describing the noise during transmission of information are often described as \" black box  input - output systems . however , in practice , an interaction with a quantum environment generates the noise @xcite giving rise to a continuous family of channels instead of just one input - output system .",
    "then , the interaction time ( or channel length ) influences strongly the properties of the channel .",
    "the conventional wisdom is that the noise is harmful for all quantum protocols and isolation from the surroundings is necessary for harnessing the quantum properties .",
    "however , recent work has shown , how adding even more noise to the system can actually be beneficial in certain cases @xcite .",
    "quantum information protocols , such as entanglement swapping , distillation , quantum teleportation , and quantum key distribution have been shown to benefit from correlated noise , when non - markovian features are present .    in recent years",
    "there has been rapid progress both in theory and experimental control of non - markovian open quantum systems @xcite .",
    "further , first theoretical proposals for exploiting non - markovianity for quantum information processing and metrology exist @xcite .",
    "however , many questions related to the proper quantification of non - markovianity @xcite and to the exploitation of memory effects as a quantum resource still remain elusive .",
    "especially , the additivity properties of the various non - markovian measures remain largely unknown @xcite .",
    "the main question in this paper is the following : how , in a practical example , do the different measures describe the dynamics of resources for quantum information tasks ? here we study the case of two independent qubit channels .",
    "we first study the non - markovianity properties of the global channel via two suggested measures for non - markovian dynamics and then consider an application in superdense coding @xcite ; one of the best known examples of using entanglement for quantum information processing purposes .",
    "since the experimental platforms for studying quantum systems allow sophisticated engineering schemes , the importance of non - markovian processes in open quantum systems has become crucial leading to a vast development towards a general consistent theory of memory effects in quantum dynamics .",
    "this has led to an active discussion on the proper definition and quantification of non - markovian effects in recent years @xcite . here ,",
    "we study two information theoretically motivated measures for non - markovian dynamics and see how well they capture the influence of environment engineering in the performance of superdense coding protocol .",
    "dynamics of open quantum systems influenced by noise , are described with a family of completely positive , trace preserving ( cptp ) maps , denoted @xmath0 .",
    "each member @xmath1 of the family is a cptp map that evolves an input state @xmath2 from time zero to an output state @xmath3 at time @xmath4 .",
    "we study the case where two qubits are subjected to independent and uncorrelated dephasing channels which can be tuned to exhibit both markovian and non - markovian dynamics .",
    "this type of dynamics can be experimentally realised with a high degree of environment engineering and further , the model allows to analytically treat most of the non - markovianity measures .    in matrix form",
    ", the evolution of the density matrix of our bipartite system of interest , @xmath5 , can be written as    @xmath6    where @xmath7 are the complex valued decoherence functions having absolute values between 0 and 1 .",
    "their time dependence dictates the properties of the quantum channel completely .",
    "the terms containing products of the @xmath8 coefficients reflect the fact that the local channels are independent . for general ,",
    "possibly correlated , channels these products should be replaced with more general functions , containing information about the correlations @xcite .",
    "equivalently , the independence of the local channels means that the dynamical map of the total system is a tensor product of local dynamical maps : @xmath9 .",
    "this property is useful in studying the non - markovian properties of the channel and qualitatively comparing the two different measures we are interested in .",
    "the explicit form of the decoherence functions is not relevant for studying the behaviour qualitatively and is therefore presented in more detail in sec .",
    "[ sdc ] .",
    "recently , a non - markovianity measure based on monitoring the monotonicity of the quantum channel capacity @xmath10 was introduced by bylicka , chruscinski and maniscalco ( bcm ) @xcite .",
    "the quantum capacity measures the ability of a quantum channel to reliably transmit information .",
    "for degradable channels , as the dephasing channels considered in this paper , @xmath10 is defined in terms of the coherent information as follows @xmath11 then based on @xmath10 , the measure is defined as @xmath12 the measure monitors and adds up the possible temporary increases in the capacity @xmath10 to get a value such that any channel which has @xmath13 is defined to be non - markovian . in this work we will not calculate explicit values for the measure but only use the fact that as long as the capacity @xmath10 is non - monotonic , the channel will be non - markovian in the sense of the bcm measure .    using the method from @xcite , @xmath14 of the channel considered in our work can be written as @xmath15 - h_2\\bigg[\\dfrac{1 + \\vert \\kappa_2(t)\\vert}{2}\\bigg],\\ ] ] where @xmath16 is the binary entropy function .",
    "for uncorrelated local dephasing channels , the bipartite quantum channel capacity is additive : @xmath17 . using this result and choosing",
    "as examples five different combinations of local dephasing channels , as listed in table  [ locglob ] , we see different types of behavior for the global channel .",
    "the table also contains the parameters @xmath18 and @xmath19 related to the experimental realisation of the markovian and non - local channels in the photonics set - up ( see sec .",
    "[ sdc ] ) .",
    "the behavior of the capacities in the photonic realization is plotted in fig .  [ qcaps ] .",
    "the additivity property in tells directly that combination of any two local markovian dephasing channels always leads to a markovian global channel .",
    "it also implies that using identical non - markovian dephasing channels on both alice s and bob s side always leads to a global non - markovian channel .",
    "however , we can also combine a markovian and a non - markovian channel to get both markovian and a non - markovian global channel .",
    "it is also possible to combine two different non - markovian channels to get a markovian global channel in sense of the bcm measure .",
    "[ combs ]    .summary of different kinds of behaviors for the global channel with different parameter values .",
    "here m. stands for markovian in the sense of bcm measure . in the last case marked with * we have re - scaled the time parameter @xmath4 to @xmath20 on bob s side to get the oscillations of the decoherence functions out of phase",
    ". this amounts to changing the birefringence on bob s side , as seen in the photonic implementation in sec .",

    "the operator describing the evolution of the total system for a given encoding operator @xmath23 takes the form @xmath24 we assume that alice and bob can control the interaction times of their local noises . for the following analytical calculations we assume that @xmath25 , i.e. , all the four noises have the same duration and the total interaction times in alice s and bob s side are equal to @xmath4 . later on , we also present results when there is no noise on bob s side and for the case when the only noise is that of alice after her encoding .",
    "when all four interactions are on , we can now calculate how the initial state of the total closed system evolves when using different @xmath26 .",
    "tracing out the environmental degrees of freedom gives the following open system states with different encoding operations @xmath27 where @xmath28 and the subindex of @xmath29 specifies which @xmath30 was used to evolve the initial state ( [ init ] ) .",
    "alice and bob can freely choose the form of @xmath31 in the experimental realization .",
    "we are interested in the case of independent noise channels , which means that the joint frequency distribution @xmath32 is a product distribution @xmath33 suppose they agree on using a product of two double - peaked gaussian distributions .",
    "the peaks of the gaussians are centered at @xmath34 and @xmath35 . using this we can evaluate the integrals as @xcite @xmath36 where @xmath37",
    ", @xmath38 is the width of the peaks and @xmath39 is the relation of the amplitudes of frequency peaks of photon @xmath40 . by manipulating @xmath41",
    "we can control whether the local environment is markovian or non - markovian @xcite .    by choosing the complex functions used in unitary coding as @xmath42 we see that the decoherence functions @xmath43 and @xmath44 become real valued . using these choices ,",
    "the final states that bob obtains before his measurement become @xmath45 before going further , we introduce tools for quantifying the performance of the two - qubit channel in the superdense coding protocol .",
    "mutual information measures correlations between two random variables @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "basically it tells how much one can deduce from @xmath47 by knowing @xmath46 . in this sense , it is a natural measure to quantify the success of a messaging protocol where alice wants to send a message to bob .    for two discrete random variables @xmath46 and @xmath47 with the joint distribution @xmath48 and marginal distributions @xmath49 and @xmath50 , the classical mutual information is defined as @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the shannon entropy . by using the definition of shannon entropy and the relation @xmath53 we see that @xmath54    now let @xmath46 be the set of messages used by alice and @xmath47 the set used by bob .",
    "then @xmath49 is the probability that alice sends the message @xmath55 and @xmath50 is the probability that bob receives the message @xmath56 .",
    "@xmath57 is the conditional probability of bob receiving message @xmath56 given that alice sent message @xmath55 . in the superdense coding protocol the conditional probabilities can be calculated as @xmath58,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath59 is the state that alice encodes the message @xmath55 to and @xmath60 is the povm element representing the measurement outcome associated to the message @xmath56 by bob . for simplicity",
    "we assume a uniform distribution on alice s messages , which means that @xmath61 .      by using the reduced density matrices",
    "@xmath62 defined in eq .",
    "( [ statesbm ] ) we can obtain the conditional probabilities @xmath57 of eq . and then calculate the mutual information . for example , the conditional probability of bob getting the incorrect result @xmath63 when alice has performed the encoding @xmath64 is @xmath65 \\\\ \\nonumber & = \\frac{1-\\vert h(t)\\vert}{2}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in a similar way one calculates also the other conditional probabilities . combining these with the known probabilities @xmath66 we get for the mutual information @xmath67 + h_2\\bigg[\\frac{1+\\vert h(t ) \\vert}{2}\\bigg ] \\bigg{\\}}. \\label{mutu2qubit}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    interestingly , the time - dependent mutual information in is almost the same as the quantum channel capacity calculated in . in the following , we examine different possibilities for dynamics of mutual information by plugging different noise configurations of local dephasing channels into .",
    "it is easy to see that if @xmath68 and @xmath69 are monotonic , so is the mutual information . on the other hand",
    "if @xmath68 and @xmath70 both have recoveries at the same time intervals @xmath71 , then also the mutual information has recoveries at the same intervals .",
    "figure  [ qmutus ] shows the behavior of mutual information for four different noise configurations .",
    "we use fixed parameter values of @xmath72 hz , @xmath73 hz and @xmath74 .",
    "two different local channels are used , markovian and non - markovian with respect to both blp and bcm measure .",
    "the markovian one corresponds to the choice of parameter @xmath75 and the non - markovian one to @xmath76 .        figure  [ qmutus ] ( a ) compares the dynamics of mutual information between markovian and non - markovian cases when there is noise only in alice s side after her encoding .",
    "as expected , memory - effects revive the mutual information temporarily and finally the value approaches the classical limit equal to 1 in both cases .",
    "however , when we add noise also before alice s encoding on her side , this improves the situation both for markovian and non - markovian cases , see fig .",
    "[ qmutus ] ( b ) .",
    "in addition of the slower decrease of mutual information and revivals , it is very interesting to notice that the asymptotic values approach now 1.5 which is significantly higher than the classical limit 1 . when there is no noise in bob s side and the duration of the noise is equal before and after alice s encoding , then @xmath77 , and eq .",
    "shows that two states @xmath78 and @xmath79 fully recover their quantum features by an echo mechanism .",
    "states @xmath80 and @xmath81 , which depend on @xmath82 , eventually fully dephase .",
    "this leaves us three distinguishable cases with four encoding operations , and subsequently the value of mutual information remains higher than the classical limit , and at the same time below the value @xmath83 if only three encoding operations were used .",
    "figure  [ qmutus ] ( c ) shows the results for the case having the same markovian or non - markovian noise on both sides of alice and bob . here",
    ", the behaviour is very similar to fig .",
    "[ qmutus ] ( a ) .",
    "the difference is quite obvious with stronger reduction and smaller revival of mutual information since added identical noise to bob s side .",
    "the situation is more interesting when the noise applied in the two sides is different .",
    "figure  [ qmutus ] ( d ) shows the results when alice has markovian and bob non - markovian noise or viceversa . here ,",
    "the values of mutual information are higher when the non - markovian noise acts on alice s side instead of bob s side .",
    "we conclude that the combination of alice s encoding operation with subsequent echo mechanism for two of the states and the non - markovian character of her local channel is more efficient for sdc coding than placing the non - markovian channel to bob s side .",
    "in this paper we have studied the capability of two non - markovianity measures in quantifying memory effects for two independent dephasing channels .",
    "the results for the bcm measure show that having at least one local non - markovian channel can lead to both markovian and non - markovian global channel .",
    "in contrast , the blp measure always detects the local non - markovian behavior of the global map in the case of independent channels .",
    "it thus turns out that the bcm measure better captures the usefulness of the channel structure in transmitting information in the sdc protocol for the considered cases .",
    "we have further studied various dephasing noise configurations to optimize the information transmission .",
    "the results show that when noise affects only alice s side , it is beneficial if it is present both before and after her encoding . in this case , the asymptotic limit of mutual information is significantly higher than the classical limit .",
    "moreover , when noise is present in both alice s and bob s side  one of them being markovian and other one non - markovian  it is more useful for information transmission in sdc protocol to have non - markovian channel on alice s side .",
    "our results help in understanding how reservoir engineering and memory effects can be used to improve various quantum information based protocols ."
