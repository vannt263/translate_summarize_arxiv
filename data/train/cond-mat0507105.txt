    "the occurrence of superconductivity in compounds without inversion symmetry is an issue that has surfaced recently.@xcite although there seems to be very few compounds without a center of inversion which display robust superconductivity , a look at basic bcs theory reveals no severe obstruction to pairing , as long as there is no ferromagnetism , because time - reversal invariance ( i.e. , lack of magnetism ) is sufficient to guarantee inversion symmetry in the fermi surface ( @xmath12=@xmath13 ) , therefore allowing zero momentum ( @xmath14 ) pairing .",
    "ferromagnetism splits the spin ( @xmath15 ) degeneracy , restricting @xmath14 pairing to triplet pairs .",
    "if inversion symmetry is lost , however , spin - orbit coupling ( soc ) removes the spin degeneracy@xcite so that @xmath14 pairing may be very sensitive to magnetism ( including applied magnetic fields).@xcite    the lack of inversion symmetry has been suggested as a factor in the absence of superconductivity in mnsi@xcite ; there are however other peculiar aspects of the space group ( and resulting band structure)@xcite that hamper elucidation of the effects of lack of inversion .",
    "very recently a few examples of superconductivity in crystalline materials without inversion symmetry have been reported .",
    "cept@xmath1si , with a crystal structure that is not close to any structure with inversion , has been found to be superconducting at t@xmath16 = 0.75 k.@xcite the properties of this system are complicated due to its heavy fermion nature .",
    "soc effects might be expected to cause complications@xcite ( due to the cerium ) and the fact that superconductivity arises within the antiferromagnetic phase ( t@xmath17 = 2.2 k ) with enforced spin degeneracy may be relevant . pressure induced superconductivity at p@xmath16 = @xmath18 gpa and very low t@xmath16 = 0.14 k has been observed in uir.@xcite electrons in uir will experience strong soc , however the crystal structure is only a small distortion away from one with inversion , so the effects of lack of inversion can only be determined by direct calculation .",
    "recently li@xmath0pd@xmath1b with a cubic but peculiar crystal structure without inversion symmetry has been discovered to be a t@xmath16 = 8 k superconductor by togano and coworkers.@xcite it has an upper critical field h@xmath19 = 4 t , and the ginzburg - landau parameter @xmath20 = 21 , marking it as a strongly type - ii superconductor.@xcite although there has been a suggestion@xcite the superconductivity is dominated by strong electronic correlations related to three kinds of the pd - pd bond length,@xcite experimental data is readily interpreted without any need for invoking correlation effects.@xcite moreover , the density of states presented by chandra _",
    "indicates that the pd @xmath4 bands are essentially completely filled,@xcite leaving no reasonable expectation of correlation effects on the pd site .",
    "the entire alloy system li@xmath0b(pd@xmath21pt@xmath22)@xmath1 has been studied , and it was found@xcite that t@xmath16 decreases almost linearly from 8 k ( pd end ) to 2.8 k ( pt end ) . since the volume is unchanged ( the lattice constant of li@xmath0pt@xmath1b is 0.03% larger )",
    ", the difference is due to ( 1 ) the slightly different chemistry of pt , ( 2 ) the mass difference , or ( 3 ) the effect of stronger soc combined with the lack of inversion symmetry of this lattice .",
    "interpreted as an isotope shift @xmath23= @xmath24d(log t@xmath16)/d(log m ) leads to @xmath23 greater than unity , although changes in both t@xmath16 and the mass m are too large for the differential definition of @xmath23 to be realistic .",
    "the li@xmath0pd@xmath1b structure has been described as a three - dimensionally distorted antiperovskite,@xcite characterized by strongly distorted corner - sharing bpd@xmath25 octahedra . thus on",
    "the local structural level li@xmath0pd@xmath1b appears to have similarity to mgcni@xmath1,@xcite which is also an 8 k superconductor and has a similar valence balance ( one more valence electron per formula unit ) .",
    "the lack of inversion symmetry is however only one aspect of the strong difference between the structures of li@xmath0pd@xmath1b and mgcni@xmath1 .",
    "the structure and space group are discussed in some detail in sec .",
    "there are several pd and pt based ( anti)perovskite compounds@xcite that may be more strongly related to li@xmath0pd@xmath1b , but they have not been studied nearly so thoroughly .    in this paper , we investigate in detail the electronic structure of li@xmath0pd@xmath1b and its relation to the local bonding and to the global symmetry of the crystal structure .",
    "we also begin some investigation into the lattice dynamics and electron - phonon coupling by studying the symmetric vibration of the li and pd atoms .",
    "we obtain rough estimates of the contribution of li and pd motions to electron - phonon coupling strength , and obtain a plausible case that pd motion is the primary driver of superconductivity .",
    "our calculations were based on the experimentally reported structure@xcite ( cubic @xmath264@xmath132 , no .",
    "212 ) , containing four formula units per primitive cubic cell , using the lattice constant 6.7436     obtained by togano _ et al._@xcite the peculiarity of the structure is already evident at a basic level : the simple cube cell contains _ four _ bpd@xmath25 octahedra .",
    "this is not possible by simply enlarging the cubic perovskite cell , as its cubic supercells contain 8 , 27 , ...",
    "@xmath27 octahedra for a @xmath28 supercell .",
    "thus the _ topology _ of the bpd@xmath25 octahedra network is distinct from a perovskite such as mgcni@xmath1 .",
    "this space group consists of a threefold axis without any associated nonprimitive translation ; all other rotations are paired with a ( @xmath29,0 ) , ( @xmath30 ) , or ( @xmath31 ) type translation .",
    "lack of inversion leaves 24 operations in the point group .",
    ".significant interatomic distances ( in  ) after relaxation . compared with the experimentally reported value,@xcite ( @xmath32 ) and ( @xmath33 ) indicate increase and decrease , respectively .",
    "note that all b - pd nearest neighbor distances are identical .",
    "[ cols= \" < , < \" , ]     [ table2 ]    keeping the space group fixed , we can displace pd along one @xmath34 direction ( its variable internal coordinate ) or ( and ) li along a @xmath35 direction .",
    "figure [ frozen ] shows the energy change for displacement of li and pd separately .",
    "the data can be fit very well by expanding up to 4th order of the displacement , and the region near the equilibrium position is fit quite well with the harmonic approximation .",
    "the fitted constants are given in table [ table2 ] . by displacing li and pd simultaneously ,",
    "the two a@xmath36 phonon frequencies and eigenvectors can be determined .",
    "considering only the harmonic term , the two frequencies are @xmath37=40.6 mev ( 96% from li and 4% from pd ) and @xmath38=13.0 mev ( almost 50% from the each type of atom ) .",
    "clearly @xmath38 shows much more coupling effect , 13% softening , whereas @xmath37 has nearly negligible coupling , consistent with the character of the phonon eigenvectors .",
    "the value of @xmath37 is almost exactly equal to the experimentally reported maximum value of li metal,@xcite whereas @xmath38 is much softer than the 30 mev maximum for pd metal.@xcite      a deformation potential @xmath8 is defined as an energy shift with respect to ( periodic ) atomic displacement .",
    "figure [ d ] displays the strong @xmath39 variation of the deformation potential for selected bands at e@xmath40 with respect to pd motion along the @xmath34 direction .",
    "the value is large near the @xmath6 and r points but smaller near the m and x points , reflecting the strong variation of the pd character around the fermi surface .",
    "the variation of pd / b character is pictured in the fatband representations given in fig .",
    "[ fat ] , but the deformation potential may not be simply related to the amount of pd character .",
    "the averaged potential @xmath41 for these points , and its variance , is 1.15(@xmath42 ) ev /  , a value indicating significant pd contribution to electron - phonon coupling , as we show below . the maximum value of about 4 ev",
    "/ =3.4 @xmath41 occurs for the flat band lying just below e@xmath40 at the @xmath6 point ( not shown in fig .",
    "[ d ] ) , whereas the other flat band at the x point has a value only comparable with @xmath41 .    for a physical feeling for the magnitude of the coupling , note that the flat band at the @xmath6 point with large deformation potential crosses e@xmath40 when pd is displaced by about @xmath43   , while at the x point it requires a displacement of @xmath44    from the relaxed position .",
    "b @xmath45 character at e@xmath40 is consistent with the @xmath46 nmr data of nishiyama and coworkers.@xcite unlike pd , the li deformation potential is small ( by an order of magnitude ) @xmath9= 0.11(@xmath47 ) ev /  , with the maximum value of 0.27 ev /    occurring at the @xmath6 point . the contribution of the deformation potentials to the electron - phonon coupling constant can be measured by the quantity @xmath48=n(0)@xmath49/@xmath50@xmath51 , where @xmath50 is an average mass of mode @xmath52 ( for example , approximately @xmath53 for @xmath37 and a half of @xmath54+@xmath55 for @xmath38 ) . using the mean of the two values of @xmath56 for @xmath57 ,",
    "the ratio of @xmath58 is @xmath59 , clearly indicating that the electron - phonon coupling is mainly from pd contribution .",
    "we have however not assessed possible coupling from the b atom .",
    "the large c isotope coefficient@xcite @xmath60 = 0.54 in mgcni@xmath1 suggests that coupling to b indeed may be important .",
    "we have used the allen - dynes equation@xcite to assess these quantities in relation to the measured t@xmath16 = 8 k. clear conclusions are not possible because for t@xmath16 of 8 k or less , the uncertain value of the effective coulomb repulsion @xmath61 introduces uncertainty .",
    "we concentrate on the value @xmath62 0.7 , which is the specific heat mass enhancement , and this value is also the `` mode @xmath7 '' for the lower frequency a@xmath36 mode . using a representative phonon frequency @xmath63 = 13 mev ( the a@xmath36 mode )",
    ", then @xmath61 = 0.10 gives t@xmath16 = 5.4 k , while @xmath61=0.15 gives t@xmath16 = 3.7 k. increasing @xmath63 to 23 mev , the values become t@xmath16(@xmath61=0.10 ) = 9.6 k , t@xmath16(@xmath61=0.15 ) = 6.0 k. these values indicate that a mean phonon energy of 20 mev with @xmath7 = 0.7 may be necessary to account for t@xmath64 = 8 k.",
    "the decrease of t@xmath16 from 8 k to less than 3 k in the pt analog provides a potentially important clue into the mechanism of superconductivity , so we have looked at the differences in the electronic structure . for li@xmath0pt@xmath1b , we used the experimentally reported structure without relaxation,@xcite since relaxation produced relatively small difference in li@xmath0pd@xmath1b .",
    "the valence orbitals of pt were taken to be @xmath65 , with li and b being treated as before .",
    "the resulting band structure is plotted in fig .",
    "[ band2 ] on the same scale as those of li@xmath0pd@xmath1b in fig .",
    "[ band ] , so direct comparison can be made .",
    "given the same cell volume and the similarity of pd and pt in many respects , it is somewhat surprising that the bands show so much difference .",
    "the fermi level dos actually increases , to 2.9 states / ev per formula unit .",
    "the differences , such as more bands in the region within 1 ev below e@xmath40 , can be traced to the wider bandwidth , which also places more @xmath11 character at e@xmath40 .",
    "the occupied bandwidth is 7.6 ev compared to 6.7 ev in li@xmath0pd@xmath0b ( fig .",
    "[ dos ] ) and the @xmath11 bandwidth ( region of large dos ) is @xmath6615% wider and extends more strongly to e@xmath40 .    the bottom panel of fig .",
    "8 shows the consequence of soc in the pt compound .",
    "splittings near e@xmath40 as large as 200 mev occur , for example , the band below e@xmath40 at the x point .",
    "more generally , the splittings are perhaps on average a factor of two or so larger than for the pd compound .",
    "it can be seen that fourfold degeneracies at the r point survive soc , as do the degeneracies at the m point , while the threefold states at the @xmath6 point are split to doublet plus singlet .",
    "the fplo method , being atomic orbital based , can be used to provide a mulliken decomposition of charges .",
    "while the atomic charges depend somewhat on the choice of orbitals , it is possible that the differences in charges for these two compounds can provide some insight . the mulliken effective charges are , in the li@xmath0pd@xmath1b compound : li , @xmath67 ; pd , @xmath68",
    "; b , @xmath69 ; and for the li@xmath0pt@xmath1b compound : li , @xmath70 ; pt , @xmath71 ; b , @xmath72 .",
    "the main difference is that pt is effectively neutral while pd is noticeably cationic .",
    "these charges do not support the suggestions , discussed earlier , that li is cationic in li@xmath0pd@xmath1b , although it may become somewhat anionic in li@xmath0pt@xmath1b .",
    "considering that the local coordination and the similar valences of the constituents ( li@xmath0 @xmath73 mg , pd @xmath73 ni , b with one less electron than c ) and that both compounds superconduct at the same temperature of 8 k , it is worthwhile to consider whether there is any realistic comparison with mgcni@xmath1 . in both systems",
    "there is a nominal @xmath74 configuration of the transition metal atom , but strong @xmath11 character remains at the fermi surface .",
    "the volume per formula unit is 30% larger in li@xmath0pd@xmath1b , much more than expected from simple ni@xmath75pd replacement and reflecting the more open structure of li@xmath0pd@xmath1b .",
    "moreover , the band structures do not show much resemblance ( the four times larger cell makes comparison difficult , however ) .",
    "the dos of mgcni@xmath1 is dominated by a very high and very narrow peak in the density of states 45 mev below e@xmath40 , derived from a very flat band all around the m point of the brillouin zone . in li@xmath0pd@xmath1b there is no analogous feature ( see fig .",
    "[ band ] ) .",
    "there is a fairly flat band along the m - x line that is cut , and hybridized with , a steeper band , as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fat ] , but there is no corresponding dos peak . the value of n(0 ) is only 45% of that of mgcni@xmath1 ( per formula unit).@xcite the band filling is , of course , one electron higher in li@xmath0pd@xmath1b .",
    "generally , we identify no close relationship between the electronic structures of these two systems , and the differences are substantial . the lack of inversion symmetry and substantial ( large ) spin - orbit coupling in the pd ( respectively , pt ) compound make the electronic structure much richer , with complicated fermi surfaces .",
    "comparison of the calculated n(0 ) with the linear specific heat coefficient leads to a dynamical mass enhancement @xmath76 , which if due to electron - phonon coupling is in the right range to account for t@xmath16 .",
    "one particular pd vibration is calculated to have a mode @xmath7 of this same size .",
    "however , the li a@xmath36 mode is found to be very weakly coupled .",
    "this means that the electron - phonon coupling varies strongly throughout the phonon spectrum , and most likely also across the fermi surface .",
    "the differences between li@xmath0pd@xmath1b and li@xmath0pt@xmath1b are strong enough that the origin of the difference in their values of t@xmath16 is unclear .",
    "strong spin - orbit coupling together with the lack of inversion symmetry , coupled with the observation of a hebel - slichter coherence peak in the spin - lattice relaxation rate , strongly points to conventional rather than exotic pairing , and we have begun to probe electron - phonon coupling in this system .",
    "mgcni@xmath1 has been found to have very strong coupling to certain modes,@xcite if the analogy to this compound is relevant .",
    "if the coupling is primarily to the pd ( pt ) , the difference in masses leads to a decrease by @xmath77 = 0.74 , roughly half of the reduction factor that is needed .",
    "a difference in @xmath7 of only 15% would be required to give the further reduction of t@xmath16 , and the electronic structure is different enough to allow this possibility .",
