    "the prediction of extra dimensions , which the brane - confined standard model is oblivious to , suggests that early enough in the history of the universe a dimensional selection would have taken place , implying the breaking of the lorentz symmetry at the level of the higher dimensional bulk spacetime and the possible generation of a different geometry along the directions orthogonal to the brane .",
    "the breaking of the lorentz symmetry can be realized by spontaneous breaking of a symmetry in the presence of a vector field @xmath0 living in the bulk and subject to a potential @xmath1 the acquisition by the bulk vector field @xmath0 of a non - vanishing vacuum value and the consequent assignment to the bulk vacuum of an intrinsic direction determined by @xmath2 induce the breaking of rotation invariance and thus of lorentz symmetry in the bulk .",
    "the brane , regarded as the locus of the observable universe embedded in the higher dimensional bulk spacetime , would be expected to share a subgroup of the symmetries of the bulk preserved in a manner akin to the goldstone mechanism .",
    "the overly tested lorentz symmetry of the observable universe imposes that the brane must stand as a vacuum solution where the lorentz invariance would be a residual symmetry of the spontaneously broken symmetry @xcite .",
    "the possibility of violation of lorentz invariance has nevertheless been widely discussed in the recent literature ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "spontaneous breaking of lorentz symmetry may arise in the context of string / m - theory due to the existence of non - trivial solutions in string field theory @xcite , in loop quantum gravity @xcite and in noncommutative field theories @xcite , or via the spacetime variation of fundamental couplings @xcite .",
    "lorentz violation modifications of the dispersion relations via five dimensional operators for fermions have also been considered and constrained @xcite .",
    "consequently , this putative breaking will have astrophysical @xcite implications , and in what concerns ultra - high energy cosmic rays , one can establish that lorentz symmetry holds up to about @xmath3 @xcite . the way to relate the breaking of lorentz symmetry to gravity has been considered in ref .",
    "@xcite , and solutions as well as implications have been discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , a connection between the cosmological constant and the violation of lorentz invariance has been conjectured . for a general discussion on the relation between spacetime symmetries and higher dimensions ,",

    "we report on a recent study on how spontaneous lorentz violation in the bulk has repercussions on the brane and how it can be constrained .",
    "we consider a bulk vector field coupled non - minimally to the graviton which , upon acquiring a non - vanishing expectation value in the vacuum , introduces spacetime anisotropies in the gravitational field equations through the coupling with the graviton @xcite .",
    "first we derive the bulk field equations and project them parallel and orthogonal to the brane .",
    "we then establish how to derive brane quantities from bulk quantities by adopting fermi normal coordinates with respect to the directions on the brane and continuing into the bulk using the gauss normal prescription .",
    "finally , we obtain the conditions for the lorentz invariance to be a symmetry on the brane .",

    "it follows that @xmath9 is the @xmath10-dimensional metric induced on the brane by the @xmath11-dimensional bulk metric @xmath12 the induced metric with upper indices is defined by the relation @xmath13 it follows that we can write any bulk tensor field as a linear combination of mutually orthogonal vectors on the brane , @xmath14 and a vector normal to the brane , @xmath15 we illustrate the example of a vector @xmath0 and a tensor @xmath16 bulk fields as follows @xmath17 derivative operators decompose similarly .",
    "we write the derivative operator @xmath18 as @xmath19 fixing a point on the boundary , we introduce coordinates for the neighbourhood choosing them to be fermi normal .",
    "all the christoffel symbols of the metric on the boundary are thus set to zero , although the partial derivatives do not in general vanish .",
    "the non - vanishing connection coefficients are @xmath20 as determined by the gaussian normal prescription for the continuation of the coordinates off the boundary .",

    "is directly coupled to the ricci tensor so that , after the breaking of lorentz invariance , the loss of this symmetry is transmitted to the gravitational sector . we assign a non - vanishing vacuum expectation value first separately to the parallel and orthogonal components of the vector field , finding then that the case where both components attained non - vanishing vacuum expectation values reduced to the previous two cases . the complex interplay between matching conditions and the lorentz symmetry",
    "breaking terms was examined .",
    "we found that lorentz invariance on the brane can be made exact via the dynamics of the graviton , vector field and the extrinsic curvature of the surface of the brane .",
    "as a consequence of the exact reproduction of lorentz symmetry on the brane , we found a condition for the matching of the observed cosmological constant in four dimensions .",
    "this tuning does not follow from a dynamical mechanism but is instead imposed by phenomenological reasons only . from this point of view , both the value of the cosmological constant and the induced brane lorentz symmetry seem to be a consequence of a complex fine tuning .",
