    "power - law distributions taking the form @xmath0 where @xmath1 and @xmath2 are positive constants , are abundant in nature @xcite .",
    "the constant @xmath2 is called the _ exponent _ of the distribution .",
    "examples of such distributions are : _ zipf s law _ , which states that the relative frequency of words in a text is inversely proportional to their rank , _",
    "pareto s law _ , which states that the number of people whose personal income is above a certain level follows a power - law distribution with an exponent between 1.5 and 2 ( pareto s law is also known as the _ 80:20 law _ , stating that about 20% of the population earn 80% of the income ) and _ gutenberg - richter s law _ , which states that over a period of time , the number of earthquakes of a certain magnitude is roughly inversely proportional to the magnitude .",
    "recently , several researchers have detected power - law distributions in the topology of several networks such as the world - wide - web @xcite and author citation graphs @xcite .",
    "the motivation for the current research is two - fold .",
    "first , from a complex network perspective , we would like to understand the stochastic mechanisms that govern the growth of a network .",
    "this has lead to fruitful interdisciplinary research by a mixture of computer scientists , mathematicians , statisticians , physicists , and social scientists @xcite , who are actively involved in investigating various characteristics of complex networks such as the degree distribution of the nodes , the diameter , and the relative sizes of various components .",
    "these researchers have proposed several stochastic models for the evolution of complex networks ; all of these have the common theme of _ preferential attachment_ which results in the `` rich get richer '' phenomenon  for example , where new links to existing nodes are added in proportion to the number of links to these nodes currently present .",
    "an extension of the preferential attachment model , proposed in @xcite , takes into account the ageing of nodes so that a link is connected to an old node , not only preferentially , but also depending on the age of the node : the older the node is the less likely it is that other nodes will be connected to it . it was shown in @xcite that if the ageing function is a power law then the degree distribution has a phase transition from a power - law distribution , when the exponent of the ageing function is less than one , to an exponential distribution , when the exponent is greater than one . a different model of node ageing",
    "was proposed in @xcite with two alternative ageing functions . with the first function",
    "the time a node remains ` active ' , i.e. may acquire new links , decays exponentially , and with the second function a node remains active until it has acquired a maximum number of links .",
    "both functions were shown by simulation to lead to an exponential cutoff in the degree distribution , and for strong enough constraints the distribution appeared to be purely exponential .",
    "another explanation of the cutoff , offered in @xcite , is that when a link is created the author of the link has limited information processing capabilities and thus only considers linking to a fraction of the existing nodes , those that appear to be `` interesting '' .",
    "it was shown by simulation that when the fraction of `` interesting nodes '' is less than one there is a change from a power - law distribution to one that exhibits an exponential cutoff , leading eventually to an exponential distribution when the fraction is much less than one .",
    "second , a motivation for this research is that the viability and efficiency of network algorithmics are affected by the statistical distributions that govern the network s structure .",
    "for example , the discovered power - law distributions in the web have recently found applications in local search strategies in web graphs @xcite , compression of web graphs @xcite and an analysis of the robustness of networks against error and attack @xcite .    despite the generality of the proposed stochastic models for the evolution of complex networks ,",
    "there are still some unexplained phenomena ; these may arise due to the limited size of networks such as protein , e - mail , actor and collaboration networks .",
    "such networks may in fact exhibit an exponential cutoff in the power - law scaling , although this cutoff may only be observable in the tail of the distribution for extremely large networks .",
    "the exponential cutoff is of the form @xmath3 with @xmath4 .",
    "the exponent @xmath2 in ( [ eq : exp - cutoff ] ) will be smaller than the exponent that would be obtained if we tried to fit to the data a power law without a cutoff , like ( [ eq : power - law ] ) . unlike many other models leading to power - law distributions , models with a cutoff can capture situations in which the exponent of the distribution is less than or equal to two , which would otherwise have infinite expectation",
    ".    an exponential cutoff has been observed in protein networks @xcite , in e - mail networks @xcite , in actor networks @xcite , in collaboration networks @xcite , and is apparently also present in the distribution of inlinks in the web graph @xcite , where a cutoff had not previously been observed .",
    "we believe it is likely , in many such cases where power - law distributions have been observed , that better models would be obtained with an exponential cutoff like ( [ eq : exp - cutoff ] ) , with @xmath5 very close to one .",
    "the main aim of this paper is to provide a stochastic evolutionary model for a class of networks like collaboration networks that result in asymptotic power - law distributions with an exponential cutoff .",
    "this model also enables us to explain some phenomena where the exponent is less than or equal to two . as with many of these stochastic growth models , the ideas originated from simon s visionary paper published in 1955 @xcite . at the very beginning of his paper , in equation ( 1.1 ) , simon observed that the class of distribution functions he was about to analyse can be approximated by a distribution like ( [ eq : exp - cutoff ] ) ; he called the term @xmath6 the _ convergence factor _ and suggested that @xmath5 is close to one .",
    "he then went on to present his well - known model that yields power - law distributions like ( [ eq : power - law ] ) , and which has provided the basis for the models rediscovered over 40 years later .",
    "simon gave no explanation for the appearance , in practice , of the convergence factor .    in a previous paper @xcite",
    ", we dealt with a related class of networks that exhibit an exponential cutoff , such as protein interaction networks , in which after a protein is chosen preferentially , say according to the number of other proteins it interacts with , there is a small probability that this protein is discarded from the network .",
    "e - mail networks and the web graph are further examples belonging to this class of network . however , in this paper we consider other networks that behave differently , such as collaboration and actor networks .",
    "consider a collaboration network : after an author is chosen preferentially , according to the number of collaborators he / she currently has , there is a small probability that this author will become inactive , but he / she will not be removed from the network .",
    "inactive authors do not start new collaborations but their existing collaborations still persist in the network .",
    "possible reasons for inactivity may be the finite time window of the data used or because an author retires from collaborative writing .",
    "the rest of the paper is organised as follows . in section  [ sec : urn ]",
    "we present an urn transfer model that extends simon s model by allowing an author , chosen as described above , to sometimes become inactive .",
    "we then derive the steady - state distribution of the model , which , as stated earlier , follows an asymptotic power law with an exponential cutoff like ( [ eq : exp - cutoff ] ) . in section  [ sec : collab - graph ] we demonstrate that our model can provide an explanation of the empirical distributions found in collaboration networks .",
    "finally , in section  [ sec : concluding ] we give our concluding remarks .",
    "we now briefly present an _ urn transfer model _ for a stochastic process that emulates the situation where balls ( which might represent authors ) become inactive with a small probability , but still remain in the system .",
    "we assume that a ball in the @xmath7th urn has @xmath7 pins attached to it ( which might represent the author s collaborations ) .",
    "the model is a variant of our previous model of exponential cutoff @xcite , where balls are discarded with a small probability .",
    "we assume a countable number of ( _ unstarred _ ) urns , @xmath8 and a corresponding set of _ starred _ urns @xmath9 , where the latter contain the inactive balls .",
    "initially all the urns are empty except @xmath10 , which has one ball in it .",
    "let @xmath11 and @xmath12 be the number of balls in @xmath13 and @xmath14 , respectively , at stage @xmath15 of the stochastic process , so @xmath16 , all other @xmath17 and all @xmath18 .",
    "then , at stage @xmath19 of the stochastic process , where @xmath20 , one of two things may occur :    1 .   with probability @xmath21 , @xmath22 , a new ball ( with one pin attached )",
    "is inserted into @xmath10 , or 2 .   with probability @xmath23 an urn",
    "is selected , with @xmath13 being selected with probability proportional to @xmath24 , the number of pins it contains ( or attached to it ) , and a ball is chosen from the selected urn , @xmath13 say ; then , 1 .   with probability @xmath5 , @xmath25 ,",
    "the chosen ball is transferred to @xmath26 , ( this is equivalent to attaching an additional pin to the ball chosen from @xmath13 ) , or 2 .   with probability @xmath27 the ball chosen",
    "is transferred to @xmath14 ( this is equivalent to making the ball inactive ) .    in terms of our model @xcite ,",
    "this means that instead of discarding a ball from @xmath13 , say , the ball is transferred into the corresponding starred urn , @xmath14 .",
    "a ball in a starred urn takes no further part in the stochastic process , i.e. it does not acquire any further pins and so never moves from its urn .",
    "in particular , balls in starred urns have no effect on the preferential choices made during the continuation of the stochastic process .",
    "we could modify the initial conditions so that , for example , @xmath10 initially contained @xmath28 balls instead of one .",
    "it can be shown that any change in the initial conditions will have no effect on the asymptotic distribution of the balls in the urns as @xmath15 tends to infinity , provided the process does not terminate with all of the unstarred urns empty .    in order for this not to occur it is necessary that , on average , more balls are added to the system than become inactive . to ensure this we require @xmath29 , see @xcite . in practice",
    "this condition will nearly always hold , so from now on we assume this .",
    "this condition implies that the probability that the urn transfer process will _ not _ terminate with all the unstarred urns being empty is positive .",
    "more specifically , the probability of non - termination is @xmath30 ; this is just the probability that the gambler s fortune will increase forever @xcite .    following simon @xcite",
    ", we now state the mean - field equations for the urn transfer model .",
    "for @xmath31 we have @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the expected value of @xmath34 given the state of the model at stage @xmath15 , and @xmath35 is the normalising factor .",
    "equation ( [ eq : ss0 ] ) gives the expected number of balls in @xmath13 at stage @xmath19 .",
    "this is equal to the previous number of balls in @xmath13 plus the probability of adding a ball to @xmath13 from @xmath36 in step ( ii)(a ) minus the probability of removing a ball from @xmath13 in step ( ii ) .    in the boundary case , @xmath37 , we have @xmath38 for the expected number of balls in @xmath10 , which is equal to the previous number of balls in the first urn plus the probability of inserting a new ball into @xmath10 in step ( i ) of the stochastic process defined above minus the probability of removing a ball from @xmath10 in step ( ii ) .    for starred urns , for @xmath39 ,",
    "corresponding to ( [ eq : ss0 ] ) and ( [ eq : initial ] ) , we have @xmath40    in order to solve the equations for the model , we make the assumption that , for large @xmath15 , the random variable @xmath41 can be approximated by a constant ( i.e. non - random ) value depending only on @xmath15 .",
    "we do this by replacing the denominator in the definition of @xmath41 by an asymptotic approximation of its expectation .",
    "we observe that approximating @xmath41 in this way is essentially a _",
    "mean - field _",
    "approach @xcite .",
    "let @xmath42 be the expected value of the average number of pins attached to a ball in a starred urn at stage @xmath15 .",
    "we have shown @xcite that @xmath42 is bounded above by @xmath43 , so it is reasonable to make the assumption that @xmath42 tends to a limiting value @xmath44 as @xmath15 tends to infinity .",
    "it is easy to see that the total number of pins attached to the balls in the unstarred urns ( i.e. the active balls ) at stage @xmath15 is asymptotically @xmath45 therefore , letting @xmath46 we see that @xmath47 tends to @xmath48 as @xmath15 tends to infinity .    if we now make the further assumption that @xmath49 then it is possible to show @xcite that the expected value of @xmath11 is asymptotically proportional to @xmath15 , i.e. @xmath50 tends to a limit @xmath51 as @xmath15 tends to infinity .",
    "it similarly follows that @xmath52 tends to a limit @xmath53 .    following the derivation in @xcite , we obtain @xmath54 for @xmath31 , and @xmath55 the solution of these equations is @xmath56 where @xmath57 , @xmath58 is the gamma function @xcite and @xmath59    the asymptotic approximation to @xmath51 , i.e. ( [ eq : ss5 ] ) , in the form corresponding to ( [ eq : exp - cutoff ] ) is obtained using stirling s approximation @xcite .    for the starred urns , corresponding to ( [ eq : ss2 ] ) and ( [ eq : ss1 ] ) , from ( [ eq : star - urn1 ] ) we have , for @xmath39 , @xmath60 thus the ratio of active balls in @xmath13 to inactive balls in @xmath14 is @xmath61    it follows that , for large @xmath7 , the distribution of the balls is dominated by the contents of the starred urns rather than the unstarred urns .",
    "thus the distribution of the total number of balls with @xmath7 pins is given by @xmath62    in the following section we will make use of the equation @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the hypergeometric function @xcite .",
    "this can be derived by using ( [ eq : ss5 ] ) to obtain the sum of @xmath65 for @xmath39 ; this is just the asymptotic value of the total number of pins attached to the balls in the unstarred urns divided by @xmath15 .",
    "however , from ( [ eq : beta ] ) and the discussion preceding it , this sum is also equal to @xmath66 , i.e. @xmath67 , see @xcite for further details .",
    "as a proof of concept we will consider the mathematical research ( mr ) collaboration network for which an exponential cutoff has been reported @xcite . in our model it is assumed that an author enters the network with a single collaboration , which could be interpreted as a `` self - collaboration '' . thereafter , each time an author acquires a new collaborator the corresponding ball is moved along to the next urn with an additional pin attached to it .",
    "there is also a certain probability that an author becomes inactive .",
    "authors who are no longer active still remain part of the network , although they will not be involved in any new collaborations .",
    "we note that collaboration networks , together with some other types of network , like protein and actor networks , are essentially undirected .",
    "so in our model a new collaboration between two authors should be represented by two separate events , one for each author .",
    "this would correspond to taking in pairs the events of attaching a pin to a ball .",
    "we ignore this complication , but note that many of the models proposed , for example for the web graph , similarly ignore the difference between directed and undirected graphs ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "we now examine in detail the degree distribution of the mr collaboration network .",
    "the data for this was supplied to us by jerry grossman at the department of mathematics and statistics in oakland university , rochester @xcite . in order to derive the values for @xmath68 and @xmath5",
    ", we performed a nonlinear regression on a log - log transformation of the degree distribution of the mr collaboration network to fit the equation @xmath69 corresponding to ( [ eq : mixture ] ) , where @xmath70 is a constant .    the results are shown in figure  [ fig : regress ] .",
    "the values of @xmath68 and @xmath5 obtained from the regression of the complete mr data set ( 129 points ) are @xmath71 and @xmath72 .",
    "mathematical research collaboration data , width=453,height=352 ]    we next performed a stochastic simulation to test the validity of our model with respect to the results of the regression on the original data set . in order to use this data for a stochastic simulation of our model , we require the values for @xmath21 and @xmath15 , using @xmath68 and @xmath5 computed from the above regression .",
    "we calculated a value for @xmath15 to use in simulating our stochastic model from : @xmath73    this follows from the formulation of the model , where @xmath74 and @xmath75 stand for the expected numbers of balls at stage @xmath15 in the unstarred and starred urns , respectively .",
    "the right - hand side of ( [ eq : solve - balls ] ) is the limiting value of the left - hand side as @xmath15 tends to infinity .",
    "similarly , from the formulation of the model , we have @xmath76    on using ( [ eq : solve - balls ] ) and ( [ eq : pins - star ] ) , we obtain an alternative equation for @xmath21 , given by @xmath77 where @xmath78 is the branching factor .    from the data we see that the total number of researchers was 253339 , and the total number of collaborations was 992978 . using these values for @xmath79 and @xmath80 , respectively , gives us the branching factor for the original data set as @xmath81 .",
    "we can now obtain the values of @xmath21 and @xmath15 .",
    "computing @xmath21 from ( [ eq : solve - pins2 ] ) gives @xmath82 and from ( [ eq : bf ] ) gives @xmath83 .",
    "using the first value of @xmath21 we obtain the alternative values for @xmath15 from ( [ eq : solve - balls ] ) or ( [ eq : pins - star ] ) as @xmath84 or @xmath85 , respectively , and using the second value of @xmath21 gives us a value of @xmath86 from either ( [ eq : solve - balls ] ) or ( [ eq : pins - star ] ) .",
    "we then carried out 10 simulation runs ( a batch ) of the stochastic process for the three combinations of the values of @xmath87 and @xmath15 .",
    "the results from the three batches are shown in table  [ table : collab1 ] .",
    "for each batch we report the average output values for @xmath79 , @xmath80 and @xmath68 . as a further validation of our methodology , we computed the average number of balls in each urn for each of the three batches , and performed a nonlinear regression , taking into account all urns until an empty one was encountered .",
    "the values of @xmath5 and @xmath68 obtained from this regression are shown in the row following the results for each batch .",
    "for the first batch , it can be seen that the values of @xmath79 and @xmath68 are consistent with the data but the value of @xmath80 is less consistent , since , in this case , we computed @xmath15 from ( [ eq : solve - balls ] ) . for the second batch",
    ", it can be seen that the values of @xmath80 and @xmath68 are consistent with the data but the value of @xmath79 is less consistent , since , in this case , we computed @xmath15 from ( [ eq : pins - star ] ) .",
    "finally , for the third batch , it can be seen that the values of @xmath79 and @xmath88 are consistent with the data but the value of @xmath68 is less consistent , since @xmath21 , computed from ( [ eq : bf ] ) , is less constrained than when it is computed from ( [ eq : solve - pins2 ] ) , which takes @xmath68 into account .",
    "it is also evident that value of @xmath68 computed from the nonlinear regression on the urn values from the simulation is , for all batches , below the value predicted from the simulation .",

    "we have presented an extension of simon s classical stochastic process , which results in a power - law distribution with an exponential cutoff .",
    "when viewing the stochastic process in terms of an urn transfer model , the difference from the classical process is that , after a ball is chosen on the basis of preferential attachment , with probability @xmath89 the ball becomes inactive . by following the mean - field approach , we derived the asymptotic formula ( [ eq : mixture ] ) , which shows that the distribution of the number of balls in the urns approximately follows a power - law distribution with an exponential cutoff .",
    "exponential cutoffs have been identified in protein , e - mail , actor and collaboration networks , and possibly in the web graph @xcite ; it is likely that exponential cutoffs also occur in other complex networks .",
    "here we have dealt with networks such as collaboration and actor networks , where preferentially chosen authors / actors may become inactive ; in a previous paper ( @xcite ) we have dealt with networks such as protein and e - mail networks , where preferentially chosen proteins / e - mail accounts may be discarded from the network .",
