    "in recent years two distinct subjects , optical - micro cavities and nano - mechanical resonators have become entangled experimentally by underlying mechanism of optical , radiation pressure forces .",
    "the coupling of mechanical and optical degrees of freedom via radiation pressure has been a subject of early research in the context of laser cooling @xcite and gravitational - wave detectors @xcite .",
    "recently there has been a great surge of interest in the application of radiation forces to manipulate the center - of - mass motion of mechanical oscillators covering a huge range of scales from macroscopic mirrors in the laser interferometer gravitational wave observatory ( ligo ) project @xcite to nano - mechanical cantilevers@xcite , vibrating microtoroids@xcite membranes@xcite and bose - einstein condensates @xcite .",
    "the quantum optical properties of a mirror coupled via radiation pressure to a cavity field show interesting similarities to an intracavity kerr - like interaction @xcite .",
    "recently , in the context of classical investigations of nonlinear regimes , the dynamical instability of a driven cavity having a movable mirror has been investigated @xcite .",
    "theoretical work has proposed to use the radiation - pressure coupling for quantum non - demolition measurements of the light field @xcite .    in the field of quantum degenerate gases , standard methods to observe quantum properties of ultracold atoms are based on destructive matter - wave interference between atoms released from traps @xcite .",
    "recently , a new approach was proposed which is based on all optical measurements that conserve the number of atoms .",
    "it was shown that atomic quantum statistics can be mapped on transmission spectra of high - q cavities , where atoms create a quantum refractive index .",
    "this was shown to be useful for studying phase transitions between mott insulator and superfluid states since various phases show qualitatively distinct spectra @xcite .",
    "new possibilities for cavity opto - mechanics by combining the tools of cavity electrodynamics with those of ultracold gases is the motivation of the present work . here we show that different quantum states of ultracold gases in optical lattice , confined in a cavity can be distinguished by the steady state displacement spectrum of the movable mirror ( cantilever ) .",
    "the atomic and cantilever back - action shifts the cavity resonance .",
    "the laser - pump is shown to coherently control the dynamics of the mirror . changing the pump intensity",
    ", one can switch between stable and bistable regimes .",
    "due to coupling between the condensate wavefunction and the cantilever , mediated by the cavity photons , the cantilever displacement spectrum is continuously modified as the condensate moves across the brillouin zone .",
    "we also show that in the presence of atom - atom interactions , the coupling of the mechanical oscillator , the cavity field fluctuations and the condensate fluctuations ( bogoliubov mode ) leads to the splitting of the normal mode into three modes ( normal mode splitting ) .",
    "we consider an elongated cigar shaped bose - einstein condensate(bec ) of @xmath0 two - level @xmath1 atoms in the @xmath2 state with mass @xmath3 and frequency @xmath4 of the @xmath5 transition of the @xmath6 line of @xmath1 , strongly interacting with a quantized single standing wave cavity mode of frequency @xmath7 ( fig.1 ) . the cavity field",
    "is also coupled to external fields incident from one side mirror . in order to create an elongated bec",
    ", the frequency of the harmonic trap along the transverse direction should be much larger than one in the axial ( along the direction of the optical lattice ) direction .",
    "the system is also coherently driven by a laser field with frequency @xmath8 through the cavity mirror with amplitude @xmath9 .",
    "the cavity mode is coupled to a mechanical oscillator ( movable mirror ) with frequency @xmath10 via the dimensionless parameter @xmath11 .",

    "it is well known that high - q optical cavities can significantly isolate the system from its environment , thus strongly reducing decoherence and ensuring that the light field remains quantum - mechanical for the duration of the experiment . the harmonic confinement along the directions perpendicular to the optical lattice is taken to be large so that the system effectively reduces to one - dimension .",

    "@xmath20 and @xmath21 are the annihilation operators for a cavity photon and the mechanical mode respectively .",
    "the input laser field populates the intracavity mode which couples to the cantilever through the radiation pressure and the atoms through the dipole interaction .",

    "it is important to notice the nonlinearity in eqn .",

    "the system we are considering is intrinsically open as the cavity field is damped by the photon - leakage through the massive coupling mirror and the cantilever is connected to a bath at finite temperature . in the absence of the radiation - pressure coupling , the cantilever would undergo a pure brownian motion driven by its contact with the thermal environment .",
    "here we also assume that there is no direct coupling between the atoms and the cantilever , though this coupling could give rise to some interesting physics .",

    "we will always take @xmath27 . in this case",
    "the condensate is attracted to the nodes of the light field and hence the lowest bound state is localized at these positions which leads to a reduced coupling of the condensate to the cavity compared to that for @xmath28 . along @xmath29 ,",
    "the cavity field forms an optical lattice potential of period @xmath30 and depth ( @xmath31 ) .",
    "we now write the hamiltonian in a second quantized form including the two body interaction term .    @xmath32    where @xmath33 is the field operator for the atoms .",

    "are usually very small compared to the onsite interaction and are neglected as usual .",
    "we now write down the heisenberg - langevin equation of motion for the bosonic field operator @xmath38 , the internal cavity mode @xmath20 and the mechanical mode @xmath21 as    @xmath42    @xmath43    @xmath44    here @xmath45 and @xmath46 characterizes the dissipation of the optical and mechanical degree of freedom resectively . here , we follow a semi - classical theory by considering _ noncommuting _",

    "the quantities @xmath51 and @xmath52 are the equilibrium occupation numbers for the mechanical and optical oscillators , respectively .",
    "we consider a deep lattice formed by a strong classical potential @xmath53 , so that the overlap between wannier functions is small .",
    "thus , we can neglect the contribution of tunneling by putting @xmath54 and @xmath55 . under this approximation ,",
    "the matter - wave dynamics is not essential for light scattering . in experiments ,",
    "such a situation can be realized because the time scale of light measurements can be much faster than the time scale of atomic tunneling .",
    "one of the well - known advantages of the optical lattices is their extremely high tunability .",
    "thus , tuning the lattice potential , tunneling can be made very slow  @xcite .",
    "the steady state value of the position quadrature @xmath56 ( the subscript @xmath35 denotes the steady state value ) is found as    @xmath57    where ,    @xmath58    , @xmath59 , @xmath60 and @xmath61    .",
    "[ fig.2 ]    here @xmath62 .",
    "the equation for @xmath63 is very important for the understanding the physics behind this problem . from it",
    "we clearly see how the cantilever and atom dynamics affects the steady state of the intracavity field .",
    "the coupling to the mirror and the atoms shifts the cavity resonance frequency and changes the field inside the cavity in a way to induce a new stationary intensity .",
    "the change occurs after a transient time depending on the response of the cavity and the strength of the coupling to the cantilever and the ultracold atoms .",
    "following @xcite eqs .",
    "( [ mechanical_steady],[optical_steady ] ) allows to express @xmath64 as a function @xmath65 of atomic occupation number operators and calculate their expectation values for prescribed atomic states @xmath66 .    for the mott state @xmath67 atoms are well localized at the @xmath68th site with no number fluctuations",
    "it is represented by a product of fock states , i.e. @xmath69 , with expectation values    @xmath70    for simplicity we consider equal average densities @xmath71 .    in sf state , each atom is delocalized over all sites leading to local number fluctuations .",
    "it is represented by superposition of fock states corresponding to all possible distributions of @xmath0 atoms at @xmath72 sites : @xmath73 .",
    "expectation values of light operators can be calculated from    @xmath74    representing a sum of all possible `` classical '' terms .",
    "thus , all these distributions contribute to scattering from a sf , which is obviously different from @xmath75 with only a single contributing term .    in fig.2 , we represent @xmath76 as a function of @xmath77 , where @xmath78 .",
    "clearly for the sf case , the displacement spectra is a sum of lorentzians with different dispersion shifts .",
    "a comb like structure is seen if each lorentzian is resolved . in the mott state",
    "however , a single lorentzian ( thick line ) is noticed .",
    "these were the typical structures predicted for the transmission spectra@xcite . since the coupling between the cantilever and the condensate wavefunction",
    "is mediated by the cavity field , we find that the displacement spectrum of the cantilever maps the distribution function of the ultracold atoms .",
    "an important condition to resolve the lorentzians is @xmath79 and this condition is easily met in present experiments @xcite .",
    "detecting the mirror s motion is straight - forward , since the optical phase shift is directly proportional to the mirror s displacement .",
    "typically , the lorentizian frequency spectrum of the mirror s position is obtained in this way .",
    "the peak width yields the total damping rate , including the effective opto - mechanical damping .",
    "the area under the spectrum reveals the variance of the mirror displacement .",
    ", which is a measure of the effective temperature .",
    "we now consider the case of large number of atoms and hence treat the bec within the mean field framework and assume the tight binding approximation where we replace @xmath38 by @xmath80 and look for solutions in the form of bloch waves @xmath81 @xcite . here",
    "@xmath82 is the chemical potential , @xmath83 is the periodicity of the lattice and @xmath84 ( atomic number density ) , @xmath72 is the total number of lattice sites . from eqns .",
    "( [ mechanical_steady ] ) and ( [ optical_steady ] ) , we obtain a cubic equation in @xmath64 .    @xmath85    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     in fig .",
    "4a , we show a normalized plot of the displacement spectrum @xmath86 for two values of the atomic two - body interaction , @xmath87 ( thin line ) and @xmath88 ( thick line ) .",
    "parameters chosen are : @xmath89,@xmath90,@xmath91 , @xmath92 , @xmath93 and @xmath94 . in the absence of the interactions , we observe the usual normal mode spliiting into two modes and we find that due to a finite atom - atom interaction the normal mode splits up into three modes .",
    "the nms is associated with the mixing between the mechanical mode and the fluctuation of the cavity field around the steady state and the fluctuations of the condensate ( bogoliubov mode ) around the mean field .",
    "the origin of the fluctuations of the cavity field is the beat of the pump photons with the photons scattered from the condensate atoms .",
    "the frequency of the bogoliubov mode in the low momentum limit is @xmath95 @xmath96 .",
    "hence in the absence of interactions , the bogoliubov mode is absent and the system simply reduces to the case of two mode coupling ( i.e coupling between the mechanical mode and the photon fluctuations ) . in the presence of finite atom - atom interaction , the mechanical mode , the photon mode and",
    "the bogoliubov mode forms a system of three coupled oscillators .",
    "it is important to note that splitting in the displacement spectrum occurs only for @xmath97 due to finite width of the peaks .",
    "4(b ) illustrates the influence of increasing the atom - photon coupling @xmath98 .",
    "the nms is now much more prominent compared to the case with @xmath99 .",
    "similar three coupled oscillator experimental results where two coupled cavities , each containing three identical quantum wells @xcite and one micro - cavity containing two quantum wells@xcite have been reported .",
    "one experimental limitation could be spontaneous emission which leads to momentum diffusion and hence heating of the atomic sample @xcite .",
    "the parameters chosen here are within current technological reach@xcite and hence the observation of the paramertic nms is within experimental reach .",
    "in summary we have analyzed a novel scheme of cavity - opto - mechanics with ultracold atoms .",
    "we showed that the steady state displacement spectra of a cantilever coupled indirectly to a gas of ultracold atoms in an optical lattice through the cavity field are distinct for different quantum phases of equal densities .",
    "further , we showed that in the mean - field of the atoms , the cantilever displacement shows a bistable behviour for high pump intensities and exhibits a dependence on the position of the condensate in the brillouin zone due to the back - action of the condensate on the cantilever .",
    "the cantilever displacement spectrum shows a bistable behaviour when the condensate is at the edge of the brillouin zone . in the presence of atom - atom interactions",
    ", the coupling of the mechanical oscillator , the cavity field fluctuations and the condensate fluctuations ( bogoliubov mode ) leads to the splitting of the normal mode into three modes ( normal mode splitting ) .",
    "the system described here shows a complex interplay between distinctly three systems namely , the nano - mechanical cantilever , optical micro - cavity and the gas of ultracold atoms . the quantum state of the degenerate gas influences the cantilever displacement spectra via the cavity photons , while on the other hand the cantilever displacement modifies the cavity field which in turn modifies the properties of the condensate . manipulating the position of the condensate in the brillouin zone and the atomic tunneling",
