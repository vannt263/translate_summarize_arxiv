    "the system created in non - central relativistic nucleus - nucleus collisions possesses large orbital angular momentum .",
    "one of the most interesting and important phenomena predicted to occur in such a system is global polarization of the system  @xcite .",
    "this phenomenon manifests itself in the polarization of produced secondary particles along the direction of the system s angular momentum .",
    "measurement of global polarization may provide valuable insight into the evolution of the system , the mechanism for hadronization , and the origin of hadronic spin preferences .",
    "the orbital angular momentum of the system may be transformed into a preference in global spin orientation of particles by spin - orbit coupling at various stages of the system evolution .",
    "this can happen at the partonic level , while the system evolves as an ensemble of deconfined polarized quarks .",
    "polarization of hadrons produced secondarily could also be acquired via hadron re - scattering at a later hadronic stage .",
    "an example of transformation from system orbital momentum to the global polarization of produced @xmath5-mesons , which is due to the pion re - scattering , is discussed in  @xcite .",
    "one specific scenario for the spin - orbit transformation via the polarized quark phase is discussed in  @xcite .",
    "there , it is argued that parton interactions in non - central relativistic nucleus - nucleus collisions lead first to the global polarization of the produced quarks . the magnitude for this global quark polarization at rhic ( relativistic heavy ion collider ) energies",
    "was estimated to be as high as thirty percent .",
    "assuming that the strange and non strange quark polarizations ( @xmath6 and @xmath7 , respectively ) are equal , in the particular case of the ` exclusive ' parton recombination scenario  @xcite , the global polarization @xmath8 for @xmath0 , @xmath9 , and @xmath10 hyperons appears to be similar to that for quarks : @xmath11 .",
    "recently more realistic calculations  @xcite of the global quark polarization were performed within a model based on the htl ( hard thermal loop ) gluon propagator .",
    "the resulting hyperon polarization was predicted to be in the range from @xmath12 to @xmath13 , depending on the temperature of the qgp formed .    in this paper",
    "we present the centrality dependence of @xmath0 and @xmath1 hyperon global polarization in au+au collisions at @xmath14=62 and 200  gev measured with the star ( solenoidal tracker at rhic ) detector .",
    "in the hyperon global polarization measurement we use the observable derived in  @xcite : @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the hyperon global polarization , @xmath17 is the reaction plane angle , and @xmath18 is the hyperon decay parameter .",
    "@xmath19 is the azimuthal angle of the 3-momentum of hyperon s decay product , measured in hyperon s rest frame .",
    "angle brackets in this equation denote an average over the solid angle of the hyperon s decay product 3-momentum in the hyperon s rest frame and over all directions of the system orbital momentum @xmath20 , or , in other words , over all possible orientations of the reaction plane .",
    "note that in eq .",
    "[ globalpolarizationobservable ] , perfect detector acceptance is assumed .",
    "a detailed study  @xcite of detector acceptance effects shows that related systematic uncertainty is less than @xmath21 .",
    "the hyperon reconstruction procedure used in this analysis is similar to that in  @xcite . @xmath0 and @xmath1 particles were reconstructed from their weak decay topology , @xmath22 and @xmath23 , using charged tracks measured in the star main tpc ( time projection chamber )  @xcite .",
    "the corresponding decay parameter is @xmath24  @xcite . in this analysis hyperon candidates with invariant mass within the window @xmath25 @xmath26",
    "the statistics for @xmath1hyperons is smaller than that for @xmath0hyperons by 40% ( 20% ) for au+au collisions at @xmath14=62  gev ( 200  gev ) .",
    "the background contribution is estimated by fitting the invariant mass distribution with the sum of a gaussian and a 3rd - order polynomial function , and is found to be less than 8% .",
    "collision centrality was defined using the total charged particle multiplicity within a pseudorapidity window of @xmath27 .",
    "the charged particle multiplicity distribution was divided into nine centrality bins ( classes ) : ( most central collisions ) , , , , , , , , and of the total hadronic inelastic cross section for au+au collisions .    the reaction plane angle in eq .  [ globalpolarizationobservable ]",
    "is estimated by calculating the so - called event plane flow vector @xmath28 .",
    "this implies the necessity to correct the final results by the reaction plane resolution @xmath29  @xcite .",
    "the global polarization measurement requires the knowledge of the direction of the system orbital momentum @xmath20 , hence , of the first - order event plane vector . in this paper , the first - order event plane vector was determined from two star forward tpcs  @xcite , which span a pseudorapidity region @xmath30 .",
    "charged particle tracks with transverse momentum @xmath31 gev are used to define the event plane vector .",
    "it was found in this analysis that the event plane vector defined with the particles measured in the forward tpcs is reliable within the centrality region for au+au collisions at @xmath14=62  gev . with higher multiplicity at @xmath14=200  gev ,",
    "saturation effects in the forward tpcs for the most central collisions become evident , and the estimated reaction plane angle is unreliable . due to this effect ,",
    "the centrality region used for the @xmath0 ( @xmath1 ) hyperon global polarization measurement in au+au collisions at @xmath14=200  gev is limited to .",
    "the measured hyperons consist of primordial @xmath0 ( @xmath1 ) and feed down from multiply strange hyperons ( @xmath32 and @xmath33 ) and @xmath34 decays , and also from short - lived resonances decaying via strong interactions . under the assumption that the global polarization has the same value for @xmath0 and @xmath34  @xcite , we estimate the relative contribution from @xmath34 to the extracted global polarization of the @xmath0 hyperons to be @xmath35% .",
    "this estimate takes into account an average polarization transfer from @xmath34 to @xmath0 of @xmath36  @xcite ( this value can be affected by non - uniform acceptance of the daughter @xmath0 ) .",
    "it furthermore allows for the @xmath37 production ratio to be 2 - 3 times higher for au+au collisions than the value ( 15% ) measured  @xcite for d+au .",
    "based on the results  @xcite , the contribution of feed - downs from multiply strange hyperons ( @xmath10 , @xmath33 ) is estimated to be less than 15% .",
    "the effect of feed - downs to @xmath0 ( @xmath1 ) from strongly decaying resonances has not been measured with the star detector .",
    "calculations from a string fragmentation model  @xcite suggest that in @xmath38 collisions the fraction of direct hyperons is about 27% for @xmath0 and 15% for @xmath1 , respectively .",
    "the global polarization measurement could also conceivably be affected by hyperon spin precession in the strong magnetic field within the tpc .",
    "the effect of the spin precession on the global polarization measurements is found to be negligible .",
    "the overall relative uncertainty in the @xmath0 ( @xmath1 ) hyperon global polarization measurement due to detector effects is estimated to be less than a factor of 2 .",
