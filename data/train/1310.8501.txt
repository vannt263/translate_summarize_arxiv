    "confined liquid crystals ( lcs ) have attracted much attention and are important from a fundamental as well as applied perspectives @xcite . because of long - range ( critical ) correlations implied by the lc elastic hamiltonian @xcite , the anchoring of the liquid crystal molecules adjacent to the confining substrates has a significant effect on the properties of the confined material .",
    "this effects can range from the changes wrought in the nature of the structural phase transitions of the confined lc material , as well as changes in the behavior of the correlation functions  @xcite . in a geometry where the director describing",
    "the medium deep in the lc phase is uniform and thus the elastic energy is zero , thermal fluctuations can show up through creating an effective inter - surface interaction @xcite .",
    "these interactions have been dubbed _ pseudo - casimir _ because of the similarities with electromagnetic ( em ) casimir - van der waals interactions @xcite also related to the long - range ( critical ) fluctuations of the em fields @xcite . while the phenomenology of the pseudo - casimir interactions in confined lc slabs is quite rich @xcite and can include interesting variation as in the case of nematic polymers @xcite , they usually scale with the thermal energy , being consequently small and therefore not easily detectable .",
    "however , in recent years there have been extensive theoretical investigations into model systems that would more closely mimic real experimental conditions . in this",
    "respect models that consider natural inhomogeneities in samples preparation affecting the shape of the boundary surfaces as well as the surface anchoring energy are particularly relevant and have been introduced in the context of em casimir interactions @xcite as well as in the context of confined lc slabs @xcite .",
    "the boundary surface disorder induced by these inhomogeneities has been recently studied in great detail specifically within the context of coulomb fluids @xcite .",
    "they have been shown to cause a pronounced effect on the interactions between these disorder inducing surfaces mostly via the coupling between the thermal fluctuations and the surface induced disorder .",
    "this coupling leads , after an appropriate averaging depending on the nature of the disorder @xcite , to additional free energy terms that depend on the separation between apposed surfaces .",
    "this disorder - induced interaction can be sometimes larger than the standard casimir interaction and should thus be at least in principle easier to detect . while most of the works on disorder induced interactions have been limited to the coulomb systems , there is no reason why the same type of phenomena should not be observable in other systems , characterized by critical correlations .    here , we therefore investigate the effects of disorder in the homeotropic easy direction at the bounding surfaces of a nematic lc film @xcite on the interaction between them .",
    "describing the surface disorder fields with a simple gaussian distribution for the homeotropic easy direction ( with an assumed width or variance ) allows us _ grosso modo _ to capture the orientational anchoring disorder present at heterogeneous surfaces .",
    "we consider both types of disorder : the quenched type as well as the annealed type and derive the corresponding interaction free energies after the appropriate averaging over the disorder degrees of freedom .",
    "the coupling between the latter and the fluctuating fields is modelled within the rapini - papoular surface interaction phenomenology @xcite . in the case of annealed disorder",
    ", we obtain an effective free energy for the fluctuating director field which takes a standard pseudo - casimir form @xcite but with a renormalized anchoring energy , while in the case of quenched disorder , we find that the disorder in the homeotropic easy direction leads to a distinct additive term besides the pseudo - casimir contribution in the total interaction free energy .",
    "this is very similar to the general state of affairs in the context of coulomb fluids under imposed external disorder in the monopolar charge distribution on bounding surfaces @xcite . in the present context ,",
    "however , we show that the disorder effects are important only at an intermediate range of separation between the bounding surfaces and vanish for both very large and very small separations ; this makes the easy direction disorder characteristically different from the charge disorder effects , which dominate only at large separations .",
    "the conclusion is then that the quenched disorder creates an additive contribution , which is dependent on the disorder variance and can be thus as large as the disorder parameters allow it to be , whereas the annealed disorder leads to a non - additive modification of the fluctuation induced interaction between disordered bounding surfaces and is thus fundamentally limited in its magnitude even for large disorder variances .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows : in section [ sec : model ] , we present details of our model and the formalism employed to calculate the interaction free energy due to the lc director fluctuations between disordered boundaries . in section",
    "[ sec : quenched ] , we analyze the results in the case of quenched disorder and then turn to the case of annealed disorder in section [ sec : annealed ] .",
    "we conclude our discussion in section [ sec : concl ] .",
    "we consider a nematic liquid - crystalline film in a hybrid cell geometry bounded by two flat , plane - parallel surfaces located at the positions @xmath0 and @xmath1 along the normal axis to the surfaces @xcite .",
    "the substrate at @xmath0 is assumed to impose a strong homeotropic anchoring , such that the nematic phase can be characterized by a uniform mean director field @xmath2 .",
    "the preferred anchoring orientation of the director field , or the so - called easy direction @xmath3 , on the substrate at @xmath1 is assumed to be disordered as we shall specify later .",
    "the strength of the anchoring on this substrate , denoted by @xmath4 , is assumed to be finite .",
    "the frank s continuum elastic energy for the bulk phase is then given by @xmath5 , \\label{bgcfhje}\\ ] ] where @xmath6 is the nematic director field , @xmath7 with @xmath8 being the lateral cartesian coordinates , and @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and @xmath11 are the splay , twist , and bend elastic constants , respectively @xcite .    here , we are interested in small fluctuations @xmath12 around the mean - field value of the director @xmath13 . up to the second order , the fluctuation field can thus be written in terms of two fluctuation modes ( corresponding to the massless modes that result from spontaneous breaking of two continuous rotational symmetries in nematics @xcite ) as @xmath14 , and hence , @xmath15 .",
    "thus within the effective one - constant approximation , the bulk elastic energy eq .",
    "( [ bgcfhje ] ) assumes the form @xmath16.\\ ] ] the interaction of the nematic director with the substrate at @xmath1 is taken into account through the rapini - papoular surface energy model of a quadratic form @xcite @xmath17    the easy direction @xmath18 is now assumed to have a random distribution around the preferred or the mean easy direction @xmath19 .",
    "for the sake of consistency , we assume that the deviations from this preferred direction are small , i.e. , the lateral components @xmath20 and @xmath21 are small while @xmath22 . in spherical presentation @xmath23 , the latter approximation implies that the disordered easy direction exhibits small deviations in the polar angle @xmath24 from the constant homeotropic anchoring .",

    "the latter implies that disorder has a translationally invariant correlation .",
    "specifically , we shall assume that the random distribution of these fields across the anchoring surface @xmath1 follows a gaussian probability distribution function as @xmath32 = c \\exp\\big\\{-{1\\over 2}\\int d^{2}x \\,d^{2}x ' \\ , e_i({\\bf x})c^{-1}({\\bf x } - { \\bf x}')e_i ( { \\bf x}')\\big\\},\\ ] ] where @xmath33 is a normalization constant .    for any",

    "clearly , the partition function is a functional of the disordered easy direction fields and the free energy of the system is obtained after taking a proper ensemble average over all possible realizations of these fields . in order to do this",
    ", one should distinguish between different types of disorder , such as quenched or annealed disorder @xcite ( or even partially - annealed disorder @xcite which will not be considered in this work ) .    in the _ quenched disorder _",
    "model , the random distribution of the easy direction fields is frozen over the surface at @xmath1 .",

    "on the other hand , the disorder fields are assumed to be thermalized with the bulk degrees of freedom and should be thus treated on the same footing ; hence , one should take the average of the partition function itself in order to obtain the free energy as @xmath42 \\rangle.\\ ] ] in what follows , we shall first focus on the quenched disorder model , which is the case of interest in this work , and then briefly consider also the case of annealed disorder .",
    "the disorder average in the quenched model , eq .",
    "( [ eq : quenched_av ] ) , can be performed using the standard replica  trick \" @xcite by making use of the following _ ansatz _ : @xmath43 note that the two modes , @xmath44 and @xmath45 , are degenerate , and that the partition function ( [ eq : z_1 ] ) can be factorized as @xmath46 = \\prod_{i = x , y } { \\mathcal z}[e_i]$ ] .",
    "thus , since the two easy direction fields are statistically uncorrelated and have identical probability distribution functions , we can drop the subindex @xmath47 and in the end multiply the free energy by a factor of 2 . after taking the gaussian integrals over the disorder fields",

    "finally , the total free energy of the system is obtained as @xmath65,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the contribution of both director modes has been taken into account .",
    "it is evident that the free energy of the system consists of two additive terms @xmath66 , where @xmath67 is the standard pseudo - casimir interaction due to nematic fluctuations in a film ( bounded by a surface with infinite anchoring on @xmath0 and and another surface with finite anchoring at @xmath1 )  @xcite and the second term , @xmath68 , is due to the quenched statistics of the easy direction ( on the @xmath1 surface ) .",
    "the explicit forms of the pseudo - casimir term is given by @xmath69 while the disorder contribution is obtained as @xmath70 where @xmath71 is the _ extrapolation length _ and we have used the continuum representation of the fourier mode summation by using @xmath72 . also the irrelevant terms due to the free energies of the bulk and surfaces are omitted from the free energy .",
    "we thus find that the effects of quenched disorder in the easy direction appear in an _ additive _ form in the free energy .",
    "this closely resembles the behavior seen in coulomb fluids bounded by disordered charge distributions @xcite or indeed also _ in vacuo _ between disordered charge distributions @xcite , where the quenched disorder effects also appear in an additive form .",
    "this property however does not hold in general ; for instance , for a nematic film with quenched disordered anchoring energy , we find a more complicated non - additive behavior which will be discussed elsewhere @xcite .",
    "also we note that the disorder contribution to the free energy eq .",
    "( [ fcorr ] ) is intrinsically not limited in magnitude and can vary depending on the disorder parameters .",
    "this is fundamentally different from the annealed case that exhibits an intrinsic upper bound ( see below ) .",
    "the effective interactions between bounding surfaces mediated by nematic fluctuations are thus modified by an additive contribution when the easy direction exhibits a quenched random distribution on one of the anchoring surfaces .",

    "the integrations in the force expressions can be performed explicitly .",
    "hence , for the pseudo - casimir force , eq .",

    "the disorder force is thus repulsive as well but diverges for small separations as @xmath93 .",

    "the strengths of the disorder contribution again decreases upon increasing the disorder correlation , fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , and decreasing the variance , fig .  [ fig4 ] .",
    "it is however interesting to note that , for a given set of parameters , the total interaction force in the annealed case is found to be more repulsive ( less attractive ) than that in the quenched case ( see fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] ) .",
    "in this work , we have investigated the effective fluctuation - induced force between two planar boundaries that confine a nematic liquid crystalline film in the situation where one of the bounding surfaces imposes a random distribution for the preferred anchoring axis ( easy direction ) of the nematic director field .",
    "we have treated both cases of quenched ( with a frozen disordered distribution for the easy axis ) and annealed disorder ( with a random but thermalized distribution of the easy direction ) .",
    "it is shown that in the quenched case the total interaction free energy is decomposed into two separate ( additive ) contributions , namely , a standard disorder - free pseudo - casimir interaction and a disorder - induced contribution which is proportional to the variance of the disorder distribution .",
    "this latter quantity can be tuned to enhance or suppress the disorder effects independently of the pseudo - casimir effect .",
    "on the contrary , in the annealed case the disorder effects can not be dissociated from the pseudo - casimir interaction so that the whole effect can be expressed by an effective pseudo - casimir interaction free energy but with a renormalized extrapolation length .",
    "the free energy in this case is bounded by two standard universal limiting laws [ see eq .",
    "( [ eq : limits_a ] ) ] and , therefore , the disorder effect ( for weak or strong disorder variance ) is also bracketed by these limiting laws .    in both cases of annealed and quenched disorder ,",
    "we have shown that the easy direction disorder leads to a more repulsive interaction force at small separations as compared with the ( disorder - free ) pseudo - casimir force .",
    "also it leads to a shift to larger values of the crossover position where the force vanishes , that is , the stable bound - state between the surfaces becomes less stable .",
    "we should also note that according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : leff ] ) the effective extrapolation length can in principle become negative unless @xmath127 , where @xmath128 is the critical strength of the disorder correlations .",
    "this implies that there is a regime in the parameter space where disorder completely destabilizes the system and is thus outside the confines of the methodology of the present theoretical framework . for the simple case of an uncorrelated disorder @xmath129 , or in general for @xmath130 of the type shown in eq .",
    "( [ eq : c_q ] ) , the destabilizing effect of disorder is avoided for all modes provided that @xmath131 .",
    "if we then use @xmath132 , we end up with @xmath133 .",
    "as @xmath80 measures the variance of the disorder in the easy direction this condition gives an estimate of the maximum polar angle fluctuations of the easy direction that would still not destabilize the system and is given by @xmath134 .",
    "this is a reasonable assumption since @xmath135 can take a wide range of non - zero values for a finite anchoring .",
    "we therefore expect that the requirements for the positivity of the effective extrapolation length , giving rise to a stable solution in the presence of disorder , holds in most realistic situations .",
    "while characteristic properties of disorder induced interactions in confined lcs are similar to the general behavior found in systems with monopolar charge disorder in the context of em casimir effect or coulomb fluids @xcite , our results nevertheless show a fundamental difference between this latter case and the confined lcs .",
    "the easy direction disorder turns out to become important in general only in an intermediate range of inter - surface separations or , in other words , for intermediate strength of the anchoring energy and becomes negligible ( relative to the pseudo - casimir contribution ) both for very small and very large separations .",
    "this is obviously contrary to the behavior of a disordered coulomb system , where the effects of charge disorder become gradually more important as the disorder builds up and eventually dominate at large separations .",
    "our results thus clearly point to differences between the disorder effects in these two types of systems that are both characterized by critical correlations .",
    "the disorder effects are therefore not portable outside the exact nature of the system even if thermal and disorder correlations have the same qualitative behavior .",
