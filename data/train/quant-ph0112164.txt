    "the key scheme of cavity quantum electrodynamics ( qed)@xcite , modern atom optics and interferometry @xcite is the resonant interaction of an atom with cavity fields , created as standing or counterpropagating waves .  the first type ( with respective quantization on the sw basis ) is attained in two plane - parallel - mirror cavities ( in short , cavity ) , while the second type ( with respective cpw - quantization ) is attained in three or more mirror cavities ( ring cavities ) .",
    "it is well known , in addition , that for classical picture of fields , these two representations are equivalent in the sense , that the sw can always be presented as a superposition of two counterpropagating travelling waves .  in the quantum theory , nevertheless , they are divers@xcite , including the hamiltonians of interaction .  hence it needs to be ascertained : are the diversities only quantitative or qualitative too , and how much are they for these or that circumstances and processes .",
    "note , that it presents not only an academic interest , since in the microcavities ( @xmath0 ) several dozens of photons can induce strong optical nonlinearities for dipole - allowed optical transitions .",
    "as far as we know , elucidation of physical aspects of mentioned incongruity had been done in paper @xcite , taking as an example the process of near - resonant coherent diffraction of atomic matter - waves by a space - periodic laser radiation field , known as near - resonant kapitza - dirac diffraction@xcite .  by means of numerical solution of the master equations for atomic probability amplitudes ,",
    "the existence of evident differences between sw and cpw diffraction patterns was shown , in strictly quantum domain of cavity fields ( the mean number of photons in cavities was chosen one ) .",
    "the physical reason of the difference also was presented .",
    "it is the behavior of momentum conservation law in relevant  atom + field  systems .",
    "this general principle ceases to apply in sw - case , because the atom changes its own momentum due to the interaction , while the sw - field does not .  in contrary , in cpw - case",
    "both , atomic and field subsystems , change the momenta equally and in opposite directions , thereby conserving the systems total momentum .  already on the base of this sole difference",
    "can be anticipated a ",
    "diffraction for cpw - case with a respectively narrower distribution of states in the momentum space .    in this paper are considered the stationary states of the system  two - level atom + quantized field  in both sw and cpw - cases and the qualitative and quantitative differences between them are carried out in the range of quantum optics ( the number of photons should be less than several tens ) . to this end the simplest theoretical model , the jaynes - cummings model ( jcm ) @xcite , including the quantized atomic center - of - mass motion @xcite , will be used .",
    "the spontaneous emission and other incoherent processes , as usual for this model , are omitted .     to make possible",
    "the direct comparison of these two concepts we , at first , represent detailed theory for stationary states of the systems at hand .",
    "our representation for sw - case somewhat coincides with the picture in @xcite .",
    "the preliminary analysis of the states and the comparison of the sw and cpw - cases are based on numerical solutions of the exact , as well as of the off - resonant approximate equations of atomic probability amplitudes in momentum space .",
    "an additional approximate analytical solution of the problem allows us to find out the parameters ( terms ) , determining the size of nonequivalency between the sw and cpw - spectrums and eigenfunctions in explicit form .",
    "the latter solutions pertain , however , only to bounded ( wells inner ) atomic states .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section ii represents the basic model and the exact set of equations .",
    "here we also give some numerical simulations of the problem , implemented for the sodium atom with @xmath1 main transition .",
    "section iii represents the off - resonance and mentioned analytical approximations .  in section",
    "iv we examine the bragg and doppleron resonances , including the recoil energy terms .  in section v we consider the mechanisms responsible for the formation of stationary states from free definite - momentum ones .  conclusions and some short remarks about the subject",
    "are given in section vi .",
    "we consider a two level atom of mass @xmath2 and optical transition frequency @xmath3 , interacting with a quantized plane monochromatic field of frequency @xmath4 .  we will restrict ourselves with two important cases of standing and counterpropagating waves .",
    "the longitudinal components @xmath5 of the atomic center - of - mass ( c.m . )",
    "momentum remain unchanged for perfectly plane fields , so that only the transverse atomic momentum @xmath6 needs to be considered .",
    "since the incoherent processes are not included , the system is governed by the schrodinger equation .",
    "let us first consider the cpw - case .",
    "the hamiltonian in dipole and rotating - wave approximations is given by @xcite @xmath7    @xmath8 ,   \\eqnum{1 }   \\label{1}\\ ] ]    where @xmath9 is atomic momentum operator ( 1d ) , @xmath10 and @xmath11 are usual pseudospin atomic ( pauli ) operators , @xmath12 and @xmath13 @xmath14 are annihilation and creation operators for two running wave modes , @xmath15 .",
    "the factor @xmath16 in coupling constant is the vacuum rabi frequency ,  and is connected with the atomic transition dipole moment @xmath17 by relation @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the normalization ( cavity ) volume .",
    "the coherent binding between the internal and c.m .",
    "variables is by the rabi frequency @xmath16 , too .",
    "the system under consideration has four degrees of freedom :  two per atomic internal and 1d c.m .",
    "motions , and two per counterpropagating travelling waves .",
    "three operators , forming together with the hamiltonian the complete set of mutually commutative operators , are known and are the following : the excitation number operator @xmath20 the total momentum operator @xmath21 and the operator @xmath22 which combines translational @xmath23 and dipole inversing @xmath24 operators .  therefore @xmath25 and @xmath26 have compatible eigenvalues and a common system of eigenfunctions .",
    "only these states , being the basic , should be considered thereafter in this paper .",
    "any other state , of course in principle , can be presented via these eigenstates .",
    "note , that sometimes the operator @xmath27 is used in related problems .",
    "however , @xmath28and can not be added into the set of mentioned operators or replace the operator @xmath29 there .    out of a desire to better understand the future solutions and their connection with free - state values , which present a definite interest too",
    ", it may be worth to emphasize here that all three @xmath30 and @xmath31 operators do nt contain the interaction parameter @xmath16 .",
    "they are interaction independent .",
    "their eigenvalues , denoted by @xmath32 and @xmath33 respectively , also are interaction independent .",
    "therefore , any intermediate or final state , created from the initial one due to interaction should possess the same values of @xmath32 and @xmath33 as the free initial state .",
    "these ones , of course , do nt need to be stationary in general , but may be such , if the interaction is adiabatic@xcite .",
    "a sufficient condition for adiabatic following is the exceeding of the interaction switching on and switching off times ( @xmath34 ) , the inverse quantity of the system s smallest characteristic frequency ( @xmath35 ) .  in the system at hand ,",
    "as a such frequency appears the one - photon recoil frequency @xmath36  so for the interaction times essentially exceeding the recoil time @xmath37 , the atomic state evaluation is adiabatic with respect to both , internal and c.m . ,",
    "motions of the atom @xcite .",
    "failure of the adiabatic condition implies , respectively , that the population leaks into the immediate neighboring states , first of all into the translational states .",
    "applying the general remarks to the system under consideration , we arrive to the possibility to treat the stationary states as attained adiabatically from some free initial state and then replace the set of @xmath32 and @xmath33 quantities by a new set of three related parameters of this initial state : atomic momentum @xmath38 and the photon numbers @xmath39and @xmath40 in counterpropagating waves",
    ".  one must keep in mind , however , that the mentioned replacement , which will be embodied soon , is substantial for adiabatically treated stationary states and is not obligatory even in this case .",
    "dirac notations @xmath41and @xmath42are used for quantized travelling - wave states ( number states ) .",

    "and internal motions , as well as of the field modes .",
    "thereby , the nondegenerate wave function of the free system can be written as @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the normalization constant , @xmath48 @xmath49 and @xmath50 in general .",
    "the seeking wave functions of the interacting system can be written as a superposition of ( [ 5])-type terms .",
    "the general form of a wave function with a definite @xmath51 ( @xmath52 ) is @xmath53    @xmath54    where @xmath55 and @xmath56 are arbitrary coefficients yet .",
    "admissible solutions also should be normalized according to @xmath57 @xmath58  note , that the excitation number @xmath51 can be represented by means of the numbers @xmath39 and @xmath59 ( see the remark above ):",
    "@xmath60 validity of which can be directly checked with the help of wave function ( [ 6 ] ) .    for the next step we demand from @xmath61 to be the eigenfunction of total momentum operator @xmath62 : @xmath63 inserting ( [ 3 ] ) and ( [ 6 ] ) into ( [ 8 ] ) we arrive to equations @xmath64",

    "we suppress @xmath32 and @xmath89 in probability amplitude and energy notations .    rather than pursuing the governing equations in this cpw - case we now turn to another case , to sw - case .",

    "the system ",
    "atom + sw  has three degrees of freedom , by one less than the system with cpw .",
    "the reason is , that the momentum @xmath95and is not commutative with the hamiltonian ( [ 16 ] ) .",
    "proceeding the same way as for ( [ 11 ] ) and ( [ 15a ] ) , ( [ 15b ] ) , we arrive to @xmath96 for wave function , and @xmath97 a_{l}=\\left ( \\hbar \\omega _ { 0}/4\\right ) \\sqrt{n}\\left [ b_{l-1}+b_{l}\\right ] , \\eqnum{18a }   \\label{18a}\\ ] ] @xmath98 b_{l}=\\left ( \\hbar \\omega _ { 0}/4\\right ) \\sqrt{n}% \\left [ a_{l+1}+a_{l}\\right ]    \\eqnum{18b }   \\label{18b}\\ ] ] for probability amplitudes and energies . here",
    "@xmath99 , and the other notations are obvious .",
    "for adiabatically attained states @xmath100    besides the apparent similarities , the basic sets of equations , ( [ 15a ] ) , ( [ 15b ] ) and ( [ 18a ] ) , ( [ 18b ] ) , also have basic differences .",
    "while the first set is finite - size , the second one is infinite ( even for @xmath101 one - photon case ) .",
    "the next difference is in right - hand side coefficients .",
    "they are varied ( @xmath102-dependent ) for the first , but are constant for the second set .  and",
    "the final difference , which already is conceptual and deserves a peculiar attention , is that the total momentum @xmath69 in cpw - case , in contrast to its counterpart @xmath38 in sw case , can not be treated as a quasimomentum .",
    "this assertion immediately follows from the fact , that the replacing @xmath103 , with the relabeling @xmath104 in ( [ 15a ] ) , ( [ 15b ] ) , @xmath105 being an integer , conserves the left - hand side coefficients invariant , while the right - hand side coefficients get new values , leading thereby to other values for eigenenergies and probability amplitudes .",
    "reminding that the physical reason of this difference is the participation of the momentum conservation law , we arrive at a conclusion that @xmath106 @xmath107 @xmath108 @xmath106 @xmath109 @xmath110 @xmath111 @xmath112 @xmath113 @xmath114 @xmath115 @xmath116 @xmath106 @xmath117 @xmath108 @xmath118 @xmath119 .",

    "let us return to the theme of stationary states in the cases under consideration . our objective is to clarify the ideas about the quantum contents of interaction mechanisms in sw and cpw - cases , to indicate the differences between them and already from this point , to understand the formation of stationary states from initially free states",
    ".  to present them , we will first consider the sw - case .",
    "the variation of atomic c.m .",
    "motion in this case can be imagined as a diffraction of atomic matter waves on  frozen ",
    "immovable object : the standing wave grating .",
    "this is a fully classical - like phenomenon , provided by the matter - wave representation for atomic c.m .",
    "the picture , that the scattering is a result of absorption and reemission of sw - photons should be regarded as a defective , since it does not answer to the question how the atomic momentum is changing due to these zero - momentum photons .",
    "this obstacle is overcame in the theory by the fact that the probability amplitude distribution @xmath232 with @xmath233 , as well as the amplitude distribution @xmath234 represent only the atomic states and do not concern to photons .     to realize the adiabatic evolution of the system from initially free state to the stationary coupling one",
    ", we assume the parameter @xmath16 of the interaction to be a slow function of time , replace @xmath79 by @xmath235 in ( [ 25 ] )  ( in off - resonance approximation ) and view the @xmath232-amplitudes and the parameter @xmath79 as a slowly varying in time quantities .",
    "after a phase transformation @xmath236 ,   \\eqnum{40 }   \\label{40}\\ ] ] we arrive at the equation @xmath237 for density matrix elements , which are more preferable for the putted objective .  here",
    "@xmath238 is the analog of doppler frequency shift .",
    "the equation ( [ 41 ] ) is , of course , too complicated to be inspected in general form , but we may consider the initial stage of interaction , taking in addition @xmath239  then @xmath240 are fully imaginary with @xmath241 @xmath242 ( for @xmath243 ) and the relative rate of depletion of the state with @xmath244 and @xmath245 is given by relative values of @xmath246 and @xmath247 respectively .  if @xmath248 then @xmath249 and less modulo momentum states are being filled more rapidly than more modulo momentum states .  as a result ,",
    "the mean atomic momentum decreases gradually , gathering for asymptotically long times about the zero value .  in attained stationary state , the mean atomic momentum approaches zero .  note , that this is a stimulated analog of well known doppler cooling ( slowing ) of red - detuned atoms in the standing wave .",
    "the case of cpw we will start ( and mainly restrict ourselves ) by the immovable atom model ( about commutative set of operators see in appendix ) , since it gives an opportunity to present the additional mechanism  for stationary state formation .",
    "putting @xmath250 in eqs .",
    "( [ 15a ] ) and ( [ 15b ] ) and substituting the second into the first we readily arrive at equation @xmath251}\\left [ \\sqrt{r(n - r+1)}% % tcimacro{\\func{im}}% % beginexpansion \\mathop{\\rm im}% % endexpansion ( \\alpha _ { r}\\alpha _ { r-1}^{\\ast } ) + \\sqrt{(r+1)(n - r)}% % tcimacro{\\func{im}}% % beginexpansion \\mathop{\\rm im}% % endexpansion ( \\alpha _ { r}\\alpha _ { r+1}^{\\ast } ) \\right ]    \\eqnum{42 }   \\label{42}\\ ] ] for density matrix elements , where @xmath252}\\right ) t% \\right ] .",
    "\\eqnum{43 }   \\label{43}\\ ] ] here , in contrast to sw - case , each atomic c.m .",
    "state is single - bonded with the pair of photon numbers in cpw .",
    "the mathematical response of this connection is that the @xmath253and @xmath254 amplitudes are the representation of both atomic c.m . and photonic states simultaneously .",
    "the difference between the rates of @xmath255 and @xmath256 transitions now is determined by square roots @xmath257 and @xmath258  the former term represents the process of reemission of a photon from the first travelling wave , containing preliminary @xmath102 photons , into the second one , with respectively @xmath259 photons , concomitantly altering the atomic momentum in @xmath260  the second term represents the inverse process , i.e. the reemission of a photon from the second wave into the first wave , accompanying it with a @xmath162 atomic momentum change .",
    "the physical reason of differences between the mentioned rates is solely the bosonic nature of photons .",
    "direct comparison shows the dominance of reemission of photons from  more photon ",
    "wave into the  less photon  wave , which finally results in equalization of mean photon numbers in both counterpropagating travelling waves @xcite .",
    "hence , in attained stationary states the mean field momentum approaches zero .",
    "thus , both analyzed cases possess diverse mechanisms of approaching to stationary state , but the final results are similar in the sense , that since one of the coupling subsystems , atom or field , is  immovable  or  frozen  , the mean momentum of the other subsystem unavoidably approaches zero .  speaking in fancy form ,",
    "the  immovable  part of the system takes on itself the  surplus  of the momentum from the other subsystem .  a clear and expected result .  in cpw - case with a moving atom , however , this result is not the general case .",
    "the reason is the conservation of system s momentum .  in this case",
    "the system evolves under action of both mechanisms .",
    "first of them , the diffraction , tends to suppress the mean atomic momentum , whilst second one , the bosonic nature , in contrary , tends to suppress the difference between the mean numbers of counterpropagating travelling waves .",
    "since they are not possible simultaneously ( except the case @xmath229 ) , in the course of time they mature the stationary states with definite , asymmetric in general , statistical distributions , where these tendencies are mutually compatible .",
    "the role of bosonic mechanism however is essential in the quantum - optic domain ( @xmath261 ) and gradually diminishes out of it .    to conclude this section",
    ", we would like to make a notice about one unavoidable peculiarity of tavis - cummings - type approximation , with respect to adiabaticity of interaction .  taking the photon momentum as a continuous variable ,",
    "we have suppressed the size of its quantum up to zero ( as small as possible ) .",
    "thereby we make feasible the arbitrary small variations in the energy of atomic c.m . motion .  as a consequence ,",
    "any as small as possible variation of the field intensity ( more concrete of parameter @xmath16 ) should cause changes in atomic c.m .",
    "motion and breaks down the adiabatic approximation .  because of this , the approximate solutions ( [ 34 ] ) and ( [ 36 ] ) , in contrast to exact eqs .",
    "( [ 15a ] ) , ( [ 15b ] ) or ( [ 18a ] ) , ( [ 18b ] ) , can not be adiabatically related to the free system s state .",
    "continuous quantum transition in atomic c.m .",
    "motion completely  washes out  the information about the initial state and its energy .",
    "really , the switching off of interaction ( @xmath262 ) in tavis cummings - type solutions leads to only one @xmath263 value of energy and to one corresponding probability amplitude with @xmath264  photons in the first travelling wave and the rest @xmath265 photons in the second travelling wave .",
    "it is necessary , however , to clearly realize that the parameters @xmath76 and @xmath38 preserve their physical essence as parameters of initial state ; they are determined by the relations ( [ 7 ] ) , ( [ 10 ] ) and ( [ 13 ] ) ( in cpw - case ) and are @xmath16-independent .",
    "simply , the tavis - cummings - type approximation interrupts any , even adiabatic , connection of the stationary state with the initial one .",
    "the parameters @xmath76 and @xmath38 can be used in this approximation as externally ( additionally ) given ones , and in case of necessity can be corroborated by means of exact equations .",
    "these resonances , bragg and doppleron , have been identified for an atom moving in a standing wave @xcite and have got implementations in atom optics and laser cooling @xcite .  here",
    "we would consider only the limit of small intensities , focusing on the role of multiphoton recoil energy .",
    "some preliminary words , for reminding , how these resonances are being extracted from equations .",
    "thinking of the limit @xmath262 as a leading one to the initial state , one should put a corresponding condition on the initial state amplitudes .",
    "for example , if @xmath266and @xmath59 photons in cpw and the atom is on the ground level , then @xmath267  as a consequence , we get from ( [ 15a ] ) the value of the free system energy , @xmath268 here the atomic momentum @xmath38 is arbitrary .",
    "when in contrary , the limit @xmath269 is thought of as a transition to the final free state , we may only confirm the equality of energy to its ( [ 44 ] ) free value .",
    "it follows from the conservation of energy .  also taking into account the relations ( [ 7 ] ) and ( [ 10 ] ) , from eqs .",
    "( [ 15a ] ) , ( [ 15b ] ) we directly arrive at @xmath270 or @xmath271    the solution with @xmath272 and respectively @xmath273 returns the system into the initial state .",
    "the next solution with @xmath274 gives a sole nonzero value for @xmath275 ground - level amplitude .",
    "corresponding to this case final atomic momentum ( see the wave function ( [ 11 ] ) ) @xmath276 which is the condition for bragg scattering .",
    "the third possible solution of ( [ 45 ] ) and ( [ 46 ] ) occurs at @xmath277 and has a sole nonzero solution for the corresponding excited - level amplitude @xmath56 .",
    "this is the case of doppleron - resonance scattering , when the atom leaves the zone of interaction on excited energy level @xcite .",
    "let us stop our attention on doppleron - resonance condition ( [ 48 ] ) in order to examine the behavior of final momentum @xmath278 versus the initial momentum @xmath38 .  to this",
    "end the condition ( [ 48 ] ) may be viewed as a dependance of @xmath102 on @xmath38 and then put into the excited - atom final momentum expression @xmath279  computation gives @xmath280 where the atomic initial momentum satisfies the doppleron resonance condition ( [ 48 ] ) . for",
    "a fixed frequency value @xmath4 the allowed values of initial momentum @xmath38 constitute a discrete set , corresponding to the integer values of @xmath281 in ( [ 48 ] ) .",
    "graphs of ( [ 49 ] ) are plotted in fig.[fig.9 ] .  for comparison we also plot the graphs without the recoil energy term ( the last one in ( [ 48 ] ) ) .",
    "as we can see , the presence of recoil energy dramatically changes the character of @xmath282 dependance .",
    "the first distinctive feature is in splitting of possible values of @xmath278 for every @xmath38 into two branches , herewith converging the high - order resonances ( @xmath283 ) @xmath284to the bragg resonances ( @xmath285 in the additional branch .",
    "the second difference is the lack of resonances in small atomic momentum range ( @xmath286 ) and connected with it , the convergence of @xmath278  to zero at the limiting point with @xmath287  it means that the inherent possibilities of the doppleron - cooling really are more than it follows from the theory , not including the recoil energy term .",
    "we analyze the stationary states of jcm with sw and cpw fields , treating the external , as well as the internal , atomic coordinates quantum - mechanically .",
    "the inspection shows essential deviations between sw- and cpw - cases in quantum optics range ( @xmath288 ) , which first of all have qualitative character .  as a such matter",
    "can be noted the deterioration of the concept of quasimomentum , the asymmetry and narrowing of momentum distribution , the coincidence of photonic and atomic momentum distributions in cpw - case .",
    "since the physical reason of the mentioned differences is the existence of the momentum conservation , it can be concluded that the modern cavity qed an the theory of measurement , being developed on the base of quantized sw - cavities , in fact have only dealt with the conservation of energy .",
    "the cavity qed and related problems for ring cavities , where the momentum conservation exists too and has to alternate the state - pattern in",
    " atom+field ",
    "system , need a performance , yet .",
    "moreover , the experimental confirmation just of cpw - case regularities , stationary or not , may be adopted as the direct nonmediated evidence for the photon momentum to be quantized .",
    "reexamination of kinematic resonances shows that due to recoil energy term the doppleron - resonance splits into two branches and , which is more important , can not take place in the range of small incident kinetic energies ( where @xmath289 ) .",
    "this work was supported by istc grant a - 215 - 99 .",
    "the case of immovable atom ( @xmath290 ) is a separate one for stationary state problem and its analysis is not logical on the basis of eqs .",
    "( [ 15a ] ) , ( [ 15b])@xmath136 the  reason  for  such  a  separation is that the @xmath62 and @xmath29 operators loose the inherent physical contents and must be omitted . instead of them",
    "enters a new , commutative with @xmath291 and  @xmath292 photonic operator  @xmath284@xmath293 which has the eigenstates @xmath294 @xmath295    it is referred to as an operator of interference , in the sense that its eigenvalues play the same role in the quantized - field picture as the term @xmath296 in the classical field picture of interaction @xcite .",
