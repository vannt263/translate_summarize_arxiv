    "the study of granular crystals draws on ideas from condensed matter physics , solid mechanics , and nonlinear dynamics .",
    "a granular crystal consists of a tightly packed , uniaxially compressed array of solid particles that deform elastically when in contact with each other .",
    "one - dimensional ( 1d ) granular crystals have been of particular interest over the past two decades because of their experimental , computational , and ( occasionally ) theoretical tractability , and the ability to tune the dynamic response to encompass linear , weakly nonlinear , and strongly nonlinear behavior by changing the amount of static compression @xcite .",
    "such systems have been shown to be promising candidates for many engineering applications , including shock and energy absorbing layers @xcite , actuating devices @xcite , acoustic lenses @xcite and sound scramblers @xcite .",
    "intrinsic localized modes ( ilms ) , which are also known as discrete breathers ( dbs ) , have been a central theme for numerous theoretical @xcite and experimental studies @xcite for more than two decades .",
    "granular crystals provide an excellent setting to investigate such phenomena further .",
    "recent papers have begun to do this , considering related topics , e.g. , metastable breathers in acoustic vacuum @xcite , localized oscillations on a defect that can occur upon the incidence of a traveling wave @xcite , and an investigation of the existence and stability of localized breathing modes induced by the inclusion of  defect \" beads within a host monoatomic granular chain @xcite ; for earlier work see e.g. the reviews of  @xcite .",
    "very recently , we reported the experimental observation of dbs in the weakly nonlinear dynamical regime of 1d diatomic granular crystals @xcite .",
    "in @xcite we describe the characteristics of the db to be a few number of particles oscillate with a frequency in the forbidden band ( i.e. , the gap ) of the linear spectrum , with an amplitude which decreases exponentially from the central particle .",
    "we took advantage of a modulational instability in the system to generate these breathing modes , and found good qualitative and even quantitative agreement between experimental and numerical results .",
    "it is the aim of the present paper to expand on these investigations with a more detailed numerical investigation of the existence , stability and dynamics of dbs in a diatomic , strongly compressed granular chain . in this paper , we examine two families of dbs lying within the gap of the linear spectrum ( or discrete gap breathers - dgbs ) . by varying their frequency ,",
    "dgbs can subsequently be followed as a branch of solutions .",
    "the family that is centered around a central light mass and has an asymmetric energy profile can potentially be stable sufficiently close to the lower optical band edge before becoming weakly unstable when continued further into the gap .",
    "other solutions , such as the family that is centered around a central heavy mass and has a symmetric energy profile seem to always be unstable .",
    "we examine both light and heavy mass centered families using direct numerical simulations .",
    "the study of dgb has importance both for increasing understanding of the nonlinear dynamics of strongly compressed granular elastic chains , and for the potential to enable the design of novel enginnering devices .",
    "for instance , in the past there have been several attempts to design mechanical systems to harvest or channel energy from ubiquitous random vibrations and noise of mechanical systems @xcite .",
    "however , a drawback of such attempts has been that the energy of ambient vibrations is distributed over a wide spectrum of frequencies .",
    "our recent experimental observation of intrinsic ( and nonlinear ) localized modes in chains of particles @xcite opens a new possible mechanism for locally trapping vibrational energy in desired sites and harvesting such long - lived and intense excitations directly ( e.g. , by utilizing piezo - materials @xcite ) .",
    "the remainder of this manuscript is structured as follows : we first report the theoretical setup for our investigations and discuss the system s linear spectrum .",
    "we then give an overview of the families of the dgb solutions that we obtain and present a systematic study of their behavior , categorized into four regimes relating to the frequency and degree of localization of these solutions .",
    "finally , we summarize our findings and suggest some interesting directions for future studies .",
    "we consider a 1d chain of elastic solid particles , which are subject to a constant compression force @xmath0 that is applied to both free ends as shown in fig .",
    "[ setup ] .",
    "the hamiltonian of the system is given by @xmath1\\ , , \\label{hamilton}\\ ] ] where @xmath2 is the mass of the @xmath3th particle , @xmath4 is its displacement from the equilibrium position in the initially compressed chain , and @xmath5 is the interaction potential between particles @xmath3 and @xmath6 .",
    "we assume that stresses lie within the elastic threshold ( in order to avoid plastic deformation of the particles ) and that the particles have sufficiently small contact areas and velocities , so that we can make use of tensionless , hertzian power - law interaction potentials . to ensure that the classical ground state , for which @xmath7 , is a minimum of the energy @xmath8",
    ", we also enforce that the interaction potential satisfies the conditions @xmath9 , @xmath10 .",
    "the interaction potential can thus be written in the following form @xcite : @xmath11_{+}^{n_{i}+1}-\\alpha_{i , i+1}\\delta_{i , i+1}^{n_{i } } , v(\\phi_{i})=\\frac{1}{n_{i}+1}\\alpha_{i , i+1}[\\delta_{i , i+1}+\\phi_{i}]_{+}^{n_{i}+1}-\\alpha_{i , i+1}\\delta_{i , i+1}^{n_{i}}\\phi_{i}-\\frac{1}{n_{i}+1}\\alpha_{i , i+1}\\delta_{i , i+1}^{n_{i}+1}\\ , , \\label{hertzpot}\\ ] ] where @xmath12 is the initial distance ( which results from the static compression force @xmath0 ) between the centers of adjacent particles .",

    "it is the interplay of this weak nonlinearity with the discreteness of the system that allows the existence of the dgb . to describe this regime , we take a power series expansion of the forces ( up to quartic displacement terms ) to yield the , so - called , @xmath39 model : @xmath40\\ , , \\label{k2k3k4}\\ ] ] where @xmath41 is the linear stiffness , @xmath42 , and @xmath43 .      for dynamical displacements with amplitude much less than the static overlap @xmath44",

    "the resulting diatomic chain of masses coupled by harmonic springs is a textbook model for vibrational normal modes in crystals @xcite .",
    "its dispersion relation contains two branches ( called _ acoustic _ and _ optical _ ) . at the edge of the first brillouin zone  i.e .",

    "the linear spectrum possesses a gap between the upper cutoff frequency @xmath49 of the acoustic branch and the lower cutoff frequency @xmath50 of the optical branch .",
    "the upper cutoff frequency of the optical band is located at @xmath51 .",
    "in addition to acoustic and optical modes , the diatomic semi - infinite harmonic chain also supports a gap mode , provided the existence of a light particle at the surface and the use of free boundary conditions .",
    "this mode is localized at the surface ( i.e. , at the first particle ) and its displacements have the following form @xcite : @xmath52 with @xmath53 , frequency @xmath54 in the gap of the linear spectrum and b an arbitrary constant .",
    "thus , the surface mode decays exponentially with a characteristic decay length of @xmath55    a standard derivation of the surface mode is given in ref .",
    "@xcite , while a simple physical explanation of its existence and characteristics can be found in ref .",
    "the latter is summarized as follows : adjacent pairs vibrate in such a way that the connecting spring is not stretched .",
    "thus each pair experiences no force from any other particle and is decoupled from the rest of the chain .",
    "the resulting decoupled pairs oscillate with @xmath56 .",
    "this particular mode with frequency in the band gap , localized around the surface , proves to have a nonlinear counterpart and be very closely related to the dgb in the strongly discrete regime as we describe in later sections .      in our experiments from @xcite and numerical simulations",

    "the _ close to the optical _ regime contains the only strictly linearly stable modes ( la - dgb ) .",
    "the _ moderately discrete _ regime includes ( but is larger than ) the aforementioned region of strong instability for the la - dgb , and is the region within which our experimentally observed la - dgb @xcite falls .",
    "the _ strongly discrete _ regime shows a change in spatial displacement profile ( in both families ) with respect to the other regimes , which ( as will be discussed ) is connected to large time loss of contact between adjacent beads ( gap openings ) and the existence of gap surface modes , and is unique to our tensionless contact potential .",
    "the _ close to and slightly inside the acoustic band _ regime shows resonances with the upper acoustic band edge , and ( for the hs - dgb ) a resulting period doubling bifurcation .",
    "we now continue , by conducting a detailed investigation of both dgb families in the four different regimes .      regime ( i ) is located very close to the lower optical band edge of the linear spectrum .",
    "as we mention above , the hs - dgb family of solutions starts to exist from @xmath76 hz and below , while the la - dgb family of solutions is initialized from the linear limit at the lower edge of the optical band . in this regime ,",
    "both dgb solutions are characterized by a localization length @xmath77 that is much larger than the characteristic localization length @xmath78 of the surface mode .",
    "the dgb spatial profiles have the form of the spatial profile of the optical cutoff mode and the la - dgb family is linearly stable .",
    "moreover , as indicated by the relative displacements of the solutions in regime ( i ) , we can also conclude that @xmath79 , so the dynamics of the system is weakly nonlinear and the adjacent particles are always in contact ( gaps do not open between particles ) .",
    "it should be noted that despite the linear stability , this similarity in frequency and spatial profile to the lower optical cutoff mode could make this regime of dgb difficult to observe experimentally and differentiate from the linear mode .    in this regime , since both dgb solutions are characterized by a small amplitude and a large localization length @xmath77 , the effect of the discreteness is expected to be weak .",
    "continuous approximation techniques ( see , for example , ref .",
    "@xcite ) have revealed that the dynamics of the envelope of the solutions close to the optical band is described by a focusing nonlinear schrdinger ( nls ) equation .",
    "hence , the two types of dgbs can be viewed as discrete analogs of the asymmetric gap solitons that are supported by the nls equation that is obtained in the asymptotic limit .    in this regime , due to the weak effect of the discreteness for @xmath75 ,",
    "a third pair of floquet multipliers appears in the vicinity of the point @xmath80 on the unit circle .",
    "this is in addition to the two previously discussed pairs of floquet multipliers relating to the phase mode and conservation of momentum .",
    "this third mode is the mode associated with the _ breaking _ of the continuous translational symmetry ( i.e. , there is a discrete translational symmetry / invariance in the limit of small lattice spacing ) .",
    "the associated floquet multiplier is of particular interest , as it has been associated with a localized mode called a  translational \" or  pinning \" mode @xcite .",
    "perturbing the la - dgb solution along this corresponding floquet eigenvector enables us to obtain the hs - dgb family of solutions ( essentially translating light mass centered dgb by one site to a heavy centered dgb ) .",
    "we call regime ( ii ) _",
    "moderately discrete_. in this regime , the localization length @xmath77 of the two dgb solutions is smaller than in the case of regime ( i ) , so the effect of discreteness becomes stronger . in regime ( ii )",
    ", we find that @xmath81 near the central bead . as a result",
    "this regime also has a larger kink - shaped distortion of the chain ( i.e. , displacement differential between the left and right ends of the chain ) .",
    "this kink shaped distortion , which is visible in panel ( a ) of fig .",
    "[ ha_8600 ] , is a static mutual displacement of the parts of the chain separated by the dgb , and is a characteristic of db solutions in anharmonic lattices that are described by asymmetric interparticle potentials ( see for exmaple @xcite ) .",
    "the larger amplitude also translates into a gap opening for the contact(s ) of the central particle for a small amount of time .",
    "the response of the system can be considered as strongly nonlinear near the central bead of the breather and weakly nonlinear elsewhere .",
    "as the frequency is decreased throughout this regime , the effect of the discreteness becomes stronger and the previously discussed  pinning \" mode moves away from the point @xmath80 on the unit circle ; it moves along the unit circle for the la - dgb solution and along the real axis for the hs - dgb solution ( which causes a strong real instability in the latter case ) . for @xmath82",
    "both dgb families are subject to strong harmonic ( and real ) instability .",

    "this is also important with respect to the experimental observation in @xcite .",

    "( [ e : left1bc],[e : right1bc ] ) instead of the spatial profiles characterizing the dgb in the other regimes .    a possible explanation for the change of the spatial profiles of the dgbs is the following . near the center of the strongly discrete dgbs , we find that @xmath102    from a physical perspective , this means that there is a large amount of time ( in contrast to what we observe in the moderately discrete regime ) during which some beads near the center of the dgb lose contact with each other due to the tensionless hertzian potential .",

    "furthermore , it should be indicated that if the frequency deviates from the frequency of a linear surface gap mode , this phenomenology persists with the sole modification being that instead of the linear surface gap mode , during gap openings , we observe a nonlinear variant thereof with a progressively modified spatial profile .",
    "computation of the floquet spectrum associated with linear stability shows that the hs - dgb modes in this regime continue to be subject to the strong real instability .",

    "in contrast to the optical gap boundary , at which the dgb solutions delocalize and then vanish , we find in the acoustic boundary of the gap that the solutions delocalize , but persist with the addition of non - zero oscillating tails ( see top panels of fig.[dogb ] ) .",
    "these arise from resonance of the dgbs with the upper acoustic cutoff mode .",
    "the new bifurcated solutions are called _ discrete out - gap breathers _ ( dogbs ) .",

    "the dgbs transform into dogb solutions with non - zero tails that have the form of the upper acoustic cutoff mode .",
    "the appearance of such modes , which are associated with resonances of the dgbs with the linear mode , can occur in general in finite - size systems in which the phonon spectrum is discrete .",
    "they can be observed when the dgb frequency ( or one of its harmonics ) penetrates the phonon band .",
    "other kinds of dgb solutions with different non - zero tails are generated when the second harmonic of the dgb penetrates the optical band from above .",

    "in this work , we have presented systematic computations of the intrinsically localized excitations that diatomic granular crystals can support in the gap of its spectrum between the acoustic and optical band of its associated linearization ( linearizable under the presence of static compression ) .",
    "we have examined two families of discrete gap breather ( dgb ) solutions .",
    "one of them consists of heavy - symmetric dgbs ( hs - dgb ) , and the other consists of light - asymmetric dgb ( la - dgb ) , where the symmetric / asymmetric characterization arises from the spatial profiles of their energy distributions .",
    "we found that the hs - dgb branch of localized states is always unstable through the combination of an omnipresent real floquet - multiplier instability and occasional oscillatory instabilities .",
    "we showed that the la - dgb solutions have the potential to be stable as long as their frequency lies sufficiently close to the optical band edge .",
    "for lower frequencies , we observe within a small frequency interval that a real instability and also more broadly weak oscillatory instabilities render this solution weakly unstable , although in this case the solutions still might be observable for very long times .",
    "we explored the progressive localization of the solutions upon decreasing the frequency within the gap , and we discussed the regimes of weak , moderate , and strong discreteness at length .",
    "we showed a unique spatial profile of dgb with strong discreteness , and their similarity to linear gap surface modes .",
    "finally , in a specific frequency interval near the acoustic band edge of the linear gap , we also found a period - doubling bifurcation and described its associated instability . in the future",
    "it should be interesting to explore whether additional families of dgbs ( including solutions that do not bifurcate from the linear limit ) can exist in 1d or higher dimensional granular crystals .",

    "<S> we present a systematic study of the existence and stability of discrete breathers that are spatially localized in the bulk of a one - dimensional chain of compressed elastic beads that interact via hertzian contact . </S>",
    "<S> the chain is diatomic , consisting of a periodic arrangement of heavy and light spherical particles . </S>",
    "<S> we examine two families of discrete gap breathers : ( 1 ) an unstable discrete gap breather that is centered on a heavy particle and characterized by a symmetric spatial energy profile and ( 2 ) a potentially stable discrete gap breather that is centered on a light particle and is characterized by an asymmetric spatial energy profile . </S>",
    "<S> we investigate their existence , structure , and stability throughout the band gap of the linear spectrum and classify them into four regimes : a regime near the lower optical band edge of the linear spectrum , a moderately discrete regime , a strongly discrete regime that lies deep within the band gap of the linearized version of the system , and a regime near the upper acoustic band edge . </S>",
    "<S> we contrast discrete breathers in anharmonic fpu - type diatomic chains with those in diatomic granular crystals , which have a tensionless interaction potential between adjacent particles , and highlight in that the asymmetric nature of the latter interaction potential may lead to a form of hybrid bulk - surface localized solutions . </S>"
