    "the geometry of principal bundles plays an important role in theoretical physics .",
    "it is the natural framework to model the fundamental interactions between point particles in classical field theory , and is the startpoint for the quantum field theory @xcite .",
    "moreover in nonrelativistic quantum physics , the geometric ( berry ) phase phenomenon @xcite is closely related to this geometry .",
    "a principal bundle naturally arises to treat cyclic quantum dynamics @xcite or adiabatic quantum dynamics driven by classical parameters @xcite .",
    "these physical problems are associated with the holonomies or the horizontal lifts of paths drawn on the base manifold of the principal bundle .",
    "+ the horizontal lifts of surfaces can not be defined within the framework of principal bundles .",
    "the interest for the horizontal lifts of surfaces arises from the development of the string and brane theories , in which the string and brane gauge theory is associated with holonomies of surfaces @xcite .",
    "recently , we have shown that the geometric phases associated with quantum systems submitted to some decoherence processes take place in higher gauge theories @xcite .",
    "+ geometric realizations of abelian higher gauge theories are well understood , as gerbes with connection @xcite , bundle gerbes @xcite or twisted bundles @xcite . for the non - abelian higher gauge theories , some generalizations of these geometric realizations have been proposed : non - abelian gerbes with connection @xcite , non - abelian bundle gerbes @xcite and non - abelian twisted bundles @xcite .",
    "we can also cite the higher gauge structure arising in the study of the principal composite bundles @xcite . in these approaches ,",
    "the total space of the geometric structure is not a smooth manifold as in the usual gauge theory but a category . for some of these approaches ,",
    "the structure group is also replaced by a structure which can be viewed as a category ( as for example an extension of lie groups ) .",
    "another interesting approach of non - abelian higher gauge theories has been proposed by baez _",
    "et al _ and wockel : the 2-bundles @xcite . in this approach ,",
    "the structure group is replaced by a lie crossed module .",
    "the different approaches seem to be equivalent @xcite . the strategy followed by baez _",
    "et al _ to define the 2-bundles is very interesting since it is based on the idea consisting to substitute at each smooth manifold a geometric category called a 2-space .",
    "unfortunately this goal seems unachieved since in the 2-bundle theory the base space is restricted to the trivial 2-spaces ( a trivial 2-space is an usual manifold @xmath0 viewed as a category @xmath1 with @xmath2 and @xmath3 ) .",
    "the reason of this restriction is the difficulty to define a `` 2-cover '' of a 2-space . indeed",
    "the definition of the union of two open sub-2-spaces is not clear since it needs to know how to compose an arrow in one 2-space with an arrow in another one .",
    "the trivial 2-spaces are very poor categories since they have only identity arrows .",
    "+ in this paper , inspirated by the 2-bundle theory , we propose a new theory of categorical bundles with a bigger class of 2-spaces that we call the affine 2-spaces .",
    "it includes the trivial 2-spaces but also categories with non - trivial arrows .",
    "moreover the union of two affine open sub-2-spaces is clearly defined .",
    "the affine 2-spaces are introduced in the next section .",
    "section 3 introduces the 2-bundles over affine 2-spaces and explores their algebraic and geometric properties .",
    "in particular we show that the structure is more rich than the usual 2-bundle theory , since a new kind of 1-transition functions appears .",
    "2-bundles over affine 2-spaces are endowed with connective structures in section 4 , and the horizontal lifts are considered in section 5 .",
