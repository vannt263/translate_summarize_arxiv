    "the sauter - schwinger effect @xcite , i.e. electron - positron pair production due to a strong electric field , is a fundamental prediction of quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) that has not been verified experimentally yet .",
    "although sauter calculated the pair production rate for two different configurations of the electric field already more than 80 years ago @xcite , the effect of the electric field s spacetime dependence on sauter - schwinger pair creation is far from being fully understood yet .",
    "several methods have been developed for computing approximations to the pair production rate , such as the wkb method @xcite or the worldline - instanton method @xcite , but most of them are focusing on the case of solely time - dependent electric fields . in this paper , we present a new method that promises to overcome this fundamental restriction .",
    "we start by expanding solutions of the dirac equation using solutions of the eikonal ( or hamilton - jacobi ) equation , giving two linear coupled partial differential equations .",
    "an approximative solution to these equations is then attained under the assumption that the number of produced electron - positron pairs is small .",
    "finally , we calculate the pair production rate for a truly spacetime - dependent field .",
    "we start with the covariant dirac equation @xmath0 \\psi = 0,\\ ] ] where @xmath1 are the components of a possibly spacetime - dependent electromagnetic potential and @xmath2 are the gamma matrices satisfying the clifford algebra s anticommutation relation @xmath3 we define two operators @xmath4 with @xmath5 being two independent solutions of the eikonal equation @xmath6 we then have @xmath7 thus , the operators @xmath8 both have the two distinct eigenvalues @xmath9 .",
    "let @xmath10 and @xmath11 be their respective eigenvectors defined as follows @xmath12 upon expanding the spinor @xmath13 in terms of the solutions of the eikonal equation , @xmath14 the dirac equation reduces to @xmath15 in @xmath16 dimensions it suffices to use @xmath17 matrices .",
    "we choose @xmath18 using these , the operators @xmath8 have the following form @xmath19 we can write the eigenvectors @xmath10 and @xmath11 as follows @xmath20 where @xmath21 note that @xmath22 multiplying with @xmath23 leads to @xmath24 using the identities from this can be written as @xmath25 to transform this into partial differential equations for @xmath26 and @xmath27 we want to project this equation onto the eigenvectors @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "we define several quantities that will simplify the resulting expressions : @xmath30 note that the @xmath31 can also be written as follows @xmath32 other scalar products of the eigenvectors with their derivatives can be expressed using the quantities defined above @xmath33 finally , projecting onto @xmath28 and @xmath29 leads to the following two coupled partial differential equations for @xmath26 and @xmath27 @xmath34 ,    \\end{aligned }    \\label{eq : alphaeq } \\\\[3 mm ]    & \\begin{aligned }      { \\operatorname{\\partial}_{t}^ { } } \\beta = -i \\xi_x^- \\beta + e^{i \\left ( s_+ - s_- \\right ) } \\bigg [        & -\\eta { \\operatorname{\\partial}_{t}^ { } } \\alpha - i \\chi { \\operatorname{\\partial}_{x}^ { } } \\alpha \\\\        & + \\left ( \\chi \\xi_t^+ - i \\eta \\xi_x^+ \\right ) \\alpha \\bigg ] .    \\end{aligned }    \\label{eq : betaeq}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] note that these equations are fully equivalent to the covariant dirac equation we started with .",
    "as solving the coupled partial differential equations given in and is hard , especially in the presence of spacetime - dependent electric fields , we proceed with an approximative approach .",
    "we assume that the electric field is switched off initially ( i.e. for @xmath35 ) and finally ( i.e. for @xmath36 ) , so that the solutions of the eikonal equation correspond to plane waves initially and finally , i.e. @xmath37 where @xmath38 and @xmath39 are the energy and the momentum of the particle respectively . here",
    "we have employed the convention that @xmath40 and @xmath41 correspond to the solution that has positive and negative energy initially respectively .",
    "when the strength of the electric field is subcritical , we expect @xmath27 ( i.e. the coefficient of the negative - energy solution ) and its derivatives to be much smaller than @xmath26 ( i.e. the coefficient of the positive - energy solution ) and its derivatives .",
    "thus in this case , is approximately equivalent to @xmath42 which can be integrated easily , giving @xmath43.\\ ] ] inserting this expression into allows us to calculate a solution for @xmath27 within our approximation : @xmath44 where we have used @xmath45    \\label{eq : theta}\\ ] ] as an abbreviation . upon defining @xmath46,\\ ] ] can be integrated as well , giving @xmath47 with @xmath48 , \\\\",
    "\\xi(t , x ) & = -i \\int_{-\\infty}^{t } \\left ( \\xi_x^+ - \\xi_x^- \\right ) { \\ : \\mathrm{d}^ { } t ' \\ : } \\\\      & = \\int_{-\\infty}^{t } { \\operatorname{\\partial}_{x}^ { } } \\left ( \\operatorname{artanh}a_+ - \\operatorname{artanh}a_- \\right ) { \\ : \\mathrm{d}^ { } t ' \\:}.    \\end{aligned }    \\label{eq : sxi}\\ ] ] finally , we find that @xmath49 thus , we see that a solution @xmath50 that consists of a positive - energy plane wave only initially , @xmath51 finally evolves into a mixture of positive- and negative - energy plane waves , @xmath52 therefore , the pair production density is given by @xmath53 the total number of created pairs for a specific initial momentum can then be calculated by integrating over all @xmath54 .",
    "if the electric field does only depend on the time @xmath55 , we can use the temporal gauge @xmath56 , @xmath57 .",
    "two independent solutions of the eikonal equation are then given by @xmath58 where @xmath59 thus , in this case the pair production density simplifies to @xmath60 { \\",
    ": \\mathrm{d}^ { } t \\:}\\right|}^2.\\ ] ] comparing this to equation ( 12 ) in @xcite , we find that the only relevant difference between these two expressions is the prefactor of the integrand . this can be attributed to the different approximations that were made when deriving these formulae .",
    "however , exactly because of those approximations , we do not expect the integral in to give the correct prefactor for the pair production rate but only the exact exponent anyway .",
    "our general strategy for solving the integral in will be as follows : we try to find the analytic continuation of the integrand in @xmath55 and solve the integral by methods of contour integration .",
    "thus , we have to choose a appropriate integration contour and determine the singularities of the integrand . as @xmath5 are linear functions of time @xmath55 for @xmath61 according to , the integrand in is suppressed exponentially in the lower half - plane by the factor @xmath62 $ ] . therefore , we choose a semi - circle in the lower half - plane with key holes for avoiding any singularities and branch cuts as our integration contour .    however , often we are only interested in the exponent of the pair production density  as well because we do not expect the prefactor to come out right with the approximations we made . to leading order ,",
    "the pair production density integral in is dominated by the value of the exponential factor @xmath63 at the singularity in the lower half - plane that is closest to the real axis .",
    "looking at and the definitions of @xmath64 and @xmath65 in and respectively , we see that the integrand s only singularities can be where @xmath5 or @xmath66 have got singularities , or where @xmath67 or @xmath68 is @xmath69 .",
    "using the definition of @xmath66 ( see ) , we can conclude that @xmath66 can only have singularities where @xmath5 or @xmath1 are singular , or where the denominator @xmath70 vanishes . inserting @xmath71 into the @xmath16-dimensional eikonal equation",
    ", @xmath72 reveals that in that case @xmath73 .",
    "thus , if the denominator of @xmath66 vanishes , the numerator will either be @xmath74 or vanish , too . in the first case",
    "@xmath66 will have a pole at that point while in the second @xmath66 is of the indeterminate form @xmath75 .",
    "let us assume now that the latter occurs at @xmath76 for either @xmath67 or @xmath68 .",
    "we then can evaluate the limit of @xmath66 as @xmath55 approaches @xmath76 using the eikonal equation and lhspital s rule to show that @xmath66 is actually well - defined at @xmath76 : @xmath77    furthermore , from the definition in we know that the @xmath66 are either @xmath78 or @xmath79 if and only if @xmath80 inserting the eikonal equation in @xmath81 dimensions into this gives , after some manipulation , @xmath82 but from the calculation above we already know that @xmath66 vanishes where @xmath83 , so we can conclude that the @xmath66 are nowhere equal to @xmath78 or @xmath79 .    in conclusion , the only possible singularities of the integrand in are    * singularities of @xmath5 , * singularities of @xmath1 so that @xmath66 is singular , * poles where @xmath71 and @xmath84 .",
    "note that because @xmath85 and @xmath70 correspond to energy and momentum of a classical particle respectively , the points where @xmath84 and @xmath71 are the classical turning points of an electron .",
    "to solve the eikonal equation in the presence of spacetime - dependent fields we employ an inverse approach . in order to do this ,",
    "we write the two independent solutions @xmath5 using two other functions @xmath86 and @xmath87 , which are defined according to @xmath88 applying a gauge transformation @xmath89 eliminates the dependency on the symmetric part @xmath86 . inserting this into the eikonal equation gives @xmath90 from now on , we drop the primes on the potential components . solving the two equations given in for @xmath91 and @xmath92 leads to @xmath93 where the @xmath94 sign denotes two different sets of solutions that can be generated using the same function @xmath87 .",
    "the @xmath95 given here have poles where @xmath96 vanishes , branch points where @xmath97 and other singularities where @xmath87 is singular .",
    "however , the @xmath66 do not have poles where @xmath98 , as can be seen by expanding the fraction in the expression for @xmath66 by @xmath96 .",
    "therefore in this case , the only possible singularities of the integrand in are    * singularities of @xmath5 , * branch points where @xmath97 , * poles where @xmath71 and @xmath84 .",
    "to demonstrate how our method can be used to estimate the pair production rate in the presence of spacetime - dependent fields , we guess a ( somewhat artificial ) solution to , @xmath99 and calculate the components of the electromagnetic potential using ; we chose the solutions with a negative sign here . using these ,",
    "the initial and final frequencies and momenta can be calculated : @xmath100 the electric field can then be computed from @xmath101 for the function @xmath87 chosen here , it consists of a ( asymmetric ) pulse whose amplitude depends oscillates with the spatial coordinate @xmath54 ( see figure [ fig : sqrtqe ] ) .",
    "it should be noted that the electric field @xmath102 for the @xmath87 given in can be indeed calculated analytically but the result is a rather lengthy expression that will be left out here for the sake of brevity .    , @xmath103 , @xmath104 , @xmath105 , and @xmath106 .",
    "]    it can be shown that in this case the dominant singularity of the pair production integral is the branch point due to the square root in @xmath87 at @xmath107 in addition , for this example @xmath108 everywhere .",
    "therefore , the pair production density to leading order is given by @xmath109\\right|}^2 \\\\      & = \\exp \\left [ -4\\frac{\\omega_\\mathrm{in}+\\omega_\\mathrm{out}}{2\\omega }        \\sqrt{1 + \\varepsilon \\frac{\\omega^2}{m^2 } \\cos ( 2 \\kappa x ) } \\right ] .",
    "\\end{split }    \\label{eq : ppdsqrt}\\ ] ]",
    "we have developed a new method for approximating the pair production rate in the presence of arbitrary spacetime - dependent fields that resembles much of the wkb - like approach that is pursued in the formalism based on the riccati equation @xcite .",
    "the method relies on being able to find solutions of the eikonal equation in the presence of spacetime - dependent fields which is not an easy task per se . however using an inverse approach , solutions for electric fields depending on both @xmath55 and @xmath54",
    "can be generated . as was shown in the last section , such solutions",
    "may then be analyzed to calculate an approximation to the pair production rate .",
    "still , our toy example given there exhibits a flaw that is not obvious from the plot in figure [ fig : sqrtqe ] alone : due to how the inverse approach works , the expression for the electric field @xmath102 still depends on all of the parameters of @xmath87 .",
    "for example , the strength of the electric field can not be changed without changing @xmath110 or @xmath111 and vice versa . therefore , a statement about how the pair creation rate for a specific mode depends on the field strength for this pulse form can not be made .      nevertheless , the expression for the pair production density given in is within expectations : pair production is less likely for higher frequencies ( i.e. momenta ) and becomes highly probable if the pulse width is of the order of the electron s frequency , i.e. @xmath112 , thereby entering the regime of non - perturbative pair production .",
