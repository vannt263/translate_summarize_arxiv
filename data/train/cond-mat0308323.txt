    "a variety of memory effects have been reported in the optical emission of single semiconductor quantum dots .",
    "@xcite many of these effects occur on millisecond timescales , including blinking ,  @xcite two - color blinking ,  @xcite and spectral diffusion .",
    "@xcite evidence suggests that millisecond blinking , seen only in a small minority of quantum dots , is caused by nearby defects .",
    "@xcite however , we have previously reported a much faster type of blinking that occurs in a majority of quantum dots subject to resonant optical excitation .",
    "@xcite this blinking behavior appears as a positive correlation in two - photon coincidence measurements .",
    "blinking has also been observed in diamond color centers ,  @xcite semiconductor nanocrystals ,  @xcite and in molecules .",
    "@xcite in our case , the correlation timescale depends on the laser excitation power , but can vary from less than 10  ns to at least 800  ns .",
    "this article presents a detailed study of these fast memory effects .",
    "in addition to presenting data on the blinking of quantum dots under resonant excitation , we report for the first time negative photon correlations with timescales greater than 100  ns for quantum dots under pulsed excitation with the laser tuned above the bandgap of the host semiconductor . from a physical viewpoint ,",
    "studying these complimentary memory effects can provide valuable information about the states of a quantum dot , the transitions between them , and especially the nature of the optical excitation process . from a practical viewpoint ,",
    "blinking effects reduce the efficiency of quantum - optical devices based on single dots , @xcite and also bring into question whether quantum dots are stable enough for use in proposed quantum computation schemes that involve optical control .",
    "@xcite understanding the mechanisms responsible for these effects is a first step toward being able to suppress them .",
    "both negative and positive correlations over long timescales can be explained reasonably well through a simplified model presented later in this article .",
    "memory effects imply multiple long - lived configurations of the quantum dot , and our analysis suggests that these are likely states with differing total charge . as explained below , negative correlations occur because above - band excitation injects electrons and holes into the dot separately , whereas positive correlation ( blinking ) occurs because resonant excitation injects electrons and holes together , in pairs .",

    "the purpose of the optical microcavity was to enhance the photon collection efficiency and to decrease the spontaneous emission lifetime through the purcell effect .",

    "it is also possible that for one or more of these dots , the studied emission line could be a trion ( charged exciton ) transition . in those cases",
    "our model should still apply ( after changing the labels in fig .",
    "[ f_ladder ] ) , but it would not be surprising if the values of the fitting parameters were different .    the curves in figs .",
    "[ f_abfits](b ) and  [ f_resfits](b ) were obtained by fitting eq .",
    "[ eq_finalmodl_b ] to the data using the values of @xmath44 already obtained and using @xmath45 as a fitting parameter .",
    "the fits do not match the data perfectly , a sign that the model is too simple .",
    "the saturation regime ( @xmath81 ) is difficult to model accurately , since a large number of states are involved .",
    "the model does correctly predict that @xmath26 tends to zero for large excitation powers , as observed in the data .",
    "the parameter @xmath45 has practical importance , since according to eq .",
    "[ eq_modlsat ] , the maximum internal efficiency at the selected wavelength is @xmath82 .",
    "it should be cautioned , however , that using this formula with the fitted values of @xmath45 may not give the correct efficiency in the saturation regime , where the model is least accurate .",
    "an important question is why the charge of a quantum dot should ever change when the excitation wavelength is tuned below the gaas bandgap and below the inas wetting layer band edge .",
    "this could be related to the `` wetting layer tail '' observed in ple spectra .",
    "this feature has been attributed to continuum states associated with the combined wetting layer - quantum dot system .",
    "@xcite if these states are not localized to a single quantum dot , electrons and holes excited into these states by a laser pulse could be captured by different quantum dots , changing their charges , for example .",
    "it has also been suggested that an auger - type process , which would allow an electron to escape from the quantum dot , could play an important role in the relaxation of electron - hole pairs from excited states .",
    "@xcite two - photon processes are an unlikely mechanism when the excitation power is far below saturation .",

    "we have observed sub - microsecond memory effects in quantum - dot photoluminescence on two samples , one with optical microcavities and one without .",
    "other groups have not yet reported similar behavior , but other studies have not , to our knowledge , explored pulsed resonant excitation , or pulsed above - band excitation far below the saturation level , the two regimes important in our study .",
    "these memory effects imply the existence of multiple long - lived states , which are most likely states with different total charge . if this interpretation is correct , it is apparently difficult to prevent the charge of a semiconductor quantum dot from changing during optical excitation .",
    "fluctuations in the charge of a quantum dot could pose serious difficulties for proposed applications .",
    "light emitters based on single quantum dots will have reduced internal efficiencies at a particular wavelength .",
    "even though the blinking seems to disappear at large excitation powers in photon correlation measurements , our model suggests that the efficiency still suffers , due to the presence of multiple configurations .",
    "optically induced charge fluctuations could also be problematic in schemes for quantum computation that involve optical control of single charges or excitons .",
    "better stability might be achieved using laser excitation resonant with the fundamental exciton transition .",
    "we did not attempt this because of the difficulty of removing scattered laser light , but at least one group has performed single - dot measurements under these conditions .",
    "@xcite another option might be to design the optical excitation process so that the transition rate into an unwanted configuration is much smaller than the transition rate out of it . in this case",
    ", the quantum dot would spend most of its time in the desired configuration .",
    "finally , if charge fluctuations are , in fact , related to continuum states , then fabrication of quantum dots with a low density and without a wetting layer might be advantageous .    supported in part by muri ucla/0160-g - bc575 .",
