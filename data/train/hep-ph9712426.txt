    "the first muon collider ( fmc ) will reach a maximum center of mass energy of 500 gev , exploring all the interesting intermediate regimes . in a second phase , the @xmath2 collider should upgrade its energy to up to 4 tev and therefore become a very high energy lepton collider , even compared to nlc .",
    "a high energy lepton collider will be a very promising environment to look for _ new physics _ beyond the standard model ( sm ) , taking advantage of the large enough energy which will become available at low background rates .",
    "as has become common knowledge by now , the great advantage of a @xmath2 machine will be to allow the study of the @xmath1-channel production of scalar _ higgs like _ particles , which should occur at a much more conspicuous rate with respect to an @xmath3 collider ( @xmath4 )",
    ".    a very important and direct application of this property will be the study of the higgs sector of both the sm and its supersymmetric ( susy ) extensions , looking for positive or negative evidence of the scalar and pseudoscalar particles which are theoretically predicted in these models .",
    "even if evidence is found at a different machine ( for instance a hadron collider ) , a @xmath2 machine will offer an optimal energy resolution to sit at resonance and study the properties of these particles , i.e. their masses and their couplings .",
    "this subject has been thoroughly covered in some plenary talks @xcite and dedicated parallel sessions @xcite during this workshop .    along these lines , we want to discuss here the possibility of further studying the properties of the scalar sector of the sm as well as of many of its extensions , susy included , by looking for _ anomalous _ flavor changing neutral currents ( fcnc ) induced by scalar exchange .",
    "it is well known that any extended scalar sector containing identical replicas of the same representation of scalar fields ( for instance : n identical doublets or n identical pairs of doublets , etc . ) can induce fcnc at the tree level .",
    "this is due to the possibility of diagonalizing the mass matrix of the fermion fields without diagonalizing each single fermion - scalar coupling .",
    "the interest in models containig many identical generations of scalars ( sometimes even in a one - to - one correspondence with the generations of fermions ) arises in many string - inspired grand unified models ( for instance @xmath5 ) and is therefore of a more general interest .    in order to be more predictive and to limit the number of parameters in our analysis , we focus on a minimal extension of the scalar sector of the sm , a two higgs doublet model ( 2hdm ) .",
    "this can be used as a simple model , which we are able to work out to the very last consequences in order to study the compatibility of its predictions with the existing experiments . on a more general ground",
    ", our analysis should provide useful hints for a diversity of extensions of the sm , which both theorist and experimentalist are encouraged to study .",
    "since fcnc are forbidden in the sm , their study can provide us with unambiguous evidence of _ new physics_. however , severe constraints are imposed by the low energy physics of the @xmath6- and @xmath7-mesons , such that fcnc have practically to be avoided in this sector of the theory .",
    "this is naturally accomplished by the sm itself via the gim mechanism , and has to be imposed _",
    "ad hoc _ in any 2hdm , by introducing a discrete symmetry@xcite , which limits the possible yukawa couplings between fermions and scalars .",
    "apart from the experimental constraints coming from @xmath6- and @xmath7-physics , there is no _ a priori _ theoretical reason not to have fcnc .",
    "therefore , the assumption of this _ ad hoc _ discrete symmetry may be dropped in favor of a more natural one , which takes any flavor changing ( fc ) coupling to a scalar field to be proportional to the mass of the coupled fermions .",
    "the basic idea is that a natural hierarcy is provided by the observed fermion masses and this may be transfered to the couplings between fermions and scalar fields @xcite . in this way",
    ", fcnc are naturally suppressed in the light sector of the theory , while dramatic effects may be seen in processes which involve the heavy quark fields of the third generation , i.e. the top quark .",
    "we illustrate these ideas at work in the following sections , first presenting the model we refer to @xcite and then focusing on some fc signals , namely @xmath8-production which , if possible at an @xmath3-collider @xcite , is even more enhanced and distinctive at a @xmath2-collider @xcite .",
    "we explicitly consider in this context only the quark fields , assuming that the discussion of the quark and lepton sectors of the theory can proceed independently .",
    "then , let us consider the quark yukawa lagrangian of a 2hdm , which we write as ,    @xmath9    where @xmath10 , for @xmath11 , are the two scalar doublets of a 2hdm ( @xmath12 ) , while @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the non diagonal matrices of the yukawa couplings .    in order to prevent fcnc to arise at the tree level , the scalar potential and yukawa lagrangian need to be constrained by an _",
    "ad hoc _ discrete symmetry @xcite ,    @xmath15    depending on whether the up - type and down - type quarks are coupled to the same or to two different scalar doublets respectively , one obtains the so called model  i and model  ii 2hdm s . @xcite .",
    "in contrast we want to consider the case in which no discrete symmetry is imposed and both up - type and down - type quarks then have fc couplings . for this type of 2hdm ,",
    "that we call model  iii , the yukawa lagrangian for the quark fields is as in eq .",
    "( [ e : lreina:1 ] ) and no term can be dropped _ a priori _ , see also refs .  @xcite .",
    "since the two scalar doublet are completely independent , by a suitable rotation of the quark fields , we can chose the two scalar doublets in such a way that only the @xmath16 couplings generate the fermion masses , i.e. such that    @xmath17    to the extent that the definition of the @xmath18 couplings remains arbitrary , we will denote by @xmath18 the new rotated couplings , such that the charged couplings look like @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "this form of the charged couplings is indeed peculiar to model  iii compared to models  i and ii and can have important phenomenological repercussions @xcite .",
    "the scalar physical mass spectrum consists of two charged @xmath21 and three neutral spin 0 bosons , two scalars ( @xmath22 ) and a pseudoscalar ( @xmath23 ) ,    @xmath24 \\nonumber \\\\",

    "finally , we want to introduce some definite ansatz that will guide us in our phenomenological approach to the study of model  iii .",
    "because the yukawa lagrangian directly breaks the flavor symmetry among quarks , and this ultimately results into fermion mass generation , some major proposals exist in the literature@xcite which suggest to take the new fc couplings to be proportional to the mass of the quarks involved in the coupling , i.e.    @xmath31    where for the sake of simplicity we take the @xmath32 to be real ( for more details see @xcite ) . in this",
    "ansatz the residual degree of arbitrariness of the fc couplings is expressed through the @xmath32 parameters , which need to be constrained by the available phenomenology . in particular we will see how @xmath33 and @xmath34 mixings ( and to a less extent @xmath35 mixing ) put severe constraints on the fc couplings involving the first family of quarks .",
    "there is no doubt that the most interesting signals of these non - standard couplings are to come from the physics of the top quark , both production and decays .",
    "therefore , we would like to single out the right processes and the right environment in which we could already have the possibility of testing the consequences of our assumptions .",
    "the existence of fc couplings is very much constrained by the experimental results on @xmath36 flavor mixings ( for @xmath37 and to a less extent @xmath38 )    @xmath39    due to the presence of new tree level contributions to each of the previous mixings .",
    "we have analyzed the problem in detail in ref .",
    "@xcite , taking into account both tree level and loop contributions .",
    "indeed the two classes of contributions can affect different fc couplings , due to the peculiar structure of the charged scalar couplings ( see previous section ) .",
    "we find that , unless for scalar masses in the multi - tev range , the tree level contributions need to be strongly suppressed , requiring that the corresponding fc couplings are much than one .",
    "enforcing the ansatz made in eq .",
    "( [ e : lreina:5 ] ) , this amounts to demand that    @xmath40    more generally , we can assume that the fc couplings involving the first generation are negligible .",
    "particular 2hdm s have been proposed in the literature in which this pattern can be realized @xcite .",
    "the remaining fc couplings , namely @xmath41 and @xmath42 are not so drastically affected by the @xmath43 mixing phenomenology . from the analysis of the loop contributions to the @xmath36 mixings ( box and penguin diagrams involving the new scalar fields ) , we verify that many regions of the parameter space are compatible with the results in eq .",
    "( [ e : lreina:6 ] ) @xcite . therefore we may want to look at other constraints in order to single out the most interesting scenarios .",
    "three are in particular the physical observables that impose strong bounds on the masses and couplings of model  iii @xcite    * the inclusive branching ratio for @xmath44 , which is measured to be @xcite + @xmath45 * the ratio @xmath46 , whose present measurement @xcite is such that @xmath47 ( @xmath48 ) , + @xmath49 * the corrections to the @xmath50 parameter , which has become conventional to describe in terms of + @xmath51 + where @xmath50 absorbs all the sm corrections to the gauge boson self energies and , in the presence of new physics , @xmath52 summarizes the deviation from the sm prediction ( i.e. @xmath53 ) . from the recent global fits of the electroweak data , which include the input for @xmath54 from ref .",
    "@xcite and the new experimental results on @xmath55 , @xmath56 turns out to be very close to unity .",
    "this imposes severe constraints on many extension of the sm , especially on the mass range of the new particles .    since the experimental determination of @xmath55 is not completely definite , we demand less strict agreement between @xmath57 and @xmath58 . in this case",
    "we find compatibility with the present experiments for    @xmath59    the value of the mixing angle @xmath25 is not determinant , while the masses are mainly dictated by the fit to @xmath60 and @xmath61 @xcite .",
    "we are left with two possible scenarios ,    @xmath62    we conclude that , given the existing constraints , model  iii has the very interesting characteristic of providing sizable fc couplings for the top quark , in a way that will certainly be testable at the next generation of lepton and hadron colliders .",
    "we will discuss some of these phenomenological issues in the next section .",
    "if we assume eq .",
    "( [ e : lreina:12 ] ) , @xmath41 becomes the most relevant fc coupling .",
    "the presence of a @xmath41 flavor changing coupling can be tested by looking at both top decays and top production ( see ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "it is interesting that the first upper bounds on @xmath63 ( @xmath64 ) are now coming from recent experimental analysis @xcite ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for the corresponding theoretical prediction in model  iii ) . encouraged by this progress , we want to concentrate here on top - charm production . the sm prediction for top - charm production",
    "is extremely suppressed and any signal would be a clear evidence of new physics with large fc couplings in the third family .",
    "the final state for this process has a unique kinematics , with a very massive jet recoiling against an almost massless one ( very different from a @xmath65 production signal , for instance ) .",
    "this quite distinctive signature may allow to work even with relatively low statistics , as can be the case for a lepton collider .",
    "the much better statistics one could get at an hadron collider , would come at a cost of a much higher background ( mostly , tree level sm background for a one - loop process ) .",
    "a nice analysis of the hadron collider case is presented in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "here we want to focus on lepton colliders and in particular on the case of the fmc . in principle , the production of top - charm pairs arises both at the tree level , via the @xmath1-channel exchange of a scalar field with fc couplings , and at the one loop level , via corrections to the @xmath66 and @xmath67 vertices .",
    "the @xmath1-channel production is not relevant for an @xmath3 collider , because the coupling of the scalar fields to the electron is very suppressed ( @xmath68 ) .",
    "an interesting proposal for a @xmath69-channel production via @xmath70-fusion at a @xmath71 tev @xmath3 collider has been pointed out in ref .",
    "however , top - charm production at an @xmath3 collider remains mainly a loop effect and therefore ( even at the energies of nlc ) it is suppressed with respect to the corresponding production cross section at the fmc ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) and in particular at the very high energy muon collider .",
    "in fact , for a @xmath2 collider , the @xmath1-channel top - charm production via a neutral scalar / pseudoscalar is a nice example of the kind of resonance production we briefly discussed in the introduction . at resonance , the new scalars (",
    "let us denote them generically by @xmath72 ) may be produced at an appreciable rate , and the effective cross section for any final state very much depends on the relation between the beam energy resolution and the width of the scalar particle ( @xmath73 ) produced in the @xmath1-channel @xcite .",
    "following @xcite , we define the effective cross section as the convolution of the breit - wigner @xmath74 cross section with a gaussian beam energy spread ,    @xmath75 } { \\sqrt{2\\pi}\\sigma}\\,\\sigma^{bw}_{tc}(s^\\prime)\\,\\,\\,\\ , , \\label{e : lreina:14}\\ ] ]    where the rsm of the gaussian distribution is defined in terms of the _ resolution _",

    "we use the set of parameters posted for this workshop .",

    "case we clearly see how our result depends on @xmath76 and how for smaller values of @xmath76 the predictions get closer and closer to the pure breit - wigner case . for @xmath100 the branching ratio is smaller due to the @xmath70 and @xmath101 threshold at about the same mass as the @xmath107 threshold and so @xmath105 is around @xmath108 . in this case",
