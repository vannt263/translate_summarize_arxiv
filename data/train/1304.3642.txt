    "more than 50 years ago , several studies on the analytic structure of feynman amplitudes were published @xcite that shed light on the occurrence of the spectral threshold . here",
    "we apply this long - known technique to two - point functions at one - loop order in euclidean space .",
    "thereby very general analytic structures of the loop integrands are permitted which allows to employ a large class of propagators known in closed form for perturbative calculations , as well as to extend this to non - perturbative equations which need to be solved self - consistently . in principle",
    "this is straightforward , but as we applied this technique to various problems in recent studies @xcite and are using it in an ongoing non - perturbative study of the quark propagator , we will provide details of the technique here .",
    "the applicability of cutkosky s cut rules in euclidean space is discussed also in @xcite using the inverse stieltjes transformation .",
    "the arguments presented here , on the other hand , are based directly on the loop integral and the analytic structure of the integrand .    to start with ,",
    "consider a two - point function which is expressed in euclidean momentum space at one - loop order .",
    "in the perturbative case , such a two - point function might be written as @xmath0 where @xmath1 denotes the ( euclidean ) dimension , @xmath2 is some loop momentum and @xmath3 the angle enclosed by the momenta @xmath4 and @xmath2 .",
    "the non - perturbative case will be addressed in section [ fitted ] . for convenience ,",
    "the integrand is expressed as a fraction of two functions @xmath5 and @xmath6 , which provides access to the poles of the integrand via the zeros of @xmath7 , assuming that the zeros of @xmath6 lead to integrable singularities .",
    "note that in general such integrals are divergent and need to be renormalized , _",
    "e.g. _ , via bphz . in the following",
    "we assume that eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) is a renormalized expression .    in euclidean space , the momentum - space integral ( [ eq1 ] ) might be written in @xmath8-dimensional hyper - spherical coordinates ( here we consider @xmath1 , a generalization to arbitrary @xmath8 is straightforward ) .",
    "regardless of the dimension @xmath8 , the number of integrals in equation ( [ eq1 ] ) reduces from @xmath8 to 2 .",
    "we thus integrate over the square of the inner momentum @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "the expression reduces to @xmath11 with @xmath12 and @xmath13 is the uv cutoff .",
    "note that the factor of @xmath14 , as well as the constant contributions of the trivial integrals have been absorbed into the function @xmath15 .",
    "when @xmath16 instead of @xmath17 , a thorough analysis of the analytic structure in the @xmath18-complex plane allows for the prediction of non - analyticities of the result .",
    "the latter we will identify with branch points .    when @xmath19 is not on the positive real axis , the integration in @xmath18 is no longer straightforward and it becomes necessary to deform the integration contour .",
    "as long as it is possible to integrate from @xmath20 to @xmath13 without hitting any obstructions like branch cuts , the result is analytic .",
    "non - analyticities in @xmath19 arise , when this is prohibited by obstructions in the @xmath18-plane .",
    "these can be poles but also branch cuts induced by the angle integration .",
    "the latter arise when integrating over the ( integrable ) singularities of the angle integral .",
    "how this comes about can be illustrated in a very simple example .",
    "consider the following integral for complex values of @xmath18 , where @xmath21 , @xmath22 with the particular ( but arbitrary ) choice of @xmath23 we find that a branch cut arises for @xmath24}$ ] , see fig .",
    "[ fig : bc ] .",
    "this branch cut is present because @xmath25 picks up the singular values of the integrand .",
    "branch cut for complex values of @xmath18 as obtained from equation ( [ eq3]).,title=\"fig:\",width=151]branch cut for complex values of @xmath18 as obtained from equation ( [ eq3]).,title=\"fig:\",width=113 ] [ fig1 ]    this situation is of course much simpler than for physical examples , but it already features a branch cut which is induced by the @xmath25-integral and shows up in the complex @xmath18-plane .",
    "furthermore , we learn that we do not have to perform the angular integral in order to predict the branch cut structure in the @xmath18-plane .",
    "it is sufficient to find all complex values of @xmath18 for which the integrand becomes singular .",
    "thus , in view of equation ( [ eq2 ] ) , the parametrization of the branch cut in the complex @xmath18-plane for given @xmath16 reads @xmath26 where @xmath27 are the zeros of the denominator for given complex @xmath19 , parametrized by @xmath25 , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath28 is a solution w.r.t .",
    "@xmath18 of @xmath29}. \\label{eq5}\\ ] ] solving equation ( [ eq5 ] ) yields _ all _ branch cuts in a parametrized form as given in ( [ eq4 ] ) , as well as _ all _ purely @xmath18-dependent non - analyticities .",
    "in general there are both , poles and cuts .",
    "non - analyticities in @xmath19 arise when the restrictions imposed on the contour of @xmath18 do not allow a proper deformation of the contour .",
    "these are the points we are after . to identify them we need to find the values of @xmath19 , where such a contour deformation is not possible .",
    "this happens when an endpoint of a branch cut coincides with a pole and/or an endpoint of the solely @xmath18-dependent non - analyticities of the integrand . from this one",
    "can also see how the discontinuity at the branch cut develops : depending on which side of the branch point a point @xmath19 lies , the integration contour has necessarily a different shape and the value of the integral is not continuous across the branch cut ; see fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] for an example .",
    "we can summarize the procedure to identify the branch points as follows :    * * step 1 : * find _ all _ non - analyticities of the @xmath18-integrand .",
    "@xmath30 cuts and poles in the @xmath18-plane .",
    "* * step 2 : * find the points @xmath31 where the endpoints of the induced cuts coincide with other non - analyticities in the @xmath18-plane which depend only on @xmath18 @xmath30 candidates for branch points . * * step 3 : * check if the @xmath18-contour can be deformed properly for any @xmath31 from step 2 .",
    "if not , @xmath31 is a branch point @xmath32 .",
    "to confirm the results from the mass - summation formula of @xcite , let us consider a generic correlator with two masses @xmath33 and @xmath34 , @xmath35 where @xmath36 is a function constructed out of the lorentz invariants .",
    "switching to hyper - spherical coordinates we have @xmath37 with the usual identifications @xmath12 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "all constants have been absorbed into @xmath38 . according to the procedure outlined above",
    ", we need to determine the zeros of the denominator to get parametrizations for the cuts ( step 1 ) . in this case the solution can be easily worked out analytically and yields @xmath39 according to step 2 we solve @xmath40 and @xmath41 for @xmath42 with respect to @xmath19 .",
    "this yields the following branch point candidates : @xmath43 the solution with the minus sign does not interfere with the integration contour ( see fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) so that we are left with @xmath44 this agrees with the result of @xcite if we use it for euclidean momenta , _",
    "i.e. _ , if we plug in negative squares of the masses there : @xmath45 for an example with complex masses see @xcite .",

    "the procedure outlined in the section above proved to be useful in perturbative studies where the analytic continuation was performed numerically . the branch point location(s )",
    "obtained from this analysis served as a check for the numerics . in @xcite ,",
    "the case of complex conjugate masses was studied , while in @xcite complex conjugate masses as well as a propagator featuring a cut with a singular endpoint were considered . for the complex conjugate poles ,",
    "all three resulting branch points have been found by this procedure .",
    "note that one of them is time - like and thus corresponds to the physical multi - particle threshold , while two are complex .",
    "due to the existence of the latter no klln - lehmann representation is possible .",
    "the next step is a self - consistent determination of propagators and their analytic structure in the non - perturbative regime of qcd , _",
    "e.g. _ , as input for bound - state equations .",
    "several studies of the non - perturbative properties of green functions using dyson - schwinger equations ( dses ) have been published , see @xcite for recent examples . in an ongoing study we are looking into the analytic properties of the quark propagator dse in landau gauge .        since the structure of the r.h.s . of the equation depicted in fig .",
    "[ qprop ] is an integral of a similar form as in eq .",
    "( [ eq2 ] ) , the same procedure can be used .",
    "the additional complication of such a calculation is that the integral depends on the quantity on the l.h.s .",
