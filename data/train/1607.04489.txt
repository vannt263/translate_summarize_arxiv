    "in a non - central relativistic heavy - ion collision , an ultra - strong magnetic field will be produced inside the participant zone by energetic spectator protons  @xcite .",
    "on average , the magnetic field is perpendicular to the so - called  reaction plane \" ( rp ) that contains the impact parameter and the beam momenta .",
    "this strong magnetic field , coupled with quantum anomalies , will cause a series of novel non - dissipative transport effects that could survive the expansion of the fireball and be detected in experiments . for a review on these subjects , see ref .",
    "furthermore , the initial magnetic helicity of the collision system can be quite large , and bears opposite signs in the upper- and lower - hemispheres .",
    "it was recently realized  @xcite that owing to the chiral anomaly , the helicity can be transferred back and forth between the magnetic flux and fermions as the collision system evolves , so that the magnetic helicity could last long enough to yield photons with opposite circular polarizations in the hemispheres above and below the rp .",
    "this local imbalance of photon circular polarization could be observed in experiments , e.g. , by studying the polarization preference w.r.t the rp for photons that convert into @xmath0 pairs . in this paper",
    ", we discuss a few practical thoughts of carrying out such a measurement , first for photons and then for vector mesons .",
    "photon circular polarization can be measured with dedicated polarimeters  @xcite , by studying the count rate asymmetries with a local magnet .",
    "such a setup is infeasible for large - scale heavy - ion experiments like the relativistic heavy ion collider or the large hadron collider , as the local magnet will complicate the magnetic field that is used for the track detection of charged particles .",
    "nevertheless , one can still probe photon circular polarization by tracking @xmath0 pairs from photon conversion .",
    "a photon will not decay by itself .",
    "however , when a photon is near an atomic nucleus , its energy can be converted into an electron - position pair .",
    "panels a ) and b ) in fig .  [",
    "fig : cartoon1 ] show the typical conversion process for left and right circularly polarized photons , respectively . here",
    "@xmath1 is the angle of the electron relative to the positron , when both are projected onto the plane perpendicular to the motion direction of the photon .",
    "owing to the opposite circular polarizations , the preferred direction orderings between the emitted electron and positron are opposite in the two cases .",
    "the cross - section for the pair production by completely circularly polarized high - energy photons is given as  @xcite d1 a , where the @xmath2 and @xmath3 signs are for right and left circularly polarized photons , respectively .",
    "@xmath4 is a positive quantity dependent on the photon energy and the energies and momenta of its two daughters , as well as the atomic number @xmath5 of the recoiling nucleus .    in the presence of the magnetic helicity effect ,",
    "the yields of left and right circularly polarized photons can each be parametrized as a sine wave modulation w.r.t .",
    "the rp , which is similar to the directed flow ( @xmath6 )  @xcite that is modulated by a cosine wave .",
    "furthermore , the sine coefficients have the same magnitude and opposite signs for left and right circularly polarized photons . with this parametrization scheme ,",
    "the effect of the magnetic helicity aforementioned is strongest in the direction perpendicular to the rp ( along the direction of the magnetic field ) , and weakest in the rp , and so is the difference in yield between the two groups of photons .",
    "the cross - sections for right and left circularly polarized photons can be written separately as d_r & & ( 1 + a ) ( 1 + b ) + d_l & & ( 1 - a ) ( 1 - b ) , where @xmath7 is the photon s azimuthal angle relative to the rp , and @xmath8 ( @xmath9 $ ] ) represents the magnitude of the modulation .",
    "the total cross - section is the sum of @xmath10 and @xmath11 : d1 + h , where @xmath12 , and @xmath13 $ ] .",
    "@xmath1 , @xmath7 are both experimentally measurable quantities , so in principle @xmath14 can be obtained from the cross - section measurement .",
    "a finite @xmath14 implies a finite @xmath8 or a finite effect of modulation w.r.t the rp due to the external magnetic field .",
    "note that only the modulation w.r.t rp carries the information of the asymmetry between left and right circularly polarized photons , so other sources of photons ( mostly from hadron decays ) do not contribute to @xmath14 as long as they are produced symmetrically w.r.t rp in terms of the left - right circular polarization .",
    "generally speaking , photons can have other finite fourier coefficients , e.g. , @xmath6 and @xmath15  @xcite , but they do not couple with @xmath14 as long as we assume those coefficients are the same for left and right circularly polarized photons .",
    "the ( in)efficiency as a function of @xmath7 angle can be easily compensated in experiments , as long as the rp distribution and the azimuthal angle distribution of photons in the laboratory frame are flattened , which is a common procedure when analyzing anisotropic flow  @xcite .",
    "we also assume that the efficiency as a function of @xmath1 can be measured by usual monte carlo studies with individual experiment setups .",
    "taking the difference in yield - probability between the upper hemisphere and the lower hemisphere , y_up - down^ & = & _ 0 ^ - _ ^2 + & & 4hand the difference between the left hemisphere and right hemisphere ( separated by @xmath16 ) would be zero owing to the symmetry of the system : y_left - right^ & = & _ ^ - _ -^ + & = & 0 , which can be regarded as a consistency check in experiments .",
    "note that when there is no signal , @xmath17 , and a finite efficiency @xmath18 will not cause an artificial , finite @xmath19 .    in heavy - ion collider experiments , photons",
    "are usually reconstructed at secondary vertices where they strike detector materials and emit @xmath0 pairs .",
    "the photon sample is inevitably contaminated by combinatorial background formed by random @xmath0 pairs",
    ". however , the background contribution should be symmetric w.r.t both @xmath20 and @xmath16 plane , and be canceled in this procedure by taking the difference in yield between up and down ( or left and right ) hemispheres .",
    "the same argument also holds for the study of vector mesons discussed below .",
    "unlike photons that can be only transversely polarized ( with the spin direction either parallel or anti - parallel to the momentum direction ) , vector mesons can be both longitudinally and transversely polarized .",
    "below , we describe a procedure to measure a potential difference , if a similar effect exists , between left and right circular polarizations for vector mesons , as well as a way to study the variation of such a difference w.r.t the rp . the procedure is applicable to vector mesons decaying into two daughters , that includes @xmath21 , @xmath7 , @xmath22 etc . the earlier the particle is produced , the better it experiences the magnetic helicity that happens at the very early time ( a few @xmath23 ) of the collision .",
    "in addition , the lighter the particle , the easier for it to be polarized by the magnetic field . in the end what particle to choose for this study is a balanced decision between the particle s production time , mass , the purity of the data sample , and the statistics available .",
    "the latter two factors vary from one experiment to another .",
    "the polarization of vector mesons can be studied with the distribution of its decay products in azimuthal and polar angles ( for example , for @xmath22 particle see  @xcite ) in a chosen coordinate system ( frame ) .",
    "the four popular choices of frame are the particle rest frame  @xcite , the gottfried - jackson frame  @xcite , the center - of - mass helicity frame  @xcite , and the collins - soper frame  @xcite . however , no discussion is given in  @xcite to distinguish the left and right circular polarizations , both belonging to transverse polarization .",
    "our discussion will be limited to the center - of - mass helicity frame only . in the helicity frame",
    "@xcite , the orientation of the polar axis is set to be the opposite of the direction of motion of the interaction point ( the flight direction of the quarkonium itself in the center - of - mass of the colliding beam ) . the illustration of the helicity frame and the definition of polar angle ( @xmath24 ) is given in fig .",
    "[ fig : cartoon2 ] .    as a side remark , the definition of transverse and longitudinal polarization for vector mesons is is commonly used , but counterintuitive .",
    "the definition is originated in analogy to a photon which is said to be _ transversely _ polarized with spin projection @xmath25 , owing to the fact that the em field carried by a photon oscillates in the transverse plane with respect to its momentum , while its spin is aligned along the momentum .",
    "_ longitudinal _ polarization means @xmath26 .",
    "we respect this convention in this paper .      without loss of generality ,",
    "let s assume the vector meson under discussion is a @xmath22 particle decaying into a @xmath0 pair . in the helicity frame ,",
    "the polar angle distributions of positrons for left - handed , longitudinal and right - handed @xmath22 can be written as  @xcite p_t_l & & ( 1-)^2 + p_l & & + p_t_r & & ( 1+)^2 . if one assumes the left - right symmetry and introduces @xmath27 $ ] , with @xmath28 representing the complete transverse ( longitudinal ) polarization , the polarization - summed cross - section can be expressed as p_pol_sum & & ( p_t_l + p_t_r ) + p_l + & & 1 + _ , with which we have recovered the formula to describe @xmath22 polarization in the polar angle in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "now we relax the assumption of the left - right symmetry , and introduce @xmath29 , where @xmath7 is @xmath22 s azimuthal angle relative to the rp , and @xmath30 ( @xmath9 $ ] ) represents the asymmetry in the emission of left and right circularly polarized @xmath22 w.r.t rp , p_pol_sum & & ( p_t_l + p_t_r ) + + & & p_l . with this definition ,",
    "when @xmath31 is 1 ( -1 ) , @xmath22 s are produced 100% with right ( left ) circular polarization .",
    "after normalization in @xmath24 space , @xmath32 is written in full form as : p_pol_sum & = & [ 5+_+4a(1 + _ ) + + ( 3_-1)2 ]    taking into account the modulation w.r.t .",
    "the rp due to the elliptic flow ( @xmath15 )  @xcite , the final probability in yield becomes y ( , ) = ( 1 + 2v_22)p_pol_sum .",
    "[ eq : yprob ]    in fig .",
    "[ fig : y3avalues ] , @xmath33 is shown for three different @xmath30 values .",
    "for a given @xmath24 , a finite @xmath30 value will distort the originally ( when @xmath34 ) symmetric @xmath22 production w.r.t .",
    "@xmath20 . in principle , the @xmath22 yield measured in @xmath35 spaces , if fitted with eq.([eq : yprob ] ) , can be used to extract @xmath30 .",
    "taking the difference in probability between the upper and lower hemispheres , y_up - down^j/ & = & _ 0^y ( ) - _ ^2 y ( ) + & = & ( 3 - 2v_2)(1 + _ ) .",
    "[ eq : y_ud_a ] note that eq.([eq : y_ud_a ] ) shows that @xmath36 could still be finite even if the transverse and longitudinal polarizations have equal possibility ( @xmath37 ) .",
    "again the difference between the left and right hemispheres ( separated by @xmath16 ) is y_left - right^j/ & = & _ ^ y ( ) - _ -^ y ( ) + & = & 0 .    when the detection efficiency is finite , eq.([eq : yprob ] )",
    "can be simply multiplied by @xmath38 , where @xmath39 and @xmath40 are efficiency functions of @xmath24 and @xmath7 , respectively . with a finite efficiency",
    ", @xmath36 does not take the simple form of eq.([eq : y_ud_a ] ) any more .",
    "however , similar to the case of photons , a finite efficiency @xmath39 will not cause an artificial , finite signal in @xmath36 . here",
    "we assume that the ( in)efficiency as a function of @xmath7 angle can be easily compensated in experiments , as long as the rp distribution and the azimuthal angle distribution of particles of interest in the laboratory frame are flattened , which is a common practice when analyzing anisotropic flow  @xcite .",
    "a more general physics case would not exclude the possibility that the portions of the longitudinal and transverse polarizations also vary w.r.t .",
    "the rp . to take this effect into account",
    ", one can introduce the rp dependence of @xmath41 in sec .",

    "we have shown that for massless photons , as well as vector mesons decaying into two daughters , the difference in the circular polarization preference between upper- and lower - hemispheres could be feasibly measured .",
    "we propose a scheme to carry out the measurement that quantifies the effect . in practice , there are other complications that need to be considered in experiments . for example",
    ", @xmath43 decays may dominate the photon production , effectively diluting the signal . in the end",
    "it is a competition between the strength of the signal and the dilution effect .",
    "similar dilution effects can happen to vector mesons due to the background contamination .",
    "the correction for dilution depends on the detailed experimental setup , which varies from one experiment to another , and is beyond the scope of this paper .",
