    "the understanding of the evolution of the nuclear properties with respect to the asymmetry between the number of neutrons and protons is one of the major topics of interest in modern nuclear physics .",
    "it is going to extend our knowledge about the effects of isospin asymmetry on the nuclear structure , and is also relevant for the study of the origin and the limits of stability of matter in the universe .",
    "nuclear reactions represent our main source of information on the properties and on the structure of atomic nuclei .",
    "direct nuclear reactions , where the external probe interacts with only one , or a few , nucleons of the target nucleus , can give deep insight on the single - particle ( s.p . )",
    "properties of a many - body system .",
    "in particular , the @xmath0  reaction , where a proton is emitted with a direct knockout mechanism , represents a very clean probe to explore thestructure pf the proton - hole states of the nucleus @xcite .",
    "electron scattering is probably the best tool for investigating the structure of atomic nuclei and their constituents .",
    "the electromagnetic interaction is weak if compared with the strength of the interaction between hadrons , therefore the nuclear many - body system is only slightly perturbed by the probe . in addition , the possibility of varying independently the energy and momentum transferred to the nucleus allows us to map the nuclear response as a function of the excitation energy with a space resolution that can be adjusted to the scale of processes we want to study .",
    "the theoretical description of the electron - nucleus interaction is well controlled by the perturbative quantum electrodynamics theory , and , for the energies used in nuclear physics investigations , the one - photon exchange approximation is usually enough to obtain a good description of the electron scattering process .",
    "the advantages of electron scattering have been exploited in the past to study the properties of stable nuclei .",
    "these studies can now be extended to exotic nuclear matter .    in the last thirty years a large amount of @xmath0  data has provided accurate informations on the s.p .",
    "structure of stable closed - shell nuclei .",
    "many high - resolution exclusive @xmath0  experiments on several stable nuclei were carried out at saclay  @xcite , nikhef  @xcite and mami  @xcite .",
    "specific quantum numbers and spectroscopic factors have been assigned to the peaks in the energy spectrum by studying the missing energy and momentum dependence of the experimental cross sections .",
    "the data analysis was carried out by using the program dweepy  @xcite which describes the process within the theoretical framework of the nonrelativistic distorted - wave impulse approximation ( dwia ) . in the program",
    "the effects of the final - state interactions ( fsi ) due to the reinteraction of the emitted proton with the remaining nucleus and also the distortion of the electron wave functions produced by the nuclear coulomb field are included .",
    "for the data analysis , phenomenological ingredients were usually adopted to calculate the s.p . bound and scattering states . in the original analyses of the experimental data ,",
    "the outgoing nucleon scattering wave functions were eigenfunctions of an optical potential determined through a fit to elastic unpolarized and polarized nucleon - nucleus scattering data .",
    "the bound - state wave functions were calculated with a woods - saxon ( ws ) well , where the radius was determined to fit the experimental momentum distribution and the depth was adjusted to give the experimentally observed separation energy of the bound final state .",
    "this theoretical approach was able to describe , with a high degree of accuracy , for a wide range of nuclei and for different kinematics , the shape of the experimental momentum distributions at missing - energy values corresponding to specific peaks in the energy spectrum . in order to reproduce the size of the experimental cross sections ,",
    "the normalization of the bound - state wave function was fitted to the data and identified with the spectroscopic factor .",
    "the deviations of such normalization factors from the predictions of the mean - field ( mf ) approximation are interpreted as the effect of nucleon - nucleon correlations .",
    "the description of @xmath0  processes was done also with relativistic dwia ( rdwia ) models @xcite . in these approaches",
    "bound - state wave functions are obtained by solving dirac - hartree equations with an interaction obtained by a relativistic lagrangian written in the context of the relativistic mf theory .",
    "the scattering wave functions are obtained by solving the dirac equation with relativistic optical potentials determined by a fit to elastic proton - nucleus scattering data .",
    "some of these models include also an exact treatment of the coulomb distortion of the electron waves @xcite .",
    "the rdwia calculations , which provide a good description of the old @xmath0  data , are necessary for the analysis of the more recent @xmath0  data from jlab @xcite , measured in kinematic conditions with higher values of the momentum transfer and of the outgoing proton energy , unachievable in previous experiments .    in upcoming years",
    "the advent of radioactive ion beams facilities @xcite will provide a large amount of data on unstable nuclei .",
    "a new generation of electron colliders that use storage rings is under construction at riken ( japan ) @xcite and gsi ( germany ) @xcite .",
    "these facilities will offer unprecedented opportunities to study the structure of exotic unstable nuclei through electron scattering in the elise experiment at fair in germany @xcite and the scrit project in japan @xcite .",
    "kinematically complete experiments , where all target - like reaction products are detected , will become feasible for the first time , allowing a clean separation of different reaction channels as well as a reduction of the unavoidable radiative background seen in conventional experiments .",
    "therefore , even applications to stable isotope will be of interest .    in this work",
    "we investigate how the models successfully used to describe @xmath0  data in stable nuclei behave when they are used to make predictions on exotic nuclei . in our study , we consider both the nonrelativistic ( dwia ) and the relativistic ( rdwia ) approaches , and we apply them to a set of calcium and oxygen isotopes .",
    "we have chosen these isotopes since data taken at nikhef for the doubly magic nuclei @xmath2ca , @xmath3ca @xcite , and @xmath1o @xcite are available .",
    "we first compare the performances of our models in describing these data , then we apply them to some even - even isotopes of these nuclei .",
    "we apply our models to @xmath4ca and @xmath5o nuclei , where the s.p .",
    "levels below the fermi surface are fully occupied . in this manner",
    "we work with spherical systems and minimize the pairing effects .",
    "our models require the description of both ground and excited states of the nuclear system , the latter one has a particle in the continuum . in this article , we investigate how different descriptions , apparently equivalent for stable nuclei , can produce different results when applied to neutron rich nuclei .",
    "the dwia calculations are carried out with the same code dweepy that was used for the analyses of the experimental data . in the comparison with data we repeat the original analyses and present the results of calculations performed under the same conditions as in refs . @xcite .",
    "the results obtained with phenomenological ws wave functions are compared with those obtained by solving hartree - fock ( hf ) equations with gogny - like finite - range interactions .",
    "the rdwia calculations are performed with the fully relativistic model developed in ref .",
    "the theoretical investigation of exotic nuclei with models of proven reliability in stable isotopes will test the ability of the established nuclear theory in the domain of exotic nuclei , revealing the evolution of nuclear properties as a function of the asymmetry between the number of neutrons and protons .",
    "moreover , it will provide valuable references for future experiments .",

    "our description of the @xmath0  reactions is based on the one - photon exchange approximation , where the incident electron exchanges a virtual photon , of momentum @xmath6 and energy @xmath7 , with the target nucleus @xcite . in this approximation ,",
    "the evaluation of the cross section requires the calculation of the contraction between the lepton tensor , that contains the electron current , and the hadron tensor , that contains the nuclear electromagnetic current . if we neglect the effects of the nuclear coulomb field on the electrons , the initial and final electron wave functions are plane wave solutions of the dirac equation . in this case",
    ", we can write the lepton tensor as a kinematical factor , and the hadron tensor as a bilinear product of the fourier transforms of the transition matrix elements of the nuclear electromagnetic current operator between the initial @xmath8 and final @xmath9 nuclear states @xmath10    if coulomb - distorted electron wave functions are considered in the model , the transition matrix element of the electron current replaces the exponential in eq .",
    "( [ eq : jm ] ) and the calculation becomes much more complicated @xcite . for the nuclei and the electron energies considered in this work , however , a simple and accurate enough method to include the effects of coulomb distortion is to preserve the expression  ( [ eq : jm ] ) but using an effective momentum transfer and change the momentum transfer into an effective momentum transfer @xcite .",
    "therefore in all the calculations presented in this paper we have used this approximation .",
    "the evaluation of the expression  ( [ eq : jm ] ) requires a model that describes the initial and final nuclear many - body states . a detailed description of our dwia model , and of the related assumptions ,",
    "can be found in refs .",
    "@xcite . in short",
    ", we assume that in the final state the residual nucleus , that is composed by @xmath11 nucleons , is left in a bound state @xmath12 , characterized by the energy @xmath13 and the quantum numbers @xmath14 .",
    "then , for the final nuclear state we select the channel subspace spanned by the wave function @xmath12 , describing the @xmath11 nucleons , and a function describing the state of the emitted nucleon . moreover , we assume the direct knockout mechanism , where the one - body nuclear electromagnetic current operator acts exclusively on the space spanned by this type of many - body states .",

    "this model can be formulated in both the dwia and the rdwia . in rdwia",
    "calculations four - vector relativistic wave functions for the initial bound and the final scattering states and , coherently , relativistic expressions for the nuclear current operator are used @xcite .",
    "we point out that in our dwia calculations some relativistic corrections are included in the kinematics and in the nuclear current operator .    formally , as described in refs .",
    "@xcite , the s.p . scattering and",
    "bound state wave functions are derived in the model of eq .",
    "( [ eq : dwia ] ) as eigenfunctions of an energy - dependent non - hermitean feshbach - type optical - model hamiltonian .",
    "such a consistent treatment is extremely difficult and , at present , bound and scattering states calculated from the theoretical optical potential are not available .",
    "for this reason , in actual calculations phenomenological wave functions are usually employed . in the nonrelativistic dwia calculations , the outgoing proton wave functions are eigenfunctions of the complex phenomenological energy - dependent and a - dependent optical potential of ref .",
    "@xcite , that contains a central and a spin - orbit term , and also a term dependent on the nuclear asymmetry @xmath25 .",
    "this is the same optical potential used in the original analyses of the nikhef data @xcite .",
    "we used this potential in all the dwia calculations done for the various isotopes we have investigated .    in our rdwia model , the ejectile wave function",
    "is written in terms of its positive energy component @xmath26 following the direct pauli reduction method  @xcite .",
    "this scheme appears simpler and it is equivalent to the solution of the dirac equation .",
    "the resulting schrdinger - like equation for @xmath26 contains equivalent nonrelativistic central and spin - orbit potentials which are functions of the relativistic , energy - dependent , scalar and vector potentials .",
    "the darwin nonlocality factor , that contains the effect of the negative - energy components of the spinor , is reabsorbed in the current operator , which becomes an effective relativistic one - body operator depending on the dirac scalar and vector potentials as well as on the prescription for the electromagnetic current .",

    "bound - state wave functions @xmath27 have been obtained in a mf model , and the values of the spectroscopic factors have been set to unity . in this article",
    "we intend to study the sensitivity of our results to the changes of the hole s.p . wave function .",
    "to this aim , we have performed calculations for the various nuclei under investigation with different mf approaches .    in a first approach , for the dwia calculations",
    ", we repeat for the comparison with data the original analyses of refs . @xcite and adopt the same phenomenological ingredients .",
    "as indicated in the introduction , in these calculations the hole wave functions are calculated by using a ws well where the values of the depth and of the radius are adjusted to reproduce , respectively , the experimentally observed separation energy of the bound final state and the width of the experimental momentum distributions .",
    "the values of the parameters used in the calculations can be found in refs .",
    "@xcite . in order to reproduce the magnitude of the experimental cross sections a multiplicative reduction factor",
    "is applied to the calculated cross sections .",

    "model @xcite .",
    "this information from @xmath0 experiments is up to now limited to stable isotopes .",
    "the source of the reduction of the @xmath0  spectroscopic factor with respect to the mf value has been investigated by using various methodologies which consider different types of correlations , i. e. , effects beyond the mf model",
    ". the short - range and tensor correlations , which arise from the characteristics of the bare nucleon - nucleon interaction , account for a reduction factor of at most 10 - 15% @xcite .",
    "the remaining , and larger , part of the quenching is due to long - range correlations related to the coupling between s.p . motion and collective surface vibrations @xcite .    in a second approach , also used in dwia calculations , the hole s.p .",
    "wave functions are obtained by solving hf equations with the technique presented in refs .",
    "@xcite . in these calculations we use two different parameterizations of the finite - range gogny interactions , the more traditional d1s force @xcite and the new d1 m force @xcite .",
    "the differences between the results obtained with these two forces are rather small when compared with the differences with the results obtained with the other methods .",
    "for this reason we shall present here only the results obtained with the d1 m interaction , which produces a neutron matter equation of state which has a plausible behavior at high densities , in contrast to that obtained with the d1s interaction .    in the third approach we made rdwia calculations where the hole wave functions are obtained in the context of the relativistic mf approach by solving the dirac - hartree equations .",
    "the nucleon interaction is derived from a relativistic lagrangian containing @xmath28 , @xmath7 and @xmath29 meson fields and also the photon field .",
    "the nuclear and coulomb potentials are obtained by solving self - consistently the klein - gordon and maxwell equations .",
    "this approach satisfactorily reproduces global and s.p .",
    "properties of several nuclei @xcite .",
    "the last ingredient necessary to calculate the expression  ( [ eq : dwia ] ) is the current @xmath16 . in rdwia calculations the electromagnetic one - body current operator corresponds to the relativistic current - conserving @xmath30 expression of ref .",
    "this expression is consistent with the current we use in dwia calculations , where the relativistic corrections up to order @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is the nucleon mass , are obtained from a foldy - wouthuysen transformation applied to the interaction hamiltonian where the nuclear current has the same form as in the @xmath30 expression .",
    "the values of some quantities related to the wave functions and density distributions , obtained in the different mf approaches for the nuclei under investigation , are compared in tab .",
    "[ tab : oisot ] for the oxygen isotopes and in tab .",
    "[ tab : caisot ] for the calcium isotopes . in these tables",
    "the proton separation energies and the root mean squared ( rms ) radii of the bound state wave functions are shown .",
    "the proton separation energies of the ws calculations reproduce the experimental values . for @xmath33o and @xmath34ca nuclei , where no experimental values are available",
    ", the depth of the ws well has been chosen to reproduce the separation energy obtained in the nonrelativistic hf approach .",
    "we remark that , experimentally , @xmath33o and @xmath34ca nuclei are unbound ; however our mf calculations bind all the nuclei we have investigated .    in tab .",
    "[ tab : oisot ] and [ tab : caisot ] we also present the rms radii of the global proton and neutron density distributions for the hf and the relativistic models . in the phenomenological ws approach the parameters of the ws well are determined to reproduce the experimental separation energy and the width of the experimental @xmath0 distribution and can give information only on the wave function of the considered proton .",
    "the behavior of the neutron rms radii is rather obvious and increases with the increasing number of neutrons . in the hf model",
    "the neutron radii are slightly smaller than in the relativistic model , but for @xmath1o and @xmath2ca , where they are practically the same .",
    "the behavior of the proton rms radii is less obvious .",
    "the proton number is the same in each isotope chain , but in the hf case we observe a small increase of the proton rms radius with the increasing number of neutrons .",
    "in contrast , in the relativistic case there is a slight decrease of the radius from @xmath1o to @xmath35o and from @xmath2ca to @xmath3ca , then for nuclei with larger neutron excess the radius increases . in general in the hf",
    "approach the proton radii are a bit larger than in the relativistic approach .",
    "the modifications of the proton radii due to the presence of neutrons are related to the proton - neutron interaction , which is responsible also for the value of the proton - neutron symmetry energy in nuclear matter . in hf calculation",
    "we obtain a value of 29.45 mev while that of the relativistic calculation is 35 mev .",
    "these values should be compared with an empirical value of 32@xmath363 mev .",
    "the experimental data of the @xmath0  reaction are separated in different peaks corresponding to specific values of the missing energy @xmath37 , where @xmath38 and @xmath39 are the kinetic energies of the outgoing nucleon and of the residual nucleus , respectively , @xmath40 is the nucleon separation energy , and @xmath41 is the excitation energy of the residual nucleus . for each peak , the data are usually presented in terms of the reduced cross section as a function of the missing momentum @xmath42 , which is the magnitude of the recoil momentum of the residual nucleus @xcite .",
    "the reduced cross section is the cross section divided by a kinematical factor and by the elementary off - shell electron - proton scattering cross section . for the latter cross section , the @xmath43 prescription of ref .",
    "@xcite is usually adopted . in the reduced cross section the complicated dependence of the cross section on the kinematic variables",
    "is reduced to a twofold function of @xmath44 and @xmath45 .    if we neglect fsi the wave function of the emitted proton is a plane wave . in this plane - wave impulse approximation ( pwia )",
    ", the missing momentum @xmath46 corresponds , apart for a minus sign , to the initial momentum of the emitted nucleon in the nucleus . in the pwia",
    "the cross section is factorized into the product of a kinematical factor , the elementary off - shell electron - proton scattering cross section , and the hole spectral function .",
    "thus , in the pwia the reduced cross section is the squared fourier transform of the hole wave function , and can be interpreted as the momentum distribution of the emitted proton when it was inside the nucleus .",
    "this factorization is destroyed in the dwia by fsi .",
    "however , even in the dwia , the reduced cross section is an interesting quantity that can be regarded as the nucleon momentum distribution modified by fsi .",
    "the theoretical approaches outlined above have been used to calculate @xmath0  reduced cross sections in the parallel and perpendicular kinematics selected in the experiments . in the so - called parallel kinematics @xcite , the momentum of the outgoing proton @xmath47 is kept fixed and taken parallel , or antiparallel , to the direction of the momentum transfer @xmath6 .",
    "different values of the missing momentum @xmath45 are obtained by varying the electron scattering angle and , as a consequence , @xmath48 .",
    "in the so - called perpendicular , or ( @xmath49 ) constant kinematics , the momentum transfer @xmath6 and the outgoing proton momentum @xmath47 are kept constant and the value of the missing momentum @xmath45 is changed by varying the angle of the outgoing proton .",
    "in this section we present the results of our calculations of the exclusive @xmath0  cross sections for a set of oxygen and calcium isotopes .",
    "we compare the results obtained by using the different nuclear structure models described in the previous section .",
    "first we show the performances of the various models in the description of the existing experimental data in @xmath2ca , @xmath3ca , and @xmath1o nuclei .",

    "no reduction factors have been applied to the curves presented in these figures .",
    "it is interesting to remark that the evolution of the cross section with respect to the change of the neutron number is the same in all the panels of both figures .",
    "we observe that the @xmath2ca lines are always above the other ones , and the size of the curves decreases with the increasing number of neutrons .",
    "this behavior is clearer in the dwia - ws results , panels ( a ) and ( b ) of both figures , and becomes less evident in the other cases , especially in the rdwia ones .    for a better understanding of these results it is interesting to consider the s.p .",
    "hole wave functions obtained in the three models .",
    "we show in fig .",
    "[ fig : densca ] the squared moduli of the radial part of the s.p wave function for the @xmath52 and @xmath55 states of the various calcium isotopes .",
    "the relativistic wave functions shown in the figure are obtained by summing the squared of the radial part of the upper and lower components of the dirac spinor .",
    "all the curves shown in the figure are normalized to one .",
    "the behavior of the ws wave functions shown in panels ( a ) and ( b ) can be understood by considering that the depth of the ws well becomes deeper with increasing neutron number .",
    "this deepening occurs because by increasing the neutron number the proton experiences more binding , its separation energy increases , and the depth of the ws well , which is determined to reproduce the experimental separation energy , increases .",
    "a deeper ws well produces narrower wave functions , as the curves of the upper panels of fig .  [",
    "fig : densca ] show .    the hf wave functions have a different behavior , as shown in panels ( c ) and ( d )",
    "in this case , the narrower wave functions are those obtained for the isotopes with smaller neutron numbers .",
    "the behavior of the relativistic wave functions is somewhat different and does not have a defined trend as in the previous cases .",
    "it is , in any case , more similar to that of the hf than to that of the ws wave functions .",
    "we point out that the values of the separation energies , and their trend as a function of the neutron number , are similar in all three types of calculation .",
    "these differences in the wave functions are responsible for only a part of the differences in the reduced cross sections of figs .",
    "[ fig : caiso_par ] and [ fig : caiso_per ] , which show a different trend as a function of neutron number .",

    "all these contributions are intertwined in the calculated cross section and , in general , they can not be easily disentangled .",
    "in order to understand the source of the difference between the behavior of the wave functions and of the cross sections with respect to the increase of neutron number , we have performed pwia calculations . in this case ,",

    "we have checked that the trend of our pwia results agrees with the trend of the wave functions shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : densca ] : the ws wave functions produce pwia reduced cross sections higher for @xmath2ca than for the other nuclei , while the situation is reversed with the hf wave functions . as a next step ,",
    "we have done dwia calculations by using the same parameters of the optical potential for all the isotopes .",
    "the results are different from those obtained in the pwia , but the trends , with respect to the change of the neutron number , are preserved . only when we include that a - dependence of the optical potential are the trends of the cross sections changed and",
    "also the dwia - hf results produce @xmath2ca @xmath0 reduced cross sections larger than those obtained for the other isotopes .",
    "the dependence of the wave functions on the proton to neutron asymmetry is responsible for a large part of the differences in the reduced cross sections , but an important and crucial contribution is given by fsi , which are described in the calculations by phenomenological optical potentials .",
    "the differences between the results in parallel and ( @xmath49 ) constant kinematics in figs .",
    "[ fig : caiso_par ] and [ fig : caiso_per ] are basically due to the different effects of the distortion produced by the optical potential .",
    "these effects strongly depend on kinematics and are larger in parallel than in ( @xmath49 ) constant kinematics @xcite .",

    "[ fig : caiso_par ] and [ fig : caiso_per ] . the comparison with data in figs .",
    "[ fig : ca40exp ] and [ fig : ca48exp ] gives , however , a significant quenching of the measured cross sections with respect to the predictions of the mf model .",
    "the quenching is different for the @xmath2ca @xmath0  and @xmath3ca @xmath0  reactions and increases with neutron number .",
    "a quenching depending on the number of neutrons can be expected for all the isotopes and would give further differences on the reduced cross sections than those shown in figs .  [ fig : caiso_par ] and [ fig : caiso_per ] .",

    "we have repeated also for the oxygen isotopes the investigation done for the calcium isotopes by doing pwia calculations and dwia calculations with the same optical potential for all the isotopes .",
    "we obtained results analogous to those discussed for the calcium isotopes .",
    "in this work we have presented and discussed @xmath0 cross sections calculated for a set of calcium and oxygen isotopes with the aim of studying their evolution with respect to the change of neutron number .",
    "the calcium and oxygen isotopes have been chosen since data are available for the doubly magic @xmath2ca , @xmath3ca , and @xmath1o nuclei . in the calcium and oxygen isotope chains ,",

    "the results obtained with three different descriptions of the hole wave function of the knocked out proton , all of them based on the mean field approximation , have been compared .",
    "we have performed dwia calculations with phenomenological ws and hf wave functions . for @xmath1o , @xmath2ca , and @xmath3ca",
    "nuclei the ws wave functions are the same as used in the original analyses of the experimental data in @xcite .",
    "the wave functions used in the rdwia are obtained by solving dirac - hartree equations .",
    "the three models are all able to give a good and similar description of the shape of the experimental reduced cross section on @xmath1o,@xmath2ca , and @xmath3ca target nuclei , with the only exception of the hf result in @xmath1o . in order to reproduce the magnitude of the experimental data ,",
    "a reduction factor has been applied to all the calculated results .    in our study of the @xmath0 process in the two isotope chains",
    "we have found that the general behavior of the cross sections with respect to the increasing number of neutrons is analogous for all the three models .",
    "generally speaking , the reduced cross sections are larger and narrower for the lighter isotopes , and evolve by lowering and widening with increasing neutron number .    the behavior of the hole s.p .",
    "wave functions for the three models show rather different trends : the ws wave functions become narrower and have higher maxima with increasing neutron number , the hf wave functions show an opposite behavior , and the behavior of the relativistic wave functions is not so well defined , but it is more similar to the behavior of hf than of the ws wave functions .",
    "the dependence of the wave functions on the proton to neutron asymmetry is responsible for only a part of the differences in the reduced cross sections .",
    "an important and crucial contribution is also given by fsi , that are described in the calculations by phenomenological optical potentials .",
    "the optical potential is an important ingredient of the model that affects both the size and the shape of the cross section in a way that strongly depends on kinematics . in particular , its imaginary part , that gives a reduction of the nucleon flux and , consequently , of the calculated cross section ,",
    "can affect the values of the spectroscopic factors obtained from the comparison between data and theoretical results . in the present calculations we have used phenomenological optical potentials that were usually adopted in the previous dwia and rdwia analyses of @xmath0  data on stable closed - shell nuclei .",
    "the dependence of the optical potential on the asymmetry between the number of neutrons and protons is an interesting problem that deserves careful investigation .",
    "we have used mf wave functions that do not include correlations .",

    "[ fig : caiso_par ] , [ fig : caiso_per ] , and [ fig : oiso ] , we did not apply reduction factors , since data are available only for the @xmath1o , @xmath2ca , and @xmath3ca target nuclei .    from recent experimental and theoretical studies",
    "there are indications that the spectroscopic factors and the effects of correlations depend on the asymmetry between the number of neutrons and protons .",
    "recent experimental information on the spectroscopic factors of drip - line isotopes has been obtained by means of nucleon knockout using intermediate heavy - ion beams @xcite .",
    "these results also include neutron data and suggest a strong dependence of the spectroscopic factors on the proton - neutron ratio .",
    "in general , the quenching of quasiparticle orbits , and hence correlations , becomes stronger with increasing separation energy .    from the theoretical point of view",
    ", a dependence on nucleon asymmetry has been found in @xcite for the depletion of the fermi sea in asymmetric nuclear matter , with the minority nucleonic species becoming more depleted , and the majority one less .",
    "results of faddeev - random = phase approximation calculations for the spectroscopic factors of @xmath66o and @xmath67ca isotopes @xcite show that the spectroscopic factors become smaller with increasing nucleon separation energy . from recent work on the dispersive optical potential , which has been applied to calcium isotopes with the aim to extract the asymmetry dependence of the self - energy ,",
    "a clear signal emerges suggesting that the surface imaginary term of the dispersive optical potential increases with the asymmetry for protons @xcite .",
    "apart from the associated increased binding that protons experience with increasing asymmetry , there is a corresponding reduction of valence hole spectroscopic factors .",
    "therefore , we can expect a dependence of the spectroscopic factors on the neutron number and this would give further differences in the reduced cross sections than those shown in figs .  [ fig : caiso_par ] , [ fig : caiso_per ] , and [ fig : oiso ] .",
