    "the fields of statistical mechanics , condensed matter physics and quantum information theory share a common interest in the study of interacting quantum many body systems .",
    "the concept of * entanglement * in quantum mechanics has significant importance in all these areas , it was introduced in @xcite . roughly speaking , entanglement",
    "@xcite is a phenomenon of quantum mechanical nature in which quantum states of physical systems are linked together so that one system can not be adequately described without full mention of its counterpart , even when the individual systems may be spatially separated .",
    "entanglement becomes particularly interesting in a many body interacting system where a subsystem strongly correlates with its environment ( other parts of the system ) .",
    "the correlations may reject the principle of local realism , which states that information about the state of a system can only be mediated by interactions in its immediate surroundings ( neighbors ) .",
    "the characteristic length of entanglement may be diverging while the usual correlation length remains finite @xcite .",
    "quantum entanglement is a fundamental measure of ` quantumness ' of a system : how much quantum effects we can observe and use to control one quantum system by another .",
    "it is the primary resource in emerging technologies of quantum computation and quantum information processing @xcite .",
    "entanglement properties play an important role in condensed matter physics , such as phase transitions @xcite and macroscopic properties of solids @xcite .",
    "there is an excellent review @xcite on entanglement detection , which covers many topics ( such as multi - partite entanglement , concurrence , bell inequalities , entanglement witnesses and experiments ) beyond the scope of our present discussion .",
    "much of current research seeks to elucidate quantum entanglement in a variety of interacting systems .",
    "extensive research has been undertaken to investigate quantum entanglement in strongly correlated states such as spin chains , correlated electrons , interacting bosons as well as other models .",
    "( see @xcite for reviews and references . )",
    "a general approach studies the density matrix of a certain subsystem of a strongly entangled state .",
    "the concept of the reduced density matrix was first introduced by p. a. m. dirac in @xcite .",
    "following c. h. bennett , h. j. bernstein , s. popescu and b. schumacher @xcite , the entropy ( derived from the spectrum of the density matrix ) of a subsystem serves as the measure of entanglement for a * pure state*. the von neumann entropy and its generalization ( the rnyi entropy ) are typical quantifications of entanglement .",
    "these characteristic functions may depend on the physical parameters ( size , coupling constants , external fields , _",
    "etc_. ) in various different ways .",
    "an area law for the von neumann entropy in harmonic lattice systems has been extensively studied @xcite .",
    "the area law states that the entropy scales proportional to the size ( area ) of the boundary of the subsystem ( this statement was strictly proved for gapped models only ) .",
    "the entropy of the whole system vanishes if the system is in a pure state ( usually the unique ground state ) , but it can be positive for a subsystem ( this means entanglement ) .",
    "this is in contrast with a classical system in which if the entropy is equal to zero for the whole system , then it also vanishes for any subsystem . in quantum mechanics ,",
    "when the whole system is in a pure state , a subsystem can be in a mixed state .",
    "_ e.g. _ the bell pair ( or the einstein - podolsky - rosen state ) @xmath1 is a pure state .",
    "a single spin subsystem is in a completely mixed state .",
    "the density matrix of one spin in an epr state is proportional to identity matrix : @xmath2 , which has entropy @xmath3 . in a more general case",
    ", we shall consider a pure system consisting of two subsystems @xmath4 ( block ) and @xmath5 ( environment ) with two different hilbert spaces @xmath6 and @xmath7 of dimensions @xmath8 and @xmath9 , respectively ( assuming that @xmath10 ) .",
    "so the entropy of the whole system @xmath11 is zero .",
    "if the entropy of a subsystem ( @xmath4 ) is positive then the wave function of the whole system does not factorize : @xmath12 and @xmath13 be any fixed orthonormal bases for subsystems @xmath4 and @xmath5 , respectively .",
    "then the wave function of the whole system can be written as @xmath14 for some matrix @xmath15 of complex elements @xmath16 . then by the singular value decomposition ( see  @xmath17 of @xcite ) , @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is a diagonal matrix with non - negative elements , and @xmath20 and @xmath21 are unitary matrices ( @xmath15 is a rectangular matrix if @xmath22 , in that case @xmath20 and @xmath21 have different dimensions ) . define @xmath23 , @xmath24 , and @xmath25 . with such a choice of bases , we find that the wave function can be put in the following form : @xmath26 where @xmath27 , as well as @xmath28 , are orthonormal bases .",
    "the coefficients @xmath29 satisfy @xmath30 once again , if the entropy of the subsystem @xmath31>0 $ ] then @xmath32 ( @xmath33 ) . in this case",
    "we can control one subsystem by the other . indeed if we measure subsystem @xmath4 ( in @xmath34 basis ) , then the wave function of the whole system will change ( collapse ) into @xmath35 with probability @xmath36 for some @xmath37 . so that a measurement of @xmath4 changes the state of @xmath5 and this is quantum control .",
    "this is an important resource for quantum device building ( and maybe even quantum computation ) .",
    "much insight in understanding entanglement of quantum systems has been obtained by studying exactly solvable models in statistical mechanics , in which it is possible to solve the subsystem density matrix and calculate the entropy exactly .",
    "this review is devoted to one particular set of models  the aklt models .    in 1987 ,",
    "i. affleck , t. kennedy , e. h. lieb and h. tasaki proposed a spin interacting model known as the aklt model @xcite .",
    "the model consists of spins on lattice sites and the hamiltonian describes interactions between nearest neighbors .",
    "the hamiltonian density is a linear combination of projectors .",
    "each projector is written as a polynomial of the inner product of a pair of interacting spin vectors .",
    "the authors ( aklt ) of @xcite found the exact ground state , which has an exponentially - decaying correlation function and a finite energy gap . in their early works , authors discussed the @xmath0-dimensional aklt lattices with open and periodic boundary conditions and @xmath38-dimensional models such as the hexagonal lattice .",
    "d. a. arovas , a. auerbach and f. d. m. haldane studied the model @xcite in the schwinger boson representation ( see  @xmath39 below ) and calculated the correlation functions using the coherent state basis ( see  @xmath40 below ) . in their work @xcite",
    ", it was shown that the quantum spins in the aklt model is equivalent to classical spins .",
    "this model has been attracting enormous research interests since then @xcite .",
    "it can be defined and solved in higher dimensional lattices @xcite .",
    "it is generalizable to the inhomogeneous ( non - translational invariant ) case ( spins at different lattice sites may take different values ) and an arbitrary graph @xcite .",
    "the aklt model has also been generalized to the @xmath41 version @xcite . given certain conditions ( see  @xmath42 ) , the ground state has proven to be unique @xcite .",

    "the vbs state is interesting to different research fields .",
    "the schwinger boson representation of the vbs state ( see ( [ generalizedvbs ] ) ) relates to the laughlin ansatz of the fractional quantum hall effect @xcite .",
    "the laughlin wave function of the fractional quantum hall effect is the vbs state on the complete graph @xcite .",
    "the vbs state illustrates ground state properties of anti - ferromagnetic integer - spin chains with a haldane gap @xcite . in @xmath0-dimension",
    ", the vbs state is related to the matrix product state discovered by a. klmper , a. schadschneider and j. zittartzand , see @xcite where a ` q  deformed ' vbs - model ( a generalized anisotropic version ) was studied .",
    "the geometric entanglement for a @xmath0-dimensional spin-@xmath0 vbs state was studied in @xcite .",
    "the vbs state can be used as a resource state in measurement - based quantum computation invented by r. raussendorf and h. briegel @xcite .",
    "vbs state allows universal quantum computation @xcite .",

    "aklt hamiltonian can be implemented in optical lattices @xcite .",
    "this review introduces some of the main results on quantum entanglement in vbs states defined on a lattice or a graph .",
    "we take a pedagogical approach , starting with the basics of the aklt model , the construction of vbs states and measures of entanglement ( special attention being paid to the uniqueness of the ground state for a finite lattice or graph ) . we shall consider a part ( subsystem ) of the ground state , _",
    "i.e. _ a block of spins .",
    "it is described completely by the reduced density matrix of the block , which we call _ the density matrix _",
    "later for short . the density matrix has been studied extensively .",

    "in the following we give the most general aklt hamiltonian and vbs states .",
    "the definition applies to both graphs and arbitrary lattices .",
    "the original aklt hamiltonian describes a spin interacting system , in which spins sitting at lattice sites interact with nearest neighbors .",
    "one of the most simple versions is an ( @xmath0-dimensional ) open chain of @xmath52 sites with spin-@xmath0 at each site , and the hamiltonian is given by @xcite @xmath53 in which @xmath54 denotes the quantum operator for a spin vector @xmath55 at site @xmath56 .",
    "this hamiltonian ( [ simphami ] ) looks like the heisenberg hamiltonian with an extra quadratic term ( the proportionality factor @xmath57 and the additive constant @xmath58 are sometimes neglected which only shifts and scales the energy spectrum as a whole ) , but the physical system behaves quite differently .",
    "it was later generalized : 1 ) the spin @xmath54 at each site can take higher values ; 2 ) different lattice sites can have different spins ; 3 ) different boundary conditions ( _ e.g. _ an open boundary condition ) can be applied . an arbitrary boundary condition or distribution of spin values over sites may not yield a unique ground state ( _ e.g. _ hamiltonian ( [ simphami ] ) has @xmath59-fold degenerate ground states ) .",
    "we could find the condition for the uniqueness of the ground state ( see  @xmath42 and @xcite ) .",
    "the hamiltonian can be defined on higher dimensional lattices ( _ e.g. _ @xmath38-dimensional square or hexagonal lattice @xcite ) or an arbitrary graph ( a graph consists of two types of elements , namely _ vertices _ and _ edges_. every edge connects two vertices .",
    "spins locate on vertices and two vertices connected by an edge are nearest neighbors .",
    "an edge is also called a _ bond _ physically . in our considerations",
    "only nearest neighbors are present in the hamiltonian .",
    "more formal and detailed explanation of a graph is given in ",
    "@xmath60 ) .",
    "these different versions of the aklt hamiltonian under consideration share two common features :    1 .",
    "the hamiltonian is a sum of terms with only nearest neighbor interactions .",
    "_ i.e. _ @xmath61 here the hamiltonian density @xmath62 describes the interaction between two spins at vertices @xmath63 and @xmath64 for a connected graph .",
    "the construction for a lattice is similar . only spins at nearest neighbor pairs @xmath65 s called _ bonds _ ( edges of a graph ) interact",
    "the hamiltonian density @xmath62 is a sum of several terms .",
    "each term is proportional to a projector .",
    "the proportionality coefficients are all positive numbers . _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath66 here @xmath67 s are projectors and @xmath68 s are positive coefficients .",
    "note that the coefficients may depend on the bond @xmath69 and the projector @xmath67 .",
    "the projector @xmath67 projects @xmath70 and @xmath71 on the joint value @xmath72 of the bond spin @xmath73 .",
    "( we also call the joint spin value @xmath72 the _ bond spin",
    "_ value ) .",
    "the meaning is this : the spin @xmath70 with spin value @xmath74 at site ( or vertex ) @xmath63 is a @xmath75-dimensional representation of the @xmath76 lie algebra , while @xmath71 is a @xmath77-dimensional representation .",
    "the direct product of these two representations is reducible to a direct sum of irreducible representations with dimensions @xmath78 and @xmath72 runs from @xmath79 to @xmath80 .",
    "the hilbert space ` splits ' into these invariant subspaces labeled by @xmath72 which is called the _",
    "bond spin _ value of @xmath70 and @xmath71 .",
    "( the eigenvalues of the casimir operator ",

    "if we choose an orthonormal basis @xmath83 for the subspace , such that @xmath84 and @xmath85 , then the projector could be written as @xmath86 this form ( [ projstates ] ) is cumbersome in practical use and it is preferred to express the projector @xmath67 explicitly in terms of spin operators @xmath70 and @xmath71 .",
    "we shall do that in the next section (  @xmath87 ) .    even without an explicit form of the projectors , an immediate consequence of these two properties",
    "is that the hamiltonian is _ positive semi - definite_. satisfies @xmath88 .",
    "so that for an arbitrary state @xmath89 , we have @xmath90 because it is an inner product of @xmath91 with itself . ]",
    "furthermore , because of this , if we could construct a state @xmath89 which has no projection on any of the specified bond spin-@xmath72 states appearing in ( [ hamiden ] ) for each bond , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath92 , @xmath93 , then it has to be a ground state ( with energy equal to zero ) regardless of the specific values of the coefficients . )",
    "the constant @xmath58 can be dropped .",
    "this may shift the ground state energy but does not affect the form of the ground state because the ground state is constructed to have no projection on the specified subspaces for every bond . ] the uniqueness condition of the ground state will be discussed later in  @xmath42 .      in order to complete the definition of the general aklt hamiltonian ( [ hamisum ] ) and hamiltonian density ( [ hamiden ] )",
    ", we have to give an explicit expression of the projector @xmath67 in terms of spin operators @xmath70 and @xmath71 .",
    "we derive the expression in two steps .",
    "the forms of @xmath67 for a specific model such as the expression ( [ simphami ] ) or those for @xmath0-dimensional models in  @xmath46 , ",
    "@xmath48 and  @xmath49 can all be obtained through this approach as follows .",
    "( an explicit construction of the projector was given in @xcite . )    1 .",
    "consider the following two sets of operators : the projectors @xmath94 and the powers of the inner product @xmath95 @xmath96 one set is expressible in terms of the other .",
    "they are related by a linear transformation : @xmath97^{n}\\sum^{s_{k}+s_{l}}_{j=|s_{k}-s_{l}|}\\pi_{j}(k , l ) \\nonumber\\\\              & = & \\sum^{s_{k}+s_{l}}_{j=|s_{k}-s_{l}|}\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{n}\\left[j(j+1)-s_{k}(s_{k}+1)-s_{l}(s_{l}+1)\\right]^{n}\\pi_{j}(k , l ) \\nonumber\\\\          \\label{lineartr }          \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for @xmath98 . in ( [ lineartr ] ) we have used @xmath99 being the identity .",
    "this set of @xmath100 linear equations ( [ lineartr ] ) can be inverted , which express the projector @xmath67 as a polynomial of the inner product @xmath95 .",
    "we shall not pursue with the inversion of ( [ lineartr ] ) but to construct the projector in the next step .",
    "2 .   the next step is to realize that if an operator @xmath101 satisfies the following conditions @xmath102 then the operator @xmath101 is identified with @xmath67 because @xmath103 therefore we could construct an operator satisfying the condition ( [ cond ] ) : @xmath104 when @xmath101 acting on @xmath105 , we have : 1 .   if @xmath106 , then the numerator of one factor in the product vanishes , so that @xmath107 vanishes . _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath108 , if @xmath106 ; 2 .",
    "if @xmath109 , all factors in the product become equal to @xmath0 , so as the expression @xmath107 .",
    "_ i.e. _ @xmath110 .",
    "+ so that ( [ piproj ] ) is the projector @xmath67 , _ i.e. _ @xmath111 .",
    "operator @xmath112 projects the bond spin @xmath113 on the subspace with fixed total spin value @xmath72 and @xmath114 .",
    "note that we could expand @xmath115 .",
    "therefore projector @xmath67 in ( [ pi ] ) is a polynomial in the scalar product @xmath95 of degree @xmath116 , where @xmath117 is the minimum of the two spin values of the same bond @xmath69 .",
    "for example with @xmath118 , we may have a quadratic polynomial as in ( [ simphami ] ) : @xmath119        once we have the building blocks for the hamiltonian from ",
    "@xmath120 and  @xmath87 , various types of the aklt model can be constructed .",
    "let us start with the definition of the _ basic _ aklt model on a connected graph or lattice .",
    "( any lattice is a special graph with periodic structure ; our notations and definitions refer to the most general ) .",
    "a _ graph _ consists of two types of elements , namely _ vertices _ and _ edges_. every edge _ connects _ two vertices . as in figure ( [ figure1 ] ) , a vertex is drawn as a ( large ) circle and an edge is drawn as a solid line connecting two vertices .",
    "for every pair of vertices in the _ connected _ graph , there is a _ _ walk _ _ from one to the other .",
    "vertices can also be called _ sites _ and edges sometimes called _ links _ or _ bonds_. in a graph , a pair of vertices connected by an edge is regarded nearest neighbors , _ i.e. _ the terms edge ,",
    "bond and nearest neighbor are equivalent and interchangeable .",
    "( for a lattice , vertices become sites and bonds become lattice vectors connecting nearest neighboring sites . ) in the case of a disconnected graph , the hamiltonian ( [ hamisum ] ) is a direct sum with respect to connected components and the ground state is a direct product .",
    "therefore we shall need only to study a connected graph . also , assuming that the graph consists of more than one vertices to avoid the trivial case where there would be no interaction at all .",
    "let us introduce mathematical notations .",
    "by @xmath71 we shall denote the spin operator located at vertex @xmath64 with spin value @xmath121 . in the _ basic _ model we require that @xmath122 , where @xmath123 is the number of incident edges connected to vertex @xmath64 , also known as the _ valence _ or _ coordination number _",
    "( the number of nearest neighbors of the vertex @xmath64 ) .",
    "the relation between the spin value and coordination number must be true for any vertex @xmath64 , including boundaries .",
    "this will guarantee the uniqueness of the ground state , see  @xmath42 . for a lattice",
    ", this condition would also yield that bulk spins ( spins not on the boundary ) take the same value @xmath124 because the number of nearest neighbors @xmath125 is a constant .",
    "in the _ basic _ model we define the hamiltonian density @xmath62 for bond ( edge ) @xmath69 as @xmath126 with @xmath127 an arbitrary positive real coefficient ( it may depend on the bond @xmath69 ) . so that the hamiltonian density for each bond ( edge ) is proportional to the projector on the subspace with the highest possible bond spin value @xmath128 .",
    "the physical meaning is that interacting spins do not form the highest possible bond spin ( this will increase the energy ) in the ground state .",
    "then the basic aklt hamiltonian on an arbitrary connected graph according to ( [ hamisum ] ) is @xmath129 here we sum over all bonds ( edges ) @xmath69 .",
    "note that for a lattice all the highest bond spin values for bulk spins are the same and equal to the coordination number @xmath125 .",
    "for example , the basic model defined on a @xmath38-dimensional square lattice must have spin-@xmath38 in each bulk vertex and @xmath130 in the hamiltonian ; also , the hexagonal lattice has spin-@xmath131 in each vertex and @xmath132 in the hamiltonian .      in this section",
    "we consider the hamiltonian ( [ basich ] ) and construct a ground state which is denoted by @xmath133 .",

    "in such a way each edge has two spin-@xmath57 s at its ends .",
    "we anti - symmetrize the spin states of these two spin-@xmath57 s . so that anti - symmetrization is done along each edge .",
    "these anti - symmetrizations ensure that there is no projection on the highest bond spin states for every bond .",
    "then we also symmetrize the product of spin-@xmath57 s at each vertex ( each large circle in figure [ figure1 ] ) .",
    "these symmetrizations preserve the correct spin value at each vertex .",
    "let us write down the vbs ground state algebraically following this approach .",
    "we label the particular dot from vertex @xmath64 connected with some dot from vertex @xmath63 by @xmath137 ( correspondingly , that dot from vertex @xmath63 is labeled by @xmath138 ) . in this way we have specified a unique prescription of indices with dots . then the anti - symmetrization results in the singlet state @xmath139 where @xmath140 ( or @xmath141 ) denotes spin up ( or down ) states referring to a basis .",
    "the direct product of all these @xmath142 singlet states corresponds to all edges ( bonds ) in our figure [ figure1 ] : @xmath143 we still have to complete the symmetrization ( circles ) at each vertex .",

    "then the symmetrization at each vertex is carried out by taking the product @xmath149 of all vertices .",
    "finally , the unique vbs ground state can be written as @xmath150 here the first product runs over all vertices and the second over all edges ( bonds ) . so that we have constructed a ground state of the aklt hamiltonian ( [ basich ] ) such that @xmath151 note that the vbs state in ( [ basicvbs ] ) is not normalized in general .",
    "if the coordination number @xmath123 is a constant over all vertices in the graph except for boundaries ( such as in the case of a lattice ) , then we would have the same spin value at each bulk vertex . in that case",

    "instead , it is a linear combination of projectors @xmath155 projector @xmath67 is given by ( [ pi ] ) , and @xmath68 s are arbitrary positive coefficients . so that @xmath62 projects the bond spin on the subspace with bond spin value @xmath72 greater than @xmath156 .",

    "<S> this article reviews the quantum entanglement in valence - bond - solid ( vbs ) states defined on a lattice or a graph . </S>",
    "<S> the subject is presented in a self - contained and pedagogical way . </S>",
    "<S> the vbs state was first introduced in the celebrated paper by i. affleck , t. kennedy , e. h. lieb and h. tasaki ( abbreviation aklt is widely used ) . </S>",
    "<S> it became essential in condensed matter physics and quantum information ( measurement - based quantum computation ) . </S>",
    "<S> many publications have been devoted to the subject . </S>",
    "<S> recently entanglement was studied in the vbs state . in this review </S>",
    "<S> we start with the definition of a general aklt spin chain and the construction of vbs ground state . in order to study entanglement , </S>",
    "<S> a block subsystem is introduced and described by the density matrix . </S>",
    "<S> density matrices of @xmath0-dimensional models are diagonalized and the entanglement entropies ( the von neumann entropy and rnyi entropy ) are calculated . in the large block limit , the entropies also approach finite limits . </S>",
    "<S> study of the spectrum of the density matrix led to the discovery that the density matrix is proportional to a projector . </S>"
