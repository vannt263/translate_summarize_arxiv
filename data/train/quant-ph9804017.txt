    "a micromaser consists of a high - q microwave cavity and a stream of excited rydberg atoms which pumps the field in the cavity . at any given time , the cavity is either empty or contains one atom . because the field is pumped by only a single atom at a time , the micromaser is a highly quantum mechanical system .",
    "experiments conducted at the max planck institute for quantum optics in garching have seen such quantum phenomena as sub - poissonian photon statistics and quantum collapses and revivals  @xcite .    extensive theoretical work on the micromaser has shown the existence of numerous interesting features . among them",
    "are trapping states , which separate the dynamics into noninteracting blocks of photon numbers  @xcite , and the dependence of steady state of the field on the injection statistics of the atoms  @xcite .",
    "the latter occured as part of more general analysis of pump noise in lasers and masers , and how to minimize it  @xcite . despite all of this , however , there are still some surprises .",
    "one , found only recently , involves the behavior of the electric field inside the cavity .",
    "it has been found by briegel , englert , and scully  @xcite , and independently by herzog and bergou  @xcite , that the passage of a single atom can cause the sign of the electric field to flip .",
    "they demonstrated this by calculating the two - time field - field correlation function and showing that it can change sign .",
    "for a micromaser with regular pumping ( equal time intervals between atoms ) this effect causes a splitting of the spectrum into several equidistant peaks .    in this work",
    "the atoms were injected into the cavity in their upper states .",
    "another kind of field oscillation was found by slosser and meystre when the atoms are injected in a coherent superposition of their upper and lower states  @xcite . considering a lossless micromaser",
    ", they found steady states for the field which they called tangent and cotangent states ( the names refer to the form of coefficients when the states are expanded in the number - state basis ) , which are confined between trapping states  @xcite .",
    "they then went on to examine the dynamics of the system when the photon numbers were limited by two trapping states .",
    "they found , numerically , that if other trapping states intervened between the original two , there were states which one might call steady states of period 2 ; these states are mapped back onto themselves not by the interaction with one atom , as a normal steady state would be , but by the interaction with two atoms .",
    "the electric field of such a state oscillates between two values ; it changes its value after the passage of one atom and returns to its original value after the passage of a second .",
    "here we would like to give a simple explanation for the oscillations seen by slosser and meystre .",
    "this explanation hinges on a slight difference in the behavior of tangent and cotangent states after the passage of an atom .",
    "in addition we wish to see how the oscillatory behavior is affected by the presence of losses . in the next section",
    "we examine the lossless case and in the following section losses are included .",
    "we shall consider a micromaser in which the pumping atoms are injected at regular time intervals , with the time between atoms being @xmath0 . strictly speaking ,",
    "this assumption is not necessary for our analysis in the lossless case to be valid .",
    "however , when we do consider losses it will be necessary to make a particular choice for the injection statistics , and this is the choice we shall make .",
    "each atom interacts with the field for a time , @xmath1 , which is much smaller than @xmath0 . between atoms the field evolves freely , while during the time an atom is in the cavity the interaction of the field and the atom is governed by the jaynes - cummings hamiltonian @xmath2 where @xmath3 is both the frequency of the cavity mode and the transition frequency of the atom , and @xmath4 is the atom - field coupling constant .",
    "the two - level atom is described by a two - dimensional state space on which the pauli matrixes in the hamiltonian act .",
    "we denote the upper state of the atom by @xmath5 and the lower by @xmath6 .",
    "note that we have assumed that the atom and the cavity mode are in resonance .",
    "let us now suppose that the atom is initially in the state @xmath7 , and the field is in the state @xmath8 where @xmath9 is a photon number state with @xmath10 photons .",
    "if this state evolves for a time @xmath1 under the action of the hamiltonian in eq .",
    "( 1 ) , then the resulting state in the interaction picture is @xmath11 slosser and meystre found the tangent and cotangent states by demanding that the state on the right - hand side of this equation be a product of the original field state and an atomic state , i.  e.  that @xmath12 , @xmath13 , and @xmath14 ( cotangent state ) or if @xmath15 , @xmath16 , and @xmath17 ( tangent state ) .",
    "the tangent and cotangent states are normalizeable only if the sums over number states are restricted to a finite range . expressing both states as @xmath18 and imposing the conditions @xmath19 and @xmath20 , we find that @xmath21 where @xmath22 and @xmath23 are integers . for tangent states",
    "@xmath22 is even and @xmath23 is odd , while for cotangent states @xmath22 is odd and @xmath23 is even .    the results of the preceding paragraph imply that for a tangent state , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 if we have a state which is a superposition of a tangent and a cotangent state , @xmath27 , see figure  [ fig : cottan ] , then after one atom passes through the cavity it becomes @xmath28 ( where the states are defined up to a common sign ) , and after a second atom it returns to the original state .",
    "this state is then periodic with period 2 ( where time is measured in units of @xmath0 ) .",
    "how can we see this oscillation of the state ?",
    "because of the conditions on @xmath29 and @xmath30 , tangent and cotangent states must exist in nonoverlapping blocks of number states .",
    "this means that the oscillations will not show up in observables which commute with the number operator . on the other hand ,",
    "if the blocks are adjacent , then the electric field operator , which is proportional to @xmath31 , can connect the two blocks , and the effect of the relative sign flip between them will manifest itself as an oscillation in the expectation value of the field . in order to see this",
    "explicitly let us look at the situation considered by slosser and meystre when @xmath32 , and there is a cotangent state at @xmath33 ( for certain values of the interaction time the vacuum satisfies the conditions necessary to be a cotangent state ) , a tangent state between 1 and 3 , and a cotangent state between 4 and 8 .",
    "the expectation value of the electric field in this state is @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the quantization volume , and @xmath36 is the field density matrix .",
    "after passage of an atom a relative sign is introduced between the tangent state and the two cotangent states .",
    "this means that the density matrix elements between different blocks , @xmath37 , @xmath38 , and their complex conjugates , change sign while the others do not .",
    "this causes @xmath39 to change .",
    "the passage of a second atom causes these density matrix elements to flip sign again , which restores @xmath39 to its original value .",
    "the periodicity of the state , then , does have observable effects .",
    "besides the field one could also look at an observables such as @xmath40/2 $ ] , @xmath41/2 $ ] which appear in the study of some forms of higher- order squeezing , and which also connect blocks .",
    "because these connect the number states @xmath9 and @xmath42 , rather than @xmath9 and @xmath43 as does the electric field operator , it will lead to a larger number of density matrix elements which flip sign and can thereby produce a larger effect .",
    "we now include losses in our system in order to see whether the steady - state oscillations which we discussed in the previous section will survive under under these more realistic conditions . because the atom - field interaction time @xmath1 is much shorter than the time the cavity is empty , t , we shall ignore the effect of field losses during the times atoms are in the cavity .",
    "the decay of the micromaser field for the cavity at zero temperature is described by the master equation @xmath44 which has the solution in the number - state representation @xmath45 we shall numerically simulate the system by using the jaynes - cummings dynamics to describe the atom - field interaction and the loss master equation to describe the field during the periods during which the cavity is empty .",
    "the values of the micromaser parameters which we used in our numerical simulations were chosen to be as close as possible to those which occur in actual experiments  @xcite .",
    "the atom - field coupling constant @xmath4 was set to @xmath46 , the time between two consecutive atoms was set to @xmath47 , the cavity loss coefficient @xmath48 was set to @xmath49 , which provided cavity photon storage time @xmath50 , and number of atoms passing through the cavity during a single decay time was taken to be @xmath51 .",
    "the atom - field interaction time @xmath1 was varied in order to provide needed trapping condition , @xmath32 .",
    "the values of @xmath1 used in simulations came very close to the values in actual experiment  @xcite .",
    "two - level atoms in the coherent superposition @xmath52 are injected regularly into the micromaser cavity .",
    "the parameters @xmath53 and @xmath54 were chosen real with @xmath55 .",
    "the cavity field was prepared initially in a state with a cotangent state at @xmath33 , a tangent state between 1 and 3 , and a cotangent state between 4 and 8 , using the same values of @xmath53 , @xmath54 as the pumping atoms .",
    "the starting values for the recurrence formulas  ( [ eq : cot],[eq : tan ] ) were optimized in order to provide large magnitudes of the observables of interest .",
    "then the first atom was injected at @xmath56 , followed by much longer time period @xmath0 during which the field decayed .",
    "then the second atom was injected followed by the cavity decay period and so on .",
    "the expectation values of observables were calculated after a decay time interval just before the injection of the next atom .    the expectation values of the electric field , operator @xmath57 and @xmath58 for the case are plotted in figure  [ fig : first ] . the interaction time is @xmath59 giving @xmath60 , which justifies the assumption that we can neglect losses during the atom - field interaction . the pumping parameter @xmath61 .",
    "the mean value of each operator exhibits period - two oscillations , but with decreasing magnitude , because of the presence of damping .",
    "these expectation values eventually reach steady state values which do not exhibit oscillations .",
    "in addition , we found that the field approaches its steady state extremely slowly .",
    "this is caused by the presence of the trapping states which separate the total fock space for the jaynes - cummings evolution into independent blocks .",
    "the probability flow between the subspaces in which the cotangent and tangent states are located occurs only because of the loss process , and it is very small .",
    "we now look at the density matrix itself .",
    "the photon number distribution of the field , given by the diagonal density matrix elements , after the passage of different numbers of atoms is shown in figure  [ fig : second ] .",
    "note that the presence of damping drives the field toward lower photon numbers . in figure",
    "[ fig : third ] are plotted absolute values of the cavity field density matrix elements .",
    "initially , because the system starts in a pure state , the density matrix has off - diagonal peaks . because of the loss process , the off - diagonal elements of the density matrix decay as it approaches its new steady state .",
    "this new steady state is very different from the initial cotangent - tangent state , and this explains the deterioration of the oscillations in the expectation values of the operators , because they depend on the presence of the tangent and cotangent states which exhibit a relative phase oscillation .",
    "our conclusions on the effects of damping are consistent with the results of slosser , meystre , and wright  @xcite .",
    "they considered a micromaser with poissonian pumping and found that tangent and cotangent states maintain their integrity only in the limit of very large @xmath62 , i.  e.  very weak damping .",
    "for the damping which occurs in experiments , the damping drastically alters the character of the steady - state field .",
    "we have shown that the period - two oscillations which exist in a lossless micromaser pumped by atoms in a coherent superposition of states are due to a relative sign change undergone by tangent and cotangent states upon passage of an atom through the cavity .",
    "these oscillations can only occur in observables , such as the electric field , which do not commute with the photon number operator .",
    "the addition of damping changes the oscillations from a steady - state to a transient phenomenon , but one with a rather long lifetime .",
