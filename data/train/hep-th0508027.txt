    "for unstable d - branes , the coupling to the bulk rr fields can be read off from the wess - zumino term  @xcite and , for d@xmath17 , it is possibly be extended as @xmath220 , \\label{rtwz}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath221 is a real constant and the supertrace @xmath222 is defined to be a trace with insertion of @xmath223 .",

    "an extension from d - vortices to straight d - strings is straightforwardly made by considering the coincidence limit of d3@xmath13-system ( with fundamental strings ) instead of the d2@xmath12 . since our analysis",
    "is based on the dbi - type effective field theory action ( [ dea ] ) , the matrices @xmath229 ( [ xm ] ) and @xmath230 ( [ xpm ] ) inside the actions ( [ acg ] ) and ( [ acg1 ] ) become @xmath231-matrices with coordinate @xmath232 instead of @xmath233 matrices . for straight d - strings stretched along the @xmath234-direction",

    "if we find a string solution with the rr - charge and the fundamental string charge density @xmath240 confined along the string , the obtained stringy objects must be straight df - string .",
    "if we turn on angular component of the electric field @xmath241 , the classical equations of motion force it to be constant and are not likely to support such static vortex solutions . in terms of string theory ,",
    "this impossibility seems natural since existence of such constant @xmath242 implies distribution of closed strings melted on the d - brane to infinity with constant density .    in curved spacetime",
    "the obtained d - strings become candidates of cosmic superstrings , i.e. , they are straight cosmic d - strings .",
    "the spacetime structure formed by these d - strings is of interest in cosmology , and the first specific question is emergence of conical space at asymptotic region when the cosmological constant vanishes .",
    "cosmic d - strings are mostly generated after the brane and antibrane meet , which means post inflationary era since the inflation on brane - antibrane occurs before the brane and antibrane meet .",
    "in this paper we considered dbi - type effective action of a complex tachyon and gauge fields of u(1)@xmath0u(1 ) symmetry , describing brane - antibrane system with fundamental strings . in the coincidence limit of d2@xmath12",
    ", static vortex solutions are obtained . without dbi electromagnetic field , there exist only singular static global and local d - vortex solutions . when the radial component of electric field is turned on , we found regular static global and local d - vortex solutions .",
    "the obtained point - like d - vortex configurations are naturally embedded in straight stringy solutions in d3@xmath13-system , and are identified with d - strings ( d1-branes ) . if the obtained macroscopic d - strings are gravitating , they become naturally candidates of cosmic d - strings in the early universe .",
    "we conclude the paper with a few discussions for further study .",
    "first , we only considered d@xmath1 in the coincidence limit through this paper , however it is intriguing to take into account the effect coming from separation of d and @xmath1 . in the effective field theory ,",
    "it means inclusion of the transverse coordinates and dynamics of cosmological time evolution , e.g. , inflation .",
    "second , in the superstring theory setting , the worldvolume of d3@xmath243-system comprises a noncompact ( 1 + 3)-dimensional bulk in ten dimensions .",
    "the remaining six - dimensions are assumed to be compactified and their size effect was completely neglected in this work . since the tension of d - branes is naturally in string scale , a consistent approach including kk - modes makes our analysis more concrete .",
    "third , nielsen - olesen vortices of abelian - higgs model are scattered to 90 degrees and this property leads to intercommutation ( reconnection ) of two colliding cosmic strings .",
    "but , according to ref .",
    "@xcite , colliding df - strings may result in a connected tree structure composed of a pair of trilinear vertices and it can finally form a cosmic df - string network .",
    "this issue was dealt in the context of yang - mills theory  @xcite but it needs further study by using the obtained d(f)-strings and the dbi - type nonlocal effective action .",
