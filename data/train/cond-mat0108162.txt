    "tunneling experiments have for a long time been an important probe of superconducting properties@xcite . according to early theoretical analyses in terms of the tunneling hamiltonian model@xcite ,",
    "the conductance of a normal metal-@xmath5-wave superconductor tunnel junction is proportional to the superconductor density of states . within this model",
    "only single - particle tunneling is taken into account . for more transparent interfaces , blonder , tinkham and klapwijk@xcite ( btk )",
    "presented a way to calculate the conductance within bogoliubov - de gennes quantum mechanics .",
    "their approach is valid for arbitrary transparency @xmath2 of the interface , but assumes that the junction system has no impurities and that inelastic scattering is negligible .",
    "btk showed that for intermediate - to - high transparency , so - called andreev reflection@xcite plays an important role in determining the conductance .",
    "andreev reflection is the process where an electron with an energy near the fermi surface , incident on a superconductor from a normal metal , is converted into a hole with essentially unchanged momentum , but with opposite group velocity .",
    "the reversed process is also possible . in the andreev reflection process",
    "a cooper pair is formed on the superconductor side and a charge @xmath6 is transferred over the ns interface , which corresponds to a two - particle tunneling event@xcite . in the low - transparency limit ,",
    "andreev reflection is suppressed since it is of second order in the transparency @xmath2 , while ordinary single particle tunneling is of first order in @xmath2 .",
    "therefore , in the tunnel limit , @xmath7 , the btk result reduces to the tunnel model result .",
    "in contrast to the clear situation for @xmath5-wave junctions described above , the interpretation of the conductance of @xmath0-wave nis junctions@xcite where interface resonant states are present is more complicated .",
    "surface / interface states with zero energy are necessarily formed as a consequence of the @xmath0-wave symmetry of the order parameter , if the interface is oriented so that the order parameter changes its sign along quasiparticle trajectories involving normal reflection at the interface@xcite . for a recent review of the implications of these surface / interface zero - energy states ( zes ) ,",
    "see ref .",
    "it is important that two physically distinct situations can be realized depending on the relation between ( i ) intrinsic broadening due to e.g. surface roughness , impurities , or phonons , which connects the interface states with the bulk superconductor , and ( ii ) broadening due to leakage to the normal reservoir through the barrier . when intrinsic broadening is negligible ,",
    "i.e. when the interface states are decoupled from the superconducting reservoir , the interface states can participate in current transport only via the andreev reflection process .",
    "in fact , the andreev current is resonantly enhanced by the zes , and is of first order in the transparency d. on the other hand , when the intrinsic broadening is dominating , the interface states will instead assist single particle tunneling .",
    "thus , for a @xmath0-wave superconductor with zes , a zero - bias conductance peak ( zbcp ) is present in both limits , but the type of tunneling responsible for it is very different . even if both types of life times are large , it is the quotient @xmath8 which will determine what type of tunneling is dominating : single particle tunneling if @xmath9 and two - particle tunneling if @xmath10@xcite .",
    "the intrinsic relaxation time @xmath11 is set by the damping introduced by an imaginary part @xmath1 of the quasiparticle energy ,",
    "while the life time @xmath12 due to leakage through the barrier is determined by the transparency @xmath2 of the barrier ( @xmath4 is the maximum @xmath0-wave gap ) .    in the present paper",
    "we will discuss the interplay between single - particle and two - particle tunneling through the zes , with emphasis on the limit of small but finite damping .",
    "we will show that it is possible to discriminate between the two types of tunneling in a measurement of low - voltage shot noise at zero temperature and zero frequency .",
    "shot noise was recently calculated for @xmath0-wave nis junctions in refs .",
    "@xcite , under the implicit assumption of negligible intrinsic broadening ( @xmath13 ) .",
    "it was found that the zero - voltage differential shot noise level is zero , @xmath14 , because the effective andreev reflection probability is enhanced to unity near zero energy by the zes resonance . below we will study the effect of intrinsic broadening , and show that the noiseless character of the zes is quickly lost when @xmath1 increases from zero .",
    "this happens because the effective andreev reflection probability is reduced from unity with increasing broadening ; single - particle tunneling via the zes then becomes possible on the expense of two - particle tunneling , and fluctuations between the two channels is introduced .",
    "when broadening is small , the low - voltage shot noise will be proportional to @xmath1 , which makes it possible to probe the magnitude of intrinsic broadening by a measurement of noise .",
    "in our calculation we use the coherent btk scattering approach for a specular @xmath0-wave nis junction , modified to include intrinsic broadening on a phenomenological level by an imaginary part of the energy .",
    "we assume that the normal metal is at @xmath15 , while the superconductor is at @xmath16 .",
    "we let a @xmath0-wave gap node point towards the interface , so that the spectral weight of the zes is large",
    ". it is known that for this orientation the gap is substantially suppressed near the interface@xcite . however , in order to make clear our points on the presence of an interplay between single - particle and two - particle tunneling as a function of @xmath17 , and that shot noise will be sensitive to the nature of tunneling , it is sufficient to assume a step function form of the gap function @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the angle of quasiparticle propagation relative to the interface normal .",
    "the exact form of the specular barrier is not important and we assume a @xmath20-function potential characterized by a transmission probability @xmath21 , where the dimensionless quantity @xmath22 is a measure of the strength of the potential .",
    "-plane ) due to an incoming electron from the normal metal side ( n ) . in between the barrier ( i ) and the superconductor ( s ) , we introduce a small normal region ( @xmath23 ) .",
    "normal scattering takes place at the insulator and andreev reflection takes place at the @xmath24 interface.,width=226 ]    in the original btk theory , effective normal reflection @xmath25 and andreev reflection @xmath26 probabilities are calculated and then the charge current spectral density is expressed through them .",
    "we will follow a slightly different route@xcite , and express the charge current density in terms of probability current densities flowing along the energy axis .",
    "this viewpoint makes it possible to rigorously divide the total charge current @xmath27 into single - particle @xmath28 and two - particle @xmath29 currents .",
    "when an electron at energy @xmath30 is injected from the normal reservoir into the junction , it is accelerated by the voltage drop @xmath31 over the barrier . at the superconductor it is andreev reflected into a hole which , having the opposite charge , is also accelerated by @xmath31 when it tunnels over the barrier back to the normal metal .",
    "thus , the andreev reflected hole is at the energy @xmath32 .",
    "each particle carries a certain probability current , proportional to the absolute value squared of the wavefunction .",
    "thus , it is natural to change focus from the charge current flow through the junction ( along the @xmath33-axis ) , to the probability current flow along the energy axis ( @xmath30-axis ) , see figs .",
    "[ xyfig]-[xefig ] . in the figures ,",
    "we have introduced a small auxiliary normal region ( @xmath23 ) in between the barrier ( the insulator , i ) and the superconductor ( s ) .",
    "the final results will not be affected by the presence of @xmath23 and in the end we let the thickness of this region go to zero . on each of the electron and hole legs in @xmath23 ( see fig .  [ xefig ] ) , we can define the total probability current densities @xmath34 and @xmath35 , respectively , including the effects of normal backscattering at the insulator . for energies outside the gap",
    ", the andreev reflection probability is less than unity , which leads to a leakage @xmath36 of probability current during andreev reflection .",
    "the total leakage is the single - particle current . the rest of the probability current ( the part surviving andreev reflection ) continues out into the normal metal as a hole current , and contributes to the two - particle current . for subgap energies ,",
    "the andreev reflection probability is unity ; probability current is then conserved during andreev reflection , the leakage @xmath36 vanishes , and single particle tunneling is quenched .",

    "recently , a highly useful parameterization was introduced by nagato , nagai , and hara@xcite for the equilibrium case , and by eschrig@xcite for the non - equilibrium case , which can be used to separate electron and hole parts of the green s functions .",
    "probability currents flowing along the energy axis are then easily found , and one can divide the total charge current into single- and two - particle currents , in a one - to - one mapping to the approach outlined above . eventually , the result is the same expression as in eq .",
