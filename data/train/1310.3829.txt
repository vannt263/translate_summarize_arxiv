    "experimental advances allow us to confine a chosen number of few quantum degenerate atoms in a trap with unit precision . whereas this capability was first demonstrated for bosons in optical lattices @xcite , the heidelberg group applied a spilling technique to subtract @xmath0li fermionic atoms one by one from a single trap , down to the zero limit @xcite .",
    "due to the strong anisotropy of the magneto - optical trap employed , the few - atom system was effectively one - dimensional .",
    "the tunability of both confinement potential and interaction  the latter achieved by sweeping a magnetic offset field through a feshbach resonance @xcite  opens new avenues to understand interacting particles in one dimension @xcite .",
    "so far the experiments @xcite have revealed that phenomena previously investigated in the presence of many atoms may be studied in the limit of few particles as well , as the fermi - bose duality @xcite ( also known as ` fermionization ' @xcite ) , the formation of the fermi polaron @xcite , the emergenge of pairing @xcite .",
    "this has fueled theoretical proposals that are specific to few - atom traps , focusing on themes as diverse as stoner ferromagnetism @xcite , exchange mechanisms @xcite , wigner localization @xcite , quasiparticle- @xcite and pair - tunneling @xcite , the fulde - ferrell - larkin - ovchinnikov state @xcite , pairing @xcite , mesoscopic phase separations for bosons @xcite .",
    "on one hand , the study of few interacting atoms , which are the bulding blocks of many - body states , gives an insight into the essential physical features of more complex quantum systems . on the other hand",
    ", the few - body problem may be analyzed using fully understood theoretical models @xcite that provide a benchmark for approximate theories fit to larger numbers of particles .    in this paper",
    "we report accurate calculations of the energy spectra of few atoms interacting through contact forces in a one - dimensional harmonic trap .",
    "since an analytic solution ( recalled in section  [ formulation ] ) is available for two particles @xcite , we consider three atoms , which are either spinful fermions or spinless bosons .",
    "our approach is based on a well controlled variational method ( vm)inspired by previous work in two @xcite and three @xcite dimensions  that is physically transparent , since the three - atom basis set is made of the exact two - body wave functions @xcite plus one - body spectator orbitals .",
    "we then use the vm spectrum as a benchmark for state - of - the - art exact diagonalization [ also known as full configuration interaction ( ci ) ] , which is the technique of choice for accurate calculations of few - body systems .",
    "the ci basis set is simpler than the vm one , as it is made of the slater determinants obtained by filling with three fermions a truncated set of trap orbitals , consistently with pauli exclusion principle .",
    "the comparison between vm and ci data points to the slow convergence of ci in the regime of strong attractive interactions , highlighting the challenging nature of theories of pairing in few fermi - atom systems .",
    "the ci technique uniquely accesses energies and wave functions of both ground and excited states , at the price of being limited to few atoms due to the exponential increase of the hilbert space size with the number of particles @xcite . together with quantum monte carlo @xcite",
    ", ci provides the ground - state energy with  in principle  arbitrary accuracy , hence it has been widely applied to one - dimensional systems of finite size @xcite .",
    "however , for strong attractive interactions , the two - body wave function tends to collapse in space @xcite , hence the convergence of the calculation should be carefully assessed .",
    "an accurate calculation of the spectrum of three interacting fermions , based on green function s formalism , was provided by blume and coworkers @xcite .",
    "these authors investigated the dimensional crossover from a three - dimensional to a quasi one - dimensional trap but reported partial data for stricly one - dimensional fermions and no data for bosons .",
    "other approaches for three particles in a trap in one dimension include group - theoretical @xcite and geometrical analyses @xcite , multiconfigurational time - dependent hartree method @xcite , ansatz correlated wave functions @xcite , effective - interaction approaches @xcite , density functional theory @xcite , as well as exact results in the limit of infinite repulsion @xcite .",
    "this article is organized as follows : in section  [ formulation ] we work out the analytical solution for two atoms based on the bethe - peierls boundary condition , as a preliminary to the three - body problem that is introduced in section  [ s:3b ] . in sections  [ 3-fermions - problem ] and [ 3-bosons - problem ]",
    "we derive the energy spectra for fermions and bosons , respectively , focusing on the limit of strong repulsion in section  [ fermionization ] . in section  [ results_analysis ]",
    "we compare three - fermion energies with those obtained from ci calculations employing different single - particle basis sets .",
    "after the conclusion ( section  [ s : conclusion ] ) , [ two_body_solution ] presents an alternative derivation of the two - body solution and [ a_pq ] explains the calculation of the matrix elements that occur in the equations for the three - body problem .",
    "as a preliminary step , it is convenient to recall the exact solution of the two - body problem with contact interaction in a one - dimensional trap . whereas in [ two_body_solution ] we work out this solution following the original calculation by busch and coworkers @xcite , in this section we present an alternative approach based on the application of the bethe - peierls boundary condition .",
    "we will extend this method to three atoms in sections  [ 3-fermions - problem ] and [ 3-bosons - problem ] .    in a trap with tight transverse confinement ,",
    "the low - energy dynamics is effectively one - dimensional .",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath1 for two particles has the following form : @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the atom mass , @xmath4 is the frequency of the harmonic oscillator , @xmath5 is the interaction strength of the contact interaction , @xmath6 . throughout the paper we place bars over certain quantities having physical dimensions to discriminate them from their dimensionless counterparts .",
    "physically , the contact interaction is a pseudopotential which mimics van der waals inter - atomic interaction at low energies @xcite . the handle to tune",

    "a change in the magnetic offset field through a feshbach resonance modifies @xmath13 , and hence @xmath5 .",
    "it is clear from that the vanishing of the denominator  a resonance due to the tranverse confinement  allows to reach the `` unitarity '' limit , @xmath14 , going from @xmath15 to @xmath16 or vice versa by a small field variation .",
    "because the interaction in hamiltonian is short - ranged , it affects only two fermions having opposite spins , hence the solution is the same as the one for spinless bosons .",
    "it is useful to decouple center - of - mass and relative motions by introducing the coordinates @xmath17 and @xmath18 , hence the total hamiltonian is the sum of two terms , @xmath19 with @xmath20 and @xmath21 where the center - of - mass term is a non - interacting harmonic oscillator with doubled mass @xmath22 and energy @xmath23 , with @xmath24 furthermore , by using @xmath25 as energy unit and @xmath26 as length unit , we introduce in the relative - motion frame the dimensionless variables @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , with @xmath31 .",

    "one way is to expand the wave function @xmath32 over the eigenstates of the non - interacting problem , i.e. the states of the harmonic oscillator @xmath34 with @xmath35 being the hermite polynomial of order @xmath36 .",
    "this approach follows the original derivation by busch and coworkers @xcite and is detailed in [ two_body_solution ] . in this section",

    "indeed , the wave function in the relative frame is even , displaying a bosoniclike behavior , hence for strong repulsion it is expected to exhibit the same observable properties as fully polarized fermions that are noninteracting . the same behavior is expected in the presence of strong attraction but only for ` super - tonks - girardeau ' excited states @xcite , as the lowest collapsing state has no fermionic counterpart .",

    "the reason is that attractive interactions squeeze the wave function probability weight at lower values of the relative distance @xmath59 between two atoms .",

    "for example , using the eigenstates of the harmonic oscillator in the relative - motion frame we found a significant enhancement of convergence for two fermions . however , this path may be unpractical for more fermions , due to the complexity of two - body interaction matrix elements represented in this basis . some authors proposed effective - interaction schemes or similar techniques borrowed by nuclear physics @xcite .",
