    "a laser - ion interaction is imposed to create a spin - dependent force on the ions by using bichromatic laser beams to couple these clock states to a third state via stimulated raman transitions  @xcite . effectively , this process is equivalent to an off - resonant laser coupling to the two clock states by a small frequency detuning @xmath18 determined by the frequency difference of the bichromatic lasers .",

    "the magnetic field @xmath27 is made in the @xmath26-direction by directly driving a resonant radio - frequency field with frequency @xmath30 between the two hyperfine states to implement the spin flips  @xcite or by indirect raman coupling through a third state to effectively couple the two hyperfine states  @xcite .",

    "while it is also possible to examine incoherent effects due to thermal phonons present at the start of the simulation , we do not do that here , and instead focus solely on intrinsic phonon creation due to the applied spin - dependent force .    in time - dependent perturbation theory ,",

    "the entanglement evolution operator @xmath112 is a complicated object in general , but it simplifies when one can approximate the operator @xmath112 as @xmath113 for the special situations discussed at the end of the last subsection . in general , this evolution operator involves a coupling of spins to phonons in all directions and has a very complicated time dependence .",
    "if one evaluates the first few terms of the series for the time - ordered product , one finds it involves multispin interactions , spin - phonon coupling , and spin - exchange interactions in all spatial directions .",
    "but the net weight of all of the terms is governed by the integral of the magnetic field over time , so if that integral is small , then this factor will also be small .",
    "therefore , the adiabatic elimination of phonons based on mlmer - srensen gate  @xcite can be justified only in the case of a vanishing transverse magnetic field . with a constant magnetic field ,",
    "the entanglement between spins and phonons can be periodic so that phonon effects can continue to be nulled at integer multiples of the appropriate period  @xcite .",
    "but such a procedure would be more complicated than the standard gate , and is not relevant for adiabatic state creation simulations , so we wo nt discuss it further here . from a mathematical standpoint , because the entanglement evolution operator is on the far right of the factorization , it s main effect is to modify the state from an initial spin state in direct product with the phonon vacuum to a state that will typically involve some degree of entanglement between phonon and spin degrees of freedom .",
    "we can use this factorization to show that in cases where the spin - entanglement evolution operator can be approximated by the unit operator , then phonons have no observable effects on the probability of product states ( regardless of the number of coherent phonons created during the simulation ) , so this result is similar in spirit to the original mlmer - srensen gate , but is different because it holds in the presence of a transverse field and requires no special times for periodic variations to recur . to do this",

    "we have explicit values for the first three factors , but the last term ( the entanglement evolution operator ) can be quite complicated ; we have also described situations where the exponent of that term is small and can be neglected . in this case , the probabilities to observe any of the @xmath122 product states with a quantization axis along the ising axis ( @xmath123 for the @xmath1 ionic spins ) is unaffected by the presence of an arbitrary number of real excited phonons ( which are excited by the phonon - spin evolution operator ) . using the fundamental axiom of quantum mechanics , the probability @xmath124 to observe a product spin state @xmath125 starting initially from the phonon ground state @xmath93 and not measuring",

    "the operator in the matrix element entangles the phonons and the spins , so we evaluate the matrix element in two steps : ( 1 ) first we evaluate the phonon part of the operator expectation value , and then ( 2 ) we evaluate the spin part . note that since the pure phonon factor of the phonon evolution operator",
    "@xmath129 $ ] is a phase factor , it has no effect on the probabilities when evaluated in the phonon number operator basis , so we can drop that factor .",
    "next , the term @xmath130 $ ] gives 1 when operating on the phonon vacuum to the right , so it can be dropped .",
    "we are thus left with three factors in the evolution operator .",
    "one involves exponentials of the phonon creation operator multiplied by spin operators ( and is essentially a coherent - state excitation for the phonons with the average phonon excitation number determined by the spin state being measured ) , one involves products of spin operators that resulted from the factorization of the coupled phonon - spin evolution operator factor , and one is the pure spin evolution factor @xmath131 .",

    "using the fact that the product states satisfy the eigenvalue equation @xmath137 with eigenvalues @xmath138 ( for @xmath139 ) or @xmath140 ( for @xmath141 ) , we arrive at the expression for the probability @xmath142}\\ ] ] @xmath143 .\\ ] ] we used the matrix element @xmath144 @xmath145 in the derivation .",

    "if we do not measure the probability of product states , then the terms from the coupled spin - phonon evolution operator remain spin operators , and one can show that the probabilities are changed by the phonons .",
    "in other words , it is because the spin - phonon evolution operator is diagonal in the product space basis for phonons and spins that allows us to disentangle the phonon and spin dynamics . in cases where this can not be done",
    ", we expect the phonon and spin dynamics to remain entangled .",
    "in other words , phonons have observable effects on any spin measurements which introduces spin operators away from the _ ising quantization axis _ such as most entanglement witness operator measurements .",
    "finally , we may ask what does the entanglement evolution operator do to the system ?",
    "it is difficult to find any simple analytic estimates of the effect of this term , but it acts on the initial state which has the spins aligned along or opposite to the magnetic field and has no phonons . during the evolution of that operator ,",
    "new terms will be created which involve entanglement of spin states with states that have created phonons .",

    "the first is the _ ideal spin model _ which considers the evolution of the system with a static ising model ( spin - exchange coefficients are the time - averaged exchange coefficients ) and a time - dependent magnetic field . while one might think this is a purely adiabatic model",
    ", it has some diabatic effects , since the fully polarized state is _ not _ generically the ground state of the ising plus magnetic field hamiltonian because the ( static ) ising exchange interactions are nonzero at the initial time .",
    "hence , one can invoke a sudden approximation to the system initially , and find that the initial state is a superposition of different energy eigenstates .",
    "in addition , the magnetic field varies in time and hence can cause additional diabatic effects due to its derivative with respect to time .",

    "hence it has the static ising hamiltonian , the time - dependent ising interactions and the time - varying transverse magnetic field .",
    "this model can have its schrdinger equation solved in a spin - basis only , since all phonon effects are neglected except virtual phonon excitations .    the third model is the _ exact spin - phonon model _ , where we evolve the system according to the original spin - phonon hamiltonian expanded in the lamb - dicke limit [ eq .",
    "( [ eq : phonon ] ) ] .",
    "the only approximation used in this last model is the cutoff for the phonons .",
    "the strategy we use is to numerically integrate the schrdinger equation using a direct product basis which involves a spin state in direct product with a phonon state .",
    "we do this because the hamiltonian only connects states that differ by plus or minus one phonon number , and hence is block sparse in this basis .",
    "the spin states are chosen to include all possible ising spin states for the number of ions in the trap .",
    "the phonon basis is chosen to have a cutoff of a maximal phonon excitation . the maximal cutoff is always chosen to be larger than the average occupancy of the phonons in each normal mode of the ion chain .",
    "of course , we expect more phonons to be excited into the phonon modes closest to the beatnote frequency of the lasers , so the cutoffs that are chosen will vary from one normal mode to another .",
    "for example , we often find we can set the phonon cutoff to be one for some of the phonon modes far from the driving frequency of the spin - dependent force .",
    "to facilitate our discussion , we define the root - mean square average @xmath221 of the fully connected ising interaction for @xmath1 ions as @xmath222 in which the static ising interaction @xmath223 is given by the static term in eq .",

    "with all the respected discrete symmetries , we can construct the symmetric and antisymmetric ferromagnetic states of the spin - only hamiltonian as @xmath231 or @xmath232 which is in the ( even , even ) or ( even , odd ) sectors , respectively .",

    "there are two intrinsic errors which can impede the quantum simulation in trapped ions .",
    "the first is diabatic effects which occur primarily when either parameters in the hamiltonian are changed too rapidly in time , or when energy gaps in the instantaneous eigenvalue spectrum become to small .",
    "the second is the error induced by phonons in the presence of time - dependent transverse magnetic fields .",
    "for example , the phonon - spin hamiltonian does not have spin - reflection symmetry because it is linear in the @xmath22 operators , and hence the spin - phonon interaction breaks this @xmath237 symmetry .",
    "one consequence of this is to couple the symmetric and antisymmetric ferromagnetic states which is likely to reduce the spin entanglement of the ghz state .",
