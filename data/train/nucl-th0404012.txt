    "midrapidity @xmath7 experiments at rhic energies display strong suppression in @xmath8 spectra at high @xmath9  @xcite .",
    "this effect was explained by jet energy loss ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) . to investigate whether initial state effects play a role in this suppression ,",
    "@xmath2 experiments were carried out . instead of suppression , an enhancement has been seen in minimum bias data @xcite ( the `` cronin effect '' in @xmath10 collisions at fermilab energies @xcite ) .",
    "this result indicates the absence of extra shadowing ( gluon saturation ) , related to proposed wave - function modifications in the fast moving @xmath5 nucleus ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) . however , new data with centrality dependence in midrapidity @xmath2 collisions @xcite could provide more detailed information about the interplay between nuclear multiscattering @xcite and ( standard ) nuclear shadowing @xcite .",
    "analysis of recent data at forward rapidities  @xcite can give more insight into the @xmath11-dependence of nuclear effects .",
    "here we display the results of our nlo pqcd calculations on pion production at at different centralities . in parallel , we consider available data at forward rapidities in @xmath2 collisions @xcite , and investigate them theoretically .",
    "we perform calculations on @xmath1 production in @xmath2 collisions using a pqcd - improved parton model extended by a glauber - type collision geometry  @xcite . introducing nuclear thickness function , @xmath12 , with a woods  saxon formula for @xmath5 and @xmath13 with a sharp sphere for @xmath14 ,",
    "the invariant cross section is obtained as  @xcite : @xmath15               { \\frac{d_{c}^{\\pi } ( z_c , \\tilde{q}^2)}{\\pi z_c^2 } }   \\,\\ ,   .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in our next - to - leading order ( nlo ) calculation  @xcite , @xmath16 represents the born cross section of the partonic subprocess , and @xmath17 is the corresponding higher order correction term  @xcite .",
    "we fix the factorization and renormalization scales and connect them to the momentum of the intermediate jet , @xmath18 ( where @xmath19 ) , reproducing @xmath20 data at rhic with high precision at high @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "the approximate form of the 3-dimensional parton distribution function ( pdf ) is : @xmath21 here , the function @xmath22 represents the standard nlo pdf as a function of momentum fraction of the incoming parton , @xmath23 , at scale @xmath24 ( we use mrst(cg ) ) .",
    "the partonic transverse - momentum distribution is defined phenomenologically as a 2-dimensional gaussian , @xmath25 , and characterized by an `` intrinsic @xmath4 '' width  @xcite .",
    "nuclear multiscattering is accounted for through broadening of the incoming parton s @xmath4-distribution function , namely an increase in the width of the gaussian : [ ktbroadpa ] 2av_pa = 2av_pp + ( b ) ( b ) = c h_pa(b )  .",
    "pion production in @xmath20 collisions at rhic energy indicates the value @xcite . considering the multiscattering part",
    ", @xmath26 describes the number of _ effective _ @xmath27 collisions ( or _ effective _ collision length for partons ) at impact parameter @xmath28 , which impart an average transverse momentum squared , @xmath29  @xcite . at sps energies",
    "the effectivity function @xmath26 was written in terms of the number of collisions suffered by the incoming proton in the target nucleus .",
    "for this energy region we have found a limited number of semihard collisions , @xmath30 and the value @xmath31 0.35 gev@xmath32  @xcite , which implies a total broadening @xmath33 gev@xmath32 .",
    "we will assume these values at rhic energies , although the precise energy and rapidity dependence of @xmath34 and @xmath29 is not yet verified .",
    "the nuclear pdf , @xmath35 , incorporates the shadowing parametrization used in hijing  @xcite .",
    "extra gluon saturation ( cgc )  @xcite would require a further suppression factor to be introduced .",
    "the experimental data will decide if such an extra suppression factor is necessary .",
    "fragmentation function ( nlo kkp ) , @xmath36 , in eq .",
    "( [ hadx ] ) is responsible for the hadronization of parton @xmath37 into a pion with momentum fraction @xmath38 at scale @xmath39 .",
    "we present results on the nuclear modification factor , defined as follows : @xmath40",
    "in fig . 1 we display the measured @xmath42 for @xmath1 production at @xmath43 gev at different centralities : @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 and @xmath47  @xcite .",
    "the first three centrality bins ( up to 60 % ) are similar to each other , only a slight decrease can be seen .",
    "[ fig1 ]    our theoretical pqcd results on @xmath1 , containing multiscattering and shadowing ( _ solid lines _ ) , show similar tendency and overlap with the preliminary phenix data .",
    "we predicted this behavior in ref .",
    "these data indicate the plateau of the applied woods  saxon density profile of the @xmath5 nucleus and the applicability of a @xmath28-independent shadowing in the model .",
    "the difference between data and theory in the most peripheral case requires further study . to indicate the importance of nuclear multiscattering in @xmath2 collisions",
    "we also show results containing only shadowing ( _ dotted lines _ ) .",
    "figure 2 summarizes brahms data on charged - hadron production at forward pseudorapidities  @xcite , cgc result at @xmath48 in the low-@xmath9 region  @xcite ( _ dashed line _ ) , and our pqcd results on @xmath1 at @xmath49 gev .",
    "we concentrate on the high-@xmath9 region , where no cgc result was available .",
    "the increasing strength of conventional nuclear shadowing with increasing pseudorapidity is indicated by pqcd results containing only this shadowing ( _ dotted lines _ , @xmath50 ) . including nuclear multiscattering ( cronin effect ) we obtain reasonable agreement between data and our pqcd calculations on @xmath42 ( _ solid lines _ ) .",
    "our results indicate the validity of pqcd description for @xmath2    [ fig2 ]",
