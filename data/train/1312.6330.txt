    "supernovae can reveal the properties of stars at this era because they are visible at high redshifts and their masses can be inferred from their light curves .",
    "recent calculations show that pair - instability ( pi ) and pulsational pair - instability ( ppi ) sne are visible in the near infrared ( nir ) at @xmath3 20 to _ jwst _ and the thirty meter telescope ( tmt ) @xcite .",
    "these explosions will also be visible at @xmath3 15 - 20 to the wide - field infrared survey telescope ( wfirst ) and the wide - field imaging surveyor for high redshift ( wish ) , which could harvest these events in large numbers because of their wide search fields .",
    "it is now known that core - collapse ( cc ) sne will be detected at @xmath4 10 - 15 by _ jwst _ , at @xmath3 7 - 10 by wfirst and wish , and at @xmath5 7 by _ euclid _ @xcite .",
    "supermassive sne @xcite and type iin sne @xcite will also be visible to these missions at @xmath6 15 .",
    "but could such events be detected in surveys now ? in principle , strong lensing by massive galaxy clusters at @xmath7 could boost flux from sne by factors of 10 or more and allow them to be detected at @xmath6 10 by current instruments .",
    "@xcite have estimated detection rates for strongly lensed sne at low redshifts in future all - sky surveys by the large synoptic survey telescope ( lsst ) , and @xcite have discovered a lensed sn at @xmath3 1.7 at the edge of the massive galaxy cluster a1689 .",
    "many such clusters have now been targeted by the cluster lensing and supernova survey with _ hubble _ ( _ clash _ ) to find type ia sne at @xmath3 2 @xcite . @xcite have already found three sne at @xmath8 0.4 in _",
    "clash_. the _ hubble space telescope _",
    "( _ hst _ ) frontier fields program will soon examine six additional cluster lenses to hunt for early galaxies .",
    "we have now calculated the number of sne that might be discovered at @xmath9 in _ clash _ and by future cluster surveys by _",
    "jwst_. we describe our lens model and derive lensing volumes as a function of redshift in section 2 . in section 3",
    ", we provide nir light curves for 15 - 40 @xmath10  cc sne . star formation rates at 5 @xmath11 25 compiled from gamma - ray burst ( grb ) rates , high - redshift galaxy luminosity functions , and numerical simulations are presented in section 4 . in section 5",
    ", these rates are convolved with lensing volumes and sn luminosities to determine the rates at which sne will be found by a single cluster lens as a function of redshift .",
    "we conclude in section 6 .",
    "in lieu of actual lensing maps for each cluster @xcite , which are not yet available for _ clash _ , we model a cluster lens as a singular isothermal sphere whose magnification , @xmath12 , is uniquely specified by its einstein radius , @xmath13 .",
    "we use equations 4 - 6 from @xcite to compute the area in the source plane that is magnified above a given @xmath12 with cosmological parameters from the most recent planck@xmath14wp@xmath14highl@xmath14bao data : @xmath15 0.308 and @xmath16 0.692 @xcite . lensing volumes as a function of @xmath12 and @xmath17 for @xmath18 35 and 55 arcsec",
    "are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : mu ] .",
    "these two radii bracket @xmath19 for 5 of the 25 clusters selected for _ clash _ and are typical of clusters with high @xmath12 ( the other 20 cluster lenses in the survey have @xmath20 10 - 30 arcsec ) . note that lensing volumes decrease with redshift above @xmath3 2 because the luminosity distance @xmath21 peaks and begins to fall above this redshift .",
    "this trend , plus the fact that star formation rates plummet at high @xmath17 as we show later , are the two greatest limitations to using cluster lenses to detect early sne .",
    "real clusters are better described by navarro - frenk - white ( nfw ) profiles . to check the validity of the sis approximation",
    ", we have redone the analysis of @xcite with nfw halos .",
    "although the sis has a very simple lensing distribution , the nfw lens is somewhat more complicated because there are two critical curves instead of just one , which leads to infinite magnification at a finite radius in the source plane and at the origin ( the latter is also true of the sis ) .",
    "we have solved the general lensing equation in the source plane for a range of lens and source redshifts , determining the locations of the images and calculating @xmath12 for each one .",
    "our calculations show that spherical nfw profiles have slightly larger magnifications than sis profiles for an equivalent einstein angle .",
    "our sis lensing volumes should therefore be taken to be lower limits .",

    "in fig .  [ fig : nir ] we show h band light curves for 15 - 40 @xmath10  population iii ( pop iii ) cc sne at @xmath22 7 and 10 in the _ hst _ wide - field camera 3 ( wfc3 ) 1.63 @xmath12 m filter , whose sensitivity limit is @xmath23 ab mag 27.3 for total exposure times of a few 10@xmath24 s. these explosions are designated by progenitor type ( z - series are explosions of red supergiant stars ) , mass ( 15 , 25 and 40 @xmath10 ) and energy ( b , d , and g are 0.6 , 1.2 and 2.4 @xmath25 erg ) @xcite .",
    "our sne and spectra were modeled with the los alamos rage and spectrum codes @xcite .",
    "the spectra were then cosmologically redshifted , dimmed , and convolved with absorption by the neutral igm and _ hst _ and _ jwst _ filter response functions to obtain nir light curves .",
    "what mostly determines the light curve of a cc explosion is its energy and the internal structure of the star .",
    "rotational and convective mixing lead to similar structures for zero- and solar - metallicity stars of equal mass .",
    "because the energy of the sn depends on the entropy profile of the core of the star prior to explosion , it also does not vary strongly with metallicity ( see fig .  1 of * ? ? ?",
    "furthermore , at zero metallicity most 15 - 40 @xmath10  stars are thought to die as red supergiants because of internal mixing over their lives . for these reasons ,",
    "our light curves are likely to be representative of cc sne over all the redshifts in our study , not just the earliest epochs .",
    "we consider only cc sne because pi and type iin sne need little or no magnification to be seen by _ clash _ and they are much less frequent than type ii sne .    unlike the fiducial 15 @xmath10  cc sn in @xcite",
    ", our sne have h band fluxes that can be detected by _",
    "clash _ with only moderate @xmath26 10 - 20 at 5 @xmath27 . at @xmath28 15",
    "there is essentially no flux at 1.63 @xmath12 m so _ hst _ would not detect type ii events above this redshift . at @xmath22 15 they are brightest in the 2.77 @xmath12 m _ jwst _ nircam filter , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : nir ] . at this redshift ,",
    "three of the sne exceed the nircam detection limit of ab mag 32 without being lensed , and @xmath12 of only @xmath23 2 - 5 are required to boost the others above this limit . only modest magnifications would be required to boost the z15b , z15d , z15 g , z40d and z40 g explosions above the detection limit for _ jwst _ at @xmath22 20 , so a cluster lens could in principle reveal cc sne from this epoch .",
    "but small lensing volumes and low star formation rates above @xmath3 13 make it unlikely that a cluster survey would encounter such events , as we discuss below .",
    "we show star formation rates ( sfrs ) inferred from the luminosity functions of early galaxies @xcite , from grb rates @xcite , and from numerical simulations @xcite for 5 @xmath29 25 in fig .",
    "[ fig : sfr ] ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* for other sfrs from simulations that fall within the range shown here ) .",
    "the sfrs from early galaxies exclude the steep faint end slopes of low luminosity galaxies and are likely lower than the true rates .",
    "the sfrs from @xcite and @xcite above @xmath4 5 - 7 are mostly extrapolated from those at lower redshifts .",
    "for sfrs above @xmath3 15 we must rely entirely upon simulations .",
    "sfrs from grbs vary by @xmath23 50% at @xmath30 and by a factor of 10 at @xmath22 15 .",
    "the rates from early galaxies vary by the similar factors over the same redshifts , with an overall spread in sfr between the two methods of a factor of @xmath23 400 at @xmath22 15 .",
    "the rates predicted by numerical simulations also vary by about two orders of magnitude from @xmath3 10 - 25 .",
    "the sfrs in most of these models are just those in a few protogalaxies in their simulation volumes and are therefore subject to small box statistics .",
    "the simulations also include a variety of feedback processes that lead to a wide range of evolution in stellar populations over cosmic time .",
    "we sample this broad range of sfrs with three fits . on the low end",
    "is the dashed line in fig .",
    "[ fig : sfr ] that borders the simulations with the lowest sfrs from below . as a middle case , we take the dashed line through the simulations with the higher sfrs down to @xmath22 15 , where it intersects with the grb rates , and then adopt the grb rates down to @xmath22 5 .",
    "as an upper case , we take the upper dashed line down to @xmath3 12 , where the sfr is 0.2 @xmath10  yr@xmath31 mpc@xmath32 , and then level off the sfr at this rate down to @xmath22 5 .",
    "this rate is equal to sfrs inferred from both grbs and sn measurements at @xmath3 3 ( for the latter , see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and is a conservative upper limit .",
    "the sn rate can be derived from the cosmic sfr if the initial mass function ( imf ) and upper and lower mass limits for cc sn production are known . by @xmath33",
    ", most stars form in young galaxies in which metals and dust are produced , so we adopt the salpeter imf and the usual rule of thumb of @xmath23 1 sn / 100 @xmath10  of stars formed for this mass distribution .",
    "this imf underestimates the sn rate above @xmath3 12 because a greater fraction of sf likely goes into stars above 20 @xmath10 , so our sn rates should be taken as lower limits .",
    "we have verified that our choice of sn rate per solar mass does not vary by more than a factor of two for reasonable choices of upper and lower masses for cc sne and our imf .",
    "this is far less than the uncertainty in the cosmic sfr itself , which is up to a factor of @xmath23 400 . for simplicity",
    ", we also take the 3 or 4 brightest of our sne to represent cc sne at high redshift in general .",
    "if sfr is the rate of star formation observed today and d@xmath34 is the cadence , or time between observations of a given cluster , the rate and time between observations at redshift @xmath17 are sfr @xmath35 and d@xmath36 , respectively .",
    "the number of sne enclosed by the lensing volume @xmath37 whose flux is boosted by a factor @xmath12 or more at redshift @xmath17 over the time d@xmath34 in the observer frame is then @xmath38 to obtain the total number of sne above a given redshift @xmath39 whose flux would be boosted above _ clash _ or _ jwst _ detection limits , we integrate eq .  5 over all @xmath17 above that redshift and all @xmath12 above the minimum magnification needed to detect the event at each redshift . we assume an average cadence d@xmath40 3 months and take @xmath41 to be @xmath23 10 for _ clash _ at @xmath33 for our sne because their peak ab magnitudes do not evolve strongly over this range .",
    "we assume @xmath42 2 for @xmath43 for _ jwst _ as a conservative estimate , since even at @xmath3 20 some of the sne do not have to be lensed to be detected .",
    "the total number of sne that would be found by 35 and 55 arcsec lenses in _ clash _ and by _ jwst _ are plotted in the left and right panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : nsne ] , respectively .",
    "the sfrs used in each plot are designated by `` hi '' ( high ) , `` med '' ( medium ) , and `` low '' ( low ) , the three fits described at the end of section 4 .",
    "we include curves for @xmath26 20 for _ clash _ and for @xmath26 5 for _ jwst _ to consider dimmer events .    for ( very ) low sfrs ,",
    "the number of sne that _ clash _ would detect in both lenses is too small to appear on these plots . for the medium rates at @xmath26 10 ,",
    "the 35 and 55 arcsec lenses would find 0.08 and 0.2 sne , respectively , or 1 - 3 events total above @xmath44 5 .",
    "for the high rates , the two lenses would detect 0.2 and 0.5 sne , or 3 - 9 events at @xmath45 5 in the entire survey .",
    "if all the sne at this epoch were dimmer events that require magnifications of 20 to be seen , at most one or two would be detected by _",
    "clash_. the practical limit to cc sn detections with _",
    "clash _ is @xmath3 12 - 13 ; above these redshifts , the number of sne that either lens would detect is too low for any to appear in the survey , even at high sfrs .",
    "however , at sfrs that are between the medium and high rates , one or two sne in the survey could be @xmath3 10 - 12 events . the total number of cc sne that may be found in _",
    "clash _ is similar to the number of pi sne that might be found by _ jwst _ at @xmath3 20 over its mission life @xcite .    future cluster surveys by _ jwst",
    "_ that are similar in scope to _ clash _ will detect far greater numbers of cc explosions at 5 @xmath29 12 .",
    "for the medium sfrs at @xmath26 2 , the 35 and 55 arcsec lenses would detect 18 and 40 events each . unlike _ clash _ , _ jwst _ would detect events even at the lowest sfrs : at @xmath26 2 , the two lenses could observe 1.5 and 3 sne each .",
    "even 1 - 2 dimmer events would appear in such surveys at these rates .",
    "furthermore , _",
    "jwst _ would find 1 - 3 cc sne at @xmath4 15 - 17 , almost the era of first star formation .",
    "although primordial sne wo nt be discovered prior to the arrival of _ jwst _ , wfirst and the next generation of extremely large telescopes , our calculations show that _ clash _ may already have found a few sne ( and perhaps up to 10 ) at 5 @xmath0 12 , redshifts well above those at which sne have been found to date ( @xmath22 3.9 ; * ? ? ?",
    "such detections could probe the properties of stars in the first galaxies and constrain the cosmic sfr at 5 @xmath46 to within the uncertainty of the imf over this interval , which is much smaller .",
    "even the failure to detect sne in _ clash _ would be useful because it would place upper limits on sfrs at 5 @xmath46 by ruling out the models with the highest rates .",
    "our results argue for the use of longer cadences in future surveys of cluster lenses , both to capture more events and more easily identify explosions with slowly evolving luminosities as transients .",
    "any doubt over whether a particular event is actually a sn could easily be resolved by additional observations of that cluster .",
    "future surveys by _ jwst _ that are similar in scope to _ clash _ could discover hundreds of sne out to @xmath3 15 - 17 , but not at higher redshifts because event rates are so low and the lensing volumes with the @xmath12 needed to reveal the sne are so small . an alternate approach might be to exploit the strong lensing of events everywhere on the sky at some redshift by all the structures below that redshift in future wide - field surveys .",
    "far greater volumes at high redshifts could be lensed in this manner than by galaxy clusters , albeit at lower average magnifications , and compensate for the low sfrs at @xmath6 15 .",
    "this approach would be ideally suited to future all - sky campaigns by wfirst and wish .",
    "it is not yet known if the lower peak @xmath12 in all - sky lensing , which are due to the smaller masses of lenses at high @xmath17 , will be sufficient to boost flux from ancient sne above the detection thresholds of these missions .",
    "calculations are now underway to determine if strong lensing in all - sky surveys will open yet another window on the primordial universe .",
