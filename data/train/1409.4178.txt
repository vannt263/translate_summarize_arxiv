    "understanding large - scale cortical dynamics and their relationship to the underlying anatomy is key to unlocking the computational principles of the brain . despite cytological differences at the microscopic level ,",
    "the repetitive design of mesoscopic motifs  circuits , columns and local hierarchies  is a stand - out feature of brain anatomy . by promising a way of scaling up in size ,",
    "this repetitive principle is likely crucial to the success of the very large - scale computational modeling efforts currently underway .",
    "from this view , it is the larger scale structural connectivity and topological constraints of macroscopic anatomy that plays the crucial role in sculpting information processing in the cortex  @xcite . according to this modern connectionist approach ,",
    "the anatomical network is fundamental because the functionally specialized and integrative roles of cortical regions come from their interactions with other brain regions , not only from their microscopic particularities .",
    "functional network is a widely used approach to study one of the major current paradigms of neuroscience : the relationship between structure and dynamics  @xcite . whilst the physical structure remains roughly constant on the time scale of minutes to hours ,",
    "the dynamic states of cortical regions evolve in a coordinated way to perform a multitude of tasks , which vary on far shorter time scales .",
    "although some states of brain dynamics are very general and common , at least among individuals of a same species , others are very particular , and perhaps unique .    spanning different neuronal scales",
    ", synchronization is an important dynamical feature that can increase the effectiveness of interactions between brain regions , for example by aligning neuronal spikes from different regions into critical windows for spike - time dependent plasticity  @xcite .",
    "indeed , an emerging paradigm considers synchronization as _ the _ key feature that modulates cortical interactions  @xcite : accordingly , its maximum effectiveness is achieved when two mutually interacting areas are phase coupled .",
    "the synchronization strength between regions is thus fundamental , and a functional network is composed of nodes that are linked by highly correlated pairs .",
    "the interactions between brain regions , in turn , are not static but rather erratic , depending on their dynamics and past activity  @xcite .",
    "such a dynamic balance of integration and instability likely underlies the need for cortical function to switch according to the changing environmental needs  @xcite .",
    "hence , variable and flexible dynamics , which depends on coupling delay  @xcite and the balance of excitation and inhibition  @xcite , is a hallmark of adaptive cognitive behaviour .    understanding dynamic functional networks",
    "is not only an important topic , but also a rather complex one . as with any problem endowed with complexity , a wise strategic approach is required .",
    "a standard way to reduce the level of complexity is to divide the problem into pieces . often , however , it is not clear which is the best way to split the problem .",
    "neuronal systems are clearly more than the sum of their parts : extrapolations thus demand careful analysis .",
    "the fingerprints of small motifs have already become a standard procedure to understand the structure of complex networks  @xcite .",
    "a recent , promising approach to understanding the relationship between structure / dynamics on complex networks consists of studying the structure / dynamics relationship in network motifs  @xcite .",
    "this rests on the premise that the dynamical features of network motifs plays a role in shaping the dynamics and synchronization of complex networks  @xcite .",
    "the connections between cortical regions in the brain , as derived from the primate cortical network obey a few general principles that may inform the study of structure / dynamic analyses  @xcite : first , the brain topology is hierarchical with cortical regions occupying the highest positions in the hierarchy  @xcite .",
    "second , spatial clustering leads to a modular architecture , in which nodes are strongly interconnected with regions within the same cluster  typically nearby in space  than with regions outside their cluster  @xcite .",
    "third , some nodes can be classified as hubs because they have a degree larger than the average node degree of the network  @xcite .",
    "these principles have been linked to evolutionary and functional advantages as well as optimization arising from the physical and metabolic constraints under which brains operate on evolutionary time scales  @xcite .",
    "these general network properties can also shape the dynamics and synchronization of cortical networks  @xcite .",
    "however , a complete understanding of how the structural constraints of the anatomical connectivity influence dynamics is lacking , particularly regarding the mechanisms underlying the variability of synchronization .",
    "here we analyse the synchronization patterns as they arise in small motifs , prototypical modular structures , and cortical networks .",
    "we aim to identify factors that enrich the landscape of synchronized cortical states .",
    "the paper is structured as follows : we first describe mesoscopic dynamics as they arise from small motifs of coupled neural masses .",
    "we retrace recent work that highlights the stablising role of reciprocally coupled pairs ( which we call resonant pairs ) on the motifs ( small subnetworks of 3 nodes ) in which they are embedded .",
    "this influence is contrasted with that of closed loops , which introduce frustration into the system .",
    "frustrated motifs hence disrupt stability and synchrony , introducing metastability and variability .",
    "we then study these two competing influences in small constructed modular networks .",
    "we subsequently examine structural networks derived from tracing studies of the macaque brain , using the distribution of motifs to link the observed dynamics to those on our prototypical networks .",
    "we employed numerical methods to study neuronal dynamics on large - scale cortical networks .",
    "each node was considered as a conductance based neural mass model  @xcite , described in detail in the appendix .",
    "this approach reduces the dimensionality of a cortical region in each node to three nonlinear differential equations , which govern the dynamics of the excitatory subpopulation , the inhibitory subpopulation and the fraction of open potassium channels .",
    "analysis of such a reduced model is required to render the problem of large - scale cortical dynamics tractable .",
    "distributed cortical regions are coupled together through long - range excitatory connections with a delay of 10 ms ( unless otherwise stated ) to account for finite axonal conduction speed  @xcite . in our mesoscale model ,",
    "the dynamic variables start from random initial conditions .",
    "exploring the phase space can lead to different basins of attraction and different transient dynamics , causing considerable trial - to - trial variability , consistent with experiments  @xcite .",
    "this variability is an intrinsic feature of many large - dimensional systems .",
    "occasionally , such variability can also arise from transitions between metastable states .",
    "the following results should not be interpreted as deterministic outcomes of the model , but instead as likely statistical outcomes revealed through a large number of repetitions of the same numerical experiment .",
    "deeper statistical features , in contrast , are remarkably persistent . for instance , nodes oscillate with two dominant frequencies , a slow @xmath010 hz and a fast @xmath0100 hz time scale , and two mutually coupled nodes typically synchronize in anti - phase synchrony  @xcite .",

    "motif m13 has node labels determined beforehand , whereas motif m13 has node labels determined _ a posteriori _ such that the zero - lag synchronization between nodes 1 and 3 is maximized .",
    "first and second columns represent time traces of individual neural mass models ( 1 and 3 , 1 and 2 respectively ) , whereas the third and forth columns represent the cross - correlation functions between node pairs of the corresponding single time series and averaged over 40 trials respectively with pairs 1 - 2 in blue and 1 - 3 in red . ]",
    "we begin our analysis by focussing on 3-node motifs , whose enumeration ( m1 , m2 , ... , m13 ) follows the seminal work of sporns and ktter ( 2004 )  @xcite . as illustrated in the time",
    "traces for the common driving motif ( m3 ) in the weak - coupling regime , robust synchronization between the driven nodes ( 1 and 3 ) does not occur ( fig .",
    "1a ) , nor between directly coupled nodes ( fig .",
    "the lack of synchronization is also evident from the cross - correlation functions for one ( fig .",
    "1 c ) and for an average of 40 trials ( fig .",
    "in contrast , strong zero - lag synchronization between these nodes ( 1 and 3 ) occurs in motifs ( such as m6 and m9 ) that possess a reciprocal connection between at least one pair of nodes ( figs .",
    "1 e - l ) .",
    "a crucial feature of the dynamics of these synchronized motifs ( m6 and m9 ) is that whereas the pair of edge nodes 1 and 3  which are indirectly connected via node 2  synchronize in - phase , the pairs of neighbouring nodes ( 1 - 2 and 2 - 3 ) synchronize in anti - phase at the slow rhythm .",
    "even with a coupling delay of 10 ms , owing to the internal dynamics of the neural mass models , the phase difference between the neighbouring nodes amounts to about 60 ms .",
    "hence , mutually connected nodes enhance the synchronization in these small motifs , an effect that we previously showed that can propagate along chains of connected nodes  @xcite .",
    "importantly , this tendency of synchronized neighbouring nodes to oscillate in anti - phase can not be satisfied for all motifs : for some configurations , for example when three nodes are mutually connected among themselves ( motif m13 ) , this tendency of synchronized neighbouring nodes to oscillate in antiphase is frustrated . typically in this motif ( figs .",
    "1 m - p ) two out of the three pairs show anti - phase synchronization : when this happens , the third pair show in - phase synchronization .",
    "for example nodes 2 and 3 are in - phase for the case illustrated in figs .",
    "hence , this corresponds to an example of frustrated dynamics because although each pair shows a tendency to oscillate in anti - phase , only two out of the three pairs can accomplish this anti - phase configuration at any one time .",
    "starting from random initial conditions in this frustrated motif ( m13 ) , one can not predict which pair of nodes will synchronize in - phase .",
    "hence , the average zero - lag cross - correlation across trials between nodes 1 and 3 ( figs .",
    "1 i - l ) , as well as any other pair of nodes ( fig",
    ". 1 p ) , is markedly diminished following the incorporation of the mutual connection between nodes 1 and 3 .",
    "however , the selection of whichever two nodes have the maximum cross - correlation at zero - lag after each trial ( and assigning them the labels 1 and 3 _ a posteriori _ ) reveals that the maximum zero - lag synchronization in this frustrated motif can also be strong : we called m13 the auxiliary motif m13 that has nodes 1 and 3 labelled _ a posteriori _ to maximize the zero - lag synchronization between them ( figs .",

    "the preceding analyses illustrate the effect that the resonance pair has on promoting synchronization and , conversely , how frustration destabilizes the stable state in weakly coupled small motifs .",
    "we next studied the robustness of these results with respect to the coupling strength ( fig .",
    "nodes 1 and 3 do not show in - phase synchrony for the common driving ( m3 ) or frustrated ( m13 ) motifs , but they synchronize even for very weak coupling for motifs which have resonance pairs ( m6 and m9 ) .",
    "another motif that also exhibits zero - lag synchronization between nodes 1 and 3 is motif m13 .",
    "this shows that for sufficiently strong coupling , one pair of nodes synchronizes in phase in the frustrated motif . despite the unpredictable character of the particular pair of nodes that synchronize when parameters across all nodes are identical , a small mismatch ( such as a 10% reduction in the input current over one neural mass model ) breaks the symmetry , converting the distinct node to an apex .",
    "for example , a mismatch in node 2 favours phase synchronization between nodes 1 - 3 over the other pairs 1 - 2 , and 2 - 3 ( fig . 2 b ) .",
    "we now focus our analyses on canonical modular structures comprising two local communities connected through a single hub . in these prototypical modular networks , we set nodes to be mutually connected with every node within each module , and the hub is mutually connected to all other nodes .",
    "such modular structures , even for the smallest cluster size of only two nodes per module ( fig .",
    "3 a ) , contain frustrated motifs within clusters .",
    "in addition , this type of modular structure shares another common feature with small motifs : the hub plays the role of the apex node in motif m9 , and the clusters mimic the outer nodes ( fig .",

    "1k , l for motif m9 and c=0.01 . crosscorrelation between nodes 1 and 3 on motif m9 ( m13 ) resembles the maximum crosscorrelation between dc ( sc ) nodes . ]    to compare synchronization in modular structures against those in motifs , we focused on the cross - correlation between two nodes belonging either to the same cluster ( sc ) , or to different clusters ( dc ) . for each trial ,",
    "the pair of nodes were selected _ a posteriori _ as the two nodes exhibiting maximum zero - lag crosscorrelation .",
    "this was then averaged over all trials .",
    "the maximum phase synchronization between nodes belonging to different clusters resembles the phase synchronization between nodes 1 and 3 in motif m9 , whereas the maximum phase synchronization between nodes belonging to the same cluster resembles motif m13 ( figs .",
    "3 b and c ) .",
    "this confirms that the motif structure is indeed influential in shaping these modular dynamics .    in the weak coupling regime , the maximum synchronization between different clusters is remarkably similar to the synchronization between nodes 1 and 3 for motif m9 ( fig",
    "however , for stronger coupling , when the synchronization within clusters grows , the synchronization between different clusters decays . as a result ,",
    "the synchronization between clusters is only stronger than local synchronization for very weak coupling ( see black arrow in fig .",
    "we next tested the role of the intra - cluster connection strength in shaping the long - distance synchronization between clusters .",

    "4 b and c , the synchronization strength increases for both sc and dc as the weight w is reduced .",

    "3 b against red curve of fig . 4 b ) , we find that the synchronization inside a cluster is stronger for larger cluster sizes .",
    "having the maximum synchronization inside a cluster that grows with the size is an expected result because for larger clusters the total coupling is stronger by construction ( nodes inside a cluster are all - to - all connected ) , and the number of candidate pairs to synchronize also grows . on the other hand ,",
    "an unexpected result appears when comparing the synchronization between clusters for different cluster sizes ( blue curve of fig .",
    "3 b against red curve of fig . 4 c ) : in this case , the larger cluster gives rise to a weaker synchronization between clusters .",

    "the participation index ( see appendix ) , which quantifies the inter- to intra - modular connectivity ratio of each node  @xcite , shows that many nodes with low degree exhibit strictly intra - modular connections ( null participation index ; lower left hand corner of panel 6h ) .",

    "whilst our results so far were restricted to a delay coupling of 10 ms , it is important to note that the coupling delay also has a strong effect in the synchronization of the network and its variability ( fig . 7",

    ", we investigated the influence of structural connectivity on the diversity of synchronization patterns .",
    "we identified resonance and frustration as two major principles in sculpting the variability of the functional networks : reciprocal pairs enhance zero - lag synchronization via resonance - induced synchronization ; frustration decomposes stable synchronised dynamics into multiple competing stable solutions .",
    "together , the two principles appear to give rise to metastable dynamics in systems of different sizes , from motifs to cortical networks .",

    "changes in brain connectivity have been associated with pathological brain states , such as schizophrenia  @xcite and multiple sclerosis  @xcite .",

    "consistent with experiments and simulations in networks of spiking neurons  @xcite , our numerical analyses of large - scale oscillatory cortical ( modular and macaque ) networks show that the maximum variability of synchronization patterns occurs for moderate coupling : weaker coupling reduces the variability because fewer pairs can synchronize and the set of possible outcomes is restricted ; stronger coupling reduces the variability because the networks often become globally synchronized , and a smaller set of stable states is favoured over others .",
    "such changes might plausibly underlie the reduction in consciousness associated with anaesthesia  @xcite .",
    "this finding of maximal variability for moderate coupling reinforces the importance of homeostatic regulatory mechanisms to maintain the brain close to its optimal region of the parameter space  @xcite .",
    "our results are also consistent with prior analyses of the role of delays  @xcite and network size in shaping the cortical dynamics .",
    "whilst resonance - induced synchronization has been shown to hold for synchronised pairs , regardless of their phase relation  @xcite , frustration requires the synchronization between pair of nodes to be in anti - phase .",
    "anti - phase synchronization is a common phase relationship between separated cortical regions found in a variety of experimental sets  @xcite , and models  @xcite .",
    "the phase relation of the synchronization depends on many factors such as the balance between excitation and inhibition within a cortical region  @xcite , and the coupling strength between regions  @xcite .",
    "more importantly , however , anti - phase becomes the dominant regime when inter - region synapses involve a substantial conduction delay  @xcite .",
    "for this reason we argue that our model , which favours anti - phase synchronization , is a suitable model for the purpose of understanding the dynamics in large - scale cortical networks , in which long distance connections are invariably associated with conduction latencies  @xcite .",
    "extension of our conclusions to other systems should fundamentally depend on whether anti - phase synchronization , the condition for frustration to occur , is the stable solution for two coupled nodes .",
    "we have used a simple way of estimating the complexity of the landscape of cortical activity states .",
    "the advantage of this measure is that it is clear and intuitive to count the number of different possible dynamic outcomes .",
