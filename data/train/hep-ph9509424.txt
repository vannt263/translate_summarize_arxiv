    "a recent analysis of the strong and electroweak parameters extracted from lep / slc data has shown that there is better agreement between theory and experiment for the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) with light superpartners than for the standard model ( sm ) alone @xcite .",
    "if the superpartners of the mssm are light , then new top decay modes can exist .",
    "there are many compelling reasons to believe that the lightest superpartner is the lightest neutralino @xmath3 ( see reference @xcite for a review . ) a reconciliation of the strong coupling measurement at the scale @xmath10 , @xmath7 , the observed branching ratio of @xmath11 , @xmath8 , and the left - right asymmetry measured at the slc , @xmath9 , is suggested by the mssm where the lightest top squark ( stop ) @xmath0 , the lightest chargino @xmath12 , and the lightest neutralino @xmath3 have masses below @xmath6 , while all other superpartners are relatively heavy . as shown in fig .  2 of ref .",
    "@xcite , a large @xmath13 would preferentially require the branching ratio ( br ) of @xmath14 to be small .",
    "( the small branching ratio of any non  sm decay mode of the top quark is inferred from the current top quark data at the tevatron .",
    "this will be shown in sec .",
    "3 . ) over a large range of this parameter space , @xmath15 ( see fig . 1 of ref .",
    "therefore , the scenario arises where @xmath16 provided that @xmath17 .",
    "furthermore , if @xmath18 , and @xmath19 , then the dominant decay of @xmath0 is @xmath20  @xcite .",
    "this is a flavor  changing ",
    "neutral  current decay .",
    "also recently , an analysis has been performed by the d collaboration to exclude light stop squarks from the jet and missing transverse energy signature expected from stop squark pair production @xcite .",
    "the d  analysis relies on the large cross section for pair production of light stop squarks via the partonic processes @xmath21 and the distinctive final state @xmath22 when @xmath23 .",
    "the signature is two acollinear jets and large missing transverse energy ( @xmath24 ) .",
    "this signal is overshadowed by the background , however , when the @xmath25jet and/or @xmath24 spectra becomes soft . as a result",
    ", the d  analysis excludes the @xmath26 values inside the region formed by joining the points ( 40,0 ) , ( 60,30 ) , ( 95,40 ) , ( 110,20 ) , ( 85,0 ) and ( 40,0 ) gev . on the other hand , this region is excluded in a model independent fashion once @xmath27 and @xmath28 are specified . here ,",
    "we propose a method to improve the stop mass limit or discover the stop squark by studying the decays of the top quark to a stop squark and the lightest neutralino .    alternatively ,",
    "a light stop discovery or exclusion can result from analyzing the decay @xmath29 .",
    "we propose a search for this decay in @xmath1 production with the associated standard decay @xmath30 ( and the charge conjugate final state ) .",
    "this final state provides the distinctive signature @xmath31 , where @xmath32 and @xmath33 is a non@xmath34jet . demanding a high@xmath35 , isolated lepton in the central rapidity region of the detector guarantees a high triggering efficiency and reduces backgrounds . also , since we demand a leptonic decay of the @xmath36 boson and because of the @xmath37 cascade decay to a charm jet and neutralinos , the @xmath24 spectrum is harder than for direct stop pair production .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows : in sec .",
    "2 , we show how the cdf and d top quark data set an upper bound on any non  sm decay mode ( any mode other than @xmath38 ) of the top quark .",
    "hence , br(@xmath14 ) is bounded from above . in sec . 3",
    ", we explain the details of defining the signal and reducing potential backgrounds for observing stop by studying @xmath1 events .",
    "discussion and conclusions are presented in sec .",
    "the existence of the top quark is now firmly established @xcite .",
    "kinematic reconstruction of the decay products of the top quark in the decay @xmath39 ( and the charge conjugate decay ) suggests a top mass @xmath40 gev from the cdf data and @xmath41 gev from the d  data .",
    "both experiments have reported production cross sections , which are a function of the assumed top mass used in the analysis .",
    "it is important to remember that these experiments have optimized their search for the process",
    "@xmath42 , so they actually report the product of the top production cross section @xmath43 and the branching ratio squared @xmath44 , where @xmath34 = br(@xmath45 ) .",
    "based on single and double@xmath34tagged events , cdf has also reported a measurement of @xmath34  @xcite .",
    "finally , progress has been made in understanding the sm prediction for the production cross section @xcite , in which the effects of multiple soft - gluon emissions have been properly resummed .",
    "since the measurement of the cross section obtained from the `` counting '' experiments ( counting the observed total @xmath1 event numbers in various decay modes ) and the measurement of the mass of the top quark ( obtained from reconstructing the invariant mass of the top quark ) are not strongly correlated , one can combine these results to find the best fitted values for @xmath6 and @xmath43 @xcite . using these results",
    ", we construct a @xmath46 function for @xmath47 and @xmath44 :    @xmath48    in the above equation , we have taken the quadratic sum of the statistical and systematic errors for measuring @xmath6 .",

    "this number , then , gives us an upper limit on br(@xmath64 ) , where @xmath65 . from the results of the fit described above ,",
    "we conclude that br(@xmath66 ) for @xmath67 has to be less than @xmath68% .",
    "some comments are in order .",
    "we have assumed that the experiments observe @xmath45 , where a fraction of the @xmath34 quarks have been tagged .",
    "however , there might be non  sm decays involving @xmath34quarks , such as @xmath69 , where @xmath70 is a charged higgs boson .",
    "unfortunately , there is at present no way to exclude such a scenario for the data used in the fit described above when the mass of @xmath70 is about equal to @xmath71 .",
    "the counting experiment measurement of @xmath43 is sensitive to all events with a @xmath34jet plus additional jets in the final state that satisfy a certain set of cuts .",
    "the top mass measurement only uses those events from the counting experiment satisfying a @xmath71 mass constraint .",
    "however , some of the events in this mass distribution are background events , which are subtracted statistically using the background estimated by the counting experiment .",
    "therefore , we can not define a subset of events that is background free and excludes non  sm decays of the top quark containing a @xmath34quark . on the other hand ,",
    "the mass distribution of the non@xmath34jets for the counting experiment is consistent with that expected from a @xmath36 .",
    "we continue our current analysis using the assumption that the experiments do only measure the @xmath72 final state . with a larger @xmath1 data sample in the near future",
    ", it would be better to use double-@xmath34-tagged events ( from both @xmath73 and dilepton samples ) for the fit .    in the following section ,",
    "we study how to directly observe the non  sm decay mode of the top quark @xmath74 and determine the minimum branching ratio of this mode to be detected at the tevatron for a given set of the sparticle masses @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "in this section , we consider the mssm models in which @xmath75 and @xmath76 , @xmath19 , and all other superpartners are heavier than @xmath6 . hence",
    ", the dominant decay of @xmath0 is @xmath20  @xcite . since the branching ratios of the new decay modes are small ( @xmath77 ) compared to the @xmath72 final state , most top quarks decay in the standard fashion ( see sec .",
    "2 ) . as a result , we can use the @xmath34quark and a high@xmath35 lepton to @xmath78 @xmath1 production .",
    "the non  sm decay of the top quark @xmath74 provides an additional jet and missing transverse energy .",
    "the signature of the @xmath1 events of interest is thus @xmath79 .    throughout this study , we assume the top mass is 175 gev .",
    "the top quark pair production cross section is given by the qcd calculation , @xmath80 pb @xcite .",
    "for each model studied , we determine the detection efficiencies for the signal @xmath81 ( and the charge conjugate final state ) and the backgrounds .",
    "the intrinsic backgrounds are @xmath82 , @xmath83 ( and the charge conjugate final states ) and @xmath84 .",
    "for the signal rate , we include @xmath85 . for the background processes ,",
    "we include @xmath86 to account for the possible large to -2pt/@xmath87 background from @xmath88 decay .",
    "we note that to -2pt/@xmath87 can be faked if any additional jet or lepton escapes detection . the expected background event rate from @xmath36+jets , @xmath89+jets , etc .",
    "is calculated in the sm using pythia 5.7  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath90 + jets backgrounds are estimated from the @xmath90 + parton processes with a minimum @xmath35 = 20 gev . ( the other backgrounds coming from a jet faking an isolated lepton with high @xmath35 can be ignored after demanding also a large @xmath24 in the event . )",
    "signal events were generated for a set of @xmath26 points ( see table 1 ) beyond the d  search limit using an extended version of pythia 5.7  @xcite .",
    "because of the presence of two neutralinos in the final state , we expect that the signal will have a harder @xmath24 spectrum than the backgrounds .",
    "also , the correlation between the @xmath24 and the lepton momentum in pure @xmath36 decays , as observed in the transverse mass @xmath91 distribution , should not be present in the signal .",
    "the transverse mass @xmath91 is defined by the expression @xmath92 , where @xmath93 is the azimuthal angle between the lepton @xmath94 and the @xmath24 direction .",
    "finally , the hadronic activity should be lower for the signal than for the @xmath1 background .",
    "we find that the following cuts enhances the signal with respect to the backgrounds :    * @xmath95 .",
    "( i ) * @xmath96 ( ii ) * @xmath97 .",
    "( i ) * @xmath98 .",
    "jets are defined by summing the transverse energy @xmath87 in a toy calorimeter within a cone size @xmath99 so that the jet transverse energy @xmath100 gev .",
    "( iii ) * @xmath101 ( ii ) * fake  @xmath24 discrimination : @xmath102 , where @xmath103 are the highest and second highest @xmath87 jets and @xmath104 is the @xmath24 direction , and @xmath105 for all @xmath33 .",
    "@xmath106 is the azimuthal angle between the jet @xmath33 and the @xmath24 direction .",
    "( i )    the cuts are separated into 3 sets ( i  iii ) to show the behavior of the signal and background .",
    "set ( i ) includes the minimal cuts @xmath107 and @xmath108 .",
    "the effect of these cuts are illustrated in table 1 for 11 signal @xmath26 points and the 3 major backgrounds . for clarity ,",
    "we have broken down the @xmath1 background into three explicit final states : @xmath109 , @xmath110 , and @xmath111 , where @xmath112 .",
    "we find that the major background comes from the dilepton decays , @xmath111 , where one lepton escapes detection .",
    "note that the signal detection efficiencies @xmath113 are about the same , @xmath114 for various choices of @xmath26 points .",
    "also in table 1 , we present similar results using a wider pseudorapidity range : @xmath115 .",
    "we find that the detection efficiencies for the backgrounds do not change significantly , while the signal efficiencies increase by about 30% .",
    ".efficiency of cuts ( i  iii ) for signal and background . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "from a global fit to the available data for the top quark mass , production cross section , and sm branching ratio and the predicted top production cross section , we have determined the allowed non ",
    "sm branching ratio for top quark decay .",
    "this branching ratio is bounded to be less than about 25% at the 95% c.l .",
    "since this branching ratio is small , we studied the possibility of observing the rare decay of @xmath16 in association with the sm decay @xmath116 ( and the charge conjugate decays ) .",
    "additionally , we required @xmath117 , so that the dominant stop squark decay mode is @xmath5 . for the models studied",
    ", we found that the signal detection efficiency is approximately constant and almost independent of the stop or neutralino mass for the mass region considered .",
    "if no signal is found , we could exclude models with br(@xmath118 ) larger than .33 , .08 and .04 at the 3@xmath119 level for the tevatron with a luminosity of 200@xmath120 , 2@xmath121 and 10@xmath121 , respectively .",
    "if a signal is found , the signal ( background ) event yields for the smallest @xmath122 are 8(5 ) , 26(80 ) , and 68(430 ) for a 200@xmath120 , 2@xmath121 and 10@xmath121 data sample .",
    "if , contrary to our assumptions about the lightest chargino , @xmath123 , then the two body decay @xmath124 dominates . for models discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , a light chargino would preferentially decay via @xmath125 .",
    "the final state is similar to that from the sm decay , but the @xmath12 decay products are softer and have a lower acceptance .",
    "it is therefore better to detect the light chargino directly from chargino pair production than from the top quark decay .    in conclusion , we find that the prospect to observe a light stop at the tevatron is very promising .",
    "unless a stop signal can be found in the current or upcoming data at the tevatron , it will be difficult to reconcile experiment with low energy supersymmetry in the case that @xmath74 is the dominant non  sm decay mode .",
