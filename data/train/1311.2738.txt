    "<S> the interplay between a fast evolving stellar background , inner resonances and gas dynamics makes the central kpc of every disk galaxy , and of the milky way in particular , a complex and yet not fully understood environment . in particular , the gas fueling toward the central black hole depends on the galactic dynamics at large scale . </S>",
    "<S> such inflow rate appears to be a complex function of position , since several mechanisms and coupling between them can accelerate the gas flow or stop it at certain radii ( e.g. resonances ) . </S>",
    "<S> the rapid evolution of this region modifies the dynamics locally , which eventually changes the properties of the inflow . </S>",
    "<S> understanding the fine details of the center of a given galaxy requires an accurate knowledge of many parameters like the mass profile , the velocity distribution etc . </S>",
    "<S> such information is barely accesible from observations of external galaxies because of limited resolution , and studies in the milky way suffer from projection and extinction effects . </S>",
    "<S> we use a hydrodynamical simulation to address these issues and monitor the evolution of the structures in the galactic center . </S>"
