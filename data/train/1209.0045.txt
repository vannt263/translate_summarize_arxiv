    "in the 1950s when they were students conway and wraith apparently introduced the notion of a ` rack ' as capturing the properties of a conjugacy class in a group without having the group itself .",
    "the notion came into its own with applications to knot theory @xcite and is also of interest in 2-algebra . by a rack",
    "we will mean a set @xmath0 with an operation @xmath16 which we will denote @xmath17 such that @xmath18 and such that @xmath19 is bijective for all @xmath20 .",
    "if @xmath21 also holds for all @xmath20 then one has a ` quandle ' .",
    "this data is not , however , enough to reconstruct a group in a natural way and in this paper we add a further condition which we call an inverse property ( ip ) quandle and which in the conjugacy class case corresponds to being stable under group inversion . in section 2 we show that every ip - quandle leads to an associated group @xmath1 with a preferred presentation .",
    "the construction here is motivated from noncommutative differential geometry applied to finite groups , as in our recent work @xcite . from this point of view",
    "a ` lie algebra ' means the dual of the space of invariant differential 1-forms on the algebra of functions @xmath22 on the group .",
    "the irreducible such objects in the case of bicovariant differential structures are indeed given by conjugacy classes . more generally any ad - stable subset @xmath5 defines a ` lie algebra ' and equivalently a bicovariant calculus .",
    "we require @xmath0 to generate the group or equivalently the calculus to be connected . for any quasitriangular hopf algebra , including the finite group case trivially , an inner differential calculus leads to a braided - lie algebra@xcite and in the present case its lie bracket becomes conjugation .",
    "a noncommutative differential calculus is inner if there is a 1-form @xmath3 such that the exterior derivative can be expressed as @xmath23 $ ] , and this is always the case on a finite group or indeed any finite set . in this context",
    "it is natural to require @xmath0 to be closed under inversion so as that the differential calculus is symmetric ( the associated graph is bidirectional ) , so @xmath0 is an ip quandle .",
    "we show also in section 2 that in this situation of a group @xmath4 and @xmath5 we have @xmath24 with central kernel .",
    "this situation is very similar to that of a lie group @xmath4 where its lie algebra generates an associated connected and simply connected covering group with central kernel@xcite .",
    "groups which can be equipped with ` lie algebras ' in the sense above such that @xmath25 are clearly special and we study such covering or ` simply connected discrete lie groups ' further . in section  3 and show that every finite weyl group is ` simply connected ' in this sense with respect to the conjugacy class of reflections , including @xmath9 via its 2-cycles conjugacy class .",
    "we also study other quandles for @xmath9 and we cover dihedral groups @xmath26 .",
    "section  4 looks at a first interesting example of a discrete subgroup of a lie group , @xmath27 .",
    "here the usual universal covering map @xmath28 of @xmath29 restricts to a central extension @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the inverse image of @xmath12 .",
    "this latter map may be thought of as a discrete version of the topological universal covering map , and moreover @xmath32 , the braid group on three strands ( see @xcite ) .",
    "we show that this ` discrete universal covering ' map @xmath33 is an example of our theory where @xmath34 is a certain natural choice of ` lie algebra ' in our sense with @xmath35 .",
    "in section  5 we turn to the noncommutative geometry of finite groups obtained from ip quandles , so @xmath36 .",
    "although it is not clear how to define ` simply connected ' in noncommutative geometry , an analogue of the abelianization @xmath37 of the fundamental group is understood .",
    "we show that this noncommutative de rham cohomology @xmath38 of @xmath1 is essentially trivial when @xmath0 obeys a certain antisymmetry - type condition which we call ` locally skew ' .",
    "more precisely in this case @xmath39 the span of the inner generator @xmath3 which has no classical analogue .",
    "thus the classical part of the cohomology is trivial and the theorem says that our ` covering group ' @xmath1 in the locally skew case behaves geometrically like the universal cover of a topological group .",
    "we will have shown in section  4 that this applies to all simply laced weyl groups , which now proves a conjecture which the first author proposed some time ago@xcite , that @xmath40 for the 2-cycles class .",
    "our results settle the conjecture for all finite weyl groups as well as a similar result @xmath41 for the dihedral groups @xmath10 .",
    "we also show that @xmath42 generating @xmath43 is locally skew , so that the noncommutative cohomology here is also trivial when appropriately defined on this infinite group .",
    "our background is the theory of braided - lie algebras@xcite .",
    "a braided lie algebra is a coalgebra @xmath44 in a braided category equipped with a ` lie bracket ' @xmath45 $ ] subject to certain axioms .",
    "associated to every braided lie algebra is an induced map @xmath46 which obeys@xcite the yang - baxter or braid relations , and we say that a braided - lie algebra is regular when this map @xmath47 is an isomorphism . in the case of @xmath48 in the category of @xmath49-vector spaces where @xmath0 is a set and @xmath50 its associated coalgebra , a regular braided - lie algebra reduces to a rack . in general ,",
    "associated to a braided - lie algebra there is a braided enveloping bialgebra @xmath51 defined by relations of @xmath47-commutativity . in the rack case",
    "the bialgebra becomes the algebra of a monoid with relations of @xmath47 commutativity .",
    "explicitly this monoid is @xmath52 here @xmath53 is a map @xmath54 and makes @xmath55 into a braided set in the sense of @xcite . as a result",
    "the monoid @xmath56 has reasonable homological properties as an example of an m3-monoid in the notation of @xcite .",
    "note that it is clear that @xmath57 , since the monoid has quadratic relations and hence is graded by degree , while @xmath0 has degree  1 .    a left ip - quandle is a set @xmath0 with an operation @xmath58 obeying ( [ rack ] ) and @xmath21 for all @xmath59 , together with a permutation of @xmath0 denoted @xmath60 such that @xmath61    clearly this is necessarily a quandle since the third ip - axiom requires each @xmath19 to be bijective .",
    "it also follows that @xmath62 for all @xmath63 .",
    "the notion is modelled after the notion of an ip - quasigroup and note that we do not require an identity .",
    "next , it is easy to see that if @xmath0 is an ip - quandle then @xmath64 is central in @xmath56 for all @xmath63 .",
    "indeed , @xmath65 .",
    "let @xmath0 be an ip - quandle .",
    "we define the group @xmath1 as @xmath56 modulo the further relations @xmath66 for all @xmath63 .",
    "we say that the ip - quandle is _ embeddable _ if @xmath57 descends to an inclusion @xmath67 .",
    "clearly @xmath68 in @xmath1 for all @xmath69 .",
    "hence for an embeddable ip - quandle we have @xmath67 , closed under conjugation by @xmath1 and clearly closed under inversion .",
    "let @xmath70 with ip - quandle structure @xmath71 and corresponding properties for the inverses ( for example @xmath72 etc . )",
    "one can verify that the ip quandle axioms hold .",
    "however , viewed in @xmath1 we have @xmath73 when viewed in @xmath1 , so this ip - quandle is not embeddable .    on the other hand",
    ", we will normally be interested in ip - quandles constructed from existing groups and in this case the following applies .",
    "[ coverexact ] let @xmath4 be a group and @xmath0 an ad - stable generating subset @xmath74 closed under group inversion .",
    "then @xmath0 under conjugation and inversion is an embeddable ip - quandle , the canonical inclusion @xmath75 is a map of ip - quandles and covered by the canonical group homomorphism @xmath76 so that @xmath77 . moreover , its kernel @xmath78 defined by @xmath79 is a central subgroup of @xmath1 .",
    "this is straightforward .",
    "( 1 ) the relations defining @xmath1 already hold in @xmath4 , and @xmath0 generates @xmath4 so the map which associates to @xmath80 its corresponding element @xmath81 , is a surjection and descends to a group homomorphism @xmath82 , as stated .",
    "the canonical map @xmath83 likewise descending from @xmath57 composes with the surjection @xmath6 to give the inclusion @xmath84 , and hence is itself an injection .",
    "the image of @xmath85 can not contain @xmath86 as this would map under @xmath87 to @xmath88 and @xmath89 when viewed in @xmath4 .",
    "moreover , @xmath90 , @xmath91 by construction of @xmath1 .",
    "( 2 ) if @xmath92 under @xmath87 then for all @xmath63 we have @xmath93 .",
    "hence @xmath94 and @xmath59 agree as elements of @xmath0 and hence of @xmath1",
    ". therefore @xmath95 commutes with all elements of @xmath96 . since @xmath1 is generated by @xmath0 , the subgroup @xmath78 is central .    in view of this",
    "we henceforth think of @xmath67 and @xmath74 as sub ip - quandles without writing the map @xmath85 explicitly .    in the setting of the previous proposition , @xmath1 is universal in the sense that if @xmath97 is a group homomorphism and @xmath98 is an inclusion of ip - quandles such that @xmath99 then there is an induced group homomorphism @xmath100 such that @xmath101 commutes .",
    "suppose @xmath102 and @xmath98 obeys @xmath99 and @xmath103 .",
    "we define @xmath104 and extend this as a homomorphism of groups . here",
    "@xmath105 and @xmath106 .",
    "we have @xmath107 for all @xmath20",
    ". then @xmath108 and since @xmath0 generates @xmath1 this means that the diagram commutes .",
    "since we can always take @xmath109 among other possibilities , proposition  [ coverexact ] tells us that up to a central extension every group is ` quadratic ' in the sense of a set of generators such that the relations are of the form @xmath110 or quadratic , indeed with the quadratic relations obeying the braid or yang - baxter identity",
    ".    we will be interested in the following ` skew - symmetry ' condition .",
    "we think of ip quandles obeying this condition as being closest in some sense to a classical lie algebra :    let @xmath0 be an ip - quandle .",
    "we say that two elements @xmath111 are _ mutually skew _ if @xmath112 .",
    "we say that @xmath0 is _ skew _ if any two distinct elements are mutually skew .",
    "consider the graph on @xmath0 with an edge whenever two distinct elements are mutually skew .",
    "we say that @xmath0 is _ locally skew _ if this graph is connected .",
    "note that from its definition the notion of mutually skew is a property of the unordered pair , i.e. of the subset @xmath113 .",
    "also @xmath114 are mutually skew iff we have @xmath115 , while @xmath116 are always mutually skew .",
    "[ skewbraid ] let @xmath0 be an embeddable ip - quandle and @xmath69 .",
    "the following are equivalent    1 .",
    "@xmath117 are mutually skew , 2 .",
    "@xmath118 , 3 .",
    "@xmath119 , 4 .",
    "the elements @xmath120 obey the braid relation @xmath121 in @xmath1 , 5 .",
    "@xmath122 are mutually skew ,    and are equivalent to the same with @xmath117 interchanged . in this case",
    "@xmath123    ( 2)-(3 ) are elementary from the ip quandle axioms . for ( 4 )",
    "we rearrange as @xmath124 which in view of the relations in @xmath1 becomes @xmath125 and the right hand side is @xmath126 , so this condition is the same as ( 1 ) . on the other hand ( 4 ) can also be rearranged as @xmath127 which in view of the relations in @xmath1 become @xmath128 and the right hand side @xmath129 , so this condition is ( 5 ) .",
    "then if @xmath117 and @xmath122 are both mutually skew we have @xmath130 .    finally , we have been looking at left quandles .",
    "there is a parallel theory of right quandles in which we reflect the diagrams at the braided - lie algebra level so that in our case a right quandle obeys @xmath131 with @xmath132 bijective and @xmath133 for all @xmath134 . for a right quandle",
    "we have @xmath135 and the relations of @xmath56 are @xmath136 . by definition",
    "the quandle is ip if there is an involutive bijection denoted as inversion such that @xmath137 and @xmath138 for all @xmath111 .",
    "a left ip quandle @xmath0 defines a right ip quandle on the same set with @xmath139 such that @xmath140 extends to an isomorphism of the associated groups .    regarding the data for a left quandle as a right one gives a monoid with the opposite product .",
    "the corresponding groups are then isomorphic via group inversion and at the quandle level this reduces to the relationship shown",
    ".    we can similarly convert from right to left in the ip case .",
    "clearly embeddability in one case is likewise equivalent to embeddabilty in the other .",
    "we say that a group @xmath4 is a covering group if it has a conjugation - stable inversion - stable generating subset @xmath5 , regarded as an ip - quandle , such that @xmath6 is an isomorphism .",
    "this means that such a group has a presentation in the form @xmath141 where @xmath142 is data extracted from the group but only this data is remembered in the form of an ip - quandle .",
    "we show in this section that many familiar finite groups are of this form .",
    "every finite crystallographic reflection group ( i.e. weyl group ) is a covering group with respect to @xmath0 the set of reflections .",
    "moreover , the ip - quandle of reflections is locally skew _ iff _ the associated dynkin diagram is simply laced .",
    "we choose a root system of dynkin type appropriate to the weyl group , i.e. a system of roots @xmath143 in @xmath144 for some @xmath145 with its standard inner product@xcite .",
    "we also choose simple roots @xmath146 .",
    "we do not use the full data here and different data can define the same group .",
    "each root defines a hyperplane reflection which we write as @xmath147 for @xmath148 , where @xmath149 is the coroot of @xmath150 .",
    "the quandle @xmath0 can then be identified with the set of roots modulo sign ( or all the positive roots ) and the ip - quandle structure and relations of @xmath1 are represented by @xmath151 we use the notation @xmath152 for the reflection associated to the simple root @xmath153 . using the relations of @xmath1",
    "only , we verify that we can recover all the coxeter relations as follows .",
    "( 1 ) if @xmath154 then @xmath155 and hence @xmath156 . ( 2 ) if @xmath157 then @xmath158 and hence @xmath159 . by symmetry",
    "we have similarly @xmath160 .",
    "hence @xmath161 or @xmath162 . ( 3 ) if @xmath163 and @xmath164 we have @xmath165 while @xmath166 , hence @xmath167 and @xmath168",
    ". then @xmath169 or @xmath170 . ( 4 ) if @xmath171 and @xmath164 we have @xmath172 , @xmath173 and @xmath174 , hence @xmath175 , @xmath176 and @xmath177 .",
    "hence @xmath178 or @xmath179 .",
    "hence @xmath1 recovers the weyl group .    in the simply laced case ,",
    "the graph @xmath180 of mutually skew edges contains the dynkin diagram @xmath181 itself  two adjacent nodes are labeled by reflections obeying the braid relations hence by lemma  [ skewbraid ] are mutually skew .",
    "we show that any reflection is connected by a path to this dynkin diagram .",
    "indeed , any root can be obtained by the action of the weyl group from a simple root and hence is of the form @xmath182 , say .",
    "we apply these simple reflections in turn and show that the accumulated subgraph of @xmath180 remains connected .",
    "thus , applying @xmath183 to @xmath181 gives a translate @xmath184 of @xmath181 as a subgraph of @xmath180 , because the weyl group acts as a group automorphism by conjugation and hence two vertices are connected after the action of @xmath183 iff they were before .",
    "the translate is connected to @xmath181 since at least one node , @xmath185 itself , is invariant so lies in both @xmath181 and its translate .",
    "we write @xmath186 for the combined connected subgraph .",
    "now we apply @xmath187 to @xmath188 to obtain a subgraph @xmath189 as its translate .",
    "this translate remains connected to @xmath181 since @xmath190 is invariant and so also lies in @xmath189 .",
    "we write @xmath191 for the combined connected graph . iterating this process with @xmath192 we arrive at a connected subgraph of @xmath180 which contains the element of the weyl group that we began with as well as @xmath181 .",
    "hence the group is locally skew .",
    "next we claim that if @xmath193 are mutually skew then @xmath194 have the same length .",
    "hence in the non - simply laced case the graph of mutually skew edges must have different components and the quandle is not locally skew .",
    "indeed , @xmath195 and @xmath196 being mutually skew means @xmath197 , i.e. @xmath198 or @xmath199 . if @xmath200 we conclude in the first case that @xmath201 and in the second case that @xmath202 . in the first case , since @xmath203 , we deduce that @xmath204 hence @xmath205 .",
    "hence @xmath150 has the same length as @xmath206 as reflections do not change length .",
    "there is a similar argument in the other case .",
    "let @xmath207 be the conjugacy class of 2-cycles .",
    "clearly @xmath208 for disjoint @xmath209 and @xmath210 .",
    "hence @xmath0 is a skew ip - quandle if @xmath211 and clearly a locally skew one if @xmath212 .",
    "the relations of @xmath1 are @xmath213 for disjoint @xmath209 .",
    "these imply the usual coxeter relations since @xmath214 using only the relations above .",
    "hence the relations stated form a presentation of @xmath9 and hence @xmath215 as per the theorem .",
    "we conclude with some other examples .",
    "the first illustrates that a group can be a covering group with respect to one generating @xmath0 and not with respect to another .",
    "we will always write @xmath216 for the cyclic group @xmath217 .",
    "let @xmath218 be the conjugacy class of 4-cycles as an ip - quandle .",
    "it consists of the following elements @xmath219 and their inverses , @xmath220 and the quandle structure is @xmath221 where @xmath49 is the other one of the triple @xmath209 and @xmath222 is totally antisymmetric with @xmath223 .",
    "hence the ip - quandle here is skew .",
    "the relations of @xmath1 are those expressing inverse and @xmath224 with the conventions above . within @xmath225",
    "we would have @xmath226 and taking these now as definitions we seek to show the relations of @xmath225 .",
    "the first step is to show that @xmath227 , @xmath228 and cyclic rotations of these .",
    "the proof of the first of these is @xmath229 while the second is @xmath230 . from these equations we deduce that @xmath231 or @xmath232 which similarly equals to @xmath233 .",
    "we conclude that @xmath234 . also using the relations",
    ", the element @xmath235 is central so this element @xmath236 , say , generates a central @xmath237 subgroup while the @xmath238 generate a copy of the quaternion group @xmath239 .",

    "it is easy to verify that if we quotient by the above @xmath237 then the relations @xmath243 etc and the rest of the coxeter relations hold .",
    "hence @xmath244 so that @xmath1 is a double cover .",
    "moreover , from @xmath245 and other relations in @xmath1 , it is clear that @xmath246 , one of the two schur covers of @xmath225 .",
    "this example restricts on the inverse image of the klein four group @xmath247 to the quaternion group @xmath239 as its double cover .",

    "hence the ip - quandle here is skew iff @xmath254 .",
    "more generally @xmath262 are mutually skew iff @xmath145 divides @xmath263 .",
    "this means that unless @xmath264 ( so @xmath10 ) we have no distinct mutually - skew pairs , while for @xmath10 we have for example @xmath265 are mutually skew for all @xmath266 and hence @xmath10 is locally skew .",

    "the general notion of differential graded algebras over algebras is one of the components of noncommutative geometry@xcite . in particular , left and right translation covariant or ` bicovariant ' differentials on hopf algebras have been much studied since their formulation in @xcite .",
    "the specialisation to finite groups is also well - known and we refer to @xcite for an introduction . briefly , let @xmath4 be a finite group and @xmath22 be the algebra of functions .",
    "bicovariant noncommutative differential calculi @xmath329 correspond to cayley digraphs where arrows are of the form @xmath330 for @xmath63 , a fixed ad - stable subset of @xmath331 . here",
    "@xmath332 is the space of left - invariant 1-forms and in terms of the kronecker delta - functions the basis 1-forms are given by @xmath333 .",
    "we have @xmath334 where the finite partial derivative is @xmath335 in terms of right translation @xmath336 .",
    "the calculus is inner with @xmath337 in the sense that @xmath338 for all @xmath339 , and is connected iff @xmath340 is a generating set , which we suppose .",
    "it is also natural to suppose @xmath0 is stable under inversion so that the cayley graph is bidirected ( every arrow has an inverse ) and we suppose this , as in earlier sections .",
    "the stated @xmath341 extends in a natural way to a braided hopf algebra @xmath342 as the invariant part of an exterior algebra @xmath343 where @xmath344 and this forms a complex with @xmath345 , the noncommutative de rham complex .",
    "its cohomology is denoted @xmath346 and depends on @xmath0 .",
    "the relations of the exterior algebra in degree 2 are quadratic and take the form @xmath347 where @xmath348 is adjoint to the @xmath47 on @xmath0 as a right - handed rack . here",
    "@xmath341 and @xmath50 are mutually dual .",
    "one has @xmath349 for all @xmath350 and similarly with graded commutator in all degrees .",
    "the higher degrees are similarly determined by @xmath47 in a canonical way@xcite .",
    "let @xmath0 be a right ip - quandle .",
    "we note first that @xmath352 hence if @xmath353 where @xmath354 and @xmath355 in @xmath356 , i.e. using the leibniz rule , @xmath357 which is equivalent to @xmath358 or @xmath359 now consider @xmath360 where we write @xmath253 as obtained along a path from @xmath361 in the cayley graph by repeated multiplication from the right by generators @xmath362 .",
    "we add up the values of @xmath363 at each interim vertex in the direction of the next vertex . that this is independent of the path requires invariance under application of the relations in the group @xmath1 which are either the quadratic ones or express inverses .",
    "this means in diagram form : @xmath364{coverpath.pdf}\\ ] ] at all @xmath365 and @xmath69 .",
    "the first requires @xmath366 which is the cocycle condition we found on @xmath363 , while the second requires @xmath367 .",
    "if these conditions hold then @xmath368 by construction obeys @xmath369 and hence @xmath370 .",
    "conversely , if @xmath371 is exact then these conditions hold .",
    "we see in particular that @xmath3 is closed but not exact . more generally , if @xmath372 is a constant @xmath373 independent of @xmath374 , then clearly @xmath375 obeys the conditions that we required for @xmath363 above , i.e. @xmath376 is exact .",
    "the following lemma then completes the proof .        from ( [ cocy ] ) at we also have @xmath383 and adding this to to ( [ cocy ] ) we have an equation which we use to compute @xmath384 using also the definition of an ip quandle and the relations of the group . hence @xmath385 where we extend the action of @xmath0 to an action of @xmath1 . in view of this",
    "we will focus on @xmath386 for simplicity .",
    "we now return to equation ( [ cocy ] ) with @xmath387 assigned different values and overall signs as follows : @xmath388 where we used definition of an ip - quandle and the relations of the group to simplify .",
    "we now add all these equations together and cancel to obtain @xmath389 for all @xmath390 . if @xmath391 are mutually skew then @xmath392 and if also @xmath393 are mutually skew then @xmath394 by the right handed version of ( [ skewip ] ) . according to lemma  [ skewbraid ] this is not a further requirement .",
    "hence in this case @xmath395 .",
    "this then completes the proof of the theorem : when @xmath0 is locally skew we conclude that @xmath396 is independent of @xmath20 by part ( 2 ) and hence @xmath397 is independent of @xmath256 by part ( 1 ) . from section  3",
    "we see among others that @xmath40 for all @xmath145 where @xmath9 has its 2-cycles differential calculus and @xmath41 with @xmath398 .",
    "if @xmath0 is not locally skew the proof of the theorem and the lemma still tells us that a closed 1-form @xmath377 is exact iff @xmath399 for all @xmath59 , although not all of these conditions may be independent of each other or of the cocycle condition already imposed .",
    "this implies that @xmath400 for any finite ip - quandle and its associated group .      in this case",
    "the cocycle condition ( [ cocy ] ) is solved by constant coefficients @xmath403 independent of @xmath253 .",
    "this is the space of left - invariant 1-forms . on this space",
    "the additional condition to be exact is the @xmath404 equations @xmath405 . assuming that the characteristic is not 2 this means that @xmath38 contains each @xmath406 as representatives .",
    "these are already linearly independent hence the bound is saturated .",
    "thus for @xmath407 we have @xmath408 spanned by @xmath409 associated to the elements @xmath410 of @xmath0 .",
    "these are the left - invariant 1-forms and it is known that they provide the cohomology in this and similarly trivial examples .",
    "we have discussed only @xmath38 above but we remind the reader of the conjecture in @xcite that the volume dimensions ( top degrees ) of @xmath411 with @xmath412 are the same as the number of indecomposable modules of the ` preprojective algebra ' of type @xmath413 ( related to the lusztig canonical basis of @xmath414 ) .",
    "one could also expect at the top degree that @xmath415 by poincar duality and then the conjecture becomes that this top cohomology dimension is the number of indecomposables .",
    "similarly for the weyl groups of other lie algebras in relation to their canonical bases .",
    "the work @xcite showed how a symmetric algebra partner to the left invariant exterior algebra naturally recovers the fomin - kirillov algebra that arises in the classical cohomology of flag varieties in type a , an approach which was extended to general type in @xcite .",
    "the work @xcite also considered flat connections in the exterior algebra and we note @xcite among other subsequent works ."
