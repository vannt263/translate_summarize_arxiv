    "the distribution of stellar masses at birth ( the stellar initial mass function , or imf , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is the fundamental property , together with the efficiency of star formation , that quantifies the conversion of gas into stars in galaxies .",
    "it enters , directly or indirectly , in the determination of many physical quantities of stellar populations and galaxies , such as the conversion of luminosity to mass and star formation rate ( sfr ) . the imf is often parametrized by the broken power law form of @xcite or the log  normal form of @xcite .    although many studies indicate that the stellar imf is consistent with a universal form ( see , for a review , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , a few recent investigations cast doubts on the universality in _",
    "all environments_.    by comparing galaxy  integrated properties of large samples of nearby galaxies at multiple wavelengths , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite find that , on average , the ionizing / non  ionizing flux ratio of galaxies decreases for decreasing galaxy luminosity or mass or sfr or sfr / area .",
    "@xcite exclude , based on statistical arguments , that galaxy  integrated stochastic sampling or variations in the star formation histories alone can fully account for the observed trend",
    ". a systematic variation of the high end of the imf with some galactic or local parameter ( luminosity , sfr , sfr / area , gas density ) has been suggested as one of the possible ways to explain the observations @xcite , although other scenarios are possible ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the model suggested by @xcite invokes the existence of two correlations : one between a galaxy s sfr and its clusters maximum mass ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and another ( deterministic ) between a cluster mass and the most massive _ possible _ star the cluster can form @xcite .",
    "the nature of the second correlation implies that clusters are not subject to the effect of stochastic sampling of the imf @xcite , i.e. 100 clusters each with mass=10@xmath5  m@xmath4 would not be equivalent to one 10@xmath6  m@xmath4 cluster , as the former will systematically lack the high  mass stars contained in the latter .",
    "the standard approach to deriving the functional form of an imf , i.e. counting the individual stars contained in single ",
    "age , young stellar populations ( typically @xmath73  myr  old star clusters ) , is difficult to apply over statistically large samples of clusters at a given mass and in a variety of galactic environments , and provides limited leverage for discriminating stochastic sampling from systematic trends in the imf .",
    "significant blending will occur for massive stars due to crowding in the centers of star clusters @xcite , even with the angular resolution of the hubble space telescope , for distances larger than those of the magellanic clouds ( @xmath155  kpc ) .",
    "these difficulties may account for the contrasting results obtained by @xcite , who concluded that the most massive stars in milky - way clusters are stochastically drawn from a universal imf , and @xcite , who claimed evidence for a systematic trend between the masses of clusters and those of their most massive stars .    here",
    "we present an alternate method that exploits the integral properties of star clusters to place limits on variations of the high  end imf .",
    "each star cluster is treated as single unit , and imf variations are investigated by measuring the dependence of the ionizing photon rate , normalized by the cluster mass , on cluster mass ( section  2 ) .",
    "this method extends the @xcite approach ( the cluster birthline ) by normalizing the ionizing photon rate to the age ",
    "independent cluster mass , instead of the age ",
    "dependent bolometric luminosity .",
    "our method , however , requires that accurate ages for each cluster be determined .",
    "we test our approach using observations of the young star cluster population in the nearby galaxy ngc5194 ( section  3 ) .",
    "a summary of findings and future directions are given in section  4 .",
    "stellar population synthesis models provide specific predictions for the ionizing photon rate , n(h@xmath8 ) , produced by a single  age stellar population as a function of time , for a given imf , mass , and metallicity .",
    "compact star clusters represent a close approximation to the idealized case of a single  age population .",
    "the rate n(h@xmath8 ) decreases with increasing age , as massive stars die out , and ionized gas generally becomes undetectable in clusters older than @xmath1810  myr ( more than 100 times fainter than at 12  myr age ) .",
    "most hii regions form expanding shells around the central cluster @xcite , thus decreasing the surface brightness of the ionized gas emission lines even further . for practical purposes ,",
    "ionized gas emission will not be easily detected from star clusters older than @xmath268  myr .",
    "measuring n(h@xmath8 ) from a star cluster at a given ( young ) age is equivalent to measuring the number of massive stars distributed according to an imf .",
    "this , in models , includes fractional stars in the high end of the imf , for low ",
    "mass clusters .",
    "real clusters , however , do not contain fractions of stars , and , for masses@xmath7a  few@xmath910@xmath6  m@xmath4 , they will be subject to stochastic sampling of the imf , even if the underlying imf is ` universal ' , i.e. , independent of cluster mass @xcite .",
    "stochastic sampling induces a dispersion on the number of stars at a given stellar mass that are present in a real cluster , and the dispersion increases for decreasing cluster mass .",
    "this , in turn , affects a number of observational parameters , including the inferred mass and n(h@xmath8 ) from clusters ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the scatter on the mass determination increases from 6% for a 10@xmath10  m@xmath4 cluster to @xmath150% for a 10@xmath3  m@xmath4 cluster ; the scatter on n(h@xmath8 ) increases from @xmath110% to 80% for the same cluster mass range @xcite . in our approach , the impact of stochastic imf sampling is minimized by combining large numbers of same  mass , young clusters to a cumulative equivalent mass @xmath210@xmath10  m@xmath4 , since a ` universal ' imf would be fully sampled in a cluster of this mass , and stochastic uncertainties are reduced to 10% or less in both m@xmath11 and n(h@xmath8 ) .",
    "figure  [ fig1 ] , left , shows the model expectations for n(h@xmath8 ) ( as traced by the h@xmath12 luminosity , l(h@xmath12 ) ) per unit cluster mass , as a function of cluster mass , for both cases of a ` universal ' imf @xcite with fractional stars and a cluster  mass  dependent imf with the maximum possible stellar mass depending on the cluster mass @xcite .",
    "results similar to those of @xcite would be obtained if the imf became steeper at the high end for decreasing cluster mass .",
    "the l(h@xmath12)/m@xmath11 ratio is averaged over the age ranges 1.55  myr and 28  myr for constant star formation , in order to bracket the uncertainty in cluster ages found in most observational analyses . while our default model has metallicity 1.5  solar ( to match ngc5194 , see below ) , we show examples also at 1/3 and 3.5 solar metallicity .",
    "the metal content of the ionized gas has , in fact , strong influence on the ratio l(h@xmath12)/m@xmath11 ; this parameter will be critical when comparing star cluster populations belonging to different galaxies , while its impact will be less important when comparing clusters at different masses _ within _ the same galaxy , under the reasonable assumption that no systematic trend exists between a cluster mass and its metal content .",
    "stochastic sampling of the stellar imf in low ",
    "mass clusters , combined with photometric uncertainties and reddening , can also affect age determinations from multi  wavelength data .",
    "clusters younger than @xmath110  myr that do not have ionized gas emission can be assigned older ages ; conversely , clusters older than 10  myr can be assigned ages @xmath169  myr @xcite",
    ". thus samples of young , low ",
    "mass clusters are ` polluted ' by either addition of old clusters or loss of young members .",
    "the two may compensate each other to some degree , but this is still unquantified .",
    "furthermore , masses may be underestimated by up to a factor of 2 @xcite .",
    "we discuss both effects below , when applying our approach to actual data .",
    "we test our method on the nearby star  forming galaxy ngc5194 ( d@xmath18.4  mpc , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , for which extensive multi  wavelength , broad and narrow  band , archival imaging from the hubble space telescope exists ( go10452 and go10501 ) .",
    "the galaxy represents an ideal target for this test : it is nearly face  on ( @xmath1320@xmath8 ) , thus minimizing line  of  sight overlaps among clusters , and its cluster population has been extensively studied ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the hst observations of ngc5194 include u ( with wfpc2 ) , bvi and h@xmath12 ( with acs ) for the entire disk , and p@xmath12(@xmath14=1.8756  @xmath15 m , with nicmos ) for the inner @xmath13  kpc radius @xcite .",
    "the galaxy has a mean metal abundance about twice solar , which remains super ",
    "solar across the entire disk up to r@xmath16 @xcite .",
    "we use the sample of clusters identified by @xcite , and refer the reader to that paper for the sample selection and measurements .",
    "descriptions of the selection and age  dating methods for star cluster populations in external galaxies can be found also in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* applied to the antennae galaxies ) and ( * ? ? ?",
    "* applied to ngc5236 ) .",
    "we summarize here some of the steps that are relevant to the present paper . for all clusters , ages and extinctions",
    "are determined from the @xmath17 minimization between the observed u , b , v , i and h@xmath12 ( non  continuum  subtracted ) photometry and predictions from the ( * ? ? ? * update ) stellar population models combined with a milky  way ",
    "type extinction curve @xcite .",
    "the choice of the extinction curve does not impact the results , because most curves are degenerate in the wavelength range from u to i @xcite . changing the population synthesis models , e.g. , to starburst99 @xcite , also has minimal impact on the results in the case of young clusters ( @xmath710  myr ) .",
    "the use of the non  continuum  subtracted h@xmath12 photometric point ( which becomes a r  band point in the absence of ionized gas ) adds leverage for separating young , extincted clusters from old , relatively unextincted ones , even in those cases where the young clusters do not ionize gas @xcite .",
    "the typical uncertainty is a factor @xmath12 in the final age determination , and @xmath160% in the mass .",
    "the mass of each cluster is estimated from its extinction - corrected @xmath18 band luminosity and the age - dependent mass - to - light ratio from the stellar population models , assuming a kroupa / chabrier stellar imf .",
    "changing the upper mass limit of the imf from 120 to 30  m@xmath4 changes the mass estimate by @xmath22.5x , which is within the range of uncertainties we consider .",
    "we consider two mass bins , located at the two extremes of the sampled range in the cluster mass distribution : @xmath11.5@xmath910@xmath3  m@xmath4 and @xmath14@xmath910@xmath6  m@xmath4 .",
    "they span about a factor 30 in mean mass and a factor 300 in individual cluster masses .",
    "we inspect each cluster visually , and remove from the sample any cluster located in a sufficiently crowded region to hamper h@xmath12 line measurements .",
    "our final , visually inspected , sample consists of 86 clusters in the mass range 0.52  10@xmath3  m@xmath4 and 57 in the range 215  10@xmath6  m@xmath4 , all younger than 10  myr . of the 86 clusters in the lowest mass bin , 39 ( 45% )",
    "are undetected in h@xmath12 down to our 3  @xmath19 limit of 7@xmath910@xmath20  erg  s@xmath21 ( calculated in a 5 pixels radius aperture  =  10  pc ) .",
    "as mentioned in section  2 , some young clusters can be assigned ages older than 10  myr , and vice  versa .",
    "we address this issue by adopting two extreme scenarios : case  ( a ) : all clusters whose colors indicate young ages are included in the average of each mass bin ; case  ( b ) : only clusters which have colors of young populations _ and _ also have h@xmath12 detections above 3  @xmath19 are included in the mass bin average . in order to account for the possibility that cluster masses in the low  mass bin may be underestimated by as much as a factor 2 @xcite ,",
    "we include clusters with masses as low as 500  m@xmath4 .",
    "of the 57 clusters in the higher mass range , only 6 ( 11% ) are below 3  @xmath19 in h@xmath12 .",
    "photometric measurements of the hydrogen recombination lines ( continuum  subtracted h@xmath22[nii ] and p@xmath12 ) are performed at the positions of the clusters , with aperture sizes that scale according to the cluster s mass , i.e. , according to the expected strmgren radius of the hii region .",
    "aperture sizes are chosen to be about 0.35  r@xmath23 , because of crowding of the clusters , and age ",
    "dependent aperture corrections are implemented based on the few ` isolated ' hii regions identified in our sample .",
    "the final photometry is visually inspected to check for contamination from neighboring sources ; the local background , determined for each aperture from annuli 2  pixels wide around each region , is subtracted from each photometric measurement , in order to avoid contamination by diffuse emission not associated with the cluster .",
    "the uncertainty in the final h@xmath22[nii ] flux from uncertainties in the aperture correction range from about 20% for the youngest and most luminous regions to about 80% in clusters older than @xmath156  myr .",
    "[ nii ] contamination in the narrow  band filter is removed by using the average galactic [ nii]/h@xmath12 ratio @xcite .",
    "the p@xmath12 image only covers a portion of the ngc5194 disk , and is used here to derive ionized gas extinction corrections region by region for the area of overlap between the acs and nicmos mosaics ( see , also , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , for a total of 29 regions .",
    "the median values of the gas extinction corrections in each cluster mass bin are then adopted for the regions outside of the overlap area .",
    "this may lead to an overestimate of the dust extinction correction of h@xmath12 in each mass bin , as the mean extinction shows a gradient of decreasing values towards the outer regions @xcite ; this will not impact the relative comparison between mass bins , only their absolute values .    in figure  [ fig1 ] ,",
    "right , the ratio l(h@xmath12)/m@xmath11=@xmath24 l(h@xmath12)@xmath25/@xmath24m@xmath11@xmath25 for each of the two cluster mass bins is shown for the two color  age cases ( a ) and ( b ) , as cyan and magenta points , respectively .",
    "the error bars of the high  mass bin are dominated by photometric and aperture  correction uncertainties , while those of the low ",
    "mass bin contain a significant contribution from the stochastic uncertainty in cluster mass determinations .",
    "the absolute values of l(h@xmath12)/m@xmath11 are similar for the two mass bins , within the 1  @xmath19 uncertainty , for both sets of points .",
    "the absence of an obvious differential trend in l(h@xmath12)/m@xmath11 for the two mass bins is consistent with a universal , stochastically ",
    "sampled , imf .",
    "however , we can not completely eliminate the scenario for which the maximum possible mass of a star increases with the cluster mass , as the data are only 12  @xmath19 away from this model s expectations ( triangles ) .",
    "the data follow the 28  myr age average points ( asterisks ) of the 1.5  solar  metallicity stellar population models , implying the following , non  exclusive , possibilities : ( 1 ) our criteria select clusters fairly uniformly distributed in the age range 28  myr ; ( 2 ) the models used in figure  [ fig1 ] , right , have too low metallicity for ngc5194 , and a higher metallicity model should be used ( cf .",
    "figure  [ fig1 ] , left panel ) ; ( 3 ) significant , mass  independent , ionizing photon leakage is present in our regions , which we have not attempted to correct for in our analysis .",
    "we have presented a method to test for variations of the high  end of the stellar imf that exploits the integrated properties of star clusters , rather than resolved star counts .",
    "this approach can overcome statistical limitations in imf determinations and average out effects of stochastic sampling by leveraging the large numbers of star clusters in galaxies .",
    "the ratio of the ionizing photon rate ( as measured by the extinction  corrected h@xmath12 emission ) from young clusters to cluster mass provides a powerful tool to test for such variations .",
    "a basic requirement for this method is to isolate the young ( @xmath2410  myr ) star cluster population , and measure its ionized gas emission .",
    "accurate ( @xmath12x ) ages can be obtained with high  angular  resolution ( e.g. , hst ) multi  color observations ; a minimum set appears to be ubvri @xcite , although the addition of the uv can add an extinction leverage @xcite to further reduce the age uncertainty .",
    "ionized gas emission measurements also need to be corrected for dust extinction , requiring observations of two hydrogen recombination lines .",
    "comparisons between galaxies further requires that the metallicity of each galaxy is known , as the ionizing photon rate is highly dependent on metallicity .",
    "we have tested this method by performing a pilot study on the cluster population in the nearby galaxy ngc5194 .",
    "our analysis shows that , when a sufficiently large number of similar ",
    "mass clusters is summed together to average out effects of stochastic sampling of the imf , the mean h@xmath12 luminosity normalized by the mean cluster mass is relatively independent of the cluster mass , down to m@xmath2610@xmath3  m@xmath4 .",
    "this is consistent with an effectively universal imf independent of the cluster mass .",
    "we do not find strong evidence that the maximum possible mass of a star in a cluster decreases systematically with decreasing cluster mass ( as proposed by * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . however , this is not the most stringent test of the stochastic sampling model because clusters more massive than 10@xmath3  m@xmath4 are expected to contain more than 1 o  type star .",
    "clearly , statistics need to be expanded by including lower cluster masses , and cluster populations from other galaxies , spanning a range of internal and external environments .",
    "the proposed method enables tests of variations of the high  end imf up to at least @xmath110  mpc distance ( ngc5194 is located at 8.4  mpc distance ) , and possibly more , depending on the crowding of the cluster population .",
    "this distance range is at least a factor of 200 larger than what has been achieved so far with direct star counts .",
    "this research has made use of the nasa / ipac extragalactic database ( ned ) which is operated by the jet propulsion laboratory , california institute of technology , under contract with the national aeronautics and space administration .",
