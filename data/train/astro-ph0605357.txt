    "this paper is a continuation of a series of papers ( papers i  vi and viii  x ) of radial - velocity studies of close binary stars @xcite and presents data for the tenth group of ten close binary stars observed at the david dunlap observatory . for technical details and conventions , and for preliminary estimates of uncertainties ,",
    "see the interim summary paper ( * ? ? ?",
    "* paper vii ) .    in this paper , we make use of broadening functions extracted not only from the region of the mg  i triplet at 5184   , as in previous papers , but also from two regions containing telluric features centered at 6290    and 6400   .",
    "these experimental setups were used because of concerns about flexure effects in our spectrograph . while this experiment provided a good check on the stability of our radial - velocity system and  to a large extent",
    " alleviated our concerns , we found that the stellar lines in these two regions were generally too weak to replace the 5184    feature on a routine basis .",
    "the broadening functions ( from now on called bf s ) based on the 6290    and 6400    observations were rather poorly defined , especially for earlier spectral types ; this was mostly due to the low efficiency of our diffraction grating in the red region .",
    "as the result , the bf s for ag  vir and du  boo were poor , with the secondary component almost undetectable .",
    "thus , in the end , we have returned to the 5184  region for the subsequent observations .",
    "the flexure tests based on our telluric - lines template ( regulus = hd87901 ) have shown that the standard wavelength calibrations provide a reasonable stability of our radial - velocity system with the largest deviations within @xmath13 km  s@xmath2 .",
    "the broadening functions obtained in the red region were used in the present study only to augment the data for the quadruple systems , et  boo , vw  lmi and tv  umi , and only for observations at critical orbital phases of long - period systems when any spectrum was of use in defining the orbit .    in august 2005 ,",
    "a new grating with 2160 l / mm was acquired to replace the previously most frequently used grating with 1800 l / mm which after many years of use lost its original efficiency .",
    "thus , unfortunately , due to the changes described above , in combination with the necessarily very extended time coverage for triple and quadruple systems , the present dataset is the least homogeneous since the start of this series of studies .",
    "the bf s used here were extracted from spectra obtained with four different ccd detectors and two different diffraction gratings .",
    "this lack of homogeneity does not seem to affect the final data which have uncertainties similar to previously reported in this series of investigations .",
    "selection of the targets in our program remains quasi - random : at a given time , we observe a few dozen close binary systems with periods usually shorter than one day , brighter than 10  11 magnitude and with declinations @xmath3 ; we publish the results in groups of ten systems as soon as reasonable orbital elements are obtained from measurements evenly distributed in orbital phases . whenever possible , we estimate spectral types of the program stars using our classification spectra obtained with a grating of 600 l / mm over a range of 635   or 890   ( depending on the ccd detector ) centered at 4200  .",
    "our classifications are based on comparison with several spectral standards of the mk system observed on the same nights .",
    "they are compared with the mean @xmath4 color indices usually taken from the tycho-2 catalog @xcite and the photometric estimates of the spectral types using the relations published by @xcite .    the radial velocity ( hereafter rv ) observations reported in this paper have been collected between june 1997 and september 2005 .",
    "the ranges of dates for individual systems can be found in table  [ tab1 ] .",
    "the present group contains 3 quadruple systems , et  boo , vw  lmi and tv  umi , whose complex nature had been noticed several years ago , but whose full orbital solutions required extended monitoring .",
    "this paper is structured in a way similar to that of previous papers , in that most of the data for the observed binaries are in two tables consisting of the rv measurements in table  [ tab1 ] and their preliminary sine - curve solutions in table  [ tab2 ] .",
    "rvs and corresponding spectroscopic orbits for all ten systems are shown in figures  [ fig1 ] to [ fig3 ] . in this paper",
    "we changed the way how rvs are determined from the broadening functions : instead of gaussians , we now use single or double rotational profiles to fit the peaks in the broadening functions .",
    "this approach , which is described in section  [ rot ] , gives much better results with smaller random errors .",
    "we stress that this is still not a full modeling of the broadening function shape ( as attempted in @xcite ) which would be an optimal approach , but a convenient and better working ( than gaussians ) tool .",
    "the measured rvs are listed in table  [ tab1 ] together with weights , determined as @xmath5 , as based on individual determinations of central component velocity .",
    "this weighting scheme , which accounts for differences in relative quality of observations , improves the quality of the orbital solutions .",
    "the data in table  [ tab2 ] are organized in the same manner as in previous papers .",
    "in addition to the parameters of spectroscopic orbits , the table provides information about the relation between the spectroscopically observed epoch of the primary - eclipse t@xmath6 and the recent photometric determinations in the form of the @xmath7 deviations for the number of elapsed periods @xmath8 . for hl  dra the reference ephemeris",
    "is taken from the hipparcos catalogue ; for du  boo from @xcite ; for the rest of the systems , ephemerides given in the on - line version of `` an atlas o - c diagrams of eclipsing binary stars '' @xcite were adopted . because the on - line ephemerides are frequently updated , we give those used for the computation of the @xmath7 residuals below table  [ tab2 ] ( status as in february 2006 ) .",
    "the values of @xmath9 refer to the deeper eclipse which for w - type systems corresponds to the lower conjunction of the more massive component ; in such cases the epoch is a non - integer number . in the cases of et",
    "boo and vw  lmi , where observations covered several years and photometric data have been rather scanty , we optimized not only @xmath9 , but also the orbital period .",
    "table  [ tab2 ] contains our new spectral classifications of the program objects .",
    "independent classification was done for all systems except tx  cnc .",
    "section  [ sec2 ] of the paper contains brief summaries of previous studies for individual systems and comments on the new data .",
    "the novel technique of fitting the rotational profiles to peaks in the bf s is described in section  [ rot ] .",
    "examples of bf s of individual systems extracted from spectra observed close to quadratures are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] .",
    "similarly as in our previous papers dealing with multiple systems , rvs for the eclipsing pair were obtained from bf s with the additional peaks removed .",
    "this task was performed by first fitting multiple gaussian profiles to the combined bf s and then removing the signatures of the third ( and sometimes fourth ) component .",
    "while the final rvs of the close pair were determined by rotational profile fitting to such `` cleaned '' profiles , the velocities of well separated and slowly rotating components of the additional components were determined by the gaussian fits ( table  [ tab3 ] ) . because the bf technique actually produces gaussians for intrinsically sharp signatures with @xmath10 km  s@xmath2 ,",
    "this approach is internally consistent .",
    "photometric variability of du  boo was discovered by the hipparcos satellite @xcite where the star was classified as ellipsoidal variable of the a2 spectral type .",
    "later , @xcite observed the system photometrically and found that it is an eclipsing binary with a large oconnell effect amounting to the difference @xmath11 mag in the @xmath12 passband .",
    "it is interesting to note that light - curve asymmetry and the associated surface inhomogeneities have been very stable since the time of the hipparcos discovery ; this indicates that solar - type dark - spots paradigm does not apply in this case .",
    "recently , @xcite analyzed the @xmath13 photometry and found that du  boo is a relatively long - period ( 1.0559 day ) contact binary showing total eclipses ; the derived photometric mass ratio was found to be @xmath14 .",
    "our spectroscopic mass ratio @xmath15 is consistent with the photometric determination , which documents reliability of photometric mass ratios derived from timing of the inner eclipse contacts for contact binaries showing total eclipses @xcite .    the large oconnell effect is reflected in the extracted broadening functions of du  boo .",
    "while the primary component shows undisturbed broadening functions around quadratures , close in shape to the theoretical rotational profiles ( section  [ rot ] ) , the bf profile for the secondary is always very deformed .",
    "this causes distortions of the observed rv curve and adversely affects the solution for the mass - center velocity .",
    "the peaks of the bf s are not fully separated supporting the photometric solution of du  boo as a contact binary .",
    "the system is clearly of the a - type with the more massive component eclipsed at the deeper minimum .    by combining our spectroscopic results with the inclination angle @xmath16 @xcite",
    ", we obtain the total mass of the system @xmath17 .",
    "our new spectral type estimate of a7v is definitely later than the spectral type given in the hipparcos catalogue ( a2 ) .",
    "the mean tycho-2 color @xmath18 is in better accord with our determination of the spectral type and requires only a small interstellar extinction .",
    "the orbital period of the system ( 1.0559 days ) is rather long for a contact binary of a7v spectral type which indicates that the components of du  boo may be evolved .",
    "the hipparcos parallax is relatively small @xmath19 and not precise enough for determination of the system luminosity .",
    "the photometric variability of the star was discovered by the hipparcos satellite @xcite ; where it is cataloged as a @xmath20  lyrae eclipsing binary of the f8 spectral type .",
    "et  boo is a known member of the visual pair cou  1760 ( ads  14593 + 4649 ) , with the orbital period about 113 years and the magnitude difference of @xmath21 = 0.86 ( see sixth catalog of orbits of visual binary stars , currently available only in the electronic form ) .",
    "the close , eclipsing binary producing the light variations ( from now on : stars 1 and 2 ) is the brighter component of the visual pair",
    ". the observed separation of the visual components was @xmath22 arcsec during the available astrometric observations @xcite which is much less than the typical seeing at the ddo of 1  3 arcsec ; therefore , the spectra of both components were observed simultaneously .",
    "we discovered that the broadening functions ( figures  [ fig4 ] and [ fig5 ] ) show an occasional splitting of the third - component peak , indicating that it is in fact a close , non - eclipsing binary ( from now on : stars 3 and 4 ) with a very strongly elliptical orbit .",
    "thus , the system is a hierarchical quadruple with both components of the visual 113 year period system being double - line ( sb2 ) close binaries .",
    "our estimates of the combined brightness of the third and fourth components are @xmath23 for the spectral region around 5184    and @xmath24 at 6400    during the maximum light of the closer pair .",
    "the rv data for the close binary were handled in the standard way , by first removing the peaks ( by preliminary fitting of gaussian profiles ) of the second binary and then measuring the positions of the rv peaks for the close pair .",
    "the novelty here is that instead of gaussians , as in previous papers , we used the double rotational profiles for the close pair ( section  [ rot ] ) .",
    "the results indicate that the brighter component of et  boo is a semi - detached or more likely a detached binary with a relatively large mass ratio , @xmath25 .",
    "only a small fraction of the available bf s show splitting of the visual companion peaks ( components 3 and 4 ) ; this property gave us a hint of a highly eccentric orbit , but also crucially helped in finding the orbital period .",
    "because these stars have very similar brightness , the period ambiguity was resolved by consideration of the rv differences between the components . a preliminary orbital period found by trigonometric polynomial fitting to the data was later refined by the spectroscopic orbit solution ( table  [ tab4 ] , fig .  [ fig6 ] ) to give 31.521 days .",
    "the systemic velocity of the second binary @xmath26 km  s@xmath2 is close to the systemic velocity of the close pair @xmath27 km  s@xmath2 confirming the physical association of the two binaries .",
    "since the orbital period of the wide pair is 113 years , no orbital motion can be expected to be detected in the 5 years of our observations .",
    "the photometric variability of tx  cnc , an apparent member of the praesepe open cluster , was first announced by @xcite .",
    "@xcite were the first to obtain good simultaneous fit to the photometric and spectroscopic data of the system on the assumption of the roche model .",
    "a preliminary analysis of the ddo observations was published in a phd thesis @xcite .",
    "the rvs used there have been later re - determined using the rotational profile fitting .",
    "surprisingly , the broadening functions show a shape of a practically detached binary ( see fig  [ fig4 ] ) , although the orbital velocities are quite typical for a contact , w - type system .    the spectroscopic elements of tx  cnc determined by @xcite were @xmath28 = 26.6 @xmath1 3 km  s@xmath2 , @xmath29 = 117.3@xmath13 km  s@xmath2 , @xmath30 = 189.8 @xmath1 4 km  s@xmath2 , giving @xmath31 = 0.62 . a later rv solution published by @xcite , @xmath32 km  s@xmath2 ,",
    "@xmath33 km  s@xmath2 and @xmath34 km  s@xmath2 , was based on only 8 photographic spectra .",
    "our spectroscopic elements suggest a smaller mass ratio @xmath35 than derived before and a larger total mass , @xmath36 ; both changes are rather characteristic for an improved quality of the spectroscopic observations .",
    "tx  cnc is of particular interest for our understanding of the evolution of contact binaries because it appears to belong to praesepe , which is one of the youngest ( 900 myr ) open clusters containing such binaries @xcite .",
    "all indications point at an advanced age of contact binaries so that confirmation of the membership of tx  cnc to praesepe may provide a much needed lower limit on the time needed to form such binaries .",
    "unfortunately , the system s parallax was not measured during the hipparcos mission so that the membership must be judged by less direct means .",
    "our radial velocity data giving @xmath37 km  s@xmath2 , are fully consistent with the mean velocity of the praesepe cluster , @xmath38 , and the velocity dispersion of its spectroscopic binaries , @xmath39 km  s@xmath2 @xcite .    in the ppm catalogue , @xcite",
    "assign tx cnc a parallax of @xmath40 mas .",
    "hipparcos astrometry of praesepe analyzed by @xcite gives a cluster parallax of @xmath41 mas , i.e. a distance modulus of @xmath42 . with the maximum brightness of tx  cnc of @xmath43",
    ", we get @xmath44 which is in perfect agreement with the absolute magnitude estimated from the @xcite calibration giving @xmath45 , for assumed @xmath46 = 0.54 corresponding to spectral type f8v .",
    "this excellent agreement in radial velocity , parallax and luminosity distance is supported by proper motion data . the careful photographic study by @xcite showed that tx cnc has a proper motion of @xmath47 mas yr@xmath2 relative to the centre of motion of praesepe , leading @xcite to assign a 99% probability that tx cnc belongs to praesepe . the velocity dispersion contributes less than 1 mas yr@xmath2 .",
    "the tycho-2 work of @xcite yields @xmath48 mas yr@xmath2 for the absolute proper motion of tx cnc , compared with the mean centre of mass motion of @xmath49 mas yr@xmath2 found by @xcite .",
    "we can therefore be very confident that tx cnc is a member of praesepe , and hence it is an important system for testing theories of contact binary formation and evolution .",
    "the bright a - type contact binary v1073  cyg was a subject of several photometric studies @xcite .",
    "there exist also two spectroscopic investigations : @xcite published a spectroscopic orbit for the primary component with a marginal detection of the secondary , with @xmath50 km  s@xmath2 , @xmath51 km  s@xmath2 and the mass ratio of @xmath31 = 0.34 .",
    "the author found a small eccentricity of the orbit , @xmath52 , which can not be significant when one applies arguments of @xcite on statistics of eccentricity determinations .",
    "@xcite obtained an apparently more reliable , circular orbit solution for both components , with the resulting spectroscopic elements , @xmath53 km  s@xmath2 , @xmath54 km  s@xmath2 and @xmath55 km  s@xmath2 . our results , @xmath56 km  s@xmath2 , @xmath57 km  s@xmath2 and @xmath58 km  s@xmath2 , are superior to the previous ones thanks to the bf extraction technique and the rotational profile fitting .",
    "the relatively large formal @xmath59 errors are mainly caused by the simple sine curve solution used by us .",
    "when combined with a high - precision light curve , the bf modeling can provide high - quality absolute parameters of the system .",
    "our spectral type estimate , f0v , is much later than original classification of @xcite who estimated the spectral type as a3vm ; it confirms the classification of @xcite .",
    "the tycho-2 color @xmath60 = 0.375 and our spectral type indicate a non - negligible amount of reddening .",
    "the hipparcos parallax , @xmath61 mas is not sufficiently precise to draw conclusions on the physical properties of the system .",
    "variability of hl  dra was detected during the hipparcos mission .",
    "the system was classified as a @xmath20  lyrae eclipsing binary with the orbital period of 0.944276 days .",
    "the primary component is of the a5 spectral type .",
    "no ground - based photometric study of the system has been published yet .",
    "also no recent minima after the hipparcos mission are available .",
    "our time of the spectroscopic conjunction shows only a small shift ( + 0.0047 days ) with respect to the time predicted by the original hipparcos ephemeris so that the orbital period of the system appears to be very stable .",
    "we have not been able to detect spectral signatures of the secondary component in our data .",
    "the broadening functions close to quadratures show only small humps on both sides of the primary peak which can not be identified with the secondary component because they do not show any orbital motion .",
    "the system is clearly a detached or semi - detached pair with a low luminosity secondary component .",
    "hl  dra was observed during two seasons in two different wavelength regions , in 2004 at 5184     and in 2005 at 6290   .",
    "the latter dataset is of relatively poor quality due to the low number and weakness of spectral lines in the red spectral region of an early type star .",
    "the orbital single - line solutions resulting from the two datasets are in a good accord except for the center of mass velocity of @xmath62 km  s@xmath2 for the 2004 data and @xmath63 km  s@xmath2 for the 2005 data .",
    "the shift is well outside the formal errors and may be caused by a motion of the eclipsing pair around the barycenter with a third body .",
    "the 2004 data are of much better quality so the orbital parameters listed in table  [ tab1 ] correspond to this dataset .",
    "our new spectral type determination is slightly later , a6v , than previously published .",
    "the tycho-2 color index @xmath64 corresponds to the a8v spectral type so that the reddening appears to be small .      ak  her is w uma - type contact binary discovered by metcalf ( see @xcite ) .",
    "it is the brighter component in the visual binary ads  10408 .",
    "the companion , located at a separation of 4.2 arcsec , is 3.5 mag fainter than ak  her at its maximum light .",
    "the position angle 323   is almost perpendicular to our fixed , e  w spectrograph slit so that this component was not detectable in the broadening functions .",
    "the system is known to show a cyclic variation in the moments of eclipses which is probably caused by the light - time effect induced by an undetected companion on an orbit of about 57 years @xcite .",
    "the perturbing star can not be identified with the known visual companion and must be much closer to the binary .",
    "the complex multiplicity of the system is supported by the hipparcos astrometry by the following : ( i )  the system shows a stochastic astrometric solution ( the x flag in the catalog field h59 ) ; ( ii )  it is suspected not to be single ( the s flag in h61 ) , ( iii )  the trigonometric parallax of @xmath65 mas has a much too large error for the brightness of the system . our individual spectroscopic data do not show any contribution from this putative third ( or rather fourth ) component .",
    "it is possible that such a companion will be seen in a detailed analysis of averaged spectra @xcite , but this approach is outside the scope of the present paper .",
    "our rv solution is the first to treat the star as a double - lined binary system ( sb2 ) . @xcite",
    "observed the rv curve of the primary component and determined @xmath66 = 0.0208 m@xmath67 .",
    "his rv solution ( @xmath68 km  s@xmath2 , @xmath69 km  s@xmath2 ) is fairly consistent with our solution .",
    "our spectral classification gives an earlier spectral type for the system , f4v , than previously discussed , f8v .",
    "it is not fully consistent with the tycho-2 color index @xmath70 and implies some interstellar reddening .",
    "the photometric variability of vw  lmi was found by the hipparcos mission .",
    "it was classified in the hipparcos catalogue @xcite as a w  uma type eclipsing binary with an orbital period 0.477547 days .",
    "the first photometric observations of the system were published by @xcite .",
    "later the light curve of the system was analyzed by @xcite , who found the mass ratio @xmath71 = 0.395 and inclination @xmath72 = 72.4 ; we show later that these values are incorrect as they do not take into account the presence of the relatively bright binary companion .",
    "vw  lmi has been observed spectroscopically at ddo since 1998 .",
    "it was realized from the beginning that the system is a quadruple one , consisting of two spectroscopic binaries .",
    "while the eclipsing pair can be identified with the short - period contact binary , the second spectroscopic binary is a detached one with the period of about 7.9 days ( see below how we arrived at the more exact value ) .",
    "the light contribution of the second spectroscopic binary at the maximum brightness of the contact pair is @xmath73 .",
    "the study of quadruple system vw  lmi is complicated by the mutual orbital motion of both binaries so that changes in the respective @xmath28 values can not be neglected .",
    "another complication is the similar brightness of components of the second , non - eclipsing binary making derivation of its orbital period very difficult .",
    "we worked first with rv differences of the components of the second pair to find its orbital period .",
    "trigonometric polynomial fits to the data led to the orbital period @xmath74 = 7.9305 days , which explained all data very well .",
    "an attempt to find the orbit of the contact pair ( after removing the contribution of the second binary ) resulted in poor quality of the spectroscopic orbit .",
    "in fact , the residuals from both preliminary orbits showed a clear anti - correlation between the velocities of the contact pair ( components 1 and 2 ) and of the non - eclipsing binary ( components 3 and 4 ) indicating the mutual orbital motion of the two binaries .",
    "the period analysis revealed only one feasible period of about 355 days , hence close to one year . since the data span 7 years and the observing season for vw",
    "lmi is from late november to mid may , the phase coverage of the mutual orbit is partial and has gaps .",
    "a further improvement of all three orbits was achieved by simultaneous fits to all four datasets of the rvs of the form : @xmath75               + ( -1)^j k_{2j-1,2j } [ e_3 \\cos \\omega_3 + \\cos ( \\omega_3 + \\nu_3)]\\ ] ] where @xmath28 is the mass - center velocity of whole quadruple system , @xmath76 are the respective velocity semi - amplitudes of individual components , @xmath77 is orbital eccentricity , @xmath78 is longitude of the periastron and @xmath79 is the true anomaly .",
    "the index @xmath72 corresponds to the component number ( @xmath80 ) , while the index @xmath81 takes the value of 1 for the contact binary , 2 for the detached binary and 3 for the mutual orbit of the two systems .",
    "thus , for the components of the contact binary , @xmath82 and @xmath83 while for the components of the detached binary , @xmath84 and @xmath85 .",
    "@xmath86 for @xmath81=1 should be read as @xmath87 while for @xmath84 as @xmath88 where @xmath87 and @xmath88 are the semi - amplitudes of the rv changes of the mass centers of the contact and the detached binary , respectively .",
    "all results of the simultaneous fits are presented in table  [ tab5 ] while the orbital elements of the contact pair are also given with the remaining binaries of this study in table  [ tab2 ] . for simplicity ,",
    "all measurements were assigned the same weight although the velocities for the detached pair were determined by the gaussian fits while those of contact pair by the rotational profile fits .",
    "the sine curve fits to the data for the contact binary , corrected for the motion on the outer orbit , are shown in fig .",
    "while the secondary component is usually not blended with the peaks of the second spectroscopic binary , the primary of the contact pair is always visible projected against the `` background '' of the profiles of the 3rd and 4th component .",
    "this circumstance caused an enhanced scatter of the velocities of the primary component .",
    "the corrected rvs of the second binary with the corresponding fits are plotted in fig .",
    "the final orbital period for this binary is 7.93044 days and the orbit is nearly circular .",
    "the velocities of all four components corrected for the corresponding orbital motions in the inner orbits and their best fits are plotted in fig .",
    "these residual rvs represent the orbital motion of the mass centers of both binaries .",
    "because the outer orbit has a relatively short period of 355 days , it is of interest to inquire into the mutual orientation of the three orbits .",
    "this can be estimated from projected masses of the components in a sort of a `` bootstrap '' process started with the derived inclination of the contact , eclipsing system .",
    "a preliminary solution of unpublished photoelectric data obtained at the star lesn observatory of the astronomical institute of the slovak academy of sciences were used to estimate inclination angle of the eclipsing pair . fixing the third light at @xmath73 ( see above ) and using the spectroscopic mass ratio of @xmath89 led to the inclination angle @xmath90 .",
    "this is , as expected , a much larger inclination than the one obtained by @xcite ( @xmath91 ) without an assumption of the third light . using our estimate of the inclination angle and the projected total mass of the contact pair @xmath92",
    ", we obtain @xmath93 .",
    "the outer , 355 day orbit defines the mass ratio for the two pairs , @xmath94 .",
    "therefore , the true ( not the projected ) mass of the second spectroscopic binary is @xmath95 . using the projected mass @xmath96",
    ", we estimate the inclination of the orbit of the second pair to be about @xmath97 .",
    "the outer , 355 day orbit is even less inclined to the sky since with @xmath98 and the projected total mass of only @xmath99 , so that we obtain @xmath100 .",
    "obviously , we could not determine if these values are all in the same sense or are complements to @xmath101 ; a determination of the sense of the revolution could only come from interfermetric observations .",
    "the non - eclipsing , detached binary , with @xmath102 , is composed of two almost identical ( @xmath103 ) , most probably main sequence stars .",
    "their masses correspond to about f9v  g0v and their similarity is also reflected in the luminosity ratio @xmath104 1.04 .",
    "the evolutionary status of components can be guessed from a comparison of their rotational and orbital velocities .",
    "if we assume a synchronous rotation and take rotational velocities of the components estimated from gaussian profile fits to be about 12 km  s@xmath2 and semi - amplitudes of rvs about 60 km  s@xmath2 , we see that fractional radii of components are @xmath105 . with the semi - major axis of the absolute orbit of about 10 r@xmath67 , their radii are @xmath106 .",
    "the similar spectral type of all components of the quadruple system of vw  lmi has resulted in a very good quality of extracted bf s , as can be judged in figure  [ fig4 ] .",
    "it is interesting to note that multiplicity of vw  lmi was not identified astrometrically during the hipparcos mission in spite of the relative proximity of the system at @xmath107 mas .",
    "this is probably caused by the orbital period of the two pairs around each other being close to one year thus mimicking the parallactic motion .",
    "because of the small size of the mutual ( 355 day ) orbit of only 0.62 au , chances of resolving the two astrometric components are rather small even with advanced techniques because the expected maximum angular separation will be only 10 mas . the situation is little bit more optimistic with the expected light - time effect of the eclipse timing of the contact binary as the expected full amplitude is about 0.0074 days which should be relatively easy to detect with the observed photometric amplitude of 0.42 mag .      the w  uma - type binary v566  oph was discovered by @xcite .",
    "the system is bright ( @xmath108 = 7.46 ) and therefore it was a subject of numreous previous photometric ( for references , see @xcite ) and spectroscopic observations .",

    "@xcite published the first light curve analysis of v566  oph based on the roche model .",
    "the total eclipses permitted to determine reliable geometric elements : the fill - out @xmath109 ( @xmath110 = 0.25 ) , mass ratio @xmath111 and inclination of @xmath112 .",
    "there exist three previous spectroscopic studies of the system .",
    "two of these are based on photographic observations @xcite and a more recent one is based on the reticon data @xcite . the latter study used direct fitting of the synthetic profiles to the ccf functions .",
    "the spectroscopic elements obtained in his study , @xmath28 = 38.5@xmath11.1 km  s@xmath2 , @xmath29 = 72.6@xmath11.5 km  s@xmath2 and @xmath30 = 272.9@xmath11.3 km  s@xmath2 , are practically within the errors of our results , @xmath28 = 37.3@xmath10.5 km  s@xmath2 , @xmath29 = 71.1@xmath10.7 km  s@xmath2 and @xmath30 = 270.1@xmath11.1 km  s@xmath2 .",
    "the current improvement of the orbit is mainly due to the use of the bf extraction technique and of the rotational - profile fitting .",
    "the orbit can be still improved by taking the proximity effects into account .",
    "our new determination of the mass ratio , @xmath113 is in a moderately good agreement with photometric mass ratio of @xcite , confirming the utility of the photometric approach to systems with total eclipses .",
    "the orbital period of the system is rather unstable . in spite of the possible light - time effect orbit found by @xcite",
    ", we did not find any traces of the third component in the extracted bfs .",
    "v566  oph is a relatively nearby system with a good hipparcos parallax , @xmath114 mas .",
    "the absolute magnitude determined using the calibration of @xcite , @xmath115 , using @xmath116 from the tycho-2 catalogue @xcite is in good agreement with the visual absolute magnitude determined from the hipparcos parallax , @xmath117 .",
    "our new spectral classification , f4v , indicates a slightly later spectral type than that f2v found by @xcite .",
    "tv  umi is another discovery of the hipparcos mission .",
    "the system was classified as a @xmath20  lyrae eclipsing binary with orbital period of 0.415546 days , although the classification was obviously complicated by the low amplitude of the light variations of only about 0.08 mag .",
    "the eclipses are very wide and of almost the same depth .",
    "for that reason we suspected that the variability is caused by a contact binary of the w  uma - type .",
    "prolonged spectroscopic observations of tv  umi at the ddo showed that the system is a quadruple one and consists of two spectroscopic binaries .",
    "the second close binary in tv  umi is almost as bright as the contact pair , but its components are difficult to analyze because of the strong eccentricity of the orbit and the very short duration of periastron passages when the spectral signatures could be potentially resolved .",
    "in fact , the components of the second pair could not be separated in most of our spectra ; such a separation took place on only three occasions .",
    "the largest observed separation of the components of the second binary on june 8 , 2001 of more than 100 km  s@xmath2 had to be close to periastron passage .",
    "one of the bf s from that night is included in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] . during this event",
    ", the stronger component had a more negative rv .",
    "a period analysis of line separations indicates a 31.2-days orbital periodicity of the second pair .",
    "the reliable determination of the orbital parameters and confirmation of the preliminary orbital period would require more observations , preferably with a larger spectroscopic resolution to separate the components even outside the periastron passages .",
    "the tv  umi system resembles et  boo in that its companion binary also has an eccentric orbit with a similar orbital period .",
    "our rv observations cover a shorter time base and are less numerous than in the case of vw  lmi so that we have not been able to find the mutual orbital motion of the binaries . during intervals",
    "when we observed the narrow blend of the peaks of the third and fourth components , the combined rv was about @xmath118 km  s@xmath2 , slightly less than systemic velocity of the contact binary ( @xmath119 km  s@xmath2 ) .",
    "this indicates a possible slow orbital motion of both pairs .",
    "the light contribution of the second binary is large , @xmath120 .",
    "as observed during the periastron passage on june 8 , 2001 , its components have slightly unequal brightness : @xmath121 and @xmath122 . using the measured rvs of the third and fourth components during the periastron passage , @xmath123 km  s@xmath2 and @xmath124 km  s@xmath2 , and the mean rv of the blend of the two components giving the approximate systemic velocity of the second pair , @xmath118 km  s@xmath2",
    ", we see that the mass ratio of the second binary is close to unity .",
    "the observed photometric amplitude of the contact system , @xmath125 , when corrected for light contribution of the companion binary , remains small at @xmath126 = 0.163 .",
    "it is interesting to note that the system was not detected nor even suspected as a multiple one from the hipparcos astrometric data .",
    "chances to resolve both binaries by direct imaging are higher than in vw  lmi because no rapid orbital motion of the contact binary was observed indicating a longer orbital period and thus a larger separation of both binaries . according to the hipparcos astrometry tv",
    "umi is relatively nearby , with @xmath127 mas .",
    "clearly , the current data for the second close binary system in tv  umi are inadequate for determination of full orbital parameters for the whole system .",
    "such a determination would require a long - term monitoring program with one or two spectra obtained per night over a period of few months .",
    "variability of ag  vir was discovered by @xcite . since then it was a subject to several photometric investigations ( for references , see @xcite ) .",
    "the system is very similar to du  boo ( section  [ duboo ] ) in that the first light maximum is always brighter of the two by about 0.08 mag .",
    "a simultaneous photometric and spectroscopic analysis of @xcite showed that a reliable determination of the geometrical elements was complicated by the strong asymmetry of the light curve .",
    "the system is of the a - type with an undeterminable degree of contact ( could be marginal or deep ) .",
    "the spectral type is a7v ( our new determination suggests a5v ) , so that the observed photospheric brightness inhomogeneities may be quite different from the solar - type dark spots .",
    "the period analysis of @xcite indicated the presence of a light - time effect in the eclipse timing caused by a third component on a 40 years orbit .",
    "however , later observations did not confirm any cyclic behavior , although the observed times of minima do show a large scatter .",
    "this can be interpreted either by the light - curve variations caused by the presence of surface spots or by a light - time effect caused by a body on a short - period orbit .",
    "in fact , our broadening functions do show a well defined signature of the third component with @xmath128 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig9 ] ) . however , this star has a rather different rv ( @xmath129 km  s@xmath2 ) from the systemic velocity of the contact binary ( @xmath130 km  s@xmath2 ) .",
    "unfortunately , the uncertainties of the rvs are quite large and only our better - quality 2005 spectra ( as used in this paper ) show the presence of this component .",
    "a close inspection of the published cross - correlation functions of @xcite reveals a marginally defined presence of a third component close to the systemic velocity of the binary , but  as expected  the definition of the ccf s was inferior to that of the bf s .",
    "the hipparcos parallax ( @xmath131 mas ) is too small and inconsistent with the estimated absolute magnitude for a a5v star , @xmath132 , and the observed maximum visual magnitude , @xmath133 .",
    "it is possible that this inconsistency is caused by a transverse motion of the eclipsing pair around the third component .",
    "while the previous papers of this series ( papers i  vi and viii  x ) reported rv measurements obtained by gaussian fits to the extracted broadening functions , in this paper we use a novel technique of extracting rvs by rotational profile fits . while neither gaussians nor rotational profiles can replace the full modeling of broadening functions which will hopefully take place one day , the rotational profiles are equally simple to implement as the gaussians , but offer an improvement in the quality of the rv measurements with a much better convergence to the final result and noticeably smaller random errors .",
    "the broadening function of a rigidly rotating star @xcite is described by four parameters : the overall strength or the amplitude of the bf , @xmath134 , the central velocity , @xmath135 ( identified with the light centroid velocity of the star ) , and the half - width @xmath136 ; an additional parameter is a vertical background displacement , @xmath137 , which can be usually traced to a different continuum and pseudo - continuum levels for the standard and program stars during the spectral normalization step . for a double - peaked profile ,",
    "the three first parameters ( @xmath134 to @xmath138 ) appear twice so that the fit involves 7 unknowns . by using auxiliary quantities , @xmath139 and @xmath140",
    ", the profile can be written as :    @xmath141 /(c_1+c_2).\\ ] ]    the profile depends only slightly on the limb darkening coefficient , @xmath142 .",
    "we assumed @xmath143 in our measurements . as opposed to the gaussian profile , the rotational profile ( see an example in fig .",
    "[ fig10 ] ) has rather steep sides and  by definition  is exactly zero for velocities larger than projected equatorial velocity @xmath144 .",
    "these properties are crucial to the improvement in the determination of the parameter @xmath135 , the light centroid for each component .",
    "although the rotational profiles represent the bf profiles of double - line binaries much better than gaussians , a practical application may encounter the same complications :    * if the secondary shows a very faint peak in the bf , its width must be usually fixed at a reasonable value to improve the stability of the solution and to give consistent results ; * the bf profiles for contact binaries are rather different from those of single , rigidly rotating stars , particularly in the `` neck '' region between the stars where an additional light is present .",
    "obviously , these asymmetric deviations can not be fitted by rotational profiles nor by gaussians .",
    "normally , this leads to under - estimates of the velocity semi - amplitudes .    in the case of close binary stars ,",
    "the combined rotational profiles can be applied to broadening functions strictly only outside the eclipses as a proper representation of the data should involve inclusion of the eclipse and proximity effects @xcite . however , a simple upper envelope of the two individual profiles works well even during partial eclipse phases .",
    "we found that the double rotational profiles converge faster to the final results and describe the data much better than the gaussians .",
    "this is well illustrated in the case of tx  cnc , where a preliminary orbit defined by rvs obtained through a gaussian fits had almost twice as large standard errors of the spectroscopic elements .",
    "while @xmath59 errors for the velocities derived from the gaussian fits were @xmath145 = 8.4 km  s@xmath2 and @xmath146 = 8.3 km  s@xmath2 , the errors for the rv s derived by rotational profile fitting are @xmath145 = 4.1 km  s@xmath2 and @xmath146 = 5.7 km  s@xmath2 .",
    "with the new ten short - period binaries , this paper brings the number of the systems studied at the david dunlap observatory to a round number of one hundred .",
    "the systems presented in this paper include three quadruple systems for which we have been collecting data for several years in a hope of being able to study variability of rvs on times scales ranging from a fraction of the day to several years .",
    "this has been achieved for et  boo and vw  lmi where we can say much about all components of these hierarchical binaries .",
    "et  boo is a known visual binary with the period of 113 years with each component being a close binary .",
    "vw  lmi is a particularly interesting system with the period of mutual revolution of both binaries of only 355 days . starting with a preliminary photometric solution of the light curve of vw  lmi which gave the orbital inclination of the close binary , we were able to determine the orbital inclinations of all involved binaries in this system and thus to derive masses of all components .",
    "we have been less successful for the quadruple system tv  umi where the second pair requires a very prolonged monitoring for analysis of the 31.2 day orbit of the second pair .",
    "we have found that ag  vir appears to be a triple system , although there is inconsistency in the velocity of its companion .",
    "for ak  her , we were able to obtain data free of contamination from the known third component ; there are indications that this binary has another faint companion causing the light - time effect in eclipse timing .",
    "the systems du  boo , tx  cnc , v1073  cyg , v566  oph are relatively mundane double - lined contact binaries while hl  dra is a single - lined binary of an unknown variability type .",
    "all rvs for close binaries analyzed in this paper have been determined by using a novel technique of rotational profile fitting to the broadening functions .",
    "this technique , while still not perfect in reproducing asymmetries and intricacies of the real bf s , is much advantageous and accurate than the gaussian fitting previously used in our studies .",
