    "for over two decades , qso absorption spectroscopy has provided a sensitive probe of low - density intergalactic gas , circumgalactic medium ( cgm ) , and interstellar medium ( ism ) which are otherwise too diffuse to be detected in emission beyond the local universe ( e.g. , verheijen et al .",
    "traditionally , the physical properties of the extended gas around galaxies , such as spatial extent , mean covering fraction , and total mass content , are characterized using a statistical approach over an ensemble of projected galaxy  background qso pairs .",
    "this approach has yielded statistically significant constraints for the chemically - enriched cgm around both star - forming and quiescent galaxies based on searches of strong absorption transitions , including the mgii@xmath13 absorption doublet ( e.g. , bowen et al .",
    "1995 ; chen et al .  2010 ; lovegrove & simcoe 2011 ; kacprzak et al .",
    "2011 ) and the hydrogen lyman series ( e.g. , lanzetta et al .  1995 ; chen et al .  1998 ; tripp et al .  1998 ; rudie et al .",
    "2013 ; tumlinson et al .  2013 ; liang & chen 2014 ; johnson et al .",
    "in contrast , absorption - line observations of diffuse gas in interstellar space have been limited because the ism of distant galaxies has a much smaller cross section and closely projected qso and galaxy pairs are rare .    despite significant progress in characterizing the cgm , the origin of cool",
    ", metal - enriched gas around galaxies remains ambiguous .",
    "possible mechanisms to produce cool gas in a hot halo include outflows from super - galactic winds ( e.g. , murray et al .",
    "2011 ; booth et al .",
    "2013 ) , stripped satellites due to tidal interactions or ram pressure ( e.g. , wang 1993 ; agertz et al .  2009 ; gauthier 2013 ) , gas accreted from the intergalactic medium ( igm , e.g. , rauch et al .  1997 ; nelson et al .",
    "2013 ) , as well as in - situ cloud formation from thermal instabilities ( e.g. , mo & miralda - escude 1996 ; maller & bullock 2004 ; sharma et al .  2012 ) .",
    "a number of cgm observations targeting star - forming galaxies have suggested that one or a combination of the above scenarios are at play , such as outflows ( bordoloi et al .",
    "2011 ) or a combination of outflowing and infalling gas ( e.g. , bouch et al .  2012 ; kacprzak et al .",
    "these findings have been based on a simple assumption that outflows occur along the rotation ( minor ) axis , while accretion proceeds along the disk plane ( major axis ) .",
    "however , complications arise when considering the required energetics to drive the observed velocity field of the gas ( e.g. , gauthier & chen 2012 ) and possible spin - filament alignment with the cosmic web ( e.g. , tempel et al .",
    "2013 ) which , in the absence of galactic - scale outflows , would also give rise to an elevated incidence of absorbers along the minor axis of disk galaxies .",
    "to better discriminate between different scenarios for the origin of metal - line absorbers , both spatially resolved gas kinematics and knowledge of galaxy star formation history are necessary . as shown in multi - wavelength imaging observations of local starburst galaxies ( e.g. , suchkov et al .",
    "1996 ; cecil et al .  2001 ) , stronger constraints for gas flows in galactic halos can be obtained from the observed spatial variations in the velocity field and physical conditions of the gas . in a pilot project , chen et al .",
    "( 2014 ) also demonstrated that multi - sightline observations of the cgm using a quadruply - lensed qso , coupled with high resolution imaging of the associated galaxies , enable direct measurements of the velocity gradient and coherence length of the absorbing gas . in turn , these measurements provide critical constraints for distinguishing between different gas flow models .",
    "an added advantage of studying lensed qso fields is the opportunity of probing distant ism by targeting the lensing galaxies . in this paper , we apply three multiply - lensed qsos , he0047@xmath71756 , he0435@xmath71223 , and he1104@xmath71805 , to study the inner halo gas content of their lensing galaxies at @xmath0 . by targeting the lensing galaxies , our study focuses on the cool gas around massive , early - type galaxies ( e.g. , keeton et al .",
    "these galaxies exhibit optical colors and spectral features that are characteristic of nearby elliptical galaxies .",
    "although these evolved galaxies exhibit little / no on - going star formation , they are not all devoid of cold gas .",
    "systematic hi and co searches have uncovered a non - negligible amount of neutral gas in roughly 40% of nearby ellipticals ( e.g. , oosterloo et al .",
    "2010 ; young et al .",
    "2014 ) , suggesting that some feedback processes are in effect to prevent continuing star formation in these gas - rich quiescent galaxies ( e.g. , mcnamara & nulsen 2007 ; conroy et al .",
    "in addition , morphologies of the detected neutral gas span a broad range , from regular disk- or ring - like structures to irregular distributions of clumps and/or streams ( e.g. , oosterloo et al .  2007 ; serra et al .",
    "2012 ) with roughly 1/4 displaying centralized disk or ring - like structures ( serra et al .  2012 ) .",
    "these different morphologies indicate possibly different origins of the gas in different galaxies , including left - over materials from previous mergers and newly accreted gas from the cgm / igm .",
    "these gas - rich , quiescent galaxies therefore provide an important laboratory for studying the physical processes that regulate / terminate star formation in the presence of cold gas in massive galaxies .",
    "incidentally , qso absorption - line spectroscopy carried out in the vicinities of red galaxies at intermediate redshift , @xmath14 , continues to uncover extended cool halo gas to projected distances beyond @xmath15 kpc ( e.g. , gauthier et al .",
    "2009 , 2010 ; bowen & chelouche 2011 ; thom et al .",
    "2012 ; huang et al .",
    "2016 ) , demonstrating that there may indeed be sufficient supplies of cool gas in these massive quiescent halos .",
    "absorption spectroscopy along multiple sightlines in the vicinities of lensing galaxies is particularly interesting , because the small projected distances of these lensed qso sightlines from the lensing galaxies at @xmath3 kpc ( or @xmath16 ) provide an unprecedented opportunity to probe and spatially resolve the cool gas content both in the interstellar space and in the halos of quiescent galaxies .",
    "the fields are chosen because of the available high - quality optical and near - infrared imaging data in the _ hubble space telescope _ ( _ hst _ ) archive , which enable a detailed morphological study of galaxies near the qso sightlines .",
    "in addition , we have targeted relatively wide - separation gravitational lens systems with angular separations @xmath17 and relatively bright lensed qso images with @xmath18-band magnitude of @xmath19 .",
    "these selection criteria are chosen to facilitate high - resolution echelle spectroscopy of the lensed qsos on the ground .",
    "the wide separation ensures that the lensed qso images are not blended under typical sub - arcsecond seeing conditions on the ground , allowing these lensed qso images to serve as independent probes of the foreground cgm at multiple locations .",
    "the brightness limit ensures a relatively high observing efficiency of qso echelle spectroscopy under limited observing resources .    as described in   3 below , all three lensing galaxies presented here are old and massive with stellar masses in the range of @xmath2 .",
    "the available qso echelle spectra cover a spectral range from @xmath20   to beyond 6000  , which allow us to search for absorption features due to feii , mgii , mgi , and caii transitions at the redshift of each lensing galaxy .",
    "these transitions are commonly seen in the diffuse interstellar and circumgalactic gas of temperature @xmath21 k in the milky way and in distant galaxies ( e.g. , savage & sembach 1996 ; rao et al .",
    "the presence of such cool gas , together with the expected presence of a hot x - ray emitting halo around massive elliptical galaxies ( e.g. , osullivan et al .",
    "2001 ) , would indicate a multiphase nature of extended gas around these lensing galaxies .",
    "the observed velocity gradient across the lensing galaxy , together with the relative abundance pattern between different ions , also offers a unique opportunity to directly test the origin of the observed cool gas in these massive , quiescent halos .",
    "this paper is structured as follows . in section 2 ,",
    "we describe relevant imaging and spectroscopic observations and data reduction . in section 3",
    ", we describe the empirical properties that can be extracted from available imaging and spectroscopic data .",

    "figure 1 shows the lensing configurations of these fields .",
    "the relatively wide separation ( @xmath26 ) enables the application of these lensed qso images as independent probes of the inner gaseous halo around each of the lensing galaxies based on qso absorption spectra obtained on the ground .",
    "here we describe relevant imaging and spectroscopic data of the lensing galaxies , as well as echelle spectroscopy of the lensed qsos .",
    "exquisite optical and near - infrared images of the lensed qso fields were retrieved from the _ hubble space telescope _ ( hst ) data archive .",
    "details of the imaging observations are summarized in table 1 .",
    "all imaging data were processed using the standard hst reduction pipeline , and individual dithered exposures were drizzle - combined using the astrodrizzle package in each bandpass . given slight differences in wcs solutions between different bandpasses , the co - added images were then registered to a common origin using point sources in each field . in figure 1 we show false color composite images of the three lens systems , where it can be seen that at the redshift of each lens , absorption spectroscopy of the lensed qsos allows us to probe the gaseous halo on projected distance scales of @xmath27 kpc from the center of each lensing galaxy .",

    "for example , if the gas is pre - enriched by early - generation star formation ( which is expected for newly accreted igm as well as ism in and or stripped from blue satellites ) , then it is also expected to be @xmath174-element enriched ( e.g. , rauch et al .",
    "1997 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "if the gas has significant contribution from sne ia ejecta ( which is expected for ism in or stripped from red satellites ) , then it is expected to show fe enhancement .    for the cool , fe - rich gas ,",
    "the observed super solar ( fe / mg ) ratio indicates a significant contribution to the chemical enrichment from sne  ia . for reference , the expected sne ia contribution relative to total ( type ia and core - collapse sne combined ) in the solar abundance pattern is @xmath212% ( e.g. , tsujimoto et al .",
    "1995 ; de plaa et al .",
    "2007 ) . here",
    "we estimate @xmath213 for the observed fe - rich gas around massive lensing galaxies based on the observed @xmath155 , which shows a median of @xmath214 (   5.2 ) . from equation ( 4 ) , these values represent conservative lower bounds for @xmath215 . adopting the expected yields for type ia and core - collapse sne from iwamoto et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , we estimate a minimum fractional contribution of sne ia to the chemical enrichment of @xmath216% .",
    "the estimated sne  ia contribution around massive , lensing galaxies is comparable to what is found for intracluster medium ( e.g. , de plaa et al .",
    "furthermore , sne  ia occur in low - mass , evolved stars ( e.g. , maoz et al .",
    "2014 ) with long lifetimes , which also implies that the gas has been enriched to relatively high metallicities by previous generations of massive stars .",
    "indeed , observations of stellar atmospheres find an increasing fe abundance with increasing metallicity ( e.g. , mcwilliam 1997 ) .",
    "we therefore expect the fe - rich halo gas to also have a high metallicity .",
    "this expectation is at least consistent with what is found for the few fe - rich , weak mgii absorbers by rigby et al.(2002 ) .    based on the uniform super solar ( fe / mg ) ratios with a small dispersion and the expected high metallicity",
    ", we argue that the fe - rich absorbing components ( which dominate the total absorption width ) originate in sne  ia enriched inner regions at radius @xmath217 from the lensing galaxies . the large velocity spread ( @xmath218 )",
    "can be attributed to recent sne  ia ejecta ( figure 12 ) .",
    "in addition to chemically enriching their environment , sne  ia ejecta can interact with the surrounding gas and deposit thermal energy that increases the velocity dispersion of the gas .",
    "we consider stellar winds from low - mass stars an unlikely source for the observed fe - rich gas , because observations of nearby elliptical galaxies have uncovered a predominantly @xmath174-enhanced abundance pattern in these stars ( e.g. , kuntschner et al .",
    "2010 ) .",
    "a sne  ia origin is qualitatively consistent with previous finding that the radial distribution of type ia sne in early - type galaxies is consistent with the srsic profile describing the stellar light of the galaxies ( frster & schawinski 2008 ) .",
    "recall also that the lensed qso sightlines that have revealed this cool , fe - rich gas pass through the interstellar space of the lensing galaxies at merely @xmath219 .",
    "alternatively , the observed kinematic and chemical signatures may be explained by fe - rich gas expelled from red satellites .",
    "large - scale surveys of nearby galaxies have shown that massive , red galaxies have a significantly higher fraction of red satellites ( e.g. , prescott et al .  2011 ) .",
    "star formation in these red satellites is shut off as a result of gas removal upon entering the host halo ( e.g. , larson et al .",
    "1980 ; kawata & mulchaey 2008 ) .",
    "as the remaining stars continue to evolve in the satellites , we also expect increased contribution from sne  ia to the chemical enrichment in the surrounding gas , resulting in increasingly fe - rich abundance patterns .",
    "the absence of absorption features along sightline @xmath57 at @xmath137 from the lens for he1104@xmath71805 and in all four sightlines at @xmath220 from the lens for he0435@xmath71223 is qualitatively consistent with the partial gas covering fraction expected from either stripped satellites or clumpy sne ia ejecta .",
    "however , additional factors from the galactic environments may have also played an important role in depleting the cool gas near the quad - lens of he0435@xmath71223 .",
    "this lensing galaxy is the only one of the three lenses in our study known to reside in a group environment ( e.g. , morgan et al .",
    "2005 ; wilson et al .",
    ", in preparation ) and the only one that appears to be devoid of cool gas at small projected distances to the lens .",
    "a similar example is found by johnson et al .",
    "( 2014 ) , who reported a transparent sightline at @xmath221 kpc from a pair of interacting galaxies .",
    "interactions between group members may have heated or tidally stripped cool gas from the inner halo of the lens galaxy .",
    "follow - up studies of the galaxy environments of the other two fields will cast important insights into possible environmental role in the cgm properties of these lenses .",
    "it has been shown that chemically - enriched , cool gas is not uncommon in massive , quiescent halos ( see e.g. , gauthier et al .",
    "2009 , 2010 ; bowen & chelouche 2011 ; zhu et al .",
    "the mean gas covering fraction is found to be @xmath222% at @xmath223 kpc ( gauthier & chen 2011 ; huang et al .",
    "however , the physical nature of such gas remains unknown .",
    "based on the suppressed velocity dispersion between mgii gas and galaxies , and the observed preferential geometric alignment of mgii absorbers with filaments , huang et al .",
    "( 2016 ) have recently argued that the observed mgii absorbers are best - explained by a combination of cool clouds formed in thermally unstable hot halos and satellite accretion through filaments .",
    "we expect that mgii gas produced in these processes should exhibit an abundance pattern that reflects an @xmath174-element enhancement .",
    "interestingly , the strongest component ( component 2 ) at @xmath224  in sightline @xmath57 and a moderately strong component ( component 10 ) at @xmath225  in sightline @xmath54 of the he0047@xmath71756 lens are consistent with an @xmath174-element enhancement , although we can not rule out fe - rich gas as the origin of component 2 in sightline @xmath57 .",
    "we note that component 2 toward he0047@xmath71756 @xmath57 contains a significant amount of neutral gas with @xmath226 .",
    "the inferred large hi column density resembles the high velocity clouds ( hvcs ) found in the milky way halo or dlas and sub - dlas found along random qso sightlines .",
    "both hvcs and dlas exhibit @xmath174-element enhancement driven by core collapse sne ( e.g. , richter 2006 ; wolfe et al .",
    "2005 ) , and both are primarily found in / near star - forming galaxies .",
    "this is , however , inconsistent with the old stellar population found for the lensing galaxy with no trace of a cool interstellar medium .",
    "incidentally , a blue galaxy is seen at @xmath227 southwest of the lens . at @xmath117 ,",
    "this galaxy would be at @xmath228 kpc from sightline @xmath57 and nearly twice the distance from sightline @xmath54 which shows weaker mg - rich components .",
    "it is possible that this gas , if mg - rich , originates in an infalling gas cloud or stripped gas from a blue satellite as it orbits around the lensing galaxy ( see the cartoon illustration in figure 12 ) .",
    "while it is also possible that this possibly mg - rich gas arises in the ism or halo gas of a faint satellite that is missed in the glare of the qso light , we consider this an unlikely scenario .",
    "both gauthier et al .  ( 2010 ) and huang et al .",
    "( 2016 ) have estimated possible contributions from the cgm of satellite galaxies to the observed mgii absorption around massive luminous red galaxies ( lrgs ) , assuming that the satellites can retain their gas content while moving in the hot halos of lrgs .",
    "these authors found that the expected contribution from the cgm of satellites is @xmath229% at @xmath230 kpc . considering only ism , however , which is roughly 10 times smaller in size than the cgm",
    ", we expect a contribution of @xmath231% at @xmath232 kpc . because the cross section of blue satellites is negligible ,",
    "the observed mg - rich gas is unlikely to originate in an unresolved blue satellite .",
    "follow - up spectroscopy to measure the redshift and star - forming properties of the blue object will provide necessary data for further studies .    in summary ,",
    "if the observed ism gas of massive galaxies is locally enriched by sne  ia and and the halo is more dominated by pre - enriched gas from early - generation of young stars , then a radial dependence in [ fe / mg ] should be observed , with sightlines at small projected distances showing a higher fraction of high [ fe / mg ] absorbers .",
    "we plan to test this hypothesis using a larger sample of luminous red galaxy and qso pairs .",
    "we have carried out multi - sightline absorption spectroscopy of cool gas around three lensing galaxies at @xmath0 , he0047@xmath71756 , he0435@xmath71223 , and he1104@xmath71805 .",
    "the fields are selected from wide - separation gravitational lens systems with angular separations @xmath17 , which ensure that each lensed qso serves as an independent probe of the foreground lensing galaxy .",
    "all three lensing galaxies are massive with estimated total stellar masses of @xmath2 .",
    "they exhibit spectral and photometric properties that are characteristic of nearby elliptical galaxies with half - light radii of @xmath1 kpc .    for each lensing galaxy ,",
    "the lensed qso sightlines occur at projected distances of @xmath233 , providing for the first time an opportunity to probe spatial variations of the cool gas content both in the interstellar space at @xmath5 and in the halos at larger radii @xmath6 of quiescent galaxies .",
    "the main results from our absorption - line analysis of halo gas properties at the redshift of the lensing galaxies are summarized below .",
    "\\(1 ) we observe a diverse range of absorbing gas properties among the three lensing galaxies .",
    "specifically , both sightlines at @xmath137 and @xmath139 on the opposite sides of the lens for he0047@xmath71756 exhibit an ultra - strong mgii absorber at the redshift of the lens .",
    "the lensing galaxy of he1104@xmath71805 exhibits a moderately strong mgii absorber along sightline @xmath54 at @xmath234 , but no trace of absorption within a sensitive upper limit along sightline @xmath57 at @xmath137 .",
    "the strong absorbers found near the two lensing galaxies are resolved into @xmath8 narrow components with line - of - sight velocity spread of @xmath9 .",
    "in contrast , none of the four sightlines at @xmath235 from the quadruple lens for he0435@xmath71223 exhibits detectable mgii absorption , and this is the only one of the three lenses in our study known to reside in a group environment .",
    "\\(2 ) the strong mgii absorbers with associated feii , mgi , and caii absorption at @xmath16 reveal chemically - enriched cool gas ( @xmath236 k ) around massive , evolved galaxies at intermediate redshifts .",
    "the observed large column densities for mg@xmath154 , fe@xmath154 , and ca@xmath154 suggest a significant neutral gas fraction , similar to lyman limit clouds .",
    "the two strongest components may even be dlas .",
    "\\(3 ) the majority of the absorbing components exhibit a super solar fe / mg ratio with only three components displaying a likely mg - rich ( @xmath174-element enhancement ) abundance pattern .",
    "all three possible mg - rich components occur at the redshift of the lens for he0047@xmath71756 .",
    "the fe - rich components , along both sightlines of the lens for he0047@xmath71756 and one sightline of the lens for he1104@xmath71805 , show a uniform super solar @xmath156 ratio with a dispersion of @xmath11 dex , across the full velocity range of the absorbers ( @xmath9 ) .",
    "\\(4 ) the absorbers uncovered on the opposite sides of the lens for he0047@xmath71756 appear to share a common edge - leading absorption signature , suggesting a spatial coherence on scales of @xmath237 kpc .",
    "however , the spatial coherence is diminished when excluding possible mg - rich gas .",
    "the kinematic signatures of the remaining components share little resemblance between the two sightlines .    given the predominantly old stellar populations in the lensing galaxies and the observed small scatter in fe / mg , we argue that the fe - rich gas ( which dominates the total absorption width ) originates in the inner regions ( at radius @xmath238 ) of the lensing galaxies , with the observed large velocity spread driven by recent sne  ia ejecta .",
    "stellar winds from low - mass stars are an unlikely source for the observed fe - rich gas , because observations of nearby elliptical galaxies have uncovered a predominantly @xmath174-enhanced abundance pattern in these stars .",
    "we consider the possibility that the few possible mg - rich components arise in either stripped gas or pre - enriched halo gas at larger distances @xmath239 , where the chemical enrichment is likely driven by young stars .",

    "our study of three lensing galaxies uncovers a broad range of absorbing gas properties around massive , evolved galaxies .",
    "a larger sample of lensing galaxies is clearly necessary to determine whether the super solar fe / mg abundance pattern is representative of cool gas at small projected distances from evolved galaxies . at the same time , single qso probes of foreground luminous red galaxies over a wide range of projected distances should yield important constraints for the radial dependence of [ fe / mg ] , which will provide further insights into the chemical enrichment history in massive halos .",
