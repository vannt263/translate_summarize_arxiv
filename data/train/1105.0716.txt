    "@xcite suggested those low @xmath1 low @xmath0 blazars may be misaligned or have smaller black holes .",
    "if those sources have relative larger viewing angles , they become lower luminosity and lower peak frequency . as we know , the compton and synchrotron peak frequencies are dependent on the beaming effect with the same way . therefore , the ratio between compton to synchrotron peak frequencies @xmath4 should be independent on viewing angle . and",
    "so does the compton dominance @xmath5 .",
    "luminosity is proportional to @xmath40 and frequency is proportional to @xmath41 , where @xmath42 is the beaming factor , @xmath43 is the lorentz factor , @xmath44 is the velocity in unit of lightspeed and @xmath45 is the viewing angle .",

    "as suggested by @xcite , those low @xmath1 low @xmath0 blazars may have smaller black holes @xcite , and the jet will dissipate energy within the blr . this will cause efficient cooling of the electron , and yields low frequency low power ( see * ? ? ?",

    "the best fitting of figure [ nu_lum ] shows @xmath2 .",

    "it can be seen that these four sources do have low @xmath1 and low @xmath0 values .",

    "from discussion in above section , we know that both the ratio @xmath10 and the compton dominance @xmath11 correlate with the parameter @xmath3 .",

    "the statistical correlation shown in figure [ ec3 ] between @xmath11 and @xmath10 may suggest that most blazars are ec dominant .",

    "<S> in this paper , we use the quasi - simultaneous spectra of _ fermi _ bright blazars and _ fermi _ detected narrow line seyfert 1 ( nls1 ) to study the blazar sequence and inverse compton ( ic ) models . * </S>",

    "<S> in addition to the correlation , there are some blazars showing low @xmath1 and low @xmath0 . to study the relation between these low @xmath1 low @xmath0 blazars and the blazar sequence , we present correlations of the parameter @xmath3 with the ratio of compton to synchrotron peak frequencies ( @xmath4 ) and with the ratio of compton to synchrotron luminosities ( @xmath5 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the results indicate that both correlations are significant with a pearson s probability for null correlation of @xmath6 and @xmath7 respectively . </S>",

    "<S> , we collect the black hole masses of 30 blazars from archives , and find that the hole mass correlates with the parameter @xmath8 ( @xmath9 ) . </S>",
