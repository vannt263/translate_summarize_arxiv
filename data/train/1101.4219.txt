    "following the epoch of recombination at z @xmath61000 , the next major event in the history of the universe was its reionization by an early generation of massive stars and/or black holes .",
    "one of the major goals of modern cosmology is to understand this process : what sources were responsible and when did it occur ?",
    "observations of the cosmic microwave background with wmap show that reionization occurred at a mean redshift of 11.0@xmath71.4 ( dunkley et al .",
    "2009 ) , while observations of absorption due to the lyman @xmath1 forest in quasars show that reionization was not quite complete until a redshift of about six ( e.g. fan et al .",
    "2006 ) .",
    "based on the observed luminosity functions of active galactic nuclei and star - forming galaxies at the relevant redshifts , the latter appear to be the more energetically plausible source for reionization ( e.g. bouwens et al . 2010 ) . however , a major uncertainty in the contribution of star forming galaxies is the poorly constrained fraction of ionizing photons that are able to leak out of such galaxies into the intergalactic medium .",
    "bouwens et al .",
    "( 2010 ) estimate that an escape fraction of 20% ( 60% ) is required for consistency with the wmap results at the 2@xmath8 ( 1 @xmath8 ) level .",
    "many attempts have been made to measure this escape - fraction in star - forming galaxies at low - redshift ( leitherer et al .",
    "1995 ; hurwitz et al . 1997 ; deharveng et al . 2001 ; heckman et al .",
    "2001 - hereafter h01 ; bergvall et al . 2006 ; grimes et al .",
    "2009 - hereafter g09 ) , intermediate redshift ( malkan et al .",
    "2003 , siana et al .",
    "2007,2010 ; cowie et al .",
    "2009 ) and high- redshift ( steidel et al . 2001 ; giallongo et al . 2002 ; fernandez - soto et al . 2003",
    "; inoue et al . 2005 ; vanzella et al . 2010 ) . for the most part",
    ", these measurements have only yielded upper limits , although significant escaping lyman continuum emission has been detected in 17 out of a sample of 198 lyman break and lyman @xmath1 galaxies at @xmath9 ( iwata et al .",
    "2009 ) , consistent with earlier results for a smaller sample of lyman break galaxies ( shapley et al .",
    "in contrast , vanzella et al . (",
    "2010 ) found evidence for escaping lyman continuum in only 1 of 100 lyman break galaxies at z @xmath6 4 .",
    "why do only a minority of the high - z galaxies and none of the low - z galaxies show a significant leakage of ionizing radiation ? in this regard , it is instructive to note that an hi column density of only 1.6 @xmath10 @xmath11 is required to produce unit optical depth at the lyman edge .",
    "the area - averaged column densities of cold gas in star - forming galaxies are much larger , ranging from @xmath12 @xmath11 in ordinary low - redshift galactic disks to as high as @xmath13 @xmath11 in local starbursts and high - z star - forming galaxies ( kennicutt 1998 ; genzel et al .",
    "the escape of ionizing radiation must then be determined by the topology of the interstellar medium , which will in turn be strongly influenced by feedback from massive stars .",
    "it may be that rather exceptional circumstances are required to produce the required channels of very low column - density neutral gas .",
    "such processes have been extensively studied from a theoretical perspective ovre the past decade ( e.g. dove et al .",
    "2000 ; clarke & oey 2002 ; fujita et al .",
    "2003 ; gnedin & kravtsov 2008 ; wise & cen 2009 ; razoumov & somer - larson 2010 ; yajima et al . 2010 ) .",
    "these considerations provide the motivation of the present paper : to find local examples of galaxies in which a potentially significant fraction of the ionizing radiation may be escaping , and to then exploit the relative ease of observing such bright local objects to gain insight into the physical processes that facilitate this escape . to be able to assess the cosmological implications of the results of such an approach , it is important to observe local galaxies that most closely resemble the type of uv - bright high - redshift galaxies that are candidates for the reionization of the universe .",
    "we began such an investigation in overzier et al .",
    "( 2009 - hereafter o09 ) , where we reported on spitzer photometry , hst imaging , and sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) optical spectroscopy of a sample of 31 lyman break analogs ( lbas ) .",
    "these lbas are a very rare population of local galaxies that strongly resemble the high - z lyman break galaxies ( heckman et al .",
    "2005 ; hoopes et al . 2007 ; overzier at al . 2008;2010 ; basu- zych et al .",
    "2007;2009 ) .",
    "they are defined to have a range in far - uv luminosity ( @xmath14 l@xmath4 ) and far - uv effective surface brightness ( @xmath15 l@xmath4 kpc@xmath16 ) that are similar to typical lyman break galaxies .",
    "we showed in o09 that the morphologies of lbas as revealed in multi - band hst images fall into two distinct categories .",
    "the first class ( 25 objects ) consists of galaxies in which multiple bright complexes of clumps and knots reside in a galaxy whose disturbed morphology is suggestive of a major merger or strong tidal interaction . the second class ( six objects )",
    "consists of galaxies whose uv image is dominated by a single extremely massive ( @xmath17 one - to - several billion @xmath18 ) and compact ( radius of - order 100 pc ) central object ( a dominant central object , or dco ) .",
    "we pointed out that the star - formation rates derived for these six galaxies based on the extinction- corrected h@xmath1 luminosities were systematically smaller than those derived from the spitzer mid - ir luminosity ( by factors of @xmath6 2 to 5 ) , and speculated that a possible explanation was that these galaxies were leaking ionizing radiation into the intergalactic medium .",
    "in this paper we test this idea using new hubble space telescope ( hst ) far - uv observations with the cosmic origins spectrograph ( cos ) of a sample of eight lbas from o09 .",
    "we will combine these new data with archival far ultraviolet spectroscopic explorer ( fuse ) data for three other lbas and for fifteen more typical uv - bright local starbursts .",
    "we will describe the sample selection in section 2 and the observations and data analysis in section 3 .",
    "we will present our results and consider their interpretation in section 4 , and summarize these results and their implications in section 5 .",
    "we have previously used the hopkins ultraviolet telescope and fuse to search for the direct evidence of the escape of ionizing radiation from local starbursts ( leitherer et al . 1995 ; h01 ; g09 ) , but the modest sensitivity of these facilities was sufficient only to observe three lbas ( none of which contained a dco ) . with the recent installation of the cosmic origins spectrograph ( cos ) on the hubble space telescope ( hst ) ,",
    "we are now in a position to obtain high - quality far - uv spectra of a significantly larger sample of these galaxies , including some with dcos .    for the redshifts of the lbas in our hst program ( @xmath19 0.1 to 0.25 )",
    ", the sensitivity of cos is poor in the rest - frame lyman continuum .",
    "the sensitivity is much better at longer wavelengths , so in this paper we follow h01 and g09 and use the residual intensity in the core of the strongest far - uv interstellar absorption - lines from the neutral phase of the interstellar medium as a probe of the intensity in the region below the lyman edge",
    ". we will describe this in more detail in section 3 below .",
    "this approach requires the observations to be obtained through an aperture that encloses the bulk of the starburst s emission ( so that a global constraint is obtained ) .",
    "it also requires that the width of instrumental spectral line - spread function is significantly smaller than the characteristic velocity dispersion in the starburst ( so that the interstellar absorption lines are well resolved ) .",
    "finally , the data need to have a high signal - to - noise ratio in the far- uv continuum so that useful constraints are derived .    based on these considerations ,",
    "we will consider two data sets in this paper .",
    "the first consists of the sample of eighteen galaxies studied by h01 and g09 .",
    "these are local starburst or star - forming galaxies observed with the far - ultraviolet spectroscopic explorer ( fuse - moos et al .",
    "2000 ) , each having signal - to - noise better than 4.6 per 0.078    ( @xmath6 25 km",
    "s@xmath5 ) spectral element in the fuse lif1a channel ( see g09 ) .",
    "the observations and properties of this sample are described in table 1 .",
    "three of these galaxies are in fact lbas without a dco : mrk 54 ( deharveng et al . 2001 ) , haro 11 ( grimes et al .",
    "2007 ) , and vv 114 ( grimes et al . 2006 ) .",
    "however , most of these galaxies have considerably lower uv luminosities and star - formation rates than the lbas .",
    "they also span a much broader range in galaxy mass and metallicity ( see g09 and o09 , and compare table 1 and 2 ) .",
    "the second is a sample of eight lbas observed with the cosmic origins spectrograph ( froning & green 2009 ) on the hubble space telescope ( program 11727 : pi t. heckman ) .",
    "these are members of a sample of 31 lbas with hst uv images discussed by o09 and were selected for spectroscopy based on a high uv flux through the cos aperture and a compact uv size ( so that the cos line - spread function is not significantly degraded ) .",
    "these observations and the properties of this sample are listed in table 2 and hst images are shown in figure 1 . in the discussion to follow we will refer to the eight lbas with hst cos data and the three lbas with fuse data as the lba sample .",
    "we will refer to the other fifteen galaxies with fuse data as the local starburst sample .",
    "the observations and data reduction of the fuse sample have been described in detail in h01 and g09 .",
    "we refer the reader to these papers .",
    "all the data were obtained through the 30 x 30 arcsec lwrs aperture , except for the cases of ngc 5253 and ngc 7714 ( which used the 4 x 20 arcsec mdrs aperture ) . as shown by g09",
    "these apertures encompass most or all of the starburst in the far - uv . these spectra cover the observed wavelength range from 905 to 1187   ( see table 1 for the corresponding range in the rest - frame ) . depending on the angular size of the starburst in the far - uv ,",
    "the instrumental spectral resolution is @xmath20 5000 to 14,000 , corresponding to a velocity dispersion of @xmath21 9 to 25 km s@xmath5 ( g09 ) . in all cases",
    "the interstellar absorption lines in the starbursts are well resolved .    for the hst - cos sample",
    "we have used the cos g130 m and g160 m gratings to obtain spectra of our eight targets . as can be seen in figure 1 ,",
    "the cos aperture encompasses most or all of the galaxy .",
    "we have retrieved these data from the hst mast archive after they have been processed through the standard cos pipeline .",
    "the merged spectra cover a range from about 1160 to 1780  with the corresponding range in the rest- frame wavelength given for each sample member in table 2 . as with the fuse data , the instrumental spectral resolution depends on the angular size of the far - uv continuum within the cos aperture .",
    "our hst uv images ( o09 ) yield sizes of 0.1 to 0.5 arcsec ( fwhm ) , and we estimate that the resulting spectral resolution is @xmath22 3000 to 13,000 , corresponding to a velocity dispersion of @xmath21 10 to 43 km s@xmath5 ( similar to the fuse data ) .    for the new cos spectra we have",
    "fit each merged g130 m and g160 m spectrum with a starburst99 ( leitherer et al .",
    "1999 ) model spectrum for a young stellar population with a metallcity similar to that of the corresponding lba ( table 2 ) .",
    "we did not attempt to obtain a rigorous best - fit , but simply adopted a standard chabrier ( 2003 ) imf and assumed a constant rate of star - formation .",
    "we varied the duration of the star - formation until we obtained ( by eye ) a satisfactory fit to the strong stellar wind features .",
    "we then took the ratio of the model and the data and fit the result with a low - order polynomial ( avoiding spectral regions with strong emission or absorption features ) .",
    "we then divided the data by the polynomial to obtain a normalized spectrum .",
    "an example of this is shown in figure 2 .",
    "the opacity of the interstellar medium to lyman continuum photons is due to two primary sources : the photoelectric opacity of the neutral hydrogen and the opacity of dust .",
    "the latter significantly affects the entire uv continuum in typical local starbursts and high - z galaxies .",
    "we will focus first on measuring constraints on the photoelectric opacity .",
    "later we will comment on the importance of dust .",
    "the only direct probe of the photoelectric opacity is the direct measurement of the relative intensity in the continuum shortward of the lyman edge .",
    "the fuse data provide clean access to this spectral region and adequate signal - to - noise in only 5 targets . g09",
    "have used these data to derive upper limits to the escape of ionizing radiation for these galaxies ( see also deharveng et al . 2001 ; bergvall et al .",
    "the cos data do not sample this spectral region in any galaxy .",
    "thus , to gain insight into the escape of ionizing radiation for our two samples we will follow h01 and g09 and use as probes the residual intensity in the core of the strongest interstellar absorption lines that primarily arise in the neutral interstellar medium .",
    "for the fuse data the strongest such line is cii@xmath231036.3 and for the hst - cos data the strongest such line is cii@xmath231334.5 .",
    "thus in both samples we will use the same ionic species as a tracer of the neutral ism.1277.2 line should be comparable in strength to the two cii lines in this case , however it is extremely weak in our cos spectra and in the spectra of other local starburst galaxies ( e.g. heckman et al .",

    "let us consider two limiting idealized cases . in the first , we assume a picket - fence model in which the far - uv source is surrounded by a population of clouds that are optically thick in both the absorption line and the lyman continuum and that cover a fraction @xmath25 of the sky as seen by the source . in this case",

    "we have used the set of siii absorption - lines available in the cos data . like cii , siii is the dominant ion of silicon in the neutral ism . by using lines that all arise in the same ionic species , but which span a range in oscillator strengths , a comparison of the absorption profiles among these lines allows us to estimate the optical depth and covering factor of the gas ( e.g. heckman et al .",

    "they argue that in this case the optical depth to ly@xmath1 photons is unusually low in the foreground outflowing material and that this is naturally related to the low covering factor of neutral gas they infer in this object ( precisely the situation we see in our three galaxies ) .",

    "leitherer et al , 2002 ) these seds imply roughly two magnitudes of dust extinction along the line - of- sight to the dco in the far - uv .",
    "this then raises a very interesting question .",

    "the answer must be that this dust is associated with _",
    "ionized _ gas that covers most or all of the dco .",
    "this picture requires that the cores of the strongest absorption - lines due to the ionized gas should be nearly black ( unlike the case of lines from the neutral phase ) .",
    "examination of the profiles in figure 6 shows that this is the case in lba0808 + 39 ( a relative residual intensity in the siiii@xmath231206.5 line of 10% ) , lba0921 + 45 ( 7% ) , and lba2103- 07 ( @xmath243% ) . in the case of lba0213 + 12 ,",

    "this should be the strongest interstellar line due to ionized gas , and as such provides the most sensitive probe .",
    "although the data are noisy , the relative residual intensity in this line is small ( 10% or less ) .",
    "thus , in this galaxy the siiii line is optically thin , while the ciii line is optically thick .",
    "we therefore conclude that the ionized gas has a near - unit covering factor in the dcos . one plausible physical model would be that the neutral gas represents the denser cores of clouds being accelerated by the wind , while the ionized gas represents a lower density halo of gas and dust surrounding the cloud core and which is being ablated by the wind and photoionized by the intense radiation field ( e.g. marcolini et al .",
    "2005 ) .",
    "can the dco photoionize a column of gas with the required amount of dust ?",

    "it is straightforward to show that in this case the ionization parameter in the clouds is given by : + 6 ) @xmath61 + where @xmath62 is the wind momentum flux in units of 10@xmath63 dynes and @xmath64 is the starburst ionizing photon production rate ( in units of 10@xmath65 sec@xmath66 ) .",
    "the ionizing photons are produced by the most massive stars with lifetimes @xmath24 4 myr , while the momentum in the starburst wind derives primarily from supernovae ( whose progenitors have lifetimes of @xmath24 40 myr ) . in equilibrium",

    "these ages are consistent with current constraints on the dcos ( o09 and see figure 3 ) .",
    "we therefore conclude that it is feasible for the dcos to photoionize a matter - bounded column of gas that is sufficient to contain enough dust to produce the observed reddening and the inferred attenuation of the far - uv continuum and yet have a photoelectric opacity at the lyman edge that is less than one .",
    "one of the major goals in cosmology is to understand the process by which the universe was reionized .",
    "the most plausible source for the ionizing photons is an early generation of hot massive stars in forming galaxies .",
    "the primary uncertainty at present is the unknown fraction of such ionizing photons that are able to escape from the galaxies and reach the neutral hydrogen in the inter - galactic medium .",
    "the column densities of gas associated with such intense star formation correspond to extremely high optical depths in the lyman continuum .",
    "it seems nearly certain that some form of feedback from the massive stars is required to produce the pathways through which the ionizing photons can escape .",

    "this approach is made possible by the high spectral resolution ( @xmath70 ) and good signal - to - noise in our data .",
    "we find that there is a significant residual intensity ( @xmath6 30 to 50% ) in the cii line core in four out of eleven of the lbas but in none of the fifteen typical local starbursts .",
    "we show that in all four of these cases the residual intensity reflects an incomplete covering of the far - uv source by optically thick clouds ( a picket fence model ) .",
    "independent evidence for a significant escape of ionizing radiation is provided by the anomalously weak h@xmath1 emission ( relative to the sum of the far - uv and far - ir emission ) in three of these four galaxies .",

    "we have also examined the profiles of the ly@xmath1 line in the cos data of the eight lbas for additional clues .",
    "we find that there is strong emission both blueward and redward of the systemic velocity in the three objects in which a high escape fraction is likely .",
    "this strongly suggests an incomplete covering of the fuv source by neutral clouds ( in agreement with the properties of the metal lines ) .",

    "the interstellar absorption lines in all four of the lbas with dcos show extremely high outflow speeds : the line centroids are blueshifted by about 700 km s@xmath5 and the gas reaches maximum outflow velocities of at least 1500 km s@xmath5 .",
    "these are significantly higher than the velocities seen in other low redshift starbursts or in typical high redshift galaxies .",
    "we have shown that these high speeds can be explained in principle by the acceleration of gas clouds in a starburst - driven wind .",
    "the exceptionally high velocities would be due to a large amount of momentum deposition in such an unusually small region , leading to an extremely high wind ram pressure and/or radiation pressure at the launch point for the clouds .",
    "the far - uv emission from the dcos is significantly reddened and attenuated by dust .",
    "we have argued that this dust must reside in the ionized gas and have shown that the ionized gas fully covers the far - uv source ( the dco ) .",
    "this situation is made possible by the intense ionizing radiation field in these galaxies ( leading to significant column densities of dusty ionized gas that is optically thin in the lyman continuum ) .",
    "based on the above considerations , it is tempting to link the escape of ionizing radiation to the extreme feedback associated with the dcos",
    ". the combination of a high rate of energy deposition ( kinetic energy and ionizing radiation ) within such a small volume may be the key to excavating channels through the interstellar medium and also intensely irradiating these channels so that they are fully ionized and translucent to ionizing radiation .",
    "it is interesting that only 19% ( @xmath72 ) of the sample of lbas imaged by o09 contain a dco .",
    "together with the present results this would suggest that large relative escape fractions are present in only 13% of lbas .",
    "this is similar to the fractions seen in high- redshift galaxies ( shapley et al .",
    "2006 ; iwata et al . 2009 ) .",
    "could the presence or absence of dcos in these galaxies explain these results as well ?",
    "it is important to note that in the sample of lbas studied by overzier et al .",

    "2009 ) .",
    "we are instead suggesting that objects similar to the dcos in this paper may exist in these early galaxies and facilitate the escape of ionizing radiation .",

    "<S> the source responsible for reionizing the universe at @xmath0 remains uncertain . </S>",
    "<S> while an energetically adequate population of star - forming galaxies may be in place , it is unknown whether a large enough fraction of their ionizing radiation can escape into the intergalactic medium . </S>",
    "<S> attempts to measure this escape - fraction in intensely star - forming galaxies at lower redshifts have largely yielded upper limits . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we present new hst cos and archival fuse far - uv spectroscopy of a sample of eleven lyman break analogs ( lbas ) , a rare population of local galaxies that strongly resemble the high - z lyman break galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> we combine these data with sdss optical spectra and spitzer photometry . </S>",
    "<S> we also analyse archival fuse observations of fifteen typical uv - bright local starbursts . </S>",
    "<S> we find evidence of small covering factors for optically - thick neutral gas in three cases . </S>",
    "<S> this is based on two independent pieces of evidence : a significant residual intensity in the cores of the strongest interstellar absorption - lines tracing neutral gas and a small ratio of extinction - corrected h@xmath1 to uv plus far - ir luminosities . </S>",
    "<S> these objects represent three of the four lbas that contain a young , very compact ( @xmath2 pc ) , and highly massive ( @xmath3 m@xmath4 ) dominant central object ( dco ) . </S>",
    "<S> these three objects also differ from the other galaxies in showing a significant amount of blueshifted ly@xmath1 emission , which may be related to the low covering factor of neutral gas . </S>",
    "<S> all four lbas with dcos in our sample show extremely high velocity outflows of interstellar gas , with line centroids blueshifted by about 700 km s@xmath5 and maximum outflow velocities reaching at least 1500 km s@xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> we show that these properties are consistent with an outflow driven by a powerful starburst that is exceptionally compact . </S>",
    "<S> we speculate that such extreme feedback may be required to enable the escape of ionizing radiation from star forming galaxies . </S>"
