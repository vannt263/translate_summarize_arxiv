    "mirroring cultural progress  @xcite during their evolution natural languages - the most imaginative carriers of information , and the principal clue to the mind and to consciousness  @xcite - developed remarkable quantifiable patterns of behaviour such as hierarchical structure in their syntactic organization  @xcite , a corresponding lack of characteristic scale  @xcite as evidenced by the celebrated zipf law  @xcite , small world properties  @xcite , long - range correlations in the use of words  @xcite or a stretched exponential distribution  @xcite of word recurrence times  @xcite .",
    "a majority of such patterns are common to a large class of natural systems known as complex systems  @xcite . with no doubt",
    ", language constitutes a great complexity as it for language is especially true  @xcite that `` more is different ''  @xcite and the capacity of language is to generate an infinite range of expressions from the finite set of elements  @xcite .",
    "thus this suggests to inspect correlations also among the linguistic constructs longer than mere words .",
    "the most natural of them are sentences - strings of words structured according to syntactical principles  @xcite .",
    "typically it is within a sentence that words acquire a specific meaning .",
    "furthermore , in a text the sentence structure is expected to be correlated with the surrounding sentences as dictated by the intended information to be encoded , fluency , rhythm , harmony , intonation and possibly due to many other factors and feedbacks including the authors preferences .",
    "consequently , this may introduce even more complex correlations than those identified so far .",
    "in fact already the hurst exponent based study  @xcite of correlations among words in shakespeare s plays and in dickens and darwin s books suggests that the range of such correlations extends far beyond the span of sentences .",
    "indeed , shuffling sentences by preserving their internal structure appears to bring the hurst exponents to values even closer to the noise level as compared to their original values .",
    "this thus indicates that long - range correlations among words are induced by factors other than grammar as its range is restricted essentially to a sentence . as an indication for potential factors generating correlations far beyond the range of single sentences",
    "one should notice that the composition of sentences of varied length dictates the reading rhythm which involves sound and perception .",
    "this , therefore , opens up a possibility that the weber - fechner law  @xcite - stating that in perception it is the relative proportions that matter primarily , and not differences in absolute magnitudes - leaves its imprints also in the sentence arrangement by making some variant of the multiplicative cascade a likely component of the mechanism that amplifies the associative turns and thus induces correlations of significantly longer range than the ones due to grammar .",
    "there are , however , also coarse graining constraints to such a mechanism as sentences can not usually be expanded continuously but by adding clauses , so that syntactical rules are obeyed . the multifractal formalism  @xcite offers a particularly appropriate framework to get insight into such effects and to quantify their relative significance and extent",
    "in order to study the long - range correlations among sentences , particularly those that refer to fractals and cascade effects , we select a corpus of 113 english , french , german , italian , polish , russian , and spanish literary texts of considerable size and for each individually form a series @xmath3 from the lengths of the consecutive sentences @xmath4 expressed in terms of the number of words .",
    "thus , a sentence is defined in purely orthographic terms , as a sequence of words starting with a capital letter and ending in a full stop .",
    "equivalently , in a text , such a series can be considered a sequence of the recurrence times of the full stops . based on this criterion an initial selection of sentences",
    "is performed automatically but then a further processing is executed , in some cases even manually , in order to identify such ( not very frequent ) instances where a full stop does not terminate a sentence , like for instance mr .",
    ", in initials , question or exclamation marks in parenthesis , etc . since the present study has a statistical character , an additional criterion we impose specifies that each text contains no fewer than 5000 sentences . for the correlated series , as the ones to be studied here , such a lower bound on the number of sentences is dictated by requirements to obtain reliable results even on the level of the multifractal analysis  @xcite .",
    "a complete list of the titles included in this corpus is given in the appendix .",
    "the simplest , second - order linear characteristics are measured in terms of the power spectra @xmath0 of such series .",
    "such spectra are calculated as fourier transform modulus squared @xmath5 of the series @xmath3 representing lengths of the consecutive sentences @xmath4 .",
    "a complementary approach towards higher order correlations consists in the wavelet decomposition of @xmath3 . the corresponding ` mathematical microscope ' wavelet coefficient maps @xmath6 are obtained as @xmath7 where @xmath8 represents the wavelet position in a text while @xmath9 the wavelet resolution scale .",
    "the wavelet @xmath10 used in the present study is a gaussian third derivative .",
    "it is orthogonal - hence insensitive - to quadratic trends in a signal and thus effectively leads to their removal  @xcite as demanded by consistency with the other method described and used below .",
    "the wavelet decomposition is optimal for visualization and , in principle , it is well suited to extract the multifractal characteristics  @xcite .",
    "however , the newer method , termed multifractal detrended fluctuation analysis ( mfdfa )  @xcite is numerically more stable and often more accurate  @xcite , though even here the convergence to a correct result is a delicate matter  @xcite .",
    "accordingly , for a series @xmath3 of sentence lengths one evaluates its signal profile @xmath11}$ ] , where @xmath12 denotes the series average and @xmath13 with @xmath14 standing for the number of sentences in a series .",
    "this profile is then divided into @xmath15 disjoint segments @xmath16 of length @xmath9 starting from both end points of the series .",
    "next , the detrended variance @xmath17 is determined , where a polynomial @xmath18 of order @xmath19 serves detrending .",
    "finally , a @xmath20-th order fluctuation function @xmath21^{q/2 } \\bigg\\}^{1/q } , \\label{fq}\\ ] ] is calculated and its scale @xmath9 dependence inspected .",
    "scale invariance in a form @xmath22 indicates the most general multifractal structure if the generalised hurst exponent @xmath23 is explicitly @xmath20-dependent , while it is reduced to monofractal when @xmath23 becomes @xmath20-independent .",

    ", @xmath28 typically assumes a shape resembling an inverted parabola whose widths @xmath29 is considered a measure of the degree of multifractality and thus often also of complexity .",
    "a highly significant result is obtained already by evaluating the power spectra @xmath0 according to eq.([ps ] ) of the series representing the sentence length variability ( slv ) of all the text considered . as documented in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , the overall trend of essentially all sample texts , and especially its average , shows a clear @xmath30 scaling with @xmath31 , in most cases over the entire range of about two orders of magnitude in frequencies @xmath32 spanned by the number of sentences of a typical text here analyzed .",
    "statistical significance of this result is inspected by randomly shuffling sentences within texts .",
    "for the so obtained randomized texts the calculated power spectra appear to be trivially fluctuating along a horizontal line ( @xmath33 ) on all the scales .     of the sentence length variability for 113 world famous literary works .",

    "the two extremes in the corpus , explicitly indicated , are henry james s _ the ambassadors _ ( upper ) and madeleine and/or georges de scudry s _ artamne ou le grand cyrus _ , the 17^th^ century novel sequence ( lower ) , considered the longest novel ever published .",

    "this kind of scaling points to the existence of the power - law long - range temporal correlations in slv - thus to its fractal organization - and indicates that it balances randomness and orderliness , just as it does for music , speech  @xcite , heart rate  @xcite , cognition  @xcite , spontaneous brain activity  @xcite , and for other ` sounds of nature '  @xcite . from this perspective",
    "human writing appears to correlate with them .",
    "even the range of the corresponding @xmath35-values from about 1/4 to 3/4 overlaps significantly ( more on the mozart s than beethoven s side ) with those ( 1/2 to 1 ) found  @xcite for musical compositions .",

    "the first of them appears to be most peculiar among all the texts as at the small frequencies it visibly departs from @xmath36 by bending down and displaying the two preferred frequencies .",

    "the latter novel , on the other hand , with @xmath38 appears closest to the white noise whose @xmath0 is flat .",
    "it is also appropriate to notice that at the largest frequencies , which corresponds to the smallest scales , the power spectra of all the texts have some tendency to flatten .",
    "this may suggest that the long - range coherence in its @xmath36 organization is somewhat perturbed on shorter scales by coarsening due to grammatical constraints .     of the consecutive sentence lengths throughout the whole text .",

    "such structures may demand using the whole spectrum of the scaling exponents and are then termed multifractals . that such structures in slv may be present within the corpus analysed here can be inferred from fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , which shows four , somewhat distinct , categories of behaviour .",
    "a majority of the texts in our study resembles the case displayed in ( * i * ) .",
    "slv is here seen to be rather homogenously ` erratic ' and , consequently , the distribution of cascades seen through the wavelet decomposition is largely uniform .",
    "the three other cases , ( * ii * ) , ( * iii * ) and ( * iv * ) , commonly considered representatives of the stream of consciousness ( soc ) literary style that seeks `` to depict the multitudinous thoughts and feelings which pass through the mind ''  @xcite , are visibly inhomogeneous in this respect , as slv displays clusters of intermittent bursts of much longer sentences .",
    "such structures are characteristic of multifractals and thus an appropriate subject of the analysis within the above formalism .",
    "the fluctuation functions @xmath46 obtained according to eq.([fq ] ) display ( fig .  [ fig2 ] ) a convincing scaling with different degree of @xmath20-dependence , however .",
    "this is corroborated by the corresponding singularity spectra @xmath28 , which range from very narrow in _",

    "hence , asymmetry in @xmath47 signals non - uniformity of the underlying hypothesized cascade  @xcite .",
    "_ rayuela _ is thus seen to be more multifractal in the composition of long sentences and almost monofractal on the level of small ones .",
    "to some extent the opposite applies to _ the waves_. in fact , these effects can be inferred already from the non - uniformities of the corresponding slv wavelet decompositions ( fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) . in this respect",
    "_ fw _ appears impressively consistent ; being one of the most intriguing literary ` compositions ' ever , mastered imaginatively in the soc technique , freely exploring the mental labyrinth of dreams and thus often breaking conventional rules of syntax and of linguistic rigour .",
    "however , from the perspective of our formal quantitative approach , its architecture looks - or perhaps just is - a result of these factors - to be governed consistently by the same ` generators ' on all scales of sentence length .",
    "an extra intellectual factor shaping _",
    "fw _ is very likely to be also related to its top - bottom development - much like model mathematical cascades - as evidenced by its chronology of writing  @xcite graphically sketched in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] .",
    "the significance of the above results for the singularity spectra @xmath28 of the series @xmath3 representing the original texts has also been tested against the two corresponding surrogates . one standard surrogate in this kind of analysis is obtained by generating the fourier - phase randomised counterparts of @xmath3 .",
    "this destroys nonlinear correlations and makes probability distribution of fluctuations gaussian - like , but preserves the linear correlations and , as it is clearly seen in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , shrinks @xmath28 essentially to a point as is characteristic of a pure monofractal .",
    "another surrogate is obtained by randomly shuffling the original series @xmath3 .",
    "consequently , any temporal correlations get destroyed but the probability distributions of fluctuations remain unchanged .",
    "the corresponding singularity spectra calculated according to the same mfdfa algorithm are also shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ( gray ) .",
    "consistently with the lack of any temporal correlations they all get shifted down to @xmath48 but some nonzero width of @xmath28 still remains to be observed .",
    "however , at least a large part of this remaining multifractality in this last case may be apparent due to a relatively small size of the samples .",
    "for the uncorrelated series the result of calculating the multifractal spectra is known  @xcite to end up in either mono - fractal for the series whose fluctuation probability distributions are lvy - unstable , or in bi - fractal for those whose distributions are lvy - stable .",
    "contrary to the correlated series , the convergence to the ultimate correct results in this case is very slow .",
    "we also wish to note at this point that in spite of the menzerath - altmann law , all the relevant results shown here remain essentially unchanged if the sentence length is measured in terms of the number of characters instead of the number of words .",

    "[ fig4 ] no unique multifractal scaling can be attributed , and thus no @xmath28 assigned .",
    "the slv inspected both in terms of the sentence length distribution and through its wavelet transform indicate clearly that _ ulysses _ splits into two parts such that each of them may independently have well defined scaling properties .",
    "indeed , by bisecting it approximately into halves ( between chapters 10 and 11 ) allows us again to comprise _ ulysses _ within the present formalism .",
    "the first part appears essentially monofractal , while the other is clearly multifractal , though asymmetrically left - sided , just as _ rayuela_. in fact , this result provides a quantitative argument in favour of the  doubleness  of _ ulysses _  @xcite .",
    "the results , represented in terms of the width @xmath49 of @xmath28 , where @xmath50 and @xmath51 denote the beginning and the end of @xmath28 support , and of the hurst exponents @xmath52 measuring the degree of persistence in slv , for the whole studied corpus are collected in fig .",

    "therefore , the lower bound of the shaded area is determined as an average of @xmath57 s for all the series ( texts ) shuffled . due to the thickest tails in the probability distributions @xmath39 of @xmath3 in _ fw _ ( seen in the inset to panel * iv * of fig .

    "the tails of these distributions , starting at around @xmath64 , appear to be well represented by the stretched exponential @xmath65 with the smallest @xmath60 parameter and thus the thickest tail for the soc narrative , thus multifractal in slv .",
    "this parameter remains , however , significantly smaller than unity even in the monofractal regime .",
    "this result closely resembles the stretched exponential distribution of recurrence times between words  @xcite . in a sense",
    "the sentence length can be interpreted as a recurrence time between the full stops and they , in a text , play at least as important role as words .",
    "their large recurrence times appear to be governed by a similar distribution as the one for words .",
    "interesting in this context , and also complementary , is observation documented in the upper - left inset of fig .",

    "the long - range nonlinear correlations responsible for multifractality appear thus to be originating exclusively from the specific arrangement of the full stops in texts .",
    "the situation with the long - range linear correlations is not that extreme as some representative cases expressed in terms of the power spectra @xmath0 shown in fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] illustrate it .",
    "these power spectra for other cases than slv still show a trace of scaling of the form @xmath66 with significantly smaller values of the @xmath35-parameter ( denoted by @xmath67 for slv and by @xmath68 for the word recurrence times ) , however , and larger dispersion of fluctuations along the fit which indicates a very weak character of the underlying long - range linear correlations . very interestingly ,",
    "however , for those texts that are multifractal on the level of slv , the linear long - range correlations for the recurrence times between words do not depart so much from the correlations measured by slv in the same texts and are significantly stronger than in the monofractal texts , as the examples in fig .",

    "this frame seems to obey more strict universal principles of organization , likely shaped also by the factors listed in the introduction , and words have some more freedom in filling and complementing it as can be inferred from their weaker mutual correlations .",
    "such a scenario offers one possible visualization of the results obtained .",
    "finally , the results presented - like imprints of the weber - fechner law through slv cascades - appear largely consistent with the working hypothesis formulated in the introduction by listing factors that may induce long - range correlations during the process of the narrative text formation . in order to further illuminate on such issues some empirical study , like quantifying the vocal and perception characteristics of texts with varying strength of slv correlations , would be crucially helpful and our results indicate direction .",

    "<S> a distinct role of the full stops in inducing the long - range correlations in texts is evidenced by the fact that the above quantitative characteristics on the long - range correlations manifest themselves in variation of the full stops recurrence times along texts , thus in slv , but to a much lesser degree in the recurrence times of the most frequent words . in this latter case </S>",
