    "matrix variate distributions have proven to be useful for modelling three - way data , such as multivariate longitudinal data . however , in most cases , the underlying distribution has been elliptical such as the matrix variate normal and the matrix variate @xmath0 distributions .",
    "however , there has been relatively little work done on matrix variate data that can account for skewness present in the data .",
    "the work that has been carried out in the area of matrix variate skew distributions is mostly limited to the matrix variate skew - normal distribution .",
    "herein , we derive a matrix variate skew-@xmath0 distribution .",
    "the remainder of this paper is laid out as follows . in section  2 ,",
    "some background is presented . in section  3 ,",
    "the density of the matrix variate skew-@xmath0 distribution is derived and a parameter estimation procedure is given .",
    "section  4 looks at some simulations , and we conclude with a summary and some future work ( section  5 ) .",
    "one natural method to model three - way data is to use a matrix - variate distribution .",
    "there are many examples in the literature of such distributions , the most well - known being the matrix - normal distribution . for notional clarity , we use @xmath1 to denote a realization of a random matrix @xmath2 .",
    "an @xmath3 random matrix @xmath2 follows a matrix variate normal distribution with location parameter @xmath4 and scale matrices @xmath5 and @xmath6 of dimensions @xmath7 and @xmath8 , respectively .",
    "we write @xmath9 to denote such a random matrix and the density of @xmath2 can be written @xmath10    one well known property of the matrix variate normal distribution @xcite is @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the multivariate normal density with dimension @xmath13 , @xmath14 is the vectorization of @xmath4 , and @xmath15 is the kronecker product .",
    "although the matrix variate normal is arguably the most mathematically tractable , there are examples of non - normal cases .",
    "one famous example is the wishart distribution @xcite arising as the distribution of the sample covariance matrix of a multivariate normal sample .",
    "more recently , however , there has been some work done in the area of matrix skew distributions such as the matrix - variate skew normal distribution , e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "more information on matrix variate distributions can be found in @xcite .",
    "very recently , there has also been work done in the area of finite mixtures .",
    "specifically , @xcite looked at clustering and classification of multivariate longitudinal data using a mixture of matrix variate normal distributions .",
    "also , @xcite , looked at mixtures of matrix variate @xmath0 distributions .",
    "various multivariate distributions such as the multivariate @xmath0 , and skew-@xmath0 , the shifted asymmetric laplace distribution , and the generalized hyperbolic distributions arise as special cases of a normal variance - mean mixture ( cf . * ? ? ?",
    "* ch .  6 ) . in this formulation ,",
    "the density of a @xmath16-dimensional random vector @xmath1 takes the form @xmath17 which is equivalent to the representation @xmath18 where @xmath19 and @xmath20 is a latent random variable with density @xmath21 .",
    "the multivariate skew-@xmath0 distribution with @xmath22 degrees of freedom arises as a special case with @xmath23 , where @xmath24 denotes the inverse gamma distribution with density function @xmath25      a random variable @xmath26 has a generalized inverse gaussian ( gig ) distribution with parameters @xmath27 and @xmath28 if its density function can be written as @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the modified bessel function of the third kind with index @xmath28 . several functions of gig random variables have tractable expected values , e.g. , @xmath31",
    "@xmath32 @xmath33 where @xmath34 , @xmath35 , and @xmath36 is the modified bessel function of the third kind with index @xmath28 .",
    "these results will prove to be useful for parameter estimation for the matrix - variate skew-@xmath0 distribution .",
    "we will say that an @xmath3 random matrix @xmath2 has a matrix variate skew-@xmath0 distribution , @xmath37 , if @xmath2 can be written @xmath38 where @xmath4 and @xmath39 are @xmath3 matrices , @xmath40 , and @xmath23 .",
    "analogous to its multivariate counterpart , @xmath4 is a location matrix , @xmath39 is a skewness matrix , @xmath5 and @xmath6 are scale matrices , and @xmath22 is the degrees of freedom .",
    "it then follows that @xmath41 and thus the joint density of @xmath2 and @xmath42 is @xmath43\\right\\ } , { \\addtocounter{equation}{1}\\tag{\\theequation}}\\label{eqn : joint}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath44 .",

    "as discussed by @xcite and @xcite in the matrix variate normal case , the estimates of @xmath5 and @xmath6 are unique only up to a multiplicative constant .",
    "indeed , if we let @xmath50 and @xmath51 , @xmath52 , the likelihood is unchanged .",
    "this identifiability issue can be resolved , for example , by setting @xmath53 or @xmath54 .",
    "note that @xmath55 , so the estimate of the kronecker product is unique .    for the purposes of parameter estimation , note that the conditional density of @xmath42 is @xmath56^{\\frac{\\lambda}{2}}w^{\\lambda-1}}{2k_{\\lambda}(\\sqrt{\\rho({\\mathbf{a}},{\\mathbf\\sigma},{\\mathbf\\psi})[\\delta({\\mathbf{x}};{\\mathbf{m}},{\\mathbf\\sigma},{\\mathbf\\psi})+\\nu}])}\\exp\\left\\{-\\frac{\\rho({\\mathbf{a}},{\\mathbf\\sigma},{\\mathbf\\psi})w+[{\\delta({\\mathbf{x}};{\\mathbf{m}},{\\mathbf\\sigma},{\\mathbf\\psi})+\\nu}]/{w}}{2}\\right\\}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] therefore , @xmath57 where @xmath58 .",
    "finally , we note that @xmath59 where @xmath60 denotes the multivariate skew-@xmath0 distribution with location parameter @xmath14 , skewness parameter @xmath61 , scale matrix @xmath62 , and @xmath22 degrees of freedom .",
    "this can be easily seen from the representation given in and the property of the matrix normal distribution given in .",
    "note that the normal variance - mean mixture representation as well as the relationship with the multivariate skew-@xmath0 distribution present two convenient methods to generate random matrices from the matrix variate skew @xmath0 distribution .",
    "the former is used in section  4 .",
    "suppose we observe a sample of @xmath63 matrices @xmath64 from an @xmath3 matrix variate skew-@xmath0 distribution .",
    "as with the multivariate skew-@xmath0 distribution , we proceed as if the observed data is incomplete , and introduce the latent variables @xmath65 .",
    "the complete - data log - likelihood is then @xmath66-\\frac{1}{2}\\sum_{i=1}^nw_i{\\,\\mbox{tr}}({\\mathbf\\sigma}^{-1}{\\mathbf{a}}{\\mathbf\\psi}^{-1}{\\mathbf{a}}'),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath67 is constant with respect to the parameters .",

    "set @xmath69    * 2 ) e step * : update @xmath70 , where @xmath71 where @xmath72[\\delta({\\mathbf{x}}_i;\\hat{{\\mathbf{m}}}^{(t)},\\hat{{\\mathbf\\sigma}}^{(t)},\\hat{{\\mathbf\\psi}}^{(t)})+\\hat{\\nu}^{(t)}]},\\ ] ] and @xmath73    * 3 ) first cm step * : update the parameters @xmath74 .",

    "note that there are several options for determining convergence of this ecm algorithm . in the simulations in section  4",
    ", a criterion based on the aitken acceleration @xcite is used .",
    "the aitken acceleration at iteration @xmath0 is @xmath84 where @xmath85 is the ( observed ) log - likelihood at iteration @xmath0 .",
    "the quantity in can be used to derive an asymptotic estimate ( i.e. , an estimate of the value after very many iterations ) of the log - likelihood at iteration @xmath86 , i.e. , @xmath87 ( cf . * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "as in @xcite , we stop our em algorithms when @xmath88 , provided this difference is positive .",

    "indeed , if we let @xmath50 and @xmath51 , @xmath52 , the likelihood is unchanged .",
    "however , we notice that , @xmath55 , so the estimate of the kronecker product is unique .",
    "we conduct two simulations to illustrate the estimation of the parameters . in both simulations ,",
    "we take 50 different datasets of size 100 , from a @xmath89 matrix skew-@xmath0 distribution .",
    "also , in both simulations , @xmath90 and @xmath91 . in simulation 1 , we took the location and skewness matrix to be @xmath92 and @xmath93 , respectively , and @xmath94 and @xmath95 in simulation 2 , where @xmath96    in figures [ fig : lineplots1 ] and [ fig : lineplots2 ] , we show line plots of the marginals for each column ( labelled v1 , v2 , v3 , v4 ) of a typical dataset from simulations  1 and  2 , respectively .",
    "the dashed red lines denote the means .            in figure [",
    "fig : lineplots1 ] , the skewness in columns 1 , 2 , and 4 , for simulation 1 , is very prominent when visually compared to column  3 , which has zero skewness .",
    "the skewness is also apparent in the lineplots for simulation 2 , however , because the values of the skewness are generally less than those for simulation 1 , it is not as prominent .",
    "the component - wise means of the parameters as well as the component wise standard deviations are given in table  [ tab : results ] .",
    "we see that the estimates of the mean matrix and skewness matrix are very close to the true value for both simulations .",
    "moreover , we see that the estimates of @xmath5 and @xmath6 also correspond approximately to the their true values , and thus so would the kronecker product , which is not shown .",
