    "first , we discuss the comparison between full calculations with the one neglecting elastic scattering .",
    "these two calculations notably differ for thick nws .",
    "in contrast , for thin nws , the relative difference in the calculated transport is very small , indicating that elastic scattering only plays a minor role .",
    "this strong reduction of elastic scattering processes with decreasing dimensionality is consistent with the intuitive expectation that elastic mechanisms are suppressed by the discretization of energy levels .",
    "now we compare the calculations using the standard scba , the `` selective scba '' defined above and the full calculation . in the qw limit the standard scba , the  selective scba \" and the full calculation are found to give the same results .",
    "in contrast , in the quantum wire regime , the standard scba totally differs from the two other models .",
    "the reason is that the standard scba fails when the fluctuations of the energy levels become larger than their linewidths . in contrast , in the present full calculation , the main coupling elements , which are diagonal with respect to the lateral eigenstates , are treated coherently . if we now compare the full calculation to the selective scba calculation , we can see that the selective scba provides an excellent approximation to the full calculation , down to 15  nm thin nanowires .",
    "our interpretation is that the typical energy fluctuations of the levels stay smaller than the miniband width and are too weak to induce localization effects .              in fig .",
    "[ harmonicity ] we show a comparison of the calculations with and without the inclusion of phonon anharmonicity for various nw diameters . while the inclusion of anharmonicity is found to be almost irrelevant for thick nws in the qw sl limit , striking differences are observed for thin nws .",
    "indeed the direct lo - phonon emission is gradually suppressed with decreasing dimensionality towards 0d systems , while the mechanism of anharmonic polaron decay becomes dominant .",
    "for very thin nw diameters corresponding to the pure 1d sl limit , note that the simulation without phonon anharmonicity does not converge due to the strong reduction of the linewidths below our numerical possibilities in energy resolution .",
    "hence our calculations show a clear transition in the dominant energy dissipation pathway as the lateral dimensionality is reduced , from direct lo - phonon emission to polaron anharmonicity .",
    "within the negf formalism , we have developed a theory of electronic transport in nanowire sls .",
    "this model allows the calculation of transport in a wide range of nw sl thickness , for lateral dimensionality ranging from 0d to 2d , i.e. from qd sl to qw sl .",
    "we have studied how the transport evolves with this change of lateral dimensionality . while velocity - voltage characteristics are dominated by the standard esaki - tsu ndv in qw sls",
    ", electron - phonon resonances appear when the lateral quantum regime is reached .",
    "in addition , the electron mobility increases and the ndv peaks are strongly shifted to lower electric fields .",
    "this is accompanied by important changes in the dominant scattering mechanisms . in qw sls , the transport is mainly controlled by lo - phonon scattering and elastic scattering processes . in contrast ,",
    "when the lateral dimensionality is reduced , these two mechanisms are progressively suppressed , and anharmonic polaron decay becomes dominant .",

    "in this appendix we give the form factor of the couplings of electrons with longitudinal - optical ( lo ) , surface - optical ( so ) , and longitudinal - acoustical ( la ) phonon modes confined in a cylindrical nanowire .",

    "et al _ @xcite .",
    "however , there , only phonon modes with axial symmetry have been considered .",
    "we expect this approximation to be valid in the thin nanowire limit but to completely fail for large nanowires where la phonons do not necessarily propagate parallel to the nanowire axis . here ,",
    "instead , we neglect the coupling between la and ta modes ( i.e. between compressive and shear modes ) at the surface of the nanowire , and consider the interaction of electrons with all the la modes .",
    "this treatment is exact in the bulk limit and is expected to provide a reasonable approximation for nanowires of moderate size , as far as the nw diameter is large compared to the lattice constant .",
    "we believe such assumption for the boundary conditions does not change significantly the results for the electron transport properties , as ( i ) the nanowire thicknesses studied here are relatively large compared to the atomic scale and ( ii ) the efficiency of the acoustic phonon scattering mechanism is always much weaker than other scattering mechanisms .",
