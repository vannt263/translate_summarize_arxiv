    "defining an effective energy in the presence of spin torque is nontrivial , since only the precession term in the landau - lifshitz equation conserves energy ; the damping and spin torque terms are non - conservative .    the most rigorous way to derive an effective energy is by finding a steady state solution of the fokker - planck equation@xcite , which has the form @xmath13 where @xmath14 \\\\ \\label{eeff}\\ ] ]    it is worth noting , however , that eq .",
