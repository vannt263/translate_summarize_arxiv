    "when wind blows over a liquid surface , waves can be generated and propagate downstream .",
    "despite the fact that this simple phenomenon has inspired over a century of research , understanding the physics of wind wave generation is still a standing challenge @xcite .",
    "a key issue is the determination of the critical velocity @xmath6 above which waves are generated , and the influence of the liquid viscosity on this critical velocity .",
    "it is well known that the inviscid prediction by the simple kelvin - helmholtz model  @xcite , @xmath7   for the air - water interface , largely overestimates the actual threshold observed at sea or in laboratories , typically in the range @xmath8  . however , including viscous corrections to this model does not solve the discrepancy : it only leads to marginal modification of the critical velocity  @xcite , in clear contradiction with experimental observations of higher wind velocity thresholds for more viscous fluids  @xcite . a clear understanding of the influence of the fluid viscosity on the critical velocity is still lacking .",
    "another open question is the nature of the surface deformations below the wave generation threshold",
    ". it would be erroneous to assume that the surface remains entirely flat at low wind velocity : slight surface deformations are often observed in experiments  @xcite , breaking the perfect mirror reflection over a water surface even below the wave onset .",
    "indeed , even for moderate wind velocity , the flow in the air is generally turbulent , and these small surface deformations , which we call _ wrinkles _ , are the imprints of the pressure and shear stress fluctuations at the surface .",
    "such wrinkles are also found at short time , before the onset of waves , in direct numerical simulations of temporally growing waves  @xcite .",
    "this noisy state below the wave onset may explain the substantial scatter in the velocity threshold reported in the literature .    in spite of their ubiquity in experiments ,",
    "the properties of these wrinkles below the wave onset have not been quantified so far , because of their very small amplitude ( typically 1 - 10@xmath9 m ) well below the resolution of classical one - point measurement devices , and their high sensitivity to mechanical vibrations of the experimental setup  @xcite .",
    "the first quantitative analysis of these wrinkles below the wave onset was provided by paquier _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite , in the case of a liquid thirty times more viscous than water .",
    "taking advantage of the excellent vertical resolution of the optical method free - surface synthetic schlieren ( fs - ss )  @xcite , a spatio - temporal analysis of these wrinkles was performed , and the transition between these wrinkles and the well - defined waves with crest perpendicular to the wind direction was characterized in detail .",
    "the amplitude of the wrinkles was found to be essentially independent of the fetch ( the distance upon which the air blows on the liquid ) , and to increase approximately linearly with wind velocity .",
    "although we naturally expect a weaker imprint of the applied stress fluctuations on the surface of a more viscous liquid , the scaling of the wrinkles amplitude with viscosity is not known to date .    in this paper , we explore systematically the influence of the liquid viscosity on the main properties of the surface deformations generated by a turbulent boundary layer in the air , both below and above the wave generation threshold .",
    "the aim is to extend over a wide range of viscosities ( @xmath10  m@xmath4  s@xmath5 ) the results of paquier _ et al . _",
    "@xcite obtained for a single viscosity ( @xmath11  m@xmath4  s@xmath5 ) , in order to gain insight into the physical mechanisms governing the dynamics of the wrinkles and the transition to the regular wave regime .",
    "we observe that the characteristic amplitude of the wrinkles scales as @xmath12 , where @xmath1 is the friction velocity , and that the critical velocity for wave generation slowly increases as @xmath2 over almost all the range of viscosities , from @xmath13  m@xmath4  s@xmath5 ( water ) to approximately @xmath14  m@xmath4  s@xmath5 . at larger viscosity ,",
    "the nature of the wave transition is found to evolve towards a new regime , characterized by a slow , nearly periodic emission of large - amplitude isolated fluid bumps .",
    "the experimental set - up , sketched in fig .",
    "[ fig : system ] , is the same as in paquier",

    "@xcite and is only briefly described here .",
    "it is composed of a fully transparent plexiglas rectangular tank , fitted to the bottom of a horizontal channel of rectangular cross - section .",
    "the tank is of length @xmath15  m , width @xmath16  mm , and depth @xmath17  mm and the channel height is @xmath18  mm , with its width identical to that of the tank . the tank is filled with liquid mixtures of different viscosities , such that the surface of the liquid precisely coincides with the bottom of the wind tunnel .",
    "air is injected upstream at a mean velocity @xmath19 that can be adjusted in the range @xmath20  .",
    "we define the coordinate axes @xmath21 in the streamwise , spanwise and upwards vertical direction , respectively .",
    "the origin ( 0,0,0 ) is located at the free surface at @xmath22 at mid - distance between the lateral walls of the channel . in accordance with the literature",
    ", the term _ fetch _ refers to the distance over which the wind blows ( in our case , the distance @xmath23 from the beginning of the tank ) .",
    "the surface deformation of the liquid is measured using the fs - ss method  @xcite .",
    "a random dot pattern is located under the tank and is imaged through the interface by a fast camera . comparing the refracted image of the pattern to a reference image taken when the interface is flat ( in absence of wind )",
    ", the fs - ss allows to obtain the height field @xmath24 .",
    "the acquisitions are performed over a field of view elongated in the @xmath23 direction , of dimensions @xmath25  mm , with horizontal resolution of 3  mm .",
    "the resolution in @xmath26 , controlled by the surface - pattern distance ( chosen between 6 and 29  cm ) , is of order of 1  @xmath27 m for the smaller wave amplitudes , in the wrinkle regime .    in order to investigate the influence of viscosity on wind wave generation",
    ", the kinematic viscosity @xmath28 of the liquid is changed from @xmath29 to @xmath30  m@xmath4  s@xmath5 , using differently concentrated mixtures of glycerol and water or glucor 60/80hm ( a glucose syrup referred later simply as glucor ) and water .",
    "glycerol - water mixtures are used for viscosity up to about @xmath31  m@xmath4  s@xmath5 and glucor - water mixtures for higher viscosity .",
    "indeed , due to the hygroscopic nature of glycerol  @xcite and the rapid evolution of the viscosity of a glycerol - water solution with concentration and temperature  @xcite , we had to switch to glucor , much more stable in time at high concentration in water .",
    "contrary to their kinematic viscosity , the density of the different mixtures does not change much , from 1.0 to @xmath32 kg  m@xmath33 .",
    "the kinematic viscosity of the glycerol - water mixtures are taken from the tables for the actual values of @xmath34 and @xmath35 while the kinematic viscosity of the glucor - water mixtures is measured by a rheometer anton paar physica mcr 501 .",
    "the temperature is controlled over the duration of an experiment to @xmath36c .",
    "more details on the parameters of each experiment are given in ref .",
    "@xcite .    in the wide range of liquid viscosities covered here ,",
    "the wave behavior ranges from essentially inviscid to strongly damped . according to leblond and mainardi  @xcite ,",
    "the attenuation length of a typical wavelength @xmath37  mm is about 2  m for water ( i.e. , the waves are essentially undamped over the size of the tank ) and decreases down to 8  mm for the most viscous liquid used here . on the other hand ,",
    "the influence of viscosity on the frequency ( and hence on the phase velocity ) is less pronounced : for this typical wavelength the frequency is essentially given by the inviscid prediction up to @xmath38  m@xmath4  s@xmath5 , and is decreased by 40% for the most viscous liquid used here .",
    "the cut - off wavelength , below which waves are over - damped and can not propagate , is significantly smaller than the typical wavelengths observed over much of the viscosity range , and is not expected to influence the results ; this cut - off becomes however significant ( @xmath39  mm ) for the most viscous liquid , so its influence on the wave propagation may be visible .",
    "an important aspect of this setup is the presence of a steady recirculation flow in the liquid induced by the mean wind shear stress at the surface . at sufficiently large liquid viscosity , this flow is essentially laminar , and is well described by the couette - poiseuille solution far from the side and end walls of the tank : the mean velocity profile , measured for @xmath11  m@xmath4  s@xmath5 in ref .",
    "@xcite , follows the expected parabolic law , @xmath40 for @xmath41 , where @xmath42 is the surface drift velocity resulting from the wind shear stress .",
    "this velocity profile is nearly homogeneous in @xmath23 and @xmath43 except at very small fetch ( on a distance of the order of the liquid height ) and over the last 30  cm of the tank ( where surface contamination can not be avoided ) .",
    "the surface drift @xmath44 remains small in our experiments : for @xmath45  , in the wrinkle regime , @xmath44 is smaller than 5  cm  s@xmath5 for @xmath46  m@xmath4  s@xmath5 , resulting in a reynolds number @xmath47 smaller than 1000 , for which the couette - poiseuille flow is expected to remain stable  @xcite .",
    "this stability is not guaranteed however at lower viscosity , in particular in the case of water , for which @xmath48 reaches @xmath49 .",
    "finally , we assume that the velocity profile in the air , characterized in detail for @xmath11  m@xmath4  s@xmath5 in ref .",
    "@xcite , is not significantly affected by the change of liquid viscosity . the boundary layer , which is tripped using sandpaper located at @xmath50  mm , is already turbulent when it reaches the liquid at @xmath22 .",
    "it remains similar to that of a classical turbulent boundary layer developing over a no - slip flat wall , at least in the wrinkle regime , because the surface drift velocity @xmath44 is comfortably smaller than @xmath19 , and also because the amplitude of the wrinkles remains much smaller than the thickness of the viscous sublayer ( @xmath51  mm , with @xmath52 the kinematic viscosity of the air and @xmath1 the friction velocity , discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : wr ] ) .",
    "we can therefore assume that the dependence on viscosity of the shape and amplitude of the surface deformations , at least in the wrinkle regime , is essentially governed by the liquid response to an otherwise ( statistically ) identical turbulent air flow .",

    "figure  [ fig : fsss_different_visc ] shows snapshots of the surface deformation for increasing liquid viscosities , from @xmath13 up to @xmath56  m@xmath4  s@xmath5 , below and just above the ( viscosity - dependent ) wave onset velocity . in this range of viscosities , the surface deformation fields are qualitatively similar to that reported in ref .",
    "@xcite for @xmath11  m@xmath4  s@xmath5 : at low wind velocity , below the wave onset ( left column , fig .",
    "[ fig : fsss_different_visc ] ( a - e ) ) , the surface field is composed of disorganized wrinkles , elongated in the streamwise direction , of amplitude essentially independent of @xmath23 .",
    "as expected , the wrinkles amplitude decreases as the liquid viscosity is increased , typically from 20 to 2  @xmath27 m . at larger wind velocity , above the wave onset ( right column , fig .",
    "[ fig : fsss_different_visc ] ( f - j ) ) , the surface field shows spatially growing waves with crests nearly perpendicular to the wind direction . at small viscosity , in particular for water , these regular waves coexist with the wrinkles , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : fsss_different_visc](f ) at small fetch , resulting in a mixed wave pattern near the onset .",
    "as the viscosity is increased , the amplitude of the wrinkles decreases and the transition to the regular wave regime becomes more visible .",
    "this general picture holds for fluid viscosity up to @xmath57  m@xmath4  s@xmath5 . at larger viscosity , the wrinkle regime is qualitatively similar , but the transition to the regular wave regime as the wind velocity increases is hindered by the emergence of a new phenomenon , which we call _ solitary waves _ , characterized by the slow , nearly periodic formation of large amplitude isolated fluid bumps pushed by the wind .",
    "figure  [ fig : solitarywave ] shows a picture of such solitary wave ; the associated slopes are far above the limit for fs - ss surface reconstruction and the fs - ss technique is no longer applicable .",
    "solitary waves are typically 5  mm high , 2 - 3 cm wide in the @xmath23 direction , with a steep rear and a weaker slope at the front .",
    "similar rear - front asymmetry is also found in waves in viscous liquids with strong lateral confinement  @xcite .",
    "this third regime , which overlaps with the regular wave regime , apparently corresponds to a distinct physical process : for identical viscosity and wind velocity , the typical distance between solitary waves is at least 4 times larger than the wavelength of regular waves , and their propagation velocity twice smaller .",
    "their finite amplitude even very close to the onset suggests a subcritical mechanism for their formation .",

    "we define the correlation length @xmath61 in the direction @xmath62 ( @xmath63 ) as 6 times the first value of @xmath64 satisfying @xmath65 .",
    "this definition is chosen such that @xmath61 coincides with the wavelength for a monochromatic wave propagating in the direction @xmath62 .",
    "although wrinkles do not have a well - defined wavelength , @xmath66 and @xmath67 provide estimates for their characteristic dimensions in the streamwise and spanwise directions .",
    "the correlation lengths , plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : correlation_lengths_vs_nu ] , are remarkably constant over the whole range of liquid viscosity , with average values @xmath68  200  mm and @xmath69  75  mm .",
    "these values are obtained for a wind velocity @xmath70  , but other velocities in the wrinkle regime yield similar results .",
    "this suggests that the characteristic size of the wrinkles is not a property of the flow in the liquid , but is rather geometrically constrained by the thickness of the turbulent boundary layer in the air .",
    "this thickness , as measured by @xmath71 ( the distance at which the mean velocity is @xmath72 , see fig .  [",
    "fig : system ] ) , is of order of 15 - 20  mm at small fetch  @xcite .",
    "such aspect ratio @xmath73 is indeed typical of large - scale streamwise vortices in turbulent boundary layers  @xcite , confirming that the wrinkles can be viewed as the traces of the stress fluctuations traveling in the air flow .",

    "for all but the highest viscosity , the correlation lengths are taken at a wind velocity @xmath76  ( filled symbols ) . for the highest viscosity , @xmath77 is dominated by the background noise @xmath78 at this wind velocity , so the data at the smallest available velocity in the wrinkles regime ( @xmath79  ) is used instead ( open symbols ) .",

    "inversely , wrinkles can not either correspond to a purely creeping flow forced by the stress fluctuations : if only @xmath1 , @xmath28 and the size of the pressure fluctuations were relevant parameters , dimensional analysis would require @xmath77 to be a function of @xmath136 , which again contradicts our observations . a minimum model for the wrinkles amplitude should therefore contain both gravity and viscosity effects .",
    "in a statistically steady state , we can assume a balance between the energy loss in the wrinkles by viscous diffusion and the vertical energy flux from the turbulent fluctuations .",
    "since the size of the wrinkles is significantly larger than the capillary length @xmath137  mm ( one has @xmath138 , see fig .",
    "[ fig : correlation_lengths_vs_nu ] ) , we can neglect the surface tension and simply write the energy ( potential and kinetic ) per unit surface of the wrinkles as @xmath139 .",
    "its rate of change by viscous diffusion can be estimated as @xmath140 , assuming that the viscous time scale is governed by the smallest extent of the wrinkle , in the spanwise direction ( the thickness of the boundary layer @xmath71 , which governs the size of the wrinkles , could be used instead ; see sec .",
    "[ sec : wr ] ) . the vertical energy flux from the turbulent boundary layer to the liquid surface can be estimated as the work per unit time of the stress fluctuations , of order @xmath130 , with characteristic vertical velocity fluctuations above the viscous sublayer of order @xmath1 . balancing this energy flux @xmath141 with the energy loss @xmath140 yields @xmath142 where @xmath143 is a non - dimensional constant , which is consistent with the observed scaling ( [ eq : zrma_over_ufpower15 ] ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : k_vs_uf ] , where the numerical factor @xmath143 is plotted for the range of velocities for which the power law @xmath144 holds , shows a fairly good collapse of the data around the average value @xmath145 .",
    "the main discrepancy to this law corresponds to the experiments performed with water , which again show significantly smaller wrinkles amplitude .",
    "the reason for this discrepancy might be that , at low viscosity , a significant amount of the turbulent energy flux is transferred to the surface drift current , resulting in weaker surface deformations @xcite . flow instabilities induced by the turbulent stress fluctuations may also yield extra dissipation in the liquid , and hence weaker surface deformations .     in eq .",
    "( [ eq : model ] ) , representing the normalized wrinkles amplitude , as a function of the friction velocity for different liquid viscosities ( same symbols as in fig .",
    "[ fig : rms_fits_uf ] ) .",
    "the dashed line corresponds to the average @xmath146.,width=377 ]    interestingly , a scaling similar to eq .",
    "( [ eq : model ] ) can be obtained by modifying the theory of phillips  @xcite to include the effects of the liquid viscosity .",
    "assuming an inviscid liquid , phillips derives the amplitude of the surface deformations generated by a statistically steady turbulent airflow applied over the surface during a time @xmath147 , @xmath148 where @xmath149 is the characteristic convection velocity of the pressure fluctuations .",
    "we can include qualitatively the effect of the liquid viscosity in his analysis , by assuming that the temporal growth in eq .",
    "( [ eq : phil ] ) saturates on a viscous time scale @xmath150 . with this assumption , and taking @xmath151 , eq .",
    "( [ eq : phil ] ) yields a scaling also consistent with the observed behavior @xmath129 .",
    "in this paper , we study experimentally the influence of the liquid viscosity on the early stages of wind wave generation .",
    "most of the results of paquier _ et al . _",
    "@xcite obtained for a single viscosity , in particular the existence of two regimes of surface deformation , the wrinkles regime and the wave regime , are extended here over a wide range of viscosities .    for all viscosities ,",
    "the surface below the wave onset is populated by disorganized elongated wrinkles whose characteristic amplitude scales as @xmath12 , which correspond to the trace of the turbulent stress fluctuations at the surface .",
    "a simple model based on an energy balance between the turbulent energy flux and the viscous dissipation in the liquid is proposed to account for this scaling .",
    "the critical velocity for wave onset is found to slowly increase as @xmath152 over nearly two decades of viscosity , in accordance with data from the literature .",
    "whereas the transition from wrinkles to waves is abrupt at large viscosity , it is much smoother at low viscosity , in particular for water . interestingly ,",
    "this smooth transition may explain , at least in part , the large scatter in the critical wave onset velocity reported in the literature for water waves .    finally , a new regime is found in highly viscous liquids ( @xmath3  m@xmath4  s@xmath5 ) : at sufficiently high wind velocity , in addition to the regular wave regime , a solitary wave regime appears , characterized by slow , nearly periodic formation of large - amplitude localized fluid bumps .",
    "this highly nonlinear regime could not be characterized with the present fs - ss measurements , limited to small wave slope and curvature , and warrants further investigation .",
