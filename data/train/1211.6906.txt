    "<S> proton - neutron , neutron - neutron and proton - proton momentum correlation functions ( @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 ) are systematically investigated for @xmath3c and other c isotopes induced collisions at different entrance channel conditions within the framework of the isospin - dependent quantum molecular dynamics ( idqmd ) model complemented by the crab ( correlation after burner ) computation code . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath3c is a prime exotic nucleus candidate due to the weakly bound valence neutron coupling with closed - neutron shell nucleus @xmath4c . in order to study density dependence of correlation function by removing the isospin effect , </S>",
    "<S> the initialized @xmath3c projectiles are sampled from two kinds of density distribution from rmf model , in which the valence neutron of @xmath3c is populated on both 1@xmath55/2 and 2@xmath61/2 states , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the results show that the density distributions of valence neutron significantly influence nucleon - nucleon momentum correlation function at large impact parameter and high incident energy . </S>",
    "<S> the extended density distribution of valence neutron largely weakens the strength of correlation function . </S>",
    "<S> the size of emission source is extracted by fitting correlation function using gaussian source method . </S>",
    "<S> the emission source size as well as the size of final state phase space is larger for projectiles sampling from more extended density distribution of valence neutron corresponding 2@xmath61/2 state in rmf model . </S>",
    "<S> therefore momentum correlation function can be considered as a potential valuable tool to diagnose the exotic nuclear structure such as skin and halo .    </S>"
