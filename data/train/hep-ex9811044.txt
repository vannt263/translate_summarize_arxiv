    "this bi - annual series of workshops is an outstanding opportunity to focus on the enormous breadth and depth of fundamental physics accessible from the study of the production and decay of the tau lepton and the tau neutrino . at each meeting ,",
    "we have seen tremendous progress in the precision with which standard model physics is measured , and increasing sensitivity to new physics ; and this meeting , fifth in the series , is no exception . tau physics continues to be wonderfully rich and deep !",
    "the study of the tau contributes to the field of particle physics in many ways .",
    "i think of the `` sub - fields '' as follows :    * precision electroweak physics : neutral current ( @xmath0 ) and charged current ( @xmath1 ) couplings , michel parameters , leptonic branching fractions and tests of universality .",
    "these measurements typically have world - average errors better than 1% .",
    "they give indirect information on new physics at high mass scales ( @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 , ) .",
    "the higher the precision , the better chance of seeing the effects of new physics , so continued improvement is necessary .",
    "* very rare ( `` upper limit '' ) physics : direct searches for new physics , such as processes forbidden in the standard model : lepton - flavor - violating neutrinoless decays , lepton - number - violating decays such as @xmath5 , and cp - violating effects that can result from anomalous weak and electromagnetic dipole moments . *",
    "non - perturbative hadronic physics : our inability to reliably predict the properties and dynamics of light mesons and baryons at intermediate energies is the greatest failing of particle physics .",
    "tau decays provide a clean beam of intermediate energy light mesons , including vectors , axial - vectors , scalars and tensors .",
    "one can measure mesonic couplings , and tune models of resonances and lorentz structure .",
    "topics of current interest are the presence and properties of radial excitations such as the @xmath6 , and @xmath7 , mixing , su(3)@xmath8 violation , and isospin decomposition of multihadronic final states . *",
    "inclusive qcd physics : the total and differential inclusive rate for tau decays to hadrons ( spectral functions ) , can be used to measure @xmath9 , non - perturbative quark and gluon condensates , and quark masses ; and can be used to test qcd sum rules . here ,",
    "in particular , there is a rich interaction between theory and experiment .",
    "* neutrino mass and mixing physics : aside from its fundamental significance , the presence of tau neutrino mass and mixing has important implications for cosmology and astrophysics @xmath10 it is our window on the universe .",
    "the study of taus is thus an important tool in many fields , and continual progress is being made in all of them , as evidenced in the many contributions to this workshop which i review in the following sections .",
    "some of the more exciting future goals in tau physics were discussed in the first talk of the workshop , by martin perl @xcite .",
    "this was followed by a very comprehensive overview of the theory of tau physics , including future prospects for testing the theory , by j.  kuhn @xcite .",
    "these talks are reviews in and of themselves ; i will focus , in this review , on the subsequent presentations .",
    "sld and the four lep experiments study the reaction @xmath12 to extract a wealth of information on rates and asymmetries , and ultimately , on the neutral current vector and axial couplings @xmath13 and @xmath14 for each fermion species @xmath15 , and from these , values for the effective weak mixing angle @xmath16 .",
    "lepton universality is the statement that these couplings ( and the charged current couplings to be discussed later ) are the same for the electron , muon and tau leptons .",
    "the simplest such observable is the partial width of the @xmath0 into fermion pairs , which to lowest order is : @xmath17 equivalently , the ratio of the total hadronic to leptonic width @xmath18 , with @xmath19 , can be measured with high precion .",
    "the angular distribution of the outgoing fermions exhibit a parity - violating forward - backward asymmetry @xmath20 which permits the measurement of the asymmetry parameters @xmath21 from these one can extract the neutral current couplings @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "the standard model predicts that the outgoing fermions from @xmath0 decay are polarized , with a polarization that depends on the scattering angle @xmath22 with respect to the incoming electron or positron : @xmath23 if the incoming electron beam is also polarized , as at the slc , it further modifies the polarization of the outgoing fermions . in the case of the tau ( @xmath24 ) , this polarization can be measured at the statistical level by analyzing the decay products of the tau , providing an independent way to determine @xmath25 and thus @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "lep and sld have used almost all of the major tau decay modes ( @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 ) to analyze the tau spin polarization as a function of @xmath33 .",
    "sld has measured the dependence of these polarizations on beam ( @xmath34 ) polarization .",
    "sld and all four lep experiments measure all these quantities . at tau 98 , the results for the ratios of partial widths @xmath35 and forward - backward asymmetries @xmath36 for @xmath19 are reviewed in @xcite and shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : rl_afb ] .",
    "the tau polarization measurements at lep are presented in @xcite . the beam polarization dependent asymmetries at sld are described in @xcite , and shown in fig .  [ fig : sld ] . the procedure for combining the lep results on @xmath37",
    "is reviewed in @xcite , in which it is concluded that the results from the four lep experiments are consistent but not too consistent .",
    "these are nearly the final results from lep on this subject .",
    "note that lep and sld have completely consistent results on the leptonic neutral current couplings ; the addition of measurements of the heavy quark couplings to their standard model averages for the weinberg angle @xmath38 pull the lep average away from that of sld s ( and that discrepancy is shrinking as lep and sld results are updated ) .",
    "the partial widths for the three charged leptons agree with one another ( and therefore with lepton universality in the neutral current ) to 3 ppm .",
    "these results , along with those from the @xmath39 and @xmath40 final states , fit well to the standard model predictions with a rather light higgs mass : @xmath41 gev / c@xmath42 at 95%  c.l .",
    "the results for the vector and axial couplings of the three leptons is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : gvga ] .",
    "note that the tau pair contour is smaller than that for mu pairs , because of the added information from tau polarization .",
    "this tau workshop is the first to see results from lep - ii , including new results on the production of taus from real @xmath44 decays .",
    "all four lep experiments identify the leptonic decays of @xmath44 bosons from @xmath45 at center - of - mass energies from 160 to 189 gev .",
    "the results are consistent between experiments ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : wbrlep ] ) and the averaged branching fractions they obtain are summarized in @xcite : @xmath46 where the last result assumes universality of the charged current couplings .",
    "these results , and results on the measured cross - sections for @xmath47 as a function of center - of - mass energy , are in good agreement with standard model predictions .",
    "lepton universality from real @xmath44 decays is tested at the 4%  level at lep : @xmath48 , @xmath49 .",

    "the lep and tevatron results are to be compared with the ratios of couplings to virtual @xmath44 bosons in @xmath52 decays , summarized in the next section .",
    "cdf has also looked for taus produced from decays of top quarks , charged higgs bosons , leptoquarks , and techni - rhos .",
    "limits on these processes are reviewed in @xcite . for the charged higgs searches",
    ", they are shown in fig .",

    "the primary properties of the tau lepton are its mass , spin , and lifetime . that its spin is 1/2 is well established , and its mass is well measured @xcite : @xmath53 gev / c@xmath42 .",
    "the world average tau lifetime has changed considerably in the last 10 years , but recent results have been in good agreement , converging to a value that is stable and of high precision .    at tau 98 , new measurements were presented from l3 @xcite and delphi .",
    "the new world average tau lifetime represents the work of 6 experiments ( shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : taulife ] ) , each utilizing multiple techniques , and each with @xmath54 precision .",
    "the result is presented in @xcite : @xmath55 fs .",
    "we now turn to the decays of the tau .",
    "the leptonic decays of the tau comprise 35%  of the total , and can be both measured and predicted with high accuracy . in the standard model , @xmath56 here , @xmath15 is a known function of the masses , @xmath57 for @xmath58 and 0.9726 for @xmath59 ; @xmath60 is a small correction of @xmath61 due to electromagnetic and weak effects , and @xmath62 defines the couplings : @xmath63 by comparing the measured leptonic branching fractions to each other and to the decay rate of the muon to @xmath58 , we can compare the couplings of the leptons to the weak charged current , @xmath64 , @xmath65 , and @xmath66 .    at tau 98 , new measurements on leptonic branching fractions",
    "were presented by delphi @xcite , l3 and opal @xcite .",
    "the results are summarized in @xcite : @xmath67 these new world average branching fractions have an accuracy of 3 ppm , and are thus beginning to probe the corrections contained in @xmath60 , above .",
    "the resulting ratios of couplings are consistent with unity ( lepton universality in the charged current couplings ) to 2.5 ppm : @xmath68 some of the consequences of these precision measurements are reviewed in @xcite .",
    "the michel parameter @xmath69 ( see next section ) is constrained to be near zero to within 2.2% .",
    "one can extract a limit on the tau neutrino mass ( which , if non - zero , would cause the function @xmath15 defined above to depart from its standard model value ) of 38 mev , at 95%  c.l .",
    "one can also extract limits on mixing of the tau neutrino to a 4@xmath70 generation ( very massive ) neutrino , and on anomalous couplings of the tau .",
    "one can even measure fundamental properties of the strong interaction through precision measurement of these purely leptonic decays .",
    "the total branching fraction of the tau to hadrons is assumed to be @xmath71 .",
    "this inclusive rate for semi - hadronic decays can be formulated within qcd : @xmath72 where @xmath73 and @xmath74 are cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) matrix elements , and @xmath75 is a small and calculable electroweak correction .",
    "the strong interaction between the final state quarks are described by @xmath76 , the prediction from perturbative qcd due to radiation of hard gluons , expressible as a perturbation expansion in the strong coupling constant @xmath77 , and @xmath78 , which describes non - perturbative effects in terms of incalculable expectation values of quark and gluon operators ( condensates ) .",
    "the value of @xmath78 is estimated to be small , and values for these expectation values can be extracted from experimental measurements of the spectral functions in semi - hadronic decays ( see section  [ s - spectral ] ) .",
    "the extraction of @xmath77 from @xmath79 depends on an accurate estimate of @xmath78 and on a convergent series for @xmath80 .",
    "recent improvements in the techniques for calculating this series ( `` contour - improved perturbation theory '' , cipt ) and extrapolating to the @xmath0 mass scale , are reviewed in  @xcite .",
    "the resulting values of @xmath81 evaluated at the tau mass scale , and then run up to the @xmath0 mass scale , are : @xmath82 we will return to this subject in section [ s - spectral ] .",
    "the dynamics of the leptonic decays @xmath83 are fully determined in the standard model , where the decay is mediated by the @xmath84 charged current left - handed @xmath85 boson . in many extensions to the standard model",
    ", additional interactions can modify the lorentz structure of the couplings , and thus the dynamics .",
    "in particular , there can be weak couplings to scalar currents ( such as those mediated by the charged higgs of the minimal supersymmetric extensions to the standard model , mssm ) , or small deviations from maximal parity violation such as those mediated by a right - handed @xmath3 of left - right symmetric extensions .",
    "the effective lagrangian for the 4-fermion interaction between @xmath86 can be generalized to include such interactions .",
    "michel and others in the 1950 s assumed the most general , lorentz invariant , local , derivative free , lepton number conserving , 4 fermion point interaction .    integrating over the two unobserved neutrinos , they described the differential distribution for the daughter charged lepton ( @xmath87 ) momentum relative to the parent lepton ( @xmath29 or @xmath52 ) spin direction , in terms of the so - called michel parameters : @xmath88 \\\\     & & \\propto   x^2\\left [ i(x\\vert { \\rho , \\eta } )             \\pm { p_\\tau } a ( x , { \\theta } \\vert              { \\xi , \\delta } ) \\right],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath31 and @xmath69 are the spectral shape michel parameters and @xmath89 and @xmath60 are the spin - dependent michel parameters  @xcite ; @xmath90 is the daughter charged lepton energy scaled to the maximum energy @xmath91 in the @xmath52 rest frame ; @xmath92 is the angle between the tau spin direction and the daughter charged lepton momentum in the @xmath52 rest frame ; and @xmath93 is the polarization of the @xmath52 . in the standard model ( sm ) ,",
    "the michel parameters have the values @xmath94 , @xmath95 , @xmath96 and @xmath97 .",
    "there are non - trivial extensions to this approach . in susy models",
    ", taus can decay into scalar neutralinos instead of fermionic neutrinos .",
    "these presumably are massive , affecting the phase space for the decay as well as the lorentz structure of the dynamics .",
    "in addition , there exists a non - trivial extension to the michel formalism that admits anomalous interactions with a tensor leptonic current that includes derivatives ; see @xcite for details .",
    "such interactions will produce distortions of the daughter charged lepton spectrum which can not be described with the michel parameters .",
    "delphi has used both leptonic and semihadronic decays to measure the tensor coupling @xmath98 , with the result @xmath99 ( consistent with zero ) .",
    "there are new or updated results on michel parameter measurements for tau 98 from aleph , opal , delphi , and cleo @xcite .",
    "the world averages , summarized in @xcite , also include results from argus , l3 , and sld .",
    "all results are consistent with the standard model , revealing no evidence for departures from the @xmath84 theory .",
    "these measurements have now reached rather high precision , but they are still not competitive with the precision on michel parameters obtained from muon decay , @xmath100 .",
    "results from the two decays @xmath101 and @xmath102 can be combined under the assumption of @xmath103 universality .",
    "such an assumption is clearly not called for when one is searching for new physics that explicitly violates lepton universality , such as charged higgs interactions , which couple to the fermions according to their mass",
    ". however , such couplings mainly affect the michel parameter @xmath69 , and it is clear from the michel formula above that @xmath69 is very difficult to measure in @xmath101 , since it involves a chirality flip of the daughter lepton , which is suppressed for the light electron .",
    "thus , lepton universality is usually invoked to constrain the @xmath31 , @xmath89 , and @xmath104 parameters to be the same for the two decays .",
    "since the measurements of @xmath31 and @xmath69 in @xmath102 decays are strongly correlated , the constraint that @xmath105 significantly improves the errors on @xmath106 . invoking universality in this sense , the world averages for the four michel parameters @xcite , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : michwa ] , are : @xmath107    a measurement of the spin - dependent michel parameters allows one to distinguish the standard model @xmath84 interaction ( left - handed @xmath108 ) from @xmath109 ( right - handed @xmath108 ) . the probability that a right - handed ( massless ) tau neutrino participates in the decay can be expressed as @xmath110,\\ ] ] and @xmath111 for the sm @xmath84 interaction .",
    "the michel parameters measured in all experiments provide strong constraints on right - handed @xmath112 couplings , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : michcoup ] .",
    "however , they are unable to distinguish left - handed @xmath113 couplings , for example , between scalar , vector , and tensor currents , without some additional information , such as a measurement of the cross - section @xmath114 .    in the minimal supersymmetric extension to the standard model ( mssm ) , a charged higgs boson will contribute to the decay of the tau ( especially for large mixing angle @xmath115 ) , interfering with the left - handed @xmath116 diagram , and producing a non - zero value for @xmath69 .",
    "since the world average value of @xmath69 ( from spectral shapes and the indirect limit from @xmath117 ) is consistent with zero , one can limit the mass of a charged higgs boson to be @xcite : @xmath118 ( in gev / c@xmath42 ) at 95%  c.l . , which is competitive with direct searches only for @xmath119 .    in left - right symmetric models ,",
    "there are two sets of weak charged bosons @xmath120 and @xmath121 , which mix to form the observed `` light '' left - handed @xmath122 and a heavier ( hypothetical ) right - handed @xmath123 .",
    "the parameters in these models are @xmath124 (= 0 in the sm ) , and @xmath125 mixing angle , @xmath126 in the sm .",
    "the heavy right - handed @xmath123 will contribute to the decay of the tau , interfering with the left - handed @xmath116 diagram , and producing deviations from the standard model values for the michel parameters @xmath31 and @xmath89 .",
    "the limit on @xmath127 is obtained from a likelihood analysis @xcite which reveals a very weak minimum ( less than 1@xmath128 ) at around 250 gev , so that the 95%  c.l .",
    "limit on the mass of 214 gev ( for a wide range of mixing angles @xmath129 ) is actually slightly worse than it was at tau 96 .",
    "the limit from muon decay michel parameters is 549 gev .",
    "it is worth continuing to improve the precision on the tau michel parameters , to push the limits on charged higgs and right - handed @xmath44 s , and perhaps open a window on new physics at very high mass scales .",
    "one can look directly for physics beyond the standard model in tau decays by searching for decays which violate lepton flavor ( lf ) conservation or lepton number ( ln ) conservation .",
    "these two conservation laws are put into the standard model by hand , and are not known to be the result of some symmetry .",
    "the purported existence of neutrino mixing implies that lf is violated at some level , in the same sense as in the quark sector .",
    "four family theories , susy , superstrings , and many other classes of models also predict lf violation ( lfv ) .",
    "if lf is violated , decays such as @xmath130 become possible ; and in general , decays containing no neutrino daughters are possible ( neutrinoless decays ) . in theories such as guts , leptoquarks , ,",
    "a lepton can couple directly to a quark , producing final states where ln is violated ( lnv ) but @xmath131 ( baryon number minus lepton number ) is conserved . in most cases , lfv and lnv",
    "are accompanied by violation of lepton universality .",
    "examples of lepton flavor violating decays which have been searched for at cleo , argus , slc , and lep include : + @xmath132 , @xmath133 + @xmath134 , @xmath135 + @xmath136 , @xmath137 + where the @xmath138 s are pseudoscalar mesons . decays which violate lepton number but conserve @xmath131 include @xmath139 , where @xmath140 is some neutral , bosonic hadronic system .",
    "decays which violate lepton number and @xmath131 include : @xmath141 .",
    "a broad class of r - parity violating susy models which predict lfv or lnv through the exchange of lepton superpartners were reviewed at this conference , in @xcite .",
    "a different class of models containing heavy singlet neutrinos , which produce lfv , is discussed in @xcite . in many cases ,",
    "branching fractions for neutrinoless tau decay can be as high as @xmath142 while maintaining consistency with existing data from muon and tau decays .",
    "cleo has searched for 40 different neutrinoless decay modes @xcite , and has set upper limits on the branching fractions of @xmath143 few @xmath144 .",
    "a handful of modes that have not yet been studied by cleo , including those containing anti - protons , have been searched for by the mark ii and argus experiments , with branching fraction upper limits in the @xmath145 range .",
    "thus , the present limits are approaching levels where some model parameter space can be excluded .",
    "b - factories will push below @xmath142 ; it may be that the most important results coming from this new generation of `` rare @xmath52 decay experiments '' will be the observation of lepton flavor or lepton number violation .",
    "the minimal standard model contains no mechanism for cp violation in the lepton sector .",
    "three - family neutrino mixing can produce ( presumably extremely small ) violations of cp in analogy with the ckm quark sector .",
    "cp violation in tau production can occur if the tau has a non - zero electric dipole moment or weak electric dipole moment , implying that the tau is not a fundamental ( point - like ) object .",
    "although other studies of taus ( such as production cross section , michel parameters , ) are sensitive to tau substructure , `` null '' experiments such as the search for cp violating effects of such substructure can be exquisitely sensitive .",
    "i discuss searches for dipole moments in the next section .",
    "cp violation in tau decays can occur , for example , if a charged higgs with complex couplings ( which change sign under cp ) interferes with the dominant @xmath44-emission process : @xmath146 if the dominant process produces a phase shift ( for example , due to the @xmath147 , @xmath32 , or @xmath148 resonance ) , the interference will be of opposite sign for the @xmath149 and @xmath150 , producing a measurable cp violation .",
    "the effect is proportional to isospin - violation for decays such as @xmath151 @xmath152 ; and su(3)@xmath8 violation for decays such as @xmath153 , @xmath154 .",
    "the various signals for cp violation in tau decays are reviewed in @xcite .",
    "cleo has performed the first direct search for cp violation in tau decays @xcite , using the decay mode @xmath153 .",
    "the decay is mediated by the usual p - wave vector exchange , with a strong interaction phase shift provided by the @xmath148 resonance .",
    "cp violation occurs if there is interference with an s - wave scalar exchange , with a complex weak phase @xmath155 and a different strong interaction phase .",
    "the interference term is cp odd , so cleo searches for an asymmetry in a cp - odd angular observable between @xmath149 and @xmath150 .",
    "they see no evidence for cp violation , and set a limit on the imaginary part of the complex coupling of the tau to the charged higgs ( @xmath156 , in units of @xmath157 ) : @xmath158 .",
    "tests of cp violation in tau decays can also be made using @xmath159 and @xmath152 , and we can look forward to results from such analyses in the future .",
    "in the standard model , the tau couples to the photon and to the @xmath0 via a minimal prescription , with a single coupling constant and a purely vector coupling to the photon or purely @xmath160 coupling to the @xmath0 . more generally , the tau can couple to the neutral currents with @xmath161 dependent vector or tensor couplings .",
    "the most general lorentz - invariant form of the coupling of the tau to a photon of 4-momentum @xmath162 is obtained by replacing the usual @xmath163 with @xmath164 at @xmath165 , we interpret @xmath166 as the electric charge of the tau , @xmath167 as the anomalous magnetic moment , and @xmath168 , where @xmath169 is the electric dipole moment of the tau .    in the standard model , @xmath27 is non - zero due to radiative corrections , and has the value @xmath170 .",
    "the electric dipole moment @xmath169 is zero for pointlike fermions ; a non - zero value would violate @xmath138 , @xmath171 , and @xmath172 .",
    "analogous definitions can be made for the _ weak _ coupling form factors @xmath173 , @xmath174 , and @xmath175 , and for the weak static dipole moments @xmath176 and @xmath177 . in the standard model ,",
    "the weak dipole moments are expected to be small ( the weak electric dipole moment is tiny but non - zero due to cp violation in the ckm matrix ) : @xmath178 , and @xmath179 e@xmath180 cm .",
    "some extensions to the standard model predict vastly enhanced values for these moments : in the mssm , @xmath181 can be as large as @xmath182 and @xmath183 as large as a few @xmath184 . in composite models , these dipole moments can be larger still .",
    "the smallness of the standard model expectations leaves a large window for discovery of non - standard model couplings .    at the peak of the @xmath0 , the reactions @xmath185 are sensitive to the weak dipole moments , while the electromagnetic dipole moments can be measured at center of mass energies far below the @xmath0 ( as at cleo or bes ) , and/or through the study of final state photon radiation in @xmath186 .",
    "extensive new or updated results on searches for weak and electromagnetic dipole moments were presented at tau 98 . in all cases , however , no evidence for non - zero dipole moments or cp - violating couplings were seen , and upper limits on the dipole moments were several orders of magnitude larger than standard model expectations , and is even far from putting meaningful limits on extensions to the standard model .",
    "there is much room for improvement in both technique and statistical power , and , as in any search for very rare or forbidden phenomena , the potential payoffs justify the effort .",
    "an anomalously large weak magnetic dipole moment will produce a transverse spin polarization of taus from @xmath0 decay , leading to ( cp - conserving ) azimuthal asymmetries in the subsequent tau decays .",
    "the l3 experiment searched for these asymmetries using the decay modes @xmath187 and @xmath188 , and observed none @xcite .",
    "they measure values for the real and imaginary parts of the weak magnetic dipole moment which are consistent with zero , and set upper limits ( at 95%  c.l . ) : @xmath189 e@xmath180 cm .",
    "the aleph , delphi , and opal experiments search for cp violating processes induced by a non - zero weak electric dipole moment , by forming cp - odd observables from the 4-vectors of the incoming beam and outgoing taus , and the outgoing tau spin vectors .",

    "most or all of the decay modes of the tau @xmath193 are used to spin - analyze the taus .",

    ", they extract measurements of the real and imaginary parts of @xmath196 .",
    "the combined limits ( at 95%  c.l . ) @xcite are : latexmath:[\\ ] ] the spectral functions @xmath221 and @xmath222 represent the contributions of the vector and axial - vector hadronic currents coupling to the @xmath44 .",
    "the subscripts on these functions denote the spin @xmath223 of the hadronic system , and the superscript @xmath224 denotes states with net strangeness .",
    "the hadronization information contained in the spectral functions falls in the low - energy domain of strong interaction dynamics , and it can not be calculated in qcd .",
    "nonetheless , many useful relations between the spectral functions can be derived .",
    "for example , in the limit of exact @xmath225 symmetry , we have @xmath226 and @xmath227 .",
    "relations amongst the spectral functions depend on assumptions about how the @xmath228 symmetry is broken . the conserved vector current ( cvc ) hypothesis requires that @xmath229 , and that @xmath230 can be related to the total cross - section for @xmath39 annihilations into hadrons .",
    "several sum rules relate integrals of these spectral functions , as described below .    from arguments of parity and isospin , the final states containing an even number of pions",

    "in addition , one must use other data to estimate the contribution to @xmath278 from @xmath287 ; however , the contribution from @xmath288 dominates the value and the error .    using the vector spectral function @xmath286 measured by aleph , one obtains @xcite a value for @xmath278 with improved errors : @xmath289 .",
    "now the error is smaller than the contribution from @xmath281 , and the sensitivity of the forthcoming precision experimental result to new physics is greatly improved .",
    "however , the use of tau data to determine @xmath278 with high precision relies on cvc to 1% . is this a valid assumption ?      to test the validity of cvc at the per cent level , one can compare the new vepp - ii data on @xmath290 @xcite to data from tau decays ( from aleph , delphi , and cleo ) .",
    "when this is done , small discrepancies appear , both in individual channels ( @xmath235 and @xmath236 ) and in the total rate via the vector current .",

    "these comparisons are made in @xcite , where the data from vepp - ii are converted ( using cvc ) into predictions for the branching fractions of the tau into the analogous ( isospin - rotated ) final states : @xmath291 @xmath292 in addition , a comparison of the spectral function _ shape _ extracted from @xmath293 and that extracted from @xmath294 shows discrepancies at the few per cent level .",
