    "the non  forward bfkl equation at next  to  leading logarithmic ( nll ) accuracy ( @xmath17 terms ) will be significantly more complicated , with the conformal invariance being explicitly broken by the running of the coupling ( as it happens in the nll forward case  @xcite ) .",

    "we present a new approach to obtaining the solution to the non  forward bfkl equation to ll accuracy .",
    "the method of solution is based on the separation of different contributions to the bfkl kernel by a phase space slice . once this separation is performed it is possible to apply an iterative approach similar to the one presented in ref .",

    "the ll bfkl equation describing colour singlet exchange with a non  zero momentum transfer squared , @xmath19 , was originally calculated in ref .",

    "[ fig : bfklladder ] ) and we define @xmath24 .",
    "the driving term @xmath25 corresponds to a simple two gluon exchange .",
    "it is more convenient to rearrange the terms in this expression and , as the integration variable , to use the transverse momenta of the @xmath26channel gluons , @xmath27 , i.e. @xmath28 f_\\omega \\left({\\bf k}+{\\bf k}_a,{\\bf k}_b , { \\bf q}\\right ) \\right.\\nonumber\\\\ & & \\hspace{-1.2cm}\\left.-\\frac{1}{{\\bf k}^2 }   \\left(\\frac{{\\bf k}_a^2}{\\left({\\bf k}+{\\bf k}_a\\right)^2+{\\bf k}^2 } + \\frac{\\left({\\bf k}_a-{\\bf q}\\right)^2}{\\left({\\bf k}+{\\bf k}_a -{\\bf q}\\right)^2 + { \\bf k}^2 } \\right ) f_\\omega \\left({\\bf k}_a,{\\bf k}_b , { \\bf q}\\right)\\right\\}. \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] at this stage it is possible to separate the exchange terms form the s  channel contributions by introducing a phase space slicing parameter @xmath29 ( at nll it is useful to use dimensional regularisation to show the cancellation of infrared divergences , at ll this is not needed ) .",
    "it is also convenient to use the following approximation @xmath30 in all the results presented in this paper we have made sure this approximation is valid by checking that the four  point green s function is insensitive to the value of the slicing parameter for small values of @xmath29 .",
    "therefore , the non  forward bfkl equation for the green s function can be written in a very simple form : @xmath31 in order to write the equation in this way the following notation has been introduced : @xmath32 and @xmath33.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the latter expression corresponds to the regge trajectory in our regularisation . in the case of @xmath34 , the trajectory for the colour  octet exchange should be obtained , and indeed we find @xmath35 ~=~ - { \\bar \\alpha}_s \\ln{\\frac{{\\bf k}_a^2}{\\lambda^2}}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] moreover , the whole solution to the non  forward bfkl equation has the correct limit for @xmath36 as found in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the expression for the non  forward ll regge trajectory can be simplified if we make use of the forward limit in eq .",
    "( [ trajforw ] ) , i.e. @xmath37 the last integral is negligible when @xmath29 is small , and therefore the non  forward trajectory takes the simple form @xmath38 with these conventions we proceed in the next section to iterate eq .",
    "( [ simpleeqn ] ) to find the solution for the non  forward four  point gluon green s function .",
    "the non  forward ll bfkl green s function is the solution to the integral equation @xmath39 for @xmath40 .",
    "if this expression is iterated , the green s function can be expressed in terms of a kernel per iteration acting on the initial condition with a series of poles in the @xmath41 complex plane : @xmath42 each action of the kernel corresponds to an interaction between the reggeised gluons exchanged in the @xmath5channel , building up , in this way , the ll bfkl ladder .",
    "the poles are integrated over when going from the @xmath41plane to rapidity space using the mellin transform @xmath43 where y is the rapidity span of the bfkl ladder .",
    "this integration can be performed to finally obtain the solution of the non  forward ll bfkl equation for the four  point green s function as ( with @xmath44 y ) @xmath45 this solution has the correct forward limit of ref .",
    "@xcite when the momentum transfer tends to zero .",
    "we would like to stress again that this method of solution is directly applicable to the non  forward bfkl equation also at nll accuracy , with the difference that the introduction of the phase space slice is more conveniently performed in the language of dimensional regularisation .",
    "to study the dependence of the non  forward ll bfkl four  point gluon green s function on the transverse momentum scales we choose to integrate over all external angles and define the quantity @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the angle between the vectors @xmath48 and @xmath49 .    as a first analysis , in fig .",
    "[ 2 ] the value of @xmath50 is fixed to 5 gev and the dependence on @xmath51 is studied . when the value of the modulus of both momenta coincides , the angular integrated green s function shows a @xmath52functional behaviour corresponding to the two gluon exchange limit .",
    "this dependence is caused by the driving term of the integral equation whose influence is stronger for lower energies . when y is increased from 1 in fig .",
    "[ 2 ] to @xmath53 in fig .",
    "[ 3 ] the influence of the driving term diminishes as a consequence of a larger number of effective rungs in the bfkl ladder .",
    "it is interesting to note that the influence of the momentum transfer @xmath54 is larger in regions of low scales of @xmath55 .",
    "the general trend is that the four  gluon green s function decreases with increasing @xmath54 . comparing fig .",
    "[ 2 ] with fig .",
    "[ 3 ] it can be seen that this effect is increasing with rapidity .",
    "let us now proceed to the study of the diffusion of the transverse scales in the bfkl ladder with increasing rapidity span .",
    "we choose in this analysis to concentrate on the evolution of the transverse scale along the left hand side of the ladder depicted on fig .",
    "[ fig : bfklladder ] , but , as previously mentioned , one of the benefits of having the solution to the non  forward bfkl equation expressed in terms of explicit phase space integrals as in eq .",
    "( [ eq : nonf_soln ] ) is that it is possible to study any of the momenta in the ladder .",
    "diffusion is normally studied in terms of the mean of the transverse momentum along the ladder , with the width of the distribution indicated by the standard deviation ( see e.g.  ref .",
    "this choice is useful , since it allows analytic studies .",
    "however , a plot of the mean internal transverse momentum plus / minus the standard deviation as a function of the rapidity along the bfkl ladder fails , by construction , to display the different behaviour of diffusion to low and high scales . given the possibilities offered by the solution written in terms of explicit phase space integrals",
    ", we therefore choose to study diffusion in terms of the average value @xmath56 of @xmath57 as a function of the rapidity @xmath58 along the ladder .",
    "specifically , for a given value of @xmath59 , and y we solve the non  forward bfkl equation according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : nonf_soln ] ) by a montecarlo integration method . for each configuration point in @xmath60momenta phase space @xmath61 we can trace the evolution of @xmath62 along the ladder and , at the same time , calculate the weight of this configuration to the total solution . in this way it is possible to calculate both the average value of @xmath62 along the ladder , @xmath63 , and the quantities @xmath64 for a gluon green s function @xmath65 that is symmetric in @xmath62 , the lines of @xmath63 , @xmath66 , and @xmath67 would reproduce the plot of the mean plus / minus the standard deviation .",
    "this is true for @xmath68  gev , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : diff_q ] . here",
    "we have plotted the above mentioned three lines for @xmath69  gev , @xmath70  gev , @xmath68  gev , @xmath71 , and @xmath72 .",
    "@xmath58 is rescaled to lie between 0 and 1 , so as to plot all the three cases on the same figure .",
    "however , for @xmath73  gev the distribution of @xmath62 is no longer symmetric , as can be seen on the right hand side plot in fig .",
    "[ fig : diff_q ] , where we have plotted the same quantities for @xmath74  gev .",
    "it is apparent that there is less diffusion to smaller scales , the average is unchanged , and the diffusion to scales larger than the average is almost unchanged compared to the case @xmath68  gev .",
    "it is also apparent that for the set of parameters investigated here , there is no significant diffusion into regions where the coupling is expected to become unperturbatively large . as it is well known , the influence of softer scales is larger at higher energies , but in this work we confirm the fact that the diffusion into the infrared is drastically reduced when there is some momentum transfer , acting , in this way , as an efficient infrared cut  off",
    ". it will be interesting to investigate if this picture holds at nll .",
    "let us now turn to the study of diffractive cross  sections . to this end",
    "we need to define some suitable impact factors .",
    "we choose a generic example from ref.@xcite modelling the photo  production of a vector meson : @xmath75,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and similarly for @xmath76 . here , @xmath77 is a normalisation constant which we choose arbitrarily such that @xmath78 .",
    "this choice obviously means that the normalisation of the toy cross  section reported in this paper is completely arbitrary .",
    "we have plotted this impact factor divided by @xmath79 in fig .",
    "[ fig : imp_fac ] for @xmath68  gev and the mass of the meson @xmath80  gev .",
    "one further complication arises compared to studies of the four  point gluon green s function due to the integration over @xmath55 and @xmath81 when calculating the differential cross  section as in eq .",
    "( [ eq : xsec ] ) .",
    "the approximations of eqs .",
    "( [ approximation ] ) and  ( [ eq : trajappr ] ) are valid only when @xmath82 .",
    "when @xmath55 is integrated over it is therefore not possible to have @xmath29 fixed .",
    "this situation is similar to the one encountered in ref.@xcite .",
    "this problem can be solved in several different ways . in the present analysis",
    "we choose to always have @xmath83 and @xmath84  gev .",
    "we have checked that the results here presented do not depend on these choices .    on fig .",
    "[ fig : xsecvsdeltay ] we have plotted the resulting cross  section of eq .",
    "( [ eq : xsec ] ) as a function of the rapidity span of the bfkl ladder for @xmath85  gev , @xmath86 and @xmath80  gev . the exponential rise of the cross  section as a function of rapidity is evident for all @xmath54 . in the previous section",
    "we showed how the green s function diminishes as the momentum transfer rises , this translates here into smaller cross  sections .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : xsecvsq ] we have plotted the @xmath87dependence of the cross  section for rapidity spans of @xmath88 .",
    "we see an exponential fall  off with @xmath54 for all y. furthermore , we observe that @xmath89 at @xmath2  @xmath90 increases with y. the curves in fig .",
    "[ fig : xsecvsq ] are presented on a linear ( right ) and a logarithmic ( left ) scale .",
    "these results could have also been obtained using an analytic approach to solving the non  forward bfkl equation at ll accuracy .",
    "nevertheless it is when discussing diffusion properties that the method presented in this paper has advantages . for the analysis of diffusion in cross  sections , a second issue arises compared to the study of diffusion of the green s function .",
    "the perturbative scale is now set by both the meson mass @xmath91 and the momentum transfer squared @xmath6 , while the scales @xmath55 and @xmath81 are no longer fixed .",
    "it therefore becomes interesting to study not only the distribution of the average transverse scale @xmath56 along the ladder , but also at the ends of it , where it will describe the average scale of the transverse momentum connecting the impact factors to the gluon green s function .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : xsec_diff ] we have plotted the distribution of the average momentum scale in a similar way to the one used in fig .  [",
    "fig : diff_q ] for the green s function .",
    "it is interesting first to note that the spread along the chain is not significantly larger than that at the ends of the chain ( for the rapidity spans considered here ) .",
    "secondly , it is comforting to see that the typical scales remain perturbative for all values of the momentum transfer @xmath54 , for the chosen value of the mass of the vector meson ( @xmath80  gev ) .",
    "the average value of @xmath62 for @xmath68  gev ( @xmath92 ) corresponds to a scale of the internal momenta of the bfkl exchange of roughly 7  gev .",
    "the logarithmic scale of momenta on fig .",
    "[ fig : diff_q ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : xsec_diff ] emphasises the region of soft momenta",
    ". it might therefore be helpful to study the effect of the increase in scattering momenta on the internal scales directly : an increase of @xmath54 from 0  gev to 2  gev leads to and increase in the upper ( uv ) lines corresponding to an increase in the internal momenta of roughly 2.4  gev , while the increase in the lower ( ir ) lines corresponds to an increase of roughly 1.7  gev .",
    "we have presented a new solution to the non  forward bfkl equation at leading logarithmic accuracy that allows a study of diffusion properties directly in momentum space .",
    "we have investigated the behaviour of the gluon green s function as a function of transverse scales , including a study of the ir / uv diffusion .",
    "then we extended this study to the analysis of a toy cross  section .",
    "the presented framework is very efficient for solving bfkl evolution equations and the solution allows immediate insight into the momentum configurations of the evolution .",
    "we hope to extend the iterative method for solving the non  forward bfkl equation to next  to  leading logarithmic accuracy , once the appropriate integral kernel is calculated .",

    "<S> the solution to the non  forward bfkl equation in the leading logarithmic approximation is expressed in terms of a sum of iterations of its kernel directly in transverse momentum and rapidity space . </S>",
    "<S> several studies of the non  forward solution are performed both at the level of the gluon green s function and for a toy cross  section , including an analysis of the diffusion properties as found in this approach . </S>",
    "<S> the method developed in this paper allows for a direct inspection of the momenta in the bfkl ladder , and can be applied to solving the non  forward bfkl equation to next  to  leading logarithmic accuracy , when the corresponding kernel is available .    </S>",
