    "<S> while the existence of a spin - liquid ground state of the spin-1/2 kagome heisenberg antiferromagnet ( khaf ) is well established , the discussion of the effect of an interlayer coupling ( ilc ) by controlled theoretical approaches is still lacking . here we study this problem by using the coupled - cluster method to high orders of approximation . </S>",
    "<S> we consider a stacked khaf with a perpendicular ilc @xmath0 , where we study ferro- as well as antiferromagnetic @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the spin - liquid ground state ( gs ) persists until relatively large strengths of the ilc . </S>",
    "<S> only if the strength of the ilc exceeds about 15% of the intralayer coupling the spin - liquid phase gives way for @xmath1 magnetic long - range order , where the transition between both phases is continuous and the critical strength of the ilc , @xmath2 , is almost independent of the sign of @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , by contrast to the quantum gs selection of the strictly two - dimensional khaf at large spin @xmath3 , the ilc leads first to a selection of the @xmath1 gs . only at larger @xmath4 the ilc drives a first - order transition to the @xmath5 long - range ordered gs . as a result , </S>",
    "<S> the stacked spin-1/2 khaf exhibits a rich gs phase diagram with two continuous and two discontinuous transitions driven by the ilc .    _ </S>",
    "<S> introduction. _ the search for exotic quantum spin liquid ( qsl ) states and fractionalized quasiparticles in frustrated magnets attracts currently much attention both from the theoretical and experimental side . </S>",
    "<S> one of the most promising , fascinating , and , at same time , challenging problems is the investigation of the ground state ( gs ) of the quantum antiferromagnet on the kagome lattice . over the last 25 years </S>",
    "<S> a plethora of theoretical approaches has been applied to understand the gs properties of the spin-@xmath6 kagome antiferromagnet ( kafm ) , see , e.g. ,  refs .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> clearly , the gs of the @xmath7 heisenberg kafm does not exhibit gs magnetic long - range order ( lro ) . however , there is a long - standing debate on the nature of the quantum gs . </S>",
    "<S> recent large - scale numerical studies @xcite provide arguments for a gapped @xmath8 topological qsl for spin @xmath7 . however , the gap state is not fully proven , and also a gapless spin liquid is suggested , see , e.g. , refs .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> a natural question is that for the stability of the qsl phase against modifications of the paradigmatic pure @xmath7 kafm . </S>",
    "<S> several recent investigations have been focused on @xmath9 @xcite , anisotropic models @xcite as well as kafms with further - neighbor couplings @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it has been found that such modifications of the pure kafm may play a crucial role either to modify the qsl state or even to establish gs magnetic lro of @xmath10 or of @xmath1 symmetry . at </S>",
    "<S> that the input from experiments plays an important role to trigger the theoretical hunt for exotic quantum states @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> prominent examples for @xmath7 kagome compounds are herbertsmithite @xcite and kapellasite @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> both compounds do not show magnetic order down to very low temperatures @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , the underlying magnetic model is quite different . </S>",
    "<S> herbertsmithite is likely the best realization of a spin-@xmath6 heisenberg kafm with only nearest - neighbor ( nn ) exchange couplings . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> the model for kapellasite contains noticeable further - neighbor couplings @xmath11 along the diagonals of the hexagons @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> except the kagome compounds without magnetic order there are several kagome magnets which exhibit a phase transition to a long - range ordered state at a critical temperature @xmath12 . </S>",
    "<S> examples are edwardsite @xcite , barlowite @xcite or the family of kagome compounds cs@xmath13cu@xmath14mf@xmath15 ( m = zr , hf , sn ) @xcite . for an overview on the relation between extended models and kagome compounds </S>",
    "<S> we refer the interested reader to ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> bearing in mind the huge number of theoretical studies of purely two - dimensional ( 2d ) kagome models , see , e.g. ,  refs .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , the investigation of the role of interlayer coupling ( ilc ) @xmath16 so far has been widely ignored . </S>",
    "<S> the reason for that might be related to the fact that most of the controlled approaches with satisfactory accuracy , such as large - scale exact diagonalization , density matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) , or entanglement renormalization techniques are designed for low - dimensional quantum systems . </S>",
    "<S> thus , for example , for the three - dimensional ( 3d ) counterpart of the kafm , the quantum pyrochlore heisenberg antiferromagnet ( hafm ) , precise gs data are missing so far . to the best of our knowledge </S>",
    "<S> the stacked kagome spin-@xmath6 hafm was studied only in an early paper by using a rotational invariant green s function approach @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> certainly , one can expect that in kagome compounds an ilc is present . </S>",
    "<S> the geometry and the strength of @xmath16 may differ from compound to compound . unquestionably , an ilc is crucial to establish magnetic lro at finite temperatures , at least if the spin anisotropy is negligible .    in the present paper </S>",
    "<S> we study the spin-@xmath6 hafm on the stacked kagome lattice described by @xmath17 where @xmath18 labels the kagome layers and @xmath0 is a perpendicular ( i.e. non - frustrated ) ilc . </S>",
    "<S> the expression in brackets represents the kagome hafm model of the layer @xmath18 with nn intralayer couplings @xmath19 . </S>",
    "<S> for @xmath0 we consider antiferromagnetic ( afm ) as well as ferromagnetic ( fm ) couplings .    </S>",
    "<S> the questions we want to address in the present paper are as follows : is the perpendicular ilc @xmath20 able to establish magnetic lro for kagome @xmath7 layers with afm isotropic nn interactions , at all ? as we will demonstrate below the answer is yes. then , as consequent questions arise : does the magnetically disordered gs survive a ( small ) finite ( non - frustrated ) ilc ? which gs magnetic lro ( i.e. @xmath10 or @xmath1 ) is selected ? is the sign of @xmath20 relevant ? </S>",
    "<S> if for @xmath21 gs magnetic lro is present , we may expect that for the 3d system at hand a finite critical temperature @xmath12 exists . from previous studies of coupled low - dimensional heisenberg spin systems </S>",
    "<S> @xcite we know that @xmath12 may grow as a logarithmic function of @xmath0 slightly beyond the quantum phase transition to gs magnetic lro .    in order to address the above asked questions concerning the role of the ilc we use the coupled cluster method ( ccm)@xcite to high orders of approximation . </S>",
    "<S> the ccm is a very general _ ab initio _ many - body technique that has been successfully applied to strongly frustrated quantum magnets @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the precision of the method has been demonstrated for kagome spin systems in refs .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite and @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the ccm gs energy for the @xmath7 isotropic heisenberg kafm is close to best available dmrg results @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> by contrast to exact diagonalization , dmrg , or entanglement renormalization techniques the ccm can be applied straightforwardly to 3d systems @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> _ coupled cluster method ( ccm). _ we illustrate here only some basic relevant features of the ccm . at </S>",
    "<S> that we follow refs .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite and @xcite , where the ccm was applied to the 2d kafm . for more general information on the ccm , see , refs .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> note first that the ccm yields results directly for number of sites @xmath22 . </S>",
    "<S> as a starting point of the ccm calculation we choose a normalized reference state @xmath23 . from a quasi - classical point of view that is for the system at hand the stacked coplanar @xmath5 or @xmath1 state ( see , e.g. , refs .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> we perform a rotation of the local axes of each of the spins such that all spins in the reference state align along the negative @xmath24 axis . within the framework of the local spin </S>",
    "<S> coordinates we define a complete set of multispin creation operators @xmath25 related to this reference state : @xmath26 . here </S>",
    "<S> the spin operators are defined in the local rotated coordinate frames . </S>",
    "<S> the indices @xmath27 denote arbitrary lattice sites . </S>",
    "<S> the ket and bra gs eigenvectors @xmath28 and @xmath29 of the spin system are given by @xmath30 @xmath31 the coefficients @xmath32 and @xmath33 in the ccm correlation operators , @xmath34 and @xmath35 , can be determined by the ket - state and bra - state equations @xmath36e^s|\\phi\\rangle = 0 \\ ;   ; \\ ; \\forall i\\neq 0.$ ] each equation belongs to a certain configuration index @xmath37 , i.e. , it corresponds to a certain configuration of lattice sites @xmath38 . from the schrdinger equation , @xmath39 , we get for the gs energy @xmath40 . </S>",
    "<S> the magnetic order parameter ( sublattice magnetization ) is given by @xmath41 , where @xmath42 is expressed in the transformed coordinate system . </S>",
    "<S> for the solution of the ket - state and bra - state equations we use the well established lsub@xmath43 approximation scheme , in order to truncate the expansions of @xmath34 and @xmath44 , cf . , </S>",
    "<S> e.g. , refs .  @xcite . in the lsub@xmath43 scheme </S>",
    "<S> no more than @xmath43 spin flips spanning a range of no more than @xmath43 contiguous lattice sites are included . using an efficient parallelized ccm code @xcite we can solve the ccm equations up to lsub8 for @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> following refs .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite we extrapolate the ` raw ' lsub@xmath43 data to the limit @xmath45 . here </S>",
    "<S> we use two schemes , namely an extrapolation using @xmath46 ( scheme i ) and separetely an extrapolation using @xmath47 ( scheme ii ) . </S>",
    "<S> the former one corresponds to that used for the 2d kafm @xcite , whereas scheme ii ( i.e. , omitting the odd lsub@xmath43 approximation levels ) is more appropriate for magnets with collinear afm correlations @xcite . by comparing the results of both schemes we can get an idea on the precision of the extrapolated data .    for the gs energy </S>",
    "<S> the ansatz @xmath48 provides accurate data for the extrapolated energy @xmath49 , whereas for the magnetic order parameter @xmath50 the ansatz @xmath51 is appropriate . </S>",
    "<S> the choice of the leading exponent @xmath52 is a subtle issue , since @xmath52 might be different in semi - classical gs phases with well - pronounced magnetic lro and near a quantum critical point , see @xcite . for the kagome problem at hand </S>",
    "<S> we start from a magnetically disordered phase at @xmath53 and search for quantum phase transitions to gss with magnetic lro . </S>",
    "<S> for that the extrapolation of @xmath50 with @xmath54 is the best choice as it has been demonstrated in many previous ccm investigations @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the ccm treatment of the celebrated spin - half @xmath55-@xmath56 model on the square lattice using @xmath54 @xcite yields quantum critical points , which are in very good agreement with best available numerical results obtained by dmrg with explicit implementation of su(2 ) spin rotation symmetry @xcite .    _ results and discussion. _ we start with a brief discussion of the gs energy per spin @xmath57 , shown in the insets of figs .  [ </S>",
    "<S> fig1](a ) and ( b ) for the @xmath5 and @xmath1 reference states , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> we see that @xmath58 converges quickly as the level @xmath43 of the lsub@xmath43 approximation increases . </S>",
    "<S> hence , the extrapolation with leading order @xmath59 can be considered as very accurate , as it has been demonstrated in many cases , where data from other precise methods are available to compare with , see , e.g. refs .  </S>",
    "<S> . moreover , the results of both extrapolation schemes are almost indistinguishable . </S>",
    "<S> the shape of the curves and the magnitude of the energies is very similar for both states . from ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite we know that at @xmath53 the @xmath1 state has slightly lower energy . </S>",
    "<S> the extrapolated gs energy behaves smoothly as changing the sign of @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> the magnetic order parameter @xmath50 for the @xmath5 and @xmath1 states is shown in the main panel of figs .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1](a ) and ( b ) . </S>",
    "<S> of course , @xmath50 is zero for @xmath53 @xcite . as a main result </S>",
    "<S> , we find that the ilc is able to establish magnetic lro for kagome @xmath7 layers with afm nn heisenberg interactions . </S>",
    "<S> the critical ilcs , where magnetic lro sets in , are ( i ) @xmath60 , @xmath61 ( @xmath5 state ) and @xmath62 , @xmath63 ( @xmath1 state ) for scheme i , and ( ii ) @xmath64 , @xmath65 ( @xmath5 state ) and @xmath66 , @xmath67 ( @xmath1 state ) for scheme ii . thus , there is a reasonable agreement of the critical ilcs obtained by both extrapolation schemes . </S>",
    "<S> we notice that the amount of the critical @xmath4 is of comparable size as the spin gap estimated , e.g. , in refs .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite and @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we may also compare with the square - lattice @xmath55-@xmath56 hafm in the limit of strong frustration , i.e. , at @xmath68 . </S>",
    "<S> the critical ilc @xmath20 found by various approaches @xcite is @xmath69 , i.e. , its size is comparable to that reported here for the kagome system . </S>",
    "<S> the behavior of @xmath50 near the critical @xmath20 indicates a typical second - order transition , where the slope of @xmath50 is quite steep . on the fm side ( @xmath70 ) </S>",
    "<S> there is a monotonic increase of @xmath50 with increasing @xmath4 , and , both schemes i and ii lead to very similar @xmath71 curves . </S>",
    "<S> by contrast , on the afm side ( @xmath72 ) there is a noticeable difference between both schemes . that can be attributed to emerging collinear afm correlations along the afm @xmath0 bonds that may lead to a different scaling of odd and even lsub@xmath43 data @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we mention , that the maximum value of @xmath50 remains small even at @xmath73 . </S>",
    "<S> note that for afm @xmath0 we have calculated data up to @xmath74 . for the extrapolation scheme ii relevant in the limit of large @xmath0 we do not find indications for a breakdown of lro at a finite @xmath0 , </S>",
    "<S> rather there is a monotonic decrease of @xmath50 with increasing @xmath0 reaching adiabatically @xmath75 at infinite @xmath0 , cf . also ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> next we discuss the question which magnetic lro is selected by quantum fluctuations . as it has been very recently demonstrated @xcite the mechanism of quantum selection of the gs lro in the kafm is very subtle and it is related to topologically nontrivial , looplike high - order spin - flip processes @xcite . as a result , the energy difference between competing states is very small , e.g. , about @xmath76 for the @xmath77-kafm @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> hence , it is crucial to have a theory at hand that provides very accurate results for the gs energy and is able to take into account such high - order spin - flip processes . </S>",
    "<S> these criteria are fulfilled by the ccm , if high orders of approximation are considered . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the quantum selection of the @xmath5 gs vs. the @xmath1 gs obtained by non - linear spin - wave theory is also obtained by ccm for @xmath9 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> very recently , a direct comparison of ccm and non - linear spin - wave data for energy differences ( which are also of the order of few @xmath78 ) for the @xmath77 kafm for large @xmath3 has been given , see fig .  3 in ref </S>",
    "<S> .  @xcite , which provides evidence that both independent approaches agree very well . </S>",
    "<S> thus , we may conclude that our results for the quantum selection are trustworthy . </S>",
    "<S> we show our results for the energy difference @xmath79 as a function of @xmath0 in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2 ] . </S>",
    "<S> we mention first that both extrapolation schemes i and ii yield consistent results for @xmath80 . at low values of @xmath4 </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath1 reference state yields lower energy , i.e. @xmath81 . </S>",
    "<S> that is in accordance with refs .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite and @xcite , where the case @xmath53 was considered . on both sides </S>",
    "<S> @xmath82 is still positive at those values of @xmath0 , where the sublattice magnetizations @xmath83 or @xmath84 become larger than zero . </S>",
    "<S> hence , our results provide evidence that there is a magnetic disorder - to - order transition to @xmath85 lro at @xmath86 and @xmath87 , respectively , where this transition is likely continuous . </S>",
    "<S> note that the quantum selection of the @xmath1 gs lro is contrary to the semi - classical large-@xmath3 order - by - disorder selection of the @xmath10 lro found for the 2d spin-@xmath3 kafm . further increasing the strength of @xmath0 leads to a second transition from @xmath85 to @xmath10 lro on the fm side at @xmath88 ( scheme i ) and @xmath89 ( scheme ii ) . at the afm side we find @xmath90 ( scheme i ) and @xmath91 ( scheme ii ) . </S>",
    "<S> by contrast to the first transition this second transition is a discontinuous one between two ordered gs phases with different symmetries . on the fm side </S>",
    "<S> we may understand the realization of @xmath92 lro in terms of the large-@xmath3 order - by - disorder gs selection of the @xmath92 state . </S>",
    "<S> increasing the strength of the fm ilc leads to an effective composite spin with higher spin quantum number . </S>",
    "<S> however , this kind of mechanism does not work for afm @xmath0 , and to clarify the mechanism responsible for changing the gs selection remains an open question .    </S>",
    "<S> collecting our results we obtain a sketch of the gs phase diagram of the stacked spin-1/2 heisenberg kafm as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3 ] . </S>",
    "<S> the system exhibits four transitions , two continuous ones between a qsl state and a magnetically ordered state with @xmath1 symmetry at @xmath86 and @xmath87 , and two discontinuous ones between states with magnetic lro of @xmath1 and @xmath92 symmetry at @xmath93 and @xmath94 . </S>",
    "<S> we further argue , that this kind of phase diagram is specific for the extreme quantum case @xmath7 . from ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite we know that already for @xmath95 ( and also for @xmath96 ) the @xmath5 reference state has the lower energy . </S>",
    "<S> it seems to be very unlikely that this preference of the @xmath5 state is changed by @xmath0 .    </S>",
    "<S> _ concluding remarks . </S>",
    "<S> _ let us discuss the relation of our findings to the previous results based on a rotational invariant green s function method ( rgm ) @xcite , where the existence of a non - magnetic gs for arbitrary values of @xmath0 was reported . to evaluate this discrepancy we have to assess the accuracy of the current ccm approach and of the rgm approach . </S>",
    "<S> first we mention that the ccm is a systematic approach taking into account all spin - flip processes up to a well - defined order . on the other hand , the decoupling of the equation of motion used in the rgm contains uncontrolled elements of approximation . </S>",
    "<S> meanwhile , there is ample of experience in applying the rgm on frustrated quantum magnets , see , e.g. , ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite and references therein . in its minimal version ( used in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) , where as many vertex parameters are used as independent conditions for them can be formulated , the accuracy of the description of gs properties seems to be limited @xcite . in particular </S>",
    "<S> , the rotational invariant decoupling strongly overestimates the region of qsl phases . </S>",
    "<S> thus , for the square - lattice @xmath7 @xmath55-@xmath56 hafm the minimal version of the rgm predicts a qsl phase in an extremely wide region @xmath97 , cf . , </S>",
    "<S> e.g. , refs .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , instead of @xmath98 , obtained by recent dmrg calculations @xcite and also by the ccm @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> another indication is the fairly poor gs energy of @xmath99 @xcite , that is more than 2% above the best available dmrg energy @xmath100 . </S>",
    "<S> ( note that the ccm energy obtained in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite is @xmath101 . ) </S>",
    "<S> thus we have evidence that the ccm description of the gs properties is much more reliable than the rgm in its minimal version .    </S>",
    "<S> let us finally discuss the relevance of our results for experiments on kagome compounds . in real kagome compounds typically the interlayer coupling is more sophisticated than that we consider in our paper . </S>",
    "<S> thus , there is only an indirect relation of our results to those compounds , which concerns the general question for the crossover from a purely 2d to a quasi-2d and finally to a three - dimensional system . </S>",
    "<S> however , there is at least one example with stacked ( unshifted ) kagome layers , namely barlowite . </S>",
    "<S> as it has been pointed out very recently , through isoelectronic substitution in barlowite this kagome system fits to our model system @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> a main finding of our paper is that the qsl phase can be observed even if there is a sizeable ilc . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , in accordance with the experimental observation the ilc of about 5% of the intralayer coupling as reported for herbertsmithite @xcite and the ilc of about 6 - 7% predicted for the modified barlowite system @xcite is not sufficient to destroy the qsl phase . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> if the ilc is large enough ( about 15% of the intralayer coupling in our model system ) magnetic lro can be established , where the @xmath1 symmetry is favorable if @xmath0 is of moderate strength . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the observed @xmath1 magnetic order found in cs@xmath13cu@xmath14snf@xmath15 and ascribed in refs .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite and @xcite to anisotropy terms could also be attributed to the ilc without further anisotropy terms . </S>",
    "<S> the facilitation of the @xmath5 magnetic long - range order found in the present paper for larger values of @xmath4 is related to a very small energy gain . in real compounds even very small additional terms in the relevant spin hamiltonian such as further distance exchange couplings </S>",
    "<S> may therefore be more relevant . </S>"
