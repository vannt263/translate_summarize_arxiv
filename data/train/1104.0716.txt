    "quantum dots ( qds ) are regarded as a good system for the storage and manipulation of quantum information ( qi ) . in these systems ,",
    "the qubit could be encoded , for example , in the spin of an electron @xcite or the electronic charge distribution @xcite or even the presence / absence of excitons @xcite .",
    "spin qubits are particularly important because of their long decoherence times .",
    "the earliest proposals advocated the use of the spin of a single electron in a quantum dot as a qubit with quantum gates being realized by tuning the exchange coupling between two quantum dots @xcite .",
    "however , the exchange interaction between dots is not the easiest parameter to control . for this reason",
    ", some early experiments @xcite and recent proposals @xcite have focussed on qubits encoded on two spins in double dot systems , where the control parameter is the energy mismatch between the quantum dots .",
    "this is motivated by the fact that the energy mismatch between dots can be simple to control , for example , through source - drain bias @xcite or local electrostatic gates @xcite",
    ". it would thus be interesting to have a protocol where one requires only the above control ( namely the energy mismatch between dots ) and is yet able to use a single spin as a qubit .        in this paper",
    ", we propose such a protocol using a linear triple dot system where qubits ( individual electronic spins ) are placed in the outer dots with the central dot being kept unfilled .",
    "an alternative motivation for our work stems from the fact that various triple dot systems are now being fabricated and their charge stability diagram with small numbers of electrons is being studied @xcite .",
    "however , most experiments in quantum information context ( with the exception of ref.@xcite ) have so far have been limited exclusively to double dot systems .",
    "it would thereby be very timely to have a scheme such as ours , which enhances the scope of quantum gate related experiments to triple dot systems .",
    "of course , the most straightforward generalization of the schemes in double dots @xcite would be to have three spin qubits in three quantum dots i.e. , the filling of the quantum dots being @xmath0 .",
    "another possibility is to have a spin in the central dot as a _ mediator _ for an effective coupling between the outer dots , a configuration which has recently been studied in the molecular context @xcite .",
    "another possibility with a @xmath0 filling is to encode a single qubit in three dots @xcite , which has been explored in a very recent experiment @xcite .",
    "here we find out that a lower filling configuration , namely a @xmath1 filling , also provides a system for two qubit quantum gates with the qubits being in the outer dots .",
    "the @xmath1 filling prevents one from reducing the problem to one of distinguishable spins ( labeled by their sites ) interacting through exchange interactions as in the existing schemes for quantum gates with spin qubits .",
    "thus both the tunneling of electrons from one site to another , and careful second quantized treatment are important in the current problem and make it interesting .",
    "note that very recently an alternative mechanism for two qubit gates in a triple dot system with qubits in the first two dots , i.e. , a @xmath2 filling , has been proposed using spin dependent tunnelings and adiabatic processes @xcite  however , that is a very different scheme from the one we report here which is neither adiabatic nor exploiting spin dependent couplings .",
    "moreover , fast and coherent singlet - triplet filtering mechanisms have been proposed in single dots which effectively behave rather similarly to multiple quantum dots @xcite .",
    "our setup consists of 3 quantum dots ( qds ) in a row , with the voltage applied to the central one being controllable by some electrode , as shown in fig.[setup ] .",
    "we label the outer dots of the chain as dot a and dot b , while we label the central dot as dot c. we will assume that the mott - hubbard hamiltonian describes the system well ( for example , see refs.@xcite ) , whereby the relevant hamiltonian is @xmath3 in the above , @xmath4 stands for a , b and c , @xmath5 creates and @xmath6 annihilates an electron at the @xmath4th dot in the spin state @xmath7 with energy @xmath8 . here",
    "we have assumed that the particles are created only in the lowest energy state at the site ( @xmath8 ) and the higher energy levels for a single electron are so well separated that they never become involved in the problem .",
    "@xmath9 is the coulomb repulsion in the qd @xmath4 , @xmath10 is the total electron number operator of the @xmath4th dot and @xmath11 and @xmath12 are tunnel matrix elements betweens dots . here",
    "we have assumed that another term , often present in hubbard models for dot arrays , namely the inter - dot electrostatic interaction is zero .",
    "moreover , we have assumed that there exists no tunneling between the non - neighboring dots , namely a and b. this should be a good approximation in serial triple dot systems @xcite as @xmath13 and @xmath14 have a high separation .",
    "some relevant experimental values for @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 from recent experiments are given in the table @xmath15 of ref.@xcite , which will provide our guide for exploring feasibility issues .",
    "the dots at the two ends ( i.e. , qd a and qd b ) are each assumed to be filled up by a single electron as shown in fig.[setup ] .",
    "these two electronic spins will be the two qubits in our problem .",
    "as these qubits are identified by their sites , they can be referred to as qubit a and qubit b respectively . of course",
    ", we should be able to control when we want to enact a quantum gate between the aforementioned qubits , and for those intervals of time when we do not want any gates , nothing should happen to the qubits ( the state of the qubits , whatever they are , should remain intact ) . to ensure this , one has to ensure that the qubits stably remain in a @xmath1 filling as shown in fig.[setup ] and do not hop into qd c during this non - processing stage .",
    "this is achieved by choosing an appropriate set of voltages applied to the triple dot system and there are quite a few experimental examples by now in which the @xmath1 filling has already been realized .",
    "typically , if the hamiltonian @xmath16 of eq.([h ] ) is valid with @xmath17 , then one has to set the volgate applied to qd c to a lower value and the voltages of qds a and b to a higher equal value",
    ". also we have to work with systems with @xmath18 so that hopping is severely suppressed . in this `` non - processing ''",
    "mode of our system , the system evolution effectively freezes .",
    "when one intends to accomplish a quantum gate , one rapidly sets @xmath19 and a time evolution starts ( this is true as long as the hamiltonian @xmath16 with @xmath17 is a good approximation of the triple dot system in consideration ; in different experimental realizations , the hamiltonian may deviate differently from this , and then , for the processing mode , one has to apply that voltage which ensures the electrostatic energy of the configurations @xmath20 and @xmath21 to be equal ) .",
    "we will show that a two qubit  entangling \" quantum gate can be obtained between the qubits by virtue of this evolution through hamiltonian @xmath16 .",
    "though during the time evolution , the electrons can hop into the otherwise empty qd c , and indeed this is necessary for their spins to interact , at the end of a fixed period of evolution , one electron is back in each of qd a and qd b. we will assume that single qubit gates on the spins in the outer dots can be trivially implemented by using local fields , so that we are going to concentrate only on the demonstration of a two qubit entangling gate .",
    "the demonstration of the two qubit entangling gate is at the heart of demonstrating the viability of a system for universal quantum computation .",
    "the specific gate that we will demonstrate as enactable between the spins in the outer dots by means of their evolution through the hamiltonian @xmath16 is given by the following evolution of the computational basis states @xmath22 ( up spin along any axis , say @xmath23 , standing for the logical state @xmath24 ) and @xmath25 ( down spin along any axis , say @xmath23 standing for the logical state @xmath26 ) :    @xmath27 and @xmath28 to entangled states",
    ". thus the above gate suffices , in conjunction with local unitary operations on qubits a and b , for universal quantum computation @xcite .    before proceeding further",
    ", we have to briefly clarify the notations that we will use .",
    "the gate presented above is in the usual notation of states of multiple qubits , where all the qubits are distinguishable and each qubit has its own distinct label .",
    "however , this distinctive labels ( namely , qubit a and qubit b ) are true only in the  non - processing \" phase , i.e. , before and after the time evolution by @xmath29 .",
    "the two electrons may loose their site labels ( namely a and b ) during the evolution and thereby a fully second quantized treatment which automatically takes account of the indistinguishability of the electrons is necessary .",
    "so , as basis states for writing down the hamiltonian of the system , we shall use the states @xmath30 with @xmath31 and @xmath32 , where @xmath24 is the state with all three dots empty , and evaluate the matrix elements of the hamiltonian @xmath29 in this basis .",
    "let us point out that the total spin component along any axis is conserved by @xmath29 .",
    "choosing an axis to be the @xmath23 axis , for example , and remembering our @xmath1 initial filling , the problem becomes three independent problems for the total @xmath23 component of the spin in the three sites @xmath33 being @xmath34 ( @xmath35 ) , @xmath36 ( @xmath37 ) or @xmath38 ( @xmath39 ) . in the @xmath40 sector ,",
    "a complete basis comprises three states @xmath41 and @xmath42 , in which the @xmath43 hamiltonian is simply @xmath44 from the above hamiltonian it is easy to see that if the system starts in the two qubit state @xmath45 ( which actually means the state @xmath46 ) , then at times @xmath47 , where @xmath48 is an integer , the system comes back to its original state without any phase factor .",
    "thereby , if we halt the evolution at any of these instances of time ( by suddenly setting the voltages to the non - processing mode ) , we will have the @xmath49 part of the quantum gate in eq.([gate ] ) satisfied .",
    "exactly the same result holds for the @xmath50 part of the quantum gate , which evolves in the @xmath51 sector with an identical hamiltonian matrix .",
    "therefore it remains to check whether there exist any values of @xmath48 for which the remainder of the quantum gate of eq.([gate ] ) happens at @xmath52 .",
    "for that we have to look at the hamiltonian in the @xmath53 sector .",
    "in the @xmath53 sector a complete basis is made of the @xmath54 states @xmath55 , @xmath56 .",
    "the @xmath57 hamiltonian matrix in this basis is not reproduced here for brevity , but it is important to note that here some elements such as @xmath58 are @xmath59 , while others such as @xmath60 are @xmath61 .",
    "this sign difference is important and can not be obtained without proper second quantized treatment . now assuming @xmath62 , one can adiabatically eliminate the double occupancy states @xmath63 to obtain the effective hamiltonian    @xmath64 with @xmath65 .",
    "the above effective hamiltonian is that of a 3-site @xmath66 model , with parameter @xmath59 for hopping and parameter @xmath67 for a spin - spin interaction _ only _ when the spins are in neighboring sites .",
    "we define @xmath68 and @xmath69 , in terms of which , the eigenvalues of @xmath70 are @xmath71 , while its eigenvectors are :    @xmath72 of qubits a and b evolves to @xmath73 . moreover this time must be coincident or approximately coincident with @xmath47 ( discussed in the previous section ) for some @xmath48 , so that the gate of eq.([gate ] ) is accomplished at the time @xmath52 .",
    "the initial state @xmath74 , or more accurately the second quantized state @xmath75 , evolves with time @xmath76 as : @xmath77 if we now once more invoke @xmath62 to neglect terms of @xmath78 , we can simplify the mod - squared overlap of @xmath79 with the target @xmath80 . \\label{analyticexp}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] notice that there are two distinct frequencies in the above expression , namely the higher frequency @xmath81 , which is due to the tunneling , and the much lower frequency @xmath82 , which is due to the spin - spin interactions .",
    "also note that , as expected , the modulus squared overlap with the target state is @xmath83 at time @xmath84 .",
    "however , most important to note is that at times @xmath85 with @xmath86 being an integer , the modulus squared overlap is unity implying that at these instances , the initial state @xmath74 of qubits",
    "a and b has fully evolved to the entangled state @xmath87 the initial state @xmath28 of qubits a and b evolves to @xmath88 , for any @xmath89 there will exist several values of @xmath48 for which @xmath52 is close to @xmath89 .",
    "thus one can always choose some @xmath48 and @xmath86 so that @xmath90 and at this particular time the quantum gate of eq.([gate ] ) is accomplished .",
    "ideally we would like to choose the shortest possible time to accomplish the quantum gate to minimize the effects of decoherence .",
    "the earliest opportunity is at time @xmath91 as this is the earliest time the second and third lines of the gate of eq.([gate ] ) is accomplished .",
    "depending on the strength of the tunnel coupling @xmath59 , nearly always it is possible to find a @xmath48 such that @xmath92 so that the quantum gate of eq.([gate ] ) is accomplished at @xmath91 .",
    "to convince the readers about this , we take explicit values of parameters in scaled units .",
    "first we set the energy scale of about @xmath93ev , which is a realistic typical scale of @xmath59 @xcite , to unity . in these units , we take @xmath94 and @xmath95 , so that @xmath62 is valid and yet @xmath96 is not too small . such ratios of @xmath97 are available and realistic @xcite ) , and based on them we plot some relevant curves in fig.[pol1 ] .     with the state it evolves to as a function of time after the gating hamiltonian is switched on .",
    "both the solid and the dashed lines show the modulus squared overlap of @xmath98 with the state to which @xmath74 evolves as a function of time after the gating hamiltonian is switched on .",
    "the solid line is from our analytic expression of eq.([analyticexp ] ) , while the dashed line from numerics without approximations .",
    "the parameters used in the plot are @xmath94 and @xmath95 in scaled units where the energy scale @xmath93ev is set to unity ( one unit of the scaled time is about @xmath99ns.),width=340 ]    it is clear from the figure that the modulus squared overlaps of the @xmath45 state with itself and the @xmath74 with latexmath:[$\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(|\\uparrow\\rangle_a|\\downarrow\\rangle_b - i    indistinguishable from unity at time @xmath91 .",
    "further note that if one could always tune the two free parameters @xmath59 and @xmath101 , to ensure that @xmath102 holds for some @xmath48 .",
    "fig.[pol1 ] also presents a plot for the evolution of @xmath74 to @xmath103 ) to show that the approximations ( adiabatic elimination ) leading to the expression of eq.([analyticexp ] ) is valid .",
    "however , to verify the quantum gate , one also needs to verify the phases outside the brackets on the right hand sides of the second and third lines of eq.([gate ] ) .",
    "we temporarily postpone this , and will verify these through additional plots that we make in the next section where we treat decoherence .",
    "now that we have demonstrated the possibility of an entangling gate between the spin qubits in our triple dot setting , we proceed to investigate how this gate is affected by various sources of decoherence . during the fleetingly small time window of gate operation ( about a nanosecond )",
    "transient charge superpositions will exist , and thereby the gate will be subject to some charge decoherence despite operating between spin qubits .",
    "note that this is _ not unique _ to our setting , but , in fact , also automatically present when one intends to implement two qubit gates with singlet - triplet qubits defined in double dots .",
    "there the singlet and the triplet have to go to distinct charge configurations to enable gates between two double - dot qubits @xcite . as",
    "such decoherence is only during the gate operation , one can suppress it effectively by making the gate faster ( i.e. , @xmath67 stronger ) . in our case , during storage of the qubits , though , only spin decoherence , primarily due to the hyperfine interaction with nuclear spins , will be present .",
    "we first model the effect of charge decoherence numerically . as the temperature is lowered enough so that the effect of phonons is eliminated ( this assumption is met in current quantum dot experiments ) , decoherence due to spin - orbit interactions is suppressed .",
    "the @xmath104 noise generated in the triple dot device due to the fluctuations in the background charge is then the predominant source of decoherence .",
    "we will phenomenologically fix the amplitude of this noise to set a charge decoherence time - scale of about @xmath15  ns ( coherent charge oscillations have been observed till about @xmath105  ns @xcite and even much higher have been reported in non - gated devices @xcite ) . setting",
    "the amplitude in this phenomenological way also has the advantage that it models charge decoherence of the best observed strengths irrespective of its cause ( for example , some phonons may still be present ) .",
    "we have numerically generated a @xmath104 noise and used a distinct value of the noise in each time step .",
    "the numerical program that generates the noise guarantees that it has @xmath104 noise spectrum .",
    "we have also taken the tunneling @xmath59 to change with the mismatch of the dot energies  we have taken @xmath59 to vary with the energy mismatch with a narrow gaussian profile of width @xmath106 ( this profile of @xmath59 has been taken only for this phenomenological decoherence estimation and not elsewhere in the paper ) .",
    "we then vary the average strength of the fluctuations till we get about a nanosecond time - scale of decay of the oscillations of the state @xmath45 during the gate , which are essentially purely charge oscillations .",
    "this is plotted in fig.[chargedec ] .",
    "we now take the _ same _ strength of noise for the evolution of @xmath74 under the gate and numerically plot ( in fig.[chargedec ] ) the probability of it to evolve to its ideal target state @xmath107 for both states ) .",
    "this has happened because we have chosen parameters carefully enough to get a @xmath67 which can give a gate faster than the currently known charge decoherence rates .",
    "an additional form of decoherence that will be active is the nuclear baths in the quantum dots , which induce decoherence of the spin states .",
    "it is known that the orientations of the nuclear spins evolve at a much slower time - scale in comparison to the dynamics of the electrons ( time - scales of @xmath108 and @xmath109 ) in quantum dot systems @xcite so that during one operation of our gate we may effectively regard the nuclear bath to provide a random but fixed ( frozen in time ) field .",
    "this is known as the quasistatic approximation @xcite .",
    "the effect of decoherence is then due to different constant fields in various runs of the gate ( a distinct random direction and magnitude in each of the quantum dots for each run of the gate ) . following the parameters given in ref.@xcite , we have modeled the dynamics using a magnetic field of about an order of magnitude less than the tunneling @xmath59 in a random direction .",
    "the direction is chosen completely at random , while the magnitude is chosen from a gaussian distribution given as @xmath110 . here",
    "one can not really use restricted spaces any more and the full hilbert space of the problem is involved as the nuclear magnetic field connects these spaces . thereby we tackle this part of the problem numerically in the full hilbert space consisting of the @xmath111 sectors by exact diagonalization of @xmath16 with the addition of a random magnetic field term in each dot and using a charge decoherence of the same strength as before .",
    "the results are plotted in fig.[pol2 ] and show that the probability of successful occurrence of the quantum gate ( eq.([gate ] ) ) remains higher than @xmath112 for @xmath113 in our units , which is comparable to its experimental values @xcite . in principle , though , this decoherence can be eliminated to a large degree by polarizing the background nuclear spins @xcite so that one can have quantum gates with fidelity only restricted by charge decoherence in a fleetingly small time window of gate operation .",
    "even this latter decoherence should decrease with technology , and have already been reported to have very low values in non - gated devices @xcite .",
    "alternatively it is known that quantum dot - like experiments can be performed also with _ neutral _",
    "fermionic atoms in optical lattices @xcite where charge decoherence is inactive .     noise .",
    "the time evolution of the modulus squared overlap of an initial @xmath45 state under this noise with itself ( dashed curve ) shows the purely charge based decoherence effect .",
    "keeping the parameters of the charge noise the same , we have also plotted the modulus squared overlap of the state @xmath114 with the state to which @xmath74 evolves as a function of time after the gating hamiltonian is switched on ( solid curve).,width=340 ]     in scaled units ( with @xmath115ev taken as unity ) .",
    "the time evolution of the modulus squared overlap of an initial @xmath45 state under this noise with itself is shown as the dashed curve , while the modulus squared overlap of the state @xmath114 with the state to which @xmath74 evolves as a function of time after the gating hamiltonian is switched on is shown as the solid curve.,width=340 ]    now we return to the issue of verifying all features of the gate of eq.([gate ] ) through appropriate plots .",
    "for example , we need to verify that the phases outside the second and third lines of eq.([gate ] ) , and particularly , how it gets affected by decoherence . one way to examine this is to use @xmath116 as an initial state and verify how close it evolves to the ideal state ( i.e. , state under no decoherence ) @xmath117 at time @xmath91 .",
    "this is demonstrated under only charge decoherence and both charge and hyperfine interaction induced decoherences in fig.[pol3 ] .    .",
    "it plots the evolution of the squared overlap of this state with is intended target state at the end of the gate , namely @xmath117 .",
    "the dashed curve shows the evolution when only charge decoherence is present , while solid curve presents the evolution when both the charge as well as hyperfine induced decoherences are present .",
    "charge noise is set so as to have a charge decoherence time - scale of about 1 ns , while the strength of the random nuclear field causing the spin decoherence is set to the realistic value of @xmath113 in scaled units ( with @xmath115ev taken as unity).,width=340 ]",
    "suppose one has a very high charge decoherence ( so that coherence stays , say , for only @xmath99  ns ) then one can still use our triple - dot setup for a gate by stopping at the very first peak of the oscillation of the @xmath45 state , i.e. , at a time @xmath118  ns .",
    "the resulting quantum gate is however different and obtained by replacing the right hand sides of the second and third rows of eq.([gate ] ) by @xmath119 and @xmath120 respectively ( in the @xmath121 limit ) .",
    "this has a lower entangling power , but is nonetheless an entangling gate , still useful for universal quantum computation .",
    "one merely has to halt the hamiltonian at an earlier time ( before decoherence has become too prominent ) to get the gate and repeat the gate a few times to get a maximally entangling gate such as a cnot from it . in fig.[pol4 ] , we have plotted the overlap of the ideal target state @xmath122 when one starts from the state @xmath74 and has an evolution under the presence of both mechanisms of decoherence .    .",
    "it plots the evolution of the squared overlap of this state , under both mechanisms of decoherence , with the state that it evolves to at any time @xmath76 under ideal conditions ( i.e. , @xmath123 and no decoherence ) , namely @xmath122 .",
    "the dashed curve shows the evolution when only charge decoherence is present , while solid curve presents the evolution when both the charge as well as hyperfine induced decoherences are present .",
    "charge noise is set so as to have a charge decoherence time - scale of about 1 ns , while the strength of the random nuclear field causing the spin decoherence is set to the realistic value of @xmath113 in scaled units ( with @xmath115ev taken as unity).,width=340 ]",
    "the primary achievement in this paper is to show that using triple dot systems , one can encode two single spin qubits and have an entangling quantum gate between them merely by tuning the voltage of the central dot ( or voltage mis - alignment between the dots ) .",
    "this eases the restriction of having to tune the tunnel coupling @xmath59 on a fast time - scale , which might be difficult @xcite or even impossible to tune in some setups of permanently built dots .",
    "one can scale this scheme to several qubits by using a one dimensional array in a @xmath124 scenario with the @xmath13 sites having single qubits and the @xmath14 sites being empty in the non - operative state of the system .",
    "whenever a quantum gate between two qubits is required , we tune the voltage of only the @xmath14 site between the qubits to enable a gate between them .",
    "we have shown that the gate works with high enough fidelities for a variety of input states for achievable values of charge and spin decoherence rates . for stronger charge decoherence , one can halt the unitary evolution at earlier pertinent times and still get an entangling gate , albeit with lower power .",
