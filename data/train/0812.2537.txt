    "recently , possibilities of bound nuclear systems with several antikaons such as multi - antikaonic nuclei@xcite and a @xmath10 molecular state@xcite have been considered theoretically .",
    "possible existence of the deeply bound kaonic nuclei has not yet been confirmed experimentally@xcite , but the relevant kaon - baryon interaction in a nuclear medium has been discussed by the use of both microscopic models and phenomenological models@xcite .",
    "there is a qualitative difference in formation mechanisms between kaon condensation in neutron stars and kaonic nuclei in terrestrial experiments .",
    "the kaon - condensed state is a strangeness - nonconserving system , and @xmath0 mesons are created spontaneously from normal matter through the weak interaction processes such as @xmath11 , @xmath12 ( @xmath13 ) beyond a critical density where the lowest energy for @xmath0 , @xmath14 , meets the charge chemical potential @xmath15 ( = @xmath16 ) .",
    "the ground state of the @xmath0-condensed phase is then in chemical equilibrium for the weak processes , @xmath17 , @xmath18@xcite . on the other hand , kaonic nuclear state is a strangeness - conserving system since their formation occurs in a strong interaction time scale , and strangeness should be implanted by trapping of @xmath0 mesons inside nuclei . the channel - couplings , @xmath19 , @xmath20 ( @xmath21 ) , etc .",
    ", may also be relevant to formation and structure of kaonic nuclei , whose decay modes are given by these strong processes@xcite . in spite of such a difference , kaon condensation and kaonic nuclei show qualitatively common features .",
    "as an instance , in @xmath0-condensed state , proton fraction becomes as large as neutrons , and electrons become less dominant , since the negative charge carried by @xmath0 condensates is compensated as a result of the increase in the positive charge given by the protons and since negative charge of the electrons are taken over by that of @xmath0 condensates@xcite .",
    "thus the particle composition of the @xmath0-condensed state is similar to that of kaonic nuclei .",
    "both kaon condensation and kaonic nuclei may be closely related with each other in the context of kaon dynamics in hadronic matter . in this paper",

    "we address possible continuity between the mkn as a finite system and uniform kaon condensation in infinite matter which may be realized in neutron stars .",
    "the thermodynamic potential is given in the relativistic mean - field theory ( rmf ) with reference to the density functional theory , which has been applied to study the nonuniform structure of kaon - condensed phase in neutron - star matter@xcite .",
    "in this paper , we base our model on the rmf with extension to include kaon dynamics that respects chiral symmetry@xcite , while the meson - exchange model has been often applied as a phenomenological model to describe kaon condensation in neutron stars@xcite , kaonic pastas @xcite and recently the kaonic nuclei@xcite .",
    "in the context of kaon condensation in dense matter , it has been recognized that chiral symmetry is essential and has many implications on the properties of the condensed phase@xcite as well as the onset mechanism@xcite .",
    "the most important difference between our model presented in this paper and the meson - exchange models lies in the nonlinearities of the kaon field dictated by chiral symmetry .",
    "thus , we can take into account the nonlinear effects in the mkn , the leading effect of which may be the repulsive interaction among kaons @xcite .",
    "we concentrate on the effects of the @xmath1 interactions on the ground state properties of the mkn .",
    "the @xmath1 interactions are classified into two contributions in our model : one is the contact interaction between antikaons inherent in chiral symmetry , where the nonlinear terms originating from the nonlinear representation of the @xmath22 field are incorporated in the chiral lagrangian , and the other is the one generated through couplings between the @xmath0 and meson ( @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and @xmath4 ) mean fields .",
    "the latter is a common contribution also incorporated in other meson - exchange models .",

    "these quantities will serve as additional observables indicating the formation of deeply bound kaonic nuclear states other than the spectra of the reactions .",
    "second , we are concerned with the mkn with several numbers of the trapped @xmath0 mesons .",
    "it has been proposed that double and/or multiple antikaon clusters may be identified in fragments after the relativistic heavy - ion collisions by way of invariant mass spectroscopy for decaying particles of @xmath22 clusters@xcite .",

    "fusion processes of the single or double @xmath22 nuclei may help sequentially increase the number of the trapped @xmath0 mesons in the nucleus . to be more realistic",
    ", one has to consider the quantities such as fusion cross sections which are directly accessible to experimental data .",
    "highly dense object would be obtained if the number of the trapped @xmath0 mesons can be as large as @xmath188 . in our results ,",
    "the central nuclear density reaches @xmath153 2.6@xmath87 ( 4.0@xmath87 ) for @xmath86=@xmath6380 mev ( @xmath86=@xmath63120 mev ) at a large value of @xmath24 ( @xmath144 8) .",

    "[ subsubsec:3 - 2 - 2 ] ( fig .  [ fig11 ] ) .",
    "thus the formation of the mkn accompanies a large energy release through emission of particles and radiation , especially in the case of @xmath86=@xmath63120 mev . at a large value of @xmath24",
    ", @xmath1 repulsion has a substantial effect on the reduction of the binding energy , @xmath189 . even for the double @xmath22 nuclei ( @xmath24=2 )",
    ", one can already see the nonlinear @xmath1 repulsive effect on the binding energy , although it is quantitatively small , from comparison of the result of the chiral model with that in the lowest - order approximation ( fig .  [ fig11 ] ) .",
    "therefore , we should carefully separate the @xmath1 interaction to extract information on the @xmath123 interaction in such a dense medium as the mkn with large @xmath24 .    the ground state energy per strangeness for the mkn , @xmath191 ,",
    "is written as + @xmath192 . since @xmath193=@xmath63104 mev and @xmath194 @xmath6340 mev ( @xmath194 @xmath63100 mev ) for @xmath86=@xmath63 80 mev ( @xmath86=@xmath63 120 mev ) in our result , @xmath195 exceeds the mass - difference between the lightest hyperon @xmath5(1116 ) and nucleon , @xmath196(= 176 mev ) , for all the cases of @xmath24 and @xmath86 .",
    "hence the mkn is not absolutely stable , and it would decay into mesic or nonmesic final states through strong processes such as @xmath197 .",
    "similar result has been obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite , where it has been concluded that @xmath22 mesons do not condense . note that , in ref .",
    "@xcite , they mean `` kaon condensation '' in the laboratory by a stable self - bound matter that might be obtained by conversion from multi - strange hypernuclei by the strong process , @xmath198 .    as shown in sec .",
    "[ subsubsec:3 - 2 - 1 ] , a neutron skin appears for the mkn on the tails of the nucleon density profiles for a large @xmath24 .",
    "the neutron skin structure may be confirmed by measurement of the rms radii of the proton and neutron , which may in turn provide us with information of the isospin dependence of the @xmath123 interaction .",
    "we have investigated the structure of the multi - antikaonic nuclei ( mkn ) in the relativistic mean - field theory by taking into account kaon dynamics on the basis of chiral symmetry .",
    "effects of the nonlinear @xmath1 interaction inherent in the chiral model on the properties of the mkn have been clarified . for the nucleus with mass number @xmath25=15 and atomic number @xmath26=8 , we have obtained density distributions of the protons , neutrons , and @xmath0 mesons by systematically changing the number of the embedded @xmath0 .",
    "it has been shown that the distributions of the nucleons and @xmath0 mesons tend to become uniform in the mkn due to the nonlinear @xmath1 repulsive interaction .",
    "the nonlinear @xmath1 repulsive effects become important for a large @xmath24 as follows : the distributions of the nucleons , the @xmath0 field ( the chiral angle @xmath136 ) and the baryon number density @xmath129 at the center of the nucleus are saturated for @xmath140 8 .",
    "furthermore , the saturated values of the @xmath136 and @xmath129 are much reduced in comparison with those in the mems and in the lowest - order approximation . from the results on the structure of the mkn",
    ", it is summarized that the mkn with a small @xmath24 ( with a large @xmath24 ) corresponds to weak kaon condensation ( fully - developed kaon condensation ) in infinite matter , although the nuclear density in the central region of the mkn is saturated for a large @xmath24 .",
    "we have also seen that the @xmath1 interaction through the couplings between the @xmath0 and vector mesons gives a repulsive effect as well as the nonlinear terms of the contact interaction included in the original chiral lagrangian",
    ". it would be then interesting to study implications of the repulsive @xmath1 interaction through the meson - exchange on kaon condensation in dense nucleon matter , since it is well known from the previous studies that the eos is remarkably softened within the models based on chiral symmetry , where the @xmath123 and @xmath1 interactions are furnished by the contact interaction , but without meson - exchange between @xmath22 mesons and nucleons@xcite .",
    "the increase of the @xmath1 repulsive effect with increase in @xmath24 in the case of the mkn suggests that the @xmath1 repulsion also plays an important role on the eos at high baryon densities in the fully - developed kaon - condensed phase which may be realized in neutron stars .",
    "such a repulsive effect may keep the eos from getting too soft , and it may help make the neutron star mass consistent with observations@xcite . in the extreme case , the mixed phase develops at very low densities .",
    "it is instructive to reconsider kaon condensation in neutron stars from a viewpoint of the mkn .",
    "one may extract some information about @xmath1 interaction in nuclear medium by studying mkn at the new facilities , j - parc at jaea / kek and fair at gsi .",
    "it has been shown that the effective @xmath1 repulsion leads to increase the lowest @xmath0 energy @xmath14 and to reduce the binding energy of the mkn at a large number of the embedded @xmath0 mesons @xmath24 .",
    "then one faces a situation where the lowest @xmath0 energy enters into the resonance region , @xmath199 = 467 mev . in such a case ,",
    "the strong coupling of the @xmath0 meson with the @xmath200-hole state occurs . to treat the coupling properly",
    ", we must explicitly introduce the @xmath200 in our framework from the beginning and solve the coupled channel problem .",
    "such work is now in progress and we will report some results elsewhere .",
    "we did not take into account effects mediated by hyperons for properties of the mkn .",
    "channel - coupling effects through inelastic processes , @xmath201 , should be relevant to energy and decay width of the mkn .",
    "a part of the channel coupling effects can be incorporated by considering baryons as quasi - particles that are superposition of the nucleons and hyperons through the @xmath202-wave @xmath203 couplings@xcite .",
    "in addition , hyperon - mixing in the ground state of the mkn should lead to more bound and denser nuclei , which may be stable against strong processes , decaying only through weak interaction processes@xcite .    in our model ,",
    "spherical symmetry has been assumed for the nucleon and @xmath0 meson profiles for the ground state of the mkn , and microscopic properties for the nuclear configuration such as shell structure and clustering structure have been ignored .",
    "the embedded @xmath0 mesons may affect such microscopic structures of the nucleus .",
    "for instance , the strong attraction between the @xmath0 mesons distributed near the center and nucleons may stabilize the mkn against a rapid rotation .",
    "if the mkn is formed with a high angular momentum in a process of nuclear collisions , it may appear with a superdeformation of the excited nucleus .",
    "such a deformation in turn changes the nuclear mean - field potential and thus modifies the shell structure for nucleons self - consistently .",
