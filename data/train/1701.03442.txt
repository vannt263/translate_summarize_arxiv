    "the davies - unruh effect ( dhe ) @xcite , essentially predict that in an accelerated frame of reference ; a vacuum state may seen as a thermal bath of photons with a black boddy spectrum at a temperature t , the main point of the due is that this temperature is proportional to the acceleration of the frame .",
    "the connection between thermodynamic and gravity began in the 70s with bekenstein @xcite and hawking @xcite , researching the nature of black holes . in 1995",
    "jacobson @xciteshown a thermodynamic description of gravity obtaining the einstein s equations .",
    "according to padmanabhan @xcite , the association between gravity and entropy leads in a natural way to describes gravity as an emergent phenomenon , and a formalism of gravity as a entropic force is derived by verlinde @xcite in 2010 .",
    "the dependence of information on surface area , rather than volume ( holographic principle ) @xcite , it is one of the key of black hole thermodynamic theory , as well as in egt .",
    "on the other hand , the tully - fisher relation @xcite is an empirical result , very well established for spiral galaxies .",
    "this relation is hard to be obtained from newtonian gravity , at least if only the visible mass of the galaxy is considered .",
    "the output for this impasse was postulating the presence of a galactic halo of dark matter . nowadays",
    "the empirical roots of the missing mass problem goes from the flat rotation curves of galaxies , cluster of galaxies , gravitational lensing , large scale structure , and it is needed to describe the spectrum of the cosmic microwave background radiation ( cmb ) .",
    "the nature of dark matter is unknown .",
    "but the most widely accepted hypothesis is that dark matter is composed of weakly interacting massive particles ( wimps ) that interact only through gravity and the weak force @xcite .",
    "however , so far , there is no direct evidence of wimps or other dark particles such as the axions , and only upper limits were reported @xcite .",
    "in addition , so far , there is no evidence of a new physics beyond standard model , in the large hadron collider ( lhc ) data @xcite .",
    "there is no evidence for susy ( super - symmetric particles ) @xcite , where the `` neutralino '' is a kind of natural candidate for a dark matter particle .    in the 80s , milgrom @xcite ,",
    "proposed a modification in the newtonian law of gravity as solution to the missing mass problem , without dark matter . rather than a scientific theory mond",
    "is considered only as an empirical model by most of the scientific community , because predicts a violation of the equivalence principle .",
    "however , mond has been very well successful to describe the galaxies dynamics @xcite .",
    "indeed , mond predicted the tully - fisher relation .",
    "the connection between entropic gravity and mond is not new , there are some literature on this topic such as reported in @xcite . in this letter",
    "we gives emphasis to the formalism of debye model @xcite of the specific heat of solid at low temperatures , incorporated to the entropic gravity . in section",
    "ii , the basis of egt within the debye formalism is presented and we defined the debye temperature , @xmath0 , in egt .",
    "section iii , is devoted to a analysis of the inertia at low temperatures ( @xmath1 ) . in the intermediate region ,",
    "i.e. , temperatures close to @xmath0 , egt seems to indicate that is the galaxy clusters region , this topic is discussed in section iv , and the section v is devoted for our conclusions .",
    "in 1912 , debye @xcite developed a theory to explain the heat capacity of solid as low temperatures .",
    "he assumed that the vibration of the atoms of the lattice of a solid , follows a continuous range of frequencies , such as an elastic structure , that cuts off at a maximum frequency , @xmath2 . in this theory",
    "each solid has a specific temperature , called as debye temperature , @xmath3 .",
    "the debye model correctly predicts the low temperature dependence of the heat capacity of solid and coincides with the approaching the dulong - petit law at high temperatures .    in egt",
    "an holographic screen is the closed area where is stored the information of the surrounding matter enclosed by the screen .",
    "the information is codified in n bits and is considered as the freedom degrees of the system .",
    "the holographic screens coincides with the newtonian equipotential surfaces .",
    "a central argument of the holographic principle is consider that each bit of information on the screen carries an energy @xmath4 and the number of bits n on the screen surface is proportional to the area of the screen , and expressed as @xmath5 , where g is newton gravitational constant . taking into account the equipartition of energy principle , the specific potential energy on the screen can be written as @xmath6 following the analogy with debye model , we have substituted @xmath7 , for @xmath8 .",
    "the main difference with the debye theory is in that the third debye function , @xmath9 was replaced by the first debye function , @xmath10 , because the information bits located on the screen have only a vibrational state along of the gradient of newton potential and it is assumes that the vibrations follows a continuous range of frequencies .",
    "@xmath11 is defined as @xmath12 the shape of debye function reflects the bose - einstein statistic formula , used in its derivation .",
    "if m represents the all mass enclosed by the screen surface , the specific potential energy can be written as @xmath13 , and considering that the entropy variation , @xmath14 of the screen , happens when a particle of mass m is at a distance @xmath15 ( close to the compton wave length ) .",
    "the bekestain entropy variation can be expressed as @xmath16 these relations , allows to obtain the entropic force defined as @xmath17 .",
    "the more simple case is for a spherical screen of radius r , ( @xmath18 ) , and the acceleration of the mass m is @xmath19        considering that @xmath20 ( see below ) , the debye function can be parametrized by a power function of type @xmath21 , as shows in fig . 1 and eq.4 becomes @xmath22 the two asymptotically cases are : ( a ) @xmath23 and means high temperature regime @xmath24 and the eq.5 coincides with the newtonian gravity theory , and ( b ) @xmath25 means low temperature regime @xmath26 and",
    "eq.5 reproduce the tully fisher relation @xmath27 observed in the galaxies dynamic and plotted as @xmath28 @xcite .",
    "the slope , 4 , fall precisely with that observed in galaxies , whereas the normalization require @xmath29 @xcite .",
    "the acceleration @xmath30 is the milgrom acceleration parameter @xcite and in this limit egt coincides with the mond theory . in this limit",
    "the debye first function ( eq.2 ) can be related as @xmath31 with @xmath32 and lead to @xmath33 .",
    "finally the intermediate region , @xmath34 , egt seems to indicate that is the galaxy cluster region , see section iv .",
    "the starting point for development of the general theory of relativity was the equivalence principle , it is also valid in the newtonian gravity .",
    "there are strong evidences indicating that the equivalence principle holds in all experiments at earth@xcite .",
    "we starting the analysis , taken into account the bekenstein entropy variation expressed in the eq .",
    "3 , and the entropic force concept @xmath35 to obtain @xmath36 m_gc/\\hbar.\\ ] ] according to the debye framework , the quantity , @xmath7 was substituted by @xmath37 . in eq.6 , f in the left side represent the force of inertia , that can be expressed as @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is the inertia mass , while the mass , m , in the right side of the equation , represent the mass of the particle , at a distance equal to compton wavelength of the holographic screen , when the entropic force emerges , then it is linked with the gravitational mass , @xmath40 .",
    "here we have two possibility :    \\(a ) if the equivalence principle holds for all temperature regions , we have @xmath41 and eq .",
    "6 becomes @xmath42 this equation we called as generalized due , at high temperatures , @xmath43 , @xmath44 , and coincides with the conventional due .",
    "2 shows a comparison between the generalized and conventional due . the discrepancy for @xmath26 can emulate dark matter . considering that @xmath45 and @xmath46 for dark matter and calling as @xmath47 and @xmath48 the accelerations according to the modified and conventional due",
    ", we have @xmath49 and multiplying this last expression by a , we have @xmath50 for high temperatures @xmath24 , @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "\\(b ) if the equivalence principle is violated @xmath53 and keeping the due without modification eq.6 becomes @xmath54 taking in account eq .",
    "5 @xmath55 , the ratio @xmath56 is plotted in fig .",
    "3 as function of acceleration .        following the fig.3 , we can see that the ratio @xmath57 for low accelerations increases as the acceleration decreases , the extreme case ( strong violation ) coincides with the mond theory prediction . while , for high accelerations ( temperatures ) , @xmath58 , and it includes all solar system , the equivalence principle remains valid .",
    "the fact that @xmath53 for motions in low temperatures regimen , can emulate dark matter .",
    "if we called as @xmath59 the dark matter mass , it can be obtained as @xmath60 and taking into account eq.8 , we obtain @xmath61 this expression coincides with eq . 8 , and means that we have a duality . however , in both cases , the central mechanism is the due .",
    "this suggested that the modification of due is more fundamental in egt and the emulated dark matter is seen as an apparent violation of the equivalence principle .",
    "it is well known also that the mond theory has its `` achilles heel '' . the galaxy cluster , seems to indicate that still is necessary a residual mass . in most cases",
    "the mond critics largely use this to reject mond .",
    "indeed , the residual mass required by mond was supply with an exotic neutrino , the `` sterile neutrino '' , considered as promising candidates to hot dark matter @xcite .",
    "so far , there is no direct evidence of these neutrinos @xcite .    on the other hand , in the central part of clusters the observed acceleration is usually slightly larger than @xmath30 @xcite .",
    "this clearly shows the limitations of mond in cluster analysis .",
    "however , there is not this limitation in egt and means that the temperature of the holographic screen that surrounding clusters enclosed by the screen has a temperature slightly larger than the debye temperature .",
    "this means that the clusters analysis requires @xmath34 .",
    "the relationship between various galaxy cluster mass estimators and x - ray gas temperature agree to within 40% @xcite .",
    "virial theorem mass estimates based on cluster galaxy velocity dispersions seem to be accurately related to the x - ray temperature as @xmath62 with @xmath63 @xcite .",
    "this results are consistent with that predicted by simulations @xcite",
    ". however , when is combined several independent observation , i.e. , a wide range of temperatures of galaxy clusters , seems to indicate a steeper @xmath64 index @xcite .",
    "even so , in all cases , the greatest discrepancy is in normalization , with differences around 40% to 50% .",
    "an analysis of galaxy cluster on the basis of entropic gravity is presented in @xcite . however , in this section we present an alternative straightforward analysis on galaxy clusters , on the basis of egt within the debye formalism .",
    "cdm @xcite .",
    "the solid line indicates the prediction of mond @xcite , ( @xmath25 ) , and the red dot line is the prediction of egt within the debye formalism to @xmath65 .",
    ", width=415,height=340 ]    under the assumption of spherical symmetry and following the eq .",
    "5 , the asymptotic @xmath66 , allow us calculate the mass of cluster as @xmath67 the acceleration in the gravitational potential of the cluster is related by @xmath68 , with @xmath69 .",
    "the density distribution @xmath70 is well described by the ",
    "@xmath71 , whose asymptotic expression is @xmath72 , where @xmath73 has a typical value of @xmath74 @xcite . under these conditions the eq .",
    "11 becomes @xmath75    for @xmath25 we have the mond prediction to the mass - xray temperature relation of clusters , expressed as @xmath76 .",
    "this relation is represented by the black solid line in fig .",
    "4 @xcite , where the mass function of an x - ray flux of several samples of galaxy clusters are plotted .",
    "we can see that data is closer with mond s predicted slope than that previsioned by standard @xmath77cdm and expressed as @xmath78 @xcite and represented by the dashed black line in fig .",
    "4 , and it is better than mond only at high x - ray temperatures .",
    "but the previsioned mond s normalization is around two times greater than observed .",
    "the red dots line in fig .",
    "4 , represent the prediction of eq . 12 , for @xmath65 and expressed as @xmath79 with @xmath80 .",
    "the normalization for this case differs from mond normalization by a factor @xmath81 , for @xmath65 and @xmath82 .",
    "egt within the debye formalism can emulate dark matter of two equivalent ways , the first case requires modification of the due in order to maintain the equivalence principle and the second one requires modification of equivalence principle in order to maintain the due . in both cases",
    "the due is the fundamental mechanism .",
    "this means that the modification of the due emulate dark matter which in turn emulates a violation of the equivalence principle . this scheme is promising , because recently results @xcite , on the sparc database of galaxies @xcite , seems indicate a challenge to the dark matter hypothesis .",
    "the egt within the debye formalism is also promising in the analysis of galaxy clusters .",
    "however , there is also a second dark entity to consider , the dark energy , responsible of the accelerating expansion of universe .",
    "the dark energy in egt is discussed in @xcite .",
    "even so , there is more a complication , the increase in a factor of 10 of the number of supernovae ia , in relation to the first analyses , seems to indicate that the accelerated expansion signal is only marginal @xcite .",
