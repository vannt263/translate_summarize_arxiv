    "graphene is one of the most remarkable new materials .",
    "not only has its discovery @xcite violated in same sense landau s theory of the thermodynamical instability of a two - dimensional structure@xcite , but also due to the peculiar band structure it has provided us with an invaluable opportunity to test relativistic quantum electrodynamics in the desktop laboratory @xcite . for that reason , much effort has been put into understanding of the phenomena associated with this material .",
    "since the graphene - based devices are usually considered as a mesoscopic systems , the landauer approach is widely utilized to study the ballistic transport in them @xcite . even though this approach does not account in the simplest form for all the features of the material",
    ", it provides a good overall description of the electric transport .",
    "this approach was extended by blonder , tinkham , and klapwijk@xcite ( btk ) to the case of standard normal metal - superconductor junction ( ns ) , and in this manner yielded a very good description of experimental data@xcite .",
    "their method has been widely used for different specific situations @xcite and finally adapted for graphene - superconductor hybrid systems @xcite .",
    "one of the most peculiar properties predicted in such systems is the specular andreev reflection and deviations of the conductance spectra@xcite from those predicted by btk for normal metals@xcite .",
    "landauer formalism has also been successfully adapted for thermoelectrical transport in mesoscopic devices@xcite . in the case of standard ns junctions btk formula , also turned out to be useful technique for predicting effects concerning thermal properties of electric and heat currents @xcite .",
    "this method has also been used for the graphene - based superconducting hybrid structures for obtaining the thermal conductance @xcite .",
    "however , the thermopower has not been studied so far .",
    "this topic is addressed in this article .    in this work",
    "we provide systematic study of the effect of the temperature on the charge current in the superconducting graphene junction ( gs ) using a generalized btk formalism for the specific case of graphene .",
    "we present results concerning the temperature dependence of the zero - bias conductance and the seebeck coefficient in the linear regime . for the sake of completeness",
    ", we also discuss the non - linear thermopower .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ model ] ( and in appendix [ appa ] ) , we present briefly a generalized btk approach for the charge current through the gs junction .",
    "the linear transport coefficients are discussed , in particular the zero - bias conductance and the thermopower .",
    "we also briefly comment on the effect of non - linear corrections on the seebeck coefficient .",
    "finally , we conclude in the sec .",
    "[ conclusions ] .",
    "we consider a ballistic limit for graphene based junction composed of the normal region and induced by means of the proximity effect superconducting region ( cf .",
    "fig.[setup ] ) . for the description of the unconventional quasiparticle states we utilize dirac - bogoliubov - de gennes equations for the two - dimensional ( 2d ) sheet of graphene in the form@xcite @xmath0 where the index @xmath1 can be either + or - what refers to the two inequivalent valleys k and k in the brillouin zone .",
    "the single particle hamiltonian is given by @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the energy independent fermi velocity for the graphene , and \\{@xmath4 } denote respective pauli matrices . because of the valley degeneracy one can effectively do the calculation for the one valley only .",
    "we assume that in the geometry , where the interface is determined by the @xmath5-axis , the pair potential with the s - wave symmetry changes step - like in the x - axis direction , @xmath6 where the temperature dependence of the gap function can be deduced from the usual bcs theory@xcite and is taken in the following form @xmath7    the bcs theory of the superconductivity based on the requirement that the coherence length is large when compared to the fermi wavelength . under that condition",
    "we can assume that the additional potential @xmath8 has the form , @xmath9 with large @xmath10 ( @xmath11 ) and for the simplicity we define @xmath12 .",
    "in numerical calculations we set @xmath13 .    in the spirit of the btk scheme ( by matching the wave functions at the boundary @xmath14 ) ,",
    "we obtain expressions for the amplitudes of the andreev hole reflection ( ar ) ( @xmath15 ) and the normal reflection ( @xmath16 ) of the incident electron - see appendix [ appa ] for details of the method .",
    "note that there is no intrinsic barrier at the gs junction , and thus the fermi vector mismatch is the source of the normal reflection .",
    "the transmission probability , averaged over the angles , takes the following form @xcite , @xmath17}{\\cos\\theta}|a(\\epsilon,\\theta)|^2\\right).\\ ] ] the btk formalism combined with the specific transmission probability derived for graphene , defines charge current through the gs interface as@xcite , @xmath18 where @xmath19 , @xmath20 are the fermi distribution functions for the normal ( g ) and the superconducting ( s ) region of gs junction respectively , and @xmath21 is the energy dependent number of transverse modes in the graphene sheet of width @xmath22@xcite",
    ". however , formula ( [ btk ] ) is not always accurate .",
    "the additional assumption is needed , that for each mode carrying incident electron , having energy @xmath23 and being andreev reflected there is always enough modes at the level @xmath24 for this process to happen .",
    "however , away from perfect andreev reflection regime ( @xmath25 ) , as in our case , formula ( [ btk ] ) remains rigorous .",
    "the quantity describing thermoelectric properties of the system is thermopower , or seeback coefficient ( @xmath26 ) measuring the voltage driving to zero the current flowing in response to the temperature difference , namely @xmath27",
    "expansion of the fermi functions in the normal and superconducting regions to the first ( linear ) order in both the bias and the temperature difference , with the average temperature @xmath28 , i.e. , @xmath29 enables to decouple eq.([btk ] ) in the form , @xmath30 the resulting from it the linear transport coefficients can be thus rewritten in the following closed forms , @xmath31 the temperature gradient and the bias are set as positive with respect to @xmath32 coordinate .",
    "for the temperature in the system approaching zero , the expression for the electric conductance ( g ) reduces to the well - known btk zero - bias conductance formula@xcite @xmath33        in fig.[linearg ] we have plotted the zero - bias differential conductance ( calculated from eq.([linearcoef ] ) ) as a function of temperature , normalized by the ballistic conductance @xmath34 with having @xmath35 transverse modes in a sheet of graphene of width w and given by @xmath36 for relatively high position of the fermi level in graphene ( roughly @xmath37 ) , the influence of the increasing temperature ( up to the approximately @xmath38 ) on the conductance is almost negligible ( cf .",
    "[ linearg ] ) .",
    "the origin of this behavior is strictly connected with the relatively slow variation of the transmission probability @xmath39 for the subgap energies in this temperature regime , and thus does not differ qualitatively from the standard ns case@xcite . in the low doping regime ( @xmath40 ) , the linear differential conductance as a function of the temperature vastly differs from the standard ns case and reflects the specific electronic nature of graphene , as well as the impact of a crossover from the retro to the specular ar limit .",
    "the non - trivial behavior of the dirac fermions in graphene has also its influence on the linear thermopower . from eq .",
    "( [ thermo ] ) and ( [ onsager ] ) formula for this quantity reads @xmath41    results obtained by the numerical integration are presented in the fig .",
    "[ lineartep ] .",
    "the low temperature regime differs from the one obtained for the ns junction @xcite .",
    "contrary to the ns case , for the graphene - based structure the thermopower does not vanish for non - zero temperatures .",
    "this is due to the relativistic nature of charge carriers in graphene , where ar does not vanish even for the high effective barrier in our case effective barrier is only due to the fermi level mismatch ) for the subgap energies ( for the normal incidence ar happens always with certainty@xcite ) .",
    "furthermore , in the low doping regime ( @xmath42 ) the seebeck coefficient for the gs junction is around one order of magnitude larger than even for high effective barrier value ( which as a phenomenological parameter , can incorporate also the fermi velocity mismatch@xcite ) in the ns case@xcite .    in this regime",
    ", we observe a clear maximum in the temperature dependence of the seebeck coefficient in the superconducting state .",
    "the maximum roughly corresponds to the minimum in the zero - bias conductance as a function of temperature ( cf .",
    "fig.[linearg ] ) .",
    "the source of the significant enhancement of the thermopower in the low doping regime ( @xmath42 ) should be understood as an effect of being partly in the specular ar limit , where the transmission probability spectrum drops to zero for energy corresponding to the fermi level position@xcite .",
    "this feature affects the zero - bias conductance as a function of temperature and in turns is responsible for the thermopower increase in the specular ar limit .",
    "therefore in this regime , the thermopower is large and reaches values up to @xmath43 .",
    "this suggests that there is a potential for application of this setup for cooling of various nanostructures .",
    "we have also studied numerically the effect of the non - linearity in our system .",
    "the thermopower in the non - linear regime can be calculated as a ratio between the bias voltage and the temperature gradient , when no charge current is flowing ( c.f .",
    "eq.([thermo ] ) ) .",
    "the results in the non - linear regime are presented in fig .",
    "[ nonlinear ] .",
    "we have found that the non - linearity influences the thermopower in a not systematical manner with changing fermi level position and the average temperature of the system .",
    "however the change is not as dramatic as in the ns case@xcite and is almost unnoticeable in the doped regime @xmath37 .",
    "in this work we have analyzed the thermoelectric charge transport in the graphene junction consisting of the normal and the superconducting parts . in the linear regime",
    "we have calculated the temperature dependence of the zero - bias conductance and the thermopower .",
    "we have found deviations of these quantities from the standard normal metal - superconductor junction case that are caused by the relativistic nature of electrons in graphene . in the specular andreev reflection regime seebeck coefficient",
    "is strongly enhanced for specific temperatures .",
    "we have also studied the effect of non - linearity on the thermopower and we have found that for a high fermi level positions ( @xmath44 ) it stays almost unaffected and in the low fermi level regime is noticeably enhanced with the increase of the temperature gradient .",
    "the authors greatly appreciate the stimulated discussion with adam rycerz , jan kaczmarczyk and marcin abram . the work has been partially supported by the foundation for polish science ( fnp ) under the team program .",
    "we also acknowledge the grant maestro from the national science center ( ncn ) .",
