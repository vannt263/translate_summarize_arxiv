    "linear chains of identical and equally spaced nano - particles were studied in a number of publications @xcite-@xcite .",
    "they support optical modes with relatively low attenuation and with no radiation to the free space if the inter - particle distance is smaller then the free space wavelength @xmath0 , and then the modes can be much narrower than @xmath0 . hence the name  sub - diffraction chains \" ( sdc ) .",
    "sdcs were proposed as waveguides , junctions , and couplers @xcite-@xcite .",
    "recently , sdcs were suggested as candidates for one - way guiding @xcite .",
    "the physics there is based on creating an interplay of two types of rotations : geometrical chirality and faraday rotation ( caused by longitudinal magnetization ) .",
    "this interplay strongly enhances non - reciprocity and eventually leads to one - way guiding .",
    "the attractive features in @xcite are the 3d nano - scale dimensions and the fact that the magnetic field bias is an order of magnitude weaker compared to some alternative structures @xcite . however , its chiral geometry is difficult to fabricate .",
    "other works on one - way guiding employ periodic structures of non - reciprocal material operating around their braag point , thus requiring relatively large structures @xcite .",
    "here we suggest a new type of sdc for one - way optical guiding .",
    "the structure is planar in nature , so it can be fabricated by relatively simple printing procedures of leaf - like patches on a single plane .",
    "moreover , it requires magnetization field that is significantly weaker than in @xcite . the underlying physics and geometry",
    "are described in figs .",
    "[ fig1]-[fig2 ] .",
    "a conventional sdc of spherical plasmonic particles supports three independent electric dipole modes ; one with longitudinal polarization @xmath1 , and two degenerate modes with transverse and mutually orthogonal polarizations @xmath2 @xcite . if this sdc is exposed to transverse magnetization , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , the @xmath3 mode is unaffected , but @xmath4 couples @xmath5 and @xmath1 .",
    "this coupling creates two new modes of elliptical polarizations in the @xmath6 plane , with two new dispersion curves ( see analysis below ) . at any operation frequency , one wave propagates in the direction of rotation ( `` paddles '' forward and `` rides '' forward ) and the second propagates counter to the rotation ( paddles forward and rides backward )",
    "hence , these new sdc modes are non - reciprocal . however , their dispersion is still reciprocal ( i.e.  even in @xmath7 ) .",
    "the route to enhanced non - reciprocity and one - way guiding is to create an interplay of _ two - type rotations_. hence , we add a _ longitudinal chirality _ : we replace the spheres by ellipsoids , rotated in the same plane of the elliptical polarization , i.e.  in the @xmath6 plane as shown in fig .",
    "the rotation step is @xmath8 .",
    "as we show below , this chain indeed supports one - way guiding .",
    "it is periodic only for rational @xmath9 .",
    "if @xmath10 and @xmath11 are coprime , then the period consists of @xmath12 particles . unlike the spiral structure in @xcite , if this ratio is irrational then _ there is no coordinate transformation under which the chain becomes periodic . _",
    "below we use the discrete dipole approximation ( dda ) and polarizability theory .",
    "these are standard tools in sdcs analysis @xcite-@xcite .",
    "they hold when the particle radius @xmath13 and inter - particle distance @xmath14 satisfy @xmath15 and @xmath16 , but studies show good accuracy even for @xmath17 @xcite .",
    "if a small particle with polarizability @xmath18 is subject to an electric field whose local value in the _ absence of the particle _ is @xmath19 , its response is described by the electric dipole @xmath20 .",
    "the dynamic tensor - polarizability of a general ellipsoid whose principal axes are aligned with the @xmath21 axes , made of an anisotropic material with electric susceptibility @xmath22 , is obtained via @xmath23 here @xmath24 is the vacuum wavenumber , @xmath25 is the @xmath26 identity matrix , and the imaginary term @xmath27 represents radiation loss .",

    "( [ eq3 ] ) and @xmath66 integer @xmath67 .",

    "this implies that the chain modes are elliptically polarized in the @xmath108 plane .",
    "the chain dispersion for @xmath109 and no loss was calculated numerically , and is shown in fig .",
    "we have applied a relatively strong magnetization of @xmath110 , in order to observe the features clearly ( the one - way property shown below is obtained at much weaker magnetizations ) .",
    "the @xmath45-polarized mode is identical to that of a conventional chain .",
    "two additional modes of elliptic polarization in the @xmath111 plane exist in the chain .",
    "when observed from @xmath112 , one rotates clockwise [ shown by the upper ( red ) curve ] and the second rotates counter - clockwise [ shown by the lower ( black ) curve ] .",
    "this elliptic polarization is only due to the transverse magnetization .",
    "it is mathematically evident from the @xmath106 phase difference between the @xmath113 and @xmath60 components we have observed in the solutions for @xmath114 , as seen in eq .",
    "( [ eq15 ] ) .",
    "all dispersion curves are even in @xmath7 , permitting propagation in both @xmath115 and @xmath116 directions .",

    "however , the light - line dispersion branches that run parallel to the light - line cone @xmath117 and that are associated with transverse polarization in conventional chains @xcite , represent modes that are practically not excited @xcite in the elliptically polarized curves ( red and black ) . to avoid cluttering the figure they are not shown here .",
    "next , we add _ longitudinal chirality _ ; we replace the spheres by prolate ellipsoids with semi - axis @xmath118 , axes ratio of @xmath119 ( nearly spheres ) , and add longitudinal chirality with @xmath120 ( hence chain period is @xmath121 ) .",
    "figure [ fig3 ] shows the results for the relatively weak magnetization of @xmath122 . due to the added chirality , the upper ( red ) dispersion curve of fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] that corresponds to elliptical polarization with clockwise longitudinal rotation , splits to three branches shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3]a , and shifts the light - line gap rightward . hence symmetry is broken and one way guiding is supported at frequencies within the shifted gap , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3]b . finally , in fig .",
    "[ fig3]c we show the normalized response @xmath123 of a finite chain of @xmath124 particles with the parameters above , for a unit amplitude excitation of the central particle ( at the origin ) , at the selected frequency .",
    "this response is obtained by solving eq .",
    "( [ eq5 ] ) for a finite number of particles , with only the central particle forced to oscillate at the aforementioned frequency ( hence it is a matrix equation of @xmath125 unknowns ) .",
    "the three curves in fig .",
    "[ fig3]c correspond to the three particles within each period .",
    "one way guiding is clearly observed ( note the logarithmic scale ) .        essentially the same picture holds for the lower ( black ) dispersion curve of fig .",

    "[ fig4 ] .",

    "this low ellipticity is sufficient to create one - way guiding if @xmath4 is present .",
    "in addition , @xmath127 is considerably weaker than that required in previous studies on one - way plasmonic waveguides .",
    "next , we study chains with loss . since a _",

    "these examples are important from the theoretical / physical point of view .",
    "they show that by using our approach of two - type rotation interplay a very slight breach of symmetry is sufficient to create a profound non - reciprocity and one - way guiding .",
    "however from the practical point of view structure _ flatness _ is at least as important , since it opens the way to employ planar fabrication technologies . to demonstrate this option",
    "we have simulated a chain with the following properties .",
    "axes ratio is @xmath138 , hence the particle s size in the @xmath45-direction is an order of magnitude smaller then its dimensions in the @xmath6 plane . since the longitudinal chirality is obtained by rotating the particles about their @xmath139-axis , it follows that the entire structure is practically flat and lies in the @xmath6 plane .",
    "other geometrical parameters are as before , with magnetization level of @xmath140 . a strong one - way property exists and",
    "it is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] .        finally , we verify our approach via a full - wave numerical solutions using the cst software package @xcite for the flat structure shown in fig .",

    "the particles material plasma frequency @xmath38 and loss parameter @xmath146 are @xmath147thz and @xmath148thz , respectively ( corresponding to ag ) . due to a limited availability of computing power and memory resources",
    ", we can apply the full - wave solution to chains of about 100 particles or less .",
    "hence our chain consists of 92 particles that create two _ identical _ chains of 46 particles each , one chain on each side of a short dipole antenna that serves as a local source - see inset ( b ) in fig .",
    "since this geometry should show significant one - way guiding within a distance of 46 particles only ( instead of within hundreds of particles used to obtain the results of fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] ) we need to apply stronger magnetization .",
    "hence we use @xmath149 .",
    "we have used the dda for a first estimate of the chain operation parameters , and then used the cst to search more accurately around the initial guess and to get full - wave solutions . the full - wave based chain response as a function of frequency",

    "when an interplay of two - type rotations is supported in a guiding structure , strong non - reciprocity and one - way guiding are created @xcite . in this work , a new geometry possessing longitudinal chirality in sub - diffraction particle chains is proposed . when combined with transverse magnetization ,",
    "the resulting elliptical rotation of the chain dipole - modes and the geometrical rotation ( longitudinal chirality ) provide the two - type rotation that lead to strong non - reciprocity and one - way guiding .",
