    "i have recently decided that i will spend some time and effort to try to come up with a consistent and satisfying account of how qm ( quantum mechanics ) works and what qm means .",
    "that is , consistent and satisfying to me .",
    "my decision is based on a fact and a conviction : the first is that i enjoy the topic immensely , the second is that i believe that a conceptual tidying up is an urgent necessity in the field .",
    "both circumstances combined make my decision an easy bargain .",
    "although many scientists and philosophers certainly agree with me on this , there is a strong and steady current of thought , and statements , that sees such a tidying - up enterprise as futile and entirely irrelevant .",
    "everything is perfectly tidy for them .",
    "their viewpoint ( slightly caricaturized or not so much , depending on who we are talking about ) is that non - relativistic qm has been completely understood an unspecified number of decades ago , that the so - called `` measurement problem '' is no problem at all , and that all the discussions about the different `` interpretations '' of qm are a distraction at best , a waste of the time and effort of otherwise reasonable individuals at worst .",
    "what you need to do about qm , they say , is just learn it from some undergraduate - level textbook which one , it does nt matter , since the topic has been carved in stone long ago and now it is just an exceedingly straightforward application of linear algebra .",
    "then you apply it to whatever practical application gets you the most funding , money , h - index or just the fastest path to tenure if you havent got it yet , and you are done .",
    "if you do not care about money , stability or prestige , you can choose the topic to which you want to apply the finished theory known as qm on the basis of the common interest of your department , of the scientific community , of humankind , or of the whole biosphere , whichever group you consider to be the worthy beneficiary of your efforts .",
    "what is also remarkable is that the advocates of this position not only decline to work in such an irrelevant enterprise as the foundations of qm themselves ( something that falls entirely within the bounds of their scientific and personal freedom ) , but they very frequently add ( and they do that with vigor ) that you should nt waste your time in that either  or something to that effect .",
    "maybe this intensity of purpose is what has caused the whole viewpoint to be sometimes dubbed `` _ _ shut up and calculate ! _ _ '' ; a motto which has been attributed to feynman but that seems to have been actually coined by @xcite ( even if he is not sure about it ) .",
    "in fact , although feynman maybe did nt say it , he was indeed close .",
    "when he is discussing the measurement rules for the double - slit experiment in his famous lectures , he writes @xcite : `` so at the present time we must limit ourselves to computing probabilities . '' ]    the proponents of the shut - up - and - calculate approach to the understanding of qm often perform this pastoral work ( of trying to save as many lost souls as possible from the bleak fate of irrelevance ) wearing the dignified robes of pragmatism , commitment to progress , clarity , and orthodoxy .",
    "also , among their ranks , we can find celebrated scientists and deep thinkers that have achieved significant advances in so many fields , which makes their claims even more appealing .",
    "i do nt know what the experience of the reader has been , but i have met this friction , this headwind , this resistance , frequently in my ( short ) career .",
    "when you start studying , you are young ( typically ) , everything is new ( by definition ) , and every great scientist you read and meet is more a semi - god than a human to you .",
    "hence , if you happen to encounter the shut - up - and - calculate command more often than the opposite in your early days as a proto - scientist , you might buy it and stop asking questions about the foundations of qm  to yourself and to others as well .",
    "i know because i bought it myself .",
    "fortunately , i have also been gifted ( or cursed ! ) with an innate and relentless curiosity and a lack of respect for authority figures .",
    "hence , along the years , i have read more , i have grown a healthy distrust , and i have come to the conclusion that the shut - up - and - calculate advice is a _ very bad one_. i think that it is just obvious that qm is a conceptual mess at the moment , with many respectable and clever scientists talking past each other , and i believe that acting as if the problem does nt exist can only lead to stagnation and to a delay in scientific progress .",
    "it is ok to close a topic if it has been completely ( or mostly ) understood , but it is dangerous and potentially tragic to close it too soon .",
    "i think that recommending young scientists ( or not - so - young ones ) to shut up and calculate is not pragmatic , does not help progress , does not foster clarity ( it rather fosters quite the opposite ) , and it is indeed not the orthodoxy .",
    "as i said , many voices agree with me on this , so i will not tell anything new here .",
    "my objective is not novelty but to join my voice to the choir that advocates a deep investigation into the foundations and conceptual structure of qm . in this way",
    ", i harbor the hope that the chances of you meeting a voice of this second group ( specially at the beginnings of your career ) are slightly increased by the existence of this document .",
    "additionally , i will use the opportunity to collect some interesting views on the controversy , and to put my own thoughts in order .",
    "since i need a great deal of silence to concentrate ( specially when i am dealing with complicated topics ) i have chosen to entitle these notes `` _ _ shut up and let me think ! _ _ ''",
    "i think that this exclamation captures the situation as well as my feelings about it quite accurately .",
    "i was delighted to find that very recently a similarly positive motto was coined by @xcite to counter the negative anti - rationalistic `` shut up and calculate ! '' .",
    "they are more polite than me , and they chose `` shut up and contemplate ! '' . ]",
    "the position that i introduced in the previous section that defends the lack of a necessity to investigate on the foundations of qm takes ( of course ) different forms , it comes from different angles and it is stated with different degrees of explicitness and intensity , depending on the personality and beliefs of the person that expresses it . in this section , i will collect some quotations when you quote somebody , it is easy to read something which is not actually said there , to misrepresent , to forget the context , etc .",
    "i have tried not to make these mistakes , but given the large number of quotations that i will mention , the odds are that i will be putting the wrong words in somebody s mouth . for those researchers that are still around , i would love to know if i have misquoted you , and i will promptly include the appropriate addenda to this document if you show me my error . for those that are no longer among us , such as prof .",
    "feynman , i apologize in advance and i will also accept suggestions from anyone that knows their actual thoughts better than i do . ] and i will try to group them according to a number of basic statements that are recurrent in the literature , in conference talks , in corridor conversations and in the minds of our fellow scientists .    since i think that all these arguments are ( at least partially ) wrong , i will also provide my personal answers to each of them .",
    "i will begin some of the sections with a quote not because i want you to see that a very important guy ( or gal ) agrees with me remember my lack of respect in authority , but because i think that they have ( approximately ) said what i think ( or the opposite ) with a style that is typically much better than mine .",
    "this argument denies the premise by basically stating that qm is now completely understood , and it has probably been so since a long time ago . nothing therefore needs to be done , and all the talk about the `` interpretations '' , the `` measurement problem '' , etc .",
    "is not physics but philosophy .",
    "the proponents of this view enrich their argument with reasons and sub - arguments supporting it , but i will deal with them later . in this section",
    "i will mainly concentrate on the core assertion that everything about the meaning and interpretation of qm has been solved already , and i will respond to that .",
    "the first great scientist that i want to mention that suggests everything is understood in qm is richard p. feynman . in the very first page of the 3rd volume of his awesome lectures @xcite , which is dedicated to what else qm",
    ", he writes :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ the gradual accumulation of information about atomic and small - scale behavior during the first quarter of this century , which gave some indications about how small things do behave , produced an increasing confusion which was finally resolved in 1926 and 1927 by schrdinger , heisenberg , and born .",
    "they finally obtained a consistent description of the behavior of matter on a small scale .",

    "so probably at some level he thought that qm presented no problems ( hence the tone of the first two quotes ) , but in other level he knew that something was not quite right about it .",
    "since he was mostly a pragmatist , he listened more to the first voice than to the second and just went on to produce some of the grandest achievements in modern physics , leaving that unresolved uneasiness in the back of his mind to be dealt with later or never . being an extraordinarily honest thinker as he was , he did not pretend that the uneasiness did not exist .",
    "he just preferred to advance without looking too much at it , or maybe he found more interesting problems to look at than this one .",
    "however , it seems clear that the possibility that everything relevant about the foundations of qm was not in fact understood yet did have a place in his thoughts , as it also floated in many conversations i have had with theoretical physicists , and as the reader has also probably found in her travels .    a much stronger advocate of the no - problem - whatsoever view is another great and respected scientist who is responsible of many important advances in statistical mechanics : nico van kampen . in his letter",
    "entitled `` the scandal of quantum mechanics '' @xcite , he attacks a paper by @xcite about bohmian mechanics one of the strongest proposals in my opinion to solve the conceptual problems of `` orthodox '' shut - up - and - calculate qm , and he writes paragraphs such as :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ the article by nikoli with its catchy title is a reminder of the scandalous fact that eighty years after the development of quantum mechanics the literature is still swamped by voluminous discussions about what is called its `` interpretation '' .",

    "first , any observation or measurement requires a macroscopic measuring apparatus .",
    "a macroscopic object is also governed by quantum mechanics , but has a large number of constituents , so that each macroscopic state is a combination of an enormous number of quantum mechanical eigenstates . as a consequence the quantum mechanical interference terms between two macroscopic states virtually cancel and only probabilities survive",
    "that is the explanation why our familiar macroscopic physics , concerned with billiard balls , deals with probabilities rather than probability amplitudes .",

    ", many theorists have worked out models of quantum measurements , with the aim of understanding not merely the dynamics of such processes , but in particular solving the so - called measurement problem .",
    "this problem is raised by a conceptual contrast between quantum theory , which is _ irreducibly probabilistic _ , and our macroscopic experience , in which an _ individual process results in a well defined outcome_.    [  ]    the challenge has remained to fully explain how this property emerges , ideally without introducing new ingredients , that is , from the mere laws of quantum mechanics alone .",
    "many authors have tackled this deep problem of measurements with the help of models so as to get insight on the interpretation of quantum mechanics .

    "generations of students have therefore stumbled over the problem of measurement , before leaving it aside when they pursued research work .",
    "most physicists have never returned to it , considering that it is not worth spending time on a problem which `` probably can not be solved '' and which has in practice little implication on physical predictions .",

    "if everything was already solved by 2008 , then what is the point of writing a very detailed , 166-page solution in 2012 ?",
    "the question is of course rhetorical .",
    "the answer is that _ nothing was solved by 2008 , and it is probably not solved by now either_. the many interesting works in the literature about `` interpretations '' of qm and the measurement problem are not `` advertisements of philosophical profundities '' but serious attempts to make sense of a very deep conceptual problem , and the many great scientists that have devoted time and effort to think about this are not delusional and they have not forgotten their pragmatism at home .",
    "one might wish that there is no problem with qm , but anyone that has her eyes open sees that in fact _ there is _ the belief that everything is ok is just wishful thinking .",
    "of course , maybe bohmian mechanics is not the solution and maybe van kampen is right about that .",
    "but even if that were the case it does nt mean that there is nothing to be solved to begin with .",
    "maybe van kampen s proposal is not the solution for that matter either .",
    "the excellent work by @xcite is not the only one we can mention that explores this very interesting issue . in fact , tens of them are published in the http://arxiv.org/archive/quant-ph[quantum physics section ] of the http://arxiv.org/[arxiv ] every month , according to my experience [ see , for very recent examples , the pre - print @xcite , and an answer to it @xcite in the same week ]",
    ". it would be preposterous to make an exhaustive list here , so let me quasi - randomly cite some very recent works by well - known scientists , most of them in very renowned journals : @xcite .",
    "these articles contain many questions that are still partially unanswered as well as the heroic attempts of their authors to solve them .",
    "i will not discuss the open issues here ( i merely want to make clear that _ there are in fact many open issues _ ) , but i recommend any reader interested in and puzzled by! the foundations of qm to enjoy a deep dive in any of these works to begin mapping the landscape .",
    "another interesting reading that could help gain some perspective about the lack of consensus in the field is the poll conducted by @xcite to 33 participants ( 27 of which stated their main academic affiliation as physics , 5 as philosophy , and 3 as mathematics ) in the conference `` quantum physics and the nature of reality '' , held in july 2011 at the international academy traunkirchen , austria .",
    "the authors asked the conference participants 16 multiple - choice questions covering the main issues and open problems in the foundations of qm .",

    "[ fig : poll ] .",
    "( i especially love the one related to changing your mind about which is the correct interpretation ! )    of course , scientific issues are not decided democratically , and moreover i have already expressed my lack of respect for authority which i wo nt withdraw .",
    "nevertheless , it seems to me that an ockham s razor type argument leads to conclude that it is more likely that unsolved issues remain and those few who deny it are victims of the `` compensation phenomenon '' mentioned in jaynes quote at the beginning of this section , than it is that tens hundreds ?",
    "thousands? of apparently clever and rational scientists of different countries , of different ages , some of which do nt even know each other , are all investigating a no - problem .",
    "since this kind of plausibility arguments are never definitive , i must admit that it is indeed possible that van kampen s view is correct and all the researchers that are pursuing alternative lines just do nt know it yet . still , it seems that this view has been carefully formalized only in 2012 @xcite so it would appear that we need to grant a little more time to the unconverted if we want to be fair . even more !",
    "the same argument can be used to admit the possibility that the many solid scientists that claim that , say , bohmian mechanics @xcite is the ultimate solution to all of qm s conceptual problems be right and all those that do nt see it this way are just temporarily wrong . or the many worlds interpretation @xcite , or the consistent histories approach @xcite , or quantum bayesianism @xcite , or collapse ( also `` dynamical reduction '' ) models @xcite , or ",
    "i think that the situation can be appropriately grasped if we admit to define the sentences `` there is a problem in a theory '' or `` theory x is understood '' as referring not so much to physical reality or to the theory itself , but to the scientific community that tinkers with it .",
    "thus , a theory will have a problem when a significant mass of intelligent scientists feels it has one , and a theory will be completely understood when the vast majority of the scientists feels it is so .",
    "i think i have proved that qm _ does have problems and it is not completely understood _ according to this point of view . in sec .",
    "[ subsubsec : classical ] , i will show that there exist theories , such as special relativity , which have no problems and are completely understood in this sense just qm is not one of them .    before closing this section ,",
    "let me quote the words in @xcite , who traces all the alleged wasted effort to a failure in understanding that the `` epr paradox '' is no `` paradox '' at all , and mostly agrees with van kampen on the no - problem - whatsoever diagnostic ( even if i am not completely sure that both propose the same solution ) :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ the quantum paradox community is , even after all these years and all the rebuttals , still on the increase .",

'' school is strong and thriving .",
    "we could delight in many of its paragraphs , but it actually suffices to read the unusually short abstract :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ quantum theory is a well - defined local theory with a clear interpretation .",

    "there is , however , a subtler way of suggesting the same thing : _ by omission_.    if you write a text and you never say that qm is completely understood , but you do nt say the contrary either ( or maybe you mention something about it briefly and _ en passant _ ) , the same viewpoint can be conveyed .    of course , it would be inefficient to make a detailed comment about the conceptual mess that pervades the foundations of qm in every paper that uses the theory or talks about it .",
    "what one should expect , nevertheless , is that such a discussion _ would be provided _ in textbooks , lectures and other occasions intended to introduce the topic to newcomers . failing to mention something in an account of such aim amounts",
    "to tacitly stating that the omitted point is not important to get a solid knowledge of the subject .",
    "since no interpretation is settled as `` the right one '' , the author of the introductory material has to pick one and talk about it as if it were the only game in town . the copenhagen view , which is typically seen as the one that most closely corresponds to the `` shut up and calculate ! ''",
    "motto , is chosen to play this role in almost all cases .",
    "therefore , generation after generation of students begin their careers with the implicit impression that this is how _ things are _",
    "as in the most conservative families , the kids are taught to shut up when they are still young and obedient . only this time",
    "they are not told so explicitly ( at least not always ) .",
    "even the proponents of the shut - up - and - calculate approach realize from time to time that telling people not to think may sound a little unscientific .",
    "i have found this omission not only in my own formation as a physicist but also in online university courses @xcite , as well as in most of the otherwise fantastic textbooks about qm that are typically used in such courses .",
    "let me mention only a few examples : @xcite .",
    "some other textbooks do assign importance to interpretative matters , but they present them as more or less solved according to one or another proposal of the authors liking @xcite . in yet some other textbooks , foundational issues are discussed and the different alternatives presented , but they are often included into the more `` advanced topics '' and not as concerns affecting the conceptual stability of the whole edifice @xcite .",
    "let me quote @xcite again so you can see that i am not the only crazy fellow saying this :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ but the history is less crucial to our present purposes than the status of the copenhagen view as what is enshrined in textbooks as the standard picture .",
    "every physicist learns this first , and then gets to contemplate other alternatives ( or choose not to , as the case may be ) . _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _    it is my content here that what is needed is to _ begin _ any introductory course ( or textbook ) in qm with a warning : `` _ _ be careful !",
    "the theory that i am going to describe to you next is extremely predictive when one applies its pseudo - rules to concrete experiments creatively .",
    "however , our conceptual understanding of it is still fuzzy and preliminary . how to make it solid",
    "i do not know , and it is by the way one of the most fascinating open scientific questions that you could decide to tackle once you graduate . _ _ ''",
    "this is not usually done in my experience , and boy would it have been useful to me some years ago !",
    "it is not yet clear to me what `` understanding '' a theory really is , but it seems a sure bet that it should require that one knows how the different technical terms that appear within it are related to concrete experiments ; that one knows how to apply the theory in every practical case without hesitation ; that one knows how to relate the theory to other theories properly ( think about statistical mechanics , classical mechanics , or relativity in the case of qm ) ; that one feels at ease and satisfied when using the theory and not perpetually asking oneself whether or not the calculations make sense , whether or not the next analytical step that one is planning to take is valid ; etc . for me , `` understanding '' is something that can be predicated about the network of concepts that make up the theory , as well as its embedding in the larger network that comprises the whole worldview of the individual that is trying to `` understand '' .",
    "if something is amiss , if the network seems unstable , this translates into a lack of security when reasoning about the theory and its consequences .",
    "but it is not my purpose to perfectly define what `` understanding '' means .",
    "it suffices to me to appeal to the popular use of the word in everyday life to make my point . in this , i agree with @xcite :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ we can not define _ anything _ precisely . if we attempt to , we get into that paralysis of thought that comes to philosophers , who sit opposite to each other , one saying to the other : `` you do nt know what you are talking about !

    "the important thing is that , whatever feynman felt that `` understanding '' is , he claimed that `` nobody understands qm '' not even himself ! on the other hand , although this seems to have produced certain restlessness in his mind according to the quotes in sec .",
    "[ subsec : understood ] , he did nt think that this lack of understanding was in any way incompatible with the fact ( for him it was a fact ) that all the confusion regarding the behavior of matter at the microscopic level was `` resolved '' with a `` consistent description '' and the `` correct equations '' for qm such a long time ago as in 1926 - 1927 ( as we have already quoted him saying ) .",
    "it is the second claim that i challenge .",
    "i do nt think that you can say that anything has been `` resolved '' or that your description is `` consistent '' unless you understand your theory .",
    "some voices that agree with feynman that qm is not yet understood circumvent the problem by saying in one way or another that understanding is unnecessary , that physics is not concerned with it , that it is not our job .",
    "it is clear from my position that i just do nt think this is true . in my opinion",
    ", every scientist needs to understand everything that is related to her field of expertise and physicists are not the exception .",
    "i also think that the assertion that `` understanding is not the job of physics '' is an example of the normative mode in which people tend to enter when they feel that something is deeply wrong but they do nt want to face the problem head on . in what follows , we will meet some additional unjustified rules that seem invented ad hoc to protect qm from inquiry , from analysis , from repair . but let me quote here what @xcite has to say about a quote by feynman that we will meet again later :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ feynman s advise to ( young , as he seemed to have assumed that the older ones are sufficiently brainwashed anyway ) physicists that , while ``  nobody understands quantum mechanics '' , to stop thinking about these issues ``  if you can possibly avoid it . because you will get ` down the drain ' , into a blind alley from which nobody has yet escaped .",

    "first of all , two weaker versions of the idea .",
    "feynman yes , he again wrote :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ so at the present time we must limit ourselves to computing probabilities .",
    "we say `` at the present time '' , but we suspect very strongly that it is something that will be with us forever that it is impossible to beat that puzzle that this is the way nature really _ is_. @xcite _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _    and you probably met this objection or similar ones before : the mystery is irreducible , the puzzle is eternal , it is impossible to crack the problem , and so on and so forth .",

    "i will not take too much time to discuss this anti - rationalistic argument .",
    "it is too weak an adversary .",
    "let me just mention that nobody has ever proved such a thing about anything .",
    "so far , we humans have been able to slowly but steadily understand more and more of nature s secrets , and it does nt look to me that qm will be special . in any case , if it were , the burden of the proof is on those that say that understanding is impossible , not on us who have plenty of examples of the contrary .",
    "to be fair , i have to say that i do nt believe that feynman was anti - rationalistic far from that !",
    "what i think is that , in his classic energetic style , and somewhat uncomfortable because he himself knew that something was wrong with the current understanding of qm , he mixed things a little bit again in the above quote .",
    "i will discuss something more about this soon in sec .",
    "[ subsubsec : how_not_why ] , but let me here briefly say that believing that qm is `` the way nature really is '' is perfectly compatible with the position that it is poorly understood and that something should be done about that .",

    "the positivist idea that all science does is predict the observable results of experiments is still popular with some scientists , but it always leads to the _ evasion _ of important foundational questions .",
    "for example , the recognition that there is a problem of _ understanding _ quantum mechanics , that is , a problem of figuring out just how physical reality must be in order for our most fundamental physical theory to work as successfully as it does , is becoming more widespread , but that recognition was _ delayed _ for decades by the claim that something called the `` copenhagen interpretation '' of niels bohr had solved all the problems . yet the `` copenhagen interpretation '' , in bohr s version , amounted only to the vague philosophical thesis that the human mind could nt possibly understand how the quantum universe was in itself and should just confine itself to telling us how to use quantum mechanics to make predictions _ stateable in the language of classical , that is to say , non - quantum - mechanical , physics ! _ ( in my lifetime , i first realized that the `` mood '' had changed when i heard murray gell - mann say in a public lecture sometime around 1975 `` there is no copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics .",
    "bohr brainwashed a generation of physicists ! '' )    only after physicists stopped being content to regard quantum mechanics as a mere machine for making predictions and started taking seriously what this theory actually _ means _ could real progress be made . today",
    "many new paths for research have opened as a result : string theory , various theories of quantum gravity , and `` spontaneous collapse '' theory are only the beginning of quite a long list . and bell s famous theorem , which has transformed our understanding of the ` measurement problem ' .",

    "the claim that prediction is the most important part of science will stand ( by definition ) , but what would be the point of it ?",
    "the truth is that scientific theories have many properties at which we have to look if we want to decide if we are satisfied with them : predictive power of course , but also explanatory power , internal consistency , compatibility with other theories , ability to suggest new experiments , simplicity , conceptual clarity , etc .",
    "we could start an eternal debate about which properties are necessary , which are the most important ones , and which grant the use of the distinguished `` scientific '' label , but it would probably be a waste of time .",
