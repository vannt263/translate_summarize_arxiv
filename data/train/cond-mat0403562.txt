    "the classification of universality classes of nonequilibrium systems is one of the most important tasks of statistical physics @xcite .",
    "many of the known systems can be mapped onto some reaction - diffusion type of models , the behavior of them are the studied intensively in the past decades @xcite . in these systems particle ( a ) creation , annihilation and diffusion processes compete and by tuning the control parameters phase transition may occur from an active steady state to an inactive , absorbing state of zero density . for a long time",
    "only the critical `` directed percolation '' ( dp ) type of universality class has been known @xcite .",
    "later other classes were discovered related to certain conservation laws or symmetries @xcite , to long - range interactions @xcite , to boundary conditions @xcite or to disorder @xcite .",
    "these findings are all in agreement with the concepts of universality in equilibrium systems .",
    "an extraordinary family of models has triggered a long debate among specialists recently @xcite .",
    "the common behavior of these models is that for a particle production and annihilation at least two particles are needed ( henceforth they are called binary systems ) and these reactions compete with the diffusion of isolated particles .",
    "since for reactions at least a pair is needed while isolated particles can diffuse only these models can also be regarded as coupled systems @xcite .",
    "the representative of this class is the so called diffusive pair contact process ( pcpd ) with reactions @xmath0 , @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "the binary nature was found to be relevant in case of reactions of multi - species @xcite too .",
    "the critical behavior of such models has been found to be different from all previously known classes ( however there is still an ongoing debate on the precise values of critical exponents )",
    ". the lack of symmetries , conservation laws etc .",
    "have been motivating skepticism against the existence of a non - dp class transition and recently some studies suggested dp class behavior with extremely strong correction to scalings @xcite .",
    "field theoretical analysis @xcite on the other hand indicate that the absence of the mass term corresponding to direct channel to the absorbing state ( @xmath6 ) should be responsible for this `` anomalous '' behavior with respect to expectations based on equilibrium statistical physics .",
    "there is an other important difference between binary systems and dp : there is no rapidity symmetry @xmath7 between the field ( @xmath8 ) and the response field ( @xmath9 ) variables in the corresponding field theoretical description contrary the case of the dp process .",
    "furthermore the lack of this relation is not the consequence of a symmetry breaking field of some boundary ( like the @xmath10 boundary with long - ranged correlated order parameter field in case of pair contact process ( pcp ) @xcite ) or some disorder , but it is not there in the definition of these homogeneous , binary systems .",
    "another odd feature is that bosonic ( site unrestricted ) and site restricted versions of these models show completely different behavior .",
    "while site restricted models investigated numerically exhibit the above continuous phase transition , the bosonic versions do not have steady state , but above an abrupt transition the density of particles diverges quickly @xcite .",
    "the field theoretical renormalization group ( rg ) analysis @xcite predicts an upper critical dimension @xmath11 , with logarithmic corrections at @xmath12 for this class ( pcpd ) .",
    "simulations @xcite have confirmed the mean - field scaling in two dimension in case of the @xmath13 , @xmath4 binary production model .",
    "the site mean - field solution of general , @xmath14 models ( with @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 ) resulted in a series of different universality classes * depending on @xmath20 and @xmath21 * @xcite .",
    "this shows that above @xmath22 * @xmath20 and @xmath21 are relevant parameters * determining the type of continuous phase transitions .",
    "in particular for the @xmath23 symmetrical case the density of particles above the critical point ( @xmath24 ) scales as @xmath25 with @xmath26 , while at the critical point it decays as @xmath27 with @xmath28 @xcite ( here `` mf '' denotes mean - field value ) . on the other hand for the @xmath29 asymmetric case continuous phase transitions at zero branching rate",
    "@xmath30 occur with @xmath31 for @xmath32 the mean - field solution provides first order transition .    by going beyond site mean - field approximations",
    "it turns out that the above classification is not completely satisfying . in a previous paper @xcite i investigated the @xmath0 , @xmath1 model by cluster mean - field approximations and simulations in 1d and showed that the * diffusion * plays an important role",
    ": it introduces a different critical point besides the one at @xmath33 branching rate with eq .",
    "( [ asymmfscal ] ) exponents .",
    "the non - trivial critical point , obtained for low diffusion rate exhibits the universal behavior of the @xmath0 , @xmath4 ( pcpd ) model owing to the generation of the effective @xmath4 reaction via : @xmath3 @xcite .    in this work",
    "i continue the study of this model in 2d and show , that similar phase transition structure and critical behavior can be obtained .",
    "this is somewhat surprising , since one may expect that the diffusion is less relevant in higher dimensions due to its short interaction range .",
    "a very recent study using exact methods @xcite showed that the particle density fluctuation and density correlation function are diffusion dependent in the bosonic pcpd model for @xmath34 . in this work",
    "i give numerical evidence for diffusion dependence in a site restricted , binary model in @xmath12 .",
    "this binary production reaction - diffusion model is defined by the rules : @xmath35 here @xmath36 denotes the diffusion probability and @xmath37 is the production probability of the particles .",
    "the site occupancy is restricted to 0 or 1 particle . in @xcite",
    "the cluster mean - field approximations were determined on 1d lattices for @xmath38 cluster sizes . the corresponding reentrant phase diagram is shown on fig . [ pd ] .",
    "although cluster mean - field approximations based on @xmath39 lattices may result in transition points at other locations , the universal features are expected to be the same .",
    "therefore i compare the simulation results with this approximation .    .",
    "i performed simulations in two dimensions in @xmath40 linear sized systems with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "the simulations were started from fully occupied lattices .",
    "one elementary monte carlo step consists of the following processes .",
    "a particle and a number @xmath41 are selected randomly ; if @xmath42 a site exchange is attempted with one of the randomly selected empty nearest neighbors ( nn ) . the time is updated by @xmath43 , where @xmath20 is the total number of particles .",
    "a particle and a number @xmath44 are selected randomly . if @xmath45 and if the number of nn particles is 1 or 2 or 3 , one new particle is created at an empty site selected randomly . if @xmath46 and the number of nn particles is greater than 2 four randomly selected neighboring particles are removed .",
    "the time ( @xmath47 ) is updated by @xmath43 again .",
    "the density of particles was followed up to @xmath48 monte carlo steps ( throughout the whole paper the time is measured by monte carlo steps ( mcs ) ) .    as one",
    "can see on fig.[rs ] simulation data and the 5-point approximations fit qualitatively well . in both cases for weak diffusion rates ( for @xmath49 in 2d simulations )",
    "reentrant phase transitions occur with @xmath24 , while for strong diffusions a single phase transition at @xmath30 branching rate can be found .",
    "the transition lines of the cluster mean - field approximations do not converge towards the simulation line as in 1d ( see fig.[pd ] ) , but the 2d mc curve occurs at lower diffusions . but",
    "this is not surprising , since the cluster mean - field calculations are performed on 1d lattices .",
    "i explored the scaling behavior in more detail at @xmath50 diffusion near the rightmost transition of fig .",
    "[ rs ] ( at @xmath51 ) . by approaching @xmath52 from the active phase the @xmath53 curves bend down rapidly for long times ( beyond @xmath54 mcs ) .",
    "however this proved to be a finite size effect : the break - down of the density curves can be eliminated by increasing @xmath55 .",
    "the largest system i could simulate had a linear size @xmath56 . in this case",
    "no rapid and premature curvatures was observed for @xmath57 mcs .",
    "as one can see on fig.[sl5 ] for @xmath58 all curves veer up , while for @xmath59 they veer down . a clear straight line  indicating scaling with the expected logarithmic correction  can not be seen clearly .",
    "even the @xmath60 curve shows some up and down curvatures in the last decade of the simulations .",
    "however as can be seen on the local slopes figure ( see insert of fig.[sl5 ] ) defined as : @xmath61   \\over \\ln(m ) } \\ , \\label{slopes}\\ ] ] ( where i used @xmath62 ) the transition is around the expected mean - field value of the pcpd class : @xmath63 @xcite .",
    "other curves exhibit strong curvatures for long times , i.e. for @xmath64 they veer up ( active phase ) , while for @xmath59 they veer down ( absorbing phase ) .    the steady state density in the active phase near the critical phase transition point",
    "is expected to scale as @xmath65 .",
    "using the local slopes method one can get a precise estimate for @xmath66 and see the corrections to scaling @xmath67 the steady state behavior at the @xmath24 transition for @xmath50 was investigated using @xmath68 from the density decay analysis . here the local slopes tend to @xmath69 without showing any relevant correction to scaling ( see fig.[betaeff_05 ] ) .",
    "this agrees with the mean - field value of the pcpd model again @xcite .",
    "one may expect the same kind of transition all along the @xmath24 transition line .",
    "indeed simulations showed that the density decays in a similar way at transitions with @xmath70 , @xmath71 , @xmath72 .    to see the transition near @xmath30 ( horizontal axis on fig.[pd ] )",
    "i determined the steady state value of @xmath73 for several @xmath37-s at @xmath50 diffusion .",
    "the steady state density was determined by running the simulations in the active phase near @xmath74 , by averaging over @xmath75 samples in a time window following the level - off is achieved .",
    "the smallest value i tested was @xmath76 , when i had to go up to @xmath77 mcs to reach a steady state ( on a @xmath78 sized system ) . by looking at the data it is quite obvious that the transition is at @xmath79 as the cluster mean - field approximations predicted .",
    "the effective order - parameter exponent ( fig.[beta_0 ] ) tends to @xmath80 as @xmath81 corroborating the cluster mean - field prediction : eq.([asymmfscal ] ) . assuming a correction to scaling of the form @xmath82 fitting results in @xmath83 as can be read - off from fig.[beta_0 ] .",
    "in conclusion i have investigated the ( @xmath36-@xmath37 ) phase diagram of the two dimensional @xmath0 , @xmath1 model with site restriction and explicit particle diffusion .",
    "extensive simulations gave numerical evidence that a reentrant phase diagram emerges as in one dimension and predicted by cluster mean - field approximations @xcite .",
    "this somewhat surprising results mean that diffusion plays relevant role even in @xmath12 dimension . for high diffusion rates",
    "only a mean - field transition at @xmath33 branching rate can be found , while for low diffusion an other transition type at @xmath84 appears .",
    "this latter transition shows the mean - field characteristics of the pcpd model because the effective @xmath4 reaction ( via @xmath3 ) becomes relevant .",
    "the understanding of this diffusion dependence is a challenge for field theory .",
    "similar reentrant phase diagram has been observed in case of the unary production , triplet annihilation model ( @xmath85 , @xmath86 ) @xcite and in a variant of the nekim model @xcite . in all cases",
    "the diffusion competes with particle reaction processes , and the bare parameters should somehow form renormalized reaction rates which govern the evolution over long times and distances . an interesting question is whether this scenario extends above @xmath12 dimensions as the cluster mean - field approximation predicts .",
    "a very recent non - perturbative rg study @xcite finds similar phase diagram in case of the @xmath85 , @xmath4 model for @xmath87 dimensions . that work points out that non - perturbative effects arise and there is a threshold @xmath88 above which dp , while below it a type ( [ asymmfscal ] ) mean - field transition at @xmath30 appears .",
    "the simulations also showed that at the @xmath84 transition the finite size effects and corrections to scaling are very strong .",
    "i had to go up to @xmath89 sized systems and @xmath90 mcs to see the appearance of the expected mean - field scaling with exponents @xmath63 , @xmath91 . showing clear scaling for more than a decade with the predicted logarithmic corrections @xcite is beyond the scope of this study , yet these simulation results for a 2d binary system are by far the largest scale ones published so far . on contrary",
    "the scaling at the @xmath30 critical point is clear with @xmath80 and correction to scaling exponent @xmath83 .",
